 AMENDMENT OF INTERNAL REV-
 ENUE CODE OF 1954, RELATING TO
 DEDUCTION  OF  CERTAIN  EX-
 PENSES BY TEACHERS
 Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I am in-
 troducing, for appropriate reference, a
 bill to correct inequities in rulings by the
 Internal Revenue Service regarding tax
 .deductions of teachers for educational
 expenses.
 The mail I am. receiving, Mr. President,
 indicates that these rulings have worked
 a hardship on many teachers in Nebraska
 at a time when. this Nation and its Gov-
 ernment profess to be placing new em-
 phasis on educational quality.
 Teacher, training and preparation are
 fundamental requirements of improved
 education, far more important than the
 bricks and mortar which provide the
 place for teaching.  This has been true
 through the years and it is still true
 today.
 The Nation is experiencing a critical
 teacher shortage this fall from coast to
 coast. I have read articles citing statis-
 tics placing much of the blame for this
 on the Federal Government.  We must
 take steps to encourage qualified teach-
 ers to improve their skills and remain in
 the profession,  We must encourage
 them to work to improve their station in
 life and thereby the quality of the edu-
 cation provided for our children.
 Under the Internal Revenue Service
 regulations, money spent for education is
 deductible on individual income tax re-
 turns if the expenditure is made to main-
 tain or improve skills required in the
 taxpayer's job, trade or business or if it is
 required by the employer as a condition
 of retaining the taxpayer's job, salary, or
 status.
 This has been interpreted by the IRS
 to mean that teachers are not entitled to
 the deductions if they return to college

 Mr.  TYDINGS.  Mr.  President,  3
 weeks ago, just prior to the Labor Day
 recess, the Senate debated H.R. 9918, a
 bill to protect the residents of the Dis-
 trict of Columbia from insolvent unin-
 sured motorists. The Senate was unable
 to complete action on the bill at that
 time, because we lacked a quorum to do
 so.  However, I am hopeful that now
 the Senate will be able to complete its
 action on H.R. 9918.
 This is purely a local District of Co-
 lumbia bill, but one which it is our duty
 to pass as the legislature for the District
 of Columbia and one which is essential,

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the State

 One of these VISTA volunteers is a

 which is so far from her former home.

 The sole V.I.S.T.A. worker in Fairbanks,

 Smith.
 Mrs. Smith, a ' widow, used to live on
 Kauai.
 Since her two sons are in college, she de-
 cided to "do something."  The "something"
 she decided on was joining V.I.S.T.A. (Vol-
 unteers in Service to America).
 In Fairbanks, Mrs. Smith has a multi-
 pronged job of being adviser-big sister-
 teacher-pal to young village girls who come
 to the city for schooling or to take jobs.
 Headquartered  at  Hospitality  House,  a
 home away from home for these girls, she
 helps them to adapt to city living.

 In addition, she works with young girls
 who began as bar girls, eventually got into
 difficulty and landed In jail.
 She visits the girls in their cells, brings
 them books and helps them to find jobs once
 they're released.
 Mrs. Smith has been teaching them to sew
 and instructing them in nutrition and home-
 making skills.

 She hopes to open a dressmaking shop to

 A MIDDLE WAY OUT OF VIETNAM
 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I had
 scarcely finished reading Richard Good-
 win's call for a united citizens front
 against a wider war in Vietnam when I
 came across a most important article
 authorized by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in
 last Sunday's New York Times magazine,
 September 18, 1966.
 Mr. Schlesinger, like Goodwin, a for-
 mer White House assistant to Presidents
 Kennedy and Johnson, is one of the Na-
 tion's ablest historians.  His article pre-
 sents a most carefully reasoned case
 against the administration's continuous
 enlargement of the Vietnam war-fol-
 lowed by an appeal for a new effort to
 negotiate an end to the fighting.
 Writes Mr. Schlesinger:
 Are the only alternatives widening the war
 or disorderly and humilitiating withdrawal?
 Surely,  our statesmanship is not yet this
 bankrupt.  I think a middle course is still
 possible if there were the will to pursue it.
 And this course must begin with a decision
 to stop widening and Americanizing the war.
 I believe it is a matter of national con-
 cern when two top-level former White
 House advisers with the recognized abil-
 ity of Richard Goodwin and Arthur
 Schlesinger appeal on successive days for
 a halt in the growing U.S. Involvement
 in Vietnam.  These are tough minded,
 realistic thinkers who have seen adminis-
 tration policy being shaped from the in-
 side but who have had the opportunity
 in recent months for thoughtful reflec-
 tion free from official pressures.  I be-
 lieve their sobering words of this past
 weekend deserve the most careful con-
 sideration.
 I ask unanimous consent that Mr.
 Schlesinger's superb article be printed at
 this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was order to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the New York Times Magazine,
 Sept. 1B, 19661
 SCHLESINGER SUGGESTS THAT WE RECOVER OUR
 COOL AND FOLLOW A MIDDLE WAY OUT OF
 VIETNAM
 (By Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.)
 Why we are in Vietnam is today a ques-
 tion                                                       of  only  historical  interest.  We  are
 there, for better or for worse, and we must
 deal with the situation that exists. Our
 national security may not have compelled us
 to draw a line across Southeast Asia where
 we did, but, having drawn it, we cannot
 lightly abandon it.  Our stake in South Viet-
 nam may have been self-created, but it has
 nonetheless become real.  Our precipitate
 withdrawal  now would  have ominous re-
 verberations throughout Asia.  Our commit-
 ment of over 300,000 American troops, young
 men of exceptional skill and gallantry en-
 gaged in cruel and difficult warfare, meas-
 ures the magnitude of our national con-
 cern.
 We have achieved this entanglement, not
 after due and deliberate consideration, but
 through a series of small decisions.  It is
 not only idle but unfair to seek out guilty
 men.  President Eisenhower, after rejecting
 American military intervention In 1954, set
 In motion the policy of support for Saigon
 which  resulted,  two  Presidents  later,  in
 American  military  intervention   in   1965.
 Each step in the deepening of the Ameri-
 can commitment was reasonably regarded
 at the time as the last that would be neces-
 sary; yet, in retrospect, each step led only
 to the next, until  we  find   ourselves  en-
 trapped today in that nightmare of Ameri-
 can strategists, a land war in Asia,-a war
 which  no  President,  including    President
 Johnson, desired or intended.  The Vietnam
 story  is a tragedy without    villains.   No
 thoughtful American    can  withhold     sym-
 pathy                                                                                                                                 as         President  Johnson  ponders    the
 gloomy choices which lie ahead.
 Yet    each  President, as  he makes      his
 choices, must expect to be accountable for
 them.  Everything  in   recent      weeks-the
 actions of the Administration, the intima-
 tions of actions  to come, even a certain
 harshness in the Presidential rhetoric-sug-
 gests that President Johnson has made his
 choice, and that his choice is the careful en-
 largement of the war.  New experiments in
 escalation are first denied, then disowned,
 then discounted and finally undertaken.  As
 past medicine fails, all we can apparently
 think to do is to increase the dose.  In May
 the Secretary of the Air Force explained why
 we were not going to bomb Hanoi and Hai-
 phong; at the end of June we began the
 strikes against the oil depots.  The demili-
 tarized zone between North and South Viet-
 nam has been used by North Vietnam units
 for years, but suddenly we have begun to
 bomb it.
 When such steps work no miracles-and
 it is safe to predict that escalation will be
 no more decisive in the future than it has
 been in the past-the demand will arise for
 "just one more step."  Plenty of room re-
 mains for widening the war: the harbors of
 North  Vietnam,  the  irrigation  dikes,  the
 steel plants, the factories, the power grid,
 the  crops, the  civilian  population,    the
 Chinese border.  The fact that we excluded
 such steps yesterday is, alas, no guarantee
 that we will not pursue them tomorrow.
 And if bombing will not bring Ho Chi Minh
 to his knees or stop his support of the Viet-
 cong in South Vietnam, there is always the
 last resort of invasion.  General Ky has al-
 ready told us that we must invade North
 Vietnam to win the war.   In his recent press
 conference, the Secretary of State twice de-
 clined to rule out this possibility.
 The theory, of course, is that widening the
 war will shorten it.  This theory appeaxs to
 be based on three convictions:  first, that
 the war will be decided in North Vietnam;
 second, that the risk of Chinese or Soviet
 entry is negligible, and third, that military
 "victory" in some sense is possible.  Perhaps
 these premises are correct, and in another
 year or two we may all be saluting the wis-
 dom and statesmanship  of  the American
 Government.  In so inscrutable a situation,
 no one can be confident about his doubt and
 disagreement. Nonetheless, to many Amer-
 icans these propositions constitute a terribly
 shaky basis for action which has already
 carried the United States into a ground war
 in Asia and which may well carry the world
 to the brink of the third world war.
 The illusion that the war in South Viet-
 nam can be decided in North Vietnam is evi-
 dently a result of listening too long to our
 own propaganda.  Our Government has In-
 sisted so often that the war in Vietnam is
 a clear-cut case of aggression across fron-
 tiers that it has come to believe itself that
 the war was started in Hanoi and can be
 stopped there.  "The war," the Secretary of
 State has solemnly assured us, "is clearly an
 `armed attack; cynically and systematically
 mounted by the Hanoi regime against the
 people of South Vietnam."
 Yet the-best evidence is that the war began
 as an insurrection within South Vietnam
 which, as it has gathered momentum, has
 attracted increasing support and direction

 Berkeley, indeed, is the first "political uni-
 versity" in the United States.  This is a de-
 velopment of the highest significance.  For
 the first time the intellectual class of the
 United States is undertaking to enter politics
 directly,  and to  offer  to  the electorate,
 through the agency of faculty-student ac-
 tivists, something akin to an Intellectuals'
 Party. During the spring of 1966 in Berkeley,
 almost all  faculty-student   activism con-
 verged around the candidacy in the Democra-
 tic congressional primary of Robert Scheer,
 who, running on a platform of militant op-
 position to the Vietnam war, nearly defeated
 the liberal incumbent; he carried Berkeley
 by 14,625 votes to 12,165, but lost in the
 district as a whole, receiving 28,751 votes
 against the victor's 35,270. Robert Scheer is
 a typical product of the Berkeley student
 movement,  In 1961, while a graduate student
 in economics, he was an editor and founder

 remarks that the most tragic thing in the

 Scheer was     pro-Castro, anti-John   Ken-
 nedy, and mildly pornopolitical.                  His studies
 came to grief.  He grew a shaggy, Castro-
 like beard, and went to work as a salesman
 for the famed literary center, City Lights
 Bookshop, in San Francisco.        Subsequently,
 the System, through the Center for the
 Study of Democratic Institutions, published
 _a paper by him on Vietnam.                   He spoke at
 teach-ins, and according to V.D.C. spokes-
 men, during the mass demonstration in the
 Berkeley streets on the night of October 15
 supported the breaching of the Oakland po-
 lice formation.  He had been using for some
 time the rhetoric of a seizure of power by
 the Oakland poor.  Then he became a candi-
 date for Congress.                   He trimmed his beard so
 that he looked like a New England whaling
 captain, and began to wear a bourgeois
 jacket, as befitted a well-groomed congres-
 ,sional candidate.                      Student and faculty acti-
 vists gave time and money to the Scheer
 campaign.   They availed themselves of all
 techniques, from exhaustive precinct work
 to demagogy and sexagogy.  One day they
 brought a leading San Francisco go-go danc-
 er to the Lower Plaza to lure the students
 into politics. She danced for the multitude,
 but embarrassed her sponsors by telling a
 reporter that she didn't know who Robert

 Hanoi is the prime actor in this situation,
 that it is the policy of Peking that has great-
 ly stimulated Hanoi.. . . It is Ho Chi Minh's
 war.  Maybe it is Mao Tse-tung's war."
 "In the forties and fifties," President John-
 son has said, "we took our stand in Europe
 to protect the freedom of those threatened by
 aggression.  Now the center of attention has
 shifted to another part of the world where
 aggression is on the march.  Our stand must
 be as firm as ever."  Given this view, it is
 presumably necessary to pay the greatest
 costs and run the greatest risks-or else in-
 vite the greatest defeat.
 Given this view, too, there is no reason not
 to Americanize the war.  President Kennedy
 did not believe that the war in Vietnam
 could succeeed as a war of white men against
 Asians.  It could not be won, he said a few
 weeks before his death, "unless the people
 [of South Vietnam] support the effort....
 We can help them, we can give them equip-
 ment, we can send our men out there as ad-
 visers, but they have to win it, the people of
 Vietnam."  We have now junked this doc-
 trine.                    Instead, we have enlarged our mili-
 ,tary presence until it Is the only thing that
 matters in South Vietnam, and we plan now
 to make it still larger; we have summoned
 the Saigon leaders, like tribal chieftains on
 a retainer, to a conference in an American
 state; we crowd the streets of Saigon with
 American generals  (58 at last count)  and
 visiting stateside dignitaries.  In short, we
 have seized every opportunity to make clear
 to the world that this is an American war-
 and, in doing this, we have surely gone far
 to make the war unwinnable.
 The proposition that our real enemy in
 Vietnam is China is basic to the policy of
 widening the war.  It is the vital element in
 the Administration case.  Yet the proof our
 leaders have adduced for this proposition has
 been exceedingly sketchy and almost per-
 functory.               It has been proof by ideology and
 proof by analogy.  It has not been proof by
 reasoned argument or by concrete illustra-
 tion.
 The proof by ideology has relied on the syl-
 logism that the Vietcong, North Vietnam and
 China are all Communist states and there-
 fore mush be part of the same conspiracy,
 and that, since the Vietcong are the weakest
 of the three, they must therefore be the
 spearhead of a coordinated Chinese plan of
 expansion.  The  Department  of  State,  in
 spite of what has struck most people as a
 rather evident fragmentation of the Commu-
 nist world, has hated to abandon the cozy old
 cliches about a centralized Communist con-
 spiracy aimed at monolithic world revolu-
 tion.
 As late as May 9, 1965, after half a dozen
 years of  public Russo-Chinese  quarreling,
 Thomas C. Mann, then No. 3 man in the de-
 partment, could talk about "instruments of
 Sino-Soviet power" and  "orders  from the
 Sino-Soviet military bloc."  As late as Jan.
 28, 1966, the Secretary of State could still
 run on about "their world revolution," and
 again, on Feb. 18, about "the Communists"
 and their "larger design." While the depart-
 ment may have accepted the reality of the
 Russo-Chinese schism by September, 1966,
 the predominant tone is still to regard Asian
 Communism as a homogenous system of ag-
 gression.  The premise of our policy has been
 that the Vietcong equal Hanoi and Hanoi
 equals Peking.
 Obviously, the Vietcong, Hanoi and Peking
 have interests in common and strong ideolo-
 gical affinities.  Obviously, Peking would re-
 joice in a Hanoi-Vietcong victory.  But they
 also have divergent interests and purposes-
 and the divergencies may prove in the end to
 be stronger than the affinities.  Recent de-
 velopments In North Korea are instructive. If
 any country was bound to Peking by ties of
 gratitude, it was North Korea, which was pre-
 served as an independent state by Chinese
 intervention 15 years ago.  If any country
 today is at the mercy of Peking, it is again
 North Korea.  When North Korea now de-
 clares in vigorous language its independence
 of China, does anyone suppose that North
 Vietnam, imbued with historic mistrust of
 China and led by that veteran Russian agent
 Ho Chi Minh, would have been more slavish
 in its attitude toward Peking?
 The other part of the Administration case
 has been proof by analogy, especially the
 good old Munich analogy.  "I'm not the vil-
 lage idiot," the Secretary of State recently
 confided to Stewart Alsop.  "I know Hitler
 was an Austrian and Mao is a Chinese....
 But what is common between the two situa-
 tions is the phenomenon of aggression."  The
 Vietnam war, President Johnson recently told
 the American Legion, "is meant to be the
 opening salvo in a series of bombardments
 or, as they are called in Peking, 'wars of lib-
 eration.' "  If this technique works this week
 in Vietnam, the Administration suggests, it
 will be tried next week in Uganda and Peru.
 But, if it is defeated in Vietnam, the Chi-
 nese will know that we will not let It succeed
 elsewhere.
 "What happens in South Vietnam," the
 President cried at Omaha, "will determine-
 yes, it will  determine-whether ambitious
 and aggressive nations can use guerrilla war-
 fare to conquer  their  weaker  neighbors."
 The Secretary of State even described an
 exhortation made last year by the Chinese
 Defense Minister, Marshal Lin Piao,  as  a
 blueprint for world conquest comparable to
 Hitler's "Mein Kampf."
 One  thing  is  sure  about  the  Vietnam
 riddle: it will not be solved by bad his-
 torical analogies.  It seems a trifle forced,
 for example, to equate a civil war in what
 was for hundreds of years the entity of Viet-
 nam (Marshal Ky, after all, is a North Viet-
 namese himself)    with Hitler's invasion of
 Austria and Czechoslovakia across old and
 well-established lines of national division;
 even the village idiot might grasp that differ-
 ence.
 When President Eisenhower invoked the
 Munich analogy in 1954 in an effort to in-
 volve the British in Indochina, Prime Minis-
 ter  Churchill,  a  pretty  close  student  of
 Munich in his day, was unmoved.  The Chi-
 nese have neither the overwhelmingly mili-
 tary power nor the timetable of aggression
 nor, apparently, the pent-up mania for in-
 stant      expansion  which   would  justify the
 Hitler parallel. As for the Lin Piao docu-
 ment, the Rand Corporation, which evidently
 read it with more care than the State De-
 partment bothered to do, concluded that, far
 from being Mao's "Mein Kampf," it was a
 message to the Vietcong that they could win
 "only if they rely primarily on their own
 resources and their own revolutionary spirit,"
 and that it revealed "the lack, rather than
 the extent, of Peking's past and present con-
 trol over Hanoi's actions."
 In any case, guerrilla warfare is not a
 tactic to be mechanically applied by central
 headquarters  to  faraway  countries.  More
 than any other form of warfare, It is de-
 pendent  on  conditions  and  opportunities
 within the countries themselves.    Whether
 there  are  wars  of national liberation in
 Uganda and Peru will depend, not on what
 happens in Vietnam, but on what happens
 in Uganda and Peru.
 One can agree that the containment of
 China will be a major problem for the next
 generation.  But this does not mean that
 we must re-enact in Asia in the sixties the
 exact drama of Europe in the forties and
 fifties.  The record thus far suggests that
 the force most likely to contain Chinese ex-
 pansionism In Asia (and Africa, too)  will
 be not Western Intervention but local na-
 tionalism.  Sometimes local nationalism may
 can on Western support-but not always.
 Countries like Burma and Cambodia preserve
 their autonomy without American assistance.
 The Africans have dealt with the Chinese on
 their own.  The two heaviest blows recently
 suffered by Peking--the destruction of the
 Communist party in Indonesia and the decla-
 ration of independence by North Korea-took
 place without benefit of American patronage
 or rhetoric.
 In an unpredictable decades ahead, the
 most effective bulwark against "internation-
 al" Communism in some circumstances may
 well be national Communism.  A rational
 policy of containing China could have recog-
 nized that a Communist Vietnam under Ho
 might be a better instrument of containment
 than a shaky Saigon regime led by right-
 wing mandarins or air force generals.  Had
 Ho taken over all Vietnam in 1954, he might
 today be enlisting Soviet support to strength-
 en his resistance to Chinese pressure-and
 this  situation,  however appalling for the
 people of South Vietnam, would obviously be
 better for the United States than the one
 in which we  are floundering today. And
 now, alas, it may be almost too late: the
 whole thrust of United States policy since
 1954, and more than ever since the bombing
 of the North began, has been not to pry
 Peking and Hanoi apart but to drive them
 together.
 Is there no way out?  Are the only alter-
 natives widening the war or disorderly and
 humiliating withdrawal? Surely, our states-
 manship is not yet this bankrupt.  I think
 a middle course is still possible if there were
 the will to pursue it.  And this course must
 begin with a decision to stop widening and
 Americanizing the war-to limit our forces,
 actions,  goals  and    rhetoric.  Instead  of
 bombing   more   places,  sending  in     more
 troops, proclaiming ever more ardently that
 the fate of civilization will be settled in
 Vietnam, let us recover our cool and try to
 see the situation as it is: a horrid civil war
 in which Communist guerrillas, enthusias-
 tically aided and now substantially directed
 from Hanoi, are trying to establish a Com-
 munist despotism in South Vietnam, not for
 the Chinese but for themselves.  Let us un-
 derstand that the ultimate problem here is
 not military but political.  Let us adapt the
 means we employ to the end we seek.
 Obviously, military action plays an indis-
 pensable role in the search for a political
 solution.  Hanoi and the Vietcong will not
 negotiate so long as they think they can
 win.  Since stalemate is a self-evident pre-
 condition                                                                                                                                          to  negotiation,  we  must  have
 enough American armed force in South Viet-
 nam to leave no doubt in the minds of our
 adversaries that they cannot hope for vic-
 tory.                                                                                                                                     They must also have no illusion about
 the prospect of an American      withdrawal.
 The object of the serious opposition to the
 Johnson policy is to bring about not an
 American  defeat  but a negotiated settle-
 ment.
 Therefore, holding the line in South Viet-
 nam Is essential.                                                                                                                                   Surely, we already have
 enough American troops, firepower and in-
 stallations in South Vietnam to make it clear
 that we cannot be beaten unless we choose
 to scuttle and run, which will not happen.
 The opponents of this strategy talk as if a
 holding action would put our forces under
 siege  and  relinquish  all  initiative  to  the
 enemy.  This need not, of course, be so.      It
 is possible to slow down a war without stand-
 ing still; and, if our present generals can't
 figure out how to do this, then let us get
 generals who can.   Generals Ridgway and
 Gavin could doubtless suggest some names.
 Moreover, there is a South Vietnamese army
 of some 600,000 men which can take all the
 initiative it wants. And if we are told thzt
 the South Vietnamese are unwilling or un-
 able to fight the Vietcong, then we must
 wonder all the more about the political side
 of the war.
 The object of our military policy, as ob-
 servers like Henry Kissinger and James Mac-
 Gregor Burns have proposed, should be the
 creation and stabilization of secure areas

 where the South Vietnamese might them-
 selves  undertake social and institutional
 development.  Our resources should go, in
 the Vietnam jargon, more to clear-and-hold
 than to search-and-destroy (especially when
 search-and-destroy more often means search-
 and-drive-underground).  We should get rid
 of those "one-star generals who," in the words
 of Sir Robert Thompson, "regard their tour
 in Vietnam as an opportunity to indulge in
 a year's big-game shooting from their heli-
 copter howdahs at Government expense."
 At the same time we should induce the
 Saigon Government to institute generous
 amnesty provisions of the kind which worked
 so well in the Philippines.  And we should
 further increase the incentive to come over
 by persuading the South Vietnamese to aban-
 don the torture of prisoners-a practice not
 only horrible in itself but superbly calculated
 to make the enemy fight to the bitter end.
 In the meantime we must end our own
 shameful collaboration with this barbarism
 and stop turning Vietcong prisoners over to
 the South Vietnamese when we know that
 torture is probable.
 As for bombing the North, let us taper
 this off as prudently as we can.  Bombing is
 not likely to deter Hanoi any more in the
 future than It has in the past; and, given
 its limited military effect, the Administra-
 tion's desire to gratify the Saigon Govern-
 ment and the American voter is surely not
 important enough to justify the risks of
 indefinite escalation.  Moreover, so long as
 the bombing continues there is no chance of
 serious negotiation.  Nor does the failure of
 the 37-day pause of last winter to produce
 a settlement refute this.  Thirty-seven days
 were hardly enough to persuade our allies
 that we honestly wanted negotiation;  so
 brief an interlude left no time for them
 to move on to the tricky job of persuading
 Hanoi.  For Hanoi has substantial reasons
 for  mistrusting  negotiation-quite apart
 from Chinese pressure or its own hopes of
 victory. Ho has entered into negotiation
 with the West twice in the past-in 1946--47
 and again in 1954-and each time, in his
 view, he lost at the conference table things
 he thought he had won on the battlefield.
 For all our official talk about our readiness
 to go anywhere, talk to anyone, etc., it can-
 not be said that the Administration has pur-
 sued negotiation with a fraction of the zeal,
 imagination and perseverance with which
 it has pursued war.  Indeed, some Ameri-
 can scholars who have studied the matter
 believe that on a number of occasions when
 pressure for negotiation was mounting we
 have, for whatever reason, stepped up the
 war.
 Nor can it be said that the Administration
 has laid fairly before the American people
 the occasional signals, however faint, which
 have come from Hanoi-as in the early win-
 ter  of  1965,  when  U  Thant's  mediation
 reached the point of selecting the hotel In
 Rangoon where talks might take place, until
 we killed the idea by beginning the bombing
 of the North. Nor, for all our declarations
 about "unconditional" negotiations, have we
 refrained from setting conditions-such as,
 for example, that we won't talk to the Viet-
 cong unless they come to the conference
 table  disguised  as  North  Vietnamese.
 Though the Vietcong constitute the great
 bulk of the enemy force, they have been
 escalation without considerable inner up-
 heaval.  The issue in the United States in the
 months to come will be whether President
 Johnson's leadership is sufficiently resilient
 and forbearing to permit a change in the
 direction of policy and arrest what is coming
 increasingly to seem an accelerating drift
 toward a great and unnecessary catastrophe.
 TRAFFIC IN FIREARMS
 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for 6 years,
 now, I have been investigating the very
 serious traffic in firearms sold through
 the interstate malls and delivered to
 juveniles, criminals, addicts, and others.
 I have had proposed legislation pend-
 ing before Congress for more than 3
 years.  Each attempt to pass a stronger
 gun-control law has been stymied by gun
 lobbyists, misled sportsmen, and spokes-
 men representing that portion of the gun
 industry which wants no further legisla-
 tion whatsoever.
 Although representing only a minority,
 these opponents have repeatedly demon-
 strated their effectiveness. No new gun
 law has been passed, and the present bill,
 S. 1592, which I introduced as a part of
 the President's crime bill package, has
 been stalled for weeks in the Committee
 on the Judiciary.
 During these same years, a number of
 public opinion polls have been conducted
 by professional, respected opinion takers
 on the question of stronger and more ef-
 fective gun laws.
 I have yet to see one of these polls
 register less than 70 percent of the public
 in favor of new laws to reduce effectively
 the flow of deadly weapons into the
 hands  of  potential  troublemakers.  I
 might add that in each of these polls the
 questions were based on proposals going
 far beyond any legislation under serious
 consideration, such as the registration of
 all guns and the fingerprinting of gun
 owners. Even so, 70 percent or more fa-
 vored more effective controls.
 A poll published in the Washington
 Post of September 14, 1966, finally drops
 below this 70-percent mark.
 In this Gallup po11, based on a question
 which suggests that the legislation now
 before the Senate would require a record
 to be made of the gun and the name of
 the purchaser, only 68 percent of the
 nongun owning public favored stronger
 controls.
 However, that same poll shows that 56
 percent of the gun owners themselves
 favor such a strong law and would vote
 for its enactment.
 I wonder what effect this revelation
 will have on the small army of self-styled
 spokesmen for the 20 million American
 hunters and gun owners who say they
 want no gun law at all.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the Gallup poll be printed at

 rules of free elections.  Nor is there reason
 to see why we have been so reluctant again to
 follow the Laos model and declare neutrali-
 zation, under international guarantee, our
 long-run objective for Vietnam.  An imag-
 inative diplomacy would long since have dis-
 cussed the ways and means of such neutrali-
 zation with Russia, France, Britain and other
 interested countries. Unsatisfactory as the
 situation in Laos may be today, it is still in-
 comparably better than  the  situation in
 South Vietnam.
 On the other hand, negotiation is not an
 exclusive, or even primary, American respon-
 sibility.                                                                                  Along with a military stalemate, the
 other precondition of a diplomats settlement
 is surely a civilian government in Saigon.
 Marshal Ky is one of those Frankenstein's
 monsters  we  delight  in  creating  in  our
 "client"  countries,  very much    like  the
 egregious  General    Phoumi   Nosavan,  who
 single-handedly blocked a settlement in Laos
 for two years.  Like Phoumi, Ky evidently
 feels that Washington has committed itself
 irrevocably to him-and why should he not
 after the laying on of hands at Honolulu?-
 and that, whatever he does, we cannot afford
 to abandon him.
 Robert.Shaplen, in the August 20 issue of
 The New Yorker, reported from Saigon that
 the atmosphere there "is being compared to
 the miasma that surrounded Diem and his
 tyrannical brother Ngo Dinh Nhu" and that
 "many Vietnamese believe that the Ameri-
 cans, having embraced Ky so wholeheartedly
 and supported him so long, are just as re-
 sponsible as his Government for the recent
 repressive acts."
 I am sure that President Johnson did not
 intend to turn over American policy and
 honor in Vietnam to Marshal Ky's gimcrack,
 bullyboy, get-rich-quick regime.  The time is
 bound to come when Ky must learn the facts
 of life, as General Phoumi eventually and
 painfully learned them.
 But why wait?  In our whole time in Viet-
 nam, there has never been a Government in
 Saigon which had the active loyalty of the
 countryside.  It might be an agreeable experi-
 ment to encourage one to come into exist-
 ence.  Instead of Identifying American in-
 terests with Ky and rebuffing the broader
 political  impulses  in  South  Vietnam,  we
 should long since have welcomed a move-
 ment toward a civilian regime representing
 the significant political forces of the country
 and capable both of rallying the army and
 carrying forward programs of social reform.
 We should give such a Government all pos-
 sible assistance in rebuilding and modern-
 izing the political and institutional struc-
 tures of South Vietnam.  And if it should
 favor the neutralization of its country, if it
 should seek negotiation with the Vietcong,
 even if it should release us from our commit-
 ment to stay in Vietnam, we should not think
 that the world is coming to an end.
 It is not too late to begin the deescalation
 of the war; nor would the reduction of our
 military effort damage our International in-
 fluence.  "'T'here is more respect to be won
 in the opinion of this world," George Kerman

 but as one farm expert has noted, "the Ad-
 ministration really is in a corner.  It keeps
 telling the farmer that it is his friend. But
 the farmer is still skeptical."
 The reaction of farmers and ranchers is
 clear.
 What was the reaction in Congress?
 I can assure you that it was vigorous and
 -Intense.   Except possibly for Vietnam and
 Inflation, I don't think any other single issue
 has been subjected to as much debate as this
 one.  Both Democrats and Republicans have
 taken part, and the debate has been almost
 entirely highly critical of the Administra-
 tion's actions.
 Let me cite a couple examples.  The Con-
 gressional reaction to the cattlehide export
 embargo was so intense that the Commerce
 Department ultimately has to retreat, ac-

 restore a portion of the cutback.  In regard

 votes than they lost.  The fact that it ap-
 parently has not turned out this way is due
 to a certain extent to the manner in which
 these actions were taken.
 But regardless of how they were handled,
 the fact remains that they were taken.  In
 trying to explain why these decisions were
 made, I have heard a lot of people say that
 they are due to the fact that the Adminis-
 tration is against the farmer.  Now this is
 a simple and easy answer, but I believe that
 it is a dangerously naive one.  I shall defend
 the Administraton against the charge that
 it is deliberately anti-farmer for the simple
 reason that both the President and the Sec-
 retary are experienced enough in politics to
 know that you don't make political hay by
 being  anti-anybody  except  for  extremist
 groups of both the right and the left.
 Thus, the question is not whether the
 Administration  is against the  farmer but
 whether he really is for him.     When the
 political chips are down is this Administra-
 tion really prepared to stand up and do right
 by agriculture?
 In this lies the most crucial question mark
 about agriculture's future.  It is too early to
 answer with certainty.  However, one thing
 is  absolutely clear;  the national  political
 climate is changing dramatically and at a
 faster pace than many of us realize.       The

 A similar theme is developed in the

 Some of the opposition to the registration
 of guns comes from those who think that
 this would mean banning all guns.  Actu-
 ally, the law proposed would not prohibit a
 person from owning a gun-either for sport
 or protection-but would require that a rec-
 ord be made of the name of the gun pur-
 chaser.  The purpose of such a law would be
 to keep guns out of the hands of persons with
 a criminal record, the mentally disturbed
 and others unqualified to handle weapons.
 The mood of the public for nearly three
 decades has been to impose controls on the
 sale and possession of weapons.
 The survey questions and findings:
 "Would you favor or oppose a law which
 would require a person to obtain a police
 permit before he or she could buy a gun?"

 Those who favor such a law:
 1. Too many people get guns who are ir-

 2. It would save lives.
 3. It's too easy to get guns.
 4. It would be a help to the police.
 5. It would keep guns out of the hands of
 teenagers.
 Reasons of those who oppose such a law:
 1. Such a law would take away the individ-
 ual's rights.
 2. Such  a  law  wouldn't  work-people
 would still get guns if they wanted to.
 3. People need guns for protection.

 the  Department of Commerce a.nnounced
 that It was imposing Stringent restrictions
 on the export of cattlehides.  The uproar
 over this incident was loud-but I will refer
 to this mater later on.
 It was also during March, April and May
 that the Secretary and other top Administra-

 food prices and inflation.  Gardner Ackley,
 Chairman of the Council of Economic Ad-

 corn was intended to encourage pork produc-

 prices.  The Defense Department announced
 that it was cutting back on its purchases of
 pork and leather and was substituting mar-
 garine for butter.   Also it became known
 during this period that the Administration
 was increasing the import quotas on such
 products as sugar and cheese.

 In essential respects it is the Johnson Ad-
 ministration that is isolationist.  Its oP-
 ponents would favor a constructive foreign
 policy.  Their opposition is to a policy of
 aggression that has alienated allies and hard-
 ened the resolution of opponents-policy
 that, in the view of such an experienced ob-
 server as U Thant, carries within it the ful-
 minate of a third World War.
 Mr. Johnson and his aides give lip service
 to the United Nations while undercutting it
 at  every  turn.  This  is  de  facto  isola-
 tionism-the sacrifice of international order
 to domestic political advantage. The reason
 U Thant is reluctant to accept another term
 as  Secretary-General   is  the ambivalence
 which President Johnson, Secretary Rusk
 and  Ambassador  Goldberg have exhibited
 time and again in their relations with him.
 Why should he remain in an office in which
 he is powerless to restrain the continuing
 American probing of supposed Soviet and
 Chinese impotence to give significant aid to
 North Vietnam and the National Liberation
 Front?  If it should turn out to be based
 on  a miscalculation, this experimentation
 threatens to bring on a 'disastrous show-
 down-disastrous because the circumstances
 will permit neither a compromise between
 the belligerents nor retreat of either from
 hardened positions.
 The headlines show the accelerating prog-
 ress toward this kind of confrontation, as in
 "Strategists. See Need in Vietnam for 600,000
 GIs" (The 'New York Times, August 29), and
 in the same issue "Moscow Training Fliers for
 Hanoi."  The correspondent reports on ar-
 ticles in three leading Soviet newspapers,
 stating that at least one detachment of Viet-
 namese pilots have completed a combat fly-
 ing course under the direction of "Soviet
 battle veterans" and have returned to North
 Vietnam, while another group Is under in-
 struction.  Inexperienced Vietnamese pilots
 in MIG-17s are not much of a menace to
 American fliers, but now there are sugges-
 tions  that the Soviet Union may  supply
 MIG-21s or the "all-weather" MIG-23s.
 Should the Vietnamese prove unequal to
 the difficulties of their mission, rather than
 allow a sister Communist state to be de-
 stroyed the Russians may send their own
 pilots into combat.  According to Donald
 Grant, the staff correspondent of the St.
 Louis Post-.Dispatch at the UN, U Thant was
 told in Moscow recently that Russian pilots
 would be sent to fly MIG-21s in Vietnam,
 and Russian crews would man the Russian-
 built surface-to-air missile sites which, by
 whomever manned heretofore, have made a
 dismal showing against U.S. aircraft.  Thant
 is said to have repeated this to Under Sec-
 retary of State George Ball and Sen. ROBERT
 F. KENNEDY, and presumably Secretary Rusk
 has been Informed.  But, Grant writes, UN
 diplomats "see no signs that Thant's view
 will have any real impact on U.S. policy."
 A familiar story.
 Suppose, however, that the worst does
 not come to the worst, and a lethal con-
 frontation between the two great powers is
 providentially avoided.  This would not in-
 could discharge effectively, such as deter-
 rence of nuclear war and economic assist-
 ance to countries politically and industrially
 qualified.  That kind of internationalism the
 critics     of  the  Administration  could  and
 would       support. It is Johnson's   ventures
 abroad in search of monsters to destroy that
 the critics condemn and that Johnson him-
 self, were he to reflect, could see leading
 SARATOGA             PERFORMING            ARTS
 CENTER IN NEW YORK STATE-A
 SUMMER CULTURAL ATTRACTION
 Mr. KENNEDY of New York.                    Mr.
 President, I would like to call attention
 to the conclusion of a successful first
 season of the Saratoga Performing Arts
 Center.
 During this season more than 85,000
 people visited Saratoga Springs to attend
 21 performances of the New York City
 Ballet. An additional 83,000 visitors at-
 tended the 14 concerts of the Philadel-
 phia Symphony Orchestra.  These at-
 tendance figures reflect the enthusiastic
 public response to the programs offered
 by the Center.
 In commenting on the quality of the
 programs at the Center, Mr. Paul Hume
 remarked in the Washington Post of
 July 31:
 The happy fact is that a superlative com-
 bination of excellences has come together at
 Saratoga ... one of the world's greatest ballet
 companies and one of the world's finest sym-
 phony orchestras ... At a single stroke the
 Saratoga Performing Arts Center has placed
 Saratoga in the very top circle of summer
 music centers.
 The Saratoga Performing Arts Center
 provides a unique setting for the per-
 formance of these programs.  The am-
 phitheater at the center was designed
 and engineered with Imagination and
 competence by Architect John MacFay-
 den and acoustical consultant Paul Vene-
 klasen. It seats 5,100 and Is placed in a
 graceful natural locale which permits the
 seating of almost 2,000 more on the sur-
 rounding lawn.
 Hotel, dining, and other refreshment
 facilities are within walking distance, at
 the nearby Gideon Putnam State Reser-
 vation.
 The arts center adds a new dimension
 to .the many attractions of Saratoga
 Springs, the renowned racetrack, the
 National Racing Museum, the spas, the
 Yaddo Gardens, swimming pools, and a
 series of golf courses for every player.
 The center's performances make a visit
 to Saratoga that much more enjoyable.
 The Saratoga area is also interesting
 from a historical standpoint.  Nearly

 of this historic area.  I look forward to
 its growth as a national summer cultural
 center.  I call the center to the atten-
 tion of my colleagues as one of the new
 attractions  that  makes  upstate New
 York an outstanding place to visit and
 enjoy.
 POWER PROJECT
 Mrs. SMITH.        Mr. President, because
 of the very considerable opposition in
 the House of Representatives to the
 Dickey-Lincoln School Power Project-
 because the House Appropriations Com-
 mittee has cut the President's proposed
 budget on the item by one-third from the
 requested $1,200,000 for fiscal year 1968-
 because the House Appropriations Com-
 mittee placed  a  delaying restriction
 even on these reduced funds by impos-
 ing the restriction and condition of an-
 other study on this project-and because
 the House will vote on this project to-
 morrow, I deem it appropriate and ur-
 gent to place before the Congress the
 high points of the testimony given to-
 day by the Army Engineers before the.
 Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on
 Public Works this morning.
 These very pertinent points were made
 in the statement of General Leber and in
 answer to questions asked by myself and
 the chairman of the subcommittee, the
 senior Senator from Louisiana.  Army
 Engineers witnesses testified that:
 First. There was no need for further
 study and investigation of the project
 for it had been studied several times,
 citing studies in 1953, 1956, 1959, 1963,
 and 1965;
 Second. That these studies had clearly
 established that the project met all three
 tests of comparability, financial feasibil-
 ity, and favorable benefit-cost ratio;
 Third. That the benefit-cost ratio was
 a very favorable 1.9-to-1 ratio-in other
 words, annually the benefits will be twice
 as great as the cost of the project;
 Fourth. That the Army Engineers had
 a capability of $2 million of work on the
 project in fiscal 1967 even though the
 President had asked for only $1,200,000
 and the House Appropriations Commit-
 tee had cut the amount down to only
 $800,000;
 Fifth. That the action of the House
 Appropriations Committee would delay
 the. action program on the project on
 the project by at least 1 year; and
 Sixth. That the status of the treaty
 negotiations was that while all the
 details had been worked out, the treaty
 had not yet been ratified because of
 change in personnel handling the treaty,
 but was about to be ratified.

 SPEECH BY RICHARD N. GOODWIN AT THE NA-
 TIONAL BOARD MEETING OF AMERrCANB FOR
 DEMOCRATIC ACTION, STATLER-HILTON HOTEL,
 WASHINGTON, D.C.,  SEPTEMBER  17, 1966
 This is a time when labels are unfashion-
 able.  Men hesitate to call themselves liberals
 or conservatives or radicals, fearing the com-
 plexity of their views will be swallowed up in
 some formal catechism of belief. Yet groups
 like this one are drawn together by a shared
 body of beliefs and values, and by common
 reactions to the sins and shortcomings of
 their society.  They differ on many particu-
 lar issues; but they do agree on the wisdom
 of a general direction and the urgency of
 certain purposes. In this sense, even in non-
 ideological America, there are radicals and
 rightists, liberals and conservatives.  In this
 sense the Americans for Democratic Action
 is the spearhead of American liberalism.
 It can look back on a record of achieve-
 ment unmatched in American political orga-
 nization.  It has elected dozens of members
 to high office, many of its early programs are
 now law, and its once theoretical notions are
 the daily staple of bureaucracy.
 It is easy to blunt, answer, and even ignore
 the criticism of liberalism which is largely
 a reflex action from past battles.  The ease
 of such refutation, however, should not be
 permitted to obscure real defects.  If there
 is reason for doubt it is not that today's
 liberals are too progressive, but that they are
 often not progressive enough: not that they
 are radical but that they are sometimes mired
 in  outworn outlooks and programs;  not
 that they are impractical but they have occa-
 sionally                   let  practical  necessities  override
 faithfulness to ideals and values.   We have
 discovered the perverse principle that defeat
 can breed strength while victory often erodes
 will and creates intoxication with success.
 Success is the disease of American society, a
 disease which strikes impartially at business-
 men, politicians, movie stars and intellectuals
 alike,
 It is especially virulent when it attacks the
 politically concerned and passionate, making
 them more anxious to enact bad programs
 than fight for a good one, elect a mediocrity
 than lose with distinction, support a sym-
 pathetic office holder even when he is wrong,
 simply because he is sympathetic. We do not
 advocate a policy of  defeatism or even
 political suicide.  We are politicians and the
 object of politics Is the acquisition and use of
 power.     Pragmatism, the code word of today's
 liberalism, is a useful tool to carry you for-
 ward, remove obstacles, and solve problems.
 But it does not tell you where to go. Beliefs
 tell you. Values tell you. Common goals tell
 you.  Once that distinction is obscured it is
 easy to forget where you are going and even
 who you are.
 Let me give a few tentative thoughts about
 today's redefinition of liberal goals before
 proceeding to the principal obstacle to all
 those goals: the war in Vietnam.
 Liberal thought in America has always
 been a confederation of diverse beliefs. But
 there have been certain, discernible, central
 strands in the fabric of the past thirty years.
 One is the once revolutionary idea that the
 national government has a direct respon-
 sibility for the welfare of the people:  For
 their well-being as individuals-older cit-
 izens, poor or Negro-and for the general
 health of the economy. Another is the belief
 that private power Must be compelled to act
 in the public interest, that through regula-
 tion America must be made safe for capital-
 ism.
 Those were the subject of wonderful, pas-
 sionate engagements, but they are largely
 won,   They have become the truisms of
 American political life, although there are
 No. 159-8
 many important skirmishes to be fought and
 the specter of Hooverism occasionally looms
 over the horizon only to be brushed casually
 away by a slightly surprised electorate.
 It is this victory of important principle,
 and the changes it has helped bring the na-
 tion, which makes it necessary to rethink
 most of the old political beliefs and slogans
 as this organization, and others, have been
 doing.
 At one time to be a liberal meant to be
 for  federal  action  against  states'  rights.
 Particularly in civil rights this is still a vital
 question.   Yet our major effort now is to
 find new ways to help states and local gov-
 ernment assume responsibilities  and                                                                                 bur-
 dens; and it was a Democratic liberal, not a
 Republican conservative, who proposed to
 turn over federal revenue to state govern-
 ment.
 At one time to be a liberal meant to auto-
 matically favor the cause of labor over busi-
 ness.  Yet the Chamber of Commerce is more
 willing to trade with China than the AFL-
 CIO; unions are often more concerned with
 protecting the established order than busi-
 nessmen; and it was the liberals who helped
 pass laws  against  racketeering  in  labor.
 Even the most ardent liberal will prefer the
 activities of Tom Watson of IBM to those of
 Jimmy Hoffa.
 At one time to be a liberal was to oppose
 big business.  Yet it was the Administration
 of  John  Kennedy,  not  Eisenhower,  that
 proposed and passed measures for business
 expansion to the benefit of all of us.
 At one time to be a liberal was to fight for
 the principle that collective action did not
 diminish individual freedom.  While we still
 go through the motions, the battle is over,
 for freedom has been enlarged as collective
 action widened.  Rather we are now increas-
 ingly  concerned                                                                         about  coercion from  the
 center.
 These old battle cries are largely a victim
 of success and of profound changes in Amer-
 ican society.   They were built on the as-
 sumption that rising wealth fairly shared
 was the key to the American dream.   Of
 course, that dream has not yet come true
 for the chronically poor or the Negro. Still,
 in terms of the old values, most Americans
 have achieved greatly.  They are well-fed,
 live in decent houses, own television sets,
 drive 94 million automobiles, and debate not
 whether but where to take a vacation. Yet
 even at the moment of victory for so many
 we  know  that  shared  prosperity  is not
 enough.   Modern man, with all his wealth
 and comfort, is oppressed by forces which
 menace and confine the quality of his life.
 Increasingly American thinkers are dis-
 covering,                                                                             describing,  and  attacking these
 forces.   It is the responsibility of politics
 to translate this emerging awareness Into
 political action.
 The ancient desire to stretch one's talents
 to the limit of ability and desire now enters
 a world whose instruments grow In complex-
 ity, where understanding is more difficult as
 the possibilities of all encompassing knowl-
 edge disappear, and where leisure threatens
 many with boredom and futility.  It is not
 enough to train -people, we must do so
 through an educational system of a quality
 and daring of innovation past all our old ob-
 jectives.
 Even with knowledge and understanding
 at his command, however, man alone is not
 man fulfilled.  He must be sustained and
 strengthened by the world around him, and
 by those with whom he lives and works.
 He will not find that strength in cities
 scarred by slums, encircled by suburbs which
 sprawl  recklessly across the  countryside;
 where movement is dif cult, beauty rare, life
 itself more impersonal and security imperiled
 by the lawless.
 And even beyond education and the de-
 terioration  of  our  environment                                                                                  modern
 America assaults the deepest values of our
 civilization,  those worlds  within  a  world
 where each man can find meaning and dig-
 nity and warmth: family and neighborhood,
 community and the dignity of work.
 Family ties grow weaker as the gap be-
 tween the generations widens.                                                                                                                                      The com-
 munity disappears as the streets of our cities
 rush in upon each other.  Work, once the
 principal support of self-respect, becomes
 more and more mechanical, each man a re-
 placeable componency in an abstract task.
 Ahead lies the most terrible danger of all: a
 nation of strangers; each separate from his
 fellows, remote from his labors, detached
 from participation in the great enterprise of
 American life.
 Underneath there is a single, overwhelm-
 ing cause for the discontent which runs
 like a dark thread through the silver fabric
 of American life.  It is cause and conse-
 quence of all the rest.  It is the fear of the
 individual human being that he has become
 meaningless in the great human enterprise.
 Decisions of peace and war, life and death,
 are made by a handful of men beyond his
 reach.  Cities and factories grow and spread
 seemingly powered by a force beyond the
 control of man.
 Science describes our world, and life itself,
 in terms far beyond the reach of ordinary
 understanding.  Computers and marvelous
 machines seem to make man unnecessary in
 the oldest stronghold of all, his work.
 This is the motive power, the fueling force,
 behind the new right and  the new left.
 They want to matter.  And so do we all.
 To glimpse the shortcomings of American
 life, to feel the weight of dark and obscure
 forces, even to illuminate with  investiga-
 tion and thought the wrongs of American
 life, it is not enough for any group dedicated
 to political action.  That requires we trans-
 late passion, engagement, and a sense of in-
 justice into concrete action; as individual
 groups, and through political institutions.
 Many of the proposals which fill liberal jour-
 nals and meeting chambers are little more
 than logical extensions of old ideas and proc-
 esses,  The guaranteed annual wage, the or-
 ganization of farm workers, national health
 insurance, and many other ideas, can stand
 on their own merits but they hardly repre-
 sent a radical departure from our past.  Most
 of the causes which engage us deeply-from
 civil rights to the war against poverty-flow
 from the historic drive to open the blessings
 of society to all people.
 I do not pretend to have the answers or
 a dramatic new approach but it seems to
 me that certain guidelines are emerging
 which may help show the way.
 First, is to devote more of our resources
 to common needs; from schools and play-
 grounds to blighted cities and poisoned air.
 History  has  proved  that  rising  national
 wealth   does not  resolve  social problems.
 Present  experience  proves   that  the  old
 method of handing out federal grants will
 not rebuild a city or clean up pollution. The
 problems of the city, for example, are not
 simply problems of welfare or income.   They
 demand technical skill, a network of sub-
 sidies and regulation, planning and engi-
 neering.  More and more we will, have to
 turn problems over  to technicians,    equip
 them with authority, and provide the funds
 to do the job.  People are far more con-
 cerned with progress, with getting the job
 done, than they are with the ideology of
 change.  The technician-politician-the man
 who regardless of party can resolve complex
 problems-is the man of the future.
 Secondly, we will have to reshape the his-
 toric relationships of our federal structure
 so not to be completely dependent on Wash-
 ington                                                                                                                                   for  comfort, help and skill.   The
 problems are far too huge and varied to be
 solved from the top.  Moreover, to attempt

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE      September 20, 1966
 states of the chance to share In the solution
 of the great problems of society. It is essen-
 tial to our spiritual health to develop struc-
 tures which give people a chance to share
 in the American enterprise.  It is essential
 to our national progress that we tap the
 enormous resources of mind and energy which
 lie unused, ignored and unwanted through-
 out America.
 This means decentralization of govern-
 ment action; a decentralization which will
 take many forms and whose evolution is a
 challenge to our genius for political crea-
 tion.  Variety will be the hallmark of such
 a system, but I believe the basic pattern will
 be federal funds and guidelines with respon-
 sibility for action left to the community.
 For example, perhaps the best approach to
 the problem of our cities can be drawn from
 the theoretical patterns of foreign aid.  The
 federal government would require the city
 to develop a master plan of development
 embracing basic services, housing and all
 the comppnents of community life; provid-
 Ing federal funds on a large scale to carry
 the plan forward.  As another example I
 have proposed turning a large part of the
 foreign aid program over to the states, in-
 volving communities and citizens directly
 In our relationship with the underdeveloped
 continents.
 Even then individuals will have to fight
 City Hall; but it is far easier than fighting
 the White House.
 We are worlds away from the old debate
 about federal power and big government.
 For underneath the rhetoric that was a de-
 bate whether we should tackle social and
 economic problems at all;  or whether we
 should leave them to the impersonal work-
 ings of an unregulated society.  Today de-
 centralization assumes that many problems
 will yield to directed human intelligence;
 the question is how best to enlist the en-
 ergies of Americans in that task.  I have
 no doubt that citizen participation is the
 future direction of liberalism.  It will per-
 mit is to do a better job with our society.
 It will allow our people to share the life
 of the nation; to contribute, to work, to be
 needed and to be heard.  It is a key to sal-
 vation from the separation and human frus-
 tration which are a poisoning and unneces-
 sary by-product of our civilization.
 Thirdly, we who have often looked to
 Washington for protection of human rights
 must increase our guard against the coercive
 society.  It is the nature of power to resent
 opposition to its exercise.  That resentment
 Is multiplied as power grows.  When those
 who have such power are also convinced of
 the wisdom and beneficence of their views
 that freedom is In. danger.  The worst threat
 to liberty comes not from those who simply
 seek their own aggrandisement, but from
 those who seek the good of others, identify-
 Ing opposition to their desires with harm to
 the nation.  Already wiretapping, bugging,
 and manifold invasions of privacy are grow-
 Ing, I believe, far beyond the present knowl-
 edge of any of us.  There are laws in Con-
 gress to give the Secretary of State arbitrary
 power to limit the travel of Americans.  It
 has even been proposed that we draft all
 Americans-not simply to meet an imme-
 diate threat to our securiey-but as a matter
 of course.  All of these have In common the
 frightening belief that individual action and
 freedom should be limited for the good of
 the state? according to some officeholders'
 view of what that good requires.  That is the
 cause to enlist our energies, to bring us
 shouting into the streets against any who
 claim the right to tell us where to go, or
 listen to our private conversations, or pre-
 .scribe how we must serve our society.  The
 coercive society is no less obnoxious when
 coercion is masked in benevolence.
 These are tentative steps toward redefini-
 tions of difficult and shifting goals; but they
 are charged with a traditional faith in the
 capacity to reshape our society more to the
 needs of man.
 There is, however, another Issue which
 has  reduced  discussions  about  domestic
 America to academic discourse, Which has
 swallowed up the New Frontier and Great
 Society, and which is eroding our position
 throughout the world.   That issue is,  of
 course, the war in Vietnam.
 The Vietnamese war is, I believe, the
 most dangerous conflict since the end of
 World War II: more dangerous than Berlin
 or even Korea.  In those confrontations the
 danger was clear and sensibly appraised.
 The stakes were fairly obvious to both sides.
 Objectives were carefully limited; and power
 ultimately became the handmaiden of rea-
 son and final accommodation.  In Vietnam,
 on the other hand, the dangers are con-
 fused and unclear.  Objectives are expressed
 in vague generalities which open to endless
 vistas. Moreover, from other cold war con-
 frosttations there evolved a set of tacit un-
 derstandings designed to limit conflict even
 while it was being waged.  That,  for ex-
 ample,  Is  the  real  meaning;  of                                                                                         the  no-
 sanctuary  policy  carefully                                                                                            observed,   we
 should remember, by both sides.    Today
 those understandings are in grave danger of
 being swept away, and with them our most
 important protections against enlarging con-
 flict.
 The air is charged with rhetoric.  We are
 buried in statements and speeches  about
 negotiation and peace, the defense of free-
 dom and the dangers of communism, the
 desire  to  protect  the  helpless  and com-
 passion for the dying.                                                                                               Much of it is im-
 portant and sincere and well-meaning. Some
 is intended to deceive.   Some is deliberate
 lie and distortion.  But the important thing
 is not what we are saying, but what we are
 doing;  not  what  is  being  discussed, but
 what, is happening.
 And what is happening is not confusing
 or unclear or contradictory at  all.   It is
 not masked in obscurity or buried in secret
 archives.   It stands  in  clear,  vivid and
 towering relief against the landscape of con-
 flict.  The                                                                                           war  is  getting larger.   Every
 month there are more men in combat, more
 bombs falling, greater expenditures, deeper
 conunitments.  It is the steady inexorable
 course of this conflict since its beginning.
 We have gone to the United Nations' and
 the war has grown larger.  We have offered
 funds for development and talked of social
 reform; and the war has grown larger.  We
 have predicted victory and called for com-
 promise; and the war has grown larger.
 There is therefore, little escape from the
 conclusion that it will grow larger still.
 Nor is this steady pattern the consequence
 of inexorable historical forces.  It flows from
 the decisions of particular men in particular
 places-in Washington and Hanoi, in Saigon
 and in the jungle headquarters of the Viet-
 cong.  It is in part a product of communist
 hope and drive for victory; but it is partly
 our decision too.  And we must suppose those
 same decisions will continue to be made.
 Nor is this, as we are sometimes told, be-
 cause there is no alternative.   There  are
 dozens of alternatives.   There  are enclave
 programs, and programs to hold the centers
 of population.  There are suggestions that
 we rely on pacification of the countryside
 rather than the destruction of the Vietcong.
 There are proposals to limit the bombing or
 to end it.  There are proposals for negotia-
 tions, complete with all the specifics of pos-
 sible agreement.  The fact is the air is full
 of alternatives. They have simply been re-
 jected in favor of another course; the present
 course.  And we must also suppose they will
 continue to be rejected.
 All prophecy is an exercise in probability.
 With that caution let us try to strip the
 argument of its necessary passion and discuss
 the probabilities which are compelled by the
 awesome logic of the course of events in
 Vietnam.  Passion is important; it lies at the
 root of war and of hatred of war.  Nor do I
 lack personal feeling; for only the strongest
 of feelings could impel me to discuss a sub-
 ject with which I was so recently connected
 in so intimate a way.  Yet we can perhaps
 now meet more productively on the common
 ground of reason.   Rarely has there been
 greater need for such unity among men of
 good will.
 In other places I have set forth my personal
 views on the conduct of the war in South
 Vietnam: The belief that we have an im-
 portant stake in Southeast Asia, and that we
 must continue the battle in the South-al-
 though differently than we are now doing-
 until a political settlement is reached.  And
 I have, like many others, discussed alterna-
 tive routes to these objectives.  Today, how-
 ever, I would like to talk about the lengthen-
 ing shadow of the war in the North; for in
 that war are the swiftly germinating seeds
 of the most grave danger.
 In this, as in so many aspects of the war,
 much of the information which feeds judg-
 ment is deeply obscured. Of course, in times
 of armed conflict facts are often elusive and
 much information, of necessity, cannot be
 revealed.  By Its nature war is hostile to
 truth.  Yet with full allowance for neces-
 sary uncertainties I believe there has never
 been such intense and widespread deception
 and confusion as that which surrounds this
 war.  The continual downpour of contradic-
 tion,                                                                                                                                                  misstatements,  and  kaleidoscopically
 shifting attitudes has been so torrential that
 it has almost numbed the capacity to sep-
 arate truth from conjecture or falsehood.
 At one time we are told there is no mili-
 tary solution, and then that victory can be
 ours.
 There are months when we talk about ne-
 gotiations and months when we forget them.
 There are times when dissenters give aid
 and comfort to the enemy and times when
 they are acting in the greatest of our tradi-
 tions.
 We have been reassured about efforts to
 reach a peaceful settlement when there is no
 plan or program for settlement in existence.
 We are given endless statistics with a nu-
 merical precision which only masks the fact
 they are based on inadequate information,
 or guesses, or even wishful thinking.  For
 example, if we take the numbers of enemy
 we are supposed to be killing, add to that
 the  defectors,  along  with  a  number of
 wounded much less than our own ratio of
 wounded to killed, we find we are wiping out
 virtually the entire North Vietnamese force
 every year.  This  truly makes their  con-
 tinued resistance one of the marvels of the
 world.  Unless the figures are wrong, which
 of course they are.
 We are told the bombing is terribly costly
 to North Vietnam.    Yet the Increase in So-
 viet and Chinese aid, since the bombing, is
 far greater, in economic terms, than the loss
 through bombing.   Except in human life,
 the North Vietnamese are showing a profit.
 At the time of the Hanoi-Haiphong bomb-
 ings last June we were told that in the first
 six months of 1968 enemy truck movement
 had doubled, the infiltration of supplies was
 up 150%, and infiltrated personnel increased
 120%.  However, the fact is we do not know,
 except in the most vague and general way,
 how much supplies are being brought in or
 how many men.  They move at night, some-
 times on trails we have not yet discovered,
 and the best intelligence gives only the most
 vague picture. We could not only be wrong,
 but enormously wrong.  The swiftness with
 which we change our estimates helps show
 that seeming exactness conceals large uncer-
 tainties.
 The statements which followed the Hanoi-
 Haiphong bombings are an illuminating ex-
 ample of this process in action.
 It was said the raids would destroy a large
 proportion of North Vietnam's fuel capacity
 and this would help paralyze--or at least

 said that all concerned with the program

 agreement that George Eliopoulos should
 have this award because he made a dis-

 area of radiation research.
 Mr. Speaker, Springfield Technical
 High School has produced many out-

 a splendid example of the brilliant stu-
 dents at Springfield's Technical High
 School. He is a straight A student and
 is particularly strong in the fields of
 mathematics and science, which he in-

 on behalf of the people of the Second
 Congressional District of Massachusetts,
 I wish to commend George Eliopoulos
 and Springfield Technical High School
 for achieving this high honor and dis-

 he has exercised so arbitrarily in the
 past. I shall do this not because of any
 particular affinity for those who are be-
 latedly coming to the forefront and be-
 latedly getting disturbed about the ap-
 parent excesses of our chairman. I will
 not do this because of any personal opin-
 ions Chairman POWELL might properly
 have about "black power or racial con-
 cepts which affect education and labor.
 I will certainly not do this because he
 is a Negro.  I for one will vote to strip
 him of all powers as the chairman, or
 for any partial limitations on his power,
 because on the merits I believe they have
 been exercised in such a manner as to
 bring discredit to the entire House of
 Representatives.
 Later today I will again address the
 House and place in the RECORD many of
 the reasons I have for taking this action.
 For now, I merely want to announce that,
 as one Member, I will vote to take Mr.
 POWELL's committee chairman's power
 away.
 THE  HONORABLE  SAM  GIBBONS
 (Mr. OLSON of Minnesota asked and
 was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute and to revise and
 extend his remarks.)
 Mr.  OLSON  of  Minnesota. Mr.
 Speaker, recently one of our distin-
 guished colleagues was verbally accosted
 by another Member and referred to as a
 "jerk."
 SAM GIBBONS' record speaks for itself
 and does not need my defense. His rec-
 ord of devotion to duty and responsibil-
 ity, as a Members of this body, adequate-
 ly reflect SAM GIBBONS' character.
 Most people in public life are familiar
 with the tactic of vilification and abuse
 and surely Members of this House can
 recognize these tactics for what they are.
 I rise because, as I feel a responsibil-
 ity to uphold the integrity of my Govern-
 ment and my office back home, I am even
 more aware of this responsibility here
 in this House.
 I do not believe any Member of Con-
 gress with a record like that of SAM
 GIBBONS should be attacked without our
 rising to his defense.  I have taken part
 in the defense of other Members of this
 body when they were irresponsibly at-
 tacked.
 An attempt to make civil rights a
 question as far as SAM GIBBONS' record is
 concerned is irresponsible.  During the
 debate in July of 1966 " on the Civil
 Rights Act of 1966, the RECORD will show
 that SAM GIBBONS was voting and pres-
 ent for the entire debate on that Civil
 Rights Act which lasted for over 2 weeks.
 Congress is largely responsible for po-
 licing the activities of its own Members.
 This can only be achieved if we resolve
 our differences without demeaning the
 character of this body or its individual
 Members.

 Mr. HALL.  Mr. Speaker, I certainly
 commend the Members of the House Ap-
 propriations Committee for its action in
 reducing the administration's foreign
 aid request by almost $300 million.  A
 review of the committee's report never-

 trimmed, considering the present state
 of our economy.

 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I
 pointed out that there have been a num-
 ber of provocative recent pronounce-
 ments on Vietnam.  Unhappily, they
 have emanated not from the administra-
 tion, but from the university community,
 where many former members of the ad-
 ministration reside.
 One of the most sensible recent com-
 mentaries on the war is the speech which
 Richard N. Goodwin, former assistant to
 President Kennedy and President John-
 son, made to the national board of the
 Americans for Democratic Action on
 Saturday, September 17.
 Perhaps the most noteworthy of Good-
 win's comments-which ranged from do-
 mestic to foreign affairs-was his sug-
 gestion that concerned citizens form a
 committee to oppose further escalation
 of the war. He points out that the slo-
 gan of such a group could be the slogan
 of the Democratic Party in the 1964
 campaign: "No wider war."
 I hope that Goodwin's remarks will be
 read by as wide an audience as they de-
 serve. His speech follows:

 The Chaplain, Rev. Edward G. Latch,
 D.D., offered the following prayer:
 Great is our Lord and of great power:
 His understanding is infinite.-Psalm
 147: 5.
 0 God, our Father, who dost reveal
 Thyself in numberless ways, deepen
 within us this day the sense of Thy pres-
 ence as we wait upon Thee in prayer.
 Strengthen us by Thy spirit that no dan-
 ger may overwhelm us, no difficulty may
 overcome us, no distress may overburden
 us, and no discouragement may cause us
 to turn aside from walking with Thee.
 May Thy grace sustain us in our labor,
 Thy hand uphold us when we fall, Thy
 joy make our hearts glad, and Thy pres-
 ence give us courage to face the experi-
 ences of this hour unashamed and un-
 afraid.  Help us to grow in strength, in
 understanding, in never-ending good
 will; and may we ever commit our lives
 to goals great enough for freemen.  In
 the Master's name we pray.  Amen.

 fenses, and started the Alliance for Progress
 because what began as dissent became na-
 tional purpose.)   Of course the enemy is
 glad to see our divisions.  But our concern
 is with America not Hanoi.  Our concern is
 with those millions of our own people, and
 with future generations, who will themselves
 be glad to see that there were men who
 struggled to prevent needless devastation
 and thus added to the strength and the glory
 of the United States.
 Among the greatest names in our history
 were men who did not hesitate to assault
 the acts and policies of government when
 they felt the good of the nation was at stake:
 Jefferson at a time when the integrity of
 the new nation was still in doubt, Lincoln
 during the Mexican war, Roosevelt, in the
 midst of national depression, John F. Ken-
 nedy among cold war defeats and danger.
 Only a dozen years ago, In 1954, another
 American leader assaulted our policy in Viet-
 nam, saying "The United States is in clear
 danger of being left  naked and alone in a
 hostile world ... It is apparent only that
 American foreign  policy has never in all its
 history suffered such a stunning reversal.
 What Is American policy in Indochina?  All
 of us have listened to the dismal themes of
 reversal and confusions and alarms and ex-
 cursions which have emerged from Washing-
 ton . . . We have been caught bluffing by
 our enemies.  Our friends and allies are
 frightened and wondering, as we do, where
 we are headed ... The picture of our coun-
 try needlessly weakened in the world today
 is so painful that we should turn our eyes
 from abroad and look homewards."
 It is in this same spirit of concern for our
 country that we should conduct our dissent
 as, on that day, did Lyndon B. Johnson then
 leader of the minority party.
 It is not our privilege, but our duty as
 patriots, to write, to speak, to organize, to
 oppose any President and any party and any
 policy at any time which we believe threatens
 the grandeur of this nation and the well-
 being of its people.  This is  such a time.
 And in so doing we will fulfill the most
 solemn duty of free men in a free country:
 to fight to the limit of legal sanction and the
 most spacious possibilities of our constitu-
 tional freedoms for the safety and greatness
 of their country as they believe it to be.
 The arguments of this speech have been
 practical ones founded, to the limits of my
 capacity and knowledge, upon the concrete
 and specific realities and dangers of our pres-
 ent situation.  But there is more than that
 In the liberal faith.  American. liberalism
 has many faces. It pursues divergent paths
 to varied and sometimes conflicting goals.
 It cannot be captured in an epigram or sum-
 marized in a simple statement of belief.
 Part of it however is sim 1  and       I
 calculations of economists and generals. Our
 strength is in our spirit and our faith.  If
 we neglect this we may empty our treas-
 uries, assemble our armies and pour forth
 the wonders of our science, but we will act in
 vain and we will build for others.
 It is easy to be tough when toughness
 means coercing the weak or rewarding the
 strong; and when men of power and influ-
 ence stand ready to applaud.  It is far harder
 to hold to principle, speaking, if necessary,
 alone against the multitude, allowing others
 to make their own mistakes, enduring the
 frustration of long and inconclusive strug-
 gles, and standing firm for ideals even when
 they bring danger.  But it is the true path
 of courage.  It is the only path of wisdom.
 And it is the sure path of effective service
 to the United States of America.
 CORRECTION OF THE RECORD

 To the Congress of the United States:
 This is the 10th annual report on the
 trade agreements program, as required
 by section 402(a) of the Trade Ekpan-
 sion Act of 1962.  It covers calendar year
 1965.
 World trade in 1965 surpassed all pre-
 vious levels, enriching the lives of peoples
 around the globe.  Record levels of U.S.
 foreign trade contributed greatly to this
 advance, and the American people shared
 fully in its benefits.
 However, the successes of 1965 also
 served to dramatize the vast unrealized
 potential of the world market and the
 importance of moving forward with the
 Kennedy round of tariff negotiations, the
 great multilateral endeavor to generate
 more rapid growth in trade.  Recently,
 the pace of these talks has intensified.
 The major participants have shown re-
 newed determination to conclude an
 agreement.  The United States will con-
 tinue to exert every effort to assure that
 these negotiations yield extensive reduc-
 tions in restraints on trade in all classes.
 of goods, including agricultural products.
 The steady growth and freer flow of
 world trade are essential to full pros-
 perity at home, economic growth and
 stability in the industrialized countries,
 and progress in the developing world.
 We shall do everything in our power to
 build In future years on the substantial
 progress in these directions achieved in
 1965.

 the people of the United States-the
 casualties which have occurred in all of
 our districts, including my own-into
 the arena of partisan politics. I say that
 this type of attack upon the policy of
 the United States is a pretty weak at-
 tack.  It offers no alternative except a
 blue ribbon committee.
 We had about 75 or 80 blue ribbon
 committees during the regime of Presi-
 dent Eisenhower, and they studied every
 subject to death.
 The war over there is not going to be
 fought by a blue ribbon committee.  It
 is going to be fought by men, by Ameri-
 can soldiers and allied soldiers who are
 willing to go in and fight and to lose their
 lives, if necessary, to stop the onrushing
 tide of communism and to protect free-
 dom and liberty in the world. There is
 no place for a blue ribbon committee in
 Vietnam.                        f A I;
 HISTORICAL RECORD OF POSITION
 IN VIETNAM
 (Mr. GOODELL asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. GOODELL.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 surprised and I must say amazed by the
 comments of my colleagues with refer-
 ence to this paper. All I can say is that
 at least one of the gentlemen who pre-
 ceded me admitted he had not read the
 paper yet.  I would say the comments
 indicate that none of these Members
 have read this paper.  I believe they
 should read it.
 We issued a scholarly white paper in
 August of 1965, which detailed step by
 step the progression of involvement in
 southeast Asia.  This is an updating of
 that paper.
 If the gentlemen have facts to disagree
 with, with reference to the historical rec-
 ord that is recited in this paper, name
 them and come forward, but do not come
 up and accuse us of making a partisan
 document, when we have presented a
 scholarly paper that recites the commit-
 ments which have been made, the de-
 teriorating situation that has existed, and
 the failure to give the ?American people
 the full story as to our commitments.
 This is the purpose of the paper-to
 give a perspective to the American peo-
 ple and the Congress of the United States
 as to where we stand today, so that we
 can make realistic decisions as to what
 the alternatives are for the future. This
 white paper does not make partisan rec-
 ommendations or oversimplify serious is-
 sues.  That is exactly why we make no
 specific recommendations for the future.
 We present it as a scholarly docu ent
 showing the perspective of our position
 (Mr. PEPPER asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute.)
 Mr. PEPPER. Mr. Speaker, we are all
 Americans and however we may differ
 about the best way to serve our country,
 all of us are conscientious in the dis-
 charge of our patriotic duty as we see it.
 However, today it would seem to me that
 the critical nature of the crisis which we
 face makes it necessary that all of us not
 only consider the sincerity of our utter-
 ances but how they may be interpreted
 by those who are the enemies of our
 country and of democracy and freedom in
 the world today.
 I am sure that the opposing party, the
 Republican Party, under no circum-
 stances could embrace the idea or the
 thought of giving encouragement to
 Hanoi to withhold any disposition to-
 ward conciliation that might bring this
 terrible war to an end.  However, the
 question is, Will Hanoi interpret the Re-
 publican document as presenting the
 issue of whether the country supports the
 President in continuing the Vietnam war
 until an honorable peace may be ob-
 tained as an issue that is to be decided in
 the coming election between the two
 major political parties of the United
 States?  Will that pamphlet and such
 utterances and such declarations give
 encouragement to Hanoi, no matter that
 it is not intended by the authors of it, to
 withhold any disposition to negotiate
 and thus let more Americans be killed
 perhaps between now and the time after
 the election? What is more logical than
 that such a document can give, however
 it may not be intended by the authors,
 encouragement to those on the other side
 that maybe, at long last, if they will hold
 out, the American people will repudiate
 our President and our policy and then
 they will win their evil end with t e
 help of the people of the United State?
 REPUBLICAN RESEARCH AND MAN-
 NING COMMITTEE PAPER
 (Mr. LAIRD asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute.)
 Mr. LAIRD.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in
 support of the white paper published
 by the research and planning committee
 of the Republican conference, under the
 leadership of the gentleman from New
 York [Mr.  GOODELL].   This scholarly
 paper is nothing more and nothing less
 than a factual account of the involve-
 ment of the United States of America
 in Vietnam. I think it ill behooves the
 gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Bocos]
 and the gentleman from Texas [Mr.
 MAHON], on the other side of the aisle,
 to quarrel with this document which is
 documented and footnoted as to every
 statement.  The gentleman from Texas
 criticizes and in the next breath admits
 he has never read the document.  I re-
 mind these two gentlemen that it has not
 been the minority party in this House of
 Representatives that has given aid and
 comfort to the enemy as far as the war in
 Vietnam Is concerned; it has been the
 Democratic majority in this Congress
 both in the other body and here that have
 caused the North Vietnamese and the
 Communists to question the credibility
 and the intent of the United States of
 America In the prosecution of this war.
 We have given the President of the
 United States support on our side of the
 aisle because our country is involved and
 because the flag of the United States is
 involved.  We have put our country
 above party.  But the division which
 exists in the Democratic Party has pro
 22295
 longed the war in Vietnam.  The divi-
 sion, the deep division, within the Demo-
 cratic Party in this Congress has proven
 beyond a question of a doubt that this
 party does not deserve leadership today
 as it cannot unite its members behind the
 President of the United States.  This
 paper, my friends, does not do anything
 to withdraw the support of the minority
 party to defend against Communist ag-
 gression any place in the world.  I urge
 all of you: Read this report.  And I cau-
 tion the Members on the other side of
 the aisle about throwing stones at our
 house when you have such a divided
 house on your side of the aisle.
 Mr. Speaker, the American people are
 a people that would do anything to bring
 about a lasting peace in the world. Yet,
 there is no question that American serv-
 icemen are fighting and dying again in
 a far-off place and many of our citizens
 are not sure why. Our objectives in Viet-
 nam-long-term and short-range-have
 never been clearly spelled out by our
 President.  His spokesmen-from Vice
 President to press secretary, from Secre-
 tary of State to Secretary of Defense-
 have issued conflicting statements of
 what our purpose is, of what our pros-
 pects are, of what our accomplishments
 have been.
 Mr. Speaker, ours is a nation at war
 and for the first time in memory and
 probably in history, our President ap-
 pears unable to unite his own party-
 much less the country-behind the war
 effort.  This in itself is an underlying
 cause of the Communists' refusal to ne-
 gotiate. So long as they believe that our
 country is torn by internal dissension,
 they will continue to hope that this dis-
 sension eventually will cause the United
 States to dishonor its commitment in
 Vietnam. As long as this belief persists,
 the possibility of a negotiated settlement
 will remain remote.
 This is an issue in 1966.  It was not
 made an issue by Republicans and it
 needs no assist from Republicans to re-
 main an issue. It is, after all, a fact of
 life that a political party in power that
 cannot by its leadership rally its own
 people behind the country's cause in time
 of war cannot expect, does not deserve,
 and probably will not receive a vote of
 confidence from a majority of the Ameri-
 can people of whatever political persua-
 sion.
 I repeat, this is not an issue created
 by Republicans.  In fact, Republicans
 have gone the extra step in supporting
 our fighting forces In Vietnam-for to
 do otherwise in our view would con-
 tribute to a prolongation of the war and
 the possibility of a miscalculation on the
 part of the enemy.
 It remains, however, an issue to a ma-
 jority of Americans and a legitimate one.
 It is legitimate because those who seek
 political power and the mantle of leader-
 ship must, when they obtain it, demon-
 strate to those who have bestowed it
 the ability to use it wisely and well. The
 conduct of the war in Vietnam will be
 judged by the American people in these
 terms.  If the people find the present
 leadership lacking, they will register this
 finding at the polls.
 Perhaps the greatest concern in the
 minds and hearts of Americans about

 accused of a number of violations of
 House Rules. Why are they not investi-
 gated? It is rumored that Mr. POWELL'S
 wife gave him a power of attorney to
 sign checks. Is this true? A House rule
 apparently makes it illegal for Mrs.
 Powell to be paid for work in Puerto Rico.
 Why does the Democratic leadership not
 do something about this?  Are the so-
 called reformers not saying "Let us not
 investigate charges against Mr. POWELL,
 let us just dethrone him and sweep the
 whole mess under the carpet"?
 Third, and most important of all, Why
 are we not talking about real reform?
 Why do we not consider electing com-
 mittee chairmen from the top three rank-
 ing members of the majority?  Why do
 we not forbid hiring of relatives-many
 of us, including myself, have bills in-
 troduced on this subject which are be-
 fore committee but we cannot get a
 hearing-or why do we not at least forbid
 the hiring of wives of Congressmen?
 Mr. Speaker, it would appear that some
 Democratic members of the committee
 want to deal With their political prob-
 lem, which is Mr. POWELL, rather than
 deal with the real problem of adopting
 stringent rules of ethics for Members of
 Congress.  With perhaps a few excep-
 tions, Members of Congress are ethical
 and honest. We are all being discredited
 but not just by the actions of one man.
 We are being tainted, and rightly so I
 believe, by our unwillingness to enforce
 the highest ethical standards on all of
 our Members.  The blame for this must
 necessarily be placed at the door of the
 Democratic majority which has the clear
 duty to act and has refused to.
 There is a decided possibility that
 things are getting too hot on the other
 side of the aisle so our Thursday morn-
 ing vote will be put aside or this mo-
 tion will not be offered. The Democratic
 leadership should cooperate with this
 move by Education and Labor Commit-
 tee Democrats.  Were this effort, half-
 hearted though it is, to fizzle now the
 American people would once again be
 confronted with the callous disregard of
 the Congress for doing the right thing.
 This must necessarily reflect on the
 Democratic leadership of this body.
 Time and time again we see examples of
 laws and standards which are rigidly ap-
 plied to the general public but then are
 not equally applied to Members of Con-
 gress.        If the Democrats do not follow
 through on this proposal they will most
 certainly be enhancing the growing feel-
 ing in America for disrespect of law and
 order. All too many people have reason
 to believe that the old advice to a Con-
 gressman that "to get along you must
 go along" rules our conduct here. For-
 tunately, we do not have to "go along"
 and I for one will not, even if it means
 joining those who may have been re-
 luctant or negligent in the past or may
 have curious motives now.
 I am confident Republicans will join
 any movement for true reform. Several
 weeks ago our minority leader called for
 a full investigation of the allegations
 against Mr. POWELL.` Many are hesitant
 to join the reluctant reformers who have
 soiled hands themselves in terms of pro-
 tecting minority rights. They seem to be
 saying,  "Let's  not  investigate  facts.
 That might involve other Members of
 Congress and require modernizing of
 House rules generally.  Let's just punish
 POWELL.   He's  vulnerable." Because
 "black power" has been mentioned by
 these so-called reformers, they have un-
 fortunately mixed racism with reform
 that should include all Members of the
 House. Yet after all of these arguments
 have been made, we still have one clear
 duty-strip Congressman POWELL of   e
 power which, on the merits, he has 1st
 the right to exercise by his own ac1Tig s

 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from New York [Mr. GOODELL] is
 recognized for 60 minutes.
 Mr. GOODELL. Mr. Speaker, on Au-
 gust 25, 1965, the planning and research
 committee of the House Republican
 conference  issued  a  white  paper  on
 Vietnam.  At that time I said the pur-
 pose of the report was to present a clear
 perspective on the past in order that
 right decisions might be made in the
 future.
 More than 12 months have passed.
 The Vietnam conflict has now become
 the third largest war in U.S. history.
 Again, in order to keep the perspective
 clear, an updated version of last year's
 study is being issued today.  It is enti-
 tled "The United States and the War in
 Vietnam."  It is factual and scholarly.
 I have requested that the report, along
 with statements made by the gentleman
 from Michigan [Mr. FORD], the gentle-
 man from Wisconsin [Mr. LAIRD], and
 myself at this morning's press confer-
 ence, be inserted in the RECORD at this
 point.

 One year ago the Committee on Planning
 and Research of the Republican Conference
 of the House of Representatives issued  a
 study  entitled  "Vietnam:  Some Neglected
 Aspects of the Historical Record."
 This revised and updated edition of the
 study has been prepared to take account of
 the drastic change in the role of the United
 States in the conflict in the past year.  It is
 being issued at the time when the size of the
 American troop commitment to Vietnam has
 reached the  maximum level  of American
 troop strength committed in Korea in the
 1950's, when the war in Vietnam is on the
 verge of becoming the third biggest war in
 our nation's history, and as the flames of war
 are spreading ominously Into Thailand.
 The study has been revised to take into
 account these significant developments as
 well as the Administration's revision during
 the past year of its explanation of American
 involvement in Vietnam,  emphasizing the
 SEATO Agreement as the reason for its pres-
 ent actions in Vietnam.
 The purpose of this new edition is the
 same as that of the original report-to show
 how the nation arrived at the present crisis
 and to evaluate past policy.  A clear perspec-
 tive on the past helps toward making the
 right decisions in the future.

 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
 The involvement of the United States In
 Vietnam after World War II began with the
 decision of the Truman Administration to
 provide economic and military aid in May
 1950.1
 A fragile peace was brought to Vietnam by
 the Geneva Agreements of 1954, partitioning
 Vietnam into a Communist North and a non-
 Communist South. Contrary to most expec-
 tations, South Vietnam survived.  Indeed,
 with generous aid from the United States, it
 achieved what the late President John F.
 Kennedy called a near miracle between 1954
 and 1960.  Secretary McNamara spoke of the
 history of South Vietnam in this period as a
 "success story."
 When  President  Eisenhower  left  office,
 there was no crisis in South Vietnam. There
 were problems, arising particularly from a
 renewal of sporadic guerrilla activity by the
 Vietcong.  The dimensions of the problems
 then compared with the present situation
 can be gauged from these facts:
 1. In  1960,  there  were  fewer  than  700
 American   military personnel  stationed in
 South Vietnam to train South Vietnamese;
 today (late August 1966) 300,000 American
 troops are there to fight.
 2. In 1960, there were 5,000-6,000 Vietcong
 regulars in South Vietnam; today 282,000
 enemy troops are there .2
 3. In 1960, no Americans had been killed
 in combat; as of August 20, 1966, 4,832 have
 been killed and almost 27,000 have been
 wounded, taken prisoner or are missing.
 4. In 1960, and in 1962, more than 80 per
 cent of the land area of South Vietnam was
 under the control of the South Vietnamese
 Government; today it is about 30 per cent
 or less.
 5. In 1960, the cost of aiding South Viet-
 nam to the United States was $250 million-
 72 per cent of it economic aid; as of the
 'The State Department has issued three
 useful documents on Vietnam:

 cation 7308, December 1961) referred to here-
 in                                                                                                                           as  "A  Threat";  "Aggression  from  the

 in Korea and who are continuing to give
 their lives in Vietnam to repel Commu-
 nist aggression.            It would represent an
 overwhelming diplomatic victory for the
 Communist' regime and would result In a
 label of legitimacy for an outlaw govern-
 ment.
 Let us make no mistake about it.  If
 Red China is rewarded for its crimes
 against humanity by receiving recogni-
 tion in the U.N., it will further impose its
 obstreperous demands with respect to
 expelling th representatives of the Gov-
 ernment of the Republic of China from
 the U.N.  In addition, such action will
 forever destroy the hopes of the Chinese
 people that their nation. can be liberated
 from the Communist oppressors.
 I am aware that the foreign aid appro-
 priations bill contains a separate provi-
 sion reaffirming the position of Congress
 that the United States will continue to
 oppose the seating of Red China in the
 U.N.  But, we must go further than reit-
 erating this position.  We should by sep-
 arate action spotlight this feature of the
 bill by adopting a resolution that would
 put this body unqualifiedly on record as
 opposing any move to give membership to
 Red China in the U.N.
 In this regard I am today introducing
 a resolution setting forth the reasons
 why we should fight any move to seat
 Red China, and I would like to invite
 my colleagues to introduce comparable
 resolutions.  Our colleague in the Sen-
 ate, the senior Senator from South Caro-
 lina, is also introducing such a resolution
 today.
 The position of Congress should be
 unalterable in this matter,  Since 1951,
 Congress has passed on some 20 occasions
 various resolutions opposing the admis-
 sion of Communist China to the United
 Nations, and yet there are some who ar-
 gue that these resolutions are no longer
 in effect.  Let us remove all doubt as to
 the intent of Congress regarding this
 matter.     We have an obligation to the
 freedom-loving people of this Nation and
 to our allies who have stood by us in
 opposing the admission of Red China to
 support this resolution with unremitting
 firmness.
 TRUTH IN LENDING
 The     SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.
 OISEN of Montana).    Under previous
 order of the House, the gentleman from
 New 'stork [Mr, HALPERN] is recognized
 for 10 minutes.
 Mr. HALPERN.     Mr. Speaker, it is
 lamentable that the Congress has not
 yet enacted legislation to protect bor-
 rowers pf money from misleading and
 inadequate disclosure of credit terms.
 For several years now, I have been
 privileged to cosponsor the so-called
 truth-in-lending bill, pioneered by Sen-
 ator PAUL DOUGLAS, of Illinois.
 This legislation is urgently needed to
 protect consumers against loan sharks
 and conscious or unwitting deception in
 credit transactions.  The basic purpose
 is to require that anyone who lends
 money or extends credit must supply the
 consumer with two essential facts: a
 statement of the total finance charge in
 dollars and cents, and secondly, a state-
 ment of the true annual rate of interest
 on the unpaid balance of the loan.
 The object of the bill 1s to provide all
 borrowers, and all those who buy on an
 installment plan, with a full accounting
 of the terms of the obligation, in dollar-
 and-cents language. Too often, we find
 that buyers are confronted with confus
 ing sets of finance charges which are all
 but impossible  to comprehend.  The
 Senate has collected volumes of testi-
 mony pointing to the need for accurate
 and  intelligible  disclosure  of credit
 charges on time buying.
 The Department of Defense, in May of
 this year, issued a directive which, in ef-
 fect, applies the bill's disclosure require-
 ments to all commercial credit enter-
 prises located on military bases.
 The Department also stated that the
 military services would no longer be re-
 sponsible in assisting in the collection of
 servicemen's debts unless the loan com-
 panies concerned complied with the di-
 rective.
 Today interest rates have soared, to
 such an extent that the homebuilding
 industry is in acute distress.  Interest
 rate policy inevitably affects the 'indi-
 vidual borrower eventually, as well as
 those who buy on credit.
 However, consumer debt continues to
 rise. July figures show that outstanding
 consumer credit rose to an alltime high
 of $90.7 billion, compared to $87 billion
 last April.  The trend will continue up-
 ward, although money is very tight, and
 this situation underlines the urgency of
 providing  effective  safeguards  against
 loan sharks and misleading installment
 terms.
 Certainly the House should move to
 consider this important legislation.   It
 is time that Congress acted to protect all
 consumers by insuring that they be sup-
 plied. with a full accounting of all in-
 terest charges when borrowing money or
 buying on an installment plan.

 Mr. ASHBROOK.  Mr. Speaker, I for
 one will vote to strip Chairman ADAM
 CLAYTON POWELL of the powers he has
 so arbitrarily misused in the past. I will
 do this not because of any particular
 affinity for those who are belatedly com-
 ing to the forefront in this battle and be-
 latedly getting disturbed about the ap-
 parent excesses of our committee chair-
 man. I will not do this because he flouts
 the legal order of New York courts.  I
 will not do this because of any personal
 opinions Chairman POWELL might prop-
 erly :have about "black power" or racial
 concepts which affect education and
 labor. I most certainly will not do it be-
 cause he is a Negro.
 I for one will vote to strip him. of all
 powers or for any partial limitations on
 his powers because, on the merits, he
 has exercised them in such a manner as
 to bring discredit on the entire House of
 Representatives.  Time and time again,
 as I have pointed out before, Mr. POWELL
 merely states that he is doing what every
 other Member of Congress does and he
 will not be a second-class Congressman.
 To sully our reputations along with his
 is to do great harm to the legislative
 branch of our Federal Government.  I
 will vote for restricting his powers be-
 cause, on the merits, I believe the
 seniority system should not be so blind
 as to accommodate the flagrant excesses
 and abuses of our chairman which are
 of record and which I have repeatedly
 pointed out since 1961.
 It is argued by some that the Powell
 problem is peculiarly the problem and
 burden of the Democratic Party.  This
 is partially true.  Were there a Repub-
 lican dominated Congress, Mr. POWELL
 would be minority leader and probably
 spend even more time in Puerto Rico or
 away from these Halls.  This would be
 the obvious answer to the. Powell prob-
 lem. The people can ultimately accom-
 plish this reform but it does not divest
 us of the immediate responsibilities we
 have.
 Credibility to the argument that this
 is a problem of Democratic Party house-
 cleaning is given by their 1965 actions.
 The Democrats did not hesitate to strip
 Representative JOHN BELL WILLIAMS Of
 his seniority last year because of Mr.
 WILLIAMS' support of the 1964 Republi-
 can presidential candidate.  Again, we
 see a curious double standard.  Mr.
 POWELL supported President Eisenhower
 in 1956 and his actions since that time
 have surely brought more injury to
 their party than did Mr. WILLIAMS' ef-
 forts on behalf of Mr. Goldwater.
 Yet, he is also our problem and Repub-
 licans cannot shirk from their respon-
 sibilities merely because the Democrats
 choose to shun theirs.  The record of the
 Congress has been one of majority party
 indifference to this type of questionable
 conduct. Will they now add Mr. POWELL
 to this same list of glaring omissions in
 their clear duty to the American people
 to act?  Several points should be con-
 sidered carefully by the Congress and the
 American people.
 First, among the so-called reformers
 who are now out to get Mr. POWELL are
 those who have out-Powelled POWELL in
 gaveling down Republicans who want
 fair and open hearings on vital national
 questions.   They are the same people
 who stood by while Mr. POWELL used his
 position to accomplish an ungentlemanly
 discourtesy to one of our distinguished
 Members of the fairer sex, Representa-
 tive EDITH GREEN. In the heat of debate
 last year he moved to close debate "right
 now" while she was on her feet and
 seeking to be recognized to speak against
 portions of the bill over which he was
 the floor leader.  They stood by then,
 smiling, and they have stood by through
 all of the sins of omission and commis-
 sion in the past until now they sound an
 uncertain trumpet to rally an army to
 overthrow a tyrant.  Their unexplained
 tardiness in rising to duty in the past
 detracts from any luster that might be
 due them for now making this effort
 which is entirely in order and urgently
 needed.
 Second, our chairman has been openly

 to pour in unlimited manpower, would mean
 that we would face a situation which would
 be more difficult than even that encountered
 in Korea.  It seems to me it would be a, hope-
 less situation." 10
 Senator Estes Kefauver had this to say:
 "But if the decision is to be made to inter-
 vene, I say this Nation needs more than the
 help of Great Britain, of Australia, of New
 Zealand, and of France.  It must have the
 moral and physical support, in addition to
 the Philippines and Thailand, of Burma, In-
 donesia, Ceylon, Pakistan, and if not the
 help, at least the understanding of India." '
 Senator HuBERT HUMPHREY said, "We have
 had our bluff called two or three times in the
 last  month.   We  have  been  defeated  at
 Geneva."  Somewhat illogically, since he op-
 posed military intervention by the United
 States, Senator HUMPHREY attributed the de-
 feat at Geneva to cuts made by the :Eisen-
 hower administration in the defense budget.-'1
 The critics were not in agreement on the
 basis for their attacks on the administration.
 Adlai Stevenson thought the United States
 was too rigid and inflexible in negotiations.-1
 MIKE MANSFIELD thought the United States
 should not have negotiated at all but should
 have stayed away from the Geneva  Con-
 ference,23 ignoring the fact that such pro-
 visions as that permitting Vietnamese who
 wished to escape Communist control to move
 to South Vietnam were the result of the bar-
 gaining effort of the representatives of this
 Nation.
 Finally, the critics undermined their case
 by conceding that the war in Indochina was
 lost because of French colonialism and not
 because of anything the United States did
 or failed to do.  Adlal Stevenson made the
 point when he declared, "Had France 11 * *
 granted  genuine independence in orderly,
 sincere stages to Vietnam, there very likely
 would have been no war in Indochina."
 The disputed election of 1956
 The final declaration issued at Geneva in
 1954 (subscribed to by neither the United
 States nor South Vietnam)  called for free
 elections to unify all of Vietnam in 1956
 .
 Recently Senator FuLBRIGHT and others have
 deplored the fact that the election was not
 held.
 At Geneva the representatives of what was
 to  be  South  Vietnam  "vainly  protested
 against the partition of the country and
 against the principle  of general elections
 being agreed upon when more than half of
 the voters would be north of the 17th par-
 allel.                                                                                                                                     It vainly asked that the whole terri-

 control of the United Nations until the re-
 establishment of peace and security would
 permit the holding of really free general
 elections." 22
 The reasons for the refusal of South Viet-
 nam to acquiesce in the holding of the elec-
 tion were stated by Prime Minister Diem on
 July 16,1955:
 "We did not sign the Geneva agreements.
 We are not bound in any way by these agree-.
 ments entered into against the will of the
 Vietnamese people..  Our policy is a policy of
 peace, but nothing will divert us from our
 goal: the unity of our country-a unity in
 freedom and not in slavery.
 "We do not reject the principle of elec-
 tions as a peaceful and democratic means
 to achieve unity.  But elections can be one
 of the foundations of true democracy only
 on the condition that they are absolutely
 free.  And we shall be skeptical about the
 possibility  of  achieving  the conditions  of
 free elections in the north under the regime
 of oppression carried on by the Vietminh." 25
 There was clearly no legal obligation on
 the Government of South Vietnam to abide
 by the terms of the final declaration. The
 position  of South Vietnam on this point
 was sustained by the United Kingdom, one
 of the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference,
 in the following statement:
 "Her Majesty's government has always re-
 garded it as desirable that these elections
 should be held and has advised the Gov-
 ernment of the Republic of Vietnam to en-
 ter into consultations with the Vietminh
 authorities in order to insure that all the
 necessary conditions obtained for a free ex-
 pression of the national will as a preliminary
 to holding free general elections by secret
 ballot.  Nevertheless, Her Majesty's govern-
 ment does not agree that (South Vietnam)
 'is legally obliged to follow the course: * * *
 It may be recalled that at the final ses-
 sion           of the          Geneva Conference on  Indo-
 china *  *  * the Vietnamese Government
 formally protested 'against the hasty con-
 clusions of the Armistice Agreements by.the
 French and Vietminh high commands only'
 * * * and 'against `the fact that the French
 high command was pleased to take the right,
 without a preliminary agreement of the dele-
 gation of (South Vietnam), to set the date
 of future elections.' Among the staunchest opponents of the
 holding of the 1956 election was Senator
 John F. Kennedy, of Massachusetts.  He is-
 sued "a plea that the United States never
 give its approval to the early nationwide elec-
 tions called for by the Geneva Agreement of
 1954.  Neither the United States nor free
 Vietnam was a party to that agreement-
 and neither the United States nor free Viet-
 nam is ever going to be a party to an elec-
 tion obviously stacked and subverted in ad-
 vance, urged upon us by those who have al-
 ready broken their own pledges under the
 agreement they now seek to enforce." 27
 Even Hans Morgenthau spoke against ac-
 tion to carry out the provisions of the Geneva
 declaration relating to elections:
 "Free elections are very subtle instruments
 which require a dedication to certain moral
 values and the existence of certain moral
 conditions which are by no means prevalent
 throughout  the  world,  and  certainly  not
 prevalent in either North or South Viet-
 nam;" 28

 Conditions in South Vietnam, 1954-60
 As South Vietnam began its existence, the
 prospects for its survival were minimal.  In-
 dependence was thrust upon a people with-
 out political experience and without political
 leadership. It had no sense of nationhood.
 It had no industry.  And, by the Geneva
 declaration, it seemed doomed to being swal-
 lowed up by the Communist rulers of North
 Vietnam in 2 years.
 Some of the difficulties facing the newly
 selected Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem were
 outlined by one observer in these words:
 "The circumstances under which the man
 came to power were unbelievable.  He faced
 the opposition of the Communists * * * he
 also had to deal with the open hostility of
 French miiltary men and the remnants of
 the French colonial service, who regarded
 him as anti-French, and who expected him to
 last only a few weeks at the most.  Then, as
 a consequence of a provision of the Geneva
 accords, authorizing free movement between
 the north and south zones for a limited pe-
 riod, more than 850,000 refugees came into
 South Vietnam from the Communist North
 Vietnam during the next 300 days, to be
 fed, clothed, and housed.  In addition, he
 found that his 'full powers, civil and mili-
 tary,' an extraordinary grant which Bao Dal
 had conceded him as a condition of his ac-
 ceptance  of  office,  existed  principally  on
 paper." 2?
 Yet when the Eisenhower administration
 left office, South Vietnam had a stable and
 established government.
 Senator John F. Kennedy called the devel-
 opment  "a  near  miracle."  In  his  book,
 "Strategy of Peace," published in 1960, he
 said:
 "In what everyone thought was the hour of
 total Communist triumph, we saw a near
 miracle take place ... Today that brave lit-
 tle state (South Vietnam) is working in free
 and  friendly association with the  United
 States, whose economic and military aid has,
 in conditions of independence, proved ef-
 fective." '0
 Senator MIKE MANSFIELD, on February 26,
 1960, reported as chairman of the Subcom-
 mittee on State Department Organization
 and Public Affairs of the Senate Committee
 on Foreign Relations:
 "By any measure Vietnam has made great
 progress under President Ngo Dinh Diem in
 the improvement of internal security, in the
 creation of the forms and institutions of
 popularly responsible government where be-
 fore few existed, and in the advancement of
 the welfare of the people of Vietnam.  The
 V.S. aid program has been an important fac-
 tor in that progress. It is still an important
 factor." 31
 The State Department's white paper of De-
 cember 1961, "A Threat to the Peace," con-
 tains the following analysis of progress in
 South Vietnam:
 "The years 1956 to 1960 produced some-
 thing close to an economic miracle in South
 Vietnam.  Food production rose an average
 of 7 percent a year and prewar levels were
 achieved and passed.  While per capita food
 production in the north was 10 percent lower
 in 1960 than it had been in 1956, it was 20
 percent higher in the south.  The output of
 textiles in the south jumped in only 1 year
 from 68 million meters (in 1958) to 83 mil-
 lion meters. - Sugar production in the same
 1-year span increased more than 100 percent,
 from 25,000 metric tons to 58,000 metric tons.
 "Despite the vastly larger industrial plant
 inherited by the north when Vietnam was
 partitioned, gross national product is con-

 siderably larger in the south.  In 1960 it was
 estimated at $110 per person in the south and
 $70 in the north.  Foreigners who have visited
 both north and south testify to the higher
 living standards and much greater availabil-
 ity of consumer goods in the latter.
 "The record of South Vietnam in these re-
 cent years is written in services and in im-
 proved welfare as well as in cold economic in-
 dexes.                                                                                                                           A massive resettlement. program ef-
 fectively integrated the 900,000 refugees from
 the north into the economic and social fabric
 of the south.  An agrarian reform program
 was designed to give 300,000 tenant farmers
 a chance to buy the land they work for a
 modest price.  Under the Government's agri-
 cultural credit program aimed at freeing the
 farmers from the hands of usurers, loans to
 peasant families increased fivefold between
 1957 and 1959.
 "Thousands of new schoolrooms were built
 and  the  elementary school  population  in
 South Vietnam increased from 400,000 In
 1956 to 1,500,000 in 1960.   A rural health
 program installed simple dispensaries in half
 of South Vietnam's 6,000 villages and ham-
 lets.                                                                                                                           An elaborate malaria eradication pro-
 gram was launched to rid Vietnam of its
 most important infectious disease.  Doctors
 and  nurses  went  into  training  in South
 Vietnam and abroad to serve their people's
 health needs.
 "This is a part, a very small part, of the
 setting against which the Viet Cong launched
 their campaign of armed action, subversion,
 and terror against South Vietnam.  It is a
 record of progress over a few brief years
 equaled by few young countries." 82
 Secretary McNamara added his testimony
 on March 26, 1964:
 "The United States * * * provided help-
 largely economic.
 "On the basis of this assistance and the
 brave, sustained efforts of the Vietnamese
 people, the 5 years from 1954 to 1959 gave
 concrete evidence that South Vietnam was
 becoming a success story.  By the end of this
 period, 140,000 landless peasant families had
 been given land under an agrarian reform
 program;  the  transportation  system  had
 been almost entirely rebuilt; rice production
 had, reached the prewar annual average of
 3.5 million metric tons-and leaped to over
 5 million in 1960;  rubber production had
 exceeded prewar totals; and construction was
 underway on several medium-size manufac-
 turing plants, thus beginning the develop-
 ment of a base for industrial growth.
 "In addition to such economic progress,
 school enrollments had tripled, the number
 of primary school  teachers had increased
 from 30,000 to 90,000, and almost 3,000 med-
 ical aid stations and maternity clinics had
 been established throughout  the country.
 And the South Vietnamese Government had
 gone far toward creating an effective appa-
 ratus for the administration of the nation.
 A National Institute of Administration had
 been established with our technical and fi-
 nancial assistance-a center for the training
 of a new generation of civil servants oriented
 toward careers of public service as opposed
 to the colonial concept of public rule." 38
 The progress which, by all this testimony,
 was made in South Vietnam between 1955
 and 1960, was due in no small part to the
 assistance of the United States.
 Without the support of the United States,
 South Vietnam would have been stillborn.
 During fiscal years 1955 through 1961, $2.3
 billion-63 percent of it for economic pur-
 poses-was  provided  by  the  Eisenhower
 administration.   Technical  assistance was
 given on a large scale to increase and di-
 versify the output of the country's economy
 and to spur the achievement of far-reaching
 social reforms, notably in the fields of edu-
 cation and diffusion of land ownership.

 But a viable Vietnam also required security
 from outside aggression and from terrorism
 and guerrilla activities within the country.
 To increase security, the Eisenhower admin-
 istration  proceeded  promptly  to  form  a
 regional defense organization, the Southeast
 Asia Treaty Organization, and to bring South
 Vietnam, as well as Laos and Cambodia,
 within its protective cover.
 Specifically to meet the threat of infiltra-
 tion from North Vietnam and the depreda-
 tions of guerrillas in the South, the United
 States  provided  military  equipment  and
 training to the forces of South Vietnam.
 ' There' can be no question that only the
 help of the United States made possible the
 survival  of  South  Vietnam.   Without it,
 everything south of the 17th parallel would
 have fallen to the Communists a decade ago.
 No commitment of troops by Eisenhower
 There is no merit in President Johnson's
 repeated explanation of the Nation's present
 military involvement in Vietnam as the re-
 sult of President Eisenhower's letter of Octo-
 ber 1, 1954, to Prime Minister Diem.  The
 letter, as Secretary McNamara admitted on
 March 26, 1964, was in response to a request
 for "economic assistance." 11   It promised
 'American help for the resettlement of re-
 fugees from North Vietnam and an explora-
 tion of "ways and means to permit our aid
 ? ? ! to make. a greater contribution to the
 welfare and stability of the Government
 of  Vietnam."   * ? *_In  the  even such
 aid were Supplied," President Eisenhower
 wrote,  the  United  States  would  expect
 "assurances .as.to'the  standards of. per-
 formance."                              The purpose of this conditional
 offer, he said, was "?  " * to assist the
 Government of Vietnam in developing and
 maintaining a strong, viable state, capable
 of resisting attempted subversion or aggres-
 sion through military means."  This was the
 extent of the commitment made fu this
 letter."'
 More recently, the administration has de-
 emphasized the Eisenhower letter to Diem
 and has argued that the present military
 Involvement in Vietnam results from the
 Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty
 signed at Manila on September 8, 1964.
 This Treaty contained no advance commit-
 ment to send American troops to fight in
 Southeast Asia.  It carefully avoided the
 kind of automatic response to aggression
 embodied in the NATO, agreement, sum-
 marized in the principle, "An attack upon
 one is an attack upon all."
 Section 1 of Article IV of the SEATO Agree-
 ment reads:
 "1. Each Party recognizes that aggression
 by means of armed attack in the treaty area
 against any of the Parties or against any
 State or territory which the Parties by unani-
 mous agreement may hereafter designate,
 would endanger its own peace and safety,
 and agrees that it will in that event act to
 meet the common danger in accordance with
 its constitutional processes."
 Secretary Dulles, testifying before the Sen-
 ate Foreign Relations Committee on the
 SEATO Treaty, declared,
 "The agreement of each of the parties to
 act to meet the common danger 'in accord-
 ance with its constitutional processes' leaves
 to the judgment of each country the type of
 action to be taken in the event an armed
 attack occurs."
 Further, Mr. Dulles said, the treaty "does
 not attempt to get into the difficult question
 as to precisely how we act    ." ae
 In the Senate debate on ratification of the
 SEATO agreement, on February 1, 1955, Sen-
 ator H. Alexander Smith, a delegate to the
 Manila Conference who signed the agreement
 on behalf of the United.States, clearly ex-
 plained the nature of the commitment in
 these words,
 "Some of the participants came to Manila
 with the intention of establishing an organi-
 zation modeled on the lines of the North At-
 lantic  Treaty  arrangements.   That  would
 have been a compulsory arrangement for our
 military participation in case of any attack.
 Such an organization might have required
 the commitment of American ground forces
 to the Asian mainland.  We carefully avoided
 any possible implication regarding an ar-
 rangement of that kind.
 "We have no purpose of following any such
 policy as that of having our forces involved
 in a ground war.
 "Under this treaty, each party recognizes
 that an armed attack on any country within
 the  treaty  area  would  endanger  its  own
 peace   and  safety.   Each party,  therefore,
 agrees to act to meet the common danger in
 accordance with its constitutional processes.
 That means, by implication, that if any such
 emergency as is contemplated by the treaty
 should arise in that area it will be brought
 before the Congress by the President and
 the administration, and will be considered
 under our constitutional processes.  We are
 not committed to the principle of NATO,
 namely, that an attack on one is an attack
 on all, calling for immediate military action
 without further consideration by Congress.
 "For  ourselves,  the  arrangement   means
 that we will have avoided the impracticable
 overcommitment which would have been in-
 volved if we attempted to place American
 ground forces around the perimeter of the
 area of potential Chinese ingress into south-
 east Asia.  Nothing in this treaty calls for
 the use of American ground forces In that
 fashion." 37
 One  academic  authority,  W.  McMahon
 Ball, has written, "The treaty does not oblige
 the 'United States either legally or morally to
 take any course in Southeast Asia than the
 course it might be expected to take if the
 treaty did not exist." sa
 Article IV of the Southeast Asia Collective
 Defense Treaty clearly reserves to each signa-
 tory the right to determine the nature of its
 response to armed aggression and does not
 obligate  any signatory to  use its armed
 forces to deal with the aggressor.
 Recognizing this fact, the Kennedy ad-
 ministration did not use American forces to
 repel Communist aggression in Laos.  The
 legal commitment of the United States to
 Laos was the same as its commitment to
 Vietnam.  Both of these countries of south-
 east Asia were brought under the protection
 of SEATO.
 Lyndon Johnson as Vice President made
 it clear in 1961 that the United States had
 not up to that time made a commitment
 that obligated it to employ its military forces
 in Southeast Asia.  In a memorandum to
 President Kennedy dated May 23, 1961, right
 after his return from a tour of Asia, Johnson
 wrote:
 "The fundamental decision required of the
 United Stactes-and time is of the greatest im-
 portance--is whether we are to attempt to
 meet the challenge of Communist expansion
 now in Southeast Asia by a major effort in
 support of the forces of freedom in the area
 or throw in the towel.  This decision must
 be made in a full realization of the very heavy
 and continuing costs involved in terms of
 Sion of whether we commit major U.S. forces
 to the area or cut our losses and withdraw
 should our efforts fail.  We must remain mas-
 ter of this decision." '"'
 Finally, General Maxwell Taylor in testi-
 mony before the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee on February 17, 1966, demolished
 the argument that the Eisenhower adminis-
 tration made any commitment to employ
 American  troops  in  combat in  Southeast
 Asia:
 Senator   HICKENLOOPER. "Now,    up  until
 the end of the Eisenhower administration,
 we had only about 750 military personnel in
 South Veitnam, did we not?"
 General TAYLOR. "It was very small, Some-
 thing like that."
 Senator HICKENLOOPER:  "I think that is
 within 25 or 30 of the number, either way,
 and they were entirely devoted to giving
 technical advice on training to the South
 Vietnamese troops."
 General Taylor. "That is correct."
 Senator HICKENLOOPER:  "To your knowl-
 edge, did we have any commitment or agree-
 ment with the South Vietnamese up to that
 time that we would put in active field mili-
 tary forces to conduct a war along with
 them?"
 General Taylor: "No, sir.  Very clearly we
 made no such commitment.  We didn't want
 such a commitment.  This was the last thing
 we had in mind."  (Emphasis added)
 Senator    HICKENLOOPER:  "When  was  the
 commitment made for us to actively partici-
 pate in the military operations of the war as
 American personnel?"
 General Taylor: "-Insofar as the use of
 our  combat ground forces are concerned,
 that took place, of course, only in the spring
 of 1965." 40
 The New York Times of August 19, 1965,
 correctly stated the case when it said, "The
 shift from military assistance and combat
 advice to direct participation by American
 combat troops in the Vietnamese war has
 ... been  a  unilateral  American  decision
 ... by President Johnson."
 The beginning of the Communist offensive
 Although the Government of South 'Viet-
 nam never established unchallenged author-
 ity in the entire countryside, a period of
 relative peace and stability extended from
 1955 to 1959.  Late in the latter year the
 tempo of guerrilla attacks began to assume
 significant proportions.
 During 1960 the armed forces of the Viet-
 cong began to increase from the level of
 3,000 at the beginning of the year.  During
 this year the Vietcong assassinated or kid-
 napped more than 2,000 civilians.                                                                                                                                             Acts of
 terrorism were directed particularly against
 local officials in rural areas to leave the coun-
 tryside leaderless.
 The signal from North Vietnam for in-
 tensification of the conflict came on Sep-
 tember 10, 1960, at the Third Congress of
 the Communist Party of North Vietnam with
 a call for the liberation of the south from
 the "rule of the U.S. imperialists and their
 henchmen."   In  December  the  National
 Front for Liberation of South Vietnam was
 formed by Hanoi.
 III. THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION
 The Democratic administration which took
 office in January of 1961 was confronted not
 only with problems in South Vietnam but
 with far more acute difficulties in the neigh-
 boring nation of Laos.  In Vietnam sporadic
 guerrilla attacks were going on.   In Laos,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE       September 20, 1966
 Strangely, the setbacks that occurred at
 the end of 1963 and the beginning of 1964
 began only, 1 month after Secretary, McNa-
 mara and General Taylor returned from
 South Vietnam with an optimistic report.
 So strong was their optimism that an imme-
 diate reduction of the American force In
 South Vietnam by 1,000 men was announced
 and the prediction was made that virtually
 all American troops would be withdrawn by
 the end of 1965.
 The text of the White House announce-
 ment of October 2, 1963, follows:
 "Major U.S. assistance in support of this
 military effort is needed only until the in-
 aurgency has been suppressed or until the
 national security forces of the Government
 of South Vietnam are capable of Suppressing
 it. Secretary McNamara and General Taylor
 reported their judgment that the major
 part of the U.S. military task can be com-
 pleted by the end of 1965, although there
 may be a continuing requirement for a lim-
 ited  number of U.S.  training personnel.
 They reported that by the end of this year,
 the U.S. program for training Vietnamese
 should have progressed to the point where
 1,000 U.S. military personnel assigned to
 South Vietnam can be withdrawn," 11
 IV. THE JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION
 During the administration of President
 Johnson the United States has become a
 full-fledged combatant in a conflict that is
 becoming bigger than the Korean War.
 President Johnson has raised American
 troop strength in Vietnam from 16,000 at the
 end of 1963 to Approximately 300,000 in late
 Today at least 85,000 other American serv-
 ice personnel are offshore or in bases in
 nearby countries supporting the military ef-
 fort in Vietnam, making total troop strength
 in the area approximately 385,000.
 Reliable estimates indicate that the na-
 tton's forces in Vietnam will increase to be-
 tween 375,000 and 400,000 by the end of 1966
 and will continue growing thereafter,
 The  maximum  number  of  American
 ground forces at any time in Korea in the
 last Asiatic war In which this country was
 involved was 302,483.
 Thus far In 1966, American casualties are
 running at a rate of 35,000 a year-still be-
 low the annual rate of 46,000 in the Korean
 War.
 More and more, under President Johnson,
 the United States has assumed the major
 responsibility for the war despite the Pres-
 ident's  pledge  not  to  commit  American
 troops. In Akron, Ohio, on October 21, 1964,
 Mr. Johnson promised ". . . we are not. about
 to send American boys nine or ten thousand
 miles away from home to dq what Asian boys
 ought to be doing for themselves." I"
 Since President Johnson assumed his pres-
 ent office, the fringes of the war have spread
 in Laos and Into Thailand.
 Sporadic ground fighting goes on in Laos
 as Communist forces push toward Thailand
 where 25,000 American servicemen are sta-
 tioned, most of whom are engaged in air op-
 erations in Laos and North Vietnam.

 endorse  his  Vice  President's  stand,  and
 White House Press Secretary Moyers declined
 to rule out as unacceptable the inclusion of
 Vietcong in a South Vietnamese government
 selected at a peace conference 00
 If placing Communists in a South Viet-
 namese government as part of a peace settle-
 ment is acceptable to the President-as it is
 to many influential members of his party,
 all the fighting in Vietnam-all the sacri-
 flces-all the bloodshed-make no sense.
 The silence of the President on the issue
 in  the  Humphrey-Kennedy  disagreement
 suggests abandonment  of   the  objectives
 stated by Secretary Rusk on January 21, 1966,
 "the  government  of South Vietnam is    a
 matter which should be determined by the
 people of South Vietnam themselves.     We
 ourselves have supported and continue to
 suport the idea of free elections in which the
 South Vietnamese people can make these
 decisions rather than have these decisions
 made for them by imposition from the out-
 side." 01
 MISCALCULATION
 The President has told the Nation, "This is
 really war."
 . To what degree miscalculation on the part
 of the enemy has brought about this state of
 affairs, no one can be sure.      It is clear, how-
 ever, that many of the words and deeds of
 the past few years could only have encour-
 aged underestimation of the constancy and
 firmness of the Nation in the pursuant of its
 foreign goals.
 . The whole handling of the problem of Laos
 could have no result other than the conclu-
 sion that the United States would not match
 its words with deeds,
 The administration said that it would not
 permit aggression against Laos to succeed,
 btu it did.
 The administration said that it would not
 begin negotiating about Laos until a cease-
 fire had been put into effect, but it did.  ,
 The administration indicated that it would
 not accept a peace settlement in Laos which
 granted a veto to any member of the Com-
 mission established to supervise the peace,
 but it did.
 Miscalculation was the natural result of
 the withdrawal of American backing for the
 Diem government.  For the United States
 had pledged its support to Diem "all the
 way," in Lyndon Johnson's phrase in 1961.
 Abrupt reversal of policy leading to the over-
 throw of the leader whom the Government of
 the United States had been ardently sup-
 porting and whose downfall was a major
 Vietcong objective could appear only as evi-
 dence of weakening of the resolve of this
 Nation.  Whether the error was the commit-
 ment to support Diem "all the way" or con-
 nivance in Diem's downfall, the net effect
 was to cast doubt on the value and dura-
 bility of a pledge of support by the United
 States.
 Miscalculation was encouraged by Presi-
 dent Johnson's campaign oratory of 1964.
 In order to make his opponent appear reck-
 less and trigger happy, the President in sev-
 eral statements set limits to American par-
 ticipation in the Vietnamese conflict which
 were to be exceeded after the election.
 Philip L. Geyelin, foreign affairs expert of
 the  Wall  Street Journal, summarized the
 President's campaign theme in these words,
 . It was not his [Johnson's] commitment
 to   Vietnam,  it was Dwight Eisenhower's;
 while he intended to honor it, he also intend-
 ed to avoid a, deeper U.S. involvement in the
 fighting." 62

 For example, on August 12, 1964, the Presi-
 dent said:
 ,,some others are eager to enlarge the con-
 flict.                                                                 They call upon us to supply American
 boys to do the job that Asian boys should
 do." 0?
 Again, on August 29, the President de-
 clared:
 "I have had advice to load our planes
 with bombs and to drop them on certain
 areas that I think would enlarge the war,
 and result in our committing a good -many
 American boys to fighting a war that I think
 ought to be fought by the boys of Asia to
 help protect their own land.  And for that
 reason,  I haven't  chosen  to enlarge  the
 war." 04
 On September 25, the President said,
 "There are those that say you ought to
 go north and drop bombs, to try to wipe out
 the supply lines, and they think that would
 escalate the war.  We don't want our Ameri-
 can boys to do the fighting for Asian boys.
 We don't want to get involved in a nation
 with 700 million people and get tied down
 in a land war in Asia." 611
 On September 28, the President said,
 "Some  of  our  people--Mr.  Nixon,  Mr.
 Rockefeller, Mr. Scranton,  and Mr. Gold-
 water-have all, at some time or other, sug-
 gested the possible wisdom of going north in
 Viet-Nam.
 We are not going north and we are
 not going south; we are going to continue
 to try to get them to save their own freedom
 with their own men, with our leadership,
 and our officer direction, and such equip-
 ment as we can furnish them." 00
 On October 21, the President said,
 "We are not about to send American boys
 9 or 10,000 miles away frolft home to do what
 Asian boys ought to be doing for them-
 selves." ??

 have been October 1964 at the height of the
 Presidential campaign.
 Whether the decision to strike at the North
 was  made  then  or not,  it  is  clear  that
 throughout  the  campaign South Vietnam
 was perilously close to collapse. The Presi-
 dent must have known, even as he offered as-
 surances  of                                                                                                                                no further involvement      that
 South Vietnam would go down the drain un-
 less the military effort of the United States
 was drastically augmented.
 Describing the campaign, Philip Geyelin
 has written, "What developed was a deadly
 race against time; increasingly the question
 agonizing the war-planners in Washington
 and  Saigon  was  whether  South  Vietnam
 could be  kept from crumbling without a
 much more vigorous U.S. effort before No-
 vember 3."
 "Meanwhile, there were clear signs of grow-
 ing anxiety, if not at the highest official level,
 at least at the lower working levels of the
 government; the experts could read the signs
 in the increased political shambles in Saigon,
 in the increased rate of infiltration, in the
 tide of war that was running unmistakably
 against the South Vietnamese.  'It is going
 to be close,' said one of the State Depart-
 ment's most reliable authorities as the U.S.
 election day approached.""
 It is impossible to measure the cost of the
 President's deceptive campaign oratory  of
 1964 and the postponement until after the
 election of a step-up in the military activity
 of the United States in Vietnam.  How many
 American casualties and how much expendi-
 ture of American economic resources might
 have been avoided by telling the truth in
 1964 and by earlier use of American air power
 against important military targets will never
 be known.
 Lack of candor on the part of the
 administration
 The lack of candor of the administration
 encourages the enemy to miscalculate.  It
 also misleads and confuses  the American
 public.  Thus it strikes at the vitals of our

 war, he made statements acclaiming "prog-

 14 separate occasions.
 Neither the Congress nor the public has

 "primary mission ... Is to secure and safe-

 added assurances that "they should not
 tangle with the Vietcong." 72
 The President announced on Yuly 28, 1965
 that the movement of 125,000 American
 troops to Vietnam did "not imply any change
 in policy whatever."

 The able Saigon correspondent of the Los
 Angeles Times, Jack Foisie wrote:
 "Although the decision to commit large-
 scale American combat units in Vietnam is
 apparent,  and is obvious to  the  enemy
 through the buildup of logistical bases on the
 central coast, authorities in Washington try
 to pretend that we really are not committed
 to land warfare in Asia, to casualties as
 large or larger than suffered during the
 Korean War." 77
