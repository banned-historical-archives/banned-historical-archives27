 The truce in Beirut appeared to be holding yesterday, but last night scattered
 shooting broke out again in the eastern suburbs of Beirut. The US embassy believes
 there is only a 50-percent chance the fragile cease-fire will last.
 Lebanese security units began yesterday to move into the hardest hit areas of
 the capital, including the commercial sections. To make security forces available for
 this task, army units have taken over the job of maintaining order in the town of
 Zahlah and the nearby Bekaa Valley.
 War-weariness and ammunition shortages on both sides have helped hold down
 the fighting, but the key calming factor was the convening of the national
 reconciliation committee, which met for the first time on Thursday. A major new
 outbreak of fighting before the next meeting of the committee on Monday would
 probably wreck the entire reconciliation effort. The embassy believes that if this
 happens, it may be impossible to avert full-scale civil war.
 On Monday, the reconciliation committee is to take up concrete proposals on
 basic social and political issues, but unless there is some sign of compromise by
 Christians and Muslims, the existence of the committee will not be much help. So
 far, there is little sign of compromise. At issue is the basic constitutional system, the
 National Covenant of 1943, which has preserved Christian political dominance.
 The embassy sees one positive element in the composition of committee-ten
 Muslims and ten Christians. This could set a precedent for meeting Muslim demands
 for political parity. In addition, the inclusion of four Shia representatives could
 prepare the way for greater political representation for Lebanon's largest and
 poorest minority.
 The leftists are heavily represented on the committee. This may have been the
 price extracted by Progressive Socialist Party leader Kamal Jumblatt for sitting down
 with Phalangist leader Pierre Jumayyil. The embassy also notes that the absence of
 any member who can clearly be labeled President Franjiyah's man is further
 evidence of the increasing irrelevance of the President.

 The annual Labor Party conference, which begins Monday in Blackpool,
 promises to be another struggle between the left wing and the moderate-
 to-conservative majority over the Wilson government's economic, industrial, and
 defense policy issues.
 Leftist dissatisfaction centers primarily on how to correct Britain's serious
 economic difficulties. The government's first priority is curbing inflation, while the
 party's left wing wants strong reflationary measures to alleviate the worst
 unemployment since the war. Chancellor of the Exchequer Healey has resisted these
 demands as was evident in the moderate program he announced earlier this week to
 combat unemployment.
 A sharp clash is also expected over defense spending, and at least one resolution
 demanding more budget cuts in this area is likely to receive conference approval.
 Energy Minister Benn, one of the most outspoken left-wing critics, will lead the
 faction demanding sweeping reform at the convention. He recently declared that the
 government must use Britain's economic crisis "as the occasion for fundamental
 change, not the excuse for postponing it."
 Other Laborites, however, argue that the deterioration of the British economy
 places limitations on government action. They believe that the government should
 concentrate its limited resources on one or two priority areas, such as housing and
 transportation, in order to obtain a maximum impact.
 Prime Minister Wilson and his supporters are expected to be able to defeat or
 water down hostile conference resolutions. Should the conference pass motions with
 which Wilson disagrees, he may disregard them in shaping government policy. Such a
 course would increase the already considerable stress between some party elements
 and the government.
 The left is certain to gain control of the party's National Executive Committee,
 which heretofore has been about evenly balanced. The nominating committee has
 already replaced several moderate incumbents with militant candidates whose
 victory is likely. In addition, other moderate incumbents who won renomination
 face strong challenges. The leftists will also attempt to force changes in party
 organization and procedure to enhance the policy-making role of the annual
 conference at the expense of Labor members of Parliament.

 These changes will strengthen the left wing of the party and will make the next
 intra-party confrontation much more serious, particularly if the Wilson government
 does  not  make  some progress in resolving  Britain's economic problems.
 The Spanish Communist Party is using radio broadcasts from Romania in an
 effort to exploit discontent among the army's junior officers.
 A recent broadcast, purportedly of a speech by the party chief, was apparently
 aimed at widening differences in the military caused by the arrest last month of ten
 junior officers on charges of sedition. His speech touched on a number of issues
 known to be of concern to the army. These include better training and equipment,
 the role in stifling political dissent, the inability of professional soldiers to express
 personal views on national and international problems, and limited promotion
 prospects.
 The speech, which emphasized the possibility of future cooperation between
 the party and the Spanish military, specifically rejected a military coup. It is
 unlikely to gain much support in the strongly anti-Communist Spanish. military, but
 the speech does air some causes for discontent among the junior officers that are not
 usually surfaced in the government-censored legal news media.

 The announcement yesterday that General Franco has spared the lives of six of
 the eleven terrorists convicted of killing policemen is not likely to appease those
 demanding clemency or those supporting the death penalty for all. Franco could still
 reprieve the remaining two Basques and three Marxist-Leninists, but the
 government's silence on their fate suggests they will be executed today.
 Their executions may temper rightist reactions, This compromise will probably
 also avoid the cabinet resignations that reportedly were threatened if all the
 sentences were allowed to stand. Even some of the more moderate members of the
 cabinet probably were concerned that leniency might cause police to pursue
 terrorists less vigorously or that police action might be replaced by far-right
 vigilantism.
 Meanwhile, members of the Marxist-Leninist group to which three of the
 condemned men belong have reportedly threatened to assassinate a high-ranking US
 or Spanish military officer if the executions are carried out.
 The failure to commute all sentences will further damage Spain's image abroad,
 where the threatened executions have been causing sharp reactions. West German
 Christian Democratic chairman Helmut Kohl and French National Assembly
 president Edgar Faure were among those leaders who, along with the Pope, appealed
 for clemency. French Socialist and Communist leaders have threatened to call a
 general strike should the executions take place.
 More violence against Spanish diplomatic missions and commercial enterprises
 abroad is likely. This morning, left-wing demonstrators in Lisbon set fire to the
 Spanish embassy and sacked the consulate. Some Spanish government buildings in
 France were also attacked.

 Setptember 27, 1975
 In an apparent attempt to influence pending negotiations with Norway,
 Moscow has recently launched four SS-7 ICBMs into an area of the Barents Sea-200
 miles north of the Norwegian mainland-claimed by both countries.
 The Soviets have not previously launched into this area. More than 40 SS-11
 ICBMs have been fired to the Barents Sea region, but they impacted on Novaya
 Zemlya Island, far from Norway. There is no technical reason why the SS-7s could
 not also have been launched to the island.
 The Soviets, moreover, took the unusual step of publicly announcing the area's
 closure to navigation in addition to issuing the normal warning notice to mariners.
 The Norwegians have expressed concern with Moscow's actions, not only because of
 the danger presented to fishermen and to navigation, but also because of a tacit
 understanding between the two countries to avoid provocative acts while
 negotiations are proceeding.
 Negotiations to delineate both countries' continental shelf began last
 November. The impact area falls within the limits claimed by Moscow, but is
 immediately west of the line proposed by Norway.
 Although Moscow is interested in the exploitation of potential oil and gas
 deposits in the area, the Soviets are also anxious to establish their right to
 unimpeded use of this strategic passage. Economic development by Norway would
 involve the construction of oil drilling platforms and other facilities which would
 constrain Moscow's use of the sea routes.

 The ruling military council is encountering resistance from labor unionists and
 teachers in Addis Ababa.
 The main civilian airfield in the capital was closed yesterday following a clash
 on Thursday between security forces and union members employed by Ethiopian
 Air Lines. At least four airport workers were killed and 19 seriously wounded. The
 clash occurred when the government's forces moved in to arrest union members
 accused of distributing pamphlets attacking the military regime. Some reports
 indicate that airline workers are preparing to defy the government's no-strike ban.
 Earlier this week the government arrested at least 20 teachers caught
 distributing pamphlets demanding a prompt return to civilian rule.
 The antigovernment pamphleteering appears to be the outgrowth of recent
 actions by the Confederation of Ethiopian Labor Unions, the country's central labor
 organization. It recently issued a manifesto threatening a general strike unless power
 is returned to civilian hands within a month. The manifesto also reportedly calls for
 the swift implementation of "Marxist-Leninist policies." Labor's program probably
 does not differ greatly from the professed objectives of the military's socialist
 revolution. The two part company on who is to carry out the revolution.
 The confederation's most effective leaders have been imprisoned for several
 months, and its ability to make good on a general strike threat is questionable.
 Postal workers are reported, however, to have struck to protest the government's
 treatment of the airline workers.
 In view of its new problems with civilian opponents, the military council may
 regret its recent release from custody of more than 1,000 disaffected students who
 had  been arrested as a precautionary measure prior to the celebrations in
 mid-September of the first anniversary of Haile Selassie's ouster. The students could
 add to the government's woes in the capital.

 The only concrete result thus far of North Vietnamese party chief Le Duan's
 five-day visit to Peking is a terse announcement on Chinese economic assistance.
 The agreements signed on Thursday call for an interest-free loan and a supply
 of "general commodities" to North Vietnam in 1976. As in past years, no details
 were announced. Neither the Chinese nor Vietnamese announcements mentioned
 military assistance to Hanoi, almost certainly a reflection of reduced Vietnamese
 military aid requirements since the end of the Indochina war. The reference to an
 interest-free loan is new and suggests that Peking has altered its view of economic aid
 responsibilities to Hanoi as well, for similar reasons, and feels itself less obligated to
 provide grant aid.
 Chinese handling of the delegation seems to underline the coolness in current
 Sino-Vietnamese relations. Press treatment was noticeably less effusive than it had
 been during Le Duan's last visit in 1973. Moreover, the Chinese took advantage of
 the welcoming banquet for the Vietnamese delegation to again point out the dangers
 of "superpower hegemonism," a characterization of Soviet intentions that Hanoi
 does not share and one that the Vietnamese omitted from their own press coverage
 of the banquet.
 The troublesome question of sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly islands in
 the South China Sea may also have had an adverse impact on the discussions. Just
 prior to the delegation's departure for Peking early in the week, two Chinese
 broadcasts to Vietnam underscored Peking's claim to both island groups.

 Peking has rehabilitated a considerable number of former cultural officials who
 were among the earliest purged during the Cultural Revolution and who have long
 been symbols of the "revisionist tendencies" that the movement of the mid-1960s
 was to have extirpated.
 The symbolic importance of the rehabilitation of these men, who have now
 been restored to party membership in good standing and reportedly given new jobs,
 tends to call into question the aims and efficacy of the Cultural Revolution itself.
 Moreover, the return of the officials casts a serious doubt on the role of Mao's wife
 Chiang Ching in the cultural sphere that she has dominated for a decade. She has
 built her political career on opposition to the policies with which these men are
 associated.
 Chiang Ching, who began her involvement in cultural affairs a few years before
 the Cultural Revolution, was particularly virulent in her attacks on these and other
 well-known cultural figures. Their return is not only a repudiation of Chiang Ching's
 role in the Cultural Revolution, but also a sign of party dissatisfaction with her
 activities in the sensitive cultural area since that time.
 Several of the rehabilitated officials had been accused by the Red Guard of
 being close personal friends of Deputy Premier Teng Hsiao-ping. Their return
 suggests that Teng is consolidating his position at Chiang Ching's expense.
 The rehabilitation of these officials undoubtedly causes dissatisfaction and
 unhappiness within the party's left wing. Some of this presumed dissatisfaction may
 have surfaced in the initial criticism of the 14th century Chinese novel "Water
 Margin" late last month. The early discussion of the novel focused mainly on the
 issue of "amnesty," which appears to be a codeword for rehabilitation. The novel's
 leading figure and several of his cohorts were heavily criticized for seeking and

 accepting amnesty from the "emperor"-who seems to represent Mao. This early
 criticism of the novel may have been an expression of frustration by party "leftists"
 over the proposed rehabilitation of the cultural officials.
 Since an editorial in People's Daily on September 4, however, criticism of the
 novel has been muted and the amnesty question subordinated to other issues.
 25X1                           the appearance in May o the former head of Peking University may
 have been a forerunner of the public return of these high-ranking officials. Rumors
 are now circulating that many will appear for the first time during National Day
 September 27, 1975
 celebrations on October 1.

 Thai Foreign Minister Chatchai announced yesterday that Cambodian Foreign
 Minister Sarin Chhak had agreed to visit Bangkok, probably in late October, to
 discuss the establishment of diplomatic relations and to prepare for a later visit by
 Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs leng Sary.
 Thai officials have been publicly expressing their desire to normalize relations
 since a low-level border meeting in late July. Sarin Chhak's reported agreement to
 hold ministerial-level talks is in line with other recent efforts by the Cambodian
 communists to broaden their international horizons.
 Chatchai also expressed Thailand's willingness to aid in Cambodia's economic
 development and to supply rice to Cambodia as soon as relations are normalized.
 The Cambodians are almost certainly interested in this overture since they have been
 paying high prices for rice and petroleum products sold without Thai government
 authorization at the border town of Poipet in northwestern Cambodia.
 Other issues that will probably be raised at the October talks are border
 security problems and the status of the approximately 15,000 Cambodian refugees
 in Thailand.

 FOR THE RECORD
 SEATO:  The annual council  meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty
 Organization this week decided to phase out the organization over the next two
 years. It was implicitly agreed that the Manila Pact-the legal underpinning of the
 organization-would remain in force in response to Thai desires. The Philippines did
 not press its proposal to terminate the pact along with the SEATO organization.
