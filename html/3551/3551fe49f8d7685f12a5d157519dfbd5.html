Although no college or university has been established by the Yunnan 
provincial fund, provincial high schools are many. The leading ones 
are Klun Hue Normal School, F'un Hua Industrial School, K'un Hua 
Commercial School, Klun Hua Boys' Middle School, Pun Hua Girls* 
Middle School, Klun Hue Girls* Vocational School and Yunnan Provincial 
School of English. Students of the above schools usually follow the 
lead of National Yunnan University.. 
e. Leadin PublicityAmeg 
In addition to work done by members of the Political Department of the 
Yunnan Pacification Headquarters which is directed by CH'] N Jung-ming 
), the other responsible personnel for publicity work of the 
Pacification Headquarters do little other than welcoming and seeing off 
big wheels at the airfield. Chp.ng Yang Jih Pao (4/ #1:. elpit )2 published 
by CC Clique member CH'IEN Tsang-shih C7AL4A ), is about the only 
press organ which Is definitely on the Central Government's side; it still 
calls the Chinese Communists "bandits" and hopes for the success of the 
Kuomintang. The mesquite mere, weeklies and others, including The 
Observer,(Kuan Ch 'a Pao VAR% ) and The Righteousness  (Cheng I 
7W-77/VOL), have definitely turned toward the dommunlsts. Kuan C 'a 
Pao, which As published by LUVG Yun+s son, LUNG Sheng-wu (AA), 
reads very much like the Hongkong  Kung Pao; the Chang I Pan in Kunming 
which is published by JUAN I-jen (7Eakie. ), reads very much like the 
Hongkong 'en Hui Pao. They bear more news from the Hsin Hua News Agency 
than from theaffkg12Eljgglm. The only "open-secret' cover they put 
on is that instead of indicating the news covers from the Hein Hua News 25X1 
Agency, these papers say "news from Hongkong". They openly attack the 
Central Government and call it the "CHIANG Government", however, these 
papers claim that they are on good terms with the municipal and provincial 
? governments. While the Kuan Chia Pao is completely financed and directed 
by LUNG Sheng-wu, the Cheng I fao has been in the hands of the Board of 
Staff and Laborers since June 19492 before which month it was financed 
and directed by a Board of Directors headed by the present Finance 
Commissioner LIN Yd-tleng. Leftist reporters crept into the Cheng I Pao 
and demanded a change with threats; in the hope of retaining his high 
post and avoiding his name being put on the "war criminal" list, LIN gave 
in and withdrew his authority from the paper. 
2,, LU Han was on the Central Government side up to the latter partsf i 948 when 
his former subordinate and division commander TSENG Tse-sheng (V 
surrendered to the Communists in Manchuria and LU Chan-chlan (elk ;Irk )'s 
troops were smashed by the Communists in Manchuria. Realizing that he had 
very little military power to depend upon and finding that the Communist and 
bandit troops were expanding in Yunnan, LU, when attending the conference of 
the Central Government for the last time, politely demanded the removal of 
the Yunnan Garrison Headquarters (an organ of the Central Government). 
CHIANG Kai-shek granted LU his wish but in order to watch LU, CHIANG replaced 
the garrison headquarters with the 6 Organization and Training Headquarters 
with HO Shao-chou (fg tg) ), HO Ying-ch'in's nephew, as commander and con-
currently commander of the 49 Army which was a'so then established. 
3-. Up to March 1949, 34 of the total 120 hsien of Yunnan were occupied by the 
Chinese Communists and the so-called People '?rmed Forces. HO Shao-chou, 
who used drastic measures in dealing with student demonstrations and other 
movements, aroused ill feeling among the students who were instigated by 
undercover Communists and Democratic league members. In addition to Wei 
students, various press organs manipulated by leftist and opportunist editors . 
and reporters advocated the removal of HO Shao-chou. 25X1

4. In the name of helping LU to suppress the bandits, the 26 Division, which 
troops are Cantonese, map sent over to Yunnan in March 1949, Also at the 
same time the Southeast Yunnan Bandit Suppression Headquarters was established 
in,K,airdan or Amihsien (103-10, 23-44), with Division Commander Ye Chleng-,wan 
) as the bandit suppression commander concurrently. In May 1949 
the 26 Division was expanded into the 26 Army of two divisions with about 
14,000 men, They have been much better equipped, much better disciplined and 
much more efficient than LU Hants peace preservation regiments or bodyguards; 
they have also out-numbered the combination of the latter two. The 26 Army 
is sufficient Central Government military strength to make LU Han keep quiet 25X1 
for the time being but insufficient to make LU loyal, 
5.

7. At present, very few of the hsien of Yunnan are entirely free from Communists 
or real bandits, the latter including LUNG Yan's former subordinates., Since 
24 July 1949, the 26 Army has been trying to raise about 7,300 men to enlarge 
the army into three divisions. Places where they have been raising troops 
include the following hsien: Chiengkung (102-48, 24-55), Iliang (103-09, 
24-54), Chengchiang (102-52, 24-42), Huaning (102-54, 24-15), Lunan (103-17, 
24-46), Luliang (103-38, 25-02), Chinning (102-42, 24-44), Sungming (103-01, 
25-22), Mining (102-30, 24-56), Kunyang (102-33, 24-43) and Fuming (102-30, 
25-14). All these hsien are near Kunming and are about the least annoyed 
by the Communists or bandits; this makes the process of raising treys mien 
easier than if done in other hsien far away from Kunming.

a. South Yunnan 
(1) The Communist troops in South Yunnan are organized under two main 
columns, namely, Yunnan-Kweichou-Kwangsi Border Column of the Chinese 
People's Liberation Army and the Second Column of Yunnan People's 
Self-Defense Army. The Yunnan-Kweichou-Kwangsi Border Column, 
which was formally established in January 1949, is headed by General 
CHUANG Tlien (A 47 ) butethe one who actually leads the troops is 
General CHU Chia-pi (0...11.11 ), Deputy Commander of the Column. The 
Second Column of the Yuman People's Self-Defense Army is headed by 
LI Po-heiunr ($/016: ) and is actually led by Deputy Commander 
Ye( Wein(41 $4 )0 
(2) In Verche1949, CHU's troops occupied not only many hsien along the 
Yunnan-Kweichou-Kwangsi border, but quite a number along the Yunnan-
French Indo-China border, YO's troops who occupied the area west 
of the Yunnan-French Indo-China Railway cooperated with CHU's troops. 
(3) 
(4) 
25X1 
At the end of April 1949, the Chinese Communist Branch Headquarters 
in Yunnan further organized the Second Column of the Yunnan People's 
Self-Defense Army into two People's Armed Forces, namely the Pvet 
Kuang Army Corps and the South Yunnan People's Self-Defense Army. 
The Pfu Kuang Army Corps led by FU (ittf ) in Psuerhhaien 
was an anti-Government military troop in which -a few Communist students 
crept in and succeeded in making FU formally turn to the Communists. 
The South Yunnan People's Self-Defense Army led by LO Chong-ming 
(tit 11E40 ) and LIU Ya-nan ato4 ) in Ssumao, Lent sang (99-59, 
22-35), Mienning (10/-04, 22-47) and vicinities was also a non-
Communist troop to begin with. 
That part of South Yennan controlled by the Chinese Communists wee 
further enlarged after the P'u Kuang Army Corps was reorganized into 
the 13 Detachment (Branch Column) of the 2 Column of the Yunnan 
People's Self-Oefense Army still led by FU Hsiao-lou, and after the 
South Yunnan People's Self-Defense Army was reorganized into the 
11 Detachment (Branch Column) of the 2 Column of the Yunnan People's 
Self-Defense Army still led by LIU Ta-nan, while LO Cheng-ming was 
promoted deputy commander of the 2 Column of the Yunnan People's 
Self-Defense Army. 
(5) Although the 26 Armvof the Central Government set up its headquarters 
in Kaiyilan about 15 March 1949 and recovered some of the towns of 
the hsien from the Communists, these towns have not been very well 
held. Either the Communists infiltrate by political moans or they 
come back again as soon as the 26 Army withdraws. Various towns 
constantly change hands and in South Yunnan the 26 Army can be 
sure to hold fast only those towns along the Yunnan-Indo-China 
Renew. To avoid any possible heavy lessee, CHU's major strength 
is along the Yunnan-Indo-China Border and YO 's in the hsiea near 
Burma. They still use the tactics of guerrilla earfare. Their 
troops number about 27,000 nen. 
(6) On 30 April 1949, a conference at Puerh hsien was held to bring 
about the reorganization of the Plukuang Unit and the Ti nazfVorder 
District People's Self-Defense Army so as to bring them unaer the 
command system of the Yunnan People's Self-Defense Army, and to 
consider the problem of local political regimes.

(7) Representatives who were present at the conference are as follows: 
(a) CHAO Wen A ), representative of the CCP Yunnan Provincial 
Government Council.

tives of the 2 Column of the Yunnan People's Self-Defense Army. 
LO Chen-ming (0i Ji.gg ), FU Hsiao-lou (444 ), LU En-tee 
g ) and SHO Meng-chin of ), representatives of 
the Pitt Kuang ) Unit and the Yi Nan (t4 ) People's 
Self-Defense Army. 
b. East Yunnan 
(1) Communist troops of the East Yunnan People's Self-Defense Branch?, 
Column in the area in East Yunnan are led by YANG Shou-tu (41/A5 ) 
and YANG's uncle YANG Tli-ydan (e064elie ). Their troops number 
about 18,000 men and they have set up Communist bases in each one 
of the hsien either in town or at the suburb of the city? For 
instance, the town of Milo (103-23, 24-24) was recently recovered 
by the 26 Army, but Communist bases in the suburbs are very strong. 
Yagistrates in the towns simply can do nothing under the threat of 
the Communists at the suburbs who may come down on the town at any . 
time and without encountering any resistance fromsthe.Peace Preserva-
tion Corps or police. The town of Hsdanwei (41 ), for instance, is 
in the hands of some young Hsdanwei natives who liberated themselves. 
However, they find they have to leave the Communists -the suburbs in 
order to maintain peace in town. Besides, they find their own sons 
and daughters going over to the Communists. 
c. West Yunnan 
A contingent of about 5,000 men is led by LIANG Hsing-lou ago ), 
Commander of the Southwest Yunnan People's Self-Defense Army which moves 
about Chingtung (100-54, 24-27), kenghua (100-20, 25-15) and vicinity. 
Although the town of Menghua was recoveredby the PeAce Preservation 
Regiments commanded by Colonel YO Chien-hsdn (4. 0.10 )? the Communists 
still move around in the suburbs. As a matter of fact, the town of Menghua 
was recovered with almost no contact with the Communist troops which just 
moved away as the Peace Preservation troops came over. Other troops in 
7iest Yunnan which are encouraged by the Chinese Communists but have not yet 
been organized into regular Communist troops include the "Anti-Opium-
ProductioneSuppression Corps" (K0ang Chlan Tui jAK) led by LI Chien-
chou (4PAi1 ), the People's Self-Defense Corps led by CHAO Fu-oh 'u 
(A141110 ) and the People's Self-Defense troops led by LO Ying ). 
9. Although there are no Communist troops in the municipality of Kunming, there 
is considerable political and pub::i.city eork obviously taking place through-
out the city. Except for the organization of the Peasants' Union in various 
Communist controlled cities and especially in the suburbs of such cities, 
other political and publicity activities in Yunnan take those of Kunming as a 
pattern. In Kunming as well as in the parts of Yunnan controlled by the 
Communists, the Students' Union and the New Democratic Youth Corps are the 
most active among all other organizations established or dominated by the 
Communists.

ments, and recently pulled the Normal College, the Wu Hua College (kb gye

leadership". "Summer" schools are established to take in high school, primary 
school and even illiterate students - all free of charge. Many of the teachers 
throughout the province are underground Communists, leftist lecturers, or 
"professional" assistants and students. Although Chinese, English, mathematics, 
and natural science are taught in such "summer" schools, the courses most 
emphasized are social science -.the other name for the New Democracy 
(Hain Min Chu Chu Ilk ) - and Country Dance - the famous Yang Ko 
Wu (4k4K/$ ). Posters openly advertising the sale of "The New Democracy" and 
other books written by MAO Tse-tung are pasted on the most obvious spots of 
the campus wall. Students of the summer schools are taught to get ready "for 
the dawn" and for presenting Yang No Wu to welcome the Liberation Army. Small 
groups called learning Teams have been formed; conferences for discussion on 
problems of the "New Democracy" and evening rallies are frequent. . 
11, In the summer school of the Normal College in 1949, about 1,300 students were 
- collected. The teacher o, teaches "social science" is the underground Com-
munist worker TUNG Shu cl's/X ), lecturer of the Normal College. Groups for 
"learning" and conferences for discussion are led by him. In each of the 
universities, colleges and schools, the Szu Lien Hui (17.01 ) has been 
established. This is a union consisting of a group of representatives of the 
teachers, the staff, the students and the workers of a given university, college 
or school. Members of each union are either Communists or pro-Communists, they 
claim that they should dominate the entire affairs of their respective univer-
sity, college or school. In addition to attacking the university, college or 
school authorities, the union members demand the retention or removal of 
certain professors or teachers the stopping of non-Yunnan troops from entering 
Yunnan soil, for the transporting in of sufficient gold and silver reserve 
before the issuance of silver yuan notes, and for everything, big and small, 
military or political, 
12. In the National Yunnan University, as well as in other colleges, the Departmental 
Affairs Committee, which is exactly like that now at Peita or Tsiaghua in 
Peiping, has already revised all curricula of the various departments for the 
coming semester. The course in the San Min Chu I has not only been cancelled 
from the curricula and replaced by Merxian-Leninism and New Democracy but the 
students have refused to take any examination on San Min Chu I and civics. 
Students claim that they are getting ready for the "taking-over" job, About one-
eixth of the students of National Yunnan University and of the Normal College, 
and quite a number of high school and even primary school students, have left 
the university or schools during the summer vacation for home ostensibly, but 
actually in order to join the service of YANG Shou-tu (A kr ) or A Wei-min, 
13? The high school teachers, the primary School teachers, the reporters and 
editors, bank employees, rickeha coolies, etc., have their unions. All such 
unions follow the representative system whereby a few Communist members repre-
sent the entire body. As soon as the Su Lien Hui of universitioracolleges 
and schools demand or protest something, other unions follow suit. On 7 August 
1949 the ricksha coolies' union demanded that the municipal government stop 
running any buses in tom, because since the bus resumed operation in July 1949 
the ricksha coolies have lost business, On 8 August the municipal government 
ordered the bus company to turn its downtown run to long distance suburb 
service. On 9 August 1949, the bus drivers' union demanded that the municipal 
government withdraw its order.. Neither the Students' Union nor any of the 
press organs criticise this case as they do in almost all other instances.
