 1.  BULGARIA.    Large number of 'et planes re ortei'd1  based near Sofia:  Accor-
 25X1C           ding to
 150 "Russian jet planes" of unspecz ie  type were located at
 Bozhuriste Airfield, northwest of Sofia, in mid-January 1952,  Two train-
 ing schools were reportedly in operation at the airfield, one for active
 student pilots and the other for reserve officers.   The airfield was said
 to be guarded by, an antitank regiment.  (S

 25X1 C
 25X1 C
 Comment:  Presumably the term "Russian jet planes" refers to Russian-
 type jet aircraft assigned to the Bulgaxian Air Force.  Although the spe-
 cific details of this report are not confirmed, augmentation of Bulgarian
 Air Force jet aircraft strength has also been indicated by other reports.
 In January,                                       reported that 48 MIG-
 15's had arrived at Varna in early December 1951, and that 34 jet aircraft
 had been unloaded at the same port on 10 December.  On 20 December,
 reported that
 a "newly formed" antitank artillery regiment stationed at
 Bozhuris e Airfield.  He stated that the airfield was full of "Russian"
 officers and planes.
 2.  CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  Conference will spark campaign against cosmopolitanism
 in Czech science and philosophy:  An ideological conference organized by
 the Czech Military Academy of Technology and.the universities will be held
 in Brno from 27 to 29 February.   The conference will discuss the struggle
 against cosmopolitanism and bourgeois objectivism in Czech science and
 philosophy, upholding Soviet science as a model.
 Minister of Information Kopecky will deliver the main address on
 "Cosmopolitanism, Proletarian Internationalism, and Socialist Patriotism."
 25X1A    (R FBIS~7 Feb 52)
 Comment:  The conference will no doubt launch a nation-wide propa-
 ganda campaign conducted through mass organizations against all influences
 in Czech life which are "foreign" to the Soviet idea of internationalism.
 Current propaganda against cosmopolitanism has stressed its international
 aspects and has attacked the Vatican, Zionism and social democracy as
 forces undermining national sovereignty for the benefit of the United
 States.
 Kopecky, who is apparently to be the leader in this campaign, stated
 in an article in the Soviet Pravda last month that mass political work in

 6,   YUGOSLAVIA.  Tripartite governments reject Yugoslav request for SO million
 dollars:   Britain, France, and the United States have informed the Yugoslav
 Government that its request for approximately 80 million dollars to finance
 capital goods imports has been refused and that it should look to the In-
 ternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the financing of
 these imports.   (C Belgrade 1010, 15 Feb 52)
 Comment:  The Yugoslavs are attempting to complete their ambitious
 investment schemes as soon as possible.  For this reason, the IBRD program
 has been both inadequate and protracted.
 Britain, France and the United States have extended a total of 75
 million dollars in tripartite aid to date.  This leaves a potential 50
 million for the remainder of fiscal 1952.  The scheduling for the remainder
 of the program is being drawn up this week in Washington.
 7.          Yugoslav officers told that American officers come as "spectator
 not as "inspectors":   The Political Commissar of the Zagreb Military
 District told a conference of high Yugoslav officers last month that
 despite the acceptance of a small United States military aid group, the
 only real "condition" attached to American military assistance was that
 any attack from the east must be resisted by all possible means.  The
 25X1X   informant, a                            stated that his officer friends
 seem unpertur e  a ou  the aid program.
 The American Consul states that the party line appears to be that the
 American military men are coming as "spectators" rather than "inspectors."
 (S Zagreb 152, 8 Jan 52)
 Comment:  This report suggests. that Yugoslav leaders will attempt
 to hold American observation to a minimum, just as they did to limit the
 size and functions of the aid group.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 T.    IRAN.  Senate insists that oil negotiations continue:  The Iranian Senate
 is thoroughly aroused over the reported break in the World Bankes nego-
 tiations with Mossadeq on the oil problem and intends to make certain that
 the talks do not cease.  The president of the Senate has informed the
 American Ambassador in Tehran that the Senate considers, however,, that it
 would be unwise to insist on acceptance of an agreement which runs counter
 to public opinion  and consequently could not be enforced for any length
 of time. (S Tehran 3111, 17 Feb 52)
 Comment:  Unexpected Senate intervention in the talks between Inter-
 national Bank officials and Mossadeq apparently prevented a breakdown.
 There may now exist the opportunity that a fair offer with appropriate
 face-saving devices may actually be given genuine consideration by moder-
 ate Iranians.                 Mossadeq is still captive to the intolerance and hyper-
 theyMathe
 nationalism he helped arouseei~msubordinate tointervention
 ~lis,
 Senate, whose power and influence
 should not be overemphasized.
 2.          Communists prove most powerful o  osition group in Tehran elections:
 Election returns from Tehran indicate that the illegal Tudeh Party is
 the strongest organized opposition in that electoral district.  Although
 the National Front won all twelve parliamentary seats from Tehran, a
 Tudeh-sponsored candidate gained fourteenth place with 29,000 votes as
 compared with the top Nationalist candidatees 112,000 votes.
 The American Embassy notes that the National Front has covertly been
 trying to divert the loyalty of the security forces from theShaahwtohthe
 Government.  It fears that continuation of this )olicy, together      the
 expected deterioration of the economic and political conditions, would
 create a political vacuum in which the Tudeh would be left as the only
 effective organized group.   (S Tehran 3118, 16 Feb 52)
 Comment:  National Front control is expected to prevent the election
 .of most Tudeh-sponsored candidates.  Accordingly, the Communists are not
 in a position to obtain control of the government by legal means.
 Mossadeq?s actions since taking office, however, indicate that he will con-
 tinue to do all he can to limit the powers of the Shah and the Army.  This
 policy, combined with Mossadeg9s unwillingness to take stringent measures
 against them, will undoubtedly strengthen the Communists, and there is
 a real danger that they may eventually attempt to seize power.

 subsi-
 Americanment is preparing to control the Burmese rice trade completely by
 dizing a P1cooperative" to handle rice exports which originally were
 planned for private trade.  The Embassy comments that this action is
 apparently designed to secure a higher price for bid rice which would
 set the standard for prices sold on a government to government basis.
 (S Rangoon 807, 15 Feb 52)
 Comment*.  The sale of rice is by far the most important source of
 revenue for the Burmese Government.  However, a substantial amount has
 usually been left for private dealers to handle.  This contemplated
 action., following closely upon the conclusion of negotiations
 nationalization of the Burmah Oil Company and ation,is another significant step toward socialization in Burma.

 where the National Resistance Front is struggling against Communism."
 The radio emphasizes that, the planes and weapons used by the French
 were "begged from a foreign country," and contends that this attack

 ing to Ambassador Muacio, the ever-present concern of the ROK lest the UN
 withdraw from Korea too early and leave it unprotected.  Despite prompt
 action at the outbreak of the war and the record of UN assistance since
 then9 the ROK continues to be skeptical of what would happen after an
 armistice, and Muccio believes serious consideration should be given to the
 entire question.  (S Pusan 813, 16 Feb 52)

 10-12 February to discuss countermeasures against the outlawing of the

 CINCFE comments that the proposed organizations control law prob-
 ably will severely restrict Communist activities and might provide a
 legal basis for outlawing the party.  For some time past the JCP has been
 preparing for the event by strengthening its covert organizations, expand-
 ing popular front activities, and infiltrating non-Communist labor and
 political groups.  (S Tokyo Weeka 7, 16 Feb 52)

 SECTION 3  (WESTERN)
 1.  GERMANY.  Cabinet shifts predicted:      Chancellor Adenauer is reportedly about
 to nETe- two new key ca ine  mem ers.  Heinrich von Brentano, present leader
 of the Christian Democrats in the Bundestag, confirms that he has been
 offered the Foreign Affairs Ministry post now held by the Chancellor, and
 Eberhard Wildermuth, present Housing Minister, will reportedly be named
 chief defense adviser, or future Minister of Defense.  Brentano, who has
 not yet formally accepted the offer, states that he must accept the post and
 risk a possible clash with the Chancellor by continuing his attempts to bring
 about a bipartisan approach to foreign affairs with the opposition Social
 Democrats, which he feels is imperative.
 Local US officials comment that Brentano is unlikely to challenge
 Adenauer's authoritarian methods to any great extent.  (C Bonn 1595, 16 Feb 52)
 Comment:  Adenauer's party has reacted unfavorably to the Chancellor's
 "inep tt -handling of the.. opposition during the rearmament debates in the
 Bundestag on 7 and 8 February.  At the same time,
 reported growing criticism of Adenauervs present chief defense adviser,
 Theodor Blank, hinting that he no longer was considered a likely candidate
 for the future Defense Ministry post.  Wildermuth has shown an interest in
 the defense post for some time, although he has not been mentioned prominently
 as a candidate for the position since late 1950.  Now one of the more obscure
 cabinet members, he would be much more subject to Adenauervs close control.
 2.            Poll cites adverse West German reaction to NATO:  Favorable reaction
 toward NAT O  as as ye  fal e   o  eve op in Wes  Germany, according to a
 poll conducted for HICOG by a reliable German survey organization.  Un-
 familiarity with NATO as well as lack of opinion was widespread.  Although
 reactions to General Eisenhower as a leader were distinctly favorable, a
 sizeable minority showed a lack of confidence in him and believed that he
 would not treat any German troops as equals,  The great majority considered
 the USSR the principal threat to peace; approximately one-third of those
 interviewed, however, had serious apprehensions that US behaviour could
 precipitate war.
 The poll results also suggest that though West Germans, particularly
 youths and veterans, are preponderantly opposed to a conscription law, the
 majority are likely to go along with any such legislation.  (C Frankfurt
 )499, 8 Feb 52)

 position, has tried to discourage the attendance of Belgian industrialists
 at the Soviet-sponsored economic conference in April.  The official adds
 that numerous inquiries from businessmen have been received concerning the
 conference   The promoters of the conference in Belgium are of extreme-
 left-wing sympathies.  (C Brussels 1182, 15 Feb 52)
 Comment:  The Netherlands, too, has tried to discourage attendance
 at the Moscow Economic  Conference.
 ITALY,  Labor Minister urges Christian Democratic domination of trade union
 cT- i.t .es: Hig  o  icials of t e Chris Lan Democra is Party and the Catholic
 Church attended the ceremonies at the recent opening of a party-sponsored
 trade union leadership school in Rome.  The Minister of Labor,, in a key speech,
 defined the scope of union activity as "being devoted only to the most narrow
 interpretation" and asserted broad-scale operations should be undertaken by
 political parties.   He praised the Church and expressed support for the
 activities of the Church-supported Christian Association of Italian Workers
 within the union?s framework.  The M Embassy in Rome comments that this
 speech further illustrates the efforts of the Christian Democrats to create
 a union subservient to their wishes.  No executives of the Christian Democrat-
 dominated Confederation of Labor Unions attended the ceremony.  (S Rome Joint
 Weeka 7, 15 Feb 52)
 Comment:  The recent advocacy by Christian Democratic Party secretary-
 genera  Gonella of a labor organization composed solely of party members
 was resented by the leadership of the Confederation of Labor Unions, which
 includes Republicans and democratic Socialists and has tried to keep the
 organization free from political influence (see CCI Daily Digest, 23 Jan 52)0
 Church participation in the sponsoring of a party trade union is increasing
 anti-clerical opposition to the Christian Democrat-dominated government in
 the face of local elections in south Italy this spring.
 Italy alarmed by British and French restrictions on im orts:  Italian
 economic o (icials are seriously worrie  over recent Britis  ~snport restric-
 tions which will affect Italian agricultural products and French restrictions
 on the import of semifinished materials. US Embassy officials in Rome fear
 that Italy may take retaliatory action.  (S         Rome Joint Weeka 7,
 15 Feb 52)
 Comment:  Recent import restrictions by Britain, France, West Germany,
 and t e    have alarmed Italy, which fears a world-wide trend toward such
 restrictions.    Curtailment of Western trade outlets will make the Sov  t
 market that much more attractive to southern Italian agriculturalists and
 possibly increase their desire to participate in Moscow conferences on
 international trade.  Furthermore, increased It< lo--`"oviet trade will raise
