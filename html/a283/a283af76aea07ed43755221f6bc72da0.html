 MAO'S "CULTURAL REVOLUTION" IN 1967: THE
 STRUGGLE TO "SEIZE POWER"
 This Intelligence Report develops in broad outline
 the course of the "Cultural Revolution" in Communist China
 during 1967.     It is written from the point of view that
 Mao either initiated or approved policies which shifted
 the direction and intensity of the "Cultural Revolution"
 during the year, and that he ordered the sharp reversal
 of policy from revolutionary action to moderation follow-
 ing the high level of economic disorder and violence of
 August.
 Mao was not forced, the paper argues, to reverse
 his revolutionary policy by pressure from a "moderate"
 faction, nor did the period of moderation which followed
 his August decisions mean that the "Cultural Revolution"
 was over; rather, it was a pause, a temporary shift in
 emphasis from revolution from below to revolution from
 above.
 Nevertheless, the net effects of events in 1967
 were to diminish Mao's power to control developments and
 to create major, probably long term, political, social
 and administrative dislocations.
 This is one of a series of SRS staff studies based
 on continuing surveillance of the China scene.  The
 research a                       for the  preparation of this

 MAO'S "CULTURAL REVOLUTION" IN 1967:  THE
 STRUGGLE TO "SEIZE POWER"
 Summary
 In January 1967, Communist China's "great proletar-
 ian cultural revolution" entered a new stage--a stage of
 violent overthrow of all those in positions of authority
 in the party and government who refused to accept Mao Tse-
 tung's new "revolutionary" order.   As originally envisaged
 by Mao, this revolutionary act of "seizure of power from
 below" was to have resulted in the creation of a new power
 structure dominated by his "revolutionary Leftist" support-
 ers and modeled after the Paris Commune.   As the ultimate
 expression of Mao's "mass-line" approach to politics, this
 undertaking to rely on the "revolutionary masses" to create
 a viable substitute for a "bureaucratic" party and govern-
 ment apparatus was probably doomed from the outset.
 Erupting in Shanghai under the name of the "January
 Revolution," this frenzied drive to "seize power" initiated
 a period of nation-wide violence and disorder which required
 immediate and drastic countermeasures.   The first of these
 was the decision of 23 January ordering the People's Libera-
 tion Army to intervene in the "cultural revolution" in order
 to support the outnumbered and disorganized forces of the
 "revolutionary Left."  The second was a shift in policy
 toward party cadres, emphasizing more humane treatment
 and rehabilitation to make use of their administrative
 skills.   The third was an effort to overcome the pronounced
 tendency toward "anarchism" which had characterized the
 "January Revolution," an effort to reorganize and rectify
 the ranks of the "revolutionary Left."
 Finally, the decision was taken to jettison the
 Shanghai example in favor of a new model for emulation

 also occurred in the g::'eat majority of China's provinces
 constituted a serious indictment of the Army's perform-
 ance since ordered to intervene in the "cultural revolu-
 tion."                      In view of this poor performance, a 6 April Mili-
 tary Affairs Committee directive (of crucial importance
 in understanding the subsequent course of the "cultural
 revolution" throughout 1967) stripped local military com-
 manders of all real authority in dealing with the "revo-
 lutionary Left," forbidding them to open fire on "mass
 organizations," to label these organizations "counter-
 revolutionary," to make mass arrests, or in general to
 "take any important action", towards these organizations
 without first receiving instructions from Peking.  For
 their part, the "proletarian revolutionaries" were also
 enjoined not to use force against the Army, warned that
 "under no circumstances should the spearhead of struggle
 be directed against the People's Liberation Army."

 The main characteristic of the "cultural revolution"
 in the months which followed was increased antagonism and
 hostility between the Army and the "revolutionary Left."
 "Revolutionary mass organizations" in the provinces and
 major cities launched bitter attacks against local mili-
 tary control committees, both for having suppressed them
 in the past and for failure to support them in the present.
 Local military district commands continued to experience
 great difficulty, as Lin Piao had admitted earlier in a
 30 March speech, in "finding )ut the difference between
 Left and Right" in their dealings with mass organizations.
 As a result, the original timetable for "seizure of power"
 in the provinces had, as admitted by a regime spokesman
 on 5 May, "to be postponed for some tima."
 Since Mao's directives governing the development
 of the "cultural revolution" were by definition correct,
 the failure of the revolution to proceed according to
 plan could only result from faulty execution of these
 directives.   Given the premise of Mao's infallibility,
 the principal issue over which differences of opinion
 would arise within the central leadership in mid-1967
 was whether to assign primary responsibility for this
 adverse development to the People's Liberation Army (its
 failure to identify and provide adequate support to the
 "Leftists") or to the "revolutionary Left" (its refusal
 to unite and observe revolutionary discipline as mani-
 fested in continuing "factionalism" and "anarchism").
 The significance of what has come to be known as
 the "Wuhan Incident" (in essence, an act of insubordina-
 tion by leaders of the Wuhan Military Region Command)
 is that it afforded extremist elements in the central
 leadership an opportunity to focus once again on the
 "mistakes" of the PLA as the primary cause of failures
 and setbacks in Mao's "cultural revolution."  One example
 of what might be called the over-reaction of the central
 leadership to the Wuhan Incident was the decision in early
 August to arm selected Red Guard and "revolutionary rebel"
 units.  When combined with Madame Mao's earlier call to
 Red Guards "to take up arms" under the slogan "attack by
 reason, defend by force," the stage was set for a new form
 of "revolutionary rebellion" directed toward a second

 "seizure of power," this time from the military commanders
 and newly established "revolutionary committees" in a num-
 ber of provinces.  Mao's "cultural revolution" was about
 to enter an "ultra-Leftist" phase, as it would be called
 when the violence and anarchy it unleashed would neces-
 sitate a hasty retreat.
 The results of this sharp turn to the left were
 nearly catastrophic. In foreign policy, a reign of ter-
 ror directed at foreign diplomats was instituted in Pek-
 ing, culminating in the ransacking and burning of the
 British Chancery. More alarming to the leadership in
 Peking was the discovery that, at a time of mounting
 violence and economic disorder, "factionalism" had spread
 from the Red Guards and "revolutionary rebels" into the
 Army.  There was no choice in late August but to apply
 the brakes, pull back, assess the damage, and initiate
 a tend toward moderation in the "cultural revolution"
 which would last throughout the remainder of 1967.
 The unfolding of Mao's "cultural revolution" had
 brought China by the end of August to the brink of anarchy,
 featuring pitched battles by heavily armed factions in
 nearly all of China's provinces.  Recognizing the gravity
 of the situation, Mao's new leadership team in Peking would
 seek to achieve two separate but related objectives in
 the remaining months of 1967:   (1) to carry out a series
 of measures designed to restore minimum levels of public
 order and production; and (2) to dissociate Mao and his
 "cultural revolution" from responsibility for the violence
 and lawlessness endemic in China by finding new scape-
 goats.  The gravity of the crisis was such that for the
 first time it was necessary to sacrifice a number of pro-
 minent members of the Cultural Revolution Group, holding
 them, rather than the policies they were administering,
 responsible for the "nation-wide disturbance" in China.
 This sharp reversal of policy was explained in a
 series of "supreme instructions" issued by Mao Tse-tung
 during the course of an extended tour in September through
 North, Central-South and East China.  Perhaps the most
 important of these "instructions" was that the process
 of setting up a new governmental structure (the "revolutionary

 committees") in all the 29 provinces and major cities of
 China be speeded up and completed by the end of January
 1968.  To meet this deadline, it was no longer possible
 to rely on the long;di-awn-out, cumbrous and generally un-
 successful method of "seizure of power" from below.   In-
 stead, it was necessary to impose solutions from above,
 hammering out agreements in Peking on the basis of Mao's
 directive "to solve the problems of various provinces one
 by one."
 Although the trend toward moderation initiated in
 late August continued, two major components of the effort
 to restore order had run into difficulty by the end of
 the year.  First, the attempt to restore order from below
 by "establishing revolutionary great alliances on the
 basis of trade, profession, department or class in school"
 was foundering because of the refusal of "revolutionary
 mass organizations" in many areas to comply voluntarily
 with this directive.  The undertaking to restore order
 from above by speeding up establishment of a new govern-
 ment structure had also fallen far short of the original
 goal.  The principal reason this program had not pro-
 gressed faster was Mao's insistence that representatives
 of the "revolutionary Left" ne heard in the negotiating
 process and receive genuine representation in the new
 organs of revolutionary power.
 Given these setbacks and failures, it was a fair
 question to ask at the close of 1967 whether the "cultural
 revolution" was coming to an end.   The answer to this
 question, however, depends upon the answer to another,
 more basic question: whether Mao Tse-tung still dominates
 the central party, government and military leadership in
 Peking.  The record of developments in the "cultural revo-
 lution" in 1967 demonstrates, it is believed, that Mao
 remained in charge throughout, initiating or at least
 approving all changes in policy, including the sudden re-
 treat toward moderation in late August forced by objective
 circumstances.   These circumstances--principally a damaged
 economy, a disturbed Army, a fragmented "revolutionary
 Left," a breakdown of party and government machinery, and
 the consequent threat of anarchy--forced Mao to call a
 halt to the destructive, rnasm phase of his "cultural

 revolution" and press ahead with the construction of a
 new "revolutionary" government and party apparatus.
 This shift in strategy should not be construed,
 however, as a change in basic goals.   In the eyes of Mao,
 the "cultural revolution"--as the ultimate expression
 of his views on the nature of man and society--can never
 end.   As long as Mao Tse-tung continues to dominate the
 leadership in Peking, the "great proletarian cultural
 revolution" will continue in Communist China.

 MAO'S "CULTURAL REVOLUTION" IN 1967:   THE
 STRUGGLE TO "SEIZE POWER"
 "The aim of every revolutionary struggle in
 the world is the seizure and consolidation
 of political power." --Mao Tse-tung
 In January 1967, Communist China's "great proletar-
 ian cultural revolution" entered a new stagle--a stage of
 violent overthrow of all those in positions of authority
 in the party and government who refused to accept Mao Tse-
 tung's new "revolutionary" order.   Erupting in Shanghai
 under the name of the "January Revolution." this frenzied
 drive to "seize power" initiated a period of nation-wide
 violence and disorder which persists to the present day.
 Although implicit in what had gone before, the
 strident call to "seize power" suddenly transformed the
 "cultural revolution' from an effort to reform the exist-
 ing structure of power into an all-out assault against
 the power structure itself.  As originally envisaged by
 Mao Tse-tung, this revolutionary act of "seizure of power
 from bdlpw" was to have resulted in the creation of a new
 revolutionary power structure dominated by his "revolu-
 tionary Leftist" supporters and modeled after the Paris
 Commune.   As the ultimate expression of Mao's "mass-line"
 approach to politics,,'this undbrtaking to rely on the
 "revolutionary masses" to create a viable substitute for
 a "bureaucratic" party and government apparatus was prob-
 ably doomed from the outset.
 Factionalism, more than any other single factor,
 would undermine Mao's grand design to mobilize the forces
 of the "revolutionary Left" to "seize power" from his
 enemies in 1967.   Explaining late in the year why th;i
 movement had failed, Premier Chou En-lai would point'to

 alternating "seizures" and "counter-seizures" of power by
 contending "factions" as having produced a situation in
 which "seizure of power became surrender of power and
 power could not be retained."  Because of "factionalism"
 in the ranks of tt,c; "revolutionary Left", it had bsen
 necessary to relinquish the power "seized" to military
 control committees set up in nearly all provin.'es and
 major cities by the People's Liberation Army.
 Although not mentioned by Chou, another important
 product of Mao's call to "seize power" from below would
 be to f.nculcate contempt among Red Guards and "revolution-

 authority of new "revolutionary" institutions and even
 that of the Party Center.  The net effect of the struggle
 to "seize power" in 1967 would be to diminish, rather

 Communist China.

 Al:itough the 8 August 1966 Central Committee deci-

 "opposition"* was analyzed and explained by Chen Po-ta
 (Head of the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central
 Committee) at an important party work conference held
 in Peking in October.  The principal opposition, accord-
 ing to Chen, had come from provincial party secretaries
 who, "afraid of losing their positions and prestige...,
 instigated workers and peasants to fight against the
 students."
 The provincial party and government apparatus had
 been able to repulse the first attack by Red Gu:,rds in
 August and September by mobilizing workers and peasants
 in their defense?   To prevent this from happening again,
 it was necessary for the Maoists to infiltrate and take
 over these opposition strongholds.   This campaign began
 immediately after the October work conference, with the
 formation of new "revolutionary rebel" organizations in
 industrial and mining establishments, party and govern-
 ment organs, and, to a lesser extent, among the peasantry.
 The expansion of the "cultural revolution" into the govern-
 mentand the economy would engender increasing resistance
 which, in turn, would lead to a final test of strength
 when Mao would exhort his supporters to "seize power" in
 all those party, government and economic organizations
 which continued to resist.
 If the expansion of the "cultural revolution" in
 November and December to cover industry and the country-
 side was intended primarily to re-establish Mao's control
 over the provinces,  there was a parallel escalation and
 *The term "opposition" is an unfortunate one, since
 it suggests conscious resistance to Mao's directives con-

 understood the vague and contradictory guidelines laid
 down to govern the "cultural revolution" or have acted
 in self-defense.

 extension of the revolution at the center encompassing
 the party, government and military control apparatus in
 Peking.   In a major spee::h to a Red Guard rally on 18
 December, Chiang Ching (Deputy Head of the Cultural Revo-
 lution Group and, of greater importance; Mao Tse-tung's
 wife) charged that the municipal public security bureau
 had been largely responsible for recent bloody clashes
 in Peking.   Describing the bureau, along with the Supreme
 People's Pro curatorate and the Supreme People's Court,
 as "bourgeois" in nature, she then called upon the Red
 Guards in her audience to 'rise up in rebellion" and "take
 over' these government organs.   she movement to "seize
 power" from below by calling upon the 'revolutionary Left"
 to take over government and party organs nad begun.
 On 26 December, addressing the newly-organized
 "All China Red Workers General Rebellion Corps," Madame
 Mao (together with Chen Po-ta) endorsed the recent "sei-
 zure" of the Ministry of Labor by this "revolutionary
 rebel" organization, as well as its intention to take
 over the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.   With this
 call to the "revolutionary Left" to seize control of China's
 labor organizations, the stage was set for the outbreak
 in Shanghai of what has come to be known as the "January
 Revolution"--the Maoist drive to "seize power" in the
 party and government apparatus on a nation-wide scale.
 The "January Revolution" in Shanghai resulted in
 a Pyrrhic victory.   Instead of winning over Shanghai's
 million-odd workers, it antagonized a large proportion
 of them, precipitating a large-scale strike which for a
 time crippled the economy of Shanghai_  This in turn re-
 sulted in the complete paralysis and breakdown of local
 government and necessitated a premature, disorderly "sei-
 zure of power" in Shanghai for which Mao's "revolution-
 ary rebels" were ill-prepared,
 It is important to understand the nature of the
 "opposition" generated in Shanghai at this time for it
 was to be duplicated in nearly all major cities and pro-
 vinces, becoming so widespread and tenacious that the
 "seize power" movement in China would soon grind to a
 halt.   Although depicted in every case as the product

 of "base and sinister tricks" played by the "handful" of
 Mao's enemies, the actions of the "opposition" at this
 time were in most cases taken by organizations and groups
 who considered themselves to be loyal supporters of Mao
 and the "cultural revolution."  This was true even of
 the general strike carried out in late December by Shang-
 hai's railroad, harbor and public utility workers, a strike
 motivated primarily by political grievances directed not
 at Mao but at the violence and radicalism of young "revo-
 lutionary rebel" workers in that city.
 Other strikes in Shanghai and elsewhere at this
 time were motivated by economic grievances.  But instead
 of being provoked by "reactionary elements" (as alleged
 in the important 12 January Red Flag editorial, "Oppose
 Economism and Smash the Latest Counterattack by the Bour-
 geois Reactionary Line"), these strikes were the direct
 result of exhortations by Madame Mao (in the 26 December
 speech noted above) to large numbers of contract workers,
 temporary workers, and apprentice workers to rise up
 against the "political oppression and economic exploita-
 tion" to which they had been subjected by Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping and all others responsible for foist-
 ing these revisionist, capitalist systems on China's work-
 ing class.   As Madame Mao put it, these "contract and
 temporary workers have suffered the most...and therefore
 their spirit of revolt is the greatest."  But when they
 rose in revolt, demanding an end to the low-wage policy
 which was a common feature of all these systems, they were
 then told that they had been "deceived" and "hoodwinked"
 into following the "evil road of economism" and were "pur-
 suing only personal and short-term interests."
 Another form of "economism" (defined as "the con-
 spiracy of using the 'sugar-coated bullets' of economic
 ben_efits...to corrupt the masses revolutionary will") at
 this time in Shanghai and elsewhere was the payment of
 year-end bonuses and of travel allowances to enable large
 numbers of "revolutionary workers" to go to Peking to
 engage in the "large-scale exchange of revolutionary
 experience," as the student Red Guards had done before
 them.   The responsibility for this unexpected development
 must also be borne in large part by'.the Maoists themselves.

 On the one hand, party and government cadres in the indus-
 trial (also agricultural) sector were accused of "exploit-
 ing" and suppressing the workers.   On the other hand, the
 workers were invited to rise up in rebellion against these
 revisionist, capitalist systems of "exploitation" and,
 if need be, to carry their grievances to higher authorities.
 Having effectively undermined the authority of the local
 cadres (who quickly succombed to worker demands for travel
 funds and economic benefits), the Maoists then accused
 them (in the words of Chou En-lai) of engaging in a "big
 lot to pass the burden of all kinds of contradictions
 ~i.e. problems] up to us."
 The Maoists were confronted with a number of serious
 problems as they took stock of the "cultural revolution"
 in mid-January 1967.  First, more than a million workers
 had descended on Peking to protest their "exploitation"
 by local party and government cadres.   Next, there were
 reports of widespread disorder and bloody clashes in a
 number of cities and provinces where "revolutionary rebels"
 were rising up to "seize power" in response to Mao's call
 to emulate the example of Shanghai.   Also, the prelimin-
 ary results of the "new stage" of extending the "cultural
 revolution" into factories and mines were at hand, results
 which showed that both revolution and production in the
 industrial sector had been adversely affected by sending
 in "revolutionary students" without adequate preparations.
 Finally, reports on the progress of the "seize
 power" movement in Shanghai revealed growing chaos follow-
 ing the breakdown of party and government controls in that
 city.   What had been hailed just a few days previously as
 a "brilliant example" was now repudiated as a model for
 general emulation.   Addressing a workers rally on 15 Janu-
 ary, both Chou En-lai and Chen Po-ta stressed that "sei-
 zure and control of everything... as has been done in Shang-
 hai" was "not good" and was not to be repeated in Peking.
 Indeed what had happened in Shanghai was now depicted as
 but another example of "plotting" by the enemy, who wanted
 "to wreck the social order and the process of production
 and thereby make us a laughing stock" by "withdrawing
 behind the scenes while allowing you to place all organi-
 zations under your seizure and control."  Rather than

 the formula of "seizure and control," Chou and Chen ad-
 vocated the "supervision formula" as "much better and' 'more
 practical"--that is, keeping party-and government cadres
 on the job under "supervision" by the "revolutionary
 rebels."
 Another of the difficulties involved in taking over
 power in Shanghai (as noted by Chou in an 18 January
 speech) was the inability of "revolutionary workers, peas-
 ants and intellectuals" to achieve "unity."   Indeed, the
 failure of the "revolutionary Left" to achieve "great
 unity" was denounced in a series of statements at this
 time, not only by Chou and Chen Po-ta but also by Madame
 Mao and even by Mao himself, statements decrying the
 phenomena of "anarchism," "departmentalism," "sectarian-
 ism," "splitting," "small-group mentality" and "ultra-
 democracy" which characterized the behavior of "revolu-
 tionary rebels" generally throughout the country.   Having
 succeeded in the destructive task of overthrowing the
 party and government control apparatus, the "revolution-
 ary rebels" had failed in the constructive task of estab-
 lishing a "new revolutionary order."
 Efforts to Restore Order (Early 1967)

 in the Cultural Revolution...but now that the
 class struggle has sharpened,;.  the Army must
 support the 'Leftists'  ..Most old cadres still
 do not understand the Cultural Revolution."
 --Mao Tse-tung, Speech at Military Affairs
 Committee Plenum, 20 or 21 January, 1967.
 The havoc created by Mao's "revolutionary rebels"
 in their frenzied drive to "seize power" during the "Jan-
 uary Revolution" required immediate and drastic counter-
 measures.  The first of these was the decision of 23 Jan-
 uary ordering the Peoplels Liberation Army to intervene
 in the "cultural revolution," directed to support the out-
 numbered and disorganized forces of the "revolutionary

 Left."  The second was a shift in policy toward party
 cadres, emphasizing more humane treatment and rehabilita-
 tion to make use of their administrative skills.   The
 third was an effort to overcome the pronounced tendency
 toward "anarchism" which had characterized the behavior
 of the "Revolutionary Left" during the "January Revolu-
 tion", an effort to reorganize, retrench and rectify the
 ranks of the "revolutionary rebels."
 Finally, the decision was taken by Mao personally
 to jettison the Shanghai example in favor of a new model
 for emulation in the "seize power" movement throughout
 China--that provided by the "formation of a three-way al-
 liance to seize power" in the province of Heilungkiang.
 Whereas the "revolutionary rebels" had played the dominant
 role in Shanghai, they were now to share their power (in
 fact, the greater part of their power) with two new "al-
 lies," the People's Liberation Army and "revolutionary
 party cadres."
 The new, dominant role of the military in the govern-
 ment and administration of China would be revealed in dis-
 cussions of the course of the "seize power" movement in
 February.   Although at first the fiction was maintained
 that "revolutionary rebels" were leading the way in form-
 ing the new "three-way alliance to seize power," (d.g.
 in Heilungkiang province), this pretense was dropped in
 a 23 February Red Flag article describing the "seizure
 of power" in Slians rovince.   Here it was made clear
 that the PLA had taken the initiative throughout, dictat-
 ing'its will and imposing the cadres it had selected upon
 the representatives of the "revolutionary Left."  In those
 provinces (the great majority) where for various reasons
 the "seize power movement" had bogged down, the PLA was
 directed to establish military control commissions charged
 with maintaining law and order.   As the only remaining
 nation-wide organization still intact, the PLA perforce
 had to step in to replace the now largely defunct party
 and government control apparatus.
 For the same reason, the PLA was soon deeply in-
 volved in administering China's economy.  On 22 February,
 the Army was directed to restore order in the countryside

 by supervising the organization of peasants and rural
 cadres to carry out spring planting.   A month later the
 Central Committee directed workers and cadres in factories
 and mines to "cooperate effectively with the comrades
 from the PLA" who were being sent to'lgupport their work
 in industrial production."  The further disclosure in
 March that PLA personnel had been sent in large numbers
 to conduct military and ideological training in univ6r-
 sities and schools showed the extent of influence and
 control exercised by the military in China in the early
 months of 1967.
 The problem of finding "new leaders" or "revolu-
 tionary leading cadres"--the second component of the "three-
 way alliance"--was an acute one, described by a leading
 member of the Cultural Revolution Group (Wang Li) in early
 February as "the biggest problem now."   In successive Red
 Flag editorials of 3 and 23 February drafted under the
 personal supervision of Mao himself, the problem of "treat-
 ing cadres correctly" received priority attention.   As
 emphasized in these editorials and accompanying comment-
 ary by regime spokesmen, the "revolutionary rebels" in
 Shanghai and elsewhere had gone too far, "opposing, ex-
 cluding and overthrowing all cadres indiscriminately."
 In the graphic description by Wang Li, "all that remained
 after the 'seizure of power' were some vacant offices and
 stamps."  The most serious problem facing the Maoists in
 the wake of the "January Revolution" was that it had suc-
 ceeded too well, destroying the party and government con-
 trol apparatus without providing an effective substitute.
 The end result, as regime spokesmen emphasized, was
 "anarchy", a situation aggravated by rivalry and clashes
 between "revolutionary mass organizations" acting (as the
 23 February Red Flag editorial put it) like "a host of
 dragons without -a-leader."
 To deal with this alarming situation, the regime
 instituted what would subsequently be referred to as Mao's
 "mild cadre policy."  Reaffirming the original line taken
 in the central committee decision of 8 August on the
 "cultural revolution," this policy called first of all
 for "correct treatment" and "support" of "revolutionary

 leading cadres," defined as "those leading cadres who fol-
 low the proletarian revolutionary line represented by
 Chairman Mao."  The examplar of this category in the pro-
 vinces was Pan Fu-sheng, the former party first secretary
 in Heilungkiang province who had stepped forward to join
 the "revolutionary Left" during the "cultural revolution"
 and had been rewarded by a position of leadership in the
 new "revolutionary committee" established there.   Described
 as "more mature politically...,more experienced in strug-
 gle..., and having greater organizational skill" than the
 "young revolutionary fighters," these revolutionary cadres
 were "to act as the core of leadership" both in the "sei-
 zure of power" and in the exercise of this power by the
 new "revolutionary committees."
 Indeed, the time had come for the young militants
 of the "revolutionary Left"--the third component of the
 "three-way alliance"--to take their lumps, now blamed for
 the chaos of the "January Revolution" which they had been
 incited to carry out.   They were attacked and criticized
 from all directions, not just by the relative moderates
 (like Chou En-lai) but also by the zealots in the Cultural
 Revolution Group and even by Mao himself.   Among the crit-
 icisms leveled by Mao at his "little revolutionary gen-
 erals" at this time were (1) that they were being "cor-
 rupted" by "money" and "cars;"  (2) that they "called for
 criticism after criticism and took part in too many ral-
 lies;" and (3) that they had been guilty of "sectarianism"
 and "splittism" and must endeavor to "achieve unity" even
 with those who held "contrary opinions."  Adding to this
 inp$ctment, Chi Pen-yu of the Cultural Revolution Group
 criticized Kuai Ta-fu and Nieh Yuan-tzu (the two most
 prominent Red Guard leaders in Peking) for "hanging out
 the signboard of the Peking Revolutionary Rebel Commune"
 prematurely and without permission, a charge which would
 serve to explain the disappearance at'this time of the
 ill-fated and short-lived Shanghai Commune.
 In addition to these verpal attacks, a number of
 measures were instituted at this time in a concerted ef-
 fort to retrench, reorganize and rectify the unruly ranks
 of the "revolutionary Left."

 Next, reorganization of the Red Guard
 s was
 effected in Peking by merging the three former.1y independ-
 ent Red Guard "headquarters" into a single "ReC Guard
 Congress."     Speeches at the rally proclaiming this Con-
 gress, moreover, suggested an intent to establish similar
 congresses in all major cities and provinces, with the
 ultimate goal of forming a national organization.
 Finally, it was announced that Red Guards on re-
 turning to their schools would have to undergo "rectifi-
 cation"--"a painful process of protracted ideological
 struggle"--in order to overcome their "tendencies of
 departmentalism, small group mentality, ultra-democracy,
 individualism and anarchism..."  And with the disclosure
 that the PLA would supervise this "rectification" campaign
 in China's schools and universities, it was clear that
 the "revolutionary Left" was being disciplined for the
 excesses it had committed during the "January Revolution."
 As a result of the urgent need to restore order
 and maintain production, the "seize power" movement in
 China at the end of February was in a state of suspended
 animation.   Only Shanghai and the four provinces of Heilung-
 kiang, Kweichow, Shansi and Shantung had succeeded in set-
 ting up "revolutionary committees" approved by the central
 leadership as fulfilling the requirements of a genuine
 tripartite alliance of revolutionaries, party cadres and
 the army.   In a major summing up of the progress of the
 "cultural revolution," a 9 March editorial in Red Flag
 entitled "On the Revolutionary 3-in-1 Combination" revealed
 what these requirements wore.  Citing a directive by Chair-
 man Mao that these "provisional organs of power" would
 have to be "revolutionary and representative and have pro-
 letarian authority," this editorial discussed candidly
 the problems which had obstructed, and would continue to
 obstruct, the effort by Mao's "proletarian revolutionaries"
 to "seize power" in China.

 The dominant theme of the editorial was that all
 three components of the alliance--the leaders of revolu-
 tionary mass organizations, representatives of the PLA,
 and revolutionary leading cadres--were essential, as
 expressed in the injunction not "to overlook or under-
 estimate the role of any one of them."  Of particular
 concern was the practice of "excluding" or "regarding
 as secondary" the role of "leaders of the revolutionary
 mass organizations," who, although guilty of "shortcomings
 and errors," still constituted "the base of the revolu-
 tionary 3-in-1 provisional organ of power."  Reiterating
 the policy on party cadres laid down the preceding month,
 the editorial stressed the importance of the role of the
 "revolutionary cadres" (that of providing "the nucleus
 and backbone" of the new "revolutionary committee") while
 holding forth the prospect of redemption and "proper jobs"
 for the broad mass of cadres who had made "mistakes".
 What was new In the discussion of cadre policy, however,
 was a call for vigilance against "class enemies" who were
 "distorting" the principles governing the formation of
 "3-in-1" organs of power to "impose" on the masses cadres
 who "persisted in their mistakes" and thus "carry out
 counterrevolutionary restoration."
 The editorial's discussion of the PLA revealed
 that it too was experiencing difficulties in playing its
 "extremely important role" in the struggle to seize power.
 Admitting the existence of "dissension between the revo-
 lutionary masses and the PLA," the editorial attempted
 once again to blame this on the "intrigues" of class
 enemies.  More to the point, it revealed that the PLA was
 having a hard time carrying out the ambiguous directive
 by Chairman Mao "to actively support the revolutionary
 Leftists," conceding that "some comrades in the local army
 units may commit temporary mistakes in giving their sup-
 port because of the intricate and complex conditions of
 the class struggle."

 The Resurgence of the Left (Spring 1967)
 "A big question now confronting the
 people of the whole country is whether to
 carry the great proletarian cultural revo-
 lution through to the end, or to abandon
 it halfway." --Red flag Editorial, "On the
 Revolutionary Tnree in One Combination,"
 9 March 1967.
 In the same editorial's allusion to mounting op-
 position lies the explanation, it is believed, for the
 next phase of Mao's "cultural revolution" which would
 extend through March and much of April.  The principal
 characteristic of the new phase would be the resurgence
 of the "revolutionary Left," incited once again to
 criticize and attack the opposition and thus maintain
 revolutionary momentum.   In Mao's view, the pendulum
 had swung too far in the direction of order and stability
 imposed by the PLA and party cadres from above and it
 was necessary once again to stress the role of the revo-
 lutionary masses.
 The first target of attack by militant Red Guards
 and "revolutionary rebels," unleashed again in early
 March, was what was termed the "countercurrent of counter-
 revolutionary restoration" in central government organs.
 This referred to the practice of "false power seizure"
 whereby senior party cadres or revived party committees
 had exploited, so it was charged, Mao's "mild cadre policy"
 to reinstate all or most of the old officials and systems
 of control, at the same time ignoring and suppressing the
 opinions of the "revolutionary Left."  The ring-leader
 of the new "counterrevolutionary current" was Vice Premier
 Tan Chen-lin, charged with perpetrating sham seizures in
 agricultural departments, but heavy criticism was also
 leveled at three more "Vice Preiiers--Chen I, Li Fu-chun
 and Li Hsien--nien, specialists in foreign affairs, econom-
 ics and finance respectively.   Although defending the last
 three of his Vice Premiers against these charges, Chou
 En-lai, in addressing a March rally of "revolutionary rebels"

 in industry and transportation, also attac!ced this "tend-
 ency of rehabilitating all cadres, disregarding their
 previous offenses,' characterizing it as an "extremely
 grave" mistake and as the "main danger" at that time.
 Chou also revealed in this speech that this phenomenon
 of "false power seizures" had appeared not only in "cen-
 tral offices" but in "the p ovinces" as well.
 The fact that these "false power seizures" had
 been widespread, occurring in the great majority of China's
 provinces, constituted a serious indictment of the Army's
 performance since ordered to intervene in late January
 to "support the Left" in the "cultural revolution "`
 What had happened
 was that the "revolutionary Left," instead of forming a
 "great alliance," had split into two "factions."  When
 the first of these had "seized power" and been recognized
 and supported by the local military command, the other
 faction had then attempted a "counter-seizure," attacking
 not only the newly-established "revolutionary" regime but
 the People's Liberation Army as well.  Reacting to this
 attack, the local military commander had opened fire in
 self-defense and suppressed the attacking faction as a
 "counter-revolutionary organization."

 At the same time that its power was being sharply
 curtailed, the PLA was ordered to establish military con-
 trol committees and thereby assume responsibility for
 exercising "the provincial leadership power" until such
 time as new Revolutionary Committees approved by the Cen-
 ter (i.e. genuine "power seizures") could be created.
 Regional and provincial military commands were also
 directed at this time to "rectify immediately" all of
 their previous errors in dealing with the "Left," releas-
 ing all those previously arrested, rehabilitating all
 those previously labeled "counter-revolutionary" and, in
 general, seeking the forgiveness of the "revolutionary
 masses" for their wrong conduct.   The net effect of this
 series of decisions in late March and early April was to
 place an almost intolerable burden on the PLA, subjecting
 it to severe pressure and strain at the very moment it
 was being ordered to take over the responsibility for
 governing the country and administering the economy.
 A key ingredient in this new revolutionary upsurge,
 as in earlier ones  was to escalate the attack against
 Liu Shao-chi, to launch (according to an important 8 April
 People's Daily ed'torial) "a powerful general offensive
 against the number one party person in authority taking
 the capitalist road."  New features of this intensified
 campaign in early April were (1) public humiliation at
 a struggle rally where, nevertheless, Liu continued to
 deny his guilt as a criminal or counter-revolutionary;
 (2) wall-poster demands (allegedly citing Kang Sheng and
 Chi Pen-yu) that Liu be put to death for his "betrayal
 and collusion with a foreign power;" and (3) a barrage
 of criticism of Liu's leading theoretical work "How To
 Be a Good Communist," condemned by Mao, Lin Piao, Chou
 En-lai and other top leaders at this time as "anti-
 Marxist."
 The basic purpose of this "general offensive"
 against Liu Shao-chi was an attempt once again to form
 a "great alliance" of the "revolutionary Left" (which
 had split into rival factions in the disorderly struggle
 to "seize power" in January) and, following this, an
 attempt once again to form genuine "three-way alliances"
 (which had been dominated by the Army and old-line cadres

 at the expense of the "revolutionary Left" in February
 and March).   The first objective of "great unity" was
 to be achieved by inciting the revoluticnary masses to
 undertake "great criticism and great struggle" not only
 against Liu but also against the "handful" of Mao's
 enemies in "each area, department and unit" throughout
 the country, depicted as the supporters of Liu who had
 to be overthrown in order to bring him down.   The second
 objective was to be achieved by leashing the Army and
 exerting new pressure on party cadres to step forward in
 support of the revolution, both by offering a way out for
 repentant cadres (by joining in the attack against Liu
 Shao-chi and his alleged supporters) and by threatening
 dire consequences should they refuse.   Political and
 ideological struggle against a common target would serve,
 it was thought, to unify and strengthen the ranks of Mao's
 "proletarian revolutionaries."
 Instead, the result of leashing the PLA while un-
 leashing the "revolutionary Left" was renewed violence
 and disorder.   Serious, large-scale clashes were soon
 reported not only in the provinces but in Peking as well.
 Developments in Peking provide a good case study of the
 chaos and disruption attending the new violent phase of
 Mao's "cultural revolution" in April and May.
 In brief, what happened was that the Red Guards
 and "revolutionary rebels" utilized their new freedom of
 action to attack one another and, for good measure, the
 PLA as   'ell.  According to wall-poster reports, a large
 force of Red Guards invaded Peking University to demon-
 strate against Nieh Yuan-tzu, chairman of the recently
 tnified Peking Congress of Red Guards, charging her with
 incompetence and a selfish desire "to gain high office."
 When an "armed clash" developed and Peking garrison troops
 were sent to restore order, the Red Guards then directed
 their attack at the Peking garrison deputy commander.
 Instances of worker "revolutionary rebels" defying and
 even seizing PLA representatives were also reported in
 Peking at this time.  As a result, leaders of the Cultural
 Revolution Group headed by Madame Mao convened a series
 of meetings in mid-April between feuding Red Guard and
 "revolutionary rebel" groups to chastize them for attack-
 ing the PLA and for engaging in "unprincipled civil wars."

 The fact that these "unprincipled civil wars" broke
 out on the eve of the establishment of the Peking Municipal
 Revolutionary Committee goes far to explain the nat"ire of
 this new type of warfare in China.   As opposed to -st1e
 "principled" variety fought largely on ideological and
 political grounds, these wars are fought to determine who
 gets what share of the spoils in the new revolutionary
 order.   It was ironic that the formal proclamation on 20
 April of the new Peking Revolutionary Committee--in theory
 representing the achievement of a genuine and harmonious
 "three-way alliance"--should have been the occasion for
 intensified conflict within and among the components of
 this alliance.
 Calls for Order Again (May-June 1967)
 "Recently our great leader Chairman
 Mao instructed us that we should trust in
 and rely on the masses, trust in and rely
 on the People's Liberation Army, and trust
 in and rely on the majority of the cadres.
 Chairman Mao also called on us to support
 the army and cherish the people."  --People's
 Daily Editorial, "Further Strengthen the
 Unity Between the Army and the People,"
 12 May 1967
 The disclosure in a 12 May People's Daily editorial
 that the People's Liberation Army was 'resolutely carry-
 ing out the five tasks of supporting the Left, support-
 ing industry, supporting agriculture, exercising military
 control, and helping in military and political training"
 merely confirmed what had already become abundantly
 clear--that the Army was now governing most of China in
 ?                 place of the discredited, largely defunct party and
 government apparatus.   In its party role, military con-
 trol committees at all levels (provincial, county, muni-
 cipal and even down to the level of individual enterprises
 and communes) were charged with leading the "cultural
 revolution," held responsible for the creation of "true
 proletarian revolutionary great alliances" and of revolu-
 tionary "three-way alliances."  This was a delicate

 political task for which, lacking guidance from Peking,
 it was singularly ill-prepared.   In its government role,
 the Army was responsible for administering the economy
 and for maintaining order, the latter task rendered ally impossible by
 prohibiting the use of force.
 the Army
 in dealing with the revolutionary masses was "to learn
 to do mass work, trust the masses, rely on them and con-
 sult with them on important matters...to skillfully adopt
 means of persuasion and education instead of adopting
 simple and crude means of issuing orders."  For their
 part, the "proletarian revolutionaries" were also enjoined
 not to use force against the Army (e.g. the demand in the
 8 May Red Flag editorial that "On no occasion and under
 no circumstances should the spear head of struggle be
 directed against the People's Liberation Army.")
 Instead of mutual trust and cooperation, however,
 the principal characteristic of the "cultural revolution"
 in the months which followed was increased antagonism
 and hostility between the Army and the "revolutionary
 Left."  In fact, neither performed according to Mao's
 high expectations.   Instead of increased strength through
 greater unity, there was a further splitting of the revo-
 lutionary ranks, a split brought on (according to Hsieh
 Fu-chih in a 7 May speech) by those demanding "a great
 shakeup, great differentiation and great reorganization
 inside the Left wing."   Instead of supporting Army com-
 manders, "revolutionary mass organizations" in the pro-
 vinces and major cities launched bitter attacks against
 local military control committees, both for having sup-
 pressed them in the past and for failure to support them.
 in the present.   For their part, local military district
 commands continued to experience great difficulty, as
 Lih Piao had admitted earlier in a 30 March speech, in
 "finding out the difference between Lett and Right" in
 their dealings with mass organizations.
 Mao's solution to this problem, the single most
 important cause of tension between the military and the
 "revolutionary Left," was typical.  On 7 May, the dhairman

 directed Lin Piao to carry out an intensive two week "recti-
 fication" campaign in the Army, a summin  up (according a 15 June Liberation Army Daily editorial) of itsex-
 perience in the struggle to "support the Left" during the
 previous stage "in order to develop new merit, correct
 mistakes, and carry on the battle." Central to this
 campaign was the demand that local military commanders
 atone for their past errors by engaging publicly in "self-
 criticism," thereby securing the forgiveness and winning
 the trust of those "proletarian revolutionaries" whom they
 had previously wronged. Responding to this demand, the
 Shantung Provincial Military District Party Committee is-
 sued a public "self-criticism" on 31 May, a document which
 Mao enthusiastically endorsed as a model for general emula-
 tion.   Of particular interest was the admission in this
 document that the decision to issue the "self-criticism"
 had sparked a "heated argument," with some arguing that
 such an action "would dampen the morale of the armed forces...
 might upset the armed forces...[and]...that the masses
 might use it against us."
 An a guide for the prevention of new "mistakes"
 by the Army, the Tsinghai military district commander Liu
 Hsien-chuan published a lengthy article in People's Daily
 in early June summarizing his successful experience in
 identifying and supporting the "Left" in Tsinghai Province.
 Although admitting that there had been "complicated strug-
 gle" and "all sorts of factions," Liu asserted that there
 were basically only "two kinds of factions" which could
 be clearly differentiated--a "Leftist" faction which "wants
 to revolt" and a "conservative" faction which "wants to
 conserve."  Having conducted "investigation and study among
 the masses," he had been able to identify as genuinely
 "Leftist" those organizations which had first rebelled
 against, criticized and attacked "the handful of persons
 in the provincial party committee who were in authority
 and taking the capitalist road."  The "conservative" or-
 ganizations, on the other hand, had been "controlled by"
 and had sought -to protect this "handful' of Mao's oppon-
 ents within the Party.

 Liu's account of developments in Tsinghai had om-
 mitted one important fact--that his predecessor in command
 of the Tsinghai Provincial Military District had arrived
 at exactly the opposite conclusion in his investigation
 work and had been singled out for attack in the 6 April
 Military Affairs Committee directive as a "counter-revolu-
 tionary" who had "carried out savage, armed repression
 of revolutionary mass organizations."  That it was danger-
 ous for a provincial military commander to decide on his
 own which mass organizations were "Leftist" was the most
 important lesson of the Tsinghai experience
 the disclosure in early May
 that fighting between rival mass organizations had entered
 a new stage of "armed struggle."  The extent of the new
 disorder in Peking was revealed by Hsieh Fu-chih, in a
 speech on 14 May.  As reported in a wall poster, Hsieh
 disclosed that production had declined seven precept in
 April, a decline due chiefly to "armed struggles" but also
 to worker protest strikes.   In the first ten days of May,
 according to Hsieh, there had been 133 armed struggles
 and bloody incidents involving more than 63,000 people
 of which a "two-figure" number were killed.   In addition,
 cases of beating, destroying, looting, searching houses
 and illegal arrest had been common and were increasing.
 Not long before, on 5 May, Hsieh Fu-chih had revealed
 in a speech to students at Peking University that "armed
 struggles at factories, schools and various organs" were
 taking place not only in Peking but in many provinces as
 well.  Despite the fact that "conservative factions" (the
 opposition) had not yet been defeated in various provinces,
 the "Leftists" there (as in Peking) had begun to "break

 to criticism and attack by the masses was "to do poli-
 tical and ideological work patiently among them."
 As viewed from Peking, the status of the "great
 proletarian cultural revolution" in mid-1967 was far from
 encouraging.   Since February, only one new area, Peking,
 had been "liberated" by Mao's revolutionaries.  The new
 revolutionary upsurge initiated in April had come to naught,
 the "seize power" movement had bogged down, and, even
 more alarming, the forces of the "revolutionary Left" had,
 as admitted by Hsieh Fu-chih in a 12 June speech to Red
 Guards, grown weaker rather than stronger in many places,
 even in those provinces (such as Heilungkiang) where new
 "revolutionary" organs of power had already been estab-
 lished.   Since Maors directives governing the development
 of the "cultural revolution" were by definition correct,
 the failure of the revolution to proceed according to
 plan could only result from faulty execution of these
 directives.   Given the premise of Mao's infallibility,
 the principal issue over which differences of opinion
 would arise within the central leadership at this time,
 then, was whether to assign primary responsibility for this
 adverse development to the People's Liberation Army (its
 failure to identify and provide adequate support to the
 "Leftists") or to the "revolutionary Left"  (its refusal
 to unite and observe revolutionary discipline as manifested
 in continuing "factionalism" and "anarchism.")
 The disclosure that differences of opinion had
 arisen within the central leadership was made by Hsieh
 Fu-chih in the 12 June speech noted above, when he referred
 to "heated discussions within the Central Committee in-
 ner circle occurring every day."  Although Hsieh did not
 reveal the substance of these discussions nor identify
 the participants, it is a fair inference (based both on
 the previous record of the "cultural revolution" and on
 subsequent developments) that these differences concerned
 the conflicting claims of restoring order and and main-
 taining revolutionary momentum, with one group (i.e. Chou
 En-lai representing the government and presumably spokes-
 men for the military) arguing the need to restore order
 and another group (i.e. such leading members of the Cul-
 tural Revolution Group as Madame Mao, Chen Po-ta, and

 Kang Sheng) advocating a more militant policy in support
 of the "revolutionary Left."
 One outcome of this debate was the decision to send
 a number of high-level government and military delegations
 to investigate and provide guidance on the conduct of the
 "cultural revolution" in the provinces.   A major objective
 of the delegations sent out at this time was to put an
 and to the armed struggle which had broken out between
 contending factions and between these factions and local
 military commands.  The means for achieving this objective
 was a six-point formula advanced by the Central Committee
 under which representatives of both factions agreed (1) to
 stop breaking into military organs, assaulting Army of-
 ficials, stealing weapons, and attacking each other; and
 (2) by means of "rectification" and "self-criticism," to
 form "great revolutionary alliances."  When agreements
 to this effect were negotiated in Yunnan and Anhwei in
 late June and early July, it appeared that Mao's "cultural
 revolution" had once again entered a more moderate phase,
 marked by a concerted effort to damp down violent struggle
 and reduce the antagonism which had arisen between Army
 commanders in the provinces and the "revolutionary Left."
 The Wuhan Incident (July-August 1967)
 "At present a large-scale movement for
 criticizing and repudiating the handful of
 top party and military persons in authority
 taking the capitalist road is sweeping over
 the whole country.   This is the general
 orientation of the struggle."  --Red Flag
 Editorial, "The Proletariat Must firmly Grasp
 the Barrel of the Gun," 31 July 1967
 The significa::ce of what has come to be known as
 the "Wuhan Incident" is that it sharply reversed this trend
 toward moderation, precipitating a short-lived "ultra-
 Leftist" phase of the "cultural revolution" extending
 from late July through most of August.  The Wuhan Incident

 afforded extremist elements in the central leadership an
 opportunity, which they were quick to exploit, to focus
 once again on the "mistakes" of the People's Liberation
 Army as the primary cause of failures and setbacks in
 Mau's "cultural revolution." it was seized upon as a
 pretext for launching another great revolutionary upsurge
 from below, for exhorting the Red Guards and "revolution-
 ary rebels" to rise up against their oppressors wherever
 encountered, whether in the military, the new "revoluion-
 ary committees," or in the central government.  The end
 result of this ill-advised venture was near anarchy and
 a further discrediting and weakening of the forces of the
 revolutionary Left.
 In bare outline, the story of the Wuhan Incident
 which unfolded during a seven day period in mid-July
 concerns the failure of a high-level mission, headed by
 Hsieh Fu-chih and Wang Li, to persuade the two factions
 in this large central China city to stop fighting and ac-
 cept the six-point formula for achieving unity recently
 issued by the Central Committee.  As applied in Wuhan,
 however, this formula called for the preferment of one
 faction (designated an authentic "revolutionary rebel"
 organization) over the other (labeled a "conservative"
 organization) and, in so doing, reversed an earlier deci-
 sion made by the local military.                     What is more, the lead-
 ers of the Wuhan Military Region Command were then ordered
 to make a public confession of error and conduct "self-
 criticism" before the revolutionary masses.

 As noted above, extremist elements in the Cultural
 Revolution Group of the Central Committee appeared deter-
 mined to exploit this incident to further their own goals.
 Addressing representatives of contending factions from
 Honan in Peking on 21 July, Kang Sheng attacked the Wuhan
 Military Region for having committed a "mutinous act" and
 warned of the possibility of "another Wuhan" occurring
 in Honan Province in the near future.   In an even more
 inflammatory speech on the same occasion, Madame Mao
 exhorted her audience of "young revolutionary fighters"
 not "to be naive", as their comrades in Wuhan had been,
 but rather "to take up arms to defend yourselves" when
 attacked by the "handful" using "pistols, rifles, spears
 or swords."  On 25 July, Hsieh Fu-chih and Wang Li re-
 ceived a frenzied heroes' welcome at a million-strong
 mass rally in Peking, and throughout the following week
 Mao's propagandists mounted a series of editorial attacks
 on "capitalist roaders" in the People's Liberation Army,
 culminating in the shrill call in the 31 July Red Flag
 editorial to "bring down" and "sweep the handfUrof party
 and military persons in authority taking the capitalist
 road completely and totally into the junkyard."
 Reflecting this tough line toward dissident or
 potentially dissident military commanders in the provinces,
 Lin Piao delivered a major policy speech on 9 August to
 a gathering of top political and military leaders (both
 central and regional) in Peking.   As he had on earlier
 occasions, Lin defended chaos or "upheaval" as essential
 to achieve the objectives of the "cultural revolution"
 (to "expose" reactionary things and reactionary persons)
 and counseled those present, even when unjustly attacked,
 "to stand up to it and restrain
 your anger."  Lin's speech
 was directed primarily, however, at those "comrades" who,
 through lack of understanding of the "cultural revolution,"
 had made "mistakes" in various military regions, reacting
 to attacks on their "Military District Commands" by "sup-
 pressing the masses."  The remedy, as Lin reiterated for
 emphasis, was for these local military leaders to quickly
 admit their "mistakes" by carryi:g out public "self-
 criticism" (as the Wuhan Military Region Commander Chen
 Tsai-tao had refused to do), "so that the revolutionary
 rebels may be their teachers and their own mistakes their

 own teaching materials."   If not, the fate of these mili-
 tary leaders would be the same as that of Chen Tsai-tao
 --"to have their pigtails grabbed."
 Additional evidence of what might be called the
 over-reaction of the central leadership to the Wuhan
 Incident was the decision in early August to arm selected
 Red Guard and "revolutionary rebel" units, both in Peking
 and the provinces, to assist in safeguarding property,
 maintaini!.ng order and "assuring the smooth development
 of the cultural revolution."  Authorization for this
 potentially explosive move was attributed to Mao Tse-tung
 himself, quoted in a wall poster at this time to the
 effect that "everyone should be prepared to take up
 bayonets."  When combined with Madame Mao's earlier call
 of 22 July to Red Guards "to take up arms" under the
 slogan "attack by reason, defend by force," the stage
 was set for a new form of "revolutionary rebellion" direct-
 ed toward a second "seizure of power," this time from
 the military commanders and newly established "revolution-
 ary committees" in several provinces.   Mao's "cultural
 revolution" was about to enter an "ultra-Leftist" phase,
 as it would be called when the violence and anarchy it
 unleashed would necessitate a hasty retreat.
 The rationale for this attempt to seize military
 power was, given the premises of the "cultural revolu-
 tion," quite logical.  As revealed in Red Guard publica-
 tions of the time, the reason why "revolutionary rebels"
 had been "suppressed" in various areas was that "mili-
 tary power" in these areas had been "usurped" by "persons
 of the Liu Shao-chi-Teng Hsiao-ping headquarters."   In
 terms of the dialectics of the "cultural revolution,"
 the "main contradiction" was no longer one with "the
 handful in the Party" (who had been "dragged out" in the
 preceding year) but with "the handful in the Army."
 Aided by Red Guards sent out from Peking, local "revolu-
 tionary rebels" were, according to one plan,  "to unite
 with the broad masses of People's Liberation Army cadres
 and fighters, drag out these executioners and reca ture
 the military power usurped by them."

 Paralleling this drive in the provinces, "revolu-
 tionary rebels" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were
 also incited by extremist members of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion Group to seize a greater share of power over the
 conduct of China's foreign relations.   In part a function
 of the continuing attack against Foreign Minister Chen
 I, this struggle within the Foreign Ministry also reflected
 pressures exerted by militants to inject a new "revolu-
 tionary" content into China's diplomatic relations, to
 convert foreign ministry and foreign service officials
 into "red diplomatic fighters."  Exemplifying this new
 type of revolutionary diplomat was Yao Teng-shan  who
 had returned in glory after being expelled from Djakarta
 it April and who, it was subsequently charged, headed the
 drive to "seize power" in the Foreign Ministry in August.
 The results of this sharp turn to the left were
 nearly catastrophic.   In foreign policy, a reign of ter-
 ror directed at foreign diplomats was instituted in Pek-
 ing, culminating in the ransacking and burning of the
 British Chancery and the manhandling of the British Charge
 on 22 August.   In domestic policy, although no single
 incident served to dramatize the damaging effects of the
 new militance of the "revolutionary Left," the consequ-
 ences were more serious, threatening the unity and
 stability of Mao's "proletarian headquarters," of the
 newly established "revolutionary committees" in the
 provinces, and also of the People's Liberation Army it-
 self.                     The discovery that, at a time of mounting violence
 and economic disorder, "factionalism" had spread from the
 Red Guards and "revolutionary rebels" into the Army was
 most alarming of all.  There was no choice in late August
 but to apply the brakes, pull back, assess the damage,
 and initiate a trend toward moderation in the "cultural
 revolution" which would last throughout the remainder of

 Moderation Again (September-December 1967)
 "This nation-wide disturbance is the
 last of its kind.  The Army is also dis-
 turbed this time.                                After this disturbance,
 the whole country will be in peace and be-
 come the regime of the revolutionary rebels.
 It is the Party Central Committee that allows
 this nation-wide disturbance." --Mao Tse-tung,
 Quoted in Canton Hung Wei-ping (Red Guards),
 23 October 1967
 The unfolding of Mao's "cultural revolution" had
 brought China by the end of August to the brink of anarchy,
 featuring pitched battles by heavily armed factions in
 nearly all of China's provinces.  Recognizing the gravity
 of the situation, Mao's new leadership team in Peking
 would seek to achieve two separate but related objectives
 in the remaining months of 1967:  (1) to carry out a
 series of measures designed to restore minimum levels
 of public order and production; and (2) to dissociate
 Mao and his "cultural revolution" from responsibility
 for the violence and lawlessness endemic in China by
 finding new scapegoats.   The gravity of the crisis was
 such that for the first time it was necessary to sacrifice
 a number of prominent members of the Cultural Revolution
 Group, holding them, rather than the policies they were
 administering, responsible for the "nation-wide  disturb-
 ance" in China.
 The vehicle for announcing the sharp reversal in
 policy was a 5 September speech by Madame Mao in Peking
 which was subsequently disseminated for "study" to all
 "revolutionary committees, military control committees,
 and revolutionary mass organizations" throughout the coun-
 try.  As a confirmed extremist and a confidante of Mao,
 Chiang Ching was no doubt selected as a spokesman whose
 pronouncements would be accepted as authoritative by the
 "revolutionary Left," the more so since most of the policies
 she now criticized in this speech were ones with which
 she was formerly associated.  The central theme of her

 speech was a vigorous defense of the central leadership,
 the newly formed provincial "revolutionary committees,"
 and the People's Liberation Army against the recent at-
 tack ("a gust of foul wind") launched by "wicked people...
 appearing either as 'ultra-Leftist' or Rightist"' who
 were attempting to undermine the "cultural revolution."
 Exemplifying this new threat by "ultra-Leftists" was the
 "May 16 Corps", a "counter-revolutionary organization"
 which sought "to undermine the Party Central Committee
 headed by Chairman Mao" by "centering its opposition on
 Premier Chou En-lai."  Another objective of these "bad
 people" was "to dissolve all the revolutionary committees"
 which hid been set up in the provinces "with the approval
 of the Central Committee," thus depriving the revolution
 of its vital "leadership organs."
 The bulk of Madame Mao's speech, however, was de-
 voted to repudiating the "armed struggle" by Red Guards
 and "revolutionary rebels" ?ncited by the slogans "seize
 a small handful in the Army" (which had appeared in the
 31 July Red Fla  editorial) and "attack by words, defend
 by force~w is    she herself had advanced in a speech of
 22 July.)  The wide-ranging assault of the PLA which had
 taken place in response to these exhortations was revealed
 in her statement:  "Everywhere we seized their guns, beat
 them up and scolded them.  But they did not strike back
 or argue." Although praising the forebearance of the
 military under this attack, Madame Mao made clear that
 there were limits to this forebearance, warning repeat-
 edly of the d
 "
 anger of
 creating chaos" in "our field
 armies."  And to ensure that these attacks would cease,
 she stressed that it was no longer permitted for Red
 Guards to travel about the country "kindling the fire
 of revolution and exchanging revolutionary experience"
 as they had done a year earlier.

 Other measures indicating a firm resolve td put
 an end to "armed struggle" appeared in a 1 September reso-
 lution passed by the Peking Municipal Revolutionary Com-
 mittee.                The first of these forbade payment of wages to
 workers who had left their production posts to engage in
 "armed struggle."  The resolution  also demanded that
 Red Guards who had gone out to the provinces to take part
 in these struggles "must return to their original units
 immediately and unconditionally."  As stressed in a Libera-
 tion Army Daily editorial of 7 September, these steps
 were necessary in order to carry out "Chairman Mao's great
 strategic plan."
 This plan was expounded in a series of "supreme
 instructions" issued by Mao Tse-tung during the course
 of an extended tour in September through north. central-
 south and east China, the tour itself an indication of
 the gravity with which Peking viewed this crisis in the
 "cultural revolution."  Although somewhat vague and
 oracular in tone, these instructions showed that Mao not
 only approved the series of measures under way to restore
 order but viewed them as necessary to make further progress
 toward the goals of his "cultural revolution."
 Most of the principles outlined in these instruc-
 tions were not new, having been enunciated in earlier
 stages of the revolution.  What had produced the recent
 "nationwide disturbance" was not the principles them-
 selves, but rather, as Mao took great pains to demonstrate,
 that these principles had been misunderstood and mistak?
 enly applied.   In fact, the principal lesson which Mao
 appeared to derive from his September review of develop-
 ments in the "cultural revolution" was that all three
 components of the new revolutionary organs of power--the
 PLA, the revolutionary cadres, and the "revolutionary
 rebels"--had made "mistakes" and would therefore (as
 pointed out by Lin Piao in a 1 October National Day
 speech) once again have to undergo "rectification" and
 "ideological education."

 The most pressing problem was "educating" the Red
 Guards and "revolutionary rebels" in order to prevent,
 as Mao put it, their "turning to the extreme Left."  This,
 of course, had already occurred, creating; what Mao refer-
 red to elsewhere as "the chief danger at the moment"--" that
 some people want to beat down the PLA," to "incite the
 soldiers to oppose their officers" and t+' create "chaos
 in the Army."  Another manifestation of this phenomenon
 of "ultra-Leftism" was "factionalism," a problem which
 had bedeviled the "cultural revolution" from the outset
 and to which Mao now turned his attention.
 First were the Olympian pronouncements, widely pub-
 licized, to the effect that "there is no reason whatso-
 ever for the working class to split into two great ir-
 reconcilable organizations" and "there is no conflict
 of fundamental interests in the ranks of the Red Guards
 and revolutionaries."  Next was the admission, made more
 explicit in speeches by other top leaders at this time,
 that radical Red Guard organizations in Peking had been
 responsible for spreading "factionalism" into the ranks
 of the workers in July and August.   As stated by Kang
 Sheng on 20 September, the "two great factions struggling
 in factories have been influenced by the two factions
 struggling in colleges and universities."
 The solution to this problem appeared in another
 "instruction" by Chairman Mao given wide publicity in mid-
 October--"to build revolutionary great alliances on the
 basis of trade, profession, department or class in school."
 It was necessary to break up the mass "proletarian revolu-
 tionary organizations" (consisting of students, workers,
 peasants and cadres) which had become unmanageable, dis-
 solving these organizations into their separate components
 which then would become easier to control.  A prime ob-
 jective of this reorganization was to get student Red
 Guards, carriers of the virus of "factionalism," out of
 the factories and the countryside and return them to the
 class room where they would once again (as had happened
 in February and March) undergo "rectification," a course
 of "military-political training" conducted by the PLA.

 How to promote "great unity" and establish "great
 revolutionary alliances" between formerly feuding "factions"
 was the theme dominating discussion of the "cultural revo-
 lution" in September and October.   As explained by Chair-
 man Mao, there were "two prerequisites for a great alli-
 ance," prerequisites embodied in his call addressed to
 the "revolutionary Left" at this time "to combat selfish-
 ness and criticize and repudiate revisionism."  Exemplify-
 ing the first, three prominent leaders of contending Red
 Guard organizations in Peking engaged in "self-criticism"
 at a 20 September meeting of the Peking Red Guard Congress
 of Colleges and Universities and pledged to form a "great
 alliance" in advance of National Day.
 The second prerequisite referred to the launching
 of still another "campaign of mass criticism and repudia-
 tion directed at China's Khrushchev," redirecting "the
 spearhead of struggle" away from internecine strife toward
 "the handful of top party persons in authority following
 the capitalist road."  As spelled out in a 17 September
 Liberation Army Daily editorial,  the intent was to "guide
 the revolutionary masses to look forward instead of back-
 ward," to dissuade them from demanding a settling of "old
 accounts."  As this editorial also made clear, the PLA
 was assigned the main responsibility for promoting "revo-
 lutionary great alliances" in both schools and factories.
 Although assigned the responsibility for restor-
 ing order in the ranks of the "revolutionary Left," the
 PLA was still denied the authority necessary to carry out
 this assignment.   In addition to the general prohibition
 against use of force in dealing with the "revolutionary
 masses," the PLA received specific instructions at this
 time not to suppress "revolutionary mass organizations."
 Limited to the instrumentality of ideological and poli-
 tical training, the PLA's authority was further restricted
 by the requirements that only "a handful of bad persons"
 in these organizations were to be held responsible for
 "factionalism", and that it was necessary (as pointed out
 by Chou En-lai in a 9 October speech) "to rely on the
 revolutionary masses in these organizations to expose
 and deal with them."  Compounding the difficulty was the
 admission (in an article discussing the problem of the

 "ultra-Left" in Hunan at this time) that "the broad revo-
 lutionary masses...find it more difficult to distinguish
 clearly the class enemy coming from the Left."  Forbidden
 to use force and unable to secure voluntary compliance,
 the PLA was powerless to carry out its assigned mission.
 After a temporary lull in September and October, the
 problem of "factionalism" would once more become acute,
 threatening by the end of the year to engulf China once
 again in anarchy.
 Further complicating their task, PLA cadres were
 informed at this time that they too would have to under-
 go "training and education" to atone for and prevent the
 repetition of "mistakes" they had committed in "support-
 ing the Left" in the previous stage of the "cultural
 revolution                                                       25X1
 Mao during his September tour of the pro-
 vinces,    he Chairman was very concerned over this ques-
 tion and repeatedly asked the comrades of various units
 how and why they made mistakes."  The most important
 reason, according to Mao, was that "Army cadres have not
 been educated over a long time and have no experience in
 this connection."  To help correct this deficiency, "train-
 ing classes" for senior military cadres from the provinces
 were held in Peking beginning in September and extending
 through the remainder of the year.
 A quicker, more effective remedy for these "mis-
 takes" committed by the PLA in "supporting the Left" (i.e.,
 supporting "conservative" rather than "revolutionary"
 mass organizations) was to order the Army to disengage
 from factional struggles altogether.   This order appeared
 in a 17 September Liberation Army Dail  editorial in the
 injunction to Army troops "not to involve themselves in
 struggles among groups" and, more succinctly, in the slogan
 enunciated in speeches the same day by Chou En-lai and
 Madame Mao:  "support the Left and not just factions."
 An important ancillary purpose of this directive, of
 course, was to prevent the virus of "factionalism" from
 spreading further into the Army.
 Civilian party and government cadres--tike third
 component of the "three-way alliance"--were to be given

 still another chance "to correct their mistakes" by taking
 part in this "training" program in the fall of 1967.  As
 suggested by another Maoist instruction ("it is necessary
 to expand the area of education and diminish the area
 under attack"), however, the principal concern of the
 "training" program this time was to protect these cadres
 from the punitive, wholesale attacks to which they had
 been subjected by "revolutionary rebels."  The time had
 come to reassert Mao's "mild cadre policy," as exemplified
 in his admonition that "it is not good to beat the cadres,
 punish them by making them kneel on the ground, hang
 sign boards on their necks and put dunce caps on them."
 As discussed in an authoritative People's Daily
 editorial of 21 October, this new policy was  asea on the
 recognition that "correct treatment of cadres" was "the
 key to realizing the revolutionary three-way alliance,
 consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and making
 a success of the struggle-criticism-trans'formation move-
 ment in each unit."  There was an urgent need to recruit
 "revolutionary cadres" who, because of their "richer
 experience...better organizing and working ability and
 higher understanding of policy," would "serve as the core
 and backbone in the revolutionary provisional organs of
 power"--the "revolutionary committees."  And since, the
 editorial asserted, "the ranks of our cadres have become
 purer, stronger and more vigorous," it would be possible
 "to let large groups of revolutionary cadres ...join the
 provisional power organs for a three-way alliance on all
 levels."
 The final and perhaps most important "instruction"
 conveyed by Chairman Mao during his September tour was
 that the process of setting up a new governmental structure
 (the "revolutionary committees") in all the 29 provinces
 ani major cities of Chin; be speeded up and completed by
 the end of January 1968.  Whereas only seven of these had
 been formed in the first nine months of 1967, it was now
 intended to create 22 in the ensuing four-month period
 in order (in Mao." s words) that "problems of the whole
 country could be solved basically and the whole situation
 put into the normal track before the Spring Festival."
 To meet this deadline, it was no longer possible to rely

 on the long, drawn-out, cumbrous and generally unsuccess-
 ful method of "seizure of power" from below.   Instead,
 it was necessary to impose solutions from above,  hammer-
 ing out agreements in Peking on the basis of Mao's direc-
 tive "to solve the problems of various provinces one by
 one."  As reported by Chou En-lai on 26 September, dele-
 gations from 12 provinces had come to Peking for just
 this purpose, a development which Chairman Mao had hailed
 as "good", because ''they have all come to look to the
 Central Committee to solve their problems."
 Chou's prediction in this speech that "it is not
 possible to solve very quickly the problems of the 12
 provinces" was an accurate one.   Emphasizing that "we
 must seriously discuss these problems in a responsible
 manner" with the representatives of the army, revolution-
 ary leading cadres and representatives of revolutionary
 mass organizations assembled in Peking, the Premier in-
 dicated a major stumbling block which would prevent rapid
 establishment of these "revolutionary committees"--that
 the composition and membership of these committees could
 not be arbitrarily decreed from above but would have to
 be approved by all three groups comprising these revolu-
 tionary organs of power.  This meant that top leaders of
 the Party Center (notably Chou himself) would be forced
 to spend night after night in protracted and exhausting
 negotiating sessions lasting a month or more, during
 which the two "factions" from the province concerned
 wrangled over the degree of representation and share of
 power to be allotted each.   As a result of the delay
 imposed by this time-consuming and laborious process,
 only seven additional provinces and major cities had suc-
 ceeded in proclaiming "revolutionary committees" by or
 near the time of the Spring Festival.
 Although the trend toward moderation initiated in
 late August continued, two major components of the effort
 to restore order had run into difficulty by the end of
 the year.   First, the attempt to restore order from below
 by "establishing revolutionary great alliances on the
 basis of trade, profession, department or class in school"
 was foundering because of the refusal of "revolutionary
 mass organizations" in many areas to comply voluntarily

 with this  irective. Forbidden by Mao to use force and
 "to suppress revolutionary mass organizations," the PLA
 was powerless to cope with the fresh outbreak of "faction-
 alism" in November and December which threatened once
 again to plunge large areas of China into "armed strug-
 gle" and anarchy.
 The undertaking to restore order from above by
 speeding up establishment of a new government structure
 had also fallen far short of the original goal.   Here
 again the principal reason this program had not progressed
 faster was Mao's insistence that the representatives of
 "revolutionary mass organizations" be heard in the
 negotiating process and receive genuine representation
 in the new organs of revolutionary power.  Despite the
 reverses encountered in 1967, Mao Tse-tung appeared
 determined at the close of the year on carrying his
 "cultural revolution" through to the end.

 people in motion the first year, winning vic-
 tory in the second year and finishing the

 Speech on "Fight Self, Repudiate Revisionism,"
 5 October 1967
 The announcement in the fall of 1967 that the time-
 table for completing the "cultural revolution" had been
 extended to mid-1969 reflected a new appreciation of the
 difficulties involved in carrying the revolution through
 to the end.  Central to this new appreciation was the
 realization that the struggle to "seize power" in 1967,
 which had started so exuberantly in the "January Revolu-
 tion," had been a failure.
 The admission of failure in the "seize power" move-
 sent appeared in a remarkably candid speech by Chou En-
 lai delivered in Peking on 8 November to representatives

 of rival worker and Red Guard groups from Canton.   With
 the exception of Shanghai, Chou explained, the "rebels"
 had not been able "to seize power in a proper way" be-
 cause of their inability to form "great alliances," a
 result in turn of their inability to understand and act
 upon "Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."  What had hap-
 pened in most cases was that "power was seized by only
 one faction," which'invited counter-seizure by another
 facti',,.., so that "seizure of power became surrender of
 power and power could not be retained."
 After the Army had been called in to exercise
 this power temporarily, a second attempt (beginning in
 April) had been made to unite the revolutionary masses
 into "great alliances" under the slogan "take the Left as
 the core."  But this attempt also had failed--"no matter
 which group you took as the core, things did not work
 out"--because it too had promoted "factionalism," leading
 to the indiscriminate labeling of "mass organizations"
 as "Rightist," "conservative" or "royalists with guns."
 The way to overcome this "factionalism" in the new stage
 of the revolution, Chou emphasized, was to recognize that
 all "mass organizations" were "revolutionary," that "all
 the masses are determined to make revolution."  As was
 to be expected, the Premier spent little time explaining
 why the "seize power" movement had failed, merely point-
 ing out that the "question of power seizure" was a new
 one (Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin had never discussed
 it) which "Chairman Mao" had brought up and therefore
 required "study in the course of practice."
 The failure of Mao's grand design to mobilize the
 forces of the "revolutionary Left" to "seize power" from
 below necessitated a fundamental change in strategy in
 the fall of 1967 to one emphasizing control from above.
 An important part of this effort to re-establish centralized
 control over the political and economic life of the coun-
 try was the decision at this time to convene the long de-
 layed "Ninth Party Congress" in 1968.   As revealed by
 Hsieh Fu-chih in a 26 October speech and in surrounding
 commentary, this decision reflected an intention to bring
 to an end the chaos which the practice of "extensive
 democracy" had produced in the preceding year, a situation

 in which party leadership had consisted largely of bring-
 ing "Mao Tse-tung's thought into direct contact with the
 masses."   It also reflected disenchantment with the per-
 formance of the People's Liberation Army in 1967, speci-
 fically its failure to recognize and provide adequate
 support to the "revolutionary Left."
 Hsieh's speech suggested that another important
 reason for resurrecting the Party was the need to recruit
 experienced cadres quickly in order to restore orderly
 processes in the government and economy of China.  This
 goal was to be achieved by organizing the party congress
 "from the top downward," by having the Central Committee
 select those who would attend.  With the inducement of
 a chance to resume positions of authority within the party,
 government and economic apparatus, it could be expected
 that a large number of veteran party cadres would step
 forward to denounce Liu Shao-chi and join the ranks of
 the Maoists.   Although there was some uncertainty as to
 the timing (Hsieh mentioned both May and September as
 possible dates), convening of the Ninth Party Congress
 in 1968 attended by carefully selected delegates would
 permit the voting out of office of the "handful" of Mao's
 opponents within the Party,* the formal investiture of
 Mao's new leadership team, and the proclamation of another
 great victory achieved in the "great proletarian cultural
 revolution."  The creation of a revitalized Chinese Com-
 munist Party'staffed by trustworthy "revolutionary suc-
 cessors" has, of course, been a primary objective of Mao's
 "cultural revolution" from the outset.
 *Although only a rough estimate, the "handful" (the
 term employed in the original 8 August 1966 Central Com-
 mittee decision on the "cultural revolution") had probably
 grown by the end of 1967 to encompass several thousand
 leadership cadres at the central, regional and provincial
 levels of the Party, including nearly two-thirds of the
 Politburo, half of the full members of the Central Com-
 mittee, and three-fourths of the provincial party first
 secretaries.

 Progress toward the original goals of the "cultural
 revolution" in 1967 was minimal and achieved only at great
 coat.    The first goal--that of discrediting and overthrow-
 ing Mao's major opponents within the Party--was achieved
 readily enough, but in most cases the power "seized" from
 these opponents had then to be relinquished to the Army.
 Another important result of Mao's call to "seize power"
 from below had been to inculcate widespread contempt
 among Red Guards and "revolutionary rebels" for authority
 of any kind, including the authority of new "revolution-
 ary" institutions and even that of the Party Center.  For
 these reasons,Mao's power to control developments in China
 --like that of other leaders--probably declined in 1967.
 Progress toward the second goal--that of identify-
 ing and training trustworthy "revolutionary successors"--
 was limited and uneven.   At the outset, many youthful
 Red Guards and "revolutionary rebels" appeared to be
 enthusiastic in their support of the revolution.   After
 more than a year of violence and bloodshed and especially
 after their recent demotion to a position of secondary
 importance, it is likely that many among the younger
 generation in China have grown cynical and would welcome
 the opportunity to resume their studies in a quieter and
 better ordered society.
 Failure to make progress toward the third and
 final goal--that of achieving an ideological revolution--
 was most noticeable of all.   Instead of smashing the
 "four olds" (old ideas, culture,'customs and habits) and
 creating a new Chinese man devoted to Mao's conception
 of the good society (featuring class struggle, heroic
 poverty and collective enthusiasm), the end result of the
 "cultural revolution" in 1967 was to make the "four olds"
 more prevalent than ever, to revive traditional relation-
 ships and intensify the pursuit of narrow, selfish inter-
 ests (the most basic, of course, being personal survival)
 by both legal and illegal means.
 Given these setbacks and failures, it was a fair
 question to ask at the close of 1967 whether the "cultural
 revolution" was coming to an end.   The answer to this
 question, however, depends upon the answer to another,

 more basic question:  whether Mao Tse-tung still dominates
 the central party, government and military leadership in
 Peking.  The record of developments in the "cultural
 revolution" in 1967 demonstrates, it is believed, that
 Mao remained in charge throughout, initiating or at
 least approving all changes in policy, including the sud-
 den retreat toward moderation in late August forced by
 objective circumstances.  These circumstances--princip-
 ally a damaged economy, a disturbed Army, a fragmented
 "revolutionary Left," a breakdown of Party and government
 machinery, and the consequent threat of anarchy--have
 forced Mao to call a halt to the destructive, mass phase
 of his "cultural revolution" and press ahead with the
 construction of a new "revolutionary" government and Party
 apparatus.
 This shift in strategy should not be construed,
 however, as a change in basic goals.   In the eyes of Mao,
 the "cultural revolution"--as the ultimate expression of
 his views on the nature of man and society--can never end.
 As long as Mao Tse-tung continues to dominate the leader-
 ship in Peking, the "great proletarian cultural revolu-
 tion" will continue in Communist China.
