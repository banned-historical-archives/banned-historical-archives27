 Vietnam Situation
 The overall political picture in South Vietnam today is
 generally brighter than it was a month or so ago when the
 Ky government was fighting for its life with the Buddhist
 but trouble spots have not entirely vanished.
 Premier Ky has reasserted government authority over, the
 rebellious northern provinces of I Corps,  although there
 are still occasional murmurs of defiance.  A few leaders
 of the "struggle" movement are still at large.
 By alternating tactics of toughness toward Buddhist ex-
 tremists,  and conciliation toward the moderates,  the gov-
 ernment has for the present isolated Tri Quang from his
 sources of potential power, and brought about at least
 a temporary suspension of Buddhist opposition through
 the authority of Thich Tam Chau,  the more moderate chair-
 man of the Buddhist Institute.
 Ky's concessions to Chau do not seriously impair his gov-
 ernment's freedom of action, but are designed rather to
 enhance Chau's stature among Buddhist diehards.   One
 concession was the release of low-level prisoners taken
 by the government during the course of the recent struggle
 movement.

 Approved ForlRelease 2004/08/31 : CIA-RDPr9yi0827A000300120002-0
 More important "struggle" movement leaders,  such as the
 former mayor of Da Nang, Dr. Nguyen Van Man,  and those
 with suspected Viet Cong ties, remain in custody, and
 will probably stand trial.
 Disunity is still prevalent at the Institute, however.
 On July 13, Tam Chau announced he would not be active
 in Institute affairs for several months.
 The Ky government has also taken a number of steps de-
 signed to broaden its representative base and to launch
 the country toward a semblance of representative govern-
 ment.
 In addition to adding 10 civilians to the ruling mili-
 tary Directorate, the government has established a 79-man
 Civilian and Military Advisory Council to make recom-
 mendations on non-military questions.
 The government is now pretty solidly committed to an
 eventual representative government chosen by popular
 election.   An election law to govern the selection of
 a national constitutional assembly on September 11 has
 been promulgated, and individuals and some groups are
 now busily filing nominees in order to meet the July 11
 deadline for:applications.   So far, however,  the Buddhists
 have not withdrawn a decision to boycott the election.

 The assembly,  to consist of 108 elected delegates and
 nine others chosen as representatives of the minority
 tribes,  is charged solely with drafting a constitution.
 A new government may not emerge before mid-1967.
 Despite its stronger position,  the Ky government still
 faces serious hurdles.
 One problem is the bickering and rivalries that still
 persist among the principal leaders themselves.
 A cabinet reshuffle, frequently delayed because of objec-
 tions raised by certain Directorate generals, was an-
 nounced on July 13.  A second deputy premiership for cul-
 tural and social matters was formed under Nguyen Luu
 Vien, a southern Buddhist,  not associated with the Bud-
 dhist Institute.   General Nguyen Bao Tri was named Min-
 ister of Information and Chiev. Hoi, reportedly to give
 Ky and Chief of State Thieu some control over the forth-
 coming election process.

 The Military Situation in South Vietnam
 Intensified and sustained allied spoiling operations
 along the South Vietnam/Cambodia border have thus far
 delayed or disrupted an anticipated Communist summer
 monsoon offensive in the central. highlands and north of
 Saigon.
 Border surveillance operations in Pleiku and Kontum Prov-
 inces are particularly indicative of the effectiveness
 of the US/Vietnamese "preventive action" campaign.   Since
 mid-May,  these long-term ground sweeps have resulted in
 more than 1,100 Communist troops killed and have dis-
 rupted the north-eastward movement of a North Vietna-
 mese division into South Vietnam's high plateau region,
 Similarly, aggressive allied operations against major
 Communist buildups in the central coastal plain and in
 the provinces due north of Saigon have denied Viet Cong
 forces access to sorely-needed rice supplies in Phu Yen
 Province,  and evidently thwarted a planned enemy offen-
 sive in the Binh Long province area.
 These and other recent allied successes have forced the
 Communists to adopt a hit-and-run attack posture, empha-
 sizing actions against isolated, lightly defended Vietna-
 mese outposts.

 NORTH VIETNAM POL FACILITIES BOMBED
 Attacks on. North Vietnamese petroleum storage facilities
 have made continued operation of the economy and prosecu-
 tion of the war in. the south more difficult and costly.
 Bombing of these facilities has denied North Vietnam:
 (1)   nearly 50 percent of the pre-raid capacity in, princi-
 pal bulk petroleum storage facilities;  (2) the use of cer-
 tain of the facilities at Haiphong,  the only important
 terminal for receiving oceangoing tankers;  (3) the use of
 the entire Hanoi facility,  the country's second-largest
 petroleum storage center and most important hub for in-
 ternal distribution;  and  (4) some 50-60,000 tons of
 petroleum products.
 The enemy has sufficient petroleum storage capacity and
 stocks to permit continuation of both civil and military
 operations--including infiltration--for more than five
 months.   Additional imports and the reduced use by non-
 essential consumers could extend this period.
 The six petroleum storage installations hit on 29 and 30
 June had a total capacity of 1.33,000 metric tons of pe-
 troleum--approximately 80 percent of the estimated national
 principal bulk storage capacity of 165,000 metric tons.

 Hanoi's propaganda reaction to the POL strikes has been to
 reaffirm its determination. to continue the fight and,  in
 addition., an. ominous  new note has been. added--the threat
 of trial and death sentences for captured US airmen..
 The latest word from Hanoi, carried by the official Czech
 news agency,  is that trials may be held on either 20 July--
 the anniversary of the 1954 Gen.eva Agreements--or on 4
 August--the second anniversary of the Tonkin Gulf in.cident.
 According to US estimates,  at least thirty-five US air-

 160 pilots are missing and many of these may have been.

 The Chinese Communist Leadership
 We believe that China has entered a transition period
 (Mow Tsuh-dung)
 even before Mao Tse-tung's final departure.   Mao's ab-
 sences from the public scene are growing longer and longer,
 sug,   ':j_ng recurring illnesses.   He has appeared only
 twice since November.
 (Mow Tsuh-dung)
 Mao Tse-tung probably remains the dominant leader, and
 can probably impose his will, but at least since Novem-
 ber he has not had the sure sustained control he wants.
 It is possible, moreover, that ambitious colleagues are
 pushing Mao to turn over more and more of the party ma-
 chinery and the authority to make domestic and foreign
 policy decisions.
 The relative standing of Mao's immediate lieutenants is
 far from clear.   Disclosures already made point to a
 (Dung Shyow-Ping)
 power play by Teng Hsiao-ping, the powerful general se-
 cretary of the party.   Teng has been working with or using
 (Pyow)
 Lin Piao, whose place in the army would make him a use-
 ful ally.   Teng probably built the case that led to the
 recent ouster of Peng Chen, a rival in Mao's inner circle
 of advisers.

 The situation is still fluid, but not as much as it
 was a month or two ago.   The Peking People?s Daily an-
 nounced on 1 July that the struggle was over.   The
 paper described recent events as an attempt by "counter-
 revolutionary" plotters to seize the leadership of the
 party, army, and the government.
 If stability has been restored,  it may well prove tran-
 sitory.   It is doubtful that the situation will fully
 stabilize until Mao finally departs and a successor
 consolidates his position.
 We do not expect to see abrupt shifts in domestic or
 foreign policy while the struggle goes on.   All the con-
 tenders for the leadership are hard-line Chinese Com-
 munists, and quick changes are unlikely.

 YUGOSLAVIA:   PARTY PROBLEMS
 President Tito has set in motion the most drastic shake-
 up of the Yugoslav regime since 19540with his 1 July
 ouster of his heir apparent party secretary Alexander
 Rankovic (Rank-o-vich).
 A broad reshuffling of government and party officials
 is probable as conservative elements who shared the
 outlook of Rankovic are ousted.
 Already Koca Popovic (Ko-cha Pop-o-vich)  has been elected
 by a special session of parliament to replace Rankovic
 as vice president of the republic.    Popovic has been
 serving as chairman of a party commission with foreign
 relations and prior to this appointment served as
 foreign minister for twelve years.
 Tito's action against his long-time colleague and old
 comrade,  apparently taken reluctantly, was most likely
 the first step in a wide-ranging purge of those who have
 opposed implementation of economic and social reforms;
 younger and generally more liberal party officials will
 probably be brought into authority,

 Approve_ dory Release 2004/08/31 : CIA-RDI179827A000300120002-0
 Rankovic's removal was based on charges that he had
 misused his influence over the secret police to hinder
 implementation of regime policies and to enhance his
 power.   Tito apparently had become alarmed at some of
 the activities and methods Rankovic was using.
 Rankovic seemed to be looking ahead to the day when
 he would legally replace the 74-year-old dictator and
 was attempting to ensure an unopposed succession.
 Any such wide-scale shake-up of the party is likely to
 exacerbate existing nationality rivalries, particularly
 between the Serbs and Croats.   Rankovic's essentially
 conservative outlook had backing from his fellow Ser-
 bian Communists who resented the regime's economic pol-
 icies that benefited the more developed republics of
 Croatia and Slovenia.
 The entire question. of Tito's successor has been  thrown
 into doubt:   neither of the two remaining party secre-
 taries,  Kardelj  (Kar-Dell) nor Vlahovic  (Vla-Ho-vich),
 ha s  a strong power base; other possible successors
 include Crvenkovski  (Sir-ven-Kov-ski), who chaired the
 party commission that investigated Rankovic,  and To-
 dorovic  (To-Dor-o-vich), who has been elevated to re-
 place Rankovic.

 No new ground seems to have been broken by the partici-
 pants in the Warsaw Pact meetings; probably none of the
 participants was entirely satisfied with the outcome.
 Moscow's main aims were  (1) to strengthen and re-
 organize the pact, and (2) to obtain joint statements
 on European security and Vietnam.
 The Rumanians,  in particular, and probably some of the
 other Eastern European countries regarded the Russian
 intentions concerning the pact as dangerous to their
 freedom of maneuver and independence in bloc affairs.
 The final communiqu4`1s brief, vague, and only reference
 to this issue suggests that it remains unresolved;  that
 at best,  the contending parties agreed to disagree.
 The impression is left that Rumanian opposition to Rus-
 sian demands may have been successful.
 Over-all,  the pact summit meeting, despite months of pre-
 paratory discussion and several prior intrabloc consul-
 tations, would appear to have brought forth a mouse.

 The USSR could, however, take satisfaction in obtaining
 the backing of its European allies for the USSR position
 on Vietnam.
 The pact's statement on European security largely reit-
 erated old bromides.

 De Gaulle's visit went as predicted in terms of practical
 accomplishments and non-accomplishments.
 From De Gaulle's point  of  view,  the trip sought to place
 France in the forefront of nations seeking a European
 settlement.
 He did acknowledge during the trip that US still has a
 role to play--in what he regards primarily a European
 matter.
 On. Vietnam, both sides called_again.for an. end to foreign
 intervention and a return to the 1954 Geneva accords as
 the basis for settlement.   There is n.o indication, how-
 ever, that agreement was made to launch a joint French-
 Soviet "initiative" on. Vietnam.
 Forms of future French-Soviet contact provided for in the
 joint declaration issued after the trip are:   (1) mutual
 consultations on bilateral and multilateral relations, no
 provision, yet for frequency and level;  (2) establishment
 of a Paris-Moscow "hot line";  and (3) creation. of a joint
 commission to oversee fulfillment of scientific and eco-
 nomic agreements signed during the visit.

 The scientific agreement provides for space cooperation
 in the following areas:   (1) space research which in-
 cludes Soviet launching of a French satellite  (with
 "technical" matters still to be negotiated);  (2) space
 meteorology including parallel launching of sounding
 rockets;  (3) space communications envisaging continua-
 tion of the Moln.iya satellite experiments and (4) visits
 of French scientists to Soviet Academy institutes.
 (Brezh-nyef)
 rez nev, who clearly "led" the Soviet delegation.,
 showed little flexibility on Germany.   He said the exist-
 ence of two German states must be accepted as the basis
 for any East-West discussions on Germany.
 The concept of a European Security Conference was raised
 but not pressed by Brezhnev.
 The chief gains for each side were:
 Soviet:   Acceptance as a "European. in good standing" and
 the prospect of some access to Western technology under
 the bilateral agreements signed.

 Communal tensions on the island have risen.   Presi-
 (Mah-Kah-Ree-os)
 dent Ma arios continues his efforts to:   demoralize
 the Turkish Cypriot community, and sabotage the Greek-
 Turkish bilateral talks under way in Vienna.
 As incidents have multiplied on both sides, Makarios
 twice has clamped restrictions on the movement of
 (Ni-Koh-Se-Uh)
 Turkish Cypriots in Nicosia.   Turkish Cypriot reaction
 to the first ban was a further withdrawal from inter-
 communal cooperation--a move toward the de facto parti-
 tion desired by the Turkish Cypriot leadership.
 Ankara's failure to back up its "ultimatum" on June 23
 following the second ban has (1) convinced the Greek
 Cypriots that Turkey will react militarily only if its
 basic rights on the island are jeopardized, and (2)
 possibly undermined the confidence of the Turkish Cypriot
 community that Ankara really intends to protect Turkish
 Cypriot rights.
 Month-long UN mediation efforts have failed to resolve
 a military confrontation over Greek Cypriot road con-

 Makarios reportedly will accept "demilitarizing" the
 area.   However, the Turkish Cypriots are holding out
 for a number of observation posts to assure that Greek
 Cypriots do not resume construction.
 Both Greece and Turkey seem hopeful of success in the
 current Cyprus talks, but neither has given any indica-
 tion that it is willing to make significant concessions,
 any attempt to impose a solution on Makarios will undoubt-
 edly result in continued frustration.

 INDONESIA
 (Su-hart-o)
 Army chief General Sumo?s power was significantly
 strengthened by action of the Indonesian. Congress which
 ended 6 July.   In contrast President Sukarno's position
 and prestige. suffered a further decline.
 The congress:   (1) reaffirmed Suharto's special execu-
 tive powers gran.ted by Sukarno last March,  (2) revoked
 Sukarno's life presidency,  (3) gave Suharto a mandate to
 form anew cabinet by mid-August,  (4) reaffirmed Suharto's
 earlier ban on Indonesian. Communist Party and proscription
 of "Marxism-Leninism",  and (5) decreed that elections be
 held  in  two years.
 Suharto has indicated, that he will head -a new cabinet w rich
 will include five density first ministers and 24 ministers.
 In this capacity he will be "first amens equals-'LLand.probably-
 will he named "deputy prime minister"            while
 Sukarno remains as the figurehead prime minister.
 (Mahl-lik)           (Jog-ja-karta)
 Malik and Sultan of Jogjakarta--Suharto's major colleagues
 in  present cabinet--will remain but specific capacity as
 yet undefined.

 Suharto has domestic job of controlling Indonesia's op-
 portunistic political factions.   Ultimately he may be
 forced to retain. some authoritarian. elements of Sukarno?s
 "guided democracy."
 Government's most urgent problem is getting bankrupt
 economy back on sound basis.   Bilateral talks with creditor
 nations are still under way to reschedule payments and get
 aid.   Indonesia is applying for readmission to International
 Monetary Fund and World Bank.
 Creditor nations agree that problem of Indonesia's inter
 national debt ($2.5 billion) should be approached multi-
 laterally.   Meeting may be held this fall,  but largest
 creditor--USSR--cannot be expected to attend.
 Suharto and his team have been trying to return. Indonesia
 to a "free an.d active" foreign policy.   They have resumed
 friendly relations with West, they hope to be back in. United
 Nations by September, and they have disengaged from Sukarno's
 pro-Peking policy.

 14 July Phfi$%tjon Staff,
 Britain and Rhodesia are still at loggerheads.
 The British seem willing to give Rhodesia legal inde-
 pendence under minority white rule provided:   (1) Rho-
 desians first return briefly to nominal British sover-
 eignty and (2) promise steady advances for Africans after,
 independence.
 Rhodesia refuses to end rebellion until Britain spells
 out clearly what kind of concessions are expected toward
 Rhodesian Africans.   Premier Smith and the Rhodesians ap-
 parently are prepared to make some minor concessions to
 Africans if the tempo of the advances of the Africans is
 under control of the Rhodesian whites.
 Britain thinks a few more months of economic sanctions
 will soften the Rhodesians' stand.   However, sanctions
 are unlikely to have marked economic effects within that
 short time.   Most of the Rhodesian whites seem ready to
 live at a lower economic level rather than surrender their
 power to the African majority in the foreseeable future.

 Africans will not accept any settlement unless it guaran-
 tees majority rule before independence.  However, neither
 the Rhodesian Africans nor the other African governments
 has the power to upset any agreement between Britain and
 the rebel regime.
 Other African governments would be extremely bitter toward
 the West if Britain "sold out" in Rhodesia.   Several would
 probably leave the Commonwealth.
