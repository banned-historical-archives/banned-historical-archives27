By 1970 the army was the dominant 
power throughout local and provincial poli-
tics, far more powerful than the sickly new 
party,. which, in most areas, was being pain-
fully s.rebuilt from the carcass of the old. 
Altogether it was perhaps unsurprisi4 that 
at the.9th party congress in 1969 the PLA 
should have been given 45 per cent of 
all Central Committee seats and 12 out of 
25 places on the Politburo. The PLA's 
manifesto, written by Mao and published 
in 1947, declares: 'We are the troops led 
by the great Communist Party of !China. 
Provided we constantly observe the direc-
tives of the party, we will win.' The proh-
Dictatorship by any class has to rule by 
violence... Marxists even praise, far from 
opposing, revolutionary violence, which 
- conforms to the trend of historical develop-
ment. - Red Flag, December. 
Whoever you are, however senior your 
official position, if You do not conform to 
Mao Tse-tung thought, if you do not fol-
low Mao Tse-tung's revolutionary line, we 
shall ? strongly resist and struggle against 
you vigorously. - Pco ple's Daily, .27 March. 
Chairman -Mao has many concerns: that 
tie revolutionary purity of the party, as 
es:emplified during its Yeria.n period and the 
snartan conditions of civil and anti-Japa-
n:se war he retained -- or restored; that an 
energetic and united Collective leadership 
should succeed him; that the results of the 
Cultural Revolution should be consolidated, 
nst squandered; that everything be done to 
avoid the Sovietisation of China, either, by 
ruilitary conquest or by the more subtle 
introduction of 'revisionism' into Chinese 
snciety. Summed up. his concerns are that 
China should remain Maoist. Whether or 
oat the Chairman now feels a greater sense 
of urgency than ever before, they are what 
this campaign to criticise Lin Piao and cri-
tisise Confucius is about. To say much more 
you have to be a .China-watcher. 
The present campaign can really be seen 
ooly in the context of the successes and 
failures of the Cultural Revolution. The 
c laos and bloodshed of 1966-68 succeeded 
by destroying the party, by forcing cadres 
in labour in the fields, by having manage-
ment work on the floor,, by sending high-
s :hoof graduates out into the borders rather 
than straight into university and into an elite 
class ofintellectuals, in ending much of the 
r gidity and class divisions in Chinese-soc-
iety. For all the claims of the present cam-
1--.aig,n, China today is far more fluid and 
fir less 'revisionist' or 'capitalist' (in terms 
s f the Soviet model) than it was in 1965. 
-.But the Cultural Revolution also ere-
:- ted problems which remained unsolved 
when the Lin Piao. Confucius campaign be-
an. Production suffered terribly during 
I:lose years and the country lost with it 
a lot of administrative talent which it could 
ill afford, as older cadres fell victim to 
denunciations, sometimes careerist and op-
portunistic, from those below them: 70 
per cent of the Central Committee were 
either purged or severely criticised and 
thereby rendered ineffective. One of the 
possible conflicts in the leadership today is 
over the attempt to restore to power some 
of those who were unfairly dismissed. Lin 
Piao is being attacked, remember, for 're-
storation of rites' and that can embrace 
anyone or anything not actually current. 
The second and larger problem was that 
posed by the one bureaucratic victor of the 
Cultural Revolution - the People's Libera-
tion Army. Already by 1967 the army was 
the only institution which had sin vived the 
chaos and which could still act as a co-
hesive force in society. Indeed, Mao had 
to call on its first officer, Lin Piao, to re-
store order - by force if force was required 
(it often was) - and to 'support industry, 
support hgrieutture, support the masses of 
the Left, establish military control and 
ideological training'. In the last resort it 
was only the army which enabled Mao 
eventually to control the waves on which 
he had blown. In August 1967, soon after 
Chou En-lai had barely persuaded the Red 
Guards not to seize him and the Central 
Government's files, it was Lin Piao who 
was. asked to start suppressing the Red 
Guard movement. 
. In 1970 Chou En-lai told Edgar Snow 
that the army had suffered 'hundreds of 
thousands' of casualties during the Cultural 
Revolution before it succeeded in ending 
the fighting and other factionalism. Al-
together 2 million 'Maoist activists' were 
drawn from the PLA for this purpose and 
to help set up the new.. 'revolutionary com-
mittees' which were to take over the ma-
nagements of every enterprise after the 
Cultural Revolution. These committees were 
and still ares selected according to the 
'three-in-one alliance' - one third of their 
members are supposed to be soldiers, one 
third cadres or officials, and one third 
lin_ pnl  
evitably reflected in the army too. The party 
leadership, as we know, has not always been 
united since the Cultural Revolution started. 
It was perhaps here then Lin Piao began 
to go wrong. But if the social power of 
the PLA and its chief representative. Lin 
Piao, had been enhanced by the Cultural 
Revolution, its military effectiveness had 
been impaired. (Production losses, after all, 
had hit military supplies as much as any-
thing else.) Nothing demonstrated the mar-
tial limits of the army more starkly than the 
border clashes with the. Soviet Union in 
1969. The Russians had apparently made 
a close study of US helicopter tactics in 
Vietnam: they literally flew circles around 
the bewildered Chinese. Their tanks and 
their artillery were far more accurate and 
effective than anything the PLA could put 
up; China just did not have the hardware 
essential to a response. The battles are 
generally thought to hal;e had a significant 
effeet on a leadership still unrecovercd 
from the uncertainties of the Cultural Re-
volution. 
But by 1969 the military threat from the' 
Soviets seemed so much greater than Ceii 
from the US had ever been that rito,,t 
the party's leaders, including Mao and 
Chou, decided they would have to take 
seriously Nixon's promise to end the Viet-
nam war and his first tentative overtures 
to Peking. D?nte with Washington would 
.provide not only strategic protection but 
also essential technological help. One we.s. 
tern ambassador in Peking explains that 
Chou, with Mao behind him. 'had the vision 
of the necessary transformation. Till the 
end of the Sixties China was isolated from 
the outside, 'kept going simply by moral 
exhortation. 'Chou was adopting the posi-
tion taken by the 191h-century reandarin 
Chang Chih-tung who said: "We must take 
Chinese teaching as the funshimental es-
sence and Western teaching for practical 
use." Not everyone agreed with hins.! 
The- chief dissenter was apparently lin 
Mao, the Minister of Defence and Mao's 
heir designate. It is nosy said that Lin was

s tough 'dine. with Moscow. One account 
I as it that he was induced to go along with 
tic Washington connection only if it 'seas 
aralleled by a secret detente with the 
Kremlin. 
Everyone in China today will tell you 
that on 19 October 1969 (the day before 
the Sino-Soviet border talks began in Pe-
king) Lin Piao wrote out, in hi S room, 
quotes from Confucius. Among them were 
' Zestrain yourself' arid 'Restoi e the Rites'. 
One of the posters in the Canton bicycle 
factory echoes the People's Daily when it 
declares that .Lin Piao's Confucius quotes 
'ssIcarly show his vicious ambition to sub-
est the dictatorship- of the proletariat and 
iestore capitalism'. Given Mao's opinion of 
Soviet society and his fear that a detente 
-vith Moscow would lead to the Sovietisa-
tion of*China, such an accusation has a 
ertain logic. 
But Lin Piao would have been justified 
in feeling some qualms about using capi-
alism to save Maoism from revisionism. 
[he logic of the Nixon visit and the inflow 
tf Western tourists and technology that has 
followed is deeply disturbing to a people 
who have long been so isolated and who 
`iave made 'self-reliance' such a basic prin-
dole of life, let alone foreign policy. One 
sf the purposes of the present campaign 
S to stop people slipping into dependence. 
Asked for examples of Confucian in-
luchce in he Shanghai truck factory, Com-
side Wu king replies: 'Liu Shao-chi said 
eve should import foreign cars, not build 
hem in China. That's Worship of foreign 
elpital.' En the Canton bicycle factory. 
Comrade Ching Chai explains that one ex-
simple of Lin Piao's influence in the plant 
,ccurred when 'a group of' technicianshere 
cfused to take the mass line and ask \voi-
ces advice as to how to build an electro-
slating machine. 'Instead, they locked them-
astves up and studied plans of Western 
machines. The one they produced was hopeiessly unsuitable to our conditions. Just be-
cause they had not Consulted the workers.' 
in Peking a senior trade official explains 
China's import ?policy 'We. Won't import 
what we don't need. China will industrialise 
at its own pace. We won't do anything to 
harm the policy of self-reliance. For ex-
ample we import aircraft not only for fly-
ing but also to increase our knowledge of 
Iii eir manufacture. Imports of technology 
.lo not go against the policy of self-
reliance.' 
But, however intense the propaganda, 
the new contact with foreigners is bound to 
be unsettling. There are now Chinese tech-
Britain, 200 more in France. American 
technicians have been to the Taching oil-
fields in Manchuria. thee are German and 
Dutch engineers in many differenteareas and 
dozens of tourists arrive every day, They 
are all treated with exceptional courtesy, 
they stay in expensive and secluded hotels, 
they have their own guides assigned them, 
they are driven around in their own cars 
or huses; inevitably their special treatment 
causes some popular resentment. After all, 
the only contact that many Chinese have 
had with foreign industry is the -hideous 
exploitation they suffered in British-owned 
and other sweat-shops. 
I.t is in this context that the present cam-
paign has developed since the party con-
Asress in August. The congress took place 
with a call from Red Flag, the party's 
official . journal, 'for 'a revolution in the 
superstructure'. It began with a cut in the 
political power of the army at the centre --
reducing its share of the Central Committee 
from 45 per cent to 33.4 per cent and its 
numbers on the Politburo from 12 to 7 out 
of 25. In January the PLA's provincial in-
fluence was cut when nine regional com-
manders were. moved from the semi-inde-
pendent kingdoms they had constructed over 
the years. As a further put-down to the 
political power of the army, no new Mini-
ster of Defence was named. 
The session . was quietly dominated by 
Chou En-lai, but the mistake of 1969 was 
not repeated ? no single successor to Mao 
was endorsed. Instead a genuinely collective 
leadership was created just below the Chair-
man. Into it climbed Wang Hung-wen, a 38-
year-old Shanghai firebrand who had burst 
into prominence during the Cultural Re-
volution in Shanghai, China' e most revolu-
tionary city. His promotion would have been 
remarkable only for his age ? the average 
ago of the Politburo is 67. With Wang 
came Chang Chun-chiao, often described 
as another prominent member of the 
,Shanghai radical mita'. These two, to-
gether with Mrs Mao ? Chang Ching, whose 
hand is seen behind the present upheavals 
in culture ? area said to form the vanguard 
of 'leftist' members of the party. 
But if so they" were balanced by the re-
turn of many Cadres disgraced during the 
Cultural Revolution. These three years. had 
caused an enormous drain on administrative 
skills which, unlike zeal, cannot simply be 
invoked. The lbadership has apparently de-
cided that there comes a level of manage-
ment at which ideological assertions iiist 
do not replace administrative knowledge. 
Last year saw the rehabilitation of some 60 
former Central Committee members who 
were denounced and dismissed during the 
Cultural Revolution! Prominent among 
them was Teng Elsaoi-peng ? once second 
April and raised to the Politburo in January. 
The trouble with these labels .of 'Mo-
derate', 'radical' and 'rightist' is that we 
have very little idea what they inean in 
terms Of policy. It is entirely reasonable 
to suppose that tensions might develop 
between those now restored to power and 
those who climbed there by denouncing 
them. And there is no reason to imagine 
that members of the Politburo do not, like 
members of most other governments, have 
policy differences. For instance, it may he 
that .the 'radicals' don't really want to be. 
bothered by the strategic considerations of 
foreign policy ? they are concerned only with 
its effect on Chinese society. But from this to 
the current China-watchers' orthodoxy 
that the leadership now contains the mo-
derates led by Chou, the unidentified pro-
Soviet tin Piaoists, and the radicals who 
are out to get Chou, is a very great leap 
indeed. 
At the congress it was Wang who stated 
what has since become. the keynote of the 
new campaign at the popular level that 
there had been backsliding since the Cul-
tural Revolution and that petty-bourgeois 
tendencies had been allowed to creep back. 
He recalled Mao's theory or the need for 
perpetual revolution because 'every seven 
or eight years monsters and demons will 
jump up themselves'. It is in this spirit that 
the popular level of the campaign (described 
in the previous article, NS 29 March) has 
developed. 
The first attacks on Confucius,, whose 
philosophy of ordered organisation has cer-
tainly had a very profound and largely 
conservative effect on Chinese society for 
2,000 years, began before the congress, but 
Lin Than did not emerge as his spirituAl 
successor and the real villain of the moment 
until autumn had chilled into Peking winter. 
This chronology led some China-watchers 
to speculate that the attack on Confucius 
had begun as an attack by the radicals 
against Chou (many of the early articles 
appeared in Shanghai) but that Chou had 
subsequently taken it over and redirected 
it towards Lin Piao (it was in Peking papers 
?'that the Lin Piao-Confucius link wa; first 
forged). 
This could be true. It could equally well 
be true that Chou has masterminded .the 
whole campaign from the start. It is also 
possible that he is about to be destroyed by 
it. We do not really know. Among China-
watchers there tends to be 'clear territorial 
division of opinion on Chou's present posi-
tion: in 1-lorig Kong they fear for his future 
and consider he is under increasingly severe 
attack, especially from such 'radicals' as 
Mrs Mao; in Peking diplomats and journa-
lists tend to think he is in control of the 
movement. There is, however, agreement

CPYRGHT_ 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000100690001-0 
that if Chou is under attack, then it is at 
hast partly for the way in which the 
Washington connection has developed and 
especially Nixon's failure really to reduce 
his commitment to Taiwan or to end the 
war in hidochina. 
One Puking-based diplomat declares: 'I 
think perhaps the only real opposition to 
Chou now is in the PLA and at a provincial 
level. The army is still very upset by the 
changes in January which destroyed a life-
time Of concentrating power.' 
The confusion engendered by arcane at-
tacks on provincial operas, by the. unusual 
..latention paid recently to Chiang Ching, by 
fact that Chou En-lai himself has be 
gun to complain ,to visitors that he is 'dis-
appointed' by some aspects of the new 
American relationship, and especially by 
the hyperbolic assaults on as yet unnamed 
enemies ? in senior positions: all this sug-
gests a state of total flux in Chinese poli-
tics which could cause an upheaval as great 
as that of the Cultural Revolution. 
But there are still many constants. Chief 
among them are the political and the mili-
tary threats of 'Soviet capitalism'. Certainly 
the enlistment of Nixon as a buffer against 
those threats is traumatic for many Chinese, 
and the attacks on 'bourgeois influences' ? 
like Beethoven ? can be seen as a sop to 
such criticism. Mao has deliberately in-
stalled a coalition to survive him .and it 
would be absurd to expect that such a 
coalition should not contain differences of 
opinion. At a priestly level, the present 
campaign reflects some of them. It reflects 
also Mao's lifelong conviction that the 
purity of. the Revolution cannot be main-
tained 'without periodic upheaval. Most 
Chinese .now alive have not been through 
the fire of Liberation: they know nothing 
of the struggles of civil war. Mao has al-
ways, believed that if conditions of ad-
versity do not exist, then they must be in-
vented. Out of chaos comes 'strength; out 
of calm, complacency. 
The campaign reflects too the difficul-
ties of reconciling the need for an ele-
ment in the administrative sector which can 
take full advantage of the imports of Western 
technology with the need to prevent an 
elitist management class from emerging. it 
reflects the different and sometimes ap-
parently contradictory ways in which the 
Soviet military and political threats have 
to be countered. 
The campaign will certainly produce a 
purge at sonic level. But few people in China 
say they think it will involve such violent 
disruptions as the Cultural Revolution. They 
tell you that the present movement is de-
signed only to consolidate the achievements 
of 1966-69. But there arc already scattered 
reports of fighting in Wuhan and Hang-
chow, party officials were last week at-
tacked by name for the first time and the 
People's Daily declared: 'Long Live the 
Revolutionary Violence.' The present cam-
paign is another stage in the Chinese Revo-
lution and very few people in China itself 
have much idea how it will develop. Al-
though the Chinese don't flash the Little 
Red Book too much nowadays they can 
read in it what Mao said in 1927: 'A 
revolution is not a dinner party, or writ-
ing an essay, or painting a picture, or 
doing embroidery: it cannot be so refined, 
so leisurely, and gentle, so temperate. kind, 
courteous and magnanimous. A revolution 
is an acc of violence by which one class 
overthrows another.' The Revolution con-
tinues still.
