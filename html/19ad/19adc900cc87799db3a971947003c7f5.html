 China's Growin Export
 Competitiveness
 Since the death of Mao Zedong, China's leaders have become more
 outward looking in their strategy for China's economic development. Not
 only, have they accepted foreign investment and loans, they also have come
 to view foreign trade as an engine of growth.
 Beijing's dual programs of economic "readjustment" and "reform," an-
 nounced in early 1979, complement its new policy of greater openness to
 the West. The readjustment policy aims at reducing investment in capital-
 intensive heavy industry and boosting output of labor-intensive light
 industry. This will make China more competitive in the world market.
 Reform policies, on the other hand, were designed to improve the
 functioning of markets. This program has encountered many problems in
 the foreign trade area, primarily because domestic prices do not reflect the
 free interplay of supply and demand. Instead of returning to direct central
 controls over foreign trade, however, Beijing has attempted to use "eco-
 nomic levers"-including export tariffs and quotas-to remedy these
 malfunctions. It has yet to resolve the conflicts between its plan goals and
 the dictates of the market.
 This paper examines the relationships between China's exports and
 domestic factors of production-land, labor, capital, and resources. We
 find that, despite the microeconomic deficiencies of the present system,
 China's trade patterns are becoming more rational. China increasingly is
 doing what a comparably endowed free market economy would do:
 exporting labor- and resource-intensive goods and importing capital-
 intensive goods. Nevertheless, China's domestic economy is still geared
 toward the production of capital-intensive goods, a legacy of China's past
 pursuit of the Stalinist model of development. Failure to specialize in the
 production of labor-intensive goods has diminished China's potential gains
 from trade.
 In the past, the Chinese viewed exports solely as a means of paying for im-
 ports. Now Beijing is finding additional reasons to expand exports. During
 the current five-year plan (1981-85) China must absorb nearly 100 million
 new people into its labor force-a number equal to the present size of the
 total US labor force. Under pressure to raise living standards quickly,
 Beijing realizes that expanding production and export of labor-intensive
 goods is one of the best ways to boost real wages and, therefore, Chinese
 living standards.

 Based on the model we developed for this paper, we have estimated the ef-
 fect on exports of changes in China's capital stock, employment, and
 output during the current five-year plan. Those factors, which explain
 about 60 percent of the pattern of China's exports, suggest that between
 now and 1985:
 ? China's exports of machinery and equipment-in particular, household
 equipment, electronics, and precision instruments-will experience the
 largest percentage growth.
 ? China will capture a slightly larger share of the world textile and apparel
 market than its current 7 percent.
 ? China's exports of oil are likely to fall as the rate of growth of output de-
 clines and capital costs increase.
 Although China's growing involvement in world trade will help to alleviate
 its own growing pains, China's increasing export competitiveness may
 create problems for the rest of the world. Domestic US producers have
 already filed complaints with the US International Trade Commission
 alleging unfair Chinese trade practices on sales of a variety of commod-
 ities. Chinese efforts to gain a greater share of world market-now only
 1 percent of the total-will cause increasing friction with its LDC
 competitors as well.

 China's Growing Export
 Competitiveness ~
 Introduction
 In the past seven years China has moved steadily
 toward greater participation in the world economy.
 Beijing has overcome its ideological aversion to both
 foreign debt and foreign investment, established more
 extensive trade relations with the West, joined the
 International Monetary Fund and World Bank, de-
 centralized its trade organizations, and sent thousands
 of students abroad to obtain Western educations.F_
 More importantly, fundamental Chinese attitudes
 about the role of trade in a planned economy are
 changing. Imports are no longer viewed solely as an
 instrument to serve the direct needs or interests of the
 central government; they are increasingly being used
 as a means of directly satisfying consumer needs.
 Exports are no longer seen purely as a means of
 paying for imports but also as a dynamo for domestic
 economic development.
 Beijing is seeking an infusion of Western technology
 into its export industries in order to help modernize
 industry at large. By encouraging China's sleepy
 domestic industries to compete to sell goods in West-
 ern markets, the leadership hopes to improve the
 quality of goods produced for the domestic market as
 well.
 Beijing is also becoming aware of the benefits to
 employment of expanding exports. Within the current
 five-year plan China must absorb nearly 100 million
 new workers into the labor force-equal to the present
 size of the total US labor force. Productivity and wage
 rates are much higher in the export sector than
 elsewhere. Promoting exports will help to alleviate the
 massive problem of finding jobs and raising living
 standards for the people
 'Although this paper provides a forecast of Chinese export growth,
 much of the paper is not focused directly on the estimate, but rather
 on its analytical foundations. As much as possible, supporting
 technical material has been put in appendixes. But there is more
 methodological scaffolding left in the body of the text than there is
 in most of this Directorate's published product. Our intent is to
 share with the reader the analytical foundations of one approach to

 The Chinese are no longer content to export a little of
 everything they produce. Instead, they are beginning
 to realize that, in order to maximize the gains from
 trade, they must shift the pattern of domestic produc-
 tion into labor-intensive industries. They are aware
 that increasing specialization of production will entail
 much greater dependence on the rest of the world
 Trade Patterns Under the Stalinist Model
 This new attitude contrasts sharply with Beijing's

 earlier goal of becoming self-reliant. During the first
 30 years of Communist rule, China severely limited
 its participation in the international economy: China's
 share of world trade dropped from its prewar peak of
 almost 2 percent to less than 0.5 percent. Before 1979,
 China never derived more than 3 percent of its GNP
 from exports, probably the smallest proportion for any
 country (see table 1).

 The foreign trade behavior of centrally planned econ-
 omies traditionally has been marked by a high degree
 of self-sufficiency, currency inconvertibility, discrimi-
 nation, and bilateralism. Under Mao, China certainly
 displayed the first three characteristics, but Beijing's
 break with the Soviet Bloc in 1960 significantly
 diminished the role of bilateral barter arrangements
 in its foreign trade. 2 These trading characteristics
 result naturally from other common features of these
 economies, namely "irrational" internal price struc-
 tures' and exchange rates, state trading, overcommit-
 ment of resources, quantity targeting, and the system
 of material balances.
 Irrational pricing was a major deterrent to trade.
 Following the Marxist "labor" theory of value, Chi-
 na's Bureau of Commodity Prices often set prices at
 levels that did not fully account for rent, interest, and
 depreciation costs. These administered prices were
 insensitive to fluctuations in supply and demand. As a
 result, the price structure did not reflect real costs,
 but instead contained implicit subsidies and taxes.
 Under these circumstances, free trade and currency
 convertibility could not be allowed. Permitting for-
 eigners to trade freely at domestic (subsidized) prices
 would have produced windfall gains for the foreigners
 and equally large losses for China. Therefore, state
 corporations were given exclusive control over trade.
 State trading had two important consequences for the
 pattern of China's trade. First, foreign trade was
 conducted primarily to obtain imports the state con-
 sidered essential. Consumer goods did not count
 heavily in the planners' calculations. As a result,
 China's imports were more concentrated than they
 would have been in a market setting. Figure 1 com-
 pares the degree of concentration of China's imports
 in 1975 with those of several market economies, using
 Lorenz curve techniques. ` Steel, heavy machinery,
 fallen to only 6 percent of China's total trade.
 ' Two-digit SITC commodities were ranked in terms of the amount
 of foreign exchange spent on them, and cumulative expenditure
 shares are measured on the vertical axis. A diagonal across the
 Lorenz box would indicate that an equal amount of foreign
 exchange was spent on each two-digit commodity group

 Percentage share of importable commodities
 nonferrous metals, fertilizers, grain, and textile fibers
 accounted for nearly 85 percent of China's foreign
 exchange expenditures.
 Second, under state trading, the only rationale for
 exporting was to earn enough foreign exchange to
 finance needed imports. Lacking other incentives to
 export, the Chinese lapsed into viewing exporting as a
 means of unloading unwanted domestic goods, and
 hence they showed little concern for improving the
 quality of their exports or penetrating new markets.
 As a result, exports were dispersed across a variety of
 commodities and markets. Figure 2 compares the
 degree of concentration of China's exports with those

 Revenues, 1975
 of several market economies. China's exports were not
 only more diversified than those of any market econo-
 my we examined, but also more diversified than its
 own imports-perhaps a unique case.
 Moreover, Chinese planners actively tried to diversify
 exports, because this policy offered the perceived
 benefit of minimizing risks. Adverse foreign economic
 situations could have little impact on China's foreign
 trade plans, since no single commodity accounted for
 more than a small share of foreign exchange earnings.
 Furthermore, the planning authorities knew that even
 if the wrong commodities were exported the losses
 resulting from the misallocation of resources would be
 small compared with the clear gains from needed
 imports.
 Beijing also pursued "overfull employment planning."
 Taut planning led to a seller's market and to a lack of
 concern for the quality of output. The resulting excess
 demand by consumers for final products and by
 enterprises for factors of production and intermediate
 products expressed itself either as open or repressed
 inflation. Over time, the Chinese found that they were
 sustaining greater and greater losses on exports-and
 profits on imports-at the official exchange rate.
 These factors worked together to reduce the incen-
 tives for expanding exports.
 Quantity targeting and the system of material bal-
 ances also have contributed to China's autarkic bias.
 Because of the complicated input-output relationships
 between intermediate and final products, planners
 tried to avoid becoming dependent on foreign supplies
 in order to insulate the domestic economy from the
 vagaries of the world market. Moreover, the use of
 quantity targeting in foreign trade often led to per-
 verse economic results, depending on whether "quan-
 tities" were expressed in physical or foreign exchange
 units.
 On the export side, if a certain physical quantity of
 goods was earmarked for export, China's foreign
 trade corporations (FTCs) strove to export that precise
 amount, regardless of world price fluctuations. As a
 result, the Chinese moved slowly to expand supplies
 available for export when world prices increased. In
 fact, for many export commodities, the Chinese re-
 sponse was just the opposite-perhaps an indication
 that China engaged in "foreign exchange targeting."
 If the price of a commodity increased significantly,
 earnings apparently exceeded the foreign exchange
 target sufficiently that the FTCs could reduce the
 physical quantities exported. Conversely, if the price
 fell, the Chinese ended up exporting more in order to
 meet their target for foreign exchange earnings from
 the particular commodity.' The FTCs, of course,
 could only maintain this sort of perverse, backward-
 bending supply curve behavior in the short run. Over

 the longer term, presumably, the Chinese would have
 adjusted their plans so as to export smaller quantities
 of commodities suffering from secularly declining
 prices
 On the import side, however, this sort of "foreign
 exchange rationing" appeared to increase Chinese
 sensitivity to changes in foreign prices and led to
 exaggerated quantity responses-if foreign prices
 rose, the Chinese immediately cut purchases in order
 to keep foreign exchange outlays from exceeding the
 allotted amount. Perhaps because of China's policy of
 self-reliance (particularly, its unwillingnesss to accept
 foreign debt), the Chinese were reluctant to run trade
 deficits and, hence, overreacted to changes in import
 prices, especially increases.
 In the absence of reliable market signals, politics
 often intruded into decisions on how much and what
 commodities China ought to trade. Internal debate
 over whether China should export oil, for example,
 cropped up shortly after OPEC's initial price hike in
 early 1973 substantially boosted the opportunity cost
 to China of not selling its oil abroad. This was one of
 many international economic issues that divided the
 "radicals" and the "moderates" in Beijing prior to the
 death of Mao Zedong in 1976.6
 Trade Policies in the Post-Mao Period
 Mao's successors, led by Deng Xiaoping, have taken
 major steps to change the economic system. The
 changes instituted since late 1978 have fallen under
 the rubric of either economic readjustment or eco-
 nomic reform. Under the readjustment program, Chi-
 na's overall macroeconomic goals were completely re-
 evaluated. Investment was to be scaled back in favor
 of more consumption; heavy industry, the focus of
 both trade and domestic economic policy before 1979,
 was to be deemphasized in favor of light industry and
 agriculture. By diverting funds from heavy to light
 industry, the Chinese expected to reap a larger return
 on investment, and in much less time. The reform
 program, on the other hand, attempted to tackle

 microeconomic problems by making enterprises re-
 sponsible for their own profits, promoting price re-
 forms, and changing work incentives. These reforms
 would permit the development of a framework of rules
 capable of giving China more marketlike signals.
 The Chinese also began to rethink their export poli-
 cies. Articles in the Chinese press extolled the econo-
 mies of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan--countries
 which developed through the promotion of export
 industries. Chinese economists called for the country
 to specialize along the lines of its comparative advan-
 tage-labor-intensive industries-in order to maxi-
 mize the gains from trade.
 These policy changes have had a major impact on
 China's foreign trade. From 1977 to 1981 China's
 exports grew at a rate of over 25 percent a year,
 second in the world only to Mexico, where vast oil
 discoveries spurred exports. China's exports now ac-
 count for between 5 and 7 percent of its GNP, and
 more than 1 percent of world trade.
 The readjustment has resulted in a sharp reduction in
 imports of machinery and transport equipment, steel,
 nonferrous metals, and other supplies for heavy indus-
 try. Imports of consumer goods and supplies for light
 industry, on the other hand, have increased signifi-
 cantly. The readjustment has had a similar-but less
 apparent-impact on the export side. The proportion
 of heavy industrial exports has declined, while that of
 light industry has risen. Under the readjustment,
 China's exports have become much more concen-
 trated, while imports have become more diversified
 (see figure 3).
 On the other hand, the introduction of the economic
 reform package, with its emphasis on making individ-
 ual enterprises responsible for their own profits and
 losses, has created major problems for the Chinese.

 Import Expenditures, 1975 and 1980
 decentralize decisionmaking, Beijing has had to shuf-
 fle lines of authority continuously in an effort to deal
 with an irrational domestic price structure and ex-
 change rate
 Initially, in 1980, Beijing found that at the official
 exchange rate of 1.5 yuan per dollar local producers
 quit exporting many commodities that the Ministry of
 Foreign Trade had previously exported because those
 commodities were no longer profitable. On the other
 hand, importing became much more attractive. Many
 enterprises purchased a variety of consumer products
 in the Hong Kong market for distribution to their
 employees-watches, pocket calculators, televisions,
 and motorcycles. Others began searching abroad for
 equipment purchases. By late 1980, China had devel-
 oped a sizable trade deficit.
 Beijing therefore took steps to remedy these market
 malfunctions, first, by providing enticements for en-
 terprises to boost exports, and, second, by removing
 incentives to import. In early 1981 municipal and
 provincial enterprises were granted the authority to
 retain up to 30 percent of foreign exchange earnings
 for their own use. At the same time Beijing estab-
 lished a more favorable "internal" yuan-dollar ex-
 change rate of 2.8 to 1 (compared with the official
 rate) that would permit domestic firms to earn larger
 profits on exports. This "internal settlement" rate also
 acted to curb imports. And at the end of March 1981
 Beijing imposed foreign exchange controls on local
 enterprises, which required them to deposit all their
 foreign exchange earnings with the Bank of China,
 thus cutting off an uncontrolled source of spending.
 These policy changes immediately altered China's
 trade balance. Beijing converted a $500 million first-
 quarter deficit into a $1 billion second-quarter sur-
 plus. For the past seven quarters the Chinese have
 averaged surpluses of $1.5 billion per quarter. Despite
 this success, Beijing found that the higher 2.8-yuan-
 per-dollar exchange rate was not a panacea for all its
 trade ills.
 Local producers, whose domestic costs were subsi-
 dized, began to cut their export prices in an effort to
 sell their goods abroad; they also tended to pay higher
 prices for imports than before, when the Ministry of
 Foreign Trade handled all negotiations. As a result,
 China's terms of trade, a key indicator planned
 economies use to determine the efficiency of foreign
 trade, began to deteriorate. Furthermore, shortages
 began to appear for commodities that were under-
 priced domestically: small producers siphoned off
 scarce resources for processing into exports, compet-
 ing with large, efficiently run firms for foreign ex-
 change.
 In short, the decentralization of foreign trade, in the
 absence of a rational internal price structure, may not
 have yielded any better results than the more central-
 ized system that preceded it. China, however, has not
 scrapped its reform efforts. Instead of returning to a
 system of direct central administration of foreign

 trade, Beijing has attempted to use "economic levers"
 to influence the behavior of independent domestic
 enterprises. In March 1982 China instituted a new
 system of tariffs, covering about 10 percent of its
 exports, which was designed to raise the foreign
 exchange prices of commodities that local producers
 had previously cut. In June, Beijing also established
 an export-licensing scheme, administered by the new
 Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
 (MFERT), which allocated export quotas among pro-
 ducers in order to prevent domestic shortages. Beijing
 also imposed restrictions on imports of certain West-
 ern consumer goods in order to protect its domestic
 industries. In April 1983 Beijing revised its tax codes
 and tariffs on joint ventures in order to eliminate
 certain distortions that had become apparent in the
 previous regulations.
 In a market economy, such measures would represent
 an intrusion of the central government into the opera-
 tions of the market and would themselves cause a
 distortion of the optimal allocation of resources. For
 China, however, these measures probably should be
 viewed as a "second best" solution, pending a major
 realignment of domestic prices. Beijing clearly wants
 to use these measures to encourage a pattern of trade
 and domestic production that reflects China's eco-
 nomic conditions-its masses of low-paid workers and
 abundance of natural resources and its scarcity of
 arable land, advanced technology, and capital.
 China's Comparative Advantage'
 In order to assess how far China has progressed
 toward a market pattern of foreign trade, we will
 compare the composition of China's industrial exports
 in 1981 with the pattern that would be predicted by
 the Heckscher-Ohlin model of foreign trade." That
 model postulates that, under certain restrictive as-
 sumptions, a market economy will export commodities
 ' The principle of comparative advantage contradicts the commonly
 held notion that it is necessary for a country to have an absolute
 advantage in productivity in some product in order to be competi-
 tive. Even in the extreme case of a country that is absolutely less
 productive than any other country in all lines of production, that
 country will still gain from trade by exporting those goods that it
 produces the least inefficiently and importing those goods it
 produces most inefficiently.
 ' We have chosen 1981 for this study because it is the year for
 which the best cross-sectional data for Chinese industries are
 available.
 whose production requires relatively intensive use of
 productive factors-land, labor, capital, and re-
 sources-found locally in relative abundance. That
 same economy will import commodities that require
 relatively intensive use of the country's scarce factors
 of production.
 The Heckscher-Ohlin model of foreign trade, how-
 ever, is essentially a supply-side model-and demand
 conditions can significantly alter the trade patterns
 predicted by it. For example, if a country has a
 natural production bias toward capital-intensive goods
 because it possesses large endowments of capital
 relative to labor, that country may still end up
 importing capital-intensive goods because of heavy
 domestic demand for such goods. The results depend
 on how relative factor abundance is defined. Only if
 factor abundance is defined in terms of relative factor
 prices 10 does it necessarily follow that a capital-rich
 country will export capital-intensive goods and a
 labor-rich country will export labor-intensive goods.
 If, instead, factor abundance is defined in terms of
 physical endowments, it is still true that a capital-rich
 country must produce relatively more of the capital-
 intensive goods, but it will not necessarily export
 them.
 By either definition, China is a labor-rich, capital-
 poor country. Table 2 compares China's labor force
 with that of the OECD and CEMA countries for
 1979. China's 400 million workers equal more than
 four-fifths the combined labor force of the OECD and
 CEMA countries. In absolute terms, China has more
 people employed in industry than any other country of
 the world. But in relative terms, only a small portion
 of the total labor force works in industry. Reflecting
 China's status as a less developed country, nearly
 three-fourths of the labor force is employed in the
 agricultural sector, in sharp contrast to the OECD
 countries (where less than 10 percent are so employed)
 and the CEMA countries (less than one-fourth). Fur-
 thermore, China's services sector is relatively small in
 comparison to those of the OECD and CEMA coun-
 tries, where services employ over half of the total
 labor force.

 Lack of capital is largely to blame for the low level of
 labor productivity in China. Table 3 shows the distri-
 bution of labor, capital, and output by major sector in
 1979. The overall capital-labor ratio of $770 per
 worker " is on the order of one-fiftieth that of the
 OECD countries and less than one one-hundredth the
 " Capital stock and output data for 1979 have been converted to
 US dollars at the official exchange rate of 1.555 yuan per US
 dollar. These figures are presented only as an indicator of the order
 of magnitude because we do not have an accurate exchange rate for
 comparing social welfare. If the "internal settlement" rate of 2.8
 yuan per dollar were used to convert the data, the capital and
 amount of capital employed with the average US
 worker. Nevertheless, the average worker in China
 produces roughly $970 worth of goods per year-one-
 thirtieth that of his US counterpart. His average
 wage-excluding various subsidies-amounts to
 about $500 per year, or roughly 20 cents per hour

 the amount of capital made available to light indus-
 try: the capital-output ratio in heavy industry was
 1.1:1, whereas in light industry, only about 0.2:1. In
 other words, to produce 1 yuan's worth of heavy
 industrial products in 1979 required 1.1 yuan in
 capital. One yuan of output from light industry could
 be produced with only 0.2 yuan in capital-five times
 the return from 1 yuan invested in heavy industry,_
 Unfortunately, aggregate measures are not available
 for international comparisons of resource abundance.
 The low level of arable land per agricultural worker in
 China-one-third hectare-of course dictates a labor-
 intensive form of agriculture. It follows that any
 exports from that sector should be of the labor-
 intensive variety-mushrooms, rice, truck farming,
 and so on. In absolute terms-as opposed to a per
 capita basis-China possesses some of the world's
 largest untapped reserves of iron ore, coal, copper, tin,
 tungsten, antimony, mercury, molybdenum, gallium,
 and fluorspar, as well as significant reserves of petro-
 leum, bauxite, nickel, lead, titanium, tantalun, vana-
 dium, bismuth, and manganese. Moreover, China's
 nonmetallic mineral deposits are sizable. Therefore,
 China probably can best be characterized as having a
 comparative advantage in producing both labor-inten-
 sive and certain resource-intensive commodities.
 Table 4 ranks China's industries by capital intensity,
 in low to high order. Because the Chinese economy is
 undoubtedly one of the most labor intensive, the list
 ranks industries according to China's comparative
 advantage. 12 The exceptions would be for those indus-
 tries in which China has large endowments of natural
 resources, such as oil and coal, where exploitation
 costs are a direct, inverse function of the abundance
 of the commodity. A cursory examination of the list
 suggests there is some degree of negative correlation
 between the capital intensity of China's industry and
 China's export share of the world market: China's
 market share tends to be greater the more labor
 intensive the industry. In appendix A we have used
 regression analysis to measure these relationships
 quantitatively.
 Our calculations suggest that at least 25 percent of
 Chinese trade behavior conformed to the Heckscher-
 Ohlin predictions. The regression equation we have
 estimated for 1981 shows that as the labor intensity of
 domestic production increased so did exports. (Alter-
 natively, as capital intensity increased exports con-
 tracted.) Exports also tended to vary positively with
 the availability of natural resources. The availability
 of a variety of natural resources reduced exploitation
 costs and, in turn, gave China a comparative advan-
 tage in the world market
 " Ranking goods according to the factor intensities with which they
 are produced is the equivalent of ranking them according to
 comparative advantage. For a proof of this assertion see Bo

 The results of our analysis of the 1981 data differ
 from those we obtained in a less comprehensive study
 of the available data for 1979.13 The 1979 data
 indicated that China's exports varied positively with
 the capital intensity of the industry. This was consist-
 ent with our presumption that the Chinese, operating
 under the "labor theory of value," did not adequately
 account for capital, land, and resources costs and
 hence underpriced items that employed these factors,
 while overpricing labor-intensive goods. If that were
 true, we could easily explain the observed pattern of
 foreign trade as a response to irrational price signals.
 The official data for 1981 strongly suggest, however,
 that at least in that year the Chinese did not under-
 value capital. For state-owned industrial enterprises
 as a whole, profits and taxes returned to the central
 government amounted to 92 billion Ren Min Bi
 (RMB), or 34 percent of the net value of fixed
 assets-much greater than the normal return on
 capital in the West (see appendix B). Furthermore,
 total profits and taxes were more than three times the
 total expenditures on wages for those state-owned
 units. Quite unlike industry in the West, where wages
 are generally the largest proportion of total costs, in
 China, wages were only 10 percent of costs. Thus we
 cannot automatically assume that Chinese methods of
 price formation are consistently biased against capital
 and in favor of labor. Indeed, our empirical findings
 for 1981 suggest that China has achieved a degree of
 rationality in foreign trade indicative of an economic
 system where prices reflect true costs.
 On a different score, however, our cross-sectional data
 indicate that in 1981 China still was not taking full
 advantage of the potential gains from international
 trade. Those gains consist of two parts: one depending
 on the possibility for exchange, the other on the
 possibility for specialization in production (see appen-
 dix E). More than 30 percent of China's export
 13 In our cross-sectional analysis of 1979 data we used investment
 per laborer as a proxy for capital stock per laborer, since data on
 the net value of fixed assets were not available. Our estimated
 regression equation was:
 X= -144.92 + 20.588 (I/L) + .02937 (V)
 where: I/L= investment per worker in thousand RMB
 X= exports, in million US $
 V= GVIO, in million RMB.
 pattern was explained by the pattern of domestic
 production. As domestic output of a particular indus-
 try increased, so did exports. Domestic output, how-
 ever, was positively correlated with capital intensity, a
 reflection of the demands of China's central planners
 for more capital-intensive goods. By failing to special-
 ize in the production of labor-intensive goods, China
 was not maximizing the gains from international
 trade. Indeed, by tending to specialize in the produc-
 tion of capital-intensive goods, China probably failed
 to obtain most of the gains that international trade
 has to offer
 Nevertheless, China appears to be making progress.
 During the current five-year plan, Beijing's priorities
 are:
 ? Renovation of existing facilities, particularly small
 projects that require less investment, yield quick
 returns, and generate a stream of foreign exchange
 earnings.
 ? Exploration and development of energy resources,
 especially power, coal, and oil.
 ? Construction and expansion of transport and com-
 munications facilities, especially railways, ports, and
 telecommunications systems. This will reduce inter-
 nal costs so as to make all industries more competi-
 tive in the world market.
 The ongoing readjustments and reform of the eco-
 nomic system that began in late 1978 are leading
 China to increased production of labor-intensive, light
 industrial goods, consistent with-China's comparative
 advantage. Ultimately, this will promote a more
 thorough integration of China into the world eco-
 nomic system.
 Implications
 For China. We have used our model of China's trade
 to analyze the probable impact of changes in domestic
 production factors on the commodity composition of
 China's exports during the current five-year plan
 (1981-85). The particular factors we have.examined in

 e Growth rates for capital stock and GVIO are estimated from
 official data on the five-year plan. Growth rates for number of
 laborers are based on the rate of growth in 1981 and the average
 annual growth rate for 1977-81. The projections for change in
 China's export share of the world market assume that the state
 share of production and the resource intensity of each industry
 remains constant.
 b From a zero share to a positive share.
 the model explain about 60 percent of the variation in
 China's commodity trade patterns. A host of other
 factors account for the remaining variation in China's
 export shares of the world market, including changes
 in international supply and demand, regional consid-
 erations such as domestic and international transport
 costs, irrational internal pricing, national security
 considerations, and even local and international poli-
 tics. Our projections assume these factors remain
 constant.
 Table 5 presents two scenarios for the growth of
 China's exports, based on China's current five-year
 plan targets for output and likely trends in the growth
 of capital and labor. "Predicted" Chinese export
 shares of the world market for 1985 were compared
 with the predicted shares for 1981, and the annual
 percentage gains over the four years are presented.
 The low end of the range for export growth is always
 associated with the higher capital growth figures.
 On the basis of Chinese supply-side factors alone, our
 model suggests that exports of the machinebuilding
 industry will show the fastest growth between 1981
 and 1985 (as much as a 29-percent increase in China's   25X1
 share of the world market). The industry will become
 more labor intensive, especially if the capital stock

 Approved For Release 2007/11/27: CIA-RDP84SO0553R000300030004-0
 declines. This factor alone should reduce real costs (as
 producers shift away from using relatively expensive
 capital) and make exports more competitive. Never-
 theless, laborers within this industry are becoming
 more productive-despite the declining capital avail-
 able to them-because of improvements in technology
 and in the skills of the workforce. As a result, output
 is scheduled to increase more than in any other
 industry, providing further impetus to exports
 Although China's export share of the world market
 for machinery should show the largest percentage
 growth, the textile and clothing sectors should provide
 a slightly larger boost to export earnings. China's
 share of the world market for these products should
 increase by about 8 to 10 percent over the current
 shares. Most of the increase will be caused by increas-
 ing labor intensity in these two industries and, as a
 result, the decline in real costs per unit of output.
 These industries are slated to absorb a sizable share of
 the estimated 100 million workers that will have
 entered the labor force between 1980 and 1985.F-
 Our model is most pessimistic with regard to the
 prospects for exports of petroleum, predicting that
 China's export share of the world market could
 decline by more than 50 percent by 1985.`^ This
 results in part from increasing capital intensity within
 the industry, which will substantially increase the
 costs of whatever oil is recovered, and in part from the
 sharply declining productivity of both capital and
 labor. With output scheduled to increased only 0.7
 percent between 1980 and 1985, the Chinese leader-
 ship will face increasing pressure to retain the oil for
 domestic use. Nevertheless, they will have to weigh
 their need for oil against their need for foreign
 exchange. They may want to keep exports at current
 levels, particularly if growing protectionism in the
 West reduces earnings from other commoditiesF_
 For the Rest of the World. China's emergence from
 years of self-imposed economic isolation will lead to
 increasing friction, not only with the developed coun-
 tries, which will be the main market for China's new
 " Although we present an alternative scenario in which the growth
 of capital stock amounts to only 7 percent and China's oil exports
 increase almost 10 percent per year, we believe this is unlikely to
 occur. If the labor force grows at only 4 to 5 percent per year,
 rather than repeating the 11-percent growth of 1981, the resulting
 increase in capital intensity of the industry is likely to hold down
 exports, but also with its LDC competitors as well.
 During the next three years of the five-year plan,
 export growth will taper off from the rapid pace of the
 late 1970s. Nevertheless, China will be attempting to
 break into established markets as it adjusts its eco-
 nomy toward the production of labor-intensive goods
 and away from many capital-intensive materials,
 which it previously exported.
 Although China's planners clearly believe that major
 gains are possible from a further expansion of trade,
 they fear that growing protectionist sentiments
 abroad may hamper their efforts. Already they have
 encountered complaints from US manufacturers that
 they are dumping products as diverse as manhole
 covers, menthol, mushrooms, clothespins, chloropic-
 rin, ammonium paratungstate, greige goods, and
 printcloth. In some of these cases the Chinese proba-
 bly have a comparative advantage-based on low
 labor costs-and are relatively efficient producers. In
 other cases, the Chinese may be exporting, despite a
 comparative disadvantage, simply because they do not
 know what their real costs are. Thus far, however, we
 do not have any evidence that the Chinese have
 engaged in "predatory" pricing tactics. In fact, in at
 least one case-ammonium paratungstate-officials
 in China's MFERT were dismayed to find that local
 producers were undercutting foreign market prices.
 They felt such behavior was detrimental to China's
 terms of trade.
 The United States may be more affected than other
 developed countries by China's export drive. China's
 current share of the US market-at 0.7 percent-is
 only half its share of the world market. Although
 China's exports to the United States have more than
 doubled in the past two years, they probably still have
 not reached their potential. In particular, Chinese
 shares of the US markets for household metal prod-
 ucts, building materials, ceramics, nonmetallic miner-
 als, wood products (rosin, for example), processed
 meats, canned goods, and leather products are far less
 than the shares they have captured in other markets.

 markets in manufactures with its eight Asian rivals-

 Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.
 Although the first four-the newly industrializing
 countries (NICs) of East Asia-are running out of
 unskilled laborers and must move into more capital-
 intensive pursuits, the rest have surplus agrarian
 laborers working at existence wages. For most prod-
 ucts, China probably will not compete directly with
 Taiwan and South Korea-wages there have risen
 rapidly in the last 10 years, and the two economies
 have moved up into higher value-added export lines.
 But China's masses of unskilled laborers will hold
 wages down in the other six countries if those coun-
 tries are to compete for markets with China.
 Over the long run, even the developed countries may
 have difficulty accommodating China's entrance into
 the world markets. Currently, 20 million of China's
 400 million workers-5 percent-are engaged in for-
 eign trade work, according to official statistics. By the
 year 2000 that number could quadruple. Increasing
 competition from China in labor-intensive industries
 will tend to drive real wages down and the returns to
 capital up in the rest of the world. A major question
 will be, "by how much?'

 Appendix A
 Statistical Methods, Sources,
 and Results
 Beijing's recent publication of detailed information on
 the domestic economy enables us for the first time to
 examine the relationship between domestic supply-
 side factors and China's international trade on an
 industrywide basis. Our previous efforts to understand
 and forecast commodity trade patterns have been
 limited to time-series analysis and to industry-specific
 microeconomic studies. This study, however, presents
 a macroeconomic cross section analysis of trade,
 factors of production, industrial output, and degree of
 state control over industry.
 Methodology
 The main objective of this paper is to test the
 hypothesis that the commodity pattern of China's
 foreign trade is economically rational, as defined by
 the Heckscher-Ohlin trade model. That model states
 that a nation's "comparative advantage" in foreign
 trade is determined by the relative scarcity of domes-
 tic factors of production, so that imports should
 intensively embody the scarce domestic factors, and
 exports the abundant factors. Therefore, trade results
 from the fact that different countries have different
 factor endowments, with one country possessing more
 labor, another more capital, yet another, more re-
 sources, and so on.
 The Heckscher-Ohlin theory of international trade is
 premised on a "perfectly competitive" world in which
 there are no transport costs or other impediments to
 trade, and in which production functions that relate
 inputs of labor, capital, and resources to outputs of
 goods behave in certain well-mannered ways. These
 assumptions never hold in practice, and econometric
 testing of the models for individual countries often
 leads to unexpected results. In the case of China,
 where prices, wages, rents, and interest rates are set
 by fiat and may not accurately reflect scarcity rela-
 tionships, a finding that China's foreign trade did
 conform with the Heckscher-Ohlin model might sug-
 gest that, despite an irrational pricing mechanism,
 planners are making economically efficient foreign
 trade decisions.
 To test the hypothesis that the actual pattern of
 China's exports reflects its comparative advantage, we
 have regressed the exports (and net exports) of each
 industry for 1981 on factor-intensity ratios for those
 industries. A regression relating China's exports (or
 net exports) to capital-labor ratios by industry will
 yield a negative sign if the Heckscher-Ohlin theory
 holds because the higher the capital intensity of an
 industry the less likely China should be to export the
 products of that industry. Similarly, a regression on
 an index of industries employing China's abundant
 resources should yield a positive sign if trade is
 Heckscher-Ohlin rational. We also have regressed
 exports on domestic production data and on the
 degree of state ownership
 Sources
 A wide range of data are available from the Statisti-
 cal Yearbook of China, 1981, published by the State
 Statistical Bureau on 44 industries for that year. For
 state-owned enterprises, this data includes informa-
 tion on the number of staff and workers, the gross and
 net value of fixed assets, investment in capital con-
 struction, the number of enterprises, the gross value of
 industrial output (GVIO) in 1970 and 1980 prices,
 profits, costs, and wages. Data are also available on    25X1
 the total GVIO of both state-owned and collective-
 owned enterprises for the same industries. Appendix B
 presents the industry data used in this study, listed
 according to the Chinese Industrial Code (CIC).
 The Chinese have not published equivalent trade data. 25X1
 For that, we have relied on our own estimates from
 trade partner statistics, which are published in China:
 International Trade, Annual Statistical Supplement
 (March 83). Because the trade data in that publication
 are categorized according to the Standard Interna-
 tional Trade Class cation, Revision 1, this research
 required the development of a concordance system

 Approved For Release 2007/11/27: CIA-RDP84SO0553R000300030004-0
 that would allow us to reaggregate trade data based
 on the CIC. That concordance system, as well as
 Chinese and world trade data based on it, are
 presented in appendixes C and D.
 Unfortunately, data on inventories by industry are not
 available to test the proposition that the Chinese
 export goods that are temporarily in surplus and
 import goods that are needed to make up for unex-
 pected shortfalls in domestic production. Since we do
 have data on the Gross Value of Industrial Output
 (GVIO), however, we are able to test the hypothesis
 that China's central planners have made an arbitrary
 decision that a set share of each industry's output
 must be exported to earn foreign exchange for the
 state.
 Furthermore, we have a means of testing what impact
 the form of ownership of domestic industry has had on
 foreign trade. Because, in addition to total GVIO,
 data are available for the component of GVIO pro-
 duced by state-owned enterprises, a ratio of the latter
 to the former provides an indicator of the degree of
 state-ownership of a particular industry. A regression
 of exports on this variable may indicate whether state
 or collectively owned enterprises are more likely to
 engage in trade.
 Because we are dealing with cross-sectional data, as a
 practical matter it is desirable to normalize variables
 so that the magnitude of the individual observations
 are independent of the broadness or narrowness of the
 defined category. Otherwise, we might find that
 exports of a particular commodity were small, for
 example, not because they embodied the country's
 scarce factor, but because the commodity was nar-
 rowly defined. For that reason, we have divided the
 Chinese export and GVIO data by world trade 15 in
 each industrial category to obtain China's export
 share of the world market and China's domestic
 output in relationship to world trade. It is these two
 variables that we have used in our model
 " The data for 1981 world trade are derived by aggregating
 commodity data that have been reported to the United Nations for
 48 countries. The 48 countries probably account for 90 to 95
 Results
 The regression equation that we have estimated for
 China's export share of the world market is:

 (3.046) (3.390)       (3.280)      (4.996)        (1.642)
 X/W = China's export share of world trade,
 in percent
 K/L = Capital to labor ratio, in thousand
 RMB per man
 R   = Proxy variable (0-1) to represent re-
 source-intensive industries
 V/W = Ratio of China's GVIO to world
 trade, in percent
 S   = State-owned enterprises' share of to-
 tal GVIO, in percent
 (Numbers in parentheses are t statistics with 39
 degrees of freedom. All variables are significant at the
 1-percent level with the exception of our state share
 variable, which is significant at the 10-percent level.
 The coefficient of determination for the equation is
 .584.)
 We have found clear evidence that in 1981 the pattern
 of China's exports behaved consistently with the
 Heckscher-Ohlin trade model. The negative coeffi-
 cient on the capital-labor ratio (-.16332) indicates
 that for each additional 1,000 RMB of capital per
 worker required to produce a commodity, China's
 export share of the world market was reduced by .16
 percentage point. Thus, even in the absence of a
 market mechanism, China's need to conserve scarce
 capital has been translated into an operational princi-
 ple by which Chinese planners restrict exports of

 capital-intensive commodities." This variable explains
 about 20 percent of the variation in China's export
 share of the world market.
 A positive coefficient on the resource proxy variable
 (+2.70890) indicates that, all other factors being
 equal, China's resource-intensive exports have cap-
 tured a larger share of the world market than nonre-
 source-intensive exports. This too is in conformity
 with Heckscher-Ohlin rational trade behavior. In
 China, resources and capital tend to be complemen-
 tary factors of production rather than substitutes for
 one another. This is reflected in a strong correlation
 between capital and resource-intensities of industries.
 The correct (opposite) signs on the coefficients of
 capital and resource variables indicate, though, that
 somehow the Chinese are able to assign opportunity
 costs to each for the purpose of deciding which goods
 to export.
 The positive coefficient (+ .01381) on the GVIO
 variable indicates that nearly 1.4 percent of each
 additional unit of output is exported." This of course
 only reflects the effects of Chinese supply-side factors
 with no change in international demand. Changes in
 China's GVIO "explain" over 30 percent of the
 variation in China's export share-the most influen-
 tial of the four variables in our regression equation.
 Nevertheless, interpretation of the meaning of our
 results is difficult because a positive relationship
 between GVIO and exports can be consistent both
 with the Heckscher-Ohlin trade model and with an
 16 We have also regressed net exports (exports minus imports) on the
 same four variables, and found less significant results. The signs on
 K/L, R, and V variables are significant at the 5-percent level. The
 coefficient on S increased, as did our confidence in that variable,
 indicating that it explains even more of the variation in China's
 imports than it did exports. A misspecification of the capital/labor
 ratio was probably responsible for a decline in the significance of
 the coefficient on that variable. The ratios that we used for the
 regression measure the capital intensities used to produce China's
 domestic output, but, if in fact China were required to produce the
 same bundle of goods that it imports, we believe the ratio would
 have been much higher, because advanced technological machinery
 and equipment-presumably highly capital-intensive products-
 " Our regression equation was designed so that the coefficient on
 the GVIO variable would in fact indicate the marginal share of
 output going to exports: X;/W;=b,+b,(VV/W;)+e;
 Multiplying both sides of this equation by W1 yields the appropriate
 arbitrary decision rule to earmark a certain share of
 domestic output for export. Only if China's capital
 stock were to expand significantly faster than labor      25X1
 would output increase while exports decline. The
 relatively rapid expansion of capital stock through
 investment in heavy industry before 1979 may explain
 in part China's previous aversion to trade, whereas a
 slowdown in the growth of capital since then has been
 an inducement to trade.
 The negative coefficient (- .03165) on the state share
 variable, although not as significant as the other
 regression coefficients, indicates that industries in
 which state-owned enterprises produce a large share
 of output tend to export less than industries in which
 collectives produce a large share. Every reduction of
 10 percentage points in the state share of output
 resulted in an increase of 0.32 percentage point in the
 Chinese share of the world market.'
 "This regression coefficient may not tell us that state-owned
 industrial enterprises are in fact more likely to engage in exporting
 than collectives. It is entirely possible that, under China's centrally
 controlled foreign trade system, only the output produced by the
 state sector gets exported. Certain state-owned plants may be
 designated as "export" enterprises, or perhaps the trade corpora-
 tions under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
 show favoritism toward state enterprises. In that case, our negative
 coefficient may have resulted not from negative correlation between
 trade and state ownership but from negative correlation between
 trade and some other factor. Industries that are primarily state
 owned, for example, may produce goods that for some reason are
 generally not exported, but rather, consumed domestically.
 In the absence of any information of this sort, however, our
 results would suggest that state-owned enterprises tend to export
 less than collectives. There could be several reasons for this: for
 example, state-owned enterprises may be more integrated at the
 national level through better communications networks. If so, they
 may trade more among themselves without having to rely on
 external markets as a vent for their surplus output. Alternatively,
 state-owned enterprises may not be as profit minded as enterprises
 that are responsible for their own profits and losses and hence do

 a The data in this table are extracted from the Statistical Yearbook
 of China, 1981 (SY81). Figures in parentheses are estimated. For
 those industries where the data were incomplete, the number of staff
 and workers were estimated by a regression equation relating
 number of workers to costs. Predicted values were then rescaled to
 ensure that the components summed to known control totals. Data
 on number of workers and staff, net value of fixed assets, profits and
 taxes, costs, and capital-labor ratio refer to state-owned enterprises
 only.
 b Estimated, using data provided to the United Nations by the
 Chinese State Statistical Bureau. Average wages per man-year for
 1979, by industry, were scaled up by average wage for all industry in
 1981 (from SY8 1), then multiplied by average man-years of labor by
 industry for 1981 to obtain the 1981 wage bill.

 Appendix E
 The gains from international trade consist of two
 parts: one depending on the possibility for exchange,
 the other on the possibility for specialization in pro-
 duction. Figure 4 illustrates these gains using the
 Figure 4
 Economic Benefits of Trade
 standard production possibility and indifference curve
 techniques. In isolation, China produces and con-
 sumes at point Co. Once trade begins, if China does
 not change its pattern of production it would continue
 producing at C,, but still could gain from trade. By
 exchanging AC,, of its labor-intensive goods for AC, of
 the rest of the world's capital-intensive goods at the
 world price ratio, Pa? China could move from indiffer-
 ence curve I, to I2, which represents a higher level of
 utility than does I. The gains from exchange could
 thus be said to consist of the movement from Co to C,.
 Gain from specialization ......;
 This, however, would not represent an optimal situa-
 tion because the ratio of transformation in production
 at Co is not equal to the ratio of substitution in
 consumption at C,. Therefore, China would be better
 off by specializing more in the production of labor-
 intensive goods by moving to S, and from there,
 trading to C2. The move from C, to C2 (or to
 indifference curve I,) can be said to represent the gain
