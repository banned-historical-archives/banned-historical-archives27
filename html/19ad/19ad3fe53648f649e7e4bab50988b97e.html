Page The Ulbricht regime has taken further moves to reduce and control access by Westerners, including West Berliners, to East Berlin and by East Germans and East Berliners to West Berlin. These controls are as yet imperfect; more than 2,000 refugees have reached West Berlin since the sector was closed on 13 August. The regime has not yet attempted to prevent Western military and diplomatic per- sonnel from visiting East Berlin, but recent moves have the effect of underlining East Germany's ability to con- trol such movement. East German leaders, although appear- ing confident of their ability to maintain control over the East German populace, nevertheless remain concerned. In public and private statements, Soviet and East German leaders are still emphasizing that the Western powers will have to negotiate with East Germany on continuing access to Berlin, after a bloc treaty is concluded this year. Khrushchev and Mikoyan, however, have sought to minimize the possibility of any imminent move against Western access, but the Soviet note of 23 August suggests that Moscow may be preparing the groundwork to justify restrictions on West German movement. There has been no further change in the d l ep oyment of Soviet or East German military forces in LAOS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Page 8 No discernible progress toward the formation of a government of national union has been achieved at recent tripartite talks at Namone. Soviet Ambassador Abramov visited King Savang on 18 August and pressed for accept- ande of Souvanna Pho.uma as premier, as he did in subse- quent talks with Western representatives in Vientiane. The military situation continues to be characterized b scattered small-scale skirmishes. 25X1 CONGO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Gizenga has indicated his willingness to do so but his failure to come to Leopoldville suggests that he is waiting for Adoula to meet certain demands, which may include the defense portfolio for a Gizenga follower. Although Adoula is unlikely to meet Gizenga's more extreme demands, his desire for a coalition in Leopoldville may still make him vulnerable to pressure from the Gizengists. 25X1 BIZERTE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

France, boycotting the special assembly, stands by its offer of 11 August to negotiate a "return to a more normal situation;' while Tunis stipulates that any negotia- tions must concern the substantive issue of an agreement to evacuate the base. The Soviet bloc has exploited the debate in the UN for a more general attack on the question of Western military bases, and Cuba can be expected to use the same opportunity. FRANCE-ALGERIA . Page 11 The deliberations of the National Council of the Algerian Revolution, meeting in Tripoli, are unlikely to produce radical changes in the provisional Algerian gov- ernment pending clear indications of which way Paris in- tends to move. Paris appears to have made no further decisions on Algerian policy since 11 August, when it ter- minated its unilateral cease-fire. De Gaulle has decided to move another division from Algeria to Europe to strength- en French forces there; the Berlin crisis is a key factor in restraining French Army officers who otherwise might openly move to block De Gaulle's Algerian policy. . o . . 0 . . . o . 0 0 . 0 . . . . o . Page 12 The activities of Che Guevara following the inter- American economic conference in Uruguay give further evi- dence that Cuba now is using a softer, more conciliatory line in dealing with other Latin American countries and, to a lesser extent, with the United States. Guevara's activities in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil after the conference produced considerable dissension on the Cuban question within each of the three governments. The nam- ing of President Dorticos as Havana's representative at the conference of nonaligned nations in Belgrade next month may presage a lesser role for Cuba there than was indicated in the preliminary meetings in Cairo. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Page 14 The situation in the Dominican Republic appears to be moving toward a crisis, as pressures among conflicting military and political groups endanger the position of President Balaguer and the liberalization program to which he is crammitted. Political murders of two regime opponents in the city of Santiago led to the protest closing of most business establishments in the city on 21 August. Some officers in the armed forces feel threat- ened by the new freedom allowed opposition groups;*,other military elements are sympathetic to the opposition.

Jagan has said he will seek aid and economic ex- perts from all sources. He may, however, hesitate to de- velop ties with Castro beyond present trade agreements lest he jeopardize his chances for early independence, which London may grant as early as next spring. Page 16 Ben-Gurion and his moderate socialist Mapai party suffered a setback in the Israeli general election on 15 August. Although Ben.Gurion will remain prime minister, protracted negotiations may be required to form a coali- tion cabinet, and the election results may lead to further dissidence within his party. UAR President Nasir, in reorganizing his cabinet, appears to have aimed primarily at speeding implementation of his economic and social de- crees announced last month. The Arab League has arranged to provide a mixed force to relieve the British troops in Kuwait. In Sudan, the clash on 21 August between police and religious demonstrators could have serious effects on the Abboud regime. Page 19 Ghana's involvement with the Communist world has in- creased as a result of President Nkrumah's visit to nine Sino-Soviet bloc countries and Yugoslavia. He obtained a $19,600,000 development credit from Peiping, and the USSR agreed in principle to supplement last year's $40,000,- 000 credit and to increase its purchases of Ghana's chief export, cocoa. In public statements and communiques, Nkru- mah endorsed several of Moscow's major propaganda themes and tended to associate himself more closely with Soviet policy positions.on certain East-West issues--notably disarmament. MIKOYAN'S VISIT TO JAPAN . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

FURTHER RETREAT FROM COMMUNE SYSTEM IN COMMUNIST CHINA , . Page 22 The urgent need to increase farm output appears to have resulted in a further erosion of the rural commune system in Communist China. Production groups we iorted'iy are being divided into smaller units, farmland is being allotted to individuals and groups of workers, and mess- halls are being closed in some areas. There also are in- dications of a major transfer of authority in rural areas to the smallest commune production units. 25X1 MORALE IN COMMUNIST CHINA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Page 23 the severe hardships of the past two or three years have resulted in widespread psychological depression and cyni- cism. The growing disillusionment has not taken the form of (organized -ahtir'egime activity but is characterized by petty infractions of the law, open grumbling, and indif- ference to authority. 'Theft? black marketeering, and begging--all directly attributable to the worsened eco- nomic situation--have risen sharply. The regime tolerates minor manifestations of discontent, but has quickly taken repressive steps to eradicate any overt signs of sedition. ALBANIAN-BLOC RELATIONS . . G . . . . . . . . . . . Page 24 Albania's relations with the Soviet bloc have deteri- br.atid further in recent weeks. Albanian party leader Enver Hoxha apparently did not attend the 3-5 August Warsaw Pact meeting in Moscow, and Albanian delegations have not participated in subcommittee meetings of the bloc's Council fog Mutual Economic Assistance since early July.

New measures over t4e past week involve con- trols that might be encountered at a -recogniged international frontier--including replacement of the barbed-?wi.ra. barricades along the East - West Berlin sec- tor border on 13 August with concrete barriers, the strength- ening of barbed-wire fences along the zonal border adjoin- ing West Berlin on three sides, and various types of personal checks on those desiring to cross the border. The regime has gradually reduced the number of crossing points on the sector border from the 13 announced on 12 Au- gust to 7. The Ministry of In- terior on g2 August issued a series of decrees, to go into effect the following day at 0001 hours, regulating access to East Berlin by West Germans, West Berliners, and Western military and diplomatic person- nel. The announcement stated that the new regulations--as was the case in the 12 August decrees closing the sector bor- ders--would remain in effect "until the conclusion of a peace treaty." Foreign nationals (other than West Germans), members of the diplomatic corps, and per- sonnel of the Western occupa- tion forces now may cross the sector border at only one point, Friedrichstrasse. West Germans will be permitted to cross at only two points, Borholaerstrasse and Heinrich Heine Strasse. West Berliners are restricted to four crossing points--Chaussee- strasse, Oberbaumbruecke, Sonnen Allee, 4nd Invalidenstrasse-- and, for the first time, they will be required to obtain an East German permit, at the cost of one West German mark, to en- ter East Berlin. There has been some actual interference with travel over the sector border by Western Allied personnel. On 22 August, prior to the imposition of the new restrictions, East German police detained a US military patrol--the first incident of this character involving US per- sonnel since the promulgation of the 12 August decrees, although instances of interference have occurred in East Berlin in the past. A British patrol which strayed over the zonal border was detained for three hours last week. In a test of the new re- strictions, a US military patrol crossed into East Berlin on 23 August at the Friedrichstrasse checkpoint. When it sought to return via a street not desig- nated as a checkpoint, it was turned back. It then proceeded to Elsenstrasse, where it found the road blocked. East German guards refused a request to talk with a Soviet officer, but did not prevent the patrol from leaving the area. Finally, the patrol returned to West Berlin via Sonnen Allee. In and around Berlin, se- curity and police forces are still in evidence.

Popular Attitudes In a television broadcast on 18 August, East German leader Walter Ulbricht displayed great self-assurance at having suc- cessfully completed the diffi- cult problem of sealing off West Berlin. There was, however, a note of concern about the reac- tions of the East German popula- tion. "For some time," he said, "there will continue to exist in the GDR capital and its environs people who have allowed them- selves to be influenced and de- praved by West Berlin."

Mikoyan in his public remarks in Japan predicted, that. a separate treaty would be signed by the end of the year and that access to Berlin for any state would then depend on the conclusion of "special agreements" with the East German regime. This gen- erafline was also stressed by the Czech Government, which de- clared its "irrevocable decision" to conclude a treaty before the end of the year. Khrushchev, in a "letter to American read- ers" on 21 August asserted that the bloc, has reached a firm decision not to postpone a peace conference any longer. The Soviet protest note of 23 August is consistent with 'the bloc's broad effort to demonstrate the urgency of a peace treaty before the end of the year,. The note, apparently intended as a threatening response, to Chancellor Ade- nauer"s visit to West Berlin on 22 August, charges the United States with failure to take measures to suppress "pro- vocative activities" of West German officials in West Ber- lin. The, warning of "possible consequences" of continued West German "interference," together with the demand for immediate measures to terminate "illegal and provocative" actions ih Ber- lin, suggests that Moscow may be preparing the groundwork to justify East German harassment,, of or restrictions on West Ger- man traffic to West Berlin and within Berlin. . In an effort to build a case, for continued tightening of East German controls in Berlin, the note accuses the West of "abusing their situation" in Berlin and flagrantly violat- ing four-power agreements by misusing the air corridors to transport "all kinds of re- vanchists" to Berlin. On 18 August Moscow had replied to the US protest against East German actions by reiterating its position that the East Germans have legal "sovereignty" over East Berlin and that the four-power status of the Soviet sector had long ceased to exist. At the same time, Soviet leaders have sought to minimize the prospect of an immediate crisis. The Soviet news agency Novosti transmitted the tdxt of Khrushchev's "letter," which restated the Soviet position on Berlin in a relatively mod- erate manner and is apparently intended as a,sign of reassur- ance that the bloc will not en- croach on Western access to West Berlin pending a peace treaty. He also stressed that the possibility remains of nego- tiating the terms of continued Western access to and presence in,Berlin. However, he ruled out any settlement which would reaffirm Western occupation rights in the city and candidly admitted that the question of East German control over Allied access to Berlin is primarily an issue of "political signif- icance" rather than technical procedure. Mikoyan dismissed the ques- tion of access as a "minor point" and repeatedly asserted that the USSR would accept a four-power or UN guarantee for Berlin.

According to US officials in Bonn, Chancellor Adenauer's appealfor calm, close associa- tion with the Allies, and even- tual negotiation with the USSR appears to be closely attuned to the West German public mood.' They believe that although Mayor Brandt may have gained increased sympathy and respect from West German voters as a result of the current Berlin crisis, they doubt that this means votes for Brandt's'Social Democratic. party in the 17 September elec- tipns. West German political fig-' ures, despite expressions of wrath and indignation at the sealing off of East Berlin, have generally avoided advpcat- ing strong countermeasures and have indicated a feeling of re- lief that the situation has not -gotten out of control. Ameri- can observers. feel that the real impact of the recent events may cp1e only after the elec- tibns', when some politician may try to attack the long- standing thesis of Adenauer.'s Christian Democratic Union that the best chance for ulti mate reunification lies in firm ties with the West. The US Mission in Berlin re- ports, however, that business and banking'leaders feel there have been no.disturbing devel- opments in the West Berlin economy. Consumer trade has not approached panic buying and in some respects is only an intensification of "prudent housewifely pre- caution which began several weeks ago." The mission also states .there have been no significant movements of workers or business- men from Berlin and no abnormal change-in bank deposits or trans- fer of funds indicating a loss of confidence in the city's economy.

French Reaction At a meeting on 17 August the French Defense Committee under President de Gaulle de- cided on a number of measures to strengthen French military forces in Germany and eastern France. Public announcement of the details of the measures is being held up pending their execution, but another army division, probably the 7th Light Armored Division, is expected to be transferred from Algeria to eastern France by mid-Sep- tember.. In July;the llth In- fantry Division was returned to France with indiicatione that other units would follow, France may also bring the six brigades now stationed in Germany and the air defense units along the Fr er eh--German border to full strength. The return of a second battle-tested division from Algeria would bolster signifi- cantly French capabilities in eastern France, even though these units will probably re- quire a period of large-unit training and refamiliarization with heavy weapons in order to operate at full effectiveness. De Gaulle may also find the need for additional French troops on the Continent a con- venient way of thinning out his Algerian forces and focusing army attention on its respon- sibilities outside Algeria. French opposition to the estab- lishment now of a timetable for negotiations with the Soviet Union on Berlin and Germany may stem in part from De Gaulle's interest in keeping the French Army concerned with events out- side North Africa.

The Soviet ambassador told US Ambassador Brown that of the outstanding "trouble spots" in the world, Laos was the "easiest to resolve," and solution of this problem would have an 'ef- fect on other world problems, the most pressing being that of Berlin.

The Boun ?um delegation is holding to its position that the King should' be given a number of names from which to select a premier, while the Pathet Lao persists in its demand that Souvanna Phouma be named premier. There is some indication the three sides may bypass the premiership issue temporarily in order to discuss allocation of cabinet portfolios, but no progress is.likely in this sphere until a premier has been selected. In the military subcommit- tee, the three sides have shelved the question of the ef- fective cease-fire date and have moved on to a discussion of where the cease-fire line should be drawn. The military situation continues to be characterized by sporadic and scattered small- scale clashes, with government Meo units in Xieng Khouang Province the most consistently active. The Pathet Lao and Kong Le forces have been unusual- ly restrained in their reaction to what must be, to them, high- ly troublesome Meo raids, am- bushes, and disruption of their lines of communication. This low-keyed response may possi- bly stem from a desire to avoid rocking the boat during this period of stepped-up political and diplomatic pressure to gain At Namone, talks in the political committee concerning acceptance of Souvanna aG premier.

Follow- ing his assumption of the pre- miership, Adoula had warned Moise Tshomb6 that he was pre- pared to take forcible action to reintegrate Katanga with the Congo. The negotiations with Gizenga reflect Adoula's desire to consolidate his Leo- poldville coalition before tak- ing action, against the Katanga leader. On his return from Stan- leyville, Adoula denied that formal negotiations had taken place but intimated that Gi- zenga would shortly come to Leopoldville. According to press reports from Stanleyville, Gizenga has advised diplomats there to transfer operations to Leopoldville and to seek ac- creditation from the Adoula gov- ernment. Gizenga's failure to date to take up his vice premier- ship in Leopoldville, however, suggests that he has attached conditions to his participation which Adoula has thus far failed to meet. One of Gizenga's demands may be that one of his followers receive the defense portfolio. Foreign Minister Bomboko report- edly has stated that under no circumstances would a Gizengist be permitted in the defense min- ister's post and that it would continue to be held by Adoula himself. Adoula appears unlikely to agree to Gizenga's more ex- treme demands, particularly in view of the latter's diminished personal influence on the Con- go scene. Adoula's apparent willingness to cooperate with Gizenga, however, points up the fact that the Stanley- ville faction has not been de- feated by the Leopoldville group so much as absorbed by it. The presence of a large group of former Lumumbists in the Adoula cabinet poses the threat that over a period of time the pre- mier will be pressured in the direction of a bloc-oriented neutralism such as character- ized the old Lumumba government. Gizenga's pretentions may have impressed some African gov- ernments into adopting a wait- and-see attitude toward Adoula. The status of charter air flights into Stanleuville from Cairo is unclear. Although Gi- zenga representatives had ten- tatively contracted for around 80 flights by an Air Jordan DC-6 during the forthcoming year, the recent trend toward Congo unity, together with Western pressure against unauthorized flights to the Congo, suggests that flights may not be resumed. The Jordanian Government re- portedly has instructed Air Jor- dan to return to Amman the air- craft it has used for its Stan- leyville flights. In Elisabethville, Tsbomb6 reportedly believed in mid-Au- gust that the Adoula government would shortly split, and was awaiting a favorable moment to seek a settlement with Leopold- ville. The American consul in Elisabethville observed on 20 August that Tshombd showed no sign of a willingness to dis- cuss practical measures which would demonstrate his sincer- ity concerning a reconciliation and reintegration with the Congo.

During the initial demonstration, which was in Bizerte, several hundred demonstrators scuffled for most of the night of 18-19 August with French forces at the barricade controlling one of three exits from the native section. Some of the demonstra- tors penetrated the barrier to present to the governor of Bizerte Province a formal declaration of support for Bourguiba?s policy of demanding the evacuation of French troops from the base as well as the city. French forces handled the demonstrators firmly but, in accordance with orders of base commander Admiral Amman, they refrained from shooting. Bourguiba had warned that his troops would respond with "all means at their disposal" should French forces open fire. Prior to the Bizerte demonstrations, the French strengthened their defenses within the city and commandeered the two ferries on Bizerte Canal, thereby cutting off the main route from Tunis into the city and further curtailing services and ship- ments of food into the native sector. The Third Foreign Legion Infantry Regiment--one of three reinforcing units transferred to Bizerte in July --returned to Algeria on 17 August, but it has been at least partially replaced by naval personnel. draft resolution criticizing France is expected late this week--France has refused to participate in the debate. Some Tunisian officials were inclined to moderate the extreme passages of the draft in order to gain its acceptance by Western lead- ers. Tunisia?s UN delegation nevertheless felt compelled to leave the draft alone for fear that changes would disrupt tenuous Afro-Asian solidarity. The Tunisians had also feared' that extraneous issues might be introduced into the discussion and were anxious to confine de- bate to the single issue of Bizerte, but'the debate affords Cuba and the Soviet bloc an opportunity to launch a general attack on the existence of Western military bases around the world. Both the French and Tu- nisians continue to stand by the positions taken in their notes of 11 August. France had offered to negotiate a "return to a more normal situation" at Bizerte and to acknowledge that France does not intend to hold the base "forever" but had refused'to surrender free- dom of action regarding the timing of evacuation. Tunis continues to hold that France can "normalize" the situation in Bizerte by compliance with the~Security Council's 22 July resolution--withdrawing its forces within the perimeters of the base complex.

Press correspondents recently invited by the army to tour French Army positions in Algeria along the Tunisian border reported concrete fixed fortifications being strength- ened, which suggests that the French do not expect to abandon present positions, as might be anticipated if new defenses were to be established around regroupment areas. The deliberations of the National Council of the Algerian Revolution (CNRA) meeting in Tripoli continue to be tightly held, although rumor--probably, inspired by the PAG--has it that moderates are giving way to extremists intent on "inter- nationalization" of the Algerian conflict. However, if a tougher leadership has actually been agreed on, it is unlikely to take over before the'UN General Assembly considers the issue, or before Paris :shows it .has given up hope in negotiations. The apparent PAG conviction that Paris will make concessions is strengthened by De Gaulle's announced intention to end the Algerian problem one way or another before the end of the year. PAG leaders argue that De Gaulle cannot establish an Algerian executive without their participation or approval, and they refuse to believe that he would actually undertake partition. Meanwhile, the French Army, released from the unilateral cease-fire, has considerably stepped up operations against the rebel forces. A major factor in the government's decision to permit a renewed offensive has been the impact of reports of discontent and lowered morale. Several competent military cor- respondents have analyzed the adverse situation produced by the one-sided truce for the French. Both the Figaro mili- tary expert and the American consul genera]. in Algiers have suggested that the unusually large numbers of French troops being reported "missing!' at .that time were probably Moslem deserters. Fear of large-scale desertions as signaling the beginning of the end in Algeria has long been a nightmare for French authorities. De Gaulle nevertheless appar- ently decided to risk the disap- proval of military officers deter- mined to hold the line in Algeria when he decided on 17 August to move another division from Algeria to Europe in view of the Berlin crisis. The existence of a serious Berlin crisis at this time is a major fac- tor keeping in line those officers who oppose De Gaulle's Algerian pol- icy and who would be inclined to act to forestall moves aimed at sloughing off the Algerian burden.

In two press interviews in which he seemed to minimize the danger, he nevertheless called for public vigilance. and more severe legal action in addition to police activity. The activities of Che Guevara following' the inter- American economic conference in Uruguay give further evidence that Cuba now is using a softer, more conciliatory line in deal- ing with other Latin American nations and, to a lesser extent, with the United States. This apparent shift in tactics, re- cently indicated" by Guevara's show of moderation during the conference sessions, could result from a desire, for eco- nomic or political reasons, to avert a strong hemisphere stand against the Castro, regime. Re- ports of increasing economic hardships in Cuba, including shortages of food and other necessities, are mounting, and the regime's scheduling of a "national meeting" in Havana on 26 August for a public discussion of economic problems betrays growing concern over their effect. Politically., the new tac- tics could result from Castro's fear that international Commu- ism's major objectives in the area--to create other "Socialist" regimes and to isolate the United States--would be jeop- ardized by the continuing alien- ation of other Latin American governments and worsening US- Cuban relations. Guevara's public appearances in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil, despite the moderate nature of his statements, sparked sharp dissension among key elements in each of the three governments on the Cuban question. After one person was killed in the clash of anti- and pro-Castro elements following Guevara's speech on 17 August to univer- sity students in Montevideo, Uruguay's National Council of Government split on a proposal to declare him persona non grata and finally agreed on a weaker statement condemning him for intervention in domestic polit- ical affairs. In Argentina, President Frondizi's meeting with the Argentine-born Guevara on 18 August gave rise to strong pro- tests from the military.F- April. The government has an- nounced it will continue purging the adminstration and armed services of elements who were fence-sitters during the April military mutiny.

Some of Guevara's recent statements closely paralleled those made by Castro in the course of a long conversation with Colom- bian Foreign Minister Turbay on 9 August in Havana. Tur- bay concluded from Castro's remarks that the Cuban leader may be having "deep domestic troublest' and wants to find a way`out, and that he is anxious to avoid giving the US any pretext for intervening in Cuba because he is uncertain how much Soviet aid would be forthcgm 'in g,.,. Turbay, who had been touring various Latin American countries seeking support for Colombia's plan to convoke an OAS meeting to define the conditions under which Cuba could continue or cease its membership in the inter-American system, implied that he now feels there is some hope that Cuba will be amenable to the influence, of other, Latin American govern- ments. Recent announcements by .Radio Havana,of routine ship- ments arriving in Cuba from bloc countries disclose that Communist China, despite its own food shortages, is,con- tinuing to send canned meats and rice to Cuba. Other bloc countries are also sending token amounts of foodstuffs. The naming of President Osvaldo Dorticos instead of Fidel Castro as head of the Cuban delegation to the summit conference of nonaligned nations opening in Belgrade on 1 Sep- tember may indicate that Cuba will play a more restrained, less important role there than it did in the preparatory meetings in Cairo. Cuban Foreign Minister Raul'Roa, whose extreme leftist position and bitter anti-US in- vective nearly disrupted the Cairo talks, will also go to Belgrade. He may overshadow Dorticos, who is little more than a figurehead. 25X1 All diplomatic missions in Havana except those of Sino- Soviet bloc countries have pro- tested the Castro regime's lim- itation of their official and 25X1 private funds in accordance with the provisions of the recent cur- rency reform decrees. representatives of 2'7 nations; incliid ing the UAR and Yugoslavia, agreed at a meeting on'15 August to insist on a'full exchange at par value instead of accepting Cuba's limit of 25X1 SECRET 2.4, P?^^ &amp;1 tf PWT.V Z?T~'VTPW page 13 of 25 Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927A003300060001-0  Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927AO03300060001-0 SECRET lose CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 10,000 pesos.

Hostility between elements of the armed forces and newly organized opposition groups has led to bloodshed in several towns in the interior. Santiago, the country's second largest city, was the site of the most recent killings, where on 20 August at least two oppositionists were murdered, apparently by army or police officers, or by mobs or- ganized and directed by the local authorities. Most businesses in the city were closed in pro- test on 21 August. The killings are symptomatic of the fear of many old-line of- ficers that their positions are threatened by the new political freedom under Balaguer and the accompanying expressions of hos- tility to the military on the part of opposition elements. On 22 August, a member of the National Civic Union (UCN), a moderate opposition group with extensive middle-class backing, told the US consul that at a meeting of Dominican generals and colonels on 18 August, Gen- eral Ramfis Trujillo had made them sign blank pages. Officers sympathetic to the UCN are said to suspect that the pages may be used as a petition to request a more "forceful" policy, if not the installation of a mil- itary regime. ranking PRD leader told the consul on 22 August that he had been approached by a non- commissioned officer of the navy. The man claimed to be a spokesman for a group of naval colleagues who, together with their contacts in the air force, are planning a coup. The spokesman, indicating dis- trust for the UCN, asked for PRD support.

Jagan's position will be en- hanced by the fact that the re- maining legislators--ll from the socialist Peoples's National Congress (PNC) and four from the conservative United Force-- will be divided and disorgan- ized. Jagan and about seven other PPP legislators are be- lieved ideologically committed to Communism, and most others will support Jagan out of party discipline or for personal ad- vancement. The results of the elec- tions--in which over 80 percent of the electorate voted, as com- pared with only 55 percent in 1957--demonstrate the continued organizational skill of Jaigan's wife, Janet, who is considered a more doctrinaire Communist than her husband. She is ex- pected to become president of the 13-member appointive Senate. Up to nine ministers will be appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier and, in addition to three members of the previous government, will probably include several of the young Communists recruited into party activity by Janet. Britain has retained con- trol of defense and foreign affairs except for trade agree- ments. Otherwise, Cheddi Jagan's authority-as premier will be checked only by the Senate's power to delay legislation. Aiming to be conciliatory to avert a drift into the Soviet bloc, London will be receptive to Jagan's demand for early independence within the Common- wealth, perhaps granting this as early as the spring of 1962. Membership for British Guiana in the West Indies Federation-- a development London would like to promote to blunt Jagan's in- fluence--is considered unlikely. The rough treatment Jagan received. during the election cam- paign from PNC supporters and in- adequate protection from the po- lice may lead to quiet efforts both to curb the influence of the rival parties and to make the police more an instrument of the PPP. The prospective attorney general has said that he has some "scores to settle." The PPP program calls for socializing the "commanding heights" of the economy and for a neutralist foreign policy. Jagan has stated he will seek aid and economic experts from all sources, and he will soon leave for Britain and the US seeking independence and aid. While openly professing admira- tion for Castro, from whom he is believed to have received a printing press, Jagan may hesi- tate to develop ties with Cuba at this time beyond trade agree- ments lest he jeopardize his chances for early independence. Cuba has already brought Guianese rice; a contract for timber was announced on 16 August, but the terms remain to be negotiated.

These losses probably resulted mainly from defections on the part of erstwhile Mapai supporters who disapproved of Ben-Gurion's handling of the "Lavon affair," which precipitated the election. Mapai remains the country's largest party--more than twice the size of any other in terms of electoral support--but since it lacks a parliamentary major- ity, a coalition will again have to be formed. Protracted negotiations may be required before the new Fifth Knesset votes its approval of a govern- ment. One thing is all but cer- tain: the 74-year-old Ben-Gurion will again be prime minister.

The reorganization of the UAR cabinet on 16 August appears designed primarily to speed the execution of the series of eco- nomic and social decrees an- nounced by Nasir last month. This aim, along with a trend toward government centraliza- tion in Cairo, stands out in official explanations of the change, but several questions on how the new setup will func- tion remain unanswered. Emphasis is being placed on the duties to be assumed by the seven vice presidents, who will be responsible for broad areas of the government's activities. Members of the cabinet--36 ministers and three deputies--presumably will work closely with and be responsible to the vice presidents, but their precise relationship is not yet established. Much interest centers around the real duties to be assumed by Vice President Abd al-Hamid Sarraj, formerly Nasir's security chief in Damascus and chairman of the now-dissolved Syrian Executive Council. If, as stated by Cairo radio, Sarraj is to be responsible for internal secu- rity and administrative prose- cution and control throughout the UAR, then he appears once again to have received a vote of confidence from Nasir, de- Nasir's official spokesman, Minister of State Hatim, has declared that separate executive councils for Egypt and Syria will continue to function.

These administrative changes, however, combined with the recent decrees and pronouncements of Nasir and his advisers, reflect the re gime's continuing determination to carry through its plans for shaping a "democratic, socialist, cooperative" society. The "Kuwait crisis" is over, but its legacy lingers on. The main problem is to arrange the replacement of British troops by an Arab force. An Arab League military committee which visited Kuwait from 8 to 13 August signed an agreement with the Ruler for the stationing of a 3.,000- to 3,500-man force whose expenses will be borne by the Kuwaiti Government. Sub- sequently the Ruler formally requested the withdrawal of the British troops. The nationality and compo- sition of the Arab force have not yet been settled; it appears that its commander will be either a Saudi or a Tunisian. Although a target date of 1 September has been set for the arrival of the first Arab troops, arrangements seem to be moving ,very slowly. may be able to take over from the mixed Arab force. Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim still maintains his claim to Kuwait. The Iraqi press and radio have attacked the Arab League's actions on the Kuwaiti issue, and there are rumors that the Iraqi Government intends, as a propaganda move, to publish in full the secret debate at the Cairo special meeting of the Arab League on the Kuwaiti issue. Sudanese police on 21 August fired into a crowd of religious demonstrators, killing 12 and wounding several others. The demonstrators, most of whom apparently were members of the influential Ansar religious sect, had been celebrating the an- niversary of the prophet Mohammed's birth. The incident could lead to a showdown between the military regime and opposition elements who have recently been agitating for a return to civilian govern- ment. The head of the Ansar sect, Siddiq al-Mahdi, who is also the most important figure in the opposition, has up to now been reluctant to take violent action against the regime in support of his demand for broader civilian participation in. the govern- ment. However, he may feel that this latest police action has placed him in a position where he must make a vigorous antigovernment move or lose the confidence of his followers. In the event of a showdown, Al-Mahdi could muster about 5,000 of his primitively armed Ansar tribesmen and British troops are expected to withdraw as Arab troops move in, but a British training mission is likely to remain to help in the organization of a Kuwaiti army which eventually could probably count on support from a sizable number of Ansar adherents within the Sudanese Army.

Nkrumah has been accompanied by an'unusually large entourage, including top government and party leaders and the heads of Ghana's special-interest mass organi- zations. Nkrumah's visit to China was also marked by the signa- ture of a friendship treaty, a cultural cooperation pact, and a five-year trade and payments agreement calling for trade exchanges totaling $22,400,00 annually. Sino-Ghanaian trade in 1960 amounted to only $4,345,000 and accounted for less than one percent of Gha- na's total foreign trade in that year. The tour, Nkrumah's first within the bloc, has been in progress since 10 July. It has included official stops in the USSR, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Ruamnia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Communist China. On 1 August, Nkrumah paid a brief "private" visit to East Ber- lin. At present he is vacation- ing in the Crimea prior to at- tending the conference of non- aligned nations starting in Belgrade on 1 September. So far the most dramatic development of the tour was the conclusion in Peiping on 18 August of an economic and tech- nical: cooperation agreement un- der which the Chinese extended to Ghana an interest-free credit valued at $19,600,000. This brings the total of known bloc credits extended to Ghana--all since August 1960--to nearly $110,000,000, a figure approx- imately equal to the aid being given Guinea. Prior to Nkrumah's trip, Ghana had ob- tained aid commitments from the USSR ($53,440,000), Czechoslo- vakia ($14,000,000), Poland ,: ($14,000,000)., Hungary ($7,000,- 000), azd East Germany ($1,764,- 000). A TASS announcement issued at the end of the formal visit to the USSR proclaimed Moscow's agreement in principle to step up its purchases of cocoa, Ghana's chief export, to approxi- mately 60,000 tons a year by the end of a five-year period. Known Soviet cocoa purchases from Ghana have exceeded 30,000 tons only twice, and this year will be under 10,000 tons., However, the same announcement revealed that the terms of such a deal are still under negotiation. The USSR also expressed its readiness to supplement the $40,000,000 development credit it made available to Ghana last year. Additional agreements enabling the bloc to extend its influence into new areas of the Ghanaian body politic--such as the military establishment and even the legal system-- may be emminent. The number of bloc technicians in Ghana-- already well over 200, counting the aviation specialists sent to ope.&gt;ate the IL-18 aircraft acquired by Ghana under a special credit--seems likely to rise sharply.

He endorsed Soviet disarmament proposals as "a reasonable basis for negotiations"; he also expressed "appreciation" of Soviet proposals regarding a German peace treaty and the settlement of the "West Berlin issues" on this basis. Subse- quently,,a Ghanaian diplomat indicated that Nkrumah is.pre- pared'to make a similar state- ment leaning to-the Western position on Berlin at a suit- able time. In public speeches, the Ghanian President went to new extremes in his denunciations of Western imperialism and colonialism While virtually endorsing a number of Moscow's major propaganda themes--such as its claim to be the most appropriate model for under- developed countries to emulate.

In his opening re- marks to Prime Minister Ikeda on'16 August he assailed the treaty, and repeatedly warned that if war whould break out over Berlin, Japan would be- come involved because it is "pledged to cooperate with the .United States by the security treaty." Mikoyan apparently hoped to stimulate Japanese support for a negotiated settlement of the Berlin issue by stressing that a war over Berlin "may be a nuclear war" and by emphasiz- ing the danger of nuclear anni- hilation of the Japanese if the US were to use bases in Japan for an attack on the USSR. By blaming Washington for failure to reach a negotiated Berlin settlement, Mikoyan probably SECRET 24 Aug 61 WEEKLY REVIEW Page 20 of 25 Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927A003300060001-0  Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927AO03300060001-0 SECRET CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY hoped also to offset the favor- able Japanese reaction to Ikeda's recent trip to the US. During his courtesy visit to Ikeda, Mikoyan delivered a letter from Khrushchev which attacked the presence of foreign military forces and bases in Japan as the outstanding imped- iment to friendly relations with the USSR. Mikoyan, in elaborating on the letter, claimed scientific and techno- logical superiority for the USSR and asserted that it has a far stronger military capability than the US in the Far East. He also proposed an exchange of views between Tokyo and Mos- cow on international issues and urged Japan to add its voice to t.e demand for the abolition of all nuclear weapons. Mikoyan repeated the sub- stance of these remarks in dis- cussions with other Japanese leaders and in subsequent speeches during his tour. He told Socialist party leaders that the signing of a peace treaty and the return of the Soviet-held Japanese islands of Habomai and Shikotan depended on abrogation of the US-Jap- anese security treaty. He expressed his support of a Socialist-sponsored proposal for a four-nation Far East collective security arrangement to replace the security treaty. The Japanese Government and press reacted sharply to Mikoyan's efforts to exert po- litical pressure on Japan, and protests have been widespread and unusually acrimonious. Ikeda and other government officials have accused Mikoyan of distortion, denounced his use of threats to achieve Soviet aims, and charged interference in Japanese affairs. The major dailies, in a turnabout from last year, have defended the security treaty and denounced Mikoyan, although their attitude probably reflects more a sense of national indignation than pro-American sentiment. The Soviet leader's visit appears to have dimmed any hope Moscow had for an early soft- ening of Japanese attitudes to- ward the USSR. It apparently was impossible for Mikoyan to reach agreement with Japanese officials on matters of mutual concern--trade, commercial air routes, and cultural exchanges. His endov;_.ement of increased trade between the USSR and Japan, however, is likely to have the desired effect on Jap- anese business interests. Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Kuzmin, who accompanied Mikoyan, presented Japanese officials with a Soviet "shopping list" of some $200,000,000 worth of complete plants which the USSR wants to buy from Japan outside the framework of the agreement now in force. Mikoyan's proposal to sign a 15- to 20-year trade pact was parried by the Japanese, but they agreed to discuss a long- term agreement during the annual trade negotiations in November; the current three-year trade pact expires in December 1962. A large contract for the purchase of Soviet lumber was signed, as well as one for Japan to supply six oxygen separator plants worth about $14,000,000.

Available information on organ- izational and operational changes varies in details 'but'adds up to a further retreat by the regime from centralized,control over farm production. This control has been in the process of fragmentation since late 1958. There have' been two major stages in this process. The first ended in mid-1959 when the production brigade--a smaller farm unit equivalent in size to the commune's pred- ecessor, the agricultural-pro- ducer cooperative--supplanted the commune as the basic farm unit. The second ended in late 1960 when important responsi- bilities were transferred from the brigade to the production team, the smallest unit of the original commune. The brigade at this time, however, was to remain the basic farm unit responsible for setting produc- tion targets, allocating re- sources, and distributing in- come. Reports now being received indicate that the main authority over farm production may have been transferred to the produc- tion teams. Hinting to this effect,a People's Daily edito- rial of 21 June, in reporting on a production brigade in Kiangsi whose teams exercised the main authority over sowing plans, the amount of seed to be retained, and cultivation techniques, stated that brigades should issue "preliminary" SYSTEM IN COMMUNIST CHINA instructions to their pro- duction teams. The daily even cited approvingly an instance where. teams had refused to im- plement plans assigned by the brigade. In another instance, Peiping's People's Daily on 3 July reported a division of au- thority between production teams and still smaller units of "work groups," with the latter responsible:for assigning pro- duction tasks, setting pay stand- ards,and.helping the team set work norms and decide on man- agement procedures. a more formal transfer of 25X authority may have been ordered, possibly from the highest level of the party and government. One farmer from Kwangtung said that his production brigade had transferred the "ownership" of land, farm tools, draft animals, and manpower to its production teams,and that these resources were in.turn given as "fixed loans" to an even smaller di vision, the work squads. Another report from Kwangtung states that the unit equivalent to the production team in one commune has been made the "basic economic unit" responsible for distributing income, Numerous other reports describe the reorganization of communes, brigades, and teams into smaller units during the past winter and spring, although no mention is made of any transfer of key responsibilities. Another step in the retreat from the commune system would be the closing of rural messhalls- - for which there is evidence from Kwangtung and other indications over larger areas.

Apart from the food shortages, Peiping's prob- lems are complicated by the lack of other consumer necessities. people's clothes are gray with dirt--soap is rationed at half a cake a month--and cloth is so hard to buy that the "patches are being patched," these hardships have produced a growing preoccupation with per- sonal affairs; "selfishness" has increased, and conversations among the hungry are almost ex- clusively about food. Official complaints about the need to "generate revolutionary enthu- siasm among the. masses" indicate that Peiping is aware of the situation. The new mood of disrespect for Communist virtues has also affected party members, some of whom have been rebuked in the Kwangtung provincial press for showing favoritism when re- cording their relatives' work points--on which the amount of their ration depends. Albania's growing isola- tion from the Soviet bloc over the past several months apparent- ly has been self-imposed as well as forced on it by Moscow. While'the USSR has been seeking, by various forms of pressure, to force Albania back into line, Tirana--particularly since the first week of August--has also taken steps to lessen its de- pendence on the bloc, to pro- tect itself from Soviet inter- ference, and to deprive Moscow of certain Albanian services. The regime has taken some halfhearted measures to stem abuses. Hesitant to arrest and imprison individuals caught stealing food, it has tried, at least in some cases, to hu- miliate them at public meetings. In the eyes of the public, how- ever, it is no longer shameful to steal food. The only offense which brings immediate counteraction from the authorities is one which openly challenges the regime's control or impugns the political leadership. When signs reading "Down with Mao Tse-tung" appeared in Shanghai, every effort was made to com- pare the calligraphy in the signs with that of local res- idents in an effort to track down the culprit. Food riots-- apparently few in number so far--have been quelled forcefully and quickly. The regime apparently draws a firm line beyond which it will not tolerate dissent. It now seems likely that party leader Enver Hoxha was the only East European party leader absent from the War- saw Pact meeting held in Mos- cow from 3 to 5 August. This is suggested by Albania's failure to comment on the composition of its delegation, as well as by the wording of the introduction to a state- ment purportedly delivered by the "head" of the delega- tion to the meeting and pub- lished by Tirana on 8 August. Hoxha would probably have been SECRET 24 Aug 61 WEEKLY SUMMARY Page 24 of 25 Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927A003300060001-0  Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927AO03300060001-0 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY mentioned by name if he had in fact led the group. The 8 August statement is only slightly more aggressive in tone than repent Soviet statements on the German prob- lem, but is Unusual by the mere fact of'its publication. Albania presumably is exercising the right and obligation-- implied in the December 1960 declaration of 81 Communist parties--for each party to make its own views known, in international Communist meet- ings. Normally such views, however, emerge only in the consensus made public by the meeting as a.whole. The only precedent for Albania's in- sistence.on making its individ- ual voice heard is the pub- lication by Peiping of the Chinese delegate's speech to the February 1960 pact meeting. Apparently as a result of Soviet rebuffs, Tirana has reversed its policy during the past two months of abstaining from propaganda attacks on Yugo- slavia. During this period, the Albanians--probably as a ,gesture-to Moscow, which has adopted a. favorable attitude toward the summit .conference of neutral nations to take place next,month in Belgrade--had not published any articles devoted solely to attacks on the. Yugoslavs. On 13 August, however the lead- ing regime paper published an article claiming that Yugoslavia is neither socialist nor neutral. This attack was followed on 17 August with another article de- lineating. the allegedly dele- terious effect of revisionist policies on. Yugoslavia's economy. Albania may also be boy- cotting meetings of the bloc's Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CEMA.). Albanian representatives were not noted at the four subcommittee meet- ings held in July. Although not every bloc state is repre- sented on every CEMA commission or subcommittee, it is likely that Albania's absences were more than mere coincidence. Recent reported bloc pres- sures on Albania, in addition to continued economic measures, have included calling home some Soviet and satellite citizens from Albania and the expulsion of Albanians from elsewhere in the bloc. Between April and June, the number of Soviet technicians was reduced, and most of the Czech, Hungarian, and East German technicians , reportedly were recalled from Albania.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUN WART SPECIAL ARTICLES SUMMIT CONFERENCE OF NONALIGNED NATIONS The meeting of nonaligned nations, which opens in Belgrade on 1 September, will bring to- gether leaders and observers from at least 26 nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin Amer- ica. It will be the largest such convocation since the Afro- Asian conference at Bandung in 1955. In its composition and its temper, this conference will differ radically from the larg- er Bandung meeting. Half of the nations which were at Ban- dung will attend, including the UAR, India, Burma, Lebanon, Indonesia, and Ghana (then the Gold Coast). Missing, however, will be Jordan and Liberia, as well as those Bandung partic- ipants formally aligned with the West--Thailand, the Philip- pines, Turkey, Japan, Pakistan, Iran, and South Vietnam. Also absent will be Communist China and North Vietnam which, like those tied to the West, fail to meet the criteria of nonalign- ment agreed to for this meeting. Added to the Bandung group will be Yugoslavia, some of the emer- gent nations of Africa, and several Latin American states. The Belgrade meeting will thus reflect several major changes which have occurred in the world since 1955. The Afro- Asian concept, which was un- wieldy at best, has been dis- placed in favor of a standard more directly related to the formulation of foreign policy. The choice of locale reflects the rising influence of Yugo- slavia and the enhanced stature of President Tito, who has been a moving force behind the con- ference planning. Increased interest in Latin Amer-iea - r'ef16cts a 'significant change in the way a few of its leaders regard traditional ties with the West and in the way Afro-Asians have come to regard Latin America. Perhaps most significant of all is the emergence of the Africans, many of whom make the old anti- imperialistic firebrands like Nehru, Sukarno, and even Nasir look considerably more moderate. Original Participants The Belgrade conference developed out of a round of visits this spring among Tito, Nasir, and Sukarno, with the major initiative coming from the first two. Tito and Nasir share the view--despite their repeated contrary assurances to Nehru--that, as heads of small states with little in- fluence individually, they can best advance their aim of broad- er leadership by creating some sort of bloc of nations which might express foreign policy views collectively. To this end, in May they invited 21 other states to a preparatory conference in Cairo the follow- ing month. To the sponsors, India's participation in the planning meeting was crucial, They failed to obtain Nehru's co- sponsorship, largely because the Indian leader feared such a meeting might serve to increase rather than lower world tensions. His lack of enthusiasm was also consistent with his long-estab- lished opposition to any move- ment toward the formalization of a "third force," which, he feels, would compromise the concept and effectiveness of nonalignment as a?polidy.,, Nehru was finally per- suaded to send a representative CONFIDENTIAL 24 Aug 61 gDr?rTAT_ ADTTrrT-00 Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927AO03300060001-0 ge l of 8  Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927AO03300060001-0 rlr .

The meet- ing bogged down, however, over the adoption of "criteria of nonalignment" and the question of what additional states should be brought in. The criteria were finally agreed upon through the device of making them ambiguous. They require that a nonaligned state (1) pursue an independent for- eign policy based on coexist- ence of states and on nonalign- ment, (2) consistently support movements for national independ- ence, and (3) not be a member of a multilateral military or base alliance concluded in the context of great-power conflicts. As for new invitees, the preparatory representatives agreed to add the provisional Algerian government to their number but held over for later consideration a Ghanaian pro- posal to invite Gizenga?s 'Stan- leyville regime to participate.

The three Asian envoys clashed repeatedly with the representatives of Cuba, Ghana, and Guinea, who sought greater weight for their more radical views by limiting the number of states attending. It was finally agreed that in- vitations would be issued to Lebanon, Bolivia, Ecuador, Togo, Upper Volta, Nigeria, Mexico, and Brazil, bringing to 29 the total number of invitees. Summit Meeting Prospects All 21 states which ac- tively took part in the prepar- atory meetings will be repre- sented at the Belgrade meeting, most of them by their chief of state or government. Of those newly invited, Lebanon's prime minister says he will attend, while Mexico and Upper Volta have declined. Apparently neither Nigeria, which the In- dians pressed to have invited, nor Togo now plans to attend, although Togo's President Oly;m- pio had earlier indicated other- wise. Brazil, Bolivia, and Ecuador will send observers. In addition, President Bourguiba will attend for Tunisia, which was invited separately follow- ing the,Bizerte episode. Cyprus may also attend. All those states not represented by their chief of state or government are expected to be accorded the status of observer; in such a role they may debate but not vote. At Nehru's insistence, the conference will be preceded by a meeting of foreign ministers or other representatives, who will gather in Belgrade during the week of 27 August. "His motive is to ensure that sharp differences of opinion will be 'confined to the closed lower level sessions and that the meetings of principals, which will be public, are as free as possible from long-winded harangues. Each of the leaders can be expected to use private meetings, however, to press for support on local-problems, even if these problems are not tak- en up in the formal sessions. One of the first questions the foreign ministers will take up is that of Congolese partic- ipation. The question of expand- ed participation as well as pro- cedural matters will also be raised. Strong disagreements on such questions as reorganization and support of the UN are also expected. The conference's draft agen- da, nevertheless, contains many generalizations, including "con- solidation and strengthening of world peace and security ...the liquidation of imperialism and neo-imperialism,..noninterfer- ence in the internal affairs of states, racial discrimination, comprehensive and general dis- armament, and a ban on nuclear tests"--matters on-which there is already a large measure of agreement among the nonaligned leaders. Their deliberations on these subjects will reflect the views they will espouse in this fall's UN General Assembly ses- sion. Howevery on questions in dispute between East and West, such as disarmament and nuclear testing, the conferees will be more concerned with urging East- West reconciliation than with sorting out the substance of the conflicting positions. CONFIDENTIAL aEeRfrf 24 Aug 61 SPECIAL ARTICLES Page 3 of 8 Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927AO03300060001-0  Approved For Release 2007/10/23: CIA-RDP79-00927AO03300060001-0 CONFIDENTiAt There are strong indications that Tito plans to .raise the Ber- lin and German questions, al-' though ma by of s the ~ participants Would prefer to. avoid... these issues. Tito, a supporter of the concept of two Germanys, can be expected to be more sympathetic to the views of the USSR than to those of the West. Nehru--who hopes to play a mediating role on the Berlin questibn.,during his visits to Washington and Moscow shortly. after the Belgrade sessions --will oppose any sub- stantive commitment on the sub- ject. The leaders of the main camps '.in the iionWiigned world are lining up support for their views-. At Mali's insistence,' the Casablanca Powers (the UAR, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Morocco, and the provisional Algerian government) will meet in Cairo on 27 August. Nehru has in- vited the leaders of Ceylon, Burma, and Nepal to stop in New Delhi on their way to Bel}- grade. For Tito, the conference will be the culmination of a long drive to have his creden- t is is accepted by the nonaligned nations. He has endeavored to guarantee the maximum amount of publicity for the conference and to ensurq, that the -delegates are impressed with Yugoslavia's efficiency and achievements. Nasir cannot fail to gain in prestige by his co-sponsorship of the conference, but he has already created bad feelings by his equivocal role during the preparatory sessions, Each of the other leaders, however, has a personal stake in the confer- ence's success. No one can af- ford a failure. Cuba, which will be represented by Pres- ident Dorticos rather than by Fidel Castro, has already ali- enated Nasir as well as`other moderates. 24 Aug 61 Bloc Attitudes Although publicly on rec- ord in favor of the conference, the Chinese Communists have reservations., They are concerned that it marks a departure from the pattern set at Bandung in 1955 of Chinese participation in major Afro-Asian gatherings and thereby sets a precedent for China's exclusion in the future. Peiping would have pre- ferred another Bandung-type meet- ing and is still encouraging Sukarno to call one. The Soviet Union was orig- inally cool to the idea of non- aligned summitry. Accepting the inevitability of the meeting, it has sought in recent weeks en- dorsement from the nonaligned states for the general Soviet positions on such issues as dis- armament, anti-imperialism, Germany, and Berlin. This de- sire to influence the conference apparently accounted for Moscow's revival of the long-dormant plan for an exchange of visits by the Yugoslav and Soviet foreign min- isters. When Yugoslav Foreign Minister Popovic was in the USSR in early July, Khrushchev pro- fessed keen inter9pt in the com- ing meeting and said he had nothing against it. The Soviet-Ghanaian com- muniqud issued on 26 July fol- lowing'Nkrumah's visit to Mos- cow expressed the USSR's hope that the Belgrade meeting would "contribute to the maintenance of peace, the solution of the problems of disarmament, and the elimination of colonialism." These gestures have been fol- lowed up by lengthy letters to a numbor..of the Belgrade summit participants outlining the Soviet Union's views on the Berlin question in the expectation that that subject will be raised at the meeting.
