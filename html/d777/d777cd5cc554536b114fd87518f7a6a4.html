 bers of the New England delegation at
 our meeting Wednesday and the willing-
 ness of all these members to participate
 in efforts to restore the original tariff
 level.  I think that the excellent pres-
 entations of factual data on the eco-
 nomic impact of increased foreign com-
 petition made by representatives of labor
 and industry were adequate to direct our
 immediate attentioi~ to the restoration
 of the original tariff base.
 I consider it an honor to have been ap-
 pointed as chairman of the committees
 established by the meeting to expedite
 favorable consideration of my bill, and
 other bills on this subject, and to take
 other steps discussed at the meeting.
 The courses of action outlined at our
 meeting offer a number of possibilities
 with great potential and we should pur-
 sue each of them without delay.  The
 committees established at this meeting
 will arrange to meet with officials of the
 Treasury Department to investigate the
 reason for the tariff reduction and to
 present data on the impact of foreign
 competition on domestic employment,
 and all other necessary and desirable
 steps will be taken.
 I am confident that these measures,
 in conjunction with our continuing ef-
 forts to obtain hearings on H.R. 12983
 in the Ways and Means Committee, will
 prove productive, and I am especially
 pleased with the progress which was
 made at Tuesday's meeting.

 This meeting has served to emphasize
 the true nature of the Customs Bureau's
 new guidelines, and to point out their
 lack of legal justification. Although the
 Bureau would seek to minimize the effect
 of the recent tariff cut by labeling it a
 revised method of evaluation, I have been
 informed by the Customs Bureau itself
 that the implementation of its revised
 valuation methods will result in an $8.8
 million loss of revenue on the 60.8 mil-
 lion pairs of footwear already involved.
 Congress has prescribed the proper and
 legal mechanism for such tariff conces-
 sions in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
 The provisions of this act require the
 Tariff Commission to investigate the
 probable economic impact and effect on
 domestic employment before such tariff
 reductions may be granted.  Moreover,
 the letter and spirit of the Trade Ex-
 pansion Act direct that such concessions
 be reciprocal.  The Customs Bureau's
 new guidelines actually reduce the tariff
 on rubber-soled footwear by at least 35
 percent without any investigations or
 report on the economic impact on do-
 mestic industry and employment, and
 without obtaining any reciprocal con-
 cessions from our trading partners.
 The effect of this action is to present
 our domestic rubber footwear industry
 and its employees with the burden of
 this gratuitous tariff cut as our U.S. ne-
 gotiators prepare for negotiations in the
 Kennedy round at Geneva which may
 further reduce this already-eroded tariff.
 In fact, the domestic industry has been
 exposed to the added risk that the Amer-
 ican selling price system of valuations
 itself may be negotiated at Geneva.
 Obviously we are up against serious
 odds in this battle and the high stakes
 involved make our concerted construc-
 tive efforts all the more necessary. With
 this in mind it was very encouraging
 for me to note the large turnout of mem-
 LET'S GIVE A SECOND CHANCE TO
 REHABILITATED VETERANS
 (Mr. McVICKER (at the request of
 Mr. MATSUNAGA) was granted permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in
 the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. McVICKER.  Mr. Speaker, I have
 introduced a bill to alleviate a situation
 that has too long gone unheeded. I re-
 fer to the more than 500,000 Americans
 holding a less than honorable military
 discharge. This hangs over their heads,
 irregardless of the fact that many of
 them have sought to lead exemplary lives
 since leaving the military service of the
 United States.
 One young man has two honorable dis-
 charges in addition to an undesirable.
 He is ineligible for reenlistment or change
 of discharge in order to obtain decent
 employment.
 Another young man has an unsuitabil-
 ity discharge which has been changed to
 honorable, but under a service regulation
 which still renders him "unsuitable."
 As a result he can only do menial work,
 although he is quite young and seems to
 have exceptional intelligence.
 Yet another is married with three
 children.  He comes from a deprived
 background, and cannot get work be-
 cause of his dishonorable discharge.
 My bill would allow, under proper evi-
 dence, awarding of a rehabilitation cer-
 tificate to certain of these citizens who
 qualify under its terms. By amending
 title 10 of the United States Code, it
 would aid those veterans who could ade-
 quately prove rehabilitated conduct for
 at least a 3-year period.
 Certificates would be issued by the Do-
 partment of Labor, with the Secretary of
 Labor authorized to establish boards to
 receive and act upon applications for
 them. Evidence submitted to the boards
 would include statements signed by law
 enforcement officials, persons acquainted
 with the applicant, and his employer, if
 any.  Boards could then conduct inde-
 dependent investigations.
 Those individuals receiving the certifi-
 cate would then be eligible for job
 counseling and employment placement,
 as these benefits are denied to them
 under existing law, thereby working se-
 vere hardships upon many of them.
 Mr. Speaker, I feel many of these vet-
 erans deserve this opportunity to ease
 their lotT and that my bill, once passed,

 PATI CE,  PERSEVERANCE,  AND
 PE  PECTIVE  CALLED  FOR  IN
 VI  NAM
 (  r STRATTON (at the request of
 Mr.  ATSUNAGA) was granted permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in
 the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. STRATTON.  Mr. Speaker, when
 this country undertook to declare its
 independence in 1776 we had problems.
 There were ups and there were downs
 before we were fully free and operating
 as a fully democratic society. We even
 had to fight a long and bloody civil war
 before the principle was finally accepted
 that one region of our country could not
 just go off and set itself up on its own
 and thumb its nose at the established
 authority of the country just because
 they did not happen to like it.
 But with patience and perseverance
 we  prevailed,  Mr.  Speaker.  Neither
 Rome nor the United States of America
 was built in a single day.  We need just
 a little perspective when we see the
 things that are happening today in Viet-
 nam.  Let us not panic.                                                                                            Let us take
 the long view.  The birth of a nation,
 like the birth of an individual, can take
 time and is often painful.  But our
 forces are doing well in Vietnam.  Let us
 not throw away the achievements and
 the sacrifices they have made just be-
 cause the news from Da Nang and Hue
 and Saigon may be disturbing at the
 moment.
 In that connection I commend to the
 attention of my colleagues an admirable
 editorial that appeared in the Washing-
 ton Post for May 25:
 LESSONS Or ADVERSITY
 The crisis in South Vietnam is producing
 a great deal of reflection in this country, not
 only about the United States role there, but
 about the American role elsewhere in the
 world where like situations may arise.  Pain-
 ful as this reflection may be, it is necessary,
 useful and constructive as a means of devel-
 oping policy in a democratically governed
 society.  Instruction  based  on  theoretical
 example is never as well remembered as that
 derived from actual experience.   The experi-
 ence we are living through now is a teacher
 we cannot despise.
 The critics of American presence in South
 Vietnam make some accusations that are not
 easily answered.  They say South Vietnam
 is a very small country, and this cannot be
 denied.  They say it is a very weak country,

 and. this can hardly be disputed.  They say
 it is it very divided country, and no one can
 ga.nsa;y it while Buddhists are attacking the
 troop:, of their own government and those of
 fl t allies, while Catholics and Buddhists stage
 demonstration,  and counterdemonstrations.
 'riaey arty that it never has had and does not
 now have familiarity with democratic insti-
 tuions and that is true.  They say that
 ::~o itla Vietnam lies in an area of Chinese
 Communist influence and in close proximity
 to Communist power and this cannot be
 contradicted.
 Ti is: only at grave risk that a great power
 assists a small, weak and divided country
 to resist aggression.  The lesson seems plain.
 tf.sreaiter let United States assistance be re-
 served for victims of foreign aggression only
 when  hey are large, powerful, united, dem-
 ocratic and far away from any Communist
 power.  Such assistance will not involve us
 of the great risks that are involved in help-
 ing the small, the weak, the divided and the
 vulnerable.  The great and powerful nations
 we assist will make good use of our aid.
 'i'hey will not fritter it away.  They will not
 waste  their strength and ours in internal
 bickering  and  quarreling.  Their  efficient,
 Ircaccfui and capable utilization of oar aid
 will be a source of continual satisfaction and
 cxpnndoig power.  Thus we shall make our
 large irieuds invulnerable, ourselves secure
 and  r,krtain  peace in our time.   Once the
 world  has   grasped our policy, Communist
 bast ion:;  will  attack  only small countries.
 In;asmoch as we will defend only large ones,
 there will be no more East-West conflict.
 or course, there will cone a time when all
 the small. weak and divided countries have
 been reiloced     by aggression.  But any war
 chart follows that development is hound to
 be cozily close at hand.  In order to fight it,
 we will not have to run the risks of trans-
 porting troops great distances.  Our soldiers
 will nut have to give battle in strange sur-
 roundings or in a disagreeable climate.  They
 will not be exposed to the temptations of
 alien brothels but can revel in the luxury of
 home-grown sexual immorality.
 aucti are the lessons of adversity to be
 polled from the difficulties encountered in
 South Vietnam.
 JCPSEPTI ALSOP SAYS WE ARE WIN-
 NING IN VIETNAM
 Mr. STRATTON (at the request of
 M1'. MATSUNAGA)  was (granted permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in
 the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. STRATTON.  Mr. Speaker, last
 inontfl when the subcommittee which I
 had the honor to head, returned from an
 iimpection trip to Vietnam, we reported
 to this House, as the RECORD for April 27,
 that we found the military situation go-
 in?r muc11 better in. Vietnam than most
 people back here had been led to believe.
 We said we believed our forces were win-
 ding Ore military war in Vietnam.
 I (horn- tunately, Mr. Speaker, not much
 of the national press paid much atten-
 tion to that story.  Somehow the press
 seems to favor those accounts which
 reflect unfavorably on our commitment
 lit Vietnam and play down those ac-
 ce mounts that favor it.
 '.i'he report of the gentleman from Cal-
 ifm,nisi, [Mr. Moss], for example, which
 was highly critical of our foreign aid
 dealings in Vietnam got banner head-
 lifies in Washington and around  the
 country.
 Yet the statement of the Governor of
 Pennsylvania, a former Member of this
 body, in Vietnam. on a visit, saying he
 felt our military operations there are
 going well got almost no coverage here.
 Tliat is unfortunate, Mi.. Speaker. It
 gives the people of the country a mis-
 leading and distorted view of the actual
 situation in Vietnam.
 I do hope that perhaps the unhappy
 experience of scone 90 American and
 foreign press representatives in Da Nang
 the other day, which wa  reported in
 the Washington Star on Tuesday, by Mr.
 Richard Critchfield, as an experience in
 which "the scales had fallen from the
 eyes of some 40 American and foreign
 newsmen" as regards the real motives
 of the antigovernment Buddhist demon-
 strators in Vietnam, may perhaps mean
 that we can look for more accurate and
 less consistently biased reporting and
 photography in the future
 In any case, Mr. Speake:u, I was de-
 lighted to see that the optimistic view
 which our subcommittee reported to this
 House a, month ago is now supported by
 no less distinguished a reporter than Mr.
 Joseph Alsop, who has just returned from
 Vietnam and whose report appears in the
 current? June 4, issue of the Saturday
 Evening Post.  I am sure Members will
 End his analysis of considerable interest.
 I am, therefore, including t at this point
 in the RECORD:
 WHY WE CAT: WIN IN  /IETNAM
 (By Joseph Also))
 In Vie.triam, great; numbers of Americans
 are now committed to a, war which very few
 rnur'icans even begin to understand.  Most
 of us, of course, have a fair understanding of
 the issues our troops are fighti rig for, but only
 a tin_ minority understand the war itself.
 This has struck Inc with increasing force
 after every one of r:ay more recents visits to
 Victn.aln---and I have been  Isere 16 times
 since 1953.  People talk about, other matters
 such as the chops and chang^ s of politics in
 Saigon, where the Communists might mail-
 tige     eventual vici;ory -although I do not
 t lints they will.  No one ever mentions tile
 f ;rl,? desperate combat, prol;loms that now
 face the Viet Cone;.  No one analyzes the
 present strategy of our brill srnt field com-
 ir;anrier in Vietnam, Gen. Wiliam C. West-
 moreland.                                                                                No one refers in coy way to what
 is currently happening on  rlae battlefield.
 Yet the battlefield is where our own best hope
 of victory lies.
 `Lira whole pattern of the lighting, as it
 happens, is still determined by an almost
 successful gamble that the Communist made
 to win the war last year.  Ilence we must
 backtrack a bit at the outset in order to see
 the 1.. wing, the nature and fire risks of this
 enormous Viet Cong gamble, to make what
 happened reasonably compr,;hensible.
 Many normally w,_ll-inforn.ed persons still
 believe that a Communist guerrilla move-
 lent like the Viet Con[; is something spon-
 taneous--halfway, lot us say, between a mis-
 guided patriotic society and a nationwide
 game of cops-and-robbers.  from their first
 Obscure guerrilla origins, however, the Viet
 Cong have been  a second government of
 South Vietnam, and they still are.  Futher-
 more---and here is the import rut point-this
 clandestine Communist second government
 has all the fiscal, economic, manpower and
 other problems that plague any normal gov-
 ernment.  Since this is also a government at
 war, the V.C. second government's biggest
 probicm is naturally to recr.nt, equip and
 in.aina;a.in its armed forces.  'his has always
 been the biggest problem, an,[ its difficulties
 caused the Viet Cosrrg gambl,- already men-
 tioned, which was decided on in late 1963
 after the coup d'etat against; South Viet-
 namese President Ngo Dinh Diem.
 South Vietnam in the summer of 1963 was
 a country in which every province had its
 own civil war, with the Saigon government
 controlling the provincial capitals and a good
 many villages, with the V.C. second govern-
 suent controlling a good many other villages,
 and with troops of both side :s in the field
 everywhere.  By that time, there was i Viet
 Cong provincial battalion of a..bout 504) men
 operating in each of Vietnam's 43 provinces.
 There was a Viet Cong distri,'t company of
 about 150 men operating in each of cat least
 2,50 of the administrative distrcts into which
 the provinces are subdivided.  And in each
 of several thousand V.C.-controlled vtllagcs
 and hamlets, there was a Viet Cong guerrilla
 band of 20 or 30 men to maintain loc; l dis-
 cipline and to harass friends of the estab-
 lished government in neigirhoring villages
 and hamlets.  All these V.C- soldiers---about
 50,000 in the local forces and 110,000 in the
 guerrilla hands, or approximately 16(1,1)0) men
 in all-had to be paid and armed and. kept
 supplied with ammunition soil much other

 In addition, this second government; was

 of military public works.  The rule books for
 guerrilla war, written by Mao Tse-tung and
 his remarkable Vietnamese Communist pupil,
 Gen. Vo Nguyen Clap, lay dov ii an ah;;olute
 requirement for guerrilla main bases in areas
 immune to penetration by licstile troops.

 Early in  1963, moreover,      the first main
 forces-their nature will be explained in a

 No. 87-18
 projected a continuous growth of the enemy
 main forces in South Vietnam at the rate
 of two regiments per month until the end
 of 196G.  In other words, the main forces,
 which had a strength equivalent to 10 divi-
 sions when the President committed U.S.
 troops, were projected to grow to a strength
 equivalent to about 18 divisions before next
 New Year's Day.
 This projection by Gen. Westmoreland's
 staff was presented to Secretary of Defense
 McNamara when he visited Saigon at the end
 of November.  It of course implied a need
 for a good many more American troops to
 match  the  enemy's  expected  increase  of
 strength.  For this reason the new estimates
 caused a panic in Washington when Secre-

 North, and other manifestations that pre-

 slumping faith in their basic theory of Amer-

 whether the panic was justified.  I think it
 was wholly unjustified.
