 A.  SHANGHAI MAYOR ANNOUNCES HIGH-TECH PARK
 EXPANSION PLANS AT PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION
 CONFERENCE  (CHINA DAILY - CD, 20 & 27 OCT).  OVER 100
 REPRESENTATIVES FROM 16 COUNTRIES ATTENDED THIS
 CONFERENCE, HELD IN SHANGHAI, //GEOCOORDS:
 3114N/1212$E// ON DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
 (S&T) INDUSTRIAL ZONES.  MAYOR ((HUANG)) JU ANNOUNCED
 PLANS TO BUILD AN $ SQUARE KILOMETER (KM) BEICAI
 ZHANGJIANG HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ZONE (DZ) IN
 THE CITY'S NEW PUDONG AREA.  THE MAYOR CLAIMED THE DZ,
 WHICH WOULD SPECIALIZE IN MODERN TNFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
 AND NEW MATERIALS, WOULD BE MODELLED ON SHANGHAI'S
 EXISTING CAOHEJING HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIAL DZ.  THE CITY
 ALSO HAS PLANS TO EXPAND CAOHEJTNG, LOCATED SOUTHWEST OF
 THE CITY CENTER, FROM ITS CURRENT 1.7 KM SQUARE AREA TO
 5 KMS-SQUARE DURING THE $TH FIVE YEAR PLAN (FYP).
 CAOHEJING WAS SET UP IN 19$5 AND ACHIEVED A TOTAL OUTPUT
 VALUE OF USD 400 MILLION IN 1990.  IT HAS A GOAL OF
 ACHIEVING OUTPUT OF OVER USD 2 BILLTON BY THE YEAR 2000.
 1$ FOREIGN-OWNED ENTERPRISES IN THE ZONE REACHED 103.57
 MILLION YUAN IN OUTPUT DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 1991;
 WITH PROFITS REACHING 30.9 MILLION YUAN.  THIS IS AN
 INCREASE OF 330 PERCENT IN PROFITS OVER THE FIRST 6
 MONTHS OF 1990.
 B.  STATE S&T COMMISSION (SSTC) "TORCH PROGRAM
 OFFICE" REPORTS RAFID FROGRESS IN RECENTLY ESTABLISHED
 HIGH-TECH DZ'S  (CD, 22 AND 23 OCT).  THE SSTC OFFICE
 CLAIMS THE BEIJING'S "3-LEGGED POLICY" OF ESTABLISHING
 FIVE SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES (SEZ), 14 COASTAL ECONOMIC
 AND TECHNOLOGICAL DZ'S, AND 27 STATE-LEVEL HIGH-TECH
 INDUSTRIAL DZ'S, IS HAVING THE DESIRED AFFECT OF
 PROMOTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  THE BEIJING HIGH-TECH
 DZ HAS ACHIEVED A 40 PERCENT ANNUAL GROWTH IN TOTAL
 OUTPUT STNCE IT WAS FOUNDED IN 19$$.  THE EIGHT HIGH-
 TECH INDUSTRIAL DZ'S IN EAST CHINA ACHIEVED AN OVERALL
 TOTAL OUTFUT VALUE OF OVER 20 BILLION YUAN IN 1990.
 SSTC HAS DETECTED SOME PROBLEMS IN ZONE DEVELOPMENT DUE

 TO LACK OF INVESTMENT FUNDS, SHORTAGES OF TALENTED S&T
 FERSONNEL, AND EXCESSIVE RED TAPE.  HOWEVER, THE ZONES
 HAVE ENCOURAGED FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND INCREASED HIGH-
 TECH EXPORTS WHILE IMPROVING GENERAL ECONOMIC
 EFFICIENCY.  (NOTE -- SEE ALSO 1-15 OCT 91 DSTI REPORT.)
 C.  SHENYANG DONGBEI MICROELECTRONICS RESEARCH
 INSTITUTE (RI) SETS UP LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT
 (LSIC) TEST BASE  (NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY - NCNA, 26
 OCT).  THE RI SET OF THIS FILOT RESEARCH AND DEVELOFMENT
 (R&D) CENTER TO DEVELOP A PRODUCTION LINE FOR 2.5 MICRON
 CHIPS; AND TO CONDUCT EXTENSIVE R&D IN 1.5 MICRON
 LSIC'S.  THE 44.5 MILLION YUAN FROJECT POSSESSES CHINA'S
 MOST ADVANCED FACILITIES, INCLUDING HIGH-PURITY WATER
 AND SUPERFURE AERODYNAMIC STATIONS.  THE BASE PASSED
 STATE-LEVEL TECHNICAL EVALUATION TESTS ON 26 SEP AND
 WENT INTO FULL OPERATION.
 A.  CHINA'S ECONOMIC EXPERTS NOT SATTSFIED WITH
 REFORM MEASURES ENACTED AT HIGH-LEVEL COMMUNIST PARTY
 MEETING  (CD, 16, 17, 21, 26 & 28 OCT; SOUTH CHINA
 MORNING POST - SCMP, 22 OCT).  RESEARCHERS FROM THE
 CHINESE ACADEMY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES NAVE SUGGESTED THAT
 THE 12 REFORM MEASURES ADOPTED BY PARTY LEADERS IN SEP
 WILL NOT RESCUE CHINA'S FAILING STATE-RUN ENTERPRISES
 UNLESS THEY ARE ALLOWED MANAGEMENT AUTONOMY, OPEN TO THE
 OUTSIDE WORLD, AND CARRY OUT VIGOROUS TECHNICAL
 TRANSFORMATION.  THEY HAVE CRITICISED CURRENT ENTERPRISE
 MANAGERS FOR CONTINUING TO MEASURE SUCCESS OF THEIR
 FACTORIES BASED ON TOTAL PRODUCTION OUTPUT RATHER THAN
 ON EFFICIENCY AND PROFITABILITY.  THEY NOTE THAT
 INDUSTRIAL LEADERS HAVE PROUDLY POINTED TO ROBllST
 PRODUCTION GROWTH IN THE 3RD QUARTER 1991 AS AN
 INDICATOR THAT CHINA IS RECOVERING FROM THE AUSTERITY
 PROGRAM BEGUN IN 1988.  FRODUCTION GROWTH DID INCREASE
 13.4 PERCENT IN JUL, 14.6 PERCENT IN AUG, AND 14.9
 PERCENT IN SEP; HOWEVER, UNSOLD INVENTORIES INCREASED 17
 PERCENT DURING THE PERIOD AND WERE VALUED AT 133 BILLION
 YUAN BY THE END OF JUL.  THE STATE COUNCIL DESIGNATED
 1991 AS THE "YEAR OF EFFICIENCY, QUALITY, AND VARIETY";
 YET, THE YEAR IS ALMOST OVER AND ENTERPRISE MANAGERS ARE
 STILL STRESSING HIGH PRODUCTION AND IGNORING THE NEED
 FOR ECONOMIC  EFFICIENCY.  THE 36 PERCENT OF STATE-RUN
 FACTORIES LOSING MONEY, AND THE 33 PERCENT ONLY BREAKING
 EVEN WILL NOT RECOVER UNTIL THEIR MANAGERS BEGIN
 EMPHASTZING QUALITY OVER QUANTITY.  PARTY LEADER
 ((JIANG)) ZEMIN ALSO POINTED TO THE NEED FOR STATE-RUN
 INDUSTRY TO ACCELERATE MANAGEMENT REFORM AND SEEK
 FOREIGN TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE WHILE CONDUCTING AN
 INSPECTION OF GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES IN ZHEJIANG
 PROVINCE.  THE STATE PLANNING COMMISSION (SPC) HAS
 Approved For Release 2000/08/10: CIA-RDP96-007928000200480001-3
 UNCLASSIFIED
 Approved For Release 2000/08/10: CIA-RDP96-007928000200480001-3
 INITIATED SEVERAL STEPS TO COME TO GRIP WITH THE GROWING
 NUMBER OF LOSS-MAKING STATE ENTERPRISES.  IT HAS ASKED
 PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS TO SELECT A MINIMUM OF 12
 INEFFICIENT ENTERPRISES TO BE CLOSED DOWN OR ALMAGAMATED
 WITH EFFICIENT UNITS DURING 1991.  THE LOSS-MAKING FIRMS
 WILL NOT BE DECLARED BANKRUPT AND WORKERS WILL BE
 GUARANTEED 10 PERCENT OF THEIR WAGES UNTIL NEW WORK IS
 FOUND FOR THEM.  THE SPC IS ALSO ENCOURAGING THE
 FORMATION OF ADDITIONAL ENTERPRISE "CONGLOMERATES" TO
 ABSORB LESS-EFFICIENT FACTORIES.  CHINA ALREADY HA5 55
 OF THESE LARGE INDUSTRIAL GROUPS, AND THE SPC WOULD LIKE
 TO INCREASE THAT NUMBER TO OVER 100 IN THE NEXT FEW
 YEARS.  (NOTE -- SEE ALSO 1-15 OCT 91 DSTI REPORT.)
 B.  DIRECTOR OF CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE (CAS)
 CALLS ON RE5EARCH ORGANS TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG SCIENTISTS
 AND LEARN FROM WEST  (S&T DAILY - STD, 16 OCT; CD 18
 OCT; SCMP, 25 OCT).  PROFESSOR ((ZHOU)) GUANGZHAO,
 SPEAKING AT CEREMONIES AT THE CHINESE UNIVERSITY OF HONG
 KONG, URGED CHINA'S MORE THAN 5,000 RI'S TO ENCOURAGE
 YOUNG SCIENTISTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO CHINA'S S&T
 ADVANCEMENT.  ZHOU POINTED TO THE NEED FOR THESE
 INTELLECTUALS TO BE PROVIDED WITH ADEQUATE WORK, STUDY,
 AND LIVING CONDITIONS; AND FOR THEIR TALENTS TO BE
 DEVELOPED THROUGH A COMPETITIVE SYSTEM.  THE CAS
 DIRECTOR IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE
 THESE RI'S WITH MORE FREEDOM AND FUNDING TO ENCOURAGE
 THEM TO SEEK GREATER TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE
 WEST.  (NOTE -- SEE AL50 16-30 SEP 91 DSTI REPORT.)
 C.  HENAN AND SHAAN%I PROVINCES HIGHLIGHT EFFORTS OF
 THEIR DSTI SECTORS TO PRODUCE CIVILIAN GOODS  (ZHENGZHOU
 RADIO, 20 OCT, PEOPLE'S DAILY - PD, 23 AND 30 OCT).
 SHAANXI PROVINCE LEADERS CLAIM THAT LOCAL DEFENSE
 FACTORIES ARE NOW ABLE TO PRODUCE OVER 600 DIFFERENT
 CIVILIAN COMMODITIES, INCLUDING THE Y-7 AIRCRAFT.  THE
 PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL PRODUCTION DEDICATED TO CIVILIAN
 GOODS HAS RISEN FROM 31 PERCENT IN 1985 TO 73.8 PERCENT
 IN 1990.  THE PROVINCE HAS SET THE GOAL OF RAISING THAT
 PERCENTAGE TO 80 BY THE END OF THE 8TH FYP.  HENAN
 PROVINCE NOTED THAT, DURING THE 1TH FYP, ITS DSTI SECTOR
 HAD INVESTED 200 MILLION YUAN IN CONVERTING MORE THAN 30
 MILITARY PRODUCTION LINE5 TO CIVILIAN PRODUCTS.
 COMMISSION ON SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND INDUSTRY FOR
 NATIONAL DEFENSE (COSTTND) ALSO REPORTED THAT, DURING
 THE 7TH FYP,-THE ENTIRE DSTI SECTOR HAD CARRIED OUT
 1,195 MILITARY-TO-CIVILIAN PRODUCTION LINE CONVERSIONS,
 ADDING 2.1 BILLION YUAN TO THE INDUSTRY'S TOTAL ANNUAL
 OUTPUT VALUE.
 D.  BEIJING HOSTS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
 COOPERATION IN PEACEFUL USE OF MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL
 TECHNOLOGY  (STD, 23 OCT; LIBERATION ARMY DAILY -LAD,

 UNCLASSIFIED
 Approved For Release 2000/08/10: CIA-RDP96-007928000200480001-3
 23 AND 28 OCT).  THE 4-DAY CONFERENCE WAS SPONSORED BY
 THE UN CENTER FOR S&T DEVELOPMENT AND COSTIND FROM 22 TO
 25 OCT.  COSTTND VICE MINISTER, MAJOR GENERAL ((HUAI))
 GUOMO (SIC - 2O37J094$J2875), TOLD THE MORE THAN I00
 INTERNATIONAL AND CHINESE DELEGATES THAT CHINA HAD
 INVESTED OVER 3 BILLION YUAN DURING THE 7TH FYP PERIOD
 CONVERTING 299 MILITARY COMPLEXES INTO PRODUCERS OF
 CIVILIAN GOODS.  DURING I990, 65 PERCENT OF DSTI SECTOR
 PRODUCTION WAS IN CIVILIAN PRODUCTS.  COSTIND HAS
 ENCOUNTERED SOME PROBLEMS IN MAKING FURTHER CONVERSIONS
 TO CIVILIAN PRODUCTION DUE TO CHINA'S INFLEXIBLE
 ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, SHORTAGES OF FUNDS, AND INEFFICIENT
 ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT.  CHINA WA5 ANXIOUS TO COOPERATE
 WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO PRODUCE CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT,
 SATELLITES, NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS, MARITIME VESSELS,
 AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS.
 E.  CAS SCIENTISTS PREPARE REPORT PROJECTING CHINA'S
 LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT, ENTITLED "SURVIVAL AND
 DEVELOPMENT"  (CD, 25 OCT).  THE 213-PAGE REPORT QUOTES
 CAS PRESIDENT, ZHOU GUANGZHAO, AS DESCRIBING CHINA IN A
 CRUCIAL STAGE IN ITS HISTORY.  CHINA'S CONTINUING HIGH
 POPULATION GROWTH HAS CREATED RESOURCE SHORTAGES AND A
 DETERIORATING ECOLOGY.  THE COUNTRY HAS FEW CHOICES IN
 ITS MAJOR POLICY DECISIONS ANA THERE IS LITTLE ROOM FOR
 ERROR.  CHINA MUST CONTINUE WITH ITS ARDUOUS STRUGGLE
 TOWARDS MODERNIZATION AND ECONOMIC REFORM WITH MORE
 EMPHASIS ON S&T AND THE ENVIRONMENT.
 F.  COMMUNIST PARTY PROPAGANDA OFFICE DIRECTS MEDIA
 TO PROMOTE S&T ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CURB LEFTIST
 INDOCTRINATION  (CHINA NEWS SERVICE - CNS, 29 OCT).
 PARTY SECRETARY JIANG ZEMIN AND OTHER KEY REFORM-
 ORIENTED LEADERS HAVE DIRECTED RADIO, TV, NEWSPAPERS,
 AND MAGAZINES TO DEVOTE MORE SPACE TO PROMOTING CHINA'S
 EFFORTS AT S&T DEVELOPMENT, WHILE PLAYING DOWN ARTICLES
 ON CLASS STRUGGLE AND POLITICAL RECTITUDE.  RECENTLY, PD
 EDITOR ((GAO)) DI DIRECTED WRITERS TO GIVE HEAVY
 COVERAGE TO THE SUCCESS OF CHINA'S FIRE BRIGADES IN
 PUTTING OUT OIL WELL FIRES IN KUWAIT, STRESSING THE FIRE
 FIGHTERS' USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES IN PUTTING OUT
 THESE FIERCE FIRES.  THE MEDIA FREQUENTLY REFERS TO
 PATRIARCH ((DENG)) XIAOPING'S DESCRIPTION OF S&T A5
 CHINA'S "PREMIER PRODUCTION FORCE" IN THESE 5&T
 ARTICLES.
 A.  STATE-RUN FACTORY NUMBER 3$8 AND NUMBER 704 RI

 COMMENTS:  1.  (SOURCE COMMENTS)  PROMINENT CHINESE
 ECONOMISTS HAVE BEEN OPENLY CRITICAL OF THE 12 REFORM
 MEASURES ENACTED DURING THE RECENT COMMUNIST PARTY
 MEETING TO DECIDE HOW TO REINVIGORATE CHINA'S LOSS-
 MAKING STATE ENTERPRISES (SEE FARA 3A QF SUBJECT
 REPORT).  RESEARCHERS FROM THE CHINESE ACADEMY OF SOCIAL
 SCIENCES HAVE WARNED THAT THE REFORM MEASURES, WHICH
 PRIMARILY INVOLVE RENEWED CALLS FOR STATE-RUN
 ENTERPRISES TO RENOVATE THEIR PRODUCTION LINES AND
 PRODUCT MIX AND IMPROVE THEIR MANAGEMENT, WILL HAVE NO
 PRACTICAL EFFECT IF THESE ENTERPRISES ARE NOT GIVEN
 MANAGEMENT AUTONOMY AND ENCOURAGED TO IMPORT FOREIGN
 PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND REFORM THEIR MANAGEMENT.  THE
 ECONOMISTS ARE MOST CONCERNED BECAUSE THE PARTY
 CONTINUES TO MEASURE ENTERPRISE SUCCESS BASED ON
 PRODUCTION OUTPUT RATHER THAN PROFITS EARNED AND TAXES
 PAID.  BECAUSE STATE INDUSTRIES ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE
 TO PRODUCE HUGE QUANTITIES OF OBSOLETE UNWANTED GOODS,
 THE CAMPAIGN TO MAKE 199I THE "YEAR OF EFFICIENCY,
 QUALITY, AND VARIETY" HAS FAILED COMPLETELY.  INDUSTRY
 LEADERS HAVE NOT PRESSED FOR IMPROVED QUALITY PRODUCTS
 OR A REVITALIZED PRODUCT MIX; IN FACT THEY HAVE
 CONTINUED TO BRAG ABOUT RECENT GROWTH IN TOTAL OUTPUT
 VALUE WHILE NATIONAL STOCKPILES HAVE ALSO CONTINUED TO

 2.  THE STRATEGIC MISSILE FORCE SEEMS TO HAVE DEVELOPED
 A MEASURE OF SENSITIVITY ABOUT THE LEVEL OF POLLUTION
 ITS MISSILE AND NUCLEAR WARHEAD SITES MAY BE CAUSING TO
 THEIR IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENTS.  THE SECOND ARTILLERY HAS
 REFORTED DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
 VEHICLE WHICH CAN QUICKLY DETECT AND EVALUATE POLLUTION
 CAUSED IN THE STORAGE AND EMPLOYMENT OF STRATEGIC
 MISSILES AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS (PARR 11B).  THE 1-15 OCT
 91 DSTI REPORT CONTAINS AN ITEM (PARA 11F) ON THE
 DEVELOPMENT OF A PURIFIER TO BE ATTACHED TO LIQUID
 PROPELLANT TANKERS ADDING FUEL TO STRATEGIC ROCKETS
 STORED IN MISSILE SILOS.  THE PURIFIER WAS DEVELOPED TO
 INCREASE SAFETY TO CREWS INVOLVED IN SERVICING THE
 MISSILES AND TO REDUCE POLLUTION AROUND THE SITES.
 USUALLY SUCH DEVELOPMENTS ARE INSFIRED BY SERIOUS
 ACCIDENTS AT THE SITES LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF
 LIFE OR PERSONNEL INJURIES.  HOWEVER, NO SUCH ACCIDENTS
 HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN RECENT YEARS.
 3.  AN STD COMMENTARY ON NAVAL MODERNTZATION HAS
 INTIMATED THAT THE PLA NAVY WILL UNDERGO A
 REORGANIZATION TO "SHORTEN THE BATTLE LINE" (PARR 11E).
 THIS IMPLIES THAT THE SIZE OF THE FORCE WILL BE REDUCED
 TO FACILITATE MODERNIZATION OF THE REMAINING COMPONENTS.
 THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS THAT THE
 PLA WILL UNDERGO A 600,000 TO 750,000 MAN CUT FROM ITS
 CURRENT 3.2 MILLION STRENGTH TO RELEASE ADDITIONAL FUNDS
 FOR FORCE MODERNIZATION.  SINCE THE NAVY'S STRENGTH IS
 ALREADY LESS THAN 500,000, THE CUTS IN PERSONNEL CANNOT
 BE GREAT; HOWEVER, THE NAVY COULD AFFORD TO GIVE UP A
 LARGE NUMBER OF ITS OBSOLETE "BROWN WATER" ELEMENTS SUCH
 AS PATROL BOATS AND CONVENTIONAL SUBMARINES.  THE NAVY
 HAS ALWAYS PLAYED A VANGUARD ROLE IN WEAPONS AND
 EQUIPMENT MODERNIZATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN
 ITS POSITION BY MOST EFFICIENT USE OF THE FUNDS AND
 RESOURCES ALLOCATED TO IT.
