 After marking time for nearly five years, Communist China again is expanding its
 presence in Africa. Since October 1970, five African governments have established diplo-
 matic relations with Peking. When the two others now in the process do so, the Chinese
 Communists will be ahead of the rival Chinese Nationalist regime in the contest for
 recognition. When the UN General Assembly voted to admit the People's Republic of China
 to the world body, Peking received most of the African ballots. Along with these diplomatic
 gains, there has been a considerable increase in Chinese economic aid to African nations.
 Transforming such short-range political profit into long-term influence will depend en
 a number of factors: the effectiveness and continued generosity of Peking's economic aid,
 the ability of the Chinese to allay African fears of subversion, conditions and events within
 Africa, and Peking's ability to find issues on which China and the African regimes can unite.
 China undoubtedly will continue to give priority to its relationships with the US, the USSR,
 Japan, and Europe, but in Peking's effort to alter power relationships in the world, Africa
 has a definite, if limited, part to play.
 The Early Years
 Africa first attracted the attention of the
 Chinese Communists in the mid-1950s, when the
 European powers came under increasing pressure
 to grant independence to their colonies. Taking
 advantage of the surge in African nationalist senti-
 mEnt, Peking stressed its opposition to imperial-
 ism, offering moral and, on occasion, material
 support to African national liberation move-
 ments. In May 1956, Egypt's President Nasir,
 sensing a potential source of support in his devel-
 oping dispute with Britain and France over the
 status of the Suez Canal, became the first ruler on
 the African continent to recognize Mao's regime.
 Peking's aid to the nationalist rebels in Algeria
 paid off in 1962 when the newly independent
 government established diplomatic relations with
 China.
 Peking's efforts to assert itself as a revolu-
 tionary model for African independence move-
 ments and to forge diplomatic, economic, and
 political ties with the more radical of the newly
 independent African states set the stage for
 increased competition with the USSR, and, as
 Sine-Soviet differences widened during the 1960s,
 rivalry for influence in Africa increased. Peking's
 Special Report
 attempt to preserve its ideological purity and out-
 bid Moscow in revolutionary appeal, however,
 soon adversely affected Chinese diplomacy. Once
 in power, most African nationalists, who wel-
 comed Chinese political and material aid during
 their struggle for independence, gave a chilly
 response to the Chinese cries for continued social
 revolution that Peking felt compelled to sound as
 part of its contest with Moscow for ideological
 leadership of the Communist movement.
 Nevertheless, as an increasing number of
 African colonies gained independence during the
 early 1960s, China stepped up its efforts to gain
 influence, mainly to match Soviet moves. The
 Chinese were also trying to counter the rival over-
 tures of the Nationalist regime on Taiwan and
 reduce US influence on the continent. As Chinese
 diplomatic missions on the continent grew in
 number, a modest foreign aid program was in-
 augurated to woo African governments and
 enha ice Peking's prestige. High-ranking Chinese
 !eadrrs, such as Premier Chou En-lai and Foreign
 Minister Chen I, made personal tours in Africa.
 African delegations were encouraged to visit Pe-
 king, and promising African revolutionaries were
 cultivated and occasionally given training in

 Chin?, By 1965, 15 African countries had diplo-
 matic relations with Communist China.
 Starting in 1965, China's steady, if modest,
 progress in Africa began to slow down. African
 leaders resented Chinese efforts to use them as
 political weapons in the widening quarrel between
 Peking and Moscow. A major reason for the can-
 cellation of the Afro-Asian conference planned
 for Algiers in 1965 was the desire of many Afri-
 can leaders to avoid association with any Chinese
 effort to turn the meeting against the USSR.
 Peking's doctrinaire support of revolutionary
 action cast suspicion on its motives. In some
 cases, such as their backing of the radical Lu-
 mumba and Mulele uprisings in the Congo (now
 Zaire), the Chinese appear to have overestimated
 the revolutionary  nntential  of  +hn  ci+,i-+t,,.,
 s. t-iose    inese ties with
 such national leaders as Ghana's Nkrumah meant
 that when those leaders were ousted, Chinese
 influence suffered.
 Peking also discovered that diplomatic ties,
 modest Chinese economic aid, and ideological
 rhetoric were no match for the iarger amounts of
 economic and military as,istance available to Afri-
 can governments from Moscow and the West. In
 Algeria, for example, Peking was unable to com-
 pete with the large Soviet military and economic
 aid commitment. Nor was the prospect of Chinese
 political support on international issues attractive
 enough to win over more African regimes. Peking
 lacked the superpower status and political punch
 of the US or USSR.
 African uneasiness over Peking's policies in-
 creased with the unfolding of the Cultural Revo-
 lution. The Chinese at that time appeared almost
 completely ;ogrossed with domestic concerns and
 presented in image of internal instability. All of
 China's ambas~adois, with the exception of the
 one in Cairo, were called home. In only one
 instance,  however, was there a break in
 diplomatic relations between an African nation
 and Peking during the most tumultuous stage of
 the Cultural Revolution. In 1967, after Tunisian
 complaints about Chinese propaganda activities
 and Chinese accusations that Tunsia wished to
 wreck relations, R. king closed its embassy. Peking
 was otherwise generally able to isolate its basic
 interests in Africa from the effects of the up-
 heaval, 'although Chinese prestige and influence
 undoubtedly suffered. The major effect of the
 Cultural Revolution in Africa was to curtail the
 extension of new Chinese economic aid and to
 put a moratorium on further expansion of Pe-
 king's diplomatic relations. After  Mauritania
 recognized Communist China in July 1965, no
 other African government entered into diplomatic
 relations with Peking for over five years.
 In 1969, the restoration of order at home
 and the adoption of a more pragmatic and flexi-
 ble approach to foreign policy laid the ground-
 work for a renewal of China's campaign to
 increase its presence and influence in Africa.
 Chinese ambassadors began returning to their
 posts. Peking's economic effort on the continent
 was given new impetus; in 1970, China extended
 $452.8 million in new economic aid to African
 regimes, far exceeding its previous aid to Atrica.
 The commitment to finance and build the Tan-
 zania-Zambia railway accounted for most of this
 total ($401.2 million), but Guinea ($10 million)
 and Sudan ($41.6 million) were given a slice of
 the pie. Continuing its version of dollar diplo-
 macy into 1971, China extended new economic
 aid to Somalia ($i09 million), Ethiopia ($84 mil-
 lion), Sudan ($40 n, illion), Algeria ($40 million)
 and Mauritania ($20.5 million). In Mali, Peking
 indicated its interest in financing and constructing
 the $100 million Manantal!i dam project.
 A New Approach to Revolution
 Since 1969, Peking's answer to the problem
 of differences between the demands of its African
 policy conducted in a world of nation states and
 the demands of its revolutionary ideology has
 been to downplay the ideological factor and to
 operate on a more pragmatic basis. In effect, the
 goal of social revolution has been retained but put
 off into the indefinite future. Chinese policy now
 emphasizes the cultivation of good state-to-state

 relations with any government willing to recog-
 nize Mao's regime as the sole legitimate govern-
 ment of  China. No ideological strings are
 attached, and Peking does not demand that other
 governments support its position vis-a-vis the
 USSR. Communist China's leadership apparently
 accepts the fact that non-Communist, nationalist
 regimes are in power throughout Africa and are
 likely to remain indefinitely. Naturally, the Chi-
 nese are pleased when an African regime adopts a
 radical position, as in Guinea or Congo (Brazza-
 ville). Nevertheless, while publicly applauding
 such measures as the nationalization of various
 sectors of the African economy, Peking has
 demonstrated considerable private caution. Chi-
 nese officials have warned various African regimes
 of the dangers of going too far, too fast in
 remaking their economies. Chinese spokesmen
 also have reminded African leaders hungry for
 economy; aid that China's capacity to help them
 is limited, implying that they should not cut
 themselves off from other sources of assistance.
 China's adoption of a flexible, nragmatic
 policy emphasizing good state relations has pzid
 off in wider acceptarce of Mao's regime by Afri-
 can states. In turn, diplomatic recognition by
 African governments helps buttress the interna-
 tional legitimacy of the Peking government and
 undermine that of its rival on Taiwan. African
 regimes are encouraged to believe that they can
 do business with Peking without fear of Chinese-
 sponsored subversion. In the long run, the Chi-
 nese obviously hope that increased international
 prestige and acceptance will be translated into
 support for Peking's moves directed at altering its
 power relationships with the US and the Soviet
 Union.
 Peking loses no opportunity to establish the
 image of China as a champion of third-world-
 hence, African-interests against those of the two
 superpowers. Chinese propaganda hits hard on the
 theme that Washington and Moscow are "con-
 tending and colluding  in order to divide the
 world between them, that Soviet and US eco-
 nomic and military aid are given with ulterior
 motives, and that Afro-Asian (and Latin Ameri-
 can) countries should "get united" to oppose the
 Special Report
 25X1
 schemes of the two superpowers to block the
 attainment of complete political and economic
 independence. Peking, which repeatedly pledges
 never to behave as a superpower, looks for con-
 crete issues of importance to Africans on which
 China can take the lead. For example, China
 supports African anti-colonial moves in the UN,
 approved the Security Council decision to hold a
 session on African problems in Addis Ababa, and
 keeps up a drumf ire of criticism against the white
 governments in Rhodesia and South Africa.  IT*
 possible, Peking attempts to select issues that
 involve; the interests of as wide a range of third-
 world countries as possible. Thus, Chinese sup-
 port of the claim of several African countries to a
 200-nautical-mile limit for territorial waters, a
 matter of even greater concern to most South
 American states, was included in the communique
 of July 1971 summarizing the visit of a govern-
 ment delegation from Sierra Leone. Later the
 same month, the communique marking the end of
 the visit of the Algerian foreign minister called for
 a "Mediterranean for the Mediterranean states,"
 obliquely criticizing the presence of both the US
 and Soviet fleets ii .he area.
 Current Chinese pronouncements stress the
 African states' struggle to protect their sover-
 eignty and interests in the face of "imperialism,
 neo-colonialism, and  racism." Peking is fully
 aware of the damage done to its position in Africa
 by its past association with subversive move-

 Ideological and organizational splits have
 undermin^d the political and military impact of
 the various liberation movements, particularly
 those in Rhodesia, and Peking probably discounts
 their ability to overthrow colonial or white rule in
 the foreseeable future. After seeing their aid to
 various African revolutionaries frittered away in
 the early and mid-1960s, the Chinese apparently
 have decided to give only relatively modest
 amounts of aid to such groups, at least until these

 Chinese influence among the African libera-
 tion movements faces several limiting factors.
 the movement

 ea ers are loath to jeopardize. The thought of
 Mao Tse-tung may inspire some African leaders
 intellectually and emotionally and interest them
 as a general guide to military and political action
 in a "people's war," but none of these leaders is
 an out-and-out Maoist, and all are ardent national-
 ists. None of them appears susceptible to firm
 Chinese control, even if Peking should attempt to
 exert it. Finally, Chinese efforts to influence the
 liberation movements are restricted by the atti-
 tudes of the African states that play host to the
 rebels.
 25X1
 25X1
 Given these limitations, which are aggravated
 by China's remoteness from the scene of action,
 the Chinese are contenting themselves with being
 more of an inspirational force to the movements.
 Chinese propaganda stresses the necessity for each
 movement to be self-reliant, to build a base of
 local popular support, and to adopt its tactics to
 the local social and political environment.
 The Chinese have no qualms about 'educing
 or even abandoning their propaganda or material
 support of an African liberation novement, if
 such an action helps cement good relations with
 an African government. Peking ceased propa-
 gandizing for the Eritrean Liberation Front sev-
 eral months before China began recognition talks
 with Ethiopia, and, since the establishment of
 diplomatic relations, Peking has severely cut back
 and probably ended support for the Eritrean
 rebels. Suspension of aid, never very great in
 absolute terms, was one of the main conditions
 set by Ethiopia as the price of recognition, and

 African state. I
 Peking's decision to accept the necessity of
 dealing with the existing African nationalist
 regimes is paralleled by a decision to write off as a
 potential source of support the few existing-and
 in almost every case illegal-African Communist
 parties. Most of the parties have general'v been
 ineffectual and have lined up behind Moscow in
 the Sino-Soviet ideological split, making it easier
 for the Chinese to write them off as revisionists.
 Peking's utter indifference to African Communist
 parties is illustrated by its reacticn to the fate of
 the Sudanese Communists. China did not join the
 Soviet and East European chorus protesting Presi-
 dent Numayri's violent suppression of the Sudan-
 ese part.
 Peking has nearly doubled its economic assistance
 to his regime and has signed a military protocol
 with Khartoum. Chinese national interest in gain-
 ing influence at the expense of the USSR in a
 major African state clearly overrode ideological
 considerations.
 If Peking has written off the existing Com-
 munist parties, there is still the question of why
 the Chinese have made no great effort to en-
 courage the formation of pro-Peking Communist
 movements in Africa. One deterrent to such a
 move is the bias toward "European Communism"
 in the African movement. Particularly in French-
 speaking Africa, most of the recruits to Com-
 munist or other ultraradical views have undergone
 ideological conversion under European influence.
 During the colonial era, the embryonic African
 Communist parties were in a sense an extension
 overseas of the Communist movements in the
 metropole. An equally strong factor is Peking's
 view of the prospects of African Communism.
 The Chinese very likely do not regard the situa-
 tion as ripe for the launching of African Com-
 munist parties, which in their view cannot be
 organized from outside but must evolve according
 to the circumstances in each state. Rather than
 engage in futile efforts to encourage chimerical
 Communist movements, Peking has chosen to
 support selected radical African leaders or nation-
 alist movements and to await developments more
 favorable to the organization of pro-Chinese par-
 ties.
 Since the renewed expansion of Chinese
 activity in Africa in 1970, most of China's new
 economic aid has gone to regimes that already
 have recognized the People's Republic. In part,
 this generosity is meant to impress African leaders
 who do not recognize China with the tangible
 benefits to be gained by good relations. Ethiopi 5X1
 and Equatorial Guinea concluded economic ai
 agreements with China within a year after recog-
 .nizing Peking, F-                    I
 Peking
 uses its foreign aid as more than just a lure for
 recognition. Provision of aid helps project an
 image of a dynamic, expanding, and modern
 Chinese economy that will serve both as an in-
 spiration and source of help for underdeveloped
 nations.
 The Chinese are well-suited by experience
 and the level of their technology to build basic
 projects-roads, railroads, dams, ports, light in-
 dustry, and agricultural and medical facilities-so
 badly needed by many African nations. The tech-
 nologically more sophisticated Western donors
 often will not match Peking's financial terms,
 which include mainly no interest credits with
 repayment  over a  long term following a

 substantial grace period. Chinese aid has been well
 received by most of its African recipients. The
 Chinese have a reputation for hard work, fru-
 gality, and living within the local economy. The
 scarcity of African complaints about Chinese
 ideological proselytizing In connection with the
 aid programs suggests that Peking is treading with
 circumspection. Moreover, the Chinese are willing
 to undertake economically dubious projects if
 they believe that the political gains will justify the
 burden. A case in point is the decision to finance
 and build the Tanzania-Zambia railway at a cost
 of $400 million. In addition to its direct utility,
 the railway is a showcase demonstration of the
 Chinese ability to handle a large-scale project
 under the difficult conditions of the African
 interior.
 China's economic competition with the West
 or the USSR is limited by its own economic
 deficiencies. In Africa, Chinese economic aid has
 surpassed that given by the Soviet Union in only
 seven countries. The immense cost of the Tanzam
 railway has enabled Peking to outdistance Mos-
 cow in Tanzania and Zambia. China is the largest
 Communist aid donor to Congo (Brazzaville), and
 a $109-million aid package negotiated with the
 Somali Republic makes the Chinese the major
 source of aid there next to Italy. Peking also has
 topped the Soviet aid level in Sudan and Mau-
 ritania. Half of the small loan given to the Central
 African Republic in 1964 remains unused. Bangui
 broke diplomatic relations with Peking early in
 1965. On the other hand, China's total economic
 effort in Africa through 1971 ($1,146 million)
 pales in comparison with the USSR's $2,519.5
 million in grants or loans during the same period.
 Most African states also retain important eco-
 nomic ties with their former colonial rulers; there
 is still considerable French economic interest in
 west and central Africa, and the United Kingdom
 is an important trade partner for its former Afri-
 can possessions, including Tanzania and Zambia.
 Chinese aid activities, particularly in Ethiopia and
 Somalia, have succeeded in arousing Soviet
 apprehension. Moscow's representatives have
 attempted to blacken Peking's new pragmatic

 image by recalling past Chinese association with
 subversion and, on occasion, by meeting the
 Chinese in head-on competition, as in Somalia,
 where the recent Soviet agreement to finance a
 large agricultural development project obviously
 is meant to offset increased Chinese economic
 aid.
 Moscow's competition probably will not
 deter an increasing number of African regimes
 from seeking Chinese economic assistance in the
 future. Almost all African regimes profess to fol-
 low a nonaligned foreign policy, and acceptance
 of Chinese aid helps reinforce this image. Al-
 though there probably are few African leaders
 who have any illusions about China's ability to
 replace the West or the USSR as an economic
 patron, Peking's assistance is welcome, not only
 in its own right but also as a device to counter-
 balance any Western or Soviet presence, and as a
 bargaining tool with which to negotiate elsewhere
 for more aid on better terms. The Malian regime,
 for example, appears to be trying to play off
 China, France, and the USSR in an effort25X1
 secure greater economic aid.

 Prospectus
 Locked in a competition with the US and
 the USSR in the changing world power balance,
 Peking is likely to continue to take advan+age of
 Africa's und..rcaaveloped economies and endemic
 political instability to expand its influence and
 secure African political support. How well the
 Chinese do will depend on a number of factors.
 Fifteen years of expanding involvement in Africa
 have given  Peking certain intangible assets-
 experience in the area, contacts with several
 important African leaders, such as Nyerere and
 Kaunda, and a greater understanding of the
 region's complex social and political structure.
 These assets have not always been well used-
 witness the setbacks dealt the Chinese during the
 mid-.1960s-hut Peking's increasing experience in
 Africa suggests that its policies and activities there
 are likely to become more sophisticated in the
 years ahead. The turn toward a pragmatic policy
 after 1969 has paid off in an expanding Chinese
 presence, yet Peking, by backing selected national
 liberation groups, has managed to retain its revo-
 lutionary aura.
 Transforming these assets into long-term
 political gains is a more uncertain process. The
 Chinese must continue to make good on their
 promises of economic aid and to show African
 !eaders that China's support is valuable in attain-
 ing their sometimes corr peting national objec-
 tives. A major factor shaping the future of China
 in Africa is, of course, the unpredictability of
 events on the continent itself. The fall of
 Nkrumah, which wiped out the political gains
 Peking had made in Ghana, and the failure last
 year of the attempted coup in the Sudan, which
 opened up a new opportunity for expanding
 Chinese influence, are cases in point.
 So far, China's ability to influence develop-
 mer`;s in Africa has been very limited. No African
 regime or liberation movement appears about to
 adopt the Maoist model of society in toto, and,
 given the intensity of the African desire for
 independence, it is unlikely that any African
 regime will allow itself to become completely
 dependent on Peking. African leaders are more
 likely to become increasingly skilful in balancing
 the competing pressures from the West, the
 USSR, and China.
 But as long as Peking supports important
 African objectives, avoids a repetition of med-
 dling in subversive activities within black aLSX1
 Arab African nations, and offers cheap economic
 and military aid, it probably wi!l continue to
 make modest gains.
