Cyprus President Clerides and - 
Vice President Denktash 
CYPRUS 
25X1 
The fighting on Cyprus wound down this 
week following a cease-fire?declared on August 
16?after Turkish forces had succeeded in gaining 
control of the northern third of the island. Ef-
forts to reopen the Geneva peace talks have 
proved fruitless so far, but Greek and Turkish 
Cypriot leaders have agreed to talks on human-
itarian issues that could be expanded to cover 
political topics. The Karamanlis government in 
Athens has refused to negotiate unless Turkish 
forces return to the positions they held on August 
9?before the second round of fifthting. Mean-
while, Turkish military successes have set off a 
wave of anti-Americanism in Greece and Cyprus, 
where it is believed that the US could have 
blocked the Turkish action. US Ambassador 
Davies was killed during a demonstration at the 
US embassy in Nicosia on August 19. 
status of Negotiations 
The scheduled meeting between President 
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktash is the first sign of diplomatic progress 
after a week of stalemate. The two leaders have 
agreed to discuss urgent humanitarian issues?such 
as the massive refugee problem?arising from the 
Cyprus conflict. Clerides has said that he will not 
negotiate on the broader political issues until the 
matter of returning refugees to their homes is 
resolved, but any indicaton of flexibility on the 
part of the Turks could give the Greek Cypriot 
leader the room he needs to broaden the talks. 
It is generally considered by diplomatic 
observers that any breakthough will have to come 
as a result of negotiations between the two 
Cypriot communities. Athens has rejected all sug-
gestions that peace talks resume between Greece 
and Turkey, saying it cannot talk in the face of a 
"fait accompli." The Greeks could probably 
accept any reasonable settlement made by 
Clerides, but to make major concessions in direct 
talks with the Turks would be. politically unac-
ceptable for the Karamanlis government.

For their part, the Turks seem prepared to 
wait out the Greeks for as long as necessary. 
Turkish military moves south of the so-called 
"Attila Line"?which delimits the northern third 
of the island claimed for a Turkish Cypriot 
autonomous area?were probably designed, at 
least in part, to for-re the Greeks to the con-
ference table. The failure of this gambit has led 
the Turks to take initial steps toward establishing 
an autonomous Turkish administration in north-
ern Cyprus. The Turks have indicz.; id a willing-
ness to negotiate on the area of Turkish control 
west of Morphou and to make minor adjustments 
in the "Attila Line" elsewhere, but the longer 
talks are delayed, the more difficult it will be for 
the Turks to consider moving out of areas 
presently under their control. 
Greek Reaction 
The Karamanlis government has remained 
firm in its intention to withdraw from military 
participation in NATO, although it has not yet 
taken any steps to make the withdrawal official. 
According to NATO Acting Secretary General 
Pansa, the Greek Defense Ministry has instructed 
its representative on the NATO military com-
mittee that a 15-day withdrawal notice for Greek 
military personnel will become operative on the 
date Athens actually issues the recall order. 
NATO authorities are somewhat encouraged by 
the fact that Greek officers so far have only 
received readiness orders, indicating that Athens 
may be having second thoughts. 
The future status of US military forces in 
Greece is even more unclear. There have been 
hints that the Karamanlis government will order 
US forces to leave the country, but government 
spokesmen continue to deny that such a decision 
has been made. Restrictions have, however, been 
placed on US access to certain facilities, and 
limitations have been placed on US military 
flights into and out of Athens. 
The announcement of military withdrawal 
from NATO, which was extremely popular in 
Greece, has strengthened Prime Minister Kara-
manlis' hand for the time being. He has further 
25X1 
consolidated his control by reshuffling the top 
echelons of the army and installing military 
leaders he trusts in the top positions. On August 
19, Karamanlis ousted the armed forces chief, 
General Bonanos, and the army chief, General 
Galatsanos, as well as several other senior military 
officers identified with the previous regime. 
General Arbouzis, who commanded the Greek 
army contingent in Korea, was called out of 
retirement to replace Bonanos, and General 
Davos, former commander of the army corps on 
the Greek-Turkish border and a critic of the last 
junta, was named army chief. Former Greek 
strong mdn General loannidis was not included in 
the purge, but there is speculation that he will be 
forced to retire by being passed over in the next 
round of military promotions. 
Anti-US Sentiment 
Turkish military successes on Cyprus have 
sparked an upsurge in anti-American sentiment in 
both Greece and Cyprus. Demonstrations have 
now been banned in both countries, but not 
before US Ambassador Davies' life was taken in 
an attack on the US embassy in Nicosia and 
serious threats were made against the security of 
the US base on the Greek island of Crete. 
The attack in Nicosia was apparently 
planned?possibly by the right-wing EOKA-B ter-
rorist group?and there are indications that one 
purpose of the violent demonstration was to kill 
Ambassador Davies. While marine guards and 
local security forces confronted demonstrators 
who set a fire within the compound, a machine 
gun located in a building 'across from the embassy 
raked the ambassador's office. The ambassdor and 
a secretary were killed in a corridor outside the 
ambassador's office where they had sought 
refuge. 
Soviet Political Reaction 
The Soviets are trying to square their in-
terest in a unified and independent Cyprus free of 
NATO links with their desire to avoid alienating 
Turkey. As a result, they have not committed 
themselves to meaningful support for any of the 
contending parties.

Demonstrators hurl objects at embassy building 
Moscow has not openly criticized Ankara 
because it does not want to risk damaging its 
longer term interests in Turkey: unhindered 
passage through the straits, weakening of Tur-
key's ties with NATO, and a decline of US in-
fluence there. The Soviets have told the Turks 
that they have three basic interests in the final 
settlement for Cyprus: 
? no US military bases to be allowed on 
the island; 
? no partition of Cyprus; 
? continued Cypriot independence, what-
ever the form of government. 
The imprecision of the third stipulation 
appears designed to appeal to Ankara. Some form 
of federation and a continued Turkish military 
presence are not ruled out. In addition, Moscow's 
public support for Makarios, whose return is 
unacceptable to the Turks, has diminished con-
siderably during the last few weeks. 
The Soviets have been chary about courting 
the new regime in Athens. Rumors of Soviet-
Greek military cooperation notwithstanding, Mos-
cow has failed to give the Greeks any significant 
support. The Soviets are, nevertheless, still 
intrigued by the turn of events in Greece. They 
have applauded Athens' decision to pull its troops 
out of NATO, and over the longer term will 
encourage its drift away from the US. 
Moscow has been frustrated by its exclusion 
from all significant diplomatic efforts to solve the 
crisis. The Soviets hive attempted?without 
notable success--to get more involved through the 
UN. Soviet press articles continue to demand a 
greater role for the UN and to say that NATO hod 
failed to settle the Cyprus problem because of 
"ulterior motives." Soviet criticism of NATO wifl

probably increase as the attempts to reconvene 
the Geneva peace talks proceed. 
Still, the Soviets can take heart from some 
favorable developments, such as the fall of 
Greek military junta and the withdrawal of 
Greece from NATO, which have been achieved at 
no cost to them. 
Military Situation 
After a four-day Turkish advance across 
Cyprus, both Greek and Turkish forces on the 
island agreed to a cease-fire on August 16. The 
Turks, however, continued their advance until 
August 18 and took an area of high ground near 
the Nicosia-Larnaca road, which they had 
declared as an "ancillary objective." Since then, 
the cease-fire has held with a few minor excep-
tions. 
The major Turkish objective of seizing the 
northern third of Cyprus?along a line running 
generally from Lefka through Nicosia to 
Famagusta?was achieved shortly before the 
cease-fire was implemented. The Turks' advance 
had been expected to stop when it reached the 
southernmost of the two major roads between 
Nicosia and Famagusta on August 16, but their 
forces continued toward the besieged Turkish 
Cypriot enclave at Melousha. By August 18, the 
Turks had captured the village of Pyroi, thus 
gaining control of the important Nicosia-Larnaca 
road. The southward advance finally stopped at 
the village of Troulli just west of the British base 
.at Dhekelia. 
Prior to the cease-fire, the heaviest fighting 
on Cyprus was north of the Nicosia airport, where 
Turkish troops attempted to overrun the camp of 
a 950-man regular Greek army contingent. The 
Greeks repulsed the numerous attacks despite 
heavy Turkish air and artillery strikes. Since the 
cease-fire, there have been no reports of attacks 
on the Greek camp. 
On the mainland, the US defense attache in 
Ankara reported that a convoy of at least 500 
military vehicles moved southwest from Adapa-
zari toward Bursa on August 19. Some of the 
25X1 
trucks carried troops in battle dress, and others 
weie towing artillery pieces and transporting sup-
plies. The destination and purpose of the convoy 
has not been determined. 25X1

ARAB STATES - ISRAEL: GROPING THEIR WAY 
Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam's visit to 
Washington this week underscores Syria's interest 
in continuing to pursue its objectives, for the 
present at least, through negotiations rather than 
war. President Asad put the Syrian army on a 
precautionary alert, but otherwise Damascus' 
rention over the past month to Israeli military 
maneuvers and talk of war has been unusually 
restrained. 
While in Yugoslavia last week, Asad accused 
the Israelis of raising tensions in the Middle East 
in an attempt to stall negotiations and warned 
that Syria was ready to rebuff any Israeli military 
attacks. Asad said that Syria might again have to 
resort to force if Israel continued to throw 
"obstacles in the path to peace," but in the joint 
communique issued at the end of Asad's visit the 
Syrians implicitly stressed the need to continue 
efforts to find a peaceful solution. 
There is always the dancrr, of course, that 
the Syrians might become disenchanted with the 
peace talks. But they do not appear anywhere 
near that point now. Without Egyptian support or 
the element of surprise, moreover, the Syrians 
know they would risk a military disaster by carry-
ing out a large-scale attack against lErael. 
Right now, President Asad seems mainly pre-
occupied with sorting out his relatio is with 
Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization in preparation for the next stage c.f 
the Geneva talks. He met with PLO chief Yasir 
Arafat earlier this month. The two men re-
portedly agreed to work more closely together to 
bolster the moderate faction of the PLO against 
the "rejection front," which has demanded that 
the organization refuse to attend the Geneva 
conference. 
Although still distrustful of Sadat, iVad is 
said to have told Arafat that Syria as well ;Is the 
PLO must continue to cooperate with Egypt. 
Asad also said he was unwilling to risk a complete 
25X1 
breach with Jordan as long as the threat of war 
with Israel remained, but he promised to try to 
bring about negotiations between Jordan and the 
PLO on an equal basis. Asad would like to see 
some sort of compromise between the PLO and 
Jordan to enable the Arabs to get on with formu-
lating a coordinated strategy for the peace talks. 
Egypt, meanwhile, is continuing prepara-
tions for a tripartite meeting with Syria and the 
PLO possibly to be held at the conclusion of 
Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam's visit to Wash-
ington. The primary purpose of the meeting will 
be to urge compromise on the Palestinians. Egypt 
will try to persuade both Syria and the PLO that, 
while Cairo is not abandoning the Palestinian 
cause, any hope at this point for the eventual 
establishment of a Palestinian state requires that 
the PLO first acknowledge Jordan's right to nego-
tiate for the return of the Israeli-occupied West 
Bank.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Fahmi's recent 
statements in Washington seem to lean heavily in 
Jordan's direction. He told a television inter-
viewer last week that Jordan might represent West 
Bank Palestinians "temporarily," if this were 
necessary to induce an Israeli withdrawal from 
the territory. In the US-Egyptian communique at 
the conclusion of his visit this week, Fahmi 
agreed that the attendance of "other parties" at 
the Geneva conference would be decided only 
when the conference reconvenes. He thus im-
plicitly acknowledged the Palestinians' exclusion 
from the next round of negotiations. 
ISRAELIS IN NO HURRY 
In Israel this week there were signs of 
concern that Washington may be pressing Tel 
Aviv to step up the pace of peace negotiations 
and that the US may be supporting Jordan's 
efforts to secure a troop disengagement agree-
ment on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Press 
commentaries reflected alarm over the US-Jordan 
statement issued at the conclusion of King 
Husayn's visit to Washington on August 18, which 
referred to such a military separation, and over 
Secretary Kissinger's announcement the following 
day that Prime Minister Rabin had been invited to 
visit the US in early September. 
25X1 
Israel's largest daily criticized the invitation 
as an attempt to dictate a timetable to Israel in an 
effort to maintain the diplomatic momentum of 
the negotiations. Another influential journal, 
however, claimed that Rabin may actually prefer 
an early trip to Washington in order to press for 
negotiations with Egypt rather than Jordan as the 
next step. One English-language daily argued that 
references to a disengagement agreement, with its 
buffer zones and UN controls, only serves to 
separate the West Bank from Jordan. Israel is 
anxious to prevent the creation of a separate 
Palestinian state and will try to ensure that any 
West Bank territory it might agree to give up 
reverts only to Jordan. 25X1 
Statements by government officials reflected 
some of the same unhappiness evidenced by the 
press as well as a desire to slow the pace of 
negotiations. Prime Minister Rabin told a para-
military youth group on August 19 that there 
would be no more disengagement pacts such as 
those with Egypt and Syria, but only talks 
pointed toward achieving substantive peace agree-
ments. The same day, a high Israeli official told 
Ambassador Keatina that he assumed there was 
no pressing reason for Rabin to go to Washington 
before October. The official also scoffed at an 
initial disengagement accord with Jordan that 
would involve Israeli troop withdrawals. 
The government's go-slow attitude toward 
the negotiations with Jordan stems in large part 
from its self-imposed commitment to call for new 
national elections before agreeing to any West 
Bank settlement involving )sraeli territorial 
concessions. An inti?r'm agreement with Jordan 
presumably would trigger such elections at a rel-
atively early date. Rabin reportedly prefers to go 
before the electorate only on the basis of an 
overall, final peace settlement with Jordan in 
order to increase the government's chances of 
success and to avoid opposition charges that he 
succumbed to US pressures for a partial settle-
ment without knowing the content of the final  
package.

EGYPT-LIBYA: MEETING PRODUCES LITTLE 
The meeting between presidents Sadat and 
Qadhafi last weekend in Alexandria resulted in 
little more than a papering over of their much 
publicized feud. Both leaders agreed to quiet 
down acrimonious press exchanges and to send 
representatives to another round of talks in early 
September. The dismantling of their once coop-
erative alliance, however, will continue. 
Although Qadhafi had long been eager fo:-
such a meeting, Sadat apparently went along with 
the mediation effort largely because it was ar-
ranged by United Arab Emirates President Sheikh 
Zayid, one of Cairo's wealthy benefactors. The 
meeting received scant coverage in the ET .n 
press, and Sadat only half-heartedly offer. to 
Qadhafi and Sadat 
Friends in public 
2bA"I 
send an emissary to Tripoli to carry on the 
dialogue. 
Neither Sadat nor Qadhafi seems convinced 
that a true reconciliation is possible, and their 
agreement to muffle differences may not survive 
the current withdrawal of the Egyptian military 
mission fron. Libya. Each side has agreed publicly 
to return military men and equipment on loan to 
the other, but diffi=rences could arise over 
whether equipment was "given" or "loaned." 
Moreover, Tripoli reportedly intends to hold 
some Egyptian aircraft and support personnel 
until Cairo returns a squadron of Libyan Mirages. 
If either side begins to suspect the other of reneg-
ing on the agreement, recriminations could 
quickly flare up again. 
Sadat would like to avoid such arr incident, 
if only to keep himself free to deai with the 
broader issue of peace negotiations. The Egyptian 
leAer, however, has little tolerance for Qadhafi's 
antics, and if provoked he might renew his subtle 
appeal to other members of the Libyan leadership 
to challenge Qadhafi's authority. 
Although Qadhafi and his colleagues remain 
publicly united, the Libyan leader cannot afford 
to ignore the possibility of Egyptian trouble-
making. The rift with Cairo has probably aggra-
vated private differences between Qadhafi and his 
subordinates, who have for some time questioned 
the wisdom of their leader's policies toward 
Egypt. There is no evidence that other members 
of the regime are sympathetic to Egypt's position, 
but several are thoroughly disgusted with Qa-
dhafi's arbitrary behavior, and urgings from Cairo 
may encourage them to stronger expression% nf 
dissent with  Qadhafi.

ARABIAN PENINSULA: RADICAL SHIFT

for the Liberation of Oman and the Arab Gulf?
an organization of area radicals dedicated to the 
overthrow of local conservative governments?
suggests an early effort by the Marxist regime in 
South Yemen to establish diplomatic ties with the 
conservative gulf states. There are no signs, 
however, that the Front, which has long been 
conducting the guerrilla war in Oman's Dhofar 
Province as well as organizing cells in the gulf 
states, intends to modify its effort to bring down 
the government of Sultan Qabus by force. 
In early August, Aden radio announced that 
the "second general conference" oF the radical 
organization had adopted, sometime in July, a 
plan whereby the Front's various national units in 
Oman and in the gulf states would become 
independent and free to draw up their own action 
programs designed to fit local political situations. 
On August 7, Aden radio indicated that "Arab 
Gulf" had been dropped from the organization's 
name and that the resulting Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Oman embraced only the Dhofari 
rebels. 
The statements coming out of Aden attri-
bute the break-up of the old Front to the need to 
"mobilize," to "put secondary ccntradictions 
aside," and to crea+e an organizational form that 
will enable the Dhofari rebels to concentrate on 
finally putting down the British and Iranian 
"invasion" of Oman. At no point !n the statement 
on reorganization was there any indication that 
the rebels intend to withdraw their guerrilla units 
from Dhofar. In fact, a later statement reiterated 
their commitment to continue the "armed 
struggle." 
The name change and modification of the 
Front's structure and focus were probably under-
taken at the behest of Aden. The South Yemenis 
tedly are interested in improving relations 
with the gulf states. For Aden to continue to be 
41entified as the primary backer of an organi-
zation overtly committed to the "liberation" of 
those very governments would certainly not make 
25X1 
the establishment of diplomatic relations an easy 
task. At the same time, South Yemen can be 
expected to continue its ties, on a covert level, 
with the gulf radicals. 
Meanwhile, Omani officia's are reacting 
warily to recent proposals being 'ioated by offi-
cials of some moderate Arab stat..s that an Arab 
military force be sent to Dhofar. As yet, the 
Omanis are not certain what the proponents of 
the plan have in mind, but Sultan Qabos is not 
likely to be receptive to any proposal that wou'd 
replace the 1,400-man Iranian force already there 
with an untried Arab contingent. Omani Foreign 
Minister Zawawi has speculated, however, that an 
Arab peacekeeping force along the Oman - South 
Yemen border might be appropriate after the 
Dhofar conflict ends.

IRAN-IRAQ: TENSIONS RISE 
Tehran this week placed its border guard 
units and army divisions near the border with Iraq 
on full alert in response to minor border incidents 
and increased Iraqi military action against the 
Kurds. The new Iraqi campaign against the 
Kurds?which seeks to cut rebel supply lines to 
Iran and to isolate Kurdish forces?increases the 
likelihood of violations of Iranian territory. Iraqi 
aircraft that strayed across the border reportedly 
bombed one Iranian village, and another village 
was shelled. 
Although Iran in the past has dealt with 
Iraqi border violations in a low-keyed manner, the 
Shah evidently has now decided to meet with 
force any Iraqi operations against the Kurds that 
spill over into Iran. He has ordered at least three 
army brigades and supporting units to move 
closer to the border to ? k 
.0 I" 1-1110. ??? - 
The Iranian moves were probably respon-
sible for an Iraqi decision to conduct a military 
exercise near the Iranian border as a show of 
force. On August 20, armored units not involved 
in the Kurdish fighting held maneuvers within a 
few kilometers of the border. 
Despite the increasing tension along the 
border, Baghdad and Tehran apparently intend to 
proceed with talks that began last week in Istan-
bul. These talks are aimed at preparing an agenda 
for possible discussions by the Iraqi and Iranian 
foreign ministers. Iranian Foreign Minister Khalat-
bari left for Istanbul on August 20 to ascertain 
whether or not the preliminary talks have made 
enough progress to justify a meeting with his Iraqi 
coucterpart. 
Baghdad and Tehran have been exploring the 
possibility of talks .:ince last May, when the UN 
Security Council adopted a resolution calling for 
an end to the occasionally violent border dispute 
and for another effort at a negotiateu settlement. 
Discussion at the foreign ministers' level 
depends, however, on whather both sides can 
keep border incidents triggered by Iraqi-Kurdish 
fighting from getting out of hand. A senior of-
ficial in the Iranian Foreign Ministry has told the 
US embassy that Iran expects to make little head-
way in the Istanbul talks in view of what Tehran 
calls continuing Iraqi border provocations. Kha-
latbari announced on August 14 that he had 
instructed the Iranian delegate in Istanbul to 
make representations to his Iraqi counterpart 
about the "border aggression." 25X1 25X1

PORTUGUESE AFRICA: UPS AND DOWNS 
Lisbon's decolonization process in Africa, 
well advanced in the case of Guinea-Bissau, may 
soon move forward in Mozambique. Angola, how-
ever, continues to pose major problems for the 
Spinola government. 
Foreign Minister Soares returned to Lisbon 
last weekend following talks in Dar es Salaam 
with leaders of the rebel Front for the Liberation 
of Mozambique. The talks resulted, according to 
Soares, in tentative agreement on a plan that calls 
for the formation of a provisional government 
with "substantial" rebel participation. The pro-
visional government, to be headed by a "high 
Portuguese official," would run the territory for a 
transitional period of one year, after which power 
would be transferred to the Front. 
Soares indicated that the plan is now being 
studied by President Spinola. If it is finally ac-
cepted by both sides, further talks to work out 
details, such as the extent of rebel participation in 
the provisional government, could take place in 
the near future. 
Lisbon clearly remains in a quandary over 
Angola. It wants desperately to talk with the 
rebels there, but has been frustrated by rivalry 
among the three rebel groups as well as by 
factionalism within one of them?the once-
dominant Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola. Moreover, racial antagonisms are more 
deeply rooted in Angola than in the other terri-
tories, and Lisbon cannot show itself too ready 
for accommodation with the insurgents without 
risking a backlash from the territory's sizable 
white minority. Racial violence has flared up on 
numerous occasions since the coup in Lisbon last 
April, and it could quickly break out again. 
In the absence of talks with the rebels, Presi-
dent Spinola is scheduled to meet with Zairian 
President Mobutu, possibly this weekend, to dis-
cuss the Angolan problem. Lisbon is well aware 
that Mobutu is an influential figure in the African 
liberation movement, and that he has his own 
stake in securing a peaceful transition and stable 
government in Angola. Mobutu, for his part, will 
test Lisbon's attihR-le toward the Zairian-based 
25X1 
Angolan rebel 
Still a problem 
National Front for the Liberation of Angola, 
which he is trying to boost into the dominant 
negotiating position with Lisbon. 
Both the National Front and the Popular 
Movement?the two leading rebel groups?have 
publicly rejected the offer Lisbon made last 
month to estahlish a provisional coalition govern-
ment that would include representatives of the 
rebel organizations and of the white and mestizo 
communities in Angola. At the present time, 
neither rebel group is eager to share power with 
the other. The Popular Movenlent is currently 
preoccupied with a congress taking place in 
Zambia to try to resolve a two-year-old leadership 
dispute. The National Front, long the junior of 
the two groups, does not have as wide a following 
within Angola. Until the Popular Movement's 
leadership crisis is resolved and some sort of 
united front established between the two rival 
organizations, there seems little chance that 
Lisbon's program for decolonization will make 
any headway in Anaola.

CAMBODIA: NEW UN TACTICS 
Following a brief swing through several 
Asian capitals, Prime Minister Long Boret is back 
home with a new strategy for defending Phnom 
Penh's seat at the UN. Boret enlisted the help of 
Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik in developing a 
new approach that hopefully will appeal to pc:), 
tential abstainers and possibly even to some dele-
gations that voted against Phnom Penh last year. 
A pro-Sihanouk resolution will almost cer-
tainly be inscribed on the General Assembly 
agenda this fall. Boret's plan is to offer an amend-
ment to the resolution calling for the establish-
ment of a UN fact-finding team to investigate the 
situation in Cambodia and requesting that no 
further action be taken on the Khmer issue until 
the team submits its report to the 1975 General 
Assembly. 
Although the maneuver is essentially a new 
twist on the old delaying action of last year, it has 
a reasonable chance of success. Jakarta has ap-
parently promised to lobby hard for the amend-
ment. The support of the Philippiro-, Australia, 
and Japan also seems assured. Malaysia, Singa-
pore, and Thailand have so far shown little en-
thusiasm for Phnom Penh's UN cause, but will 
probably fall in line. Strong Asian support or the 
amendment could attract the votes of delegations 
25X1 
hitherto reluctant to involve themselves in what 
they have considered essentially a regional issue. 
In any case Boret's amendment would improve 
Phnom Penh's bargaining position at the General 
Assembly and place Sihanouk' s backers on the 
defensive. 
Arab Dividends 
Phnom Penh may also be on the verge of an 
important breakthrough in its efforts to gain 
increased international recognition on the eve nf 
the UN battle. 
 King Faysal has agreed to 
receive Prime Minister Long Boret in Jidda during 
the last week in August, and a formal announce-
ment of Saudi recognition is expected at that 
time. 25X1 25X1 
The Lon Nol government had been courting 
the Saudis with little apparent success for most of 
the summer. Jidda was slow to approve the visit 
of an unofficial Cambodian delegation, and few in 
Phnom Penh expected that Saudi recognition 
could be obtained. Increased Arab support?even 
Jidda's alone?could create favorable conditions 
at the UN f 
tive.

Vietnam: 
COMMUNIST PRESSURE CONTINUES 
The Communists' summer campaign is now 
in its fifth week, and although the Communists 
have not made any further significant gains into 
the populated sectors of southern MR 1, they are 
continuing the pressure against several outlying 
district towns. In Quang Ngai Province, North 
Vietnamese forces captured the second district 
capital in as many weeks and overran a South 
Vietnamese outpost in Kontum Province. 
Another outpost in Pleiku Province is under 
attack, and the government has lost three isolated 
government positions in southeastern Tay Ninh 
Province. 
Both government and Communist losses 
have been substantial, but the government's 
defense effort has not been crippled in any of the 
regions. South Vietnamese commanders are still 
expressing confidence that they can contain the 
attacks arid eventually recapture most lost posi-
tions. In September, bad weather will begin to set 
in over much of the country. The government is 
hopeful thut the pressure in the northern prov-
inces will then ease sufficiently for them to begin 
retaking some of the lost ground. Military 
officials are cautious in their appraisals, however, 
and apparently are reconciled to some fairly in-
tense fighting and further losses through the end 
of the year. Prime Minister Khiem, for example, 
already has directed General Truong in Military 
Region 1 to begin drawing up a plan to consoli-
date his forces on the periphery of the region's 
major population centers. Khiem acknowledges 
that such a plan could mean additional loss of 
land and people, but he is unwilling to accept the 
heavy casualties and equipment losses that would 
be involved in trying to defend remote and stra-
tegically unimportant positions. 
Although government military commanders 
are generally satisfied with the performance of 
their units, they also are complaining of shortages 
of ammunition, helicopters, and combat equip-
ment. Government commanders are also pointing 
to the large amounts of ammunition and equip-
ment the Communists are using in their current 
campaign as an indication that the Communists 
have sufficient materiel resources to back their 
campaign for the next several weeks. 
Despite this apparent Communist logistic 
advantage, senior government commanders in 
Military Region 3 are finding some shortcomings 
in the enemy's performance. They claim that the 
Communists have used poor infantry tactics, have 
unnecessarily exposed artillery and heavy 
equipment to zir strikes, and have displayed a 
general lack of aggressiveness on the ground. 
Communist main forces in the region, they feel, 25X1 
are not as strong, well-trained or well-led as o *-
nally estimated.

JAPAN: TANAKA'S POLITICAL OUTLOOK 
Three months ago, Prime Minister Tanaka 
was looking ahead to this summer as recompense 
for a year of political setbacks. A slight easing of 
the inflationary spiral, together with the disarray 
of the opposition parties, augured well for the 
chances of his Liberal Democratic Party in the 
Upper House elections scheduled forJuly. Tanaka 
saw in the anticipated victory an opportunity to 
weaken both the left in parliament and his rivals 
within the ruling party, thus setting the stage for 
his own re-election in 1975 to a second term as 
party president and prime minister. 
The election, far from fulfilling Tanaka's 
hopes, reduced Liberal Democratic strength to a 
three-seat majority in the Upper House, sufficient 
to pass legislation but not to fully contriil the 
flow of committee business. The setback pro-
duced a flood of intraparty recrimination, almost 
all of it directed against Tanaka personally. Two 
cabinet members (Deputy Prime Minister Miki 
and Finance Minister Fukuda) resigned imme-
diately in protest over the Prime Minister's high-
handed campaign tactics. 
Just last week, Keidanren, the influential 
umbrella organization of the nation's business 
leadership, announced that it will no longer serve 
as a collection agency for the ruling party. 
Keidanren's action followed growing public criti-
cism of the intimate government-industry rela-
tionship?in particular Tanaka's excesses in 
squeezing campaign funds from the business com-
munity. Corporate donations will not end, but 
the Liberal Democrats will now have to rely upon 
voluntary contributions in place of the assured 
monthly income that Keidanren provided in the 
past. 
The six weeks since the election have been a 
time of political retrenthment. The defection of 
Miki and Fukuda is certainly not a crippling blow 
to Tanaka?he remains very much in charge?but 
it compels him to woo more actively the key 
politicians of the intraparty opposition. In this 
20A-I 
Tanaka 
effort, he has all the tactical advantages of an 
incumbent?most importantly, the power of 
appointment, and control of the party's vast cash 
reserves. 
Tanaka's cause, moreover, is aided by the 
basic political unattractiveness of his challengers. 
Fukuda, the only serious contender at this point, 
will probably find little profit in his self-imposed 
cabinet exile. He is nearly 70, with an image of 
excessive conservatism; his succession hopes are, 
perforce, tied to the possibility cf filling in for a 
politically crippled Tanaka. 
Public support for Tanaka may dip again this 
fall as the goveinment is forced to choose be-
tween either continued fiscal and monetary re-
straints to counter inflation, or stimulation of the 
economy to ease the recession. Barring an acute 
slump in the economy, however, or the emer-
gence of some major political scandal tied to the 
Prime Minister, Tanaka will likely complete his 
first term and go to his party's convention in

Korea-Japan: 
ASSASSINATION AFTERMATH 
The August 15 attempt to assassinate South 
Korean President Pak Chong-hui?which resulted 
instead in the death of his wife and a teenage 
bystander?will have a major political impact 
because of the gunman's background and the way 
authorities in Seoul have chosen to represent his 
actions. 
South Korean authorities claim that assailant 
Mun Se-kwang confessed under interrogation that 
'his effort to kill President Pak was ordered by 
North Korean President Kim II-song. 
The official South Korean version of the 
assassination plot is that Mun, an anti-Pak activist 
among Koreans resident in Japan, was recruited 
for his mission in September 1972 by Kim Ho-
ryong, leader of a chapter of Chosen Soren, the 
pro-Pyongyang umbrella organization of Koreans 
in Japan, and by an unidentified North Korean. 
Mun was told by his mentors that Kim II-song had 
ordered the assassination. According to the South 
President Pak and his wife 
Moments before 
25X1 
Koreans, Mun had ber)n instructed to kill Pak 
earlier, but the date had then been postponed to 
August 15. 25X1 
Much of this story has been confirmed by  
independent investigation, 
Mun was d friend of Kim Ho-ryong, who 
was committed to the North Korean cause; and 
Mun was a longstanding admirer of Kim ll-song 
and Mao Tse-tung. There is as yet no confirma-
tion, however, of Kim Ho-ryong's?or Chosen 
Soren's?involvement in the assassination plot, 
much less of Kim II-song's personal role. 
Seoul's accusations?true or not?will have 
important effects. The political dialogue between 
North and South Korea?moribund in any case?
seems headed for the deep freeze. The signs are 
already evident: Seoul called off a meeting sched-
uled for August 21 and has intensified prov-
ganda attacks on the North; Pyongyang, for 
part, is charging Seoul with "foul intrigues" 
designed to bolster Pak's repression at home and 
to justify a crackdown by Tokyo on anti-Pak 
elements among the 600,000 Koreans in Japan, 
The attempted assassination will reinforce 
President Pak's determination to stamp out 
domestic dissent, whatever the source. There are, 
on the other hand, prominent South Koreans who 
would like to retreat from a policy of repression, 
fearing that it might eventually push the country 
to the brink of internal chaos. They see this as an 
appropriate moment for Pak to rally the popula-
tion in support of policies that clearly distinguish 
the Communist enemy from legitimate political 
opposition. If he follows past form, however, Pak 
will probably disappoint such hopes. 
Further deterioration of the already strained 
relationship with Japan is also likely. Seoul has 
reviewed the dimensions of the "Japanese con-
nection" in the Mun case and has concluded that 
"the North Koreans are using Japan as a base" 
against South Korea. Affronted by official 
Japanese denials of any legal or moral responsi-
bility, and by persistent Japanese press attacks on 
the Pak government, Seoul is demanding a

demonstration of Japanese "sincerity" as well as 
tough action against Kim Ho-ryong and the 
Chosen Soren apparatus. Prime Minister Tanaka's 
presence at Mrs. Pak's funeral apparently has not 
appeased the South Koreans, whose resentment 
could easily take on ultranationalist coloration. 
There have already been demonstrations at the 
Japanese embassy in Seoul. 
The key to Seoul's course of action in all 
these problem areas is Pak himself. The loss of his 
wife, a major softening influence on his otherwise 
stern and unyielding personality, could well lead 
the President to strike  out more forcefully against 
his various opponents.

MALAYSIA: NO ELECTION SURPRISES 
The Razak government is expected to sweep 
the national elections on August 24. Razak's 
National Front, a new nine-party confederation 
that mirrors Malaysia's racial diversity, will 
probably take the lion's share of the 154 seats in 
the lower house of the federal parliament. The 
Front's member parties held 118 of the 144 seats 
in the outgoing parliament, and they are likely to 
do better in the enlarged body. 
The projected election outcome will further 
Prime Minister Razak's aim of achieving a 
"national consensus," a solid coalition govern-
ment that embraces all of Malaysia's major races 
and has a minimum of political opposition. At the 
time, the United Malays National Organiza-
tion, the main government party, predominates in 
the multiracial National Front, and Malay 
political pre-eminence has been enhanced by a 
redrawing of electoral boundaries. 
Under the constitution, the government was 
not required to go to the polls until 1976, but 
Razak decided to act now, believing government 
popularity is at a peak. Economic prosperity cur-
rently is at an all-time high, but there may be a 
downturn later in this year or the next because of 
Malaysia's dependence on exports. The govern-
ment also believes that its position has been 
2bAl 
strengthened by recent successes against Com-
munist insurgents in the east Malaysian state of 
Sarawak, and that these achievements will out-
weigh any public concern over the expansion of 
Communist activities in peninsular Malaysia. 
Moreover, the opposition parties are weak, and 
efforts to establish a united opposition front have 
foundered. 
The campaign has been a quiet one, and the 
government hopes that limiting the campaign to 
three weeks, plus strictures on the discussion of 
racially sensitive subjects, will prevent a recur-
rence of the communal rioting that followed the 
last elections in 1969. Communist terrorists have 
staged several incidents in remote areas, but they 
are not capable of interfering sianifican'-:y with 
the voting. 25X1

MEXICO: MAJOR OIL FIND 
Mexico reportedly has discovered giant oil 
fields in its Chiapas and Tabasco states that could 
change the petroleum market in the Western 
Hemisphere. If the more optimistic estimates of 
the new fields' potential are borne ou'c, within a 
few years Mexico could rank alongside Venezuela 
as the Western Hemisphcre's leading oil exporter. 
Venezuela's proved reserves, now estimated at 14 
billion barrels, have been declining steadily as a 
result of reduced exploration. 
The state oil company discovered the new 
fields in 1972, and all subsequent wells have 
proved successful. Another dozen or so geological 
structures likely to be productive have been 
mapped in the area. Mexico has already ear-
marked $1.4 billion to explore and develop the 
new deposits during 1974-76. 
55444/f 8-74 
These fields are being widely compared with 
the "Golden Lane" fields that made Mexico the 
world's largest oil exporter early in the century. 
The oil is of high quality, and reservoir pressures, 
gas/oil ratios, and other indicators are all highly 
promising. 
25X1 
Mexican officials have already announced an 
abrupt turnaround in the nation's crude oil 
supply. In June, sharply increased production 
from these new oil deposits allowed Mexico to 
break the record of 521,000 barrels per day set in 
1921, to end crude oil imports of 65,000 barrels 
per day, and to declare an exportable surplus. 
Mexican oil production will probably exceed 
750,000 barrels per day by the end of 1974, and 
the country will have an exportable surplus in 
excess of 150,000 barrels per day. Transporting 
this oil should pose no problem as the fields are 
close to port facilities on the Gulf of Mexico. The 
discovery is also likely to bring a 20-percent 
increase in as roductio

PANAMA-CUBA: DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
The Panamanian government announced on 
August 20 its intention to re-establish diplomatic 
relations with Cuba after a break of 13 years. The 
next day, a delegation headed by Nicolas Barletta, 
minister of planning and economic policy, 
traveled to Havana to make the formal arrange-
ment-. Barletta's role as a key economic tech-
in the Torrijos administration suggests that

matters with his hosts. Among Panama's reasons 
for normalizing relations with Cuba is the fact 
thz,t Torrijos believes his friendship with Castro 
buttresses his "revolutionary" image in the 
developing world. The two leaders?who already 
have had extensive dealings with each other, but 
always through intermediaries?are likely to meet 
soon. 
Barletta told a press conference in Panama 
that the re-establishment of diplomatic ties with

said that Panama did not anticipate any economic

that the US maintains very good relations with 
Mexico, which has continued to maintain 
diplomatic ties with Havana despite the sanctions 
imposed in 1964 by the Orwinization of Ameri-
can States. Furthermore, Tort ijos apparently feels 
that the canal treaty negotiations with the US are 
far enough advanced so that they will not be 
impaired by the move toward Cuba. 
Panama joins six other OAS members?
Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Jamaica, Barbados, and 
Trinidad and Tobago?that have full relations 
with Cuba. Guyana, which is not a full member 
state of the OAS, also has diplomatic and trade 
ties with Havana. Several other governments, in-
cluding Colombia, Venezuela, and Costa Rica, are 
strong supporters of lifting the OAS sanctions 
against Cuba, but thus far have held off making 
unilateral moves, preferring to work through OAS 
channels. Given the Panamanian initiative, 
however, and the widespread speculation in Latin 
America about a possible new US policy toward 
Cuba under the administration of President Ford, 
additional unilateral moves may be forthcoming. 
Nothing would please Castro more. He 
recognizes that the OAS is likely to lift the 
sanctions against Cuba eventually, opening the 
way for the renewal of diplomatic relations by 
the member nations. He prefers, however, that 
they take this step outside the OAS framework 
because it contributes toward his goal of scuttling 
the organization.

Nicaragua 
ONCE AND FUTURE PRESIDENT 
General Anastasio Somoza is expected to be 
returned to the presidency on r;eptember 1 in 
general elections that will also result in a substan-
tial majority for the well-organized ruling Liberal 
Party. The legal opposition?a small faction of the 
Conservative Party?constitutionally must receive 
40 percent of the congressional seats and repre-
sentation throughout the government regardless 
of how small its percentage of the vote. The 
non-legal opposition proposes to boycott the 
polls, and its leaders may try to provoke their 
own arrest in a bid for sympathy that might 
attract wider support. 
The presidential contest?if it can be ca:led 
that?is between former President Somoza 
(1967-72) and his colorless opponent, Edmundo 
Paguaga, who currently occupies the one Con-
servative seat on the executive troika. Somoza is 
the third member of his immediate family to hold 
the top office during the 1-0 years his family has 
controlled Nicaragua. Unable constitutionally to 
succeed himself and unwilling to step down for a 
full five-year term, Somoza negotiated a pact with 
Somoza 
2bAl 
the Conservatives in 1971 whereby he would be 
succeeded by a 30-month interim government 
(May 1972 to December 1974). The Conserva-
tives were promised increased participation in the 
government and a revamping of the electoral 
system. For Somoza, whose re-election then was 
recognized as a certainty, the pact offered a faster 
return to office. 
The increase in minority representation was 
embodied in a revised constitution issued earlier 
this summer. Electoral reforms and the 7e-registra-
tion of voters, howevar, were all but ignored. The 
failure to accomplish this important provision of 
the pact has been one factor in causing many 
Conservatives?and some disgruntled Liberals?to 
desert their parties and make common cause with 
the non-legal opposition. This amorphous group 
includes small unregistered parties of all political 
stripes and a wide range of independents. 
Their numbers are relatively small, but they 
have been a very articulate opposition. Twenty-
seven of their leaders were tried for publicly 
branding the election a sham and recommending 
that voters shun the polls on September 1. 
Encouraging non-participation in an election is 
illegal, and the 27 had their citizenship rights 
suspended for six months. Under the suspension, 
they are not allowed to hold public office, hold 
or attend meetings, or to petition?strictly 
interpreted this could prevent them from being 
notaries, a considerable source of revenue for 
many lawyers?or even to apply for a driver's 
license. 
This sentence was probahly intended to 
silence the leaders of the non-legal opposition 
during the remainder of the campaign withnut 
making them martyrs by going to jail. It might, 
however, cause some to speak out more forcefully 
or to incite some minor unrest in an effort to get 
arrested. General Somoza and the National Guard 
can very likely handle any such unrest, but 
heavy-handed tactics would run the risk of 
causing  reaction from other. formerly rriescent 
sectors._

ALTERNATIVES TO NON-PROLIFERATION 
A second session of the committee preparing 
for next year's Non-Proliferation Treaty Review 
Cnnference will begin in Geneva next week. The 
UE views the conference as a means of attracting 
more adherents to the treaty and otherwise 
strengthening it. The non-proliferation system 
established by the 1968 treaty is being increas-
ingly challencted, however. 
The Indian nuclear explosion on May 18 
provided the catalyst for a number of countries to 
re-examine their nuclear policies. More im-
portantly, the failure of the US and the USSR to 
condemn the Indian action has raised doubts 
among many countries about the commitment of 
the major powers to nuclear non-proliferation. 
Many now perceive no disadvantage to keeping 
the nuclear option open, a view that has been 
reinforced by the US decision to provide nuclear 
equipment to Israel and Egypt. 
Within recent months, the concept of the 
regional nuclear free zone?similar to the 1967 
Latin American Nuclear Free Zone?has become 
the most frequently proposed alternative. In-
creased interest in the concept of nuclear free 
zones has led the Iranians to revive their proposal 
to establish a nuclear free zone in the Middle 
East, although they have deliberately left the geo-
graphical limits of the zone undefined. The 
Pakistanis have already made known their in-
tention to submit to the UN a proposal for a 
Southeast Asian nuclear free zone if the Indian 
subcontinent is excluded from the Iranian pro-
posal. 
Earlier this year, a Nigerian spokesman sug-
gested reconsideration of the 1964 Declaration of 
the Organization of African Unity regarding a 
nuclear free :one for Africa. Most recently, 
Romania promoted the concept of nuclear free 
zones, declaring that regional regimes should 
encourage peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
The countries affecteJ by these regional 
arrangements are also claiming new rights for 
parties to such nuclear-free zones. In a recent 
memorandum submitted to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, the organization re-
sponsible for administering the Latin American 
Nuclear Free Zone suggested that parties to 
regional arrangements should enjoy the same 
benefits as parties to the non-proliferation treaty. 
While that treaty has long been condemned by its 
critics as perpetuating discriminatory arrange-
ments in favor of the nuclear powers, incentives 
for accession to the treaty itself would be severely 
diminished if this proposal is widely accepted. 
The US has ccisistently maintained that 
four conditions must be met if a nuclear free zone 
is to be recognized: 
? the initiative should be taken by the 
states in the region concerned; 
? the zone should include all states in the 
area whose participation is deemed important; 
? the creation of a zone should not disturb 
necessary security arrangements; 
? provision should be made for adequate 
verification. 
25X1 
The actual establishment of a nuclear free 
zone and the interpretation of what this entails 
are up to the countries in the region, however, 
and it is thus possible that there would be 
provision for conducting peaceful nuclear 
explosions. Under the terms of the treaty, states 
not possessing nuclear weapons are prohibited 
from conducting peaceful nuclear explosions, 
although the US, UK, and USSR are obligated to 
make available any technology derived from  
nuclear research. I

FRANCE: DEFENSE POLICY REVIEW 
France's current defense policy review, in 
which budgetary cuts are a key concern, could 
lead to discussion of new approaches to West 
European security cooperation. 
Paris has thus far given no hint that policy 
shifts are under consideration. The review may 
have been partially inspired by pressure to reduce 
the budget and to establish new priorities among 
France's ambitious and expensive advanced tech-
nological programs. 
Press accounts this week, prompted by 
articles in the newsweekly L 'Express and military 
journals, speculate, however, that Paris is con-
sidering a new approach to defense cooperation 
with its West European neighbors. The L 'Express 
article, allegedly based on information from a 
presidential adviser, says that President Giscard is 
attempting to deal with the contradiction be-
iween France's defense policy, which treats Ger-
many as a potential enemy, and its Soviet and 
European policies, which call for close coop-
eration among EC members. 
Giscard's perspective is different from that 
of the late President Pompidou, who apparently 
preferred partnership with London rather than 
Bonn. Giscard has a much closer relationship with 
Chancellor Schmidt, dating back to their earlier 
days as finance ministers, than with any British 
leader. 
L 'Express says Giscard has concluded that 
France's defense plans, based on French survival 
alone in d!sr,-:-..-tioered Europe, are unsound. He 
believes that West Germany cannot be expected 
to commit itself fully to European unity in part-
nership with France if Paris is unwilling to 
reciprocate. 
This argument reportedly has led the French 
President to consider developing, with Bonn, a 
program for strengthening French conventional 
forces stationed in West Germany and arming 
them with the Pluton tactical missile. He may also 
be thinking about creating a new body within the 
Atlantic Alliance to discuss European defense 
25)0 
cooperation, especially nuclear matters. Those in 
France who strongly oppose joining NATO's 
Eurogroup, which is concerned with these issues, 
might find such a body an acceptable substitute. 
Giscard reportedly has discussed this idea 
with German and British leaders. The French 
leader has devoted a week to the study of defense 
issues and has met with senior Defense Ministry 
and military officers According to the press, he 
will make public an outline of his plans at the EC 
summit he hopes To call before the end of the 
year. 
Pompidou, during his last year in office, had 
ordered a similar defense review. There were hints 
of policy shifts at that time; some of them are 
similar to those surfacing now. The major dif-
ference may be Giscard's recognition that a 
European defense stra'Legy that fails to take 
account of German DO'NPr is rionmed to failure 
25X1 
UK: MORE NATIONALIZATION 
In a white paper published last week, the 
Labor government outlined a three-part program 
that would increase ?tate control of industry. 
Although the proposals are less sweeping than 
tho7e the Labor Party put forth in its pre-election 
manifesto last winter, Prime Minister Wilson prob-
ably hopes they will placate the party's left wing 
while meeting industry's need to have government 
policy spelled out for investment-planning pur-
poses. Nevertheless, the threat of further nation-
alization, which has existed since Labor came to 
power, has dampened investment and contributed 
to Britain's poor economic growth prospects. 
Besides further nationalization, the white 
paper proposes two new measures to enlarge the 
government's control of industry. The first of 
these would initiate plannin agreements that 
would rt.:, lire companies receiving financial assist-
ance from the government to submit future in-
vestment and prod:Action plans covering a three-
year period; these agreements would apply only

to "major and strategic" manufacturing firms and 
would be drawn up after close consultation with 
the companies and the unions involved. The 
second prcposal would establish a National Enter-
prise Board that would provide investment capital 
and assume part ownership of the company re-
ceiving public funds; it 'you'd also aid financially 
sound companies faced with short-term money 
problems. 
After publication of the white paper, the 
Labor government announced plans to nationalize 
the ports and two chief aircraft builders. Much of 
the shipbuilding industry is to be nationalized 
under previously announced plans, and land 
developers also are to come under state control. 
Public reaction to Labor's proposed program 
has tended to be negative, with the exception of 
the trade union leadership. Both the Tories and 
Liberals have criticized the white paper for failing 
to meet industry's reds. In view of Britain's 
mounting economic problems, the Tories are 
likely to choose nationalization as one of the 
principal election issues. Prime Minister Wilson, 
on the other hand, probably is hopeful that the 
white paper's more moderate proposals will help 
to strengthen his party's position as it prepares 
for the election that is expected this autumn?
perhaps in October.

EUROPEAN COMMUNIST CONFERENCE 
25X1 
Preparations for a conference of European 
communist parties are quickening. An organiza-
tional meeting is to take place in Warsaw in late 
September, and a European conference, possibly 
in East Berlin, will follow in early 1975. If this 
and other regional meetings go smoothly, a world 
communist conference could be held in Moscow 
in 1976. 
Moscow is the prime mover behind the Euro-
pean conference, but the Polish and Italian parties 
are taking the lead in making the arrangements. 
25X1 
The Soviets have probably decided that the organ-
izational work will go more smoothly if they are 
not directly involved at this stage. But the prob-
lems Moscow faces as it tries to get its ideological 
brethren in line have already begun to surface. 
The Romanians, who have agreed to go to 
Warsaw, expect the French and Italian parties to 
revive such controversial subjects as the invasion 
of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the Solzhenitsyn 
affair. The French party may also raise the issue 
of Soviet support for Giscard d'Estaing in the 
recent French presidential election. 25X1 
The Soviets, eager to have as broad a repre-
sentation of European communist parties as 
possible, have so far tolerated lobbying on issues 
they normai!y consider beyond debate. When ine 
meeting opens in Warsaw, however, they probably 
will act more sternly to avoid public embarrass-
ment and to sustain the momentum for the 1976 
world meeting. Moscow may agree to issue pro 
forma invitations to certain non-communist 
groups, but it will so design the proceedings that 
these groups will have no chance of exerting any 
meaningful influence. 
The Romanians clearly share the F rench and 
Italian apprehensions that the Soviets will domi-
nate the Warsaw meeting and subsequent gather-
ings. To avoid too early identification with posi-
tions that could become untenable, Bucharest 
plans to send a low-level delegation to the prepar-
atory meeting and will not disclose its stand on 
issues until the Eu

INTERNATIONAL: EFFECT OF OIL MONEY 
Reports that oil producers have begun in-
vestirrj more funds directly in the US were a 
major factor in the dollar's sharp rise on foreign 
currency exchanges last week. Since August 9, the 
pound declined nearly 2 percent against the dol-
lar; other European currencies declined up to 2 
percent in relatively active trading. 
The reports apparently stem from Kuwait's 
taking a larger part of its mounting oil revenues in 
dollars. Kuwait is not selling off its sterling 
holdings, as some press recoils indicate. The last 
oil payment, made to Kuwait at the end of July, 
consisted of a much higher share of dollars and a 
relatively lower proportion of sterling than 
25A1 
payments made under an agreement with the oil 
companies that was cenegotiated last May. 
Although this agreement does not specify 
the percentages of currencies in which payment 
must be made, Kuwait's willingness to accept a 
lower proportion of sterling indicates that it does 
not intend to increase its sterling holdings as 
rapidly as in the past. 
As a result, the British are receiving a smaller 
share of the return flow of oil revenues and will 
find it necessary to finance a larger proportion of  
their oil bill through dollar borrowinn.
