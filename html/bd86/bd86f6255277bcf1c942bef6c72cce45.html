 Focus on the Ford Trip
 While still pressing to some extent for sig-
 nificant movement toward resolution of the Taiwan
 issue, Peking appears to be increasingly focusing
 on President Ford's forthcoming trip to China as
 its immediate goal in Sino-US relations.
 Sensor Chinese officials recently have indi-
 cated that Peking feels no urgency in dealing with
 the Taiwan problem and that, while. the Chinese
 might prefer to move ahead on the issue during the
 Ford visit, the President was welcome whether there
 is likely to be significant movement on bilateral
 issues or not.  In a conversation with a group of
 American newspaper editors on June 2, Teng Hsiao-
 ping strongly asserted that China would welcome
 the President when he made his visit.
 Teng also has reiterated in several high level
 Conversations in recent months Peking's patience
 regarding Taiwan.  Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua
 told a group of leftist journalists in early May
 that, following a recent study, Peking was convinced
 Washington intended to continue the process leading
 to normal relations and that China did not plan any
 unilateral action to resolve the issue.  Moreover,
 Chinese military attaches in Europe are reported to
 have said in early May that Taiwan was of no par-
 ticular concern at the moment and that the issue
 would take care of itself.
 At the same time, some reports indicate that.

 This assessment suggests that China believes,
 in light of this perception of US preoccupations,
 that it is necessary to assert the importance China
 attaches to the US connection, and above all to make
 certain that the President will in fact make his
 visit.
 In fact, Peking appears to believe at this junc-
 ture that it has more at stake in good relations with
 Washington in terms of Chinese interests in Asia than
 before the denouement in Indochina.  The Chinese
 clearly are concerned that conditions mare favorable
 to the growth of Soviet influence in East Asia have
 been created, in part, by the new situation in Indo-
 china and that a strong US presence in the Asian
 theater as a counter to Moscow now is more important.
 (Chinese Affairs, May 12,_1975.)
 In his early May conversation with the leftist
 journalists, Chiao said that events in Indochina
 have contributed to close 5ino-US relations.  He ex-
 plained that both parties now share an interest in
 limiting Moscow's influence in the area.
 Chinese concerns on this score seem particu-
 larly acute regarding Taiwan.  Peking has demon-
 strated increasing sensitivity that the Soviets,
 under Chinese Nationalist encouragement, might be
 tempted to fill any vacuum created on Taiwan by the
 early withdrawal of US forces.  In a confidential
 conversation last December,
 linked this concern with  a ing s re axe  view

 of the "slow" pace of US withdrawal from Taiwan.  It
 was also in this connection that he surfaced for the
 first time the line that Peking was anxious to re-
 ceive President Ford in China this year whether or
 not the President brought "gifts."
 Despite reduced Chinese expectations regarding
 the Ford visit and reports of disclaimers, senior
 spokesmen with knowledge of the state of play between
 Peking and Washington continue to indicate satisfac-
 tion with the state of Sino-US relations.  Chiao Kuan-
 hua told the editors, for instance, that relations are
 on track and proceeding smoothly.  The PRC-owned press
 in Hong Kong carried without comment the announcement
 of US plans to withdraw combat aircraft from Taiwan,
 indicating that Peking has taken note of and approves
 the move.
 Peking has indicated the importance it attaches
 to major US policies in other, less direct ways.
 Chinese officials have spoken frequently in posi-
 tive terms of a strong US role in Europe and Asia as
 a counter to Moscow in the post Indochina war period.
 The Chinese press has favorably reported indications
 that Washington intends to remain a front rank power.
 The Chinese also have taken a restrained view of the
 exercise of American power, causing, in one instance,
 astonishment on the part of a Japanese Socialist
 Party delegation at Peking's benign attitude toward
 the US.  (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/NO DISSEM ABROAD/

 Mao:  Winning Some and Losing Some
 During his meeting on June 7 with President
 and Mrs. Marcos of the Philippines, Mao more than
 once made reference to the fact that he has been
 criticized.  His comments indicate not only that
 he has his wits about him but that he has apparently
 been deeply stung by the criticism.
 History did not exactly reproduce-itself in
 this situation.  Prior to the Cultural Revolution,
 when Mao made similar comments to foreign visitors,
 he did so to men like Edgar Snow and Andre Malraux,
 people he had known for some time.  To admit to
 a stranger like Marcos that he has critics at home
 suggests the degree to which the criticism has
 troubled him.
 Although Mao tried to portray the criticism
 as basically a healthy situation, there was never-
 theless a touch of bitterness in the inscription
 he wrote for Marcos' daughter in which he noted
 men "of quality" were subject to criticism from their
 peers.  Ironically, the references to his domestic
 critics were made in the presence. of Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping, whose speech to the party central
 committee in January appears to have set the tone
 for much of the criticism of the Chairman.
 Mao has been back in Peking for some two months
 and has met each head of state who has visited the
 country since April.  His return coincided not only
 with the visit of North Korean President Kim I1-song
 but with the .events in Indochina.  Mao may have ex-
 ploited those events to reassert still more strongly
 his own views of the necessity to continue to confront
 Moscow and to turn the tables on those who apparently
 were calling for a less abrasive policy toward the
 Soviet Union and were evidently criticizing him in
 the process.

 In the aftermath of the Indochina war the
 Chinese appear to see themselves surrounded on three
 sides by the Soviet Union or countries more friendly
 to Moscow than to Peking.  This has certainly been
 the burden of Chinese public and private comment
 since the end of the war..  It is almost certainly
 significant that the emergence of this line--and of
 heightened anti-Soviet polemics from Peking--coin-
 cided with Mao's return to the capital.  China's
 refusal to relegate the "anti-hegemony" clause to the
 preamble of the Sino-Japanese treaty is only one bit
 of evidence that the Chinese are continuing to push
 a hard anti-Soviet line, even at some immediate cost.
 Aside from the Soviet issue, on which Mao has
 evidently had success, he has not been vindicated
 of the domestic charges made against him:  his re-
 sponsibility for nine years of political instability
 caused by the Cultural Revolution, the effects of
 this unstable situation on the economy, and the
 Chairman's role in bringing Lin Piao to power.
 The propaganda continues to harp on the unity
 and stability theme and to link this to increased
 production.  The military, once tarred as an insti-
 tution with the Lin Piao brush, is receiving better
 treatment.  Regional military men have led Chinese
 delegations abroad, and Peking recently promoted
 the number two man in Anhwei Province, a military
 man, to the top civilian job.
 Despite Mao's distrust of the military in the
 wake of the Lin Piao affair and his attempts to
 root out any remaining followers of Lin, the mili-
 tary has apparently been successful in turning the
 Lin issue against Mao.  The Chairman in early January
 had to do a self-criticism on his own failure to
 recognize Lin's traitorous designs and his role in
 helping to bring Lin to power.  Because of the
 military's own low standing at the time, Mao might
 have avoided the humiliation of a self-criticism
 were it not for the apparent cooperation of impor-
 tant civilians in the leadership with the military
 on this issue.

 Although Mao's policy toward the Soviet Union
 has remained intact, the Chairman's preoccupation
 during the Marcos meeting with criticism of his

 Ja an: A Tou her Stand
 Growing concern over Soviet intentions in Asia,
 in the wake of recent events in Indochina, was apparently
 the main factor behind Peking's increasingly tough
 stance on the inclusion of an anti-hegemony provision
 in the proposed Sino-Japanese treaty. The Chinese
 also appear to have miscalculated Japanese Prime Minis-
 ter Miki's ability to obtain a consensus on the issue
 in his own Liberal Democractic Party (LDP).
 The failure of the two sides to reach an agree-
 ment on the thorny anti-hegemony issue resulted in
 an end to the current round of treaty talks last week.
 Although both sides still appear anxious to reach
 agreement on the pact, the interruption represents
 a setback to Peking's attempts to move its relations
 with Tokyo onto even firmer footing--and well ahead
 of Moscow's political ties-with the Japanese.
 The toughening of Peking's position on the anti:-
 hegemony clause--a provision generally understood to
 be directed against the Soviet Union--coincided with
 the communist victory in South Vietnam. Peking has
 for some time expressed the view that Moscow's in-
 fluence in Hanoi was greater than its own and that
 the communist victory in the south represented an
 opportunity for the Soviets to increase their in-
 fluence there, as well as in other countries in the
 region.
 One clear reflection of this concern is the no-
 table increase in Chinese propaganda directed against
 Soviet "social imperialism" and "hegemonism" since
 the fall of Saigon: Several of the Chinese attacks
 have emphasized Soviet activities and intentions in
 Japan. Peking also pointed up the "hegemonism" is-
 sue in the joint communique announcing the establishment

 of diplomatic relations with the Philippines earlier
 this month. In that announcement, both countries ex-
 pressed opposition to any third country attempts "to
 establish hegemony or create spheres of influence in
 any part of the world," an even broader formulation
 than that proposed for the 5ino-Japanese peace treaty.
 At the outset of Sino-Japanese talks on the peace
 treaty earlier this year, the Chinese had approached
 the anti-hegemony issue in a relatively low-key man-
 ner. Premier Chou En-Lai, for instance, told a
 member of the Japanese Diet in January that the pro-
 posed anti-hegemony language was not directed at
 Moscow and that, in any event, the issue should not
 be an obstacle to reaching agreement on the pact.
 Chou predicted that negotiations could be completed
 within three months.
 As late as April, the Japanese press was con-
 tinuing to predict imminent agreement on the pact,
 and there were reports that the Chinese had agreed
 to a compromise that would have allowed for the
 inclusion of the anti-hegemony clause in the preamble
 of the treaty, rather than in the text. It was not
 until May--and the communist assumption of power in
 Saigon--that reports were leaked suggesting that
 .Peking had demanded that the anti-hegemony issue be
 treated in the body of the treaty, thus giving it
 greater currency and emphasis. Premier Chou confirmed
 these reports early this month in a conversation with
 a Japanese visitor. Chows remarks were Clearly in-
 tended to show the Japanese in the most forceful
 possible way that Peking would not back down on the
 issue.
 Their toughened stand suggests that the Chinese
 believed that Miki would be able to win approval for
 the treaty in the LDP and the Diet, despite the
 presence in the text of the anti-hegemony clause.

 When Miki took office last December, some Chinese
 officials had expressed suspicions about his
 willingness and ability to follow up on agreements
 made with former Prime Minister Tanaka, but evi-
 dence of these fears seemed to subside in recent
 months. In addition, Peking had made it clear to
 Tokyo that Miki's performance on the peace treaty
 would be considered a test of his intention to main-
 ta~_n the tilt toward China that Tanaka had begun in
 1972 when relations between the two countries were
 established.
 The Chinese have almost certainly not given up
 on Miki and probably hope that he will still be able
 to obtain LDP approval for the treaty before too
 long. Peking, therefore, can be expected to maintain
 pressure on Tokyo. In fact,         has reported
 that, in late May, Chou sent a letter to Tanaka, in-
 viting him to visit Peking in order to discuss the
 peace treaty. The Chinese may hope to convince Tanaka
 that his cooperation is needed in order to break the
 impasse in the treaty negotiations. Getting this
 kind of assistance from Tanaka, however, will be a
 difficult task in light of the bad blood that has
 characterized the Tanaka - Miki relationship ever
 since Miki walked out of Tanaka's cabinet last year.
 Even if agreement on the anti-hegemony clause
 is reached fairly soon, however, the treaty cannot
 be ratified until next autumn when the Japanese
 Diet reopens. (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/CONTROLLED

 traces the current problems to
 e purge o   first secretary Nan Ping as a Lin
 conspirator in the summer of 1972 and the subsequent
 need to reorganize the provincial party committee.
 The central work team led by Tan Chi-lung that
 was given the job of carrying out the :reorganization
 soon ran head on into Chekiang's two major factions
 and the thorny rehabilitation issue.
 One faction, now called the Mountain Top
 _faction, was primarily composed of officers from
 the 20th Army and the 5th Air Force and was aligned
 with the purged Nan Ping. The other faction, the
 present Mountain Base faction, was primarily made
 up of personnel from the Chekiang Military District.
 They had long opposed Nan Ping, apparently with
 the active support of Politburo member and Canton
 Military Region commander Hsu Shih-yu, who was then
 boss of neighboring Kiangsu Province and commander
 of the Nanking Military Region, of which Chekiang
 is a part.
 Personal rivalries and competition for the
 limited number of choice political posts seem to

 be the primary source of friction between the
 factions.  Disagreement over substantive policy
 issues does not appear to have played a role in
 their ongoing dispute.
 Under the direction of Tan and the central
 work team, many members of the 20th Army were
 removed from provincial party posts and replaced
 by veteran and rehabilitated cadre, most of whom
 had been originally purged by Nan Ping.  Many of
 the "mass representatives" who shot to power
 during the height of the Cultural Revolution also
 were removed and sent back to their former units.
 Many of the Mountain Base faction members with
 the support of Tan and Hsu were able to gain spots
 on the reorganized committee.  Mare importantly,
 they gained control of the investigation into the
 old Chekiang committee and thus were able to pro-
 tect their own people.
 The initial reorganization intensified the
 feuding rather than ending it, and members of the
 Mountain Top faction appealed to their supporters
 in Pekin  for help, demanding rehabilitation.
 Peking became concerned
 about "leftist ten encies" as the Mountain Base
 -faction increased its control and possibly about
 the continuing machinations of Hsu Shih-yu as well,
 who was transferring military cadre under his
 command in and out of the province.  In February
 1973, Chau En-lai supposedly traveled to the
 province, and in effect gave the Mountain Top
 faction a clean bill of health, declaring that
 both the 20th Army and 5th Air Force were faithful
 to Chairman Mao.
 After the Chou visit the Mountain Top faction
 was able to improve its position substantially,
 partly because Tan, who had just been named
 first secretary, withdrew his support from the

 Mountain Base Group--apparently sensing a trend--
 and tried to assume a more neutral stance. The net
 result was that he drew criticism from. all groups.
 The situation began to deteriorate during the
 spring and summer of 1973 as the factions argued
 over who would represent Chekiang ,at the 10th
 Party Congress.  When the anti-Confucius campaign
 began in earnest shortly thereafter, both factions
 seized the opportunity to attack their opponents
 in wall posters as Confucianists.  Fighting
 between the rival groups soon broke out and Peking
 was forced to actively intervene.
 Peking tried a number of tactics as the
 fighting worsened throughout 1974.  Factional
 leaders were called to Peking in an effort to
 resolve their differences, military units were
 used to separate warring groups, central directives
 specifically addressed Chekiang's problems, and top
 central leaders, particularly Wang Hung-wen,
 personally intervened to try and set things
 straight.  According to one unsubstantiated report,
 elements of the 20th Army were even rotated out
 of the province--all with little lasting effect.
 As the situation has deteriorated, Peking apparently
 has become more and more disillusionec! with Tan's
 performance, and even recently rebuked him for
 his inability to keep order.
 The events in Chekiang make seve~:?al important
 points about the general nature and cause of
 provincial factionalism.  First, provincial
 factionalism is deep seated and self perpetuating.
 The factions active today are the dirE:ct descendants
 of those formed ten years ago.  Second, the
 factionalism has an intensely personal nature;
 policy issues often seem to be relatively unimpor-
 tant.. Third, despite the-long. life of the factions,
 their members do change sides as the political winds

 change.  Fourth, outsiders, such as Tan, who are
 brought in to restore order, face formidable
 obstacles, including Peking's apparent  inability
 to render meaningful assistance.  Fifth, provincial
 factions probably could not survive without the
 covert support of top leaders in Peking, who are
 only too eager to exploit local differences for
 their own political ends.  Sixth, Peking's vague
 and loosely worded directives often make matters
 worse by allowing rival groups to interpret them
 to suit their own needs.  And seventh, changes
 in the line generated by factional differences in
 Peking have heightened the bitterness and
 exacerbated the problems at the local level.
 While Chekiang's problems are typical of
 those found in other provinces, they are more severe
 than most.  Chekiang really is an example of the
 wor:~t possible case.  The overall political
 situation has been improving in most provinces,
 despite the many problems, and the current outlook
 is reasonably good that this trend will continue.
 (see Chinese Affairs June 9, 1975.)  Further
 progress, as always, is dependent on the resolution
 of differences in Peking..  If the moderate group
 in the national leadership continues to consolidate
 its position, the differences should gradually
 diminish.  (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/CONTROLLED

 Fukien--Will the Exce tion Become the Rule?
 An account of a recent work conference on
 militia training in Fukien Province, which places
 heavy emphasis on improving military training,
 seems out of phase with the prevailing line on the
 militia.  Previous broadcasts had repeatedly
 emphasized the theme that the primary task of the
 militia, particularly in the cities, was to sup-
 port the campaign to strengthen the proletarian
 dictatorship by improving law and order.
 The Fukien conference was highlighted in a
 speech by party first secretary Liao Chih-kao,
 who is also the political commissar of the Fukien
 Military Region and Military District.  The broad-
 cast made several references to a "directive" and
 "Chairman Mao's instructions" on military train-
 ing.  Although the context is not entirely clear,
 the references to the directive seem to cite a
 previous order rather than a new instruction.
 Even so, Fukien is clearly re-emphasizing military
 training directives.
 This attention to militia training may be
 pegged to the June 19 anniversary of a Mao state-
 ment on the militia.  That statement, however,
 refers to strengthening the militia "organiza-
 tionally, politically and militarily," and does not
 represent special emphasis on training.  It is likely,
 in fact, that training has been allowed to slide
 because of the focus on political and production
 tasks, and the time has come in Fukien to redress
 the imbalance.  Liao said that doing a good job
 in training would have "a direct bearing" on the
 successful conduct of the present campaign to
 strengthen the proletarian dictatorship and.
 recalled the "crimes" of Lin Piao and company in

 opposing militia training.  As a coastal province,
 Fukien is more likely to be sensitive to keeping
 militia training at reasonable levels than an
 inland province.
 While it remains to be seen whether other
 provinces will now begin to stress militia train-
 ing, Peking continues to envisage an important
 role for the militia, or at least specially
 selected units, in supporting the regular forces
 in wartime.  The recent communist victories in
 Indochina have been cited as validating this
 "people's war" concept.
 The Fukien broadcast is also striking for
 one thing that it did not say.  There was no
 reference to learning from Shanghai's advanced
 experience.  The urban militia movement appeared
 to be-gin in Shanghai in the fall of 1973 and, in
 any event, Shanghai has been the acknowledged model
 for the militia's role in keeping order.  The
 model gives very little attention to training.
 The militia's heavy involvement in maintain-
 ing order and aiding production has clearly been
 a policy pushed by Peking moderates.  An adjust-
 ment: that allows for more training--always con-
 ducted so as not to interfere with production--in
 conjunction with continued security duties would
 seem to be an expansion rather than a reversal of
 that policy.  Both Shanghai and Fukien emphasize
 the leading role of the party and the supporting
 role of the regular forces in overseeing militia
 affairs.  Moreover, the Fukien broadcast makes it
 clear that militia units cannot expect any large
 increases in weapons or equipment by stating that
 the question of supplies should be solved using
 the principle of "self-reliance."  (CONFIDENTIAL)

 Promotion in Anhwei--the Teng Connection?
 With the elevation of June 18 of Sung Pei-Chang,
 first political commissar of the Anhwei Military
 District to first secretary of the Anhwei Provincial
 Party Committee, Peking has again broken the pattern
 of appointing civilians to vacant, top provincial
 party posts--the only other exception has been the
 appointment of Lu Jui-lin in Kweichow.  Sung's ap-
 pointment fills the vacancy left by the transfer of
 former first secretary Li Te-sheng to Liaoning in
 December 1973.  Li, in fact, had not appeared in
 Anhwei for a number of years, apparently being pre-
 occupied by his other former job as ]zead of the PLA
 General Political Department.
 Although Sung was probably associated with Li--
 he came to Anhwei in September 1967 with Li's
 Twelfth Army--he has managed to avoid any fallout
 from Li's continuing political difficulties.  Al-
 though he was accused of unspecified crimes with
 Li in a July 1974 Nanking wall poste:r, Sung has
 maintained a leading role in Anhwei.
 Sung also has probable connections with Teng
 Hsiao-ping.  A career political commissar, Sung
 served in units which later became part of the
 Second Field Army.  Sung also served in the south-
 west region in 1950-1951 during Teng's tenure as
 regional boss.
 In addition to his possible connections with
 Teng Hsiao-ping--obviously a good man to know these
 days--Sung's appointment reflects the practice of
 appointing experienced leaders to head problem
 provinces.  Although he is a military man, Sung is
 a career political commissar and not a troop com-
 mander.  Sung has also had ample experience in

 The Proletarian Dictatorship
 Campaign:  A Humdrum Affair
 For a campaign that began with a series of
 authoritative media pronouncements and articles
 by two Politburo members, the current proletarian
 dictatorship campaign seems to have leveled off
 into essentially just another of China's endless
 study movements.  The campaign's heavy emphasis on
 unity, stability, and production is in sharp con-
 trast to previous campaigns--the convulsions of the
 Cultural Revolution, the shock and witch hunt of
 the Lin Piao affair, and the confusion and apprehen-
 sion of the anti-Confucius campaign.
 The so-called "rectification" phase of the cur-
 rent campaign, anticipated with some fear at the
 local levels, has turned out to be relatively harm-
 less.  It focuses on corruption, profiteering, petty
 theft, and influence-peddling, and the wrongdoers are
 subjected not to purge but to patient :re-education.
 Although there have been isolated instances of
 overzealous  local officials stepping outside the
 campaign's ground rules by confiscating private farm
 plots or completely forbidding sideline production,
 provincial broadcasts have consistently issued re-
 bukes on this score.  The broadcasts warn local offi-
 cials not to take any rash action, in fact not to
 make any changes at all, unt~1 they have thoroughly
 studied and understood the theoretical issues. The
 broadcasts make it clear that the study process will
 be protracted, and that changes in current economic
 practices will be a long time in coming.  On one oc-
 casion, Radio Peking even went so far as to define
 "restricting bourgeois rights" as "safeguarding" them
 from infringement by over-eager local officials.

 As in any campaign, the current movement
 carries with it the potential for a given group
 to turn the campaign into a political issue to
 be used against long-time adversaries.  Peking's
 emphasis on unity and the constant criticism of
 "factionalism" are plainly meant as warnings
 against such practices.  The warnings have thus
 far been largely successful, the only notable--and
 predictable--exception being troubled Chekiang
 Province.  The area has long been plagued by fac-
 tional disputes, and one report claims the current
 campaign has given the various factions an excuse
 to continue their conflicts.
 In addition to emphasizing Peking's interest
 in unity and stability and its preoccupation with
 economic affairs, the campaign has provided a
 glimpse into the roles of Politburo members Chang
 Chun-chiao and Yao Wen-yuan.  Both wrote major ar-
 ticles on the campaign, and Mao reportedly asked
 them to compile the series of quotations from Marx,
 Engels, and Lenin that has been the basis for much
 of the current study.  According to one provincial
 broadcast, the quotes were compiled by the "edi-
 torial departments" of People's DazZy and Red Flag.
 Yao has long been thought to be associated with
 Red Flag and Chang reportedly inherited from Chou
 En-lai the task of screening major People's DaiZz~
 articles.  The provincial broadcast tends to con-
 firm Yao's connection to Red Flag and Chang's to
 People 's  Dai Z~ .     (CONFIDETdTIAL  NO  FOREIGN  DISSEM)

 Moving More Frei ht
 China's transport situation, after some disrup-
 tion in 1974, is now back on the track.
 The railways, identified last year as a major
 brake on industrial progress, now report substantial
 ,rises in freight. flow.  The mass down-to-the-freight-
 yard  movement of administrative and military cadres
 last fall may have helped stimulate this increase.
 Although disruptions growing out of the anti-Lin,
 anti-Confucius campaign in 1974 continued to be re-
 ported this spring in Chekiang and Anhwei, the overall
 situation seems to have been corrected.
 More freight is also moving by other means.
 Waterway freight volume for the first. 4 months this
 year is up 17.5 percent over the same period last
 year.  Highway freight also increased: substantially

 A                speech, which was delivered
 in November 1974 by Chao Tzu-yang, first secretary
 of the Kwangtung Provincial Party Committee, high-
 lights what have proved to be continuing problems
 for the party.
 In the speech, Chao identified two areas of con-
 cern, factionalism and non-implementation of central
 directives.  Although the situation in Kwangtung was
 not as chaotic and violent as in some other provinces,
 the bickering within the party, apparently at high
 levels, was serious enough to merit Chao's attention.
 Adopting a get tough attitude, Chao chastised
 those party members that breach party .discipline and
 engage in factionalism.  Factional activities within
 the party were considered to border on revisionism.
 In an apparent reference to Hsu Shih-yu, Canton Mili-
 tary Region commander, Chao condemned those "leading
 cadres who have supported these erroneous movements"
 in defiance of central instructions.  Chao's attack
 on factionalism is the strongest and most specific
 such assault of which we are aware in a number of
 years; in many respects it is harder hitting than
 any attack on factionalism at the close of the Cul-
 tural Revolution.  In fact it seems to be a precursor
 of Teng Hsiao-pings admonition to restore the-pre -
 Cultural Revolution prestige of the government and
 party.
 Poor performance by party cadres during the
 anti-Lin campaign and continued non-implementation
 of central directives led Chao to sharply criticize
 party members and even party committees for their
 lack of compliance.  Party members were also chas-
 tised for not obeying local party committees.  They
 were accused of disregarding the principle of democratic
 centralism and raising the "sham principle of
 listening only to the Central.'

 To correct the situation, Chao advocated in-
 creased theoretical study for cadres, stricter
 party discipline, and increased criticism--self-
 criticism, but no purges.  These themes were all
 re-emphasized at the national level in speeches at the
 Second Plenum of the Tenth Central Committee and
 the Fourth National People's Congress.  These solu-
 tions are also part of the program for cadres under
 the current dictatorship of the proletariat cam-
 paign, indicating-that factionalism and non-imple-
 mentation of party policies are still problems.
 Apparently Chao's prescriptions have been suc-
 cessful in Kwangtung, as the proletarian dictatorship
 campaign has moved toward the rectification phase.
 Although                      have noticed
 a few posters in ica ing con inuing re uctance on
 the part of cadres to implement the dictatorship of
 the proletariat campaign, the general lack of offi-
 cial slogans and articles on the rectification phase
 of the campaign suggest that Chao Tzu-yang has things
 under control in Kwangtung.  (SECRET NO FOREIGN DIS-
