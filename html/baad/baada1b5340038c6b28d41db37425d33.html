 The three-way split in the new French national assembly
 resulting from enlarged Communist representation on the left,
 the new Poujadist bloc on the extreme right, and a weakened and
 divided center, leaves little possibility of achieving a stable
 coalition government.  The Algerian problem will probably force
 the center parties--the Faure-Pinay and Mendes-France groups--
 to find some compromise on which to base a coalition before the
 assembly convenes on 19 January.  Any new government would probably
 find itself in the position of having to`seek a new majority in
 the assembly on each major issue.   F__                I                25X1

 The confident statements made by the Soviet leaders at year's
 end reflected the belief that the Bulganin-Khrushcbev foreign
 policies achieved their goals in 1955,,and that the USSR is in a
 favorable position militarily, economically, and in its foreign
 relations to compete effectively with the West in international
 power politics.  They stressed the importance of the Egyptian-led
 group of Arab states which they regard as an expanding nucleus
 of "neutralism," and implied that a de facto alliance of Moscow,
 Peiping and New Delhi would, as Lenin had suggested, largely
 determine the fate of mankind.                                                 25X1

 The Indonesian cabinet has only temporarily warded off the
 danger that it may collapse over the current Dutch-Indonesian
 talks.  Should the discussions show no positive results within the
 next week, the cabinet will again be subjected to serious crit-
 icism both from within its'own ranks and from President Sukarno
 and the opposition parties.  The Masjumi party is reported ready
 to compromise "in every possible way" in order to stay,in office
 until the newly elected parliament is seated in spring, and there
 is a possibility that the pro-Western foreign minis          be
 dropped from the cabinet.                                                       25X1
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Soviet Bloc Relations With Greece:   The USSR and its European
 Sate    tes in recent months-have been making efforts to
 improve their relations with Greece and encourage it to
 follow a neutralist policy in foreign affairs.  Moscow's
 immediate aim is to exert enough influence in the Greek
 elections, scheduled for February, to seat a government in
 Athens that would agree to closer ties with the Soviet bloc.
 It has been reported that prior to the election, the USSR
 plans to offer subs                           economic aid to
 25X1           Greece.                                          . . .  .  .  Page  L
 Rumanian Party Congress:   The first of the new five-year plans
 of the Soviet bloc to be spelled out in detail, the Rumanian
 Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), was presented to the second
 Rumanian party congress in Bucharest 23-28 December.   The
 plan continues the First Five-Year` Plan,'s _emphasis on.capital
 goods production and also calls for a sharp increase in farm
 collectivization.  Other Satellite plans,to be announced
 shortly, will probably follow the same principles.  The
 congress also confirmed the stability of the party leadership
 but stressed the need                ty'discipline.

 Cambodia:  Prince Sihanouk has temporarily given up his post as

 has begun as a result.  At the same time, Cambodia is viewing
 sympathetically a Soviet bid to establish diplomatic rela-

 by the anti-American Bong Souvannouvong.
 Finnish Presidential Election:  Finland goes to the polls on
 16 aana 17 January to select 300 presidential electors.  Since
 no single political party is expected to win a majority of
 electors, considerable maneuvering will probably precede the
 actual selection of the president on 15 February.  The chances:.
 of any but a candidate sympathetic toward the West being

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 January 1956
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 FRENCH ELECTION
 The three-way split in the
 new French National Assembly
 resulting from enlarged Com-
 munist representation on the
 left, the new Poujadist bloc
 on the extreme right, and a
 weakened and divided center,
 leaves little possibility of
 achieving a stable coalition
 government.   The Algerian prob-
 lem will probably force the
 divided center parties to find
 some compromise onwhich to
 base a coalition before the
 assembly convenes on 19 January.
 Any new government would prob-
 ably find itself in the position
 of having to seek a new major-
 ity in the assembly on each
 major issue.
 The main unknown factor in
 the new assembly will be the
 attitude of the extreme right
 antitax forces of Pierre Pou-
 jade.   The nucleus of his
 strength rests with the small
 independent shopkeepers whose
 livelihood has depended on tax
 evasion.   Much of his support
 in the elections represents a
 protest against the regime be-
 yond the question of taxes.
 Apart from his antitax stand
 and a call for a convening of
 States General like that of
 1789 to air the complaints of
 the people, he has offered no
 positive program.
 Poujade has hinted, how-
 ever, that he might be willing
 to co-operate with other parties
 to form a government, and his
 national organization is meet-
 ing immediately to decide on
 its policies.  He has reportedly
 stated his preference for Pre-
 mier Faure over a government
 headed by Mendes-France or a
 Socialist.   In the immediate
 future, at least, he is expected
 to maintain a tight rein on his
 deputies, who will probably re-
 main largely in opposition.
 Any coalition including them
 might lose even more votes on
 the left.
 The non-Communist parlia-
 mentary groups,  from the So-
 cialists on the left to the
 Peasants and ex-Gaullists on
 the right, cover a wide range
 of differing views on principal
 issues which have been accentuated

 by the animosities of the elec-
 toral campaign.   The Socialists
 are in a key position despite
 the loss of some seats.   They
 increased their popular vote
 and appear to have picked up
 enough additional worker sup-
 port to remove, for the moment,
 pressure from the rank and file
 for a move toward a popular
 front.
 The poor showing made by
 the Faure-Pinay coalition, par-
 ticularly the losses by Pinay's
 Independents who had expected
 to make significant gains, will
 probably increase the coalition's
 willingness to reach an under-
 standing with the parties of
 the Republican Front.   Some In-
 dependent leaders have already
 hinted at obtaining Socialist
 support of, if not participa-
 tion in, a government coalition
 to forestall a popular front.
 Moreover, the Popular Republi-
 can leaders, restive in their
 PART I
 affiliation with the right,
 have reiterated their preelec-
 tion plea for broad co-operation
 among the center parties.   Ef-
 forts will also be made by the
 Radical Socialists to patch up
 their internal disputes.
 The Communists are playing
 up  as  a  great  victory   the
 sharply increased parliamentary
 representation which they won
 with a slightly smaller pro-
 portion of the popular vote.
 They have renewed their popular
 front offer to the Socialists,
 and can be expected, despite con-
 tinued rebuffs, to deep on press-
 .ing                                                       for broad co-operation on

 BULGANIN'S AND KHRUSHCHEV'S
 YEAR-END SPEECHES
 The confident statements
 made by the Soviet leaders at
 year's end reflected the belief
 that the Bulganin-Khrushchev
 foreign policies achieved their
 goals in 1955 and that the USSR
 is in a favorable position mili-
 tarily, economically and in its
 foreign relations to compete ef-
 fectively with the West in inter-
 national power politics.
 A conviction on the part
 of the Soviet leaders that their
 military position is becoming
 almost invulnerable is suggested
 by two unusual references Bul-
 ganin and Khrushchev made to
 significant recent developments
 in the field of advanced weapons.
 Bulganin's discussion of
 the need to end the arms race
 by concluding an agreement to
 prohibit nuclear weapons in-
 cluded a reference to rocket
 weapons which he described as
 having undergone particular de-
 velopment over the past few years
 and - ecoming intercontinental
 weapons."  Khrushchev's descrip-
 tion of the latest Soviet hydro-
 gen bomb test as the "equivalent
 of many million tons of conven-
 tional explosives" appeared in
 the context of a warning to the
 Western powers against the "er-
 roneous assumption" that they
 The center parties remain

 ber of other key issues from
 economic reform to the question
 of state aid to church schools,
 and any coalition formed quickly
 to deal with Algeria is almost
 certain to be inherently un-
 stable.
 possess "some kind of superi-
 ority in strength and hence...
 it is not to their advantage
 to disarm."
 In this New Year's eve in-
 terview, Bulganin also rejected
 the theory that the possibility
 of thermonuclear war is auto-
 matically excluded by the East-
 West nuclear stalemate.   He did
 state that "the circles which
 would like to unleash war" are
 somewhat deterred by the fact
 that under present conditions
 nuclear weapons "cannot be used
 with impunity," but he accused
 these circles of spreading
 "dangerous assertions" that
 peace can be preserved by con-
 tinuing the atomic arms race.
 This competition,  he said,  is
 increasing the threat of a new
 war, and he called for fresh
 efforts to achieve a disarmament
 agreement.
 Bulganin and Khrushchev
 defended Moscow's position on
 all the topics discussed at the
 Geneva foreign ministers' con-
 ference (Germany and European
 security, disarmament, and ex-
 pansion of East-West contacts),
 and gave every indication that
 they intend to seek their ob-
 jectives by cultivating the
 "Geneva spirit."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 January 1956
 Khrushchev's criticism
 of President Eisenhower's
 Christmas message to the peo-
 ples of Eastern Europe was
 made in the context of an at-
 tack on the "strange under-
 standing" of the Geneva spirit
 recently displayed by some
 Western statesmen.  He de-
 clared that the message vio-
 lated the Geneva spirit and
 was "nothing else but rude
 interference in the domestic
 affairs of free and sovereign
 states--members of the United
 Nations."
 This was the first time
 top Soviet leaders had leveled
 a public personal criticism
 at President Eisenhower.   Khru-
 shchev, however, protested his
 regret at having'to speak a-
 bout the President, "whom I
 especially respect," and has-
 tened to add that he was merely
 replying to those who inter-
 fere in the domestic affairs
 of the People's Democracies
 in violation of the Geneva
 spirit.   He also denied that
 his statements in India and
 Burma were insulting or of-

 apparent in their remarks con-
 cerning the Egyptian-led faction

 tralism Moscow has long encour-
 aged.   Moscow regards this
 faction as an expanding nucleus
 of a bloc of "neutralist" states
 which will agree to closer ties
 with the Soviet bloc.
 The leaders repeatedly
 asserted that the success of
 their trip through Soviet Asia
 had borne out the correctness
 of the Leninist principle of
 Soviet foreign policy--"the
 policy of peaceful coexistence
 of nations with different so-
 cial and political systems."
 They recalled Lenin's predic-
 tion that the time would come
 when the hundreds of millions
 of people in Asia would play a
 part in deciding the "destinies
 of the whole of humanity."
 According to Bulganin, "'this
 time has now come."
 They also attempted to
 demonstrate that another Leninist
 prediction was materializing by
 the emergence of a de facto
 alliance between Moscow, Peiping
 and New Delhi, thereby bringing
 together the three most heavily
 populated nations of the earth.
 The clear implication was that

 and his subsequent speech to the
 Knesset suggest that Israel
 intends to continue a tough
 policy toward any Arab incur-
 sions on its frontiers.                         Ameri-
 can officials in Israel believe
 Ben-Gurion's hand is still
 strongly on the helm and that
 efforts to improve the country's
 military and defensive position
 will continue on an urgent basis.
 Differences of opinion
 between Ben-Gurion and Foreign
 Minister Sharett,  as indicated
 in reports of the Mapai debate,
 appear to be centered on ques-
 tions of timing rather than of
 policy itself.   Sharett's fail-
 ure to obtain definitive support
 from the Western powers has not
 yet been openly criticized,  and
 he is pressing very hard for
 favorable action on outstanding
 arms requests.

 There is no firm evidence

 The Masjumi, which heads
 the cabinet, is reportedly
 ready to effect a. compromise
 "in every possible way" in order
 to stay in office until the
 newly elected parliament is
 seated sometime next spring.
 The cabinet's "solid" a-
 greement to continue the talks
 reverses a situation existing
 a few days before but at best
 appears to be a temporary ar-
 rangement.   A small government
 party, the Indonesian Islamic
 League (PSII),  had demanded
 suspension of the Dutch talks,
 and one of its leaders was
 planning to preside at a. left-
 wing rally which would demand
 the "return" of Netherlands
 New Guinea--a major issue be-
 tween Indonesia and the Neth-
 erlands which is being soft-
 pedaled in the talks.   The
 rally on New Guinea has now
 been postponed until 7 January.
 The Nahdla.tul Ulama  (NU),
 a major government party,  had
 also been critical of the
 government's de-emphasis of the
 New Guinea question and indi-
 cated an intention to withdraw
 from the cabinet.   But appar-
 ently it plans to give Prime
 Minister Harahap another chance.
 The Masjumi presumably
 has made certain concessions to
 these dissident parties.   It
 possibly offered to withdraw
 Indonesia's delegation if no
 progress were made in the talks
 during the next week,  and
 Prime'Minister Harahap may be
 considering dropping his pro-
 Western nonparty foreign
 minister.
 The Masjumi is especially
 eager to stay in office until
 next spring so that it can in-
 fluence the naming of the ap-
 pointive parliament members,
 21 or less, who may hold the
 balance of power in the new
 legislature.
 The Ma.sjumi is trying to
 form a "Moslem front" with the
 PSII and the NU in order to
 strengthen its bargaining
 position in negotiations for
 a new cabinet after parliament
 is installed.
 The September elections
 having failed to give any one
 party anything like a majority,
 a coalition government will
 be necessary, and Masjumi
 leaders fear that unless they
 form an alliance with NU, they
 may be relegated to minor
 cabinet posts.  They fear they
 might even be excluded from the
 cabinet.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 January 1956
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Soviet Bloc Relations With Greece
 The USSR and its European
 Satellites in recent months
 have been making efforts to
 improve relations with Greece
 and encourage it to follow a
 neutralist policy in foreign
 affairs.   According to a recent
 report,  Moscow plans in the
 near future to offer substantive
 technical and economic aid to
 Greece.
 The latest Satellite over-
 ture was Bulgaria's announce-
 ment on 30 December that it is
 prepared to resolve the rep-
 arations question,  but would
 prefer to make a resolution
 dependent on the resumption of
 normal relations. It has agreed
 to advaice a preliminary pay-
 ment to Greece as a token of
 good will.   Reparations claims
 against Rumania and Bulgaria
 arising out of World War II
 have figured prominently in
 Orbit-Greek friction.
 Bulgaria's initiative ap--
 parently grew out of Soviet
 prodding.  Soon after the Soviet
 ambassador to Greece offered
 last June to use Soviet influ-
 ence to effect a settlement of
 Greek financial claims against
 Bulgaria and Rumania,  Rumania
 agreed to settle outstanding
 claims.
 Albania, Bulgaria and
 Rumania have all officially
 expressed the desire to re-
 establish full diplomatic re-
 lations with Greece.   Poland
 Rumanian Party Congress
 The second Rumanian party
 congress,  which met in Bucharest
 from 23 to 28 December after a
 postponement of 20 months,
 confirmed the stability of the
 and Greece are expected to
 exchange ambassadors soon.
 Bulgaria and Greece last July
 concluded their first general
 boundary settlement since the
 end of the war,  but the Alba-
 nian-Greek boundary question
 remains open because of sharply
 conflicting territorial claims.
 In the next few months,
 Moscow's immediate aim is to
 exert enough influence in the
 Greek elections scheduled for
 February to seat a left-of-
 center  government in Athens
 that would agree to closer ties
 with the bloc.
 The Greek foreign minister
 claims that the USSR is giving
 financial assistance to leftist
 candidates.   As a result of
 continuing tensions with the
 British over the Cyprus issue
 and the current rift in Greek
 Turkish relations, some party
 leaders--chiefly Venizelos,
 leader of the Liberal Democratic
 Union--are under strong pres-
 sure from their following to
 form a popular front with the
 Communist-dominated EDA party.
 Such .a merger would seriously
 damage pro-Western Prime Min-
 ister Karamanlis'  election
 prospects and make the election
 of a "neutralist'"-oriented
 government a strong possibility

 five-year plans to be spelled
 out in detail, was presented
 at the congress.         Like the
 first plan,  it emphasizes
 capital goods production and
 also calls for a sharp increase
 in agricultural collectiviza-
 tion.
 Party First Secretary
 Gheorghiu-Dej announced that
 the party would resume admis-
 sions of new members, primarily
 from the working class.   He
 revealed that party strength
 totaled approximately 595,000,
 a drop of over 100,000 since
 the 1948 congress.
 Party strength in Rumania
 is smaller in proportion to
 the population (one to 29)
 than in the Soviet Union or
 any other European Satellite
 except Albania.
 The enlarged central com-
 mittee and politburo maintain
 the party hierarchy without
 major alteration.   Despite the
 congress' lip service to "col-
 lective leadership," the polit-
 buro membership was again
 listed in order of precedence,
 with Gheorghiu-Dej maintaining
 his predominant position, other
 members following in exact pre-
 congress order.
 In part inspired by the
 recent release of former non-
 Communist political.leaders,  it
 had been rumored that the party
 base would be broadened or
 that puppet minority parties
 would be established. However,
 of an estimated 14 Social Demo-
 crats who received full or
 candidate membership on the
 central committee at the time
 of the merger of the Socialist
 and Communist Parties in Feb-
 ruary 1948, only seven remain.
 Rumania's Second Five-Year
 Plan directives in general re-
 flect the expected emphasis on
 expansion of the means of pro-
 duction.   The plan calls for
 a rise from 71 percent in 1955
 to 85 percent in 1960 in the
 percentage of national income
 derived from the socialist
 sector; for an over-all in-
 crease in industrial output
 of 60 to 65 percent,  including
 a 70-75 percent increase in
 capital goods; and for a 50-55
 percent increase in consumer
 goods.   Total planned invest-
 ments will rise sharply in the
 next five years.
 Gheorghiu-Dej asserted that
 socialization of agriculture
 was essential for expanded ag-
 ricultural production, and he
 called for greater efforts to-
 ward political education of the
 peasant.   He maintained that
 while only 26.5 percent of
 arable land had been collecti-
 vized through 1955, by 1960 the
 collectivized sector of agricul-
 ture must control a predominant
 amount of farm acreage and pro-
 duce 60 to 70 percent of total
 agricultural production.
 It is expected that other
 Satellite plans to be announced
 shortly will follow the same
 general principles in economic
 planning, including emphasis
 on the expansion of capital
 goods, particularly in those
 branches of heavy industry
 which have an assured source
 of supply of raw materials.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 January 1956
 If Austria's two coalition
 parties cannot resolve the cur-
 rent deadlock on economic is-
 sues,            they may agree to advance
 the date of the elections which
 had been tentatively scheduled
 for October.   Neither party can
 now govern without the other.
 The People's Party and the
 Socialists are deadlocked pri-
 marily over the future of in-
 dustrial assets in Austria for-
 merly held by the USSR.   Tech-
 nically the dispute is over
 which ministry shall administer
 these assets but actually it is
 over whether they are to be
 nationalized or returned to
 private ownership.
 This basic controversy be-
 came acute in October when the
 USSR tentatively offered to
 loan $30,000,000 in Austrian
 shilli.nps to the Lower Austrian
 provincial government, which is
 dominated by the People's Party.
 Politicians of that party in
 Vienna,  including Chancellor
 Raab,  favored acceptance of the
 loan in the belief that it would
 facilitate government invest-
 ment in the economically de-
 pressed areas of the former So-
 viet zone, of which Lower Aus-
 tria is a part.
 Socialist leaders--who
 knew nothing of the loan until
 the lower Austrian government
 asked the federal government
 to approve and guarantee it--
 bitterly oppose it, partly be-
 cause of the opportunity the
 loan affords for Soviet economic
 penetration.   Furthermore, they
 alleged that the People's Party
 North Korea
 The North Korean assembly
 from 20-22 December enacted a
 broad legislative program to
 counter widespread apathy to-
 ward the economic development
 program of the regime and toward
 would attempt to use the loan
 to turn over the disputed as-
 sets to private interests.   The
 Socialists, who operate much of
 the country's oil industry
 through their control of the
 Ministry of National Industries,
 favor permanent nationalization
 of the properties.
 Chancellor Raab has been
 unsuccessful to date in obtain-
 ing a federal guarantee of the
 loan.   It is possible, however,
 as predicted:by Minister of
 Finance Kamitz,  that the USSR
 will offer to proceed without
 a guarantee,  in which case the
 loan would become a major elec-
 tion issue.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 January 1956
 The law reducing the grain
 tax, which permits further cuts
 in the event of natural dis-
 asters,  is to be implemented
 immediately.   Although an ad-
 ditional grain tax reduction of
 five percent is to be offered
 as an incentive to peasants who
 join co-operatives, this con-
 cession is unlikely to attract
 many additional farmers as the
 grain tax has proven difficult
 to administer and in some
 cases peasants outside the co-
 operative movement have been
 able to avoid payment of the
 agricultural tax-in-kind.
 The goal for grain pro-
 duction in 1956, the final
 year of the current three-year
 plan,  has been lowered from
 3,200,000 tons to a more real-
 istic 'target of:?730,00CD   It is
 to be met by rehabilitation of
 fallow land and by expansion of
 co-operatives through incentives,
 rather than by increased yield
 quotas on existing acreage.
 Minister of Agriculture Kim I1
 stated during the assembly
 session that the acceleration
 of industrial development was
 dependent on the fulfillment of
 Communist China Challenges
 R nee Line
 Peiping radio's declara-
 tion of 27 December that the
 Chinese people would protect
 the rights of fishermen of all
 nations on the high seas in-
 creases the possibility of
 further incidents between the
 South Korean coast guard and
 the Chinese Communists in the
 Yellow Sea fishing grounds.
 The declaration amounts to an
 informal offer to protect Jap-
 anese fishermen against South
 Korean interference on the high
 seas within the "Rhee line."
 Further serious incidents
 could create new difficulties
 agricultural goals, but it is
 not clear whether the announced
 increased investment in the
 agrarian economy will involve
 a reduction of industrial goals.
 The assembly reduced taxes
 on the income of office and
 factory workers by 30 percent,
 and taxes on the incomes of
 "handicraftsmen, entrepreneurs
 and merchants" by 20 to 25 per-
 cent.   These reductions for
 nonagricultural workers may
 represent an inexpensive means
 of improving civilian morale,
 since statistics released by
 the Ministry of Finance indicate
 that only 9.3 percent of North
 Korea's revenue for 1955 was
 expected to come from income
 taxes.
 It is probable that Pyong.-
 yang will continue to emphasize
 industrial rehabilitation to the
 greatest extent practical, and
 that its eventual role in the
 bloc economy is envisaged as
 that of a producer of manufac-
 tured goods and electric.nawer
 in South Korea's relations with
 the UN Command, particularly
 if Rhee were to try to employ
 his regular naval and air
 forces without approval of the
 UN commander.   According to the
 terms of South Korea's aid
 agreement with the United States,
 its military forces, except for
 the coast guard, are under the
 operational control of the UN.
 They therefore are unavailable
 to enforce Rhee's unilateral
 claim to exclusive fishing
 rights in waters extending
 from 60 to 200 miles offshore.
 The present situation was
 precipitated by a clash  on

 elements in South Vietnam.
 Principal opposition stems
 from the loyal Cao Dai and
 Hoa Hao political forces, which
 are reluctant to accept the
 onus of an "opposition" label.
 They prefer inclusion on the
 government ticket,  from which
 position they aspire to gain
 control of a third of the
 assembly seats.
 The National Revolutionary
 Movement (NRM), the nucleus of
 the government's political
 support, is extending its
 organizational activities into
 traditional Cao Dai and Hoa
 Cambodia
 Prince Sihanouk has tem-
 porarily given up his post as
 prime minister "in order to
 take a rest from his official
 duties."  He has turned over
 the office temporarily to Oum
 Cheang Sun, president of the
 National Assembly.   Sihanouk
 intends to spend a month in
 France and may also visit
 London; he will probably take
 over again as prime minister
 after his father's coronation
 in early March.
 A struggle for power
 broke out among second-echelon
 leaders of the prince's po-
 litical movement, the Sangkum,
 when he announced his impending
 resignation.   Although Oum is
 apparently Sihanouk's choice,
 it is probable that the strug-
 gle will continue, possibly
 resulting in serious disunity
 within the movement.
 At the Sangkum congress on
 30 December, which voted unani-
 mously to accept continued
 American military and economic
 aid,, Sihanouk referred to an
 Hao areas.   A senior NRM leader
 reports considerable success
 in winning over rank-and-file
 sect members,, especially in the
 Hoa Hao areas of western Viet-
 nam, where a large number of
 persons are reported to have
 recently declared themselves
 active NRM partisans.   Sect
 leaders who have remained
 loyal to the government are
 apparently being deliberately
 bypassed in this recruitment
 drive, and there is growing
 resentment among them over

 overture from the USSR for the
 opening of diplomatic relations.
 This follows recent Viet Minh
 approaches for the exchange of
 diplomatic representatives,
 and there are indications that,
 at least as far as the Soviet
 overture is concerned, Cambodia
 is increasingly receptive.   A
 Cambodian radio commentary on
 17 December said the Soviet
 stand on UN admissions would
 encourage the initiation of
 diplomatic relations.
 Meanwhile, relations be-
 tween Cambodia and South Viet-
 nam are strained.   The Cambodian
 government recently protested
 border violations by Vietnamese
 military units and warned that
 it would use its armed forces
 to ensure respect for its ter

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 January 1956
 Laos
 Latest returns from the
 25 December elections show
 Prime Minister Katay's Progres-
 sive Party considerably strength-
 ened and the Independent Party,
 the second member in the coali-
 tion government, somewhat
 weakened.   Katay may drop the
 Independents and form a new
 government with the support of
 minority parties, including the
 small National Union Party,
 headed by the anti-American
 Bong Souvannouvong.
 Katay has not yet commit-
 ted himself, but in a conversa-
 tion with an American official
 has pointed out that there are
 enough Progressive and "friend-
 ly" deputies to provide the
 necessary two-thirds assembly
 approval for a new cabinet.
 Meanwhile, in a gesture
 which Ambassador Yost describes
 as "at least curious," the
 Finnish Presidential Election
 Finland goes to the polls
 on 16 and 17 January to select
 300 presidential electors.
 Since no single political party
 is expected to win a majority
 of electors, considerable maneu-
 vering will probably precede the
 actual selection of the presi-
 dent on 15 February.   The
 chances of any but a candidate
 sympathetic to the West being
 elected are slim, and any new
 president. will probably seek
 to strengthen the country's
 relations with the West while
 still recognizing the necessity
 of maintaining good relations
 with the Soviet Union.
 The two strongest candi-
 dates at present are Prime
 Minister Kekkonen of the Agrar-
 ian Party and K. A. Fagerholm
 of Finland's largest party, the
 Viet Minh has sent a message
 through the International
 Control Commission contratulat-
 ing Laos on its admission to
 the United Nations.   This comes
 at a time when the Viet Minh
 radio is violently attacking
 the royal government for
 carrying out "illegal unilat-
 eral" elections.
 The congratulatory message
 may be intended to promote con-
 fusion among Laotian leaders
 as to the government's policy
 toward the Communists or to
 underscore Russia's role in
 the success of the Laotian bid
 for UN membership.   It is
 possible, however,  that the
 Viet Minh is laying the ground-
 work for a campaign for the ex
 change of,diplomatic representa-
 tives and a deal in which
 Pathet Lao forces would be dis-
 banded in return for Communist
 Participation in the gay ernment.
 Social Democrats.   Kekkonen's
 attempts to consolidate his posi-
 tion as President Paasikivi's
 logical successor have been
 handicapped by the belief of
 many Finns that he is "too
 acceptable" to the Soviet Union
 to be trusted with the presiden-
 cy, which under the constitution
 is entrusted with the direction
 of foreign policy.   In actual
 fact, Kekkonen if elected would
 be unlikely to change Finland's
 foreign policy.
 Fagerholm, although not the
 strongest or most popular member
 of the Social Democratic Party',
 has considerable support in non-
 Socialist circles, but two of
 the three "bourgeois" parties
 have already announced they will
 support him in the electoral

 candidates' chances appear to
 be slight.
 If a deadlock developed in
 the electoral college between
 Kekkonen and Fagerholm, the
 electors would turn to the 85-
 year-old President Paasikivi
 or one of the "bourgeois" party
 nominees for a compromise
 candidate.   Paasikivi has not
 yet definitely stated whether
 he would be a candidate, but
 he reportedly would agree to
 run again if a majority of the
 parties favor him.   His popular-
 ity and prestige remain high,
 and he would probably receive
 the support of a large majority
 of electors if he chose to run
 for a full or shortened term.
 All non-Communist candi-
 dates agree that Finland must
 continue to maintain and
 develop good relations with
 the Soviet Union and remain
 outside great power conflicts.
 The election of Paasikivi,
 Fagerholm or one of the
 "bourgeois" party candidates,
 however, would assure the
 continued development of strong
 ties between Finland and its
 Scandinavian neighbors, espe-
 cially Sweden, and would
 strengthen the country's general
 Western orientation.
 President Paasikivi rather
 than Prime Minister Kekkonen
 appears to have reaped the
 credit for the Soviet-Finnish
 agreement last September which
 returned the Porkkala naval
 base to Finland.   Because actual
 turnover of the base is
 scheduled to take place before
 the end of January, the occasion
 will serve to remind the elec-
 tors of further dividends which
 might accrue from a continuation
 of the policy consistently          25X1
 followed by Paasikivi, with
 which Kekkonen has sought to
 identify himself.

 5 January 1956
 Chilean labor has called
 a general strike for 9 January
 in protest against the Ibanez
 administration's bill to control
 wages and freeze prices.         The
 15,000 copper workers, who
 stopped work on 14 December in
 a separate dispute, have for the
 most part agreed to return to
 work.
 Chile's largest labor con-
 federation, CUTCH, had been
 discussing strike plans for
 several days.  A split within
 CUTCH over strike tactics had
 been reported.   One group  was
 said to favor a general strike
 of indefinite duration.  Another
 group, including the Communists,
 favors only a 48-hour general
 strike.   The Communist leaders
 fear repressive action by the
 government and are reported
 ready to engage in strike-
 breaking even at the risk
 of splitting CUTCH--rather than
 embark on a strike of indefinite
 duration.
 The administration's
 wage-price bill, which has been
 opposed consistently by the
 leftist political parties as
 well as CUTCH, was passed by
 the Senate on 4 January after
 being approved by the Chamber
 of Deputies last month.
 Even if the wage-price
 bill should fail to become a
 law, which seems unlikely,
 labor unrest could be expected
 to continue until some means
 are found to control inflation.
 The cost of living in Chile has
 increased about 200 percent
 in the past two years.

 Power in the Chinese Com-
 munist military structure   ap-
 pears to be passing from China's
 old revolutionary heroes, as
 exemplified  by  Chu Teh, to a
 group of somewhat younger and
 lesser known generals under
 the aegis of Defense Minister
 Peng Teh-huai.  This group
 could play a significant or even
 critical role in any struggle
 for power following Mao Tse-
 tung's death or retirement.
 Army Leaders Named Marshal
 Ten army leaders named in
 1955 as marshals have been
 the regime's top commanders for
 the past 25 years or more.   Chu
 Teh, prior to late 1954, was
 commander in chief of all Chi-
 nese Communist forces and, with
 Mao, was coleader of the first
 Chinese Communist armies.   His
 principal lieutenant was Peng
 Teh-huai, who also commanded
 the Chinese forcesin Korea.and
 was appointed to his present
 position in September 1954.
 On a level with Peng within the
 military hierarchy was Lin Piao,
 who in recent years has been
 described as sick by Peiping.
 Liu Po-cheng  (the one-
 Eyed Dragon), Ho Lung (a re-
 formed bandit), Chen I, Lo
 Jung-huan, Hsu Hsiang-chien
 (also believed sick), Nieh
 Jung-chen and Yeh Chien-ying
 held top command posts in the
 Chinese Communist military.
 With the exception of Peng
 and possibly Chen I, however,
 none is now believed to hold a
 key military post.   Although
 their party positions and
 National Defense Council jobs
 may enable them to influence
 some aspects of policy and
 although several are directors
 of departments of the general
 staff, none has been associated
 since 1954 with an operational
 command.   The title of marshal
 seems to be little more than
 recognition for past services.
 Almost all of the marshals
 seem to have been victims of
 Peiping's efforts since 1952
 to subordinate the armed forces
 more directly to central au-
 thority.   In 1954 the regime
 eliminated regional "kingdoms"
 and transferred the old com-
 manders to Peiping.   The new
 constitution adopted in Sep-
 tember 1954 brought the mili-
 tary completely under govern-
 ment organs for the first time
 and Peng was made the active
 commander of all Chinese forces
 and, apparently, the main
 source of orders to operational
 commands.
 Subsequent legislation
 establishing a Soviet-type
 military rank system and a com-
 pulsory military service pro-
 gram seems designed in part
 to destroy any traces of per-
 sonal loyalty such as existed
 under the former system,  where-
 by a commander served concur-
 rently as government or party
 boss and recruited troops from
 his own military area.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 January 1956
 The stronger central author-
 ity  in                    Peiping and the ensu=ing legislation have also been
 aimed at modernization of the
 military establishment--an ob-
 jective which Peiping has taken
 pains to emphasize.
 Peng Teh-huai Plays Key Role
 The new group around
 Defense Minister Peng, chiefly
 his deputies in the Ministry
 .of National Defense and its sub-
 ordinate organ, the General
 Staff of the People's Libera-
 tion Army, are five or six
 years younger on the average
 than the marshal group.   Some
 of the younger men can boast,
 however, of comparable experi-
 ence, if not rank, in China's
 revolutionary movements.
 Peng appears to have
 brought military leaders loyal.
 to himself into this group,
 which could become important
 either as an independent center
 contesting for power or as sup-
 port for a candidate other than
 Peng.
 Chou En-lai, for example,
 is believed to have close
 connections with the military,
 not only because of his formal
 supervision of the military as
 head of the government admini-
 stration but also through per-
 sonal relationships.
 Peng's seven deputies in
 the National Defense Ministry
 are all party members and three
 are members of the Chinese
 Communist Party's central com-
 mittee.   One served under Peng
 in Korea as chief of staff
 of the Chinese People's Volun-
 teers and another was Peng's
 deputy in Northwest China.
 Three others were born in Peng'E
 native province of Hunan and
 may have become associated with
 Peng long ago.
 Su Yu Heads General Staff
 The General Staff is head-
 ed by General Su Yu, who al-
 though outranked by the marshals,
 probably now stands next to Peng
 Teh-huai as the most powerful
 figure in the Chinese Communist
 military establishment.   The
 chief functions of this staff
 are to advise the minister and,
 in his name, to issue orders
 and to implement directives.
 The departments under the Gen-
 eral Staff--political, training,
 cadre, supervision, rear serv-
 ices                                                      and finance--perform im-
 portant administrative functions
 but for the most part do not
 seem to be power positions.
 SU-YU
 Su Yu and his four assist-
 ants  are all Chinese Communist
 Party members; three are members
 of the party's central committee.
 Su and two of his deputies were
 born in Hunan, and one served as
 Peng's deputy commander in the
 1st Field Army. One of the deputy
 chiefs of staff, .Li Ko-nung, may
 be head of the secret police ap-
 paratus in the armed forces.

 a marshal and the director of
 the army's political department
 --highlights the party's con-
 tinuing concern over maintain-
 ing its control of the military
 and its determination to elim-
 inate any threats to its con-
 trol.  Lo complained of a grow-
 ing tendency to weaken the
 "glorious traditions" of the
 army, particularly the party's
 leadership of the military,
 a principle which Mao had es-
 tablished in the first years
 of the Chinese Communist armies.
 The Chinese Communist
 Party has disclosed that Kao
 Kang and Jao Shu-shih, Chinese
 Communist leaders whose purge
 was announced in March 1955,
 had made overtures to high-
 ranking party members in the
 army for support in their
 "antiparty" alliance..  The ex-
 tent to which military leaders
 became involved with Kao is
 not known, and the party has
 not announced any purge of the
 military.   However, the party's
 admission that a dissident
 faction wished to conclude an
 alliance with the military re-
 flects a continuing problem
 for those who wish to succeed
 Mao as the head of the Chinese
 Communist Party and regime.
 COMMUNISTS SEEKING TO RECOUP LABOR LOSSES IN ITALY
 After suffering several
 serious defeats in the past
 year, the Communist-controlled
 Italian General Confederation
 of Labor (CGIL) is attempting
 to regain its dominant position
 among organized labor.   Its non-
 political campaign in support
 of higher wages has had some
 success among government employ-
 ees, nearly all of whom are dis-
 satisfied with the size of pay
 raises recently announced un-
 ?der the terms of a 1954 law.
 The CGIL's program for
 agitation on economic issues
 was endorsed on 28 November by
 Italian Communist Party chief
 Togliatti.   It probably will
 remain in force at least until
 the confederation's Congress
 convenes in February.   The
 program may well have some
 success in reversing the CGIL's

 Election Setbacks
 Although the CGIL still
 has over 3,000,000 members and
 is larger than all the other
 unions combined, it has had a
 number of setbacks in 1955.
 In shop steward elections,
 Communist-affiliated unions have
 suffered losses averaging about
 12 percent.   In many plants,
 most notably the Fiat automo-
 tive works, they dropped to a
 minority status, and their
 majority has been cut in other
 industries, particularly trans-
 portation and shipbuilding.
 The losses were the result
 in part of.anti-Communist action
 by firms seeking to meet Amer-
 ican requirements for loans or
 offshore procurement contracts
 and hence in some cases may
 prove to be temporary.   How-
 ever, the losses also reflect
 stepped-up activity by non-.
 Communist unions, and a greater

 willingness on the part of
 management to sign separate
 agreements with these unions.
 The CGIL's strike record
 in 1955 was unimpressive.   It
 called no strikes of a purely
 political nature, not even on
 the likely occasions of parlia-
 ment's approval of the Western
 European Union and the redeploy-
 ment to Italy of American troops
 formerly stationed in Austria.
 Moreover, support for CGIL-
 called sympathy strikes fell
 off markedly.   The port strike
 in Genoa,  which lasted from
 January to May, was the only
 major strike the Communists
 conducted alone,   It put a heavy
 strain on the union's resources
 and won the Communists a de-
 cision which only barely con-
 cealed the fact that their con-
 trol over hiring and firing of
 ship repair workers had been
 eliminated.
 Defections from CGIL,  which
 have occurred intermittently on
 the local level for several
 years,  have recently assumed
 greater significance.   A part
 of the Federation of Postal and
 Telegraph Employees withdrew
 on 3 December and transferred
 its allegiance to the Democratic
 Socialist-oriented Italian Labor
 Union.   This followed the defec-
 tion in late summer of two in-
 dividuals who were prominent
 in the CGIL-affiliated national
 organizations of Agricultural
 Workers and Fishermen.
 A number of factors will
 probably contribute to the
 success of CGIL's campaign:
 continuing feuds among the non-
 Communist unions, anger over
 heavy-handed measures taken by
 management in some localities,
 and the limited scope of the
 government's economic reforms.
 Although the non-Communist
 labor organizations are wary
 of "unity of action" campaigns,
 they can be maneuvered into
 co-operating.    On   occasions
 when  both  Communist  and non-
 Communist                                                                    unions  have called

 BRITAIN ACTIVELY OPPOSES EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROPOSALS
 Leaders of the European

 opposition in recent weeks to
 the European atomic energy
 community and the plans for a
 customs union which the Inter-
 governmental Committee on Euro-
 pean Integration will present
 to the six Coal-Steel Community
 countries early this year.
 While they had not hoped
 for    British  participation,
 integration leaders expected
 London would refrain from op-
 posing the projects and might
 even support them during the
 difficult negotiating period--
 perhaps ultimately seeking ties
 along the lines of Britain's

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 January 1956
 European Economic Co-operation
 (OEEC), London has made it clear
 that (1) it will not extend to
 the nuclear pool (EURATOM) as
 such the benefits which its
 members could derive individu-
 ally in bilateral agreements
 with Britain;  and (2)  it may
 work against the formation of
 the six-nation customs union
 by using its influence in the
 several CSC countries, and
 through the OEEC and the Gener-
 al Agreement on Tariffs and
 Trade (GATT).
 Explaining his govern-
 ment's position, the British
 foreign secretary told Secretary
 Dulles in mid-December that
 "tight integration" of the
 Community of Six implies high
 tariffs which would be a source
 of "division rather than
 strength" on the Continent and
 that while London otherwise
 'would .iot be unsympathetic, "
 Britain desires to "avoid fu-
 ture opprobrium" by announcing
 its intentions now.
 Early in December, another
 British spokesman said he fore-
 saw the "danger of dividing
 free Europe into two camps" and
 the possibility that the OEEC
 would "collapse" as a result of
 the "formation  of discriminato-
 ry groups."
 Pro-European Views
 Pro-Europeans are both
 annoyed and alarmed by the
 British action.  Belgian foreign
 minister Spaak contends that
 London has launched a "strong
 offensive" against the common
 market concept, and is "unfavor-
 able,  even aggressively  un-
 favorable" in its attitudes.
 Dutch co-foreign minister Beyen
 reportedly believes he has been
 "led up a garden path" and,  with
 Spaak,  suspects the British are
 opposing the projects now be-
 cause there is a chance of their
 being approved.   CSC president
 Mayer speaks of a German "tor-
 pedo," and West German foreign
 minister Von Brentano has told
 Secretary Dulles that British
 opposition had "created real
 difficulties" in West Germany
 for European integration pros-
 pects.
 The emotional tone of these
 statements is in part a hangover
 from the EDC crisis.   Many pro-
 Europeans suspect that London
 was not entirely displeased
 with the defeat of EDC, and
 it is still following its his-
 toric policy of opposing the
 emergence of a concentration
 of power on the Continent.
 Spaak notes,  for instance,  the
 unreasonableness of Britain's
 objection to the common market
 on the basis of discrimination
 in view of Britain's involve-
 ment in intra-Commonwealth
 tariff preferences.
 Effect of British Stand
 Basically, however, pro-
 Europeans are alarmed lest the
 British position spells failure
 for the integration  projects
 in question.
 Integration measures are
 strongly supported in the
 Benelux countries but command,
 at best, an uncertain majority
 in France and West Germany.
 Any British doubts in the matter
 can be expected to reappear
 as arguments among the opposi-
 tion.  Also, by supporting in-
 stead the looser OEEC inter-
 governmental  approach, the
 British encourage those, too,
 who are not opposed to integra-
 tion as such but who dislike
 the political and economic im-
 plications of the more drastic
 CSC formula.
 Some of the potential
 candidates for membership in
 the European community, such as
 Switzerland and Norway, sympa-
 thize with Britain.   Since the
 establishment of a European
 common market would require
 another waiver from the OEEC
 and GATT , a practical problem
 immediately presents itself.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 January
 The anger at Britain being
 felt, particularly in the Low
 Countries, reflects the politi-
 calovertones which have always
 been implicit in the support
 these countries have given to
 the European movement.   In his
 conversations with Secretary
 Dulles on 17 December,  Spaak
 spoke "feelingly" of the need
 for "giving the Germans hope,"
 of the overriding importance of
 tying Bonn to the West,  and of
 the danger that West Germany
 will turn to the USSR.   The
 British position,  Spaak insists,
 is shortsighted at best "in
 terms of what the situation
 could be in Germany in five
 years if the present opportuni-
 ties are missed."
 The possibility of a bi-
 lateral understanding between
 France and Germany--which was
 raised during the tenure of Men-
 des-France--has also not been
 entirely discarded.   Among the
 smaller countries there is still
 a good deal of feeling that the
 present moment offers a new
 chance and possibly the last
 chance for a permanent recon-
 ciliation of France and Germany
 in a framework in which the other
 European countries would still
 have a voice.                       25X1
 INDIAN LINGUISTIC STATES ISSUE
 India's most critical do-
 mestic political problem--the
 linguistic states issue--has
 again defied efforts by the
 Congress Party to reach a sat-
 isfactory solution.   This failure
 damages the prestige of the gov-
 erning party's high command,
 which had hoped to announce a
 final decision on 24 December.
 Home Minister Pant has stated
 it will now be impossible to
 accomplish the tasks necessary
 to establish all the new states
 on 1 October 1956 as earlier
 planned. It also indicates that
 the party may enter the national
 election campaign in late 1956
 with less internal unity and
 stronger external opposition
 than it previously anticipated.
 Some Congress Party and
 government leaders, including
 Prime Minister Nehru, have pri.-
 vately opposed the idea of di-
 viding India along linguistic
 lines.   Popular demand, however,
 forced the government to appoint
 a States Reorganization Commis-
 sion to study the problem.   The
 commission last October sub-
 mitted recommendations which
 included enlargement of Bombay
 state to take in parts of
 Hyderabad and Saurashtra.   It
 also recommended unification of
 the Punjab,  Himachal Pradesh,
 and Patiala and East Punjab
 States Union (PEPSU)  into a
 single state.
 The Congress high command
 subsequently decided that Bom-
 bay should be divided into three
 separate states--Bombay city,
 a southern Mahratti-speaking
 state, and a northern Gujrati-
 speaking state.   It also sug-
 gested further discussion about
 the Punjab area, where the Sikhs
 have long agitated for a state
 entirely for themselves.
 Provincial Reaction
 Violent rioting in Bombay
 during late November,  unrest in
 other parts of the country, and
 dissension in the Punjab area
 over the new proposals led to
 talks between New Delhi repre-
 sentatives and provincial leaders
 and to debates in parliament,
 which the Congress Party and tile
 government hoped to conclude
 satisfactorily by 24 December.
 On  the  24th, however,   the
 party admitted defeat by deciding
 to remand the matter to a four'-
 -man subcommittee,  while Prime

 Minister Nehru told the upper
 house of parliament that the
 government would assume the
 burden of further study and
 decision.
 At the moment, no settle-
 ment is in sight.   On 21 Decem-
 ber, Nehru indicated his con-
 tinuing private opposition to
 the idea of linguistic states
 and opened a whole new line of
 discussion by stating that in

 the long run he favored divid-

 in Congress Party ranks led

 of one of his deputy ministers

 In the Punjab, where the
 Congress Party leadership is
 not strong, dissension between
 Hindu and Sikh elements threat-
 ens to result in the ouster of
 Chief Minister Bhim Sen Sachar,'

 inside and outside India's Con-

 the government will be able to
