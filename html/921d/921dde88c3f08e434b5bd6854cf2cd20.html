 _        _            'T7 February 1961
 Briefly Noted
 1.  On March 7 the UNGA will reconveyie to take up manjr items left over
 from the 1960 Agenda plus a bewildering confusion of affairs in the crises areas
 of the world.  Despite the fact that Gromyko, rather than Khrushchev, will head
 the USSR delegation at the opening, 'we can expect and should be prepared for
 fireworks on all the familiar subjects.,
 2.  The trial of Adolf Eichmann is now scheduled to begin in the next
 few weeks. While we should, of course, in no way condone the Nazi era in
 Germany we must keep in mind the inevitable use which the Soviets will attempt
 to make of the occasion to smear the present West German government and its
 officials, particularly Chancellor Adenauer.
 3.  A recent (23 February) characteristic speech by Premier Khrushchev
 contained two claims which deserve further comment:
 a.  Khrushchev said that when the U. S. made the first atom
 bomb, "The United States Imperialists began to carry out an atomic
 policy of intimidating the Socialist countries and primarily the Soviet
 Union. It was a difficult time for us. " Soviet nervousness from 1945
 to 1949 (first Soviet A-bomb explosion) is perhaps understandable,
 considering their paranoid belief that the rest of the world was encircling
 them. But we would be interested to hear of any concrete cases during
 that time when the U. S. followed a policy of trying to intimidate the USSR
 with atomic weapons. Our recollection is that it was during that period
 that the U. S. offered, in the Morgenthau Plan, to hand over all its
 atomic materials to an international authority, ' provided that the
 authority should have an effective inspection and control system.
 b.  Khrushchev said that when the U. S. "Imperialists" began to
 talk of producing a hydrogen bomb, Soviet scientists "as the saying
 goes, put that in their pie, wound it around their whiskers, worked a
 bit, and created the hydrogen bomb before it was invented in the United-_
 States. " It is true that there was some delay in going ahead on an Amer-
 ican hydrogen bomb; President Truman did not authorize going ahead
 until 31 January 1950, four months after the explosion of the first Soviet
 A-bomb ended hopes of avoiding an atomic arms race. But the first
 thermonuclear (hydrogen) explosion by the U. S. took place on 16 November
 1952, and Malenkov first claimed that the Soviet Union possessed a
 thermonuclear capability on 9 August 1953. Perhaps Khrushchev will say
 that his old rival was hiding the Soviet light under a bushel, and that
 there were actually Soviet thermonuclear explosions at an earlier date.
 But this raises an interesting point: Malenkov's announcement followed
 the signature of the armistice in Korea by 13 days; had the Soviets
 possessed a thermonuclear capability during the Korean negotiations,
 and particularly had they had it before the U. S. ex losio  in November

 1952, they probably would have used it as a threat in support of the
 Communist negotiators at Pannunjorn.  Can it be that the USSR
 deliberately concealed its power to avoid having the Chinese call for
 using it as a bargaining weapon?????

 354.  The USSR Against the UN
 its efforts to neutralize the UN, the USSR has, from the opening day of the 15th
 General Assembly in September until the death of Lumumba, followed a
 calculated plan of action, denouncing and denigrating the efforts of the UN, with
 particular reference to the Congo, and vilifying its Secretary General, Dag
 Hammerskjold. It has used its veto to render UN action ineffective. It has
 encouraged Afro-Asian countries to vote against resolute UN action.  It has even
 taken the unprecedented step of declaring the Secretary General persona non grata
 and refused to deal with him.  It has refused to pay its fair share of UN expenses.
 At the same time, it has demanded a vast increase in Soviet nationals to be
 employed in the UN Staff. It has, in short, attempted in every possible way to
 render the UN ineffective, to emasculate the Secretariat, and to hold the UN and
 its supporters xp to ridicule and contempt.
 In the light of this pattern of action and intention, it is most significant
 that the Security Council, in the early hours of 21 February, rejected by a vote
 of 8 to 1 a Soviet resolution calling for Hammerskjold's ouster and demanding UN
 withdrawal from the Congo, and immediately thereafter adopted by a vote of
 9 to 0, with two abstentions (USSR and France), a resolution sponsored by Ceylon,
 Liberia and the UAR, calling for: (1) strong condemnation of unlawful arrests,
 deportations and assassination of political leaders in the Congo; (2) demanding
 immediate cessation of such practices; (3) directing the UN to take all possible
 steps, including the use of force as a last resort to prevent further occurrence of
 such practices; and (4) authorizing an investigation to determine responsibility
 and punishment for the perpetrators.
 Although the latter resolution did not specifically refer to the Secretary
 General, Ambassador Stevenson pointed out that its clear implication supported
 Hammerskjold by placing responsibility for implementation in his hands and by
 reaffirming the previous Security Council and General Assembly resolutions
 which rest responsibility with the Secretary General. It is significant to note
 that, despite its long and vicious campaign against further UN action in the Congo,
 the USSR did not dare risk a veto and merely abstained.

 participation in the Mosul uprising last year, a section of the Baghdad Press
 countered by attacking Radio Moscow in turn for interfering in internal IraW
 affairs. Al Ahd Jadid and Al Mustaqbal criticized the Swedish Communist Party
 for sendincablegram to  asim for defending the "anarchists, 11 extolling the
 crime and trampling law under foot. The pro-Qasirn newspapers said, of Radio
 Moscow: "Let the Soviet Radio know that we are free in combating anarchy and
 anarchism without mercy in the internal field. Every one of us is free to conduct
 his own,affairs in accordance with his particular social system. We ask the
 friendly Soviet Radio: did its commentators listen to Baghdad Radio? did (it)
 hear any attacks against (the) internal situation in Moscow ? we still do not
 believe that Moscow Radio does not understand general conditions in our country,
 the dastardly crimes committed by anarchists and terrible bloody plans prepared
 by 'comrades' in dark cells. We believe that Radio Moscow understands this as
 well as the just sentences passed by court martial on the bloody butchers. For
 this reason we reprove it for its recent provocative comments which harm
 friendly relations and mutual interests of the two nations. 11 If not actually cleared
 with Premier Qasim beforehand,. it is virtually certain that the Baghdad Press
 attack was acceptable to Qasim - or it would not have appeared, with the
 publishers being allowed, as they are to continue to function. The attack, which
 began on February 10, has continued and on 14 February these papers were
 joined in the hue and cry by Al Sharq. In an editorial in Al Mustaqbal appearing
 on the latter date, it was stated: 'r hen Communist gangs failed to induce people
 to take a long jump with them, they went berserk and started to kill people
 indiscriminately. 11 On the same day Al Sharq said that it was regrettable that an
 official radio of a friendly nation should stick its nose in the internal affairs of
 Iraq. It added that those who were sincere would not lend an ear to such cheap
 intrigues. Still later (17 February), Al Ahd Jadid added: "All this shows that the
 Communist movement in Iraq is part and parcel of the international Comintern
 which is supposed to be abolished but is still in existence.                      25X1C10b

 mediocre scientific ability, is a disciple of Ivan Michurin, a successful fruit
 breeder with a complete lack of scientific training. Michurinistic biology, as
 interpreted by Lysenko, conformed more closely to dialectic materialism than
 did the classical theories of Mendel and in 1948 it was officially recognized by the
 CPSU. This theory stressed the effect of environment and claimed it saw the
 possibility of inheriting environmentally produced effects. Lysenkoism, as it
 came to be called, was not only more in accord with Marxist-Leninist theories
 but also conformed closely to the theories of Pavlov because it emphasized the
 possibility of transforming plants and animals through environment, thus
 providing a "scientific" basis for the Stalinist hope for the creation of a new
 Soviet man.
 In the last fifteen years of Stalin's life, Lysenko flourished (despite the
 opposition of even some Soviet scientists) as the tsar of Soviet genetics, biology,
 agronomy, and botany. From 1953 - 1957 (after Stalin's death), however,  his
 influence began towane. In 1956 he resigned as head of the All-Union Agricultural
 Academy. But he has for the past few years been staging a comeback. The extent
 of Lysenko's renaissance (perhaps only as a scarecrow) was not known until
 recently when Professor 01shansky, deputy chairman of the All-Union Institute
 and a long-time disciple of Lysenko's, was named Minister of Agriculture to
 replace Vladimir V. Matskevich, a farm specialist from the Ukraine who had
 long been associated with Nikita Khrushchev. The key factor in the situation,
 apparently, is Khru.shchev's insistence upon radically high increases in Soviet
 farm production which, though not as deficient as in Communist China, have
 fallen far short of the oprimistic goals that Khrushchev and his colleagues have
 set. Soviet scientists have, no doubt, been given an opportunity to view Lysenko
 as an example of the fate (like Lysenko's) which awaits them if they do not toe
 the Party line.

 armies in October 1950, and after resisting-unsuccessfully for six months, the
 Tibetan Government was forced to sign a 17-point Agreement with Communist
 China on 23 May 1951. This agreement provided that the existing political system
 in Tibet would not be altered, that the Tibetan people had the right of exercising
 regional autonomy, that in matters pertaining to various reforms in Tibet, there
 would be no compulsion of the part of the Chinese Government and that the local
 government of Tibet should carry out reforms of its own accord.
 Violations of the Sino-Tibetan Agreement started almost immediately and
 continued for eight years, culminating in the action dissolving the local
 government of Tibet. The struggle against engulfment by the Chinese began in
 1952 and culminated in the flight of the Dalai Lama in March 1959. Since the
 occupation of 1950, most of the measures taken to place Tibet directly under
 Peking's control and to make Tibetans embrace communism clearly violated the
 1951 Agreement. Tibetan resistance to Communist China was sparked by the
 Communists' coordinated political and military policy aimed at the communization
 of Tibet.
 While the immediate purpose of the political changes which were forcibly
 imposed by the Chinese was to assure Pekingts absolute control over the regional
 administration, they also had the further objective of setting the stage for a
 comprehensive program of "social" reform which would transform Tibet into an
 integrated, indistinguishable part of the socialized Chinese state. This is
 -wnderstandable when one remembers that, in 1939, Mao Tse-tung laid down the
 claim that scores of national minorities, including the Mongols, the Tibetans, the
 Uighurs, the Koreans and many others, are fundamentally Chinese and belong
 rightfully to China.
 Communist China did not wait long to reveal that the real purpose behind
 the invasion and direct control of Tibet was tc.. use the latter as a
 weapon to carry out her plans for political and territorial expansion. Agents of
 the Chicoms posing as Tibetan refugees, setting out from Tibet, started to
 infiltrate into Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim as a prelude to the eventual penetration
 of the border lands of India itself. Maps published by the Chinese Communist
 Government represent considerable parts of Bi.rma, Bhutan, Nepal and India,
 including portions of Kashmir, as Chinese territory. By the summer of 1959, the
 Chinese Communists had increased the size of their troop concentrations along
 the Indian-Tibetan frontier and there were continuing reports of Chinese
 Communist penetrations of Bhutan, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir
 and along the border of Assam in the north east of India. Finally, the Chinese
 People's Republic officially claimed nearly 40, 000 square miles of Indian
 territory.

 lA0001000 03a 3  ebruary 196 25X1 C10b
 Background:    Karl Marx was a Western European thinker, economist an
 revolutionary, whose ideas were strictly a product of Nineteenth Century
 European industrial and political-ideological developments. Lenin and his
 Russian disciples were broadly products of the same intellectual, social, and
 political background. Nevertheless, the Communists, in extending and promoting
 their influence in Africa, Asia and Latin America, have managed to obscure
 the strictly European origins of their thinking (as well as their material support)
 and identify themselves as purveyors of "native-born", nationalist-sounding
 solutions to the problems of the developing areas. The Chinese Communists are
 aware of the difficulties in promoting a foreign ideology in these regions. In
 their efforts to woo Africans, from the Bandung Conference to their current
 programs, they have stressed that the Chinese are to be counted among the
 "colored" peoples who comprise the vast majority of the world's population.
 A major reason for the success of the Communists is that most of the
 intellectual and political leaders of the developing countries are preoccupied with
 the search for fast working panaceas and, at the same time, predisposed to reject
 suggestions they think they can identify with the European colonial past. For this
 reason, these leaders also tend to reject attempts to describe communism as a
 new colonialism or a new imperialism. For them the terms colonialism and
 imperialism have very specific referents, bringing to their minds arrogant
 overlords of plantations or officious functionaries of some European regime.
 The Communists apparently need only to stress the newness and difference of
 their programs and to label those who call attention to communism's true aims
 and background apologists for the past colonial rulers, to becloud the fact that
 communism is equally foreign and European. Because the former colonial rulers
 were usually anti-Communist, in addition to their other characteristics, the
 Communists' tasks of identifying anti-communism with locally unpopular issues
 is made easier.
 Nevertheless, communism is a foreign, a European ("white") ideology,
 and both Marx and Lenin denigrated the peasant, the mainstay of the societies of
 Asia, Africa and Latin America. Although the Chinese Communists claim to
 have corrected this error and appeal to the developing areas on the basis of their
 having given the peasants a major Irole in their revolution, well-publicized facts
 belie their claims (See Guidance #345). The Communist failure in the agricultural
 sector in both Russia and China is conspicuous (See Guidance #347). Serious
 planning and action programs in developing countries should be based not on the
 adaption of Communist blueprints, but upon the situations that actually obtain
 there.  India's economic program combines, for example, a measure of
 centralized planning and, at the same time, the encouragement of capital
 Cormation and investment by the private sector.
