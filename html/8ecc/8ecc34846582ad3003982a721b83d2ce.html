 Khrushchev,  in his talks with De Gaulle,  failed to
 gain any commitments or concessions which would strengthen
 the Soviet position at the summit.                   In contrast to his ex-
 travagant appraisal of his Asian tour, Khrushchev summed
 up the French visit as "fairly successful," admitting that
 on the major issues French and Soviet views do not "fully
 coincide."  In the final round of private talks, as in the
 initial conversations, Germany remained the fundamental
 point of disagreement.   Although there has been no authori-
 tative Soviet reaction to the Eisenhower-Macmillan sugges-
 tion for unilateral pledges not to test small underground
 nuclear weapons,  the Soviet delegate to the test-ban talks
 has said that formal inclusion of such a moratorium in a

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 SOUTH AFRICA .  . .  .  .    .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The South African Government, alarmed by the effec-
 tivenessof the recent African work stoppage, has intensi-
 fied its campaign of repression.  The stringent provisions
 of the 30 March proclamation of a state of emergency have
 been supplemented by further restrictions on demonstra-
 tions by Africans.  Police are using strong-arm methods in
 POLITICAL CONFLICT THREATENS CENTRAL AFRICA   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 In the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, growing
 African nationalism faces the increasing determination of
 the white minority of 300,000 to retain control.  This
 poses a serious problem for Britain, which shares power
 with the white federal government.  The three-way dispute
 is impeding the orderly evolution toward independence Lon-
 don hopes for.  The situation probably will be aggravated
 by the nationalist agitation of the recently released
 African leader, Dr. Hastings Banda, who will push for
 early self-government in Nyasaland.
 PEIPING'S VIEWS ON "INEVITABILITY" OF WAR   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 3
 The Chinese Communist party,  in the current issue of
 its theoretical journal Red Flag, makes its most categori-
 cal statement thus far that war is not only probable but
 in some cases inevitable as long as imperialism exists.
 The article is clearly aimed at Khrushchev's proposition
 that bloc strength has progressed to a point where the "in-
 evitable war" theory may be put aside in favor of "peace-
 ful competition."  This and recent bitter anti-American
 attacks reflect Peiping's belief that an East-West detente
 would impede its effort to eliminate US influence in Taiwan
 and the Far East. Khrushchev reportedly told bloc leaders
 in Moscow last February that Peiping's refusal to support
 Soviet policies was "harming the cause of international
 communism."
 CHINESE COMMUNISTS LAUNCH NEW DRIVE FOR URBAN COMMUNES .  .   Page 5
 Peiping announced at the National People's Congress
 on 30 March that communes are now being established in
 cities, reviving an aspect of communalization virtually
 ignored since December 1958.  A recent campaign to publi-
 cize the rapid expansion of collectivized living in major

 cities preceded the announcement.  Organizational details
 of the new communes have been left obscure.  Mao Tse-tung
 was present at the congress session, and his authority
 will probably be thrown behind the new drive.
 PEIPING CALLS FOR ANOTHER BIG LEAP FORWARD . .
 Communist China's 1960 economic plan and budget make
 clear the regime's determination to continue to push the
 Chinese economy forward at "big leap" speed, although the
 percentage rate of growth planned for this year is less
 than that claimed for either of the two preceding years.
 China will probably be able to reach the goals set for
 major industrial items, but the agricultural goals--es-
 pecially those for grain and cotton--are far beyond reach.
 Additional resources are being allocated to the develop-
 ment of agriculture this year, although the major share
 will still go to heavy industry.
 DISSENSION AMONG JAPANESE SOCIALISTS .
 Page  6
 .  .  .  .  . Page 9
 A special convention called to reorganize the Japa-
 nese Socialist party in the wake of recent defections by
 one fifth of its Diet members has elected Inejiro Asanuma
 as new party chairman and enabled left-wingers to consoli-
 date their control of the party.   Some middle-of-the-road
 Socialists are expected as a result to join earlier de-
 fectors in the recently formed Democratic Socialist party
 (DSP).  A more far-reaching impact, however, probably will
 be on the Sohyo labor federation, the Socialist party's
 main support.  Moderate elements in many unions may switch
 their support to the DSP.
 THAILAND'S ATTITUDE TOWARD SOVIET BLOC MAY SOFTEN   .  .  .  .   Pagell
 Marshal Sarit, the Thai premier, may be considering
 certain gestures to the Sino-Soviet bloc as a means of
 registering his dissatisfaction with various aspects of

 of the United States in the Bangkok press.                 His reported
 decisions to permit government officials to participate
 in a trade promotion tour of European bloc countries and
 to allow TASS to reopen its office in BangkoK appear to
 be tactics designed to support a bid for greater American
 aid.
 ALGERIAN REBEL ORGANIZATION IN FRANCE   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 12
 The Algerian rebel National Liberation Front (FLN),
 which has suffered serious military setbacks in Algeria,
 retains a disciplined organization in metropolitan France.
 It provides a means of collecting funds and soliciting
 army recruits from among the approximately 275,000 Alge-
 rians in the metropole.   Except for sporadic attempts at
 sabotage, however, the FLN's energy is largely directed
 toward maintaining supremacy over the rival Algerian Na-
 tional Movement (MNA).
 MIKOYAN VISIT TO IRAQ   . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 12
 First Deputy Premier Mikoyan--the highest ranking
 Soviet official ever to visit the Arab world--is heading
 an official delegation to open the Soviet exhibition in
 Baghdad on 8 April.   The visit is probably intended to
 counter recent signs of an improvement in Iraq's rela-
 tions with the West and to induce the Qasim regime to
 soften its attitude toward Iraq's Communists.   Soviet pub-
 licity for the visit suggests that Mikoyan will offer ad-
 ditional economic assistance, apparently in the hope that
 its political impact would restore flagging Iraqi hopes
 concerning quick benefits from bloc aid.
 EAST GERMAN CHURCH-STATE CONFLICT SHARPENS .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 13
 The chronic church-state conflict in East Germany has
 been sharpened by the defiant position of the Evangelical
 Church against the regime's measures to force the peasants
 into collective farms.  The Evangelical Church is under
 pressure to reverse the stand against collectivization its
 bishops took in a letter addressed to Premier Grotewohl
 which was read from pulpits throughout the country.  The
 unity of the East German clergy behind Bishop Otto Dibelius
 in West Berlin has set back party boss Ulbricht's long cam-
 paign to separate the church from its West German ties.

 Pressure continues in Finland to broaden the Agrarian
 government which has ruled since January 1959 with a par-

 Sharpening antagonism between supporters and opponents

 Communist leader of the colony's dominant political party.
 Jagan has threatened to agitate for immediate independence

 April visit to Havana.

 In El Salvador's elections on 24 April President

 the local offices at stake.   Despite the President's popu-
 larity, however, there are signs of dissatisfaction in the
 armed forces and in his own party, and rumors of plotting
 are beginning to circulate.   Small opposition groups sup-
 ported by Communists and sympathizers with Castro's Cuban
 revolution will probably create some election disturbances,

 SINO-SOVIET DOCTRINAL DISPUTES  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page
 Chinese Communist leaders continue to adopt independ-
 ent internal and foreign policies and to put Mao Tse-tung
 forward as the "discoverer" of new doctrines.           In justify-
 ing their unorthodox domestic programs with equally un-
 orthodox doctrinal formulations,                       implying that these could
 be applied elsewhere in the bloc, the Chinese in effect
 challenge the Soviet Union's "pre-eminence" in this field.
 Khrushchev apparently has decided it is time to deal with
 these Chinese claims.   In some bloc countries Mao's author-
 ity in. doctrinal matters appears to be increasing,  and
 Khrushchev will probably find he cannot obliterate it by
 fiat.

 Many of the almost 1,000 foreign students studying
 in the USSR are reportedly dissatisfied with their lot and
 disillusioned with the Soviet way of life.  Reports of dis-
 satisfaction concern chiefly students from the Asian-Afri-
 can underdeveloped countries.  While some have been indoc-
 trinated with a belief in Communism, many appear to resent
 Moscow's efforts to exploit them for propaganda purposes.
 They also resent their enforced isolation, a result of the
 regime's determination to protect Soviet students from
 foreign contamination.  Moscow's plan to establish a spe-
 cial University of People's Friendship for foreign students
 from Asia, Africa, and Latin America will probably increase
 these students' sense of segregation and regimentation.
 WEST GERMANY'S ARMED FORCES   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  10
 The West German military build-up now has reached a
 stage where combat effectiveness will increase rapidly.
 In all three services, most of the planned combat units
 will have been activated by the end of 1961.            By the mid-
 1960s West Germany's army will probably be the strongest
 ground force in Western Europe and its air force a rival
 to France's in tactical air power.  The Adenauer govern-
 ment seems determined to keep its forces integrated with
 NATO, but the pressures Bonn is beginning to exert for
 full equality within NATO raise problems for the alliance.

 In his speech in Moscow
 on 4 April, however, Khrushchev
 implied that De Gaulle had made
 concessions to the Soviet posi-
 tion on a peace treaty.   He
 claimed they had "established
 that there is a basis for work-
 ing out an agreed position" on
 a number of most important
 questions, and he quoted the
 communique on Germany and Ber-
 lin as implicit support for
 this contention.

 talks between
 Khrushchev and De Gaulle and
 the routine communique which
 followed them indicate that the
 Soviet premier failed to gain
 any commitments or concessions
 which would strengthen his po-
 sition at the summit.   In con-
 trast to his extravagant ap-
 praisal of his recent Asian
 tour, Khrushchev,  on his return
 to Moscow summed up the French
 visit as "fairly successful,"
 admitting that on major issues
 French and Soviet views did
 not "fully coincide."
 Khrushchev appears to have
 accepted the concept of pro-
 tracted negotiations on Germany
 and Berlin in agreeing to a
 French proposal for a reference
 in the communique to "progres-
 sive settlement" of these ques-
 tions on a basis "agreed on
 through negotiations."  He fol-
 lowed this up in his  'final
 press conference on 2 April by
 admitting that the conclusion
 of a peace treaty and a Berlin
 solution "demand some time."
 Khrushchev also claimed
 that his
 views
 on
 disarmament
 coincided
 with
 De
 Gaulle's.

 The communique's reference
 to a mutual interest in rein-
 forcing European security may
 provide Khrushchev with an open-
 ing to raise this issue at the
 summit.   In his television ad-
 dress in Paris, Khrushchev spe-
 cifically included European se-
 curity in a list of the most
 important international ques-
 tions, along with disarmament,
 a German. treaty and Berlin,  and
 nuclear testing.
 Khrushchev's public state-
 ments during the final phase of
 his visit and his speech in Mos-
 cow provided further evidence
 that the immediate objective
 for his trip was to maintain a
 favorable pre-summit atmosphere
 and to project an image of So-
 viet reasonableness and flex-
 ibility in meeting Western views
 on key international problems.
 As to the summit meeting,
 he said at a. Soviet Embassy re-
 ception, "Naturally, it is im-
 possible to settle all outstand-
 ing problems in one meeting."
 In his TV address he held out
 the possibility of achieving
 progress "if statesmen take ac-
 count of mutual interests" and
 meet each other half way.   His
 treatment of the possibility
 of a separate peace treaty with
 East Germany was intended to
 convey an impression of extreme
 reluctance to take such action.
 From the outset of his
 visit, however, it was obvious
 that Khrushchev hoped to gener-
 ate popular pressure in France
 for some accommodation to the
 Soviet position on Germany by
 arousing old antagonisms and
 sowing the seeds of suspicion
 of De Gaulle's ally in Bonn.
 He sought to create doubts about
 Germany's reliability by recall-
 ing the Hitler-Stalin pact and
 explaining that diplomacy is a
 "tricky game" in which the par-
 ticipants must understand that
 others can play the "same
 tricks on them."
 He warned French parlia-
 ment members that "West Germany

 might play the same kind of
 trick    Hitler Germany played
 before World War II."  He found
 it "a point to ponder" that,
 although Adenauer attacked the
 USSR in his speeches, Soviet
 trade with Bonn was growing-
 "I would ask our French friends
 to put that under their hat."
 French Reaction
 Ambassador Houghton in
 Paris, in a preliminary esti-
 mate of the Khrushchev visit,
 reports that the degree of Khru-
 shchev's success in generating
 popular fears over Germany is
 not yet clear, but that such
 fears are obviously  latent
 among certain elements and al-
 ready present among anti-Ger-
 man extremists such as Daladier,
 who thanked Khrushchev for re-
 minding the French people of
 the German menace.  Foreign
 Minister Couve de Murville told
 Houghton he believed Khrushchev
 had badly misjudged  French
 feelings about Germany and that
 his remarks had had little if
 any effect on French public
 opinion.
 Houghton feels Khrushchev's
 general circumspection and dig-
 nity and his stress on peace and
 Soviet-French friendship might
 overcome any hesitancy in the
 average citizen against reach-
 ing agreements with the USSR
 because of ideological differ-
 ences.  He thought the French
 Communist party's role in or-
 ganizing mass receptions for
 Khrushchev might hurt the party,
 but estimated that non-Commu-
 nist cooperation with the Com-
 munists on.domestic issues would
 vary with the extent of  the
 East-West detente.
 The French Government took
 the unusual step of justifying
 the Khrushchev visit to the pub-
 lic in a nationwide radio-tele-
 vision dialogue between Premier
 Debrd and Information Minister
 Terrenoire.  Debrd said that
 Khrushchev's television appear-
 ance was required "by the laws
 of hospitality," denied that the
 communiqud was "of meager sub-
 stance," and took special pains
 to explain that the Khrushchev
 visit was a necessary prelude
 to the summit.  Debrd also used
 the opportunity to state that
 France had few illusions about
 the practical results of a sum-
 mit meeting, that France wants
 "absolute priority" on disarma-
 ment, and that an East-West de-
 tente could not be based on
 abandonment of the Western po-
 sition on Germany and Berlin.
 Couve de Murville said that
 De Gaulle was somewhat preju-
 diced in judging Khrushchev,
 since he had such a high regard
 for Stalin.  De Gaulle found
 Khrushchev "clever, intelligent,
 and well informed," but not a
 "superior" person.
 Test Ban Talks
 In reaction to the Eisen-
 hower-Macmillan statement of
 29 March calling for unilateral
 pledges not to test small under-
 ground nuclear weapons, the
 USSR will probably insist that
 a moratorium on such tests be
 included  in some  form in a
 treaty banning all other tests.
 Moscow would seek to portray
 Western agreement to,this ar-
 rangement as implying accept-
 ance of the long-standing So-
 viet demand for a comprehensive
 ban on all tests.
 Soviet chief delegate
 Tsarapkin at Geneva has asked
 why the United States favors
 such unilateral declarations
 rather than formal incorpora-
 tion of a moratorium obligation
 in the treaty, emphasizing that

 the USSR regards this question
 as of "crucial importance."
 In requesting more de-
 tails on the Eisenhower-Mac-
 millan plan, Tsarapkin took the
 position that the duration of
 a moratorium should coincide
 with that of the research and
 development program to make
 all tests detectable.   Referring
 town alleged statement by AEC
 Chairman McCone that four or
 five years would be necessary
 to develop a reliable control
 system over the cessation of
 all tests, Tsarapkin asked
 whether this is still the po-
 sition of the United States.
 The British delegation
 has been instructed to follow
 the United States' lead, but
 to agree,  if pressed by the
 USSR, to the inclusion of the
 moratorium on underground tests
 below a certain threshold in
 the treaty banning tests above
 this threshold.   London also
 believes that the moratorium
 and the joint research program
 should be conterminous,
 Disarmament Talks
 The Soviet delegation at
 the disarmament talks contin-
 ued to insist last week that
 the conference recognize the
 principle of "complete and gen-
 eral disarmament" and proceed
 to work out basic principles
 toward this objective.   Follow-
 ing Khrushchev's strong criti-
 cism in France of the failure
 of the Western plan to offer
 common areas for agreement,
 Zorin characterized the West-
 ern plan as an inadequate re-
 sponse to the UN resolution
 and unacceptable as a basis
 for further negotiations.   He
 stressed the standard theme
 that the West was seeking to
 negotiate "complete and general
 control,"   while evading spe-
 cific disarmament measures, and
 urged that the conference re-
 vert to the main task of com-
 plete and general disarmament
 assigned to it by the UN.
 Despite continued bloc
 criticism of the Western plan,
 the atmosphere of the conference
 continued to be relaxed and the
 tone of the debate moderate.
 Zorin stated publicly that
 he will not agree to discuss
 partial disarmament measures
 until it becomes clear that the
 West is not interested in gen-
 eral and complete disarmament.
 This line provides further evi-
 dence that Soviet tactics are
 aimed at drawing the West to-
 ward at least agreement in prin-
 ciple to Moscow's formula of
 "general and complete disarma-
 ment" as the goal of the con-
 ference or, failing this, to
 place the blame on the West for
 a failure to agree.

 The Communist press complained
 on 4 April that   "responsible
 officials"  stopped   citizens
 going to Baghdad to partici-
 pate in the parade of Peace
 Partisans the day before.
 ]Fears over an increasingly
 friendly official attitude to-
 ward the West are evident in
 the Communist press criticism
 of the regime's moves to take
 advantage  of  the modest US
 technical assistance program.
 Comparisons have been made be-
 tween the "octopus trap of
 Point Four aid" and the further
 "sincere economic aid"  Soviet
 First Deputy Premier Mikoyan
 is expected to extend during
 his visit to Baghdad beginning
 on 8 April.   (See  Part   II,
 page 12).
 Measures against the Com-
 munists have increased the in-
 fluence of anti-Communist army
 elements within the regime and
 have narrowed Qasim's area of
 maneuver  by  alienating  the
 Iraqi Communists, except for the
 splinter faction backed by him.
 Accompanying the stiffening at-
 titude of the army has been an
 improvement in discipline and
 a decrease of Communist influ-
 ence within the armed forces.
 The army now is the mainstay of
 the regime and is in a position
 to exert more effective pres-
 sure on the civilian government.
 Jordan-UAR
 Husayn left on 4 April for
 official visits to Iran, Turkey,
 Ethiopia, and Morocco, and then
 will go unofficially  to Spain
 and possibly other countries.
 Meanwhile, the Arab League
 Council's political affairs com-
 mittee, which reconvened in Cairo
 on 31 March, decided that'the
 Palestine issue was too delicate
 for it to handle, in view of the
 diametrically opposed positions
 of Jordan and the UAR.   Further
 consideration of UAR proposals
 for a "Palestine entity and army"
 has therefore been deferred un-
 til the Arab League foreign min-
 isters meet in a special session
 planned for the end of April.
 Israel
 Israeli  Prime  Minister
 Ben-Gurion,whose personal odys-
 sey so far has taken him to

 foster an image of the Soviet
 Union as the big-power support-
 er of the Arab countries against
 an allegedly expansionist-
 minded-Israel.   A refusal, on
 the other hand, would show that
 Moscow's advocacy of contacts
 at the head-of-government level
 applies only when Soviet lead-
 ers feel such contacts may
 further their policy objectives.
 Ben-Gurion presumably in-
 tends to present Israel's views
 on Middle East issues to the
 Soviet Government in case there
 is any consideration of the
 area's problems at the East-
 West summit conference.   The
 Israelis would like a declara-
 tion by the Big Four powers that
 would guarantee the territorial
 status quo in the Middle East
 and encourage an Arab-Israeli
 settlement.   Britain, France,
 and the United States joined
 in a declaration in 1950 which'
 undertook to guarantee exist-
 ing Middle Eastern frontiers,
 but Nasir continues to de-
 nounce it.
 According to an announce-
 ment in Israel, Ben-Gurion has
 been invited to make an official
 visit to France.   The French
 have been cool toward a De
 Gaulle - Ben-Gurion meeting,
 and this visit probably will
 not take place until after the
 summit conference.
 De Gaulle has4`,sought, over
 the opposition of some French
 circles, to disengage Paris from
 its close relationship with Is-
 rael in the interest of better
 relations with the Arab states,
 his immediate aim being to fa-
 cilitate a settlement in Algeria.
 Despite this policy, however,
 there are indications that the
 French sent 12 more Super
 Mystere jet fighters to Israel
 on 11 March.   This would raise
 the estimated number of Super
 Mysteres the Israelis have to
 44; they also have an estimated
 57 Mysteres.
 Central Treaty Organization
 At a meeting in Tehran in
 late March of the Military Com-
 mittee of the Central Treaty
 Organization (CENTO), Pakistan,
 Iran, and Turkey, strongly backed
 a plan to establish a CENTO
 command structure.   Iran is
 seeking to have the Shah named
 commander in chief.
 While the British represent-
 ative personally agreed to the
 need for a command structure,
 he indicated his government
 could not accept the study on
 the subject submitted to the
 committee, because British mil-
 itary authorities had  not had
 sufficient opportunity to ex-
 amine the document.   The British
 have felt that some gesture
 should be made toward Iran to
 prevent a "crisis of confidence"
 and were less firm than previously
 in support of the US position
 against a command structure.
 After considerable debate,
 the Military Committee:. agreed
 to report to the CENTO Ministe-
 rial Council meeting in late
 April that it had taken "cogni-
 zance" of the study.

 CARIBBEAN TROUBLE SPOTS
 The Castro regime is mov-

 Cuban universities and to
 squelch the recent manifesta-
 tions of anti-Communist senti-
 ment among politically active
 student groups.   At the same
 time, the regime has provided
 television facilities and helped
 in other ways the national con-
 gress of the youth section of
 the Cuban Communist party which
 opened in Havana on 4 April.
 In line with Castro's in-
 sistence that anti-Communism
 is counterrevolution, the gov-
 ernment-dominated leadership
 of the Federation of University
 Students (FEU) at Havana Uni-
 versity has convened special
 courts to try as "enemies of
 the revolution" students who
 supported newscaster Luis Conte
 Aguero's attacks on Communist
 influence in Cuba.   This has
 intimidated Catholics and other
 anti-Communists among the stu-
 dents, most of whom have thus
 far supported Castro.
 Che Guevara has told stu-
 dents that the traditionally
 autonomous universities must
 be brought under close govern-
 ment supervision, and              25X1
 2,000 care-
 fully chosen students from
 rural areas will be sent to Ha-
 vana University by the govern-
 ment.   The regime will pay all
 their expenses and use them as
 shock troops to maintain con-
 trol there.
 The Communist youth con-
 gress has attracted delegates
 from the Sino-Soviet bloc and
 from various Latin American
 countries.   Its theme of sup-
 port for and defense of the
 Cuban revolution is another
 of the "unity" moves which
 have helped the Communists at-
 tain strong influence in the

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 The South African Govern-
 ment, alarmed by the effective-
 ness of the Africans' recent
 work stoppages, has stepped up
 its campaign of repression,
 The provisions of the 30 March
 proclamation of a state of
 emergency--which established
 virtual martial law in the
 country's urban areas--have
 been supplemented by decrees
 placing further restrictions
 on demonstrations by Africans.
 and authorizing the use of
 "force resulting in death" in
 the event of "suspected danger"
 to.  life or property. Although
 the government has slightly
 relaxed the African pass sys-
 tem--partly because it was un-
 enforceable--it will not. modify
 its control. over the movement
 and employment of Africans.
 Police are using strong-
 ariri 3lnethods in several cities
 -to "intimidate the intimidators?
 who they believe are responsible
 for the demonstrations and the
 widespread work stoppages. More
 than 400 persons have been ar-
 rested under the emergency regu-
 lations. A law authorizing the
 government to outlaw African
 organizations was promulgated
 on 5 April.
 The African labor situa-
 tion has returned to normal in
 most areas.   However,  the week-
 long strike,  which caused an
 estimated $60,000,000 loss in
 industrial production, demon-
 strated to both Africans and
 Europeans the potential eco-
 nomio loverage of the African
 community.   The native labor
 force probably will be squeezed
 by growing pressures from both
 nationalist agitators and se-
 curity forces, with a concomi-
 tant. rise in tension.
 The widespread interna-
 tional Briticism of the Verwoerd
 government's actions---,particu-
 larly the UN Security Council's
 resolution on I April--have
 made the Europeans in South
 Africa increasingly aware of
 their isolation;  as a result,
 opposition to the prime minister
 has become more articulate and
 widespread.   However,  Verwoerd
 apparently retains the support
 of the conservative Afrikaner
 farmers who form the backbone
 of the ruling Nationalist party.
 the government's repressive
 program,  moreover,  probably has
 at least the tacit support of
 a large part of the European
 community.   Thus a radical

 PEIPING'S VIEWS ON "INEVITABILITY" OF WAR
 The Chinese Communist par-
 ty,  in the current issue of its
 theoretical journal Red Flag,
 makes its most categorical
 statement thus far that war is
 probable--and in some instances,
 inevitable--as long as "im-
 perialism" exists.   Using  the
 90th anniversary of Lenin's
 birth as a springboard,  the
 journal warns Chinese Commu-
 nists away from the pronounce-
 ments Khrushchev has made on
 the nature of the contest with
 the West.   It implicitly criti-
 cizes the Soviet premier for a
 less dynamic opposition to "im-
 perialism" than Peiping feels
 is required by its own  and
 world Communist objectives.
 The article is another example
 of the Chinese leaders' readi-
 ness to manipulate basic doc-
 trine in justification of their
 own policies.  (See Part III,
 page 1).
 The Red Flag article is
 aimed at Iffirushchev's justifi-
 cation for a detente--his prop-
 osition that bloc strength has
 progressed to a point where the
 "inevitable war" theory, so use-
 ful to the USSR as a spur   to
 discipline and production dur-
 ing its earlier years, may  be
 put aside in favor of "peaceful
 competition."  The Chinese are

 attempting to empty
 the coexistence
 thesis of all mean-
 ing, buttressing
 their arguments with
 selected quotations
 from Lenin and the
 sayings of Mao Tse-
 tung.
 Red Flag insists      22 July 1959.
 that 'Ti pe- alism"
 has not changed and
 cannot change and
 that its economic
 system breeds war because it
 is based on "exploitation and
 oppression."   It states that
 "the imperialist policy of
 plunder is bound to lead to
 war."  This contrasts vividly
 with Khrushchev's statement to
 the Soviet 21st party congress
 that "there will be created real
 possibilities for eliminating
 war as a means of settling in-
 ternational issues."  The Chi-
 nese stress that the "war ma-
 niacs" can only be thwarted by
 "fighting tooth and nail."
 The journal claims that
 "within imperialism," colonial
 and civil wars are "inevitable"
 and that those fighting "im-
 perialism" deserve strong bloc
 support.   In a remark apparent-
 ly intended to take issue with
 Khrushchev's insistence that
 the USSR will. not aggressively
 export Communism,  Red Flag
 states that to ignore such wars
 would be "extreme opportunism"
 and  would  betray the  "so-
 cialist revolution."
 While the Chinese empha-
 size the "inevitability" of
 "imperialist" wars,  they skirt
 a direct pronouncement that a
 major East-West war is equally
 certain.   Nevertheless, Red
 Flag conjures up for its read-
 ers the now-familiar image of
 implacable US hostility.   "The
 peace desired by US imperialism
 is a peace which provides for
 SOVIET
 "Only peaceful coexistence and
 peaceful competition between the
 two systems can prevent war."
 Joint Soviet-Polish statement,
 CHINESE
 "I think the American people and the
 people of all countries menaced by
 US aggression should unite to repel
 the attacks of US reactionaries and
 their lackeys. Only victory in this
 struggle can avert a third world war;
 it can not be averted otherwise."
 lino Tse-tung, quoted by Red Flac. 1
 January 1960.
 US domination of the whole
 globe--it is peace for the
 purpose of eliminating social-
 ism."  Red Flag charges that to
 realize-ids amTition, the United
 States is paying "lip service
 to peace" while preparing for a
 world war and "actively conduct-
 ing" limited wars.
 Red Flag's diatribe reflects
 the vTe Piping places on
 having an external enemy with
 which to goad its people toward
 greater efforts, as well as frus-
 tration with the effect a pro-
 longed detente would have on
 Communist China's ambitiong to
 eliminate US influence in Taiwan
 and the western Pacific.  Quoting
 Lenin, Red Flag states, "We are
 surroun ec  .  by people,  classes,
 and governments who openly ex-
 press the greatest hatred for
 us."     With implications which
 could hardly be lost on Khru-
 shchev,  the Chinese draw again
 from Lenin to express their ir-
 ritation: "Whoever has thought
 that it is easy to attain peace
 --that one has only to mention
 the word and the bourgeoisie
 will present it on a silver
 platter--is a very naive person."
 Khrushchev's reported at-
 tack on the Chinese at the Feb-
 ruary Warsaw Pact meeting for
 refusing to support the USSR's
 attempts to reduce world ten-
 sion apparently has had little
 effect on Peiping.   He is said

 The opening session  of
 the National 'People's Congress
 in Peiping on 30 March was the
 forum for an announcement by
 Communist China's   planning
 chief,  Vice Premier Li Fu-chun,
 that "urban communes" are be-
 ing developed "in a big way"
 in cities throughout the coun-
 try.   The statement was preceded
 in recent weeks by a campaign to
 publicize the rapid growth of
 facilities for "collectivized
 living" in major cities.   Al-
 though urban communes had not
 been mentioned specifically,  it
 was apparent that the facilities
 were a long step in that direc-
 tion.
 In the fall of l0,58 urban
 communes were presented as an
 integral part of the program,
 but the regime experienced such
 difficulties in their organiza-
 tion that the attempt was vir-
 tually ignored after the end of
 that year.   This coincided with
 Peiping's modification of its
 doctrinal claims for the whole
 commune program,  presumably in
 deference to Soviet objections.
 Peiping is attempting to
 minimize the lapse of more
 than a year in the urban com-
 mune movement by presenting
 the present drive as the out-
 come of a two-year period of
 experimentation.   A People's
 Daily editorial of 31 March,
 which described the formation
 of urban communes as "an event
 of great historical signifi-
 cance," claimed that they would
 be "a good organizational form
 for further organizing the eco-
 nomic and cultural life" of
 city residents.
 The editorial claimed the
 organization of production was
 the first step in forming urban
 communes and referred to "com-
 mune and neighborhood" industry,
 but the exact form the communes
 will take has been left obscure.
 Some urban communes formed in
 the past have been organized
 around a single,  large economic
 enterprise such as a factory or
 a mine, while others have been
 organized on the basis of dis-
 tricts and contained only small-
 scale industries.   Both  of
 these methods, and combinations
 of the two, will probably be
 used in the new movement.
 People's Daily declared
 that communes were being estab-
 lished in "many" cities,  suggest-
 ing that not all cities will
 proceed at the same rate.   A
 local newspaper recently claimed
 that the Manchurian industrial
 city of Shenyang at the end of
 1958 became the first to be to-
 tally communalized.   The news-
 paper said the communes are
 organized on the basis of streets
 and contain an average of 30,-
 000 members.

 7 April 1960
 30 March--his first public ap-
 pearance in Peiping in five
 months.   In keeping with-the
 present campaign to present
 Mao as a ..creative Marxist-Len-
 inist theoretician, it is like-
 ly that t'ze drive'for urban
 communes:  will be firmly linked
 to his "ideology,"  Expansion
 of the commune movement indicates
 that Peiping is willing to risk
 Moscow's displeasure rather       25X1

 essential aspects of its cur-
 rent programs.
 PEIPING CALLS FOR ANOTHER BIG LEAP FORWARD
 Communist China's 1960
 economic plan and budget,which
 were presented to the opening
 session  -of 'the  National
 People's Congress on 30 April,
 make clear the regime's satis-
 faction with the policies fol-
 lowed in 1958 and 1959  and
 its.. determination to continue
 to push the economy forward at
 "big leap" speed,   The congress
 was told that the situation in
 the country is "wonderful,"
 that economic work on all
 fronts is expanding."in ever-
 mounting waves," and that
 "Communist conscious-
 ness" of the masses
 is higher than ever
 before.
 Although the
 tone of the congress
 is definitely confi-
 dent, the over-all
 rate of growth sched-
 uled in the 1960 plan
 is lower than those
 dlaimed to have been
 achieved in 1958 and
 1959.   The gross
 value of industrial
 and agricultural pro-
 duction is to increase
 23 percent this year,
 as compared with 48
 percent claimed  in
 1958 and 31 percent
 claimed in 1959.

 Marshal Sarit,     the Thai
 premier, may be considering cer-
 tain gestures to the Sino-Soviet
 bloc as a means of registering
 his dissatisfaction with vari-
 ous aspects of Thailand's rela-
 tions with the United States.
 Sarit and other Thai officials
 in recent months have become in-
 creasingly critical of the United
 States over such issues as
 American plans to sell PL-480
 rice to India,  slow delivery
 of military equipment, and the
 level of economic aid to Thai-
 land, both in absolute terms
 and in comparison with what Thai-
 land considers the dispropor-
 tionate amounts given to neu-
 tralist Cambodia and India.
 These officials have on
 occasion given. indirect expres-
 sion to their feelings through
 articles planted in the Bangkok
 press,   The most recent example
 .is an anonymous'letter carried
 in the 31 March edition of the
 English-language Bangkok.Post.
 Sarit has been stanchly
 pro-US since he came to power
 in September 1957, but he has
 been embarrassed in his deal-
 ings with his supporters by the
 fact that American aid has de-
 clined during this period. This
 decline has also coincided with
 a growing Thai desire for for-
 eign ..,:wy)ital to speed the coun-
 try's economic development pro-
 gram.
 The recent Thai decision
 to permit the TASS agency to
 reopen its office in Bangkok
 would also seem designed to
 dramatize Thai dissatisfaction
 with the United States.   The
 office has been closed.since

 INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 April 1960
 ALGERIAN REBEL ORGANIZATION IN FRANCE
 The Algerian rebel Nation-
 al Liberation Front (FLN),which
 has suffered serious military
 setbacks in Algeria, retains a
 disciplined and potentially
 powerful organization in metro-
 politan France.   Except  for
 sporadic attempts at sabotage,
 however,  its energy is largely
 directed toward maintaining
 supremacy over the rival Al-
 gerian National Movement (MNA).
 The FLN organization consti-
 tutes at present a means  of
 collecting funds and army re-
 cruits among  Algerians  in
 France.   It could  be turned
 Into a vehicle for stepped-up
 rebel paramilitary activity in
 France, should rebel fortunes
 in Algeria continue to decline.
 The rebel  high command
 has divided metropolitan France,
 like Algeria itself,  into ad-
 ministrative districts, which
 are in turn divided into zones.
 Rebel activities in France are
 conducted by the Special Organ-
 ization, which is responsible
 to the  rebel  government  in
 Tunis.  Although periodic po-
 lice roundups of rebel mili-
 tants during 1959 weakened the
 FLN organization  in  several
 areas, an official French serv-
 ice estimated in January 1960
 that  the  rebels  controlled
 close to 60 percent of the Al-
 gerians in France, who report-
 edly number about 275,000.
 In contrast   to  Algeria,
 where rebel terrorist activity
 has been directed against Euro-
 peans as well as Moslems, such
 FLN activities in France have
 been directed primarily against
 the adherents of   Mesali   Hadj,
 whose MNA continues to challenge
 the FLN as a spokesman for Al-
 geria-'s Moslems. Despite occa-
 sional police casualties in this
 factional strife,French authori-
 ties have shown increased tolerance
 of the MNA as it has proved use-
 ful as a counterweight to the FLN.
 Assassination victims of the FLN-
 MNA vendetta reportedly numbered
 715 during 1959, compared with
 937 the previous year.
 Rebel preoccupation  with
 the MNA appears to have  pre-
 vented FLN members from fully
 exploiting their capability
 for sabotage and other anti-
 French activity.   However, the
 rebels also appear  reluctant
 to unduly antagonize'the French
 populace, the majority of which
 favors a negotiated solution in
 Algeria.   Not since their  at-
 tacks on various oil refineries
 in August 1958 have the rebels
 scored a major sabotage success.
 The rebel leadership continues
 to direct   its primary  atten-
 tion to the hostilities in Al-
 geria  and to diplomatic                                                                 ac-
 tivity aimed at prodding France
 into cease-fire negotiations.
 Its primary goals in France ap-
 pear to be the  collection  of
 funds and the maintenance  of
 the loyalty of Algerians   re-
 siding in the metropole.                                                                  Some
 recruits appear to reach   the
 Algerians from France, often
 via Belgium or West Germany.
 In Algeria itself, rebel
 military capabilities continue
 to erode as a result of French
 military pressure, frequent
 shortages of ammunition  and
 sagging morale.
 MIKOYAN VISIT TO IRAQ
 First  Deputy  Premier
 Mikoyan  is heading an offi-
 cial government delegation to
 open the Soviet exhibition in
 Baghdad on 8 April,        Mikoyan--
 the highest ranking Soviet
 official  ever to visit  the

 officials.

 7 April 1960
 Soviet propaganda for the
 visit suggests Mikoyan will
 offer additional economic aid
 to Iraq.   Under the $137,500,-
 000 credit of March 1959, the
 USSR is to build Iraq's first
 steel mill and a number of
 other industrial plants, con-
 struction of which in most in-
 stances will not begin until
 1961.
 The Soviet Union, in ex-
 tracting maximum propaganda out
 of its economic aid to Iraq,
 nurtured Iraqi hopes for quick,
 visible economic results.   Now,
 however, the initial advantage
 gained by the Soviet credit is
 beginning to be overshadowed by
 unreasonable Iraqi disappoint-
 ment.   Soviet  authorities,
 aware of the pressures being
 generated in Baghdad by Iraq's
 deteriorating economic situa-
 tion, may feel that additional
 economic aid would forestall
 any attempt to blame the USSR
 for the failures of Qasim's gov-
 ernment.
 Moscow probably will con-
 tinue to publicize its activ-
 ities as the various projects
 under the credit are imple-
 mented,                      and encourage Iraqi
 officials to take advantage of
 other bloc sources of aid.
 In February,  Iraq was con-
 sidering a Czech offer of a
 $30,000,000 line of credit which
 apparently could be used to fi-
 nance small, easily implemented
 projects.   Moscow may also of-
 fer to speed up some of its
 projects now under way or ear-
 mark some part of a new credit
 for immediate utilization.
 Soviet leaders probably
 hope that the visit will counter
 recent improvements in Baghdad's
 relations with the West and
 soften the Qasim regime's atti-
 tude toward Iraqi Communists.
 The bloc press and radio,  al-
 though carefully refraining from
 direct criticism of recent meas-
 ures by the regime against
 Iraqi Communists, have indicated
 the concern of bloc leaders by
 quoting news stories in the
 Iraqi  Communist  press criti-
 cizing  these actions.   A
 lecturer in Moscow  on 16 March
 censured  Qasim  along with
 such  other "bourgeois  na-
 tionalist" leaders                                                                          as Nasir,
 Nehru, Sukarno,   and Abboud--

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 April 1960
 this letter was read in churches
 and religious gatherings through-
 out the country.
 Catholic priests have
 openly criticized the regime's
 methods in the collectivization
 campaign.   West Berlin news-
 papers recently reported that
 a Catholic priest was arrested
 in Schwerin District and sub-
 jected to long interrogation.
 Tie was released after the farm-
 ers in his congregation joined
 a collective farm.
 Regime officials are ac-
 celerating their drive to force
 rural Evangelical pastors to
 repudiate their leaders and
 support collectivization.
 If the regime is successful
 in its renewed efforts to split
 the Evangelical clergy, it can
 be expected to take more force-
 ful steps to bar contacts with
 Bishop Dibelius of Berlin-Bran-
 denburg, who resides in West
 Berlin and heads the synod of
 the Evangelical Church for all
 Germany.   Legal proceedings have
 already been instituted against
 Dibelius in East Berlin, charg-
 ing him with urging the populace
 not to obey the regime.   Party
 boss Ulbricht is certainly a-
 ware, however, that the un-
 favorable publicity that would
 follow any move to arrest the
 bishop when he visits in East
 Berlin would probably not be    25X1
 palatable to the Kremlin on the
 eve of the summit meeting.

 POSSIBLE CABINET SHAKE-UP IN SPAIN
 Sharpening antagonism be-
 tween supporters and opponents
 of the economic stabilization
 program drain instituted in July
 1959 has resulted in the dis-
 missal of Housing Minister Jose
 Luis Arrese, and influential
 ministers seem to be readying an
 all-out attack on the program.
 There is speculation Franco may
 be preparing a cabinet reshuffle
 to avoid further ministerial
 bickering.
 The government announced
 on 18 March that Arrese's post
 had been teinporarily taken over
 by Minister Without Portfolio
 Social Democrats.   The initia-
 tive for new elections rests,
 however, with President Kekkonen,
 who may oppose them for fear they
 would reduce his party's and his
 own influence.

 which controls most key positions
 in the party, may for both do-
 mestic and allegedly foreign
 policy considerations continue
 to obstruct efforts to broaden
 the government,  and thus retain
 its dominant position.   Kekkonen
 and his cohorts may in addition
 feel that an Agrarian government
 --of which the USSR appears to
 be least suspicious--is best
 suited to associate Finland with
 the European Free Trade Associa-

 Britain's propo6al to in-
 troduce internal self -govern-

 ceived favorably, but the Guia-
 nese delegation objected to
 making this contingent on
 satisfactory operation of in-

 insisted that the Guianese
 take over control of the police
 only gradually and under Btit-
 ish supervision, and that ade-
 quate provision be made for
 British officials in the local
 civil service.
 The Guianese were prepared
 to accept British retention of
 control over defense and  for-

 constitution to be drafted by
 August 1961, but they were op-

 that the Marxist convictions
 of Jagan--who will probably be-

 require retention of reserve
 controls. London agreed  in

 full independence in 1963, or
 earlier if British Guiana should

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 April 1960
 In El Salvador's elections
 on 24 April,     President Lemus'
 middle-of-the-road party is ex-
 pected to win all 54 seats in
 the National Legislative Assem-
 bly and nearly all the local
 offices at stake.  Despite the
 President's popularity, how-
 ever, there are signs of dis-
 satisfaction in the armed forces
 and in his own party, and rumors
 of plotting are beginning to
 circulate.
 The President's party, the
 Revolutionary Democratic Unifi-
 cation party (PRUD), has pro-
 vided a stable, moderately pro-
 gressive, and cautiously demo-
 cratic government since 1950.
 PRUD's emphasis on party organ-
 ization has given it a distinct
 advantage in elections over the
 weak and divided opposition
 groups, and since 1952 it has
 held all the legislative seats.
 Under PRUD's administration,
 some progress has been made in
 improving economic conditions.
 The recent dissatisfaction of
 the military stems partly from
 disgruntlement at not receiving
 the favored treatment accorded
 by previous presidents and part-
 ly from dislike of Lemus' hesi-
 tancy in suppressing Communist
 activity.
 The greatest irritant seems
 to be the belief among the of-
 ficers that Lemus is grooming
 Major Rubio Melhado as presiden-
 tial candidate for the 1962
 elections.   One army colonel
 recently stated that a palace
 revolution was a "certainty" if
 the President persists in cham-
 pioning Melhado as his successor.
 On 29 March, Lemus ordered the
 transfer of 19 high-ranking of-
 ficers, perhaps as a measure to
 disrupt a suspected plot against
 himself.  The President's growing
 suspicion of his most capable as-
 sociates,                                                                  his refusal to dele-
 gate adequate responsibility to
 them,  and his recent tendency to
 replace them with more pliable
 figures have lowered party morale
 and impeded progress toward bet-
 tering living conditions.
 The small Reform Action
 party (PAR) will be the only
 party running candidates against
 the PRUD, but several groups,
 not legally recognized as par-
 ties, are expected to campaign
 for the PAR.  These include the
 Communists and a small but vo-    25X1
 ciferous group of sympathizers
 with Fidel Castro's revolutionar
 movement.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 SINO-SOVIET DOCTRINAL DISPUTES
 Mao Tse-tung once said:
 "Dogma is less useful than cow
 dung," and Nikita Khrushchev
 is fond of repeating Lenin's
 colorful slogan; "Theory, my
 friend,  is grey, but green is
 the eternal tree of life."
 These expressions of contempt
 are accurate reflections of the
 thought of both men concerning
 those who conceive of ideology
 as a body of absolute truths
 from which action flows. Com-
 munist teaching, however, pos-
 its            a world in which theory
 and practice are intertwined,
 and on this level both leaders
 are intimately concerned'with
 ideology.
 Communist doctrine supplies
 a ritual language through which
 leaders communicate their in-
 tentions,  define the razor's
 edge which divides loyalty from
 rebellion, distinguish friend
 from foe, and convey to the
 initiated an official interpre-
 tation of current situations
 and conflicts.   Soviet ortho-
 doxy can make sharp changes,
 turning yesterday's ideological
 conformity into today's noncon-
 formity.  Despite changes in
 its content, the function of
 Marxist theory in the Soviet
 system has remained the same:
 to assure ideological uniform-
 ity behind whatever course of
 action the Soviet Government
 has adopted at the moment.
 .become at least a source of
 confusion rather than certainty,
 and at most a solvent that loos-
 ens the bonds of the Communist
 world.
 Mao's Authority
 The Chinese Communists,
 under Mao Tse-tung's undisputed
 control, have always sought to
 apply--"in a creative way"--

 Marxism-Leninism to the actual
 conditions in China, and in
 this process they have fre-
 quently diverged in their views
 from Soviet doctrine.
 Following the death of
 Stalin, Mao won increasing
 praise from Soviet leaders for
 his creative "originality" as
 a Marxist-Leninist theoretician.
 This was an acceptance of claims
 which the Chinese had been mak-
 ing for years but at which Sta-
 lin had boggled; Stalin was
 jealous of his own prerogatives
 as the only living creative in-
 novator in Marxism-Leninism,
 and he recognized the dangers
 in acknowledging a center out-
 side his control which could
 interpret and adapt theory for
 itself.
 Marxist ideology is said
 to be the cement that binds the
 Communist world together.  This
 is true, however, only as long
 as there is but one high priest
 to expound the new formulations
 which are intended to interpret
 changes in objective reality.

 Immediately after Stalin's
 death, China's elevation to a

 Stalin's coffin along with the
 surviving Soviet leaders. Mao's
 position was eloquently recog-

 November 1957.   Neither Chinese
 leaders nor propagandists had
 ever echoed the formulation
 that the Chinese were coequal
 with the Soviet Union in the
 leadership of the Communist
 world, and the Soviet Union
 itself had dropped the slogan
 within two years of its appear-
 ance  Mao's attitude and ac-
 tions while in Moscow seemed
 to reflect the reality of the
 situation, however: in bloc
 affairs and in the formula-
 tion of doctrinal and program-
 matic theses both the Chinese
 and Soviet leaders shared the
 pinnacle.
 Until the Chinese launched
 the "great leap" and began the
 development of their commune
 program in the middle of 1958,
 Chinese innovations in doctrinal
 matters were either greeted in
 Moscow by silence or were ad-
 justed to Soviet doctrine
 through compromise.   In this
 period, the Soviet succession
 question was still not settled
 and the problem of the USSR's
 control over its European satel-
 lites was an overriding one. By
 1958, however, the USSR had
 managed to stabilize Eastern
 Europe, and Khrushchev had elim-
 inated Marshal Zhukov, the last
 powerful force that stood be-
 tween him and firm control at
 home.
 The general claim that
 emerged from the Chinese pro-
 grammatic papers on the commune
 movement was that Peiping had
 the right not only to work out
 particular solutions to specif-
 ically Chinese problems but
 also to elaborate the funda-
 mentals of its "path to Com-
 munism."  Not only did the
 theoretical justification ap-
 pear sharply at variance with
 Moscow's canons,  but the Chi-
 nese claim included an impli-
 cation that Peiping's path
 could be followed by other
 "socialist" countries and
 constituted a bolder challenge
 to the USSR's leadership and
 pre-eminence as the "first so-
 cialist country."   Faced with
 this challenge and strength-
 ened externally by the devel-
 opments of the previous year
 and with a personal internal
 victory behind him, Khrushchev
 apparently decided it was time
 to deal with Chinese doctrinal
 claims.
 Commune Aftermath
 Although the Chinese
 abandoned some of their more
 extravagant claims to an early
 achievement of Communism through
 the medium of the communes,  they
 maintained that the commune
 would be the best form of so-
 ciety for moving into Communism
 and that the communes themselves
 contain the "sprouts of Commu-
 nism" in their supply and mess-
 hall systems.   Despite Soviet
 pressure to substitute a less
 pretentious term for their
 large agricultural components,
 the Chinese have preserved the
 name with all its implications.
 They have dropped their defen-
 sive retrenchment on the ques-
 tion of the communes as the
 means of achieving Communism
 at some future date and have
 moved to re-establish the theo-
 retical foundation for the
 commune program.
 During the early contro-
 versy over Chinese claims for
 the communes,  Khrushchev and
 other Soviet spokesmen raised
 fundamental objections--based
 on more customary Soviet views--
 revolving around the primitive-
 ness of the Chinese economic
 machine,  the necessity for ma-
 terial incentives in building
 Communism, and payment accord-
 ing to the work performed.  Pei-
 ping now is claiming that Mao
 has made new "discoveries" in
 political economy which run
 directly counter to the Soviet
 position.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 April 1960
 At the 21st party con-
 gress, Khrushchev stressed
 that the only way to build a
 base for Communism was to in-
 crease the "material interest"
 of the workers in their labor.
 Mao now has "discovered," how-
 ever,  "the decisive principle
 for the encouragement of pos-
 itiveness among laborers: pol-
 itics taking command is first,
 while material incentives can
 only occupy the second posi-
 tion."   Khrushchev asserted
 that "under socialism, all
 people... receive payment ac-
 cording to their work."  Peo-'
 1p e's Daily, discussing Mao's
 new "discovery," countered,
 "The people's Communist work-
 ing style (is)...selfless labor
 with total disregard for re-
 muneration."
 People's Daily asserts
 that Mao has "discovered" the
 "definite elements of high-
 speed development of socialist
 construction," an outgrowth of
 Mao's theory of the "uninter-
 rupted revolution."  The Soviet
 Union has never accepted the
 thesis of "building socialism"
 by means of a "permanent rev-
 olution," stressing instead the
 building of socialism by stages.
 Mao, Khrushchev as Ideologues
 Concomitantly with the de-
 velopment of a theoretical foun-
 dation for its economic pro-
 grams, Peiping is reserving to
 Mao the right to be considered
 the most eminent living Com-
 munist theoretician.   A re-
 cent Chinese listing of clas-
 sical writers of Marxism set
 Mao after Marx, Engels, Lenin,
 and Stalin.  A provincial Chi-
 nese party leader has advanced
 criteria for the study of Marx-
 ism and recognition of a genu-
 ine Marxist as follows: "The
 only correct way to study
 Marxism is to use Mao Tse-tung's
 ideology as guidance and Mao
 Tse--tung's works as the key,"
 and,  "The yardstick by which to
 judge each individual as to
 whether or not he is a genuine
 Marxist is his comprehension of
 Mao Tse-tung's ideology."
 Although Soviet spokesmen
 hailed Khrushchev's report to
 the 21st party congress as a
 "shining" and "genuine" contri-
 bution to the "theory of scien-
 tific Communism" and claimed
 that the works of the congress
 belonged with the classical
 works of Marxism-Leninism, there
 has been no intense, sustained
 attempt to build Khrushchev up
 as a great Marxist thinker.
 Khrushchevhimself has accen-
 tuated his pragmatic approach,
 deriding "theoretical phrase-
 mongers" whose "beautiful words
 remain empty promises."   He
 wishes to be known primarily as
 a man who is best at combining
 theory and practice, who through
 practice enriches theory.
 As a result of Mao's latest
 claims to eminence as an ideo-
 logue--claims which serve to
 buttress views antipathetic to
 those in the Soviet Union--
 Khrushchev may find it neces-
 sary to accelerate the develop-
 ment of his role as the arbiter
 of what is or is not permissible.
 His style does not lend itself
 easily to developing a picture
 of himself as a great and "orig-
 inal" thinker, however, while
 Mao already has considerable
 ideological authority as a
 "creative" Marxist thinker.
 Khrushchev probably will
 rely for the moment on the coun-
 terweight of the authority of
 Soviet accomplishments,  To
 counter Chinese contentions, he
 will probably call on the author-
 Itq,, of.: Marx and Lenin and use
 formulations that are part of
 the baggage of Soviet ideology.
 He may also hope that continued
 use of the slogan of "collective
 leadership" and continued cen-
 sure ,of  the  "cult  of  the

 individual" will work to under-
 mine Mao's position in the eyes
 of Communists throughout the
 bloc.
 Khrushchev probably recog-
 nizes, however, that simple
 outright opposition to the Chi-
 nese will not gain his ends.
 While attempting to contain
 Mao's challenge and reassert
 Soviet ideological primacy, he
 may offer formulas which, while
 countering Chinese claims, will
 still offer the Chinese more
 than they now have.
 A hint of this was con-
 tained in his postulate on bloc
 relations introduced at the 21st
 party congress: "It would be
 theoretically correct to assume
 that socialist countries... will
 more or less simultaneously
 reach the highest phase of Com-
 munist society."  While this
 concept undercut Chinese claims
 that their attainment of this
 goal had become imminent, it
 changed a previous tentative
 thesis on the "stages of Com-
 munism" which held that the
 Soviet Union would enter Commu-
 nism first, followed by the
 European satellites, and fi-
 nally by the bloc countries of
 the Far East.
 New Soviet Party Program
 Even without the Chinese
 challenge, the logic of Soviet
 methods of leadership would
 have required the focusing of
 doctrinal authority in Khru-
 shchev, once he attained com-
 plete power within the Soviet
 Union.  Khrushchev, however,
 is not a Stalin, keeping him-
 self remote and unapproachable
 while producing "masterpieces"
 of Communist thought, or a
 Lenin, whose philosophical bent
 was early established.   When
 changes of doctrine are neces-
 sary, therefore,  Khrushchev's
 practical and administrative
 innovations are presented as
 "enriching" doctrine.
 SECRET
 The stage now is set for
 the next step. A committee under
 Khrushchev is preparing, for
 presentation at the 22nd con-
 gress, a new Party Program to
 replace the one under which
 the regime has theoretically
 been operating since 1919. This
 fundamental document will es-
 tablish criteria for a society
 "building the basis for Commu-
 nism",    set:.: forth norms of
 behavior for Soviet Communist
 party members, and be applicable
 throughout the bloc,   It will
 be said to be based on the po-
 litical and economic realities
 as developed in Khrushchev's
 practical innovations over the
 past years.   It will become a
 basic part of Communist theol-
 ogy, but it will not deter
 the Chinese from the path they
 have marked out for themselves.
 Unity of the Communist in-
 ternational movement under sole
 Soviet leadership requires a
 strict conformity and does not
 allow for polycentrism or devia-
 tion. The Chinese, by manipulat-
 ing doctrine in ways that do
 not follow a Soviet model so as
 to increase their prestige and
 to justify their unorthodox
 domestic programs, have created
 both deviation and a rival cen-
 ter of ideological authority.
 While the Chinese continue
 to defer to the Soviet leader-
 ship of the bloc and have great
 need for Soviet scientific, eco-
 nomic, and military assistance,
 they reserve the right to adopt
 independent internal and foreign
 policies along with new doctri-
 nal claims for Mao Tse-tung.

 willingness to justify their
 own unorthodox domestic pro-
 grams with equally unorthodox.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 April 1960
 DISSATISFACTION AMONG FOREIGN STUDENTS IN THE USSR
 Disillusionment in vary-
 ing degrees appears widespread
 among foreigners studying in
 the USSR.  Although some have
 been indoctrinated with a be-
 lief in Communism, reports of
 such occurrences are rare. On
 the other hand, adverse reac-
 tions on the part of foreign
 students both to their own lot
 in Soviet universities and to
 Soviet life around them have
 been reported frequently over
 the past two years.
 The problems of foreign
 students in Soviet universi-
 ties have stemmed in part from
 the difficulties encountered by
 any foreigner in adjusting to
 a highly regimented and un-
 familiar way of life.  Their
 annoyance derives also, however,
 from the special restrictions
 imposed by Soviet authorities,
 who view all foreigners as sus-
 pect and recognize
 that a close view of
 Soviet conditions is
 likely to cause ad-
 verse reactions.
 Categories of Foreign
 Students
 Foreign students
 study in the USSR un-
 der three different
 types of programs:
 bilateral exchange
 agreements, covering
 chiefly students from
 Western Europe and the
 United States; special
 Communist party schol-
 arships offered to
 Communist-oriented
 students in both bloc
 and free world coun-
 tries; and education-
 al aid plans for un-
 derdeveloped areas,
 primarily to countries
 of the Near East and
 Asia.   While the
 causes of complaint
 are much the same for
 all foreign students,
 the equanimity with which they
 accept their frustrations var-
 ies greatly.
 The exchange students are
 generally prepared for the ir-
 ritants they encounter,  and they
 accept them as a necessary evil
 compensated for by the special
 opportunity to study the Soviet
 scene at close range.
 Some Communist scholarship
 students are undoubtedly dis-
 illusioned and frustrated, but
 their reactions are less fre-
 quently reported.  An exception
 was the reaction of at least
 half the approximately 70 Ital-
 ian students who attended Mos-
 cow University last year with-
 out the approval of their gov-
 ernment.  The dissatisfied mem-
 bers of this group consulted
 the Italian Embassy about going
 home, although they face charges

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 7 April 1960
 when they  return of evading
 military service.
 A few scattered reports in
 1957 and 1958 also attest to
 the shock suffered by students
 from Eastern Europe who had
 been taught to regard the USSR
 as the world's most advanced
 country and on arrival found
 it in many ways more primitive
 than their homelands.
 The reactions of the third
 group of recipients of Soviet
 educational aid have been the
 most widely reported and gener-
 ally the most adverse.  They go
 to the USSR to obtain an educa-
 tion not available to them else-
 where, and their'frustrations
 when they feel themselves
 blocked in this regard are
 greater than those of the West-
 erners whose purposes for study-
 ing are different.  Moreover,
 unlike the Western'exchange
 students, they are subject to
 both official and community
 pressures to accept political
 doctrines with which they are
 not necessarily sympathetic.
 In many cases their disillu-
 sionment has been exacerbated
 by their growing recognition
 that they are being exploited
 for propaganda purposes.
 Living Conditions
 Bad food and poor housing
 are the subject of frequent
 complaints.   Some foreign
 students have been assigned
 quarters outside the Moscow
 University skyscraper.  Their
 experiences in inadequately
 heated,cold-''.water flats in
 six-story buildings without
 elevators, six to eight per-
 sons to a room, have given
 them  firsthand  evidence,
 of the hollowness of boasts
 about the material well-being
 of the Soviet people.
 Inadequate medical sup-
 plies and facilities have also
 been a  roblem.
 One foreign student reported
 being told by Soviet medical
 authorities that his severely
 inflamed appendix could not be
 removed, since all hospital fa-
 cilities were overtaxed.   He
 was ordered,  instead, to try
 the ancient Chinese remedies
 of needles and cupping.
 Regimentation
 A major irritant to foreign
 students has been the activity
 of Komsomol brigades--groups
 of Soviet students organized to
 police every aspect of student
 behavior.  0 student who   25X1
 had ordered some Western dance
 records was first told by the
 brigade he could not have them.
 After a heated argument,  it was
 agreed he could receive them
 but would not be permitted to
 take them out of his room.
 A New Year's party given
 a year ago by the African group
 broke up in a fight when the
 Komsomol brigade entered the
 room and ordered all the girls
 out.  The Africans inevitably
 regarded this interference as
 evidence of racial prejudice.
 Several Arab students have re-
 ported being told by Soviet
 acquaintances that the Komsomol
 brigade had warned them to break
 off their friendships with the
 Arabs.
 Another African student
 reported that after he had
 danced often with a Russian
 girl at a university function,
 she received--and showed to
 the African--a letter from her
 Russian boy friend attacking
 her conduct.  The boy friend
 said he did not mind her danc-
 ing with other students, but
 that the flaunting of her
 friendship with a "black man"
 was an insult to his personal
 honor.  The same African com-
 mented that he found Little Rock

 An Iraqi student studying near
 Alma-Ata said he was forbidden
 to go even the few miles to
 that city "because there were
 American tourists there."
 Moscow undoubtedly has
 reason for its concern.   One
 Indian student who managed to
 get permission to visit a small
 village just outside Moscow re-
 turned with the comment, "For

 have been continuing complaints
 that both incoming and outgoing

 More advanced students,

 are so limited in comparison
 with what they felt they could
 accomplish elsewhere, even at

 their time was being wasted.
 Students have also complained
 that Soviet educational tech-

 phasis on rote learning, re-
 sulted in time-wasting atten-

 Student Resentment
 Efforts to make propagan-
 da of the presence of Asian
 and African students led one
 group    from  Ghana, Nigeria,
 Uganda, Cameroun,Togoland, and
 Senegal to organize formally
 in order to prevent exploita-
 tion of individuals.   Soviet
 authorities countered by plant-
 ing  an  informer  within  the
 group,   by  increasing  petty
 harassment through obvious sur-
 veillance, and by depriving
 them of minor privileges.
 The  Indians  have                  com-
 plained that strong Soviet ef-
 forts have been made to pre-
 vent them  from  associating
 with Westerners.  The Soviet
 authorities have even made of-
 ficial representations asking
 the Indian Embassy to order
 Indian students to keep away
 from Westerners.  the Africans
 have bitterly resisted efforts
 to keep them from communicat-

 French embassies.

 the Iraqi students near Alma-

 student in Moscow had asked to

 in explanations there of the

 receiving training in connec-
 tion with the Bhilai steel mill
 project expressed shock over
 the harsh penalties imposed on
 an individual who had failed
 in the production plans through
 no fault of his own, and over
 the total lack of protection
 against such arbitrary punish-
 ment.
 The New University
 The  recently  announced
 University of People's Friend-

 it may provide additional ir-
 ritants.        According to  the
 American Embassy in Moscow,
 the announcement of the new uni-
 versity has already produced
 some initial unfavorable reac-
 tions.   Students from Africa

 Asian diplomats are reported
 to regard the university as a

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 April 1960
 WEST GERMANY'S ARMED FORCES
 The West German military
 build-up now has reached a
 stage where combat effective-
 ness will increase rapidly.
 In all three services most of
 the planned combat units will
 have been activated by the end
 of 1961, and by the mid-1960s
 West Germany's army will prob-
 ably be the strongest ground
 force in Western Europe, and its
 air force a rival to France's
 in tactical air power.   The
 Adenauer government seems de-
 termined to keep its forces
 integrated with NATO,  but the
 pressures Bonn is beginning to
 exert for full equality raise
 problems for the alliance.
 The service leaders,  for
 their part, accept the concept
 of the citizen soldier.   The
 officer corps, conservative in
 outlook,  is aloof from politics.
 The services are making an
 effort to orient officers along
 democratic lines by means of
 schools designed to acquaint
 them with democratic institu-
 tions.
 To protect the rights of
 drafted soldiers, the legisla-
 ture has installed a represent-
 ative in the Ministry of De-
 fense to investigate complaints.
 He has on occasion obtained the
 dismissal from service of an
 Domestic Considerations
 A German contribution to
 the military strength of the
 West has become an increasing-
 ly accepted objective in West
 Germany in the last two years.
 Popular approval of the armed
 forces continues to grow,  and
 even the opposition Social
 Democrats voted last October
 to omit from their revised
 party platform a plank oppos-
 ing military service.   The so-
 called "anti - atomic death"
 program,  which they and the
 main labor organization spon-
 sored in 1958, now is virtually

 abused his men.   Thus far,
 his relations with the high
 command seem good, officer
 morale and leadership have not
 suffered, and the morale of
 the enlisted men is excellent.
 West German strategic
 planning is fully integrated
 with that of NATO.   Most of
 West Germany's combat forces
 are to be committed to NATO,
 but there is a sizable non-NATO
 territorial reserve designated
 for logistic support and rear-
 area security.   Bonn is among

 needed because of a lack of
 space in West Germany and be-
 cause of its proximity to
 potential combat areas.   Ac-
 cording to Defense Minister
 Strauss, the West German forces
 have only 40 percent of their
 required maneuver area and are
 at present unable to fulfill
 their NATO requirement of main-
 taining sufficient military
 supplies for 30 days east of
 the Rhine and for 60 days west
 of the river.
 The American Embassy in
 Bonn believes that the logistics
 France, but it is uncer-
 tain these can satisfy
 Germany's needs. The
 sharply negative re-
 action from other NATO
 members to Defense
 Minister Strauss'
 initial overtures to
 Spain for facilities
 has ruled out any re-
 vival of this ap-
 proach for the time
 being.
 Army
 The West German
 Army presently has
 about 158,000 men,
 two thirds of its
 planned strength of
 220,000.   In addition,
 the territorial defense
 force, which will
 have a professional
 cadre strength of
 20,000 or 30,000 and
 a mobilized strength of 200, 000,
 is to provide civil defense and
 rear-area support.   The fact
 that neither it nor the 25,000-
 man militarized state  and
 federal border police is com-
 mitted to NATO has occasioned
 some concern among Bonn's allies.
 The basic fighting elements
 of the army are its armored
 brigades of 2,700 men each and
 its armored infantry brigades
 of 3,500.   For command and ad-

 of the serious shortage of jet

 The West German Air Force

 sonic G-91 lightweight fighters
 for short-range ground support

 The air force has also
 decided to purchase American
 Matador and Mace cruise-type
 missiles with ranges up to
 1,000 miles, and to procure
 Nike and Hawk guided anti-
 aircraft missiles. For political
 reasons, Defense Minister
 Strauss has agreed to support
 the development of the short-
 range British Blue Water mis-
 sile as a prospective standard
 NATO weapon.
 Navy
 The West German Navy is
 at present a training force
 with little or no combat capa-
 bility.   Despite the fact that
 the navy, with 22,500 of its
 eventual 28,000 men now in
 service, is nearer its over-all
 personnel goal than the other
 two services, it will probably
 reach full combat effectiveness
 later than the other two.
 The navy's most modern
 ships are the new minesweepers
 and motor torpedo boats which
 are beginning to come into
 service in quantity.   Its other
 surface units consist chiefly
 of destroyers of World War II
 vintage and training vessels
 acquired from the United States
 and Britain.   Four new escort
 vessels are nearing completion,
 however, and the first of four
 destroyers under construction
 was launched on 27 March. The
 construction of 12 small 350-
 ton submarines will start next
 summer.
 The naval air arm, which
 has a very limited combat capa-
 bility, consists of two squad-
 rons of British-built Seahawk
 fighter-bombers and one of
 Gannet short-range planes'for
 antisubmarine warfare.
 The restrictions of the
 Western European Union  (WEU)
 Treaty of 1954, although not
 thus far an important obstacle
 to'the development of the West
 German armed forces, are con-
 sidered by German military
 leaders the chief barrier to
 long-range development.   Under
 the treaty terms, Bonn agreed
 not to build atomic weapons,
 bacteriological or chemical
 munitions, long-range guided
 missiles, warships-of over
 3,000 tons, submarines of over
 350 tons, or influence-triggered
 mines.
 Procedures were provided
 for modifying these restrictions
 in some cases, however, and
 Germany has since been permitted
 to construct small antitank
 missiles, ground-to-air Hawks,
 air-to-air Sidewinders, and a
 training ship of about 5,000
 tons.   A request to build
 warships of 6,000 tons and to
 manufacture influence mines
 has been pending since November.
 The WEU treaty would have
 to be renegotiated to permit
 Germany to make atomic, bacte-
 riological, or chemical weapons
 on its own territory.   Bonn
 recognizes that such a renego-
 tiation could not be accomplished
 in the present climate of pub-
 lic opinion in Western Europe
 --particularly that in Britain.
 Bonn,  however,  could make fi-
 nancial and technical contribu-
 tions to a French missile and
 nuclear weapons program and
 could possess such weapons with-
 out violating the letter of the
 WEU treaty restrictions.
 There is no reliable evi-
 dence that West Germany has yet
 undertaken any collaboration
 of this sort, but there have
 been hints that Adenauer may
 be contemplating such a possi-
 bility at some future date if
 German requirements for advanced
 weapons cannot be satisfied
 through NATO machinery.  F

 The scheduled inauguration
 on 21 April of Brazil's new
 federal capital, Brasilia, points
 up both the problems and suc-

 fort to become a "developed"
 nation.   President Kubitschek's
 program, ridiculed locally dur-

 administration, has at the start
 of the fifth and final year en-
 listed the enthusiasm of nearly
 every segment of the population.

 northwest by the six jungle-

 of the Amazon region.   Kubi-
 tschek's determined drive to
 move the capital has stemmed
 from his belief in the need to
 develop the neglected northern
 two thirds of the country as
 rapidly as possible.   This area,
 comprising some 2,000,000 square
 miles and some 25,000,000 in-
 habitants, contains only two
 cities of over 500,000, and un-
 til this year has had almost no
 road or rail connections with
 the rest of the country.

 In early Feb-

 reached Brasilia from

 from Belem, the Ama-,

 which were Airlifted

 have
 been
 working

 year to
 finish
 interstate supply
 roads, city streets,
 a power dam and water
 supply system, gov-
 ernment buildings,
 and shopping and busi-
 ness area.   They will
 also have readied
 apartments and houses
 f or about 4, 000 civil"-
 service families by
 21 April.
 The first contingents of
 Kubitschek's personal staff
 left Rio de Janeiro for Brasil-
 ia in mid-March.   By inaugura-
 tion day, the congress, the
 supreme court, and the cabinet,
 plus about 1,000 selected civil
 servants, will be permanently
 installed.   Daily courier
 flights between Brasilia and
 Rio de Janeiro have already
 begun and presumably will be
 continued for a year or more
 until the move is complete.
 Rio de Janeiro, now the
 Federal District with a popu-
 lation of about 3,500,000,  is
 to become the twenty-first state
 on 21 April and will be known
 as Guanabara, according to the
 constitutional provisions gov-
 erning the move.   The city's
 actual future status remains
 uncertain, however, as congress
 is still debating the desira-

 Brazil's Basic Problems
 Kubitschek's view of his
 development program as the force
 that will propel the country
 toward its "manifest destiny"
 as a great power has focused
 attention on the weaknesses as
 well as the strengths of Bra-
 zil's social and:_,economic struc-
 ture.   The statement of a Bra-
 zilian journalist 15 years ago
 that the southern, temperate-
 zone state of Sao Paulo is a
 locomotive pulling 20 empty
 freight cars--the rest of the
 country--is less true how but
 still has validity.   Sao Paulo
 produces most of the country's
 heavy industrial goods and also
 most of its chief export,
 coffee.

 STATUTE MILES
 Brazil's economic growth
 in the last 15 years has in-
 creased the gross national prod-
 uct  (GNP) by an average of
 5 percent per year in "real"
 terms.   This contrasts with a
 recent decline in productivity
 in neighboring countries.
 Brazil now leads Latin America
 in steel and electric power
 production, but per-capita GNP
 is only now reaching the $250
 to $300 average for the area.
 This results principally
 from the continued inactivity
 of that third of the population
 living in the vast northern
 dust-bowl and jungle areas
 where tropical diseases and
 malnutrition are still common.
 Brazil's development has.
 also been hindered by its his-
 tory of one-crop, boom-and-   '
 bust cycles beginning with sugar
 in the 17th century and suc-
 ceeded in turn by gold and dia-
 monds, cotton, rubber, and now
 coffee.   Because of its present
 dependence on the unstable
 coffee market for over half its
 foreign-exchange earnings and
 because of its costly industrial-
 ization efforts, Brazil suffers
 periodic balance-of-payments
 crises.
 A new balance of payments
 crisis is likely this year, since
 Brazil must make loan repay-
 ments of over $350,000,000 in
 convertible currencies in 1960

 and will probably also have
 a trade deficit, as it has for
 the past four years.  Last year,
 President Kubitschek publicly
 rejected suggestions that he
 institute various financial
 reforms that would make Brazil
 eligible for a stabilization
 loan from the International
 Monetary Fund.   Inflation
 reached the unprecedented
 :Levei of 52 percent in 1959, but
 for .1960'it  may total no more
 than a "normal" 15-25 percent.
 Five-Year Program
 Brazil's first coordinated
 development plan was inaugurated
 in 1956 when Kubitschek took
 office.   Based on studies by
 the defunct Joint Brazil-US
 Economic Development Commission,
 the plan called for an invest-
 ment of $6 billion in the period
 1956-1960--about $2 billion of
 this in foreign exchange--and
 was aimed primarily at eliminat-
 ing  bottlenecks in transporta-
 tion and at production of fuel,
 steel, and electric power.
 The development program
 spells out 30 targets and numer-
 ous subgoals, most of which are
 being met on schedule.   The
 most successful programs have
 been those for power, transport,
 and heavy industry; the least
 successful, those for agricul-
 ture.   No goals were set for
 light industry or consumer goods
 other than food and automobiles,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 April 1960
 but Brazilian law prohibits
 private investment in this field.
 Although oil production has in-
 creased tenfold since 1955,            it
 still supplies less than a third
 of total consumption.
 The development program has
 also attracted interest within
 the Soviet bloc.   A number of
 bloc countries have included
 Brazil in their long-range
 trading plans and have con-
 tracted to supply industrial
 equipment and complete factory
 installations.   Although this
 trade is still negligible in
 terms of Brazil's total,  it
 will probably increase sub-
 stantially in the next few years
 as a result of recent agreements
 with the USSR and Poland.
 In January, Brazil reversed
 its policy of refusing visas to
 Soviet technicians and admitted
 a group of chemical engineers
 to help with studies for a large-
 scale natural-gas plant. Czecho-
 slovakia is supplying Sao Paulo's
 new 132,000-kilowatt Tiete
 River power plant with generat-
 ing equipment on a barter basis.
 The Political Situation
 The development program
 has not been an issue in the
 early campaigning for the 3
 October presidential election.
 The chief opposition candidate,
 colorful                   former    25X6
 Sao Paulo Governor Janio Quadros,
 has attacked various aspects of
 the program,  but his principal
 argument is that he could do
 the job better.   He may also
 hope he can make an issue of
 Kubitschek's relative neglect
 of agrarian matters and his
 refusal to attend Fidel Castro's
 proposed world conference of
 underdeveloped nations. Kubi-
 tschek fears the Cuban confer-
 ence would detract from inter-
 American meetings scheduled for
 this year to discuss his hemis-
 phere development plan, Opera-
 tion Pan America.
 Kubitschek cannot succeed
 himself and is backing his former25X6
 war minister, the scrupulously
 honest
 Marshal Henrique Teixeira Lott.
 Lott, who is strongly pro-US,
 is now riding a wave of pro-
 government sentiment based main-
 ly on the scheduled inauguration
 of Brasilia and the other suc-
 cesses of the development pro-
 gram.   However, a repetition of
 the balance-of-payments crisis  25X1
 or food supply crisis of 1959
 could tip the balance decisively
 toward the opposition.
