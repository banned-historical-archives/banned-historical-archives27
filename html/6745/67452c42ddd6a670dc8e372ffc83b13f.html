2. PROTEST OF CHINESE DEMOCRATIC PARTIT1S AGAINST.BACTMIOLOGICAL WARFARE 
OF AMERICAN IMPMIALISTS 
The American imperialists, in order to make up for their severe 
losses in the Korean war, have been applying bacteriological warfare,' 
violating international conventions and human ,u.stice. Since 28 January 
this year, American imperialists' planes have been dropping numerous in-
sects carrying germs over the front-lines of the Korean People's Army and 
the Chinese Volunteer Force and in the rear areas, to invoke the fury of 
people. When the governments of China and Korea protested to the American 
government, Secretary State of Acheson shamelessly denied the fact. Ameri-
can military planes, during 6 days from 29 February to 5 March, invaded 
even our territory and dropped numerous germ-carrying insects in Musun, 
Shinmin, Antung, etc. This fact discloses the Americans savage intention 
to massacre the Chinese and Korean peoples and their scheme of expanding 
the war. 
All democratic parties of China hereby appeal to all the peace-
loving people of Asia and of the world (including the American and Japanese 
peoples) to mobilize against the imperialist& crimes in bacteriological 
warfare, and for the peace of the world. Justice is on our side. Victory 
will definitely be ours!
