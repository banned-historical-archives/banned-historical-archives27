 Soviet Interest in Industrial Reform
 in Other Communist Countries~~                  25X1
 Soviet commentary on Hungarian, Chinese, and East German industrial
 reforms has increased under General Secretary Gorbachev. Statements
 and actions by regime spokesmen suggest that this increase reflects the
 leadership's heightened interest in assessing the benefits and costs of these
 reforms with an eye to their potential application within the USSR:
 ? In Hungary, the regime's decentralization of industrial management and
 planning and enhancement of the role of market forces, although poorly
 implemented, have improved product quality and increased efficiency,
 but industrial growth has generally been slow, and social and political
 tensions have been fueled by the inflation and widening income dispari-
 ties reform has brought about.
 ? China's more recent and more rapid moves toward decentralization and
 its opening of industry to market forces have led to skyrocketing
 industrial growth but also to overinvestment, serious breakdowns in
 quality control, inflation, a widening gap between rich and poor, and
 widespread corruption among economic officials.
 the Chinese and Hungarian reforms.
 ? East Germany, unlike Hungary and China, has given little play to
 market forces but has opted for a streamlined version of Soviet-style
 central planning that has contributed to increases in industrial growth
 and productivity while avoiding the political and social risks inherent in
 Although all three programs have won positive comment from some Soviet
 observers, Moscow's assessment of the Hungarian and Chinese approaches
 demonstrates its strong concern about the potential loss of centralized
 political control through economic decentralization. Most Soviet observers
 of the Hungarian scene are more impressed with the ideological unortho-
 doxy, political risks, and economic disruptions inherent in Budapest's
 policies than with the economic gains they may bring about.
 And, while Soviet commentators note
 the impressive economic achievements of China's reform efforts, the major  25X1
 focus of their analysis is on the "negative phenomena"-inflation, unem-
 ployment, graft, loss of central control-stemming from the reforms.

 Soviet assessments of East Germany's industrial reorganization efforts, in
 contrast, are uniformly positive. Moscow's attraction to the East German
 system-which maintains tight central control over economic activity-is
 manifest in Gorbachev's own public statements extolling the achievements
 of the East German approach.
 The obvious Soviet preference for the East German "model" mirrors the
 caution that characterizes measures adopted by the Gorbachev regime at
 home. Gorbachev and his colleagues still believe the present system can be
 made to work better. Change in the system-whether based on Communist
 reform models or other ideas-will in all likelihood come slowly and in
 piecemeal fashion when the leadership becomes convinced that shifts in
 investment, better management, and increased discipline will not get the
 job done:
 ? Soviet commentators have suggested that Moscow may pick and choose
 various aspects of the East German, Hungarian, or Chinese experiments
 rather than adopt an entire program.
 ? Most Soviet commentators realize that the conditions that have made
 some of these reforms successful cannot necessarily be duplicated in the
 USSR. Some Soviet economists acknowledge, for example, that East
 Germany's success is due, in part, to the smaller size of its economy and
 the German work ethic. Similarly, Soviet sinologists have pointed out
 that the types of reforms introduced by Beijing have been possible only
 because China is a relatively new socialist country.
 Gorbachev has, nonetheless, dramatically increased the pressure to im-
 prove industrial performance and appears to be much more inclined to
 measure it by results than adherence to ideological orthodoxy and past
 practice. He clearly is pushing his managers to accept more responsibility,
 exercise initiative, and innovate-features of the reform efforts in the three
 Communist countries examined. The boldness Gorbachev has shown in
 changing the style of leadership, opening up cultural expression, making
 personnel changes, and putting forward new foreign policy initiatives
 suggests that he will boldly look for ways to achieve similar economic
 results in the Soviet Union.

 Given the cultural and systemic differences between the Soviet Union and
 East Germany, Hungary, and China, the experience of other Communist
 countries will probably be no more than instructive for the Soviets; the
 answers to Soviet economic problems will probably-as party secretary
 Dobrynin reportedly said recently-come from within. But, despite the
 problems accompanying industrial reform in Eastern Europe and China,
 the successes achieved in other Communist states in promoting growth,
 increasing productivity, improving quality, and pushing technological
 modernization will bolster the arguments of those in the USSR who favor
 change and push the leadership to find solutions that put the Soviet Union
 again in the forefront of socialist development.

 Soviet Interest in Industrial Reform
 in Other Communist Countries ~
 Gorbachev's Industrial Agenda and
 Soviet Interest in Reform
 General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev has frequently
 stated that the improvement of Soviet industrial
 performance is among his most important domestic
 policy goals. In particular, Gorbachev has called for
 an acceleration of industrial growth, an upgrading of
 industrial technology to world standards, an across-
 the-board improvement in product quality, an expan-
 sion of industrial exports, and a sharp increase in the
 productivity of the industrial labor force. In an effort
 to attain these ambitious goals, he has launched a
 "human factor" campaign to tighten labor discipline
 and has embarked upon a costly program to modern-
 ize industrial plant and equipment. In addition, he has
 pledged to "reform" the industrial economic system.'
 Although the General Secretary has provided few
 specifics on his plans for reform, his statements and
 actions strongly suggest that he sees the reform
 experiences of other Communist regimes as a useful
 source of guidance:
 ? Gorbachev himself has publicly praised East Ger-
 many's management of its economy and has stated
 that the Soviet Union could learn from Hungary's
 experience with economic reform.
 ? The Soviet leader has urged the members of the
 Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CEMA)
 to draw upon each other's experiences in the eco-
 nomic sphere and told the 27th Soviet Party Con-
 gress that such exchanges are crucial to the develop-
 ment of socialism.
 ? Soviet media have ended their near silence on
 China's economic reforms and have increased the
 objectivity as well as the frequency of their report-
 ing about them.
 ? Candidate Politburo member Nikolai Talyzin, for-
 merly deputy chief of a Brezhnev-era task force on
 "socialist management in the fraternal countries,"
 has been appointed to head an economic commission
 with a charter that includes the study of foreign
 management experience.
 As Soviet officials and economists have responded to
 Gorbachev's encouragement to examine other social-
 ist models of industrial reform, they have focused
 their attention on the changes in management and
 planning already made or under way in Hungary,
 China, and East Germany. Soviet commentators have
 given little indication that Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
 Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia are regarded as
 potential models for the USSR, probably because the
 first four are seen as having accomplished little or
 nothing with reform and Yugoslavia has pushed
 changes that would be considered beyond the econom-
 ic and political pale.
 Hungary
 Among the reform models that have been the object
 of Soviet scrutiny, Hungary's has been uniquely long
 lived, albeit with temporary retrenchments. In 1968,
 under the leadership of Janos Kadar, the Hungarians
 introduced a "New Economic Mechanism" designed
 to increase industry's productivity, boost industrial

 exports, and make industrial enterprises more respon-
 sive to their customers' demands for new and better
 products. Under the terms of the NEM:
 ? Enterprises were to move toward aself-financing
 and self-regulating regime, with their managers
 given greater responsibility for raising investment
 funds and greater control over wages.
 ? Industrial prices were to be made more reflective of
 actual production costs, and foreign exchange rates
 were to be made more realistic.
 ? Some enterprises were to be allowed to engage
 directly in foreign trade and retain a portion of their
 hard currency earnings.
 ? The scope of central planning was to be greatly
 reduced and enterprises required to generate profits
 by responding to market signals. Overall output
 targets, however, were still to be determined by
 central planners, and investments in infrastructure
 and defense industries as well as CEMA trade
 obligations were still to be established at the center.
 Resistance to the reforms from party bureaucrats and
 workers and Soviet skepticism about decentralization
 led Kadar to pull back from his reform drive in the
 early 1970s. Recentralizing moves to solve such
 emerging problems as excessive labor turnover and
 overinvestment, along with the shocks of oil price rises
 and the Western recession later in the 1970s, further
 set back the NEM.
 By the end of the 1970s, however, the reintensification
 of pre-NEM problems renewed interest in reform. A
 "new phase"-intended to increase enterprise inde-
 pendence, spur competitiveness, and enhance market
 forces-was inaugurated at the April 1984 Central
 Committee plenum. The new reforms stressed the
 need for expanding enterprise powers to determine
 commodity mix and engage directly in foreign trade;
 continued the selective breakup of large, inefficient
 enterprises into smaller units; provided for workers in
 some industrial enterprises to participate in the selec-
 tion of enterprise directors and the formulation of
 investment plans; and began decentralizing the bank-
 ing system to foster competition and improve capital
 allocation. In addition, the ministerial bureaucracy
 was streamlined by melding three industrial minis-
 tries into one; the price structure was further rational-
 ized by reducing subsidies and turnover taxes; regula-
 tions on price formation were liberalized; and
 incentives for individual workers and enterprises were
 enhanced by tying wages more directly to profits.Z
 According to Western observers of the Hungarian
 scene and some Hungarian commentators, Budapest's
 implementation of these "new phase" reforms, as well
 as of the original 1968 reforms, has been superficial
 and unfocused, and the country's industrial perfor-
 mance has reflected this. Industrial output grew an
 average of only about 2 percent from 1975 to 1985. In
 addition, the economy still suffers from low labor
 productivity and other problems that prompted the
 1968 reforms and is saddled with large debts to the
 West and 7-percent inflation (according to official
 Hungarian figures for 1985). To secure abalance-of-
 payments surplus for servicing Hungary's foreign debt
 and maintaining its creditworthiness, Budapest has
 cut back on imports and investment, which has con-
 tributed to a stagnation of living standards and a
 consequent rise in social tensions. In the judgment of
 some Western observers, political dissidence has also
 increased as a result of the disappointment of popular
 expectations that the reforms aroused.
 At the same time, the expanded independence of
 industrial enterprises to compete with each other for
 profits at home and abroad is credited by most
 Western analysts with markedly improving the com-
 modity mix and the quality of manufactured goods.
 Greater responsiveness to the market has brought
 supply and demand into better balance and contribut-
 ed to efficiency by reducing waste; competition, effi-
 ciency, and financial discipline should be fostered

 further by the bankruptcy law that took effect on
 1 September, allowing the liquidation of chronic loss-
 making companies. Western visitors to Hungary also
 note a general atmosphere of energy and initiative
 among industrial managers that contrasts with the
 caution and "business-as-usual" approach character-
 istic of their counterparts in the other, more tightly
 controlled, East European regimes.
 China
 Of all the Communist models of industrial reform
 available to the Soviets, China's is the most far
 reaching and the one that has enjoyed the greatest
 recent success. Launched in the late 1970s, the Chi-
 nese reform drive initially focused on the agricultural
 sector. Some experiments with decentralized, profit-
 oriented industrial reforms, however, were begun in
 selected Chinese factories in 1979, and "special eco-
 nomic zones" were established to encourage foreign
 investment at three (ultimately four) Chinese trading
 centers. Encouraged by the success of these initial
 industrial reforms, the October 1984 Plenum of the
 Communist Party formally approved the following set
 of measures aimed at ensuring continued improve-
 ment in industrial performance:
 ? The scope of central planning was to be reduced and
 market forces were to be allowed gradually to
 determine more economic activity; economic stabil-
 ity was to be maintained by means of monetary and
 fiscal policies.
 ? Enterprise managers were to be given more author-
 ity over planning, marketing, wages, and investment
 to improve efficiency, productivity, and product
 quality; vertical monopolies were to be broken up;
 and competition was to be encouraged among eco-
 nomic units. The state, however, was to continue to
 control the production and distribution of essential
 commodities and major investment decisions.
 ? The role of the government and party in day-to-day
 business operations was to be reduced.
 ? While administered pricing was retained for key
 products, prices of many other products were to
 fluctuate within bounds set by the government, and
 prices of nonstaples and minor consumer goods were
 to be determined by supply and demand alone.
 China's industrial reform effort has achieved impres-
 sive rates of growth, but the results are disappointing
 and even disturbing in other respects. Figures on last
 year's economic performance released by the State
 Statistical Bureau show 18-percent growth in indus-
 trial output. The growth in industrial output in the
 first two quarters of 1985 was so high, however, that
 it threatened to overwhelm the existing transportation  25X1
 and commercial systems, which had already been
 seriously strained by skyrocketing agricultural pro-
 duction. In addition, investment spending has been
 excessive, increasing 35 percent in 1985 alone. Chi-
 nese media commentary suggests that Beijing, while
 convinced that rapid growth is proof that industrial
 reforms are working, is concerned that accompanying
 economic and social tensions ultimately could under-
 mine the reforms. Media reports also indicate that
 industrial efficiency and product quality may be
 harmed by rapid growth.
 This success in boosting growth already has had
 negative side effects. The yearend statistical report
 acknowledged 9-percent inflation (triple the rate in
 1984) and a record $15 billion trade deficit. The drive
 to make the economy more efficient has resulted in
 widening income disparities and consumer grumbling
 over rising food prices. Relaxing economic controls
 and opening up the economic system to foreign trade
 and investment have, by the admission of the Chinese
 themselves, sparked widespread graft, bribery, and
 other types of economic corruption.   25X1
 Earlier this year, in recognition of these problems, the
 regime decreed that the reform drive be slowed to
 allow the economic system to adjust to the reforms
 already introduced. Beijing has made it clear, howev-
 er, that further reforms are in the offing, perhaps
 within a year. The session of the Sixth National
 People's Congress that ended on 12 April endorsed
 further ambitious reforms to be implemented from
 1987 to 1990, reflecting the continued political
 strength of proreform leaders

 Secret
 East Germany
 East Germany, which launched the "New Economic
 System" in 1963-two years before the Soviets'
 "Kosygin Reforms" and five years before Hungary's
 NEM-was the first country in the Soviet Bloc to opt
 for decentralizing reforms. In 1971, however, the new
 Honecker regime abandoned this reformist course,
 among other things, for not having achieved rapid
 growth and high living standards. East Berlin instead
 embarked upon a recentralizing course, and over the
 next several years developed a version of centralized
 industrial management and planning that is much
 closer to the Soviet system than to the systems that
 exist in contemporary Hungary and China. Problems
 with that system also emerged, however, and since the
 late 1970s East Germany has made a number of
 primarily organizational changes designed to improve
 economic performance
 Under the current East German variant of socialist
 industrial management and planning:
 ? The centralized decisionmaking structure is re-
 tained, with extensive use of administrative regula-
 tions to direct the behavior of enterprises.
 ? Industrial enterprises are grouped into "combines,"
 which provide greater focus on specific production
 tasks, promote economies of scale, reduce admini-
 strative redundancies, and streamline decisionmak-
 ing. Combine directors are granted broad powers to
 manage the operation of their enterprises, within
 centrally imposed guidelines, and are personally
 responsible for their performance, including the
 accelerated introduction of new technology.
 ? Many foreign trade enterprises are linked directly to
 combines to improve coordination and promote ex-
 ports to hard currency countries.
 ? New performance criteria designed to cut costs,
 boost efficiency, and stimulate exports have been
 introduced.
 ? New positive and negative financial incentives have
 been implemented, including increased bonuses and
 steep wage taxes imposed on combines to reduce
 wasteful use of labor.
 Although its industry remains inefficient by Western
 standards, East Germany has recently scored impres-
 sive productivity gains. According to our estimates,
 for example, industrial labor productivity increased
 nearly 6 percent last year. The government also
 reported that production costs fell sharply.
 In recent East German writings, the introduction of
 industrial combines or Kombinate (see inset) is ac-
 corded much of the credit for the industry's successes.
 In the judgment of East German officials and econo-
 mists, the combines represent a successful attempt to
 secure the benefits of partially decentralized opera-
 tional management without relinquishing central con-
 trol over basic policy and resource allocations.
 By "rationalizing" centralization and thus reaffirm-
 ing it as a principle, rather than calling it into
 question with decentralizing reforms, the East Ger-
 mans have avoided the ideological and political debate
 currently under way in China and the social tensions
 fed by Hungary's decentralized, but in many respects
 poorly performing, economic system. According to
 Western analysts, consumer grumbling, while com-
 mon in East Germany, is not a serious problem for the
 regime, and in recent years East Germany's industrial
 policy has not been politically contentious.
 The Soviet leadership has always been sensitive to
 developments in other Communist countries, particu-
 larly those within the Soviet orbit. For the most part,
 Soviet interest has been driven by concern that modi-
 fying the fundamentals of socialist practice could
 endanger political control, serve as a bad example for
 other Communist states, erode Soviet influence, and

 Secret
 East Germany's Industrial Combines
 Industrial combines, or Kombinate, in East Germany
 link enterprises that produce the same or similar
 products, use similar technologies, or represent vari-
 ous stages ctJ'the production cycle.
 The major functions of a combine are:
 ? To combine in a single entity all the phases of
 .production from research and development to sales.
 ? To give constituent enterprises access to larger
 investments and better management services than
 an individual enterprise might be able to secure on
 its own.
 ? To achieve economies of scale, centralization of
 somelunctionsfor greater e~"iciency, and pooling of
 managerial talent.
 ? To speed the flow g1'irtformation both toward the
 center and horizontally among enterprises and com-
 bines, facilitating coordination.
 Combines are directly subordinate to their respective
 industrial-branch ministries, which delegate some
 planning activities to the combine director general but
 which retain considerable power to intervene at the
 provide a possible propaganda windfall to the West.
 The Soviet regime has used public and private com-
 mentary on such developments to signal its concern,
 reinforce internal opposition to such changes in these
 countries, and possibly limit the scope for greater
 experimentation.
 While these motives still underlie some Soviet com-
 mentary, the Soviet leadership has become more
 interested in the results of Communist reform efforts
 as the Kremlin's own economy has lost momentum.
 Because Moscow has tolerated some tinkering with
 the standard Soviet formula in Eastern Europe, this
 experience has become a source of quasi-legitimate
 ideas for proponents of reform and a practical testbed
 for them. But, given the fierce opposition in some
 combine and even enterprise level. Enterprises within
 a combine retain their status as distinct legal entities
 and maintain their own management structures and
 cost accounting (khozraschet), but many management
 responsibilities that werelormerly the domain c31'the

 some of their former responsibilities, central planning
 agencies can concentrate on broader strategies for
 economic development, a refocusing Gorbachev has
 called for in the Soviet economy.
 Combines draw up their own annual plan proposals in
 line with indicators provided by the State Planning
 Commission, but it is unclear how much i~uence a
 combine director actually has, as distinct lrom that
 of his minister, on details of the final plan for his

 tive system lags the combines' progress in allocation

 on this experience and its results has become an arena
 for jousting over internal reform.
 Gorbachev's calls for "radical reform" and "revolu-
 tionary change" have intensified this battle of ideas.
 Western visitors to the Soviet Union and Western
 embassy officials in Moscow have reported that Soviet
 officials and economists have grown increasingly will-

 nents and opponents of change know that the ultimate
 winners of the current debate could gain the upper

 these experiences are not suitable for replication in
 the USSR, the assessment of their success or failure
 could spur or retard the search for solutions to the
 problems that plague the Soviet economy and, more
 important, affect the pace and direction of change in
 the Soviet Union.
 Mixed Feelings About Hungary's Approach
 Although the Soviets have generally acquiesced in
 Hungary's experiments for almost two decades, their
 public commentary has long suggested that they have
 done so only grudgingly. While applauding Hungary's
 efforts to increase productivity and its success in
 making its products competitive on international mar-
 kets, the Soviets have indicated concern that the
 decentralization of economic decision making and
 encouragement of private initiative might weaken
 Hungary's Communist character. During Gorba-
 chev's tenure, the Soviets have continued to react to
 Hungarian reforms with a mixture of admiring inter-
 est and distaste.
 Gorbachev himself evidently is of two minds on
 Budapest's reformist policies. During his visit to Hun-
 gary in June 1986, he expressed approval of Buda-
 pest's official policy of economic renewal and encour-
 aged further efforts to overcome remaining problems.
 He did not, however, give Hungarian economic re-
 forms the endorsement the Kadar regime almost
 certainly had hoped for, or single out measures that
 could be applied in the Soviet Union or elsewhere in
 the Bloc (see inset).
 This is not the first time I have been in Budapest; and
 the latest meeting in your beautiful capital and
 acquaintance with the factory are grounds for saying
 that the country is living at a good working pace.
 Here, with you in Csepel, one feels that atmosphere
 that I know so well from meetings with Soviet labor
 collectives, of taking an interest not only in the affairs
 of one's own enterprise, but also in those of the
 country. The desire to work not in the old way, but as
 the present time requires, is apparent.
 The Soviet Union's course is clear. It has been
 approved by the congress, by the whole party, by the
 people. But the tactics, methods, and forms of imple-
 mentation of the course mapped out are still to be
 finally developed and specified on the basis, of course,
 of everything that has been verified in practice in our
 country as well as in the fraternal countries. The
 countries of the socialist community have one more
 source of acceleration that our party intends to use,
 and to a fuller extent. This is the exchange of
 experience in building up socialism. The CPSU re-
 gards with attention and respect the search for solu-
 tions to difficult economic and social tasks that is
 being conducted in your country, in Hungary, and in
 other socialist countries. We are glad to see achieve-
 ments of friends and try to take everything that is
 useful and suitable for our country. It goes without
 saying-and we know it from our own experience-
 that nobody is completely ensured against failures and
 miscalculations. But we Communists have a decisive
 criterion of the justification of the experiment, of its
 rightness. This criterion is the strengthening of social-
 ism in practice, in all spheres-economic, political,
 and spiritual.

 In June 1985 a Soviet political commentator using the
 pseudonym "O. Vladimirov" attacked "revisionist,
 nationalist concepts" such as economic decentraliza-
 tion and greater use of the market mechanism. The
 article was widely interpreted by Hungarian officials
 as an attack on Budapest's policies. The Hungarians'
 concern grew when, several days later, Yegor Liga-
 chev, the number-two man in the Soviet party leader-
 ship, sounded the same themes in a speech. Soviet
 officials reportedly reassured the Hungarians subse-
 quently that the Vladimirov article was not an author-

 in the Soviet journal Kommunist, the deputy Secre-
 tary General of the Hungarian party published a

 grounds. A senior official of the Academy of Sciences
 International Institute of the Economics of the World
 Hungary's reforms, however, continue to have enthu-
 Significantly, Soviet media have praised Hungary's
 economic achievements in those areas in which the
 Gorbachev regime sees room for improvement in the
 Soviet Union. In August 1985, Izvestiya, for example,
 described the Hungarians' success in putting their
 scientific research institutes on more of a self-financ-
 ing basis, thereby saving state funds and promoting
 the application of scientific and technological ad-
 vances to industrial production. The Soviets adopted a
 similar approach to research self-financing at about
 the same time as the Hungarians but evidently have
 either been unable or unwilling to implement it
 consistently.
 Moscow also has commended Budapest's successes in
 raising industrial efficiency. In late December, a
 yearend review article on Hungary in Pravda praised
 Budapest's efforts in reducing resource use. An article
 in Izvestiya last April cited a Hungarian official
 approvingly for urging further technological progress
 as an important path to resource conservation.
 The Soviet press has also had some recent praise for
 Hungarian enterprise independence. In a lengthy
 article in the Soviet journal Socialist Industry in
 early June, a "special correspondent" hailed the free-
 dom of Hungarian enterprises-"greater than in our
 country"-to determine their own economic activities,
 respond to market signals, and satisfy consumers'
 demands. Even the right of enterprises to help choose
 their own directors and the refusal of the government
 to subsidize chronically inefficient and unprofitable
 enterprises were noted approvingly.
 Some Soviet economists and academics have willingly
 speculated that aspects of the Hungarian reform
 experience could have application to the Soviet
 Union-almost always, however, portraying Hunga-
 ry's reforms as a collection of potentially transferable
 units rather than as an indivisible system. The Soviets
 also acknowledge that differences in size and culture
 between the two countries most likely would impede
 the Soviet Union's borrowing from Hungary. The
 Hungarian economy is so small, for example, that
 there are only a few enterprises in many branches of
 production, and the process of decentralization thus

 sociologists have noted Hungarian workers' willing-
 ness to put in long hours and extra effort to improve
 their lot, something these sociologists contend the
 "average Russian worker" is unwilling to do.
 Strong Reservations About China's Reforms
 Moscow's public comment on China's economic re-
 forms has grown markedly since Gorbachev came to
 power and has been even more frequent since the
 recent Soviet party congress. Although due, in part, to
 the Soviets' desire to affirm a strong interest in
 improving political relations with Beijing, this in-
 crease in commentary probably also is a response to
 the new regime's efforts to encourage domestic discus-
 sion of possible paths to Soviet economic reform.
 Soviet media regularly have noted the impressive
 growth figures racked up by Chinese industry. In mid-
 March, Pravda, for example, recited China's official
 figures for 1985 output, productivity, and average
 worker's income, and noted that "(plan) targets were
 mainly fulfilled or overfulfilled." Outspoken support-
 ers of the Chinese reforms, such as journalist Fedor
 Burlatskiy, have published enthusiastic reports on the
 booming economy and the happier and more prosper-
 ous Chinese population
 Usually, however, Soviet commentary focuses on in-
 flation, unemployment, graft, and the other "negative
 phenomena" produced by Beijing's sweeping econom-
 ic reform drive. Widening income disparities have
 figured particularly prominently in Moscow's apprais-
 als. The Soviets have also noted the economic costs of
 China's pursuit of rapid growth. An article in Ekono-
 micheskaia Gazeta in June criticized the "poor quali-.
 ty of output, low economic efficiency, and recurrences
 of disproportionate pursuit of higher growth rates and
 expansion of the scale of capital construction to the
 detriment of improved structure of production and
 with no consideration for society's financial and mate-
 rial potential." The Gorbachev regime, which is itself
 intent on boosting growth, may see particularly dis-
 turbing lessons in this aspect of China's recent experi-
 ence with reform.
 In appraising the Chinese scene in their media, the
 Soviets employ the familiar tactic of quoting indige-
 nous critics rather than expressing criticism them-
 selves. Last September, for example, TASS was able
 to cite Deng as well as Chen Yun, a critic of the
 reforms whose outspoken comments on Beijing's poli-
 cies the Soviets often quote: "Deng Xiaoping in his
 speech noted `phenomena of bourgeois liberalization,
 degradation, and decay,' which appeared as a result of
 the abuses that came in the wake of economic re-
 forms. Chen Yun in his speech noted the spreading
 `harmful craze which undermines the party's
 prestige.' "The Chinese leadership's willingness to
 permit open debate on economic and ideological issues
 provides Soviet critics with much grist for their mill.
 The private views of Soviet officials, economists, and
 scholars on the Chinese reforms cover a far broader
 range than those presented in the media. Some ex-
 perts echo the economic, political, and ideological
 concerns expressed in the press. A senior researcher at
 the USA Institute told US Embassy officials last
 November that China's attempt to find a middle road
 between the "two extremes"-that of central plan-
 ning, as exemplified by the Soviet economy, and the
 free play of market forces as in the United States-
 was doomed to failure and that Beijing ultimately
 would have to choose one or the other. Shortly after
 his appointment in July 1985, the new director of the
 Academy of Sciences Far East Institute (IFE) told a
 visiting US official that China's new economic poli-
 cies were promoting social instability and discontent.
 Other Soviet observers, however, have been more
 enthusiastic about the profound changes taking place
 in China, and some have been openly hopeful that the
 Soviet leadership may be inspired to undertake simi-
 larly broad reforms. In early February, the head of
 the Far Eastern Department of the Institute on
 Scientific Information in the Social Sciences told a
 visiting US sinologist that the Chinese economic
 reforms were "reasonable and healthy," and IFE
 scholars assured the same visitor that an abiding
 commitment to socialism underlay the reforms.

 Most Soviet experts willing to discuss the applicability
 of China's reforms to the Soviet economy, however,
 have discounted the prospect of Soviet emulation of

 respective levels of economic development.
 Cultural and historical differences make it even less
 likely that the Soviets would be willing or able to
 follow the Chinese path. A prominent Soviet journal-
 ist told US Embassy officials shortly after Gorba-
 chev's accession that the type of reforms introduced

 The Soviets clearly are unwilling to make the psycho-
 logical leap of according China's reformed economy

 High-Level Praise for the East German System
 Since Gorbachev's election as General Secretary, the
 Soviet attitude toward East Germany's management
 and planning system and its industrial performance
 has been one of unqualified approval and encourage-
 ment. Gorbachev himself has publicly praised the
 East Germans' management of their economy (see
 inset).
 In addition, the Soviets have provided the East Ger-
 man leadership with a forum in which to sing its own
 praises. In October 1985, for example, Honecker
 expatiated in Pravda on his country's economic per-
 formance in an article so lengthy and detailed it
 appeared that the Soviets were holding up East
 Germany as an example to other socialist countries.
 More recently, on the eve of the CPSU party con-
 gress, Politburo member and Party Secretary for
 Economics Mittag was permitted to hold forth at
 equal length on East German economic success in an
 article in Izvestiya. Honecker also delivered a speech
 to the Soviet party congress that emphasized the
 accomplishments of East German industry.
 Much Soviet commentary on the East German econo-
 my, like statements by the East Germans themselves,
 credits the combine system with "rationalizing pro-
 duction" and generally improving industrial perfor-
 mance. In April 1985 in Izvestiya, Otto Latsis, an

 Speech in Leningrad to Party aktiv,

 Many people remember that at one time, when the
 [Soviet] associations were being organized, instruc-
 tions were given that they should be set up on the
 basis of enterprises, irrespective of the departments
 and territorial units to which these belonged. But, in
 fact, associations were created not even within the
 framework of ministries for particular industries, but
 within the framework of all-union production associa-
 tions. Under limited conditions like those, naturally it
 was not possible to form a rational and effective
 network of associations. Now the formation of
 interindustry associations must be supported in every
 way. This is a promising thing, as is shown by the
 experience of the fraternal countries, and first and
 foremost that of the GDR.

 advancement. Your experience of merging science

 lin's efforts to streamline and improve its economic
 management mechanism probably gives Moscow hope
 that it can achieve the same results without paying
 Soviet counterparts.
 In private discussion of the East German approach to
 industrial management, Soviet economists have ech-
 oed Moscow's public praise and described East Ber-
 lin's methods as having applicability to the Soviet
 economy. Still, although full of praise for the East
 German system and willing to speculate about the
 .adaptation of certain East German methods, many
 Soviet economists and other academics have ex-
 pressed skepticism about the success of a total trans-
 figuration of the Soviet economic system along East
 German lines. Most of this pessimism has focused on
 the respective levels of skill, dedication, and individual
 enterprise of German workers and managers and their
 Prospects and Implications
 In light of such expressions of skepticism-and the
 even stronger Soviet reservations about the applicabil-
 ity of the Hungarian and Chinese reform programs to
 the USSR-the Soviet Union is unlikely to opt for the
 wholesale adoption of any other country's approach to
 the improvement of its industrial management and
 planning system. As a Soviet commentator recently
 told a Hungarian television audience, the Soviets
 "intend to solve their own problems starting out from
 their own experiences."
 Still, as the same commentator also suggested, the
 Soviets evidently see merit in what might be termed a
 "smorgasbord" approach to reform: borrowing and
 adapting specific measures to address specific eco-
 nomic problems, rather than adopting a new economic
 system wholesale. To judge from what Gorbachev
 himself has said, the foreign socialist management
 innovation that the Soviets are most likely to emulate
 is the East German system of industrial combines.
 Less authoritative Soviet commentary also suggests
 that Moscow might imitate Hungary's and China's
 moves to strengthen the financial independence of
 industrial enterprises and to promote industrial joint
 ventures with Western firms. In each of these cases,
 however, it is doubtful that the Soviets would be able
 or inclined to reproduce the conditions that have
 contributed to whatever success these measures have
 enjoyed in East Germany, Hungary, and China.
 Even if East Germany's industrial management struc-
 ture could be duplicated in the USSR, for example,
 the great difference in size between the Soviet and
 East German economies could prevent replication of
 some of the more successful elements of the combine
 system. One important means by which the East
 German leadership ensures the effective functioning
 of the two-tier, ministry-combine structure is semian-
 nual meetings in East Berlin with all the combine
 directors in the country. An equivalent convention in
 the Soviet Union would be so huge that it would be
 unmanageable. The Soviet leadership would have to
 fall back on its traditional methods of addressing
 large gatherings and disseminating written directives,
 which preclude the very sort of input from below that
 distinguishes the East German system.
 Another likely constraint on Soviet success with the  25X1
 East German "model" would be the Soviet system's
 lack of the elusive quality of "Germanness." Removed

 from the unique matrix of political expectations,
 social aspirations, and cultural predilections in which
 they developed, East German economic methods
 could have unpredictable results or wither entirely.
 The Soviets could theoretically improve the basic
 education of their work force and establish an appren-
 ticeship system to train it more thoroughly, as the
 East Germans have done. They could also, as seems
 likely, press forward with their "human factor" cam-
 paign. But the question remains whether they could
 make workers less corrupt, better disciplined ...more
 Soviet efforts to strengthen the financial indepen-
 dence of industrial enterprises along Hungarian and
 Chinese lines would also be likely to encounter prob-
 lems. To judge from
 accounts in the open press, Soviet officials and econo-
 mists have been favorably impressed with the positive
 impact that enhancing enterprise financial indepen-
 dence has had on industrial performance in Hungary
 and China alike. The Soviets have had particular
 praise for Budapest's success in reducing wasteful use
 of equipment, labor, and materials by requiring indus-
 trial enterprises and scientific research institutes to
 finance their own operations and a portion of their
 investment and allowing them to retain much of what
 they save from economizing on resources.
 At the same time, the Soviets have expressed reluc-
 tance to accompany such an expansion of enterprise
 responsibilities with an expansion of enterprise rights
 in such areas as the setting of prices and the firing of
 unneeded personnel-moves that are an important
 part of Hungarian-style self-financing. The Soviets'
 reluctance to do so is understandable, for such moves
 run the risk of contributing to inflation and unemploy-
 ment. Still, in the absence of such accompanying
 measures, Soviet emulation of Hungarian efforts to
 enhance enterprise independence from central plan-
 ners would be unlikely to yield comparable resource
 savings.
 Similar problems would cloud the prospects for Soviet
 emulation of China's mixed experience with special
 economic zones (see inset) and joint ventures between
 its industrial enterprises and Western firms. Soviet
 leaders recognize the potential benefits for the Soviet
 Union in the implementation of such ventures, and
 feelers have been put out to some Western firms.
 Moscow almost certainly would find the prospect of
 direct legal access to Western technology and exper-
 tise appealing. It is highly unlikely, however, that the
 Soviets would be willing to concede to potential
 Western partners the rights and status they enjoy in
 joint ventures with the Chinese.
 loath to cede any control over the operations of an
 enterprise on Soviet soil.
 The Soviets' obvious preference for the East German
 approach mirrors the caution reflected in the mea-
 sures so far adopted at home. Gorbachev and compa-
 ny apparently believe that more can be done with the
 current Soviet system.
 The boldness Gorbachev has shown in changing the
 style of leadership, opening up cultural expression,
 making personnel changes, and putting forward new
 foreign policy initiatives, however, suggests that he
 will aggressively look for ways to. improve Soviet
 economic performance. He is pushing his managers to
 accept more responsibility, exercise initiative, and
 innovate-features of the reform efforts in the three
 Communist countries examined. Given the cultural
 and systemic differences between the Soviet. Union
 and its Communist neighbors, the experience of the

 China's jour special economic zones (SEZs) were
 established in 1979 as the.flagships of Deng Xiao-
 ping spolicy of "opening to the outside. " By far the
 largest ojthe SEZs is Shenzhen, initially a small
 fishing village bordering Hong Kong that has grown
 in the past six years into a city of more than 250,000
 residents.
 The SEZs were designed to act as "windows"
 through which the Chinese could study advanced
 Western production technology and management
 methods, while keeping out undesirable aspects of
 Western culture. More than simple export processing
 zones, the SEZs are cities with special administrative
 status in which the Chinese allow a hybrid of capital-
 ist and socialist systems to exist. The Chinese expect-
 ed to attract investment in the SEZs by Western
 manufacturers through a combination of tax breaks,
 reduced redtape, and modern infrastructure. After an
 initial period of Chinese investment in infrastructure,
 the SEZs were to generate foreign exchange for the
 Chinese by catering to the export market.
 Mounting problems, however, forced Deng to publicly
 admit in early 1985 that the SEZs had not yet turned
 out the way he had hoped:
 ? Despite great expenditures to develop infrastruc-
 ture, the SEZs have attracted little Western manu-
 facturinginvestment. China's hopes of gaining ac-
 cess to Western production technology through the
 SEZs have remained largely urtfuUilled, outside of
 a few showcase projects.
 ? Instead of generating foreign exchange, the SEZs
 have become net drains on China'sloreign exchange
 reserves: in 1984, roughly two-thirds of Shenzhen's
 production was being sold in China's domestic
 market.
 ? The zones have become centers for black-market
 currency speculation, smuggling, and otherforms of
 corruption, much of it carried on by Chinese
 o.~cials.
 Problems with the SEZs have provided a rallying
 point for critics of Deng s "opening to the outside. "
 Some Chinese o,~cials have used these problems to
 express their discontent over the inequities of China's
 recent foreign trade policies and have charged that
 Beijing has lost control over foreign trade by granting
 too much trade autonomy to localities. Deng himself
 withdrew his wholehearted support from the SEZs.
 China will not abandon the SEZs, but the zones no
 longer enjoy the privileged status of a few years ago.
 State fundingfor zone development has been frozen
 or cut back, and plans to develop export processing
 zones in 14 coastal cities have been scaled down. SEZ
 leaders are under the gun to produce concrete results
 in developing exports, controlling corruption, and
 attracting the right kind ojjoreign investment. Al-
 though SEZ leaders are claiming improved results in
 developing exports and attracting investment, the
 zones face tough going as these leaders attempt to
 justlfY Beijing's input of both funds and political
 support.
