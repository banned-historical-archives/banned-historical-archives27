 LEBANON
 The Arab summit conference that con-
 vened in Cairo on October 25 endorsed
 the Lebanon settlement worked out by the
 leaders of five Arab states and the
 Palestine Liberation Organization in
 Riyadh last week. The full summit was
 unable to agree, however, on the composi-
 tion of the expanded Arab League
 peacekeeping force that will police the
 provisions of the accord, and the delay in
 organizing the force has reduced the
 chances that the combatants will begin
 withdrawing voluntarily.
 Arab League Secretary General Riyad
 Golan
 0 Kilometers  30
 positions-which have become in-
 creasingly indefensible-to Arab League
 forces. They may balk, however, at giving
 them up to peacekeeping units that are
 almost entirely Syrian, and they are un-
 likely to withdraw if the Christians make
 it clear they will not reciprocate.
 The Christians apparently expect-and
 may well be hoping for-a renewal of the
 fighting in another week or so. Shamun
 has noted publicly that the five-day period
 specified in the Riyadh accord for Palesti-
 nian withdrawal from the mountains and
 the south has now expired with no sign of
 Palestinian  compliance-an  implicit
 threat that the Christians may resume the
 fight.
 EGYPT   Z,
 The reconciliation between Egypt and
 Syria during the summit meeting of six
 Arab leaders in Riyadh last week was an
 abrupt about-face for President Sadat.
 The Egyptian President now appears anx-
 ious to promote Arab solidarity before
 attempting to press the US to resume
 Middle East peace negotiations after the
 presidential election.
 Other moves by Sadat also seem
 designed to put the US and Israel on
 notice that Egypt will urge new
 negotiations. Egypt's call on October 20
 for the UN Security Council to discuss
 Israel's "repressive measures" in the oc-
 cupied territories is a gesture of solidarity
 with the Arabs and a pressure tactic
 against the US.
 The Egyptians' efforts to arrange a
 meeting between Foreign Minister Fahmi
 and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko
 are probably also intended in part to exert
 pressure on the US for early movement in
 negotiations.
 Sadat's reconciliation with Syria is the
 most significant of his recent moves. The
 UN initiative and the overture to the
 has been given the job of hammering out
 arrangements for the peacekeeping force
 with the countries that have offered
 troops-Syria, both Yemens, the United
 Arab Emirates, Sudan, Saudi Arabia,
 Libya, and "Palestine"-and with
 Lebanese President Sarkis, who osten-
 sibly has the final say on who will be
 allowed to join.
 Regardless of the mix Riyad comes up
 with, it seems clear the Arab leaders have
 confirmed Syria's domination of the
 force. The Arab states have not only
 legitimized Syria's intervention in
 Lebanon but even agreed to bankroll it:
 the summit voted to provide some $62
 million-largely from Saudi Arabia and
 Kuwait-to meet expenses of the security
 force over the next six months.
 Despite sporadic shelling in all parts of
 the country, the cease-fire has generally
 held up during the past week everywhere
 except in the south, where Christian
 troops with some Israeli support-largely
 in the form of artillery fire from inside
 Israel's own border-have been fighting
 to clear Palestinians and Lebanese
 Muslims out of the border area. Although
 the Christians have not yet succeeded in
 taking Bint Jubayl or Mays al-Jabal,
 which are under siege, they seem to have
 successfully established effective control
 of the area between Rumaysh and the
 Arqub, which for years has been the prin-
 cipal staging base for fedayeen operations
 against Israel.
 Signs of strain between the Syrians and
 the Christians have begun to surface. Ex-
 tremist Christian leader Camille Shamun
 has stated publicly that he will refuse to
 allow  Arab  peacekeeping  forces-
 presumably  including  Syrian                                                       troops
 operating in that capacity-into areas
 under Christian control, and the Chris-
 tians have been talking of forming "se-
 curity forces" of their own to police
 their areas.
 The Palestinians, for their part, seem
 prepared  to  turn  over  their

 Soviets are largely tactical steps that cost
 Sadat little. The rapprochement with
 Asad, however, has involved important
 concessions.
 Sadat has been able to carry off the
 reconciliation gracefully; Asad apparently
 did not during the Riyadh meeting
 challenge Egypt's adherence to the second
 Sinai agreement, a principal bone of con-
 tention between the two. Sadat none-
 theless  in  effect  recognized  Syria's
 supremacy in Lebanon. His policies
 toward both Syria and Lebanon have until
 now been governed by a refusal to con-
 cede this Syrian pre-eminence.
 A number of factors probably con-
 tributed to Sadat's turnaround. Saudi
 pressure no doubt had some effect. Sadat
 probably also concluded that his efforts to
 stop Syria have been unavailing and have
 done Egypt more harm than good.
 The most important factor was Sadat's
 realization-somewhat  belated-that
 only by cooperating with Syria could he
 expect to achieve early progress in Middle
 East peace negotiations.
 He has undoubtedly hoped throughout
 the last year to bring about that coopera-
 tion on his own terms, but he now seems
 to recognize that, with a new US
 presidential term about to begin, there is
 USSR-SYRIA
 The Soviets may be trying to l5ress the
 Syrians to stop military operations in
 Lebanon.
 The Soviet defense attache recently
 remarked that the USSR is fulfilling its
 present military contracts with the
 Syrians, but he refused to be+drawn out on
 the subject of new arms brders. Since
 mid-July, seven Soviet arms carriers have
 arrived at Syrian ports; the most recent
 delivery was on October 4.
 In public, Soviet criticism of the Syrian
 role in Lebanon is couched in terms that
 minimize Soviet-Syrian differences. The
 Soviets presumably believe that a cessa-
 tion of military deliveries, while not affec-
 ting short-term Syrian capabilities against
 the Palestinians, would have dire conse-
 quences for their own relations with Syria.
 EGYPTIAN ELECTION / I
 On October 28, Egypt held its first
 parliamentary election in which can-
 didates were legally permitted to run on
 opposition platforms.
 Approximately 1,600 candidates vied
 for 350 People's Assembly seats in a
 carefully  regulated  experiment  with
 something akin to a multiparty system.
 The Arab Socialist Union remains
 Egypt's only legal political party, but
 President Sadat early this year permitted
 the formation of three distinct groups 25X1
 within the party-a leftist, a rightist, and
 a centrist organization. The centrist group
 represents the government viewpoint.
 The leftist and rightist groups represent
 opposition viewpoints, but both are
 tainted to some extent with an establish-
 ment label. Largely for this reason, over
 half the candidates shunned party spon-
 sorship completely to run as in-25X1
 dependents. Not even the government has
 a clear picture of the political leanings of
 all of the 852 independents.
 The government avoided direct
 manipulation of the campaign, and can-
 didates were allowed considerable
 freedom. The regime is now afraid leftists
 may make substantial gains after appeal-
 ing to voter discontent over economic
 grievances.
 There are enough controls built into
 Egypt's political system, however, to
 make a completely open election impossi-
 ble. Leftist candidates, for instance, have
 no dependable media organ through
 which to make their views widely known.
 The regime also made sure that a large
 bloc of potentially antigovernment voters
 was denied a voice in the election; the
 military and the police, among whom ris-
 ing discontent over economic problems
 has become a problem, were disen-
 franchised.
 We doubt that openly identified opposi-
 tion candidates will make substantial
 gains in the election, but independents
 may win 30 to 60 seats. Not all of these
 will be opposition deputies, but the fact
 that all of them have refused to run under
 the auspices of the official party's three
 organizations indicates a tendency to
 resist government dictates.
 Government policy would not be
 seriously influenced by an Assembly in
 which no more than 25 to 30 percent of
 the deputies were oppositionists or in-
 dependents. An Assembly constituted
 along these lines would not, however, be
 the rubber stamp its predecessors have
 been.

 RHODESIA     /'/t'
 ~ Rhodesia's rival black nationalist
 leaders and Prime Minister Smith's white
 minority government began formal
 negotiations in Geneva this week on an in-
 terim government to lead Rhodesia to
 black rule. The positions taken by the two
 sides are far apart, and much hard
 bargaining lies ahead if an agreement is to
 be reached.
 The  four  black  delegation
 leaders-Joshua Nkomo, Robert
 Mugabe, Ndabaningi Sithole, and Bishop
 Abel Muzorewa-are trying to play down
 their differences and cooperate in a com-
 mon approach at the conference. Nkomo
 and Muzorewa, who have little military
 support, probably believe the talks must
 succeed if they are to have a chance at
 power in a black Rhodesian government.
 They may feel it necessary to adopt a
 tough position, however, to protect
 G IQ M 04)q
 black interests.
 Mugabe may adopt a harder line
 port of his faction's military wing, to
 which most of the Rhodesian guerrillas
 ome of the guerrilla commanders ap-
 parently do not want the conference to
 succeed because they believe they can
 come to power soon through a military
 victory. The guerrillas are likely to try to
 intensify their efforts against Rhodesian
 government forces while the conference is
 going on.
 If the negotiations progress to the point
 of discussing the specifics of setting up an
 COKE rte
 r~~s
 interim government, conflicting interests  25X1
 and ambitions could intensify the rivalry
 among the nationalist leaders. There is no    25X1
 indication that the blacks have agreed on
 how the positions in an interim govern-       25X1
 ment would be divided up among them.
 Ian Smith, for his part, apparently
 hopes to retain a significant personal        25X1
 political role at least through the period of
 interim government.  Smith wants to
 appear reasonable at the conference, but
 there is little sign thus far of much give in
 his public position on a settlement.
 Smith realizes, however, that the South
 Africans, who have supported him,
 strongly favor a negotiated settlement,
 and he may adopt a more conciliatory
 position rather than risk a purely military
 solution. Rhodesian security and defense
 chiefs have informed the Prime Minister
 that the military outlook is bleak, and
 most of them favor making the best deal
 possible with the nationalists.
 Smith probably calculates that, if the
 conference breaks down, he would be able
 to put the onus on the nationalists. In such 25X1
 an event, he would hope-probably un-
 realistically-to get new military aid from

 SPAIN
 The Spanish reform program has
 entered a decisive phase as the Cortes
 prepares to debate the government's
 proposed constitutional amendments.
 A subcommittee of the Cortes must
 present its report no later than November
 10, and the proposals will then be opened
 to debate by the entire legislature.
 Although no time limit has been set for
 the plenary debate, Cortes President Fer-
 nandez-Miranda-who has made clear his
 support for the reforms-has the power to
 call for a final vote when he sees fit. He
 will almost certainly do so before
 November 20, when massive right-wing
 demonstrations are planned to com-
 memorate the first anniversary of Fran-
 co's death.
 The debate is the last real opportunity
 the Spanish far right will have to try to
 head off the reforms. If the government
 proposals are approved without substan-
 tial alteration, the die will be cast for a
 freely elected bicameral legislature that
 will severely curtail what little legal power
 the right still has.
 Government officials still believe they
 have enough leverage to win the battle in
 the Cortes, but they admit it will be close.
 Cabinet members have told the US em-
 bassy that if the amendments fail to pass
 or are watered down, King Juan Carlos
 will dissolve the Cortes and take the
 reforms to the people in a referendum.
 Bypassing established channels in this
 manner, however, would be dangerous. It
 would link the future of the monarchy to
 the success of the reform process and
 could weaken crucial military support,
 which has reportedly been contingent on
 the reforms passing through the existing
 Francoist institutions.
 Grumbling from right-wing generals
 who oppose political reform has already
 spawned rumors of a military coup. Most

 probably remain loyal to the King if there confidants, Giovanni Cervetti, in charge
 and if the government refrains from
 appeasing the opposition by legalizing the
 Communist Party or granting greater
 autonomy to the regions.
 Most rightist politicians have probably
 accepted the inevitability of change and
 will hesitate to appear before the
 public-portions of the Cortes debate will
 be televised-as opponents of
 democratization. The real issue during the
 coming weeks is more likely to be whether
 the government can stave off
 modifications to its proposals that would
 alienate those elements of the opposition
 that are now inclined to participate in a
 new political system.
 Several government officials say that, if
 the reforms pass the Cortes relatively un-
 scathed, the government will set the
 referendum for the middle of December
 and hold a legislative election, possibly as
 early as March.
 ITALY 21-2
 Leadership changes in the Italian Com-
 munist Party made at last week's Central
 Committee meeting indicate that party
 chief Berlinguer is working to strengthen
 his grip in the face of increasing dissent
 over his policy of cooperation with the
 Andreotti government.
 The changes are consistent with
 Berlinguer's effort since his election as
 secretary general in 1972 to consolidate
 his personal control of the party. At the
 party congress last year, for example,
 Berlinguer managed to eliminate the
 Politburo-a preserve of the party's old
 guard that had hindered his freedom to
 maneuver. He also added more of his
 allies to the party secretariat.
 In the personnel shuffle last week,
 Berlinguer reduced the secretariat from
 nine to eight members and replaced two
 men appointed in 1975 with two new-
 comers who are reportedly even closer to
 him.
 Another secretariat member w o
 appears close to Berlinguer was given
 responsibility for the press and propagan-

 da section, which will play a key role in
 dealing  with rank-and-file  misgivings
 about the party line. Another Berlinguer
 man was made director of the party's
 newly created Center for the Problems of
 the State.             I
 Despite dissenting views expressed dur-
 ing the Central Committee meeting, the
 session ended with an endorsement of
 Berlinguer's policies. ,In his concluding
 statement, Berlinguer assured the com-
 mittee that he would insist on pledges
 from the government of social and
 economic reform and a larger policy-
 making role in return for his cooperation.
 Although internal dissent does not
 appear to pose an immediate threat to
 Berlinguer's leadership or policies, he
 could come under heavier pressure if he
 fails to win additional political con-
 FRANCE
 25-2 ~
 The French have increased their ability
 to support naval operations in the Indian
 Ocean by adding a support ship to their
 fleet there. The move is another indication
 of France's determination to maintain its
 sizable naval presence in the area.
 US defense attaches in Paris report that
 the maintenance and repair ship Jules
 Verne, previously assigned to the Atlan-
 tic, has been sent to Djibouti in the French
 Territory of the Afars and Issas. Djibouti
 is France's only remaining major naval
 base in the Indian Ocean.
 France may be asked to leave the base
 in Djibouti after the FTAI achieves its in-
 dependence next year. If so, the Jules
 Verne and the remainder of the Djibouti
 detachment will probably move to La
 Reunion or Mayotte-French island
 possessions in the South Indian Ocean.
 The addition of the support ship will
 improve the fleet's ability to operate in-
 dependently of the extensive shore
 facilities at Djibouti. It will be able to per-
 form at sea most routine maintenance and
 repair tasks needed by French surface

 The French Indian Ocean fleet, the
 largest Western fleet in the area,
 strengthens France's image as a world
 power able to influence events and protect
 French interests in both Africa and the
 Middle East. The fleet, normally con-

 protect key oil transport routes to the
 West and maintain surveillance of Soviet
 naval  activity  in  the region.
 USSR-CHINA
 Every official act of the USSR toward
 China since the death of Mao Tse-tung
 has been aimed at building a public record
 of Soviet reasonableness and willingness
 to do everything possible to improve
 relations with China.
 This week,  General Secretary
 Brezhnev's speech to the Central Com-
 mittee plenum on October 25 and the
 communique issued the same day at the
 end of Mongolian party leader Tseden-
 bal's visit to Moscow provided the Soviets
 with further occasions to build on the
 public record.
 In his speech, Brezhnev implicitly
 criticized Chinese foreign policy, but he
 reiterated the USSR's four-year-old offer
 to normalize relations with China and
 hinted at its willingness to restore party-
 to-party ties.
 During Tsedenbal's visit, Brezhnev in-
 dicated willingness to engage in a
 "constructive dialogue" with anyone in-
 terested in resolving Asian problems. His
 language probably was intended to set the
 stage for-or perhaps to rein-
 force-private Soviet messages to the
 Chinese on the need for some high-level
 exchange aimed at improving relations.
 Subsequently, Brezhnev sent a terse
 congratulatory telegram to Hua Kuo-feng
 on his assumption of the chairmanship of
 the Chinese Communist Party. The
 Chinese promptly rejected the note as
 they had the earlier condolence note from
 the Soviet Central Committee on the
 death of Mao.
 The Soviets are being cautious in public
 and private about the significance for
 them of the purge of China's four leading
 leftists, but the event doubtless surprised
 and pleased them. The Soviets have long
 thought that the leftists gave an
 ideological rigidity to Mao's unyielding
 approach to the USSR.
 The Soviets maintain, however, that the
 Chinese moderates are ultimately no less
 anti-Soviet than the leftists and that no 25X1
 genuine improvement in relations can be
 expected for at least 7 to 10 years. The
 USSR is aware of reports, however, that
 some important Chinese officials favor
 less confrontation in dealing with the
 USSR. The USSR doubtless hopes that
 China's new leaders will be prepared to
 take some steps to minimize chances of
 clashes on the border and perhaps also to
 improve state-to-state relations.
 The Soviets are not willing to wait in-
 definitely for a positive signal from China.
 This was evident in Brezhnev's speech at
 the plenum and the mid-October article in
 France Soir in which Soviet "journalist"
 Victor Louis warned the Chinese that they
 have a month to show an interest in better
 relations.
 Louis subsequently told a US embassy
 officer in Moscow that he was not

 USSR  2 7 - z U
 The Soviet Communist Party Central
 Committee and the Supreme Soviet met
 in Moscow this week to approve the new
 five-year plan and next year's plan and
 budget. Despite indications that some
 changes in the top leadership might also
 be made, only a few relatively minor ap-
 pointments were announced.
 The main event was General Secretary
 Brezhnev's review of Soviet foreign and
 domestic economic policy, which he
 delivered to the opening session of the
 Central Committee plenum on October
 25.
 The wide airing given Brezhnev's
 speech breaks the precedent of over a
 decade of generally unpublicized plenary
 proceedings. The decision to make the
 party chief's address public, especially
 while the Central Committee meeting was
 still under way, probably reflected the im-
 portance the leadership attached to get-
 ting its foreign policy positions on the
 record, at an authoritative forum, in ad-
 vance of the US election. Publication of
 the text also, of course, focused attention
 upon Brezhnev as the pre-eminent Soviet
 leader.
 The plenum closed the following day
 with the election of a new member to the
 Secretariat and the promotion of three
 candidate members of the Central Com-
 mittee to full membership.
 The new party secretary is Yakov
 Ryabov, the party first secretary of the
 Sverdlovsk region in the Urals. Party
 Secretary Kirilenko has career ties to this
 area and is probably Ryabov's patron.
 Ryabov, 48, has worked in industry and in
 a series of party posts in Sverdlovsk, a
 major center of heavy industries. His
 duties on the Secretariat were not
 specified.
 The plenum was more notable for what
 it failed to do than for what it ac-
 complished. The plenum did not remove
 Defense Minister Ustinov from the
 Secretariat, as had been expected. Until
 now under Brezhnev, Soviet leaders have
 not held full-time party and government
 posts simultaneously. The exception made
 for Ustinov may mean that he will con-
 tinue to oversee the defense industry for
 the party.
 Nikolay Tikhonov, who was promoted
 to first deputy premier in early
 September, was not awarded the Polit-
 buro status that usually goes with the
 post. A picture of the leadership last
 month in the press, which showed
 Tikhonov standing with full members of
 the Politburo, indicated that an effort had
 been under way to advance his candidacy.
 The lack of action on moves for which
 preparations seem to have been made may
 reflect some disagreement among the
 leaders as well as their long-evident reluc-
 tance to make changes in the senior
 leadership.
 All Soviet leaders were on hand for the
 opening of the Supreme Soviet on
 Wednesday. Premier Kosygin,
 however-although present-has evident-
 ly not yet recovered sufficiently from his
 recent illness to deliver the report on the
 five-year plan to the Supreme Soviet. For
 the first time under the present leadership,
 Gosplan Chairman Baybakov made the
 report.
 SOVIET HARVEST
 The bumper Soviet grain harvest an-
 nounced by General Secretary Brezhnev
 on October 25 should give the USSR
 more flexibility in satisfying domestic
 needs and arranging its grain trade.
 Brezhnev reported that this year's grain
 crop would "either very closely approach
 the figures of the record year 1973, or
 even surpass it." This suggests that total
 grain output will be 222 million tons or
 more. Brezhnev indicated that 216 million
 tons had already been harvested-76
 million tons above the disastrous harvest
 of 1975. A harvest of 220 to 225 million
 tons will provide the economy with a
 much needed boost:
 ? Livestock herds, which were
 reduced and put on short rations, can
 be rebuilt toward the long-run goal of
 putting more meat in the consumers'
 diet.
 ? Grain reserves, depleted by two
 years of declining production, can be
 rebuilt 6y 5 to 10 million tons.
 ? The quality of a variety of bread
 products can be improved.
 The USSR now has the options of cur-
 tailing additional grain purchases, expor-
 ting some grain to the West, and shipping
 more to traditional clients in the com-
 munist countries.
 The Soviets reportedly may sell some
 barley to West European traders, who
 have offered to buy 3 to 4 million tons "at
 very attractive prices." The USSR,
 however, must balance its desire to earn
 hard currency with the repeated demands
 for additional grain from Eastern Europe.
 Despite the bumper grain crop, total
 farm output should rise by only about 1.5
 percent this year because of a sharp
 decline in livestock production.
 Agricultural growth is far from the
 8.5-percent rebound planned this year and
 will continue to depress the growth of
 gross national product. Nevertheless, the
 good crop will reduce the amount of hard
 currency needed to pay for agricultural
 imports and allow a considerable im-
 provement in the livestock sector in 1977.

 Chile has informed US ofals that it
 will no longer seek new US aid. In a re-
 cent speech, President Pinochet said Chile
 had rejected a US loan he described as
 "linked to political conditions." Although
 the Chilean government maintains public-
 ly that it is rejecting new aid, it is actively
 seeking a $15-million loan under PL 480
 Title Ito bolster wheat supplies in view of
 another projected poor harvest.
 Because of world press criticism for
 human rights abuses, Chile sees itself as
 increasingly isolated from its traditional
 allies outside South America. Two weeks
 ago, in its report to the UN General
 Assembly, the Ad Hoc Group on Human
 Rights recommended that member
 nations restrict trade and aid with Chile.
 The Chilean government had refused to
 accept the group's on-site investigation
 team,
 Encouraged  by  improved  export
 earnings this year, Chilean economic
 managers apparently are now gambling
 that Chile's international financial
 obligations can be met without further
 debt rescheduling and with minimal
 reliance on foreign economic aid. This
 year, for the first time since 1971, Chile
 managed to avoid debt renegotiations.
 A 33-percent increase in overall export
 earnings and renewed foreign private
 loans have caused a dramatic improve-
 ment in Chile's foreign reserve
 position-gross reserves quadrupled to
 $445 million during the first eight months
 URUGUAY
 President Aparicio Mendez, who was
 selected by the military just two months
 ago to preside over the Uruguayan
 government for the next five years, is en-
 countering strong opposition from the
 men who put him in office. Chances are a
 little better than even that he will remain
 as president for even as long as a few more
 months.
 The US embassy reports there were
 widespread rumors last week that Mendez
 had been ousted or was about to be. On
 October 15, Mendez did have a long
 meeting with all of the senior military
 leaders. Although there are Several ver-
 sions of what transpired? thg argument
 that the military would look foolish
 changing presidents so soon apparently
 won Mendez a reprieve.
 At another meeting last week, military
 leaders are said to have discussed methods
 for muzzling Mendez and restricting
 further his freedom of action. A consensus
 seems to have been reached, since Mendez
 told the press over the weekend that he
 had "decided to refrain from making
 statements and to say something only
 when it might be justified by the impor-
 tance of the matter."
 Many military leaders were opposed to
 Mendez' selection in the first place, and
 more have become disenchanted with him
 because his government has done little
 since taking office. Mendez is not entirely
 to blame, however, because he is merely a
 front for the 21 generals who rule
 Uruguay under an ineffective collegial

 decided against forcing a showdown at the
 convention, at least partly because of sen-
 timent in the party that the issue be
 resolved after, rather than before, the
 election. Thus it is increasingly likely
 Miki will remain in charge through the
 election.
 The endorsement of Fukuda's can-
 didacy, however, demonstrates that the
 balance of power in the party still favors
 the deputy prime minister. A serious ef-
 fort to replace Miki will probably be
 made shortly after the election when, by
 law, the entire cabinet must resign and a
 new prime minister must be elected by the
 Diet.
 The Diet has already passed the vital
 fiscal legislation on its agenda and will
 probably be dissolved shortly after the

 MALAYSIA )z - J 7
 Malaysia's national oil company,
 Petronas, may reach a production-sharing
 agreement with the major oil companies
 In late September, the controversia
 and highly nationalistic Petronas chief,
 Tengku Razaleigh, resigned to devote full
 time to his Finance Ministry portfolio. He
 was replaced by the former secretary of
 the government, Tan Sri Kadir, who is
 more sympathetic to Hussein's desire to
 accommodate foreign investors and to
 conclude an agreement with the oil com-
 panies.
 Malaysia is seriously concerned that
 failure to reach a satisfactory agreement
 could scare off foreign investment in non-
 oil sectors. The ambitious development
 plan for 1976 to 1980 calls for continued
 high dependence on foreign investment in
 the private sector.
 AUSTRALIA    ~ ,3 7
 Australia is gradually softening its posi-
 tion toward Indonesian incorporation of
 Portuguese East Timor, until now a major
 irritant in relations with Indonesia.
 Prime Minister Fraser's visit to In-
 donesia earlier this month helped this
 process along. Fraser did not reiterate
 Australia's past insistence on an inter-
 nationally supervised referendum in the
 former colony, and he did not question
 President Suharto's statement that East
 Timor is now an inseparable part of In-
 donesia.
 Both the former Labor government and
 Fraser's coalition have had to steer clear
 of any endorsement of the Indonesian
 takeover because of widespread
 Australian public sympathy for Timorese
 independence.  President  Suharto
 recognizes that internal political con-
 siderations prevent the Australians from
 accepting Indonesian actions outright,
 and he is willing to take Fraser's noncom-
 mittal comments as tacit acceptance.
 Australia's Labor opposition is still try-
 ing to use Timor as a political issue and
 has tried to present the Fraser
 government's accommodation to In-
 donesia as a sell-out. It is hard to make
 this argument stick, however, because the
 Labor government itself over a year ago
 signaled Indonesia that it would acquiesce
 in a quick Indonesian takeover of the Por-
 tuguese colony.
 Both Fraser and the Labor opposition
 appear to recognize that Australian public
 interest in Timor has declined, and the
 amount of political advantage that might
 be gained from a debate on the subject
 does not justify further damage to
 relations with Indonesia. Foreign
 Minister Peacock's statement to Parlia-
 ment last week that it does not serve
 Australia's  interests to aggravate its
 largest neighbor is the most public indica-
 tion so far that the Fraser government
 would like to put the Timor issue to rest.

 A speculative surge in demand for crude oil from members
 of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
 strengthening the argument of those OPEC members pushing
 for a large price hike as of January 1.
 Government officials from member
 states of the Organization of Petroleum
 Exporting Countries are now talking
 more openly about the price rise expected
 on January 1. They are suggesting that the
 increase will probably be greater than 10
 percent.
 Fearful that the OPEC members will
 prohibit excessive liftings immediately
 preceding the price hike, oil companies
 are lifting larger volumes now. The
 resulting abnormal market conditions are
 tending to strengthen the conviction of
 many in OPEC that a large price hike is
 warranted.
 The Saudi commerce minister, visiting
 Iran last week, informed Ambassador
 Helms that Saudi Arabia had favored an
 increase of about 10 percent but recent
 trends in US - Middle East policies may
 force Riyadh to rethink its position in
 favor of a larger increase.
 This is in accord with earlier statements
 by United Arab Emirates Oil Minister
 Utayba; Saudi Arabia and the UAE are
 leading price moderates within OPEC.
 The Venezuelan finance minister said re-
 cently that the price rise would be no
 less than 15 percent, based on a consen-
 sus of the 13 OPEC members.
 Oil: Anticipation of Price Increase
 This may in part be a psychological
 game that the OPEC states are playing
 with the industrialized countries to
 prepare them for the increase, to make
 them feel relieved when the rise is not
 larger, and possibly to extract some
 political and economic concessions along
 the way.
 Greater Demand
 The speculative surge in demand for
 OPEC crude in the past several weeks is
 causing most OPEC states to produce ex-
 ceptionally large volumes. Iran is at near
 record levels, and Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
 the UAE, and Venezuela are at or close to
 government-set production ceilings.
 Companies seeking to increase liftings
 or conclude new purchase agreements in
 the fourth quarter of this year are often
 being rejected. Crude and product prices
 in major international spot markets have
 strengthened, while volumes available for
 spot sale are becoming scarce.
 The petroleum industry must pay ad-
 ditional costs in order to lift crude oil
 before the price hike.
 ? Monthly interest costs for financing
 crude oil are about 8 cents per barrel.
 OPEC states have recently shortened pay-
 ment terms because of the tight crude
 market, posing potential financing
 problems for some companies not im-
 mediately planning to process the crude.
 ? Monthly storage costs are also about
 8 cents per barrel. This is likely to in-
 crease as tankage facilities become tight.
 ? Surges in crude liftings tend to raise
 spot tanker rates, which add to per-barrel
 costs.
 Based on these factors, each barrel
 lifted this month for speculative reasons
 will cost an additional 50 cents, and other
 factors will further reduce the per-barrel
 savings.                     25X1
 Some OPEC countries that offer price
 discounts to former concessionaires may
 not extend these terms for sales above a
 given volume.
 Higher spot prices, which directly affect
 only a small portion of crude oil and
 products traded, encourage producing
 governments to raise prices by adjusting
 crude differentials.                25X1
 On balance, the cost of speculative buy-
 ing will be considerable, but the practice
 will still be profitable if the oil price hike
 is 10 percent or more.

 The elevation of Hua Kuo-feng to the party chairmanship
 and the purge of the party's leading leftists have evidently been
 highly popular moves in China and we see no sign that the
 decisions are being challenged in any significant way. Even so,
 the leadership is moving cautiously and has apparently decided
 to defer major new decisions.
 China: Leadership Moves Cautiously
 It is now evident that t e Chinese
 leadership will  avoid major new
 decisions-even pressing ones-for some
 time. The huge rally held in Peking on Oc-
 tober  24 underlined  the dramatic
 developments of the past two weeks, but
 signaled no new departure.
 Wu Te, the Peking party boss and
 Politburo member who was the principal
 speaker at the rally, called it an occasion
 to "celebrate Hua Kuo-feng's assumption
 of office" as party chairman and chair-
 man of the party's military affairs com-
 mission, as well as to "hail the great vic-
 tory" represented by the purge of China's
 four leading leftists.
 Wu said the decision to elevate Hua
 was taken on October 7 by the party Cen-
 tral Committee; in fact, the action on that
 date was taken by the surviving members
 of the Politburo, who "recommended"
 Hua's promotion to chairman to the Cen-
 tral Committee, which legally has respon-
 sibility for such matters.
 In fact, Hua and his current associates
 appear to have deliberately avoided a for-
 mal plenary session of the committee.
 Although the committee, elected at the
 10th party congress in 1973, has seemed
 to be weighted solidly in favor of party
 "centrists" and "rightists," party leaders
 appear unwilling to take any chances in
 the current fluid situation.
 25X1         Fragile Situation
 All this suggests that the leadership
 considers the current situation to be
 somewhat fragile and apparently plans to
 feel its way cautiously. Thus, no one has
 been named to the Politburo to replace
 the fallen leftists or members who have
 died in the past year. Restructuring of the
 Politburo is legally entrusted to the Cen-
 tral Committee.
 In addition, the promotion of Li
 Hsien-nien, currently the first vice
 premier, to the post of premier-an action
 that has been rumored since the fall of the
 leftists and one that could easily be ac-
 complished by the standing committee of
 the National People's Congress, which is
 in permanent session in Peking-has not
 yet taken place. Hua Kuo-feng was iden-
 tified as premier at the rally on October
 24.
 Remaining members of the Politburo,
 including those who reside outside the
 capital, appeared at the rally in the same
 rank order they held prior to the arrest of
 the four leftists.
 Despite his apparent links with the left
 and a report that he was being "detained"
 in Peking, Li Te-sheng, the commander of
 the Shenyang Military Region, appeared
 with his Politburo colleagues. It is possi-
 ble that he has been ordered to remain in
 the capital while his relations with the lef-
 tist quartet are investigated. This is a
 practice frequently employed by the
 Chinese.
 Ni Chih-fu, an alternate member of the
 Politburo who was reported in wall
 posters                        to have
 been given responsibility for "cleaning
 up" the leftist stronghold of Shanghai,
 was identified at the rally by his usual ti-
 tle, secretary of the Peking party com-
 mittee-an indication that no final deci-
 sion has been taken to fill the leadership
 vacuum in China's largest city caused by
 the arrest of the leftists, three of whom are
 from Shanghai.
 Few New Challenges
 Despite these signs of indecision and
 uncertainty, there is still no indication
 that Hua and the remaining leaders in
 Peking are being challenged in any signifi-
 cant fashion. Rallies hailing Hua's eleva-
 tion and the purge of the leftists have been
 held throughout China, apparently
 without incident. The fall of the leftist
 "gang" is an extremely popular develop-
 ment, and a holiday mood has prevailed
 throughout the country for much of the
 past two weeks.
 The new leadership, moreover, has
 gone out of its way to underline the fact
 that it has the backing of the bulk of
 China's  military  establishment.  Uni-
 formed troops were greatly in evidence
 at the rally on October 24, and Hua
 himself wore a military uniform.
 The new leaders have stressed the point
 that the decision to elevate Hua to the
 chairman's post was taken by Mao before
 his death. Wu Te said in his speech at
 the rally that Mao had sent a note last
 spring stating that he could "rest peace-
 fully" with Hua "in charge." An editorial
 published jointly by China's leading jour-
 nals on October 25 also quotes a series of
 rebukes Mao issued to the leftist quartet
 in 1974 and 1975.
 The new regime is also wrapping itself
 in the mantle of the late-and still
 revered-Chou En-lai. The leftist "gang"
 has been accused of plotting to attack
 Chou and of attempting to undermine
 China's economic development plans,
 which  are associated with the late
 premier. Pictures of Chou were at the re-
 cent rallies in Peking.

 South Africa gave independence to the tribal homeland of
 Transkei in an effort to buttress its own apartheid policy.
 Transkei will be totally dependent on South Africa, but there
 are some circumstances under which the new state could cause
 difficulties for South Africa.
 ~-g -~ ?
 Transkei: Nominal Independence
 Transkei is the first and largest o nine
 self-governing tribal homelands-Ban-
 tustans-that South Africa created to
 justify its policy of apartheid. Transkei's
 independence was proclaimed on October
 26, and the South Africans are heralding
 the event as proof that apartheid is
 leading South Africa's entire black pop-
 ulation to eventual independence.
 Transkei is the best endowed of the
 Bantustans but, even so, its basic
 economic resources are so limited that it
 appears fated to remain deeply dependent
 on South Africa for the indefinite future.
 Transkei is the only Bantustan that has
 a consolidated territorial base and South
 Africa's ruling National Party has no
 plans to consolidate the scattered land
 parcels that comprise the other tribal
 homelands.
 The New State
 The territory that South Africa has ced-
 ed to Transkei-approximately the size of
 Denmark-is the ancestral homeland of
 several tribes belonging to the Xhosa
 ethnic group, which also includes tribes
 that have been assigned to the adjacent
 Ciskei Bantustan.
 About two thirds of the 4.5 million
 Xhosas belong to the tribes that make up
 the Transkei "nation." No more than 1.7
 million of some 3 million ethnic
 Transkeians now live in Transkei, and
 most of them are largely dependent on
 relatives who work in the urban areas of
 South Africa.
 The constitution that went into effect
 on Tuesday was drafted by South
 Africans and adopted by the Transkei
 legislature. In accordance with the
 apartheid tenet that the traditional tribal
 chiefs are the primary leaders of all South
 African blacks, the newly formed
 National Assembly has 75 seats for the
 hereditary chiefs and 75 seats for com-
 moners elected by all adult Transkei
 citizens, including nonresidents.
 The head of government is Prime
 Minister Kaiser Matanzima, a hereditary
 chief who has served as chief councilor of
 the autonomous Transkei government
 since 1963 with full backing from the
 South African Ministry of Bantu Affairs.
 All but 3 of the 75 hereditary chiefs in
 the National Assembly belong to Matan-
 zima's Transkei National Independence
 Party, which won all but four of the 75
 elective seats in a general election earlier
 this month. Matanzima's triumph at the
 polls may have been facilitated by his
 detention of at least 13 opposition
 politicians under South African security
 regulations that apparently are to be
 maintained.
 Matanzima will continue to depend
 heavily on South African expertise in the
 day-to-day running of Transkei affairs.
 Among the 300 or so officials assigned by
 South Africa to Transkei are the com-
 mander of the one-battalion army, the
 commissioner of police, the chief justice,
 and many top administrators.
 Economic Dependency
 At independence, Transkei is receiving
 some 70 percent of its $156-million
 budget from South Africa, as well as
 almost $100 million to finance the bulk of
 its development programs.
 Transkei has potential for economic
 growth, particularly in agriculture and
 hydroelectric power. The absence of inter-
 national recognition and foreign invest-
 ment means, however, that development
 for now can be realized only through
 South Africa, either officially or by
 private business.
 The Transkei Development Corpora-
 tion, five of whose nine board members
 are appointed by the South African
 government, has helped train and finance
 black entrepreneurs and has arranged the
 transfer of business ownership from
 whites to blacks. The organization offers
 low-interest loans, tax concessions, and
 rebates on transportation charges to try to
 attract potential investors, especially from
 overseas. An industrial center has been es-
 tablished at Butterworth with 23 small
 and medium factories, but so far no
 significant foreign investment has
 appeared.
 About 24 percent of the land is arable
 and well watered, but according to the
 South Africans nearly 90 percent of
 Transkei's food needs are imported. The
 hereditary chiefs rely on control of land

 tenure and land distribution for political
 power, which contributes to gross inef-
 ficiency in land use. Land holdings are
 small and fragmented and there is little
 prospect of any improvement.
 Most young Transkeians leave to work
 in South Africa more or less permanently.
 The development corporation has provid-
 ed only 4,500 new jobs annually, while
 26,000 young blacks enter the job market
 every year.
 Economic growth will require con-
 siderable development of the meager
 transportation system. Only 8 percent of
 the roads are paved, and there are less
 than 100 miles of railway. Transkei has no
 effective port and few roads to the coast.
 A major airport at the capital, Umtata, is
 nearing completion.
 The Citizenship Issue
 South Africa is preparing to use its
 economic leverage to ensure that its
 apartheid strategy is advanced through
 the granting of independence to Transkei.
 One principal tenet of apartheid is the ex-
 clusion of blacks from the South African
 political process.
 This is justified by the promise that
 every  black will attain comparable
 citizenship rights in his own homeland
 when it becomes independent. In legisla-
 tion passed last June granting in-
 dependence to Transkei, the South
 African Parliament stipulated that every
 person of Transkeian ancestry is a
 Transkei citizen and ceases to be a South
 African citizen.
 Matanzima, on the other hand, has
 wanted birth in Transkei to be the
 criterion of citizenship. He no doubt fears
 that giving political rights to large
 numbers of urbanized Transkeians would

 Prime Minister Matanzima (1, rear) and South African State President Nicolaas Diederichs (r, rear) inspect honor guard
 upset the predominance of the hereditary
 chiefs who hold sway over the largely
 rural population through their control of
 tribal land.
 In response to Matanzima, the South
 Africans have warned that Transkeians
 whose citizenship is withheld may be
 deprived of jobs in South Africa. Under
 this pressure, the Transkei legislature
 amended the draft constitution to state
 that persons of Transkeian ancestry who
 were born elsewhere are eligible for
 citizenship if they choose to apply.
 Matanzima did not, however, hold for a
 matching revision of the South African
 legislation.
 Outlook
 Transkei is likely to be an international
 outcast for an indefinite period. No
 foreign government, aside from South
 Africa, appears ready to extend
 diplomatic recognition. There is general
 agreement that recognition of Transkei
 would indicate approval of South Africa's
 apartheid system.
 It will be difficult for the Transkei
 government to convince foreigners that it
 is not linked with the repressive South
 African system as long as the chiefs of its
 security services are South Africans.
 Anything Matanzima might do to
 counteract some of the repressive
 elements of apartheid, on the other hand,
 will strengthen the case for extending in-
 ternational support. Such support, in
 turn, might enable Transkei to take a
 stand independent of South Africa in
 defiance of any threatened cutbacks in
 South African support.
 Perhaps the most critical test of in-
 dependence will be the degree of support
 that Matanzima gives to Transkeians in
 South Africa who run afoul of apartheid's
 more restrictive practices. If Transkei
 gives citizenship to large numbers of ur-
 ban blacks in South Africa, the impact on
 Transkei's internal politics might even-
 tually force Matanzima to take a more
 aggressive stance.
 Last August, most of the Bantustan
 leaders met in Johannesburg to demand
 redress of the grievances of urban blacks
 and to reassert their refusal to accept in-
 dependence on South Africa's terms.

 Matanzima was not present, and govern-
 ment leaders in Pretoria no doubt hope
 that dramatic improvements in Transkei's
 situation following independence will in-
 duce the troublesome Bantustan leaders
 to emulate Matanzima.
 The Transkei prototype, however, may
 yet be a two-edged sword. The more
 tempting the fruits of independence, the
 more eager the leaders of the remaining
 Bantustans will be to acquire the basic
 prerequisite for a viable state-a con-
 solidated territorial base. To give them
 this, however, South Africa would have to
 change the statutes that limit the total size
 of all Bantustans to no more than 13 per-
 cent of South Africa's territory.
 The UNESCO general conference now under way in
 Nairobi must come to grips with the difficulties resulting from
 the anti-Israel resolutions adopted at the last general con-
 ference two years ago.
 The 19th general conference of the UN
 Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
 Organization that opened on October 26
 in Nairobi, Kenya, may be the most im-
 portant in the organization's 30-year
 history.
 The biennial session-which runs
 through November 30-will consider im-
 portant proposals on new directions and
 priorities in the UNESCO program made
 by the organization's director general,
 Ahmadou M'Bow, a Senegalese who is
 the first black African to head a major
 UN body. This conference must also
 come to grips with problems resulting
 from the growing politicization of the
 agency.
 The 1974 Session
 At the last meeting, in 1974, debate
 focused primarily on Israel, and three
 resolutions attacking the Jewish state
 were adopted.
 ? In a move orchestrated by the Arab
 states and the Soviets, the UNESCO
 members  rejected  Israel's bid  for
 membership in the agency's European
 regional group, leaving Israel the only
 applicant so excluded. Regional groups
 serve as caucusing forums to discuss
 issues and decide upon regional can-
 didates for UNESCO posts.
 ? The conference passed another
 General Conference of UNESCO
 resolution condemning Israel's
 archaeological digging in Jerusalem on
 the grounds that this destroys the Muslim
 character of the city. The conference also
 cut off all technical assistance funds until
 the controversial excavations are halted.
 ? Finally, the conference instructed the
 director general to "exercise full supervi-
 sion of the operation of educational and
 cultural institutions in the occupied Arab
 territories."
 These actions led, among other things,
 to the suspension of the US con-
 tribution-which amounts to 25 percent
 of the agency's budget-by the US
 Congress.
 Problem of Support
 Since assuming office at the last con-
 ference, M'Bow has worked diligently to
 arrest the dwindling support for
 UNESCO activities on the part of many
 Western developed states. He has per-
 sonally taken the lead in trying to resolve
 the regional membership issue, which he
 wants settled in Israel's favor.
 A year ago, M'Bow convinced his
 African and Arab colleagues to acquiesce
 in a recommendation to the general con-
 ference that admission into a regional
 group be decided only by the states in the
 region concerned and not by the entire
 UNESCO membership. Although accep-
 tance of this recommendation in Nairobi
 appears promising, full support for Israeli
 membership by the European
 group-which includes the East
 Europeans and the Soviets-is by no
 means assured.
 Such a procedural move is designed
 to avoid a vote on the assignment of Israel
 to the European regional group. The
 move could fail, however, if the Arab
 countries refuse to accept the recommen-
 dation that the decision be left to the
 regions.
 The  controversies  over  the
 archaeological digging and the occupied
 territories are likely to foster the most
 debate. Numerous archaelogical ex-
 cavations are continuing in Jerusalem,
 and Israel appears certain to be attacked
 in Nairobi for these activities. The ex-
 pected debate may lead to an escalation of
 unreasonable demands directed toward
 both the director general and Israel.
 The Israeli government has adamantly
 refused to accept any mission explicitly
 linked to the UNESCO resolution on oc-
 cupied  Arab  territories.  Negotiations
 between M'Bow and the Israelis,
 however, appear to have found a way to
 avoid the issue by suggesting that the
 director general has complied with the
 directive.
 The Israelis agreed to admit two
 representatives of the director general as a
 "preliminary mission." Although these
 representatives would be barred from ac-

 SECRET
 tually observing educational and cultural
 facilities in the occupied territories, they
 would be allowed to collect information
 on the Israeli practices.
 M'Bow, however, has decided not to
 send a mission prior to the general con-
 ference because he regards Israel's later
 insistence that there be only one represen-
 tative as politically unacceptable. Arab
 intentions are unknown, and the situation
 may be complicated as a result of the
 proposed Security Council debate-at
 Egypt's request-on the full range of
 problems relating to the occupied
 territories.
 Despite encouraging indications that
 some of the Middle East issues may be
 either compromised or circumvented this
 time around, other contentious topics on
 the agenda may not be easily dispensed
 with. Expected dissatisfaction with con-
 ference actions on such topics as the con-
 trol of the mass media, UNESCO's
 budget, and agency contributions to im-
 plementing  the  New International
 Economic Order supported by the
 developing countries may have a harmful
 spillover effect on Israeli-related dis-
 cussions.
 The director general may be severely
 criticized by the more radical states for
 failing to move more quickly on a draft
 declaration on racial prejudice that is ex-
 pected to repeat the charge made in last
 year's UN General Assembly that
 Zionism is a form of racism. A request for
 his report on the subject is included with
 an agenda item on a mass media draft
 declaration, and he may be unable to
 avoid its discussion.
 Mass Media
 The Soviets took the initiative in 1970
 on a declaration outlining "principles" to
 govern the use of the mass media in dis-
 seminating information. At a meeting in
 Paris last December, the Yugoslavs in-
 troduced an explicit reference in the mass
 media draft to the Zionism-as-a-form-of-
 racism resolution. This action prompted
 the walk-out from the drafting sessions of
 the US, the EC Nine, and some other
 Western countries. However, the meeting
 went on to adopt-by a narrow
 margin-a one-sided declaration which
 advocates state control of news reporting.
 This will now be considered by the general
 conference.
 Apart from the reference to Zionism as
 racism, the draft also presents other
 serious problems for many states, in-
 cluding some from the third world. It
 places an excessive emphasis on the state's
 right to censor information and to
 C
 manipulate reportin   a ews dissemina-
 tion.
 Superficially at least, this appears to
 parallel recent statements by some non-
 aligned and third-world states regarding
 domination of their media by the de-
 veloped world. The current draft, how-
 ever, goes too far even for some of
 these   states,   and   the   Tuni-
 sians-presumably with the backing of
 other nonaligned states-have implicitly
 refuted the Soviet-backed effort by sub-
 mitting their own draft resolution on the
 free flow of information.
 The Tunisian draft primarily requests
 the UNESCO secretariat to undertake
 studies based on the communications
 policy recommendations approved at last
 August's nonaligned summit. However,
 the underlying intent of the resolution-as
 reflected in other nonaligned
 proclamations on the issue-appears to be
 to gain commitments from developed
 countries to share technology with, and
 provide training opportunities for,
 third-world states in the establishment
 and operation of satellite and media
 systems.
 Support for both the Tunisian effort
 and for an alternative US - West German
 draft declaration on the mass media-the
 latter to be put forth only as a last resort
 to defeat the current draft-will depend
 on how strongly the Soviets press for con-
 sideration of their draft in Nairobi.
 A deferral move by the Western states
 is likely to succeed only if it obtains the
 full backing of the third world and non-
 aligned nations. M'Bow is known to op-
 pose the Soviet-backed draft, however,
 and he may succeed in marshaling suf-
 ficient opposition to its consideration
 now.
 Priorities and Objectives
 Proposals  defining  UNESCO's
 priorities and outlining the organization's
 objectives during the next two years will
 undoubtedly draw heavily on the ter-
 minology of the New International
 Economic Order, as M'Bow is known to
 support its implementation strongly.
 Debate on the economic question, which
 some developed countries do not support,
 is likely to highlight the agency's
 calamitous budgetary situation.
 The Arab states have granted sufficient
 amounts of interest-free loans to cover the
 agency's deficit. A significant increase in
 its projected budget for the next two
 years, however, is unlikely to sit well with
 anyone and may lead to strong criticism
 of the US for its failure to pay the full
 amount of its dues.
