 China's Science and Technology
 Relations With Western Europe
 and Japan
 Key Judgments      Faced with a serious shortage of scientific and technical personnel and the
 overall backwardness of China's technical and productive capabilities, the
 Chinese leadership decided to seek assistance and cooperation from the
 advanced nations of the world. As a result, China has rapidly increased its
 contacts with Western Europe and Japan to secure technology and technical
 assistance for its industrial modernization program. To date, however,
 China's expanded relations have had limited impact on its modernization
 program. Progress has been hampered by economic and financial con-
 straints, bureaucratic inertia, poor management techniques, and critical
 shortages of qualified technical personnel-all problems with only long-
 term solutions. Even if China's immediate financial problems could be
 overcome and appreciable levels of foreign technical assistance obtained,
 however, the modernization of science and technology would proceed slowly
 through the 1980s.
 China has signed formal agreements with the governments of the major
 industrialized nations to promote educational and technical exchange. En-
 ergy and resources, telecommunications, and the exchange of scientific
 information are the main areas of activity. The most tangible benefits are an
 expanded Chinese knowledge of global state-of-the-art technologies and an
 increased awareness of domestic deficiencies in science and technology. We
 believe government-to-government exchange relations will become increas-
 ingly important to China as a cost-effective means to acquire technology and
 assistance to support its modernization effort.
 In many cases, government-to-government science and technology agree-
 ments have led to the development and expansion of commercial science and
 technology relations between China and firms in Western Europe and
 Japan. By developing official science and technology relations with a broad
 base of industrial nations, China had hoped to increase its leverage in
 negotiations for the acquisition of commercial technology. China's academic
 and scholarly exchanges with the West were increasing as of June 1981, but
 its commercial science and technology relations were declining and their
 prospects for the near future are limited.
 We believe that economic problems and financial limitations will continue to
 restrict the growth of China's commercial ties, as well as its ability to obtain
 technology through commercial channels. Moreover, recent decisions by

 China to postpone or cancel large numbers of projects involving substantial
 inputs of foreign technology have made Japanese and West European firms
 and their host governments wary of engaging in significant new scientific
 and commercial intercourse with Beijing.
 China's efforts to secure defense-related technology and assistance from
 Western Europe and Japan have been impeded by political as well as
 economic factors. The Chinese are mainly interested in acquiring technol-
 ogy as opposed to purchasing large quantities of military hardware. Some
 West European nations and Japan have been reluctant to expand the
 transfer of military technology to China for fear of antagonizing the Soviet
 Union. In addition, economic difficulties have constrained China's ability to
 pay for the technology it desires. Chinese efforts to sponge up technical
 information without providing host country companies with firm orders for
 equipment or technical assistance have begun to anger the Japanese and
 West Europeans. As a result, we believe some of these countries will be more
 restrictive in granting China access to industrial facilities and technology.

 China's Science and Technology
 Relations With Western Europe
 and Japan
 Introduction
 In early 1978 China announced plans for a massive
 program, known as the "four modernizations," de-
 signed to modernize the country in four key areas:
 agriculture, industry, science and technology, and de-
 fense. The area of science and technology was ac-
 corded a special role within the modernization pro-
 gram because upgrading S&T capabilities was viewed
 by the leadership as the prerequisite for modernization
 in the other three areas. The goals for S&T moderniza-
 tion included the establishment of several up-to-date
 centers for scientific experimentation and the improve-
 ment of the nationwide system for S&T research and
 development. By 1985, China hoped to attain levels of
 achievement comparable to those of the industrialized
 nations in the 1970s in a number of critical S&T fields
 and to increase national technological self-reliance.
 Faced with a serious shortage of S&T personnel and
 the overall backwardness of China's technical and
 productive capabilities, the Chinese leadership decided
 to seek assistance and cooperation from the advanced
 nations of the world. In particular, China hoped to
 send large numbers of students, researchers, and
 industrial managers abroad to receive advanced S&T
 training; to acquire foreign technology to upgrade
 civilian and military productivity; and to enhance the
 capabilities of domestic S&T institutions through in-
 creased interactions with the world scientific commu-
 nity.
 In many respects, the decision to reach out to the West
 for assistance ran counter to the basic foreign policy
 China had followed for three decades. Before the early
 1970s China's policy was to develop S&T relations
 mainly with Communist or Third World nations.
 Developing ties with the West meant a major
 reorientation of the political and economic thinking
 that dominated the Chinese scene under the leadership
 of Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong. It also
 raised questions about the impact that increased con-
 tacts with the West might have on the political, eco-
 nomic, and social integrity of Chinese society. Despite
 the fact that a majority of China's top leaders favored
 expanded relations with the West in support of mod-
 ernization, many in China were concerned about be-
 coming too closely associated with, and possibly de-
 pendent upon, the West for technology or financial
 assistance.
 The first steps China took in opening relations with the
 West in the 1970s were to send large numbers of
 students abroad and to arrange agreements for the
 purchase of technology, production equipment, and
 complete plants. China sent hundreds of buying mis-
 sions to the West to examine and in some cases to
 acquire selected technologies. Chinese leaders, how-
 ever, soon recognized that their country possessed nei-
 ther the financial resources to pay for this technology    25X1
 nor the technical personnel and managers to use it
 effectively.
 Faced with the potentially damaging consequences of
 undertaking too much too fast, in mid-1979 China
 announced plans to readjust the goals of the mod-
 ernization program. By early 1981 many projects
 involving foreign participation were scaled down or
 canceled primarily because of China's reluctance to
 incur high levels of external debt, energy shortages,
 and a desire to cut investment spending to reduce a
 domestic budget deficit. These actions caused ap-
 prehension among foreign companies concerning Chi-    25X1
 na's capacity to complete its modernization program
 successfully and to compensate foreign firms for both
 physical equipment and technical services. Japan and
 West Germany have been affected most by the actions
 of the Chinese. In addition, many Chinese organiza-
 tions had concluded contracts with foreign firms with-
 out having the authority to enter into these agree-
 ments.
 China continues to reassess its priorities and capabili-
 ties with respect to its modernization program. New
 emphasis will be given to the development of energy,

 agriculture, and light industry. Investment in heavy
 capital construction projects has been discouraged. In
 the S&T field, progress has been slow and the emphasis
 on S&T modernization has not yielded the desired
 economic results. Greater attention is being given to
 applied research and development in hopes that S&T
 activities can better serve the production needs of the
 modernization drive. The budget for the development
 of basic sciences, such as high-energy physics, has been
 cutJ
 The General Pattern of China's S&T Relations
 Bilateral scientific and technological exchanges and
 cooperation agreements between China and the ad-
 vanced nations of the world have increased rapidly
 since the mid-1970s. China's expanded relations with
 West European countries and Japan have been
 particularly important. These countries, together with
 the United States, are to serve as sources of training,
 scientific information, and production technologies to
 support China's "four modernizations" program.
 Nevertheless, in an effort to avoid becoming exces-
 sively dependent upon any one country or group of
 countries for technology and economic assistance,
 China is attempting to maintain a variety of contacts
 among a broad base of industrialized nations. This
 strategy provides China with increased leverage in
 negotiations with individual countries for the acquisi-
 tion of technology, financial aid, and training opportu-
 nities.
 China's S&T relations with Western Europe and Ja-
 pan have been established using three types of agree-
 ments: government-to-government agreements, pri-
 vate scientific cooperation agreements and exchanges,
 and commercially oriented technology cooperation
 agreements. In most cases, government-to-government
 agreements provide a framework for the implementa-
 tion and expansion of both private and commercial
 technical cooperation and exchange agreements. The
 governments of some West European nations and Ja-
 pan have sought to use government-to-government
 agreements as a means to promote the development of
 commercial links between their own business enter-
 prises (private and state owned) and the Chinese Gov-
 ernment (see table). Similarly, China's leaders want to
 obtain preferential terms for the transfer of technology
 and for loan agreements in return for granting com-
 panies from Western Europe and Japan access to the
 Chinese market
 Exchanges with foreign countries also are arranged
 through cultural and educational agreements. Student
 exchanges are the most important aspect of these
 agreements. China is particularly interested in phys-
 ical sciences and engineering under such academic
 exchanges and has successfully negotiated agreements
 whereby large numbers of Chinese graduate students
 and researchers can study at European and Japanese
 universities for two- to five-year periods.
 Language training has become, an important compo-
 nent of academic exchange. Language proficiency and
 comprehension problems affect the performance of
 Chinese students in Western Europe and Japan, as well
 as in the United States, and many countries have
 expressed reservations about accepting more Chinese
 students. These problems, coupled with the generally
 narrow educational background of the exchange
 participants, will increase China's difficulty in devel-
 oping a sufficient number of well-trained S&T per-
 sonnel to achieve its modernization goals.
 Firms from Western Europe and Japan and their host
 governments have been anxious to translate bilateral
 S&T exchange relations into commercial relationships
 with China. They have made numerous formal agree-
 ments for cooperation with the Chinese in tele-
 communications, space, mining, and energy develop-
 ment. Many of these nations, however, are
 apprehensive about the consequences of expanding
 relations with China vis-a-vis their relationship with
 the Soviet Union. This is particularly true in the case of
 sales involving military-related equipment and tech-
 nology, an area where West Germany, France, and the
 United Kingdom have been especially active. Aside
 from the COCOM restrictions, which slowed military-
 related exchanges with China in the past, West Ger-
 many and France have expressed concerns about
 proceeding too rapidly with economic cooperation,
 S&T exchanges, and military-related commercial sales
 for fear of antagonizing the Soviet Union. Although

 there are indications that the anxieties of West Eu-
 ropean countries in this regard are diminishing, the
 linkages between their relations with the Soviets and
 with the Chinese will continue to affect the rate and
 scope of all forms of S&T and economic cooperation.
 Many industrialized nations have been anxious to se-
 cure minerals and raw materials, including petroleum
 and coal, from China in return for rendering technical
 assistance. Even though many of the protocols signed
 between China and these nations have been designated
 as "cooperative agreements," most of the technology,
 capital, and know-how to undertake both research-
 related and production-related projects have come
 from the industrialized nations. Originally, China had
 hoped to increase its foreign exchange significantly to
 pay for technology and equipment through rapid
 expansion of petroleum production and exports. This
 strategy has not proven feasible because of China's
 technical deficiencies. The governments of the indus-
 trialized nations and their government-owned firms
 have negotiated various compensation agreements
 involving energy and national resources as payment for
 services rendered and equipment sales. These com-
 pensation agreements may prove to be an economically
 feasible means for China to obtain the necessary tech-
 nical assistance to explore for and commercially ex-
 ploit its mineral and energy resources

 In recent months, particularly since the Chinese Gov-
 ernment announced its decision to cancel or postpone
 many ongoing and proposed projects, foreign govern-
 ments have become disillusioned with the progress of
 business dealings with China. The United Kingdom is
 particularly upset with the slow pace of negotiations
 and has expressed its concerns about Chinese attempts
 to sponge up as much technology as possible without
 paying for it or making firm commitments to purchase
 equipment. Part of the problem derives from the Chi-
 nese view that technology is part of "the universal
 human heritage which should be shared by all na-
 tions." As a result, the Chinese do not fully appreciate
 the validity of placing proprietary controls on scientific
 and technical information.'
 Chinese delegations in both civilian and military areas
 have toured several West European countries and Ja-
 pan in an effort to examine their technical capabilities.
 Visits to government-owned and private firms have
 been extensive. Many of the countries have spent large
 sums of money and have expended significant amounts
 of time in their attempts to sell a variety of production-
 related technologies and equipment to the Chinese. As
 of June 1981, however, the results were minimal, lead-
 ing to a stifling of enthusiasm among these countries
 about the potential of the so-called China market.
 China's conservative attitude toward foreign borrow-
 ing at high commercial rates has been a major con-
 straint on China's ability to acquire technology. It will
 continue to prevent the Chinese from completing ma-
 jor commercial agreements in the near future. Govern-
 ment-to-government educational and technical ex-
 change programs, therefore, will become increasingly
 important to the Chinese as a cost-effective means to
 acquire technology and assistance to support the "four
 modernizations" program
 Among the West European nations, in particular, ef-
 forts to penetrate the Chinese market have been wide-
 spread. Because of the comparatively late date at
 which the United States normalized relations with
 'It is only within the last two or three years that China has taken an
 active interest in formulating its own patent laws. The main impetus
 behind these actions has been China's increased interaction with the
 outside world and concerns by foreign firms that their production
 China, the West European nations held an initial
 advantage in their dealings with the Chinese and made
 every effort to exploit that advantage. These efforts
 have not always yielded positive results. In the area of
 aircraft sales, the European consortium responsible for
 the manufacture of the A-300 Airbus aircraft has
 attempted to compete with US manufacturers by of-
 fering more favorable terms on sales and technology
 acquisition. One problem, however, is that the Europe-

 medium-range domestic plane to replace the Trident.
 Airbus Industry, therefore, is attempting to delay
 negotiations between China and the United States in
 this area until it can expand its product line to include
 a smaller, medium-range aircraft. This aircraft is still
 in the design stage and probably will not enter produc-
 tion until at least 1990.
 Japan is the only nation that has arranged a com-
 prehensive agreement with the Chinese involving tech-
 nical assistance and economic cooperation. The two
 countries reached a consensus on a program containing
 six projects in November 1979, and a formal agree-
 ment was signed in mid-1980. The key to the success of
 the Japanese was the financial package that they made
 available to China. The future disposition of the
 projects developed under this agreement, however, re-
 mains uncertain because of China's current efforts to
 curtail large-scale capital construction and to readjust
 key components of its economic development program.
 The West European nations, recognizing the reasons
 for Japan's success, also-have tried to arrange commer-
 cial S&T agreements by providing favorable financing.
 For example, France arranged a deal with China, after
 stiff competition with the US firm Bell Helicopter, for
 the sale of 50 Twin Dauphin helicopters to be built
 under license. We believe the French concluded the
 deal with the expectation of only limited profits.
 Apparently they were willing to sacrifice short-term
 returns to build a more permanent long-term relation-
 ship with the Chinese. Given the fact that the manu-
 facturer of the Dauphin is a government-owned firm,
 as are many of the foreign firms engaged in negotia-
 tions with China, this type of business strategy can be

 China's S&T Relations With Japan
 and Western Europe
 Japan. The consummation of a government-to-govern-
 ment S&T agreement between Japan and China was
 delayed because of the inability of the two parties to
 reach agreement on a bilateral peace and friendship
 treaty until late 1978. A Japan-China S&T Exchange
 Association had been formed in December 1977, but a
 formal S&T agreement was not concluded until May
 In October 1980 China's Science and Technology
 Association and the Japan Techno-Economic Society
 arranged the first nongovernment memorandum for
 S&T exchanges. According to Chinese pronounce-
 ments, China has three major objectives with respect
 to its S&T relations with Japan: (1) to train Chinese
 technicians with Japanese assistance, (2) to establish a
 technical advisory system between the countries, and
 (3) to use the two mechanisms just noted to acquire
 needed technical knowledge to serve the modernization
 program.
 ernment-to-government agreement was signed in
 1980. A memorandum for cooperation in the social
 sciences also was signed in 1980 between the Chinese
 Academy of Social Sciences and the Japan Society for
 the Promotion of Science. As of mid-1980 there were
 about 500 Chinese students and 500 researchers in
 Japan under the existing exchange programs. There
 also are several hundred Chinese students in Japan
 studying under commercial programs that do not fall
 within the framework of the program for reciprocal
 exchanges of scholars.
 Japan's involvement in China's modernization pro-
 gram has been more extensive than that of any other
 advanced nation, including the United States. Because
 of Japan's widespread participation, it also has been
 the most vulnerable to the many changes in China's
 modernization strategy and objectives. A significant
 number of Sino-Japanese commercial deals have col-
 lapsed as a result of economic and organizational prob-
 lems in China. As early as October 1980, Matsushita
 was forced to withdraw its plans for a major electronics
 joint venture because of what company officials per-
 ceived as "bureaucratic paralysis" in key Chinese
 organizations. This event, however, was only the begin-
 ning as more severe problems began to surface in
 China
 Faced with critical energy shortages, economic prob-
 lems, and-an overextended domestic budget, China was
 forced to cancel or indefinitely postpone large numbers
 of development projects containing appreciable inputs
 of foreign technology. Japan was hit hardest by Chi-
 na's actions.

 ficials have noted that the Chinese decision to cancel
 various projects reflected a naivete in Beijing as to the
 implications such actions would have for China's inter-
 national economic and political credibility. Although
 the Chinese have pledged compensation for the can-
 celed plants, the Japanese are clearly unhappy about
 China's blueprint for indemnifying private firms that
 have incurred significant losses in both real and poten-
 tial terms. Many questions about appropriate com-
 pensation for equipment and technical services remain
 unresolved.
 Chinese Government has notified Japan that it will
 follow its original plan to pay in cash for equipment to
 be used in the petrochemical projects. The Chinese,
 however, still have a request to the Japanese Govern-
 ment for financial assistance to cover the local costs of
 construction of several of the petrochemical plants.
 These costs originally were to be borne by the Chinese.
 Internally, the Japanese Government is reluctant to
 supply China with additional concessionary financing.
 As of late June 1981, negotiations were continuing
 concerning disposition of the Chinese request
 Energy development is Japan's main area of interest
 with respect to its technical assistance and cooperation
 programs with the Chinese. The highlight of Japan's
 relationship with China was a loan and technical
 cooperation agreement to construct six major energy-
 related development projects, including the following:
 1. A deepwater port at Shijiusuo in Shandong
 for shipping coal.
 2. Construction of a single-track railway line
 between Yanzhou (a coal base) and
 Shijiusuo.
 3. Electrification and double-tracking of the
 Beijing-Qinhuangdao railway line.
 4. Development of a Guangzhou-Hengyang
 railway line using Japanese tunneling
 technology.
 5. Expansion of a coal wharf at Qinhuangdao.
 6. Construction of a hydropower station at
 Wuqiangxi in Hunan Province.
 Recently there have been indications that China has
 decided to proceed with procurement of the equipment
 for several of the petrochemical plants that were
 postponed during the course of economic
 readjustment. The petrochemical plants involved are
 the ones located in Nanjing, Beijing, and Shengli. The

 Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and was said to
 equal US $1.5 billion at 3 percent interest for 30.years.
 It was not tied to the purchase of Japanese goods, thus
 allowing other nations to sell equipment and services to
 the Chinese under the agreement. The contracts also
 provided training opportunities for Chinese techni-

 Secret
 In December 1980 China postponed the Wuqiangxi
 hydropower project because of domestic political fac-
 tors. The Japanese already had allocated part of the
 loan for the project and were quite surprised at the
 Chinese decision. China also announced that the
 completion of the Guangzhou- Hengyang railway
 project would be postponed. In early March 1981,
 China announced that all six industrial projects would
 be delayed as a result of domestic economic problems.
 There are indications, however, that China plans to
 proceed with projects 1, 2, 3, and 5 but on an extended
 schedule. Of all the projects, only the port at
 Qinhuangdao and the Yanzhou-Shijiusuo railway had
 In addition to providing technical guidance and finan-
 cial support for the six projects just discussed, Japan
 has provided assistance to China in its development of
 mineral and energy resources. In 1980 the Japan Ex-
 port-Import Bank tendered a US $2.0 billion resource
 loan to help support joint development of coal and oil.
 The Chinese also have expressed an interest in securing
 an additional loan for the purpose of further developing
 coal. Because the Chinese are having difficulty in-
 creasing domestic petroleum production and meeting
 projected levels of oil exports to Japan, they have been
 eager to develop coal as a possible substitute to earn
 China to meet projected targets.
 The Japanese are particularly interested in obtaining
 Chinese coking coal. Japan apparently hopes to play a
 key role in the technical modernization of coal-minin
 practices in China
 In the hydroelectric area, Japan has participated in
 several survey projects in China.

 established a China Hydropower Development

 oversee technical consultations with the Chinese. Lack
 of domestic funding to carry out these projects is
 China's main constraint in this field. The Japanese

 Another major area of Japanese participation in Chi-
 na's modernization program is the iron and steel indus-
 try. Japan's role in the Baoshan steel project has in-
 volved an extensive commitment of Japanese
 personnel, technical resources, and financial assis-
 tance. The Chinese decision to cancel the second phase
 of the Baoshan project and to delay the first had a
 severe impact on Japanese firms. The Chinese accused
 Japan of not providing adequate technical advice re-
 garding the viability and economic feasibility of the
 project. From its inception, the Baoshan project had
 come under criticism in China because of high costs,
 technical problems, and poor planning. China has in-
 dicated that it will move ahead eventually and com-
 plete the first phase of the Baoshan mill, but projected
 completion would not be before 1985.

 Technical training has been a key area of Sino-Japa-
 nese S&T activities. Under a new training program
 established with Fujitsu, 100 Chinese computer scien-
 tists began a program of advanced training in March
 1981. Hitachi, another major Japanese computer firm,
 also has sponsored a technician training program.
 China has attached special importance to these pro-
 grams because it believes that they are an important
 part of the effort to modernize the Chinese computer
 industry. Other areas of training include metals pro-
 cessing and ship construction, petroleum and
 petrochemicals, and automotive technology. In many
 cases, these training programs have been associated
 with the sale of complete plants or significant quan-
 tities of equipment of Japanese manufacture. Commu-
 nications problems and Chinese educational deficien-
 cies, however, have tended to slow the rate of progress
 of the trainees, frequently making it necessary to ex-
 tend the scheduled training period by two or three
 Japan also has been providing China with technical
 guidance and information to support military mod-
 ernization. Widespread exchanges of industrial and
 military delegations between the two countries have
 been the main form of this cooperation. Constitutional
 restrictions and domestic political considerations have
 been the main impediments to the sale of arms and the
 rapid expansion of defense-related S&T contacts.
 Japanese concerns about the Soviet Union also have
 been an important factor in limiting the escalation of
 such contacts. Many of the Japanese firms that have
 developed commercial ties with the Chinese are also
 major producers of heavy industrial military equip-
 ment for Japan. Electronics also has been an area of
 extensive defense-related Sino-Japanese contacts. Nip-

 dars, communications equipment, and computers to
 China. Much of this equipment is dual-use, that is, it

 Federal Republic of Germany. S&T relations between
 China and West Germany began to gain momentum in
 the mid-1970s. Before then, exchanges were extremely
 limited. In September 1978 a scientific cooperation
 and exchange agreement was signed between the Chi-
 nese Academy of Sciences and the Max Planck In-
 stitute. Under the terms of the agreement, exchange
 visits of scientists would occur in several fields of
 mutual interest. In addition, provision was made for
 the exchange of scientific data, joint research projects,
 and joint conferences. By October 1978 the two gov-
 ernments had signed a formal S&T agreement that
 covered guidelines for cooperation in 11 fields-energy
 R&D, geological sciences, aeronautics and space,
 medicine and health, agriculture, environmental sci-
 ences, physics, chemistry, oceanography, applied
 mathematics, and production technologies. The two
 parties agreed to sign protocols to implement the
 agreement in each of the specified fields. The first
 meeting of the West German-Chinese Committee for
 S&T Cooperation took place in Bonn in October 1980.
 Protocols to implement the government-to-government
 agreements in agriculture, production technologies,
 and geological sciences were signed in June 1979. The
 protocol for the agricultural agreement included
 cooperation in plant protection, plant breeding, and
 livestock farming. The agreement in production tech-
 nologies, arranged between the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences and the Fraunhofer Society for the Advance-
 ment of Sciences, concentrated on research and civil
 applications in the applied sciences. The protocol for
 the agreement in geological science and technology,
 arranged between China's State Geological Bureau
 and the West German Ministry of Economics, in-
 cluded a three-year program on a cost-sharing basis for
 cooperative prospecting for tantalum, niobium, and tin
 in Hunan Province. These minerals are used in the
 production of electronic devices, stainless steel, and
 various alloys.
 As in its S&T relations with other nations, China has
 arranged for students to study in West Germany. By
 mid-1980 approximately 500 students and researchers
 were at various West German institutions. Most are
 studying subjects in the physical sciences. China has
 been eager to expand the existing program, but West
 German officials have been somewhat reluctant to
 provide any additional funding to support Chinese
 S&T relations between the two countries received a
 boost in December 1979 when agreement was reached
 on joint projects in several more areas. First, a protocol
 was signed for joint research on the processing and
 manufacturing of vanadium in Sichuan Province, joint
 research on processing and refining iron ore in Inner
 Mongolia, joint efforts to process rare earths in Inner
 Mongolia, and the establishment of a mobile labora-
 tory to monitor metal refining processes and for quality
 control. A second protocol was signed involving joint
 exploration for oil and gas in the East China Sea using
 isotope prospecting techniques. Contrary to West Ger-
 man demands, China refused to grant priority to Ger-
 man purchasers if oil is discovered. A third agreement
 was signed providing for joint exploration for oil and
 gas in Shandong Province. A fourth protocol laid out
 provisions for a joint survey of energy resources in a
 region of China to be selected later. Although it was
 agreed that expenses would be shared jointly, the West
 Germans probably will pay most of the costs
 Additional agreements have been reached concerning
 the areas of metrology and standards (May 1979),
 navigation and communications (July 1980), alter-
 native energy systems (November 1980), and comput-
 ers and electronics (June 1980). In this last area, the

 West Germany has been extremely active in commer-
 cial S&T cooperation and exchange with China.
 Bonn's major goal has been to open the door for West
 German firms to secure raw materials from China in
 return for the sale of technology. But West German
 industry has recently become extremely pessimistic
 about dealing with the Chinese as a result of their
 cancellation of several major projects involving
 substantial inputs of German technology. The West
 German Government has been reluctant to provide
 China with extensive credits or interest subsidies for
 capital construction. It has suggested that China seek
 assistance from various international lending agencies
 and has agreed to support Chinese requests in this
 area.
 In November 1980 West Germany agreed to provide
 China with US $7 million to help finance technical
 exchanges with West Germany and training for Chi-
 nese technicians in West Germany. The main areas of
 assistance will be patents, national economic planning,
 management, agriculture, and aviation ground service.
 The program fits in well with China's desire to cut
 back investments in capital construction and alleviate
 critical technical bottlenecks in the economy. German
 industry will still play a major role in carrying out the
 various commercially related S&T agreements with
 China. Although the Chinese will have to finance their
 own construction and business activities, they will con-
 tinue to have political support from the West German
 Government.
 West Germany's most substantial involvement in Chi-
 na's modernization program has been its participation
 in the Baoshan steel project. In June 1980 an agree-
 ment was completed for a consortium of German
 firms, led by Schloemann-Siemag, to help China con-
 struct a cold rolling steel mill at the Baoshan site. The
 cost of this project was estimated by China to be US
 $500 million, most of which was to be financed through
 a commercial loan arranged by a consortium of Ger-
 man banks. In late 1980, however, because of the
 project's large costs, technical difficulties, and exten-
 sive political criticism, China canceled a major portion
 of the project-which included the cold rolling steel
 mill-and has suspended almost all work on the blast
 furnace, coke oven, and oxygen furnace-the first
 phase. West Germany currently is negotiating with the
 Chinese for compensation
 There also has been cooperation between West Ger-
 many and China in satellite technology. The Chinese
 have sought this cooperation in order to upgrade
 communications and broadcasting links in the future.
 West Germany played an instrumental role in the
 decision to allow China to use the Symphonie A sat-
 ellite, owned by France and West Germany, in late
 contracted with AEG Telefunken for the purchase of
 satellite earth station equipment for the Nanjing Sat-
 ellite Earth Station. This station was involved in the

 In October 1978 the Chinese Academy of Sciences and
 the French State Center of Science and Research
 concluded an exchange agreement providing for schol-
 arly exchanges, the sharing of S&T information, and
 various joint projects. The agreement provides for the
 exchange of 100 employee months of scientific per-
 sonnel over the course of three years, and all exchanges
 between the two countries are to be reciprocal.
 Following the signing of these agreements, S&T rela-
 tions between the two countries increased quite rap-
 idly. In 1979 agreements in geology, metrology, ag-
 riculture, and nuclear energy were signed. The nuclear
 energy agreement was signed by the Chinese Academy
 of Sciences and the French Atomic Energy Commis-
 sion. It is a three-year arrangement whereby Chinese
 and French S&T personnel will conduct joint research
 and cooperate in improving Chinese capabilities in the
 nuclear sciences. The Chinese have spoken with
 French officials about purchasing an "Orphee" test
 reactor for scientific experimentation but have delayed
 any final decision
 China has expressed interest in developing cooperative
 programs in space sciences and technology with the
 French. Delegations from the China Astronautics
 Society and the Chinese Academy of Space Technol-
 ogy have been in contact with various French institutes
 and business firms regarding joint projects in tele-
 communications, television transmission, and remote
 sensing of earth resources. The French were involved in
 the decision to allow China use of the Symphonie A
 satellite in 1978-79 and provided technical assistance
 to Chinese scientists during the testing and experi-
 ments carried out over a 14-month period. France also
 sent a technical team to China in mid-1979 to help the
 Chinese select a subsystem for the US Landsat D or
 the French Spot satellite-receiving ground stations
 Commercial S&T relations between China and France
 have attracted increased attention in recent months,
 particularly with the signing in October 1980 of an
 agreement in principle for the French sale of two 900-
 kilowatt nuclear power stations to China. Although
 negotiations between the two countries appeared to
 result in a similar agreement in late 1979, China
 postponed a decision on the matter. Formal contracts
 for the recent agreement have yet to be signed. The
 Chinese are continuing to discuss the purchase of
 nuclear power plants with several other countries
 including the United States. China, however, has pre-
 ferred to deal with the French in this matter because of
 favorable financial terms and the fact that the French,
 until the election of the Mitterrand government at
 least, have appeared somewhat less concerned about
 strict monitoring and safeguard procedures. China has
 been mainly interested in acquiring pressurized-water
 reactor technology
 The French also have sold 50 Twin Dauphin heli-
 copters to China. This deal was agreed upon in July
 1980. Aerospatiale, the government-owned French
 aeronautics firm, will deliver the 50 units to China
 during the next few years, after which time the two will
 engage in joint production under a licensing agree-
 ment. China hopes to use the helicopters to transport
 personnel to and from offshore oil rigs. They also may
 be used to conduct geological surveys in China's outer
 regions. As with the German BO-105 helicopter, the
 Dauphin can be modified to carry the HOT missile.
 These agreements follow a long period of French dis-
 illusionment with the Chinese. The intermittent an-
 nouncement of agreements in principle between the
 two countries has not always been followed by concrete
 results. France was one of the first major Western
 powers to recognize China during the 1960s, and the
 French have been anxious to take advantage of their
 special relationship with the Chinese. At the same
 time, however, the French also have been concerned
 about their relations with the Soviet Union. Although
 France has been rather aggressive in its efforts to sell
 military-related equipment to China, it has been reluc-
 tant to push ahead too fast for fear of upsetting its
 "detente" with the Soviets.

 United Kingdom. An agreement for S&T cooperation
 and exchange between the United Kingdom and China
 ment for scientific cooperation also was signed between
 the Royal Society of the United Kingdom and the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences. Both agreements con-
 tain provisions for the exchange of researchers and
 students, the undertaking of joint projects, and the
 sharing of information in many S&T fields. As of mid-
 1980 approximately 615 Chinese students and re-
 searchers were studying in the United Kingdom under
 the guidelines of the exchange agreement. The agree-
 ment between the Academy of Sciences and the Royal
 Society allows up to 100 Chinese research workers to
 come to laboratories in the United Kingdom over a
 period of four years.
 The United Kingdom has been interested in expanding
 S&T relations with China in both civilian and military
 fields. In December 1979 the two countries signed an
 agreement for cooperation in the modernization of the
 Chinese,railway system. Actual projects, however,
 have been slow to materialize. The British Government
 has been quite distressed at the failure of the Chinese
 to conclude contracts with British firms for the sale of
 equipment, particularly in the military area. A recent
 report indicates that the United Kingdom will refuse to   25X1
 pay for future visits of Chinese delegations unless firm
 orders for British equipment and technology are
 placed. British officials have become particularly criti-
 cal of what they perceive to be Chinese efforts to
 sponge up foreign technology without paying for what

 The most publicized deal between the United Kingdom
 and China has been the sale of the Spey aircraft engine
 and engine technology by Rolls Royce. The deal in-
 volved the sale of 50 Spey engine kits for assembly in
 China. The goal of the program is to provide Chinese
 technicians with experience in aircraft engine assem-
 bly and design. Another objective is to assist the Chi-
 nese in the indigenous development and manufacture
 of parts for the engine and to improve the quality of the
 metals and parts used in engine production. Ulti-
 mately, the Chinese want to use the Spey engine in one
 of their own aircraft.
 In September 1980 the British firm Marconi Avionics
 concluded a deal with China for the sale of defense
 electronics equipment to modernize China's F-7 air-
 craft. Indications are, however, that the imperatives of
 readjustment have forced the Chinese to consider scal-
 ing down or even canceling the deal. This is the largest
 defense contract between the two countries to date.
 The equipment included navigation attack systems and
 heads-up displays for modernization of combat air-
 craft. This agreement follows a deal concluded be-
 tween Marconi and the Chinese in late 1979 for the
 purchase of five field artillery control equipment sets
 by China. The United Kingdom appears anxious to sell
 military equipment to those countries that previously
 have purchased Soviet equipment and are now seeking
 to improve design and operational capabilities of both
 equipment and aircraft. Discussions for the sale of
 tactical missiles between British Aerospace Dynamics
 and the Chinese also have been taking place.
 Hong Kong and Canton.
 Contracts and negotiations with China in the civilian
 area have included: (1) a joint project for oil explora-
 tion and drilling in the Yellow Sea with British Petro-
 leum, (2) negotiations regarding the sale of a spark plug
 manufacturing facility and associated production units
 with Smiths Industries and Brinesco of the United
 Kingdom, (3) a feasibility study for gold mining in
 Shandong involving Davy McKee, (4) a contract con-
 cluded in December 1979 with Babcock for a coal
 pulverizing mill and associated equipment for conver-
 sion of power stations from oil to coal, and (5) coal
 deposit surveys involving Frome Engineering. The
 United Kingdom has been pressing particularly hard to
 sell China offshore oil technology, based upon British
 experiences in the North Sea region. There also has
 been some discussion of British participation in the
 installation of a microwave telephone system between

 Sweden. A nongovernmental agreement was con-
 cluded between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and
 the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in October
 1978. Shortly afterwards, a formal government-to-
 government accord was signed for industrial, scientific,
 and technological cooperation. This latter pact is a 10-
 year agreement covering 1 I fields: mining, including
 upgrading iron, copper, and tungsten mining facilities;
 ball bearing production and design; metallurgical tech-
 nology; energy; transportation; tunneling equipment
 manufacture; telecommunications; food processing;
 forestry products processing; construction technology;
 and pharmaceuticals. China expressed considerable
 interest in the cooperative programs in telecommuni-
 cations and transport. As of early 1980, 20 Chinese
 students were in Sweden; this number has begun to
 increase and will probably reach 70 to 80 by the end of
 1981.
 Italian National Research Committee in May 1979, an
 exchange and cooperation agreement between the Chi-
 nese Academy of Social Sciences and the Italian Na-
 tional Research Committee in May 1980, and a
 cooperation agreement between China's Second Min-
 istry of Machine Building and the Italian Nuclear
 Energy National Committee in May 1980. This last
 agreement is designed to last for two years, with provi-
 sions for renewal. All agreements between the two
 countries are to take place on the basis of equality and
 mutual benefit. As of early 1980, there were approxi-
 mately 10 Chinese students and researchers studying
 in Italy under the exchange agreements between the
 two countries. The costs for the student exchange
 program are to be paid by the host country

 The Swedish Government has informed the Chinese
 Government that it has only limited resources to carry
 out these cooperative programs, especially since most
 of Sweden's resources are allocated for cooperation
 with the industrialized countries. It also has been
 careful to link its S&T cooperation programs with
 China to industrial projects so that the Swedish econo-
 my can realize immediate benefits from the programs.
 Petroleum equipment and hydropower development
 have been the two main areas of Swedish attention vis-
 a-vis China. In April 1980 the Swedish firm Svenska
 Varv won a contract for the sale of two oil tankers
 (80,000 deadweight tons each) to China. Negotiations
 between the two countries regarding a hydropower
 project at Tianshengqiao in Guizhou Province have
 been taking place. There has also been some discussion
 of another hydropower project at Lubuge in Yunnan
 Province. The main Swedish firm involved in the nego-
 tiations has been ASEA, Vasteras. As of mid-1980, no
 final agreement had been reached on either project.F
 ACTIP, the Italian subsidiary of Bastogi Holdings,
 signed a preliminary agreement for the design and
 construction of seven petrochemical plants near
 Beijing. The details of the agreement have yet to be
 announced and the projects are awaiting further
 discussion before plans can be implemented. The avail-
 ability of petroleum-related feedstocks will determine
 the feasibility of pursuing these projects in the near
 future.

 Italy. An S&T cooperation and exchange agreement
 between Italy and China was signed in October 1978.
 The agreement includes both cultural and scientific
 exchanges. This agreement was followed by an accord
 between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the

 nology Import Corporation to help modernize the
 Luoyang Tractor Plant, China's largest agricultural
 machinery facility.

 Negotiations with Italy for the sale of the OTOMAT
 missile and the OTO compact gun mount also have
 stalled. Oto Melara, a government-owned firm, had
 agreed to license the technologies used in both these
 items to China. The Chinese, however, apparently
 wanted Oto Melara to set up a manufacturing facility
 in China to produce the gun mounts. Chinese officials
 also wanted export rights for sales to selected Third
 World countries.
