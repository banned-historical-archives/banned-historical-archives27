 ANNOUNCER:   From Washington, Crossfire.   The hosts    for
 Crossfire:  on the left, Tom Braden;  on the right, Pat Buchanan.
 In the crossfire, Mike Farrell,       actor and head of the Committee
 of Concern.
 TOM BRADEN:   That vision of peace the world thought it
 saw  over  the  mountains in  El      Salvador  earlier this  week  was
 revealed today as a mirage.   The army of El Salvador,  assisted by
 U.S. advisers,  launched a major drive into rebel territory.        And
 at  the same  time,  rebel forces halted traffic across two-thirds
 of the nation.   No  trains  were     running,  no  buses,.trucks,  nor
 cars.
 Meantime,  President Reagan disassociated himself from a
 CIA pamphlet instructing Contra forces  in Nicaragua on how best
 to conduct assassinations.

 PAT  BUCHANAN:          Mike Farrell,  you're  a famous American
 from M*A*S*H.  This country has treated you  extremely well,  the
 United States. Now you're heading up this Committee for Concern
 about Central America.   The  country has treated  you  that well.
 Why  would  you have  a cocktail party and warmly receive a fellow
 named Daniel Ortega, who is the commandante  of  a Marxist regime
 in   Central America   which  says  in  its  national  anthem your
 country,  the United States is, quote, the enemy of mankind?
 MIKE FARRELL:   Well,  we had a party -- or I attended a
 party honoring or receiving Commandante Ortega because we  wanted
 to hear what he had to say.   We think it's important for people,

 if  you're  interested  in  peace,  to  at  least have  channels  of
 communication.
 BRADEN:   Do you mind if I just interject and ask whether
 you think President Reagan might have offered Gromyko           a cup of
 coffee at the White House the other day?
 BUCHANAN:   Mr.   Farrell,  it says  you  warmly    received
 --this is your...
 FARRELL:   Well,  I didn't say I warmly received.   I said
 I warmly received?
 BUCHANAN:   This  is  what  I read right  in my     file.   It
 says,  "Mike Farrell warmly received Commandante Ortega."
 FARRELL:    I  was there.   Ortega   was  there.    So     was
 Senator Christopher Dodd      of Connecticut.   So were a number        of
 other  loyal Americans.   Are you questioning my loyalty because I
 had some words with Commandate Ortega?
 BUCHANAN:   I'm asking you why you had a warm reception
 and a cocktail party.
 FARRELL:   Because he was coming.   Because he's the head
 of  state of  a  country  which  is  engaged    in  negoti         --  not  in
 negotiations,  in confrontation with this nation.      And I'm afraid
 ?it's headed toward warfare.   And  I  would  like  to see something
 done  to    lower the level  of tensions and see    if we can't  com-
 municate rather than have a war.
 BUCHANAN:  When you  talked to Commandante Ortega, did
 you  ask    him why  he  needed  all those    Cubans,  Soviets,  PLO,
 Libyans, Bulgarians,    and East Germans?
 FARRELL:    Not only does  he  say  that  there are  none
 there,  when I was there I saw none of them there.
 BUCHANAN:   Are you suggesting there are no Cubans?
 FARRELL:    I'm suggesting that   there  is no scientific,
 there is no intelligence     evidence to back  up    these ridiculous
 claims that are being made by people on the right of...
 BUCHANAN:   All right.   Let me give you  a person on the
 right.      Vice President George Bush...
 FARRELL:   Yes,  who  lied on  television just  the other
 night in the debate.
 BUCHANAN:    He  said    there were  2000  Cuban military
 advisers...

 FARRELL:   Cuban military  advisers.   That  is  correct.
 Yes, he said it,  and it was wrong.    It's not correct.
 BUCHANAN:    In  other  words,  George Bush  lied  to  the
 American people.
 FARRELL:   That's correct.  He also...
 BUCHANAN:   How does Mike Farrell know George Bush  is   a
 liar?   He was using -- he used to be head of the CIA.
 FARRELL:   He did.   And I think he  ought to know better
 than to make statements like that that are not verifiable and not
 factual.
 BUCHANAN:   How do you know he's wrong?
 FARRELL:   Well,  because the NATO  intelligence  agencies
 have said there are between two and three hundred Cuban military
 advisers in Nicaragua.
 BUCHANAN:   How do you  know they're  right  and Bush is
 wrong?
 FARRELL:    And because the other independent and objec-
 tive  organizations                       that  have  gone  in  there and  viewed the
 situation...
 BUCHANAN:   Give me some of those.
 BRADEN:   Mr. Buchanan, do you mind  if  I help you  with
 the problem of Mr. Bush?
 BUCHANAN:   Go ahead.
 BRADEN:   Mr. Bush made a number of misstatements...
 FARRELL:   He certainly did.
 BRADEN:   ...in the debate with Mrs. Ferraro.   They have
 been listed widely in the newspapers.   I'm surprised  you haven't
 read them.
 FARRELL:    He  also  said  that  Nicaragua was  a  gross
 violator   of   human   rights,   as   opposed   to   the   wonderful
 --implicitly, at least, as opposed to the wonderful human rights
 records of our  allies  there     (El Salvador,  Honduras  and Guate-
 mala),  which                       is  a joke.    I  mean  it's  so  inaccurate as  to be,
 unfortunately, humorous.

 things he's done for the Miskito Indians down there.
 FARRELL:   Commandante Ortega has done a number of things
 for the Miskitos, some of which were horrifying,  and  I  object  to
 them strongly, and have in Nicaragua and in the United States.
 BUCHANAN: What did you say to him,  Mike,  when Comman-
 dante Ortega --  did you say,                           "What  in the hell are you people
 doing with  the Miskitos?"
 FARRELL:   Is  there any purpose in this?  What about us
 in  the United States      concerning  ourselves with  United  States
 policy  and whether    or  not we    are  trying to teach people how to
 assassinate, manipulate,   blackmail and torture Contras in...
 BUCHANAN: Was Nora Astorga at this party?
 FARRELL:  No.   I don't  know that  she was.   I  did meet
 her,  though,  when         I  was in Nicaragua. What would you like to
 make of that?
 BUCHANAN:    I'll  tell  you what.   Nora Astorga,  she was
 one  of  the    opponents  of  the   Sandinistas.    She  invited  that
 general into her boudoir.
 FARRELL:   That's what I understand.
 BUCHANAN:  He was  assassinated  there.   His    eyes  were
 picked   out with  an     ice  pick. His  throat was  cut.      And his
 private parts were stuffed into his mouth    and his mouth was taped
 shut.   And that's the way he was delivered up.
 FARRELL: I don't know about any of those things.
 BUCHANAN: You didn't?
 FARRELL:  No.
 BUCHANAN:   What would you think about that?
 FARRELL:    I  would  think  that  to  be  a  horrifyingly
 anti-human and grisly thing to do.      What do you think about those
 things when they're done by the other side?
 BUCHANAN:   I agree with you on it.
 FARRELL:    Okay.   Then  I think  what we ought  to do  is
 find  where           we  have common ground and try and find a  way to
 communicate about what  we can do,  as     loyal  American citizens,

 BRADEN:   Let's be serious for a second.   Why can't the
 U.S.  policy move to  demilitarize  the  region?   Would  that be  a
 solution?    And  isn't  that  what the  Contadora process  is   all
 about?
 FARRELL:  Of course it is.   The Contadora process is the
 thing   that the  American  government  and  the  American   State
 Department has been supporting as a peace measure in that region
 for the last year.   And then the minute the Nicaraguans have  the
 audacity to  sign      it,  they turn their tail and say, "No, that's
 not appropriate anymore."   I don't understand that.
 BUCHANAN: Mike, look,  let's look at Nicaragua.   You
 obviously    think what's  going  on  there has --  bad  things have
 happened, but basically good things.
 FARRELL:   No. I simply think there are bad things and
 good  things  about     it. But  I  think  it  is  also  a Nicaraguan
 problem that should be resolved by Nicaraguan people,  not by the
 United States CIA.
 BUCHANAN:  Nicaragua has the support,  internationally,
 down there of Libya.    It has the support,    internationally...
 FARRELL: Oh, come on.
 BUCHANAN:   Hold  it,  hold it.   What I want to get at is
 this:   They've got     Cuba behind  them,  they've got  the Soviets,
 Bulgarians,   Libyans.       Let's  not  argue about how many are down
 there.   What other...
 FARRELL:   Let's  not  accept that as fact.   That is your
 opinion.
 BUCHANAN:  All right.   Let's say none of them are there,
 but they've got their diplomatic backing.
 What other fairly ideal or improving situation,  in terms
 of human rights and political       rights,  in what  other country in
 the world are those coalition of forces behind the regime?
 FARRELL:   I'm not sure I understand the question or  the
 point.       If we're going to talk about Nicaragua, let's talk about
 Nicaragua.   When I was there  and  talked to  people,  I  talked   to
 people in Nicaragua who were opposed to the Sandinistas.
 BUCHANAN:   Mike, here's what I'm  getting  at. Look,  by
 your friends ye shall know them.    Now,  if they've got these thugs
 and North Vietnamese...
 FARRELL:   Wait a minute.   Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

 First of all...
 BRADEN:   ...by their friends, ye shall know them.
 BUCHANAN:   The Bible, Braden.
 FARRELL:   Yes.   But  first  of all,  it seems to me that
 what we have to do is take    responsibility  for having empowered
 the  most   radical  elements  of   that  regime   by  our  atrociously
 negative and bellicose attitude toward them.   If we do  that,        we
 drive them into the arms of the very people...
 BUCHANAN:    Hold it.    The  most negative     and  radical
 elements are Borge and the Ortega brothers.
 FARRELL: The most radical elements in that      society  are
 being empowered by the United States'     position against Nicaragua.
 And it seems to me that what  we    need  to do  is  ameliorate    those
 problems by opening up communication.
 BUCHANAN:    When  the  Sandinistas  came  to  power,    the
 United States,  in 18 months or two years,  provided them with more
 aid  than   we'd  provided  the   Somoza  dynasty    in 40 years.     We
 provided them with more aid.
 FARRELL:   I don't know about that.
 BUCHANAN:   The President said that.   Is he lying?
 FARRELL:    The President has lied many times,  and we all
 BUCHANAN:   Why do you think the President is against the
 Nicaraguan revolution?
 FARRELL:    Because I think the President has an ideolog-
 ical fixation against anything he perceives as Marxist-Leninist,
 whether or not it is.   And he is unwilling to alter that based on
 new facts.
 BUCHANAN:   You suggest  it is not Marxist-Leninist down
 FARRELL:    I am suggesting  there are Marxist-,Leninists
 down there,  just as there are Christian Democrats down  there  and
 conservative elements and moderate elements.
 BUCHANAN:   I talked to Obando y  Bravo.   I have not met
 Ortega.   I  asked him what     they're doing good down there in the
 revolution.   He's the Archbishop,   as you   know,  of Managua. And
 he said  they do have universal education.   He said,  "But what's

 Approved For Release 2010/01/06: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000301410006-5
 wrong with  this  government is it is teaching the children class
 hatred."
 FARRELL:   That is Obandon y Bravo's opinion.   The people
 down  there that  I  talked  to    said  that  they  are  having  the
 opportunity  to learn for the first time in their lives.      They're
 having  health  care offered  them  for  the  first  time    in their
 lives.
 BRADEN:    Let me just  ask you, Mr. Farrell, is it not a
 fact  that  perhaps    Pat  ought  to look at  the history books  and
 discover  that  there has  been class hatred     in Central   America
 since the Spanish arrived?
 FARRELL: I think history books will verify that.
 BUCHANAN:    Let me   ask you  this.  A  priest,   Father
 Bismarck...
 FARRELL:   Carbaio (?).
 BUCHANAN:     ...Carbaio,   stripped  naked  and  marched
 through the streets by the Sandinistas.   Why'd they do that?
 FARRELL:    They were trying  to  embarrass him   because
 --and they did it by having a woman pose as a seductress and have
 him come in and try to seduce her,   in exchange for which, when he
 took his clothes off, they made a fool of him.
 You  know,  so what?   They are doing terrible things, and
 so are we.   My point is,  isn't there a more humane  and  a better
 way to proceed in terms of international relations than this kind
 of stupid and unhuman activity?
 BUCHANAN:   Let's assume for the sake of argument that we
 have a Marxist-Leninist regime in power by force of arms,     they've
 got  a hundred thousand people  in power.   For the sake of argu-
 ment, how do you get that type of regime out of power so that you
 can have a pluralistic and democratic society?
 FARRELL:   First  of all,  what  you have  to  do      is  com-
 municate  with  them.                       You've   got     to  open up  some  channels of
 communication in which you can bring to bear  the  pressures,     the
 moral pressures we have,     and I think we have, at our...
 BUCHANAN:   Name one example of a regime that has been --
 a  regime of that                character, Marxist-Leninist, or even a right-

 BUCHANAN:   Argentina was turned over by moral pressure?
 FARRELL:   That's correct.   Argentina just awarded Jimmy
 Carter an  award --      gave Jimmy Carter and award and thanked him
 for effectively being the sponsor of their democracy.
 BUCHANAN:   You don't think that the discrediting of the
 junta by virtue of its having attacked -- or seized the Falkland
 Islands a defeat in war?
 FARRELL:   All I can tell you is that President Alfonsin
 said Jimmy Carter's human rights policy was directly  responsible
 for his accession to the presidency.
 BUCHANAN:    And     you  think  that  will  work  with  the
 Sandinistas.
 FARRELL:   Well,  I think it's worth a try.     I think it's
 going to work a hell of a lot better than teaching people how to
 murder and teaching...
 BRADEN:    Pat,  do  you  think  assassination     would work
 Gentlemen, we have to take a break.
 BUCHANAN:    Our   guest  is  Mike  Farrell,  a    famous and
 popular actor.   You probably know him from M*A*S*H,      if not from a
 number  of  other     shows.    He's  the  head  of  a  Hollywood-based
 Committee of Concern,    and it's concerned about American     involve-
 ment in Central America.
 Mike  Farrell,  you  are  a   popular  actor,  and  I  guess
 you've got a great following here in the  country.        I'm sure   you
 do,  as all other actors do.     Are you not concerned that something
 might happen to Mike Farrell such as happened to Jane Fonda?        She
 went  over made --  I  think she still -- she thinks it as stupid
 now, but posed behind that antiaircraft gun in North Vietnam.
 FARRELL:   Let's  back up  a  second.   There are a lot of
 people who like M*A*S*H and      there  are  some  people who  like  the
 work  I  do.   I don't consider them a following in terms of doing
 what I say to do or leading where I go.   People are people,  and I
 think  they  can discern the difference between me as an actor and
 me as a citizen.   That's all I'm suggesting.
 BUCHANAN: Yeah,     but  you're  not here  because   you're
 simply,  you know, a citizen concerned.
 FARRELL:   No, of course.   Because citizens who come in

 here  and   object  to  the  government's,  the  Administration's
 policies aren't invited on your show, generally speaking.   I  beg
 your  pardon. Many citizens who are not known do not get invited
 on television shows because the media operates   the way  it does.
 So the fact is that...
 BUCHANAN:   You're making my point, which is that you're
 here because you're a famous person.   Okay?
 FARRELL:   Uh-huh.
 BUCHANAN:   Are you   not  concerned that you're going to
 become identified, say,     as Ed Asner and Jane  Fonda,  especially,
 did?
 FARRELL:    No,  I'm  not  concerned.    I  mean  it's  like
 saying  am  I  concerned    that  I'm going to be  elected  President
 because Ronald    Reagan did.     I'm concerned about certain things,
 as a citizen,  and  I    think I  ought  to be  able to  express those
 feelings.
 BUCHANAN:   What I'm getting at is Jane Fonda, obviously,
 made a hell of a mistake going up to North Vietnam.
 FARRELL:    People do make mistakes.     Ronald Reagan has
 made mistakes. So did John Wayne.
 BUCHANAN:    Are  you  concerned  that   you're  making  a
 FARRELL:    I'm not concerned that I'm making a mistake.
 I'm concerned about the mess I see and about what seems      to me  to
 be totally  inconsistent behavior between the ideals I was taught
 in school in this country and the practices that this  government
 is carrying forward.
 BUCHANAN:   Suppose Ronald Reagan,   in his heart of hearts
 --  and he's     probably  as  decent  a guy  as  you  --  is  trying to
 prevent happening      to the Nicaraguan people what happened to the
 Cuban people under      Fidel  Castro.   Would  you   not  agree that at
 least his objectives are good, then?
 FARRELL:   If that is his objective,  I don't think that I
 would  necessarily      argue,  although his  methods  are  absolutely
 inhumane, and I think un-American.
 BRADEN:   Well,  let me ask you...
 BUCHANAN:   You mean fighting militarily?
 BRADEN:   Mr.  Farrell,  let me ask you about the actor who

 is  in  the White House.   The  question has been raised recently
 about   whether he  knows  what's  going  on  in  the  United States
 Government.    Now,  you  know, I   suppose,  that we had  recently
 passed a law forbidding the Central Intelligence Agency  from any
 --  conducting  any  policies of assassination, encouraging assas-
 sination, or indeed assassinating.   What is your view of                          whether
 Ronald Reagan  is   in control of this government when we discover
 down  among  the Contras  a  pamphlet put  out by  the CIA  telling
 people  specifically    how  to  assassinate  the  leaders of   the
 opposition?
 FARRELL:     Well, President Reagan said last night that
 the CIA is not out of control.   President  Reagan  knew about  the
 mining of the harbors in Nicaragua.   President Reagan knows about
 the covert activities,  and has.   Although it was denied original-
 ly  in his  Administration,  it                  is  now being  relatively  freedly
 admitted. President Reagan knows about the things that are going
 on.   And    I  think President ought to just take a look at what we
 say we believe in,  and then formulate policies that are based   on
 some kind of consistency with those beliefs.
 BUCHANAN:  Mike Farrell, though,  look.   What I'm picking
 up here is a real hostility and a gross opposition to the idea of
 the use of military force.   Now,  the communists      or  the Marxists
 or the leftists...
 BRADEN:   We're talking about assassination, Pat.
 FARRELL:   I've served in the military  of this  country,
 BRADEN:   We're talking about assassination, Pat.   Do you
 defend that?   Do you think the CIA did the right thing?
 BUCHANAN:   I think they probably picked up one of Ho Chi
 Minh or Che Guevara's or Mao Tse-tung's pamphlets, sent them down
 there, which do recommend assassination.
 FARRELL:   They just authored this.
 BRADEN:    They wrote it themselves.
 FARRELL:    Are they beyond offering such advice?
 BUCHANAN:    Do you  think Bill  Casey  would deliberately
 violate the law and send down...
 FARRELL:   I  think he has deliberately violated the law.
 Absolutely.
 BRADEN:     Are you kidding?

 FARRELL:   And that's  why Pat Moynihan called      for his
 resignation and that's why  Tip O'Neill  called  for his       resigna-
 tion.    Yes,  I  think  he's  violated                       the  law,  and  I  think  he
 deserves to be the hell out of there.    Yeah.
 BUCHANAN:   How about  the President? Do you think the
 President...
 FARRELL:   I think he ought     to be ashamed  of himself.
 And I think every American who understands      what  this  country  is
 about  ought  to be outraged at that kind of behavior on the part
 of a representative agency in this country.
 BUCHANAN:   Mike Farrell,  do  you know what the Contras
 are doing in Nicaragua?
 FARRELL:    The  Contras  are doing  in  Nicaragua?    Damn
 right I know what the Contras are doing.
 BUCHANAN:    They're shooting  and   killing  and   they're
 conducting a guerrilla war.
 FARRELL:    You hear what you just said?   Yes, conducting
 a guerrilla war.
 BUCHANAN:   That's right.
 FARRELL:    Sponsored by  the United States   Government.
 And that is the  difference.   I  don't care -- if the   people of
 Nicaragua want to       conduct a guerrilla war against the Sandinis-
 tas,  that is their business.                    If they  cannot  do so     without  CIA
 funding,    without  your tax dollars and my tax dollars supporting
 it, then  it  doesn't  deserve to happen.    These  people  are     no
 better than mercenaries.  They have been mercenaries.
 BUCHANAN:   Wait a minute now.   Hold it a second.
 FARRELL:   That's exactly what they are.   That's what you
 call a soldier who does what he does because he gets  paid  for     it
 by...
 BUCHANAN:   You are talking about 20,000 Nicaraguans who
 are being paid pennies...
 FARRELL:   That's,  I'm afraid,  an overstatement of...
 BUCHANAN:   How about freedom fighters?   Would  you  call
 George Washington a mercenary?
 FARRELL:    That's one of the statements that George Bush
 made the other night that I think is egregious.   I think to call

 the Contras  that  operate  in Nicaragua freedom fighters is like
 calling Jack the Ripper a feminist.
 BUCHANAN:   They are  trying to recapture the revolution
 betrayed by a bunch of...
 FARRELL: That's what they say.
 BUCHANAN:   All these guys.   Name one  of the  leaders  of
 the Contras,  the  leaders,  Colero,      Eden Pastors.   Is he a mer-
 cenary?
 FARRELL:   Eden Pastors has refused to have anything to
 do with CIA money.     Eden Pastors...
 BUCHANAN:    He has?
 FARRELL: Yes, he has.
 BUCHANAN:   You better call Bill Casey on that.   Get your
 information up to date.
 FARRELL:   Yes,  I'll call Bill Casey.   My information is
 as up to date as I can have it.
 BUCHANAN:   Why would Eden Pastors...
 FARRELL:   Eden Pastors has said anybody who is in league
 with  the Somozistas and the FDN and takes CIA money is a traitor
 to the cause of a free Nicaragua.
 BRADEN:   He's said that many times, Pat.
 BUCHANAN:   Why does Eden Pastors take up arms and try to
 overthrow forcibly...
 FARRELL: Because he disagrees with the Sandinistas.
 BUCHANAN:   ...the government in Nicaragua?
 FARRELL: Because he disagrees with the Sandinistas,     and
 that is his right.
 BUCHANAN:   Why don't they settle it at the polls?
 FARRELL:     Maybe  they  will.    Ortega  said  after  the
 election on  the 4th  of November -- and I understand you believe
 all Marxists are liars and he probably doesn't mean what he says.
 But  what  he said     was,  and  let us  test  him  on it,  after  the
 election   there  will be    an   open congressional   forum  in  which
 Pastors and  all  of the others who are opposed to the regime now

 will  be     able  to  take part in formulating a new constitution for
 Nicaragua.
 Now,  why  don't we call his bluff?   Instead of murdering
 their people,      why don't we just let them see  if  they're   telling
 the truth?
 BUCHANAN:   Mike Farrell, what I can't understand is why
 you would call mercenaries,  not  Americans,       but Nicaraguans   who
 are fighting to recapture a revolution which has been betrayed to
 Cubans...
 FARRELL:   Because, Pat...
 BRADEN:   Well,  who's paying them,  Pat?
 BUCHANAN:   Who   paid  the American Revolutionaries?   The
 BRADEN:   Not the CIA.
 BUCHANAN: The French,  the French.
 BRADEN:   Oh, come on.
 FARRELL:    Okay.    Are we  going  to  be  patterning  our
 government after the French now?
 BUCHANAN:   Look, wait a minute.   The American Revolution
 succeeded because it was supported by the King of France.
 FARRELL:    It  is  fairly clearly  known,  and I think you
 know  it    as  well,  that  the  so-called  Contras,   the   so-called
 freedom     fighters  would disappear if  it were not for CIA money.
 Now,  what does that say about their commitment?
 BUCHANAN:  What it says is that the Ortega brothers have
 established themselves      in power  as   effectively  as Castro;  and
 unless you use military force, they're not going out.
 FARRELL:    Oh,  that's utter nonsense.   I've been  there,
 Pat.   Why  don't you just go down and look around?   Why don't you
 talk to the people?      There are people...
 BUCHANAN:    We've  had    a  lot  of  them come  up  here.
 They're all refugees.
 FARRELL:    That's  fine.     There  are  people down there
 sitting in their houses disagreeing with       the Sandinistas   today.
 There are six political...

 FARRELL:   Hold  it  yourself.   There are six  political
 parties running against the Sandinistas in this election.
 BUCHANAN:   Six political parties?
 FARRELL:    Six  political  parties.   One  of  them  is the
 Communist   Party, which is not the Sandinista Party.   One of them
 is the Conservative Independent Party.       One of them is the Social
 Democratic Party.       And they are running in this election against
 the Sandinistas,  and they're  allowed  to do  so.      Now,  why don't
 people know that?
 BUCHANAN:   You mean to  tell me that, according to Mike
 Farrell,    what we've got is sort of a free election down  there  in
 Central     America    with  legitimate  opposition?    Why are  they
 crushing the free press?   How can you have an election without     a
 free press?
 FARRELL:   They say...
 BUCHANAN:   They say what?   Ortega told you this?
 FARRELL:    ...they are doing the same things, in terms of
 press  censorship,      that  the United States Government did during
 the war,    and they are doing it because of the  war.   If we     would
 release     the  pressure of war against them, then we could find out
 if they're telling the truth.
 BUCHANAN:   Look,  they've been  in power, Mike Farrell,
 five years.
 FARRELL:     And  they did  not  originally  have      press
 censorship.
 [Confusion of voices]
 BRADEN:      Isn't it true -- is it not possible,  at least,
 that, minus the  Contras,     the Nicaraguan  people might     want  our
 aid, need our aid,       and come to us and talk about it?
 FARRELL:   Of course.   Absolutely.
 BRADEN:   But if you're fighting a war, Pat...
 BUCHANAN: Tom,    come on.    We've  got  to go  through  it
 again?
 Mike Farrell, name one Marxist regime which has come to
 power,  installed  itself,  which  has  surrendered  power        in  an
 election,    one in the whole world.

 FARRELL:   Well, of course  it's  irrelevant,  if  they're
 Marxists.   There are also...
 BUCHANAN:   You don't think they are?
 FARRELL:    No,  I  don't  think they're Marxists.   I don't
 think they're all Marxists.   I don't think  Miguel D'Escoto,      the
 Catholic priest,  is a godless Marxist.
 BUCHANAN:  I know Miguel D'Escoto well.   I went to...
 FARRELL:   Do you think he's a godless Marxist?
 BUCHANAN:   I  think Miguel D'Escoto, an old  friend    of
 mine, has lost his way, he's given up his priesthood.
 FARRELL:   Yes, but do you think he's a godless   Marxist,
 as the Vice President called them on...
 BUCHANAN:   I  think he  is  a  Marxist.   That's  exactly
 right.
 FARRELL:   Is he a godless Marxist?
 BUCHANAN:  That doesn't make much difference.
 FARRELL:   It does make a difference.   The people in this
 country who despise communism in a knee-jerk manner do so because
 they  call  it    atheistic  communism.   Now, if it's not going to be
 atheistic communism...

 tried to kill Fidel Castro.       Is that right?
