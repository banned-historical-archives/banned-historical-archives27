 Chile:   Outcast At The UN
 Stories circulating in UN circles suggest that
 an all-out campaign is being promoted to expel Chile
 from the coming General Assembly meeting.  Although
 the extent of anti-Chile sentiment is difficult to
 gauge,   there is little doubt that the image of the
 Pinochet government has dropped to an all-time low.
 Among the reasons cited by Chilean UN delegates
 for this negative attitude are:
 ...President Pinochet's refusal to allow a sched-
 uled visit by a UN human rights investigating
 group.
 ...The Chilean government's welcome to a South
 African Davis Cup team.
 ...Pinochet's recent statements barring elections.
 ...Handouts circulated among African and Asian
 UN missions by the Cubans reproducing extremist
 and racist articles on the UN appearing in the
 Santiago press.
 ...Reports circulating at the UN on possible action
 by the Chilean junta to outlaw the Christian
 Democratic Party.
 The chairman of the UN human rights investigating
 commission is extremely bitter over Pinochet's abrupt
 decision to turn back the group earlier this month after
 it had traveled as far as Lima.  His resentment toward
 the Pinochet government was summed up in his statement
 to the US delegation at the New York headquarters:
 "People just don't behave like that."  The commission's
 report, which is due by the end of August, will probably

 portray the junta in an unfavorable light, and it is
 certain to arouse further animosity within the UN
 toward the Chilean regime.
 To counter this adverse trend, the Chilean govern-
 ment is sending good-will delegations to Africa and
 the Middle East.   The prospects of rallying substantial
 support appear dim, however.   If pressures against Chile
 continue to be exerted on the international level,
 Pinochet's right-wing advisers may call on him to have
 the country withdraw from the United Nations altogether.

 Venezuela:   New AD Secretary-General
 Former Interior Minister Luis Pinerua Ordaz took
 a long step toward obtaining the governing Accion Demo-
 cratica  (AD) party's 1978 presidential nomination with
 the party's recent selection of him as secretary-general.
 In contrast to the Social Christian Party  (COPEI),  the
 principal  opposition party, AD now appears strengthened
 and unified for the presidential election.
 Following his selection by AD's 20th national con-
 vention, Pinerua moved to unite the party by calling on
 the convention to name his major opponent, Carlos
 Canache Mata, to be executive political secretary of the
 national executive committee--the party's top policy-
 making body.   In an address to the convention, President
 Carlos Andres Perez called for party unity against the
 opposition.   By the end of the convention, the party
 consensus appeared to be general satisfaction with its
 present direction.
 Pinerua's victory makes him the clear front-runner
 for the presidential nomination, although he will face
 some opposition within the party.  As secretary-general
 and with a cooperative new executive committee, he will
 be in virtual control of the party machinery.   Should
 division within COPEI persist, he would likely also have
 little difficulty kee in  the presidency in AD's hands.

 Venezuela:   Colombian Demarche for Gulf Condominium
 Venezuela has shown cautious official interest
 in a recent proposal by Colombian President Lopez
 Michelsen to close the Gulf of Venezuela to foreign
 vessels.  The two countries' dispute over marine and
 submarine sovereignty in the gulf is unlikely to be
 readily resolved, however.
 In a speech to the Colombian senate, Lopez pro-
 posed that Colombia and Venezuela form a condominium
 over the gulf and jointly exploit its resources.   He
 also proposed that the gulf be declared a historic
 bay and be closed to all ships except those of the two
 countries.
 The Venezuelan Government has shown some interest
 in the proposal for closing the gulf to foreign ves-
 sels, although major political leaders have rejected
 the proposal of a condominium and have urged the govern-
 ment to reject it also.  The government has reacted to
 the generally negative press and public response by as-
 suring that any agreement would be made in the open and
 that negotiations on the proposal would be separated
 from those on delimitation of sovereignty in the gulf.
 The dispute over the gulf has been a significant
 bilateral problem since it became a source of oil.
 Both countries have complex historical and legal claims
 at least to partial sovereignty, and it is unlikely that
 either would agree to a joint condominium without first
 defining national boundaries.   Colombia has the most to
 gain from any compromise and would look favorably on al-
 most any agreement.   Venezuela must be more cautious, as
 an agreement would almost surely be criticized by the
 opposition or, more important,   by the military, as a
 sell-out.

 Although the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry has
 cautiously encouraged the condominium idea, it has
 made plain that any agreement to delimit the disputed
 area must be concluded separately.  Nevertheless,
 Colombia's proposal to close the gulf and Venezuela's
 responsiveness to the idea is a new development that
 has changed the character and possibly the future of
 the dispute.

 Panama:   Treaty Stand Gets Approval
 The government is continuing to garner endorse-
 ments of its canal treaty negotiations posture.   Fol-
 lowing up on the session with student leaders on July
 9, government spokesmen met with the members of the
 National Assembly on July 18.   After listening to
 explanations of the government's objectives and strat-
 egy by several officials involved in the negotiations,
 the Assembly passed a resolution giving General Torrijos
 an expression of confidence and wide latitude to explore
 several options intended to further Panama's cause.
 These options include: establishing diplomatic re-
 lations with all nations, specifically the USSR and
 China;  joining the nonaligned movement at its meeting
 next month in Lima;  inscribing the canal issue on the
 agenda of the UN General Assembly this fall; working to
 secure commitments of support from all legislatures in
 the hemisphere;  exploring the possibility of convening
 a conference of Latin American army chiefs to consider
 the "colonialist" situation in Panama.
 The statements by the officials, as well as the
 Assembly resolution, reconfirmed the government's in-
 tention to follow the path of negotiations.   At the
 same time, however, the declarations were obviously
 intended to assure the public that Torrijos is zealous-
 ly protecting Panama's basic interests and that he will
 not surrender these to get a treaty.
 The officials emphasized that Panama's fundamental
 interests in a treaty lay in the areas of duration,  ju-
 risdiction, and the amount of land and water that Panama
 would obtain at the outset of a new treaty.   They insist-
 ed that Panama must secure total control of the canal
 before the end of the century, and that jurisdiction has
 to be transferred to Panama within three years of the

 signing of a treaty.   One member of the negotiating
 team said that Panama will have to compromise by per-
 mitting three US military bases to remain during the
 time a new treaty remains in force.   He said that the
 main objective should be to reduce the present US mili-
 tary presence, and that the slogan "Bases, No" being
 used as a rallying cry by some student groups is not
 realistic.   Panamanian officials who deal with the
 technical aspects of the canal issue maintained that
 the US requires only 4 percent of the area of the
 present Canal Zone to operate and defend the canal.
 The officials claimed that Torrijos had ordered them
 not to deal with compensation until the other, higher
 priority issues, had been resolved.
 The declaration by the Assembly, which is securely
 under Torrijos'  thumb, provides him with a highly visible
 show of support.   Torrijos will use it to cover his polit-
 ical flanks;  the declaration significantly noted the gov-
 ernment's "obligations" to explore "peaceful" options,
 reaffirmed faith in Torrijos' negotiating policy, and
 called on local organizations to undertake any directed
 activities. The Panamanian leader has no intention of
 being forced into precipitate confrontation tactics and
 will point to the Assembly's statement in warding off any
 minority group clamoring for tactics which could lead to
 uncontrolled violence.
 Now that positions attributed to Panama and the US
 have been put on the public record, it will be hard for
 the Panamanians to compromise.   At the same time, the
 Panamanian negotiators, by stressing the complexity of
 the negotiations and the continuing wide differences on
 certain basic issues, appeared to be signaling to the
 public that a new treaty is not likely to be achieved
 soon.

 Ecuador:   Coping With Civilians
 The military government of President Rodriguez
 has tempered its stand against the civilian opposi-
 tion, although Minister of Government Guillermo Duran
 continues to take a hard line.
 Apparently recognizing that the harshness of its
 reaction to criticism was unnecessarily reminiscent of
 its early months in power in 1972, the government has
 abruptly ended its attack on two important critics.
 Columnist and former foreign minister Julio Prado
 emerged from hiding last week, when an order for his
 arrest was rescinded.   Prado's column in the liberal
 Quito daily El Tiempo has criticized both government
 actions and personnel, and he has continued to write
 from underground since becoming a fugitive in April.
 Conservative Party national director Julio Cesar
 Trujillo returned to Quito, also last week, from an
 army base in the eastern jungle to which he had been
 exiled in May.  He insisted that his release did not
 suggest that his opposition activities would diminish
 in any way. This promise of continued opposition was
 made all the more believable by its timing--following
 by one day similar statements by leaders of the Radical
 Liberal Party and the Christian Democratic Party.
 Despite these apparent changes in the government's
 attitude toward the opposition, Minister of Government
 Duran used the occasion of a press conference on July
 16 to rail against "traitorous conspiring" against the
 military government on the part of civilians.   Well
 known for his short temper and lack of tact, Duran
 warned the opposition not to interfere with the revolu-
 tionary government's "principles of authentic democracy."
 Predictably, Duran's statements outraged leaders of the
 major political parties and all major newspapers, in-
 cluding the conservative El Comercio of Quito.

 The government may be trying to keep the opposi-
 tion off balance by offering the olive branch and the
 billy club simultaneously. More likely it is making
 a genuine effort to accommodate reasoned criticism,
 but is having some difficulty guiding Duran down the
 path of compromise.   In any event, growing numbers of
 government leaders are realizing their need for respon-
 sible civilians--to share both in the government and
 in the blame for the economic problems that are in-
 creasingly befalling the country.

 Trinidad-Tobago:   What Makes Eric Travel?
 Prime Minister Eric Williams'  third major foreign
 trip in the last nine months reflects his continuing
 aspiration to play a significant role on the inter-
 national stage.   During June and July he visited Cuba,
 the US, the Soviet Union, Romania, The Netherlands,
 and Austria.   His previous two ventures took him to
 the Far East. Williams can now reflect on his meet-
 ings with such diverse personages as President Ford,
 Secretary Kissinger, Mao Tse-tung, Fidel Castro,
 Aleksey Kosygin, Kurt Waldheim, and Nicolae Ceausescu.
 Besides enhancing his own personal stature,
 Williams' most recent trip was motivated by his dual
 desires to influence Caribbean Law of the Sea policy
 and obtain development aid in order to diversify and
 expand Trinidad's petroleum-dominated economy.
 While in Cuba and the US, Williams attempted to
 sell his idea of a special Law of the Sea arrangement
 for the Caribbean that would afford equal rights and
 access to all Caribbean states.   He believes that the
 alternative of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone would
 primarily benefit mainland nations such as Venezuela
 to the detriment of the smaller island states.
 Williams'Law of the Sea policy coincides with his
 long-held goal of an integrated Caribbean region with
 the island states serving as the inner core, thereby
 allowing Trinidad with its relatively strong economic
 position to play a dominant role.   In recent months
 Williams has viewed Venezuela's use of its oil revenues
 in the Caribbean as a threat to his objectives.   He has
 crane so far as to accuse Venezuela of "neocolonialism."

 Undaunted, Williams reemphasized his proposal to
 Secretary Kissinger and UN Secretary General Waldheim.
 He believes that the US is a potential supporter of his
 position because of its interests in Puerto Rico and
 the Virgin Islands and its desire for the free transit
 of international waters.
 During his travels to the Soviet Union and Europe,
 Williams turned his attention to shoring up his own
 domestic economy.   Although Trinidad's oil exports have
 provided substantial economic growth during the past
 year, the prime minister wants to diversify export mar-
 kets and obtain new sources of development aid.   Histor-
 ically, the US has been Trinidad's major trading partner
 and source of technology.   While Williams does not find
 this distasteful, he sees long-term benefits in diversi-
 fication.
 His European travels appear to have reaped some
 initial modest successes.   In the Soviet Union he laid
 the groundwork for expanding trade and signed a number
 of technical agreements.   The Romanians have promised
 to establish a tractor assembly plant in Trinidad and,
 as a result of his trip to The Netherlands, Williams
 hopes to obtain a  reduction-process steel plant from a

 Williams' previous ventures to the Far East also
 appear to be paying tangible dividends.   Trinidad of-

 quantities of cocoa, coffee, and sugar to China, and
 possible trade agreements are being studied with Japan
 and Hong Kong.

 Mexico:   Border Industries in Trouble
 After achieving an impressive growth record in
 its first decade, Mexico's border industry program
 has been hit by sharply increased labor costs and the
 US recession.
 Border industry firms, mostly US subsidiaries,
 produce various articles from US components--selling
 them mainly to the United States, where they are sub-
 ject to duties on only the value added.   A sharp down-
 turn in export sales and the closure of numerous plants
 this year have set back border industry operations and
 are raising questions about the program's future.   Ex-
 ports to the United States (net of US-made components)
 were only $125 million in the first four months of 1975;
 they are unlikely to exceed much more than $300 million
 for the whole year, compared with $464 million in 1974.
 Between October 1974 and April 1975, 32 plants,  in-
 cluding two of the largest, ceased operations, and 60
 plants markedly reduced their work force.  As a result,
 border industry employment declined from 70,000 to
 45,000 and probably will slip to less than 40,000 by
 the end of the year.
 While the firms are being hurt by the US recession,
 the most serious developments are rapidly rising wages
 and other operating costs.  Mexico boosted average wage
 rates 22 percent in October 1974; wages are now 86 per-
 cent above the January 1973 level.   At an average of
 about $1.20 per hour including fringe benefits, Mexican
 wages are now two to five times rates in other Latin
 American and Southeast Asian countries where US sub-
 sidiaries operate under the same tariff provisions.
 Several firms shifted operations to Haiti, El Salvador,
 and other low-wage Latin American countries, which re-
 cently have intensified efforts to attract this kind
 of plant.

 Mexico City, which strongly backs the border
 industry program, has taken steps to improve the pro-
 fitability of the participating firms.   It simplified
 regulations in June and may give firms more leeway in
 selling their products within Mexico.   Requests that
 border firms be eligible for tax rebates on exports
 have been rejected for fear of US countervailing
 duties.               Unless the government restricts growth of
 wages and further simplifies its costl    re ulations
 border industry recovery will be slow.
