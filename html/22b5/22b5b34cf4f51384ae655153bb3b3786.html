significant Communiat direction or assistance to revolutionary groupe 
in the United States]. We have been collaborating closely in this effort 
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and disseminating information to 
it. Existing Agency collection resources are being employed wherever 
feaeible and new sources arc being sought through independent means 
:j as well as with the assistance of foreign intelligence GerViCOSI and the 
� Federal Bureau of Investigation. Cf course, the Katzenbach guidelines 
have inhibited our access to certain persons who might have information 
on etfortu by Communist intelligence services to exploit revolutionary

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCY 
FROM: Tom Charles Huston 
Staff Assistant to the President 
' The President has directed that a report on foreign 
Communist support of revolutionary protest movements in this . 
.country be prepared for his study. He has specifically requested. 
.4 that the report draw upon all the resources available to the 
� intelligence community and that it be as detailed as possible. 
e. 
I' "Support" should be liberally construed to include all 
1 : activities by foreign Communists designed to encourage or 
-i assist revolutionary protest movements in the United States. 
On the basis of earlier reports submitted to the President 
on a more limited aspect of this problem, it appears that our 
present intelligence collection capabilities in this area may 
be inadequate. The President would like to know what resources 
: we presently have targeted toward monitoring foreign Communist 
: support of revolutionary youth activities in this country, how 
, effective they are, what gaps in our intelligence exist because 
of either inadequate resources or a low priority of attention, 
� and *hat steps could be taken, if he directed, to provide the. 
�: maximum possible coverage of these activities. 
I have asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 
submit their response to the President's request to me by 
Monday, June 30th. I would appreciate it if the Agency would 
provide their contribution by that date. 
Although I realize that the Agency submits all information 
it has available in this area to the Bureau, I would like to see 
a broad sample of the raw data which the Agency prcduces. And 
I am particularly interested in the Agency's response to the 
second part of the President's request; e.g., your present 
ability to collect information of this type. 
The President has assigned a high priority to this 
project, and I know that you will render the utmost assistance 
in its preparation.

include extensive information available from 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation on all 
aspects of the subject; from the Department 
h� of Defense on draft resistance/deserter matters; 
or from the National Security Agency. The 
relative lack of firm Agency-developed 
����information on the subject may either rep. 
resent the true situation, i.e., the absence 
of extensive foreign Communist support,

well-placed sources.

of only a very limited amount of foreign Communist assistance to 
revolutionary protest movements in the United States. There is very 
1/4 little reporting on Communist assistance in the form of funding or 
training and no evidence of Communist direction or control of any 
United States revolutionary protest movement. The bulk of our infor-
mation illustrates Communist encouragement of these movements 
through propaganda methods and exploitation of international 
conferences. � 
�For the purposes of this report these movements are defined 
to include militant Black groups, radical student and youth groups, 
anti-Vietnam war groups, and draft resistance/deserter groups. 
Support given to these movements by Cuba, the USSR, and 
Communist China is discussed in the following pages.

The Cuban Embassy in Paris has been used as a base for 
contacting Black militants in Europe, both directly and indirectly, 
but the purpose of these contacts is not known. The Prensa 
Latina  representative in Paris said in January 1968 that Cuban.. 
supported propaganda outlets would be used to spread Black . 
Power ideas to Black U. S. military and civilian personnel 
in Europe; the extent of the actual effort since then is not known. 
� There is one unsubstantiated report that in June 1968 the 
Cuban intelligence service dispatched an agent to the United States 
with instructions to encourage American Blacks to defect to Cuba. 
-� 
.� Although there was Cuban refugee reporting in 1967 on 
alleged training in Cuba of American Blacks for subversive 
operations in the United States, these reports have not been sub-
stantiated. Since 1967 at least 15 to 20 Black militants are known 
to have travelled to Cuba, but details of their activites there 
are not known. When Stokely Carmichael, visited Cuba in 1967 his 
"interpreter" was a Cuban intelligence service officer who was 
subsequently assigned to the Cuban Mission to the United Nations 
in New York.

FOREIGN DISS:f.T.40 . A3!ot D 
Soviet propaganda in the future will probably be guided 
primarily by the 17 June 1969 declaration of the conference 
of Communist parties. The declaration sets forth the U.S. 
as the main enemy, and views favorably the opposition of 
radical U.S. youth and students to the Vietnam war, the 
draft, racism, and "monopoly control of universities." It 
expresses strong support for "the struggle of the Negro 
population of the U.S. for their rights." It urges Communist 
parties to devote considerable attention to work among students. 
The CPUSA has enthusiastically endorsed this line. Until 
the fall of 1968 when the Soviets tried to formulate a more 
positive approach to the youth movement, Soviet propaganda 
sought to explain all U.S. protest and unrest in classical 
Communist terms, and avoided giving publicity to extremist 
groups. The Soviets were noticeably concerned over the 
threat of contagion from undisciplined Western youth movements 
and over the disrur tive impact of such groups on orthodox 
Communist parties. 
Havana media publicizes statements and articles by 
members of the Black Panthers. the Students for a Democratic 
Society, and such prominent individuals as David Dellinger 
and Mark Rudd. However, there has been a marked abatement 
,of such propaganda in the past six months as a result of media 
'preoccupation with domestic issues. Cuban broadcasts generally 
avoid detailed accounts of U.S. student activities, but stress 
that the rebellion of American youths is symptomatic of the 
sickness of U.S. life and institutions. The emphasis in youth-
targeted propaganda is on Vietnam and Che Guevara-type 
revolutionary feats.

World Assembly for Peace. East Berlin, June 1969 
7 
Currently, a number of U.S. delegates are attending 
the World Assembly for Peace in East Berlin. This gathering 
constitutes the de facto Eighth Congress of the World Peace 
Council and is a convocation of all international Communist 
front leaders behind a facade of some 900 invited "supporters 
of peace." The delegation from dile U.S. consists largely 
of representatives of the CPUSA and CPUSA fronts, but also 
includes such organizations as the Women Strike for Peace 
(WSP), the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the 
Black Panthers. The WSP representatives were also invited 
to attend the International Women's Conference which is 
scheduled subsequently for Helsinki. Finland. Expenses 
for the trip to Helsinki are to be paid by the East German 
Women's Congress.

Bratislava Conference, Czechoslovakia, September 1967  
�� About forty representatives of various U.S. organizations 
(including the National Mobilization Committee Against the War 
in Vietnam, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, 
Students for a Democratic Society, the American Friends Service 
Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference) 
met in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, with representatives of 
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DR V) and with South Viet-
nam National Liberation Front (NLF) officials. According to 
'. a. Czechoslovak press agency report, the conference discussed 
"the future development in the anti-war movement." The 
report added that the U.S. group was organized by David T. 
Dellinger, Tom Hayden, and Nick Egle son (the latter two being 
former SDS Chairmen). The NLF delegation was headed by 
Mme. Nguyen Thi BINH (currently head of the NLF negotiating 
team in Paris and "Foreign Minister" in the recently established 
provisional "Government." The Czechoslovak press agency 
report concluded: "The Czechoslovak Peace Committee provided 
everything required to make this meeting possible." Soon after 
his return from Czechoslovakia on 21 October 1967, Dellinger 
led the massive "peaceful demonstration" at the Pentagon.

Ninth Youth Festival, Sofia, Bulgaria. 28 July to 6 August 1968  
The American delegation consisted of 85 persons, 11 of them 
members of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The 
conference was sponsored by the World Federation of Democratic 
Youth and the International Union of Students. North Vietnamese 
and NLF representatives were present at the Festival along with 
American deserters. W. E. B. DuBois Club members, through a 
minority of the delegation, effectively controlled it. Great propa-
ganda attention was focused on the U.S. role in Vietnam. Willaim 
Cathbert, Chairman of the American Deserters Committee in Stock-
holm, announced that the Bulgarian government had financed the 
attendance of the American deserters who held several press con-
ferences and appeared jointly with the members of the NLF. After 
the conference, and in response to a Soviet request, the delegation' 
leader (also president of the DuBois Clubs) selected eight Black 
delegates to tour the USSR.

Western Hemispheric Conference Against the Vietnam War,  
Montreal, 28 November - 1 December 1968  
This conference was first proposed by the CPUSA at a 
secret meeting of Western Hemisphere Communist parties during 
the Consulative Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in 
Budapest. Hungary, 26 February - 5 March 1968. It was decided 
at this time to hold the conference during October when it would 
have the greatest impact on the 1968 U. S. elections. It was also 
suggested at this meeting that each country send 10 - 20 delegates, 
except the United States and Canada, which would be expected to 
send 500 - 1, 000 delegates. Gus Hall, chairman of the CPUSA. 
Stated that delegations should include representatives of anti-
imperialist groups such as pacifists, church groups, and youth 
and trade union groups. Throughout the summer of 1968 the 
Communist Party of Canada (CPC) and the CPUSA worked closely 
together to set up the conference. A dispute arose when the CPC . 
wanted to limit its scope to questions of Vietnam and the danger 
of U.S. imperialism to Latin America. The CPUSA, however, 
wanted to broaden its scope to include all aspects of imperialism, 
including its implications in U. S. domestic developments. These 
two positions continued to be a point of disagreement throughout the 
conference. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union contributed 
a substantial amount of funds to support this conference.

May1969  
3 � t � � .� . 
� The conference was planned and requested jointly by the. 
NLF and DRV delegations to the Paris Peace Conference. 
Assisting in the coordinating and setting up of the conference 
was the Swedish Intern.ational Liaison Committee (ILC). Among 
the leaders of the ILC are Carl H. Hermansson, chairman of 
the Swedish Communist party, and Dr. John Takman, Communist 
head of the Swedish Peace Committee. The ILC has been partially 
funded by the World Peace Council. 
Approximately 350-400 individuals attended from 52 nations. 
The primary purpose of the conference was to promote acceptance 
of the NLF/DRV Ten Point Peace Plan, proposed at the Paris 
peace talks among the world intellectual community. The NLF 
and the DRY reportedly hoped thereby to use the influence of 
these intellectuals in their respective countries to develop world 
opinion in support of their proposed solution to the war. 
� The head of the NLF delegation in Paris, Madame Nguyen 
Thi Binh, indicated privately during the conference that Hanoi was 
considering having prominent U.S. Black militants, particularly 
those opposed to the war, visit Hanoi some time in the next four or 
five months. Both the NLF and the DRV delegations showed 
considerable concern over the deteriorating anti-war movement in 
the U.S. They indicated that without public opinion in the U.S. 
calling for American troop withdrawal, their efforts to achieve 
victory would be handicapped. They urged those attending the 
conference, particularly those from the U. S. to revitalize the 
deteriorating anti-war sentiment. 
Besides representatives from the NLF and the DRY, there 
were delegations to the conference from some other Bloc countries 
(GDR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the USSR). 
The American delegation consisted of about 25 individuals 
representing at least eleven organizations. Two Americans addressed 
the conference. Professor John B. Nielands, of the University of 
California at Berkeley, spoke critically on U.S. "Chemical Warfare 
in Vietnam," and Professor Franz Schurman gave a speech on

.��: � -�..f�!. - 
This conference was sponsored by the International 
Association of Democratic Lawyers (IADL), the international 
Communist front in the legal and parliamentary field. Closely 
cooperating with IADL has been a U.S. organization called 
the "Lawyers Committee on American Policy toward Vietnam" 
(LCAPV). Among its leaders are William L. Standard and� 
Carey McWilliams, who have been cited numerous times by 
the House Committee on Un-American Activities for involve-
ment in Communist fronts. Also on the Lawyers Committee 
are well-known professors Richard Falk, Hans Morgenthau, 
and Quincy Wright. The five-man delegation representing 
the LCAPV worked closely with the DRY and NLF delegations, 
dominating the proceedings and drafting the meeting's final 
resolution. The LCAPV continues its activities, recently 
having published a "Five-Point Program to End the War in 
Vietnam" which it presented to the latest (16-18 May 1969) 
Stockholm Conference on Vietnam.

Anti.War Conferences in Satan, August 1968 ".1".. 
In August 1968 several leftist protest organizations in 
Japan sponsored conferences attended by American citizens 
representing a broad spectrum of "New Left" groups. Sponsoring 
organizations differed with the conference involved but included 
front groups of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) and the Japan 
Communist Party (SC?). American groups represented at 
the JSP conference included the Student Non.-Violent Coordinating 
Committee, Students for a Democratic Society, Women Strike 
�for Peace, the Socialist Workers Party, American Friends 
Service Committee, and the Quaker Action Group. Americans 
attending the JCP conferences included CPUSA members and 
sympathizers, representing such organizations as the Tr-

Havana Cultural Congress, 4 - 11 January 1968  
Five hundred writers, scientists, performers, artists, 
journalists, and educators from 70 countries, including about 
50 Americans, attended this conference. The final declaration 
of the congress proclaimed that armed struggle was the only 
road open to the underdeveloped countries of the world seeking 
economic development and that "North American imperialism 
is today the bloodstained representative of oppression, misery, 
economic backwardness and cultural genocide." 
The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was 
well represented. SNCC leaders contended that the conference 
would be important in the development of the Black movement in 
the United States. 
Other American delegates included David Dellinger, Tom

ON REVOLUTIONARY PROTEST MOVEMENTS 
�� � ;-� IN THE UNITED STATES 
� r , 
Litroduction 
The official radio and press media of Communist countries 
are cautious and for the most part unspecific in their treatment 
of radical protest movements in. the United States. Shunning 
direct statements of support, they convey their view of such 
movements as a rule in reportorial coverage of events deemed 
exploitable in the framework of each Communist regime's 
approach to revolutionary strategy and relations with the United 
States. 
This report will focus on the propaganda of Moscow. Peking, 
Hanoi. and Havana, the moat relevant of the media sources for 
this study on revolutionary protest movements in the United States. 
Selected examples of documentary FBIS coverage of this 
propaganda are assembled by country as an appendix to this attach-
ment.

The Soviet Union  
� : � � ;� :At 
- 
Soviet propaganda in the future will probably be guided - 
primarily by the 17 June 1969 declaration of the conference of 
Communist parties. The declaration sets forth the U. S. as 
the main enemy, and views favorably the opposition of radical 
U. S. youth and students to the Vietnam war, the draft, racism. 
and "monopoly control of universities." It expresses strong 
support for "the struggle of the Negro population of the U. S. for 
their rights." It urges Communist parties to devote considerable 
attention to work among students. The CPUSA has enthusiastically 
endorsed this line. Until the fall of 1968 'hen the Soviets tried 
to formulate a more positive approach to the youth movement, 
Soviet propaganda sought to explain all 13. S. protest and unrest 
in classical Communist terms, and avoided giving publicity to 
extremist groups. The Soviets were noticeably concerned over 
the threat of contagion from undisciplined Western youth move-
ments and over the disruptive impact of such groups on orthodox 
Corrununist parties. 
r : � � . 
� Hitherto. the Soviets have had a shifting and ambivalent 
attitude toward all student protest activities in the West, includ-
ing the United States. 
�. 
On the one hand, commentators have applauded student 
protest activity as proof of the weaknesses and contradictions of 
capitalist society and as a natural prelude to the general 
revolution which will destroy that society. Ca the other hand, they 
have decried the youths' disregard of Zoviet interests and 
direction and have warned that the young will be really effective 
only when they submit to the discipline of the workers' movement 
and the theory of Marxism-Leninism. 
Soviet discussion of foreign youth tends to lump United 
States and Western European youth together as motivated by 
similar concerns and influenced by similar ideologies. Thus, 
the philosopher Herbert Marcuse, conveniently of German birth 
and American residence, is seen as the spiritual father of the 
New Left in both the U. S. and Western Europe. 
The student role in large-scale disturbances in Europe in 
early 1968. especially in the events of May in Paris, forced the

Issue in Moscow of what pone* to adopt toward the movement � ' 
beyond the general sympathy that had always been expressed on 
the subject of the alienation of youth in the West. The response 
came in the form of an article in Pravda in May 1968 by com-
mentator Fury Zhukov. who gave a detailed critique of Marcuse's 
theories and castigated his young followers, including Cohn-Bendit, 
is "werewolves." Foreign policy considerations, especially the 
Interests of the French Communist party, seem to have largely 
determined this negative reaction. 
�� v7 4- it 
Soviet officials, however, were clearly surprised and 
troubled by the effectiveness of the student revolt and the prospect 
�� 
that it would usurp the revolutionaiy role in the West from the 
Communist parties. The Vice-President of the USSR Academy of 
� Sciences. A. M. Rumyantsev, admitted in September 1968 that 
� "the latest events in Frsnce . . . proved to be a surprise in many 
ways for the Soviet scientific workers." A professor wrote in the 
Soviet press in November 1968 that "many Communist parties admit' 
they underestimated the potentialities of the student movement." 
. � � 
-'� Since the .fall of 1968 press articles have tried to formulate 
a more positive appreach to the youth movements of the West. 
They developed many of the themes expressed by the physicist 
Petr Kapitsa to the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences in 
February 1969 and by Brezhnev in June 1969. While still condemning 
Marcuse's theories and the anarchistic elements of the students' 
activities, commentators have seen the "ideological fog in 
students' heads" as natural and understandable. More important 
In the commentators' eyes was youth's rejection of capitalist 
society. Like Kapitsa and Brezhnev, they found that ideological 
and spiritual disaffection were more important causes of student 
protest than material conditions. The commentators still main-
tained, however, that the potential of the young activists could 
only be realized when they accepted the guidance of the workers' 
movement and Marxist-Leninist teachings, thereby implying the 
current independence of the students from Soviet influence. 
A Radio Moscow broadcast beamed to Yugoslavia on 
23 June 1969 assailed Marcuse and his concept that youth, not the 
workers, are ,the motive force of revolution. In a rare Soviet 
mention. of the SDS, it noted that "some" members of this organiza-
tion have expressed dissatisfaction with Marcuse's view and favor

an alliance with the working class--"a more mighty revolutionary t 
force in capitalist society." � � - - $ ���.- . ;�.� � � 
� .� Kapitsa's departure from other writers on the subject In his 
explicit criticism of Soviet ideologists for their isolation from 
_ foreign-revolutionary movements and the suggestion that they could 
fall behind progressive thought in the West. Here Kapitsa is 
expressing the fears of liberals in the Soviet Union that the dogmatic 
stance of the present regime is isolating their country from 
progressive movements in the rest of the world. A similar spirit 
marks the essay by Kapitsa's fellow physicist Andrey Sakharov, 
which appeared in the West in July 1968. .

The difficulty for the regime is that the attempt to reconcile 
the student movement in the U.S. and Soviet ideology may lead to 
modification of the latter. An example is found in an article in 
the' February 1969 issue of the Soviet journal, World Economy and  
International Relations, which takes the most positive approach 
yet to youthful revolutionaries in the West. While it speaks of the 
necessity of their joining ranks with the workers' movement, it 
notes that the spiritual issues the students are raising are drawing 
the workers away from their narrow economic concern and are 
helping to create the "socio-psychological prerequisites" for the . 
revolutionary struggle. This attribution of an almost leading role 
to the students remains an isolated one, however, and Brezhnev's 
pronouncement stands as the official analysis. .1 .

Leonia Brezhnev's speech to the international Communist 
conference on 7 June 1969 offers an authoritative statement on 
the subject. The rising generation in the capitalist countries is 
In "revolutionary ferment," Brezhnev declared in explaining the 
"considerable attention" Communist parties are now devoting to 
work with the young people. He saw the young aroused by 
opposition-to "imperialist wars, " and "the militarization of 
bourgeois society." The negative aspects. of the activities of the 
young, according to Brezhnev, are their spontaneity and "immature 
forms" and at times their exploitation by anti-Communist elements 
and "imperialist agents." Nevertheless, he predicted that the 
young activists, once they have mastered the theory of scientific 
socialism and gained more experience, "will do great things."

The Main document approved by the conference of Communist 
parties on 17 June 1969 incorporated favorable descriptions of the 
actions of young American radical elements in its description of 
the many forces round the world engaged in what the Communists 
call the struggle against imperialism. .The presentation is designed 
first of all to serve as proof of a basic premise of the conference, 
that the United States Government is the main enemy of all anti-
imperialist forces at home as well as throughout the world, and 
the universal aggressor against which all forms of struggle should 
be employed: '- � - .1 � �I? . - � �

. "Moreover, the depth of the crisis in the capitalist 
i,.world is also strikingly revealed by the advance of the 
mass struggle in the United States itself, that main 
pillar of world imperialism. A wave of rebellions against 
racial discrimination, poverty, starvation and police brutality 
has swept the Negro ghettoes . . . . 
. "Young people, students in particular, black and white, 
resolutely use various means to oppose the Vietnam war, 
military conscription, racism, and monopoly control of 
universities. Reaction replies to this with the assassination 
of public figures, mounting repression and massive violence. 
In the third section of the document, which summarizes the 
"calls to action" approved by the participating Communist parties, 
the conference calls, as a part of the general anti-imperialist 
struggle, for solidarity and support, through protest movements 
around the world, against 
, � � . 
� � � the most ignominious phenomenon of our time, 
the barbarous persecution of the 25 million Negroes 
in the USA. . . �" 
The so-called "Peace Appeal, "unanimously approved by the 
participating parties at the June Moscow conference equates anti-
war manifestations in the United States with the armed attack on 
our forces in Vietnam, as laudable parts of the kind of "struggle 
for peace" aupported and carried out by all Communist parties:

."The struggle for peace comprises both the victorious 
battles fought by the Vietnamese patriots in the jungles of 
South Vietnam and the anti-war manifestations in Europe and 
America. The cause of peace is also served by the actions 
of the working class against . . . monopolies, by. . . Latin 
American peoples. . . , by anticolonial movernehts in,. . . 
Asia and Africa, by the struggle of the Negro population 
of the United States for their rights. . . ." 
The Soviet view of these forces in the United States was well 
expressed at the June conference by L. I. Brezhnev, speaking in 
the name of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the 
Soviet Union: �-

Revolution or people's war in any country is the business

_ of People's War," 
- 2 September 1965 
71, 
Through the broadcasts of Radio Peking in English and 
the distribution in the United States of the  Pei-sing Review and 
other English-language publications, Communist China has 
provided a measure of propaganda support and ideological 
guidance to U.S. radical movements. Peking does not, how-
ever specifically tailor this propaganda for a U.S. audience--
it is part of a monolithic effort targeted at audiences worldwide. 
The propaganda is couched in doctrinaire terms, concerned 
generally with student, youth, and black radicals. Attention 
to anti-Vietnam war activities, as to all aspects of the war, 
is slight. The ideological guidance, for those disposed to 
pay heed, is made available through the publication and rebroad-
casting in English of Mao's "works," and through the innumerable 
rehashes of his "thought." 
Peking's exploitation of American student unrest, however. 
Didicates that the Chinese view the subject as a target of oppor-
tunity through which they can discredit the U.S. image world-wide. 
Their propaganda portra.ya student activities as an example of 
the "unending troubles which have brought the U.S. to the verge 
of collapse" and "progressive forces struggling against the 
capitalist system." Lin Piao has stated that, "We firmly support 
the proletariat, the students and youth and masses of the Black 
People of the United States in their just struggle against the U.S. 
ruling clique." 
Chinese Communist proraganda seldom refers to individual 
U.S. groups, the single notable exception being the Maoist-
oriented Progressive Labor Party, several articles and statements 
of which have been publicized by NCNA this year. Apart from the

UunJen. ri 
general objective of simply blackening the U.S., the fact that 
some of these students are self-ntyled "Maoists" probably 
increases Peking's incentive to lend verbal support to such 
"progressive elements." - � . . 
�� � . 
Partic-ular attention has been paid to the militant Black 
movement. In a very widely publicized statement on 16 April 
1968. "in support of the Afro-American struggle against 
violence," Mao Tse-tung declared that the assassination of 
Dr. King, "an exponent of nonviolence," has taught U.S. 
Blacks "a profound lesson." The nature of the "lest-ion" was 
not spelled out by Mao. But lesser, routine Chinese com-
mentators expounded the view that Dr. King's death established 
the bankruptcy of his philosophy of nonviolence and showed 
the Black masses and all "American revolutionary people" 
that they must meet "counterrevolutionary :violence with 
revolutionary violence." � � � . 
. � . � r 
, :During the U.S. civil disorders in the summer of 1967. 
a series of  People's Daily articles had applauded statements 
by militant Black spokesmen and branded Dr. King a "reac-
tionary lackey" who preaches "the humbug of nonviolence." 
People's Daily predicted that the "Afro-American masses" 
together with "oppressed strata" of the white population will 
isolate and besiege the "handful of reactionaries who rule the . 
- 
country." 
� . 
The April 1968 statement by Mao. along with his previous 
formal statement on U.S. racial discrimination on 8 August 1963, 
- constitute the core of Peking's propaganda on. the "Afro-American 
struggle." The anniversaries of their issuance are observed 
through renewed publicity for the original statements, coupled 
with elucidations and updating of the textual content. The anej,. 
versary propaganda since 1965 has stressed the thesis that the 
Afro-Americans' "main form of struggle" currently is "armed 
struggle against police violence." At the same time, Peking 
has expressed its aversion to separatist trends, repeatedly 
stressing a community of interests between. Black and White 
workers in opposition to the capitalist system.

t 7(1 Vietnamese Communist media emphasize anti-war attitudes 
among the American people and frequently quote anti-war state. 
meats by members of Congress and other prominent U.S. person-
alities, but have given relatively little publicity to anti-war 
demonstrations. During 1967 and 1968, Hanoi and Liberation 
Front media publicized South and North Vietnamese "people's 
committees" for solidarity with "progressive" American groups 
and individuals and aired messages 'of greetings both to "the 
American people" and to specific U.S. groups. The only message 
of this kind during 1969, however, has been an appeal to the SDS 
from the "South Vietnam Liberation Students' Union" in March for 
support in the campaign for the nullification of sentences meted 
out to Buddhists. Normally Hanoi ignores SDS activities and student 
unrest. Both Hanoi and Liberation Front media tend to lump all 
protest elements in a single category, the "progressive people" 
of the United States, appealing to them for continued support and , 
crediting them, along with the peoples of socialist countries, with 
contributing to victories in Vietnam. 
�� 
� � In October 1967 the establishment of a "South Vietnam People's 
Committee for Solidarity with the American People" (CSAP) was 
announced. Its counterpart in the North was founded almost a 
year later. A communique on the formation of the CSAP said its 
objectives were to promote friendship and to "unite and coordinate 
with the American people in the struggle for peace, justice, freedom, 
democracy, and civil rights, and in demanding that the U. S. Govern-
ment put an end to its aggressive war in Vietnam." One of the 
committee's tasks was said to be the establishment of contact with 
all "progressive" organizations and individuals in the "American 
people's struggle." � - 
On 15 November 1967 the CSAP addressed a letter to American 
soldiers in South Vietnam which urged them to refuse to fight and 
stated that the committee would help any serviceman find his way 
home or to any other place. The letter noted that the committee 
had chapters in South Vietnamese cities. In September 1968 the 
CSAP sent a letter to the National Mobilization Committee extending 
thanks to "progressive" American people for their activities at the 
Chicago Democratic convention..

A CSAP letter to the American people on its first anniversary 
1'21968 referred to "friendly ties and close solidarity" between the 
two peoples in the common struggle for peace, justice, freedom, 
democracy, and civil rights and an end to the war in Vietnam. It 
cited conferences held to promote this goal in Bratislava, Paris, 
Stockholm, Sofia, Budapest, "and so forth." The letter extended 
greetings and gratitude to anti-war organizations of Americans 
living in France, Great Britain, and Cuba and. to various peace 
organizations around the world who were aiding American draft 
resisters and deserters.

The counterpart committee in North Vietnam (DRY) was

DRV Minister of Culture, as its president. While the statement 
on the formation of the committee accented the building of friend-
ship as its goal and made no mention of coordination in anti-war 
activities, Giam referred at the formation ceremony to "coordinating 
struggles and supporting each other."

There are also infrequent expressions of support for the 
"struggles" of the American Black people. On 17 August 1968,

Cuban media have from time to time publicized statements 
and articles by members of the Black Panthers, SDS, and such 
organizations as SNCC. although there has been a marked 
abatement of such propaganda in the past six months, because 
of preoccupation with domestic issues. While emphasizing 
the theme of anti-war sentiment among the American people 
and in Congress, Havana does not as a rule discuss the role 
of specific groups or movements in opposition to the war. 
� � Cuban radio broadcasts avoid detailed accounts of student 
activities, but emphasize that manifestations of discontent 
and rebellion by U.S. youths are symptomatic of the "sickness" 
of U.S. life and institutions. Havana publishes various propaganda 
materials aimed at influencing U.S. and other youths. t he 
emphasis is on Vietnam, Che Guevara and his idyllic quest 
for revolutionary endeavors, and is generally aimed at under-
mining U.S. foreign policy. - 
� �In the only available commentary which has broached 
the question of Cuban influence over U.S. radical movements 
in recent months, a 2 April 1969 Radio Havana talk set out 
to rebut a statement by Congressman Henry Gonzalez to the 
effect that the Mexican-American community had been infil-
trated by California youth of Mexican ancestry- 'Who'had traveled 
to Cuba on trips subsidized by the Havana regime: The com-
mentator charged that the congressman was trying to make 
Cuba the scapegoat for "problems rooted in the expansionist - 
policy of the United States during the 19th Century and in the 
present living conditions of Mexican-Americans, Latin Americans, 
and Negroes." The commentator argued that U.S. young people 
do not have to leave their country to learn violent tactics, since 
"Violence is a characteristic of North American society," but 
concluded fatuously that Cuba was "honored" by the accusation 
that it is "an example and stimulus to those fighting the injustices 
of the imperialist system of exploitation." The commentator 
added that "Cuba offers her own example and stretches her 
friendly and firm hand to those fighting for a better tomorrow." 
In past comment eulogizing Che Guevara, the ubiquitous 
influence of his "example" has been emphasized in general terms.

Last October, marking the first anniversary of Guevara's 
death, Havana. media cited his impact as a "political catalyst" 
in much of the world, specifically including the United States, 
and boasted that "never in history have the revolutionary con-
cepts of a leader of oppressed peoples spread so widely and 
so rapidly." 
� : 
Statements by spokesmen for the Black Panthers and 
SNCC carried in Havana media have lauded Che Guevara 
and his teachings. Thus Prensa Latina on 15 February 1969 
reported an interview with two Black Panther leaders which 
appeared in Tricontinental, organ of the Havana-based Afro-
Asian Latin American Peoples' Solidarity Organization 
(AALAPSO), in which they acknowledged the inspirational 
influence of the Cuban revolution and stated: "We are happy 
to see that oppressed peoples are following the brave example 
of Che Guevara to create one, two, three, many Vietnams, 
and we will work together for the destruction of imperialism." 
In October 1968, Radio Havana reported that a SNCC official 
visiting Havana had said Guevara's teachings were deeply 
rooted among Black Americans. He was also quoted as pre-
dicting that guerrilla warfare would "increasingly become the 
method of common struggle" both in the United States and in 
"liberation struggles" world-wide. 
Emphasis on SNCC, and particularly its leader Stokely 
Carmichael. shifted during the past year to the Black Panthers. 
In a Havana press conference in August 1968 a Black Panther 
leader was quoted in Cuban media as alleging that the direction 
the struggle was taking in the United States is that of resistance 
through guerrilla warfare. 
While Havana media gave extensive coverage to Carmichael's 
visit to Havana in the summer of 1967 to attend the Latin American 
Solidarity Organization conference, where he participated as 
"an honorary delegate," he has received scant mention for more 
than a year. Carmichael was interviewed by telephone by Radio 
Havana in April 1968 after the assassination of Martin Luther King 
and was quoted as forecasting that "urban guerrilla warfare" would 
develop in U. S. cities; with Dr. King's passing, he said, "there 
18 no Black man who will ask Black people not to burn down cities."

Since Havana's "Radio Free Dixie" broadcasts to the 
United States featuring U.S. Negro expatriate Robert Williams 
went off the air in March 191a 6 (7,-illia.rns migrated tc; Peking), 
Havana has not addressed inflammatory appeals for violence 
directly to U.S. Negroes. But Cuban comment has on occasion 
continued to argue that violence may be the sole method for 
the 'U.S. Negro to better his lot. Thus, after the slaying of 
Dr. King, Havana comment stressed that with the murder 
"imperialism has buried its last hope for a nonviolent solution 
to its racial problems." 
Cuban media have yet to acknowledge reports that Black 
Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver is in :Havana, nor have they 
taken cognizance of allegations that Black Panthers may have 
been involved in the diversions of U. S. airliners to Havana.
