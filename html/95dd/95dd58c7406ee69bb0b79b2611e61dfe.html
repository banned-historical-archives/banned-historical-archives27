Democratic Centralism  
"The Communist Party must be built on the basis of democratic central-
ism. The main principles of democratic centralism are the election of the 
upper body by the lower body; the absolute compulsory nature of the decisions 
of the upper body for the lower bo4y/ the latter being subordinated to the 
former; and the existence of an authoritative party center as the undisputed 
direct institution of the party life from one congress to another." 
Resolution of the Second Congress of the 
Communist International, 1920

Communist Morality  
"When people talk to us about morality we say: For the Communist, 
morality consists entirely of compact united discipline and conscious mass 
struggle against the exploiters...We say that our morality is entirely sub-
ordinated to the interests of the class struggle of the proletariat."

"The class which took political power in its hands did so knowing that

itself or others with talk of 'populsr, elected' government 'sanctified by 
the whole people'."

The Party's Founder 
and His Heirs 
The Formative Years 
During the revolutionary period, Lenin swayed crowds 
of workers and soldiers by propagating apt slogans. 
V. I. Lenin (1870-1924), founder of 
Soviet Communism, successfully led 
his minority Bolshevik Party in the 
1917 Revolution and inaugurated the 
single-party rule characteristic of 
Communist regimes. He also produced 
a body of Communist doctrine which 
provides basic criteria, in theory 
and practice, for Communist parties 
everywhere. The principles authored 
by Lenin include "iron discipline" 
as a duty for all party members and 
"democratic centralism," or control 
by a small elite group -- the cen-
tral committee -- over the party 
and its administrative organs, 
policies and programs. Lenin is 
venerated by all Communists above 
._other leaders, living or dead, 
throughout the world. 
Lenin's return to Moscow from exile in April 
1917, as pictured in the idealized painting 
at left, was a prelude to the November coup 
by Lenin's well-organized followers, but the 
popular elections after the Revolution gave 
the Bolsheviks only one fourth of the votes. 
In January 1315 Lenin forcibly dissolved the 
Constituent Assembly, ending free elections 
in Soviet Russia. Thereafter, Bolshevik rule 
was maintained by Red troops, such as those 
shown below, while other Communist elements, 
on orders from the party leaders, engaged 
in looting churches and persecuting priests. 
This was the first anti-religious campaign 
by Communists, who oppose all faiths. 
Churches were stripped of religious 
treasures in the atheistic campaign. 
Red troops patrolled streets during 
the November Revolution, 1917. 
Josef Stalin (1879-1953), adapted Lenin's 
theories in building a totalitarian state 
under his absolute control. He made use of 
the party apparatus in eliminating all his 
rivals through a series of purges carried 
out by the secret police in 1936-1938. 
Nikita Khrushchev (1894- ), emerged as 
the dominant party leader shortly after the 
death of Stalin in 1953. Drastic revamping 
of industry and agriculture has marked his 
regime, combined with an aggressive foreign 
policy centering mainly in economic fields. 
The picture of Stalin and Lenin (at right) 
was widely circulated after Stalin gained 
absolute power, in order to imply that he 
was Lenin's sole heir in party leadership, 
but Lenin's own words indicated distrust 
of the youthful Stalin. As dictator, Stalin 
used all the party's propaganda facilities 
to enhance his role in the party and state.

During the collectivization drive, 1929-1931, millions of farmers 
lost their land. Individual farmers or kulaks (shown above) were 
persecuted, deprived of all possessions and exiled to Siberia. 
Khrushchev in the 1930's was 
a valued assistant of Stalin. 
Pallbearers at the funeral of 
Stalin in March 1953 included 
(extreme right) Serie, 
(center) Malenkov, Stalin's 
son ,Gen. Vassily Stalin, 
( beh nk Malenkov) Molotov, 
Bulganin and Kaganovich. 
Berle we's later executed and 
the others have been removed 
from their high positions. 
At Yalta in 1945, Molotov 
was an adviser to Stalin. 
The Era 
of Stalin 
For more than three decades 
Stalin was the dominant 
leader of the Soviet Union 
and for most of that time, 
an absolute dictator who 
liquidated all his rivals, 
pushed collectivization at 
the cost of ten million or 
more lives, inaugurated a 
ruthless program for heavy 
industry at the expense of 
consumer goods, destroyed 
the power of trade unions, 
and turned the USSR into a 
totalitarian police state. 
His faithful lieutenants 
included such party aides 
as Molotov, Malenkov, and 
.Kaganovi ch. In the later 
stages of Stalin's career 
police chief Beria helped 
secure the dictatorship. 
? 
Heads of the Secret Police 
Following the Bolshevik power seizure in 1917, 
Lenin's regime established the secret police 
to protect the proletarian dictatorship and 
crush the party's political opponents. First 
of the variously named police organizations 
was the Cheka (1918-1922), headed by Felix 
Dzerzhinsky, who set the pattern for police 
terrorism and extra-legal activities which 
characterized Communist police organizations 
until the downfall of Beria in 1953. Up to 
that year, the secret police system comprised 
a huge complex of functions and responsibility 
involving forced labor and its output. Since 
then, the Committee of State Security (KGB) 
has exercised a decreased authority. 
Genrikh Yagoda, police head 
during the purges, was himself 
arrested and shot in 1938. 
Felix Dzerzhinsky (1877-1926) was noted for 
administrative ability and ruthless methods. 
Nikolai Yezhov followed Yagoda, 
held the title for two years, 
and then disappeared. 
en. Ivan Serov, police chief through 
1958, was associated with Baltic 
and Hungarian police terrorism. 
Ldyrenti Beria ruled a vast 
police empire under Stalin, 
but was liquidated in 1953. 
Alexander Shelepin, present head 
of the KGB, was a leading figure 
in Communist youth movements.

Khrushchev in May 1955 headed a delegation to Yugoslavia, 
marking a temporary reconciliation with President Tito. 
At the 20th CPSU congress in February 1956, Khrushchev 
delivered an electrifying speech assailing the late 
dictator Stalin for promoting the "cult of personality." 
At the 21st CPSU congress in 
February 1959, Khrushchev is 
shown applauding a speaker 
during the final session. The 
main topic' of discussion 
was the Seven-Year Plan. 
Khrushchev in Action 
After Khrushchev achieved control 
of the party central committee, he 
emphasized "unity and discipline" 
as party aims. He also overhauled 
the economic ministries, initiated 
industrial decentralization plans 
and revamped the collective farms. 
Extensive changes in education are 
in process of development. Cultural 
fields have been a frequent topic 
of his pronouncements, stressing 
adherence to the party line. The 
party chief has made many visits 
to other countries in pursuit of 
Soviet foreign policy objectives 
connected with trade expansion in 
the less-developed countries. 
Before the "anti-party" purge, 
Khrushchev (left) and Mikoyan 
(right) were close associates of 
then Premier Bulganin (center). 
Yetern,diplomat V. Molotov 
in Stalin's day was a leading 
party figure and spokesman. 
Georgi Malenkov while premier 
promised the Soviet people 
an "era of abundance." 
Lazar Kaganovich held high 
posts in the party and state 
from the time of Stalin. 
From the death of Stalin in March 1953, the CPSU central committee was the focus 
of a power struggle which moved through several stages. With Malenkov as premier, 
the principle of "collective leadership" for the time being prevailed. This soon 
crumbled, however, when the new leaders, fearing the vast power wielded by their 
associate Beria as head of the secret police, conspired against him. In July 1953 
he was arrested and in December was executed with his immediate aides. Meanwhile, 
Malenkovss remaining authority was being threatened by the steady rise of first 
secretary of the CPSU presidium, Khrushchev. By the spring of 1957 Khrushchev 
controlled most of the party apparatus and prepared to move against his rivals. 
IK,June 1957, in a sensational inner-party conflict, Khrushchevis faction won a 
majority vote of the central committee plenum and ousted the "anti-party" group 
comprising Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich, as well as former Foreign Minister 
Shepilov. Premier Bulganinis ouster came in March 1958, when he_was replaced as 
premier by Khrushchev. In 1959 no other contenders for party leadership appeared! 
Pravda to Foreign Minister in 1956. 
Nikolai Bulganin, as premier, often 
accompanied Khrushchev on tours.

Some Members of the . 
Party's Inner Circle 
At the 21st CPSU Congress, 
members of thse presidium 
of the central committee 
are shown standing back of 
Khrushchev on the rostrum. 
In 1959, First Deputy Premiers Anastas Mikoyan and Frol Kozlov, along 
with Party Secretaries Aleksey Kirichenko and Mikhail Suslov, were 
rated the most influential members of Khrushchevls inner circle. 
Kozlov and Kirichenko, both 51. and Ekaterina Furtseva, 49, were 
believed to be Khrushchevls favorites among the younger Presidium 
members. Otto Kuusinen, 77 and a party worker since 1904, was a 
senior adviser on Communist Party relations. Former Premier Bulganin, 
although Khrushchevls inseparable companion in earlier days, was in 
oblivion as a disgraced member of the 1957 "anti-party" group.

Chapter One 
THE PARTY OF LENIN AND KHRUSHCETV 
Nikita S. Khrushchev, in the course of a long speech opening the Soviet 
Communist Party's 21st congress in January, 19591gave a one-sentence expla-
nation of his organization's operating philosophy. 
"Our party," he said, "imparts the idea of the struggle for communism 
to the consciousness of the masses in the form of quite definite tasks; it 
organizes and directs the efforts of every coUssctive, of all people, toward 
the solution of these tasks." 
The Soviet Premier and Party Chief's brief statement merely confirmed 
what has been known for a long time -- that the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union (see footnote) is the most powerful single influence in the USSR and 
that its program affects the day-to-day life of every citizen. 
These .four aspects of the CPSU's role are widely recognized: 
1. The CPSU is the USSR's sole policy-determining and enforcing body. 
2. The CPSU operates and controls all Soviet governmental organizations. 
3. The CPSU performs similar functions for those countries which have 
been incorporated into the Soviet satellite system. 
4. The CPSU has assumed the role of advisory director for all inter-
national Communist activities, although this function, normally, is more 
implicit than openly declared. The implication is clear, nevertheless, that 
Communist parties in other countries are expected to model their activities, 
at least ideologically, after the Soviet pattern. From time to time, of 
course, as in crises such as the Hungarian uprising of 1956, it is necessary 
for the CPSU to take direct, instead of advisory action. 
At the 7th Party Congress, March, 1918, the All-Russian Social-Democratic 
Party (Bolsheviks) was renamed the All-Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) 
or RKP (b). The 14th Party Congress, in 1925, changed the name to All-Union 
Communist Party or VKP (b). At the 19th Party Congress, in 1952, the VKP (b) 
became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In this monograph 
the last-named designation is used throughout for reasons of simplification 
and clarity.

- 2 Chapter One 
Organizationally speaking, the CPSU's primary power is vested in its 
Central Committee, a body composed of about 270 members and candidate mem-
bers. The inner circle of this group, known as the Presidium and made up 
of a few individuals of top stature; is popularly regarded as being the 
real decision-making and policy-formulating unit. The Central Committee as 
a whole: however, has been known to overrule its Presidium. The most recent 
instance of this was in 1957, when the Committee supported Khrushchev against 
the "anti-party" group which had a temporary majority in the Presidium. 
Another part of the top-level Party structure is the Secretariat, to 
which Khrushchev has given detailed attention. This body of experienced 
officials is in the potentially powerful position of managing; on a day-to-
day basis; the CPSU's highly-involved organizational affairs. The Secre-
tariat, of course, has immense practical influence through its direct line 
connections with Subordinate secretariats at all levels of the party struc-
ture. 
Under the over-all direction of the Central Committee, various control 
aad auditing organizations help to maintain the party as a closely-supervised, 
monolothic structure traditionally opposed to rival theories, ideas or methods, 
especially within the Communist movement. 
At the heart of the CPSU's system is the Leninist dogma of "democratic 
centralism," which can be described briefly as the rule that decisions of 
top officials or bodies are binding on all lower bodies and on all party mem-
bers. 
To carry out its decisions, the CPSU has devised a hard core of well-
trained, dedicated individual functionaries known as cadres. 
Khrushchev, it has been noted, stressed the importance of this cadre 
corps at both the 20th and 21st party congre.ses. He told the 20th congress 
in 1956 that a primary goal is to "improve the selection, education and 
distribution of cadres." In 1959, the 21st congress was told of new plans 
to "revitalize" and expand the party's cadres. 
Cadres undergo intensive training and operate under what is essentially 
a military discipline. Both at home and abroad, the cadre is the key unit 
in the party's day-to-day activities. Cadres not only guide the work of 
party and non-party organizations, including those of writers, artists, en-
tertainers, scientists, etc. -- they also are charged with maintaining a 
close guard against indifference or deviationism which might crop up in any 
of these groups. 
The party also places high priority on its tools of propaganda and 
agitation. Khruchshev, for example, has stressed the necessity to "make 
fuller and more efficient use of all means of ideological influence...such 
as propaganda, agitation, the press: radio, cultural-educational organiza-
tions and institutions, science, literature and the arts." In the Soviet

"agitprop" field alone, there are almost 400,000 full-time agitators, or-
ganizers, lecturers and other activists, their work supported by some 6,000 
party training schools. 
It is obvious that this highly developed political machine is vastly 
more complex than the minority group of radical revolutionaries which 
comprised the Bolshevik party of 1917. Remarkable parallels exist, never-
theless, between the party's modus operandi today and the marking style of 
Lenin's original Bolsheviks. 
One of the most obvious parallels is found in the seemingly changeless 
concept that opposition views can not be permitted because they would tend 
to detract from the party's efficiency and effectiveness. Within days of 
the Bolshevik coup of November 7, 1917, Lenin had implemented this philosophy 
by rejecting various proposals that representatives of other political parties 
be allowed some measure of participation in the new Bolshevik government. 
Forty years later, Lenin's original theory of monolithic rule was still 
apparent in the disciplinary measures taken against the "anti-party" group 
of Malenkov, Molotov, Kaganovich? Shepilov and Bulganin. 
There is another parallel in Lenin's 1917 suspension of non-Bolshevik 
publications and today's practice of maintaining the Soviet press and radio 
as direct extensions of the CPSU. As an illustration of continuity in party 
outlook, Lenin's 1917 promise to restore freedom of the press "as soon as 
the new order is consolidated" needs only to be placed alongside Premier 
Khrushchev's 1957 statement that "me cannot let the press organs fall into 
unreliable hands. They must be in the hands of the workers that are the 
most loyal, most reliable, most staunch politically; and most devoted to 
our cause. 
Lenin's plan to "consolidate the new order," in other words, is still 
in process. 
The CPSU's practice of periodically rewriting its own history is another 
outgrowth of the basic Communist view that only one policy line can be 
allowed to exist at any given time. This concept is particularly useful in 
handling sudden policy switches, as in 1956 when Khrushchev's secret speech 
at the 20th party congress signalled the beginning of de-Stalinization and 
a concentrated effort to create a new historical evaluation of the whole 
Stalinist era. 
The same approach can also be applied in adjusting the official reputa-
tions of men like Molotov and Malenkov, or other former party "heroes" who 
fall from power or become, in the party's viewpoint; suspected of revisionism 
or other "anti-party" tendencies. From the standpoint of established party 
doctrine, there is nothing illogical about the exposure and denunciation of 
key members of the Central Committee itself when current strategy so dictates. 
Because of the CPSU's tendency to refute its own former leadership, it 
is not surprising to find that only one man; V. I. Lenin, is now considered 
to have been "all-wise" as both activist and theorist. Although Karl Marx

4 Chapter One 
is still honored as a sort of theoretical godfather to modern communism, 
it is Lenin alone who has become the party's real symbol. Thus, while 
Marxism-Leninism is still used as the Party's doctrinal label, it is the 
"Leninist central Committee" which assumes responsibility and credit for 
all Soviet undertakings. 
In this general connection, the party's seemingly paradoxical emphasis 
on "peaceful coexistence" is explained by a concept called "communist moral-
ity." The phrase simply identifies the CPSU theory that any action is 
justified if it advances the cause of Communism. According to the doctrine 
of "Communist morality," therefore, it becomes quite logical for the party 
to advocate "peaceful coexistence" as an international policy while simul-
taneously engaged in campaigns to undermine the legitimate governments of 
non-Communist nations. 
The Large Soviet Encyclopedia, in an official definition, says "Com-
munist morality" is merely "the defense of the interests of the victory of 
communism." 
Communist morality as practiced by the CPSU, however, has proved un-
acceptable to a number of party members and sympathizers outside the Soviet 
Union. Soviet intervention to end the Hungarian national uprising of 1956, 
for example, had serious repercussions throughout the international Communist 
movement, prompting a wholesale series of defections. One of those who broke 
with communism because of Hungary was S. W. Scott, who had been New Zealand's 
leading Communist for almost 30 years. Scott commented later that he had 
found that many Communists had an "attitude to ethics which is intensely 
dangerous." The concept that the "end justifies the means," he added, "is 
all-pervasive in the Communist movement." 
As one solution to its vexing problem of trying to maintain ideological 
solidarity throughout the Communist movement, the CPSU has turned more and 
more to a kind of Lenin-worship. The party's founder, throne) the years, has 
been made into the image of a legendary hero who is above criticism. Lenin's 
voluminous writings, moreover, provide party leaders with an invaluable 
reservoir of quotations which can be cited, or paraphrased as is frequently 
the practice, to support almost any of the CPSU's current policies. 
The party has adopted a similar approach in its references to the 
Bolshevik revolution of 1917. This event, which brought Lenin to power, 
is now depicted as having been the direct result of a mass workers' up-
rising against Czarism. Missing from current CPSU annals are certain 
historical facts, principally that Lenin's coup of November 7, 1917, was 
essentinlly a counter-revolution. The Czar's actual overthrow, it will 
be remembered, was accomplished some eight months earlier through a spon-
taneous, popular uprising known as the "February" revolution. Lenin was 
still in exile at this time and his Bolshevik supporters were an unorganized 
minority. What the Bolsheviks really accomplished by means of their No-
vember 7, 1917 take-over was to stop an eight-month-old experiment in 
representative government and make possible the gradual substitution of 
a system of one-party control.

THE PARTY OF LENIN AND.KHRUSECHEV 
-5 
Party literature of the present, in fact, tends to gloss over the more 
realistic aspects of early Communist history in favor of a highly idealized 
version of the revolution as a mass triumph of the working class. Leninism, 
therefore: has become less a term suggesting revolutionary violence and 
intrigue and more a generalized ideological label which can be used to cloak 
the party's every decision with doctrinal respectability. 
It is true, however, that while many of Lenin's original ideas have been 
found impractical, a large part of his realistic operating philosophy has 
survived. There is a familiar ring, for example, in this March 27, 1921, 
statement by the party's founder: 
"The class which took political power in its hands did so knowing that 
it took this power alone. This is contained in the concept 'dictatorship of 
the proletariat.' This concept has meaning only when a single class knows 
that it alone is taking political Power in its hands and does not deceive 
itself or others with talk about 'popular, elected government sanctified by 
the whole people.'" 
As early as 1922, Lenin had formulated basic working policies which 
differ little from those followed by the CPSU today. Lenin's principles 
included: maintenance at ,all costs of the one-party system; suppression by 
the party's dominant faction of all internal opposition; the use of force, 
as necessary, to maintain discipline. Interestingly enough, it was Stalin 
who popularized Lenin's term "iron discipline," still regularly employed in 
party exhortations, Radio Moscow broadcasts and Pravda editorials. 
Throuji a selective use of Lenin's methods, the CPSU has attained an 
unprecedented degree of power in the USSR. It operates the Soviet government 
and sets the line of development for the USSR's military forces, agriculture, 
industry, education, youth activities, literature and the arts. 
While the Party is literally everywhere, its comparatively small member-
ship (roughly four Percent of the Soviet Union's population) and the infini-
tesimal numbers actually engaged in mnking policy tend to give it an air of 
secrecy and mystery. Thus, it has become a common practice for Soviet workers 
at all levels to refer to the party leadership merely as "they." Not every-
body knows just who may be meant by "they," but nobody doubts what is meant --
whichever faction may be in control of the party at the moment.

Chapter TWO 
"DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM," THE KEY TO PARTY POWER 
The concept of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" comes from the 
Communist Manifesto issued by Marx and Engels in 1848, but its antithesis --
"democratic centralism" -- dates from _Lenin. Both expressions are currently 
used in Communist parlance, but only the last-named has meaning in terns of 
party power. 
At the 6th Congress of the Bolshevik Party, July-August 1917, some 
months before the Bolshevik Revolution, new precepts were adopted which 
provided that all party organizations should be built on the principles 
of democratic centralism., defined in the following rules as: 
(1) all directing bodies, from top to bottom: should be elected; 
(2) party bodies should give periodical accounts of their activities 
to respective party organizations; 
(3) there should be strict party discipline and subordination of the 
minority to the majority; and 
(4) all decisions of higher bodies should be absolutely binding on 
lower bodies and on all party members. 
Although the 6th Congress ostensibly provided for democratic bodies 
through elections, genuine free elections were never contemplated by Lenin, 
who scorned "popillar, elected governments sanctified by the whole people." 
He distrusted all electoral procedures except as they contributed to the 
ascendancy of his party and to the centralist rule of its inner hierarchy. 
After the forcible dissolution of the All-Russian Constituent Assembly 
in January 1918, the Bolshevik (Communist) regime carried no mandate from 
the people based on free elections. The establishing of the Supreme Soviet 
under the 1936 Constitution proved to be meaningless; it had then, and has 
now, no genuine legislative authority. 
Of the "higher bodies" referred to in Rule 4 promulgated by the 6th 
Bolshevik Congress, the Central Committee of the CPSU is the paramount 
controlling organ of the party. The post of party secretary was used by 
Stalin as a stepping-stone in his rise to dictatorial power. The title 
is now held by Nikita Khrushchev, and there is every indication that he 
is in complete control of the party machinery. 
The 11th Congress of the CPSU, March 1922, set the autocratic pattern 
of the central committee. Immediately following the Congress, Stalin on 
April 4, 19220 was named secretary-general of the party. 
"DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM," THE KEY TO PARTY POWER - 7 - 
Lenin had found Stalin a useful subordinate in helping to carry out 
his awn policies suppressing opposition; nevertheless, he began to have 
misgivings in regard to Stalin's character and ambitions. 
In May 1922 -- a month after Stalin's appointment -- Lenin, Stplin, 
and Nikolai Bukharin, a prominent "Old Bolshevik," appeared at a trade 
union congress: where they forced the union representatives to accept CPSU 
control of the trade union movement. But in the following December, Lenin 
was highly critical of the part played by Stalin in a controversy involving 
a national Communist movement in the Georgian Soviet Republic. 
In a note of December 31: 1922: Lenin wrote that a "fatal role was 
played here by Stalin's haste and preoccupation with the administrative 
aspect (of the Georgian situation) and also by his rage against the noto-
rious 'socialist nationalism.' Rage in general usually plays the worst 
role in politics." 
Lenin Ilimself favored a policy of conciliation -- "It is better to 
be excessively tractable and lenient towards the national minorities than 
not to be sufficiently so." 
Stalin, however, in his "preoccupation" with the creation of a highly 
centralized totalitarian state, detested nationalism in any form, especially 
as manifested in the non-Russian Soviet republics. His "rage" against 
alleged expressions of nationalism reached a climax during World War II: 
when in 1944 he announced the liquidation of six autonomous regions and 
republics on the grounds that they had been "traitors" to the Soviet Gov-
ernment. 
Despite liberal provisions -- on paper -- in the Soviet Constitution, 
for the autonomy of the constituent republics of the USSR, they are little 
more than feeble replicas of the central government and subject, in the 
last analysis, to the will of the CPSU. 
The Central Asian national entities, nevertheless, serve a useful 
propaganda purpose of Moscow. For example, at the Cairo "Afro-Asian Soli-
darity Conference," December 25, 1957 - January 1, 1958, the 15-man Soviet 
delegation was composed largely of representatives of Central Asian'so-
called republics -- a circumstance that enabled the USSR to appear in the 
guise of an Asian country. 
The concern of Lenin and Stalin over "socialist nationalism," or 
independent communism, continues to be reflected in current MOSCOW policy. 
Today it is called revisionism. Tito's insistence on following his own 
independent road to communism led to Moscow's break with the Yugoslav 
Communist Party in 1948, and after the long-drawn feud with Tito was 
patched up: it was renewed with greater bitterness in 1958.

- 8 - Chapter Two 
Following the decision of the Polish regime in 1956 to seek its own 
"road to socialise (communism), further Soviet concessions were made, in 
terms of methods and timing: not in ultimate goals. Aside from Poland: 
the CPSU has shown no disposition to ease its hold on the Communist parties 
of the other satellite states. 
Soviet control of the satellites, as well as the Baltic states and 
other annexed areas, basicRily is a military-political problem and reflects 
the CPSIT's concern with the military aspects of communism, which characterized 
the party from the very beginning. 
It is noteworthy that although Marx and Engels pictured the proletarian 
revolution in terms of workers' mass movements, Lenin and his successors used 
military terms in referring to the structure and functions of the Bolshevik 
or Communist Party. 
In 1904, when Lenin was faced. by a split in Social Democratic ranks, he 
wrote from Geneva: "To the extent that a real (workers') partris formed: 
the class-conscious worker must learn to distinguish the mentality of the 
soldier of the proletarian army from the mentality of the bourgeois intel-
lectual who flaunts his anarchist talk." 
Stalin was even more specific. In March 1937 -- during the Moscow 
purge trials -- he told the Central Committee of the CPSU: 
"In our Party: if we have in mind its leading strata, there are about 
3,000 to 4/000 first-rank leaders whom I would call our Party corps of 
generals. Then there are 30,000 to 40:000 middle-rank leaders who are our 
Party corps of officers. Then there are about 100:000 to 150:000 of the 
lower-rank Party command staff who are: so to speak, our Party's non-
commissioned officers." 
Stalin neglected to remind the central committee that this "party army" 
had already suffered great losses through a succession of purges: and that 
more were to come. During the period 1936-1938y about 25 percent of the 
high-ranking officers of the Soviet Army were executed: and 75 percent of 
the Supreme War Council. 
First Party Secretary Nikita Khrushchev told the 20th Congress of the 
CPSU in his secret speech of February 25: 1956: "It was determined (by 
the presidium of the central committee) that of the 139 members and candi-
dates of the Party's Central Committee who were elected at the 17th Congress, 
98 persons: i.e., 70 percent, were arrested and shot, mostly in 1937-1938... 
The same fate met not only the Central Committee members but the majority 
(56 percent) of the delegates to the 17th Party Congress." 
The Stalin purges affected not only the party and the army; in the end: 
tens of thousands of persons with no party or military connections were 
victims of the countrywide blood bath. Khrushchev, however: showed no 
emotion over the fate of the non-party victims. 
"DEMOCRATIC CENTRALIal," THE KEY TO PARTY POWER - 9 
The purges carried out by Stalin: to pave the way for his absolute 
dictatorship: were a by-product of the principle of democratic centralism: 
coupled. with the concept of party discipline. 
In a speech to the Second Congress of the Comintern (the subversive 
organization of international communism, also known as the Second Inter-
national): Lenin declared: 
"In the present epoch of acute civil war, the Communist Party will be 
able to perform its duty only if it is organized in the most centralized 
manner, only if iron discipline bordering on military discipline prevails 
in it: and if its Party center (Central Committee) is a powerful organ of 
authority, enjoying wide powers and the general confidence of the members 
of the Party." 
Shortly after the death of Lenin in 1924: CPSU Secretary-General Stalin 
proclaimed: "Iron discipline in the Party is inconceivable without unity of 
will, without complete and absolute unity of action on the part of all mem-
bers of the Party...It follows that the existence of factions is incompatible 
either with the Party's unity or iron discipline." 
Stalin used the party rules of iron discipline and absolute unity to 
eliminate his first important rival, Leon Trotsky. Trotsky was expelled 
from the party in 1927 and sought refuge in Mexico, where he was assassi-
nated by a Stalinist agent on August 21: 1940. 
In the mass blood-letting of the Moscow trials of the 1930's most of 
Stalin's former associates -- the "Old Bolsheviks" -- fell before firing 
squads; so: also, the organizer of the Red Army, Marshal Tukhachevsky and 
seven top generals. 
In June 1953: Minister of Interior Lavrenti Beria and his close 
associates were arrested by the post-Stalin leaders who, in turn, under-
went a milder purge at the hands of Party Secretary Khrushchev and his 
faction four years later. (Beria was executed in December.) 
Khrushchev in his report to the Supreme Soviet: May 7, 1957, on his 
new decentralization program for industry, at the same time reaffirmed 
the principle of democratic centralism for the party. 
"Yes:" said Khrushchev, "we have not repudiated: nor do we intend to 
repudiate Lenin's principle in the management of the national economy --
the principle of democratic centralism." 
No months later: the same principle was invoked in the ouster of the 
"anti-party" group -- Malenkov, Molotov: and Kaganovich. At the end of 
October: Zhukov was removed from his Defense Ministry post and consigned 
to obscurity, charged with "frustrating party control of the armed forces."

- 10 - Chapter Two 
In the course of decades of party purges in the USSR, all of the nota-
ble victims considered themselves devout followers of Marxism-Leninism, all 
believed in and followed the principles of democratic centralism, party 
unity, and iron discipline. But they helped to create and perpetuate a ma-
chine they could neither control nor escape. 
Recently, the party organ Kammunist denounced the movement to do away 
with democratic centralism within the party. The journal also censured 
national Communists who would like each country to find its own road to 
communism. 
Of greater interest than these rebukes to revisionist attitudes is the 
fact that such doctrinal heresies do exist as a challenge to orthodox Marxism-
Leninism.

Chapter Three 
SOVIET GOVERNMENT AS A PARTY FACADE 
The 1936 Constitution of the USSR endowed the Supreme Soviet with some 
25 categories of legislative powers. However, these broad powers were not 
at any time exercised and exist only as nominal functions. The real focus 
of power in the USSR does not lie in the Supreme Soviet or its presidium, 
but in the CPSU central committee and its presidium. 
The proceedings of every session of the Supreme Soviet are directed to 
predetermined ends by key central committee members elected to it, but de-
spite its lack of actual authority, the Supreme Soviet is pictured in Soviet 
domestic propaganda as the elective will of the people. Abroad, in propa-
ganda terms addressed to sympathetic opinion, the Supreme Soviet passes as 
a "workers' parliament." 
The Supreme Soviet is divided into two separate bodies -- the Council 
of Nationalities and the Council of the Union. The Council of Nationalities 
is made up of 25 members from each of the Union Republics, 11 from each 
Autonomous Region, and one from each National Area. The Council of the 
Union is composed of deputies elected on the basis of one for each election 
district of approximately 300,000 population. 
Direct popular elections were still being held in the 1920's, but they 
were restricted to rural and urban soviets (local assemblies). The 1936 
Constitution extended the suffrage privilege to the highest bodies, central 
and regional, but in practice the constitutional provisions are nullified 
by the method of selecting candidates. 
Article 141 of the Constitution states: "The right to nominate candi-
dates is secured to public organizations and societies of the working people: 
Communist Party organizations, trade unions, cooperatives, youth organi-
zations and cultural societies." 
However, all these organizations are wholly dominated by the CPSU which, 
at local levels, determines the eligibility of candidates through election 
commissions of its own selection. 
Electoral campaigns are usimlly preceded by a month or two of intensive 
propaganda, by press and radio, designed to stress the importance of the 
coming elections, but the only issues are those connected with party slogans, 
production plans, and the like. At such times the Soviet press is filled 
with exhortations such as (Pravda): "construction of the Communist society:" 
"greater solidarity of the peoples of the USSR in their struggle for the 
successful fulfillment of great constructive tasks set by the Party and 
Government," and so forth.

- 12 Chapter Three 
Candidates are chosen at pre-election conferences of public organizations 
under strict party guidance. All nominees are unanimously approved, and no 
attempt is made to weigh the quOifications of one nominee against those of 
another. The final list names only one candidate for each election district. 
In the March 1958 elections, there were 1,378 candidates and precisely that 
number of candidates were elected to the Supreme Soviet. 
Another peculiarity of the Soviet electoral system is the practice of 
conferring honorary nominations on CPSU leaders by an unlimited number of 
constituencies. Thus Pravda on February 6: 1950, in reporting a local elec-
toral conference said: 
"The meeting unanimously decided to nominate, as candidates to the Soviet 
of the Union, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin: Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov, 
Georgi Naxlmilianovich Malenkov, and Ivan Nikolayevich Krapivin." 
Krapivin, a shop foreman and the real nominee, was designated as the 
candidate after the conference had received form letters from the three no-
tables thanking them for the honor and declining the nominations. The 
prestige value of districts which party leaders actually represent reflects 
their standing in the party hierarchy. 
For example, in the pre-election campaign of 1958, when Premier Bulganin 
was assigned a candidacy in a remote and obscure district, his down-grading 
in the party was obvious and his replacement as Premier came as no surprise. 
Many candidates elected to the Supreme Soviet are not party members, but 
its controlling body: the Presidium, is made up exclusively of CPSU members. 
(The 31-member Supreme Soviet Presidium, of which Klementi E. Voroshilov is 
Chairman, should not be confused with the presidium of the CPSU central com-
mittee. The central committee has 125 full members and 119 candidate members. 
Its presidium consists of 15 full and 10 candidate members. About half of 
the members of the CPSU central committee presidium are also on the Supreme 
Soviet Presidium; the rest are deputies heading important commissions.) 
Under the Constitution, the Supreme Soviet is vested with plenary 
powers in every field of legislation: but in practice its plenum merely 
confirms or ratifies decisions taken by the Presidium, and this body in 
turn is a facade for the CPSU central committee, the de facto governing 
authority of the USSR. 
Since the outcome of all election campaigns is a foregone conclusion --
government candidates win by more than 99 percent (in the last election, by 
99.97 percent) -- the question may be raised as to why the Soviet Government, 
and all other Communist regimes, are at such pains to hold elections. 
There are two main reasons for this exercise in mass obedience. 
First, there is the announced purpose of emphasizing the "unity" between 
the people and the Communist leadership. Secondly, under balloting con-
ditions prevailing under communism, a voter, in ordek to register

opposition to a candidate, must enter a special roam or booth for this pur-
pose. In such an instance, his name can be taken down by officials present. 
Thus: by and large, the voting process -- which is practically manda-
tory -- is also a test of loyalty to the regime. 
From the days of Lenin, the real struggle for power has always taken 
place within the political zone that cannot be touched by any pretense of 
popular mandate or responsibility -- the CPSU: the government bureaucracy: 
and such appendages as the armed services and the secret police. Since the 
death of Stalin in 1953, this struggle has narrowed down to the CPSU central 
committee. 
In 1923: while Lenin was incapacitated, the 12th Party Congress adopted 
a resolution offered by Gregory Zinoviev, supported by Leo Kamenev and Stalin, 
which proclaimpd: 
"The dictatorship of the working class can be guaranteed only in the 
form of a dictatorship of its vanguard, i.e.: the Party." 
This was the first public assertion of the primacy of the CPSU's 
political-organizational apparatus -- the party machine -- over the party 
itself and the state. Following the death of Lenin in 1924, Stalin pre-
pared to crush all his potential rivals for power, but he moved slowly aad 
carefully until the "Great Purge" of 1936-1938. 
Stalin liquidated the Zinoviev-Kamenev faction in 1936, and then turned 
on the group that included such "Old Bolsheviks" as Alexei Rykov, Nikolai 
Bukharin, and Mikhail Tomsky (the Communist trade union leader who committed 
suicide). Bukharin, Rykov, and NKVD chief Yagoda were executed in March 
1938. 
During the series of Moscow purge trials, more than 70 percent of the 
members and candidate members of the CPSU central committee and 60 percent 
of the delegates at the 17th Party Congress (1934) were liquidated. The 
Soviet Army's officer corps and high command were decimated, and millions 
of minor victims in no way connected with the leaders were executed or sent 
to forced labor camps. 
Controlling all the levers of power, Dictator 8talin faced the 18th 
Party Congress in March 1939 with a new, hand-picked central committee. 
However, to insure that the principle of democratic centralism would be 
observed, he gave the secret police commissar of Interior Lavrenti Beria 
the official right to investigate and, if need be, arrest and prosecute 
members of the CPSU central committee itself. This was an "unconstitutional" 
invasion of the "rights" of party members,, but not essentially different from 
Stalin's previous acts.

- 14 Chapter Three 
During World War II: the subordinate role of the party machine remained 
practically unchanged: but after the war: Politburo member Andrei Zhdanov 
tried to rebuild the party apparatus as an even stronger political force. 
Zhdanov died on August 31, 1948, and subsequently: all of his close 
associates in the central committee and in his own Leningrad organization 
were liquidated. This is known as the "Leningrad Case," referred to by 
Khrushchev in his attack on the "cult of personality" in 1956. 
Immediately after Stalin's death, a realignment of intra-party elements 
took place. At the first central committee plenum on March 14: 1953, Malenkov, 
who then held the posts of Premier and ranking secretary of the party presid-
ium, yielded the latter title to a less conspicuous party figure, Nikita 
Khrushchev. In September, Khrushchev became first secretary of the central 
committee -- from which vantage point he began his tortuous ascent to domi-
nation of the party. 
The first target of Khrushchev -- supported by his colleagues in 
"collective leadership" -- was Minister of Interior Berle, whose vast powers, 
embodied in the MVD: posed a grave threat to both the government bureaucracy 
and the party machine. The liquidation of Berle, who was arrested on July 10, 
1953 (charged with treason) and executed with other accomplices on December 23, 
shattered the hold of the secret police. 
From the time that Khrushchev became first secretary of the central 
committee until the deposition of Malenkov as Premier on February 8, 19551 
there was a steady decline in the strength of the bureaucracy vis-a-vis the 
party apparatus: although this was not fully apparent for another two years. 
During this period: Khrushchev was actively engaged in reshuffling the 
party organization. He secured the dismissal of large numbers of party 
secretaries in the union republics and replaced them with his own appointees. 
At the same time, the farm bureaus of the regional soviets were abolished and 
the vital area of agricultural control passed to the jurisdiction of special 
party secretaries who were Khrushchev supporters. 
When the 20th Party Congress met in February 1956, the party apparatus 
already was largely in the hands of Khrushchev and his central committee 
faction: the presidium secretariat. 
At the 20th Congress, Deputy Premier Anasta Mikoyan declared: 
"Our Party now at its disposal a strongly welded leading collective 
(leadership)...But the most important thing is that this collective, guided 
by Lenin's idea, Lenin's principles of the Party's structure and the Party's 
leadership, has within a short space of time achieved the restoration of 
Lenin's norms of Party life from top to bottom." This statement was window-
dressing to Khrushchev's bid for power in the party.

SOVIET GOVERNMENT AS A PARTY FACADE - 15 - 
Until mid-1955, central government officials who were members of the 
Council of Ministers, as well as members of the CPSU central committee 
presidium, played a stronger role than members of the central committee 
secretariat headed by Khrushchev. 
Khrushchev was an exception to the dual functions of the upper party 
hierarchy. In his own words: "concentrating on work in the central commit-
tee" gave him no time to perform other administrative duties. However, his 
preoccupation with the central committee did give him an opportunity to 
undermine the administrative bureaucracy which, by 1957, had grown to huge 
OimAnsions. Thus, when he moved against the bureaucrats, he did so in the 
name of efficiency. 
On March 29, 1957/ the CPSU central committee issued Khrushchev's 
report on the "Further Organizational Improvement of Management of Industry 
and Construction" -- the now-famous "decentralization" plan, which was 
adopted at a special session of the Supreme Soviet on May 10. 
Khrushchev's program called for abolishing more than half of the 52 
All-Union central ministries and for setting up approximately a hundred 
"councils of national economy" based: he said, on the "Leniniat principle of 
democratic centralism in the field of economic construction." However, 
decentralization was only part of Khrushchev's scheme; it also struck a 
powerful blow at ministerial prestige and prerogatives. 
In June came the dramatic downfall of the "anti-party" group -- Molotov, 
Malenkov, and Kaganovich, all of wham were central government officials. 
Linked to the fate of these conspirators was Shepilov, who was deprived of 
his post of candidate member of the presidium. 
Having disposed of his opponents in the bureaucracy -- reportedly-with 
the aid and concurrence of Marshal G. K. Zhukov Khrushchev prepared to 
eliminate the Marshal himself, who symbolized another lever of power in the 
Communist system -- the Soviet Army. 
On October 26: the day when Zhukov returned from a visit to Yugoslavia 
and Albania, Moscow announced that he had been replaced as Minister of 
Defense. A week later, his expulsion from the CPSU presidium was announced 
together with charges leveled against him by the central committee. 
Of the four major offenses of which Zhukov was found guilty by the 
central committee, the first was the most significant -- that he had 
"frustrated party control of the armed forces." 
With Zhukov '5 downfall: the power of the remaining presidium members 
,4as only a shadow of what it had been, following Stalin's death. Six of the 
10 veteran presidium members -- the "heirs of Stalin" -- had been deposed: 
and the party machine headed by Khrushchev had in turn imposed its will on 
the ministerial bureaucracy, the army, and the presidium itself.

Chapter Three 
The party machine: built on the secretariat of the CPSU central committee 
presidium, includes a score of executive departments and a highly disciplined 
hierarchy of subordinate secretaries and executive staffs, which operate from 
republic (provincial) levels down to the oblasts (regional) and lesser admin-
istrative and political units of the USSR. 
Directly under the secretariat is the "party apparatus," or executive 
staff, ythose channels of power and authority extend to every aspect of Soviet 
life and reach out even beyond the Soviet orbit. One of the most important 
of the central committee's subordinate organs is the Department for Agitation 
and Propaganda (Agitprop). 
Agitprop has performed a vital service to Khrushchev in his rise to 
power: as it did for Stalin. Controlling all information and propaganda 
media, Agitprop outlets have furnished Khrushchev with a sounding board and 
concurrently have bestowed on him an aura of preeminence appropriate to his 
party standing. 
The assumption of the premiership by Khrushchev -- conducted in the 
name of the central committee and ratified by the Supreme Soviet -- gave 
official sanction to the maneuvers whereby he has won a position in the 
CPSU and Soviet Government resembling in some respects that of Stalin, but 
differing in others. The rise of Khrushchev to the position of authority 
he now enjoys to a large extent is the fruit of his political maneuvering 
within the CPSU, starting with his secretaryship of the Ukrainian party 
organization, 1938-1949. 
The core of Khrushchev's "machine" within the 14-member central com-
mittee presidium is made up chiefly of Ukrainian party notables: eight of 
whom served under him in the earlier period. Thus, the Soviet Government 
in effect is a facade for a tightly knit political machine within the CPSU 
central committee.

Chapter Four 
Thi b; SOVIET POLICE SYSTEM 
The principal architect of present-day communism -- V. I. Lenin -- in 
a speech at the 7th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
(CPSU), March 8, 1918, made the statement: 
"Soviet power is a new type of state, in which there is no bureaucracy, 
no police: no standing army: and in which bourgeois democracy is replaced by 
a new democracy -- a democracy which brings to the forefront the vanguard of 
the toiling masses: turning them into legislators, executives, and a military 
guard, and which creates an apparatus capable of re-educating the masses." 
Whether or not Lenin believed this, he had already been instrumental 
in framing a political and administrative system that would negate every 
item of his assertion. Chief of the weapons used by Lenin's Bolsheviks to 
forge absolute power was the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, known 
as the Cheka -- first of the secret police organizations set up in the USSR. 
The Cheka was established by a decree of the Council of People's Com-
missars of the RSFSR (Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic) on Decem-
ber 20, 1917. Directed to combat "counterrevolution, sabotage and specula-
tion," the RSFSR Cheka was empowered to supervise local Chekas and officially 
was subordinate to the Council of People's Commissars, the supreme govern-
mental body. 
During its existence: 1918-1922, the Cheka, like its successors, had a 
high degree of independent authority in the interpretation of Soviet laws 
and party regulations as well as in administrative matters. Since it was 
given broad powers to suppress "counter-revolutionaries," its victims in-
cluded thousands of political opponents of the Communists. 
A 1924 report by the Soviet Supreme Court showed that almost half of 
those executed by Chekists were peasants; about 25 percent were workers; 
intellectuals and office workers made up 20 percent of the death list and 
"others," 8.5 percent. 
The terroristic activities of the Cheka were explained. by Lenin as 
necessary to safeguard the dictatorship of the proletariat. In November 
1918 he said: 
"The Cheka directly realizes the dictatorship of the proletariat and 
in this respect its role is inestimable. There is no other way to the 
liberation of the masses save by suppressing the exploiters." However, 
the great majority of Cheka victims were not exploiters in any sense; they 
were simply non-Bolsheviks. Chekas sprang up throughout the Soviet Union 
and were used by local or regional Communist parties to terrorize the 
people into accepting Communist rule.

- 18 - Chapter Four 
When the Civil War ended: the Soviet Government was eager to achieve 
domestic stability and placate world opinion. Under a decree of February 6, 
1922: the Cheka was abolished and its place was taken by the State Political 
Administration, or GPU. 
The GPU lost certain Cheka functions when some categories of crime were 
transferred to the "People's Courts" for adjudication. Whatever the official 
or de facto powers of the Cheka and GPU: their basic characteristic -- un-
bridlea?ffiqvolutionary" terrorism -- was fixed by the ruthless methods of 
their first chief: Felix Dzerzhinsky, who established a pattern followed by 
succeeding heads of the secret police. 
When the first Soviet Constitution was adopted in January 1924: the 
GPU ceased to exist, but its personnel was absorbed by the new United State 
Political Aaministration, or OGPU: which was an All-Union organ. 
With the establishment of the OGPU: again headed by Dzerzhinsky, there 
was created a vast network of police controls and secret tribunals which 
dispensed justice: according to OGPU standards. Gradnelly, every citizen 
from factory worker and peasant to party bureaucrat -- was subject to the 
probing and possible arrest and trial by various OGPU organs and agents. 
This accretion of powers is shown by the record: the system of forced 
labor camps, initiated in 1918, was centralized under the OGPU in 1924; 
frontier areas became a responsibility of the OGPU guards in 1927/ the in-
ternal passport system was introduced in 1932 as part of OGPU's operations 
and in the same year the regular police force or Militia was placed under 
the OGPU. 
=Ilan 
The OGPU's most drastic mission was to carry out Stalin's decree ordering 
the collectivization of all Soviet farms. The mass persecutions by OGPU agents 
and deportations of peasants, 1929-1933: numbered millions of victims. 
Stalin later told British Prime Minister Winston Churchill that forced 
industrialization and collectivization cost the USSR 10 million lives; in 
addition, other millions filled the OGPU-run forced labor camps. 
In July 1934: the OGPU was renamed the Peoples Commissariat of Internal 
Affairs (NKVD), which retained control of all Soviet police forces up to 
February 1941. During this seven-year period, the NKVD took on the complex 
pattern of functions, powers and activities which, with some changesschar-
acterized the Soviet police system until the downfall of Minister of 
Interior Lavrenti Beria in July 1953. 
Many NKVD activities were the result of its control of the huge forced 
labor camps: which provided cheap and expendable labor for building rail-
roads: constructing irrigation systems: lumbering: mining, etc. Coal, gold 
and other metals, forest products: fisheries and other basic natural resources 
of the USSR comprised part of the vast economic-police empire of the NKVD: 
which functioned almost as a state within a state. 
I 
fHh SOVIET POLICE SYSTEM 
-19-
The NKVD's most dreaded function -- that of investigation: interroga-
tion and secret trials -- was brought into full play during the Moscow purge 
trials of 1936-1938. Under Stalin's overall direction: the MKVD was judge: 
jury and executioner. In this series of purges, the CPSU leadership was 
decimated and the armed forces were shorn of most of their higher officers. 
Before this period of mass executions ran its course: the MKVD chief, 
Genrikh Yagoda,was himself accused of intriguing with conspirators and shot 
in 1936. His successor, Mikolai Yezhov, lasted for two more violent years 
and then disappeared. 
In 1938 Stalin appointed a fellow Georgian, Lavrenti Beria, to head 
the NKVD police organization. Beria: who had been a member of the party's 
central committee for four years, rose rapidly in the party ranks. 
During the war years: Beria served as Commissar General for National 
Security and, after April 1943, he held two redesignated posts -- Minister 
of Interior (MVD) and Minister for State Security (IB) -- until his arrest 
in July 1953. (See footnote.) 
In a report to the 18th Congress of the CPSU, February 1939, Stalin 
acknowledged mistakes in respect to the purges: but explained complacently: 
"Nevertheless:the purge of 1933-1936 was unavoidable and its results on the 
whole were beneficial. Our Party is now somewhat smaller in membership: 
but on the other hand: it is better in quality." 
The purges to which Stalin referred were relatively minor and involved 
no such large-scale bloodshed as those in the late 1930's which he failed to 
mention. 
Starting with the Soviet annexation of eastern Poland in 1939 and of 
the Baltic states in 1940, the NKVD was responsible for the mass deportations 
and police terrorism in all the newly conquered lands. The barbarous measures 
taken by the MKVD in the Baltic Republics were the responsibility of General 
Ivan Serov, then Deputy Commissar and later chief of the Soviet secret police. 
(General Serov also was reported to have had a hand in the Soviet suppression 
of the Hungarian freedom rebellion in November 1956. In December 1958, Serov 
was replaced by Alexander Shelepin, former head of the Communist Youth Organ-
ization or Komsomol.) 
After the wartime reorganization of the Ministry of Internal Affairs: 
Beria coordinated and directed the work of both the MVD and the MGB -- a 
situation that gave him unparalleled powers, limited only by the decisions 
of Dictator Stalin. 
During World War II: certain changes took place in the official designation 
of the NKVD. On February 3, 1941, it had been divided into two People's 
Commissariats, that for Internal Affairs (NKVD) and that for State Security 
(NKGB). In 1946, because of the redesignation of the People's Commissariats 
as Ministries, the NKVD and the NKGB became: respectively, the MVD (Ministry 
of Internal Affairs) and MGB (Ministry of State Security).

- 20 - Chapter Four 
The military strength of the combined organizations under Beria's control 
came to an impressive total. A defecting MGB officer estimated that the MGB 
alone had about one million troops of various categories in 1953. But this 
concentration of police and military powers proved Beria's undoing. After 
Stalin's death in March 1953, Beria was a member of the "collective leader-
ship" that took over the reins of government. But the very existence of such 
an untrammeled authority as that wielded by Beria posed a threat to the new 
leaders, and in July 1953 they conspired in his arrest. 
Following the execution of Beria in December 1953: the MVD was shorn of 
Most of its economic powers and, in March 1954, the internal security or 
secret police functions were transferred to the Committee of State Security 
(KGB) under the Council of Ministers -- a potent arm of the CPSU. Thus the 
central committee regained control of the police system, including Counter-
intelligence, one of its most important functions. ? 
The subordinate relation of the KGB to the CPSU was again emphasized at 
an All-Union conference of leading officials of the police organization: held 
in Moscow in May 1959. The conference heard a report by KGB Chairman Shelepin 
and an address by A. I. Kirichenko, a member of the CPSU central committee 
presidium. 
Of significance is the letter sent by the KGB leaders to the CPSU central 
committee, which was published in Pravda on May 18. This communication in 
effect was a policy statement -- an unprecedented action for the KGB. The 
letter said in part: 
"The Twenty-first Party Congress comprehensively defined the role and 
place of the state security organs in the system of the Soviet state and 
their tasks as political organs of the Party under modern conditions, during 
the period of the construction on a broad front of a Communist society in 
our country." 
The KGB letter stated further: "Soviet Cheka officials (see footnote) 
have interpreted this as a fighting program for their activities, as a demand 
on the part of their own Communist Party to hoist the banner of revolutionary 
vigilance even higher...We Soviet Cheka officials well understand that a 
curtailment of our punitive functions within the country by no means signifies 
that we have less work to do or that the efforts of our enemies have slackened... 
Aggressive imperialistic states have at the present time raised subversive 
activity against the USSR and countries of the socialist camp to the level 
of state policy..." 
CHEKA is the Russian language abbreviation for the Extraordinary Commission 
for the Struggle with Counter-Revolution. Although the official designation 
of the Soviet internal security police has been changed several times since 
it was established, the term Cheka is still commonly used to describe the 
secret police and its personnel. 
IhE SOVIET POLICE SYSTEM - 21 - 
"Under these circumstances," the KGB letter added, "we are obliged to 
reply to the active efforts of our enemies with decisive counter-blows by 
the organs of state security and to direct the point of the proletarian 
sword primarily against the agents planted in the USSR and the countries 
of the socialist camp." This excerpt points to domination by the KGB over 
the police organizations of the satellite countries. 
In the 1959 KGB communication to the CPSU, the name of the Cheka's 
first chief, Felix Dzerzhinsky, is invoked as a model for the present police 
organization to emulate. The passage states: 
"In the future we shall continue to perfect the forms and working 
methods of the Cheka...to educate all officials of the state security organs 
in the spirit of unlimited devotion to the Communist Party...in the spirit 
of the glorious traditions of the All-Union Cheka, and to imbue our entire 
activity with the style and working methods of the brilliant Bolshevik-
Leninist F. E. Dzerzhinsky." 
The KGB policj statement implies that there are no internal enemies 
within the USSR. However, any individual who furthers the activities of 
external agents, even involuntarily, may be charged with aiding and abetting 
enemy agents. The mention. of Dzerzhinsky and his methods is significant 
because under him the Cheka exercised authority and powers that were inde-
pendent of the courts.

Chapter Five 
LABOR IN THE SOVIET STATE 
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) speaks to labor with two 
voices, depending on whether Communist spokesmen are discussing labor in the 
free world or within the Communist bloc. 
The gist of the official Communist thesis is: first, that all workers 
under capitalism are exploited, whereas, in the "workers' state" (under 
communism) they enjoy all the freedoms ascribed to them, in Marxist-
Leninist ideology, under the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
A further contention of Communists is that, as a result of the "Great 
October Revolution" -- the Bolshevik power seizure of November 7, 1917 --
a Communist government was established in the USSR, which expresses the 
collective will of workers and peasants and is responsive to their needs. 
On a worldwide basis, the CPSU exerts a dominant influence in the World 
Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), whose affiliates in the free world are 
controlled by Communists or fellow travelers. The picture of working-class 
life under "scientific socialism" (communism), presented by WFTU organizers 
and propagandists, differs materially from the actual situation of labor in 
the USSR. 
This situation is not due solely to the governing bureaucracy or to the 
hierarchical structure of the CPSU itself; the subordinate place of labor in 
the USSR -- except as a means of production -- stems from the policies of 
Lenin. 
During the period of political turmoil attending the Bolshevik Revolu-
tion, Lenin's followers used the slogan "All power to the soviets!" as a 
means of gaining the support of the workers' councils (soviets) which had 
sprung up in Russian industrial centers in 1917. 
However, Lenin distrusted the soviets, as he did all manifestations 
of popular or democratic sentiment. He also viewed the trade unions as 
potential competitors for power in the emerging new order. Lenin's pri-
mary allegiance, in fact, was not to the workers apostrophized in the 
Marx-Engels Communist Manifesto ("Workers of the world, unite!"), but to 
the Bolshevik Party in its "vanguard role" of leading the proletarian 
revolution. 
Although Communists, the world over, pay lip service to the principles 
of the Communist Manifesto, all Communist regimes follow Lenin's example in 
their treatment of the workers. 
LABOR IN THE SOVIET STATE - 23 - 
Following Lenin's forcible dissolution of the All-Russian Constituent 
Assembly in January 1918, a period of economic chaos set in, soon aggravated 
by civil war. In April, the Central Council of Trade Unions -- under the 
prodding of Lenin -- decreed the introduction of "work norms" (required 
standards of work performance), piece rates and bonuses. These became per-
manent features of labor under communism. 
During 1920, unrest among trade union rank-and-file members came to a 
head in the Workers' Opposition, an organization that called for trade-
union direction of industry, democratic rule in the CPSU, and participation 
in government. These labor dissidents, however, were beaten down at the 
10th Communist Party Congress in March 1921 and their platform was condemned 
as a "complete rupture with Marxism and Communism." 
Lenin's victory in the party congress came at a time when the sailors 
of the Kronstadt Naval Base, who had helped Lenin to power, were demanding 
new elections by secret ballot, free speech, freedom of the press, free trade 
unions and an end to political commissars in the armed forces. 
Under Lenin's orders, the Kronstadt uprising was brutally suppressed by 
Red troops led by Leon Trotsky and Mikhail Tukhachevsky. (Marshal Tukhachevsky 
was liquidated by Stalin in June 1937). 
The trade unions under the militant leadership of H.P. Tomsky still 
retained a considerable degree of independent action, but the 10th Party 
Congress, spurred by Lenin, initiated the first of a series of party purges, 
including the ousting of those who favored a strong role for labor in 
government. 
In May 1921, Tomsky was temporarily dismissed as chairman of the Central 
Council of Trade Unions. Although he was reinstated, he was gradually re-
duced to obscurity in party matters. In June 1929 (with Stalin in control 
of the CPSU), Tomsky was removed as head of the trade unions and in July 1930 
he was dropped from the Politburo. During the first of the Moscow purge trials, 
in August 1936, he committed suicide. 
The political and administrative impotence of the trade unions, which 
Lenin had fostered, was brought to completion by Stalin. Thus, in 1940, the 
leading authority on Soviet law, A. I. Denisov, accurately described the 
status of the unions when he wrote: 
"Formally, the Soviet trade unions are not a (Communis c) Party organi-
zation but, in fact, they are carrying out the directives of the Party. All 
leading organs of the trade unions consist primarily of Communists who execute 
the Party line in the entire work of the trade unions."

Chapter Five 
All the characteristics of labor under communism -- the work norm system, 
piece rates based on the norms, and "socialist emulation," or production 
speed-up drives -- were established in the early 1920's and perfected in the 
mid-1930's. 
During World War II, the few remaining rights of the workers were 
abolished, and all infractions of "labor discipline" were subject to harsh 
penalties under the Penal Code. Many of these punitive measures were repealed 
after the death of Stalin but the more "liberal" policy toward labor of the 
post-Stalin period does not basically alter the status of the trade unions as 
an arm of the state's enforcement and administrative machinery. 
State domination of trade unions, as developed in the USSR, characterizes 
all Sino-Soviet Communist regimes. Under this system, plant elections have 
no meaning ether than acceptance by the workers of candidates whom they can 
neither freely choose nor refuse. Union activities are confined to the settle-
ment of minor grievances, drives for "socialist emulation" (higher productivity), 
and carrying out state welfare programs. 
The work norm principle is closely associated with the term "socialist 
competition" or "emulation." In the 1930's the speed-up technique was intro-
duced by using pace-setters, known as Stakhanovites (from Stakhanov, the first 
noted pace-setter), who set a production record in a given operation on a 
short-time basis. This then became the norm for all workers performing the 
same operation. 
When the term Stakhanovite fell into disrepute because of endless, exhaust-
ing emulation drives, the exhibition-work performers were called "advanced 
workers" or "innovators." 
By fixing the maximum performance of "advanced workers" as the minimum 
required of all workers in an enterprise, base pay rates were established for 
"progressive and premium" piece-work. A common device of Communist plant 
management is to set a higher norm, thus effecting an actual cut in wages, 
since failure to meet a "progressive norm" means loss of take-home pay. 
The popular uprisings in East Germany in 1953 and in Poznan, Poland, in 
1956, were sparked largely over the question of higher norms. During the 
people's rebellion in Hungary in October 1956, one of the demands of the Cen-
tral Council of Hungarian Trade Unions was a "general end to production norms 
with the exception of factories where workers or workers' councils desire their 
maintenance." 
Lenin in 1918 deprecated the Bolshevik policy of "paying high wages to 
experts because of a shortage of specialists" and favored the "reduction of 
all salaries to the level of the average worker." This in practice proved to 
be impractical and in 1931 Stalin denounced wage equalization and called for 
progressive wage scales based on piece-work output. 
LABOR IN THE SOVIET STATE - 25 - 
Since the 1930's, wage differentials have been used to attract skilled 
workers to heavy industry and to induce their migration to new industrial cen-
ters in the Urals and eastern Siberia. At the same time, the "advanced" workers 
have been rewarded with special bonuses, premiums, privileges and honors. There 
has been an increasing gap between the wages of the skilled labor aristocrats 
and the average worker. 
In an effort to close this gap and also raise "labor productivity," CPSU 
leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1956 proposed to abolish multiple bonuses and 
replace them by a single bonus for aver-fulfillment of the work norm in each 
enterprise and industry. As a further step in this direction, managers of 
state enterprises have been authorized to raise production norms at any time --
thus reducing take-home pay -- if this leads to higher per capita productivity. 
In Soviet factories and industries, collective agreements are entered 
into between labor and management but these agreements -- between captive 
labor unions and Communist management -- bear no resemblance to those in effect 
in the free world. 
Comments on bad working conditions appear frequently in the Soviet pro-
vincial press. As a newspaper in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic stated 
on September 7, 1956: "Some plant directors are concerned with only one 
stipulation of collective a reements -- the fulfillment of production plans --
and ignore clauses concerning the protection of labor." Through all these 
complaints runs the refrain: "The officials were only interested in the ful-
fillment of the production plan." 
Trade union visitors from the free world, who have toured Soviet plants 
and installations have been shocked by the prevalence of unhealthful and 
hazardous working conditions, and the absence or poor condition of safety 
equipment. Both of these situations drew sharp criticism from a delegation 
representing the British National Union of Mine Workers which visited Soviet 
coal mines in 1956. 
A report by the British miners' chief Sam Watson cited the "shocking" 
conditions in the Soviet coal mines, especially the sight of women working 
underground, "some of them pushing heavy tubs of coal in wet places virtually 
unfit for strong men to labor in." The visitors found women on crutches and 
even pregnant women working in the mines. 
When Soviet mine officials were questioned about this, they replied that 
since men and women were equal in the USSR, there is no reason why women 
should not work below ground." Watson pointed out in reply that the pyramids 
were built by "equal men and women slaves." 
Although it has long been obvious that Soviet trade unions have no real 
power, their importance in the Soviet social order was extravagantly publicized

in 1957. The occasion of the first celebration, in June, was termed the 
"50th anniversary of the Soviet trade union movement." This is entirely mis-
leading. During the Czarist period, the Bolsheviks had little or no influence 
in the Russian trade unions, and they did not bring the union movement under 
complete party domination until 1922. 
For internal and external reasons, the trade unions were given a prominent 
place in the party's calendar of events in 1957. Plenary sessions of the All-
Union Central Council of Trade Unions were held in June, August, and December, 
The CPSU central committee awarded the affiliated unions the "Order of Lenin" 
at the August meeting, and at the December conference, some 7,000 trade unions 
and members received orders and medals. On December 17, the central committee 
decreed an expansion of trade union activities. 
The Soviet domestic situation was at least partly responsible for these 
steps. Repeated official emphasis on increased labor productivity already had 
indicated that a decline in worker enthusiasm was troubling the party's eco-
nomic planners. It had even been necessary, in some cases, to curtail annual 
production goals. Khrushchev's new economic decentralization program also 
necessitated certain readjustments in the Soviet labor union organizations. 
A further attempt to raise labor productivity, per worker and per produc-
tive unit, was evident in the decision of the CPSU central committee, announced 
on April 21, 1958, to introduce the 7-hour day in some branches of heavy in-
dustry and the 6-hour day for work underground, such as mining. 
On the basis of the established 6-day week, the new working hours for 
certain industries will be 41 hours weekly. These measures, to be carried out 
in 1958-1959, call for the restudy of wage scales. Since Soviet wage scales 
are tied in with work norms, workers may have to put in unpaid overtime, in 
addition to working at higher speed, in order to enjoy any benefits from re-
duced hours. On the other hand, shorter hours may spur productivity by reduc-
ing absenteeism and by giving workers an added incentive to maintain their output 
at the previous levels. 
A clue to the labor cost element in the new policy was the proviso in 
the central committee announcement..." as and when enterprises are ready to 
reduce the length of the working day and introduce the new conditions of pay-
ment for work, so as not to permit the lowering of the volume of industrial 
production, labor productivity, or excessive expenditure  of the established 
wage funds." 
According to the central committee's directive, responsibility for in-
suring that production is increased -- without materially adding to total wage 
expenditures in each enterprise rest with the party and trade union 
organizations.

LABOR IN THE SOVIET STATE - 27 - 
The CPSU central committee's objectives for the trade unions in 
1958, as set forth in the committee's decisions of 1957, were to intensi-
fy Communist-run union activities and broaden their scope within and out-
side of the Communist bloc. 
Soviet trade union representatives dominated the 4th World Conference 
of Trade Unions, held in Leipzig, East Germany, in October 1957. Moscow's 
policy is to bolster the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade 
Unions (WFTU) and, at the time, to push Communist infiltration of non-
Communist unions throughout the free world, especially in the underdeveloped 
countries. 
In this endeavor, every effort is being made by Communist trade union-
ists to picture the Soviet trade unions as free agencies of the Soviet 
workers. 
As part of the propaganda picture of "free Soviet trade unions," two 
decrees issued in July 1958 are significant. On July 16, a Supreme Soviet 
decree was released, which on the surface gives local factory trade unions 
an increased voice in plant management. On July.18 a decree issued jointly 
by the Council of Ministers and the Central Council of Trade Unions deals 
with the so-called Permanent Production Conferences, which have existed 
on paper for the past 35 years and are now being activated. 
According to the first decree, factory trade union committees have 
been granted the right to approve managerial appointments and to demand dis-
ciplining of managerial personnel who are derelict in their duty. The union 
committees also may challenge the dismissal of workers by management, and 
they are to have more say in regard to overtime work, welfare and safety 
measures, etc. 
The principal aim of the production conferences, on the other hand, 
is to ensure that state enterprises "fulfill and overfulfill production 
plans." These conferences, now scheduled to hold regular meetings, bear 
a superficial resemblance to the Yugoslav "workers' councils," but they 
are subordinate to the plant committees and therefore subject to CPSU 
control. 
Despite Moscow's claims that the two decrees promote "industrial demo-
cracy," there is no evidence that the hold of party cadres on plant committees 
will be relaxed. On the contrary, they will have broader powers to threaten 
any management that fails to carry out state production plans. 
Although the factory committees may be of advantage to the workers in 
certain limited respects, plant management -- taking orders from the Trade 
Union Council, a CPSU mouthpiece -- will continue to fix wages, work norms 
and working conditions in all Soviet industrial establishments.

Chapter Five 
In Khrushchev's report to the 21st CPSU Congress on the Seven Year 
Plan, a large section was devoted to a labor program, which is tied in 
with the overall production plan, 1959 through 1965. The main features 
of the Seven Year Plan in respect to labor calls for: (1) mobilization 
of some 11.5 million workers; (2) lowering production costs by nearly 11.5 
percent; and (3) an increase in per capita productivity of 45 to 50 
percent. 
Criticizing the "outdated, too-low work norms," Khrushchev made it 
clear that increasing the work norms will not be acccmpanied by a corre-
sponding increase in wages, percentagewise. 
For example, when the work norm in an industrial plant at Sverdlovsk 
was raised about 25 percent, wages increased only about 12 to 15 percent. 
Workers thus had to speed up unit production by one fourth but labor costs 
were held down by the small increases in wages paid out to workers. Fur-
ther, when the work norm is raised, workers who fail to meet the new 
standard of production receive less take-home pay than before. 
Raising wages of the 8 million workers in low-paid occupations accord-
ing to Khrushchev, will be done without increasing total wage and salary 
costs. It will be done at the expense of the higher income groups of 
skilled labor in preferred occupations. Current emphasis on the creation 
of "Communist labor brigades" also suggests a revival of the Stakhanovite 
system and "Communist competitions." 
The program for labor under the Seven Year Plan was discussed by 
Swiss economist Ernst Kux in an article published in Neue Zurcher Zeitung, 
Zurich, Switzerland, December 16, 1958. Kux pointed out that "while 
Khrushchev asserts that working hours are to be shortened without a lessen-
ing of labor salaries, it will nonetheless bring in actual fact a reduc-
tion of the real income of the laborers." 
Kux commented further that "the shortening of working hours and the 
raising of wages change nothing in the present situation of the Soviet 
worker, and one asks, with Lenin, how 'dozens and dozens of millions of 
people can be led to communism without material interest'." 
Khrushchev's answer to this is the promise of greatly increased 
mechanization of production but, in the words of economist Kux, "the Soviet 
economy will be hampered by excessively exploited and overage factories, 
by a tight labor market and by an agriculture which lags behind industrial 
production." 
Nevertheless, the possibility of a reasonable advance in living 
standards, even though far below anticipated goals, is not to be discounted. 
The price to be paid, according to Kux, lies in "new efforts on the part 
of the population" resembling those of the Stalinist period.

Chapter Six 
THE PARTY'S MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
4?11P 
From the time of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, agriculture has been 
one of the weakest links in the Soviet economy. This is not due solely --
as in the case of the lag in housing and consumer goods -- to continuing 
emphasis on heavy industry. However, the guns-instead-of-butter philosophy of 
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) accounts for some agricultural 
failures. 
The inadequacy of farm output in general has resulted mainly from the 
application of party dogmas to farming methods, organization and administration. 
Party control of farming has fluctuated from time to time; a stage is fast 
approaching wherein farm workers will be under a form of regimentation 
similar to that of industrial labor. 
Communist Party leader and Premier, Nikita Khrushchev, claims that the 
Soviet collective farm (kolkhoz) system follows the agricultural principles 
of Lenin. This is inaccurate. It was Stalin, and not Lenin, who forcibly 
imposed collectivization on Soviet Russia's peasantry and in the process 
caused the death of millions. Other millions of victims. ended their days 
in Siberian forced labor camps. 
In 1918 Lenin told the Council of People's Commissars: "Every intelli-
gent Socialist (Communist) will agree that socialism (communism) cannot be 
imposed on the peasantry by force, and we can rely only upon the force of 
example and on the masses of the peasants assimilating living experiences." 
After Lenin's death in 1924: Stalin moved gradually toward personal 
domination of the party and state. In 1928 he launched the first Five-Year 
Plan and at the same time decreed the collectivization of agriculture. The 
Stalinist policy of mass collectivization in 1929 was followed by the 
decision to liquidate the main opponents of the program -- the well-to-do 
farmers, known as kulaks. Under Stalin's prodding, this step was formal-
ized by a resolution of the 16th Party Congress, June-July 1930. 
The kulaks, who numbered about a million peasant families, were evicted 
from their farms, banished to forced labor, or executed. Although this 
campaign was aimed ostensibly at the more affluent farmers, opposition to 
Stalin's policy was so widespread that in many areas the entire peasant 
population suffered at the hands of the OGPU (secret police). 
Millions of peasants burnt their grain and slaughtered their herds. 
As a result, a famine of catastrophic proportions in 1931-1932 claimed several

million victims in southern Russia and Soviet Central Asia. Unorganized 
resistance to collectivized farming continued for many years. 
Khrushchev, in his report "On the Further Development of the Collective 
Farm System and the Reorganization of MIS (Machine Tractor Stations)," issued 
by the central committee on February 25, 1958, had this to say of the period 
when the peasants were being driven into collectivization: 
"'Millions of the poorest peasants and farm laborers were saved from 
enslavement by kulaks, poverty and ignorance...The creation and stabilization 
of the collective farm system is a victory of the Leninist general line of 
our party." 
The MTS network was established as an intrinsic part of the collectiviza-
tion system and up to about 1957 had been identified-with it in all Communist 
thinking. The Khrushchev proposal to reorganize the MTS, approved by the 
Supreme Soviet on March 31,was therefore considered revolutionary, although 
since 1956 some changes in the MTS status had become apparent. 
The state-operated MTS from the beginning had two primary functions --
one economic and the other political. As collective farms (kolkhozes) were 
not allowed to awn their own machinery, the mission of the MTS was to service 
adjacent kolkhozes by performing mechanical services -- plowing, harvesting 
and the like -- on a contract basis. 
The number of MTS rose from six in 1928 to more than 7,000 in 1940, 
reached a peak of 9,000 in 1955, and declined to 8,000 in 1958. The recent 
reduction in numbers was due to the assignment of MTS machines and personnel 
to state farms (sovkhozes). 
An equally important function of the MTS was to act as a political watch-
dog over the kolkhoz membership and management. Until recently, the Communist 
Party was scantily represented in rural areas and among collective farm members. 
Although overt opposition of peasants had ceased by the late 1930's, their dis-
satisfaction and indifference was expressed by failure to meet production 
goals, neglect of collective labor, and huge losses in grain harvests. 
The MTS, with virtual police powers, exercized pressure on the kolkhozes 
through control of all mechanical processes, and also through the activities 
of party secretaries and political instructors attached to MTS "zones." 
Since 1955, the party's hold on the collectives has been tightened by 
appointing party nominees as directors of the kolkhozes and by the assignment 
of tens of thousands of party members to rural areas. These steps were made 
somewhat palatable by granting the kolkhozes more leeway in production plan-
ing and by upping the prices paid by the state for kolkhoz products. 
The Stalin period was characterized by oppressive compulsory deliveries 
to the state of kolkhoz products, low prices paid to the collective farms, 
THE PARTY'S MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE - 31 - 
and the extraction of all possible income from agriculture in order to pro-
vide the state with capital for the expansion of heavy industries. 
After the death of Stalin in 1953, the kolkhozes were promised better 
treatment, but there was little improvement until 1956. In the meantime, a 
noteworthy transformation in the pattern of Soviet agriculture took place, 
which has continued at an accelerated rate. 
Since 1940, the trend in kolkhoz administration has been marked by a 
steady decline in kolkhoz numbers, and a consequent increase in their average 
size. Thus, in 1940 there were 235,000 collective farms; in 1955 there were 
85,000, and today there are about 72,000. The larger kolkhozes, with areas 
of 10,000 to 20,000 acrRs or more, may have several thousand persons living 
on them, including 500 or more peasant households, artisans, araftsmen, etc. 
They are, in fact, agricultural communities, rather than farms. 
Another tendency has been the increasing emphasis given to the develop-
ment of the state farm (sovkhoz) system. Although the number of sovkhozes 
has not shown an impressive increase -- from 4,000 in 1940 to 5,800 in 1957 --
their average size has more than tripled. As a result, the aggregate area 
of state farms has grown from 8.8 percent of the total cultivated area in 
the USSR in 1940 to 25 percent of the total today. 
The expansion of state farm areas is due largely to the fact that since 
1952 some 89 million acres of virgin and fallow land have been put to the 
plow -- almost all of it organized as sovkhozes. State farms have also grown 
by the absorption of adjacent collective farms -- a process that has been 
stepped up in the past three years. 
Unlike kolkhoz members, who have a limited vested interest in the col-
lective farm to which they belong and share its "profits," workers on state 
farms have no communal rights or interests whatsoever; they are merely day 
laborers employed by the state. This distinction is important because 
Khrushchev favors the sovkhoz system and plainly intends to bring the kolk-
hozes into line with it. 
In his "theses" on the reorganization of the MTS, Khrushchev referred 
to the state farms as a "superior form of ownership" and a "higher level of 
socialization." He advocated "raising the level of socialization of collective 
farm ownership and bringing it up to the level of national awnership...through 
a thorough consolidation and development of both state and collective farm 
ownership." 
Khrushchev added: "The work of collective farmers, based on a broad 
application of modern machinery, will approach in its characteristics the 
work of industrial workers."

Chapter Six 
This is pure Stalinist doctrine, not Leninism. Speaking at the 19th 
Congress of the CPSU in 1952, Stalin attributed Soviet agricultural failures 
to the existence of two kinds of property -- completely nationalized property, 
such as industry, and kolkhoz property. 
Stalin envisaged the future nationalization of all forms of property, 
including collective farms, within a unified system of "all-national ownership." 
This, he believed, would do away with the existing "money economy" and its 
"market exchange." However, he was willing to tolerate the "market exchange" 
as a concession to kolkhoz farmers, but was opposed to letting them awn their 
farm machines. 
Although Khrushchev's proposal -- to allow the kolkhozes to purchase farm 
machinery from the MTS and to transform the latter into Repair Technical Sta-
tions (RI'S) as state sales and service depots -- seems completely at variance 
with Stalin's principles, it amountsto the same thing, that is, the eventual 
transition of collective farmers to the status of day laborers working for 
the state. If the Communist Party is to exercise complete control of the kolk-
hozes, the question of ownership is immaterial. 
In his theses Khrushchev pointed out that the number of party members 
working in the kolkhozes increased by more than 230,000 between 1954 and 1958. 
This increase, plus the 80,000 newly appointed kolkhoz directors nominated 
by the party, means that the party now has a firm grip on the collective farmers 
and their'management. Khrushchev stated specifically that the political func-
tion of the MTS is no longer needed -- which explains his readiness to grant 
the ownership of machines to the kolkhozes. 
While emphasizing the party's dominant influence over the kolkhozes, 
Khrushchev also warned that further administrative purges, extending from 
collective farm directors to group foremen, were in prospect. In this con-
nection, he praised "experienced workers, who have undergone a serious school-
ing in organizational work and who have proved their skill in militantly 
implementing the decisions of the party and government on the upsurge of 
agriculture." 
Khrushchev added that collective farmers must be educated "day by day, 
in a spirit of conscious discipline." This is essentially the party doctrine 
applied to industrial workers. 
Another Khrushchev statement, linking his point of view to Stalin's, 
was his reference to the fact that although kolkhoz members work the land, 
they do not awn it. Also, on the status of the indivisible funds (funds 
that may not be divided among kolkhoz members as dividends), Khrushchev said 
that the indivisible funds are "wealth created by the nation"; hence, they 
are in the category of "all-national ownership." 
Sanitized Coov Arprov

THE PARTY'S MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE - 33 - 
The indivisible funds are used by the kolkhozes for the purchase of 
MIS machines and equipment, and the entire operation is being carried out 
under strict party supervision through the party appointees in collective 
farm management and other party agencies. 
The collective farms, in addition to MTS purchases, are under heavy 
obligations for other aspects of the reorganization program. MTS personnel 
transferred to kolkhoz payrolls need additional living quarters; MTS machines 
require storage facilities, and the farms have been advised to undertake an 
expanded road-building program -- at their own expense. 
In connection with the transformation of kolkhoz structures, there have 
been broad hints that the last vestiges of private farming -- the small per-
sonal plots worked by collective farm households -- are to be liquidated. 
(Recurrent official complaints charge that farmers neglect collective work-
norm requirements in favor of labor on their own plots.) 
A Moscow broadcast of March 25, 1957, quoted a party functionary as 
stating that, as a result of the new policy, "the practical necessity for 
collective farmers with subsidiary establishments (private plots) will cease. 
Receiving for their labor from the communal establishment considerably more 
than from the subsidiary one, collective farmers will themselves voluntarily 
forego their private cows and the cultivation of private kitchen gardens." 
Further confirmation of Khrushchev's objective of creating a rural 
proletariat was supplied during the 1958 session of the Supreme Soviet. A 
plan for a new nationwide farm union was submitted by Dmitri Poliansky, a 
member of the CPSU central committee from Krasnodar -- a wheat-growing 
region. The new union would embrace workers of collective farms, state farms, 
and former MTS, now the RTS. 
Since Soviet trade unions are used almost exclusively as functional 
arm sof the state control apparatus, a farm union would serve a like purpose. 
According to Poliansky, the "organization of such a trade union would ensure 
an increase in labor discipline and labor productivity." It would also erase 
any remaining distinctions between collective farmers and regimented industrial 
workers. 
A further radical innovation in the agricultural system was announced by 
Khrushchev in a speech of June 17, 1958, to the CPSU central committee. The 
plan involves abolishing the previous system of compulsory deliveries of farm 
products and for payment by the state in cash instead of in kind. 
Offhand, the new program seems to offer inducements for greater production 
by state and collective farmers. But whether collective farm workers actually 
derive substantial benefits -- in consumer goods, better housing, etc. --
remains to be seen.

Cash payment in fact was essential to the complicated bookkeeping of 
the state and collective farms, once they engaged in buying machinery from 
the former MTS. Khrushchev explained that the new state purchase price will 
vary from region to region, depending on production costs, and also from year 
to year, according to harvest conditions. He stated further than the pro-
curement system henceforth must guarantee delivery to the state of an increased 
volume of agricultural produce, and at reduced costs. These, in essence, are 
the same criteria that govern production by state industrial establishments. 
In his speech, Khrushchev declared that agricultural technicians trans-
ferred from MTS to collective farms must be responsible for bringing about 
the planned "upsurge" in agriculture -- at low cost -- and intimated that the 
salaries of experts will depend on their success in achieving these ends. In 
explaining his program, Khrushchev often refers to the "creative initiative" 
of the collective farmers and their "voluntary" efforte to increase production, 
but in view of the party's iron grip on all facets of agriculture, these are 
euphemisms. 
By January 1959, about tO percent of the collective farms (kolkhozes) had 
purchased MTS machinery, according to an official report. In another report, 
Minister of Agriculture Matskevich disclosed that between January 1, and May 1, 
1956, the number of collectives decreased from 76,000 to 72,000 -- a drop of 
about 7.7 percent. (During the entire year, the number of kolkhozes declined 
by more than 10,000.) 
Taken together, these items indicate that a considerable number of 
collectives have been unable to finance the purchase of MTS machines, and 
that the uneconomic farms are being rapidly absorbed into larger farm units. 
Recently, a further drastic change in the kolkhoz structure was suggested 
in a series of articles by Soviet farm experts. Published in official 
journals, these pieces are presumed to represent the thinking of the 
Khrushchev faction. 
In the course of the technical discussion some startling data on the col-
lective farm situation was given by the writers. Figures were cited showing 
the great disparity between the income of farm workers on the most profitable 
kolkhozes, compared with average farm incomes and those of farms with marginal 
productivity. 
Agrarian writer Ivan Vinnichenko, in an article in the June 1958 issue 
of the periodical October, pointed out that it is an anachronism for some col-
lectives to pay 30 rubles for a labor-day while at the opposite extreme there 
are many farms that cannot afford to pay more than one and a half rubles for 
the same amount of work.

THE PARTVS MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE - 35 - 
(Note: The average income for communal farm work is 3.65 rubles per work day 
plus one to one and one-half kilograms of payment-in-kind. This total is 
below the average subsistence level, but the deficit per worker is compensated 
by products of individual garden plots.) 
The "millionaire" kolkhozes are those raising preferred industrial 
crops such as cotton, which have been heavily subsidized by the state, or 
they are in areas of exceptional fertility and operate under competent 
management. 
Any attempt to introduce even modified equalization of income between 
these privileged establishments and the less productive kolkhozes, which are 
far more numerous, poses formidable problems for Soviet agricultural planners. 
Vinnichenko also called attention to the widespread practice of hoarding 
grain on the most profitable farms, in order to sell on the open market where 
prices are twice as high as those paid by the state agencies. Storage of 
grain surpluses in the homes of peasants, he said, results in a heavy loss 
through spoilage. 
The trend of the comments by the experts indicate that marked changes 
in Soviet agrarian policy are in the making. These developments, it appears, 
will include an all-cash system of remuneration for the more advanced farms 
and a reappraisal of incomes of both the average kolkhozes and those at the 
lowest economic levels. 
A program offered by the experts calls for the creation of a unified 
cooperative system, based on the amalgamation of large numbers of economi-
cally weak farms into a series of kolkhoz unions. The planning, purchasing, 
and distribution apparatuses of several districts and even of regions would 
be coordinated in a single kolkhoz union (kolkhoz soiyuz).

The goals for agriculture, announced by Khrushchev as part of the

more than 100 million tons); of 16 million tons of meat, and 100 million 
tons of butter.

up new lands. In fact, Khrushchev told the 21st CPSU Congress that future 
use of virgin and fallow land will be on a "reduced scale" and will not 
provide a further increase in gross grain harvests. On the other hand, the 
planned production of 30 million tons of fertilizer, if achieved, will cause 
only a modest increase in productivity per hectare. 
Marked increases in meat and milk production depend to a large extent 
on tripling fodder production -- from 30 million tons to 90 million tons 
by 1965. There are at present no prospects for such a phenomenal rise in 
fodder output, and Khrushchev himself refers to the "lag in fodder production" 
as a continuing problem. 
In a speech on June 29, 1959, to the CPSU central committee plenum, 
Khrushchev admitted that "organizational guidance of farming is not perfect" 
and criticized party work in agriculture. "Bureaucratism must be stopped as 
quickly as possible," he said. 
Nalenkov in October 1952 voiced the same complaint at the 19th CPSU 
Congress where he was the principal speaker. He also censured, without naming, 
the author of a plan to establish "agro-towns" -- a form of urbanized, 
industrialized agriculture which Khrushchev had proposed in 1950. Rejected 
by Stalin at that time, the idea has again been broached as a projected 
development in Soviet agricultural planning.

THE PARTY'S POSITION ON RELIGION 
In 1843 Karl Marx said: "Religion is the opiate of the people; our 
duty is to deliver the people from this opiate." 
Lenin in 1909 enlarged on the Marx aphorism by declaring: "Religion 
is the opium of the people -- this dictum of Marx's is the cornerstone of 
the whole Marxist view of religion. Marxism has always regarded all modern 
religion and churches and all religious organizations as instruments of 
bourgeois reaction." 
Stalin in 1927 introduced a new note by stating: "Science and religion 
are two incompatible concepts. The Communist State works for the glory of 
science and thus is incompatible with religion." 
Thirty years later, this maxim was given current relevancy in connection 
with the successful launching of the first earth satellite by the USSR. 
Shortly after Sputnik was launched in October 1957, Moscow radio announced 
that the achievement had "immense importance for atheistic propaganda" be-
cause Sputnik made it "impossible to believe in religious fabrications about 
God Almighty." 
A few days later, Radio Moscow broadcast a lengthy youth lecture on 
science and religion. The broadcast stressed that the "correct world out-
look is the direct antithesis, the full antithesis to religion...Every 
scientist, if he is indeed a scientist, proves by his work that God does 
not exist." 
During the past three decades, the Soviet approach to the inculcation 
of atheism has gone through several phases, the latest being that of scien-
tific education as an antidote to religion. 
In the period immediately following the 1917 Revolution, churches and 
mosques were pillaged; persecution was widespread although relatively un-
systematic. However, the various Union Republics began drafting highly 
restrictive laws in regard to religious practices. 
For example, the criminal code of the Russian Soviet Federated 
Socialist Republic (RSFSR), enacted in 1926, specified that "instruction 
of the under-aged or minors in religious doctrines in state or private 
educational institutions and schools or the violation of the rules estab-
lished for this is punishable by corrective labor for a period of one 
year. 
Under this provision, thousands of priests were sent to forced labor 
camps during the collectivization period, 1929-1931. Untold numbers of 
mullahs and other religious leaders received the same treatment.

The RSFSR Code also forbade religious organizations to engage in chari-
table works create mutual assistance funds, or carry on other extra-clerical 
activities. Although criminal penalities against this type of church vork 
are no longer imposed, the Soviet Government makes it difficult, if not im-
possible, for church organizations to conduct social and charitable activities. 
Another RSFSR decree) followed by similar actions taken by the other 
Soviet republics, deprived religious groups of their property, their legal 
status, their right to maintain schools, and all grants from the government. 
Nationalization of church property led to the closing of the majority of 
Christian churches and Islamic mosques. 
By 1933 it was estimated that 50 to 60 percent of the Orthodox churches 
-- largest of the denominations in the USSR -- had been closed. Information 
on the closing of mosques is more specific. In 1942, Soviet War News, an 
official periodical, revealed that whereas there had been 7,000 mosques in 
European Russia alone before the Bolshevik Revolution, only 1,312 remained 
throughout the entire USSR. Some 8,000 Muslim schools had been terminated 
by the government. 
The antireligious campaign in the Baltic States began with the Soviet 
troop occupatic.in. In Lithiumia, which was predominantly Roman Catholic, 
the leading personnel of religious organizations were arrested by Soviet 
authorities in 1940. Some were executed, while others were sent to forced 
labor camps in the USSR. 
In Estonia and Latvia, as well as in Lithuania, church property was 
confiscated, religious publications were suspended, and religious teaching 
was outlawed. 
In 1943, when the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union posed a serious 
threat to the country, Stalin temporarily decreed a policy of religious 
tolerance which, for the first time, gave some meaning to the provision of 
the 1936 Constitution guaranteeing "freedom of religious belief." Soviet 
war efforts thereafter were supported by pronouncements fram Moscow's 
Orthodox Patriarchate. Also, a "Central Asian Muslim Administration" was 
set up to promote wartime loyalty among the Muslims. 
Although overt religious persecution was less pronounced in the USSR 
after the end of World War II, a new antireligious campaign began in Eastern 
Europe as the border states fell under Soviet domination in 1948-1950. 
Leading Roman Catholic and Protestant figures in the satellite states 
were imprisoned or subjected to house arrest. Only those Orthodox church. 
leaders who adhered to the party's policies were spared. At the same time, 
Patriarch Alexei of Moscow sought to impose his authority on the Eastern 
European Orthodox churches, none of which had previously acknowledged the 
primacy of the Moscow. patriarchate.

THE PARTY'S POSITION ON. RELIGION - 39 - 
Places of worship that were closed in the USSR between 1918 and 1940 
were turned into atheist museums, cinemas, social clubs or warehouses. 
Atter the death of Stalin in 1953, some churches were reopened and several 
mosques were restored. 
Although the Soviet Constitution proclaims the theoretical right of 
religious freedom, the CPSU itself remains adamant in its opposition to 
all religion as basically incompatible with communism. Lenin, for example, 
once declared: "We (the Bolsheviks) demand that religion should be a 
private affair as far as the State is concerned, but under no circumstances 
can we regard religion as a private affair as far as our Party is concerned." 
Members of the CPSU and the League of Communist Youth (Komsomol) are 
required not only to profess atheism but also to take an active part in anti-
religious activities and propaganda. 
For example, the youth organization's official publication, Komsomolskaya 
Pravda on February 12, 1957, quoted a decree of the Komsomol central committee 
making it compulsory for all Komsomol groups to "improve scientific atheistic 
propaganda among youth." 
In the same month, an. editorial in the Central Asian newspaper Altaskaya  
Pravda, while repeating that it was necessary to step up atheistic propaganda, 
tried to reconcile the party's antireligious drive with Soviet constitutional 
provisions regarding freedom of worship. 
"The Soviet State," said the editorial, "guarantees its citizens full 
and unlimited freedom of conscience in accordance with Article 24 of the 
Constitution. This article stipulates freedom of worship as well as freedom 
to conduct antireligious propaganda, at the discretion of citizens. 
"Our (Communist) Party has demanded and continues consistently to demand 
that its organizations increase dissemination of atheistic knowledge and 
assist workers to free themselves of religious prejudices. 
"However, it must be noted. with regret that some Party, trade union, 
Komsomol, and other organizations whose duty it is to conduct mass cultural 
educational work, are too mindful of freedom of conscience, and for one 
reason or another forget about freedom to conduct antireligious propaganda 
and about arming workers with a materialistic world outlook and natural, 
scientific, atheistic knowledge." 
Soviet propaganda's dual stand on religion is illustrated in the case 
of the treatment given to Islam. Moscow radio broadcasts on the subject of 
Islam differ materially, depending on whether the broadcast is for domestic 
or Middle East consumption. 
In July 1956, for example, Radio Moscow, in a broadcast to the Middle 
East in Arabic, quoted the "Chairman of the Muslim Board of the European

Part of the USSR and Siberia" as saying: "Our children are being educated 
in freedom." But the same station, in a broadcast to the Soviet home 
audience a month earlier, had stated: "The only attitude of Soviet schools 
toward religion is one of irreconcilable hostility." 
Four regional Muslim "boards" -- puppet Islamic organizations -- now 
operate under the supervision of the Soviet Council of Religious Cults. The 
carefully selected Muftis who head these boards are promoters of party 
policies. They also originate propaganda directed toward Muslim countries 
outside the Soviet bloc. On visits to Arab lands, the Soviet Muftis repeat 
CPSU propaganda themes, claiming religious freedom in the USSR, while 
Ignoring Soviet campaigns against Islam. 
Thus, a brochure intended for domestic consumption, titled "Islam, its 
Origin and its Social Content," calls Islam a "profoundly reactionary re-
lation." Originally written by Soviet Academician L. I. Klimovich in 1936, 
the book:was revised for publication in 1956. It is published in Moscow 
under the sponsorship of the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of 
Political and Scientific Knowledge, an organization controlled by the cen-
tral committee of the CPSU through its member, Mitin, the society's presi-
dent. 
In this work, central committee first secretary Nikita Khrushchev is 
quoted (Pravda, Demcember 110 1955) as having stated during a trip to India: 
"Representatives of many religions live in the Soviet Union. However, 
this does not create any misunderstandings in our country, and the Soviet 
people live and work as a united family. 
"The problem of religion is a problem of the conscience of every person 
and every nation." 
Some three months earlier, on September 22, 1955/ Khrushchev had told 
a visiting French delegation: "We remain atheists, and we will do all we 
can to liberate a certain portion of the people from the charms of the 
religious opium that still exists." 
In May 1957 the party sponsored an atheist conference in Moscow which 
was attended by some 350 antireligious propagandists. 
Following the conference, the "League of Militant Godless," disbanded 
in 1941, was revived. A more ambitious undertaking was the establishment of 
the "House of the Atheist" at Odessa, the first institution devoted exclu-
sively to atheistic indoctrination and training. 
The "House of the Atheist" is described as the center of "antireligious 
and cultural enlightenment work among the population." It trains atheist 
propagandists and sends activists into workers' hostels and clubs.

THE PARTY'S POSITION ON RELIGION - 41 - 
In 1958, a "University of Atheism" was established at Ashkabad, Turk-
menistan, and a similar institution was organized in Ieningrad toward the 
end of the year. Other such institutions are in process of formation. 
On another front, the year-end issue of Red Star, organ of the Soviet 
Army, was devoted to the subject of antireligious activities in the ranks 
of the Soviet military establishment. The article disclosed that on 
December 29, 1958, a conference took place in the Main Political Admin-
istration of the Soviet Army and Navy which "discussed the position and 
tasks of atheistic propaganda." Red Star reminded its readers that "it 
must always be borne in mind that our (Communist)Party has been and is 
considering atheist propaganda an integral part of Communist education." 
The December 1958 issue of the magazine Partiynaya Zhizn (Party Life), 
semimonthly organ of the CPSU central committee, complained that 'a "certain 
section of party and Soviet workers adhere to the mistaken opinion that 
with the liquidation of the class base of the church in our country, the 
need has vanished for active atheist propaganda...Our Party has always 
taken and now takes a position of militant atheism and irreconcilable 
aggressive ideological struggle against the narcotic of religion." 
The article also said that the central committee's decree of November 10, 
1954, "On Mistakes in the Execution of Scientific Atheistic Propaganda among 
the Population"?had been misunderstood to imply a relaxation of the "systematic 
struggle against religious ideology and the beginning of a curtailment of 
antireligious propaganda." The article added: "All this has created favorable 
conditions for clergymen and sectarians and their religious activities." 
A significant admission by Party Life was the statement that some members 
of the Communist Party "themselves participate in various altar rites and 
ceremonies/ forgetting that this is incompatible with the title of Party 
member." 
References in the press of the non-Russian republics during 1958 
revealed that nut only Communist party members but also members of the 
Komsomol in some areas had engaged in religious rites and attended meetings 
of believers. Warnings against these practices were reiterated in official 
organs of the Central Aisian republics, Georgia, the Ukraine and the Baltic 
States. 
In the case of the Armenian SSR, a paradoxical situation developed. 
In October 1958/ the fiftieth birthday of Vazgen I (head of the Armenian 
Apostolic Church) and the third anniversary of his enthronement as Supreme 
Patriarch (Catholicos) of all Armenian believers, within and outside of 
the Soviet Union, was celebrated at Echmiadzin, Soviet Armenia. Present 
at the two-week ceremonies were representatives of the Armenian Apostolic 
Church from the USSR and from non-Communist countries.

The ceremonies were given full coverage by the Soviet preas and radio. 
The wide publicity given to the event suggests there was an element of 
political motivation, designed to appeal to Armenians outside the Soviet 
bloc, mainly in Turkey and Iran. 
Party Life, however, in an article published two months after the 
religious event in Soviet Armenia, reaffirmed the party's attitude toward 
such celebrations. It stated that it would be "incorrect to think that a 
growth of religiosity is occurring in our country, that the number of 
believers is growing. On the contrary there is occurring a gradual but 
unbroken process of the final departure of believers fram religion and 
its organizations." 
The Large Soviet Encyclopedia, which accurately reflects party policy 
on all subjects, carries numerous articles dealing vith religion. Published 
under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the current edition 
of the Encyclopedia refers to religious rituals and doctrines in terms of 
myths and legends. 
The Encyclopedia's assaults on Roman Catholicism are concentrated 
largely on the Vatican as an institution and on the late Pope Pius XII 
personally. A typical statement declares: "The Vatican videly utilizes 
the press, radio and films for the purpose of aggressive propaganda, under 
religious disguise, of reactionary political ideas, and the struggle against 
communism and progressive scientific thought." 
References to Protestantism in the Encyclopedia endeavor to equate 
Protestants with "capitalistic exploitation" and "colonialism." The opening 
paragraph on the general subject states: 
"Protestantism, as a bourgeois variety of Christianity, justified 
capitalistic enterprises, profit and exploitation? ? ?In the USSR, Protes-
tantism in the form of Lutheranism is spread to a certain extent in the 
Latvian and Estonian SSR's. The social roots of Protestanism? as of all 
religions, have been exterminated in the USSR." 
Under the beading of Islam, the Large Encyclopedia has this to say: 
"In the Eastern countries beyond the (Soviet) border -- in Turkey, the 
Arabian countries, Iran, Afghstnistan, Pakistan, Indonesia -- where Islam 
is the religion of the state, it continues to remain one of the weapons 
In the hands of local reaction and foreign imperialism."

THE PARTY'S ROLE IN ELLVATION 
The place of education and culture under "scientific socialism" (commu-
nism) had not been precisely defined when Lenin -- founder of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) -- died in 1924. 
Up to that time, millions of children in the Soviet Union had been 
receiving instruction of sorts -- most of it rudimentary -- during years 
of civil war, famine, and social and economic chaos. What pedagogic methods 
should be utilized to further communism and strengthen a Communist Govern-
mend was a subject of debate then, and for another decade, while Joseph 
Stalin was forging his personal domination of the party and state. 
In 1934, Stalin told a visiting journalist: "Education is the weapon 
the effect of which depends upon the one who holds it in his hands, and the 
one who is struck with it." 
The doctrine that education is one of many "weapons" in the hands of 
a Communist regime -- and a vits_rly important one -- is still a cardinal 
principle in all Communist-run countries. This was stated in an article 
published in the official Soviet journal Culture and Life of August 31, 
1947: 
"The Soviet school cannot be satisfied to rear merely educated persons. 
Basing itself on the facts and deductions of progressive science, it should 
instill the ideology of communism in the minds of the young generation, shape 
a Marxist-Leninist world outlook and inculcate the spirit of Soviet patriotism 
and Bolshevik ideas in them." 
Another important factor in the development of Soviet education, and 
the keystone of its present structure, is the emphasis on science. Communist 
devotion to science is bound up with the Marxist doctrine of the "material-
istic world outlook." Both Marx and Lenin and their disciples looked upon 
the Communist version of science as the bulwark of "scientific socialism" 
(communism), and as an antidote to the "opiate of religion." 
Lenin envisaged scientific progress as the only means of lifting Russia 
from its technological backwardness to the status of a modern Communist state. 
However, when Stalin inaugurated the first Five Year Plan, designed to create 
a powerful industrial and military state, he was faced at once with the scar-
city of Soviet technicians, industrial managers, and scientific specialists. 
This lack of trained personnel was so acute during the 1930's that 
foreign technicians, including those with "bourgeois" backgrounds, were 
brought in to fill the void and help guide the USSR toward the goal of 
Industrialization.

Even at the start of World War U, the Soviet Union was so deficient 
in the technical means of carrying on modern warfare that the Soviets had 
to rely to a large extent on help from the Western allies. Hence, in the 
postwar years, every effort was made to turn out an increasing number of 
technicians, industrial managers, and scientists. These have become priv-
ileged classes in the Soviet social order and are relieved of maw of the 
ideological demands the party imposes on peasants and industrial workers. 
The Soviet statistical handbook (1956) states that the number of 
"specialists with higher and secondary special education employed in the 
USSR national economy" on January 1, 1956, totaled about 5.5 million. 
This figure includes doctors, lawyers, journalists, and other professional 
people as well as technicians, engineers, managers of state enterprises, 
etc. 
Of this total, 25 percent were listed as engineers and 7.5 percent as 
agricultural specialists of various kinds. The predominance of engineers 
testifies to the Communist Party's concern for heavy industry, especially 
in military fields, mining, construction, transportation, etc. The scien-
tific, managerial and technical personnel constitute an elite class, with 
incomes ranging into the upper levels of remuneration in Soviet society. 
The emphasis in Soviet education on science -- particularly as applied 
to the processes of heavy industry, atomic and projectile development and 
so forth -- again represents a spectacular extension of the party dogma that 
regards education primarily as a "weapon against capitalism." 
This "weapon" has another use in Moscow's trade and aid agreements with 
underdeveloped countries, where the ultimate purpose is political rather 
than economic. In most instances, an economic assistance pact calls for a 
multitude of Soviet specialists to be sent -- as a vanguard for political 
infiltration -- to the recipient country. These specialists are not likely 
to be directly engaged in subversive activities, but they prepare the ground 
for it. 
Lenin's concept of party "unity" anediscipline" has affected the whole 
structure of Soviet education. Specifically, it has meant that the content 
of Soviet textbooks and all teaching material, once established by party 
functionaries, is not subject to critical inquiry or reappraisal by teachers 
or students. 
Party control of the school system and all pedagogic literature has led 
to anomalous situations. In the years immediately following World War 11, 
the rationale of Soviet culture and education underwent a series of shifts 
in the party line, due in part to conflicts within the party itself. 
From mid-1948 on, a science controversy, which began in the field of 
genetics, spread to the other natural sciences and to medicine. It was 
the result of a dramatic rise to scientific power of Trofim Lysenko, a 
geneticist who von the backing of Stalin.

THE PARTY'S ROLE IN EDUCATION - 45 - 
At a meeting of the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Science, July 31, 
1948, Lysenko advanced a doctrine of 'genetics which brought him fame 
the USSR and derision from leading geneticists in the free world. According 
to Lysenko, dialectical materialism proves that environment -- and not 
inherited genes -- is the prime factor in determining individual charac-
teristics. 
For a few years, Lysenko was virtually dictator of natural sciences 
in the Soviet Union and his opponents were ruthlessly demoted or purged. 
But by 1953, the Lysenko doctrines were discredited and their author had 
been deposed as science czar. However, Soviet genetics is still dominated 
by party dons. Recently, Lysenko's scientific status was restored. 
As another example, from the late 1930's and up to the death of Stalin 
in 1953, the entire subject matter of instruction, with .a few exceptions, was 
permeated with Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism -- the main emphasis being on the 
last-named member of the trinity. 
After CPSU chief Khrushchev downgraded Stalin in February 1956, it be-
came necessary to revise large sections of the textbooks and reference works 
then in use -- a task that has not yet been completed. Also, publication 
of Volume 29 of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, containing Stalin's biography, 
was held up and the following volume was issued instead. 
The Encyclopedia itself, in its treatment of historical events inside 
and outside of the Soviet bloc countries, is largely a compilation of Marxist-
Leninist propaganda and dialectical sophistries. This is especially evident 
in the bias shown toward all religious subjects. 
Since the preparation of the Great Encyclopedia is conducted under strict 
party supervision, any changes in the party line or in the standing of Soviet 
notables is reflected in revisions that are constantly taking place. 
The Communist Party's objective -- to mold the "Communist. man" from 
childhood to adult years -- depends for success on the government's ability 
to insulate all pupils and students from "bourgeois" influences and informa-
tion. This Iron Curtain, which has been imposed on the educational system 
for almodt forty years, was lifted briefly during the Sixth Festival of 
=Youth, held in Moscow in 1957. 
The $150-million propaganda spectacle, staged for the purpose of in-
fluencing.the thousands of youthful visitors, backfired to some extent as 
Soviet young people were brought into direct contact with groups from the 
free world. 
Free world students attending the festival were struck by two charac-
teristics of the Soviet youths they encountered -- first, an intense curiosity 
about the outside world, and secondly, profound ignorance of its realities.

On the other hand, except for a minority of more knowledgeable students, 
few of the Soviet young people were disposed to criticize either the tenets 
of Marxism-Leninism or the CPSU. Nevertheless/ there was considerable skep-
ticism regarding the official version in the Soviet press of the Hungarian 
freedom rebellion. 
The most thoroughly indoctrinated young persons 
amenable to outside arguments -- were members of the 
zation. The Kbmsomcls in fact are the main channels 
control at secondary school and higher institutional 
-- and these least 
Komsomol youth organi-
of CPSU influence and 
levels. 
The party also sets its doctrinal line through control of the official 
organs, Teachers' Gazette and Komsomolskaya Pravda. 
The Young Communist League, or Komsomol, with its network of komsomols 
extending throughout the educational system and into the armed services, 
continues the work of the Young Pioneers -- an organization for inculcating 
Marxism-Leninism in its simplest form in elementary schools. 
Komsomol members, ages 2.4 throligh 26, number about 18 million. From 
this organization are drawn the candidate members and members of the CPSU, 
after they have proved their devotion to the party in various ways. 
One of the most important functions of the Komsomol is to carry on the 
party's continuing anti-religious campaign. Komsomol members, like CPSU 
members/ are expected to profess atheism and to strive to uroot out the 
remnants of superstition" in the people. 
A new role for the Komsomol was proposed by Khrushchev in a speech at 
the Komsomol Congress, April 1958. The Premier called for a drastic reorgan-
ization of Soviet education and demanded that the Komsomol organizations take 
an active part in carrying out the plan. This involves state-directed labor 
service, on farms and in factories, by all youths who seek more advanced 
technical instruction. 
As outlined by Khrushchev, the plan is to select more candidates for a 
college education from talented factory and farm workers and, secondly, to 
send university students to collective farms and industrial plants for ex-
perience in manual work. Beginning at the secondary school level/ students 
will be directed into labor fields; if, during their apprenticeship/ they 
show marked proficiency -- and also measure up to Communist Party standards 
in party work and enthusiasm -- they may become candidates for higher edu-
cation or specialized training. 
The reasons given by Khrushchev for his radical program do not explain 
all the factors back of the CPSU decision. He said that in 1957 at least 
700,000 high school students were denied admission to higher educational 
institutions and that from 1953 through 1956 the number turned away was 2.2 
r.nnv ArlDroved for Release 
? 
THE PARTY'S ROLE IN ErUCATION - 117 - 
million. This situation, he said, was due mainly to the fact that these 
institutions, which include correspondence schools, lack facilities for 
admitting more than 450,000 new students annually. 
Further light was thrown on the Soviet educational situation by an 
editorial in Moscow's newspaper Pravda of September 25, 1957. The editorial 
considered the "growth of a new -e.d-J3-1.ssr -- the Soviet privileged elite --
in relation to higher education. The Pravda article admitted that "only 
a small fraction of secondary school graduates are admitted into higher 
and technical schools." Those who fail to gain admission must seek 
employment in industrial plants and mines and on collective farms. 
The editorial pointed out/ however/ that young people belonging to 
the "new class" do not want to accept the status of workers because at 
that level they find it hard to get ahead. Pravda suggested that a safety 
valve for such young people might be a period of work in industry as a 
prerequisite to a higher education, but conceded that this would not solve 
the problem of caste formation. 
The Pravda article highlighted a situation in Soviet education which 
has long prevailed, namely that the children of the new class -- the class 
of party functionaries, bureaucrats, managerial personnel, higher special-
ists and engineers -- have been favored over all others in educational 
opportunities. Pravda itself has given the ratio of privileged to non-
privileged candidates for admission as three to one. 
Khrushchev declared that the selection of candidates for admission to 
higher educational institutions "must be made according to the standards of 
preparation, inclination, and assurance that the person will justify the 
expense involved, and that he can really become a useful leader and organizer 
of production." Thus/ the factor. of "increased labor productivity" becomes 
a decisive element in higher education. 
The Khrushchev plan was accepted by the CPSU central committee presidium 
on September 20, 1958, and received formal endorsement by the central com-
mittee plenum on November 12. Four days later, the central committee, in 
conjunction with the Council of Ministers, issued "theses" on the proposal, 
for public discussion. 
The theses clarified a number of points sketched in by Khrushchev. It 
was made clear, for example, that the union republics are expected to pass 
lams requiring compulsory schooling for at least eight Years. (Eaucation in 
the USSR is the responsibility of the constituent republics.) As presented 
in the theses, the program calls for: 
A proposed second stage of secondary education, during which most 
students will do productive work and study part time in three types of 
schools: (1) schools for working and rural youth; (2) secondary general 
education labor poIytechnical schools; and (3) technical schools/ or 
teknikums.

- 48 - Chapter Eight 
Students in the first two types of schools, who successfully complete 
the prescribed three-year program, will be eligible for admission to higher 
institutions of learning. However: these students will have less class-room 
time in the 9th through 11th grades than those in the present 9th and 10th 
grades. Some of the more promising students in these grades may be given a 
shorter working day or be released from production two or three days a week. 
Special schools for gifted children in the arts and music will be continued. 
Significantly, the original Khrushchev proposal has been modified in 
that not all students at university levels will be required to hold full-
time jobs during the first two or three years. The exceptions, according 
to the theses, will be students engaged in the "complicated theoretical 
disciplines," namely, future engineers and scientists of above-average 
ability. The revised version also indicates that four or five years, in-
stead of a much shorter period, will be needed to carry out the program in 
its entirety. 
The means for implementing the Khrushchev scheme -- and a weapon in the 
hands of the CPSU -- is the authority granted the Komsomols and trade unions 
to name those who may go on to a higher or advanced technical education. 
Since both the Kamsomols and the trade unions are instruments of the party, 
the decision in each case amounts to selecting individuals who meet the 
party' d requirements as to reliability and "enthusiasm." 
In his speech to the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Khrushchev said, in 
this connection: "Some workers do not appreciate the danger of bourgeois 
influences on Soviet youth: but consider the bourgeoisie is far away and 
does not touch our youth. But this is a fallacy. We cannot ignore the 
possibility of bourgeois influences and must conduct a struggle against it: 
against penetration into the midst of Soviet people, and especially of the 
youth: of foreign views and tastes." 
The new educational program, in short: is designed to reduce the 
possibility of "bourgeois influences" by a tightly controlled work-study 
system.

SOVIET PRESS: THE VOICE OF THE PARTY 
Soviet literary works have occasionally deviated from the dictates 
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), but this is practi-
cally impossible in the case of the press and radio. The structural 
relation of these media to the party precludes ideological or policy 
lapses. 
The CPSU central committee's organs of publishing control comprise: 
(1) the Soviet news 'agency TASS, a state monopoly; (2) the Chief 
Administration for Literary and Publishing Affairs, known as Glavlit; 
and (3) the central committee's Section for Agitation and Propaganda, or 
Agitprop. 
All printed material in the USSR, with the exception of certain 
publications and newspapers directly under orders from the central commit-
tee, are supervised by Glavlit agents. Glavlit control and censorship cover 
every stage in publication. 
In addition to Glavlit's operations, the Soviet press at central, 
regional, and local levels is under the general supervision of Agitprop 
through its section on press and publications. As an administrative arm 
of the CPSU central committee, Agitprop is a keystone in the party struc-
ture, transmitting and directing the day-to-day execution of central commit-
tee policy and directives. 
Since Agitprop is concerned primarily with the political education 
of non-party workers, peasants, and intelligensia, and this objective is 
likewise the guiding principle of all media of communication, Soviet press 
and publications are subject to Agitprop guidance. (Lecture propaganda 
among the workers is directed by the Voluntary Society for the Dissemination 
of Political and Scientific Knowledge.) 
For external consumption, the propaganda flow from the CPSU central 
committee is transmitted through the committee's Foreign Section, which 
utilizes the distribution facilities of local Communist parties and Communist 
front organizations. Agitprop also provides material to local Communist 
parties on a mutual exchange basis. Outside the USSR, TASS gathers news 
of use to the central committee and transmits outgoing foreign and domestic 
news in accordance with central committee policy. 
Communists from the time of Lenin have considered the press a vital 
link in indoctrinating and controlling the masses. AB far back as 1901, 
Lenin said of the press under communism: "The role of a newspaper is not 
confined solely to the spreading of ideas, to political education, and to 
attracting political allies. A paper is not merely a collective propagandist 
and collective agitator; it is also a collective organizer."

Lenin also gave the Bolshevik answer to freedom of the press when he 
said of the Communist-run press: "The periodical and non-periodical press 
and all publishing enterprises must be entirely subordinated to the Central 
Committee of the (Communist) Party, irrespective of whether the Party as a 
whole is legal or illegal at the given moment." 
In similar vein, Stalin declared in 1939: "The press is the only im-
plement which helps the Party to speak daily, hourly, with the working class 
in its awn indispensable language." 
The Soviet press, and the Communist press in general, however, does not 
speak the language of the working class. On the contrary, it uses the 
formalistic idiom of Marxism-Leninism, screened through whatever party line 
is current in Moscow. 
Party chief Premier Nikita Khrushchev follows Marxist-Leninist precepts 
in regard to the press. As reported in the official central committee organ 
Kommunist, No. 12, 1957, he stated: 
"Just as an army cannot fight without weapons, so the Party cannot suc-
cessfully carry out its ideological work without such a sharp and militant 
weapon as the press. We cannot surrender the organs of the press to unre-
liable hands; they must be in the hands of the workers who are most faithful, 
most reliable, politically staunch and loyal to our cause." 
Inasmuch as this statement appeared after Khrushchev had achieved the 
downfall of his inner-party adversaries, the reference to loyality may be 
construed as loyalty to himself personally, as well as to the revamped 
central committee. Among those who felt the heavy hand of Khrushchev was 
Dmitri Shepilov, one-time editor of Pravda. 
Extraordinary measure are taken 
that of Moscow and the USSR regions, 
Communist press in the free world --
and the party's hour-by-hour view of 
to insure that the Communist press --
as well as the satellite press and the 
follows the broad lines of Soviet policy 
events. 
The Soviet censorship agency Glavlit censors every Soviet book, journal, 
film and radio broadcast; every lecture, exhibition and photograph. Theoret-
ically, newspapers are exempt from Glavlit censorship, because they come under 
the heading of "party publications." However, as Glavlit is designated the 
watchdog of all "state secrets" -- and information of almost every description 
is so classified -- Soviet newspapers in practice do not escape Glavlit's 
attention. 
Glavlit representatives are attached to all but the smallest newspaper 
staffs. The press departments of party committees, to which the papers --
both national and provincial -- are responsible, also exercise censorship. 
Finally, the CPSU central committee issues minutely detailed instructions to 
the press on a continuous basis.

SOVIET PRESS: THE VOICE OF THE PARTY - 51 - 
The Soviet press is organized to cover every level of readership and 
every occupational segment. No group, large or small, is without its appro-
priate newspaper or journal. 
In general, there are three types of newspapers and periodicals. The 
All-Union press consists of some 25 newspapers with nationwide circulation, 
chief of which is Pravda, organ of the central committee of the CPSU. 
Another important paper is Izvestia, the Government organ. Other All-
Union newspapers are issued by leading national organizations. Among these 
is Thud, organ of the All-Union Trade Union Council. Since the Trade Union 
Council takes its guidance from the CPSU central committee, Thud reflects 
the party line in all trade union matters. 
Reflecting diverse professional interests, but entirely subservient 
to the party are: Teachers' Gazette, published jointly by the Teachers' 
Union and the Ministry of Education; Red Star, the Army's paper, and Soviet 
Fleet, official Navy publication; the Youth League organ, Komsomolskaya 
Pravda, and others. 
Periodicals expressing the party viewpoint include Party Life, journal 
of the central committee, and Kommunist, the central committee's theoretical 
and political magazine; Problems of Philosophy, leading expression of Commu-
nist philosophy; Soviet Culture, Literary Gazette, New World, and Theater, 
representing various cultural phases of Soviet life. It is in the latter 
area that some "deviations" from the party line have appeared, resulting in 
the tightening of party control over the last two publications. 
Aside from the All-Union press, about 500 republic, regional and 
territorial papers have a combined circulation of more than 10 million. 
There are more than 4,000 city and district papers and several thousand 
factory and farm papers, of purely local interest. But even the most ephem-
eral of these little sheets is not immune to district party committee censor-
ship and control. 
The provincial press is directed by the central committees of the party 
in the constituent republics, autonomous areas, etc. At varying distances 
from Moscow, these regional papers carry a far greater proportion of reveal-
ing and critical comment on local conditions than is the case with Moscow 
Pravda. They are also more likely to voice the dissatisfaction of the non-
Russian inhabitants of their areas with some aspects of Communist life. 
Critical comments for the most part appear as Letters to the Editor, 
exposing the shortcomings among comrades and superiors in the collective 
farms, industrial plants, and the local bureaucracy. This form of criticism 
is officially encouraged as samokritika, or self-criticism, and it is 
designed to further efficiency or call attention to bureaucratic blunders. 
However, the correspondence is carefully screened, to insure that comments 
never overstep the party line.

All lines of Soviet news and broadcasting converge in the Telegraphic 
Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS), which gathers and distributes domestic 
news and also conducts news operations on a worldwide basis through a net-
work of offices in the free world. 
By a joint decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and 
the Council of Ministers in 1925 and 1935, TASS was given a monopoly of 
domestic and external Soviet news gathering and distribution. Officially, 
TASS is responsible to the Council of Ministers, but it directly reflects 
the central committee's line and policies. 
TASS is more than a news agency. It also works closely with Communist 
news media and parties outside of the Soviet bloc, and it services Communist 
newspapers in the free world gratis. TASS operations are intimately asso-
ciated with Soviet Intelligence abroad, and employees of TASS have been 
publicly identified as participants in several well-known espionage trials 
in free world countries, specifically, in Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, 
and Australia. 
In the case of the spy trial in Sweden, October-November 1951, TASS 
representative Viktor Anisimav was shown to be directly involved. The atti-
tude of the Swedish presa toward TASS was summed up by the Stockholm Morgan-
Tidningen on October 31, the day after the spy story broke. The paper 
commented: 
"We know from the Russian press and radio that news about Sweden dis-
patched by TASS is highly distorted and false. News not intended for 
publication -- i.e., spy reports -:- however, is both correct and detailed. 
TASS correspondents' real task thus does not appear to be the operation of 
a news service in the accepted sense, but to conduct propaganda against 
countries where they are stationed." 
TASS offices and correspondents are located in most of the major cities 
of western Europe, in a few Latin American cities, and in a wide belt ex-
tending from North Africa through the Middle East to the Far East. The 
emphasis placed by Moscow on propaganda and political penetration in the 
last-named region is reflected in the recent stepped-up activities of TASS, 
ranging from Cairo, Egypt, to Djakarta, Indonesia. 
Corresponding to TASS's activities in the press field are its radio 
tranamittals. From its home radio station in Moscow, TASS transmits short-
wave broadcasts in Morse code or Hellschreiber, a form of teletype. Voice 
stations. 
transmission is reserved for Radio Moscow and other Soviet broadcasting 
Since the impact of broadcasting is more immediate and compelling than 
that of the press, the broadcasts of TASS -- in the guise of news -- register 
the hour-by-hour propaganda line of Agitprop, hence of the CPSU central 
committee.

SOVIET PRESS: THE VOICE OF THE PARTY - 53 - 
The Soviet press and radio also have an important role in shaping 
public opinion in the USSR regarding drastic shifts in the upper hierarchy 
of the CPSU itself, or changes in the party line. Here, the technique 
varies from case to case. 
For example, when members of the "anti-party" group were ousted from 
their posts in July, 1957, supporting angles were added to the story by 
newspapers and broadcasts until it reached a crescendo several weeks later. 
The dismissal of Marshal Zhukov as Defense Minister, on the other hand, was 
cautiously disclosed and there was little comment in the Moscow papers 
until, a week later, the central committee released an itemized indictment 
of the Marshal. Then the final disposition of the ousted officer was 
obscured by the sensational publicity attending the launching of the Sputniks. 
During the periodic elections for deputies to the Supreme Soviet, 
Pravda invariably conducts a campaign of public "enlightenment" which re-
states the Marxist-Leninist dogmas about "capitalist democracy" versus 
"Communist democracy." Thus, in its issue of February 9, 1958, in prepa-
ration for the March 19 elections, Pravda issued an "Appeal of the Central 
Committee of the Soviet Communist Party to all Electors," which said, in 
part: 
"But can one really regard as democratic the States where the wolfish 
laws of capitalism operate, where the works and factories, railways and banks, 
land and its minerals, are in the hands of millionaires and milliardairs; 
where the fruits of the labor of hundred of millions of people are taken 
by a handful of predatory exploiters, while the masses of working people, the 
creators of all material benefits, are brutally exploited and are deprived 
right and left of the necessary conditions for human existence?" 
This is the orthodox Communist picture of the outside world -- espe-
cially of life in the United States -- which it is the mission of the Soviet 
press and radio and school system to implant in the minds of all citizens 
of the USSR. 
Again, the current foreign policy directives of the central committee 
are hammered home almost daily through the party-controlled press and radio. 
For example, Pravda on January 7, 1958, reiterated the call for setting up 
"united fronts" in free world countries, as a step toward Communist ascen-
dancy -- a theme that was sounded by Khrushchev in 1956 and was repeated in 
the "declaration" of Communist leaders in Moscow in November, 1957. Said 
IDUKTig: 
"Communists and Socialists can jointly strive for the unification of the 
working peasantry, craftsmen and intelligentsia around the working class. 
On the basis of setting up a workers' and peoples' united front...Communists 
and Socialists can obtain a majority in Parliament and transform it from a 
weapon of bourgeois dictatorship into a genuine instrument of popiOar power."

- 54 - Chapter Nine 
Needless to say, Pravda did not print the rejection of this proposal 
by the Fifth Socialist International, meeting in Vienna, July.19571 coupled 
with a scathing denunciation of the Moscow-backed Hungarian regime. On May 
2, 1958, Pravda again appealed for a Popular Front, citing the"growing economic 
crisis in the capitalist countries." 
This appeal was followed by letters from the CPSU central committee to 
the Socialist parties of Italy, France, Britain, West Germany, Norway, Denmark, 
the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria. At the same time, the Soviet press was 
loud in denouncing Social Democrats for "lapsing into Social Democratic 
Attitudes" -- which was termed one of the sins of "revisionism." 
In June 1958 came the shocking news of the execution of Hungarian leader 
Imre Nagy and three associates in the people's freedom rebellion. First 
revealed in the Moscow press, this cynical betrayal was lauded by Pravda in 
defiance of world opinion, including that of all Socialists. 
The great variety of ways in which Agitprop censors the domestic press 
and obstructs news facilities for foreign correspondents were discussed by 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs Andrew H. Berding in 
a speech of June 24, 1958. ' 
Among notable omissions of basic information about the USSR in the 
Soviet press, Berding listed: crime statistics and other social data, in-
cluding figures on patterns of income and consumption; wholesale and retail 
prices; agricultural procurement prices paid by the state; production figures 
in a wide range of items, from grain to non-ferrous metals and precious stones. 
There have been no meaningful statistics on the breakdown of the Soviet 
population by social groups and nationalities for 19 years. Civil disorders 
in 1953 in two forced labor camps and an outbreak at Tiflis in 1956 were not 
reported; nor have other symptoms of popular unrest appeared in print. 
Soviet propaganda repeatedly attacks nuclear tests by Western powers, 
but the Soviets in 1958 acknowledgedonly 12 such tests of their own, although 
many more than that number were conducted. The most recent and extensive 
test series -- completed just prior to their announced suspension of testing 
'-- was not formally published. No figures have been issued on fallout from 
Soviet testing, although it is known to .have been very heavy. 
Accurate information on Western political institutions, according to 
Berding, is not revealed, and in the international field, "accounts of 
United Nations proceedings are warped beyond recognition." One technique 
used in this connection by the Soviet press is to print in full a speech 
by a Soviet delegate to the UN, while suppressing all other speeches by 
UN representatives on the same subject. 
Berding stated that censorship of dispatches of American and other 
foreign correspondents stationed in Moscow is constant and extensive. This

SOVIET PRESS: THE VOICE OF THE PARTY - 55 - 
censorship, he said, is marked by two objectionable characteristics --
deletion of material and delay in transmitting outgoing cabled news. 
"As for recent delays," said Berding, "there was a 17-hour delay in 
clearing Khrushchev's remarks at the British Ehibassy on June 12, and then 
only with some omissions." Berding cited other instances involving 24- hour 
and 30-hour delays in transmission. 
Moscow's press censorship of foreign correspondents is by no means as 
rigorous or all-pervasive as it was in the days of Stalin; by contrast, it 
seems fairly liberal. However, censorship persists and operates in ways 
that are incomprehensible to foreign newsmen. The reasons are known only to 
the party censors in Agitprop. 
Foreign visitors to the USSR find that the average Soviet citizen --
with rare exceptions -- is not disposed to question the accuracy or validity 
of what he reads daily, whether in'the Moscow or provincial press, or in his 
awn trade paper. The Iron Curtain, which has been lifted to a considerable 
degree as regards travel within the USSR, still tightly encloses the millions 
of readers of the party-controlled press and publications. 
This is also true of news broadcasts from outside the USSR. For example, 
the heaviest Soviet jamming of foreign radio transmissions occurred in August 
1958, when the entire debate of the UN General Assembly on the Middle East 
situation .was broadcast. Radio jamming, that is, the use of noise-producing 
devices on numerous radio frequencies, is practiced constantly by the USSR.

PROPAGANDA AIMS AND METHODS 
The current outpouring of Communist propaganda --especially of prop-
aganda originating directly or indirectly in the USSR -- raises questions 
regarding the purpose and credibility of this vast output. 
Political analysts have conceded that Moscow's worldwide exploitation 
of many subjects, such as the launching of the Sputniks, serves legitimate 
aims comparable to those of other governments. The achievements of Soviet 
scientists, for example, have been applauded everywhere. But there are 
areas of Soviet propaganda and uses to which it is put, which differ mark-
edly from those of the news, information and propaganda media from free-
world sources. 
The basic difference between Communist propaganda and that of non-
Communist agencies and governments lies in differing principles of gov-
ernment, social standards, and the ethics of mass communication. 
If much of Soviet propaganda material is demonstrably false or shows 
glaring omission of fact, that circumstance does not in itself disturb its 
purveyors. Neitherwas the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) con-
cerned over the 1958 execution of the leaders of the Hungarian people's 
rebellion, on orders from Moscow. Soviet Party leaders, in fact, are in-
dignant that world opinion should be outraged by this cynical betrayal. 
For a member of the CPSU to question the rightness of such an action 
would be a question of "Communist morality." V. I. Lenin, founder of 
modern communism, once stated: "At the foundation of Communist morality 
lies the struggle for the strengthening and perfecting of communism." 
That is, any action or statement is morally right if it serves Communist 
ends. 
Whether based on fact, fiction, or half-truths, propaganda is a normal 
expression of social, political, and governmental life. It has other uses 
indicated by the dictionary definition: "Any organized or concerted group 
efforts or movement to spread a particular doctrine or system or principles." 
In the latter sense, propaganda has been the life-blood of the Com-
munist movement from the beginning. It is still a major function of the 
CPSU, and of the party's vast ramification of agencies and subsidiaries 
within the Communist bloc and in the free world. 
In the Soviet Union -- even more than was the case in Nazi Germany --
official propaganda is on a par with diplomacy, the armed services and the 
secret police. It is a fundamental element of Soviet diplomacy, and Mos-
cow's foreign policies cannot be disassociated from CPSU propaganda.

PROPAGANDA. AIMS AND METHODS - 57 - 
Propaganda is the main weapon used by all Communist regimes against 
non-Communist governments and peoples; internally, it is a principal means 
of fortifying the regime and promoting the objectives of the ruling Com-
munist Party. 
Mao Tse-tung, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, gave an expla-
nation of Communist propaganda which applies equally to all other countries 
under Communist control. Speaking of domestic propaganda, he said: 
"What is a propagandist? Not only is the teacher a propagandist, the 
newspaper reporter a propagandist, the literary writer a propagandist, but 
all our (party) cadres in all kinds of work are also propagandists...Anyone 
engaged in talking with another person is engaged in propaganda work." 
The specific doctrine or system of principles furthered by CPSU prop-
aganda and that of all other Communist parties is Marxism-Leninism. But 
in practice, there is less reference to the founders of communism than to 
such easily understood slogans and catchwords as "peaceful coexistence," 
"increased labor productivity," "upsurge of agriculture," "anti-colonialism," 
and the like. 
Lenin himself appreciated the practical advantages of slogans in 
spreading bolshevism. In 1917, his Bolshevik Party did not propagate the 
dictum of the Communist Manifesto: "Workers of the world, unite!" Instead, 
he coined new slogans with immediate appeal: "All power to the soviets 
(workers' councils)!" and "Bread, peace, and freedom!" 
Reporting to the 9th Congress of the CPSU in March 1920, Lenin de-
clared: "It was only because of the Party's vigilance and its strict dis-
cipline...because the slogans issued by the Central Committee were taken 
up by millions of people like one man, that the miracle could take place 
which actually did take place. It was only because of that, we were able 
to win." 
This statement itself 'is misleading propaganda. Lenin's minority 
Bolsheviks won because on January 18, 1918, Lenin ordered armed sailors 
from the Kronstadt Naval Base to disperse the freely elected All-Russian 
Constituent Assembly in which the Bolsheviks commanded only 25 per cent of 
the votes. 
The systematic falsification of the CPSU's own history, as well as the 
misrepresentation of current events to suit the party's version of them, 
reached the height of organized deception under Stalin and has been con-
tinued by his successors. 
Soviet propaganda is closely associated with Communist semantics, which 
give slanted meanings to such terms as "democratic," "peace-loving," "pro-
gressive," and the like. Institutions and regimes approved by the Com-

munists are tagged with euphemisms such as "people's democracies," "peo-
ple's diplomacy," and so forth. Opposing ideas and institutions are 
characterized as "bourgeois reactionary," "aggressive circles," "imperi-
alists," etc. 
A whole category of invectives is reserved for dissidents within the 
party: "dogmatists," "revisionists," "deviationists," "anti-party," etc., 
especially after the victorious faction in one of the recurring intra-party 
struggles has ousted or eliminated its rivals. 
A semantic gilding is also applied to international pro-Communist front 
organizations, and to Communist-inspired international conferences, meetings, 
and assemblages. A multitude of "peace" and "friendship" societies and or-
ganizations echo Scviet propaganda and repeat Moscow's diatribes against 
"warmongers" -- that is, all those who refuse to accept a Communist-dic-
tated peace. 
In the complex of propaganda agencies and outlets, the Central Com-
mittee's Section for Agitation and Propaganda, known as Agitprop, is the 
principal instrument for disseminating domestic propaganda. The Foreign 
Section of the Central Committee directs propaganda outside the USSR, 
utilizing local Communist parties and front organizations. Agitprop pro-
vides material to these parties on an exchange basis. 
Soviet economic plans have long been the subject of sustained domestic 
propaganda, embodied in such slogans as "fulfillment and overfulfillment 
of the Plan," "socialist emulation," and so forth. (See Chapter Five). 
Thus, Xhrushchev in addressing the 21st Congress of the CPSU on Jan-
uary 27, 1952, declared: "When fulfilled, the Seven Year Plan will so 
greatly increase the economic potential of the USSR that it will, together 
with the growth of the economic potential of all the Socialist countries, 
give peace a decisive edge." 
At another point Khrushchev said: "This new balance of (economic) 
forces will be so patently evident that even the most die-hard imperialists 
will clearly see the futility of any attempt to start a war against the 
Socialist camp." 
The propaganda themes stressed in these statements repeat the claim 
for Communist economic superiority and at the same time reitceate the Lenin-
Stalin formula that "imperialists" threaten Communist states and start wars-. 
a favorite axiom of the international Communist front organizations, es- . 
pecially the World Peace Council.

PROPAGANDA AIMS AND METHODS - 59 - 
The distinction between Communist propagandists and agitators was 
first set forth by Lenin in 1902. He said that a propagandist- should ex-
plain events, such as the "inevitable transformation of capitalist society 
into Socialist (Communist) society," according to the Marxist formula and 
thus present "many ideas." An agitator, on the other hand, should "direct 
all his efforts to presenting a single idea to the masses." The "single 
idea," for example, may mean agitating for a strike or other local distur-
bance, without introducing any Marxist terminology whatever. 
"Consequently," Lenin added, "the propagandist operates chiefly by 
means of the printed word; the agitator operates with the spoken word." 
This distinction, though made before the invention of radio, now a 
principal medium of propaganda, to some extent is still maintained in 
Communist activities. On a large scale, the downfall of the Republic of 
Czechoslovakia was the result both of intensive and prolonged anti-govern-
ment propaganda prior to February 1948, and of mass mobilization on Feb-
ruary 24 of street mobs, led by Communist agitators, which threatened the 
Government of President Benes. 
Of primary importance to CPSU propaganda objectives is the former All-
Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries (VOKS). VOKS 
was reorganized in February 1958 as the Union of Soviet Societies for 
Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. The VOKS publi-
cations, Culture and Life, was taken over by its successor. 
On April 21, 1958, an affiliate of the above-named organization was 
set up at a meeting in Moscow, accompanied by a fanfare of publicity. 
This is the Soviet Society of Friendship and Cultural Ties with Countries 
of the Arab East. The establishment of this organization underscores a 
key Soviet propaganda objective -- the campaign to link the USSR and its 
policies with the Arab nations. 
The successor organization to VOKS performs substantially the same 
functions as those of VOKS. As one of the political arms, and hence of 
the CPSU central committee, VOKS was responsible for all Soviet cultural 
exchange matters and relations with the innumerable "friendship" groups 
throughout the world. 
VOKS also arranged for overseas tours by Soviet groups such as 
musicians dancers, and theatrical troupes. Its cultural advisers helped 
select films, art and literary works and other exhibits sent out of the 
USSR. 
Agitprop's connection with publishing, which extends indirectly to 
satellite publishing, accounts for the huge output of propagandas material 
in the form of books, pamphlets, periodicals, etc., distributed in many 
parts of the free world. (Several Soviet publications are under the ad-
ministrative control of the Minis try of Culture).

- 60 - Chapter Ten 
The CPSU central committee's Agitprop conducts an unceasing domestic 
campaign directed toward Soviet citizens en masse and also toward every 
labor, professional and cultural group individually. 
Agitprop's field staff has almost 400,000 full-time agitators, organi-
zers, lecturers, and so forth. It supervises the output of the press and 
guides the contents of all specialized publications along party lines. Also, 
lower-level party members can be called upon to help in propaganda work. 
The.domestic censorship exercised over the Soviet press and radio by 
Agitprop and Glavlit operates in two principal ways. Nothing unfavorable 
to the Soviet Government or the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) 
ever appears in the press or is heard over the radio. At the same time, 
all actions taken by the government and the party are presented in terms of 
irrefutable "rightness," and all official comments and statements are as-
sumed to be matters of "undeniable fact." 
As a result, the great mass of Soviet citizens have no means of under-
standing or judging events that take place outside of the Communist bloc, 
or even within the bloc itself. The people of the USSR are kept in ignorance 
of many elemental circumstances in regard to their own government and the 
ruling Communist party. 
A further use to which Soviet propaganda facilities are devoted is to 
publicize the particular leader or faction in the CPSU central committee 
in control of the party machine. 
Stalin in his rise to absolute power made full use of the Soviet do-
mestic propaganda agencies that were finally merged in Agitprop. Thus, in 
his life-time, Stalin already was a semi-mythical figure created through 
the ceaseless propaganda of the press, radio, films, and even arts and 
sciences. The "cult of personality," which Stalin exemplified and party 
leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced in his famous "secret" speech at the 
20th Party Congress, is an inevitable outgrowth of the Communist system of 
"democratic centralism" introduced by Lenin. 
Khrushchev himself, in his climb to the position of "first among 
equals," assumed control of the Agitprop administration when he took over 
the party machine in 1957. 
The three-way relation of CPSU propaganda -- to Soviet foreign policy, 
Communist front activities, and the promotion of Communist Party objectives 
in the free world -- is illustrated in. the ease of two leading propaganda 
themes, "peace" and "solidarity." 
The theme of "peacful coexistence," with variations, is being promoted 
by Soviet propaganda agencies and affiliates on a worldwide scale. The 
"solidarity" idea, on the other hand, is limited to the region extending 
from Africa to the Far East. CPSU attempts to enlist the Socialist parties 
of Western Europe in Moscow's "solidarity" drive have proved unavailing. 
PROPAGANDA AIMS AND METHODS - 61 - 
. The theme of Communist-style "peace" has been stressed by Soviet 
leaders ever since the Bolshevik Revolution, but the start of the present 
peace offensive by Moscow dates to Autust 1948, when the first Soviet-backed 
"peace" organization -- the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace -- met 
at Wroclaw, Poland. 
In April 1949, the Communist-run Partisans for Peace established a 
World Peace Council in Paris, which was and is under tight Communist con-
trol. The Council has sponsored a series of world peace congresses from 
year to year and is the parent body of innumerable national and local "peace" 
groups and organizations. 
The formation of a "peace" network under CPSU auspices came immediately 
after the Soviets' aggressive expansion had brought some 90 million people 
of Eastern Europe under Moscow's domination. 
The period when the peace movement was being actively pushed also 
coincided with the most belligerent action taken by the USSR in the post-
war period -- the Soviet blockade of Western Berlin, June 1948 through May 
1949, which was balked by the United States airlift. 
A notable peace hoax was the so-called Stockholm Peace Petition 
sponsored by Soviet representatives at a World Congress of Partisans of 
Peace, in Stockholm, March 1950. This appeal gained millions of signatures 
from those who mistakenly believed it to be a genuine bid for peace. The 
Stockholm Appeal was still being circulated in June 1950, when the Moscow-
supported North Korean Communist regime launched an invasion of the Repub-
lic of Korea. ? ? 
While Soviet propagandists have trumpeted their own "peace" proposals--
echoed by Communist parties and Communist front organizations throughout 
the world -- Moscow for years has blocked United Nations efforts to further 
disarmament by means of an effective international inspection plan. 
On May 2, 1958, the Soviet representative in the UN Security Council 
cast the 83rd Soviet veto -- this one against the United States proposal for 
an international patrol of the Arctic region to prevent a surprise attack 
being launched by any power, across the Arctic Circle. 
Khrushchev in a speech on March 14, 1958, called on world opinion to 
support the Soviet stand on peace. He reiterated the familiar "peace" prop-
aganda line of the CPSU and implied that Moscow would resort to a propaganda 
technique set forth at the 20th Party Congress in 1956 -- the use of "peo-
ple's diplomacy" to exert pressure on governments for Soviet political ends. 
This was preliminary to the summoning of another Stockholm conference by the 
World Peace Council.

The Council's Bureau and Secretariat met in New Delhi, March 22 through 
25, 1958 and drafted a call to all the Communist front organizations, 
preparatory to enlisting their active support at a Congress for Disarmament 
and International Cooperation, scheduled to be held in Stockholm from July 
16 to 22. 
The proclamation issued by the Peace Council members at New Delhi said, 
in part: 
"In a world made up of states with different social and political sys-
tems, the peoples must seek roads that lead to harmonious ways of living and 
working in peace together." 
No one would challenge such a conclusion; however, the World Peace 
Council itself condoned the Communist aggression in Korea in 1950 and was 
silent on the heavy deliveries of Soviet bloc military arms to the Middle 
East, beginning in 1955, which still continue. Further, the Council did not 
condom Soviet military intervention in Hungary in November 1956. 
The technique of "people's diplomacy," in combination with the current 
"anti-colonialist" professions of Moscow, reached a peak at the Afro-Asian 
Solidarity Conference in Cairo, December 26, 1957, to January 1, 1958. 
The Cairo conference was represented in advance publicity as a meeting 
of "people's representatives," designed to carry on the "Bandung spirit." 
Both propaganda tags were misleading. The delegates at Cairo did not in 
fact represent the people of the countries from which they came. They had 
no official standing and consisted for the most part of officials from Com-
munist bloc countries, self-appointed fellow travelers, groups that were 
hand-picked by Communist front "solidarity committees," or persons known 
for their opposition to their own governments. 
The Bandung Conference of 1955, on the contrary, was a meeting of high 
government officials who were free to express the views of their governments. 
At Cairo, any conferees who took a stand against the pro-Moscow majority were 
effectively gagged. Under the circumstances, several independent groups and 
individuals withdrew from the conference. 
As a result of Communist tactics, the speeches at the conference and 
the final resolutions reflected little more than propaganda themes repeat-
edly voiced by Moscow, tied to Arab nationalism. 
The massive 1958 Soviet propaganda offensive Carle in part from the 
effort of the CPSU to overcome the party's serious loss of prestige and 
influence in Communist parties outside the bloc, due to Soviet interven-
tion in Hungary.

Another form of Soviet propaganda is illustrated by Moscow's heated 
controversy with the Yugoslav Communist Party, which began in the spring 
of 1958. In this instance, the Yugoslav Communists were accused of "re-
visionism" -- a term of opprobrium used by Agitprop media to describe Com-
munists who refuse to accept the dictates of the CPSU. 
In some respects, Communist propaganda has advantages over that dis-
seminated by non-Communist governments or agencies. The first is that the 
Communists have -- and seem to need to have -- no regard whatever for the 
truth. They can say one thing in one part of the world and something 180 
degrees opposite in another part of the world at the same time. The truth 
is no obstacle in Soviet propaganda. 
The technique used by Soviet propaganda sudsidiaries in free-world 
countries is illustrated by the case of the Communist-controlled tabloid 
Blitz, published in India. 
This paper regularly publishes articles purporting to be based on 
"facts" which actually are either pure fabrications or else distortions of 
the truth. Such material not infrequently is picked up by Radio Peiping and 
Radio Moscow and broadcast as "indisputable facts." 
The identification of Soviet foreign policy with Soviet propaganda was 
evident at the time when the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) was 
established in 1947. Planned and organized by Andrei Zhadanov, the Comin-
form had a small membership, composed of representatives of nine Communist 
parties -- those of the USSR, five satellites, Yugoslavia, France and Italy. 
From the start, the CPSU dominated Cominform proceedings, but the re-
fusal of the Yugoslav Communist Party to yield to Soviet dictation in re-
spect to the country's internal policies led to a split in 1948. The Yu-
goslav Communists were expelled from the Cominform, amid volleys of recrim-
ination which find echoes today in the current exchanges between Belgrade 
and the Sino-Soviet bloc. 
The official organ of the Cominform was the weekly newspaper For a 
Lasting Peace, for a People's Democracy, which set the theoretical and 
propaganda line for Communist parties everywhere. The paper suspended 
publication in April 1956, when the Cominform was dissolved. 
Moscow's subsequent efforts to revive a Cominform-type world organi-
zation were not entirely successful, but general agreement was reached by 
Communist party leaders assembled in Moscow in November, 1957, to establish 
a modified version of the earlier organization.

The Communists in Moscow issued a 12-party declaration (not signed by 
the Yugoslavas) and a "peace manifesto" adhered to by representatives of 65 
Communist parties. A communique stressed the primacy of the CPSU and re-
peated current Agitprop propaganda themes. The gathering also discussed 
publication of a new periodical for worldwide consumption by Communist 
parties. 
As a sequel to the oscow meeting, representatives of certain Com-
munist parties at the end of August 1958 launched a monthly titled 
Problems of Peace and Socialism. The English-language edition is called 
World. Marxist Review. The editorial office is in Prague, Czechoslovakia. 
The new periodical, like the earlier one, reflects Soviet propaganda 
formulas regarding the world situation from the CPSU standpoint. The edi-
torial in the first issue, for example, stated that "revisionism is the 
main danger to the Communist movement in present-day conditions."

SOVIET CULTURE AND "PARTY SPIRIT" 
Prior to the Bolshevik Revolution, Russia had an illustrious tradition 
in literature, drama, ballet and other cultural and art forms. This whole 
structure, with the exception of ballet, music and the theater, crumbled 
under the impact of the 1917 revolution. Some literary forms managed to 
survive for a time without interference from the new Communist bureau-
crats. Distinguished writers such as Sholokhov and Zoschenko maintained 
their literary integrity in the face of increasing regimentation. 
Lenin, who laid the foundation of a single-party political system in 
the USSR, also was mainly responsible for the cultural totalitarianism that 
characterizes all Communist regimes. His ideas on the subject were formed 
long before the revolution. In a brochure, "The Party Organization and 
Party Literature" (1905), he outlined the principle of partiinost ("party 
spirit") as the determining factor in all Communist cultural expression. 
He wrote: 
"The principle of party literature consists in the fact that not only 
may literature not be an instrument of gain for individuals or groups, but 
also in that it may not be an individual matter at all...Literature must 
become a component part of organized, planned, unified Social Democratic 
Party work." (At that time, the Bolsheviks were a minority dissident fac-
tion of the Russian Social Democratic Party.) 
With the rise of Stalin to a dominant position in the party and state, 
Soviet cultural and creative activities were brought more and more under 
the control of the CPSU. In 1932, the CPSU central committee dissolved all 
independent literary and artistic organizations and created in their place 
a series of unions for each of the cultural fields which, like the industri-
al trade unions, represent the party machine. One of these is the Union of 
Writers. 
As supreme cultural arbiter, Stalin made use of the censorship organi-
zations Glavlit and Agitprop set up inorderto supervise press and publi-
cations. Glavlit gradually assumed censorship functions over all cultural 
and creative works. 
The 18th Congress of the CPSU (1933) laid down a new set of party rules 
and provided for the establishment of the Section for Agitation and Propa-
ganda (Agitprop) as an arm of the CPSU central committee, with authority 
over domestic cultural outlets and activities.

66 Chapter Eleven 
Meanwhile, Glavlit continues as the party's watchdog, policing cul-
tural fields in the interest of party unity and discipline. Soviet books, 
pamphlets, brochures, etc., bear the imprimatur of Glavlit -- "passed for 
publication." 
Since 1939, Agitprop, in conjunction with other propaganda and censor-
ship organs, has left its imprint on fine arts, films, belles-lettres, his-
torical works, music, theater, etc. (See footnote.) This development can 
be attributed in large part to Andrei Zhdanov who, in 1939, became a full-
fledged Politburo member and for the next nine years held the ear of Stalin 
in cultural matters. 
Zhdanov waa an ambitious party zealot with considerable military ex-
perience who, at the peak of his political career, was placed in charge of 
the Soviet-occupied Baltic States. In addition to his political activities, 
he fancied himself a connoisseur of arts and letters. In 1934 he was the 
principal speaker at the All-Russian Congress of Soviet Writers and, five 
years later, he keynoted the meeting of the 18th Party Congress. 
From his elevation in the party's innermost circle, Zhdanov proceeded 
to dictate the terms for all cultural expression in the USSR. World War II 
interrupted party emphasis on this subject, but by 1946 the Zhdanov tenets 
gained wide acceptance. His pronouncements on culture from 1946 to 1948 
(the year he died) set the pattern for subsequent party directives in this 
field. The Zhdanov viewpoint is still accepted by the party's cultural 
functionaries. 
Zhdanov, who counted piano-playing as one of his minor accomplishments, 
lashed out at the composers of his day. In February 1948 he steered a re-
solution through the central committee which rebuked the most eminent of 
the Soviet composers -- Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Aram Khacha-
turrian, V. Y. Shebalin, Gabriel Popov, Nikolai Miaskovsky, and others. The 
central committee accused these musicians of a "formalist trend" and con-
cluded: "This music reeks strongly of the spirit of contemporary modern bour-
geois culture, the full denial of musical art." 
A few of the so-called "independent" organizations also have responsibility 
for propaganda in certain fields. For example, until March 1957, the Ministry 
of Culture was responsible for lecture propaganda among the workers. In March, 
the CPSU central committee transferred this function to the "voluntary" All-
Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge. 
Regardless of organs or officials given detailed responsibility for cultural 
aspects of Soviet life, policy in these fields is set by the CPSU central 
committee and, in turn, is subject to the guidance of the party's indisputable 
leader. Lenin was concerned with party cultural formulas only in a generalized 
way; Stalin was more specific about certain subjects, and Khrushchev has made 
pronouncements on almost every phase of cultural activity.

SOVIET CULTURE AND "PARTY SPIRIT" - 67 - 
(On June 8, 1958, the CPSU central committee accused Malenkov and 
Molotov -- together with executed secret police chief Beria -- of having 
had an "extremely negative influence" over Soviet music. An official cen-
tral committee decree of May 28 denounced the trio for criticizing the 
famous composers who, in fact, were the victims of Zhdanov's persecution, 
not of the ousted party leaders mentioned.) 
The attack on the composers in 1948 had no serious lasting effects 
but the party's dogmatic literary criteria, imposed on writers, critics, 
and teachers, placed Soviet literature in an ideological straightjacket 
for almost a decade. Zhdanov was also responsible for the central com-
mittee's editorial purge of the cultural journals, Zvezda and Leningrad 
in 1946, and the ensuing regimentation of writers and critics. 
Soviet authors henceforth were restricted to such themes as five year 
plans, factory output, collective farm goals, and the standard "anti-capi-
talist" approach. The element of romance shriveled to "boy-meets-girl-meets 
tractor" dimensions. Whether or not the concept of "socialist realism" ori-
ginated with Zhdanov, the phrase came into wide circulation in his day and 
has been a cultural slogan of the party ever since. 
The party journal Bolshevik in an article of May, 1948, defined "social-
ist realism" as follows: "Socialist realism, relying on the traditions of 
classical realism, establishes as the basis of artistic creation not the 
subjective, arbitrary ideas of the writer, but his detection of objective 
reality...In their work, Soviet writers are guided by the policy of the 
Bolshevik (Communist) Party and the Soviet state." 
An article in Culture and Life, March 11, 1947, proclaimed: "Only that 
artist is free who is versed in the laws of the historical development of 
society and who with all his heart is devoted to his people, to the Commun-
ist Party, and to the Socialist (Communist) society." 
Georgi Malenkov, a party rival of Zhdanov, had much to say about the 
aims of Soviet cultural workers. In December 1947 he told a Cominform meet-
ing in Poland: 
"In the Communist education of the people...the central committee of the 
CPSU stresses that Soviet writers, artists, and cultural workers can have no 
other interests save the interests of the people and the state." 
Five years later, however, at the 19th Party Congress (October 1952) 
principle speaker Malenkov complained that the "ideological and artistic 
level of many works is still not high enough." 
Malenkov continued: "Many mediocre and dull works, and simply pot-
boilers which distort Soviet reality, still crop up in literature and art."

erary expression -- Malenkov called for new "Soviet Gogols and Shchedrins 
whose scorching satire would burn out all that is negative, decaying and 
moribund, everything that acts as a brake on our march onward." 
The answer to this, which subsequent discussions failed to bring out, 
was the fact that a true post-revolutionary satirist and "realist" --
Zeshchenko ("The Adventures of an Ape") -- suffered disgrace at the hands 
of the Zhdanovists in 1946. There was no guarantee that writers who ven-
tured to escape from party stereotypes would not meet a similar fate. 
The dead hand of partiinost was felt in the story line of plays and 
motion pictures. By 1952, even the party censors could not fail to notice 
that empty theaters demonstrated that the "Soviet man," far from being 
edified by themes illustrating Communist "morality" and "socialist realism," 
was merely bored. Not until recently have Soviet filns ventured to portray 
characters and situations of greater human interest, such as those in "The 
Forty-first, ""Occurrencein Shaft No. 8," "The Flying Aces," and others. 
Party limitations imposed on Soviet cultural arts and belles-lettres 
became a subject of protracted discussions in Pravda and the literary 
journals in 1953. A novel that touched off a heated debate was "The Thaw," 
by Ilya Ehrenburg, who had long been a party conformist in his speeches ? 
and writings. "The Thaw" was by no means "anti-party," but it treated 
themes and characters in a manner not set forth in party directives and its 
author was rebuked at the second Writers' Congress in December 1954. 
Ehrenburg, however, was too valuable as party propagandist to be per-
manently discredited, and he shortly resumed his activities as Moscow's 
cultural and "peace" emissary abroad. 
The resentment of some literary critics toward Glavlit censorship was 
expressed by V. Pomerantsev in a trenchant essay that appeared in the De-
cember 1953 issue of Novy Mir (New World). Pomerantsev offered the opinion 
that the great bulk of Soviet postwar literature was not only "untrue to 
life" but "insincere." The article indirectly appealed for literary freedom 
and condemned, without mentioning, the concept of partiinost. A series of 
letters which endorsed the article was published by Komsomolskaya Pravda, 
organ of the youth organization, early in 1954. 
Another critic, Mark Shcheglov, also attacked the party approach to 
literature in reviewing Leonid Leonov's novel, "Russian Forest." The 
Leonov work, produced while Stalin was alive, deals with characters who 
thrive under a Communist regime. 
Another break with "socialist realism" was registered in a play by 
L. Zorin, titled "The Guests," which was performed in 1953 and published in 
Theater magazine in February 1954. Based on the notorious "Doctors' Plot," 
the play indicated to what extremes Soviet bureaucrats go in their struggle 
for power. 
SOVIET CULTURE AND "PARTY SPIRIT" 
-69-
As a result of these literary innovations, the three writers were for-
mally censured by the party-line Union of Writers. Also, Novy Mir hastened 
to apologize for printing the Pomerantsev contributions; its editor, poet 
Alexander Tvardoysky, was replaced by Konstantin Simonov, whb himself was 
removed in July 1958. Tvardovsky was restored to his former editorial posi-
tion, and Simonov regained his party standing after making perfunctory amends. 
The temporary eclipse of Simonov resulted from Novy Mir's endorsement of 
a new play by Valentin Ovechkin, "Facing the land," which "deviated" from tie 
party line in regard to Soviet agricultural policies. 
Between the second Writers' Congress of December 1954 and the outbreak 
of the Hungarian freedom rebellion in October 1956, the balance of influence 
between the party formalists and the dissident writers shifted by degrees in 
favor of the latter. A landmark of this movement was the long controversial 
novel, "Not by Bread Alone," by noted author Vladimir Dudintsev, which was 
serialized in the August, September and October ssues of Navy Mir and im-
mediately became a literary sensation among university students and some mem-
bers of the new intelligentsia. The theme of the book is the struggle of an 
engineer against bureaucratic obstacles. 
In general, the novel would seem to fall in the category of self-criti-
cism (see Glossary) and might therefore have been considered permissible. 
But since the story offers a grim picture of the subjection of the individual 
to the party bureaucracy, author and book became the targets of party spokes-
men and of party chief Khrushchev. 
At a reception for writers, artists, sculptors and composers in May 1957, 
Khrushchev laid down the party line on cultural matters. Khrushchev continued 
to expound his cultural theories, which were issued on August 28, 1957, under 
the title "For Closer Links of Literature and Art with the Life of People." 
He was quoted in the August issue of Kommunist as demanding that writers 
follow implicitly the principles of socialist realism. 
Khrushchev singled out Dudintsev's novel and said that its "general 
direction is fundamentally false." He said further: 
"One can only regret that certain literary and artistic magazines and 
publishing houses did not observe this unhealthy and harmful tendency and did 
not correctly analyze and rebuff it in time. The editors of Novy Mir put 
their magazine at the disposal of works such as Dudintsev's book." 
During the year,following Khrushchev's literary pronouncements, the CPSU 
and its organs exerted mounting pressure to insure conformity to the precepts 
of socialist realism in writing, films, theater, ballet, and other cultural 
media.

- 70 - Chapter Eleven 
Soon after the Khrushchev document was issued, the editor of Novy Mir 
was dismissed and the editorial board repudiated the magazine's previous 
stand on literature and criticism. In October 1957, the Literary Gazette  
published a series of articles attacking noncomformist writers and Soviet  
Culture assailed Theater magazine for its "deviations." 
The October 19 issue of Soviet Culture censured the artists Glazunov 
and Chlenov for not following the canons of socialist realism in their 
paintings. 
Literary Gazette also published the "confession" of poetess Margarita 
Aliger, who had strayed from the party line in her poetry. She said, in part: 
"I should follow the teachings and appeals of Comrade Khrushchev's speeches. 
I think that I will be able fully to explain the profound conclusions which 
I have drawn for my future only by working wholeheartedly, by remembering al-
ways that the main task of a Soviet writer is political work, and that it can 
only be performed honorably by following unwaveringly the Party line and Party 
discipline." 
Despite the surrender of some noncomformist writers to party discipline, 
others remained silent and offered no further writings for publication. 
The output of unorthodox writers had found acceptance by the group of 
university students who published the Young Guard, a magazine with a circu-
lation of 75,000 copies. Unable to curb these student tendencies, the Writers' 
Union took drastic action. In January 1958, the editorial staff of the peri-
odical was reorganized and the editor was removed on the grounds that the 
magazine had not kept to its main task -- the "Communist education of youth." 
Party control of other forms of cultural expression was illustrated by 
an article in Theater, February 1958, which dealt with an order issued by the 
Ministry of Culture on "measures for the further development of the art of the 
Soviet ballet." The Ministry complained that "ballets having for their sub-
ject the life of the Soviet people appear extremely rarely on the stage of our 
biggest theaters." Ballet composers and producers were orde;:ed to provide 
annually for not less than one new production in the mode of socialist realism. 
The motion picture field also came under scrutiny, according to Pravda 
of April 6, 1958. The CPSU central committee told a conference of film 
industry workers that their main task was to insure "profound loyalty to the 
ideologies and esthetic principles of socialist realism." 
The CPSU central committee's viewpoint -- that writers should devote 
themselves to contemporary themes and that socialist realism requires that 
they adapt their literary work to current party objectives -- was indirectly 
challenged by Mikail Sholokhov, author of the well-known novel, "And Quiet 
Flows the Don." 
SOVIET CULTURE AND "PARTY SPIRIT" 
- 71 
Sholokhov, according to an interview published in the May 1958 issue of 
the journal of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union, expressed the opinion that a 
writer should follow his conscience in creative work and resist the pressure 
of party critics. 
During the spring and summer of 1958, CPSU cultural spokesmen and offi-
cial organs continued to assail cultural revisionism (see Glossary), both in 
the USSR and in some areas of Eastern Europe. 
Party emphasis on the errors of noncomformist writings was motivated in 
part by the growing popularity, outside of the Soviet bloc countries, of 
Boris Pasternak's novel of life in pre-revolutionary and revolutionary 
Russia, "Doctor Zhivago." 
The manuscript of "Doctor Zhivago," Pasternak's only novel -- his repu-
tation was based on his poetry and translations of classical drama -- was 
sent in 1956 to an Italian publisher after it had been denied publication in 
the USSR. Between that date and December 1957, when it appeared in an 
Italian edition, Soviet officials tried unsuccessfully to regain possession 
of the manuscript on the grounds that it was "hostile to the October Revo-
lution." 
After the book was published in Italy, it was issued in English and other 
languages and soon reached best-seller lists abroad. On October 23, 1958, the 
Royal Swedish Academy announced that Pasternak had won the Nobel Prize for 
Literature "for his important achievements both in contemporary lyric poetry 
and in the field of the great Russian epic tradition." 
On October 24, the Moscow Literary Gazette lashed out against the award 
as a "hostile political act" directed against the Soviet state and charged 
Pasternak with choosing the "path of shame and dishonor." There followed a 
concerted campaign against the author, conducted by the official press and 
party spokesmen, and on October 29 the Soviet Writers' Union announced the 
expulsion of Pasternak and the withdrawal of his appellation "Soviet writer." 
It was also suggested that he be exiled from the USSR. 
As official reactions gathered momentum, Pasternak on October 29 wired 
his refusal of the prize "because of the meaning attributed to the award in 
the society in which I live." When he learned of the exile proposal, he 
sent a personal plea to Khrushchev, protesting that such an extreme measure 
would be "equivalent to death." 
Although the CPSU reaffirmed its cultural position in this instance, 
worldwide repercussions against the Soviet treatment of Pasternak damaged 
the party's cultural standing abroad. According to reports, the banning of 
the book in the USSR stimulated interest in it among many Soviet students 
seeking to read and judge it for themselves.

Chapter Eleven 
In the six months following the Pasternak affair, the CPSU was intent 
on overcoming the effects of the book within the USSR and regaining the in-
itiative as regards the canons of socialist realism, which have been chal-
lenged in Poland and Yugoslavia. (Yugoslavia is not a Soviet bloc member.) 
In Hungary, the Writers' Union was abolished by the regime in April 1957, 
but dissident writers refuse to bow to party dictates. 
The campaign to reaffirm and strengthen cultural orthodoxy gathered 
headway after the 21st Congress of the CPSU early in 1959. In the first five 
months of 1959, writers' conferences were held in the Soviet republics of 
Byelorussia, Armenia, Georgia, Lithuania, Turkmenia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, 
and the Ukraine. This series of meetings reached a climax in the Third Con-
gress of Soviet Writers, held in Moscow, May 18-23. Writers' congresses were 
also held in Rumania, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany during the same period. 
At all the meetings of writers, and other connected with the arts, ad-
herence to Leninist dicta was stressed, yet many speakers complained of the 
inferior quality of works that keep strictly to the party line on socialist 
realism. Major themes of these conferences were "topical literature and party-
mindedness in literature." The entire range of previous discussions at 
writers' meetings in the Soviet republics received detailed treatment at the 
Third Soviet Writers Congress in May. 
An impression of complete solidarity between the writers and the CPSU 
was furthered by the setting and circumstances of the six-day congress, held 
in the Great Hall of the Kremlin. Some 500 Soviet writers and several hundred 
guests from the Soviet bloc and elsewhere were present, together with CPSU 
central committee presidium members who attended in a body. 
In a keynote address, Alexey Surkov, first secretary of the Union of 
Soviet Writers, declared in part: "The rich experience of the Soviet mul-
tinational literature shows the life-asserting strength of socialist realism, 
which is the most progressive artistic method of the present day." (Note: 
Surkov on May 25 was replaced as secretary of the writers! union by Kon-
stantin Fedin.) 
Speakers from various Soviet republics developed themes made familiar in 
the Soviet bloc conferences of the previous five months. Although speakers 
refrained from attacking Pasternak, his fictional method in "Doctor Zhivago" 
was disparaged by a declaration on the "insolvency of retrospectivity" -- that 
is, the description of events that occurred many years ago. As against this 
treatment, writers were urged to keep strictly to "topicality," or the fic-
tionized account of current developments in the "construction of socialism."

SOVIET =RUBE AND "PARTY SPIRIT" - 73 - 
A leading topic of discussion at the congress was the subject: "What 
must the hero of Soviet literature be like?" The "positive hero," as pic-
tured by the speakers, should not be an individualist in isolation (a re-
ference to Pasternak's hero, Doctor Zhivago), but an "active participant in 
the major events of the daily life of the Soviet country." 
Soviet writers were told that their books should give "fuller and more 
vivid portraits of our contemporaries, the builders of communism." One 
speaker complained that much of the writing is "dull, written on a gray back-
ground." He added that "we need sparkling artistic colors." 
On May 22, Khrushchev covered the main themes of the conference in a 
lengthy speech that carried conciliatory overtones but made no concessions 
as regards the tenets of socialist realism. With reference to writers re-
admitted to good standing in the Writers' Union (these-did not include Pas-
ternak), he said there should be no recriminations against those trying to 
overcome "serious mistakes," but that the mistakes themselves should not be 
forgotten. 
With respect to fiction depicting aspects of Soviet society in need of 
reform, Khrushchev warned that "if anyone reveals and lays bare failings and 
faults, it will be done by the party, by its central committee." This would 
rule out such books as Dudintsev's "Not by Bread Alone," which pictures the 
evils and ineptitudes of bureaucracy. 
The weight of Khrushchev's cultural pronouncements at the congress gives 
them the effect of binding CPSU directives, not only for writers in the USSR 
but also for those in Soviet bloc countries who are obliged to follow Moscow's 
policies. Nevertheless, frequent allusions in other congress speeches to the 
generally poor quality of writing produced under party directions suggest that 
the CPSU is by no means sure of its ability to inspire widespread enthusiasm 
for the stereotypes demanded in the name of socialist realism.

Chapter Twelve 
THE PARTY AND THE QUESTION OF NATIONALITIES 
A leading propaganda theme of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
(CPSU) is the phrase "freedom for colonial peoples." Moscow's professed 
support of anti-colonialism is a basic element in Soviet Russia's relations 
with parties and movements in countries ranging from Africa to the Far East. 
Yet no empire in history has been more ruthless in suppressing the political 
and cultural aspirations of nationalities within its own borders. 
Although in theory a limited degree of autonomy, and even sovereignty, 
is granted to the component political units within the USSR, in practice the 
central government alone is sovereign; its functional apparatus, the CPSU, 
guides the destinies of all the peoples within the Soviet boundaries. 
The duality between the Soviet constitutional de facto governmental 
structure can be attributed to the contradictory principles of Lenin. He 
believed in democratic centralism, or the single-party (Bolshevik) control 
of a Communist state. At the same time, he had less positive views on the 
multinational relationship between the federated Socialist states of the 
USSR. 
On November 2, 1917, a few days before the Bolshevik Revolution, 
Lenin's party issued a proclamation regarding the "Rights of the Peoples 
of Russia," and on the same day party leaders proclaimed the "Rights of the 
Toiling and Exploited People." The first manifesto appealed to subject 
nationalities within the former Czarist empire; the second repeated the 
slogan of the Communist Manifesto of 1848 -- "Workers of the world, unites" 
The November 2 "Declaration of Rights," issued in the names of Lenin 
and Stalin (then Commissar of Nationalities), stated, in part: 
"The Council of People's Commissars has decided to base its work in 
relation to the nationalities of Russia on the following principles: (1) 
the equality and sovereignty of the nations of Russia; (2) the right of the 
nations of Russia to free self-determination, including the right to secede 
and form independent states." 
Despite this declaration, the suppression by the Bolsheviks of national 
movements and the subordination of non-Russians to the Great Russians of 
western Russia proceeded by several stages. 
rj 
TBE PARTY AND THE QUESTION OF NATIONALITIES - 75 - 
Three weeks after the first declaration was issued, another party 
manifesto was addressed to "all toiling Muslims in Russia and the East." 
This proclamation urged "all those whose mosques and prayer-houses were 
destroyed, and religion and customs trampled upon, to build up their faith 
and customs and to enter on a national life freely and unhindered." 
Not the former Czarist government, but its successor, the Bolshevik 
regime, effectively destroyed Muslim cultural and religious institutions 
and "trampled upon" Muslim national aspirations. 
Following the collapse of Czarist authority, many of the former sub-
ject nations declared their independence. Almost without exception, the 
new regimes in the Ukraine, Transcaucasia, and Central Asia elected anti-
Bolshevik governments, for the most part under Menshevik (conservative 
Social Democratic) control. Communism, in fact, had little appeal outside 
of the large cities of the Russian Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR). 
During the civil war, 1918-1922, Bolshevik troops fought "White Guard" 
armies and engaged in guerrilla warfare with Social-Revolutionary and other 
non-Bolshevik contingents. The Red troops in time crushed all of their 
opponents and, in so doing, overthrew one anti-Bolshevik regime after another. 
In 1917 an autonomous government was set up at Kokand in Uzbekistan, but 
a year later, Bolshevik soldiers executed the Uzbek leaders and commissars 
from Moscow established a Communist regime at Tashkent. In 1918 the Turkestani 
tried to form an independent "democratic republic" -- a movement that was not 
entirely extinguished for almost two decades. 
The Moscow Government concluded a treaty with the Republic of Georgia 
on May 7, 1920, which stated: "Russia recognizes unconditionally the 
existence and independence of the Georgian State, and voluntarily renounces 
all sovereign rights which belonged to Russia with respect to Georgian 
people and territory." 
In violation of the treaty, Soviet forces crossed the Georgian frontier 
on February 21, 1921, seized Tiflis, and immediately proclaimed the Georgian 
Soviet Socialist Republic. Two other Caucasian republics had already fallen 
to Soviet armed forces -- Azerbaijan in the spring of 1920 and Armenia in 
November of that year. A short-lived revolt by the Tatars was also suppressed. 
Stalin's purge trials of 19361938 also provided an excuse for the 
suppression of the "Pan-Turanian" movement and the execution of its leaders, 
Mir Seyed Sultan-Galiev and Faizulla Khodzhaev, together with thousands of 
their alleged followers. Actually, the crime of Khodzhaev was his objection 
to Moscow's policy of making Uzbekistan exclusively a cotton-growing area.

Chapter Twelve 
Between 1940 and 1946, mass deportations and, in some instances, the 
obliteration of national governments, were carried out by Stalin's orders. 
The liquidation of autonomous political entities in the USSR and the 
deportation of their citizens involved, in 1941: the extinction of the 
Volga German Autonomous Republic and the deportation of the population, 
followed by similar treatment of the Kalmyks, Balkars, and Karachais in 
1942. Liquidation of the autonomous areas of the Crimean Tatars and_ 
Chechen-Ingushi and mass deportations of their peoplecame in 1944-1945. 
Altogether, more than a million people were the victims of Stalin's 
policy, carried out in the lower Volga, Crimea, and Caucasus. In 1956, 
Communist Party chief Nikita Khrushchev announced that several of the 
deported nationalities would be "restored" to their native hams, but the 
number actually resettled was not announced and there was no mention of 
the 400,000 Volga Germans and 260,000 Tatars who suffered persecution 
en masse. 
The Soviet conquest of the Baltic Republics occurred in two stages, 
1940-1941, and 1944-1945 (Nazi occupation intervened). These actions 
were accompanied by terrorism, police brutalities, and large-scale 
deportations of Estoni*ns, Latvians, and Lithuanians. Hundreds of 
thousands of Baltic peoples were sent to the interior of the USSR, and 
the national intelligentsia of the three countries was decimated, except 
for those who found refuge abroad. 
Besides the outright subjugation of non-Russian nationalities, ethnic 
groups and races in the USSR in many instances have been weakened and 
diluted by the forcible intrusion of alien stocks from western Russia and 
elsewhere. 
Thus, untold numbers of Ukrainians, Great Russians, Belts, Poles, and 
others have been resettled in Kazakhstan, Turkmenia, the Buryat-Mongolian 
Autonomous Republic, etc. As a result, in some Union Republics there are 
now more non-natives than indigenous inhabitants. For example, in 
Kazakhstan there are more Russians than Kazakhs, while in Uzbekistan, 
Turkmenia and Kirghizia, Great Russians are the second largest ethnic 
element. 
Besides measures involving mass deportations and resettlement, a 
further means of disintegrating national ethnic stocks has been through 
a policy of "national demarcation," that is, the arbitrary rearrangement 
of traditional boundaries, carried out in the southern Soviet republics 
and elsewhere. 
Other measures include the "russianizing" -- as far as possible -- of 
all nationalities or, at least, CPSU insistence on the superiority of Great 
Russian achievements. The central government's educational system, imposed 
on all areas of non-Russian nationality, is a further lever in the hands of 
the party. Finally, the entire Soviet economic structure, centralized in 
the "party machine," tends to isolate and disperse any surviving national 
groupings. 
j 
THE PARTY AND THE OIDESTION OF NATIONALITIES _ 77 _ 
Occasionally, the discontent of non-Russians with their lot breaks 
into print. This happened in 1957, when the long-smoldering resentment 
of Kazakh intellectuals against Moscow's overlordship was disclosed in 
Kazakhstan Pravda, organ of the Kazakh Communist Party. 
On January 13, 1957, Kazakhstan Pravda leveled charges against the 
Kazakh-language journal of the writers' union, Kazakh Adebieti, which was 
accused of printing "false, pernicious, and defamatory" articles with 
regard to Soviet policy in Kazakhstan. 
According to Kazakhstan Pravda, the writers' journal had been guilty 
of the following "misrepresentations": the "interests and wishes" of 
Kazakhs were being ignored; (non-Kazakh) "specialists" were brought in to 
direct livestock raising and other local enterprises, and Soviet officials 
consistently violated the Leninist principle of "nationality" within the USSR. 
Kazakh Adiebeti was also charged with having complained that Kazakh 
national epics had been placed on a "black list" by Soviet literary censors 
and that all references to Kazakh literature of the pre-Bolshevik period 
were omitted from school textbooks. 
Apart from the Kazakh Communist Party's attack on the literary journal, 
all evidence points to the truth of the writers' contentions. Official 
party reaction to the controversy was the comment, inspired by the CPSU 
central committee, that only "approved" versions of national epics and other 
literary works from which all "feudalistic encrustrations" had been removed 
would be published. 
In connection with the Soviet suppression of national epics, the case 
of Kazakhstan is not exceptional. The Kirghiz epic "Manes," the Azerbaijan 
folk epic "Dede Korkud" and the Turkmen "Korkud Ata" have also been con-
demned by Moscow's cultural mentors. This is in line with the CPSU policy 
of stressing the cultural superiority of the Great Russians over all other 
regional cultures. 
A typical effusion on this theme was an article by Stalin Prize Winner 
Cheisvili, a Georgian, which appeared in the newspaper Zarya Vostoka of 
May 29, 1954. Cheisvili said, in part: 
"Socialist Georgia awes the development of its economy and culture to 
its strong friendship with the Russian people, and their constant, dis-
interested, and sincere assistance...The wise Lenin-Stalin policy of the 
Communist Party unites the Georgian people with the Great Russian people, 
the people of the glorious Ukraine and all the nations of the vast country." 
The independence of Georgia was extinguished in 1920; the last spark of 
nationalist expression was crushed in the spring of 1956, following disturb-
ances in Tiflis.

Chapter Twelve 
On November 7, 1954, the newspaper Soviet Kirghizia quoted Yunusaliey, 
rector of Kirghiz State University, as follows: "Such truly grandiose successes 
of the Kirghiz people were attained only through the revolutionary-transform-
ing role of the Soviet Government, the wise leadership of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union, and the constant brotherly help of the Great Russian 
people." 
Kirghizia was one of the victims of Moscow's policy of "national demar-
cation" which placed part of its original population in adjacent republics. 
The influx of western Russians has been such that at present the Kirghiz 
people constitute little more than half of the population and the ratio of 
Kirghizians to newcomers is constantly diminishing. 
The systematic destruction of the historical and cultural heritages of 
peoples within the boundaries of the USSR was followed by a similar process of 
denationalization in the annexed Baltic states. This reached full intensity 
about 1946 and has continued ever since then. As an exiled Estonian educator 
wrote: 
"When the whole nation is destined to die, its culture, language, and 
national character have to be destroyed first. When the Soviet Union annexed 
Estonia, it did not start only the physical destruction of the nation by means 
of deportations, arrests and murders of Estonians, but even more, the spiritual 
destruction and doom of this detormined and freedom-loving nation." 
This epitaph on Estonia applies equally to Latvia and Lithuania. After 
the Baltic countries were absorbed by the USSR, their national constitutions 
were consigned to oblivion and their respective legal systems were altered to 
conform to that of the Soviet Union. A former Latvian judge testified: 
"They (the Russians) appointed people's courts after the annexation. 
They discharged all judges, and now the whole jurisdiction was in the hands 
of 'people's judges' who were simply appointed by the Communist Party." 
The school systems of the Baltic nations have been remodeled on the 
Soviet educational pattern and their national histories have been rewritten 
under the direction of Muscovite historiographers. 
For example, a one-volume History of the Estonian Republic, published 
in 1952, offers a Marxist-Leninist explanation of the "emergence of an 
independent Estonian state as a result of prior historical events and devel-
opments." However, according to this Communist version, the era of Czarist 
imperialism (1700-1917), because it was Russian, was more liberal and conferred 
more benefits on Estonia than the independence won by the country in 1917-1918, 
which was based on western-type democracy until its overthrow by the Communists. 
The falsification of national histories and the perversion of national 
cultures followed the take-over of Eastern Europe by Soviet armed forces and

agents. The establishment of "people's democracies," concluded by 1948-1949, 
led to the complete revamping of educational systems in the satellite countriea 
and the rewriting -- under Moscow's direction -- of textbooks, histories, etc. 
In this pedagogic material, again, the superiority of Russian culture and 
achievements is emphasized at all times. 
As the products of Western culture, publishing, and journalism were 
withdrawn from public circulation in Eastern Europe, printed material 
carrying the Communist, pro-Moscow line everywhere was substituted. The 
Communist-run presses in the satellites are assigned heavy publishing quotas 
as part of the production plans of the puppet regimes. Also, Soviet publi-
cations in vast quantities are distributed, many of which are compulsory reading 
for students in the satellite countries. 
Despite the persistent and ruthless suppression of nationalist tendencies 
in the USSR and Moscow's unremitting efforts to wipe out genuine nationalism 
in Eastern Europe, the Hungarian freedom rebellion of October-November 1956 
demonstrated that the embers of national spirit have not been extinguished 
in the satellite nations. The question of nationalities therefore is still 
a matter of deep concern to the CPSU central committee. 
The bitter conflict between Moscow and the Yugoslav Communist Party, 
which was renewed in the spring of 1958 after three-year detente, 
illustrates another nationalist problem that plagues the CPSU. This issue 
is known as "revisionism," or the refusal of a Communist Party outside of 
the USSR to follow Moscow's dictates in every respect. 
Within the USSR, the question was settled in the 1920's by the harsh 
suppression of independent Communist parties and the purging of their leaders. 
Movements for national communism were most vigorous in Byelorussia and the 
Ukraine, reaching the height of their influence during the civil war period 
(1918-1922), when Lenin and his associates were engrossed in military operations 
elsewhere. 
Once these were completed, Lenin and his subordinate Stalin turned 
their attention to the autonomous Communist parties on the periphery of the 
USSR. Within a short time, the doctrine of democratic centralism was 
imposed on all non-conforming Communists by a combination of Bolshevik armed 
force, intrigue, and pressure by the "centralists." 
In the Ukraine, however, vestiges of nationalist sentiment persisted in 
the Ukrainian Communist Party through World War II. The movement was crushed 
by Khrushchev, at the instance of Stalin, after the war ended. 
By 1947, when the Communist Information Burueau (Cominform) was estab-
lished, it seemed that the principle of CPSU dominance of international 
communism was firmly accepted, but Tito's quarrel with Moscow in the follow-
ing year exposed a weak link in the CPSU international system.

After a period of adjustment between the parties, May 1955 to April 
1958, the controversy was renewed; revisionism is now a major heresy in 
CPSU ideological dogma. The battlefield embraces the entire international 
Communist movement.

FRONT ORGANIZATIONS: VEHICLES FOR PARTY GOALS 
Wherever Communist parties are active -- and even in some countries 
where the party is outlawed -- there are Communist "front" organizations. 
Some of these, on an international scale, have millions of members; their 
affiliates at national levels may enlist the support of several thousand 
fellow travelers and sympathizers. District units may run to a dozen 
or so, or a few hundred members. They represent the local spearhead of 
an international front -- usually under a different name. 
Whatever their designations, front organizations have several features 
in common -- they echo Moscow's propaganda and also serve the aims of local 
Communist parties. In any event, all front activities are traceable, 
directly or indirectly, to d4rectives issued by the central committee of 
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). 
Another characteristic of the front organizations is that, ostensibly, 
they offer some form of appeal to non-Communists. Although their tactics, 
meetings, and administration are under firm Communist control, their front 
activities are generally conducted by persons who are not identified with 
a Communist Party. This, too, is the result of a policy adopted by the 
CPSU more than a decade ago. 
Broadly, there are two types of front organizations. One is based 
on adherence to a generalized propaganda theme, such as "peace," "peaceful 
coexistenoe," "anti-colonialism," "solidarity," etc. The other category of 
front organizations includes all those set up; on occupational, educational, 
or social lines. The latter fronts repeat the generalized propaganda themes 
but also further Communist ends in their particular fields. 
An outstanding example of the generalized front organization is the 
World Peace Council, with its innumerable affiliates -- "partisans of 
peace," "peace committees," and so forth. 
The principal functions of national and local "peace committees" 
and "partisans of peace" are (1) under the guidance of Communists, to 
draw in non-Communists who are sympathetic to the cause of world peace; 
and (2) to further the aims of Soviet foreign policy or serve the local 
Communist Party in the guise of "peace" propaganda. Most of this propa-
ganda pictures the Communist bloc regimes as "peace-laving"; contrarywise, 
non-Communist powers are depicted as ruled by "aggressive cliques" of "war-
mongers."

Moscow's "solidarity" propaganda, tied in with the theme of "anti-
colonialism," is now concentrated largely in the "Afro-Asian People's 
Solidarity Council," an outgrowth of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference 
held in Cairo between December 26, 1957, and January 1, 1958. National 
"solidarity committees" are being organized in a number of the countries from 
which the so-called people's representatives came to the Cairo meeting. 
The growing network of "solidariv" groups, with headquarters in 
Cairo, is more than an outlet of CPSU Agitprop and Arab nationalist 
propaganda. The Council also represents an extension of Soviet foreign 
policy in its attempt to identify the USSR as an Asiatic power -- with 
interests An the Far East, Near East and Africa. 
Although the World Peace Council (established in 1949) with its sub-
sidiaries represents the largest complex of front groups and organizations, 
it was not the first in the field. Other major international front organi-
zations were organized in 1945 and 1946, immediately after the conclusion 
of war in Europe, during the year when the United Nations became a viable 
international organization. 
The Communist-controlled international fronts have never endorsed 
the principles of the United Nations Charter in respect to any particular 
situation that brought forth a Soviet veto in the UN Security Council. 
The World Peace Council, for example, followed Moscow's lead when the 
Security Council in June 1950 labeled the North Korean regime an aggressor 
and later leveled the same charge against Communist China. The USSR 
refused to accept the UN ruling in both cases. 
Among the principal international front organizations that follow 
occupational or other specialized interests of members (with the dates 
of their founding) are the following: 
World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), 1945 
World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY), 1945 
Women's International Democratic Federation (1WIDF), 1945 
International Union of Students (ills), 1946 
World Federation of Teachers' Unions (FISE), 1946 
International Association of Democratic lawyers (IADL), 1946 
International Organization of Journalists (ICJ), 1946 
Similar international organizations serve other leftwing and fellow-
traveling occupational groups.

FRONT ORGANIZATIONS: VEHICLES FOR PARTY GOALS - 83 - 
The multitude of national front organizations in various nations 
include groups such as societies for "cultural relations with the USSR," 
national "friendship" associations for promoting ties with Communist 
bloc countries, sports associations, and so forth. Many fronts have 
special designations, such aS"Congress of Mothers in Defense of Children," 
"Union of Families of Political Exiles and Prisoners," and the like. Often 
a Communist front assumes a name closely resembling that of a non-Communist 
association having a legitimate social welfare or other objective. 
In no case does any Communist-controlled front -- large or small --
comment adversely or pass rPsolutions condemning social, economic or 
political conditions within the Communist orbit. Nor does any front ever 
take a stand against the foreign policy of the USSR, the satellite countries, 
or the Communist regimes in the Far East. 
Since the largest proportion of members in international fronts comes 
from Communist bloc countries, the claimed membership of any front is 
difficult to assess, especially as membership for stated occupations and 
professions is practically mandatory in Communist countries. 
The present worldwide ramification of front organizations was 
anticipated, in theory, by Lenin when he wrote: 
"Every sacrifice must be made, the greatest obstacles must be overcome, 
in order to carry on agitation and propaganda systematically, perseveringly, 
persistently and patiently, precisely in those institutions, societies and 
associations -- even the most reactionary -- to which proletarian or semi-
proletarian masses belong." 
However, aside from the World Federation of Trade Unions, certain 
leftwing farmers' unions, and the like, other Communist fronts are not 
of proletarian origin or background. For the most part, their members 
belong to the intelligentsia and not to the industrial or agricultural 
working classes. This shift in emphasis is due to the postwar policy of 
the CPSU, designed to enlist student, professional and technical groups 
in a drive for world communism. 
The propaganda uses to which front organizations may be put was 
illustrated by the Sixth World Festival of Youth, held in Moscow, July 28 - 
August 11, 1957. This spectacular event was the offshoot and propaganda 
showpiece of the WFDY and the IUS, which had sponsored five previous youth 
festivals between 1947 and 1955, all of them held in satellite countries:* 
When the WFDY was founded in November 1945 at the World Youth Conference 
in London -- convened by the Communist-controlled World Youth Council -- it 
professed to be nonpolitical and all-embracing in membership. Because of its 
obvious pro-Soviet activities, however, by 1949 most of its non-Communist 
affiliates had withdrawn to form their own organization, the World Assembly 
wrhe Seventh World Youth Festival, on an even more lavish scale, was held 
in Vienna, Austria, July 26-August 4, 1959.

of Youth (RAY). Other youth organizations that withdrew from the WFDY 
included the Catholic students organizations and the International Union 
of Socialist Youth (IUSY). 
A further disruption in the WFDY occurred in 1950, when its executive 
committee expelled the Yugoslav People's Youth organization. The committee 
resolution called the Yugoslav youth leaders "traitors to the cause of 
peace and democracy, and deserters into the camp of the imperialist warmongers." 
Despite WFDY charter provisions setting student rights and freedoms as 
goals, none of the stated rights and freedams are found in the Communist bloc 
countries which contribute the great majority of WFDY's members. The suppression 
of the Hungarian rebellion, and the shooting, arrests, and imprisonment of 
Hungarian students brought no hostile comment from the WFDY executive 
committee. 
The executive committee of the WFDY Council, like the CPSU central 
committee, is not subject to democratic elections or rank-and-file check. 
It is guided and directed by veteran Communists and fellow travelers. 
The WFDY has a typical front structure, which resembles that of the CPSU. 
In theory, the governing body of the WFDY is the World Congress of Youth, 
but its functioning organs -- especially the executive committee -- wields 
de facto authority in the organization. The executive committee is served 
by a permanent secretariat. 
Central guidance and coordination of activities extends from the 
emcutive committee and secretariat to regional, national, district and 
local youth organizations. The upper levels of the WFDY are sprinkled with 
non-Communists, but the secretariat is almost solidly Communist and does not 
deviate in policy from the line handed down, through various channels, fromtthe 
CPSU central committee. 
In 1955, WFDY claimed 85 million members, but an analysis of member-
ship rolls, based on Communist sources, shows that at least 70 percent 
are from Communist countries, where students are pressured into joining unions 
affiliated with WFDY. The membership claimed among free-world students is 
believed to be greatly exaggerated. 
The tie-in between such a front as the WFDY and other front organizations 
is maintained through an interlocking directorate -- that is, officers and 
personnel who belong to two or more fronts. For example, officers of the 
World Peace Council are found as officers in many other fronts. 
The official organ of the WFDY is World Youth, a monthly issued in 
eleven language editions. All the front organizations have their awn 
periodicals and some have several. The IUS, for example, publishes World 
Student News in six-language editions and the fortnightly IUS an Service. 
FRONT ORGANIZATIONS: VERICMS FOR PARTY GOALS - 85 - 
It also issues separate magazines for agricultural, architectural and 
medical students. Trade union internationals affiliated with the WFTU 
also have their own trade papers with a Communist slant. 
Membership in the International Union of Students is drawn mainly 
from Communist bloc countries; for example, the Soviet Komsomol organi-
zations are listed in toto as belonging to the IUS. 
As in the case of the WFDY, complete administrative control of IUS 
is vested in a closed body -- the executive committee of the World Students' 
Congress. The Congress, which has met four times since its founding in 
1946, is not amenable to democratic procedures. 
Again, like the WFDY executive committee, the IDS executive committee 
took no action on Soviet intervention in Hungary. Its Prague headquarters 
remained silent on the executions of Hungarians. 
An occasional function of local affiliates of the WFDY and IUS is to 
provide the active nucleus of mob actions directed against targets set by 
a national or local Communist Party. Local Communists, generally speaking, 
act on instructions prepared in Moscow but they may use their own discretion 
as to the exact moment to foment disorders or violence. 
Communist-directed student agitators have formed the spearhead of 
mobs in Singapore, Tokoyo, Lebanon and other Near East areas, Caracas and 
other Latin American cities, and elsewhere. In many instances, a relatively 
small band of student provocateurs has been able to spark an outbreak 
involving hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. 
In addition to its agitation activities, IUS conducts systematic 
propaganda through its official organ, World Student Newsland in a series 
of pamphlets of topics associated with CPSU propaganda themes. 
In many ways, the World Federation of Trade Unions is potentially 
Moscow's most important implement of agitation, infiltration and subversion 
in the free world. As in the case of other fronts, WFTU claimed membership 
figures have little significance, since the WFTU itself concedes that about 
80 percent of its affiliated members are from Communist countries. 
The claimed WFTU membership in the free world is less than one-third 
of the known membership of the non-Communist International Confederation of 
Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). Nevertheless, WFTU affiliated unions are a real 
menace to the free trade union movement in some countries, especially in 
economically less developed areas where trade unionism is just emerging. 
Although the WFTU was founded in 1945 as a nonpolitical organization 
it soon fell under Communist influence and by 1949 was firmly under 
Communist domination. This led to the withdrawal of three powerful affiliated

nat:I.onal unions -- British, American, and Dutch, who then formed their 
own organization, ICFTU. 
The WFTU's official organ, World Trade Union Movement, follows every 
shift in Moscow's propaganda line and faithfully echoes Soviet foreign 
policy and propaganda statements. 
The steps by which the WFTU passed to Communist control are evident 
from figures on membership in the three governing bodies, between 1945 
and 1948. 
The WFTU executive bureau in 1945 was made up of 4 Communists and 5 
non-Communists; in 1948, there were 6 Communists and only 3 non-Communists. 
The executive committee of the bureau in 1945 had an even balance of 11 
each, Communists and non-Communists. Three years later, there were 14 
Communists on the committee, as against 6 non-Communists. The WFTU General 
Council in 1945 had a total of 64 members, of which 38 were non-Communists; 
by 1948 the ratio was 34 Communists to 30 non-Communists. 
The accretion of Communist strength in front administrations is 
accomplished by a variety of tactics: pressure or hard bargaining aimed at 
the non-Communists; manipulation of meetings or conferences by the hard-
core party cadres, especially in the initial or preparatory stages of a 
conference; devious voting procedures, or sheer aggressive persistence 
pitted against the indifference oib apathy of the rank-and-file members. 
For example, when Communists were engaged in taking over the WFTU, a 
stream of newly created unions from economically underdeveloped countries 
applied for affiliation. Previously, the total membership of the new unions 
had been given as several tens of thousands, but the total figure jumped to 
more than a million at the time when they came to vote in a WFTU conference. 
The validity of their membership claims could not be checked. 
Working organizations of the WFTU which reflect the executive committee's 
policy line are the regional liaison bureaus and the national affiliated 
unions. The Latin American Confederation of Labor (CTAL), for example, is 
recognized by WFTU as the liaison bureau for all Latin America. 
Another form of transmission belt between the WFTU and affiliated 
unions are the trade departments, known as Trade Union Internationals (TUIs). 
These provide international links between workers in a particular field or 
Industry and the central NFTU apparatus. 
Examples of TUIs are those of the international transport workers, metal 
and engineering workers, agricultural and forestry workers, and the trade 
union departments of public service enterprises, recently merged as the 
"Public and Allied Employees TUI."

The Miners TUI (headquarters, France), the TUI for Chemical, Glass, 
Oil and Glassware Workers (Budapest), and the Metal and Engineering Workers 
TUI (Vienna) illustrate the penetration of Communist-controlled trade 
department unions into key industries. 
Directives issued during the meeting of Communist leaders in Moscow 
in November 1957 called for intensifying WFTU activities during 1958, 
especially in underdeveloped countries. Latin America and the Middle 
East were singled out as prime targets for increased WFTU penetration. 
An official WFTU handbook, "Report of the Activity of the World 
Federation of Trade Unions, November 1953 - June 1957," records WFTU's 
support of Soviet propaganda themes. 
During the past two years, "friendship societies" have proliferated 
in some parts of the free world and throughout the Communist orbit, with 
notable increases in Egypt, Sudan, Pakistan, Nepal, India, Japan, and 
Indonesia. 
These societies, oriented to members of the Communist bloc, use a 
variety of tactics to form new societies, increase their membership, exercise 
political pressure and promote the propaganda objectives of the CPSU. 
They employ the familiar Communist devices of coercion, flattery, subterfuge, 
respectability-through-association, and slogans designed to win popular 
support. In some instances, government and civic officials unwittingly have 
lent themselves to Communist aims by consenting to attend or participate in 
activities sponsored by a national friendship society.

MOSCOW'S ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM 
The bitter controversy that came to a head in 1948 and again in 1958 
between the Yugoslav Communist Party (League of Communists of Yugoslavia) 
and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) again raised the ques-
tion of "independent communism." 
Since both parties to the argument profess to follow Marxism-Leninism, 
the debate hinges partly on the definition of the "leading role" assumed by 
the CPSU in international communism, and also, on the practical results of 
differences in theory betveen the two Communist parties. (Other Communist 
parties in the Sino-Soviet bloc quickly followed suit in denouncing the 
Yugoslav position.). 
The Yugoslav Communist Party congress, which opened on April 22, 1958, 
at Ljubljana, was boycotted by observers from the Communist parties of the 
USSR, the satellite states (except Poland) and Communist China. The ini-
tial target of the CPSU attack on the Yugoslays was a draft program of the 
congress which, prior to the meeting, came under fire from Soviet theorists 
writing in Kommunist, organ of the mu central committee. 
Stripped of ideological phrasing, the substance of the Kommunist  
charge was that the Yugoslav Communists are guilty of the grave heresy of 
"revisionism" -- in this instance, stemming from their refusal to accept 
without qualification Moscow's policy line in all matters, domestic and 
foreign. 
One section of the congress program was singled out by Kommunist for 
special censure -- the Yugoslav assertion that "by.reason of its strong 
international political position, or because of the different degree of 
economic development, it is possible for one socialist country (i.e., the 
USSR) to maintain by various means its unequal relation with one or several 
other socialist countries." 
The Kommunist writers argued that this point was immaterial, and 
declared that "Marxism-Leninism does not reject the possibility of one or 
another Communist party of socialist (Communist) country playing the 
leading role during a definite historical period." 
The Yugoslav position regarding the "leading role" in international 
communism assumed by the CPSU has long been a subject of discussion among 
Communists outside of the USSR, and during the split between Moscow and 
Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia, led to widespread purges of upper-level Com-
munists in the satellites. The question itself is deeply imbedded in 
Communist Party history and dialectics. 
MOSCOW'S ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL =MONISM - 89 - 
Communist leader V. I. Lenin discoursed at length on this problem; his 
party subordinates, Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky, had conflicting views 
in regard to it. The CPSU theorists nevertheless ignore the recorded 
statements of Lenin on international communism. He believed that the "pro-
letarian world revolution" started with the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, 
and that the USSR -- as the first Communist State -- should have the support 
of Communist parties throughout the world. But he did not demand specifi-
cally that the Soviet party should be the sole voice of international com-
munism. 
In 1920 Lenin wrote: "Every party that wishes to affiliate to the 
Communist International (Comintern) must render selflessly devoted assist-
ance to every Soviet republic in its struggle against counter-revolutionary 
forces." At the time, Lenin still pictured the Soviet Union as a federation 
of Soviet republics, guided but not wholly dominated by Moscow. 
Yet the Comintern itself was a creation of the party's central com-
mittee and although non-Russians occupied prominent posts in its top leader-
ship, the Comintern, as a worldwide conspiratorial organization, was rigidly 
governed by the CPSU in Moscow from 1919 to 1943. 
The Comintern was a highly organized body with a system of regional 
bureaus, agents, couriers, etc., operating through a secretariat that was 
responsible solely to the CPSU central committee; it did not consult 
affiliated Communist parties in regard to its broad policies. It was dis-
solved during World War II by Stalin as a gesture of conciliation toward his 
Western allies. 
The war had scarcely ended when Stalin revived the old Marxist-Leninist 
slogans about "capitalist encirclement," the "inevitable conflict between 
the two camps" (communism and capitalism), and the "downfall of capitalism" 
predicated on "capitalist contradictions." In this renewal of Soviet antag-
onism to the West, Stalin had the able assistance of Andrei Zhdanov. 
The successor to the Comintern -- but with a different structure --
was the Communist Information Bureau, or Cominform, which was largely the 
creation of Zhdanov. 
At its first meeting in Szklarska Poreba near Warsaw, September 1947, 
Zhdanov outlined the principle functions and aims of the Cominform. Mainly, 
he voiced the opposition of the Kremlin to the newly announced Marshall Plan 
for United States aid to devastated Europe. (On Zhdanov's insistence, Poland 
and Czechoslovakia were forced to reject participation in the Marshall Plan.) 
In this connection Zhdanov referred to the "insolent and aggressive 
policy of the U.S.A." and added: "The Communists parties must head the re-
sistance to the plans of imperialist expansion and aggression in all fields."

Chapter Fourteen 
At this time, the USSR was supporting armed guerrillas in northern 
Greece and had threatened the Turkish Government. Following Zhdanov's 
plan for the subjugation of Eastern Europe, minority Communist parties in 
all the border states were engaged in undermining existing governments and 
in Aome cases had already succeeded in overthrowing them. At this time, 
also, the Soviet penetration and exploitation of China's provinces of 
Sinkiang and Manchuria were still proceeding and Outer Mongolia had become 
a full-fledged satellite of Moscow, several years before. 
The Cominform was made up of the Communist parties of the USSR, the 
satellites, Italy and France. It had no hard-and-fast organizational 
structure and held only four meetings of public record: the inital meeting 
near Warsaw in 1947; a meeting in Yugoslavia in January 1948; a session in 
June 1948 (when the Yugoslav Communist Party was expelled); and finally, a 
meeting in Hungary on November 27, 1949, which reaffirmed the policies of 
the organization and repeated the attack on Tito. 
The sole publication of the Cominform was its weekly newspaper, For 
a Lasting Peace, for a People's Democracy, issued in several languages. 
This organ was discontinued in April 1956, when the Cominform was dis-
solved. (For the new monthly on international communism see Chapter X .) 
The Cominform weekly, to which leading Communists of various national 
parties contributed, voiced the policy of the CPSU central committee on all 
matters pertaining to international communism. It provided party-line 
guidance to Communist leadership throughout the world and offered appropri-
ate information for the benefit of upper-level party members and "cadres." 
In addition to the ideological guidance exercised through the Cominform, 
the CPSU itself has always had a worldwide apparatus for exerting practical 
control of the most Communist parties outside the Soviet bloc. The disso-
lution of the Cominform therefore had little effect on Moscow's ability to 
steer the international Communist movement -- with a few exceptions -- along 
the lines set by the CPSU central committee. 
The ending of the Cominform coincided with Moscow's effort to restore 
amicable relations with Belgrade. This began with a visit to Yugoslavia 
in May 1955 of Soviet party leaders Khrushchev and Bulganin, and a return 
visit by Tito in June 1956. As a result of the latter conference, a joint 
statement was issued by the conferees, in which "freedom of will and equal-
ity" was conceded to the Yugoslav Communist Party by the CPSU. 
Soviet armed intervention in the Hungarian freedom rebellion adversely 
affected the standing of the CPSU in western Europe. Western European 
Communist parties declined in prestige and membership and Communist in-
fluence in trade unions, wherever it existed, was seriously impaired. 
Defections and resignations -- from Communist front organizations and 
parties -- including writers, artists, fellow-traveling politicans and others, 
were numerous throughout western Europe. By mid-summer of 1957, the Com-
munist movement in western Europe was at its lowest ebb since 1939. 
MOSCOW'S ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM 
- 91-
Meanwhile, agitation for a new type of international Communist party 
organization began to take shape under CPSU prodding. In January 1957, a 
conference was held in Budapest, which was attended by Khrushchev and 
Georgi Malenkov (then Deputy Premier), and party leaders from Hungary, 
Rumania, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia. 
On January 7-8, a two-day conference took place in East Berlin between 
German Communist leaders and a Soviet delegation. A statement over 
Khrushchev's signature said that the "Communist parties of the world should 
close ranks and reach unity of views and actions on fundamental questions of 
building socialism (communism)." 
Developments in the USSR during the summer and fall of 1957 indicate 
that Khrushchev had two main objectives as regards the CPSU. First, he 
planned to win undisputed control of the party machine. Secondly, he pro-
posed, if possible, to re-establish the primacy of the CPSU in the inter-
national Communist movement, which had been shaken by the aftermath of the 
Hungarian rebellion. 
The ousting of the "anti-party" group -- Malenkov, Bulganin, Molotov, 
Kaganovich, and Shepilov -- at the beginning of the summer was followed in 
October by the dismissal of Marshal Georgi Zhukov as defense Minister and 
his removal from the central committee presidium. 
The next step came in November, when leaders of some 65 Communist 
parties met in Moscow, in connection with the 40th celebration of the 
Bolshevik Revolution. At a meeting, November 14-16, representatives of 12 
Communist regimes signed a lengthy Twelve Party Declaration. Although the 
Yugoslav delegation was in Moscow, it did not sign the declaration. 
Three principal themes emerge from this declaration, namely: 
(1) the assertion of ideological unanimity among the signatories, and its 
corollary, the denunciation erevisitionist tendencies; (2) Communist pro-
fessions of support for nationalism and (3) a reaffirmation of CPSU 
cipales, set forth at the 20th Party Congress of February 1956, prescribing 
"roads to power" which should be taken by the Communist parties of the free 
world. 
The subjects treated in the Moscow Declaration contribute variously 
to CPSU propaganda and organizational objectives. For example, the asser-
tion that the Declaration reflects "identity of views of the parties on 
all questions examined" is an attempt to minimize the known divergence in 
some particulars between the Yugoslav Communist Party and the CPSU. So, 
too, the bitter attack on revisionism and dogmatism suggests that ideol. 
ogical differences in the international Communist movement are more pre-
valent than Moscow cares to admit.

Citing the tendency of revisionists to demand free and open dis-
cussion of ideological matters, together with democratic procedures in 
settling them, the Declaration proposes to ban all factions and groups 
which, in its own words, "sap party unity." These pronouncements in 
essence repeat the Leninist-Stalinist formula regarding democratic central-
ism -- that is, authoritarian party control by the CPSU central committee. 
The Moscow Declaration also supports "national liberation movements" 
while denouncing "imperialism" and "colonialism." At the same time, the 
Declaration condemns nationalism within the Soviet bloc, which it labels 
"bourgeois nationalism" and "chauvinism." Thus, the Communist parties 
support "national liberation struggles" outside of the bloc while they 
suppress all such tendencies within their own boundaries. 
The Moscow Declaration produced other inconsistencies. While it pays 
lip service to the principles of complete equality, sovereignty, and non-
interference in the relations between Communist states, it refers to the 
CPSU as playing the leading role in deciding bloc policies. 
(Significantly, the Chinese Communist delegation acknowledged the primacy 
of both the USSR and the CPSU in international communism.) 
Another important section of the Declaration has to do with Communist 
goals in the free world. The signers state frankly that their unalterable 
aim is to impose communism on all areas of the world -- by parliamentary 
means if practicable, by violence if necessary. This again is the sub-
stance of the policy guidance for Communist parties laid down at the 20th 
Party Congress. 
The Moscow Declaration urges a flexible approach to the achievement 
of world communism, relying especially on the tactic of the "united front," 
whereby liberal and Socialist parties would be enlisted in political coali-
tions. 
? 
The Declaration makes it plain that once the Communists are in power 
they will "smash the resistance of the reactionary forces" and in the 
process liquidate all other parties, including their temporary allies in 
the "front." 
In another variation of the "united front" idea, the Declaration pro-
poses to line up "workers, peasant masses, and urban middle classes against 
monopolistic capital...in order to gain far-reaching social reforms." 
Taken at face value, this seems to be a tactical retreat from the orthodox 
7 
dogmas of Marxism-Leninism, which scorned any concessions to the "bourgeoisie," 
but Lenin himself advocated an occasional tactical retreat for the Bolsheviks 
in order to consolidate their ranks for further advances.

MOSCOW'S ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM - 93-
An analysis of the Declaration shows that the Communists of the Soviet 
bloc are concentrating on underdeveloped countries, rather than trying to 
expand in industrialized western Europe, where they have recently experi-
enced setbacks. 
At the end of the session of representatives from some 65 countries, 
November 16-19, 1957, the conferees issued a "Peace Manifesto," which is 
closely related to the Twelve-Party Declaration, but with a somewhat dif-
ferent connotation. In the Manifesto, the CPSU, while claiming the "lead-
ing role" in international communism, tried to give the impression that 
"collective leadership" would prevail among the Communist parties of the 
world. 
In February 1956, Khrushchev had told the 20th Party Congress that 
the "leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Communist and 
workers' parties of the other countries of people's democracy must work for 
the great cause of Socialist (Communist) transformation, taking into account 
the peculiarities and special conditions of every country...It is quite 
likely that the form of transition to socialism (communism) will become 
more and more diverse." Nevertheless, by the spring of 1958 .he CPSU was 
furiously at odds with the direction being taken by the Yugoslav Communist 
Party. 
The CPSU attack on the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, amounting 
to political interference in the internal affairs of that country, has a 
direct bearing on an instrument to which the CPSU has publicly subscribed--
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. 
A double standard in the interpretation of the five principles has 
been apparent in Soviet foreign relations since 1954, when they were first 
announced as a preamble to the Sino-Indian agreement on Tibet. The five 
principles were promptly endorsed by Moscow Pravda. 
The five principles are: (1) mutual respect for each other's 
territorial integrity and sovereignty; (2) nonagression; (3) noninter-
ference in each other's internal affairs; (4) equality and mutual benefit, 
and (5) peaceful coexistence. 
The five principles were promulgated on June 28, 1954, in a communique 
signed by Prime Minister Nehru of India and Prime Minister Chou En-lai of 
Communist China. They were supported in their entirety by the CPSU through 
its official organ Pravda in its issue of July 1. On September 30, Andrei 
VishinsRy, Soviet representative to the United Nations, addressing the UN 
Assembly, defined Soviet foreign policy as based on the five principles. 
On June 2, 1955, (then) Soviet Prime Minister Bulganin and President 
Tito of Yugoslavia issued a joint declaration which expanded the five 
principles to include a pledge of "noninterference in internal affairs for 
any reason Whatsoever," and expressed "condemnation of any attempt to im-
pose political and economic domination on other countries."

- 94 - Chapter Fourteen 
On June 23, 1955, Prime Ministers Bulganin and Nehru issued a further 
declaration that made Principle 3 even more specific: "Noninterference in 
each other's internal affairs for any reason -- of an economic, political, 
or ideological character." 
On various occasions, Soviet spokesmen in referring to Soviet relations 
in the Middle East and Far East have reiterated Soviet adherence to the 
"five principles of the Bandung Conference" (held in April 1955). However, 
at the Bandung Conference (in which the USSR was not represented), the 
official representatives of 29 Asian and Middle East governments issued a 
10-point -- not a 5-point -- Declaration on the Promotion of World Peace and 
Cooperation, based mainly on the Charter of the United Nations. 
Less than a year and a half after the Bulganin-Nehru pronouncement on 
the five principles, came Soviet intervention in Hungary, followed by in-
creasing Soviet pressure on Poland to conform to CPSU policy directives. 
The CPSU attacks= the Yugoslav Communists, which had been smoldering 
for some times came into the open in March 1958, and reached a climax dur-
ing and after the meeting of the Yugoslav Communist congress in April. 
Khrushchev's strictures on the Yugoslav Communists, delivered before 
the Bulgarian Communist Party congress on June 3, 1958, were echoed by other 
leaders in the Sino-Soviet bloc during the months that followed. His ar-
raignment of the Yugoslays was only slightly modified in his speech to the 
21st Congress of the CPSU on January 27, 1959. 
The first issue, August 1958, of World Marxist Review, a monthly 
magazine launched by representatives of Communist parties within and out-
side the Communist bloc (excluding the Yugoslays) stated that "revisionism 
is the main danger to the Communist movement in present-day conditions." 
This dictum has become a slogan of the CPSU and its affiliated Communist 
parties. 
Since the CPSU campaign against the Yugoslav Communists would seem to 
violate Principles 3 and 4 of the five principles, it is significant that 
this contradiction and other discrepancies in Soviet foreign policy were 
explained away by a leading Soviet theoretician, A. P. Butenko, in an 
article published a month after Khrushchev denounced the Yugoslavas in 
Bulgaria. 
The Butenko article, which appeared in Voprosi Filosofii (Froblems of 
Philosonhv, organ of the Soviet Academy of Science), in No. 6, 1958, en-
deavors to rationalize the contradictions between Soviet theory and practice 
in regard to peaceful coexistence. The article is titled "National Com-
munism as an Ideological Weapon of the Bourgeoisie," but its implications 
are not confined to the subject of revisionism. 
Dar+ - arIIfI7d Cony moved for Release 
MOSCOW'S ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM 
-95-
The line of reasoning expounded by Butenko runs as follows. While 
ascribing the "false" slogans of national communism to bourgeois propaganda, 
Butenko attributes the theories of revisionism to "separate, ideologically 
unstable elements in the Communist movement" itself. He cites as hotbeds 
of revisionism:Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Poland. Yugoslavia is singled out 
as a country where revisionism persists unabated and is officially condoned 
by the League of Communists. 
In this connection, Butenko refers to attempts by the Yugoslays to 
"galvanize certain anarcho-syndicalist ideas" (the Workers Council), and 
accuses the Yugoslays of casting doubt on the international significance of 
experience in the development of socialism (communism) in the USSR" ... 
"under the guise of the criticism of mistakes committed during the period 
of personality cult" (Stalin). 
Another theme in the Butenko article is the assertion that the foreign 
policy of any Communist country must be stripped of purely national ihter-
ests and concentrated on a common foreign policy which proletarians in 
every country are obliged to support in the interest of "proletarian soli-
darity." 
As against this CPSU doctrine, Butenko cites as revisionist examples, 
the Yugoslav press and "Imre Nagy, a Hungarian revisionist." The reference 
to Nagy, Hungarian Premier at the time of the Hungarian rebellion, intro-
duces the familiar Soviet version of the uprising and its aftermath. In 
line with the CPSU propaganda on the subject, Butenko argues that Hungary 
would have fallen into the hands of the imperialists had the Soviet Union 
followed the five principles in this instance. 
In the economic field, too, Butenko claims that the five principles 
must be superseded by considerations of "strengthening the economic positions 
of socialism (communism) in other countries and in the entire world." That 
is, according to Butenko, the Soviet economic domination of Eastern Europe 
should be viewed in the light of the whole Communist bloc economy in its 
relation to capitalist economies. 
,Backgrounding this pert of the Butenko article was a significant eco-
nomic development that took place in May, 1958, a fortnight before Khrushchev 
visited Bulgaria. This was a conference of representatives of Communist 
regimes belonging to the Council of Economic Mutual Assistance, known as 
Comecon or CEMA. 
(Comecon was set up in 1949 as the Soviet answer to the Marshall Plan. 
It called for close integration of the economies of the USSR and the 
satellite states. Yugoslavia is not a Comecon member. Comecon meetings 
held in 1958-1959 stressed another objective: specialization by members 
of the Soviet bloc in industrial production, in order to avoid competitive 
output between the bloc countries.)

Chapter Fourteen 
The Comecon communique, issued on May 25 at the end of a five-day 
session, called for closer economic-military planning among all members of 
the Sino-Soviet bloc and implied an intensification of the bloc trade-and-
aid offensive in less-developed countries: The aim is to increase the de-
pendence of underdeveloped countries on bloc markets and, eventually, to 
open the way to Communist political penetration. 
Butenko concludes that even outside the Communist bloc, the principles 
of national independence should be considered as purely nationalistic, un-
less associated with Communist bloc interests. National rights, says Butenko, 
must be subordinated to the interest of the Communist struggle on a worldwide 
scale. If Soviet interests are served, the national struggle is "progres-
sive"; if they are not, the nationalistic movement is "regressive" or reac-
tionary. 
"It is known," declares Butenko, "that at the present time, nationalism 
plays a progressive role under the banner of the struggle against imperial-
ism and colonialism in a number of countreis (India, Egypt, Indonesia, and 
others). However, each time when nationalism was fostered by the exploiters 
with a view of dividing the toilers, it invariably performed a reactionary 
role. National communism caters precisely to such reactionary aims." 
The virtual repudiation of the five principles of peaceful coexistence 
in inter-bloc relations and their tactical espousal in Soviet propaganda for 
the outside world, is of concern to uncommitted nations, for if they fall 
within the Soviet orbit, they are immediately subjected to another and dif-
ferent interpretation of the five principles, justifying force by an inter-
vening Communist regime.

SOME CONCLUSIONS 
Despite the Soviet Communist Party's position of power and influence 
in the USSR, the organization is faced with a number of actual and poten-
tial problems. 
It has been suggested, for example, that Soviet youth, the third 
generation to experience the realities of Communist rule, is bored and 
restless to a degree causing veteran party officials to worry consider-
ably about the future. 
Edward Crankshaw, the noted British analyst of Soviet affairs, says 
the whole youth picture is complicated by the attitudes of those who were 
very young when the Stalin era ended in 1953. 
"They mere school children, Pioneers or very junior Komsomol members 
when Stalin died," Crankshaw comments. "And very soon they were suddenly 
told that this great leader and teacher, this being, quasi-divine, had 
feet of mud and had committed abominable crimes. With this came new oppor-
tunities for freedom of expression and, at the same time, comparative mate-
rial abundance. They wanted desperately to believe in something ? prefer-
ably the swift fulfillment of Lenin's ideals, of which Khrushchev was always 
talking. But what did Khrushchev offer them? On the political side the 
spectacle of dog-fight between one Kremlin faction and another, and a sus-
tained exhibition of inspired opportunism; on the side of self-expression 
a very sharp reminder, early in 1957, that the party still knows best in 
everything; on the ideological front, the Hungarian spectacle, and; for 
Ideals, a stone." 
Premier Khrushchev's 1958 announcement of a new program of less formal 
schooling and more physical work for the rank and file of Soviet young 
people appeared to be at .least partly motivated by the party's awarenessof 
the points raised by Crankshaw. Aside from the obvious intention to 
strengthen the party's ideological controls over youth, the Khrushchev 
program promised to provide vitally-needed increases in the Soviet labor 
force. 
It has long been apparent, in view of the party's continued emphasis 
on heavy industry, that Soviet workers were going to be called upon for 
higher and higher rates of productivity in the years to came. 
Proceedings of the CPSU's 21st congress, held in late January and 
early February of 1959, merely served to underscore the party's recent 
emphasis on the necessity for a stepped-up economic pace. As Khrushchev 
and other speakers pointed out, one of -the party's principal future tasks 
is to stimulate the USSR's rate of industrial and agricultural production.

Chapter Fifteen 
Khrushchevls new seven.year-plan, indeed, accounted for most of the 
official agenda of the congress. 
It has been known for some time, of course, that Khrushchev is 
publicly committed to a kind of international prestige gamble; he has 
staked communism's economic reputation on its ability to match or out-
produce the democratic powers. 
There are several reasons for the Soviet Party's new emphasis on 
making the USSR a showplace of Communist economic achievement. One is 
that the Soviet bloc countries have long been at a disadvantage in living 
standards compared with other nations. For reasons of prestige, there-
fore, it has become advisable to press harder for observable results. 
A suggestion of the problem's urgency, as an ideological issue) is 
contained in an observation made a few months ago by a young Chinese-
speaking Soviet citizen who has been much in demand as interpreter for 
Soviet delegations visiting China and for Chinese delegations visiting 
the USSR. "It is very embarrassing," this interpreter confided to the 
writer Robert C. North, "to show the Chinese through our country. They 
go around, looking, and don't say a mord. Then, suddenly one of them.will 
say something like this: 'Well, Camrades, you Russians have had socialism 
for forty years. Haw does it happen that you are still living like this?"' 
A second reason for the CPSU's apparently increasing concern with 
economic matters is that the party's ultimate success or failure depends 
upon its ability to provide a satisfactory living standard for the 
peoples of the USSR. The people cannot help but judge the party by the 
material results of its policies. 
The CPSU's future leadership pattern is another matter of consider-
able interest and conjecture. A frequently raised question: Will the 
role of Khrushchev, or his successor, develop more and more toward new 
forms of the Stalinist "cult of personality" or will there be a reversion 
toward the theoretical but never realized concept of "collective leader-
ship"? 
On the international front, signs of strain already have been noted 
in the CPSUls relationships with the Chinese Communist Party, although 
these have been smoothed over, at least outwardly, in public declarations 
of fraternal solidarity. The question of each individual party's right 
to its awn "road" in the "building of communism," however, is expected 
to be a continuing hazard to Soviet ideological supremacy. The CPU's 
running feud with the Yugoslav Communists has served to focus the atten, 
tion of all parties on the issue of orthodox (Soviet) vs. national com-
munism.

SOME CONCLUSIONS 
- 99 - 
In Eastern Europe, the 1956 Pblish and Hungarian uprisings brought 
into the open a number of questions which have caused heated debates in 
Cammunist circles, particularly within the CPSU's higher levels. The 
main issue here, one which is reported to have contributed to the split 
between Khrushchev and the "anti-party" group in 19572 appears to be 
basic: Can the CPSU liberalize its intra-bloc controls without running 
the danger of widespread disaffection or outright rebellion? In other 
words, can the party survive in its present form without the Stalin-
like colonial disciplines of the past? 
Mbanwhile the Soviet Communist Party is always faced with the task 
of implementing its historical mandate to sponsor a world revolution. 
Whether in the tactical guise of "peaceful coexistence" or in the actual 
day-to-day leadership of Communist parties in other countries, this 
Leninist objective must always be at the heart of long-range party stra-
tegy or the whole raison dletre of international communism will be in 
danger of withering away. 
As primary tools in the international campaign, the various organized 
Communist parties have an estimated total membership of 31.6 millions, 
roughly 28 millions of these located in the Soviet Union, Communist China 
and other copntries of the Sino-Soviet bloc. 
Internationally, Communist party representatives work both overtly 
and covertly through a system of espionage linkages, diplomatic, commercial 
and cultural missions, and front organizations such as "peace committees", 
women's and youth groups. Pressures of various sorts are regularly applied 
to trade unions and occupational entities -- teachers, lawyers, journalists, 
scientists, etc. Propaganda -- printed, broadcast and mord-of-mouth, is 
constantly employed. 
It should be noted that the CPSU's international strategy has tended, 
in recent years, to emphasize what is known as a "quest for legitimacy." 
This is the theory that it is more expedient, under certain conditions, for 
revolutionary Communist parties to play down the use of violence in their 
control efforts, seeking instead to build up their strength in national 
legislatures, and to prepare the ground in other ways before making their 
moves for power. Part of this approach, of course, is vigilance in the 
spotting of opportunities to divide non-Communist countries from within 
and to disrupt their defensive groupings. 
Mbthods of this kini might be called part of Lenin's famous "zig-zag" 
policy. The founder of Soviet communism once said: "The strictest loyal-
ty to the ideas of communism must be combined with the ability to make all 
the necessary practical compromises, to 'tack,' to make agreements, zig-
zags, retreats and so on, in order to accelerate the ()party's) coming in-
to power."

Chapter Fifteen 
Lenin's basin thinking on the strategy of world conquest is strongly 
reflected in the modern Communist line as spelled out in the famous ]2 
partydeclaration of November, 1957. 
This declaration, issued after a Moscow meeting of those party leaders 
most apeely associated with the Soviet Communist bloc, makes it clear that 
the non..miolent or "parliamentary road to communism" is only a tactical 
approach for use in special situations. When resistance is encountered, 
the declaration adds significantly, "the possibility of non-peaceful 
transition to socialism (commusism) must be borne in mind."

An Annotated Chronology of Key CPSU Developments From 1917 to 1959 
(This chronology is restricted to matters most directly 
related to the Soviet Communist Party's structural and 
ideological development.) 
November 7, 1917  
Lenin's Bolshevik Party gained control of the Russian government in a 
coup based on skillful organization of its minority forces, a successful 
campaign to neutralize military units stationed in the capital city of 
Petrograd (now Leningrad), and a shrewd exploitation of the chaotic con-
ditions created by World War I. 
(The government overthrown by the Bolsheviks was a provisional multi-
party administration elected eight months earlier, after Czar Nicholas II 
was deposed by the spontaneous popular uprising known as the "February" 
revolution. This provisional government, according to plan, was to surrender 
its power to a Constituent Assembly. That body, as the supreme authority in 
Russia, was to draft a constitution and establish a new form of government 
on a permanent basis. Despite its short-lived existence, the provisional or 
"Kerensky" government made substantial progress in the introduction of 
democratic reforms; it abolished all class distinctions, disbanded the Czar's 
secret police, proclaimed freedom of press and assembly, and took action to 
end discriminatory measures against national minorities.) 
November 8-9, 1917  
In the first hours of its newly-achieved control, Lenin's party ordered 
the confiscation and redistribution to peasants of large Russian land holdings. 
Some non-Bolshevik publications were suspended, although a promise was made 
that freedom of the press would be restored when the new order had been con-
solidated. 
(In later years, the party changed its early views on land rights, 
introducing collectivization and moving steadily toward the concept that 
farmers, under a system of state ownership and control, should be treated 
In much the same way as industrial workers. Similarly, Lenin's promise of 
a free press was discarded as undesirable and impractical in a Communist 
system.) 
Note: All dates in this chronology, in keeping with current practices in the 
Soviet Union, are based on the Gregorian calendar adopted in 1918. 
This advances all 1917 anniversaries by 13 days and explains why the 
October 25 Bolshevik revolution is now listed as having occurred on 
November 7.

November 25, 1917 ' 
Russian citizens, in what was to be their first and last opportunity 
to cast ballots for non-regime candidates, voted four to one against the 
Bolsheviks in an election of delegates to the long-awaited Constituent 
Assembly. This parliamentary assembly, whose election had been scheduled 
long before the Bolshevik coup on November 7, was supposed to organize a 
permanent, representative type of Russian government. 
(Although Lenin had committed himself to a free election, he imme-
diately charged "falsification by bourgeois .elements" when the voting went 
so heavily against the Bolsheviks. "The crisis in connection with the 
Constituent Assembly," he asserted in what proved to be a prophetic state-
ment, "can be settled only in a revolutionary way, by revolutionary measures." 
On January 18 and 19, 1918, Bolshevik troops dispersed the Constituent 
Assembly.) 
December 20, 1917 
The Bolsheviks organized their own secret police organization, called 
the Cheka. This disciplinary and security force, under a succession of 
names, was to become a fixture in the Soviet Communist Party structure 
(Its creation also constituted one of the Bolsheviks' most notable early 
reversals of reform programs introduced by the liberal provisional govern-
ment a few months before.) 
December 31, 1917 
The Byelorussian Congress, representing the hopes for self-rule of 
some seven million Byelorussians, was dispersed by Bolshevik forces, al-
though the Bolsheviks had previously agreed that various national groups 
would be granted the right to secede from Russia proper. 
On the same date, the Bolsheviks made one of their first moves in the 
direction of atheism as an official policy by legalizing a civil ceremony 
on a gar with the traditional religious wedding rite. 
January 18-192 1918 
The Bolshevik Party made its final break with representative government 
by-ordering military guards to disperse the just-convened Constituent Assembly, 
because this body, in which the Bolsheviks were a minority, refused to accept 
Lenin's ultimatums. This action ended the last hopes of many Russian liberals 
that the totalitarian pattern of the two-month-old Lenin regime could be 
reversed, or at least altered to accomodate the views of non-Bolshevik 
political parties. 
February 10, 1918 
The new regime repudiated all financial obligations incurred by the 
previous Russian government.

conducted without the seriously ill Lenin. 
December 5, 1923 
Leon Trotsky openly attacked Stalin and his supporters by demanding 
greater democracy within the party and an end of the organization's repressive 
methods., 
January 16-18, 1924  
At the 13th Party Congress, Stalin accused Trotsky and his followers of 
"deviating" from Lenin's conception of party unity. The Stalin faction 
asserted its opposition to the principle of democratic discussion.

January 21, 1924  
Lenin died after a long illness, intensifying the competition among his 
would-be successors. 
October 21-23, 1926 
Stalin ended his association with Zinoviev and Kamenev, the three having 
formed a ruling triumvirate during Lenin's illness. Zinoviev and Kamenev, 
along with Trotsky, lost their high party positions. 
December 2-19, 1927 
The 15th Communist Party Congress found the Stalin faction in control. 
The Trotsky faction was banished, Trotsky himself later being exiled and 
ultimately assassinated. 
October 1, 1928 
A new era of heavy emphasis on industrialization and collectivization 
of the USSR began with announcement of the first Soviet five-year plan. 
November 10-17, 1929 
A conflict within the Communist Party's Central Committee ended with the 
expulsion of Bukharin and several sympathizers. The expelled group had 
advocated a more conciliatory policy toward Russian peasants balking at 
Stalin's collectivization measures. 
1929-32 
This was a general period of collectivization emphasis. The party, 
under Stalin's leadership, moved rapidly to consolidate its political and 
economic controls. Heavy pressure was applied against peasants and others 
accused of resisting Communist policies. (Stalin told Winston Churchill, 
years later, that 10 million people had died as a result of the forced 
collectivization program in the USSR.) 
December 1, 1934 
Sergei Kirov, recognized as one of Stalin's staunchest supporters, was 
assassinated. 
August 19-24, 1936 
The Stalinist purge of party leaders reached a peak of intensity with 
the execution of 16 veteran party officials. The victims included Gregory 
Zinoviev and Leon Kamenev, who with Stalin had comprised a ruling triumvirate 
for a period before and after Lenin's death.

December 5, 1936  
Adoption of the new Soviet constitution helped to consolidate the party's 
centralized control over Russia, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, 
Armenia, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, Tazhikstan, Kazakhstan and Kirghistan. 
January 23-30, 1937  
The second major purge trial resulted in death sentences for 13 more 
veteran Communist party leaders, including the noted economist Yuri Pyatakov 
and former Central Committee Secretary Leonid Serebryakov. Four others, 
among them the Comintern secretary Karl Radek, were imprisoned and deprived 
of their "political rights." (On December 19, 1937, it was disclosed that 
eight more party leaders had been executed.) 
June 12, 1937  
The continuing party purges struck at the highest levels of the Red 
Army. Marshal Tukhachevsky and seven other top generals were executed, 
along with undisclosed numbers of their subordinates. 
March 2-12, 1938  
In the third major purge trial, 18 high-ranking party members were sen-
tenced to death and several others were imprisoned. Those executed included 
veteran revolutionaries Alexei Rykov, Nikolai Bukharin, Nikolai Krestinsky, 
and H. G. Yagoda, the former secret police chief. 
The purge sentences, 1936-1938, were only a minute fraction of the 
victims whose numbers ran to tens of thousands at all levels of the party 
and military services, in addition to a vast multitude of persons in no 
way connected with the party or the military. Every constituent republic 
and autonomous area was affected. 
May 3, 1939 
V. M. Molotov was named Commissar of Foreign Affairs. He replaced 
Maxim Litvinov, who was dismissed after 18 years of service. 
1939-45  
The events of the World War II period, notable for a general emphasis 
on patriotic nationalism, are not summarized in this chronology because they 
pertain more to national than party history. Toward the end of this period, 
it is true, the party's post-war plans for annexing its present satellites 
in Eastern Europe began to be apparent. Other significant developments of 
the war years included military absorption of the Baltic states and a vast 
prOgram of?deportation for various ethnic groups of the USSR on charges they 
had engaged in "treasonable" activities. A number of republics, such as the 
Crimean and Chechen-Ingush, were wiped out even as nominal entities in a 
general drive for centralized control by the Communist party apparatus.

to azcept the Soviet Communist Party's ideological domination. 
April 27, 1949  
The Soviet Congress of Trade Unions, meeting after a lapse of 17 years, 
acknowledged that all labor activities in the USSR were subject to regulation 
and control by the Communist Party. 
October 5-15, 1952  
The 19th Soviet Communist Party Congress, the first in thirteen years, 
produced a recommendation that Communist parties in other countries should 
associate themselves with "national" movements as a means of advancing the 
objectives of international communism. The party also supported plans for 
continued emphasis on heavy industry. 
March 5, 1953

the basic Communist cultural doctrine of "socialist realism." 
December 15-26, 1954  
The second congress of Soviet writers was marked by criticism of the 
"gray flood of colorless, mediocre literature pouring from the pages of our 
magazines and flooding the book market." 
February 8, 1955  
Malenkov resigned as Soviet Premier, to be replaced by N. A. Bulganin, 
a move reported as stemming from Nikita Khrushchev's opposition to Malenkov's 
"soft" line on heavy industry. On the sitme eventful day, V. M. Molotov made 
a serious ideological slip by stating in a speech before the Supreme Soviet 
that the Soviet Union was in a process of building socialism. This 
contradicted the CPSU position on the growth of communism. Later, after 
being subjected to sharp criticism, Molotov admitted in a public confession 
that he had made a "theoretically and politically dangerous" mistake. 
May 27, 1955  
Khrushchev and Bulganin arrived in Belgrade in an effort to smooth over 
the party's past differences with Tito. 
February 24, 1956 
Khrushchev, in a sensational 20th Party Congress speech, denounced 
Stalin as a tyrant and murderer whose "personality cult" had damaged the 
party's program. This speech, followed by a "de-Stalinization" campaign 
in the USSR, had serious repercussions throughout the international com-
munist movement. It was never, however, published in the Soviet Union.

The Italian Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti demanded that Soviet 
officials explain why they had been unable to stop Stalin's excesses. 
Togliatti's statement reflected the widespread ideological concern which 
Khrushchev's February speech had created in the minds of party followers 
in many countries. 
June 30, 1956  
The Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee condemned the "cult of 
personality" which had developed under Stalin but warned against criticism 
of the Communist system itself. 
September 3, 1956 
Soviet party leaders sent special instructions to Communist officials 
in the satellite countries, warning against adoption of viewpoints similar 
to Tito's "many roads" of nationalistic approach to the building of com-
munism. 
October 19-21, 1956 
In a series of warnings prompted by evidences of rebellion in Poland, 
Soviet Party Chief Khrushchev warned the Poles that "if you do not obey we 
will crush you" and Pravda accused Polish leaders of "shaking the founda-
tions of Communism." (The Poles remained firm at this time. As one result, 
Soviet Marshal Rokossovski was ousted from his position in the Polish 
Politburo and removed as Polish minister of defense.) 
October 23 - November 4, 1956  
The Soviet Communist Party's right to dominate the USSR's Eastern 
European satellites was challenged again, this time by a spontaneous nation-

use of Soviet troops and armor in an assault beginning November 4. (This 
action produced world-wide criticism of the Communist party and resulted 
in heavy membership and prestige losses throughout the world.)

March 12, 1957 
Soviet Communist leaders condemned the concept of "national communism" 
and warned satellite countries that obedience to Moscow was required. 
March 30, 1957 
Khrushchev, in what proved to be the first of a series of moves to 
stimulate Soviet industrial productivity, disclosed a plan to reorganize 
the national economy. He proposed to overcome bureaucratic stagnation in 
central control ministries by establishing a substitute network of regional 
economic organizations. (Khrushchev's decentralization program was promptly 
approved by the central committee and became a key part of the party's 
campaign to boost productivity levels.) 
April 19, 1957 
The Soviet regime declared a moratorium on state bonds valued at 
260,000,000,000 rubles. This fund was frozen for 20 years, with complete 
repayment not scheduled until 1997. The bonds had been sold to citizens 
of the USSR through a system of "voluntary" subscriptions over a period of 
years. (Khrushchev had disclosed the forthcoming action on April 8.) 
July 3, 1957 
Public announcement was made of a new purge of top-ranking party members, 
following reports of serious dissension within the Central Committee. Prin-
cipal victims were former premiers V. M. Molotov and Georgi Malenkov, to-
gether with the veteran economic expert Lazar Kaganovich and former Pravda 
editor and foreign minister Dmitri Shepilov. They were accused of "anti-
party activities." Marshal Zhukov, reportedly as a reward for supporting 
Khrushchev against the party leadership, was made a full member of the 
Presidium. (Premier Nicolai Bulganin later was downgraded and charged with 
membership in the previously purged "anti-party" group.) 
August 28 1957 
A new warning to Soviet writers, some of whom had evidenced liberal 
tendencies in the post-Stalin period, was sounded with publication of three 
Khrushchev speeches centered around the party's decision that all Soviet 
literature must reflect strict adherence to Communist policies. 
October 26, 1957 
Marshal Zhukov was dismissed as Soviet defense minister. (In the anti-
Zhukov propaganda campaign which followed, the former Soviet military hero 
was accused of having resisted the party's efforts to control the armed 
forces. Although not linked with the "anti-party" group, Zhukov was removed 
from his briefly-held Presidium post and relegated to official obscurity. 
The occasion also was used as a means of stressing the party's intention of 
tightening its ideological controls throughout the Soviet military organi-
zation.) 
HISTORICAL HIGHLIGHTS 
November 14-19 1957 
Communist representatives from various countries gathered in Moscow 
for large-scale celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik revo-
lution (November 7), held meetings to discuss the party's international 
strategy. These sessions produced a 12-party declaration (which Yugoslavia 
refused to sign) and a "peace manifesto," the general tenor of which was to 
assert the Soviet Communist Party's ideological primacy as organizer and 
leader of the international communist movement. 
March 27, 1958 
Nikita Khrushchev replaced Nikolai Bulganin as premier, thus becoming 
the first Communist leader since Stalin to head both party and government 
in the USSR. (Four days later Bulganin was made chairman of the USSR's state 
bank.) 
April 22-24 1958 
Soviet ideological pressure became a major issue at the Yugoslav Com-
munist Party Congress in Ljubljana. President Tito and other Yugoslav 
officials condemned current Moscow criticism as a "senseless" return to the 
policies of 1948, when Yugoslavia was ousted from the Cominform. Communist 
countries of the Soviet bloc, meanwhile, had boycotted the Yugoslav congress 
because the Yugoslav party's draft program was at variance with Soviet 
Interpretations of Marxism-Leninism. (Early in May, the Chinese Communist 
Party followed up Soviet denunciations of Yugoslavia's independent policies 
by beginning a series of sharply-worded condemnations. The Peiping People's  
Daily, for example, accused the Yugoslays of revisionist actions "aimed at 
splitting the international Communist movement" and of persisting in their 
nationalist views in opposition to the Moscow party declaration of the 
previous November.) 
May 28, 1958 
Yugoslav sources disclosed that the Soviet Union had postponed for five 
years the granting of previously agreed credits to Yugoslavia amounting to 
285 million dollars. This, it was charged, was an attempt to punish Yugo-
slavia for its refusal to accept the Soviet Communist Party's ideological 
leadership. 
September 5, 1958 
Former Premier Bulganin, who on August 15 had been removed from his 
state bank position and made chairman of the remote Stavropol regional 
economic council, was ousted from the CPSU presidium. (On November 12, 
Premier Khrushchev disclosed that Bulganin had been an original member of 
the 1957 "anti-party" group.)

September 21, 1958 
Khrushchev announced a new party plan to increase the Communist con-
sciousness of Soviet young people. This proposal, endorsed by the Central 
Committee in November, called for less formal schooling and more work in 
factories and on collective farms. Too many young people, Khrushchev 
declared, were apathetic toward the building ofqcommunism. 
October 23, 1958 
Announcement that Boris Pasternak had been awarded the 1958 Nobel prize 
for literature posed a major literary policy problem for Soviet party offi-
cials. Pasternak's most famous work, the novel "Dr. Zhivago," had been banned 
in the USSR as a worthless and malicious work which "rejected" the achieve-
ments of communism. The party solved the problem by expelling Pasternak from 
the Soviet Writer's Union, attacking him as a slanderer and threatening him 
with exile. (Pasternak's resultant refusal to accept the Nobel award, how-
ever, failed to diminish the wave of adverse criticism which Soviet handling 
of the Pasternak case created throughout the non-Communist world.) 
December 13, 1958 
First Secretary Alexei Surkov of the Soviet Writer's Union, told the 
Russian Republic's writers' congress that because a number of writers had 
been "disoriented" by the Pasternak affair, closer ideological surveillance 
of Soviet literature would be maintained "from now on." 
January 27 - February 5, 1959 
The 21st Soviet Communist Party Congress endorsed Khrushchev's new 
seven-year plan for boosting national economic production rates, along with 
other decisions already adopted by the Central Committee. The Congress 
also featured a number of speeches denouncing members of the "anti-party" 
group along with confessions of complicity by Mikhail Pervukhin and 
M. Z. Saburov. In a final resolution, the Congress stated its agreement 
with disciplinary measures against the "anti-party" group already taken 
by the Central Committee.

(CPSU refers to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; CP refers to 
any Communist Party.) 
ACTIVIST ,(activ),-- a member of a group or organization furthering CP 
programs. Activists may or may not be Communists but they 
promote Communist objectives along specific lines. Normally, 
the term refers to leading CP cadres. (See Cadres) 
AGGRESSION -- according to the Dictionary of the Russian Language, the 
"armed attack by one or several imperialist countries against 
other countries with a view to the occupation of their 
territories, their forcible subjugation and the exploitation 
of their people." In line with the distinction in Communist 
ideology between "just" and "unjust" wars, Communist regimes 
are never considered to be aggressors. (See War) 
AGITATOR -- in a Communist state, a CP - trained person, usually a party 
member, engaged in "exhorting the people" to meet production 
norms, support the party's policies and programs, etc. In non-
Communist countries a Communist agitator may incite unrest, 
promote strikes for political ends, etc. An agitator deals 
with specific and generally local issues, while a propagandist 
spreads broad Communist principles and doctrines, (See Propaganda) 
ANTI-PARTY -- a term of opprobrium, meaning contrary to the precept of 
democratic centralism. (See Democratic Centralism) 
APPARATUS (apparat) -- the party machine or administrative core, which 
cofiliari?the operational functions of the party. It may also 
refer to a regional party component. The apparatchiki (CP 
functionaries) in general are concerned with internal party 
management. (See also Democratic Centralism) 
ATIEIST -- an unbeliever. In Communist theory, a party member must profess 
disbelief in a Deity, accept the "materialistic world outlook," 
and actively work against religious faith in the people. (See 
Dialectical Materialism; Religion) 
BOLSHEVIK -- a member of the extreme revolutionary wing of the Russian 
Social Democratic Party headed by Lenin, which led the Bolshevik 
Revolution of November 1917and in1918became the All-Russian 
Communist Party (bolsheviks).. 
BOURGEOIS -- a derogatory adjective, associated in Communist usage with 
"survivals" of "reactionary" sentiments under communism. Applied 
to non-Communist countries, "bourgeois democracy," "bourgeois 
nationalism," etc. are invidious terms. 
BOURGEOISE -- the property-owning middle class, considered to be the enemy 
of communism. (See Capitalism; Marxism) 
S. 
GLOSSARY 
- 115 - 
CADRES party members who form the basic staff or hard core of the 
CP at any level and in every field of party organization. 
They are chosen for reliability and competence in their own 
fields. (In Communist China, cadres are not necessarily CP 
members.) 
CAPITALISM -- the social, political and economic antithesis of communism, 
which was treated at length in its historical development by 
Marx and Engels. Technically, it is an economic system in which 
the ownership of land and natural wealth, and the production, 
distribution and exchange of goods are effected by private 
enterprise under competitive conditions. In Communist usage, 
the words "capitalism" and "capitalist" are always linked with 
the "exploitation of oppressed workers." (See Communism; 
Proletariat) 
CAPITALIST ENCIRCLEMENT -- a dictum set forth by Lenin and echoed by Stalin, 
based on the belief that capitalist states have the aim of en-
circling and destroying the USSR as the center of world communism. 
In recent years the phrase has passed out of Soviet usage, replaced 
by the propaganda expression "aggressive circles" which are 
pictured as seeking war. (See Peace; War) 
CELL -- smallest organized unit of a CP; in countries where the CP is 
outlawed, party cells exist as undercover units. 
CHAUVINISM (See Nationalism; Great Power Chauvinism) 
COEXISTENCE -- a Communist premise current since Lenin, often repeated by 
Stalin and Khrushchev, usually as "peaceful coexistence," that 
is, rivalry between the "two camps" -- capitalism and communism 
-- which avoids actual hostilities. An eventual resort to war 
is not ruled out by Communist theorists. (See Peace; Peaceful 
Coexistence; War) 
CLASSLESS SOCIETY -- a Marxist tenet assuming that with the triumph of 
communism, the State will "wither away" and all class distinctions 
will be abolished; this has not happened under any Communist 
regime, but in theory would be possible after all othei. conditions 
for a Communist society had been achieved. (See Marx) 
CLASS STRUGGLE -- a postulate of Marxism-Leninism, which argues that in 
capitalist society there are two principal classes -- the 
bourgeoisie and the proletariat, or "exploited workers." From 
this situation, Communists posit a class struggle, ending in 
victory for the workers. (See Bourgeoisie; Dictatorship of the 
Proletariat)

COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP -- a term referring to decisions taken by the 
"collective whole" (Pravda, April 16, 1953) at meetings of CP 
committees, especially the CPSU central committee, as against 
"single-handed management" (Party Life, April 1956), that is, 
dictatorial decisions by a CP leader. (See Cult of Personality; 
Democratic Centralism.) 
COLONIALISM -- a term with a special invidious meaning, referring to areas 
or countries whose people do not enjoy full sovereignty and are 
under some form of administration by "imperialisepowers. The 
hegemony exercised by the USSR over Eastern Europe is not considered 
colonialism by Soviet definition. (See Imperialism) 
COMINFORM -- an abbreviation of Communist Information Bureau (1947-1956), 
an organization of representatives of the Communist parties of 
the USSR, five satellite states, France, Italy, and Yugoslavia 
(expelled in 1948), to afford party line guidance to other 
Communist parties. There is no present counterpart of this 
organization, but a group of CP representatives publish the 
World Marxist Review in Prague, which indicates the party line 
that should be followed in international communism. 
COMINTERN -- abbreviation of Communist Third International (1919-1943), 
an international CP organization, established to further Communist 
objectives wherever possible on a worldwide basis. 
COMMUNISM -- originally, in Marxist-Leninist theory, a state of society 
pictured in the slogan: "From each according to his abilities; 
to each according to his need." Lenin assumed that the transi-
tion from capitalism to communism would be socialism, or the 
"common ownership of the means of production and the distribution 
of the product according to the work of each." This would be the 
period of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" (which see). 
Lenin and Stalin envisaged a high productive and industrial base 
for the creation of a Communist society. Stalin initiated this 
program in a series of Five Year Plans. (See Collectivization; 
Five Year Plans; Norm) 
COMMUNIST MANIFESTO -- the public declaration of communism and its aims, 
issued by Marx and Engels in 1848, centered about the slogan:

imposed for various crimes or misdemeanors, ranging in'severity 
from exile or confinement in forced labor camps to penal labor 
in the home community. 
CRITICISM, SELF-CRITICISM -- an important party technique re-emphasized by 
the 19th CPSU Congress (1952): an obligation of party members to 
"develop self-criticism and criticism from below, to expose and 
eliminate shortcomings in work, and to fight against a show of 
well-being and against being carried away by success in work"; 
also applied to exposing the shortcomings of Marxist parties anal 
other workers' organizations. 
CULT OF PERSONALITY -- a term denoting autocratic party rule by a party 
head (Stalin), contrary to the principle of collective leadership. 
Khrushchev at the 20th Party Congress charged that Stalin en-
couraged the cult of personality. (See Democratic Centralism; 
Collective Leadership) 
CULTURE, SOCIALIST -- in the generalized sense, the development of arts 
and sciences under communism, with a Marxist-Leninist content. 
The negative form, uncultured or ill-mannered (nekulturny), 
refers to public behavior contrary to Communist social norms. 
(See Formalism; Socialist Realism; Subjectivism) 
DEMOCRACY -- a word used in a special sense by Communists, usually with a 
qualifying adjective. Thus, "bourgeois democracy" refers to the 
parliamentary system in non-Communist states, in contrast to the 
"highest form" -- "Soviet democracy." A transitional form is 
"people's democracy," referring to the Communist-controlled regimes 
of Eastern Europe. The adjective "democratic" connotes adherence 
to, or sympathy with, the principles of Marxism-Leninism. (See 
also Progressive) 
DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM -- a phrase coined by Lenin to describe one-
party rule,centralized in a small, dedicated leadership. In 
theory, the controlling element, the party's central committee, 
is chosen through an elective process by party organizations at 
various levels, from lowest to highest. Decisions of the central 
committee are then binding on the lower bodies. (See Leninism) 
DEVIATIONISM -- a term meaning to stray from the straight course of the 
party line. In Stalin's day there were "right deviationists" 
or "rightists" -- party members who favored permanent political 
coalitions with Socialist parties, etc. -- and "left deviationists," 
party members who were too inflexible in their views. Today the 
epithet is appli0 principally to parties or groups that do not 
acknowledge the primacy of the CPSU, such as the Yugoslav Communists.

GLOSSARY 
DIALECTICAL MATERIALSIM -- a basic concept of Marxism-Leninism: the 
economic interpretation of history and social phenomena. 
From this comes the "materialistic worlioutlook," enjoined on 
Communists, which rejects ethical or spiritual causation. 
Dialectical materialism combines two Marxist concepts: (1) that 
the material world alone possesses reality; and (2) that 
progressive changes occur in nature and society as a result of 
conflicts between opposing or contradictory forces or elements. 
(See Marxism) 
DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT -- the cornerstone of the Marxist-Leninist 
doctrine, involving the "class struggle" between the organized 
workers or proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Marx pictured the 
proletarian dictatorship as taking place during the period of 
"revolutionary transformation" from capitalism to communism. 
(See Marxism; Leninism; Proletariat) 
DIVERSIONIST -- originally a saboteur, but now taken to mean an alleged 
agent of a foreign power or sympathizer with a non-Communist 
state, operating in a Communist regime; sometimes an epithet de-
scribing party members who lend themselves to such activities. 
(See also Trotskyism) 
DOGMATIST -- a disparaging term for one who harbors the idea that 
Marxism-Leninism constitutes a body of fixed principles which 
supplies a ready-made solution to every problem under communism; 
in general, one who lacks flexibility in meeting new problems. 
(See also Objectivism; Party Spirit) 
EGALITARIANISM (EQUALITARIANISM) -- a term originally applied to the 
Marxist principle: "From each according to his abilities, to 
each according to his needs." For a brief period after the 
Bolshevik Revolution, Lenin tried to establish equality of wages 
for all kinds of work, but soon found that lack of money incentive 
resulted in loss of production. Stalin denounced "equalization" 
as a "piece of reactionary petty-bourgeois absurdity." Elimination 
of the Marxist concept has resulted in a wide spread between the 
incomes of the lowest-paid workers and Soviet elite groups. 
FIVE-YEAR PLANS -- a series of state planning operations conducted by the 
Soviet Government, starting in 1928 w hen Stalin initiated the 
first Five Year Plan, together with collectivization. In 1959 the 
Government launched a Seven Year Plan. Under state planning, each 
branch of state administration has specified goals which it must 
meet over defined time intervals. Overall responsibility for pre-
paring and checking the execution of the national plan is con-
centrated in the State Planning Commissibn or Gosplan. (See 
Collectivization; Norm; Socialist Emulation; Stalinism)

GLOSSARY - 119 - 
FORMALISM -- a word usually applied to cultural attitudes, meaning 
contrary to the party doctrine of "socialist realism." A 
formalist is one who is more concerned with the form of 
culture than its social significance, or who practices "art 
for art's sake." (See Socialist Realism) In another sense, 
a formalist is one who fails to adjust his work and conduct 
to party criticism. (See Dogmatism) 
FRACTIONALISM -- a word defined as the "appearance of groups with 
special platforms and with the ambition to form in some degree 
a unit and establish their own group discipline" (within the 
party). (See Democratic Centralism) 
FRONT, POLITICAL -- a political coalition, including the Communist Party 
as an element. Earlier fronts were generally termed "popular 
fronts," that is, alliances with Socialist or Labor parties; 
recently, the emphasis has been on "national fronts," or coalitions 
with nationalist parties. Use of the word to mean a Communist-
controlled organization, such as the World Peace Council, is not 
Communist terminology. 
GREAT POWER CHAUVINISM -- by Communist definition, the "national politics 
' of the bourgeoisie of a dominating nation which is exploiting 
and oppressing other nations." The expression in general is 
limited to theoretical discussions. (See Bourgeoisie; Capitalism; 
Colonialism) 
HOOLIGANISM -- activities of youthful trouble-makers, who are guilty of 
public misbehavior ranging from rowdyism to more serious offenses, 
IMPERIALISM -- in Leninist theory, the final development of the capitalist 
system, frequently associated in the context of colonialism. (See 
Capitalism; Colonialism; Leninism) 
INTELLIGENTSIA -- the educated and professional groups or class; under 
communism, considered an important element of the CP -- "one 
of the active builders of communism" (CPSU pronouncement, March 
23, 1959). 
INTERNATIONALISM -- in acceptable Communist usage often referred to as 
"proletarian internationalism," of which the Third (Communist) 
International (Comintern) was an early expression. Soviet News 
stated in 1950: "An internationalist is not one who verbally 
recognizes international solidarity or sympathizes with it. A 
real internationalist is one who brings his sympathy and recogni-
tion up to the point of practical and maximum help to the USSR 
and support and defense of the USSR by every means and in every 
possible form." This definition rules out the Socialist interna-
tional, which is not committed to support and defend the USSR. 
(See Comintern; Proletarian Internationalism)

GLOSSARY 
KOLKHOZ -- Russian language abbreviation for collective farm, a "self-
governing" peasant cooperative, in which the land technically 
belongs to the state but its use is reserved to the collec-
tive farm members. Collective farm workers are required to 
give a large proportion of work-day labor on the communal land, 
usually 100 to 150 work-days annually. Farm women are usually 
required to work less than men (100 to 150 work days) and men may 
put in as much as 300 work days. (See Work-Day) Most equipment 
used by the collective is communally owned, but kolkhoz members 
have small private plots which they work with manual tools. 
Produce from the individual plots may be sold on the free market. 
Collective farm products are purchased by agencies of the state. 
Since 1957, collective farms have been acquiring power machinery 
from the machine tractor stations (MTS), which formerly per-
formed machine operations on a contract basis. 
KOMSOMOL -- Russian language abbreviation for the Young Communist League, 
an organization of about 20 million members which indoctrinates 
young people in the theory and practice of communism. Komsomol 
members also perform various other services furthering CP 
programs and policies. 
KULAK (lit. "fist") -- a term of abuse current during the collectivization 
drive of 1929-1934, referring to well-to-do peasants, especially 
those who hired day labor. Later, the term referred to any 
peasants who opposed Soviet agricultural policies. (See Collec-
tivization) 
LENINISM -- generally used as Marxism-Leninism, the "one and only ideology 
of the USSR" (Pravda, April 22, 1951). Lenin adapted and ex-
panded the theories of Marx and Engels, giving them practical 
application based on the October Revolution. He also developed 
the principle of the Communist Party as a "militant staff of the 
working class" in its "vanguard role." He initiated single-
party (Bolshevik) control of the government in the guise of 
"democratic centralism." In the realm of dialectics, Lenin 
projected Marx's theoretical analysis of capitalism to its 
modern or "imperialist" phase, which he considered to be the 
final stage of capitalism. (See Capitalism; Communism; Democratic 
Centralism; Imperialism; October Revolution; Vanguard) 
LIBERALISM -- a word with an invidious or acceptable meaning, depend-
ing on the context. As an element in "bourgeois morality," 
Communists disparage liberalism, but not if it is linked with 
pro-Communist groups or movements; thus, "progressives, liberals, 
and Communists" (cf. Cominform Journal, June 1951). (See 
Democracy; Progressive)

GLOSSARY - 121 - 
LIBERATION -- a word in frequent Communist use, denoting the liberation 
of colonial peoples from "imperialist" rule, or the liberation 
of peoples such as those in Eastern Europe, from capitalism. 
A common expression is the "liberation of the countries of the 
people's democracy from fascist oppression." (See People's 
Democracy) 
MARXISM -- the revolutionary socialism of Marx and Engels, which was given 
concrete illustration in the Communist Manifesto. The basic con-
cepts of Marxism include the class struggle; the materialistic 
interpretation of history and social phenomena; and the analysis 
of capitalism as exploitation of the workers. (See Bourgeoisie; 
Class Struggle; Communism; Communist Manifesto; Dialectical 
Materialism; Dictatorship of the Proletariat; Workers) 
MASSES -- the great body of the people; the working people as dis-
tinguished from the organized workers or proletariat. ,(See 
Proletariat) 
MORALITY -- in Communist usage, a word with two specific meanings, i.e., 
in reference to "bourgeois morality" or ethics derived from 
religious beliefs, and "Communist morality," based on Marxism-
Leninism. The Short Philosophical Dictionary states: "From the 
point of view of Communist morality, 'moral' is only that which 
facilitates the destruction of the old world and strengthens the 
the new Communist regime." 
NATIONALISM -- a concept having various meanings in Communist usage. 
Thus "bourgeois nationalism" is the self-determination of a 
bourgeois state, which may be supported by the USSR if it 
furthers Soviet foreign policy or weakens the capitalist world. 
In recent years, national movements in the less-developed 
countries have been supported by the Soviet Government as a 
means of opposing or thwarting "imperialists." On the other 
hand, "national socialise or an independent form of communism, 
within the USSR or in the satellite states, is considered 
inadmissable. (See Deviationism) 
NORM -- the quota of individual output or work performance required as 
a minimum in a given period of time, tied in with wage levels 
calculated on the basis of norms. Failure to fulfill the 
designated norm results in pay deductions. (See Socialist 
Emulation; Stakhanovite)

GLOSSARY 
NEUTRALISM -- a word with various shades of meaning in Soviet theory and 
usage, not identical with "neutrality," which is a situation of 
fact. The Large Soviet Encyclopedia refers to neutralism in 
trade unions as "an opportunist theory towards the political 
struggle of the proletariat, widely spread in capitalist countries 
by reactionary leaders." Strictly speaking, Marxism-Leninism, 
asserting the dogma of the "two worlds" (capitalism and socialism), 
excludes neutralism in international relations. In practice, 
however, Soviet policy is to favor neutralism in some uncommitted 
countries in the belief that these may be open to Communist 
influence. (See Imperialism; War) 
OBJECTIVISM -- according to the Short Philosophical Dictionary: "Any 
explanations of the necessity and laws of the historical process 
which justify and praise the capitalist system and conceal 
bourgeois views with a pretended 'theoretical absence of party 
spirit (partiinost)." Objectivism, if charged against Communist 
historians, philosophers, etc., is a serious accusation. (See 
Bourgeois; Dia/ed!.tical Materialism; Party Spirit) 
OCTOBER REVOLUTION -- the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, headed by 
Lenin, on November 7, 1917. The difference in date is due to 
the fact that in Russia the Old Style calendar was in use until 
the Gregorian calendar was adopted by the Soviet Government in 
1918. (See Bolsheviks) 
OPPORTUNISM -- a charge leveled against moderate Socialists, non-Communist 
trade unions, and political parties favoring "reformism," or the 
acceptance of social advances short of Communist revoluelonary 
goals. 
PARTY LINE -- the official CP policy or pronouncement an any subject at 
any given time, which is binding on all party members. (See 
Democratic Centralism) 
PARTY SPIRIT (partiinost) -- usually applied in cultural fields, as an 
"inalienable condition of socialist realism.. .Its realization in 
practice is the expression of the interests of the toiling masses." 
(Large Soviet Encyclopedia). Party-mindedness in the arts and 
literature reflects CP attitudes toward all cultural and creative 
activities. (See Socialist Realism) 
PEACE a word usually linked in Communist propaganda with the objectives 
of the Soviet bloc -- the "peace camp" -- as against those of the 
"imperialists." The peace theme is the stock-in-trade of Communist 
front organizations, such as the World Peace Council. (See 
Front; War)

GLOSSARY - 123 - 
PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE -- an international situation postulated in 
Communist theory as the continuing existence, without 
armed ctinflict, of the two "camps" -- communism and capital-
ism. However, the idea of temporary peaceful coexistence 
of the two systems is stressed as a tactic. At no time do 
Communists publicly state that permanent coexistence is 
possible or likely; on the contrary, they maintain that 
peaceful coexistence is only a provisional truce in the 
"inevitable conflict" between the two systems, according to 
the dictum of Lenin, in which the triumph of communism is 
inevitable. Thus the tactical endorsement by Communists 
of the principle of peaceful coexistence goes hand in hand 
with the Leninist assumption that lasting peace will come 
about only when the entire world has fallen under communism. 
(See Coexistence;Peace; War) 
PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY -- a term attributed to Stalin to describe the 
Communist-controlled regimes of Eastern Europe. In Soviet 
theory, a people's democracy is an intermediate form of 
government between parliamentary "bourgeois democracy" and 
"Soviet democracy," which is considered the highest form of 
workers' government. (See Bourgeoisie) 
PETTY BOURGEOISIE -- the lower middle class, viewed by Communists in 
some underdeveloped countries as a possible ally in national 
fronts against conservative parties and groups. 
POLITBURO -- originally the political bureau of the CPSU central 
committee. In 1952 the designation was changed to presidium. 
Many Communist parties outside the USSR retain the name 
politburo. 
POPULAR -- a laudatory term, meaning communistic or deserving of Com-
munist support; applied to group movements, political aims, 
or regimes. (See Democracy; Progressive) 
PROGRESSIVE -- like the word "democratic," associated with pro-Commu-
nist groups or movements. It has a special meaning in con-
nection with norms. A "progressive norm" is a unit of pro-
duction within a given period of time, achieved by "advanced 
workers" or "innovators" who set the pace for the average 
workers. (See Norm; Socialist Emulation)

GLOSSARY 
PROLETARIAN INTERNATIONALSIM -- before the Bolshevik Revolution,sig-
nified the international solidarity of workers, aimed at the 
overthrow of capitalism; after the Revolution, proletarian 
internationalism in addition called for the sur port of the 
Soviet State by the world labor movement and support of the 
world labor movement by the "toilers of the USSR." (See 
Dictatorship of the Proletariat) 
PROLETARIAT -- defined by Marx and Engels as the class of workers 
brought into existence under the capitalist system, whose 
members do not own property or the means of production. They 
are pictured as a class to be organized and led by the CP 
for Communist political purposes. (See Bourgeoisie; Capital-
ism; Dictatorship of the Proletariat; Marxism) 
PROPAGANDA -- In Communist usage, the word has wide theoretical and 
functional application, including (1) the systematic indoctri-
nation of the people under communism in Marxism-Leninism; (2) 
the use of all media of communication, education, and culture 
for the same purpose; (3) support of numerous agencies and 
organizations in and outside of the USSR for spreading Commu-
nist principles and attacking capitalist countries. Communist 
front organizations are a common medium serving the last-named 
objectives. A propagandist, according to the Political  
Dictionary, engages in the "intensive elucidation of the 
writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, and of the history 
of the Bolshevik party and its tasks." 
PURGE -- a word adapted from the idiom of fascism and Nazism, not a part 
of Communist terminology but, in practice, the elimination or 
liquidation of opposition elements within the party or state. 
? (See Democratic Centralism; Party Line) 
REACTIONARY -- a term with a wide range of derogatory meanings; thus, 
"bourgeois reactionaries" are opposed by "progressive, demo-
cratic" forces. (See Bourgeois; Deviationism; Diversionist; 
Progressive) 
REALISM (See Socialist Realism) 
RELIGION -- according to Marx, the "opiate of the people." Since 
religious faith denies the Marxist materialistic interpreta-
tion of history, Communists consider religion an inveterate 
enemy of communism. Members of the CP are required to sub-
scribe to atheism and to further atheistic indoctrination of 
people living under communism. (See Atheism; Marxism) 
GLOSSARY - 125 - 
REFORMISM (See Opportunism) 
REVISIONISM -- as used by the CPSU, the term refers to an ideological and 
political movement among the Socialist, Marxists, and Communists, 
seeking to revise certain dogmatic teachings of Marx, which were 
later expounded by Lenin and Stalin as immutable "laws," to be 
followed unflinchingly by all Communists and their sympathizers 
inside and outside the Communist orbit. Applied to Communist 
culture, it is a critical word, stigmatizing CP dissidents who 
do not follow the CPSU interpretation of Leninist cultural doc-
trine, especially as regards socialist realism. (See Socialist 
Realism.) 
REVOLUTIONARY -- in Soviet usage refers to one who "without arguments, 
unconditionally., openly and honestly without secret military 
consultations, is ready to protect and defend the USSR, since 
the USSR is the first proletarian revolutionary State in the 
world that is building socialism." (Stalin, Collected Works) 
(See Stalinism; Trotskyism) 
SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM (See Communism) 
SECTARIANISM -- refers to evangelical Christian sects in the USSR as 
distinguished from the Orthodox Church. In Science and Life, 
1950, V. G. Sokolov called for a "systematic ideological 
struggle against the anti-scientific reactionary ideology of 
sectarianism." While the Soviet Government tolerates the 
Orthodox Church, the CPSU campaigns actively against sectarian 
denominations. (See Religion) The term also applies to other 
forms of deviationism in the Communist movement. 
SELF-CRITICISM (See Criticism, Self-Criticism) 
SOCIALIST EMULATION -- a term used in connection with increasing pro-
ductivity, usually in industrial plants; also, a movement to 
encourage rank-and-file workers to raise individuals output by 
competition with pace-setters called "innovators" or "advanced 
workers." The same principle is invoked in "socialist 
competition" -- competition between "work brigades" in the 
same plant, or between plants producing similar goods, to see 
which reaches production targets first, or exceeds production 
quotas. (See Five Year Plans; Norm; Stakhanovite) 
SOCIALIST REALISM -- defined in the Large Soviet Encyclopedia as a 
"means of reflecting life in art peculiar to socialist society. 
It demands the true portrayal of reality in its revolutionary 
development. The problem of literature is the truthful and 
profound delineation of a new people, creators of socialist 
society, and of their fight for communism." An article in 
Bolshevik, May 15, 1948, stated that "socialist realism

establishes as the basis of artistic creations not the subjective, 
arbitrary ideas of the writer, but his detection of objective 
reality." In practice, this concept has resulted in a vast output 
of mediocre works. (See Culture, Socialist; Formalism; Subjectiv-
ism) 
SOVKHOZ -- a farm, usually of large dimensions, operated as state enter-
prise, where the farm workers are paid in cash on a work-day basis 
and do not share collectively in profits. (See Kolkhoz; Work-Day) 
SOVIET -- Russian language word for council. In the USSR there are soviets 
at all levels, from villages to cities. The Supreme Soviet of 
the USSR is an elective body which in theory legislates for the 
Soviet Union. (See Democratic Centralism) 
STAKHANOVITE -- from the Donbas miner Stakhanov, who in the period of the 
early five-year plans produced above-average quantities of coal 
and taught other miners his method. Pace-setters in industrial 
plants were known by his name until the speed-Up system fell 
into temporary disrepute; they are now called "innovators" or 
"advanced workers." (See Norm; Socialist Emulation) 
STALINISM -- CPSU policies and practices associated with J. V. Stalin. 
Two leading principles of the party which Stalin initiated were 
(1) "socialism in one country," that is, establishing communism 
in the USSR without rely.Ing on a world revolution; (2) the 
nationalities policy, whereby nationality groups composing 
major population elements in union republics, especially the 
non-Russian republics, form states that are "national in form, 
socialist in content." Following Khrushchev's speech at the 
20th Party Congress in 1956, Stalinism became a term of re-
proach. (See Cult of Personality; Nationalism; Trotskyism) 
SUBJECTIVISM -- personal views or writings which conflict with the 
Marxist-Leninist doctrine that the material world exists in 
all its aspects as "objective reality." (See Socialist 
Realism) 
TROTSKYISM -- commonly used as a term of abuse, derived originally from 
the divergent theories of Stalin and Trotsky, the latter arguing 
that world revolution should be promoted as an aid to establishing 
communism in the USSR. Trotsky insisted that a "permanent 
revolution" was a prerequisite to the establishment of a 
Communist regime, and that this was a necessary condition for 
building socialism in the Soviet Union. He also advocated wide 
discussion within the party on measures proposed by the top 
leadership. Trotskyism in general connotes Communist heresy, 
or refusal to accept the primacy of the CPSU in international 
communism. (See Deviationist; Party Line; Stalinism)

VANGUARD -- used generally in the phrase "vanguard role," meaning the 
assumption of leadership by the Communist Party in guiding 
revolutionary workers toward communism and, where communism 
has been established, determining the structure and policies 
of the "workers' state." (See Democratic Centralism; Lenin-
ism; Proletariat) 
WAR, COMMUNIST THEORY OF -- according to the Soviet Diplomatic Dic-
tionary: "Lenin recognized two kinds of war, imperialist 
wars, and therefore unjust, and wars of liberation, and 
therefore just." The Marxist-Leninist view that "imperial-
ist" states are by nature aggressors and a Communist State, 
by definition, is peace-loving, does not exclude the possibil-
ity of a "preventive war" by a Communist regime. The epithet 
warmongers" refers to the dogma that "capitalist ruling 
circles" are always plotting to attack Communist States.

and economic principles, and its ability to organize and 
establish a socialist society. (See Dictatorship of the
