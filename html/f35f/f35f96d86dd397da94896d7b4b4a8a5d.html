 U. S. -SOVIET  RE L A T I ONS
 FORD, KISSINGER STATEMENTS, SALT               GET MOSCOW ATTENTION
 The issues of detente and U.S.-Soviet relations have reemerged
 as focal points of Soviet reportage and comment as Moscow
 media took note of recent statements by President Ford and
 Secretary Kissinger and provided customary editorial send-offs
 for the opening of the UN General Absembly session and the
 resumption of the SALT talks.  While with one exception--an
 article by G.A. Trofimenko on SALE in the USA journal, discussed
 below--Moscow refrained from extensive comment on any of these
 events, it treated them in a way seemingly carefully calculated
 to avoid jolts to the delicate process of developing good
 relations with the new U.S. Administration.
 FORD, KISSINGER      Moscow's treatment of the recent series of
 STATEMENTS           statements by President Ford and Secretary
 Kissinger--the President's press conference on
 the 16th, his UN address on the 18th, his speech in Michigan on
 the 23d, and the Secretary's UN address on the 23d--suggests it is
 still observing a "honeymoon" relationship with the new Administration.
 Despite several openings which these statements offered for Moscow
 propaganda exploitation, it has confined itself largely to straight
 reporting or paraphrasing of the original statements.  Even the
 President's remarks regarding the question of the CIA's involvement
 in Chile elicited little more than passing notice by Moscow
 commentators.  The same can be said for the President's and
 Secretary's warnings to the oil-producing nations in their speeches
 on the 23d.  Although Moscow has begun to replay adverse Arab
 reaction to the statements, particularly in broadcasts beamed to
 the Arab world, it has refrained from originating any critical
 comment of its own on the subject.
 This cautious treatment of the new Administration comes against a
 background of renewed emphasis in Soviet comment on the optimistic
 themes which Moscow habitually associates with the United Nations
 and SALT.   IZVESTIYA on the 19th carried a self-congratulatory
 editorial hailing the socialist countries' contribution to bringing
 about the favorable trends in international relations which, it
 said, were "continuing and deepening."  The Moscow observers round-
 table program on the 22d discussed the opening of the SALT talks in
 a similar vein.  Hailing the achievements thus far, one commentator
 predicted that progress in the talks should promote "in an even more
 fundamental way" an improvement of the international climate.

 SALT     The major Soviet comment on SALT was a major article
 by G.A. Trofimenko in the September issue of the USA
 journal which has Just become available in translation.   It is
 apparent the article is intended to be a persuasive and
 reasonable presentation of the Soviet viewpoint regarding the
 conceptual framework which should govern the search for
 solutions.  Although the article argues in moderate terms
 and is shot through with an optimistic outlook, it presents a
 frank critique of American viewpoints which are said to pose
 obstacles to agreement.  Among the views criticized is what is
 described as an American penchant for defining national
 interests in terms of a zero-sum game--a Soviet loss is an
 American gain.  Another is Secretary Schlesinger's "retargeting
 doctrine," which the article disparages as a bluff intended to
 exert psychological pressure, on the grounds that such subjects
 are not discussed in public by responsible officials.
 Finally, in an apparent reference to Secretary Kissinger's reported
 effort in March to persuade the Soviets to accept the concept of
 "throw-weight" as a principle for negotiating limitations on
 offensive missiles, it deplores the practice of "American
 theoretician." to propose a "purely American model of a solution .    .
 which is at radical variance with the traditions and principles
 of the military-technological policy of the other side."

 FORCE  REDUCTION  TALKS
 MOSCOW, ALLIES REMAIN ADAMANT IN REJECTING NATO'S PROPOSALS
 The spate of comment prompted by the convening of the fourth
 round of the Vienna force reduction negotiations on 24 September
 maintained the public standpat attitude of Moscow and its allies
 that rejects both NATO's draft proposals as a basis for
 negotiations as well as the pessimistic Western press views
 about an alleged state of "paralysis" in the talks.
 Soviet comment following the 17 June recess of the third round
 had stressed that-the East's position was "the same" as outlined
 in the original November 1973 proposal.  This assessment was-given by
 the Eastern bloc's main spokesman, Warsaw's T. Strulak, in an
 interview with PRAVDA's Vienna correspondent I. Melnikov published
 on 5 August.  During the recess Soviet comment routinely. rejected
 one aspect after another of NATO's draft proposals, with Vladimir
 Komlev in the weekly NEW TIMES (No. 30) for the first time in Soviet
 media publicly rejecting various NATO proposals made in the
 "informal talks" outside the formal plenary sessions.  Repeating
 Moscow's strong criticism of the West European states and Canada
 for not making a firm commitment along with the United States and
 the socialist states to reduce their forces, Komlev declared that
 it is "essential for the talks to result in a clear definition of
 the extent of the force and arms reduction for each party to the
 agreement" on the basis of "agreed d-~adlines."  Tnen alluding to
 the informal talk;,, Komlev said:   "Nor is the situation changed
 by certain clarifications which, according to Western press reports,
 the NATO countries have made to their position, since the essence
 of this position remains as before."
 Updating the Pact's public adamant position, Prague's CTK on
 24 September reported Czechoslovak delegate Klein as telling that
 day's plenary meeting that "the Western concept ignores the
 principle of equality of the participants and therefore cannot serve
 as a basis for a future solution."  Despite this view, Moscow
 commentators have made a concerted effort to refute, as stated by
 TASS observer Goncharov on the 24th, the "exaggerated pessimism"
 expressed in the West over the progress of the Vienna talks.   They
 have noted that although there has been no meeting of minds on the
 two sides' basic proposals, the talks have made possible detailed
 discussions of these proposals in a businesslike atmosphere.

 CSCE LINK TO MBFR    Evidence that Moscow is marking time in
 Vienna until it clearly sees prospects for
 a successful conclu^ion to the Geneva C SCE negotiations was again
 readily apparent in Fc?reign Minister Gromyko's speech to the
 UN General Assembly on the 24th.  Gromyko made a lengthy, moderate
 assessment of the CSCE negotiations; said the USSP, "attaches
 primary importance" to their successful completion, the "number
 one question in European political life today"; and then added
 a brief passage on the force reduction talks..  The TASS account
 quotes Gromyko as saying the USSR "also" believes it important to
 achieve results in Vienna, and that any agreements must be based
 on "strict observance by all of the rule of undiminished security
 for each side," the standard Moscow formulation.
 Gromyko carefully avoided an explicit linkage of the Vienna talks
 to a successful CSCE conclusion, unlike CPSU Politburo candidate
 member and secretary Ponomarev, who did so in a rare Soviet
 leadership statement on 10 June.*  Gromyko instead followed the more
 general position of calling for a conclusion of the CSCE and
 declaring that it then would be easier to solve other outstanding
 questions.  At the unofficial level, however, IZVESTIYA political
 observer Matveyev, in the Moscow radio international observers
 roundtable program on the 22d, was more direct than Gromyko, point-
 ing out that the successful conclusion of the CSCE "without a doubt
 will help bring about favorable progress" at the Vienna talks.
 U.S. AIRLIFT CAPABILITY     A unique aspect of the comment during
 the summer recess has been the unusual
 stress on the significance of NATO's strategic airlift capability.
 This was discussed in detail in August in a three-part series of
 articles in RED STAR by Professor Colonel Relov, a commentator who in
 recent years has repeatedly discussed in the Soviet military paper
 U.S. air warfare doctrines and capabilities.  Although he did not
 explicitly mention the force reduction talks, Belov made clear, in
 discussing the U.S. "dual-basing" system and the series of recent
 Reforger exercises, that the U.S. aim was to demonstrate to its NATO
 allies "the possibility of rapidly building up the bloc's armed
 forces" in the event of "'emergency circumstances."'  Belov stopped
 short of stating the obvious conclusion his readers would reach:
 i.e., the Soviet military leadership must take into consideration the
 U.S. potential for rapidly sending troops and armaments to the
 European theater when comparing Warsaw Pact and NATO forces.

 COMMUNIST RE LATI0NS
 PRAVDA, IZVESTIYA CITE BLOC SUPPORT FOR IDEOLOGICAL DRIVE
 Moscow's current revivalist drive for enhanced ideological vigilance
 and communist morality, launched by the CPSU's decree on the Belorussian
 party organization summarized in PRAVDA on 30 August, has assumed
 bloc-wide dimensions, judging by recent articles in PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA.
 The PRAVDj arti-le, on 14 September, provided a roundup of articles from
 the leading party journals of Moscow's orthodox East European allies
 and Mongolia, all calling for an intensification of the ideological
 struggle.   IZVESTIYA on 12 September carried an article by the deputy
 director of Czechoslovak television warning against complacency on
 the ideological front in the era of detente.  Earlier evidence that
 the bloc parties undertook some coordination on the current ideological
 campaign was afforded by the prompt and extensive reporting of the
 CPSU decree in the main party dailies of  the orthodox East European
 countries.   In this respect, the current campaign is reminiscent of
 the bloc-wide reemphasis on ideological struggle and policy coordination
 which followed the Crimea meeting of bloc leaders in July 1973.
 PRAVDA ROUNDUP     The PRAVDA roundup, entitled "The Force of the
 Ideas of Socialism" and written by a former PRAVDA
 Peking correspondent, M. Domogatskikh, was unusual both for its focus
 on a single theme and for its blunt inference that the substance of
 the 30 August CPSU resolution had applicability for foreign communist
 parties as well.   Thus, after quoting the CPSU resolution to the effect
 that building a new society "and the ferocity of the ideological
 struggle in the international arena are making increasingly high
 demands on ideological activity," the review declared that "the enhance-
 ment of the role of ideological work is considered necessary in all
 fraternal parties."
 Without giving any indication of the dates of the articles selected,
 the PRAVDA roundup went- out of its way to highlight hardlining state-
 ments from the party journals of Poland and Hungary--countries which
 are usually less strident in the ideological sphere than the other
 orthodox Warsaw Pact members.   The PZPR's NOWE, DROGI was cited as
 declaring that the Polish party "resolutely opposes the chauvinist
 and antisocialist ideology of China's Maoist leaders" and that "Maoism
 directs its anti-Soviet spearhead against all socialist countries and
 against People's Poland's basic national and social interests."  The

 Budapest theoretical monthly TARSADALMI SZEMLE was quoted as under-
 scoring such themes as defense of the purity of Marxism-Leninism,
 V:Lntensification of Marxist propaganda," and "not least--close
 cooperation with other socialist countries and communist and workers
 parties."  The review also quoted the Hungarian journal as warning
 that "it would be shortsighted and naive to suppose that the enemies
 of our system have abandoned their designs" and as stressing the
 need to "expose anti-Marxist political concepts."
 Citations from Bulgaria's NOVO UREME, Czechoslovakia's ZIVOT STEANY,
 East Germany's EINHEIT, and the MPR's NAMYN AM'DRAL included standard
 tributes to the successes of the USSR's policy of peaceful  coexistence
 combined with warnings against slackening the international class
 struggle.  With Peking the obvious target, ZIVOT STRANY was quoted
 additionally as asserting that communists throughout the world are
 "exposing the hostile propaganda of imperialist ideologists and
 apostates of Marxism-Leninism who throw in their lot with them whatever
 disguise they might wear."  The Prague party journal was also rennr.ted
 as observing that "the new conditions" of the ideological struggle
 between the two world systems demanded greater internationalization
 and "new forms" of ideological activity by the fraternal parties.
 There was, however, no mention in the review of the proposed all-
 European and world conferences of communist parties.
 IZVESTIYA      The article in the 12 September morning edition of
 ARTICLE        IZVESTIYA by Czechoslovak television deputy director
 Milos Marko dealt more in specifics than the PRAVDA
 review, which adhered largely to generalities on the ideological
 struggle.  Thus the article, entitled "On the Fronts of the Ideo-
 logical Struggle:  The Only Correct Path," recalled that the December
 1973 Moscow conference of party secretaries had underscored the
 urgency of "a resolute rebuff to ideological sabotage and to attempts
 by aggressive imperialist circles to wreck the process of relaxation
 of tension."  Marko also cited Brezhnev's statement, in his 21 July
 speech in Warsaw on the occasion of Poland's 30th liberation anniversary,
 that "the communists' general line on questions of ideology is essentially
 a unified line."  Brezhnev had gone out of his way in his Warsaw speech
 to stress that the socialist community was based on "common ideology"
 and that the socialist countries' cooperation in ideology had been
 markedly intensified "in recent years."

 YUGOSLAVIA SENTENCES STALINISTS, CRITICIZES OUTSIDE SUPPORT
 Belgrade's handling of the publicity surrounding the exposure and
 sentencing of the group of pro-Soviet dissidents arrested last April
 reflects an effort to maximize the admonitory implications of the
 affair vis-a-vis Moscow without pushing the admonition to the point
 of endangering relations between the two countries.  A statement
 issued by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office on 20 September
 announced that 32 persons had been given sentences ranging from one
 to 14 years.  Like Tito's remarks on 12 September, the statement
 provided few details on the affair, particularly on the sensitive
 question of where the group received its outside support.*  Limited
 media comment provided little additional detail but harshly criticized
 the countries, unidentified, that "tolerated" the activities of the
 group.
 The public prosecutor's statement claimed that the aims of the "illegal
 group" were to organize itself "for hostile activity against the
 constitutional order" and to establish a rival political party.  Only
 two of the members--identified as the leaders--were named, one a
 pensioner, the other a professor.  That the group was subordinate to
 outside control was clearly implied in the statement's contention that
 they were "in contact with Cominformist emigrees working abroad against
 our country from whom they received orders and propaganda material."
 Media comment has been very limited, suggesting an effort by the regime
 to prevent the airing of critical remarks that might go beyond the
 party leadership's own criticism.  TANJUG provided the first response,
 a commentary issued immediately after the public prosecutor's statement;
 and an official League of Communists commentary was carried by KO,,MUNIST
 on the 23d.  Both provided few additional details on the case but
 emphasized the need for continued vigilance against "all" opponents
 of the regime and discussed the implications of outside support for
 the group.
 in a slap at bloc countries that harbor Cominformist emigrees, TANJUG
 called the toleration of these groups by other countries "unacceptable,"
 pointing out that "it is directed not only against our country but also
 against the basic principles on which international relations, cooperation
 and friendly relations among countries are based."  KOMUNIST was more

 critical, seeing the group's activity as not only "confirmation of
 the importance and desperation of the anti-Yugoslav Cominformists"
 but even more importantly also of the "bureaucratic-dogmatic people
 in the country who share its views." KOMUNIST also emphasized that
 such toleration endangered relations and cooperation between
 Yugoslavia and "the country from which such activity is pursu.ed."
 The party paper added that Yugoslavia would never tolerate such
 activity on its own soil, realizing that this "would lead to spoiled
 relations with these countries and to a spoiled international
 atmosphere in genera].."
 Belgrade's reproofs about too much publicity and speculation have
 clearly been aimed.at the West as well.  Reports about Soviet and
 Hungarian troops massing near the Yugoslav border as well as about
 the impending recall of Soviet, Czechoslavak and Hungarian diplo-
 matic envoys in Belgrade have been carried in the Western media.
 Tito himself warned against overdramatizing the case, and KOIi1TNIST
 cautioned Western media against "wishful thinking" a;,out deteriorating
 relations between Belgrade and Moscow.  The decision to go ahead with
 the long-scheduled "friendly official" visit of Soviet Army ChirL
 of Staff Kulikov from 17-23 September may have been intended it part
 to dispel such rumors.
 Moscow and orthodox bloc media have continued to ignore the affair,
 while maverick Romania, which also had reported Tito's 12 September
 speech, reported the sentencing of the group.

 USSR-IRAQ
 MOSCOW HAILS TIES WITH IRAQ, REAFFIRMS AID TO PALESTINIANS
 Moscow, commenting on the 18-22 September visit to the Soviet Union
 by Iraqi Foreign Minister S. Taqah, has used the occasion to praise
 the current state of "stable and successfully developing" Soviet-
 Iraqi relations while expressing its intent to strengthen coopera-
 tion in "political, economic, cultural, and other fields."  TASS
 on 21 September, reporting a meeting between Taqah and Podgornyy,
 stated that both countries also pledged to continue their aid and
 support to the Palestinian resi.stance movement.
 Moscow and Baghdad n. dia have not disclosed except in highly general
 terms what specific topics were discussed during Taqah's talks
 with Soviet officials who, in addition to Podgornyy, reportedly
 included V. Kuznetsov, first deputy foreign minister.  According
 to Iraqi sources, Taqah was also scheduled to meet with Brezhnev on
 19 September but for unexplained reasons apparently did not.   One
 probable topic was the continued fighting since last spring between
 Kurdish and Iraqi forces in northern Iraq and the implications of
 the conflict for Iraqi-Iranian-Soviet relations., Moscow radio's
 Arabic service on 20 September suggested that the Kurdish problem
 was indeed discussed by noting Taqah's visit and, reviewing the
 political context in which it was taking place, observing that in
 the past the USSR had praised Iraq's efforts to solve the Kurdish
 issue,  Asserting that "this has worried Iraq's enemies," the
 broadcast stated that Iraq could count on Soviet support in
 solving its problems.
 Another topic mentioned by the 20 September Moscow radio commentary,
 and described as "naturally" a subject of discussion, was "the
 Middle East situation" and the need for coordination o. Arab and
 Soviet policies, especially in regard to Israel.
 In an Arabic language commentary on 23 September Mosco'a radio
 suggested that Moscow and Baghdad may not have been in complete
 agreement recently on the Palestinian question.  Noting that certain
 Arab newspapers had been spreading "poisonous propaganda," the
 commentary singled out a specific issue--the Beirut AN-NAHAR on
 20 September--for publishing "lies hostile to the Arab cause
 concerning Soviet-Iraqi differences on the Palestinian cause."  Both
 this commentary and the Moscow domestic radio on 21 September, in
 reporting the Taqah-Podgornyy meeting, stated that both "the Soviet
 Union and Iraq intend to continue furnishing aid and support to the
 Palestine resistance movement, which they consider an integral part
 of the Arab national liberation movement."

 INDOCHINA
 RECENT FORD STATEMENTS DRAW ROUTINE RESPONSE FROM DRV: PRG
 DRV and PRG media routinely criticized the Administration's
 Foreign policy in low-level press and radio comment on President
 lord's speeches to the United Nations on 18 September and to
 the World Energy'Conference on the 23d.  The 18 September
 White House statement on American personnel unaccounted for in
 Southeast Asia drew official protests from the DRV Foreign
 hinistry spokesman. and a PRG delegation spokesman at the La
 Celle Saint Cloud consultative conference.
 Comment on the President's UN speech took his incidental
 reference to Indochina and his remarks on Secretary Kissinger
 as points of departure for castigating U.S. policy on Vietnam
 and denigrating Kissinger.  According to a 20 September NHAN DAN
 commentary, President Ford's speech constituted a "dull repetition"
 of Nixon's foreign policy and revealed a "vary wrong attitude"
 by the U.S. Government toward Vietnam and Indochina.  The commentary
 charged that the United States had "deliberately kept open the
 wounds of war" in Indochina by its aid to Saigon and Phnom Penh.
 Simi'arly, a QUAN DOI NHAN DAN commentary on the following 2
 labeled lord's remarks on Indochina a "deceitful statement"
 aimed at concealing the "aggressive" policies of the United
 States.  QUAN DOI NHAN DAN dwelt at length on Ford's statements
 in support of the Secretary of State, terming them a "lavish
 eulogy" of the "architect of the Nixon Doctrine" and characterizing
 Kissinger as a "cunning, crafty lackey" who has served "the
 most reactionary U.S. forces."
 Hanoi's continued sensitivity to charges that it is not cooperating
 .Ln accounting for missing U.S. servicemen was evident in the effort
 made in the 20 September foreign ministry spokesman's statement
 to discredit President Ford's appeal that U.S. teams be allowed
 to conduct the necessary searches.  In reacting to what it described
 as an accusation by the President that the DRV and PRG had itot
 responded to such appeals, the statement claimed this was a "brazen
 U.S. distortion" designed to "mislead" public opinion, to "conceal
 continued U.S. involvement and intervention" in South Vietnam, and
 to "conceal very grave systematic violations" of the Paris agreement.
 While not directly denying DRV unwillingness to agree to the search
 for the missing personnel, the statement attempted to give an
 impression that Hanoi was cooperating by maintaining that it had

 complied with the scheduled return of U.S. prisoners and the
 repatriation from the DRV of the remains of U.S. pilots who
 died in captivity.  Lack of progress in the search, the state-
 ment declared, was a result of U.S. and Saigon "sabotage" of
 the Paris agreement in other areas, namely the supplying of
 U.S. military aid to the GVN and Saigon's detention of "hundreds
 of thousands" of civilian PRG personnel.  DRV and PRG foreign
 ministry statements issued in August protesting U.S. aid to
 South Vietnam and the U.S. stand on its personnel missing in
 action similarly had charged the United States with a "campaign
 of slander" to shift the blame to The DRV for not implementing
 the Paris agreement in this regard.*
 LAO DELEGATION VISITS HANOI AT START OF TOUR SEEKING AID
 A delegation of the Lao Provisional Government of National Union
 (PGNU) visited North Vietnam from 15 to 18 September on its
 first stop in an aid-seeking mission which Vientiane media say
 will take a month and visit Peking, Pyongyang, and Algiers, as
 well as Hanoi.   The delegation was led by Minister of Economy
 and Planning Sot Phetrasi, a representative from the Pathet Lao
 side of the PGNU, and included Vice Minister of Transport
 and Public Works Houmphan Saignasit, an experienced Vientiane
 government official.  DRV Minister Dang Thi met and saw off the
 delegation, hosted a reception in its honor, and led the North
 Vietnamese side in discussions on economic and cultural cooperation.
 Dang Thi was not identified in his position as chairman of the
 Nation Reunification Commission, but it is possible that his
 responsibilities in that post for handling aid to South Vietnam
 qualified him to deal with the Lao negotiations.   (Prior to his
 appointment to head the Reunification Commission in April this
 year, Dang Thi was a minister in the Premier's Office and had
 held posts in planning and in scientific and technical fields.)
 The delegation was also received by Premier Pham Van Dong on
 17 September.
 According to Hanoi and Lao reports, four agreements were signed
 in Hanoi on 18 September, including an accord on DRV assistance
 to Laos in goods and materials.  Vientiane and Pathet Lao media,
 but not VNA, specified that the aid would be gratuitous and
 include fnod, medicines, and clothing.   Lao media also reported

 that one of the agreements provided for cooperation in building
 a road and a railway from Laos to the sea through DRV territory;
 VNA's report only mentioned the building of a road. The other
 two accords dealt with the shipment of goods through DRV territory
 and with the repair of Route 7 in Laos.  Vientiane noted that the
 latter protocol also covered transport of DRV goods to Laos during
 the 1974-1975 dry season.
 Hanoi "warmly acclaimed" the agreements in a NHAN DAN editorial on
 the 19th which suggested that DRV assistance was necessarily
 limited.  The editorial pointed out that North Vietnam still
 faced "many difficulties in the postwar reconstruction" and noted
 that the DRV people would "contribute to the extent of their
 limited potential."
 The Lao delegation left Hanoi on 18 September, arriving in Algiers
 on the 20th after passing through Vientiane and Moscow.
 DRV CHIEF OF STAFF DUNG CALLS FOR ARMY MODERNIZATION
 Hanoi's abiding concern about modernizing and improving its armed
 forces since the cease-fire was reflected in a talk by DRV Chief
 of Staff Senior General Van Tien Dung at a "recent" all-army school
 conference of cadres.  Dung, long a strong exponent of using main-
 force units employing the tactics of conventional warfare, presented
 a well-reasoned argument for building a professional army grounded
 in modern tr.chnology and trained in the technique of combat coordi-
 nation.  The first part of Dung's address was summarized in the
 August issue of the army journal TAP CHI QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, but
 no other portion has been made public.  No date for the cadre
 conference was given in the journal, but a 27 June Hanoi broadcast
 had reported that Dung, along with Colonel General Song Hao, had
 addressed a "recent" conference of military schools.
 Dung's remarks suggest continued Hanoi concern over the possibility
 of future direct U.S. military involvement in Indochina.  He
 warned not only of alleged U.S.-Saigon efforts to "sabotage" the
 Paris peace agreement but also that a "sizable U.S. force has been
 maintained outside Vietnam as a 7realistic deterrent force'."
 It is this set of circumstances, he asserted, that require constant
 "revolutionary vigilance" for all eventualities.

 25 SEPTEMBER 1974
 According to Dung, the tasks posed by this situation constitute
 "major, burning" problems of the armed forces whose solution must
 be consistent not only with DRV economic and industrial "realities"
 but with world scientific and technological development as well.
 Flatly stating that the VPA has not yet been "regularized and
 modernized," he called for creative application, throughout the
 country and the army, of the latest in scientific and technical
 knowledge so as to "quickly" increase national defense potential.
 While professing his allegiance to the importance of the political
 and moral underpinnings of a revolutionary army as "the most
 fundamental factor" in its combat strength, Dung made no bones
 about "other factors" that must be taken into account--namely,
 organization, weapons and equipment, and tactics.   He gave short
 shrift to organizational needs and dwelt at length on the "the
 very important" factor of weapons and equipment. Quo:-ing Engels
 to the effect that the military application of advanced technology
 can necessitate a total reorganization of the armed forces, Dung
 called for a recognition of this "objective law" in carrying out
 ''appropriate formulas" of leadership and command.
 In discussing the tactics a regular, modern army must employ,
 Dung's main concern was what he termed "coordinated combat
 tactics''--a theme he had developed in some detail in a talk at
 an all-army cadre class that was published in the December 1973
 TAP CHI QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.  In the earlier talk Dung had defined
 coordinated combat as taking place among all armed branches on
 different scales and claimed that this was exemplified during the
 campaigns of the 1972 "strategic offensive."  An army that is unable
 to coordinate in this manner, Dung argued in his current talk, is
 not yet a truly regular and modern force despite structure,
 organization, numerical strength and modern equipment.  Noting
 that a regular and modern army should be able to engage. in combat
 at various levels, Dung marie it clear that it is especially
 large-scale coordinated combat that he had in mind, sn.d he declared
 that such an army would be able to:
 Direct strategically significant, annihilating blows
 at the enemy; rapidly and noticeably change the
 balance of forces on the battlefield in our favor;
 and, together with all our armed forces and people,
 contribute to victoriously concluding the war.
 At another point, perhaps reflecting Hanoi's intention to follow a
 previously untried strategy in any future military escalation,
 Dung cautioned that campaigns should not be based on previously

 established patterns or "inflexible formula."  He added that
 large-scale coordinated attacks do not necessarily mean either
 the massive use of weapons to replace men or numerical strength
 to overpower the enemy.

 CHINA
 CHOU, CHIANG CHING GREET VISITING PHILIPPINE FIRST LADY
 Peking's keen interest in improved relations with the Philippines
 has been demonstrated by the unusually high-level welcome accorded
 Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos thus far during her China tour,
 dramatized by her reception by Chou Fn-lai at a hospital in Peking
 on 20 September, the day of her arrival.   While her visit is at
 Chou's invitation, the premier's last public appearance had been
 the Chinese Army Day reception on 31 July.
 Apart from Chou's "friendly" conversation, during which he wished
 her a warns welcome and extended his regards to President Marcos,
 she has received unprecedented attention from Chiang Ching who,
 as Mrs. Marcos' nearest protocol equivalent, has apparently assumed
 the role of co-hostess.*  Chiang met with Mrs. Marcos on the 20th
 for a "friendly" talk,,. escorted her to a concert in Peking on the
 23d, and was present on the 24th to guide her on a tour of Tientsin,
 the first time Chiang is known to have escorted a foreign visitor
 outside the Pelting area. Chiang's important role was underlined
 in a 23 September banquet speech by Vice Premier Li lisien-nien,
 who noted that Mrs. Marcos had been received by Chou "and Comrade
 Chiang Ching."  In addition, a 22 September NCNA account indicated
 Chiang's hostess role by stating that she had "entrusted" the
 State Council Cultural Group with presenting an opera soiree for
 Mrs. Marcos on the 22d.  Chiang's active  role may be further
 explained by cultural talks apparently conducted by the two sides.
 During her speech at the reciprocal banquet on the 23d, Mrs. Marcos
 emph,-isized that "growing contacts in the cultural and economic
 fields" are forerunners of stable and lasting relationships.
 As Mrs. Marcos' main host while in Peking, Li llsien-nien led
 Chinese officials at the airport welcome ceremonies, was present
 at her meetings with Chou and with Chiang Ching on the 20th,
 hosted a banquet in her honor that even-ng, and attended the
 Philippines' reciprocal banquet on the 23d.  Li also led Chinese
 officials at the z23 September signing of  letters for "further
 development of trade between China and the Philippines."  In his

 banquet remarks on the 20th,L i lauded recently increased delegation
 exchanges and expanded trade between China and the Philippines and on
 t'he 23d characterized the current visit as having achieved "positive
 results"  and added a "new page" to friendly bilateral relations.
 Li expressed confidence that relations would undergo "a new and
 greater development."
 When she left Peking for Tientsin on the 24th, Mrs. Marcos was
 accompanied only by deputy foreign ministers Han Nien-lung and
 Wang Hai-Jung, according to Peking radio.  After her arrival in
 Tientsin, she was joined by Chiang Ching, who accompanied her to
 a cultural performance, to a production brigade, and to a bicycle
 factory.  Mrs. Marcos also attended an evening banquet hosted by
 provincial chief Hsieh Hsueh-kung, but NCNA's 24 September report
 on the day's activities did not report that Chiang was present.
 PEKING SEES SHIFT IN ECONOMIC BALANCE TOWARD THIRD WORLD
 A 20 September PEOPLE'S DAILY article bluntly asserted that a change
 in the world balance of economic power has already taken place,
 citing as evidence recent efforts by the United States, the Soviet
 Union and developed Western countries to seek surplus capital from
 oil-producing, developing nations.  Last April, at the time of the
 UN conference on raw materials, Peking had described the oil producers'
 boycott and pricing moves as a "pioneering action" and had predicted
 that by such actions in the future the developing states could shift
 the balance of economic power more in favor of the third world.   The
 current article, signed by PEOPLE'S DATL'i commentator Jen Ku-ping,
 represents a measured advance from previous Chinese r,sessments.
 Peking thus far has maintained a discreet silence on recent U.S.
 efforts to redress the economic balance.  While Peking media have
 devoted unusual attention to the economic problems facing the Ford
 Administration,* they have thus far failed to report the President's
 recent addresses at the United Nations and at the Detroit World
 Energy Conference, or the 20 September U.S.-West European agreement
 on oil sharing.  A 23 September NCNA report on UN proceedings noted
 that Secretary Kissinger made a statement that day but avoided
 discussing its substance.

 25 SEPTEMBER 1974
 Characterizing the United States as a "swashbuckling dollar empire"
 that is begging for dollar9 from oil-producing countries, Jen's
 article was the first Peking acknowledgement of reported recent
 efforts by the U.S. Treasury Department as well as by private
 business to lure Arab oil capital. to the United States.   The Soviet
 Union came in for predictably harsher treatment as "even more
 jealous and covetous of the Middle East's oil dollars," and as
 being especially "insidious" in selling arms dearly in return for
 cheap oil during the October 1973 Middle East war.  Jen also called
 attention to investments of Middle East oil money in West Europe
 and Japan.
 Citing the new capital flow from oil producers to developed nations
 as proof of the "splitting" and "great disorder" in the international
 economic realm, the article went on to stress an unusally bleak
 assessment of the industrialized nations' economic woes.   It said
 the United States and other developed Western states are now
 struggling desperately amid "the most unprecedented economic
 confusion of the postwar period."  It cited particularly problems
 of inflation, production declines, capital shortages, mounting
 debts and "enormous balance of payments deficits."  The article
 added that Moscow faces similar problems.
 The Chinese have, however, given no indication they view changes
 in the economic balance as having an effect on the world strategic
 balance.  Recent PEOPLE'S DAILY articles timed to coincide with
 the reconvening of the SALT talks and East-West talks over European
 disarmament in Geneva and Vienna--including a lengthy 14 September
 commentary by Jen Ku-ping--have stressed the longstanding Chinese
 view that the United States and the USSR, despite economic and other
 problems, are determined to continue the arms expansion and strategic
 rivalry to sustain their dominant positions abroad.

 JCP-CPSU RELATIONS:  The Japanese Communist Party has finallly
 responded to an attack on it by Argentine CP leader A. Fava--reprint-
 ed in the May issue of the Soviet journal PARTY LIFE--with an
 unsigned article in the 15 September AKAHATA.  While the delay and
 the relatively low level of response suggest the JCP has no desire
 to broaden the polemics, the AKAHATA article did directly counter-
 attack against the CPSU, hinting at Soviet authorship of the Fava
 article and accusing the Soviet Union of grossly overestimating
 both its own role as a revolutionary force and the beneficial
 consequences of its detente with the United States.  Condemning
 the CPSU and the CCP equally for interfering in JCP internal
 affairs, AKAHATA maintained that both parties had destroyed the
 unity of the international communist movement.  Finally, reaffirming
 the JCP stand that the Southern Kuriles were rightly Japanese
 territory that had been unjustly seized after World War II,
 AKAHATA made public the text of a 1959 JCP-CPSU agreement which
 indicated the Soviet Union would be willing to consider returning
 the territory once specified developments had taken place in
 Japan's domestic structure and foreign policy.  The Fava article
 had bitingly criticized the JCP demand for return of the northern
 territories as without foundation and "unprecedented in the
 history of the international communist movement."
 PRC-GREECE:  Reflecting the continuing Chinese interest in encourag-
 ing Western unity against Moscow, Peking's sparse comment on the
 new Greek government has played up Athen's pro-West initiatives
 while softpedaling coverage of last month's anti-U.S. riots and
 decision to withdraw from NATO's military structure.  Peking
 coverage of the riots and decision to withdraw has been limited
 to passing notice in a 5 September domestic radio "currei.t events
 talk"  which reviewed events surrounding the Cyprus crisis and
 carefully pointed. out Athens' continuing political membership
 in NATO.  NCNA subsequently highlighted cne revived EEC-Greek
 ties in a 17 September report that the Common Market had agreed
 to Athen's request to revive Greece's associate status with the
 EEC.  NCNA noted that the decision will release EEC aid funds
 for Greece frozen following the 1967 military coup, and it played
 up the French prime minister's recent pledge to use French
 influence to help Greece join the Common Market as a full member.

 U.S. ROLE IN CHILE:  Soviet and Cuban follow-up reportage and
 comment on President Ford's 16 September press conference remarks
 on CIA activities relater to Chile reflect divergent treatment,
 the Soviet central press still avoiding direct attribution of the
 coup to official U.S. policy in its own comment while Cuban media
 directly accuse and condemn the President.   At the same time,
 Soviet media have replayed strongly critical U.S. and Chilean
 remarks, including a 23 September TASS English report that
 Allende's widow, Hortensia Bussi de Allende, holds "Henry
 Kissinger, assistant to the U.S. President for national security,
 responsible" for approving CIA expenditures in Chile.  By
 contrast, there was no mention of Kissinger or President Ford
 in a V. Matveyev IZVESTIYA article on the 20th that condemned
 the "sinister operations" of "U.S. intelligence and other
 departments" aimed at overthrowing Allende.  Matveyev was
 implicitly critical of the President's remarks justifying the
 CIA role in Chile, observing that the CIA role could not be
 dismissed by,,,"sophistry" or "any reference to the United States'
 alleged 'state interests."'  Havana radio's initial reaction
 on the 18th claimed that "U.S. complicity" in Allende's over-
 throw "has been confessed by the current Yankee President,
 Gerald Ford."  And Havana on the 20th informed Cubans that
 "Mr. Gerald Ford has had the supreme shamelessness" to admit
 CIA actions against Allende, and it deplored what it termed the
 President's "Mussolinian assertion" that Allende had threatened
 Chilean opposition parties and the press.

 These statistics are based on the voicecast commentary output of the Moscow and
 Peking domestic and international radio services. The term "commentary" is used
 to denote the lengthy item-radio talk, speech, press article or editorial, govern-
 ment or party statement, or diplomatic note. Items of extensive reportage are
 counted as commenta; ies.
 Figures in parentheses indicate volume of comment during the preceding week.
 Topics and events given major attention in terms of volume are not always
 discussed in the body of the Trends. Some may have been covered in prior issues;
 in other cases the propaganda content may be routine or of minor significance.
 *  This figure excludes brief reports on Mao Tse-tung's mFsting with Daddah.
