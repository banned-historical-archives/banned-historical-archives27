 China: The Debate Over "Political Structural Reforms"
 SUMMARY
 China's reform leaders initiated a wide-ranging discussion in March
 on  the   need  for  "political  structural  reform"  to  accompany  China's
 economic reforms. Triggered in part by lower level party and bureaucratic
 interference that has slowed industrial reforms, the proposed political
 reforrns  attempt  to   clarify  party  and  government  functions,  reduce
 "bureaucratism," and open the decisionmaking process to nonparty views.
 Formulating specific measures to accomplish these goals will force top
 party leaders to grapple with contentious issues, including defining the
 role of lower level party committees in reform, and expanding the freedom
 of expression for intellectuals.  Several reform leaders have stated that a
 year  of  "investigation and  study" will  be needed  before  fundamental
 political reforms can be introduced.  We believe, however, that limited
 political reform measures may be introduced in the near future, including
 new guidelines on cadre selection, advancement, and accountability.
 This memorandum was prepared by                  Office Of East Asian Analysis.
 Information available as of 6 October 1986 was used in its preparation.  Comments and
 queries are welcome and may be directed to the Chief, Political Assessments Branch,
 China Division, OEA

 Reformists Call for "Political Structural Reform"
 China's  proreform  leaders  increasingly see the success of urban 'economic
 reforms--such as the "factory manager responsibility system," labor reforms, and the
 development of urban capital markets--tied to reform of the political system.  They
 believe that the greater threat to reform now comes not from senior party figures, but
 from midlevel bureaucrats and party members who resist implementing reform policies
 a "stalemate" had developed between new economic reforms
 and the old systems of political control.' Political reforms are designed to break the
 stalemate by creating a political climate favorable to economic reform and formulating
 guidelines that will improve implementation of reform policies.
 Political Structural Reform - Main Objectives
 Judging from leadership statements as well as coverage of political reform
 forums and seminars that organizations such as the Central Party School began to hold
 in May, political reform is a group of ideas rather than a specific program.  Different
 Chinese leaders stress different aspects.  Nonetheless, we believe the ideas discussed
 under the rubric of political reform have one of four major objectives:
 The problems that led Hu to suggest reforms might be stalled have been widely
 illustrated in mainland press accounts.    The "factory manager responsibility system,"
 for example, has encountered stiff resistance because it erodes the authority of
 factory  party  officials  and  the  bureaucratic  organizations  (the  so-called
 "mothers-in-law") that have overseen factory operations in the past.  Press reports
 suggest that many recently appointed reformist managers have been badgered out of
 office through such practices as accusations of corrupt behavior.     In April, for
 example, People's Daily reported the case of a manager of a small motor vehicle plant
 who achieved a "miracle" in increasing production and profits by using reform
 management methods. As plant profits went up, however, local bureaucrats and party
 officials refused to grant the enterprise greater autonomy as called for under reforms.
 When the manager persisted, he was investigated on trumped-up bribery charges,
 and eventually dismissed.  Press reports on the results of a recent poll of 300 factory
 managers stated that all the managers complained of such interference with reforms,
 and over half were "fed up" with their jobs.  Other mainland press reports have
 indicated that interference has forced factory reforms to slow or even be reversed in

 ? Separating Party and Government Functions
 The political reform discussion has stressed the need to clearly separate party
 and government functions, and to grant greater responsibility to managers and
 technical personnel for economic decisions.  Political reform advocates claim, for
 example, that the party committees in factories--and specifically the party
 committee  secretaries--often  are  too  involved   in  day-to-day  m4nagement
 decisions despite their limited expertise. As a Chinese newspaper commented in
 late June, party members have grown used  to "cultivating others' land while
 wasting their own," resulting in excessive party interference in nonparty functions
 that actually hinders overall party leadership.
 ? Reducing the Bureaucracy and Streamlining Administrative Staffs
 Reformers  believe  bureaucratic  oversight  and  redtape  must  be cut if the
 economic   reforms  are to succeed.     Although some progress was made in
 streamlining drives in the early 1980s, recent press reports have complained that
 overstaffing is still a problem, and that the proliferation of bureaus and the
 growth in administrative costs have accelerated in recent years.
 ? Reforming the Cadre Selection, Hiring, and Promotion System
 Reform  of  China's cadre  system--the  method  of  hiring,  transferring,  and
 promoting state functionaries and party workers--is also a major concern.  Such
 "unhealthy practices" as nepotism, favoritism, and bribery in assigning posts
 undercuts the reforms--which require the recruitment and promotion of better
 educated cadres--and tarnishes the party's reputation.2
 ? Strengthening "Socialist Democracy"
 The least well-defined category, "socialist democracy" covers proposals designed
 to create a political and intellectual atmosphere conducive to reform.  Some
 leaders are calling for stronger party and government assurances to academics
 and scientists that they can carry on their work and make recommendations
 without concern for ideological issues.   Other proposals under the "socialist
 democracy"  heading  include  giving  greater  attention  to  popular wishes in
 decisionmaking;  increasing the  stature of nonparty government organs and
 "democratic" political parties and personages; and increasing the scope and

 s legal system to guarantee the changes.
 The Issues at the Core of Political Reform
 The issues at the core of political reform are some of the thorniest before
 Chinese leaders.  Although these contentious points are rarely raised in public, we
 believe any political reform initiative will be formulated with an eye to how it affects the

 What Is the Party's Role?
 At the heart of political reform controversies is the continuing ambiguity over the
 role of the party in an economically liberalized China.  In an August 1980 address to the
 Politburo, Deng Xiaoping attacked the "overconcentration" of power in party committees,
 which in practice means that party committee secretaries end up deciding everything.
 Party leaders including Deng, however, remain fundamentally unwilling to subordinate
 the party to other institutions or to an independent legal code. Although some progress
 has been made over the past six years in separating party and government functions,
 and in granting greater autonomy to producers, whether they be farmers, entrepreneurs,
 or larger enterprises, the limits of the authority of party committees at all levels has not
 Nor probably can it be without surrendering large blocks of authority. If concrete
 measures were adopted to address the four areas of political reform listed above, party
 members at lower levels would find their authority to intervene in government and
 economic decisions truncated, the key party prerogative of appointing functionaries
 would be curtailed, and nonparty groups and individuals would have greater latitude to
 criticize party decisions.  Political reforms along these lines would institutionalize and
 accelerate the erosion of mid- and lower-level party member authority.  Although Deng
 Xiaoping has claimed that a reduction in excessive party interference at lower levels is
 necessary to improve party leadership, we believe many leaders remain concerned that
 any reduction in party authority will lead to a loss of control.
 What Is the Role of Ideology?
 The political and economic reform programs directly question the utility of
 Marxism in meeting China's needs and explicitly reverse the Maoist principle of "politics
 in command."  The party, however, continues to derive its legitimacy and its right to
 govern from claims that it possesses an all-encompasing ideology that guides party
 decisions. Although the Maoist approach has been largely discredited, we believe that
 many party members and some leaders are genuinely concerned that "political reform"
 will put "economics in command," weakening the party's legitimacy and undermining the
 ideals  of the  Communist  revolution.   Some  party  members  may fear that  with
 "economics in command," outside critics of the party could even call for a reexamination
 of the usefulness of socialism and the need for party leadership altogether.  Thus,
 finding a way to reconcile Marxism with Deng's pragmatic economic policies and
 defining a role for ideology in post-Mao China are critical issues for many party
 members that are sure to contribute to the controversy surrounding political reforms.
 How Much Freedom of Expression?
 Reform leaders recognize that intellectuals, including scientists and economic
 theorists, must be permitted to express opinions without fear of political repercussions.
 Evidence suggests, however, that reformers are divided over how much freedom to

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/12 : CIA-RDP86T01017R000606670001-5
 permit.   Some reform leaders--along with party conservatives--remain skeptical of
 opening the door to  politically sensitive and controversial topics.  There is also
 disasgreement over whether freedom of expression should be extended to include
 freedoms for artists and writers.  Following the recent affirmation of the "100 flowers"
 policy, intellectuals and other nonparty officials have gained unprecedented leeway to
 criticize local party interference with reforms, but behind the scenes intellectuals are
 pushing for even wider freedom of expression.'
 How To Layoff Bureaucracts?
 Along with  abstract questions   over the  party's function  in reform  and the
 legitimacy of the party's ideology, political reforms touch on questions such as the
 trimming of the bureaucracy that bear direct, personal costs for Chinese leaders.  The
 bureaucracy is largely based on patronage and is an interlocking system of personal ties
 that reach to the highest levels of the party. In addition to exacerbating China's
 unemployment  problem  and      demoralizing  the bureaucracy,  extensive  layoffs  of
 bureaucrats would rend this fabric of personal relationships, and are likely to encounter
 significant resistance.  Although the costs of maintaining China's bloated bureaucracy
 are widely recognized, we believe Chinese leaders will, with one eye on how this affects
 their  own  old-boy  networks,          have difficultly reaching  agreement on methods to
 effectively trim the bureaucracy.
 Where Leaders Stand on Political Reform
 The political reform goal of reducing party and bureaucratic interference at lower
 levels virtually ensures that concrete  reform  measures will be resisted by party
 apparatchiks as well as entrenched bureaucrats. In addition, party traditionalists at all
 levels are likely to feel threatened by the increased liberalism implied in political reform.
 The controversial issues connected with political reform, however, have divided even
 those leaders firmly placed in the reform camp.
 Judging from public statements, Hu Qili and Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang
 appear to be the most vigorous supporters of political reforms.                          ~
 Other reform leaders have spoken of
 political reform in sparing terms, which may reflect their concerns about it.  Premier
 Last fall a young academic at Nanjing University published an article that was carried
 in the 2 November 1985 Gongren Ribao under the pseudonym "Ma Ding." The article,
 which advocated studying non-Marxist economics, was attacked by conservative
 propagandists, but subsequently defended by party reform leaders.  The resulting
 affirmation  of the  rights  of academic  expression  set the  stage for the 30th
 anniversary of Mao Zedong's "100 flowers" speech, which called for intellectual

 Zhao Ziyang endorsed the need for political reform in July only in response to a direct
 question from a Yugoslav journalist.  Vice Premier Wan Li's August speech on the need
 for increasing socialist democracy as part of political reforms was narrowly focused on
 the role of "expert" opinion in decisionmaking.   Vice Premier Qiao Shi missed an
 opportunity to  publicly support  the need  for political  reform at  a conference  on
 strengthening the socialist legal system this summer.
 These differences probably account for changes in the tenor of the discussion.
 The rousing calls for political structural reform voiced during the spring and summer
 have given way to caution.  The Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po reported in early
 August  that leaders  meeting to  discuss the  Sixth  Plenum were     divided over the
 "fundamental issue" of political reform.  Deng Xiaoping himself stated in September that
 the political reform question would not be on the plenum's agenda.          Meanwhile,
 statements by Vice Premier Tian Jiyun and and propaganda chief Zhu Houze focused on
 the need for a year of "study and investigation" before introducing major political reform
 measures.   Beijing also appeared to be limiting the public participation of nonparty
 intellectuals in the discussion; press coverage of August forums on political structural
 reform was sparse compared with the treatment given forums last spring and early
 Reports claiming that the Sixth Plenum would not propose new political reform
 measures proved correct.  The plenum document only referred to the need for political
 reform in passing without suggesting either specific reforms or a reform timetable.
 Political Reform--What's Been Accomplished and What's Ahead?
 We  believe that the  political  reform  discussion  has  already  served  some
 objectives of Deng Xiaoping and his proteges, particularly Hu Qili.  The attention to
 cadre abuses has pressured rank-and-file party members to implement reforms more
 conscientiously and enabled intellectuals to- voice controversial opinions and criticize
 officials who stall on reforms. Moreover, the political reform discussion has significantly
 raised the profile of reformists Hu Qili, propaganda chief Zhu Houze, and Secretariat
 member Wang Zhaoguo--young leaders favorably disposed to political reform who we
 believe will push for change whenever they sense an opportunity for progress.  Indeed,
 press treatments and leadership statements suggest that we will see movement during
 the coming year:
 ? In calling for greater "democracy" in decisionmaking at a speech before a recent
 convention on soft sciences, Vice Premier Wan Li advocated a larger role for
 feasibility studies and expert consultations before projects are undertaken. New
 guidelines  that  would  increase  the  role  of  technical  experts  in  China's
 modernization at the expense of party hacks may be in the works.
 ? Several references have been made during the political reform discussion to the
 need for a comprehensive law governing the selection and evaluation       of state
 functionaries, and  recently the mainland  press   reported that a    draft state

 functionaries law was being circulated among some leading bodies for comments
 and suggestions.  Such a law might address outstanding questions in China's
 cadre system, including restricting party member authority in the cadre selection
 process, and placing cadres under contract employment rather than lifetime
 appointments.
 ? Guidelines on the subordination of party members who commit crimes to legal
 authorities appear likely judging from Chinese media reports.
 ? Beijing will  probably unveil  a  new drive to trim the size and  number of
 bureaucratic offices at lower levels.
 ? We believe that Beijing will continue to define the "100 flowers"  policy, spelling
 out more clearly the extent of academic and artistic freedom of expression.
 Given the issues and disagreements, we believe a period of consensus-building
 will be required before more ambitious political reforms can be launched. The strongest
 proponents of political reform seem to be targeting next year's party  congress for
 a decision. For now, in any case, Beijing is signaling not to expect broader measures. A
 recent People's  Daily article alluding to reformist factory managers' failure to win
 necessary support from "higher authorities," or announcing urealistic "grand programs,"
 seemed to be telling managers that they will have to live with the party committees and
 bureaucratic  meddling for  some time,  and that  they  had best  adjust their  styles
 accordingly.  Newspaper articles have suggested that up to a decade will be required to
 significantly adjust the political structure
