 ANGOLA: MOVEMENT ONSLAUGHT
 The Popular Movement, spearheaded by
 Cuban troops using Soviet-supplied armor,
 scored major gains this week against the forces of
 its adversaries, who appear unlikely to be able to
 wage conventional warfare much longer. With
 the Movement on the way to occupying the
 remaining population centers, African states that
 had resisted the Luanda regime's push for accep-
 tance as the government of Angola at the OAU
 meeting last month are jumping on the
 bandwagon. Many African states, including some
 that came out for the Popular Movement before it
 established its ascendancy, are looking for ways to
 promote a political accommodation between the
 Movement and its two rivals, but so far Move-
 ment leader Agostinho Neto has shown no
 willingness to listen.
 Military Situation
 Huambo, Angola's second largest city, was
 taken early on February 9 by a Popular Movement
 force that reportedly consisted of several thou-
 sand Cubans backed by T-34 tanks, helicopters,
 and 122-mm. rockets. Huambo had also served as
 the capital of the nominal joint government
 proclaimed last November by the National Union
 and National Front; the few "administrators" in
 residence evacuated the city in advance of its fall.
 In acknowledging the loss of Huambo, a
 spokesman for the southern-based National
 Union indicated publicly this week that his group
 would not be able to field a conventional force
 for long and would have to revert to the guerrilla
 tactics it had long employed against the Por-
 tuguese. He vowed, however, that the Union
 would fight on. National Union forces that had
 been defending Huambo withdrew to Bie, the
 group's main military headquarters. That city fell
 on February 11, and Union President Savimbi has
 withdrawn to the remote southern town of Vila
 Serpa Pinto.
 The Popular Movement's drive into the
 National Union's tribal territory made progress
 along the coast, too. On February 10, a Movement
 force apparently occupied the vital
 Benguela-Lobito port and rail complex. Union
 troops in the area were reportedly ordered last
 weekend to begin withdrawing southward. Neto's
 forces may next concentrate their main efforts on
 extending and consolidating their hold over the
 populous central area and the Benguela Railway
 lifeline. Luso, in eastern Angola, is sure to be an
 early target.
 In northern Angola, tank-led Cuban and
 Popular Movement forces advancing from Am-
 brizete took Tomboco and the coastal port of

 Santo Antonio do Zaire last weekend. The Front
 has apparently also evacuated Maquela do Zom-
 bo and will probably soon abandon Sao Salvador,
 its last position of any size. Most of the Front's
 forces have retreated into Zaire.
 Political Developments
 Cameroon extended official recognition to
 the Luanda regime last week, and Uganda, Togo,
 Gabon Ivory Coast, and Upper Volta followed suit
 this week. The Neto regime now has been formal-
 ly accepted by 30 of the 46 member states of the
 Organization of African Unity. Most, if not all of
 the rest, are likely to fall into line before long;
 even Zairian President Mobutu, Neto's long-time
 enemy, is apparently trying to work out a modus
 vivendi with the Popular Movement. In any event,
 the Movement's new diplomatic gains ended any
 doubts about whether it would be seated as the
 government of Angola at the OAU ministerial
 meeting that isapparently still scheduled for later
 this month.
 Uganda's action gave the Movement a special
 boost, inasmuch as President Amin had played an
 important role in his capacity as OAU chairman in
 the effort to check the Neto group's drive for
 acceptance as the sole government of Angola. In
 a telegram to Neto, Amin explained that Uganda
 was extending recognition because the Popular
 Movement had been endorsed by a majority of
 OAU states and thus was "automatically entitled"
 to full OAU membership.
 With the deterioration of its military and
 political position, the National Union has stepped
 up its efforts to get talks going with Neto on a
 possible coalition government for Angola. An ap-
 proach last month to Kenya to act as go-between
 got nowhere; Nairobi recently informed Savimbi
 that Neto was unresponsive to its overtures.
 The Union is now looking to Nigeria, which it
 approached through the British. Although Nigeria
 recognized the Popular Movement regime last
 November and has given it strong diplomatic sup-
 port, Lagos has continued to favor some kind of
 accommodation between the warring Angolan
 groups. According to the British high com-
 missioner in Lagos, the Nigerians agreed last week
 to relay to Neto a message from Savimbi propos-
 ing discussions in Lusaka, Zambia. There are some
 signs that the Nigerians are becoming increasingly
 anxious to end the Soviet and Cuban presence in
 Angola and consider a reconciliation between the
 Popular Movement and the National Union as a
 necessary precondition. Neto, however, is ap-
 parently still adamantly resisting all efforts to
 move him toward any coalition arrangement,
 even one limited to the National Union as a
 decided junior partner.

 USSR-ANGOLA: MORE TOUGH TALK
 Pravda this week published a long,
 authoritative article on Angola designed in part to
 refute US criticism of Moscow's role in the former
 Portuguese territory.
 The article-signed "Observer" to indicate
 top-level Kremlin endorsement-is Moscow's
 most complete and authoritative statement on
 Angola to date. Its tone was confident on Angola
 itself, assertive regarding the rest of Africa, and
 almost pugnacious in its rejection of the notion
 that the USSR has anything to apologize for in its
 Angola policy. It lashed out at Secretary
 Kissinger's recent speech in San Francisco, saying
 the Secretary was "obviously out of tune with the
 facts" and was attempting to "whitewash"
 long-standing US "overt and covert interference"
 in Angola. "Observer" emphasized that detente
 does not signify "freedom of action for
 aggressors."
 Moscow has displayed considerable sensitivi-
 ty to the Secretary's West Coast remarks and to his
 testimony on Angola before the Senate, but this is
 the first time that an authoritative Soviet rebuttal
 has appeared. Earlier articles had directly criticiz-
 ed both President Ford and Secretary Kissinger for
 allegedly "distorting" the Soviet and Cuban role
 in Angola, but they were careful to balance these
 barbs with positive comments on the ac-
 complishments of detente. Pravda did not men-
 tion Cuban aid for the Popular Movement nor
 Soviet naval activity off West Africa, but it did, for
 the first time, admit openly that the USSR and its
 allies gave Angola "weapons."
 Perhaps by way of additional justification, the
 "Observer" article went further than the Soviets
 had gone heretofore in describing the
 "imperialist opponents" arrayed against the Luan-
 da regime. Thus, it stated specifically that the
 mercenaries who have fought against the Popular
 Movement were recruited in the US, West Ger-
 many, the UK, and other Western countries in a
 "well-organized way."
 "Observer" also took a swipe at alleged
 NATO designs on Angola, a theme that has
 appeared with increasing frequency in recent
 Soviet media commentary. "It is no secret," the
 article noted, that Western "military, strategic,
 and economic interests" play a considerable role
 in "neo-colonialist and racist" desires for a
 "bastion" in southern Africa to confront all the
 "progressive countries" on the continent.
 "Observer's" assertion that South African forces
 have no intention of withdrawing from Angola
 raised by implication the possibility that Soviet
 assistance and that of the Cubans will continue.
 This may also be the underlying meaning behind
 the assertion that the Angolan people should be
 "ensured conditions to complete the liberation."
 Revolutionary groups elsewhere in sub-
 Saharan Africa were offered even stronger en-
 couragement than was the case in an Izvestia
 "Observer" article on Angola late last month.
 Pravda emphasized that the consolidation of the
 Popular Movement's power in Angola will repre-
 sent a "powerful stimulus" in mounting the
 liberation struggle against Namibia, Rhodesia,
 and South Africa itself.
 At the same time, however, Pravda-like the
 earlier Izvestia article-attempted to balance its
 hard-hitting prose with a conciliatory gesture.
 While making no bones about Soviet "moral,
 political, diplomatic, and other" assistance to the
 People's Republic of Angola as the "legitimate"
 government, "Observer" pointed out that
 Moscow by no means considers the "military
 way" the only possibility of settling the Angolan
 question.
 The "Observer" article devoted a paragraph
 to a quote from "President" Neto, saying that he
 and the Angolan people appreciate all that their
 "friends" have done. The purpose of this curious
 testimonial may be to tell the Soviet audience that
 the Soviets have reason to believe that the
 Popular Movement will not prove to be a bunch
 of ingrates.
 "Observer" took special note of China's sup-
 port for the forces opposing the Popular Move-
 ment. The treatment may have been in reaction to
 a recent attack in the People's Daily on Soviet
 policy in Angola.

 LEBANON: INCHING AHEAD
 Lebanese President Franjiyah made his
 long-awaited trip to Damascus last weekend. His
 talks with Syrian President Asad resulted in a
 public reaffirmation by Damascus of its guarantee
 that the Palestinians will respect past agreements
 with the Lebanese government. No an-
 nouncements were made concerning the political
 settlement for Lebanon that Syria has been seek-
 ing, apparently because Lebanese politicians,
 while agreeing on the basics of a reform package,
 continue to argue over specific provisions.
 Damascus will probably attempt to honor its
 pledge to control the fedayeen by continuing to
 use units of the Syrian-controlled Palestine
 Liberation Army to patrol areas of Lebanon where
 the fedayeen and Christian militias most often
 clash. In addition, Liberation Army forces in
 Beirut will probably try to restrict armed fedayeen
 to the refugee camps. These actions will help to
 preserve the cease-fire and facilitate political
 negotiations at no long-term cost to the fedayeen
 military position in Lebanon.
 A Lebanese newspaper reported last
 weekend that Franjiyah and Asad also agreed on a
 comprehensive political settlement for Lebanon
 that will be made public by Beirut after it is ap-
 proved by the Lebanese cabinet. The accord
 reportedly provides for:
 ?  A revised and written Lebanese
 national charter to replace the existing un-
 written national covenant.
 ?  The formation of a new cabinet un-
 der Prime Minister Karami.
 ?  The scheduled withdrawal of
 Palestine Liberation Army troops from
 Lebanon.
 The report remains unconfirmed. Syrian
 Foreign Minister Khaddam did tell newsmen late
 last week, however, that Asad and Franjiyah, even
 before their meeting in Damascus, had reached
 agreement on a political settlement covering "all
 aspects" of the Lebanese dispute. An announce-
 ment may be made in Beirut following a special
 cabinet meeting scheduled for February 14.
 Franjiyah is using the agreement on the
 Palestinian question in a final attempt to elicit the
 backing of all Christian factions for a general
 political settlement.  Leaders of some ultra-
 conservative Maronite groups are still trying to
 qualify their agreement to basic elements of the
 reform package by demanding a more detailed
 agreement that would better protect the
 Christians'   political  prerogatives.

 FRANCE-SOMALIA: HEATING UP
 Tensions increased markedly in the volatile
 Horn of Africa last week as a result of a border
 clash between Somali soldiers and French troops
 stationed in France's Territory of the Afars and
 Issas. Both sides reinforced their garrisons, and
 neighboring Ethiopia placed its armed forces on
 alert. A wider conflict appears unlikely at this
 time, but more trouble seems certain as Paris
 proceeds with plans, which Somalia opposes, for
 decolonizing the territory.
 On February 3, members of a Somali-backed
 guerrilla group, the Front for the Liberation of the
 Somali Coast, hijacked a bus carrying French
 school children in Djibouti, the capital of the
 French territory. French troops halted the bus
 near the Somali border and, on the following day,
 stormed the vehicle, killing the terrorists. During
 the incident, the troops exchanged fire with a
 Somali force drawn up to the border. France
 claims the Somalis fired first; Mogadiscio charges
 that the French attacked a Somali border town
 with tanks, armored cars, and artillery.
 All French forces in the territory were placed
 on alert, and Paris flew in about 1,000 riot police.

 The French also arrested the leader of the
 territory's legal opposition party, which has close
 ties to Somalia and the terrorist group.
 Unrest had been increasing in the territory
 for several months. Opponents of the pro-French
 colonial government have staged several
 demonstrations, and French authorities have
 been searching homes for arms caches and ex-
 pelling ethnic Somalis suspected of being illegal
 residents. The expulsions, in particular, have
 angered President Siad's government in
 Mogadiscio, which claims that France is forcing
 out legal residents who might vote for pro-Somali
 candidates in any elections to be held as part of
 the decolonization process.
 Since the clash, the border has remained
 quiet, but Somalia has pressed a vigorous
 propaganda and diplomatic campaign aimed
 against France and Ethiopia, which supports Paris'
 plans for the territory. The campaign apparently is
 intended in part to deflect attention from
 Mogadiscio's ties with the terrorists and to further
 Somalia's efforts to gain a voice in negotiations on
 decolonizing the territory. Mogadiscio officially
 supports "unconditional" independence, but its
 long-range ambition is to annex the
 territory-and parts of Ethiopia and Kenya as well.
 President Siad is particularly opposed to France's
 plans to transfer power to a long-time Somali foe
 and to keep French troops in the territory after in-
 dependence.
 On February 5, Mogadiscio asked for a UN
 Security Council meeting over the incident, but
 subsequently indicated that it would not press for
 a meeting until early next week. There are signs
 that some African delegates, concerned that a
 debate would reveal more disunity in their ranks,
 were attempting to get Somalia to withdraw its
 Siad is claiming publicly that France and "cer-
 tain colonialist forces" have plans to invade
 Somalia and has sought political support from
 fellow members of the Arab League. Siad will
 probably step up pressure against the French by
 supporting a campaign of subversion and
 France has pledged to guarantee the integrity
 and security of an independent Afar-Issa state by
 maintaining a military presence, but Paris is
 probably unwilling to act as sole peacekeeper in
 the region. More terrorist acts against French
 citizens could cause France to reconsider its
 pledge.

 the disputed territory. The Moroccans have
 resumed a military sweep against remaining
 strongholds of the Algerian-backed Polisario
 guerrillas in the northeastern Sahara. Algiers is
 continuing to provide the Polisario Front with es-
 sential material support for its insurgency, while
 pushing on the diplomatic level for a referendum
 on self-determination.
 Egyptian Vice President Mubarak returned to
 Cairo on February 5, having failed to-get Morocco
 and Algeria to compromise on the substance of
 their dispute. Rabat continues to insist on
 Algerian recognition of Moroccan sovereignty
 over the territory before Morocco will accept
 Egypt's proposal for a meeting of foreign
 ministers in Cairo. Morocco's position was spelled
 out by Minister of State for Information Benhima
 in a press conference on February 10. Rabat's
 decision to press on with its military sweep in
 Spanish Sahara while Egyptian mediation efforts
 were still going on contributed to Mubarak's
 failure.
 Algeria, for its part, refuses to drop its de-
 mand for a "free and genuine" referendum on
 self-determination for the people of Spanish
 Sahara. The Boumediene government reiterated
 its position at length on February 6 in a memoran-
 dum to UN Secretary General Waldheim. In addi-
 tion to again condemning the tripartite agree-
 ment signed last November by Madrid, Rabat,
 and Nouakchott turning over control of the
 Sahara to the Moroccans and Mauritanians, the
 memorandum maintained that Spain is still ac-
 countable to the UN as the legitimate ad-
 ministering power of a non-self-governing
 territory. It also characterized the Moroc-
 can-Mauritanian take-over of the territory as a
 blatant act of aggression affecting the peace and
 stability of the region.
 The memorandum may be a prelude to an
 Algerian appeal to the Security Council. Given
 the inconclusive outcome of the debate in the
 General Assembly last December-two
 resolutions were passed, one of which supported
 the Moroccan position and the other the
 Algerian-a request that the Council take up the
 Sahara issue as a threat to international security is
 the only move left to the Algerians at the UN.
 Waldheim's personal envoy arrived in the
 Sahara on February 7 after two days of con-
 sultations in Madrid. He is expected to return
 home later this week without visiting Morocco,
 Mauritania, or Algeria. The envoy-and the
 Moroccans, who insist that the question of the
 future of the disputed territory is settled-are
 carefully portraying the mission as limited to
 fact-finding. The Moroccans are also using the oc-
 casion to play up their claim that Saharans have
 already been consulted through the territorial
 assembly, which Rabat says decisively endorsed
 the tripartite accord. The Algerians are
 characterizing the envoy's mission as evidence
 that the "Sahara file remains open" at the UN.
 Within the territory, Moroccan military
 operations in the northeast have proceeded
 without incident. The Moroccans occupied
 Tifariti on February 4 and Bir Lehlu four days later,
 after Egyptian and Saudi mediators arranged a
 deal with Algeria to withdraw any forces it had in
 the two towns. By midweek there were uncon-
 firmed reports that Moroccan troops had also oc-
 cupied Mahbes, some 30 miles from the Algerian
 border. Loss of Mahbes would deprive the
 Polisario Front of its last stronghold in the
 northeastern part of the territory.
 Despite Algeria's decision not to confront
 Moroccan forces occupying these Polisario
 strongholds, there are no indications that Algiers
 is changing its strategy of supporting guerrilla
 harassment of Moroccan and Mauritanian forces,
 which have now occupied nearly all of the towns
 and outposts in the Sahara. So long as Algiers con-
 tinues to provide weapons, training, and supplies,
 Polisario guerrillas can continue indefinitely their
 hit-and-run and sabotage attacks. They will
 probably focus their efforts in those areas where
 opposition is weak and where they can operate
 with relative freedom, such as the part of the
 Sahara under Mauritania's control, or even

 ITALY: RESPITE BUT NO SOLUTION
 Aldo Moro's search for a new government
 ended this week when his Christian Democratic
 Party reluctantly agreed to form a one-party
 minority administration on terms that make it the
 weakest Italian government in years. The govern-
 ment was sworn in yesterday and faces a con-
 fidence vote in parliament next week. Moro's
 cabinet will probably last only a couple of
 months-just long enough to take some
 emergency economic measures and to permit the
 Christian Democrats and Socialists to sort out
 political options at party congresses in March.
 The Christian Democrats' reluctance to form
 a cabinet on their own-a traditional way of let-
 ting the dust settle when other solutions prove
 elusive-stems from Moro's failure to get more
 than a limited offer of cooperation from the other
 center-left parties. Only the small Social
 Democratic Party will vote with the Christian
 Democrats in parliament. The Socialists and
 Republicans, traditionally at loggerheads on
 economic policy, have agreed to abstain in a
 parliamentary confidence vote, which will permit
 a government to be installed. The two parties
 reserved the right, however, to oppose portions
 of Moro's economic program.
 Moro had considerable difficulty convincing
 the Christian Democrats to go ahead under these
 circumstances. Conservatives, such as former par-
 ty chief Fanfani, argued that such a government
 would quickly find itself in trouble unless Moro
 could persuade the Socialists and Republicans to
 provide actual support in parliament. Neither par-
 ty budged, although Socialist chief De Martino's
 public promise of "maximum good will" im-
 proved the atmosphere a bit. That, coupled with
 President Leone's statement of support for Moro
 early this week, helped Moro and his major ally,
 Christian Democratic leader Zaccagnini, to cir-
 cumvent opposition in the party.
 None of the governing parties is satisfied with
 the results of the lengthy maneuvering, least of all
 the Socialists. They failed to achieve the objec-
 tives they sought in  bringing down Moro's
 previous government early last month, which
 Aldo Moro        dim 0 C T
 were a larger role for the Socialists in a new
 government and more open consultations with
 the Communists.
 The Communists are probably the only
 gainers. They will point to the continuing political
 deadlock to bolster their argument that the Com-
 munist Party must ultimately be brought into the
 government. Meanwhile, the Communists retain
 the option to criticize in public, while working
 behind the scenes in parliament to put their
 stamp on economic and other legislation propos-
 ed by the new government.
 The compromise economic program that
 enabled Moro to put together his fragile majority
 judiciously combines spending austerity and a
 credit squeeze-measures sought by the conser-
 vative Republicans-with job-saving provisions
 desired by the Socialists and the labor unions.
 The more important elements of the
 emergency package include:
 ?  Holding down incomes by a partial
 wage freeze for the top 10 percent of white
 collar workers and restraint of blue collar
 wage demands.
 ?  Increasing revenues by. imposing an
 excess profits tax and tightening up on
 collection, as well as standby authority to
 collect $2.6 billion in new indirect taxes.
 ?  Limiting spending by  monitoring
 state expenditures to reduce the soaring
 deficit.

 ?  Creating jobs by establishing an ap-
 prenticeship program to employ some 50,-
 000 young people.
 The program also reaffirms-without going
 into potentially contentious details-the
 government's interest in longer range structural
 reforms to alleviate Italy's chronic inflation and
 balance-of-payments problems. These measures
 include investing $26 billion over five years in the
 industrial sector, restructuring the industrial sec-
 tor, and revising the Southern Development
 Fund.
 While the fiscal and incomes policy measures
 are relatively weak, the government also im-
 plemented a series of helpful monetary and
 foreign exchange policies. These flanking actions,
 including increased reserve requirements and a
 higher discount rate, are designed to cut capital
 outflows and reduce excess liquidity. The lira,
 which the government stopped supporting three
 weeks ago, gained strength from its low point last
 week, but ebbed slightly in recent days due large-
 ly to technical corrections.
 The proposed program, still to be approved
 by parliament and subject to specific changes,
 should restore a modicum of confidence in the
 economy. The main thrust of its restrictive
 policies would be to dampen inflationary
 pressures and thus promote a more balanced
 recovery of the economy.
 FRANCE: CRUCIAL CONGRESS
 The 22nd French Communist Party congress
 ended on February 8, after unanimously suppor-
 ting Secretary General Georges Marchais' an-
 nounced intention to move the party away from
 Soviet-style orthodoxy. The new look Marchais
 hopes to give the party was also reflected in a
 resolution to remove the term "dictatorship of
 the proletariat" from party statutes.
 Although there was support for this doctrinal
 change, debate over its implications has not end-
 ed within the party, and Marchais must be able to
 enforce party unity in order to follow through
 with his policy revisions. Rank-and-file rebellion
 was responsible, for example, for the removal
 from the congress' agenda of at least one topic in-
 troduced by the party leaders at preparatory
 meetings. References to the "immorality and sex-
 uality of the masses" distressed many members
 and resulted in a barrage of letters to the party
 newspaper !'Humanize complaining that this was
 not a topic suitable for discussion at the congress.
 Marchais' call at the congress for a "union of
 the French people" based on issue-by-issue
 agreements among "like-minded progressive
 forces" seems designed to outflank the Socialists
 on the right and may encourage some orthodox
 Gaullist deputies to join the Communists in op-
 posing some government proposals. The issue of
 a popularly elected European Parliament, which is
 supported by the government and most of the
 Socialists, is opposed by the Communists and the
 orthodox Gaullists. At least one orthodox Gaullist
 has expressed a desire to cooperate with the
 Communists in a campaign on this issue. Further
 Communist appeals to those Gaullists could make
 it difficult for Prime Minister Jacques Chirac to
 maintain unity in his party.
 The Socialists see the new Communist
 strategy as a political ploy designed to offset
 Socialist electoral gains, rather than a real deci-
 sion to reform. Socialist fears have been fed by a
 recent poll which indicates that, in one section of
 the country at least, there has been a 4-percent
 increase in Communist popularity during the last
 month.
 Although Marchais emphasized his desire to
 cooperate with the Soviets in the "joint struggle
 against imperialism," he attacked some of the
 most sensitive points in Soviet doctrine. The
 French move toward greater liberalism, similar to
 that of the Italian party, creates the appearance of
 a trend that the Soviets find profoundly distur-
 bing. The Soviets undoubtedly fear that Marchais'

 moves will further reduce Moscow's influence in
 the world communist movement and provide
 renewed temptation for the East Europeans to
 take a more independent line. The timing of
 Marchais' "declaration of independence" is par-
 ticularly upsetting to the Soviet leaders, who have
 their own party congress coming up and thus can
 hardly ignore the French challenge.
 The Soviet rebuttal began while the French
 congress was still in progress. Speaking at a rally in
 a Paris suburb, Politburo member Kirilenko, who
 led the Soviet delegation to the congress, defend-
 ed the Soviet way of life as a valid model, as op-
 posed to Marchais' "socialism with French
 colors." So far- the Soviet media have tried, by
 selective and incomplete coverage, to conceal the
 magnitude of the French break with orthodoxy,
 but the idea that something is amiss cannot be
 permanently hidden.
 The Soviets appear to enjoy considerable
 grass-roots support in the French party, and there
 are many issues on which the French and Soviet
 parties agree. The Soviets will probably continue
 their dispute with the French party, but will not
 break off relations entirely. If Marchais fails to un-
 ite the party to carry out his new policies, the
 Soviets may decide to exploit the disarray to try to
 bring the French party back to the orthodox fold.

 USSR: 25TH PARTY CONGRESS
 General Secretary Brezhnev is expected to
 dominate the 25th Soviet Communist Party
 Congress, which opens on February 24 in
 Moscow, as he did the two previous congresses.
 Much of the opening session will be taken up
 with administrative affairs. President Podgorny, or
 someone of similar stature, will preside over the
 opening ceremonies and the election of the con-
 gress' governing bodies-the Presidium, the
 Secretariat, the Editorial Commission, and the
 Credentials Commission. Candidates for positions
 on these bodies are elected quickly and un-
 animously.
 After the election Brezhnev will deliver the
 Central Committee's accountability report. At the
 24th congress, Brezhnev's speech was six hours
 long and was televised live. The report of the
 chairman of the Auditing Commission, G. F.
 Sizov, will follow Brezhnev's.
 USSR Gosplan chairmen. Kosygin's speech will
 conclude the discussion and be followed by the
 election of members of the party's ruling bodies.
 This election will take place at an afternoon
 session the day before the close of the congress.
 The session is open only to voting delegates and
 those with consultative votes, some 5,000 in all.
 Once these delegates have elected a new Central
 Committee, its members meet in plenary session
 to elect the new Politburo and Secretariat. The
 stability that has marked pre-congress
 preparations suggests that there will be no major
 shake-up in the Central Committee or the Polit-
 buro. A small increase in the membership of the
 Central Committee is possible; this has been the
 practice at recent CPSU congresses. One or two
 new faces may appear in the party secretariat.
 At the final session of the congress, Brezhnev
 will probably preside, and the results of the
 For the next several days, the first secretaries
 of republics and of other important party
 organizations will dominate discussion of these
 reports, with first secretary of the Moscow city
 party committee Grishin heading the list. If tradi-
 tion is followed, he will be followed by the first
 secretaries from the Ukraine, Leningrad, and
 Kazakhstan. In addition to important party
 figures, some representatives of the intelligentsia
 and simple workers may be allowed to take part in
 the discussion. After six days of turgid debate, full
 of encomiums for Brezhnev, the congress will
 adopt a decree on Brezhnev's report and approve
 the Auditing Commission's report. Full approval
 of the General Secretary's report is normally
 deferred until the last day of the congress.
 When the discussion of Brezhnev's report is
 concluded, Chairman of the Council of Ministers
 Kosygin will present the draft directives for the
 Five Year Plan. Government officials will
 dominate discussion of Kosygin's speech. The
 chairman of the Ukrainian Council of Ministers
 has in the past initiated the debate, and he will
 probably be so honored again. Other speakers
 will include the chairmen from Kazakhstan,
 Belorussia, and Uzbekistan, and the RSFSR and

 SPAIN: GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE
 The new Spanish government has acted to
 implement two of Prime Minister Arias' promises
 to liberalize the political system, but its efforts fall
 short of opposition demands and the left con-
 tinues to press for faster change.
 Last week the cabinet repealed some of the
 harshest portions of Franco's 1975 anti-terrorism
 law-a major demand of the leftist op-
 position-but kept enough controversial features
 to make the changes appear largely cosmetic.
 Members of the two major terrorist groups in
 Spain, the Basque Fatherland and Liberty and the
 radical extremist Antifascist and Patriotic
 Revolutionary Front, will apparently continue to
 be tried by military tribunals that severely restrict
 legal rights. Furthermore, the right of habeas cor-
 pus will remain suspended throughout Spain, and
 police will retain sweeping powers of search
 without warrant.
 On the same day, the cabinet also approved a
 draft law widening the right of assembly. It
 provides that police authorization will no longer
 be required for indoor meetings of more than 19
 people, although police will still have to be
 notified in advance. Communists, terrorists, and
 separatists are excluded, and permission is still
 required for outdoor meetings and
 demonstrations. The draft law will be an impor-
 tant test of the conservative parliament's
 willingness to go along with Arias' cautious
 reforms.
 Arias has been widely criticized by the far left
 and even by members of the establishment for
 the vagueness of his promises and his un-
 willingness to commit the government to a
 specific timetable. Defenders of the government
 maintain that caution is necessary in the face of
 strong opposition from the entrenched ultra-right
 "bunker." The cabinet decisions last week were
 apparently intended as an earnest of the
 government's good intentions.
 Prominent ministers, in an obvious effort to
 flesh out the disappointingly bare bones of Arias'
 policy speech of January 28, have talked of a con-
 stitutional referendum this summer, local elec-
 tions in November, and parliamentary elections
 by universal suffrage in the first half of 1977.
 Justice Minister Garrigues has also said that the
 government is already preparing changes to ease
 the penal code dealing with illegal association
 and propaganda-a move that could facilitate
 release of more political prisoners.
 The opposition, meanwhile, continues to
 press for more. Their impatience is most visible in
 the troubled Basque and Catalonian regions
 where demands for significant autonomy have
 been largely ignored. Demonstrators in Barcelona
 defied massive police precautions on February 1
 and 8 and managed some of the biggest shows of
 opposition to the government since Franco's
 death. Organized by the illegal Assembly of
 Catalonia-a Communist-manipulated amalgam
 of regional groups-the demonstration focused
 on demands for more autonomy for Catalonia
 and amnesty for all political prisoners.
 The assassination of a Basque mayor this
 week and the killing of another Basque-ap-
 parently because he was mistaken for the mayor
 of his town-appears to be the work of a splinter
 commando group. The Basque Fatherland and
 Liberty, which had apparently slackened off in
 order to regroup after harsh government repres-
 sion last year, may now try to prove that it can
 outdo the rival group, initiating a renewed cycle
 of terrorism in the Basque provinces. The splinter
 group evidently hopes that continued terrorist
 acts will provoke more official repression and
 prevent the government from instituting limited
 regional autonomy in place of the separate nation

 ICELAND: TENSIONS INCREASE
 The cod war warmed up again last week as
 Britain ordered its warships back into Iceland's
 disputed 200-mile fishing zone and Reykjavik
 renewed its threat to break relations with London.
 The British move on February 5 came after an
 Icelandic patrol boat cut the trawls of a British
 fishing boat. Foreign Secretary Callaghan had
 warned earlier that further Icelandic harassment
 would automatically trigger the return of the
 frigates. Prior to his decision to send back the
 navy, Callaghan outlined to NATO ambassadors
 the British position in the fishing dispute and ask-
 ed for support. He said the UK had bent over
 backwards in search of an agreement, but had
 met only with intransigence.
 The Icelandic cabinet's rejection of the draft
 fishing agreement worked out by Prime Minister
 Wilson and Icelandic Prime Minister Hallgrimsson
 further angered the British. Reykjavik contended
 that the British request for 28 percent of the total
 annual catch off Iceland was unacceptable. The
 British proposal also stipulated that the UK would
 get a minimum of 65,000 tons of cod this year and
 an overall catch of 85,000 tons. Reykjavik wants to
 limit the overall catch to 65,000 tons.
 Despite its rejection of the London proposals,
 the Icelandic cabinet decided on February 6 not
 to break relations with London at this time.
 Hallgrimsson was apparently able to convince his
 cabinet to postpone its decision until NATO
 Secretary General Luns had another chance to
 mediate the dispute. The cabinet was also im-
 pressed by expressions of concern voiced at two
 special sessions of the North Atlantic Council.
 Luns' chances for success are slim. Although
 the British have said they will cooperate fully with
 him, they are privately pessimistic over his
 chances. London is looking for a face-saving way
 out of the current impasse, but feels it has already
 gone as far as it can without any sign of reciprocal
 flexibility from Reykjavik.
 Hallgrimsson's only hope of easing tensions is
 to revive the Icelandic proposal for a three-month
 agreement, which was dropped when London
 sent its frigates back to the disputed zone. The
 Prime Minister believes he can sell a short-term
 agreement to his government's coalition partner,
 the Progressive Party, if the frigates leave the area.
 He still must convince Progressive Party leader
 Johannesson, however, `who is reluctant to ap-
 prove such an agreem nt now that British
 warships have returned.

 NATO: ARMS COOPERATION
 Last week's meeting in Rome of the 10
 members of NATO's Eurogroup and France was a
 successful first step toward greater European
 defense cooperation. The goals of the new
 "Independent European Program Group" are to
 increase arms industry cooperation-seen as an
 economic, technical,.-and political necessity-to
 strengthen the "European factor" within the
 Alliance, and to ensure that Western r.urope
 maintains a modern industrial and technological
 base. Unless the group moves fairly rapidly
 toward developing specific projects, however,
 there will be pressure, particularly from Britain
 and Germany, to move the standardization effort
 back to a NATO forum.
 The group convened outside the Alliance
 framework largely in order to accommodate
 French objections to association with NATO's in-
 tegrated military command. Central to the
 group's success thus far has been a new
 willingness by France to cooperate with its allies.
 Participants have indicated that the French show-
 ed an encouraging seriousness and flexibility dur-
 ing the discussions. As a result, the group was able
 to agree easily on a collaborative work program
 and on the importance of maintaining the
 trans-Atlantic link-commitments that in the past
 might have been expected to elicit French reser-
 vations about multilateral forums and military
 collaboration within the Alliance.
 France's cooperativeness is in part due to
 Paris' realization that, despite French prominence
 in arms production, the other Europeans could
 become impatient enough to move ahead
 without it in the Eurogroup. The French are also
 apparently increasingly confident of their ability
 to hold their own among the Europeans and,
 backed by them, to compete with the US in Euro-
 pean arms sales.
 Paris has measured well the eagerness of its
 European partners to have France participate in
 the arms effort. The willingness of the allies, for
 their part, to meet with the French outside the
 Alliance framework is attributable not only to
 long-run considerations of assuring a European
 role in arms production, but also to their percep-
 tion of improved French-US relations and US in-
 terest in getting on with improving Alliance
 military efficiency.
 Within the new European effort, France is
 committed to preserving "Alliance cohesion,"
 but the French can be expected to continue to be
 more assertive of the "European vocation" than
 the others. Despite its advocacy of closer Euro-
 pean cooperation in the arms field, France will be
 wary of submitting ultimately to guidelines that
 could restrict advantageous bilateral deals with
 the US. Paris apparently views such deals as a
 vehicle for broadening its access to American
 high technology.
 The process incorporated by the Rome
 meeting has, in any case, seemed to reinforce the
 European awareness that defense cooperation is
 an essential part of the movement toward political
 unity. Belgian Prime Minister Tindemans' recent
 report on the future of "European Union"
 recommends EC involvement in defense matters
 and the establishment of an arms procurement
 organization. This is still a politically difficult step
 for France, as well as some of its partners, to take,
 and the Program Group could in fact perform
 much the same function without raising as much
 debate.
 Arms officials from "The 11" will meet in six
 weeks to present their initial findings on possible
 programs of common interest and on how work
 might be shared among European firms. A
 meeting at the political level will be held in June;
 by that time there should be significant evidence
 by which to gauge the success of last week's
 agreements in surmounting traditional barriers to

 BALKAN COOPERATION: A STEP FORWARD
 Middle-level officials from all the Balkan
 countries except Albania made modest progress
 toward economic and technical cooperation at
 their recent 11-day conference. They also kept
 the door ajar for similar gatherings in the future.
 The participants, who met in Athens from
 January 26 to February 5, referred 154 non-
 political proposals to their governments for con-
 sideration. These propositions are in the fields of
 agriculture, commerce, energy, transport,
 telecommunications, and environment. The com-
 munique summarizing the discussions makes
 clear that a second conference will depend on
 whether the participating governments decide
 that multilateral cooperation is "useful and ap-
 propriate." Yugoslav press accounts report that
 "most" participants believe that a second session
 will be held soon.
 The conference was inspired by Greek Prime
 Minister Caramanlis, who viewed it as an oppor-
 tunity to apply on the regional level the principles
 of detente adopted at Helsinki last summer. He
 also believes it would help secure his country's
 northern flank against possible adventurist ac-
 tions by Turkey. Although most delegates
 evidently tried to avoid politics, there were some
 reports that Bulgaria, considered a Soviet sur-
 rogate by the other participants, clashed with
 Romania when Bucharest advocated designating
 the Balkans as a "zone of peace."
 Other Warsaw Pact members-possibly at
 Moscow's behest-may try to attend the next
 round of talks. An Italian diplomat recently said
 that the Hungarians had tried unsuccessfully to
 participate in the Athens meeting. Moreover, a
 Greek Foreign Ministry official asserts that the
 Bulgarians, on the eve of the Athens conference,
 resurrected an earlier suggestion that the
 Hungarians, Czechoslovaks, and Poles attend the
 initial meeting.
 Belgrade and Bucharest might be willing to
 support Hungarian participation in a follow-on
 session, but they would almost certainly view ef-
 forts by Prague and Warsaw to gain admission as a
 Soviet attempt to pack the meeting. Meanwhile,
 journalists in Athens say that the Greeks will brief
 the Albanians on the first conference and then
 are likely again to propose that Tirana send a
 delegation to the second round of talks.
 ALBANIA: STATE OF PARANOIA
 After a series of top-level purges of the party
 and government over the past year, Albanian par-
 ty chief Hoxha is now making a frantic effort to
 strengthen his country's air and sea defenses.
 The Italian ambassador asserts that the nor-
 mally secretive Albanians are hastily building
 bomb shelters and antiaircraft bunkers around
 the capital, and are making no effort to
 camouflage their activities, They have even re-
 quested embassies to build bomb shelters in their
 compounds. The French ambassador confirms
 these reports and adds that Albania is in the midst
 of a "frenzied" attempt to build a chain of
 bunkers along the Adriatic coast. Both diplomats
 believe that these efforts reflect genuine concern
 for the nation's security.
 The Italian comments that the country's in-
 ternal situation has deteriorated so much that
 Albania resembles a concentration camp. Or-
 dinary citizens fear even to exchange greetings
 with foreigners.
 Tirana's anxiety reflects the leadership's in-
 creased sense of insecurity and isolation. The ill
 health of Hoxha and of Premier Shehu has
 probably led the leadership to resort to fear tac-
 tics-such as the purges-to preserve its position.
 In addition, Tirana's fear of Moscow has increased
 sharply since 1974, when pro-Soviet cominfor-
 mists were discovered in neighboring Yugoslavia.
 The xenophobic Albanians continue to reject

 Soviet overtures for closer bilateral ties. China's
 relative indifference to Albania's current
 economic plight may have contributed to the
 Hoxha regime's sense of isolation.
 Meanwhile, Hoxha seems intent on projec-
 ting an image of unity within the leadership. In
 mid-January, the entire hierarchy turned out at
 the Chinese embassy to offer condolences on the
 death of Chou En-Iai. Since then, there have been
 no similar appearances by the party elite, but such
 absences from public view-particularly by Hox-
 ha-are not unusual. Some Western diplomats in
 Tirana, however, doubt that Hoxha will be on the
 scene much longer.
 CHINA: AN "ACTING" PREMIER
 Chou En-lai's carefully planned succession
 arrangements, which began with the first signs of
 his illness in 1972, went awry within weeks after
 his death. On February 7, Politburo member Hua
 Kuo-feng was publicly listed as acting premier,
 raising questions about the status of Chou's
 hand-picked successor, Teng Hsiao-ping, who
 had been rescued from the obscurity of a purge
 victim of the Cultural Revolution and groomed
 for several years to succeed Chou. Teng had been
 de facto premier for over a year.
 Teng's return to power had had the full en-
 dorsement of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, but the
 party's left wing, which had been responsible for
 Teng's purge a decade ago, has never accepted
 him. Leftists launched an indirect attack on Teng
 in December, criticizing proposed changes in the
 educational policies adopted during the Cultural
 Revolution. A more pointed attack on him in
 People's Daily on February 6 indicated his ap-
 pointment was in trouble. The tone of the attack
 was reminiscent of leftist assaults on Teng a
 decade ago. The propaganda onslaught strongly
 suggests the party's left wing retains something of
 a veto over major appointments-at least when
 such controversial persons as Teng are involved.
 The possibility that leftist agitation over the
 education issue, agitation prompted in part by
 Teng's growing power, might lead to widespread
 disruption may have persuaded Mao to abandon
 Teng in the interests of stability. The Chairman
 may never have been fully comfortable with
 Teng, with whom he had major differences in the
 early 1960s. His previous support of Teng,
 however, leaves the Chairman open to charges
 that he has backed yet another "wrong horse"
 should Teng not recover politically.
 There is no evidence that Teng has again
 been purged, but the party's left wing has
 mounted a vicious and only thinly veiled attack
 on him. Hua Kuo-feng's designation as "acting"
 premier-a point he emphasized to a foreign am-
 bassador-suggests the succession to Chou En-lai
 is not fully settled, leaving an outside possibility

 that Teng could eventually get the job, though
 the chances appear quite slim.
 Teng's actions over the past year have not
 helped his cause and may well have served to an-
 tagonize groups other than the left. As army chief
 of staff, for example, he has moved close
 associates into key military posts, possibly
 alienating some powerful regional military com-
 manders. He has also rehabilitated several
 old-line party officials, which certainly has an-
 tagonized the left. The climax may have come last
 autumn, when directives announced the return of
 several cultural officials who were the initial vic-
 tims of the Cultural Revolution and whose
 rehabilitation was a blow to the left.
 Despite Mao's endorsement of their
 rehabilitation, these men never appeared public-
 ly. In December, a new directive announced that
 their former boss, the party leader in charge of
 culture, had been exiled from Peking. This move
 suggested the left was attempting to redress the
 balance.
 Although the left will take comfort in the
 current setback to Teng, the appointment of Hua
 is far from a leftist "victory." Hua was called to
 Peking after the fall of defense minister Lin
 Piao-a time when the left was reeling-and lef-
 tists attacked him by name in 1974. He is obviously
 a compromise candidate. He rose to power dur-
 ing the Cultural Revolution, making him more
 acceptable to the left than Teng, but he was not
 associated with the excesses of that period, which
 makes him acceptable to the more conservative
 party  members.  His  position  as  a
 middle-of-the-roader was presumably the
 primary recommendation for his appointment.
 As security minister, the party leader in
 charge of agriculture, and former province chief,
 Hua has some experience in domestic affairs. He
 has been running agriculture for three years and
 is closely associated with China's current effort to
 mechanize agriculture as part of a long-term
 economic modernization program, one with
 which Teng is also associated. He is not likely to
 depart from current domestic policies, although
 the proposed changes in educational policy are
 presumably in abeyance.
 Hua lacks experience in foreign affairs and is
 unlikely to initiate any major changes in China's
 foreign policy, especially while the succession
 issue remains in doubt. Foreign policy, however,
 may have played a secondary role in the struggle
 That led to his appointment.
 China's party members will probably be un-
 settled by Hua's unexpected appointment; most
 of them expected Teng to succeed Chou without
 trouble. This new evidence of instability and divi-
 sion in the party leadership will have an adverse
 affect on morale. Moreover, the fact that Chou's
 careful preparations for succession to his office so
 quickly fell apart suggests that Mao's
 arrangements for his own succession are likely to
 be equally fragile.

 JAPAN
 Japanese firms are in a strong position to take
 advantage of a sustained US economic upturn. As
 a result, we expect Japan's trade surplus with the
 US to reach $1.7 billion this year, compared to a
 $1.1-billion surplus in 1975. Despite sagging US
 demand, the Japanese share of US imports of
 manufactured goods last year increased from 22
 to 24 percent of the import volume. Steep cuts in
 export prices accounted for most of the increase;
 in dollar terms, prices of goods sold in the US fell
 an estimated 18 percent last year.
 US recovery will probably continue to run
 ahead of Japan's and cause US imports from Japan
 to increase faster than Japan's imports from the
 US. In addition, Japanese businessmen still face
 substantial inventories, whereas inventory adjust-
 ment in the US has been nearly completed.
 The upswing in Japanese sales to the US
 began last September and will continue through
 1976. The volume of Japan's exports to the US
 should grow about 9 percent, to about $12.8
 billion. Shipments of steel will probably run
 slightly above the 1975 figure of 5 million tons.
 Shipments of other intermediate products, such
 as textile materials, chemicals, and plastics, will
 rise perhaps 3 percent in volume this year.
 A substantial increase in Japan's exports of
 motor vehicles-18 percent of exports to the
 US-seems assured. Japanese plans call for a
 40-percent increase in shipments this year. A
 strong marketing program and generally com-
 petitive prices will help Japanese auto firms main-
 tain their 9-percent share of the US market. Ex-
 ports of other consumer products will register
 small gains at best. Sales have stagnated in recent
 months, despite the revival in US consumer spen-
 ding, largely because of increased competition
 from low-cost suppliers such as South Korea,
 Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
 Japanese imports from the US will total about
 $11.1 billion, up 10 percent from the 1975 level.
 Imports of agricultural products-almost one
 fourth of the total-should increase 5 percent in
 volume this year and perhaps 10 percent in value.
 Larger purchases of feed grain, mainly sorghum,
 will account for most of the volume growth; im-
 ports of wheat and soybeans will be up slightly.
 Large inventories and the sluggish pace of in-
 dustrial growth in Japan will restrain raw material
 imports from the US. Only lumber imports will
 show a substantial increase.
 The slow recovery in fixed investment in
 Japan will keep a damper on purchases of US
 machinery and equipment. Imports of these items
 fell 15 percent in value last year and even more in
 volume. With almost all Japanese consumer in-
 dustries still operating well below capacity, any
 increase in demand for consumer durables will be
 met domestically.
 The scandal in Tokyo over alleged payoffs by
 the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to Japanese
 officials has clearly placed the ruling Liberal
 Democratic Party on the defensive.
 In response to vociferous demands by the
 opposition, Prime Minister Miki has promised a
 full investigation of the revelations made in US
 congressional testimony by Lockheed's president
 late last week. Miki and other conservative party
 leaders apparently hope that a rapid airing of the
 issue will curtail the damage to their image. The
 government has agreed to call a number of
 businessmen already implicated to testify under
 oath before the Diet next week.
 The conservatives have limited the impact of
 previous scandals by restricting the release of in-
 formation as well as the scope and pace of official
 investigations. This time, however, the informa-
 tion is being made public in Washington.

 Miki was almost certainly not involved in the
 payoffs, but some leading members of the
 Tanaka, Ohira, and Nakasone factions as well as a
 number of senior bureaucrats may be implicated.
 No government officials or party leaders have
 been named as principals in the affair so far. Those
 now holding government or party posts would
 undoubtedly be forced to resign. Conceivably,
 Miki himself might be compelled to step down if
 the scandal spreads further within the party, but
 at this point he seems reasonably confident that a
 limited number of resignations, combined with
 the public's relatively short memory of such
 matters, will suffice to defuse the situation.
 Nevertheless, the scandal has already dis-
 rupted government and conservative party plans.
 Defense officials, for example, are reviewing their
 earlier decision to purchase Lockheed antisub-
 marine aircraft. Meanwhile, conservative party
 leaders have begun to play down the prospects
 for  general  elections  this  spring.
 INDONESIA: THE LAST ACT IN TIMOR
 After several months of advancing into
 eastern Timor at a snail's pace, the Indonesians,
 spurred by a desire to prevent the UN fact-finding
 mission from visiting Fretilin areas, in the past two
 weeks moved quickly to capture most of the
 remaining towns and all airfields. Marines and
 paratroopers, with air, armor, and naval support,
 captured Fretilin strong points at Suai, Lautem,
 and Lospalos, and infantry units moved into
 Bobonaro, Vequeque, and Betano.
 The Indonesian occupation of the coastal
 towns and airfields forced the UN envoy to aban-
 don attempts to arrange sea or air transportation
 from Australia to Fretilin-held areas. The envoy,
 who last month was treated to a carefully manag-
 ed tour of Indonesian-controlled areas on the
 northern coast, left Australia on February 8 for
 Geneva. UN Secretary General Waldheim, who
 was visiting in Australia, said he did not consider
 the representative's mission terminated, but set
 no timetable for his return, adding that the
 Security Council now faced a fait accompli.
 Jakarta will probably now attempt to delay
 raising the Timor issue at the UN for as long as
 possible in the hope that by the time the topic
 does come up for consideration, they will be in a
 position to argue that Timor's integration into In-
 donesia is an accomplished fact and that the UN
 no longer has a role to play.
 Jakarta should be able to establish quickly an
 adequate civil administration in the towns. In the
 interior, however, Indonesian commanders are
 finding it difficult to expand their control. Some
 units have suffered significant casualties and are
 having difficulty protecting their supply lines and
 rear areas. Jakarta has shown a determination to
 cope with remaining resistance.
 Fretilin forces, on the other hand, are
 gradually disintegrating. Faced with mounting
 casualties, dwindling supplies, and growing
 numbers of defections, they are withdrawing into
 the rugged mountains of the interior.           125X1

 CUBA: CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM
 Cubans go to the polls on February 15 to ap-
 prove a new constitution. The government has
 for some months indicated publicly that it con-
 siders near unanimous approval of the constitu-
 tion a foregone conclusion. This confident
 presumption may be intended as a subtle threat
 to those who might be tempted to vote "no" to
 register dissatisfaction with regime policies such
 as Cuba's increased military role in Angola.
 This will be the first time since 1959 that the
 government has risked its prestige in a national
 referendum. The risk is admittedly small; the
 government has spent much of the past ten
 months publicizing the draft constitution and giv-
 ing the population ample opportunity to make its
 sentiments  known  through  the  mass
 organizations. Rigging the vote to give the im-
 pression of widespread popular approval will
 probably be unnecessary.
 mal means of political succession designed to en-
 sure the continuity of the revolution.
 Approval of the constitution will also tend to
 undercut two main lines of criticism leveled at the
 Castro government from abroad, mainly by
 Cuban exiles: failure to honor pledges to submit
 the regime to the test of a vote; and failure to
 restore the Constitution of 1940 as Castro had
 promised before he came to power.
 The new constitution will replace the out-
 moded Fundamental Law of February 1959, a
 hastily concocted document based loosely on the
 Constitution of 1940 that Castro originally used to
 give his regime temporary legal underpinning.
 Although the Fundamental Law is technically still
 valid, it has in effect been replaced with rule-
 by-decree by the Council of Ministers. The new
 constitution will give the Castro government
 more substantial legalistic window dressing.
 Part of the new constitution will go into effect
 by means of a constitutional transition law on
 February 24, one of Cuba's major political
 holidays. The remainder will be implemented on
 December 2-Armed Forces Day-the date set for
 convening the first National People's Assembly.
 Some 5.5 million Cubans will be eligible to vote,
 and the mass organizations will work to ensure a
 large turnout. Voting is not required by law, but
 those who want to maintain their political and
 social standing will be sure to underscore their
 revolutionary bona fides by appearing at the
 ballot box.
 With the approval of the constitution, the
 Castro regime will have reached another impor-
 tant milestone in the process of institutionaliza-
 tion that began in 1970. The full implementation
 of the constitution and the convocation of the
 National People's Assembly will signify the final
 consolidation of the Cuban revolution, terminate
 the provisional nature of the regime's political
 and administrative apparatus, and establish a for-
 GUATEMALA: THE EARTHQUAKE
 The earthquake and aftershocks that struck a
 broad belt of Guatemala last week, killing
 thousands and causing widespread destruction,
 dealt the economy a grievous setback. The dis-
 aster came just as the economy was recovering
 from a mild slump and its future looked bright.
 Before the calamity, agricultural exports were
 increasing and tourism was providing a healthy
 boost to the economy. Adding to the favorable
 economic prospects were large amounts of
 capital for oil exploration and development.
 Initial reports indicate that the oil exploration
 region in the Peten area did not suffer, but that
 tourist, agricultural production, and shipping
 facilities were hard hit.
 Most other sectors of the economy were also
 dealt heavy blows. Railroads, main highways,

 bridges, power and telecommunications lines,
 and the port of Puerto Barrios on the Atlantic
 sustained major damage. The Guatemala City -
 Puerto Barrios highway has been rendered im-
 passable by over 100 landslides and the collapse of
 two large bridges. Half the capital's fuel supply
 and much of its food supply comes over this
 highway. President Laugerud has asked for a US
 engineer battalion to help clear the road. The
 railway from the Atlantic is also out of commis-
 sion. Three to six months will be needed to
 reopen it and the highway. The Inter-American
 highway is also blocked in places.
 The main pier at Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's
 biggest port, was destroyed. The port normally
 handles nearly all the country's banana and sugar
 exports and half its coffee shipments. Concern
 that the quake raised the sea bottom at Puerto
 Barrios, making the harbor dangerous to ships, is
 apparently unfounded-one ship with a 28-foot
 draft docked there on February 6.
 The US embassy reports that there is no im-
 mediate shortage of basic foodstuffs, particularly
 in Guatemala City. Over the longer run,
 agricultural production will suffer greatly since
 available money will be used to rebuild homes
 and other buildings rather than to invest in fer-
 tilizer and farm machinery. The banana plan-
 tations in the eastern part of the country were
 badly hit and may be slow to recover. Beans, a
 Guatemalan staple, will be in short supply for
 some time because the major bean growing
 region, Chimaltenango, bore the brunt of the
 quake.
 Some 220,000 homes were destroyed and
 over a million people, one sixth of the popula-
 tion, left homeless. The economy will probably
 require outside assistance for the massive
 rebuilding in store.
 Guatemala's principal problem in the coming
 weeks will be to organize and utilize the disaster
 aid that is flowing in from numerous foreign
 governments and private donors. The govern-
 ment has established a national emergency com-
 mittee to cope with the critical task of distributing
 food, medical supplies, and equipment, but it has
 already had a change in leadership because of
 reported inefficiency. The government has, in
 effect, turned over to the US government respon-
 sibility for relief in the worst hit areas, and the
 most effective efforts to date have been those of
 private organizations.
 The disaster has brought political activity to a
 standstill. The talks with the British on Belize,
 scheduled to begin on February 9, were post-
 poned for at least two weeks. An important
 meeting on Central American economic integra-
 tion  has been canceled. Certainly, any
 Guatemalan plans to invade Belize will have to be
 set aside for some time, if not abandoned. Even
 so, the government's rejection of British govern-
 ment aid confirms that its attitude on Belize has
 not wavered. There is no word on whether the
 disaster will prevent President Laugerud from
 meeting, along with the other Central American
 presidents, with Secretary Kissinger in San Jose,
 Costa Rica, later this month.

 GUYANA: TOWARD A ONE-PARTY STATE
 Guyana will celebrate its tenth-and possibly
 its last-anniversary as a parliamentary democracy
 this May, if Prime Minister Forbes Burnham has
 his way. A committee of the ruling People's
 National Congress is drafting a new constitution
 that is expected to sweep away the last vestiges of
 former British rule and transform the country into
 a de facto one-party socialist state.
 The tentative timetable calls for the new con-
 stitution to be submitted to parliament around
 May 26-Independence Day. A plebiscite is to
 follow within six months. Burnham's control of
 the political situation is so pervasive that there will
 be little effective opposition from the majority
 East  Indian  population or  moderate
 Afro-Guyanese.
 In fact, there is evidence to suggest that
 Cheddi Jagan's East Indian - based People's
 Progressive Party plans to end its long-standing
 opposition to the government and return to
 parliament under a private agreement reportedly
 worked out between Jagan and Burnham. Jagan's
 party protested Burnham's vote-rigging in the
 1973 general elections, and party representatives
 have since refused to take their seats in parlia-
 ment. Details of the new arrangements are not
 known, but at a minimum Jagan would have to
 support the proposed constitutional changes; in
 return, Burnham might allow Jagan or his
 representatives some form of participation in the
 government.
 This arrangement would benefit both parties.
 For Burnham, support of the major opposition
 party is essential if he should attempt to seek ap-
 proval for the new constitution through an honest
 referendum. For Jagan, a return to parliament
 would end the party's political isolation, satisfy his
 reported desire to have a say in the new constitu-
 tion, and assuage his principal bankrollers, the
 USSR and Cuba, who have been urging Jagan and
 Burnham to come to terms.
 The Jagan party newspaper, the Mirror, has
 apparently received instructions to reflect the
 new cordiality between the once-bitter an-
 tagonists and has toned down its attacks on the
 government's legitimacy.  In turn, the
 government's mouthpiece, the Daily Chronicle, is
 reporting activities of the opposition party
 leaders. An official statement by the People's
 Progressive Party that it would resist attempts by
 "imperialist agents" to topple the Burnham
 government received heavy coverage in the
 government's press.
 The strengthening of ties between the two
 parties was also apparent last December when
 representatives of both parties traveled together
 to Havana to attend the Cuban Communist Party
 Congress. Jagan later made his first known
 appearance at a government-sponsored event,
 one honoring visiting representatives of the
 Angolan MPLA. If Jagan's support continues
 through the coming period ofconstitutional
 change, Burnham will have little difficulty forging
 his socialist state. Tentative steps have already
 been taken in that direction by introducing a
 quasi-compulsory National Service camp for
 youths, making political indoctrination man-
 datory in the schools, and increasingly concen-
 trating economic power in state corporations.
 This process will take time even with the
 political power that Burnham is able to wield. To
 make the new system work, Burnham must
 galvanize                       people into a    25X6
 strongly regimented society in the face not only
 of general public apathy and alienation from the
 East Indian majority, but lethargy and corruption
 within the governing party.
 ARGENTINA: LABOR SUPPORT WANES
 President Maria Estela Peron may be on the
 verge of losing her only remaining source of
 significant support, the powerful labor movement
 that was once synonymous with Peronism. Some
 labor leaders are now saying that they would be
 willing to see the army oust her.
 Union leaders are angry over their systematic
 exclusion from government decision making,
 now the province of a few of Peron's personal ad-
 visers. Some suspect that the President's inner cir-
 cle advised against the last general pay increase,

 and most were upset by the dismissal of the
 respected economy minister, Antonio CafierQ, a
 labor favorite.
 The latest affront was the President's open
 bid last week to renew relations with dissident un-
 ionist Vittorio Calabro, the Buenos Aires provin-
 cial governor who was read out of the Peronist
 movement some months ago. Calabro has long
 been the most important challenger to labor's
 two main leaders. Union heads met Monday to
 discuss how to respond; one proposal calls for all
 labor representatives in congress and the govern-
 ment to resign simultaneously.
 The labor movement's estrangement from
 the administration would remove a major impedi-
 ment to a military take-over. For some military
 leaders, an open break between-Peron and labor
 would be seen as proof of the popular repudia-
 tion they feel they need to justify intervention.
 One labor leader is said to have confided that
 workers would raise only symbolic resistance to a
 military coup. Reluctance to involve troops in
 clashes with workers has been an important con-
 sideration to officers who have so far hesitated to
 move against the governments
 Last year, the administration, at the urging of
 then strong man Lopez Rega, tried to rescind a
 wage increase for workers. The result was a
 general strike that not only restored the wage
 hike, but also led to the ouster of Lopez Rega.
 What labor wants now is not higher wages, but to
 break the presidential inner circle's hold on
 power.
 PERU: BUYING TIME
 The Morales Bermudez government has
 successfully staved off the labor wolves at its door
 for now, but trade unions are planning new
 demonstrations to express dissatisfaction with the
 austerity program and the lid imposed on wages.
 The labor movement and its sympathizers
 want to capitalize on general discontent over ris-
 ing prices and food shortages to convince Peru-
 vian leaders that there should be no slowdown in
 the revolutionary process and, moreover, that a
 radical change in labor policy is imperative.
 The recently formed Unifying Council of
 Labor Organizations, an umbrella group led by
 Moscow-oriented unionists, has been planning a
 mass rally in downtown Lima on February 18, the
 day of Secretary Kissinger's visit. The government
 can be expected to ban any such activity, but ex-
 tremists might try to create enough disorder to
 force the government to suspend civil guarantees.
 Radicals probably hope to force the cancela-
 tion of a demonstration set for February 20 by the
 American Popular Revolutionary Alliance-a
 long-time enemy of the left. A 48-hour strike
 sponsored on February 2 by the Aprista labor con-
 federation fizzled, in part because other unions
 did not cooperate. In addition, the government's
 timely decision to abrogate a 1913 law restricting
 rights to strike, and its formation of a tripartite
 commission (government, labor, and manage-
 ment) to study labor problems helped to dampen
 the strike attempt. These can be considered little
 more than stopgap measures. If the government is
 unable to satisfy workers on the wage question, it
 is almost certain to face wider-and perhaps more
 troublesome-work stoppages in the future.
 The labor problems confronting the Morales
 Bermudez government will not be easy to resolve.
 The government is faced with an urgent need to
 enforce fiscal austerity measures. Peruvian
 leaders, fully aware that economic conditions
 could worsen, hope to defuse the tense labor
 situation, or at least prevent the unions from
 better coordinating their actions. This is likely to
 prove difficult, since many unions that did not
 join in supporting the recent general strike share
 opposition to the government's wage policies and
 seem prepared to step up their demands.

 OPEC: NEW AID FACILITY
 The aid facility agreed to at an OPEC finance
 ministers' meeting during the last week of January
 falls far short of the expectations of non-oil
 developing countries. The announcement of the
 new facility follows almost two years of OPEC
 debate on whether the oil cartel should handle
 aid funding. The $800 million in pledges is short of
 the $1 billion annually suggested by an agreement
 in principle reached late last year. The life of the
 facility is limited to one year-1976-instead of
 the five years urged by the co-sponsors, Iran and
 Venezuela. Intended largely as a political gesture
 to win support of oil-importing developing coun-
 tries, the new arrangement will make only a small
 contribution to aid.
 . Eleven OPEC members tentatively pledged
 contributions, which must now be ratified by the
 national governments. The shortfall in pledges is
 mainly due to lower than expected commitments
 by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the United Arab
 Emirates. Indonesia and Ecuador committed no
 funds, but they were not expected to contribute
 more than token amounts in any case. The poor
 response of the three Arab countries stems from a
 desire for greater control over the choice of
 recipients, from continued political infighting
 among cartel countries, particularly Saudi Arabia
 and Iran, and from disagreements as to the
 method of determining the size of contributions.
 OPEC considered two distinct schemes to ap-
 portion donor shares. Iran and Venezuela

 proposed tying pledges to a minimum of 10 cents
 per barrel or about 1 percent of oil export
 revenue. Algeria and other states with balance-
 of-payments constraints instead advocated tying
 contributions to surplus revenues. Unable to
 agree on a uniform standard, the OPEC countries
 ended up haphazardly pledging amounts suiting
 their individual interests.
 The formal structure of the facility is still un-
 clear. Iran and Venezuela urged an independent
 authority to administer the fund; Saudi Arabia
 argued instead for coordination authority to
 oversee bilateral disbursements. The final com-
 promise conforms more closely with the Iranian
 formula in that it establishes a "governing coun-
 cil" to formulate general policy, with voting
 power weighted by national contributions, but
 leaves to individual states the actual disbursement
 of funds. The size of Iran's and Saudi Arabia's con-
 tributions gives them veto power in the council.
 Nevertheless, it is not yet known whether the
 council will come under the formal OPEC struc-
 ture, which would require the approval of all 13
 OPEC members. The question will probably be
 decided at the next OPEC conference, scheduled
 for late spring.
 OPEC countries felt they had to come up with
 an aid package because of increasing pressure
 from non-oil developing countries for some form
 of relief from higher oil import bills. OPEC is
 counting on support from these countries on
 energy and economic Issues in the dialogue with
 developed countries at the Conference of Inter-
 national Economic Cooperation. Although OPEC
 members believe that the aid facility will provide
 useful leverage to assuage developing countries
 criticism, oil-importing developing countries will
 probably soon realize that this well publicized
 program has relatively little substance.
 Only a fraction of the $800 million under the
 facility will be new aid. Agreement has been
 reached to make at least part of OPEC country
 contributions to the International Agricultural
 Development Fund flow through the facility. The
 facility may also act as a channel for OPEC country
