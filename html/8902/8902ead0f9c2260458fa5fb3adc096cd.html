 PEIPING PAPER SCORES POLITICAL INDIFFERENCE
 AMONG PEIPING HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL COLLEGE PERSONNEL
 On 22 March 1952, the editors of the Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao, in the
 Letters to the Editor column, censured Peiping hospital and Union Medical Col-
 lege staffs. for permitting an atmosphere of indifference to newspaper reading
 to prevail among medical workers.  Such indifference was manifested in the
 following ways:
 1.  Approximately half the medical personnel of some hospitals did not
 read newspapers.
 2.  Man?r regular newspaper readers rarely looked beyond the headlines.
 3.  Many medical workers incorrectly comprehended, and some were totally
 ignorant of, the true significance of the three and five anti's campaigns.
 4.  Some persons at the Peiping Upton Medical College were totally ignorant
 of US bacteriological warfare 2 days after extensive newspaper coverage on the
 subject.
 5.  Five sixths of the medical personnel at Peiping Municipal Hospital
 No 4 who were able to read were generally indifferent to newspaper study.
 6.  The Peiping Union Medical College library did not subscribe to the
 Peiping !Len-min Jih-pao.
 The editors of the Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao held negligence in leadership
 quarters and among cadres to be the underlying cause for these shortcomings,
 stating that:, (1) leadership circles and responsible cadres on hospital staffs
 had been generally negligent about newspaper procurement and distribution and
 int.ensitive to the propaganda and indoctrination worth of such papers; and '
 (2) professors considered personal and student participation in newspaper read-
 ing sections as time-consuming and bothersome.

 Remedies for the situation, as submitted by the editors, various Peiping
 hospitals, and the Peiping Union Medical College, included the following:
 1.  Investigation of the condition of newspaper reading and the state of
 political appetites.
 2.  Organization of newspaper-reading sections and discussion groups.
 3.  Initiation of periodic examinations on current national and inter-
 national affairs.
 4.  Display of important national and international news items in promi-
 nent places inside the buildings.
 On 22 March 1952, the Peiping organ also carried a letter which reported
 the findings of a Land-Reform Delegation consisting of professors and students
 from Nan-ch'ang Normal.  Shortcomings in newspaper indoctrination work among
 local peasants were criticized:   peasants in Feng-ch'eng Hsien were totally
 ignorant of the current three and five anti's campaigns, and one village, only
 7 li from Nan-ch'ang, did not subscribe to party newspapers.  Propaganda and
 educational organs were exhorted to use newspapers in peasant indoctrination
 activity, and postal workers were told to ensure paper deliveries to the area.
 On 12 April 1952, letters appearing in the Letters to the Editor column
 of the Peiping Jen -min Jih-pao revealed that the Public Health Bureau of the
 Peiping Municipal. People's Government had been apathetic to this censure and
 that many medical workers at Peiping Municipal Hospital No 1 had no knowledge
 of the criticism.  Other letters indicated that measures had been taken to cor-
 rect the situation..
 The full texts of the letters of censure and of the replies are given
 below.
 A.    Letters to the Editor  Peipin$"jen-min Jih-pao," 22 March 1952
 1,  Editors Criticize Political Indifference
 The editorial desk of this newspaper has received letters from com-
 rades Yuan Chang, Chao ftng-shih, et al., criticizing indifference to news-
 paper reading in Peiping Union Medical College and Peiping Hospital No, 3.
 These have served to point up  the attitude of cadres and functionaries in
 various regions and agencies with regard to newspaper reading.  We have sent
 reporters to Peiping Hospital No 3, Pei-ta Hospital, and Central People's Hos-
 pital to investigate and have found that the negligence of medical personnel
 in newspaper reading has reached serious proportions.
 According to this investigation, the number of personnel who read
 newspapers earnestly and regularly is very small.  Most of them will read a
 paper if they happen upon it; if not, it makes little difference to them.  Other
 employees are completely illiterate.
 In the Visiting Nurses Department of Peiping Hospital No 3, of 50-odd
 medical workers, one fifth do not read the papers and only six of the others
 are earnest in their reading.  Pei-ta Hospital has a total of 432 doctors,
 nurses, and employees of newspaper literacy.  Of these, only 17 percent read
 the papers seriously, and 49 percent read absolutely no newspapers.  The rest
 just scan the headlines. Many employees are, consequently, completely ignorant
 of the pertinent facts regarding the great three and five anti's campaigns.

 Political indifference is the principal source of reading negligence
 among hospital. employees.  Although the political consciousness of many health
 workers is daily increasing, their demands for newspapers have still not been
 met by timely aid and enlightened leadership.  There have arisen in leadership
 circles comditio:,c which prevent top-level functionaries from  quickly correct-
 ing shortcomings.  Some leaders are not alive to the truth that our newspapers
 are the primary irstruments for effecting, on the practical level, indoctrina-
 tion in Marxism-Leninism and the ideology of Mao Tse-tung, the organization
 and motivation of the masses, and, as primary indoctrination agents, the im-
 plementation of correct party and governmental policy.  Such leaders do not
 faithfully lead hospital personnel to newspaper reading.  Also, administrative
 quarters are unable to supply personnel with the optimum number of newspapers.
 For example, Pei-ta Hospital has approximately 1,000 medical workers and
 patients but only 25 newspapers.  This is another reason why the masses have
 not been able tc read newspapers.
 We hope that responsible leaders will consider this problem seriously
 and correct the Sndtfference to ne.   aper reading among hospital personnel.  An
 immediate and thorough investigation should be undertaken and a newspaper study
 system, with organizations capable of meeting mass needs, shall be set up.
 Various techniques should be employed to arouse and nurture reading appetites
 and the political consciousness of the masses.  We hope that leadership cadres
 and political workers in the various organs will investigate and correct in-
 complete and inefficient reading activity and inform this paper regularly by
 mail. -- The Editors
 2.  Readers Criticize Neglect of Newspaper Reading
 at Peiping Union Medical College
 Although the fatherland is now engaged in the great Resist America-
 Aid Korea, the Production Increase and Austerity, and the three anti's cam-
 paigns, there are many persons openly indifferent to newspaper reading.  Peiping
 Union Medical College has some of these persons.  We recognize that such serious
 condi.tions had to b?. exposed and corrected.
 First, we investigated newspaper reading among hospital workers: of
 300-odd (including professors, doctors, nurses, and hospital assistants), 142
 are newspaper readers but rarely read beyond the headlines, 145 will not or do
 not read the papers regularly, and 21 never read the papers.  In a word, over
 half do not read newspaper; -- an alarming percentage.  The library of the
 Peiping Union Medical College has not subscribed for even one copy of the
 Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao:
 Many employees mafntain that they dc not read the papers because they
 are too busy.  Some nurses say;   "After an 8-hour workday, we are so tired that
 we just hurry home to'rect," leaving no time for reading.  As a matter of fact,
 after leaving work, they feed their canaries, listen to phonograph records,
 and plan their new habits -- solely thoughts concerning plea.;ures.  Nurse
 Chiang I-ch'ien conceded,    At Peiping Union Medical Col]r-ge I was not only
 able to study specialist techniques which could give me a very high specialist's
 rating, but also lived in excellent style, ate the best food, and became com-
 pletely Westernized."
 There is, among the nurses, a deep feeling of be-ng "mere exployees."
 This has caused general indifference to important national matters.  ThrougL-
 out the day they carry about with them the notion that "If you pay us with
 money, we will come to work on time  bi'.t at the end of the day, we will hurry home

 to look after the children,"  Some professors and doctors are wholly concerned
 with research for their scientific theses and in rushing around the wards,
 neither hearing nor asking questions about outside matters.  Several profes-
 sors consider it a nuisance to participate in study sections, asking  If we are
 to be servants of the people, why must we read these newspapers and study
 politics?"  During classes, when students demanded that a period be set aside
 for political studies, the professors rejected the proposal, averring that the
 curricula allowed no time for such studies.
 This neglect of newspaper reading is a manifestation of serious po-
 litical indifference and has created political backwardness at Peiping Union
 Medical College.  During the three anti's campaign, some middle and small cor-
 rupt elements at the college, having failed to read newspapers and heed govern-
 mental policies, could nct cast off their ideological biases.  It was later
 discovered that even during the five anti's campaign, some persons were totally
 ignorant of the movement.  Of greater importance, 2 days after the bestial US
 bacteriological warfare atrocities were published in the papers, there were
 still persons at the college totally ignorant of the matter. How can we be of
 greater service to the people with such hospital workers?
 We cannot deny, of course, that the Peiping Union Medical College has,
 since liberation, made momentous progress under the guidance of the party and
 the people.  During the Ideological Feform and the three anti's campaigns, many
 persons have undergcne complete metamorphosis and made signal advances in po-
 litical consciousness.  over 1,000 persons have enlisted for bacteriological
 warfare defense work.  We are aware, hcw'ever, that this is insufficient and
 hope that medical workers, currently indifferent to national affairs, will be
 able to correct this defect, take interest in the people's newspaper, study '._e
 ideology of Mao Tse-tung, stand ever more resolute on the principle of service
 to the people, and share the burden of national reconstruction. -- Yuan Cheng,
 Hsieh Chi-liang, Li Ling-yuan, and Wen Chu-fang.
 Most workers at Peiping Municipal Hospital No 3 are indifferent to
 current events study.  The condition is especially acute among nurses.  We have
 recently learned that 40 percent of our nurses do not read the papers and that
 the others merely glance at the headlines   Pegular and interested newspaper
 readers constitute a small minority,  Therefore, nurses and other hospital work-
 ers either know very Little or are totally unaware of vital current national
 matters.  For example, many workers professed no knowledge of the fact -- promi-
 nently published in our papers ?- that the bourgeoisie had mounted an organized,
 ferocious attack against us..  Many hospital workers were totally ignorant of
 the Chi K'ai-fu Incident -- a matter closely related to their activities.    his
 incident involved the framing of a hospital worker by an executive of Wuhan
 Municipal Hospital.]
 When questione,_ about this neglect of newspaper reading, some insisted
 that they were tou busy.   .,e klow that this is not the real reason. It is, rather,
 personal political indifference.   Upon our request, a female comrade recapitu-
 lated her daily program for us.                                                   There was no mention, however, of having felt
 obliged to read the daily paper..  She remarked.   "A day passes rapidly.  Who
 has time for newspapers?"  We detect in her words the old style of thinking --
 the notion that laundry and mending are the primary chores of womankind.  She
 has not yel come to realize that male and female must, in egalitarian union,
 participate actively in the reconstruction of th:. fatherland.

 Some persons maintain that in not reading the papers and disregarding
 important national matters, one may retain "purity and detachment."  This is
 ridiculous!  Indifference to political and current affairs is, consequently,
 universal among medical Personnel.  We have informed the medical workers' labor
 union and the executive leaders of the critical nature of this problem.  We
 hope that a standard newspaper rr-ding system and organization will be set up
 to ensure study, that seminars will be periodically convened, and that examina-
 tions in current affairs be effected to stimulate newspaper reading,-- Dr Chao
 Ying-shah and Head Nurse Wan Hui-chen, Peiping Municipal Hospital No 3
 4.  Reader Ctiticizes Poor Distribution of Party Papers
 Among Peasant Populace
 Party newspapers are the pivots of mass propaganda, indoctrination,
 and organization.  It is imperative that they reach ever-expanding worker and
 peasant audiences.
 There are, in Fen;-ch'eng Hsien, Kiangsi, many ch'u and hsiang govern-
 ment cadres who completely neglect the vital work of indoctrination through
 newspapers.  During January and February 1952, professors and students of the
 Nan-ch'ang Normal Land-Reform Delegation visited 13 ch'u undergoing land reform
 in Feng-ch'eng Hsien and discovered that the following hsiang did not subscribe
 to any newspaper:  Ts'ao-ch'i, Shang-tee, Ku-tang, and Shao-fang.  The pea-
 sants in these hsiang thus were totally ignorant of the three and five anti's
 campaigns which have been carried on with great fanfare in the cities of China.
 Shih-li Hsiang, only 7 li from Nan-ch'ang, does not subscribe to a single news-
 paper.  Ch'u and hsiang cadres excused themselves on grounds that "simplicity
 and austerity" or "lack of public funds" made newspaper subscriptions im-
 practical.
 Thus, political studies and understanding of current affairs in this
 rural area have been grossly neglected.  This has, in turn, led to a failure
 to disseminate party and Central People's Government policy and decrees quickly
 and extensively to the peasant masses.  It has impeded the growth of peasant
 political consciousness and the development of rural production.  Propaganda
 and indoctrination organs in the area should recognize the utility of party
 newspapers in educating the masses.  Postal distribution officers should work
 to disseminate the people's newspapers among the peasant masses. -- Chia
 Jen-sheng
 B.    Letters to the Editor, Peiping "Jen-min Jih-pao," 12 April 1952
 1.  Reader Rebukes Public Health Bureau for Indifference to Criticism
 Comrade Editor:
 The Public Health Bureau, Peiping Municipal People's Government, has
 failed to heed the criticism printed in the Letters to the Editor column in the
 22 March 1952 issue of the Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao.  In dozens of hospitals,
 health establishments, and health corps, neglect of newspaper reading by per-
 sonnel is extremely extensive.  The Public Health Bureau has found no remedy for
 the situation.  Even after criticism by the party newspaper, the bureau failed
 to investigate and correct the poor state of newspaper reading among individual
 health workers and to strengthen the current affairs and political studies of
 cadres as suggested by the party paper.

 Such indifference to newspaper criticism is entirely erroneous.  I hope
 that the Public Health Bureau will immediately correct this error and that re-
 sponsible leadership organs will issue a warning decree -- as sharp as that of
 the party newspaper -- that neglect of newspaper reading and study among subor-
 dinnte cadres of the bureau be investigated and corrected. -- Heiao Erh-wen
 2.  Editor Agrees With Reader's Criticism
 The observations of reader Hsiao Erh-wen are timely. We hope that in-
 cumbent cadres in the Public Health Bureau, Peiping Municipal People's Govern-
 ment, will immediately effect the indoctrination of subordinate personnel in
 current affairs and political studies and ensure the reading of newspapers.
 This is training that will strengthen  ideological  and  political  leader-
 ship. -- The Editor
 3.  Peiping Municipal Hospital No 1 Investigat.s Current Affairs Study
 Comrade Editor:
 After reading the criticism in the 22 March 1952 issue of the party
 paper, we of Peiping Municipal Hospital No 1 have carried out an investigation.
 The majority of our doctors are regularly able to read the papers, but
 a large number of our nurses and assistant nurses do not.  Like certain personnel
 in other hospitals, they insist that they are too busy and have no tiie for read-
 ing.  After the start of the three anti's campaign, these workers read newspapers
 less frequently.  One obatetricie^ said:  "Since I have little time for the
 movies, I no longer peruse the newspapers for movie advertisements."  A nurse
 in surgery remarked that "In leisure moments, I must read surgical manuals, study
 English, and prepare, generally, to transfer from the hospital to a better job.
 I have no time left for newspaper reading."  There are seven workers in her
 surgical section. At present, 3 months after the hospital subscribed to news-
 papers for them to read, t"o of them still know nothing about these papers.
 Our hospital has many workers with no knowledge of important interna-
 tional and national matters, and, even more important, they had not heard of the.
 criticism published in the 22 March 1952 issue of the party paper.
 As a result of the investigation, we have come to realize that, cur-
 rently, the basic problem in the hospital is political indifference.  "No  ime
 to read" and "too busy" are excuses for indifference to newspaper study.

 4.       Peiping Municipal Hospital No 2 Reforms Newspaper Reading Methods
 Comrade Editor:
 After reading the criticism of newspaper reading among hospital work-
 ers, we investigated and found that indifference to newspapers is very serious
 in our ho,3pital.  According to an investigation of 80-odd employees with news-
 paper literacy, more than half had not been reading newspapers.  Those who
 regularly read the papers, did not draw correct conclusions from them.  Accord-
 ing to the results of oral tests, some know absolutely nothing cf the "Thursday
 Dinner Society" in Chungking, the Chi n'ai-fu Incident in Wuhan, the current Mos-
 cow International Conference, and the International Peace Conference at Oslo.

 Why  was such a state of affairs tolerated for so long?  The major
 blame must fall to the 1:'aders.  According to our investigation, despite the
 fact that many employees wished to read newspapers, the leaders did not promptly
 meet their demands.  Lu ;Leng-ch'uan, formerly deputy director of this hospital,
 was responsible for the political and ideological leadership of the entire hos-
 pital.                                           He was, unfortunately, personally indifferent to all political matters,
 became decadent, and was, in the course of the three anti's campaign, relieved
 of his post.  There is, consequently, little to show for the indoctrination of
 personnel in politics and current affairs.  For our staff and medical workers
 totaling 150 persons, only four papers had been ordered (of which one copy was
 retained for the office of the director).  In November 1951, under the weight
 of united mass demands, the quota was raised to eight papers.  Since leadership
 was inferior in quality and no newspaper reading system had been effected, per-
 sonnel disregard for papers remained uncorrected.
 The Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao criticism has motivated our investigation
 of all hospital Farsonnel,  On 2 April 1952, all personnel gathered to discuss
 the problem and decided to set aside one hour daily for newspaper reading,
 after which formal and informal discussions on important topics would be held.
 We hope that .:'ther hospitals and organs are able to investigate the
 condition of newspaper reading and study and correct all manifestations of
 political indifference, -- Administrative Office, Austerity Inspection Committe,
 Peiping Municipal Hospital No 2
 Recently, wc, carried out an investigation of the condition of news-
 paper reading and study among personnel of the Peiping Municipal Hospital No 4
 and found that of 90-odd employees with r.-w_paper literacy, five.or six remain in-
 different to reading the papers.  Many, because of such reading negligence,
 became gradually estranged from political su:jecta.  For example, the bestial
 crime perpetrated by Ch'en Huai-chiu, l~ct'.r_er in chemistry, Chemistry Depart-
 ment, Wuhan University, who aided merchant Li Yin-t'ing in preparing first-aid
 bandages which later infected troops of the People's Liberation Army -- this
 crime which has aroused anger and resentment throughout China -- has gone com-
 pletely unnoticed by these medical workers,  Many were found to be totally
 ignorant of the matter.
 When asked  why they did not read the payers, many insisted that they
 were too busy with work schedules:   "What time remains after participation in
 the three anti's, epidemic control, and our regular work?"  Some say:   "When
 time permits, we must read technical works; if not, we will surely fall from the
 ranks."   It has even gone so far that some concede: "basically, I have not cul-
 tivated the hs'+'t of reading newspapers."  In point of fact, these are the real
 results of an apolitical, purely tec:nnical orientation.
 In an effort to correct this grave condition of political indifference
 quickly and effectively,    have organized all hospital personnel and plan to
 carry out discussions on newspaper reading..  We recognize the central problems
 to be suppression of e.rront~ous political indifference, and creation of political
 appetites for careful and regular newspaper reading..
 We must first carry through a four-point program for newspaper reading
 and study;

 as  Organization of newspaper reading sections from hospital work com-
 mittees, drafting of schedules for regular study, and incessant investigation
 e,,d enforcement of study activity.
 b.  Assignment of competent personnel to explain important political
 matters in simple terms to persons incapable of reading or correctly appraising
 newspaper articles..
 c.  Designation of special areas in the hospital for maximum efficiency
 in dissemination and use of newspapers, and assignment of special personnel to
 control such distribution,
 d.  Proper integration and centralization of campaigns for current
 affairs reporting and seminars, and periodic testing of personnel on newspaper
 reading aptitude and study achievements. -- Work Committee, Peiping Municipal
 Hospital No 4, Yin Teung-?ch'i
 We rectgnire that the criticism of 22 March 1952 is entirely correct.
 The source of the difficulty lies in the insufficient recognition of executive
 leaders of the fact that our newspapers art the directors of practical work and
 the best instruments for =.leveting the political and ideological level of cadres.
 Although the hospital had subscribed to many newspapers, we had not sufficiently
 concentrated on enforcing newspaper reading and  had not organized a regular
 newspaper reading syete^,   Therefore, many workers were totally ignorant of im-
 portant national and ir.?ternatianal political matters which should have been
 brought to their attention.
 To thoroughly correct such political indifference, we have decided to
 raise our subscription q?;Cta for three offices with comparatively few papers and
 to regularize current affairs examinations.  At present, after having read the
 Letters to the Editor criticism, many of the hospital personnel have been or-
 ganized into newspaper Yeed_ng sections, and a schedule for reading sd study
 has been arranged.
 The apol.iii?:si tend ncies cf nurses are being changed.,  at present, the
 head nurse in surgery personally directs the nu:,.es in daily readings.  There
 remain several offices, so -      in wiicn -.here is insufficient regard for the
 Peiping Jen-min Jin-pao criticism.  These have consequently failed to correct the
 condition of i.isregard for reading..  We are now arranging a system whereby they
 will be organized and ail hospital -mployees will be required to read and study
 regularly.
 The Peiping party paper nad also criticized the ignorance of hospital
 personnel concerr. cg the Chi K'ai-fu Incident.  As stated above, this condition
 is universally prevalent among cur nurses.  Some doctors with a high  regard for
 newspaper study  sec   cognizant of this important political metter, -- Adminis-

 out complete confessions and drafted a program for reform.  They prompted per-
 sonnel to confess. and initiated a  criticism and self-criticism campaign to meet
 the erroneous tendency of indifference to newspaper reading.
 This is the present state of reform in the college:
 a.  The newspaper subscription quota has been raised from 25 to 83.
 b.  Personnel have been assigned to newspaper reading sections in which
 papers are daily read for at least one-half hour and discussion on important
 matters is encouraged.
 c.  Examinatio..s on current affairs have been instituted to enforce and
 assist in newspaper study.
 d.  Responsible individuals have been given the task of clipping im-
 portant articles, or portions thereof, from the daily papers and posting them
 on the main entrance, in the dining room, and at other prominent points in the
 buildings.
 The hospital authorities have gone so far as to draw up plans for news-
 paper reading among patients. -- News Organization, Peiping Union Medical College
