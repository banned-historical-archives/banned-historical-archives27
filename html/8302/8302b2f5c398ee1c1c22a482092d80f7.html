 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX                  A1309
 lift our economy onto  another plane-a
 plane on which it can move forward more
 consistently and more rapidly in the future
 than it has been able to in the past. This is
 the only kind of economy that would give us
 more jobs, more sales, more income-and
 more construction-not only for next year or
 for the next 2 years, but for many years
 and perhaps for even decades to come.
 For richer or poorer, the performance of
 the construction industry-as of all our in-
 dustry and all our people-is indissolubly
 wedded to the performance of our economy.
 And how well our economy performs in the
 years ahead depends on how far we today
 can look beyond our parochial and conflict-
 ing self-interests to the larger self-interest
 common to us all that the President's tax
 prograt,,is well designed tppjlerve?
 ductive investment would be heightened  from welfare and relief costs, leaving more
 through enlarged demand and through re-
 duced corporate tax rates .which will Increase
 ,aftertax profits.   And the production  of
 new machines and the building of new fac-
 -tories, offices, stores, and apartments would
 further increase consumer incomes in the
 same way as would the expanded production
 of consumer goods.
 No in ustry as large as the construction
 Industry, as vital and as closely linked to
 the country's economic well-being, can afford
 to ignore these very real implications of
 the President's tax   ogram.  In the four
 quarters ending in the last quarter of 1962,
 our rate of economic growth was only 2.7
 percent-compared with our entirg,postwar
 --average of 3.4 percent.  If in 1964 we were
 merely to return to this postwar average-
 :and we fully expect to do better than that-
 Alien by the end of that year we could expect
 -business construction. expenditures, should
 they do no more than retain their. present
 ;percentage of total output, to rise by roughly
 around $2 to $3 billion over the present $21.2
 billion.  But should a new and more brisk
 .,investment atmosphere restore to business
 construction the proportion of total output
 ,it held in the late fifties, then we might
 :expect expenditures to rise by more than
 twice that amount.
 .Certainly in a period of accelerated eco-
 nomic ?growth, which the tax program is
 designed to foster, industry will not find it
 sufficient to concentrate its investment in
 new equipment alone.   For increased de
 ..mind for,present products, and the increased
 profitability of expanding present capital
 investment fof existing goods and processes,
 would create a highly favorable atmosphere
 -for new products and processes and the new
 ,plants needed to produce them.
 Industry is, of course, not the only or
 even the largest market for the construc-
 tion industry.  But I think it is quite clear
 ,that in your other markets as well a similar
 ,process would occur. , In 1962, for example,
 .State and local governments financed $11.3
 billion, or almost one-fifth, of all construc-
 tion  activity. Yet many         State  and  local
 ,government units have found it increasingly
 difficult to finance, not only many new and
 needed projects, but needed expansions of
 ,present projects.  New schools, new urban
 renewal  developments,  "greater  matching
 .funds for highways, new roads, and many
 -other  programs suffer  because  State  and
 "local "governments simply -cannot find the
 ,revenues necessary to support them.
 The economic expansion we anticipate as
 a result of the P_esident's tax program offers
 e genuine opportunity for a health increase
 sin State and local-revenues to finance needed
 .public construction  without  raising  State
 and local tax rates.  This must be of more
 than passing importance to you in view of
 the Increasing recistance to rises in State
 and local tax rates and bond issues for con-
 struction purposes.
 Within a few years, the proposed tax pro-
 gram will lift our gross national product
 -substantially over what it would otherwise
 be.  Assuming that this additional growth
 would amount to $50 billion,per annum,
 .then this would mean an increase of 8 per-
 cent, or $3.5 billion, in tax revenues col-
 lected by States and local units at present
 effective rates.  The State of Michigan, for
 instance,  would realize $2.5 billion as its
 proportionate share of the , gross national
 product increase.   Or should the induced
 increase in gross national product reach only
 a range of $30 billion, then this would mean
 an increase of over 5 percent, or $2 billion,
 in State and local tax revenue.  Michigan's
 proportionate share would be $1.5 billion.
 And throughout the country the reduction
 in Federal taxes, along with greater pros-   us cope more readily with any difficulties in
 perity and lower unemployment, would les-    the immediate road ahead.  It was designed

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. BRUCE ALGER
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. ALGER. Mr. Speaker, the follow-
 ing article from U.S. News & World Re-
 port of March 18, 1963, "The Bay of
 Pigs: The Curtain Is Lifting," is but an-
 other story of the emerging truth of
 U.S. backdown.
 The most disconcerting part, of course,
 is to learn so long after the fact what
 part the United States played and to
 learn it almost by happenstance rather
 than to be forthrightly told by our own
 national leaders.
 This further story of the Bay of Pigs
 disaster adds to our knowledge of what
 took place although we have not yet been
 told the full story by the President and
 those responsible.
 Under leave to extend my remarks. I
 include the article in the RECORD.
 BAY OF PIGS: THE CURTAIN Is LIFTING
 That clamp of secrecy on what happened
 at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961, just will not
 stay put.  Information keeps leaking out.
 Now it shows: Americans were in far deep-
 er than officials admit.  And U.S. air power
 was ready to go on a moment's notice.
 More  and  more details  are  breaking
 through the curtain of secrecy to show how
 deeply Americans were involved in the Bay
 of Pigs invasion of Cuba.
 For 2 years, the official story in Wash-
 ington has been that the attempt to over-
 throw Fidel Castro in 1961 was an all-Cuban
 affair.  But it is clear now thalkmany Amer-
 icans took part in it, and that U.S. forces
 were poised, ready to join in.
 U.S. Navy jets, their identifying insignia
 painted out, were lined up on airstrips at K'y
 West, Fla., within easy striking distance of
 the Bay of Pigs.  They never got the signal
 to go.
 A U.S. aircraft carrier, jets ready on her
 flight deck, was on station near Cuba.  Other
 American jets were in the air almost con-
 stantly, patrolling  just  off  the                                                                                                                           invasion
 beaches.
 American frogmen scouted the beaches in
 advance of the attack, American combat vet-
 erans flew B-26 bombers into the battle zone
 and  piloted  planes carrying Cuban para-
 troopers who were dropped in advance of
 infantrymen.
 None of these men were members of the
 regular U.S. Armed Forces, although several
 Approved For Release 2004/06/23 : CIA-RDP65B00383R000200220015-2
 The point, I think, is abundantly clear:
 In the expanded economy which the Presi-
 dent's tax program is fully capable of gen-
 erating, the construction industry cannot
 help but thrive.  But let me make it equally
 clear that the proposed tax program that
 can provide this stimulus is a program of
 tax reform as well as rate reduction.  Nor
 should anyone deceive himself into believing
 that, without any of the proposed reforms,
 the tax program would be as effective as I
 have described it,  The President himself
 has emphasized that of all the reforms the
 largest and the most important is rate re-
 duction itself.  This, however, should not be
 interpreted to suggest that the reforms are
 merely something added to the program as
 an afterthought with no importance in and
 of themselves. The reforms, I can assure
 you,  are an essential part  of  the overall
 program.
 Everyone  agrees  that  the  tax  program
 must include, as its most important ele-
 ment,                                                                  substantial tax reduction and rate
 reduction.  But not everyone realizes that
 the proposed reforms are vital-not only in
 terms of equity, hardship relief, and eco-
 nomic growth-but to the very achievement
 of larger rate reductions than would be fis-
 cally responsible without them.  With the
 reforms it is possible to obtain rate cuts
 of $13.6 billion, together with additional help
 for the poor and aged which bring this flg-
 ure well over $14 billion, at an overall cost
 of only $8.8 billion.  The reforms-including
 the gradual transition to a more current tax
 payment  basis  for         corporations-will,  in
 other words, offset more than $5 billion-
 well over a third-of the budgetary impact
 of the most important part of the program,
 the rate reductions and hardship relief.   The
 .only way, therefore, to achieve the largest
 possible rate cuts within the limits of fiscal
 .responsibility  is  to  combine  them                with
 base-broadening tax reforms.
 I do not mean to suggest that the Con-
 gress must accept the reforms in exactly the
 size and shape proposed by President Ken-
 nedy.  As the President himself has noted,
 this is a matter for the Congress to decide,
 What I do mean is that every measure which
 whittles away at those reforms must be com-
 pensated for in some fashion.  If one takes
 ,part of that $5 billion offset away, one must
 run the risk of a greater budgetary impact
 with the consequent fears of inflation that
 this may well raise in some quarters.   Or
 one has another alternative-one can whittle
 away at the rates themselves, thus blunting
 the overall thrust of the program by weak-
 ening its most essential part.
 My point is, in short, that the reforms
 are an essential and integrated part of the
 entire program.  Any effort to remove them-
 in part or entirely-is bound to have a price
 of its own.  Those who. oppose the reforms,
 whether they do so on grounds of principle
 or because   those reforms would interfere
 with the benefits they would otherwise re-
 ceive from the rate reductions, should re-
 flect upon the alternatives before they com-
 mit themselves irreparably.  They would look
 beyond what the program means in terms of
 dollars and cents tax cuts. They should look
 beyond what the program would put in their
 pocketbook this year, next year, or 1965.  If
 there is one thought I would like to leave
 with you today it is that you and, indeed,
 anyone seriously concerned with the eco-
 nomic welfare of this Nation should look
 very carefully at the tax program in the light
 of that welfare.
 This program was not devised as a quick
 shot in the arm for a lagging economy.  It
 was not devised as mere adrenalin to help

 were Air National Guardsmen. All were vol-
 unteers.  But after word got out that four
 American pilots died in combat at the Bay
 of Pigs, President Kennedy said this at his
 news conference on March B:
 "Let me just say about these four men:
 Th"y were serving their country"
 HOW  J. brim s
 These details can now be told.
 In the days just before the 1961 invasion.
 American frogmen swam to the landing
 beaches and carefully charted them for the
 infantry assault that was to follow.  These
 men Were civilians under contract to the in-
 vaders. All had been underwater-demolition
 experts in the V.8. Armed Forces at one time.
 On D-day-April 17-one American frog-
 man was with the Cuban underwater teams
 that went ashore ahead of the invasion.
 This American was in a rubber boat that
 was caught, by chance, in the headlights of
 one of Castro's jeeps.  He was able to escape
 and get back to the mother ship, standing
 offshore.
 At least one American is known to have
 piloted a  lanehold of Cuban paratroops
 from a staging base in Nicaragua to the point
 where they were dropped back of the beaches.
 8n route to Cuba, they flew low over an
 American aircraft carrier so the Cubans
 could see the jets positioned on her deck.
 On the second day-fipril 18-three Amer-
 ican airmen flew over the invasion" beach.
 Two, a pilot and copilot, were in a C-54
 transport plane that dropped ammunition
 to the Invaders.  The third was pilot of a
 8-26 bomber, trying to support the invading
 troops with attacks on Castro's forces.
 On at least one occasion, Castro jets bear-
 ing down on an Invasion transport veered
 off when U.S. Navy fighters came on the
 scene, not far offshore.
 It was on the last day-April 19 -that four
 Americans were killed in two B-28 bombers
 over Cuba.  Three other Americans did not
 reach the target area.
 Long before the actual attack, American
 volunteers were working with the Cubans at
 their , secret training base in Guatemala.
 Gradually, the fun scope of their activities
 In cooling to light.
 V.8. B-25 PILOTS Hffi.D
 On March 7, 1983, the Chicago Sun-Times
 reported that Air National Guard pilots from
 Alabama,        Arkansas  and  Virginia,  "were
 offered $2,500 a month by the Central In-
 telligence Agency to take part in the Cuban
 Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961."  The news-
 paper said pilots from the three States were
 "sought out because the Guard units of
 those States were the lost to fly the B-28
 bombers used In the Invasion.   The Word
 War U bomber was retired from the State
 units in 1958."
 The Chicago American Identified Brig. Gen.
 George Reid Roster of the Alabama Air Na-
 tional Guard as tactical commander of the
 anti-Castro force.  General boater refused to
 confirm or deny the report, but indicated
 he would like to tell his story to a con-
 gressional committee. He said: "I wish they
 would call me and let me put my feet on a
 desk and talk for about 8 hours."
 It had been reported earlier by U.S. News
 & World Report that at least 18 American
 airmen went to Guatemala to train Cuban
 pilots of the B-26 bomber fleet that the in-
 vaders had assembled.  These men were re-
 cruited for combat duty.  Later their orders
 were changed, limiting them to the role of
 instructors.  But when things started to go
 wrong at the Bay of Pigs, those who wanted
 to were permitted to go on combat missions.
 At least 10, maybe more, did so.
 There still Is no public report by the Ad-
 ministration on how many Americans were
 involved in the invasion, or what they did.
 But gradually, after 2 years of silence, some
 of those. Americans are beginning to tell their
 experiences.   And as their accounts are
 pieced together, the curtain of secrecy is
 lifting from the Bay of Pigs.
 Secretary Dillon Emphasizes Small Busi-
 ness Provisions of President's Tax Bill
 HON. JOE L. EVINS
 07 TENNSSSIE
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. EVINS. Mr. Speaker, as chairman
 of the House Small Business Committee,
 I am deeply interested in the effect of the
 President's tax proposals on the small
 business segment of our economy.  Tax
 reductions and revisions which are of
 benefit to small business are long over-
 due.
 The Treasury Department has submit-
 ted to me as chairman of the House
 Small Business Committee a memo-
 randum which summarizes the prin-
 ciple points in the President's tax pro-
 gram, which affect small business.  It
 appears that the benefits to small busi-
 ness under the proposed program will be
 extensive.
 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
 that Secretary Dillon's letter and the
 Treasury Department's memorandum be
 reprinted in the Appendix of the RECORD.
 The letter and memorandum follow:
 THE SECRETARY OP THE TREASURY,
 Washington, March 11, 1963.
 Hon. Jos L. EvINS,
 Chairman, House Select Committee on Small
 Business,  House  of   Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am enclosing pursu-
 ant to your request a memorandum which
 summarizes the principal points in the Pres-
 ident's tax program which affect small busi-
 ness.  Since small business plays a part in
 virtually every segment of the economy, all
 the proposals in the President's program may
 have some direct or indirect effect, but I
 believe the memorandum covers the major
 provisions and provides a good starting point
 for those Interested in the impact of the
 program on small business.
 I understand that John E. Horne, Adminis-
 trator, Small Business Administration, will
 shortly submit a more detailed analysis of
 the proposal as it affects small business to
 the Committee on Ways and Means.  This
 statement, when it is released. may also be of
 use to you and the committee.
 Sincerely yours,
 DOUGLAS DILLON.

 1964 and 1965.  But even when all three
 steps of the corporate tax cut are in effect,
 the  tax  reduction  for small companies
 would be greatest.   The reduction for com-
 panies with profits of $25,000 or less would
 amount to about 27 percent; for those earn-
 ing $100,000 to $1 million, it would amount
 to about 11 percent; and for those earning
 more than $1 million annually, it would be
 about 10 percent.  For the 467,600 corpora-
 tions with incomes of $25,000 or less, the
 annual tax saving would total about $233
 million.
 Small business will also benefit directly
 from the individual income tax rate cuts,
 which will average considerably more than
 20 percent.  The reductions will be made
 over a 3-year period and will scale down the
 present range of 20 to 91 percent to a range
 of 14 to 65 percent.  These rate cuts will
 help particularly the millions of individual
 proprietors and partners whose main, and
 sometimes only, source of income is from a
 business.
 The tax program will also benefit small
 business indirectly in a number of ways.  The
 reductions in individual tax rates will re-
 lease a large volume of additional consumer
 purchasing power.  More than 90 percent of
 the tax reduction will quickly find its way
 into consumer buying, boosting retail sales
 and, then, in turn, wholesalers' and manu-
 facturers' sales.  The resulting improvement
 in the business climate and confidence should
 be an important factor In sustaining an ex-
 panding economy.
 The  corporate and  individual  tax  cuts
 would result in higher after-tax profits and
 retained  earnings.  The tax program will
 thus help remove one of the most persistent
 deterrents to the growth of small business-
 a lack of adequate capital.  Because of their
 inability to obtain conventional long-term
 financing for expansion and modernization,
 small businesses are forced to rely on clostly
 short-term credit, which they must continu-
 ally refinance, to supplement their limited
 internally generated funds.  Tax reduction
 would increase the volume of earnings which
 can be plowed back Into small businesses to
 sustain  their  healthy  growth.  Tax  cuts
 would also attract new investment to small
 businesses, since the profitability of suchen-
 terprises would increase.  At the same time,
 increased profit prospects would improve
 their borrowing power.
 Inequities which now discriminate against
 small business will be removed by the tax
 program.  For example, a small business may
 be competing with a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of a large corporation; the subsidiary is a
 legal entity, hence able to take advantage of
 the benefits of the $25,000 surtax exemption.
 A company with a number of such wholly-
 owned subsidiaries can reduce substantially

 years of service, sometimes as many as 40
 years or more.  Why should accumulations
 over so great a number of years be taxed
 as if received over a 5-year period, or any
 other arbitrary period of time?  If the 5-
 year period is adopted, it will discourage the
 continuance of existing profit-sharing plans
 and the establishment of new ones.  Invest-
 ment of profit-sharing funds in stock of the
 employer company will be discouraged with
 an adverse effect on the incentive impact
 to employees.  The council is seriously con-
 cerned about the effect the Treasury De-
 partment  proposals  will  have  on  profit
 sharing, particularly profit sharing in small
 companies.
 The administration proposal would result
 in an increase in the taxes which most em-
 ployees covered by deferred profit-sharing
 plans would pay on lump-sum distributions.
 An inevitable byproduct of its adoption
 would be a trend among employees to take
 their distributions over longer periods of
 time.  This would conflict with what em-
 ployees themselves prefer,  A recent study
 by the council shows that where alternative
 forms of distributions were available 70 per-
 cent elected to take their  benefits in  a
 lump sum rather than in installments. The
 study also showed that 97 percent of the
 plans reporting provide for lump-sum dis-
 tributions.  It is also significant to note
 that in most cases profit-sharing plans are
 supplemental to fixed pension payments,
 such as social security, or those provided
 under private pension plans.  The purpose
 of profit-sharing plans in these instances is
 to provide the employee with a capital sum,
 in addition to the guaranteed retirement In-
 come which he will receive over his retire-
 ment years, which he can use for various
 personal needs such as entering a business
 of his own, educating his children, buying
 a home, meeting extraordinary medical ex-
 penses, et cetera.
 A  further  byproduct  of  distributions
 made over longer periods of time would be
 that the governmental revenues would be
 decreased over what they would be when
 lump-sum distributions are made.  In fact
 many distributions which are now taxed
 would not be taxed at all if spread over a
 long enough period of years.
 It has been said that the present method
 of taxation of lump-sum distributions from
 deferred profit-sharing plans  Is a device
 which principally benefits highly compen-
 sated employees.  A recent survey by the
 council indicates that out of over 4,000 lump-
 sum distributions to retired employees of
 223 companies during the period covered, 92
 percent were made to persons whose annual
 compensation range was $10,000 or less.
 TREASURY PROPOSAL IS COMPLEX
 The Treasury Department proposal will
 inject additional complexity into the tax law.
 Each employee receiving a lump-sum distri-
 button must go through the following sepa-
 rate computations:
 First, he must compute the tax on one-
 fifth of his lump-sum distribution plus his
 income other than salary received from his
 employer;
 Second, he must compute the tax on his
 income other than salary income received
 from his employer;
 Third, he must subtract the tax deter-
 mined under the second step from the tax
 determined under the first step;
 Fourth, he must multiply the resulting
 figure by five to obtain his partial tax at-
 tributable to his lump-sum distribution;
 Fifth, he must then compute his income
 tax on all of his income including his salary
 income from his employer but excluding his
 lump-sum distribution; and
 Sixth, he must determine his final tax by
 adding the partial tax on the lump sum de-
 termined under the fourth step to the tax
 determined under the fifth step.
 The Treasury proposes to substitute this
 complex system in place of the present com-
 paratively  simple,  well-understood  capital
 gains method.
 In addition to the 6-year averaging device,
 the Treasury Department proposes to contin-
 ue to tax as capital gains distributions at-
 tributable to accumulations now existing un-
 der profit-sharing plans. The 5-year averag-
 ing device for part of the distribution and
 capital gains treatment for the remainder of
 the distribution inject complexities into the
 tax law which will make it (a) difficult for
 the Internal Revenue Service to administer;
 (b) difficult for trustees to administer; and
 (c) most important of all, difficult for tax-
 paying employees to understand.
 Secretary Dillon indicated that this change
 in the Income tzx law is not designed to pro-
 duce additional revenues when he stated in
 the  technical  explanation  that:  "For the
 average employee, the tax on his lump-sum
 distribution will be roughly the same as he
 would pay under the present capital gains
 rates"  Moreover, the Treasury Department
 estimates that the lump-sum amendment to-
 gether with ot'ier capital gains definitional
 changes will bring in only $8 million addi-
 tional revenue.  The President has stated
 that tax reform should be directed to en-
 couraging growth and employment, and that
 it would be unwise "to launch into a full-
 scale battle on general reform for academic
 reasons."  It is respectfully submitted that
 in an age of $100 billion Federal budgets,
 with a Federal debt in excess of $300 billion,
 a proposal which involves less than $8 million
 of revenue and which is so complex, must
 be characterized as "academic.'
 UNREALIZED  APPRECIATION  ON  EMPLOYER
 STOCK
 Now, a word about lump-sum distribu-
 tions which include stock of the employer
 corporation.               Frequently  such  stock  ap-
 preciates in value between the time when it
 was acquired by the profit-sharing trust and
 the time when it is distributed to the em-
 ployee.  Under present law the employee does
 not have to pay tax on this unrealized ap-
 preciation of the employer company stock
 until the employee sells or otherwise dis-
 poses of this stock.  If the employee had
 invested his money directly In such securi-
 ties, the gain would not be taxed to him un-
 til he actually disposed of the securities, and
 at that time the appreciation would be taxed
 as capital gain.  Under the Treasury Depart-
 ment's proposal, the appreciation on stock
 purchased with both employer and employee
 contributions would be taxed as ordinary in-
 come.  Moreover, the gain would be taxed
 before the time that the employee actually
 receives his gain by selling the stock.  The
 result Is that employees will not contribute
 to profit-sharing plans which distribute se-
 curities of the employer, and the incentive
 element of such plans will be killed.  In ad-
 dition, the proposal will curb the desirable
 trend toward wider diffusion of Ownership
 of American industry, which has been en-
 couraged by plans which distribute securi-
 ties of the employer.  For these reasons the
 council strongly opposes any change in the
 present law on the taxation of lump-sum
 distributions which include stock of the em-
 ployer corporation.
 THE DEATH BENEFIT EXCLUSION UNDER
 SECTION  101(b)
 The Secretary of the Treasury has also
 recommended that the present $5,000 exclu-
 sion available to the beneficiary of a de-
 ceased profit-sharing participant, under sec-
 tion 101(b)  of the Code, be eliminated to
 the extent that the deceased employee was
 covered by group life insurance carried by
 his employer.  Most certainly this proposal
 will be detrimental to the widows and or-
 phaned children of deceased employees who
 were covered under profit-sharing plans.
 The council is opposed to any such pro-
 posal which will run contrary to the welfare
 of these beneficiaries.   The present exclu-
 sion under the existing law is limited to
 $5,000 and certainly cannot be considered
 a provision to benefit highly paid employees.
 The council strongly urges the committee
 to reject this proposal because it will further
 diminish the value of profit sharing as an
 economic incentive which is so important
 today.
 CONCLUSION
 The Council of Profit Sharing Industries
 appreciates very much the opportunity of
 presenting our views to you this morning.
 Profit sharing is an effective means of de-
 veloping cooperation and efficiency; it helps
 create harmonious labor-management re-
 lations; it helps create a sense of partner-
 ship between employer and employee; and
 it benefits employers, employees, stockhold-
 ers and the Government.  The number of
 qualified profit-sharing plans has increased
 since 1930 from a few plans to more than
 33,000 plans today.  This growth in profit-
 sharing plans has been materially aided by
 the wise tax policies adopted by Congress.
 We fear that the complex and inequitable
 proposals of the Treasury Department will
 have an adverse effect on the entire profit-
 sharing movement.  We therefore urge that
 this  committee  recommend  against  any
 change in the present rules for taxing lump-
 sum                                                                                                                                 distributions from  deferred profit-
 sharing plans,

 Function
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. HENRY S. REUSS
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 4, 1963
 Mr. REUSS.  Mr. Speaker, as former
 Chief of the Legislative Reference Serv-
 ice, Dr. Ernest S. Griffith has a familiar-
 ity with the problems and operations of
 Congress that is well known to Members
 of this House. Dr. Griffith, now dean of
 the School of International Service at
 the American University, has made a
 valuable contribution to the considera-
 tion of the possible adaptation of the
 Scandinavian office of Ombudsman to
 the American political system. I there-
 fore call particular attention to his
 views on the subject. I would refer also
 to my remarks on the Ombudsman in
 the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of February
 11, 1963, pages 2078 through 2084.
 Dr. Griffith's views follow:
 DEAR CONGRESSMAN REuSS: Just a note by
 way of response to your letter of February
 27, concerning the office of Ombudsman.
 If such an officer were at the disposal of
 Congress, and confined his activities to serv-
 ing such congressmen who cared to use him,
 I believe that he might fulfill a most useful
 function.   While I was in the Legislative
 Reference Service I was impressed by the
 way in which we of the Legislative Reference
 were able to assist in providing information
 requested by constituents.  However, even
 so, often we were aware that there were
 functions  in connection with  specific  in-
 quiries concerning decisions in the executive
 branch which it was unsuitable for us to
 handle.  Someone with more power and with
 the specific function of watchdog would be

 ,Where Reds May Take Over Next in
 HON. BRUCE ALGER
 o? TXZAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. ALGER.                    Mr. Speaker, so long as
 the Monroe Doctrine is not reimposed
 in this hemisphere; so long as commu-
 Ilisin, Castro and Khrushchev control
 Cuba; so long Is the danger of subver-
 sion to the other Latin and South Amer-
 ican countries of this hemisphere.  The
 danger is no less real to the United States
 but is not so immediate as it is to the
 others Qf.Latin and South America.
 Where next will the Communists strike
 and through subversion as well as overt
 terror and violence cause Government
 to fall, to be replaced by a Communist
 regime?
 The attached article from the March
 18. 1963, issue of U.B. News & World Re-
 port, entitled "Where Reds May Take
 Over Next in Latin America" indicates
 that Guatemala may be next.  Others
 have pre+ilicted Haiti. No one knows, of
 Course, for sure which will be next. One
 thing, however, we know for sure that
 until and unless the Monroe Doctrine
 is reimposed someone will be next, to be
 followed by others.
 When will our national leaders realize
 ,
 ,
 only as a military base but as a center
 for fomentation, unrest and revolution,
 in other countries of this hemisphere.
 It us hope they wake up in time.
 WHO REDS MAY TAKE Ovaa NEXT IH LATIN
 RMEMCA
 Worry over the Communists In Cuba Is
 likely to preoccupy the Central American
 Presidents and U.S. President Kennedy at
 their March meeting in Costa Rica.
 But a
 king-sized headache for the United
 States Is building up here in the largest and
 { most populous Country
 It is th g           try of Central America.
 The          way things are going, Guatemala
 could become "the next Cuba," giving the
 Communists a base on the mainland of the
 Americas.
 Or, to prevent that happening, there may
 be a military takeover.
 A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPATON
 A political campaign in now underway to
 pick a successor to President Miguel Ydigoras
 Fuentes In a national election next Novem-
 ber. The front runner by far. at this stage,
 is a former President-Juan Joad Ardvalo-
 who once opened the door to communism in
 Guatemala and went Into exile when the
 Communists were later overthrown.
 With elections little more than half a year
 away, the Communists and their followers
 are recognized as the best organized political
 force in Guatemala.  The active anti-Com-
 munists are disorganized and divided.  And
 the rest of the voting population seems
 pretty much disinterested in what happens.
 Ardvalo, whether he disavows it or not,
 has the quiet but determined support of
 Communists  and  fellow  travelers. The
 Guatemalan Communist Party, which has
 had experience in running this country once,
 is rated as seasoned, tough and thoroughly
 disciplined.
 WHERE REDS, ARE STRONG
 Hard-core membership in the party is esti-
 mated at 1,500.  But party influence actually
 is far greater than that number indicates,
 since the Communists are particularly strong
 among students, young professional people,
 teachers, and In several key unions.
 There is also evidence that the social secu-
 rity system and the lower courts have been
 heavily infiltrated by Reds.
 A lull In Communist activities has been
 noticeable lately.  The common belief is that
 the Reds are staying in the background,
 planning to make their move only after the
 elections.
 With non-Communist factions divided or
 apathetic, political experts say the only ele-
 ment that remains capable of stopping the
 Ardvalo bandwagon is the nation's armed
 forces. Defense Minister Enrique Peralta re-
 cently announced that Ardvalo will not be
 permitted to take office again.  The clear
 implication is that the military will inter-
 vene and take over the country, if necessary.
 IF ARMY SHOULD ACT
 But Guatemalans are beginning to doubt
 that the army, whose participation would
 be vital, has the capacity to move. After an
 air force uprising was put down last Novem-
 ber, the armed forces united in a pledge of
 military respect for constitutional govern-
 ment.  Now a move to block the election
 would he interpreted by some officers as a
 violation of constitutionality.  The result
 might bring a split, with the danger of a
 military civil war.
 It Is former President Ardvalo's history
 and background that give the major concern
 to those who fear a Communist takeover
 here.
 Most Guatemalans do not consider Ardvalo
 a Communist.  He is regarded as an ambi-
 tious opportunist, with an Irrational hatred
 of the United States.  It was Ardvalo, at the
 close of his earlier term, who arranged for
 Jacobo Arbenz to get the Presidency In 1951-
 a move that turned the country over to rule
 by Communists.
 ILZ-FOR HEALTH
 When the pro-Communist Arbenz govern-
 ment was overthrown by a revolt in 1954,
 Ardvalo  was                                    out of  the  country, serving
 abroad as an ambassador.  He decided it
 would be healthier to go into exile.   He
 opened his present campaign while living
 in refuge In Mexico.
 In recent months, the former President
 has been hard at work trying to spread the
 Idea that his anti-Americanism is past his-
 tory and that his present candidacy has the
 backing of the U.B. Government.  His sup-
 porters have made that claim so often and so
 Insistently, in fact, that the U.S. Embassy
 has been kept busy denying it.
 Despite his current protestations of U.B.
 March 11
 friendship,  many  Guatemalans feel  that
 Ardvalo, once elected, would have no choice
 but to open the way for the Communists
 once again.  They reason it this way: Busi-
 nessmen, the church, and a good part of the
 armed forces, will never support Ardvalo. To
 govern, therefore, he will have to court the
 continued support of the Communists who
 are now disguising themselves as "reform-
 ers."
 Also, Ardvalo'a opponents point out, Fidel
 Castro took power In Cuba disclaiming Com-
 munist sympathies-then promptly turned
 the place over to them.
 Complicating the political outlook here is
 the experience, so far, with the Alliance for
 Progress program.
 Guatemalan   officials,   from   President
 Ydigoras Fuentes on down, consider that the
 Alliance for Progress is too slow and too de-
 manding in Its emphasis on reforms to be
 of much help to the local economy.    They
 have adopted a land-reform law and the
 first income tax in the country's history In
 the hope of starting Alliance money Sowing.
 But they insist that both changes are going
 to hurt Guatemala's economy in the long run.
 WHY LOANS LAG
 Since March of 1961-the date the Alliance
 for Progress Is considered to have gone into
 effect-Guatemala has received less than $10
 million in new loans.  This, combined with
 $26 million which was still in the pipeline of
 past aid programs when the Alliance for
 Progress started, gives the country a total of
 $38 million in loans that have not yet been
 drawn down.
 According to U.S.  officials,  the  reason
 Guatemala doesn't get loans faster is that
 It doesn't take the action necessary to set
 the loans in motion. They tell stories of
 loans  that  were  not drawn   against for
 months because officials didn't get around
 to openings bids.  In other Instances, the
 Government has failed to prepare projects
 that would justify loans for technical assist-
 ance.
 Alliance loans for water and sewerage proj-
 ects and for low-income housing remained
 unused, say U.B. officials, because Guatemala
 was supposed to put up one-third of the
 amount, and claimed she didn't have the
 money to do so.
 A WESTERN SISEUP
 One Western official stationed here says
 that the whole trouble is that the Govern-
 ment "doesn't have the slightest idea of
 what the Alliance is all about." His explana-
 tion :
 "What is wrong is that you are dealing
 with a society here that has a concept of
 mankind opposed to that of Western civiliza-
 tion.  In Guatemala, the educated, the peo-
 ple of means and their children, are inter-
 ested only in amassing as much as they can
 for themselves  and  their  families.   They
 have no sense of obligation to the rest of
 society."
 Says another official:  "You would think
 that after Cuba, in self-interest, these peo-
 ple would change to relieve some of the eco-
 nomic pressure on the rest of population.
 However, they are as uncompromising as
 ever."
 There are plenty of problems here, regard-
 less of who is to blame.
 Operating expenses of the Government go
 up and up.  'Until last June, the  United
 States donated $10 million a year to support
 Guatemala's budget.  This has since been,
 cut off, and the Government-with a budget
 of $105 million-now has running debts with
 Its supplers of between $15 and $18 million.
 Next  to Venezuela,  Guatemala  has  the
 highest cost of  living in  Latin America.
 Critics say this is because the Government
 imposed high protective tariffs to raise in-

 out of the money econorhy.  Conditions,
 nevertheless, are bad.  There is widespread
 unemployment, and an even larger problem
 of underemployment.
 After student riots last year, a flight of
 capital developed.  There is a lack of new
 investment.  U.S. private investment is esti-
 mated at $125 million. But neither foreign-
 ers nor Guatemalan investors seem willing
 to put new money into the economy.  This
 has been accentuated by uncertainty over the
 election.
 HEADING FOR TROUBLE?
 Outwardly, there is an impression of rela-
 tive calm in Guatamala City. Yet, when you
 listen more closely, you hear worried people
 everywhere saying that their country needs
 peace, but it is heading toward chaos and
 conflict.
 For the rest of Central America, and for
 the United States, the worry is that out of
 conflict and chaos will emerge one of two
 things:  another military dictatorship, or
 another Cuba.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. DEROUNIAN.  Mr. _Speaker, Mr.
 Stefan Pomiersli, a constituent of mine
 who truly understands the nature of the
 Communist beast has written me of the
 Katyn Forest massacre of thousands of
 Polish officers, by the Russian Commu-
 nists, 23 years ago, and I feel his letter
 should be placed in the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD for all to read:
 Hon. STEVEN B. DEROUNIAN,
 House of Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  STEVE:  As we are approaching an-
 other Spring, in many communities wher-
 ever Americans of Polish extraction, will be
 gathering, they will pause in a few moments
 of silence to pray for the souls of some ten
 thousand Polish officers massacred in the
 Katyn Forest near Smolensk, Russia in the
 gruesome days of the Spring of 1940.
 Material gathered by the Polish Govern-
 ment-in-exile  (at present in London)  and
 by a congressional committee investigating
 the facts, evidence and circumstances of the
 Katyn Forest Massacre, without doubt es-
 tablish the identity of the perpetrators of
 the cruel mass murder as the evil and godless
 forces of the Red Kremlin.
 It is said that this material is sufficiently
 convincing to present all the facts to the
 General Assembly of the United Nations re-
 questing an indictment of the guilty parties.
 On this 23d anniversary of the Katyn Mas-
 sacre, the voices of the souls of these mur-
 dered Polish  officers go out to this great
 country of ours, which has always stood in
 the defense of justice and honor, in the hope
 that neither fear nor timidity will induce
 the leaders of the free world to be silent,
 when fortitude and firmness and courage in
 a just cause be tested, be it the rape and be-
 Florida Port Calls for Closing All Trade
 With Countries Aiding Cuba
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. PAUL G. ROGERS
 OF FLORIDA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 11, 1963
 Mr. ROGERS   of   Florida.  Mr.
 Speaker, support continues to grow for
 strong action by the United States
 against those countries which permit
 their ships to supply Communist Cuba.
 Rer ently the governing body of Port
 Everglades, one of the largest and busiest
 ports in the Southeast, went on record
 supporting the closing of all U.S. ports
 to the ships engaged in Cuban trade.
 I ask that this resolution be printed
 at this point in the RECORD, and want to
 personally thank the Broward County
 Port Authority for their support, which
 is an indication of the personal sacri-
 fices that our public officials and citizens
 are willing to make to eliminate this
 Cuban threat to the security of all the
 Americas.
 The resolution follows:
 RESOLUTION 12-1963
 Resolution of the Port Commission of the
 Broward County Port Authority expressing
 its endorsement and urging the adoption
 of a_policy by the United States of America
 closing all American ports to vessels en-
 gaged in commerce or trade with the Re-
 public of Cuba.
 Whereas in view of the current Cuban
 crisis there is a growing sentiment among
 the  citizens and  residents  of the  United
 States of America that all American ports
 should be closed to commerce and trade deal-
 ing with the Republic of Cuba; and
 Whereas this sentiment has been exempli-
 fied                                                               as representative of the citizens and
 residents of the State of Florida by expres-
 sions of the Honorable PAUL G. ROGERS, Rep-
 resentative  from  the  Sixth  Congressional
 District of the State of Florida, on the floor
 of the House of Representatives of the U.S.
 Congress; and
 Whereas the Port Commission  of  the
 Broward County Port Authority is charged
 with the responsibility of the operation of
 Port Everglades in  Broward County, Fla.,
 which said port is a deepwater harbor which
 accommodates vessels which have dealt in
 commerce and trade with the Republic of
 Cuba, and  is  therefore cognizant of and
 vitally interested in the significance of such
 continued commerce and trade: Now, there-
 fore, be it
 Resolved by the Port Commission of the
 I 1305
 Broward County Port Authority, That it goes
 on record as being in favor of the United
 States of America adopting a policy which
 will close all American ports to vessels di-
 rectly or indirectly engaged in commerce
 with the Republic of Cuba; be It further
 Resolved, That copies of this resolution be
 forthwith forwarded to the Honorable John
 F. Kennedy, President of the United States
 of America, the Honorable Spessard L. Hol-
 land and the Honorable George A Smathers,
 Senators, and the Honorable Paul G. Rogers,
 Representative, and to such other persons in
 positions of public confidence and trust as
 shall be appropriate.
 Adopted at Port Everglades, Fla., this 19th
 day of February, A.D. 1963.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. CORNELIUS E. GALLAGHER
 OF NEW JERSEY
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr.     GALLAGHER.  Mr.   Speaker,
 much has been written about what pur-
 ports to be a new look in the Soviet
 Union. Chairman Khrushchev has with
 great ceremony turned his back on what
 he describes as the errors of the Stalinist
 era and has broadcast to the world much
 about the new freedoms he alleges in-
 dividuals now enjoy in the U.S.S.R.
 However, while the Soviets have un-
 deniably made some progress in mate-
 rial things since the collapse of czardom
 in 1918, there is serious question as to
 whether comparable strides have been
 made in human freedoms. Asa recent
 editorial in the Jersey Journal points
 out:
 Having done so well in material things,
 the next great stride forward must be in the
 matter of human freedom.  Today's Russians
 have rejected some of the unnatural re-
 strictions on normal human thinking which
 were attempted in the early days of their
 revolution.   To complete freeing the indi-
 vidual, they must now cease their relentless
 campaign against religion.
 This is a challenge which the Soviets
 cannot answer with another propaganda
 bombast; the reply must be found in
 true freedom of conscience and enjoy-
 ment of human rights within the bor-
 ders of the U.S.S.R.  Present-day So-
 viet anti-Semitism is a stern warning to
 the believer of all faiths as to what they
 might expect from Communist dictator-
 ship.  Soviet actions permit no other
 interpretations.  The world-and es-
 pecially the new nations of Asia and
 Africa-will pass stern judgment on So-
 viet racism as the sordid facts are
 brought to light.
 The December  7  editorial of  the
 Jersey Journal follows:

 OUTLOOK FOR  1963
 . The lumber industry (standard industrial
 classification code 2421) comprises approxi-
 rnately  32,000                      establishments  employing
 about 240,000 people.
 Lumber consumption is expected to total
 88.8 billion board feet in 1963, about 5 per-
 cent more than in 1962.  Prospects for the
 principal lumber-consuming industries are
 generally favorable.  In the construction in-
 dustry, total construction lumber require-
 ments in 1963 are expected to equal or exceed
 those in. 1962.
 .Expenditures for private and public con-
 struction are, expected to be 3.3 percent
 greater than in 1962.  Construction of new
 housing, largest single user of new lumber,
 is expected to Increase slightly in 1963. Con-
 struction of multifamily housing (two or
 more units), which has increased sharply in
 recent  years,  is  expected  to  level  off  at
 slightly more than the 32 percent of total
 housing construction reached In 1962.  Total
 consumption of lumber in residential con-
 struction has been held down in recent years
 because these multifamily units require less
 lumber than single-family structures.    Ex-
 penditures for residential alterations and
 repairs and for nonresidential construction
 (industrial,  commercial,  religious, educa-
 tional, etc.) are also expected to rise slightly
 in 1963.
 The pallet industry, one of the fastest
 growing lumber-consuming industries, used
 an estimated 1.7 billion board feet of lumber
 in 1962, which was 5 percent of total do-
 mestic production. Pallet production totaled
 68 million units in 1962, compared with 64
 million In 1961.  Production has increased
 steadily in the last 4 years-the  1962 in-
 crease amounting to the largest on record.
 Production  in 1963  is  expected to gain
 modestly.
 Shipments of nailed and wirebound boxes
 and crates will probably increase about 5
 :percent in 1963.  Shipments of nailed wood-
 en boxes and crates were about 7 percent
 thigher in 1962 than in 1961, and those of
 wirebound boxes and crates were 3 to 4 per-
 cent higher.
 Total shipments of household furniture
 may be about 4 percent greater in 1963 than
 ;he record high attained in 1962.  Value of
 shipments of unupholstered wood furniture
 -case goods)  totaled $1.6  billion in  1962,
 compared with $1.4 billion in 1961. Value of
 hipments of upholstered furniture was $900
 pillion in 1962, a record annual increase over
 he $802 million reported for 1961.      Value
 f shipments of wood office furniture may in-
 rease about 2 percent over the total 111
 862 of.$89 million.
 About 33 percent more railroad freight cars
 are expected to be constructed in 1963.  The
 railroads also expect to upgrade a larger
 number of older cars, thus tending to in-
 crease the consumption of lumber.  In 1962,
 36,555 new freight cars of all kinds were
 built,  12.5  percent more  than the 31,720
 cars built in 1961.  The construction of cars
 using wood, accounting for about one-third
 of the total, increased at approximately the
 same rate. . Procurement of railroad ties is
 expected to increase 5 percent over the quan-
 tity purchased in 1962, when the increase
 was 20 to 25 percent over purchases in 1961.
 In addition to demand from wood-using
 Industries, lumber production in 1963 will
 also be strongly affected by the level of im-
 ports (especially. of softwood lumber)  and
 the salvage of west coast timber blown down
 by the severe storm in October 1062.
 Total imports have risen from 1.3 billion
 board feet in 1947 (3.7 percent of apparent
 domestic consumption) to 4.9 billion board
 feet in 1962 (13.2 percent of consumption).
 Imports of softwood, accounting for 94 per-
 cent of total imports in 1962, have Increased
 rapidly in recent years, as follows:

 Source: Bureau of the Census; estimate for 1963, For.
 est Products Division, BDSA,
 On the basis of recent trends, total lumber
 imports in 1963 should be about 5.3 billion
 board feet.
 A severe storm on the west coast in Octo-
 ber 1962 blew down 11.2 billion board feet of
 timber.  To prevent an epidemic infestation
 of bark beetles and consequent additional
 loss of green timber, this timber must be re-
 moved rapidly.  The salvaged timber is ex-
 pected to boost production of logs (including
 sawlogs, plupwood  logs, veneer logs,  etc.)
 from 1 to 2 billion board feet above the level
 which might otherwise be expected.
 Growing demand for lumber in industrial-
 ized countries and export promotion pro-
 grams of both Government and industry may
 increase exports to 830 million board feet in
 1963, a 5-percent gain over 1962.
 At the estimated levels of consumption,
 imports, and exports, lumber production of
 about 34.3 billion board feet will be required
 to meet domestic demand in 1963,  Salvage
 of windthrown timber would raise total pro-
 duction by at least 1 billion board feet, which
 would be added to inventory.
 The average wholesale price index for all
 lumber  was  96.5  in  1962 (1957-59=100),
 compared with 94.7 in 1961 and 99.8 in 1960.
 The index for softwood in these years was
 95,9, 93.,5, and 98.6, respectively.  Excess pro-
 ' duction resulting from salvage of blown-
 ,down timber would tend to depress softwood
 prices in 1963.  It is estimated that each 300
 million board feet produced in excess of de-
 mand would reduce the price $1 per thou-
 sand board feet.
 REvoLUTION
 To the Honorable Senate and House of
 Representatives  c8 ' the  United  States  in
 Congress assembled: We, the members of the
 Ferry County Timbermen's Association, do
 respectfully represent that:
 Whereas lumber imports from Canada are
 increasingly yearly at an alarming rate and
 now constitute about one-sixth of the an-
 nual consumption of lumber in the United
 States; and
 Whereas there is a need to increase the
 cut from overmature forests to prevent ex-
 cessive loss from decay, disease, and other
 causes; and
 Whereas  a serious  blowdown  of timber
 occurred in Washington, Oregon, and Cali-
 fornia in October of 1962 and salvage of said
 blowdown timber will place a further burden
 an the orderly marketing of lumber from
 other domestic areas; and
 Whereas there is no shortage of timber for
 the production of lumber and related items
 in the United States; and
 Whereas U.S. lumber manufacturing firms
 pay the highest wages and provide working
 conditions equal to or better than similar
 firms In other countries; and
 Whereas lumber manufacturing firms in
 the  United  States  are  losing  their  home
 markets to foreign firms, especially Canada,
 due to advantages such as: (1) depreciated
 currency; (2) low stumpage rates; (3) non-
 competitive bidding; (4) less costly and re-
 strictive forest practices;                                                                                                                                 (5)  lower wage
 rates; (6) high tariff rates on lumber shipped
 to Canada;  (7) low charter rates for coast-
 wise and intereoastal shipping;                                                                                                                               (8)  a co-
 operative Government; and
 Whereas unemployment in the lumber in-
 dustry of the United States is increasing with
 resultant loss of wages to the workers, loss
 of taxes and Income to taxing bodies and
 communities: Now, therefore, be It
 Resolved, That the Congress and President
 of the United States of America, be respect-
 fully petitioned to give immediate attention
 to and request action necessary to place the
 lumber industry of the United States on an
 equitable and competitive basis with foreign
 manufacturers through the use of a quota
 system or other means, including the re-
 quirements that imported lumber be marked
 to show the country of origin, to the end
 that domestic manufacturers are not placed
 at  a  disadvantage  with  resultant  loss  of
 markets, reduction of employment, loss of
 taxes and deterioration of communities; and
 be it further
 Resolved, That this resolution be sent to
 the President   and  Vice  President  of   the
 United States, the Speaker of the House of
 .Representatives of the Congress, and to the
 Senators and  Representatives representing
 this State in the Congress of the United
 States.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. EVINS.  Mr. Speaker, the Con-
 gress is often criticized and regrettably
 is rarely commended.  Congress, as an
 institution, is often made the national
 whipping boy and all too infrequently
 commended.
 It is refreshing, therefore, to read a
 ,recent  article by Columnist Jenkins
 Lloyd Jones, which appeared in the
 Washington Evening Star commending
 Congress, I believe this article is worthy
 of wider reading, and I ask unanimous
 consent that this article be reprinted in
 the. Appendix of. the RECORD. The article
 follows;
 CONGRESS    ADMraED   FOR   BEHAVIOR-
 AB-SENCE. OF                       TVag,ULENCE  ON  FLOOR  CRED-
 ITED, WITH, HELP;NG... S.UCCESS
 It was one of those awful days in the U.S.
 Senate when a handful of senators were just
 standing around   beating   their  gums to
 empty desks and the puzzled galleries.
 The upper House was in a state of paraly-
 Bis because . the _ liberals had introduced a
 move to kill filibusters by a three-fifths vote
 instead of the traditional two-thirds vote,
 and with.the.rules up in the air the Senate
 Couldn't   organize   and   the       committees
 couldn't be appointed and so, a month after
 the beginning of th' session, nothing was
 going on.
 Vice President JOHNSON was up on the
 high  chair.   A      couple  of  freshmen,  TED
 KENNmrr  of    the  well-known       family  and
 HOWARD   EDmONDsox,   of          Oklahoma,  sat
 around still, presumably, entranced by the
 newness of it all.    Senator ROBERTSON of Vir-
 ginia was conducting a filibuster on the
 filibuster,, and every once in a while he
 would refer  to       the  Senate's   being like
 Caesar's wife and again to its being in Abra-
 ham's bosom.
 Occasionally, Senator RUSSELL, of Georgia,
 would ask permission to make a brief com-
 ment that wasn't brief and once Senator
 LAUSCHE of Ohio asked to interrupt so that
 he might call attention to the wonderful
 Ukranians who were being ground down be-
 neath the Kremlin's heel, whereupon Sen-
 ator SCOTT of Pennsylvania, mindful of his
 own Ukranians in Pittsburgh, fell all over
 himself seconding Senator LAUscHE's senti-
 ments.
 I was killing an hour in the practically
 empty Press .Gallery and I kept my eye on
 a couple of young men across the way in
 the visitors' seats.  One had a beard and
 they were enjoying themselves hugely and
 about to die with suppressed merriment at
 the grotesque performance on the floor.
 You could just hear them at their next cock-
 tail party laughing Congress to death.
 But here's one uncynical newspaperman.
 Strangely, I come away from either House-
 the  Israel  Knesset.  Not  since  Preston
 Brooks  of  South Carolina nearly brained
 Charles Sumner of Massachusetts 111 years
 ago has the Senate floor seen a serious fight.
 The Congress shows its sophistication by
 .doing practically all its significant work in
 zcommittee, or at least away from the floor.
 The  floor  is  largely  window  dressing-
 speeches to the Gallery and remarks for the
 record-and, of course, formal voting. Votes
 may be changed by quiet persuasion or adroit
 pressure in the corridors, but rarely by fre-
 netic debate in full assembly.
 In the new republics all eyes are on the
 rough-and-tumble Congresses.  There is the
 place of passion and oratory and recrimina-
 tion and contention.  And here are spawned
 the dictators.
 For popular government can't survive dis-
 order and chaos.  The confusion of mob gov-
 ernment in the Agora in Athens brought
 forth Pericles.  The corruption in the Ro-
 man Senate made Caesar inevitable.  The ir-
 responsibility of the French deputies finally
 drove the nation into the arms of General de
 Gaulle.
 A republic is a fragile thing.  The price
 of its survival is a reasonable efficiency.  Yet
 popular government is inherently inefficient.
 It.. is full of lost motion, confusion and in-
 decision.  It moves forward under the weak
 force of persuasion instead of the strong
 force of personal power.
 The U.S, Congress has been a success.
 Over 180 years, in spite of a host of mounte-
 banks and incompetents and a few genuine
 rascals, it has listened more often than not
 to the voice of reason.  It has, surprisingly
 perhaps, usually recognized real leadership
 and devoted patriotism.  Its Members-most
 of them-work desperately hard.
 It  may,  of  course,    decay.  Perhaps  its
 golden age has already passed.   Congress is
 a reflection of the people and the greed of
 the people has-this year brought financial
 irresponsibility to a new high.  If we ever
 have a crashing dollar and a national paraly-
 sis we may well lose the right to elect our
 representatives,
 But, even if, that happens, history will
 remember  the  U.S.  Congress.   For  it's
 time  it  reached a  high  point in    the
 delicate art of deliberation. Reportedly, it
 showed generosity in triumph and strength
 in crisis. It had tradition and pride.  It
 molded a lot of good vessels, some out of
 pretty ordinary clay.
 I never leave the Gallery, even after listen-
 ing to sonorous rhetoric rolling over empty
 seats, without marveling that the whole
 thing could have lasted so long and per-
 formed so well.

 Mr. JENSEN.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to
 Join my colleagues in all the words they
 have uttered in praise of our able Par-

 Blockade
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. BRUCE ALGER
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 - Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. ALGER.                                                                               Mr. Speaker, the edi-
 torial by David Lawrence in the U.S.
 News & World Report issue of March
 18, 1963, entitled "Blockade," points out
 the truth that many American citizens
 know even if the President and his mili-
 tary and State Department advisers do
 not know.
 Cuba is a threat militarily, politically,
 and in every other way to us and the
 nations of this hemisphere. The longer
 we postpone taking the necessary action,
 first to neutralize the danger and then
 to remove the danger and the threat,
 the more difficult will the task become.
 There is no point further in quibbling
 over kinds of blockades although the pa-
 cific blockade mentioned by Mr. Law-
 rence is pertinent.  The. main thing is
 to prevent further military buildup while
 we determine militarily what action is
 necessary to reimpose the Monroe Doc-
 trine in this hemisphere, which means
 freeing Cuba of communism of any form,
 Castro, or Khrushchev.
 The editorial follows:
 BLOCKADE
 (By David Lawrence)
 President Kennedy told his news confer-
 ence on March 6 that the primary source of
 the shipments into Cuba today are bloc ships,
 This, of course, means that, under orders
 from Moscow, the Communist-bloc countries
 of Eastern Europe are sending to Castro not
 only military equipment but oil and other
 goods essential to Cuba's economic survival.
 The American people, on the other hand,
 are furnishing what is popularly known as
 foreign aid to the governments of several
 countries whose ships are carrying oil and
 other supplies to Cuba.
 How long will it be  before the United
 States puts into effect and enforces a block-
 ade against this traffic?
 President Kennedy admits that an em-
 bargo on oil to Cuba could be effective.  He
 says:
 "There isn't any doubt that over a long
 period of time that denial of oil would make
 a difference.. To deny the oil would require,

 Tice key to the washing ability of the new
 products is the hydroxyl group, according to
 Dr. Herbert Simonis, technical manager of
 Simmer's purification process methods a81lf-
 ate and coinventor of the detergents with
 Dr. Mohammed Ismail, also of Zimmer,  The
 sugar eater of stearic acid, for example, has
 practically no washing activity, he points out,
 However, at least one hydroxyl group on the
 fatty acid chain raises washing ability to
 competitive levels.  Optimum washing prop-
 erties seem to lie between monohydroxy- and
 dihydroxystearic acids.
 The four sugar esters have similar proper-
 ties.  Special raw material or market condi-
 tions would determine which would be pro-
 duced, Dr. Simonis says.  The sugar ester :f
 rtcinoleic acid is cheapest to make.  But
 superioritlea of other members of the group
 in certain specific properties might make
 them more suitable for higher value wash-
 ing products.
 In cost, the new products don't score quite
 so high.  Zimmer figures production cost at
 about 23 cents per pound of sugar ester,
 This is about twice that of Tpbs.  But the
 amount of detergent in commercial consumer
 washing products is only about 2 percent
 according to Dr. Simonds.  The balance is
 filler and various additives. In industrial
 detergent products, the detergent fraction
 might rise to 10 to 20 percent, he says.  So,
 on a final product basis, Dr. Simonis esti-
 mates that Zinuner's sugar esters will only
 be 10 to 16 percent higher in cost than
 Tpbs.
 Will  license: Zimmer,  which  is  not      a
 chemical producer, 1s aiming at licensing the
 process that It has developed for making
 the detergents.  It is currently negotiating
 with several companies, including one U.S.
 firm.
 The firm isn't ready to talk process details
 publicly yet.  However, it has roughed out
 the general scheme, which involves a two-
 step reesteriflcation of sugar and fatty acids
 from natural oils.  First, fatty acids from raw
 castor oil or other natural oils are reacted
 with a low-boiling alcohol such as methanol
 or ethanol.  Then the resulting ester is re-
 acted with sugar to give the sugar ester.  Ac-
 tually,  a                                                                                                                                 mixture    of  about 75-percent
 enonoester and 26-percent diester results, but
 it can be used as such and needn't be puri-
 fied. The process is rather simple, Dr. Si-
 monia says, doesn't require special equip-
 ment, and in many cases can probably be
 run in existing plant equipment.  Further
 unpurified raw materials can be used.
 Zimmer has tested a number of natural
 sugars, finds that cheap cane sugar (sucrose)
 is best.  Others can be used, but they cost
 more and have no special advantage, Dr.
 Simonis   says.  Various _natural  oils  that
 give fatty acids having at least one hydroxyl
 group, or that can be hydroxylated by hydro-
 gen peroxide or peracetic acid, can be used.
 After  finding that  the  sugar  ester of
 rtcinoleic acid (from.castor oil) is degrada-
 ble and has good detergent qualities, the
 firm's research group prepared the sugar
 esters of mono-, di-, and tri-hyd oxystearic
 acid for comparison.                      These turned out to
 be comparable to the rtcinoleic acid sugar
 ester, but need more processing, are more
 costly.
 Tests made: So far, Zimmer hasn't tested
 its dete gents in large-scale sewage treat-
 ment plants. However, it has had testa made
 by two independent university authorities.
 Dr. H.  Schlegel, director of the Institute
 for Microbiology of the University of Goet-
 tingen, has tested them for microbto'ogical
 properties, found  them no toxic and de-
 gradable  by  bacteria  normally found  In

 Dr. Herbert Koelbel, rector of the Tech-

 The Washington newspaper must expect
 Its readers to be naive to swallow the defense
 it presents for the failure to give Republicans
 enough staff members to bring about some
 semblance of adequate personnel for their
 committee work.
 The Republicans ask 40 percent of the 500

 proportion based upon Republican repre-

 And the idea that professional staff mem-

 is too foolish for argument.

 We Cannot Abann Cuba,
 E$ TENSION OF REMAF&,Q
 01
 HON. BOB WILSON
 IN THE SOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr, BOB WILSON. Mr, Speaker,
 from the white House "command post"
 a concerted barrage of propaganda is
 being aimed at anyone-Republican or
 Democrat--who deigns to criticize the
 Kennedy record of inaction with regard
 to Cuba.
 As one who has been subjected to such
 criticism, I find consolation in noting the
 criticism of the administration's myopic
 at#itude toward the Monroe Doctrine by
 none other than former President Harry
 S. Truman. As a historian and rugged
 individualist, Mr. Truman recognizes the
 peril of the present situation.  I com-
 mend him,for his strong call for action.
 f .  I ask unanimous consent to include as
 a portion of my remarks the article en-
 titled  "We Cannot Abandon Cuba,"
 which appeared in the New York Stand-
 ard on Sunday, February 24, 1963.
 The article follows:
 } [From the New York Standard, Feb. 24,

 Ws CANNOT AB,Nnon Cues
 (By Harry S. Truman)
 Along with everyone else, I have been con-
 cerned but the situation in Cuba,  The
 Cuban people have been beset with Internal
 problems almost from the time Cuba was
 discovered by Columbus.  One set of tyrants
 seems to be succeeded by another in guise
 of liberators.
 There Is, now much talk about Cuba.
 There 'are those who read and talk about It?
 and there are those who tell those in charge
 what to do and how to do it. That is all
 right, as far as it goes, but it does no good
 and could do much harm, if we get into a
 political hassle about it.  Foreign policy
 should never be an Issue between the great
 tt political parties.
 is there no hope for Cuba?  Is Cuba now
 doomed to become theBaikansateliite of tie
 American continent? These And many other
 questions are being raised.
 The one thing that history teaches us over
 and over again is that no system of govern-
 meat that defies the will of its people can
 long endure and, while modern weapons in
 the hands of a new crop of quislings make
 the tank of liberation more formidable, it is
 as true today as it ever was that the will of a
 people to be free is irresistible.  Any gov-
 ernment that Imposes its will from the
 top will be overthrown in time.     When the
 people reach that certain point of loss of pa-
 tience and the congealment of their will to
 resist they strike back with the savage fury
 of  bloody  revolution, resulting   in  more
 cruelties In the name of the revolution.
 We have always been sympathetic toward
 the Cuban people but for one reason or an-
 other, things never seemed to work out so
 that the affairs of Cuba could be admin-
 istered by honest and devoted patriots, rather
 than the greedy, selfish, grafting dictators
 that kept succeeding one another.
 The present situation In Cuba defies all
 reasoning.  Castro as a revolutionary leader
 fighting to unseat Dictator Batista attracted
 sympathetic support from many quarters in
 this hemisphere, and from the United States
 in  particular.   There was some reason to
 hope that here at long last there may have
 arisen a true patriot and able leader, who
 would devote his energies to the establish-
 ment of representative government, and put
 through necessary reforms for the benefit of
 all the Cuban people.
 But, again, our hopes were doomed to dis-
 appointment:  The man, Castro, became in-
 Sated and power mad-and Incapable of the
 kind of leadership Cuba needed in her pe-
 riod of reconstruction.
 Instead of applying his energies to the so-
 lution of the needs of Cuba. Castro betrayed
 his revolution by delivering the Cuban peo-
 ple                                                                 to  the  political' Imprisonment  of  a
 Russian-made Communist dictatorship. He
 thus committed Cuba to a life of crisis, of
 aggression, oppression, and Intrigue.
 We admit that our policies toward Cuba,
 and I would Include my own administration
 as well, have left something to be desired.
 For some reason we have put off for too
 long our responsibility to put pressure on
 the Cuban leaders to Institute badly_needed
 reforms.
 There is one thing we cannot do and must
 not do and that Is to abandon Cuba to her
 self-imposed tyrants and new conquerors.
 For as long as these people enforce their will
 by the use of modern weapons, the Cuban
 people will be compelled to undergo pro-
 longed suffering, before they can hope to
 restore themselves by the process of spon-
 taneous popular uprising.
 The Cuban situation is in a different cate-
 gory and should not be confused with the
 other satellite victims within the-Russian-
 Chinese orbit.  Cuba was delivered to Com-
 munist control and domination by a betrayal
 of a modern-day Quisling, Castro.  fie per-
 petrated this act of treason against the
 Cuban people and even those of his revolu-
 tionary followers, in the name of liberation
 from colonialism.
 I think that it is well that we take a look
 at the record of our past relations with
 Cuba.  From early 1899 to mid 1902, while
 Cuba   was  under  temporary  V.S.  mill-
 tary rule. following her                                                                     liberation  from
 Spain, most of the omces were placed under
 Cuban nationals.  During that period much
 was done to build public works; strict meas-
 ures of sanitation were put into effect; the
 civil service was reformed; and public edu-
 cation significantly Improved.  Yellow fever,
 which had been plaguing Cuba for centuries,
 was eradicated.
 At the same time a constitutional con-
 vsntion was called to establish a system for
 self-government.  The first Cuban Conti-
 nental Congress met on May 6, 1902, and we
 turned over control of the (loverninent to
 the people of Cuba,
 March 11
 In restoring Cuba to self-government the
 so-called Platt amendment was accepted by
 Cuba on June 12, 1901, as a part of its
 Constitution.
 Among the several provisions of the Platt
 amendment were these:
 The sanitation measures set up by the
 military, were to be maintained;
 "Naval stations authorized to be leased to
 the United States; and
 "The United States reserved the right to
 interfere in the affairs of the island if it be-
 came necessary."
 It seems to me, that when it appeared that
 the situation In Cuba was getting out of
 hand, and that a threat to the security of
 this hemisphere was clearly in the making,
 that we should have considered that the
 basic implications of the Monroe Doctrine
 were at stake, as well as the reservation im-
 posed by the Platt amendment, which an-
 ticipated precisely such a development.
 These provisions, the Monroe Doctrine,
 and the Platt amendment, were there as
 much for the welfare and protection of
 Cuba, as for the security of all the other
 nations of this continent.
 The situation is clear, the problem is ob-
 vious, the solution not so apparent.  But,
 like the bubonic plague or cholera, quaran-
 tining is one remedy that every public health
 authority knows must be imposed until a
 virulent epidemic abates.
 A former President, much as he might
 try, cannot detach himself from events, even
 long after he is out of office,  On one of my
 walks,  a speculative thought kept going
 through my mind on how I might have dealt
 with Castro if it had been mine to do.  This
 is how  I saw it:       Immediately after the
 conclusion of the revolution In Cuba, I
 would have invited Castro to the White
 House.  This Is the way I might have put
 it to him:
 "Mr. Castro, your revolution is over and
 now you have the responsibility and the
 big job of reconstruction.  You have made
 a great many promises to your people in
 enlisting their support.  How are you going
 to make good in those promises?  You don't
 have the resources of your own in Cuba, and
 there are no means in sight to enable you
 to perform the things you promised the
 Cuban people.
 "Now, there are only two places where
 you might get the necessary economic sup-
 port to put over your program of reforms.
 We are close to Cuba and we have historic
 ties with your country. All we would expect
 In return for our support would be that you
 keep the Cuban Institutions free, and the
 Cuban people free, and that you get rid of
 corruption.  This is all we would ask, this
 is all we would expect, and Cuba would en-
 joy complete sovereignty and independence
 as a nation. But if you should elect to go
 the other way-the Communist way-you
 will become a puppet and that can only lead
 you to more trouble and bloodshed."
 I would have hoped that after some such
 exchange we should have come to an under-
 standing and I think we might have reached
 a friendly agreement.  All this, of course,
 needed  to have  been  quietly negotiated
 within the privacy of the White House.  With
 that out of the way I might have closed
 our meeting with a friendly suggestion, per-
 haps something like this:
 "Now    that  we understand  each       other,
 Fidel, let us get to work and do all we can
 for the cause of your people."
 The Cuban crisis has served one useful
 purpose-it again smoked out the Russian
 capacity for bluff and their "hit and run"
 type of international piracy.  And it pro-
 vided the United States with an opportunity
 to make it clear to the Communist aggres-.
 sore that once the line is drawn we stand
 firm,

 HON. STEVEN B. DEROUNIAN
 Or NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11. 1963
 Mr. DEROUNIAN.  Mr. Speaker, a
 most disturbing revelation has been made
 by Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott in yes-
 terday's Long Island Press.  It concerns
 Soviet bombers flying over several of our
 aircraft carriers.
 I wonder if President Kennedy will also
 consider these bombers as defensive?

 What the  at-times-circuitous Pentagon
 boss didn't reveal is even more $      ircant

 For security reasons most of these chilling
 untold facts cannot be divulged as yet.  They
 are  still  tightly  classified-although,  of
 course, no secret to the Russians; only to
 Americans.
 But it is possible to publish the following
 extremely important information that Mctia-
 mars withheld:
 In each of these ominous carrier over-
 flights the Soviet reconnaissance-bombers
 flew direct to their midocean "targets" by
 the shortest circular routes from bases in
 Russia.  The giant Red planes (known in
 the West as Bears) did not search for the
 carriers. They set courses straight for them
 and flew over them.
 Such extraordinary bull's-eye flying, as
 it Is being termed by members of the joint
 Chiefs of Staff, is possible only in two ways,
 as follows.
 'Possession by the Russians of a secret
 space (satellite) or other high level recon-
 nai$saace system that enables the detection
 and tracking of ships.
 Advance.Soviet knowledge of the exact lo-
 cation and Courses of the lour carriers-the
 $nterprfse,  Forrestal,  Kitty  Hawk,  and
 Princeton.
 Military    authorities are convinced the
 former Is the case.
 These highly revealing incidents confirm
 for them a growing belief they have had for
 some time that the Russians have in orbit
 one or more reconnaissance satellites with
 the same. capabilities as our very secret
 Samos and Ferret.  -
 =ese U.S. satellites take photographs and
 monitor communications. The Air Force has
 at least six Samoses in orbit from 160 to 500
 miles above the earth. These satellites snap
 pictures of Russian areas and installations
 and transmit them to ground receiving sta-
 tions.  The Ferret, in , addition to being
 equipped with a camera similar to those in
 the Samos, has a complex electronic system
 for monitoring communications,
 Both the Samos and Ferret can take pho-
 tos at heights of several hundred miles from
 which individuals on the ground can be
 Identified.
 Strikingly Indicative of the high degree of
 effectiveness of the Reds' detection  and
 tracking system are the following grim de-
 falls about- which Secretary McNamara was
 characteristically vague:
 The Navy reported that the Bear recon-
 nalasance-bomber that new aver the 75.000-
 ton Forrestal southeast of the Azores on Feb-
 ruary 22 was tracked some 2,100 miles from
 a base in northeastern Russia.  From the
 very start the Soviet plane made a beeline
 for the carrier and flew directly to it by the
 shortest circular route.
 Throughout, the intruding Bear was under
 surveillance, either by radar, radio, or by
 plane.  Two Ferret satellites were tuned In
 on the Russians.  What was learned Is classi-
 fied.
 For two brief periods radar lost its "Ioc"
 on the Soviet plane.  This was done to the
 Reds' using a new type of metal chaff that
 temporarily blotted out radar contact.  But
 surveillance was maintained through other
 methods, and interceptors of the Forrestal
 were In the air long before the Bear hove
 into sight.
 However, intelligence experts point out
 that Is not as important as it may appear
 to be.
 They cite thefact that the Bear has the
 capability of being armed with a known
 Soviet air-to-ground missile that can be
 launched some 850 miles from a carrier-
 definitely out of the range of U.S. carrier-
 based Interceptors.
 One Navy report on the incidents-also not
 mentioned by McNamara--stated that a Bear
 that overflew a carrier was equipped with
 racks that could have carried nuclear bombs
 of more than 20 megatons.  Photos were
 taken of this Communist plane showing
 these bomb racks.
 An Intelligence report stressed the point
 that, in direct contrast to these bullseye
 overflights. It took the Navy 4 days to locate
 that hijacked Venezuelan freighter.
 Senator BARRY GOLDWArER, Republican, of
 Arizona, had much to do with forcing dis-
 closure  of  then` sinister  overflights.  He
 questioned McNamara about the Kitty Hawk
 incident during the latter's closed-door ap-
 pearance before the Senate Armed Services
 Committee. Obviously startled and discon-
 certed, McNamara admitted the accuracy of
 Ooldwater's Information.
 Later, after conferring with the President,
 the defense chief hurriedly summoned a
 press conference and announced the over-
 flights..
 An Example of Individual Responsibility

 HON. ROBERT DOLE

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. Speaker, throughout
 our great country silent benefactors play
 vital roles In countless small communi-
 ties such as my hometown of Russell,
 Kans.
 Russell, and in fact all of Russell
 County, Kans., lost a true friend In the
 death of W. H. "Bill" Sellens on Febru-
 ary 10, 1963.  Blessed with a degree of
 material wealth Mr. Sellens firmly be-
 lieved in community betterment and
 practiced this belief  In Individual re-
 sponsibility for many, many years.
 There are countless examples bearing
 the stamp of his generosity in our com-
 munity but perhaps his greatest pride
 March 11
 was In doing his bit to insure first class
 medical treatment for the patients and
 first class facilities for the staff of Rus-
 sell City Hospital.  I share with you a
 letter written by Dr. M. E. Schulz, Mr.
 Sellens' physician for many years, to the
 Russell Daily News:
 YOUR HOSPITAL AND Bn.L Smums
 In January 1963. your hospital was 20
 years old.  For the past 12 years, Mr. Bill
 Bellens  has been the greatest benefactor
 of this community Institution for healing
 the sick.  Through his generosity, your hos-
 pital has been made a better place in which
 to care for the sick, and has been kept mod-
 ern In every respect.
 Each and every one of us should be par-
 ticularly grateful for this man.   Be  was
 truly a pioneer of Russell County and ex-
 pressed many times that the good Lord was
 kind to him, and he wished to return this
 kindness to his home community. This is
 something that many of us should think
 about, for It is our home community which
 to  Important, for It is where we live and
 where we die.  Mr. Sellens was a God-fearing
 man, who in the early days quarried our
 famous stone posts, at the price of 10 cents
 apiece.   He was a very humble man and
 truly left his community in a better condi-
 tion than when he found It.  He had many
 friends.  He was a towering man, well above
 8 feet in height, and distinguished in his
 actions.  He gave to the youth in many
 ways, as be was always Interested in our
 children. This kind of citizen is a citizen
 worth writing about.  He believed in self-
 determination and individual responsibili-
 ties.                                                                                                                    He not only spoke of Individual initi-
 ative, but he practiced It.
 Here are some of the things that your
 hospital would not be blessed with had it
 not been for gifts over the past 12 years from
 Bill Sellens:  the professional staff library,
 many room furnishings, solarium furnish-
 ings, laboratory equipment, two different
 sets of new X-ray equipment, air condition-
 ing, the doctors' call system, and many other
 things.
 It has been said that there is always a
 woman  behind every man's actions.   The
 above comments could not have been said
 were It not for the very able Mrs. Amelia
 Sellens, wife of Mr. Bill Sellens, and It is
 triteto say that these things could have been
 done only with her full cooperation.

 1963                    CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 How have we responded to your appeals?
 Let me answer the question this way.     The
 Chinese Communists persecuted and im-
 prisoned- Bishop Cuthbert O'Gara.             When
 they finally expelled him from China, he
 hoped to arouse American Catholics to the
 sufferings  of  their brother  Catholics  in
 China.     How did we answer his appeal?  By
 and large _ we ignored him.  Bishop O'Gara
 said it was easier to bear Communist perse-
 cution than the indifference of American
 Catholics.  We have done very little to help
 our brother Catholics who suffer Communist
 persecution. . We forget that  it is Christ
 himself whom they persecute.. What will we
 Latin Catholics say to Jesus Christ our Judge
 when He asks us at,the judgment, "I was
 persecuted, and what did you do to help
 Me?"
 We cannot.rely on the V.S. Government
 to do this job for us.  The U.S. Government
 plainly showed its attitude toward those suf-
 fering Communist persecution when the U.S.
 Embassy in Moscow shut its door in the face
 of those Russian.. Baptists who asked for
 asylum in the name of Jesus Christ.  Fur-
 ther, the U.S, Government has completely
 abandoned., any idea of supporting a libera-
 tion movement against the Communists.
 Not only that, but the United States has
 abandoned the Monroe Doctrine and has
 consented to the maintenance of a Commu-
 nist slave State. in Cuba, 90 miles off our
 shores.  Furthermore, the United States has
 adopted %,policy of peaceful coexistence with
 the Communist., empire.  And now the U.S.
 Government. is disarming in the face of the
 Communistene;ny; witness the abandon-
 ment of planning  and production of ad-
 vanced,nuclear.hombers, the RS-70 program;
 Witness the abandonment of the Skybolt nu-
 clear bomber missile; the abandonment of
 nuclear missile bases around Russia; and
 the recall of our nuclear bombers from bases
 around Russia.. Our Government is not only
 willing to settle for things the way they are
 now, but Is disarming to prevent even any
 threat to. jhe Communists.  We cannot count
 on the U.S, Government to help those suffer-
 Ing Communist persecution.  The U.S. Gov-
 ern}uent does not want to embarrass the
 -Communists.
 .but. what can we do?       We can do a great
 deal..,We can pray.  Does that sound like
 a ,truism?, About 1 year ago the Ukrainian
 batholic bishops here in the United States
 called: a press conference to spotlight the
 sufferings of Archbishop Siipy in his Com-
 munist prison.  Here in Omaha, our beloved
 archbishop, the Most Reverend Gerald T.
 ]3ergan, called upon us to pray for those
 suffering Communist persecution.  I am sure
 many American bishops did likewise.  Today
 on this, his 71st birthday, Archbishop Siipy
 is a free man.. If it is a holy and wholesome
 thing to pray for the dead, how much more
 holy and wholesome It must be to pray for
 those suffering persecution for Christ. Those
 who suffer persecution have  first call on
 the charity of our prayers.
 Secondly, we can and should constantly
 remind our fellow' Americans and our Gov-
 ernment of the persecution which our broth-
 era  are. suffering  from  the               Communists.
 There is hardly an issue of the CONGRESSIONAL
 REcoRnwhich does not carry articles about
 the persecution of the Jews in Russia.  The
 Communists do not, generally kill Jews-they
 pressure them.  They close some of their
 synagogues; they restrict the publication of
 Jewish religious books; they obstruct the
 training of rabbis; they give the Jews ad-
 verse publicity;                  they make it difficult for
 Jews. to get a professional education.  My
 friends, you and I know that the Communists
 have treated the Jews mildly in comparison
 to their treatment of Ukrainian Catholics.
 The Communists have made a determined
 effort to suppress catholicism completely
 among Ukrainians.
 . Our Jewish friends are telling their story.
 We Latin Catholics are not telling the story
 of  our  persecuted  brothers.  You  would
 think the silent church is on this side of the
 Atlantic.  We can and should make the
 sufferings of our fellow Catholics known.
 We Latin Catholics must cooperate with you
 Byzantine Catholics to tell the world of Com-
 munist persecution.  Then maybe our Gov-
 ernment will exert itself  to alleviate the
 sufferings of our brothers in Christ.
 Archbishop Slipy symbolizes the fidelity
 of the Ukrainian people to Christ In the face
 of Communist persecution, That is the rea-
 son we honor him.  We can honor him best
 by loving Our Lord Jesus Christ as Arch-
 bishop Slipy has loved him.  We can love
 Our Lord by working and praying for our
 brother Catholics who are suffering Com-
 munist persecution.   That is the message of
 the archbishop's release.  The warning is
 that if we fail to love Our Lord as we should
 we may soon suffer persecutions ourselves.
 Just as God has released Archbishop Siipy
 from a Communist concentration camp, so
 one day God *111 free the Ukrainian people
 and all other people from Communist slavery.
 Let us praise and thank God for His goodness,
 and pray and work together for that glorious
 day.
 Thank you.
 Housing Utopia Is Fine, but Where's
 the Cash?
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. WILLARD S. CURTIN
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. CURTIN.           Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to extend my remarks in the
 RECORD, I desire to include an editorial
 which appeared on March 6 in the Daily
 Intelligencer, a newspaper published in
 Doylestown, Bucks County, Pa. The said
 editorial goes right to the heart of one
 of the problems which is presently con-
 fronting us:
 HOUSING UTOPIA Is FINE, BUT WHERE'S
 THE CASH?.
 We need the stout advocates of principle
 at both ends of the political spectrum.  They
 sharpen public debate on the great issues
 and serve as a useful check on too pre-
 cipitate Government action.
 But it does not follow from this that those
 who stand for .principle are of necessity
 braver and more useful than those who
 occupy the compromising political center.
 The National Housing Conference, a 32-
 year-old organization devoted to eliminat-
 ing slums and blight, perhaps illustrated
 in its newest Washington meeting how easy
 It is to talk on the aide of the angels.
 The NHC notes some largely unassailable
 facts:
 Our total annual output of new housing
 is insufficient to meet the needs of a grow-
 ing population,  especially  those in lower-
 and middle-income groups. We are not get-
 ting  enough  urban  renewal  and  we  are,
 getting too much urban and  suburban
 sprawl.
 To get more and better housing, to arrest
 deterioration, wipe  out slums  and check
 sprawl, the NHC proposes that the Federal
 Government quickly approve vast new sums.
 Toting up the rough amounts involved in
 its proposals for expanded urban renewal,
 low-rent housing, housing for the elderly,
 A1289
 improved rural and farm housing, we attain
 a figure upward of $4 billion. A portion
 would be in loans.
 A nonspecialist in housing problems is
 hardly equipped to question the wisdom of
 NHC's figures as an ideal proposition.
 What the outsider can question, however,
 is how NHC President Nathaniel Keith and
 NHC's resolutions committee can discusss
 these proposals for 21 pages as if not one
 single other claim on the Federal budget
 existed.
 It is recognized that better housing is just
 part of a broad attack on poverty.  But no-
 where are housing's demands on the budget
 put in a scale of priorities with such other
 needs as job retraining, improved general
 education, health, welfare, highways,
 Nothing is said of the fact that we must
 spend some $55 billion for defense and other
 sums to aid our friends abroad.
 Indeed, NHC says plainly that its proposed
 bigger housing effort has a "first claim on
 the  resources  of  our  economy."  Many
 Americans had thought that defense re-
 quirements enjoy that preeminence.
 NHC's goals are fine. But in stating them
 flat out in a kind of political and economic
 vacuum, the group has done just the easiest
 part of the job.
 Left to the political engineers who must
 deal in realities is the task of scaling such
 propositions to make them fit somewhere in
 today's baffling array of competing demands.
 Truth, Toughness Needed (n Cuba
 HON. JOHN M. ASHBROOK
 OF OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. ASHBROOK.  Mr.  Speaker,  I
 wish to call to the attention of the House
 an excellent editorial which appeared in
 the Ashland Times-Gazette, Ashland,
 Ohio, written by Robert Beer, publisher
 of this independent daily newspaper. It
 focuses attention on the growing grass-
 roots sentiment regarding bungling pol-
 icy in the Cuban situation.
 I commend this fine editorial to all
 of the Members of the House:
 TRUTH, TOUGHNESS NEEAEO IN CUBA
 When  the  arms  buildup  began in  the
 Florida Keys several months ago this writer
 pledged to silence his criticism of President
 Kennedy and to support him in his apparent
 determination to avert another blunder such
 as our chickenlivered failure to'back up the
 Bay of Pigs attack.  The chance of hot war
 then became a calculated risk and, at last,
 our country was to assert its responsibility
 to its own people and to the other free na-
 tions of the hemisphere.
 So it seemed.
 Fear of the possible consequences of such
 a firm stand was smothered by a renewed
 pride and confidence in ourselves and our
 President.. The showdown was at hand-
 the brave and noble move had been made-
 someone would be obliged to either fight
 or lose face before a world audience. Unity
 among  the  Americas  was  at  an historic
 peak-more   fierce and abiding than ever.
 Now there would be a beginning of an end,
 an  end of  20  years on   a   powder  keg
 while one Republican and three Democratic
 Presidents watched communism creep its
 way like molten lava from the Kremlin to
 the very shores of the United States.  The
 end was In sight.

 Monday, March 4, 1963
 Mr. ASPINALL.  Mr. Speaker, people
 generally, and Members of Congress in
 particular, usually hear only the com-
 plaints and criticism that are made
 about Government agencies.  The Bu-
 reau of Land Management has been no
 exception to this general rule.
 As a welcome change, there has come
 to my attention a resolution adopted at
 the annual meeting of the Consolidated
 Wool  Growers of  Western Colorado,
 which was held at Hotchkiss, Colo. on
 February 13, 1963, expressing apprecia-
 tion to the Bureau of Land Management
 for Its "very good work in administra-
 tion of the sheep ranges in this district."
 In bringing this matter to the atten-
 tion of the House I would be remiss if I
 did not mention In passing the coopera-
 tive spirit that has been displayed by
 Mr. Lowell M. Puckett, State Director of
 the Bureau of Land Management. It is
 a pleasure to acknowledge the coopera-
 tion that Mr. Puckett has given to me
 and to the people of Colorado.
 I compliment the Consolidated Wool
 Growers for their constructive action In
 taking note of meritorious service and
 I include the text of the resolution with
 my remarks for the information of all
 Members:
 FinauAsr 13, 1963.
 At the annual meeting of the Consoli-

 following resolution was passed.
 This association wishes to express our ap-
 preciation to the Bureau of Land Manage-
 ment for their very good work in adminis-
 tration of the sheep ranges in this district.
 Their work In range Improvement Is notable.
 The development of stock water, In clean-
 ing of useless brush, In reseeding, in fenc-
 ing along borders of allotments, and for
 access roads add to practical management
 which show results In Improvement of the
 range.
 Sheep growers know and feel that it is
 time the public should know the land man-
 agement is doing all possible within the
 means they have to develops the potential
 of public ranges.  We feel that in the last

 few years. the cooperative agreements have
 resulted In Improved conditions.
 Water development, in  construction of
 water ponds has eliminated wasted trailing.
 The construction  of dams has prevented
 erosion.
 The fencing program of the last few years
 has increased better management and has
 eliminated damaging, duplication of use.
 We feel that intelligent training and prac-
 tical application, and cooperation of users
 are bringing good results.
 Therefore this association wishes to thank
 the land management and its officers and
 pledge further cooperation.

 Will  Clayton  Speaks  Out  Against
 Cotton Controls
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. BOB CASEY
 OF TEXAS
 Hf THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. CASEY. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Will L.
 Clayton is well known throughout the
 Nation for his distinguished service to
 this country as former Under Secretary
 of State for Economic Affairs and As-
 sistant Secretary of Commerce.  He is
 known throughout the world for his
 knowledge of the cotton business, as head
 of he great international firm of Ander-
 son & Clayton.
 I think It would be well for those who
 are endeavoring to manipulate the U.S.
 cotton Industry to heed the recommenda-
 tions contained in Mr. Clayton's brief
 remarks before the National Cotton
 Council in El Paso last January 28.
 So that others interested in U.S.
 cotton gaining Its rightful place in the
 world market may have an opportunity
 to read this distinguished statesman's
 recommendations, I have the privilege of
 inserting his remarks:
 RzsAAxs Or W. L. CLAYTON AT THE 25TH AN-
 NIIAL CONVENTION OF THE NATIONAL COTTON
 COUNCIL, EL PAso, TEx.. JAxvAaY 28. 1963
 We are all indebted to Dr. Horne and to
 Mr. McCord for their lucid exposition of the
 critical danger the United States faces of
 losing its raw cotton trade.
 I have studied the council pamphlet of
 September 1962, and I am in complete agree-
 ment with Dr. Horn's conclusions, except I
 go farther than he in fixing the responsi-
 bility for this situation and in the steps that
 must be taken to correct It.
 To develop the points I wish to make, I
 must take you back to an historic meeting I
 attended in Washington in June 1933, al-
 most 30 years ago.
 This meeting was called by the Secretary
 of Agriculture.
 There were a`aout 100 men present, all In-
 terested in some aspects of the cotton busi-
 ness.
 As I remember it, the telegram calling this
 meeting was rather vague as to Its purpose,
 but soon after the meeting opened, it was
 apparent that its purpose was to get the
 cotton trade to approve a decision already
 made for t'-e Clover-went to pay farmers to
 plow up every third row of the growing cot-
 ton crop.
 I spoke out against this with all the vigor
 that I could command.  I said if the Gov-

 Bargaining on Trial
 EXTENSION, OF REMARKS
 HON. RALPH HARVEY
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. HARVEY of Indiana, . Mr.-Speak-
 or, under leave to extend my remarks
 in the RECORD, I include the following
 editorial from the Wall Street Journal
 of March 6, 1963.
 BARGAINING ON TRIAL
 Labor Secretary Wirtz has let it be known
 that, in his view, collective bargaining is on
 trial.  Labor and management face their
 "last clear chance" to prove that they can
 work things  out by themselves.   If they
 don't, he strongly implies that the Govern-
 ment stands ready to take over.
 Looking around the Nation, it's not hard
 to find evidence that collective bargaining
 is indeed in trouble.. As Mr Grimes com-
 mented on this page the other day, tradi-
 tional  bargaining  procedures  lately  have
 proved of little help in the airline, railroad,
 aerospace, newspaper, and longshore indus-
 tries.
 How did bargaining get in such a bad way?
 Why is there increasing talk that "some-
 thing must be done" by Government?
 Ironically a large part of the answer is
 simply that Government has done so much
 already.  Washington proclaims proper wage
 as well as price behavior.  In purported de-
 fense of the public interest, Government
 officials roam the country intervening in
 labor disputes.  Their intervention comes
 ever earlier, sometimes even before real bar-
 gaining has had a chance to begin.  And its
 circle of interest grows ever wider, sweeping
 in even the Metropolitan Opera.
 The more the concept of public interest
 has been twisted and expanded, the more
 labor disputes become a matter of public
 shouting rather than private bargaining. In-
 creasingly, both sides see little reason for
 flexibility in their dealings with each other.
 Why should they try to work things out at
 the bargaining table?  The chances are the
 Government will settle it anyway.
 It's true that both sides can still resist
 Government pressure up to a point.  Thus

 their eagerness to preserve featherbedding.

 York printers' union, denounced by the Pres-
 ident, blandly replies that Mr. Kennedy was
 misinformed.
 After all, they have before them the in-
 terestinq precedent  of  the  longshoremen.
 When tile dockworkers resisted Federal pres-
 sure, the Government turned on the employ-
 ers and in effect forced them to accept a set-
 tlement. A settlement, in fact, that went be-
 yond the Government's own wage guide-
 lines.
 So it is hardly surprising that the Gov-
 ernment, as well as the would-be bargainers,
 feels a growing sense of frustration.  It has
 stepped in too far and yet the only answer
 it sees is to get in even deeper.  Unless, of
 course, those directly concerned with collec-
 tive bargaining should somehow overcome
 all the Government-imposed obstacles, pull
 themselves together and.regain mastery of
 their own affairs.
 The chances for any such development, in
 the current circumstances,  are dim.   For
 collective bargaining, even before the Gov-
 ernment stepped up its intervention, was
 being called on to accomplish too much.  A
 labor official quoted by Mr. Grimes put it
 this way:  "Collective bargaining was in-
 tended to handle specific problems between
 a specific company and a specific union."
 Where- those conditions still prevail, labor
 relations are often excellent.
 But  even  a cursory glance  at today's
 America will show how far bargaining gen-
 erally has departed from the original con-
 cept.                                                   With their explicit exemption from
 antimonopoly laws, labor unions over the
 years have steadily expanded the area of
 bargaining to a point where negotiators are
 called upon to set wages and working con-
 ditions for employees in a wide variety of
 plants in a variety of geographical areas,
 often located throughout the country.
 Is this request entirely reasonable?  The
 head of the Steelworkers Union admits to
 being out of touch with the real wishes of
 the rank and file, and other national union
 leaders cannot be much better informed.
 Yet, on their distant reading of the needs
 of their members, national unions now can
 and do close down not just a few plants
 but whole industries.
 In this situation, it is no solution to take
 the process of wage determination still an-
 other long step away from the workers-to
 entrust the problem to government.  That
 way lies the road to complete economic regi-
 mentation, a regimentation that could hard-
 ly be expected to stop with wages.                                                     Surely
 it would make more sense to head in the op-
 posite direction, to try to bring about local
 bargaining in local plants over local issues.
 If collective bargaining is indeed on trial,
 it is government that has largely put it
 there.  And government also must stand in
 the dock.

 HON. CLINTON P. ANDERSON
 matter is long overdue.  That is the
 central point of a statement by the AFL-
 CIO Executive Council published on
 February 26, 1963.
 I ask unanimous consent that this
 statement be printed in the Appendix of
 the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 STATEMENT   BY   THE   AFL-CIO   EXECUTIVE
 COUNCIL ON THE PRESIDENT'S SPECIAL MES-
 SAGE ON AIDING SENIOR CITIZENS, FEBRUARY
 26, 1963
 For the first time in our history the Presi-
 dent of the United States has sent to the
 Congress a special message on the problems
 of the aged and aging.  The President's pro-
 gram recognizes with fresh perspective and
 clear vision that old age need not be char-
 acterized by anguish, fear and insecurity,
 that the phrase "the golden years" can in-
 deed become a reality for millions of more
 Americans, and that the Federal Government
 has an important role in helping States,
 local communities, and individual families
 in bringing this about.
 Of course, the first and foremost priority
 is hospital insurance.  As the President so
 eloquently stated: "A proud and resourceful
 Nation can no longer ask its older people
 to live in constant fear of a serious illness
 for which adequate funds are not available.
 We owe them the right of dignity in sickness
 as well as in health.  We can achieve this
 by adding health insurance-primarily hos-
 pitalization                                                                                                                               insurance-to  our  successful
 social security system."
 The AFL-CIO has called for the enactment
 of health insurance for the aged through
 social security and railroad retirement for
 some years past.  Since our early support of
 such legislation we have witnessed an in-
 creasing recognition of the need for action,
 we have seen legislative proposals revised and
 modified and we have watched the support
 of thoughtful citizens and responsible orga-
 nizations strengthen and grow: In the devel-
 opment of the last. several years, these facts
 stand out:
 (1) The  aged   need  health      insurance:
 Health insurance has become the accepted
 way of paying hospital and other large health
 bills for the majority of Americans.     The
 increased medical needs that come with old
 age make payment of major health costs at
 the time of illness utterly impractical for
 those living on a retirement income.  Health
 insurance for the aged is imperative.
 (2) The type of insurance the aged need
 most Is  hospital  insurance:  The  greatest
 health expenses during old age are associated
 with hospitalization.  A program of benefits
 emphasizing  hospitalization   and   nursing
 home care is the most appropriate program
 for meeting the most urgent needs of the vast
 majority of the aged.
 (3) The only practical way to finance hos-
 pital insurance for the aged is based on the
 social security principle, with benefits: For
 those people who are not now covered by
 social  security  or  railroad  retirement  fi-
 nanced out of general revenues.  Our social

 gram.  Social insurance prevents poverty
 and preserves dignity.
 (4) Public welfare medical assistance is
 only acceptable as a second line of defense:
 While public assistance medical can can-
 not substitute for social insurance, it can
 function as a supplement to the basic hoe-
 pitalization program of social security, just
 as old-age assistance has supplemented the
 OASDI system for a quarter of a century.
 The President answered  well those who
 would rely solely on welfare medical pro-
 grams instead of social security financed in-
 surance when he so aptly pointed to the
 weakness of welfare medical assistance as
 helping people to get health care "only If
 they first accept poverty and then accept
 charity."
 (5) Private insurance can make a major
 contribution by supplementing the basic
 hospitalization plan. We can expect private
 insurance greatly to expand as it supple-
 ments basic hospitalization coverage through
 social security just as other private insur-
 ance grew after the passage of the original
 Social Security Act.
 (6) The time for action is now.  We call
 upon the Congress of the United States to
 enact a program of hospital Insurance for
 the aged through social security and rail-
 road retirement at this session.  Although
 irresponsible opposition has done all it can
 to confuse the American people about the
 Issues at stake, the vast majority of Ameri-
 cans young and old, can see through the
 sloganeering and were tactics, and will sup-
 port with enthusiasm the prompt enactment
 of the administration's-sound, practical pro-
 posal of hospital insurance for the aged.
 While the problem of providing hospital
 insurance for the aged supersedes all other
 matters that would improve the lot of the
 older members of our families, we cannot
 overlook the special needs of the aged In the
 areas of housing, income, employment taxes
 and special facilities and services.  We con-
 gratulate the administration on the scope
 of its program for our older citizens and urge
 the Congress to implement It with prompt
 action.
 Cuban Caves
 ION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. ELFORD A. CEDERBERG
 or MxcnIQAR
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. CEDERBERG.  Mr. Speaker, for
 some weeks now there have been con-
 flicting claims about a Soviet military
 buildup in Cuba.
 In an effort to shed light on this sub-
 ject, my distinguished colleague from
 New Hampshire [Mr. CLmLANDI made
 a statement on the House floor Febru-
 ary 28.  This statement largely con-
 sisted of material obtained from the
 Legislative Reference Service concern-
 ing the numbers and sizes of Cuban
 caves. The Information obtained was
 fragmentary and Incomplete.
 On March 8, 1963, the Chicago Tribune
 carried the following story on page 3:
 SCANT DATA AVAILABLE IN UNITED STATES oN
 CUBAN CAVES
 WASHINGTON, March 7.-Little public in-
 formation Is available about the thousands
 of underground caverns in Cuba. some of
 them of vast size, where Russian troops are
 reported to be storing large amounts of mili-
 tary equipment and supplies.
 It is known, however, that some are a
 half-mile long, with arching roofs as high as
 a skyscraper, the ground dry, and the tem-
 perature even, capable of storing the biggest
 missiles and jet bombers, as well as tanks
 and artillery of leaser size.
 Representative JAMES C.  CLEVELAND,  Re-
 publican, of New Hampshire, has placed in
 the CONGRESSIONAL RxcoaD a report on the
 Cuban eaves which he solicited from the Li-
 brary of Congress.  The report cited some
 published references to the caves it found in
 library flies but it conceded that informa-
 tion was scarce.
 NO SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE
 The US. Geological Survey, for example,
 told the library researchers that it had no
 specific knowledge of the number and sizes
 of the caves.
 This same lack of information apparently
 extends to the highest intelligence officers.
 When Maj. Gen. Alva R. Fitch, the Army's
 Chief of intelligence, told Senate investiga-
 tore yesterday of Russian activity indicating
 underground storage of weapons, his pre-
 pared statement first asserted: "There are
 several hundred caves in Cuba" "Hundreds"
 was later scratched out and "thousands"
 substituted.
 NOT  ALL REMOVED
 Fitch noted persistent reports from refu-
 gees that not all long-range missiles had
 been removed from Cuba after the Russian
 agreement of last October 27.  However, he
 indorsed the official administration position
 which expressed the "belief" that the Rus-
 sians have removed all strategic missiles.
 The refugee reports contend that 88 medi-
 um-range (1.600 miles) missiles were sent to
 Cuba and that only 42 were withdrawn last
 foal.  The remaining 46 are underground,
 they assert.
 Such missiles easily could be hidden In
 Cuba's  caves,  Representative  CLEvELAND
 noted.  The  Library of Congress reported
 some studies of the caves in Spanish publi-
 cations, most of them, however, describing
 explorations and pictographs found on the
 wails. One of these was a century-old "guide
 to the cave of Befamar," on the San Juan
 River near Mantanzas Bay.
 CLEVELAND said this lack of accurate In-
 formation concerning the number and loca-
 tion of Cuba's caves was distressing.
 "It seems obvious." he saiii, "that we
 should have collected this information.  For
 more than 50 years prior to the Castro take-
 over we had freedom to acquire this in-
 formation.  Our information-gathering pro-
 grams have lacked selectivity and Impetus"
 The gentleman from New Hampshire
 has diligently pursued his research on
 Cuban caves.  On March 9, the Man-
 chester Union-Leader published the fol-
 lowing article on page 1:
 CLEVELAND ASKS DATA ON CUBAN CAVE NET-
 WORK
 WAsHINGTON.-A  Congressman  suggested
 Friday that it anyone has information on
 Cuban caves and their weapon-storage capa-
 bilities be should forward It to the Library
 of Congress.
 Representative JAMES  C.  CLEVELAND, Re-
 publican. of New Hampshire, said such data
 might help the Defense Department and con-
 gressional committees.                                                                                                      He noted that the
 Army's chief Intelligence officer told the Sen-
 ate Armed Services Committee Thursday that
 Cuban caves may hide Soviet weapons.
 More than a week ago CLavxiAND told the
 House there apparently is little accurate in-
 formation on the size, number or location of
 Cuba's caves.
 "For more than 50 years prior to the Castro
 takeover," CLEVELAND said, "we had freedom
 to acquire this information.  All of this sug-
 gests our information-gathering programs in
 the past have lacked selectivity and impetus"
 I am pleased to report that informa-
 tion is already being received by the Li-
 brary of Congress.
 I wish to applaud the nonpartisan
 efforts of the gentleman from New
 Hampshire.  He has taken the time and
 trouble to help Congress obtain sorely
 needed background information on a
 matter of importance to all Americans.
 Old-Age Care and the Public Purse
 EX'T'ENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. MILWARD' L. SIMPSON
 OF WYOMING
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Monday, March 11, 1963
 Mr. SIMPSON.  Mr. President, on
 February 25 I arose to praise an action
 of Wyoming's State Legislature in imple-
 menting the Kerr-Mills medical care
 bill.  I now ask unanimous consent to
 enter  in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  a
 newspaper article on that same subject
 by the distinguished columnist, Holmes
 Alexander.
 Mr. Alexander has noted Wyoming's
 action in becoming the 28th State to
 provide medical care for Its aged under
 the Joint Federal-State aegis of the Kerr-
 Mills act.
 His comments' pay tribute both to
 Wyoming's State government and the
 laudability of the Kerr-Mills program.
 I ask that they be printed in today's
 RECORD as further evidence of Joint co-
 operation in meeting the needs of senior
 citizens through voluntary, economically
 sound programs managed by State gov-
 ernments.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed In the RECORD,
 as follows:
 OLD-AGE CARE AND-THE PUBLIC PURSE
 (By Holmes Alexander)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-By the act of its cur-
 rent legislature, Wyoming becomes the 28th
 State to provide medical care for its aged
 under the Kerr-Mills Act by which the Fed-
 eral Government matches State funds.
 Although the bill passed the Wyoming
 House,  39 to 10, and passed the Senate,
 27 to 0, the lawmakers are not happy about
 It.  Neither is the Wyoming press.  Every-
 body concerned seems to feel that the prob-
 lem Is bigger than the solution, that the
 new act is helpful and necessary, but in-
 sufficient and imperfect.
 All Americans of conscience, I surmise,
 wish that more could be done for the needy
 aged.  It is a compassion that does the Na-
 tion credit, but it should not load us with a
 guilt complex that can be exploited by the
 bureau builders and  denigraters  of  this
 greathearted land.
 Old age is a natural law, an act of God,
 which cannot be repealed by human legisla-
 tures.  The best that mortals in a self-gov-
 erning society can do is insure that old per-
 sons In need are given medical aid which
 they, their communities, and their families
 are not willing or able to provide.
 It Is equally necessary for State and Fed-
 eral Governments to keep their guards up
 against chicanery and freeloading.  Welfare
 racketeering has become a scandal.  There
 are brigands who raid the public treasury
 behind masks of demagoguery.  There are

 Duties of the commission
 Sac. S. (a) The Commission shall establish,
 t operate, and maintain a program for the
 f orderly relocation of refugees from Cuba from
 the Dade- County, Florida, area to such other
 areas within the United States as may be
 appropriate.  Such program shall be con-
 ducted with due regard to the job oppor-

 relocation and resettlement with particular
 reference to job opportunities, housing fa-
 cilities, educational fac111tiCS, and oppor-
 tunities and facilities In general for adap%-
 tion of such refugees in each relocation and
 resettlement area to the way of life in the
 United States.  The Commission shall sub-
 mit an annual report to the President for
 presentation to the Congress of the results
 of such continuing study together with such
 recommendations as the Commission deems
 advisable.
 SEC. 4. There is hereby authorized to be
 appropriated annually to the Commission, to
 remain available until expended, such sums
 (not to exceed the amount of $25,000,000 an-
 nually) as may be necessary to carry out the
 purposes of this Act.
 Mr. Speaker, I believe that those who
 have criticism to offer about the present
 threatening and disturbing situation in
 Cuba owe It to the country to try to do
 something constructive or to offer criti-
 cism which will be helpful in the solution
 of the grievous burdens respecting that
 unhappy island which our President now
 has to bear.  We all know the awesome
 responsibility the President has had to
 bear to meet the challenge of commu-
 nistic imperialism In Cuba and to re-
 move from power In the unhappy island
 of Cuba that creature whose regime has
 been the source of aggression and sub-
 version against all the American States.
 The President deserves the oommenda-
 tion of the country indeed he has re-
 celved the acclaim of the Nation-for
 the courageous and effective manner in
 which heconfronted aggressive commu-
 nistic imperialism in Cuba and forth-
 with required before the observing eyes
 of the world the removal of the offensive
 missiles and planes which constituted a
 dangerous threat to the safety of the
 American people.  And the President
 has received and continues to enjoy the
 gratification of the country that he is
 steadily bringing about the removal of
 Soviet armed forces from Cuba and in
 his announced determination that the
 remainder of such forces shall be with-
 drawn as the spearhead of communistic
 Imperialism In the Western Hemisphere.
 But the coming of such Soviet Armed
 Forces Into Cuba and their continued
 presence In Cuba is a matter of concern
 not only to the United States, but to
 every State in the Western Hemisphere
 and to every peace-loving nation in the
 world. Such forces strengthen the hand
 of communistic subversion and aggres-
 sion in the Western World; they consti-
 tute a dire menace and threat to the
 security of every American state; their
 presence in Cuba constitutes a distinct
 and dangerous threat to the peace of the
 world. That is the reason, Mr. Speaker,
 I have Introduced today a resolution ex-
 pressing the sense of this House that the
 Government of the United States in such
 manner as the President should deter-
 mine should call upon the Organization
 of the American States and the United
 Nations to join us in a demand that the
 Soviet Union forthwith remove all of Its
 remaining armed forces from the island
 of Cuba.  The added strength, of the
 Organization of American States and the
 United Nations to our own demand will
 give It greater force and power and abate
 the breach of the Monroe Doctrine, the
 breach of the principles of the Organ-
 ization of American States and the
 breach of the United Nations Charter
 which theirpresencein Cuba constitutes.
 Mr. Speaker, on the first day this House
 met in the 88th Congress, I introduced
 a resolution declaring It to be the sense
 of this House, among other things, "that
 the fair Isle of Cuba must and shall be
 freed of the curse of Castro and com-
 munism " I have been assured ajl.ear)y
 hearing by the subcommittee of the
 House Foreign Affairs Committee upon
 this resolution. It does not attempt to
 prescribe for the President of the United
 States the method by which this high
 purpose shall be achieved but it does un-
 reservedly and Irrevocably decWre the
 sentiment of the Congress of the United
 States that Castro and communism must
 go from Cuba and that we shall never
 falter in our det rrminatinn that this
 isle formerly called the jewel of the Car-
 ribean shall be freed of this curse and
 the Western Hemisphere of this menace.
 I am sure when our President speaks
 shortly in Costa Rica among those most
 endangered by the threat of Castro and
 commussm from Cuba he will spell out
 many ways by which the American
 States can cooperate with other freedom-
 loving and peace-loving nations of the
 world in eradicating Castro and com-
 uiusim ffnm Cuba. It would seem tome
 that other of the American States
 March iX
 would wish to break all diplomatic rela-
 tions with Cuba as the United States
 has done; close their ports to Cuban
 ships and Cuban exports; require the
 closing of all Cuban embassies, minis-
 teries and consulates In the respective
 American countries to stop them from
 continuing to function as hot beds and
 spawning grounds of communistic ag-
 gression and subversion in the several
 American States; that the several Latin
 American  nations  should  cooperate
 more closely with the United States in
 the coordination of their political, eco-
 nomic and military policies respecting
 Cuba as long as Castro's or any Com-
 munist government shall be in power;
 that the United States should also call
 upon all friendly states everywhere in
 the world to stop commerce with Castro
 or communistic Cuba and if such states
 persist in giving aid, strength, and com-
 fort to our enemy in Cuba that we
 should advise them that neither their
 ships nor their commerce can enter the
 United States; that we should not ex-
 tend economic assistance or cooperation
 even through international financial in-
 stitutions to states which manifest that
 they prefer the friendship of Castro and
 communistic Cuba to that of the United
 States.  I know we can depend upon
 our President to do what Is the best
 thing to accomplish the objective upon
 which we are all united to free Cuba,
 the Western Hemisphere and the free
 world from the curse of Castro and
 communism and to remove the bridge-
 head of commuistic imperialistic ag-
 gression from the Western Hemisphere.
 Mr. Speaker, Castro and communistic
 tyranny In Cuba have brought to Dade
 County, Fla., some 200,000 Cuban refu-
 gees fleeing from communistic terror;
 many already robbed of all their posses-
 sions before they departed, others giving
 up everything they had in order to
 breathe the air of freedom in America.
 Our Government has willingly and gladly
 given sanctuary to these exiles from
 communistic persecution and horror;
 more than that we have been glad and
 proud to give them succor and sustenance
 in our country; we have extended to them
 the hand of fellowship in freedom and
 given them words of encouragement that
 we shall hasten the day when they may
 return to a free Cuba again.  But, Mr.
 Speaker, the congregation of over 200,000
 of these refugees in Dade County has im-
 posed a very serious economic burden
 upon the people of our county. In spite
 of the some $70 million a year the Federal
 Government has given for the sustenance
 and care and education of the children
 of these refugees, they still have felt it
 necessary in order to enjoy a higher level
 of living or subsistence than the funds
 federally provided enable them to enjoy
 to go into our economy and take by re-
 sponsible estimate some 30,000 jobs.  We
 already had a labor surplus in Dade
 County.  It is inevitable that the refu-
 gees willing to work at almost any wage
 have not only taken the jobs of many of
 our local citizens, but have lowered the
 wage scale for all of the people who work
 in our county. I wish we had jobs
 enough for our people and a surplus ad-
 equate to meet the needs of the refugees.

 County, a natural and highly desirable  why Soviet garrisons were established in the
 location for them; we have labored to
 increase social security benefi s, welfare

 we have been trying, in every way we
 could to assist our people in the hope
 that after our own, citizens had gainful
 employment of suitable character there
 would be a surplus of jobs for the Cuban
 refugees.  But we have not yet reached
 that point.
 . The Federal Government has not yet
 given us the assistance which we feel we
 are entitled to receive in giving jobs to
 the unemployed among our own citizens
 let alone the refugees,  We are continu-
 ing to struggle to achieve this end. But
 meanwhile, thoueands of our people are
 out of work, many of them having had
 their jobs taken by Cuban refugees.
 Until we can provide enough jobs for our
 own people and a surplus for the ref-
 ugees, it is imperative that we immedi-
 ately institute :a resettlement program
 which will remove to other parts of
 America-which, I am sure, will also hos-
 pitably receive them-the surplus refu-
 gees beyond our ability to absorb them
 in jobs not required by our local people.
 The agencies have been working upon
 the problem, but too little has been
 done and what has been done .has been
 done too late.  Accordingly, I have to-
 day introduced a resoultion to set up a
 high level Cabinet committee to insti-
 tute and immediately to effectuate a
 resettlement program for the Cuban
 refugees which will relieve this excessive
 burden and pressure upon our own
 people.  I hope the Congress will take
 prompt action upon this resolution and
 give our people the relief to which we
 have been,long entitled and avoid an
 unhappy increase in tension which has
 grown up in Dade County, between our
 displaced citizens and the Cuban gees on account of .t fir iiattral effort
 to better themselves above, the level of
 bare subsistence almost which, the boun-
 ty of our Government provides.
 Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I want
 to commend to every Member of this
 House and thee Congress a, letter entitled
 "A cQmmun}o, tiappearing in the
 Sunday Marc  16issue of the Washing-
 ton Post by the Honorable John C. Wiley,
 former Ambassador of the United States
 to Columbia, Iran, Portugal, and Pana-
 ma, and who, though in retirement, re-
 mains an able and wise counselor of his
 country,
 -" -        A tIOMMTNICATION
 The public parade of Soviet missiles into
 tuba and the complacently public parade of
 the same n[iisslles out of Cuba appear too
 obvious for a simple explanation. The Soviet
 before the takeover.   It also explains the
 successful rejection by China, Yugoslavia,
 and Albania of the primacy of the Kremlin.
 The  first  schismatic  was  Trotsky.   A
 refugee in a foreign country, armed only
 with ideas, he was easily disposed of. Mao
 Tse-tung is no Trotsky.   His elimination,
 were it possible, would not close the chasm
 with China. Mao represents a massive, or-
 ganized movement in a great country. When
 he disappears from the scene his cadres will
 survive.
 .But can the Soviet garrisons in Cuba in
 this late date successfully. impose the Krem-
 lin's authority in a remote island under a
 native leader, a self-anointed  Communist
 and domineering authoritarian who achieved
 power, like Mao and Tito, without active
 Soviet assistance?
 -In Cuba, Soviet authority  is, of course,
 great but it is limited.  It has long been
 clear to Moscow that Castro has quietly be-
 come the ally of Mao,                                                                            Throughout Latin
 America, the young, fiery Communists are
 much more attracted by the revolutionary
 afdor of both Mao and Castro than by, to
 them, the staid coexistence of Khrushchev.
 True, Castro's Cuba is dependent on the
 Soviet Union for desperately needed eco-
 nomic aid and for arms, munitions and mili-
 tary support.  In this area, Mao Tse-tung
 can neither" rep lace nor compete with Khru-
 shchev, but at the same time, Moscow can-,
 not prevent the covert financing of Castro-
 isin by China and the clandestine collabora-
 tion of Castro with Mao throughout Latin
 America.
 Effective foreign policy is based on altern-
 ative courses of action.  This is a principle
 followed by the  Soviet Union as demon-
 strated over long years by frequent zigzags.
 What alternative policies can the Kremlin
 pursue toward Castro; what" zigs and which
 zaks
 bnly three alternatives seem to exist.  The
 "first would be for the Soviet Union to wash
 'its hands of the whole Cuban affair.            This
 is obviously out of the question, if only for
 compelling reasons of prestige.  The second
 alternative would be for the Soviet Union
 and Communist China- to divide the world
 into   two   noncompetitive              geographical
 spheres of influence. Such a pact would
 be difficult to negotiate and still more difficult
 to carry out. Neither could trust the other.
 The third alternative is draconian, the harsh
 decision to eliminate Castro and replace him
 with someone subject to monolithic Krem-
 ainR discipline. This move is doubtless the
 only feasible choice, but it is one that re-
 quires subtle and careful preparation and
 great operational skill.
 'The elimination of Castro would not be
 foreign to Soviet procedures but it would
 the Caspian.
 Hopes rampant among Cuban refugees that
 disaffection  in  the  Cuban  armed  forces
 will lead to the overthrow of Castroism are
 as illusory as the conception that led to the
 fiasco of the Bay of Pigs.  Without a sim-
 ultaneous invasion by the United States, any
 anti-Castro initiative within Cuba, not con-
 trived by the Kremlin, could and would be
 quickly suppressed.
 But what about the Soviet missile bases
 in Cuba?  Surely Khrushchev did not need
 missile bases within Cuba itself in order to
 keep Castro in line.
 Obviously not, but they have served as a
 supremely astute stratagem with Castro for
 the Introduction of Soviet armed forces into
 Cuba, not merely forces to defend the Com-
 munist regime against internal disaffection,
 but primarily to deal with Castro whenever
 desirable or necessary.
 The missile bases in Cuba were indeed a
 magnificent multipurpose example of Soviet
 guile.  They were a tit for the tat of Ameri-
 can missile bases on the very fringes of Rus-
 sia.  Moreover, in addition to their intrinsic
 military value,  they  constituted  excellent
 bargaining pawns for the removal of our
 bases from Italy and Turkey.  And whether
 the missiles introduced into and removed
 from Cuba were genuine or Potemken stage
 settings, they were excellent weapons     for
 psychological (political) warfare.  Now, the
 only effective opposition to Castro in Cuba is
 the Soviet Union itself.  In any event, Khru-
 shchev deserves credit for having perpetrated
 the most brilliant stroke of international chi-
 cane of the of the present century.
 The Soviet Union continues to threaten
 war on the American mainland if the United
 States attacks Cuba.  This is putting dry
 froth on stale beer.  The Soviet Union knows
 perfectly well that the United States has no
 intention of attacking Cuba, just as we know
 perfectly well that the Soviet Union has no
 intention  of   attacking us  with  nuclear
 weapons should we do so.  However, there is
 always the dangerous possibility that Amer-
 ican activities with regard to Cuba might
 help to incite the old, perhaps compulsive
 urge of the messianic Russians to seek new
 pastures-pastures and warm waters-and
 serve as a precedent for so doing.  This pos-
 sibility has not been diminished by develop-
 ments in Iraq and Yemen.
 Middle East petroleum, or rather the threat
 of its denial to the West, could easily press
 the button of the holocaust.  Under existing -
 circumstances, Cuba does not involve the
 vital interests of any, except the Cubans
 themselves.  On the other hand, the Middle
 East touches the vital interests of many.  A
 cradle of civilization, it could be its deathbed.

 WAS$INOTON, D.C.-Critics of ADAM CcAT-

 lusion that he lacks prestige in the nation-
 wide Negro community, or that the recent
 attacks on POWELL have shaken this pres-
 ti a very much.

 by those who may deplore some of his acts.
 He seems to many Negroes to be one of
 their race who has broken through racial
 prejudice to stand on his own as an individ-
 UAI.
 In Washington, with its 54 percent Negro
 population and its 84 percent Negro school
 enrollment. criticism of PowsLL rasps on
 raw nerves in the Negro community.
 ZZACTED ANGRU.T
 The Washington Afro-American, one of
 the chain of newspapers which strongly af-
 fects Negro opinion, reacted angrily to the
 attempt of Clark R. Mollenhoff of the Reg-
 later's Washington bureau to pin down Pow-
 ELL at a press conference.  The prize-win-
 ning  investigative  reporter  was  probing
 PowELL  on the charges of Senator Jogs
 Wx.r.i.us,  Republican  of Delaware, who
 accuses Pow=.L of extensive abuses of his
 congressional position with the connivance
 of Kennedy administration officials.
 The reporter, a Drake University football
 star once optioned to the New York Giants,
 was criticized in a page 1 story in the Afro-
 American both for his questions and his
 physical condition.
 "The pasty-faced Mollenhoff, who resem-
 beld a former shotputter who has let him-
 self go to pot, tried repeatedly with just
 a trace of preciousness in his. slightly Lisping
 voice to put POWELL on the spot," the article
 stated. It continued with Its derision of
 the reporter but told little of either the
 questions or answers at the press conference.
 An editorial In the Afro-American elab-
 orated on these- views, centering its attack
 on Senator Wiuiaass and Columnist Drew
 Pearson.  The editorial predicted the day
 would come when "this great civil rights
 fighter  (PowELLJ  attains  even  greater
 heights.-
 "When he does," the editorial continued,
 "18 million colored thumbs are going to go
 up to i8 million colored noses to remind
 Drew Pearson and Senator Wn.z.IAMs that
 'what's good for you white geese is sure good
 for us colored ganders: "
 The editor of the Washington Afro-Amer-
 ican is C. Sumner Stone, Jr., who signed his
 name to the page 1 news article as "Chuck
 Stone."
 Stone will not long remain as editor of the
 Afro-American.  He has been appointed pub-
 lic affairs officer In the U.B. Information
 Service and will be placed in charge of the
 office  In  Tanganyika.  His  responsibility
 there will be to carry out programs of USIA
 Intended to give to the residents of the
 former British colony In east Africa a clear
 and accurate picture of conditions, opinions,
 attitudes, and culture of the United States.
 Stone says that be expects to go to Tan-
 ganyika in April.  He reinforces in conver-
 sation his views stated in the Afro-Ameri-
 can.
 "I could take you into the bars and barber
 shops and street corners In Washington and
 show you that 95 percent of the colored
 people think that the attack on PowzLL was
 clearly racial," he says.
 "POWELL has pulled a lot of deals we don't
 like, but if he Is going to be criticized It has
 got to be on the Negro's terms."
 ANOTHER NEGRO VIEW
 It Is impossible to convince Stone and
 most Negroes within sound and sight of
 PoweLL that Wn,w  ass was inspired by any-
 thing but racial feelings in spite of his long
 record to the contrary, and in spite of the
 role he has played over many years in the
 exposure of serious abuses in Government.
 Negroes sharing the view of Stone, and
 only grudgingly aware of PowELL's long and
 flagrant violation of generally accepted con-
 gressional standards. white or Negro, can-
 not conceive of any but a racial reason for
 WI.LIAM's attack.
 This is saddening.  It Is more saddening
 that POWELL can play upon the misguided
 Negro racism which  to  so evident In the
 words and tone of the Washington Afro-
 American.
 The dialog between the races In Wash-
 ington does not seem to be Improving In
 anywhere near the measure that the cir-
 cumstances justify.  Nor  is it reassuring
 that the well-mannered, well-dressed, but
 passionately spoken Stone is going to Tan-
 ganyika to Interpret America to the people
 and officialdom of an emerging nation.
 an'PERENT VIEW
 Wet get quite a different view than Stone's
 of Negro attitudes when another Negro jour-
 nalist, Simeon Booker, of Ebony magazine,
 speaks.  Booker is writing a book which he
 intends to make a balanced account of the
 need for Negro self-improvement as well as
 a plea for the opening of fairer opportunities.
 He points out that POWELL does not have
 much support or sympathy "among people
 who  think."   Booker's tool is  rationality;
 Stone's is emotion: PowzLL's is flimflam.

 A Des Mosxes Nrcao View
 (The following editorial appeared in the
 Iowa Bystander, a weekly newspaper pub-
 lished at Des Moines by and for Negroes.)
 It often happens that some people, placed
 in a position of responsibility and promi-
 nence, use this situation to abuse it by doing
 things a far less prepared citizen does.  Rep-
 resentative ADAM CLAYTON POWELL, of New
 York, is an excellent example of this.

 in America, elected from a district compris-

 Congress  and serve as  an  example        for
 younger people to point to with pride that
 a Negro had attained such a commanding
 position.
 There are those who opposed his elevation
 to that high post but the system of seniority
 made the choice automatic.
 March 11
 However, Representative Pow.ELL, unlike
 some other Negroes serving in Congress, has
 abused his position by his continued absen-
 teeism from duty, by loading up his staff
 far out of proportion to the other chairmen.
 He has abused the expenditure of public
 funds and he has failed or refused to pay
 his taxes to the Government which pays his
 salary.
 These derelictions of duty have brought
 stern criticism from Members of both Houses
 to the extent never before witnessed, and all
 because the charges lodged against him are
 true.
 Here is a public servant, a minister who,
 instead of conducting himself in a straight-
 forward manner, has done many things
 which bring disgrace, distrust, and shame,
 while representing a district whose people
 are entitled to a leader who should bring
 honor and prestige to the position which he
 holds. There is no excuse for Representative
 PowzLL's conduct.  It should not be con-

 Wu.soN FINDS  ADLAI SLOW To UNDERSTAND
 SOVIETS
 (By Richard Wilson)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-In an interview 'with
 the Associated Press, Adlai E. Stevenson has
 revealed  the attitude  of  mind  toward
 Russian negotiations which so many have
 found hard to understand.
 With 2 years' experience as U.N. Ambassa-
 dor, Stevenson says that he has changed his
 mind about the Russians.    He has dis-
 covered that they will stubbornly support
 positions which they seem fully prepared to
 reverse when it is expedient to do so.
 It seems Odd that Stevenson would have
 had to learn such a lesson, for this has been
 the uniform experience of Secretaries of
 State for the last quarter of a century.
 Stevenson has been a student of foreign
 affairs for at least that long.
 EXPECTED RUSSIA TO ACCOMMODATE
 Stevenson's statement is implicit confir-
 mation that the Kennedy administration
 came Into office with the belief that a new
 set of conditions  with Russia could  be
 created.                                              The United States should be able
 to accommodate itself in some ways to Rus-
 sian policy, and, In turn, if the negotiators
 were skillful enough, Russian policy would
 make accommodations, too.
 Thus Secretary Rusk began his "quiet"
 diplomatic moves.  President Kennedy con-
 ferred  with  Premier  Khrushchev.   New
 thoughts  were  formulated  by  Walt W.
 Rostow, McGeorge Bundy, and Paul Nitze.
 Under almost all conditions new solutions
 were pursued. About all this has proved
 was that the American political administra-
 tion bad changed, but the Russian political
 administration had not.

 THINKS  RUSSIANS  CAN  BE  HANDLED
 The result, to borrow a phrase from Col-
 umnist Arthur Krock, has been half-won
 victories,  which the administration  con-
 tinually advertises as great triumphs.
 In the wake of Khrushchev's withdrawal
 of missiles from Cuba a wave of euphoria
 washed over Washington.  Large but poorly
 described changes were foreseen. There were
 premonitions of some new order in the world
 based on Khrushchev's back down and his
 quarrel with his Chinese allies.  It was sup-
 posed that the noncommitted nations were
 losing their fascination with Russia.  Ad-
 ministration officials spoke of the missile
 withdrawal as if it were some historic turn-
 ing point.
 But now all the airy castles built on the
 shifting sands of the imagined new world
 order are coming tumbling down.  The cold
 war seems to have been renewed.  Khru-
 shchev is seen to have achieved important
 objectives in Cuba, though not all he sought.
 The test ban negotiations are again in a
 state of collapse.  We are warned once again
 that Russia will burn us up if we touch
 Cuba.
 TROOPS ARE STILL THERE
 It does not appear that there is much to
 be gained by not pressing advantages against
 the Soviet Union to their full limit when
 it was possible to do so, as in Cuba.  Now,
 months after the fullest pressure could have
 been brought, Russian troops are still in
 Cuba. We do not know how many are being
 taken out.  Nor have we achieved all the
 aims we sought when we confronted the
 world with the imminent prospect of nuclear
 war.
 There is_ enough now to confirm Steven-
 son's newfound wisdom about the Russians.
 We should keep the pressure on them when
 we can and gain the most from it. Only too
 soon they will have found new ways to move
 toward their unchanging general objectives.
 SUMMERTIME STUDENT JOBS IN
 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
 Mr. MILLER.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed at
 this point in the RECORD an editorial en-
 titled "Plum Jam," published in the Mil-
 waukee Sentinel of March 7, 1963. The
 editorial relates to the recent announce-
 ment  that appointments  of student
 trainees to Federal jobs during the sum-
 mertime will be cleared through the
 White House.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 Each year, more than 10,'60 students are
 given summer jobs by the  ederal Govern-
 ment.  The jobs mainly are'In Washington.
 Quite a bit of personal political patronage
 is involved, although the Civil Service Com-
 mission requires applicants to pass 'civil
 service examinatigns for c'le`rical td plst, and
 stenographer job`s.  In tne" `case of student
 trainee, jobs, in which college students take
 Federal suummer ' employment in what the
 Government hopes will be their Federal pro-
 fessions after graduation, they are selected
 from civil service registers.
 Now a storm of protest hasblown up in
 Congress following a report in the Washing-
 ton Star that the White House has taken
 ege a  e
 home States and the co
 any).
 Assuming that it is essential in the first
 place to hire  10,000 students for summer
 Federal work, the action of the White House
 in having them all run through the Presi-
 dential funnel for clearance fouls the civil
 service system.  Worse yet, this latest action
 appears to be but another example of a
 New Frontier attitude that is disdainful of
 the spirit, if not the law, of Federal civil
 service.
 In a Senate speech rapping the White
 House  student  patronage  plan,  Senator
 MILLER, Republican, of Iowa, accused the ad-
 ministration of having "an irresistible urge
 to play politics with our civil service system."
 "First,"  Senator  MILLER recalled, "there
 was the shocking direetive to civil service
 employees that they should be expected to
 participate in trying to sell proposed new
 programs to the general public.  This was
 belatedly and grudgingly withdrawn due to
 the revulsion of the public in general and
 carreer civil service employees in particular.
 Next our civil service employees were pres-
 sured to buy $100 tickets to the Democratic
 fund raising dinner here through the clever
 device of having them invited to cocktail
 parties of their bosses if they had purchased
 a ticket. * * *  And now, this administra-
 tion apparently is not going to wait until
 people have civil service status for an op-
 portunity to engage in partisan political
 activities."
 The Kennedy administration defends the
 plan by saying that its primary concern is
 that the student talent be put to the best
 use possible and groomed for regular Federal
 employment when the youths graduate.
 Desipte this high sounding explanation,
 the plan is high handed.   It's something
 new  in  the  way  of  harvesting  political
 plums-pick 'em while they're green.
 PROGRAM UNTIL. AFTER WHEAT
 Mr. MILLER.        Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed at
 this point in the RECORD an article en-
 titled "Shuman Asks Congress To Wait
 until after Wheat Referendum To Write
 Farm Laws," published in the American
 Farm Bureau Federation's official news-
 letter of March 4, 1963, together with
 table 1, which indicates the various fac-
 tors which have ocurred in the reduction
 of the carryover of feed grains.  The
 table points up in an excellent way why

 grains is due in very minute part to the
 emergency feed grain program of the
 last 2 years.
 There being no objection, the article
 and table were ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:
 SHUMAN ASKS CONGRESS To WAIT UNTIL AFTER
 WHEAT REFERENDUM To WRITE FARM LAWS
 Charles B. Shuman, president of the Amer-
 ican Farm Bureau  Federation, has urged
 Congress to delay any decision on the type
 of_feed grain program to be in effect after
 19?3.  11
 He said the legislators should wait until
 after the signup under the 1963 feed grain
 program has been completed and the result
 of the forthcoming wheat referendum is
 known.
 3705
 At a  House  Agriculture subcommittee
 hearing last Thursday, Mr. Shuman said that
 if the wheat referendum carries, "there still
 will be ample time to consider and adopt a
 feed grain program for 1964.
 "If the wheat referendum does not carry,
 which we think more likely, then by all
 means  this  commitee  and  the, Congress
 should consider  wheat  and  feed  grains
 together."
 There is urgent need for a more effective,
 less costly, and less disruptive program," the
 Farm Bureau president declared.
 "We pledge our support in helping to de-
 velop such a program when the results of the
 wheat referendum are known."
 Here is the full text of  Mr.  Shuman's
 statement at the hearing:
 "We appreciate the opportunity to discuss
 the operation and results of the 1961 and
 1962 feed grain programs. We also would
 like to comment briefly on the 1963 feed
 grain program and its implications. Finally,
 we would like to discuss with this committee
 a course of action which we believe would be
 wise and best for farmers.
 "Before we get into a detailed discussion
 of the feed grain program, we would like to
 urge strongly that this committee delay any
 decision on the type of feed grain program
 to be in effect  after 1963, until  (1)  the
 signup under the 1963 feed grain program
 has been completed and announced and (2)
 the multiple-price  wheat    referendum  has
 been held and the result is known.
 Our reasons for asking the committee to
 delay any decision on a feed grain program
 are:
 1. Most feed grains are spring planted.
 There will be ample time, after the wheat
 referendum, for action by Congress on a
 future program for feed grains.
 2. The signup for the 1963 feed grain pro-
 gram will continue until at least March 22
 (or later if the time is extended).  No one
 knows until then what feed grain producer
 reaction will be to the 1963 compensatory
 payment program.
 3. If the complicated, restrictive, multiple-
 price wheat program is approved in the up-
 coming referendum, one set of circumstances
 will prevail.   On the other hand, if it is
 voted down, this will create substantially
 different conditions for wheat, feed grain,
 and livestock producers.   If this happens,
 this  committee  and the  Congres  would
 then most certainly want to reanalyze the
 entire wheat, feed grain, and livestock prob-
 lem in order to do justice to all producers.
 This committee should not tie its own hands
 by acting prematurely, without having all
 the facts necessary for sound judgment.
 You are well aware of the fact that Farm
 Bureau has a membership of over 1,607,000
 farm families in 49 States and Puerto Rico.
 Most of our members produce feed grains
 and livestock although many, of course, have
 a larger economic stake in other commodities.
 A large number produce wheat and feed
 grains.  Our members strongly believe that
 feed grain and wheat legislation are closely
 related and that both affect livestock pro-
 duction and prices.  We strongly believe that
 any future programs for feed grains  and
 wheat should be considered together.
 RESULTS OF 1961 AND 1962 FEED GRAIN
 PROGRAMS
 The  administration claims that the so-
 called emergency feed grain program                                                                                                                            has
 been a great success, since the buildup in
 supplies has been halted and some progress
 has been made in reducing carryover stocks.
 What are the facts?
 Fact 1. A sizable majority of the eligible
 producers gave the program a "no confi-
 dence" vote by staying out, both in 1961
 .and 1962.
 In - 1961 only 42 percent of the farmers
 with corn and grain sorghum bases signed
 program contracts.  In 1962 contracts were

 signed by 44 percent of the producers with
 corn and grain sorghum bases and 29 per-
 cent of Lose with barley bases.
 Pact.    The acreage that was diverted
 under the program did not result in a cor-
 responding reduction in feed grain plant-
 ings.
 In 1961 the Government contracted for
 approximately 4 acres for each .3 acres by
 which corn and grain sorghum plantings
 were reduced from the 1959-60 base.  In
 1962 it contracted for approximately 5 acres
 for each 3yz acres by which corn, grain
 sorghums, and barley were reduced from the
 1959-$0 base.
 In 1959-60 the total acreage planted to
 the four principal feed grains averaged 151.3
 million acres.
 .In  1961  farmera planted  129.3 million
 acre to feed grains and were paid for di-
 verting 26.7 million acres.  Thus, the total
 of 156 million acres planted or diverted
 in 1061 was 4.7 million acres ,greater than
 1959-60 plantings.
 In 1962 farmers planted  125.9 million
 acres to' feed grains and were paid for di-
 verting 32.7 million acres.  Thus, the total
 planted .pplus the acreage diverted rose to
 188.6 mitlion.acres, or'7.3 million acres more
 than the average planted in 195060.
 The increase in feed grain acreage (in-
 eluding diverted acreage)    under the pro-
 gram reflects increased plantings by non-
 participating farmers and adjustments in
 the base acreage of participating producers.
 Pact 3. The production of feed grains was
 reduced less than the reduction in acreage
 planted because yields increased.
 Apologists for the program have attrib-
 uted most of the 1961 Increase in yields to
 weather.  But yields rose again  in  1962.
 (Per-acre corn yields averaged 53.8 bushels
 in 195940 and rose to 82 bushels In 1961
 and 64.1 bushels in 1962.)
 In 1961, as compared with the base period
 1959-60, the acreage devoted to four feed
 grains was reduced 14.5 percent and the
 production of four -feed grains (total ton-
 nage basis) was reduced 7.9 percent.
 In 1982, as compared with the 1959-60
 bade, the acreage devoted to four feed grains
 was reduced 16.8 percent and the produc-
 tion of four feed grains was reduced 6.2 per-
 cent.
 " Pact 4.  The reduction in feed grain stocks
 has been due almost entirely to increased
 utilization and not to the Government pro-
 gram. At the beginning of the 1981 marketing
 year, feed grain stocks totaled a record of 84.7
 million tons.
 By the beginning of the current market-
 ing year stocks had been reduced to 71.8 mil-
 lion tons,  Only a very small part of this
 reduction of 12.9 million tons can be at-
 tributed to the ' feed grain program.
 The production of feed grains was reduced
 15 million tons in 1961, but barley, and
 oats--which were not included in the 1961
 program-accounted for 3.1 million tons of
 this reduction.
 One of the most significant factors In the
 feed grain situation is the increase In utiliz-
 ation which has been occurring.  Domestic
 consumption and exports of feed grains in-
 creased $.1 million tons in the marketing year
 1981 (as compared with 1980).
 To summarize, under the 1961 program,
 stocks were reduced 12.9 million tons, but if
 there had been no increase in utilization and
 no reduction in the production of feed grains
 not covered by the 1961 program, the reduc-
 tion in carryover would have been less than
 2 million tons.
 It now appears that stocks will be reduced
 10.8 million tons (from 71.8 to 61 million)
 during the 1962 marketing year.  This re-
 duction Is almost entirely accounted for by
 Increased utilization and a reduction In the
 production of oath.  As compared with 1961,
 total production of feed grains increased 2.5
 million tons (from 140.6 million tons to 143.1
 million tons) and exports are expected to
 decline by about 1.7 million tons this year.
 By the fall of 1962, feed grain stocks will
 have been reduced by a total of approxi-
 mately 23.7 million tons from the 1981 level.
 But, if there had been no Increase In utiliza-
 tion and no reduction In production of crops
 not under the program, the total reduction
 in stocks would be only a little over 2 mil-
 lion tons (see table 1). Thus, 90 percent of
 the reduction In feed grain carryover was
 due to factors other than the effect of the
 emergency program.
 Fact 5. The total direct cost-41.7 bil-
 lion--of the 1961 and 1962 feed grain pro-
 grams cannot be justified by what has ac-
 tually  been  accomplished  under  these
 programs.
 55ARKE   PRICES  DEPRE58En
 Early in 1961, when this committee was
 discussing the 1981 feed grain program we
 spoke out against one of Its most disturbing
 features. We called this the obvious threat
 to use the Government's huge surplus stocks
 to  beat  down  the  market  price  of feed
 grains.   We denounced this proposal as a
 brandnew and fallacious concept.    We con-
 tinued to oppose the dumping of CCC feed
 grain stocks during the 1962 program.  We
 have continually pointed out that this use
 of CCC stocks Is bad for our market system
 for grain and that it severely penalizes pro-
 ducers who want to sell their feed grains on
 the market.
 As we have already pointed out, consider-
 ably more than 60 percent of all feed grain
 producers stayed out of the feed grain pro-
 gram in 1981 and In 1962.  Dumping CCC
 feed grains on the market held down their
 market price and, of course, lowered their
 incomes.
 We also pointed out early in 1961 that
 dumping feed grain stocks onto the market
 would ultimately adversely affect poultry.
 dairy, and livestock production and prices
 for these commodities. Let us review briefly
 what has happened in this regard.
 Poultry and dairy production have con-
 tinued above what they would have been if
 CCC stocks of feed grains had not been
 dumped.  Prices of both these commodities
 have been depressed because of this unwise
 action.
 Numbers of hogs coming to market and
 cattle on feed and being marketed are also
 up considerably.  Hog prices are down, and
 top cattle prices have taken one of the
 sharpest drops in history-over $7.00 per
 hundredweight since last fall.  This, too,
 has been caused In part by the dumping of
 CCC stocks of feed grain.
 We realize that some persons have sup-
 ported the feed grain program on the ground
 that it has been an effective way,of pouring
 "free money" from Washington Into the feed
 grain areas.  But what Is happening cur-
 rently to livestock, dairy, and poultry prices
 would Indicate a loos in income to feed grain,
 poultry, dairy, hog, and cattle producers of
 several times the payments made to feed
 grain growers under the 1961 and 1962 pro-
 grams.
 THE  1963  TEED  GRAIN  PROGRAM
 As we stated previously, It is too early to
 determine the reaction of feed grain pro-
 ducers to the 1983 program and the results
 that can be anticipated from its operation.
 The slgnup period has several weeks to run.
 The 1963 program has most of the bad fea-
 tures of the 1961 and 1962 programs and, in
 addition, contains a provision for Brannan-
 type compensatory payments.  Since pay-
 ments are to be made on the "normal" yield
 of planted acres, they encourage producers
 to participate on a minimum basis and to di-
 vert their poorest acres.
 As members of this committee know, we
 are opposed to the compensatory payment
 concept.  Our reasons for opposing~pay-
 ments are spelled out in our 1963 policies as
 adopted b the voting delegates of the mem-
 ber State Farm Bureaus:
 "Compensatory payments are proposed in a
 variety of forms.  Regardless of the form in
 which presented, the payment approach is
 unsound and dangerous to our economic and
 political system.    It would be fantastically
 expensive and would stimulate production,
 Increase unit costs, depress market prices,
 lead to tight production controls, and make
 farmers dependent on congressional appro-
 priations for a substantial part of their total
 income.
 "Limitations on payments to individuals
 would place a ceiling on opportunity and
 level farm incomes downward.
 "Payment programs would socialize the
 production and distribution of food and fiber
 by having consumers pay a part of the cost
 through taxes-rather than full value at the
 store.  This is a trap for producers.  Ulti-
 mately, the payment approach also would be
 a trap for consumers, since It would en-
 courage inefficiency and thereby result in
 high real costs of food and fiber.
 "We vigorously oppose any system of com-
 pensatory payments for agriculture."
 In summary, we strongly urge this com-
 mitteee to delay any further action on a feed
 grain program until after the multiple price
 wheat referendum.  If the wheat referen-
 dum carries, there still will be ample time
 to consider and adopt a feed grain program
 for 1964.  If the wheat referendum does not
 carry (which we think more likely), then by
 all means this committee and the Congress
 should  consider  wheat and  feed  grains
 together.
 Finally, we have pointed out why we be-
 lieve the 1961, 1962, and 1983 feed grain pro-
 grams have not, and will not, solve the
 basic problem in feed grain and livestock ag-
 riculture.  There Is urgent need for a more
 effective, less costly, and less disruptive pro-
 gram.  We pledge our support in helping to
 develop such a program when the results of
 the wheat referendum are known.

 Norf.-It may be argued that the carryover would
 have increased It there had been no feed grain program.
 The point, however, is that the program has done little
 except to stop the buildup. The reduction In accumu-
 lated stocks is almost entirely due to Increased utiliza-
 tion and reduced production of feed crops not covered
 by the program.
