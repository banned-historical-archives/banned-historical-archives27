CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
THE WEEK IN BRIEF 
PART I 
OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST  
MOSCOW INCREASES PRESSURES ON PEIPING IN SINO-SOVIET 
DISPUTE   
Since the Bucharest meeting in June, Moscow has taken 
the offensive in an effort to pressure Peiping into a 
settlement of Sino-Soviet differences on Moscow's terms. 
The situation is sufficiently serious that Moscow may have 
felt compelled to apply economic sanctions against Peiping. 
Although still unconfirmed, there are indications that the 
USSR may be withdrawing technicians from China. Khrushchev 
apparently hops to bring Peiping around to Moscow's point 
of view prior to another conference of Communist parties, 
reportedly to be held in Moscow in November. The Soviet 
Union is concerned over the effect the dispute may have 
on its leadership of Communist parties throughout the world. 
DEVELOPMENTS IN SOVIET FOREIGN RELATIONS   
Soviet propaganda on the Powers trial is taking the 
line that US policy is the real defendant. Moscow is 
giving full and prompt coverage to the details of the pro-
ceedings. A Soviet official in London acknowledged recent-
ly that the current anti-US phase of his country's policy 
is planned to last through the American elections and is 
aimed primarily  at weakening world confidence in the 
United States, 
CONGO 
Congo Premier Lumumba evidently is relying on strong 
Soviet support in his dispute with UN Secretary General 
Hammarskjold and presumably expects to obtain backing from 
at least some African states, as well as from Moscow, in 
any moves he may make directly against the dissident 
separatists in Katanga and other provinces. Lumumba's 
declaration of martial law appears to be a legal pre-
liminary to action against the dissidents, and to clear 
the way politically he may attempt to replace moderates 
in his cabinet with more leftists. Lumumba's "military" 
capabilities are limited at present, particularly relative 
to those of the Katanga regime, and the central govern-
ment's effective authority does not extend far,maside.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
PART I (continued) 
LAOS   Page 8 
General Phoumi and the bulk of the other members of 
former Premier Somsanith's government refuse to recognize 
the authority of the new Souvanna Phouma government and 
are mustering forces for an assault on Vientiane, still 
held by Captain Kong Le's forces. King Savang, while 
apparently secretly in sympathy with the Phoumi group, 
has evinced a strong disinclination to intervene, despite 
the fact that he is the only figure capable at this stage 
of bringing the contending groups together for negotia-
tions looking to a compromise. If the impending armed 
conflict is not headed off, the Communist Pathet Lao 
insurgents may intervene on behalf of Kong Le, enabling 
them to identify themselves with a revolutionary cause 
which seems to have struck a responsive chord among some 
segments of Laotian opinion. Sino-Soviet bloc propaganda 
is handling the crisis in Laos somewhat gingerly but with 
obvious satisfaction over the turn of events. Britain and 
France are sympathetic to Souvanna Phouma. 
PART II 
NOTES AND COMMENTS  
CUBAN DEVELOPMENTS   Page 1 
Most Sino-Soviet bloc Communist parties sent dele-
gates to the eighth national congress of Cuba's Popular 
Socialist (Communist) party, which opened in Havana on 16 
August and apparently was timed to coincide with the 
meetings of the OAS foreign ministers in Costa Rica. The 
Cuban delegation's complaint over security arrangements 
at the foreign ministers' meetings and its threat to walk 
out have aroused antagonism there. Cuba's withdrawal 
might be followed by its demand that the UN Security Coun-
cil again consider the Cuban complaint about US economic 
aggression which the council referred to the OAS in mid-
July. 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC   
Members of the Dominican regime--still effectively 
controlled by Trujillo--show increasing signs of nervous-
ness over their position. This uncertainty is heightened 
by developments at the first OAS foreign ministers' meet-
ing, where Venezuela, the motivating force behind this 
meeting, is backing its demand for strong anti-Dominican

measures by threats to withdraw completely from the OAS 
and take unilateral--possibly military--action against 
the Trujillo regime. Trujillo himself has shown increasing 
anger toward the United States. 
YUGOSLAVIA BACKS USSR IN SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE   
The Yugoslav regime has backed Khrushchev in his dis-
pute with Chinese Communist leaders over policy and 
ideology. On 12 August the authoritative Belgrade daily 
Borba began serializing a "dissertation" by Edvard 
Kardelj, the regime's top ideologist, dealing with such 
issues as "peaceful coexistence" and "the inevitability 
of war." The principal object of attack in these arti-
cles is Communist China, but criticism of some Soviet 
policies is implied, and the series seems likely to 
further damage bloc-Yugoslav relations. 
NEW SOVIET CONSUMER DECREE   
(b)(3) 
Page 4 
(b)(3) 
Page 5 
A new Soviet decree on retail trade, the third major 
consumer decree in two years, is concerned with improving 
the quality, variety, and distribution of consumer goods, 
as well as with eliminating the worst of numerous shopping 
inconveniences. While most of the provisions of the decree 
are in the form of suggestions to appropriate agencies, one 
requires that plans for production of co sumer goods be  
consonant with retailers' requirements. 0:0(3) 
SOVIET-UAR RAPPROCHEMENT   Page 6 
Moscow appears to be meeting with considerable success 
in its efforts to promote close political cooperation with 
Cairo. The UAR has publicly sided with the Soviet posi-
tions on a number of current international issues and has 
openly applauded Soviet policies, while criticizing the 
attitude of the United States. The rapprochement--
encouraged by Moscow through public praise of UAR policies 
and willingness to supply additional military and economic 
aid--has been facilitated by Nasir's recent expressions of 
irritation with the United States. 
MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS   
The meeting of Arab League foreign ministers beginning 
on 22 August in Lebanon will probably produce more discord 
than agreement. The UAR and Jordan are engaged in an in-
tensive propaganda battle in which each government is 
calling upon the people of the other country to rebel.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
PART II (continued) 
KIM IL-SUNG CALLS FOR FEDERATION OF NORTH AND SOUTH 
KOREA   Page 8 
North Korean Premier Kim Il-sung has proposed a loose 
federation of North and South Korea and all-Korean elec-
tions "without outside intervention," in an apparent 
effort to take the propaganda initiative from South 
Korea, which is expected to support reunification 
through UN-supervised elections in both halves of the 
country. While Pyongyang's position on reunification 
has not radically changed, the federation proposal is in-
tended to show that Pyongyang is seeking a fresh approach 
to the problem. The South Korean rejection of the pro-
posal will be exploited by the Communists to demonstrate 
Seoul's intransigence. Khrushchev can be expected to give 
the North Korean proposals a propagamda_boost_when_he 
visits Pyongyang in early October. 
FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT   
Page 9 
(b)(3) 
A factional conflict within the South Korean conserva-
tive Democratic party, which won an overwhelming victory 
in the parliamentary elections of 29 July, may result in 
prolonged political instability. At present no party 
leader appears to command a working majority of the 179 
Democrats in the 233-seat lower house, and the new govern-
ment is likely to be dependent on the support of independ-
ents, Prolonged bickering and maneuvering for power 
could lead to public resentment against the government and 
result in renewed civil disorders. Although the military 
has remained a major stabilizing factor. such unrest might 
spill over into the armed forces. (b)(3) 
INTERNAL FRICTION THREATENING MALI FEDERMON 
Discord between Senegal and Soudan--the constituent 
states of the newly independent Federation of Mali--has 
recently intensified to such an extent that an early 
breakup of the federation is possible. The crisis arises 
from the Soudan's apparent backing down on its agreement 
to support Sengalese leader Leopold Senghor for president 
of Mali. Friction has been building up between the two 
regions for some time, however, over disputed ap ointments 
and differences in outlook on foreign affairs. 
TRIALS OF DEPOSED TURKISH LEADERS TO BEGIN SOON 
Turkey's ruling National Unity Committee has almost 
completed investigations in preparation for public trials 
of key members of the ousted Bayar-Menderes regime. Some 
of these indicted will probably be executed.

REPERCUSSIONS IN BELGIUM OF CONGO CRISIS   Page 12 
Under heavy public censure for ineptitude in the 
Congo crisis, Belgium's Premier Eyskens has responded by 
demanding a parliamentary vote of confidence after promis-
ing to make budget cuts--mainly on military items--to meet 
the anticipated losses from Congo operations. Eyskens 
will probably also reshuffle a few cabinet posts and at-
tempt to work out a new financial program acceptable to 
all factions. Belgium's bitterness at its allies over 
the Congo issue will result in some cuts in NATO commit-
ments. 
ADENAUER TALKS WITH DE GAULLE AND MACMILLAN 
De Gaulle's plans for a French-led confederation of 
Continental Europe were apparently the major subject of 
discussion at his meeting with Adenauer on 29-30 July. To 
what extent Adenauer is in agreement with De Gaulle is 
still uncertain, and his subsequent offer to Macmillan to 
attempt to end the dispute between the Common Market and 
the British-led Outer Seven may indicate reservations 
about the French proposals. 
PART III 
PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES 
KHRUSHCHEV'S STRATEGY ON BERLIN 
Since the breakdown of the summit conference, 
Communist tactics on the Berlin issue have been gradu-
ally brought into line with the more aggressive posture 
Khrushchev has adopted toward the West. Following the 
initial period of reassuring gestures by Moscow, the 
bloc has mounted an extensive psychological warfare 
operation apparently designed to focus public attention 
on the dangerous aspects of the Berlin situation and to 
dispel any notion in the West that Moscow has retreated 
from its basic demands. The dominant element in this 
campaign remains the threat to conclude a separate peace 
treaty with East Germany, followed by East German assump-
tion of access controls to Berlin. In an effort to 
achieve his Berlin objectives through negotiations, 
Khrushchev might intensify pressure tactics in the hope 
of weakening Western resolution on the status of Berlin.

Cyprus, officially independent on 16 August, has

some extreme nationalists opposed to the 1959 settlement,

UNREST .CONTINUES AMONG SOVIET. ARTISTS .   Page 11 
Although the Kremlin has succeeded in containing the 
rebellion among Soviet writers, which was at its height in 
1956 and 1957, strong undercurrents of discontent with 
official dogma persist in other areas of Soviet creative 
work. The spirit of Western "modernism," in particular, 
has infected the Soviet pictorial arts, which flourish 
as an "underground" movement defiant of the officially 
imposed "socialist realism." The regime, while reluctant 
to impose repressive sanctions, fears the virus of non-
conformity and is seeking ways to preserve the propa-
gandistic function of Soviet art.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
PART I 
OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST 
MOSCOW INCREASES PRESSURES ON PEIPING IN SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE 
Since the meeting of bloc 
leaders at Bucharest in June, 
Moscow has taken the offensive 
in an effort to pressure Pei-
ping into a settlement of Sino-
Soviet differences on Moscow's 
terms. Khrushchev apparently 
hopes to bring Peiping around 
to Moscow's point of view prior 
to the convening of another 
conference of Communist parties, 
reportedly to be held in Mos-
cow in November. 
The situation is sufficent-
ly serious that Moscow may have 
felt compelled to apply eco-
nomic sanctions against China.  
  during the past ten days 
large numbers of Soviet special-
ists have left the Chinese cap-
ital by rail for the USSR. A 
in Moscow 
was recently told by a woman 
believed to be the wife of a 
that Soviet 
leaders decided during a meet-
ing on 28 July to withdraw So-
viet technicians from Communist 
China within three months. 
In a virtually unprecedent 
ed development in recent years, 
not a single Moscow commentary 
devoted to any aspect of Chinese 
Communist affairs has been broad-
cast to Soviet listeners since 
5 July. Moreover, there has 
been no Soviet home radio com-
ment since June on Chinese Com-
munist economic progress or So-
viet aid to China. 
Both Pravda and Izvestia  
have published articles during 
the past week devoted to the 
Soviet view of peaceful coex-
istence and the noninevitabil-
ity of war. An article by B. 
Ponomarev in Pravda on 12 Au-
gust reiterafFirin the standard 
formulations used by Khrushchev 
to argue that China's views are 
incorrect. In a thinly veiled 
reference to the Chinese on 13 
August, Izvestia assailed as 
dogmatists those who argue that 
war cannot be prevented and 
called it "blasphemy" for such 
people to refer to Lenin in 
their remarks. 
The publication of Druzhba, 
the Russian-language magazine 
of the Sino-Soviet iftiend; , 
0) 
Society, has apparently b 
suspended, and Kitai (China), a 
semimonthly publication, re-
portedly has not been available 
in Moscow since April. Follow-
ing India's recent closurt^f 
New China News Agency (NCIP.1(1) 
facilities in New Delhi, the 
TABS bureau chief in New 
reportedly refused a Chine.M0) 
request that he handle NCNA 
press releases, on the ground 
that the issue was a matter be-
tween the Indian and Chinese 
governments. Moscow apparently 
is also willing to supply India 
with military equipment, includ-
ing four helicopters which New 
Delhi decided in early August 
to buy for use in patrolling 
its northern border regions. 
The Chinese Communists for 
their part returned to polemic 
in a 13 August People's Daily  
editorial asserting that "modern 
revisionists" were spreading 
calumny and slander against China

and were "apologists for im-

boycotted the international 
congress of Orientalists now 
meeting in Moscow. Relations 
with Moscow were probably the 
primary subject for debate by 
the Chinese Communists at a 
series of high-level party 
meetings believed held since 
June. 
Plans are reportedly be-

to hold another meeting of 
representatives of all Com-
munist parties in an attempt to 
resolve the conflict of views 
which continues to divide the 
Soviet Union and Communist 
China. 
At the Bucharest meeting.  
An 82-page document 
circulated there by the Russians 
presented a detailed criticism 
of Chinese actions and declara-
tions during the past two years. 
It accused the Chinese of fol-
lowing an extremely nationalist, 
chauvinist policy and of under-
estimating the risks involved 
in local wars. The document 
scored Peiping for opposing Mos-
cow's gradualist strategy in 
underdeveloped countries such 
as India and Indonesia and of 
refusing to join in common de-
fense proposals of the USSR, 
which included setting up mis-
sile bases and radar-detection 
units in Communist China.

Bucharest were stunned by the 
viciousness of the dispute, but 
either through conviction or as 
a result of Soviet pressure, 
they supported the Soviet Union. 
The Chinese delegate, however, 
carried the fight to larger 
meetings of representatives of 
all Communist parties on 25 and 
26 June. As a result, appar-
ently at the suggestion of the 
Rumanian delegate chairing the 
meetings, an international com-
mission comprising both bloc 
and nonbloc delegates was es-
tablished to prepared for an-
other conference./

the seriousness of the Sino-
Soviet dispute, which, in view 
of Peiping's refusal to alter 
its position, has made it in-
evitable that "the disagreement 
will have to be carried through 
to the end." 
Such preliminary discus-
sions would be the forerunner 
of the reported Moscow mc4zig, 
probably to be held in cMlhc-
tion with the USSR's Bolshevik 
Revolution celebration on 7 
November. In November 1957, 
however, a similar meeting at-
tended by Mao Tse-tung worked 
out a declaration which was in-
strumental in maintaining a 
facade of unity for only a few 
months thereafter. 
The Soviet leaders are in-
creasingly concerned over the 
strain the dispute imposes on 
national Communist parties whose 
traditional left-right disagree-
ments are being exacerbated by 
the existence of two opposing 
views at the apex of the Com-
munist movement.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
Even in certain bloc par-
ties there were indications be-
fore the Bucharest meeting of 
support for some of the Chinese 
views. Albania, the last hold-
out among the Eastern European 
satellites, threw its support 
to Khrushchev in a speech by 
party boss Enver Hoxha on 2 Au-
gust during a visit to that 
country by French Communist par-
ty leader Maurice Thorez, who 
might have acted on the occa-
sion as Moscow's spokesman. 
During the past few weeks, 
Khrushchev and other Soviet of-
ficials have met with several 
satellite leaders, including the 
Hungarian, East German, and per-
haps the Rumanian party chiefs. 
The Soviet premier undoubtedly 
used the discussions to restate 
his position in the Sino-Soviet 
dispute. North Korea, which up 
to the Bucharest meeting had on 
many occasions supported Chinese 
views, has expressed Soviet con-
cepts in propaganda commentary 
since 5 July. 
Within the parties of the 
free world, the Sino-Soviet dis-
pute has been mirrored in de-
bates between left or "hard" 
factions, which borrow. from 
Chinese declarations for sup-
port, and right elements, which 
tend to espouse a greater degree 
of nationalism and rely on So-
viet arguments. In India, the 
Communist monthly journal has 
been reprinting Chinese speeches 
and the inflammatory Red Flag 
articles, while the w1T-1-5Ub-
lication reprints Soviet speeches 
and statements. Recently the 
editor of the widely circulated 
leftist Indian weekly Blitz stat-
ed that the lengthy article in 
the 30 July issue strongly at-
tacking the Chinese Communist 
party as "Trotskyite" was planted 
by the leaders of the pro-Soviet 
moderate faction of the Indian 
Communist party. 
(b)(1) 
The announcement that Khru-
shchev has accepted a formal 
invitation to visit North Ko-
rea in early October suggests 
that the Soviet premier may 
use the forum to amplify Mos-
cow's position in the current 
Sino-Soviet dispute immediate-
ly prior to the high-level Com-
munist meeting in Moscow. 
Speculation persists over a 
possible visit by him to Peiping; 
an AFP correspondent recently 
reported that after a 24-hour 
delay, the Soviet censors passed 
a dispatch which hinted that 
Khrushchev would go thereaIter 
his North Korean visit. 
DEVELOPMENTS IN SOVIET FOREIGN RELATIONS

Powers trial is taking the line 
that US policy is the real de-

"sensational statements" under 
interrogation. The opening of 
the trial, however, has resulted 
in only a modest increase in 
the volume of propaganda. 
Moscow has given prompt 
and full coverage to the de-
tails of proceedings, emphasiz-
ing the points that'the U-2 was 
at an altitude of 68,000 feet 
when "hit," and that it "could" 
have carried a nuclear weapon. 
TASS informed the regional press 
that daily summaries would be 
transmitted and that reports 
up to three columns each day 
would be dispatched. While 
press reports for foreign con-
sumption are relatively factual, 
those for the Soviet public are 
liberally interspersed with 
propaganda. The first summary 
of the trial, with selected 
quotes from Powers' testimony, 
made a point of listing the non-
bloc lawyers and journalists 
in attendance. 
Anti-US Campaign  
In discussing the current 
anti-American phase of Soviet 
policy, a Soviet official in 
London acknowledged that the 
change in tactics was planned 
to last through the American 
elections. He said the main 
objectives were to weaken the 
Western alliance and world con-
fidence in US leadership, and 
added that Moscow realized such 
a course involved certain dan-
gers as well as advantages. He 
predicted that, after the elec-
tions, Khrushchev would take 
the "first step" back toward a 
more conciliatory policy, pos-
sibly by sending a letter of 
congratulations to the presi-
dent-elect followed by a person-
al letter explaining Soviet 
policy aims. The official also 
thought it likely that Khrushchev 
would revive the invitation for 
the next president to visit the 
USSR. 
(b)(1) 
Disarmament, Nuclear Test Talks  
Following its failure to 
gain support for a boycott of 
the UN Disarmament Commission 
meeting, the Soviet delegation 
attended the first session, and 
Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov 
used it to reiterate the stand-
ard claims and charges against 
Western disarmament policy. He 
bluntly rejected the two US pro-
posals to convert fissionable 
material to peaceful purposes 
and cease production of such, 
material for military purposes. 
Soviet tactics are appar-
ently designed to treat the 
commission session as a propa-
ganda forum for repeating famil-
iar accusations that all West-
ern proposals are aimed at secur-
ing control without actual dis-
armament. By distracting atten-
tion from the substance of the 
debate, the USSR probably hopes 
to draw support for its view 
that the General Assembly is 
the forum for serious discussion 
of disarmament. Soviet officials 
at the UN continue to hint that 
Khrushchev plans to appear be-
fore that body in September.

resolution sponsored by the 
neutral countries to include a 
reference to the heads of gov-
ernment attending the General 
Assembly. 
In the nuclear test ban 
negotiations at Geneva, the So-
viet delegation has generally 
recapitulated the Soviet posi-
tion on the quota of on-site in-
spections and the duration of 
the temporary moratorium on un-
derground tests. 
In the 16 August meeting, 
the chief Soviet delegate sought 
to demonstrate a split between 
Britain and the United States 
on the question of an inspection 
quota. He claimed that the 
British delegation was taking 
a position which conflicted 
with the approach to the quota 
taken by Prime Minister Macmillan 
during his visit to Moscow in 
February 1959. He claimed that 
the Soviet proposal for three 
on-site inspections of suspected 
nuclear tests was very close to 
the figure mentioned by Macmillan 
in his talks with Khrushchev. 
In an attempt to bring pres-
sure on the British, the Soviet 
delegate concluded with a warn-
ing that if the Western powers 
continued to insist on approach-
ing the determination of a quota 
from the scientific standpoint 
the USSR would be forced to re-
turn to its original position 
of demanding a veto over the 
dispatch of inspection teams.

CONGO 
Congolese Premier Patrice 
Lumumba continues to hold the 
initiative in the Congo crisis, 
even though his government exerts 
little control over the country 
outside of Leopoldville Prov-
ince. On one hand, Lumumba 
has moved actively to suppress 
domestic criticism and to de-
stroy the vestiges of Belgian 
political influence. At the 
same time, he is still seeking 
with strong Soviet support to 
involve the UN command in sub-
duing Katanga or to discredit 
the UN attempt to maintain a 
neutral role in internal Congo-
lese affairs. 
Lumumba's recent invoca-
tion of authoritarian measures 
to strengthen his domestic po-
sition may have been prompted 
by local opposition as well as 
provincial separatism. The 
Abako party, which had earlier 
voted no confidence in Lumumba 
and joined Katanga Premier 
Tshombe in espousing a Congolese 
confederation, was raided last 
week by Lumumba's police, and 
sufficient pressure was brought 
to bear so that the Abako post-
poned a convention scheduled for 
13 August. The party reportedly 
was to have declared the lower 
Congo region independent of the 
central government. The Abako 
was further neutralized as a 
focal point for opposition senti-
ment when Lumumba pressed Con-
golese President Kasavubu, who 
is also the head of Abako, into 
making a radio appeal for na-
tional unity. 
Successful in checking 
the Abako, Lumumba has moved 
ahead with more formal "emer-
gency" measures to bolster his

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
while permitting their entry, 
however, Premier Tshombe in-
sisted on the "independence" 
of his province, and succeeded 
in obtaining from UN Secretary 
General Hammarskjold assurances 
that the UN would not interfere 
with his "internal" dispute with 
Lumumba concerning the political 
status of Katanga. Although 
Tshombe"strongly criticized 
the Belgians for yielding 
their security function in Ka-
tanga, he continues to rely on 
Belgian advisers. 
Lumumba's charges against 
Hammarskjold�which he followed 
on 17 August with an ultimatum 
to the Security Council to pro-
vide a "satisfactory" solution 
in Katanga within a week---sug-
gest that he may be seeking a 
total UN withdrawal from the 
Congo. Lumumba has used the 
period of the UN occupation to 
build up a police force loyal 
to himself; he may feel that 
if the UN is unwilling to in-
vade Katanga on his behalf it 
is no. longer of use to him. 
Hammarskjold has indicated that 
the UN command can remain in the 
Congo only as long as it is ac-
ceptable to the host government, 
and has added that if non-Afri-
can troops are withdrawn on 
Lumumba's behest he will recom-
mend the withdrawal of the en-
tire UN force. According to 
the American army attach�n Leo-
poldville, UN officers believe 
Lumumba is attempting to pro-
voke incidents between UN and 
Congolese troops. 
The Congolese forces on 
which Lumumba can rely still 
appear limited, however, par-
ticularly in view of what the 
Katanga re ime is believe 
possess 
(b)(1) 
Tshombe, with benefit of 
substantial "technical assist-
ance" from local Belgians, is 
believed to control about 
2,000 troops of the former 
Force Publique organized into 
four battalions. The Katanga 
regime has also recruited some 
2,000 "warriors"--with no 
previous military experience--
but the whole force is said to 
be well armed and equipped with 
transport. in addition, some 
250 automatic rifles and ammuni-
tion have been igsued totribal 
chiefs--the class from which 
Tshombe himself comes--to "help 
defend Katanga," presumably 
against internal as well as 
external "enemies." Under 
these circumstances, Lumumba will 
clearly be looking for both 
diplomatic and material support 
outside the Congo if he really ex-
pects to move against Tshombe soon. 
Soviet Attitude  
Lumumba's firmest outside 
supporter at the moment is the 
USSR. Soviet Deputy Foreign 
Minister Kuznetsov on 17 August 
Officially protested Hammarskjold's 
"personal" interpretation of the 
Security Council resolutions, al-
though there was no form(b)(1)>-
viet protest.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
In line with its sustained 
attempts to stimulate distrust 
of Hammarskjold's motives and 
UN moves, Moscow radio on 15 
August noted that the Congolese 
might have to "dispense with the 
services" of the UN since it 
"cannot or will not take reso-
lute action to restore order." 
The USSR appears to be preparing 
the groundwork for a demand--
in collaboration with Lumumba--
for withdrawal of UN forces 
from the area, anticipating sup-
port for such a demand from 
African countries, particularly 
Guinea and Ghana. 
The USSR, continuing to 
circumvent UN channels, has 
provided direct aid to the Con-
golese Government in the form 
of food, medical aid, 15 to 20 
specialists, and one transport  
aircraft./ 
African Support  
Among the other African 
states, Guinea is the only one 
which almost certainly will 
give Lumumba full and unequivocal 
support, although the Congolese 
premier can also expect a 
strongly sympathetic reaction 
from the UAR. 
Ghanaian President Nkrumah, 
who last week posed publicly 
as a Lumumba champion, seems 
to have become more cautious. 
He informed a British official 
on 13 August that his offer to 
send troops to help Lumumba in-
vade Katanga was no longer 
operative and that it had only 
been made as a political ma-
neuver. In a statement on his 
Congo policy on 17 August, Nkrumah 
dodged the issue of whether he 
supported Hammarskjold's or Lu-
mumba's interpretation of the 
Security Council resolutions, 
although he did urge that UN 
troops in the Congo be predomi-
nantly African as a measure of 
psychological assurance to the 
Congolese that their country 
was not again being broug0X1) 
under European control. How-
ever, Nkrumah also said he 
might visit Katanga and Tshombe 
if he thought such a move would 
serve a useful purpose. 
Lumumba's delegation en 
route to the UN Security Coun-
cil meeting stopped off in 
Accra to seek str 
Ghanaian support. 
LAOS 
General Phoumi and the bulk 
of the Somsanith government, 
which resigned on 14 August, 
refuse to recognize the author-
ity of the new Souvanna Phouma 
government in Vientiane and are 
mustering forces for an assault 
on the city, still held by 
Captain Kong Le's 2nd Para-
chute Battalion. Phoumi seems 
to command the loyalty of most 
(b)(3) 
of the armed forces outside 
Vientiane, but this loyalty may 
become strained unless his des-
perate financial and supply posi-
tion is eased. The Souvanna re-
gime would seem to have a fairly 
good claim to legality, although 
the final step required by the 
constitution�administration of 
the oath of office by the King--
has not yet occurred.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 AUgiast 1960 
King Savang is at his pal-
ace in Luang Prabang, effective-
ly sealed off from the Vientiane 
regime, and the Phoumi forces 
can be expected to attempt to 
prevent him from giving his 
final stamp of approval. 
Savang's position in the 
current crisis is characteris-
tically obscure. While he is 
probably sympathetic to Phoumi 
and is known to consider the 
Souvanna regime unsuitable, he 
appears anxious to take an offi-
cial stance of neutrality so as 
not to jeopardize the crown. 
Should it become apparent to 
Savang that arted conflict might 
ensue, he might intervene in the 
crisis. He is probably the only 
figure at this stage who can 
bring the opposing forces to-
gether for negotiations. 
Phoumi is doubtless aware 
of the kisks involved in an 
assault on Vientiane, And may 
hope that a war of maneuver 
will impel Vientiane into nego-
tiations which would enable 
SE 
him to salvage at least some 
of what he lost as the result 
of the Kong Le coup. There is 
good reason to believe, how-
ever, that if negotiations fail, 
Phoumi has sufficient deter-
mination to go ahead with an 
attack. 
The now Souvanna re-
gime IS. making desperate ef-
forts to attract armed-forces 
support away from Phoumi in the 
provinces. Shortly after the 
National Assembly confirmed his 
gOvernment, Souvanna issued an 
appeal over Vientiane radio 
urging "all parties and members 
Of armed forces" to come to 
Vientiane for talks. 
Souvanna's efforts in this 
direction will be severely ham-
pered, however, by the fact 
that Kong Le gives no sign of 
relaxing his military grip on 
Vientiane. Offers from Souvanna 
will lose much of their attrac-
tiveness so long as the Kong Le

Souvanna's government is 
mediocre and, by his own admis-
sion, destined to be short-lived 
in its present form. The most 
noteworthy appointment is that 
SE 
of Quinim Pholsena 
as interior minis-
ter. Quinim is the 
leftist leader of 
the neutralist Santi-
phab party, which 
was in alliance with 
the pro-Communist Neo 
Lao flak Sat party, 
when both groups 
were still repre-
sented in the assem-
bly. Souvanna pre-
sumably hopes to form 
a more broadly based 
coalition government, 
including some now 
supporting Phoumi, 
if he can come to an 
agreement with Phoumi. 
Kong Le, on the 
other hand, appears 
to be developing po-
litical ambitions of 
his own. He told re-
porters that Souvanna's 
government was merely 
provisional and would 
resign once "order is 
restored." He also 
stated that his Youth 
party, now apparently 
in the process of for-
mation, would be the 
only legal political 
party in Laos and that he planned 
personally to assume command of 
the armed forces. These remarks 
may have been made off the cuff 
in one of the frequent outbursts 
of emotionalism he has exhibited 
since his coup, but there is a 
danger that if the situation con-
tinues to drift or not develop 
to his satisfaction, he may oust 
Souvanna and set himself up as 
a dictator.

come to feel that his position

there is some possibility that 
he might call them in, thus ena-

struck a responsive chord with 
at least some elements of Lao-
tian opinion. Their agents may 
well have been behind some of 
the anti-Western demonstrations 
occurring in Vientiane since 
the Kong Le coup. 
Foreign Reaction  
In its propaganda the 
bloc has shown its approval of 
the general course of events 
in Laos thus far, along with 
apprehension about US intentions. 
Moscow depicts the coup as 
symptomatic of a "contagious" 
neutralism in Asia, and warns 
of US plans for "provocations" 
against Laos Communist China, 
after nearly three days' silence 
on developments in Vientiane, 
began carrying extensive re-
ports on 11 August. Premier 
Chou En-lai on 15 August voiced 
Peiping's "resolute support" 
for the Laotian "people" but 
refrained from a personal en-
dorsement of Kong Le. North 
Vietnam has announced readiness 
to establish "friendly relations" 
with Souvanna Phouma's new 
government and has cautioned 
against any action by the "ag-
gressive SEATO bloc" to aid 
counterrevolutionary moves by 
Phoumi. 
Of Laos's neighbors, Thai-
land and South Vietnam are view-
ing developments with grave 
concern, while Cambodia has 
evinced satisfaction after it 
became apparent that Kong Le 
was loyal to the monarchy. The 
Phnom Penh press, which custom-
arily reflects Sihanouk's po-
sition, now is calling the 
Kong Le coup "yet another in 
recent stunning setbacks for 
the United States" and claims 
the rebellion "reflects the deep 
aspirations for neutrality of 
the Lao people." 
Saigon has indicated consid-
erable concern over the possi-
bility that the Pathet Lao may 
exploit the present confusion 
to take action along South Viet-
nam's northeastern frontier. 
Marshal Sarit of Thailand is 
solidly behind his nephew, Phou-
mi, and has expressed disap-
pointment that the United States 
did not rush aid to the Somsanith 
government before it resigned. 
Sarit has provided Phoui with 
some covert assistance, but 
will probably hesitate to do so 
on a large scale unless the 
United States should do like-
wise. 
Although French officials 
have long favored Souvanna 
Phouma for the Laotian premier-
ship and have advocated less 
provocative policies, Paris has

liberty" and expressed the hope 
for "even stronger" Soviet-
Cuban relations. On the same 
day PASS published a Castro 
reply to an earlier Khrushchev 
letter of congratulations on the 
26thofJuly anniversary. Cas-
tro stated that Soviet "sympa-
thy puts us under still greater 
obligation to follow the path 
we have chosen.... The break-
ing of the chain of imperialist 
oppression is of tremendous sig-
nificance for the peoples of 
Latin America and for all op-
pressed peoples of the world." 
He added that Soviet solidar-
ity with Cuba is "unquestion-
able proof that the peoples 
fighting for independence are 
not alone." 
On 14 August President 
Osvaldo Dorticos, an increas-
ingly authoritative spokesman 
for the regime, told a televi-
sion audience that "there can 
be no social progress based on 
vague and romantic theories and 
the theory of representative 
democracy." He stated that 
the "false social progress" of 
the United States was based on 
"the sufferings of Latin Ameri-
cans and other peoples," and he 
attacked private'enterprise as 
the root of Cuba's econonic ills. 
The eighth national congress 
of Cuba's Popular Socialist 
(Communist) party opened on 16 
August in Havana. The congress, 
the first since 1952, originally 
had been scheduled for last month 
and apparently was rescheduled 
to coincide with the meetings of 
the OAS foreign ministers in 
Costa Rica. The presence at the 
congress of many relatively high-
level foreign Communist delega-
tions suggests a major effort to 
demonstrate international Commu-
nist solidarity with the Castro 
regime, but their presence in 
Cuba is likely to alarm other 
Latin American governments over 
Soviet intervention in the 
hemisphere. The gathering pro-
vided an opportunity for inter-
national Communist liaison and 
for the further exploitation 
of Cuba as a base for operations 
in Latin America. 
Mikhail Suslov, secretary 
of the Soviet party central com-
mittee, reportedly declined an 
invitation to attend the meet-
ing, and the USSR may be repre-
sented by Ambassador Kudryavtsev. 
The Soviet leaders may have ( '-
chosen not to send a high-rank-
ing party official in order not 
to focus attention on the USSR's 
guidance of the Cuban party 
while the OAS foreign ministers 
are discussing the dangers to 
the hemisphere of Communist pene-
tration in Cuba.

party, and Velio Spano, a mem-
ber of the Italian Communist 
party central committee, ar-
rived on 13 August. Most Latin 
American Communist parties 
probably are represented at 
the congress. 
The Cuban Government is 
continuing its policy of ex-
treme provocation against the 
US. A group of Havana attor-
neys representing owners of ex-
propriated US properties issued 
a statement on 12 August which 
declared that they could find 
no remedy in the Cuban courts 
or elsewhere for US-owned com-
panies seized by Cuba. On the 
eve of the 14 August take-over 
of the American-owned Moa Bay 
Nickel company, Cuban police 
seized the accounting records 
of the US Government - owned 
Nicaro Nickel Company, which 
were being taken to Havana for 
photostating prior to shipment 
to Washington. 
Indications of opposition 
to the Castro regime continue. 
Counterrevolutionary elements 
in the Cuban merchant marine re-
portedly will begin a campaign 
of sabotage against sugar ship-
ments to the USSR in the near 
future. Rumors are circulating 
freely in Havana that an internal 
uprising in Cuba will coincide 
with the arrival there of a Car-
ibbean-based invasion force dur-
ing the period of the foreign 
ministers' Meeting in Costa Rica. 
The American Embassy has no re-
liable information substantiat-
ing these reports, but it con-
firms the existence in Havana of 
an atmosphere of increased appre-
hension and tensions. The ar-
rest on 16 August of a number of 
Cuban naval personnel suggests 
that disaffection in the Cuban 
Navy had reached significant 
proportions. 
At the OAS foreign minis-
ters' meetings, Costa Rican Presi-
dent Echandi has been antagonized 
by the Cuban delegation's threat 
to withdraw as a protest against 
its treatment in San Jose. 
Echandi is said to have commented: 
"Let the Cubans go home if they 
want to; they are not in charge 
here." He reportedly added that, 
if Cuban Foreign Minister Roa 
wanted, the Costa Rican guards 
assigned to the Cuban delegation 
could be removed to see if there 
would be an assassination attempt 
against Roa. Further hostility 
against the Cubans may be aroused 
among Latin American delegations 
by the report of a foreign diplo-
mat in Havana that the Cuban Na-
tional Bank has sent large sums 
to various other Latin American 
countries to bribe delegates to 
the OAS meetings. 
If Cuba walks out of the OAS 
meetings, it may then demand that 
the UN Security Council resume 
consideration of the Cuban com-
plaint about US economic aggression 
which the council  rafarrad tn tha

as Trujillo wishes. The con-
tinuing reports that both 
genuine and simulated military 
coups are imminent appear to 
be having a demoralizing effect 
on Trujillo supporters. 
The American Embassy re-
ported on 5 August that several 
high-ranking air force officers 
are known to have made large 
dollar withdrawals lately, pre-
sumably believing they might 
have to flee the country. The 
new secretary of state for the 
armed forces is described by 
the American army attach�s 
nervous, probably because he 
fears Trujillo will depart sud-
denly, leaving him and his as-
sociates to face the mob--or, 
alternatively, that Trujillo 
may kill them during a fake 
coup designed to show that the 
dictatorship no longer exists. 
Some older Trujillo stal-
warts, especially those in the 
army, are irritated over recent 
appointments to key command 
posts of young officers who are 
friends of the dictator's son, 
General "Ramfis" Trujillo. Al-
though Ramfis left for Europe 
on 7 August for a visit of un-
announced duration, his influ-
ence appears to be increasing. 
Major General Fernando Sanchez, 
another of Ramfis' friends and 
a former air force chief of 
staff, was appointed army chief 
of staff early this month, and 
more recently a former aide to 
Ramfis replaced a pro-US, mod-
erate officer as deputy chief 
of staff of the navy. 
The Ramfis clique is tak-
ing an increasingly anti-US 
line. In a letter read to air 
force officers before his de-
parture, Ramfis stated that the 
United States had turned against 
his father and Fidel Castro be-
cause both attacked US business 
interests--"When those people's 
dollars and cents are touched, 
no one can shut them up." The 
embassy interpreted the letter 
to be a clear indication that 
the dictator himself intends to 
retain control and that 11003)i1) 
"to some extent at least 
pathetic to Castro." The embassy 
considers Ramfis and his friends 
are behind a new propaganda 
line that has surpassed past 
government radio and press at-
tacks on the United States in 
virulence to such a degree that 
the regime may be using Commu-
nists--the dictator has used 
them before--to furnish the 
pro-Castro and pro-Soviet ti-
rades. 
Trujillo apparently is at-
tempting to convince the United 
States that any alternative to 
his regime would be a Castro-
type government. In this ef-
fort, he has found useful the 
activities of an apparently 
pro-Castro opposition group, 
the Dominican Popular Movement 
(MPD), and has given it an un-
precedented degree of freedom 
in its attacks against the gov-
ernment. Earlier this year 
Trujillo invited MPD leader 
Maximo Lopez Molina and several 
of his followers to return from 
exile in Cuba and "guaranteed" 
"461Z'F."

that they might campaign freely 
against his regime. This month 
a few MPD leaders were arrested 
in Santiago while promoting 
their views but were ordered 
released after demonstrations 
on their behalf on 5 August by 
a crowd of students and youths 
estimated at 1,000 to 3,000. 
These tactics by the dic-
tator may, however, raise seri-
ous concern among moderate 
military elements, and even 
impel them to move against his 
regime in order to forestall a 
sweeping, Castro-type revolution. 
The uncertainties of the 
domestic situation are height-
ened by pressure against the 
regime from the first OAS 
foreign ministers' meeting, 
where Venezuela is pushing its 
charges that Trujillo was be-
hind the attempt to assassinate 
President Betancourt on 24 June.' 
Venezuela is backing its demand 
for strong anti-Dominican meas-
ures with threats to boycott 
the subsequent foreign ministers' 
meeting on the Cuban issue or 
to withdraw completely from 
the OAS and adopt unilateral--
possibly military--measures 
against the Trujillo regime. 
YUGOSLAVIA BACKS USSR IN SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE 
The Yugoslav regime has 
come out vigorously in support 
of Soviet positions in Moscow's 
dispute with Chinese Communists 
over foreign policy and ideology. 
The vehicle for a bitter de-
nunciation of Chinese policies 
was a series of six articles 
by Edvard Kardelj, the regime's 
top ideologist, in Borba, au-
thoritative, Belgrad7e7rdWi1y, 
from 12 to 16 August, that 
dealt with such issues of cur-
rent friction as "peaceful co-
existence" and the "inevitabil-
ity of war." 
Communist China is pictured 
as a Stalinist anachronism which 
is trying to assume a position 
that would give it an "ideolog-
ical and political monopoly" 
of the Communist world--including 
Yugoslavia--in order to impose 
its policies on these countries 
(b)(1) 
for its own political interests. 
Kardelj concludes that Peiping's 
policies not only sabotage the 
spread of "progressive social 
forces" but may also precipitate 
a third world war. The West's 
policy of isolating China is 
deemed the largest cause of 
Peiping's "deformed" character. 
Kardelj portrays the Soviet 
Union, on the other hand, as the 
defender of peace, claiming that 
many of its foreign and domestic 
policies contribute to a lessen-
ing of tension. 
By implication, however, 
Kardelj also criticizes some 
Soviet positions, borrowing a 
device from the Chinese Commu-
nistt, who have questioned Khru-
shchev's policies by attacking 
Yugoslav revisionism. For ex-
ample, he blasts the Chinese for 
their "ultraradical" attacks on

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
Yugoslavia's "revolution and 
its socialist development" 
which "has given its modest 
share to the development of 
present-day socialist scientific 
thought"--a charge equally ap-
plicable to Moscow. In his 
chapter "Concerning the Inevi-
tability of Armed Revolution," 
Kardelj berates the Chinese 
for desiring to force their own 
ideology and tactics on others, 
a common Yugoslav complaint 
against the Soviet Union. He 
adds that "much must still be 
done in the relations between 
socialist countries if mutual 
economic assistance is always 
to be unselfish and without 
terms"--an allusion to the can-
cellation of Soviet credits in 
Yugoslavia. 
Belgrade's support for 
Khrushchev's detente policies 
results in large part from the 
conviction that Yugoslavia can 
only lose should there be an-
other world war. Beyond this, 
however, Kardelj's articles are 
a bid to enhance Belgrade's 
prestige in the bloc as an ar-
biter of Communist ideology and 
tactics. Despite its official 
isolation from the bloc, Bel-
grade is asserting its right as 
one of the three countries that 
have had a successful revolution 
to speak out on matters of in-
ternal bloc concern. 
Kardelj's articles seem 
likely to trouble bloc-Yugoslav 
relations further. Khrushchev 
would probably prefer that Tito, 
who is termed a renegade by all 
bloc states, keep his support 
to himself. Moreover, the ar-
ticles may actually further in-
flame Sino-Soviet differences, 
since any Chinese reply will 
probably include at least im-
plied criticism of Moscow's 
"revisionism"; although Bel-
grade supports Khrushchev's 
positions, it does so on ideolog-
lcal grounds which differ in 
some aspects from Soviet formu-
lations. (b)(3) 
NEW SOVIET CONSUMER DECREE 
The Soviet decree on retail 
trade announced on 8 August, the 
third major consumer decree in 
two years; is concerned with im-
proving the quality, style, as-
sortment, and distribution of 
consumer goods, as well as with 
eliminating the worst of numer-
ous shopping inconveniences. 
Its most important provisions 
are designed to tailor the goods 
available in retail stores to 
the consumer demand. In the 
past, goods have been produced 
and distributed to individual 
retail stores under plans set 
by industrial enterprises, which 
specified sizes, colors, and 
other details with little re-
gard for the buyers' needs. 
Frequently even these assortment 
plans were sacrificed to the ful-
fillment of the output goals. 
Under the decree, the trade 
network, which presumably is more 
responsive to consumer demands, 
is to be given the principal 
voice in determining assortment. 
Future industrial-output plans 
will be approved by planning 
authorities only if in conformity 
with contracts concluded between 
the trade organizations and the 
enterprises. In turn, trade 
organizations are not allowed to 
accept goods which do not con-
form to the contract. 
Most of the other provisions 
of the decree are in the form 
of suggestions to appropriate

The number of specialty 
stores with broader selection 
of goods is to be increased. 
To save the customers' time and 
cut down on the number of sales 
people, the present practice of 
having to line up twice to com-
plete a purchase is to be elimi-
nated and the use of self-serv-

pansion of credit sales and 
increased use of advertising. 
The decree calls for an 
increase in recruitment, par-
ticularly of high-school grad-
uates, for work in domestic 
trade, presumably to raise the 
quality of service and meet the 
steadily growing needs of this 
hitherto-neglected sector of the

of its'de facto recognition of 
Israel. 
Moscow has given public 
approval in recent weeks to the 
UAR's foreign policy line. So-
viet radio propaganda to Arab 
listeners has emphasized Mos-
cow's and Cairo's common inter-
est in opposing Israeli activi-
ties and Western influence. 
Khalid Bakdash, exiled head of 
the Syrian Communist party, at-
tacked UAR policies in Syria in 
a speech at the Rumanian party 
congress in June, but the bloc 
press and radio--in contrast to 
past treatment of Bakdash's 
statements--did not publicize 
the speech. 
The USSR, starting espe-
cially with the offer in January 
to complete the Aswan High Dam, 
has also shown itself willing to 
enlarge its commitments of aid 
to the UAR. A UAR delegation 
is in Moscow discussing final 
details for Soviet aid for the 
Aswan project, which apparently 
now will total $350,000,000. 
A Syrian delegation is to 
conclude contracts in Moscow 
shortly for Soviet work on a 
Euphrates River high dam and 
other major development projects 
under the 1957 agreement pro-
viding for $150,000,000 in aid 
for Syria. This will also 
probably include construction 
of a railroad from Aleppo 
to Qasishliya in northeastern 
Syria. 
These Soviet efforts to re-
new close relations with Cairo 
have been facilitated by Nasir's 
increasing irritation with the 
United States over issued con-
nected with the Arab-Israeli 
dispute, and are meeting with 
considerable success. Cairo 
has adopted the same propaganda 
interpretation as has Moscow on 
a variety of international is-
sues, including the Congo and 
Cuban crises, the coup in Laos, 
disarmament, and the question of 
US overseas bases. 
Nasir has publicly praised 
Soviet economic aid policies, 
while criticizing the United 
States on the alleged grounds 
that it has refused to respond 
to UAR overtures for ass/t-Ince. 
In a bitter attack on tlaJAJL on 
15 August, Radio Cairo charged 
that the normal practice of the 
Western nations--"led by the 
United States"--is to use smaller 
countries for "their own insidi-
ous aims," in contrast with the 
"sincere" policy of the Soviet 
Union. (Concurred 1n(b)(3)

apparently intends to accuse the 
UAR of subversive activity and 
to propose changes in the struc-

aimed at undercutting the Nasir 
government's dominant role in 
league affairs. 
Agreement is most unlikely 
on a unified Arab position on 
the issue of creating a Pales-
tine army and "state entity." 
Although the UAR and Iraqi gov-
ernments may no longer be as 
far apart as they were on this 
matter, the Jordanians remain 
absolutely opposed to the pro-
posals of both countries. 
Nor is the UAR likely to 
be able to extract much support 
from the other Arab states for 
any meaningful strictures agains 
Iran. Nasir broke off relations 
with Iran after the Shah had 
publicly reaffirmed the long-
standing de facto relations be-
tween Iran and Israel. Iraq and 
Jordan will probably move to hea 
off UAR pressures on this subjec 
by suggesting that their moder-
ate expressions of disapproVal 
to Tehran prevented de jure 
Iranian recognition of Israel. 
The Arab League meeting 
will, however, contain some ex-
pressions of harmony and will 
probably adopt new resolutions 
supporting the governments of 
newly independent African 
states, pledging further aid 
to the provisional government 
of Algeria, and condemning 
Israel generally and its 
Jordan water diversion plans 
specifically. 
Reaction to Oil Price Cuts 
Arab governments are re-
acting strongly to Esso Export's 
9 August cut in posted prices 
for Middle East Crude oil of 
from 4 to 14 cents per barrel. 
Similar price cuts by other major 
Western-owned oil companies 
operating in the area are ex-

that UN-supervised elections 
for the purpose of reunification 
be held only in-Notth-Korea. 
Kim has proposed elections 
"without outside intervention" 
and suggested an interim North-
South federation in which a "su-
preme national committee" with 
representatives from both sides 
would meet in Pyongyang, Pan-
munjom, and Seoul. Kim suggest-
ed that through discussions a 
program for economic and cul-
tural cooperation be worked out 
so that the "economic catas-
trophe" brought about by "US 
colonial rule" in South Korea 
could be overcome. Kim also 
suggested that both North Korea 
and South Korea reduce troop 
strength to "100,000 or less." 
Implicit in his speech was . 
Pyongyang's usual insistence on 
withdrawal of all US forces 
from South Korea and the custom-
ary derogatory comparison of 
economic progress in the South 
with that above the 38th paral-
lel. 
A South Korean Democratic 
party spokesman has publicly re-
jected the North Korean proposal, 
and on 15 August acting Prime 
Minister Huh Chung termed it 
"another rehash of a worn-out 
propaganda tactic." Pyongyang 
now will feel free to exploit 
this rejection in efforts to 
make Seoul appear responsible 
for continued division of Korea. 
The North Koreans have not 
mounted a full-scale propaganda 
campaign on reunification since 
the withdrawal of Chinese Com-
munist troops in 1958. While 
the offer to discuss economic 
and cultural contacts as well 
as all-Korean elections and 
troop reduction echoes proposals 
made two years ago, Pyongyang's 
present overtures are consider-
ably more specific and are de-
signed to convey the impression 
of a novel and fresh approach. 
As in 1958, a flurry of specific 
follow-up proposals can be 
expected. 
Khrushchev, who has accepted 
an invitation to visit North 
Korea in early October, will 
probably discuss future Commu.,-
nist_policytoward the new South 
Korean regime and provide dra-
matic publicity on Pyongyang's 
proposals for a Korean settle-
ment. Although North Korean 
propaganda has depicted the in-
terim Huh Chung government as 
little improvement over the 
Rhee regime, it is probably the 
events in the South since April 
that led the Communists to re-
open the reunification question.

FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT 
A factional conflict with-
in the South Korean conserva-
tive Democratic party, which 
won an overwhelming victory in 
the parliamentary elections of 
29 July, may result in prolonged 
political instability. No par-
ty leader appears to command a 
working majority of the 179 
Democrats in the 233-seat House 
of Representatives, and the new 
government, when formed, prob-
ably will be dependent on the 
support of independents. Pro-
longed bickering and maneuver-
ing for power may stimulate 
public resentment against the 
politicians and could result in 
renewed civil disorder. 
The election on 11 August 
of Yun Bo-sun to the largely 
ceremonial post of president 
centered the intraparty strug-
gle for power on the post of 
prime minister. The lower house 
on 17 August rejected Yun's first

faction leader Kim To-yun. Kim 
failed by three votes to win 
the simple majority needed for 
his confirmation. On 18 August,

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
Yun nominated Chang Myon, titu-
lar chief of the party and Kim's 
chief rival, to be prime minis-
ter. Chang, however, appears 
to control slightly less than 
half the Democratic membership 
in the House. 
Under the constitution, re-
jection of the President's sec-
ond nominee leaves the lower 
house solely responsible for 
choosing the prime minister. 
The struggle over the premier-
ship suggests that the position 
of the new government--which is 
subject to a simple majority of 
the lower house--will be tenu-
ous. Should it lose a vote of 
confidence, the prime minister 
would have the choice of either 
resigning with his cabinet or 
dissolving the chamber and call-
ing new national elections. A 
deterrent influence will be the 
reluctance of members of the 
House to face frequent elections. 
The military has been a 
major stabilizing factor in the 
domestic situation since Rhee's 
ouster. However, public dis-
illusionment could adversely af-
fect the armed forces.  
INTERNAL FRICTION THREATENING MALI FEDERATION 
Discord between Senegal 
and Soudan--the constituent 
states of the newly independent 
Federation of Mali--has recently 
intensified to such an extent 
that an early breakup of the 
federation is possible. 
The latest and most serious 
in a series of crises between 
the federal partners is the 
result of distinct differences 
of temperament and increasing 
resentment on the part of the 
Senegalese over Soudanese at-
tempts to dominate Mali. Sene-
gal has been the center of 
French culture in West Africa 
since the 17th century, and its 
moderate nationalist leadership 
has emerged in an environment 
of friendship for France. In 
contrast, Soudan has experi-
enced a much shorter period 
of contact with France and is 
governed by radical national-
ists who favor a strongly pro-
African foreign policy and con-
tacts with the Communist bloc. 
Although Soudan will probably 
be of growing political impor-
tance, it is heavily dependent 
on Senegal in economic matters. 
The Soudanese, whose top 
leader, Modibo Keita, is foreign 
minister as well as head of the 
Mali Government, have been 
placing a disproportionate num-
ber of their people in federal 
positions. They have also tried 
quite openly to induce younger 
elements in the Senegalese Gov-
ernment to work for the more 
vigorous domestic policies and 
the more aggressive, pan-African 
oriented foreign policy favored 
by Soudan. 
This friction, already re-
flected in a wrangle over the 
appointment of chief of staff 
for the Mali Army, appears to 
be building up toward a climax 
in connection with the election, 
now scheduled for 27 August, of

Democratic party may be banned 
by court action. The principal

REPERCUSSIONS IN BELGIUM OF CONGO CRISIS 
Under heavy public censure 
for ineptitude in the Congo 
crisis, Belgium's Premier Eys-
kens has responded by convening 
a special session of parliament 
on 17 August and demanding a 
vote of confidence. This move 
followed promises to make budget 
cuts--mainly on military items--
to meet anticipated losses from 
Congo operations. Eyskens will 
probably also reshuffle a few 
cabinet posts and attempt to 
work out a new financial program 
acceptable to all factions. 
Despite antithetical views 
on most domestic and political 
issues, the Social Christians 
(PSC) and the Liberals have held 
together since November 1958 
largely because of the feeling 
that national unity should be 
maintained on the Congo question. 
With this bond weakened by re-
cent developments, another attempt

may be made to form a Social 
Christian - Socialist government 
if the present coalition part-
ners cannot agree to Eyskens' 
new program. This attempt might 
even result in new elections. 
The Liberals, however, appar-
ently hope that the PSC right 
wing--strengthened by the em-
bittered ex-colonial groups--
will force the Democratic-Chris-
tian wing of the PSC to com-
promise on the new program with 
the Liberals so that essentially 
the present coalition can con-
tinue until 1962. 
While relations between 
the opposition Socialists and 
the PSC have appeared relatively 
close, and the Socialists seem 
prepared to accept office under 
another PSC premier, they would 
probably not do so unless new 
elections were held. The So-
cialists--who never supported 
major legislation on Congo 
policy--could exploit this is-
sue in an election campaign but 
may think it more expedient to 
let the Eyskens government as-
sume responsibility for Congo 
developments for the present. 
The psychological shock 
of Congo events on the Belgians 
and resentment against what they 
feel is lack of support in the 
UN by Belgium's allies--espe-
cially the United States--have 
forced Eyskens to call for a 
review of defense policies and 
announce some cuts in Belgium's 
military expenditures to balance 
anticipated losses from Congo 
operations. It is unlikely that 
Belgium, one of the strongest 
supporters of NATO in its forma-
tive years, would withdraw from 
NATO entirely. Both political 
and economic considerations, how-
ever, make some reduction in 
Belgium's NATO commitments al-
most certain.  
ADENAUER TALKS WITH DE GAULLE AND MACMILLAN 
Although complete informa-
tion is still lacking, Adenauer's 
talks with De Gaulle on 29-30 
July and with Macmillan on 10-
11 August evidently had far-
reaching implications for the 
future organization of Western 
Europe and its relations with 
the Atlantic alliance. De 
Gaulle's plans for a French-led 
confederation of Continental 
Europe were apparently the major 
subject of his talks with Ade-
nauer, but the extent to which 
the two reached agreement is 
still uncertain. Adenauer's

Outer Seven may indicate that 
he has reservations about the 
anti-British, anti-American 
overtones of the French plan. 
Fear of Khrushchev's re-
cently more aggressive posture 
and belief that the American 
presidential campaign "parilyzeW 
Washington's ability to respond 
to it may be responsible in part 
for these moves, ostensibly in-
tended to increase European 
solidarity. De Gaulle appar-
ently proposed to achieve this 
goal by offering a refurbished 
version of his concept of a 
"Europe of motherlands"--a loose 
political organization which 
would coordinate the foreign 
policies of the participating 
countries and "supervise" the 
three European communities--
the Coal-Steel Community, EURA-
TOM, and the Common Market. 
The dispute between the 
two trade groupings as an ob-
stacle to a "united front" a-
gainst Soviet pressures evi-
dently did not figure in the De 
Gaulle - Adenauer talks, but 
this seems to have been the 
major topic of the chancellor's 
meeting with Macmillan. Adenauer 
showed unusual "understanding" 
of the British position on the 
issue, and to the surprise and 
delight of Macmillan agreed to 
further consultations on how 
the "economic split"  could be 
mitigated.  / 
Adenauer's unexpected over-
ture to London on this issue 
has raised speculation that his 
heretofore unshakable support 
of the Common Market and its 
supranational basis is weakening 
under combined foreign and do-
mestic pressures. German in-
dustrial interests have long 
been alarmed over the prospec-
tive loss of markets in the 
Outer Seven, and with the 1961 
elections approaching, Adenauer 
may now be more responsive both 
to their views and to the pro-
tests of the German farm bloc 
that the community's agricul-
tural po icies will reduce farm 
es. 
Speculation has also devel-
oped that Adenauer's apparent 
desire to move closer to Brit-
ain reflects some disenchantment 
with the Bonn-Paris (en  ente

  �enauer 
may be suspicious that De 
Gaulle's new European order 
would reduce Germany to a satel-

to pave the way for a union of 
the present two groupings which 
would free him of his excessive 
reliance on De Gaulle. However, 
it is equally possible that no 
more than a tactical shift in 
Adenauer's position is involved, 
and given French opposition to 
the supranational approac(b)(1)he 
chancellor may now believe that 
he has no choice at the moment 
but to accept a confederal 
Europe which could ultimately 
develop federalist tendencies.

ments is known. A new basis

PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES 
KHRUSHCHEV'S STRATEGY ON BERLIN 
Since the breakdown of the 
summit conference, Communist 
tactics on the Berlin issue have 
been gradually brought into line 
with the more aggressive posture 
toward the West adopted by Khru-
shchev. Following an initial 
period of reassuring gestures by 
Moscow, the bloc has mounted an 
extensive psychological warfare 
operation apparently designed 
to focus public attention on the 
dangerous aspects of the Berlin 
situation and to dispel any no-
tion in the West that Moscow has 
retreated from its basic demands 
on the Berlin and German treaty 
questions. 
The dominant element in 
this campaign remains the threat 
to conclude a separate peace 
treaty with East Germany, fol-
lowed by East German assumption 
of access controls to Berlin. 
Public warnings to this effect 
by Khrushchev, although still 
imprecise as to manner and tim-
ing, have been buttressed by 
threats voiced in private to 
Western officials and by an in-
tensified effort to create a 
state of anxiety and uncertainty 
in West Berlin, weaken its ties 
with Bonn, and generate dissen-
sion among the Western allies. 
Early Post-Summit Tactics 
The violence of Khrushchev's 
performance in Paris, his off-
hand comments to the press there 
about a separate peace treaty 
with East Germany, and the an-
nouncement of a stopover in Ber-
lin caused widespread specula-
tion that he would follow 
through on his frequent pre-
summit threats to take unilat-
eral action and force a show-
down on Berlin. Almost imme-
diately, however, Foreign Min-
ister Gromyko attempted in pri-
vate to allay Western apprehen-
sions. He informed British 
Foreign Secretary Lloyd that 
the USSR would do nothing to 
worsen the situation during the 
six to eight months envisaged 
by Khrushchev before a new sum-
mit. In the atmosphere of height-
ened tensions, Khrushchev also 
probably felt compelled to spell 
out his position as soon as pos-
sible. 
To the visible displeasure 
and astonishment of most of his 
audience at East Berlin, Khru-
shchev in his speech there on 
20 May counseled patience and 
forbearance on a separate treaty. 
Asserting the bloc's "moral 
right" to proceed without delay, 
ho nevertheless held out hope 
ULBRICHT AND KHRUSHCHEV 
for a new summit meeting and 
stated, "In these conditions it 
makes sense to wait a little 
and to try, by joint efforts of 
all the victorious powers, to 
find a solution to the questions." 
More categorically, Khrushchev 
declared that the existing sit-
uation would have to be main-
tained until a new meeting, 
"which, it should be assumed, 
will take place in six to eight 
months." 
As a condition to this 
pledge, however, the Soviet 
leader added that the Western 
powers would have to adhere to 
the same principles and take no 
unilateral steps which would 
prevent a meeting of the heads

18 AUGUST 196C: 
A 
In the foreign policy re-
view which undoubtedly took 
place in the Kremlin, the So-
viet leaders probably realized 
that agreement to maintain the 
Status quo for six to eight 
months could deprive Soviet 
policy of a means of pressure to 
ensure continuing Western in-
terest in negotiating a Berlin 
settlement. They may also have 
been concerned over increasing 
Western speculation that Khru-
shchev's torpedoing of the sum-
mit was designed to cover a 
retreat on Berlin. 
To counter any such im-
pression, Khrushchev used a 
press conference on 3 June to 
warn that the Western powers 
should not delude themselves 
into believing that if they de-
layed a summit meeting,a solution 
of the Berlin and German ques-
tions would be "indefinitely 
postponed." He stated that at 
the end of the six- to eight-
month period, "we shall meet, 
discuss, and sign a treaty" giv-
ing the East dermans full con-
trol over access to Berlin. In 
effect, Khrushchev attempted to 
put a new US administration on 
notice that it must be amenable 
to negotiations on Berlin or 
face a new and dangerous crisis. 
The New Phase 
As the more militant cam-
paign against the United States 
gained momentum, Communist tac-
tics on the Berlin question 
were considerably sharpened. 
The East Germans have used a 
wide variety of means to create 
a state of anxiety and uncer-
tainty. The principal targets 
for harassment have been the 
Allied Military Liaison Missions 
in East Germany, whose person-
nel have been physically as-
saulted, closely watched,

restricted in their travel, and 
subjected to insulting and ir-
ritating incidents. The East 
Germans have also pointed up 
the vulnerability of West Ger-
man access to Berlin by detain-
ing West German trucks and 
warning against "misuse" of 
the roads and air corridors. 
The new moves have been 
undertaken against a background 
of East German claims to sov-
ereignty over West Berlin and 
repeated assertions that the 
Allies have forfeited all 
rights through violation of 
the Potsdam agreements. 
The bloc has also ini-
tiated a series of moves on the 
diplomatic level. Both the So-
viet and East German regimes 
have dispatched notes protest-
ing against alleged recruitment 
in Berlin of personnel for the 
West German armed forces and 
against West German plans to 
establish a radio station in 
West Berlin. Warsaw has chal-
lenged the NATO powers to ex-
plain any commitments given 
Adenauer on recovering terri-
tories beyond the Oder-Neisse 
line, and the Czechs have gen-
erally echoed East German state-
ments and protests. 
The East German leaders 
have reportedly made plans for 
a wide variety of actions rang-
ing from mass disturbances to 
an outright coup if the Kremlin 
decides to force a showdown. In 
an apparent effort to capitalize 
on the physical vulnerability 
of the city, East German offi. 
cials have planted reports that 
drastic measures will be under-
taken and have publicly spec-
ulated that some move will be 
made "when the lilac and chest-
nut trees bloom." 
During the meeting of bloc 
leaders in late June at Bucha-
rest, Ulbricht is reported to 
have pressed Khrushchev for a 
commitment to definite action 
against Berlin. Vague hints 
of future action are probably 
designed to recoup the prestige 
which the East German leaders 
have lost and to distract at-
tention from serious internal 
problems. They may also be try-
ing to bolster the sagging mo-
rale of the rank-and-file Com-
munists who had expected more 
action from Khrushchev after 
the summit. 
Bundestag Meeting in Berlin  
The most serious threat of 
action in the immediate future 
came from Khrushchev during his 
visit to Austria. In reply to 
a planted question in his final 
press conference on 8 July, 
Khrushchev warned that if Bonn 
held its annual session of the 
Bundestag in Berlin this fall, 
"perhaps at the same time a 
peace treaty will be signed 
with East Germany, and thus all 
Bundestag deputies will have to 
obtain visas from (East German 
Premier)Grotewohl to be able to 
leave Berlin for Bonn." 
(b)(1) 
Khrushchev probably seized 
on this issue to test the unity 
and firmness of Western reac-
tion. Realizing the differences 
which developed among the Allies, 
Bonn, and Berlin when a similar 
situation arose in 1959 over 
holding the West German pres-
idential elections in Berlin, 
Khrushchev probably anticipated 
that the issue would again prove 
divisive and provide Moscow with 
some indication of Allied policy 
in the event of a showdown on a 
separate treaty. As in the past,

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
however, Khrushchev has been 
careful to avoid committing 
himself irrevocably in the e-
vent the meeting is held. This 
issue could be used as a pre-
text for unilateral action, how-
ever, should Moscow decide to 
seek a showdown rather than 
await new negotiations. 
Widespread Western specu-
lation that the bloc was moving 
toward some overt action con-
cerning Berlin was probably re-
sponsible for Khrushchev's re-
affirmation--in a letter on 
4 August replying to one from 
Prime Minister Macmillan--of 
his qualified commitment to 
maintain the status quo pend-
ing a new attempt to negotiate 
t the summit. Since Macmillan 
did not raise the issue in his 
own letter, Khrushchev appears 
to have gone out of his way to 
restate his position, including 
another warning that if the 
West refused to meet or prevented 
agreement, the USSR would "em-
bark on the conclusion of a 
peace treaty" with East Germany. 
Should Khrushchev decide 
that his political and diplo-
matic campaign is failing to 
generate sufficient pressure on 
the West, he could instruct the 
East Germans to provoke further 
incidents and serious disturb-
ances to underline his claim 
that the West Berlin situation 
could "give rise to dangerous 
accidents." The East German 
regime can call on some 6,000 
Communists already living in 
the Western sectors and can 
rapidly infiltrate, if need be, 
12,000 to 16,000 members of the 
specially trained workers' mil-
itia (Kampfgruppen). Last Oc-
tober 1,000 to 5,000 Kampfgrup-
pen members were brought over 
during the riots over the dis-
play of the new East German flag 
on the Berlin elevated railway, 
which is controlled by the East 
Germans. 
Outlook 
In the current phase of 
Moscow's policy, Berlin remains 
the test case of whether the So-
viet leaders intend to pass 
from bullying behavior to ac-
tions involving grave risks. 
Khrushchev's handling of the is-
sue thus far suggests that he 
continues to realize the danger 
of resorting to unilateral ac-
tion to advance his objectives, 
and that he is in no hurry to 
implement his threats. Since 
the opening of the Berlin crisis 
in November 1958, the Kremlin has 
consistently employed the threat 
of a transfer of Berlin access 
controls as a pressure tactic to 
force negotiations and extract 
concessions. Since the lapse of 
the initial six-month ultimatum, 
Khrushchev has been careful to 
avoid committing the USSR to a 
specific time for a separate 
treaty. 
Khrushchev's long and close 
personal identification with the 
issue, however, is a compelling 
reason for him to crown his two-
year campaign on Berlin with 
some significant advance which 
would justify his past policies 
and demonstrate their continuing 
validity. The achievement of 
some gain by means of negotia-
tion, preferably at the summit, 
probably has taken on a new sig-
nificance for him in the face of 
continuing Chinese Communist 
criticism of both his methods 
and his strategy in dealing with 
the West. 
Post-summit statements by 
Khrushchev and other Communist 
leaders suggest that the Krem-
lin may feel that insufficient 
effort was devoted to propaganda 
and agitation to build up pres-
sure prior to the Paris meeting. 
That the Kremlin does not in-
tend to make a similar error was 
recently evident in Pravda's 
republication of Italian Commu-
nist leader Togliatti's remarks:

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
"While it apPeared before thatthe 
leaders of all the Western pow-
ers, with the exception of Ade-
nauer's Germany, realized the 
need for a summit conference, 
it now suddenly became impos-
sible. Consequently a new 
struggle is required for creat-
ing conditions for convening a 
summit conference and its ef-
fective work. New public pres-
sure upon the governments of 
main capitalist countries is 
essential...." 
With negotiations tempo-
rarily in abeyance, Communist 
tactics will probably continue 
to reflect Togliatti's call for 
struggle and pressure. 
Despite Khrushchev's appar-
ent intention to hold open the 
possibility for new negotiations, 
a long and bitter anti-Western 
campaign will have the effect 
of erecting barriers against an 
attempt to work back toward the 
conference table. Khrushchev may 
well overestimate the ease and 
speed with which he can shift 
gears. While Moscow probably 
continues to prefer a further 
round of negotiations as a neces-
sary prelude to a separate trea-
ty, the day of decision cannot 
be postponed indefinitely with-
out a substantial loss of pres-
tige for Khrushchev in the eyes 
of his bloc and Chinese col-
leagues. 
In anticipation of renewed 
diplomatic pressure to force 
negotiations in the spring of 
1961, the campaign of harass-
ments, probing actions, and po-
litical warfare can be expected 
to intensify. 
CYPRUS BECOMES INDEPENDENT 
Cyprus became independent 
on 16 August when the British 
ended their 82-year rule of the 
island by transferring sover-
eignty to the new republican 
government. The republic be-
gins with better prospects for 
economic and political stabil-
ity than many other recently 
independent colonial areas de-
spite a legacy of hatred be-
tween the Greek and Turkish 
communities, apathy toward the 
Cyprus settlement on the part 
of most Greek Cypriots, and an 
apparent splintering of the is-
land's only large non-Communist 
party on the eve of independ-
ence. Economic aid totaling 
more than $40,000,000 has been 
promised by Britain over the 
next five years, other aid can 
be expected from Greece and 
Turkey, and the United States 
has offered technical assist-
ance. 
The complexity of the po-
litical settlement encompassed 
in the Cyprus Agreement will 
make it possible for leaders 
of either the Greek or the 
Turkish community to bring the 
process of government to a vir-
tual standstill at any time. 
Present leaders of both com-
munities, however, have dem-
onstrated a willingness to 
compromise on fundamental is-
sues. There are still extreme 
nationalists adamantly opposed 
to the settlement--particularly 
among the Greek Cypriots--but 
their numbers do not appear 
large at this time and their 
leadership is of questionable 
ability.

18 August 1960 
anti-Communist leaders fail to 
resolve the anticipated eco-
nomic and political problems, 
the Communists will probably 
make a serious bid for control 
of the government in the next 
general elections, scheduled 
for 1965. 
Government 
The Cyprus Agreement of 
February 1959 is the basis for 
the present government and its 
international relations. This 
agreement called for a govern-
ment in which effective control 
would be exercised by the Greek 
Cypriots--who make up about 80 
percent of the population--but 
contained guarantees to protect 
the Turkish Cypriot minority. 
The agreement provides that 
the president is to be a Greek 
Cypriot, the vice president a 
Turkish Cypriot. Each has the 
right of veto on matters involv-
ing foreign affairs, defense, 
or security. In December 1959, 
Greek Orthodox Archbishop Makari-
os, who has consistently dom-
inated Greek Cypriot political 
activity, was elected President, 
over the combined opposition of 
disgruntled nationalists and 
Communists. Dr. Fazil Kuchuk, 
long-time leader of the Turkish 
Cypriots, won the vice-presi-
dency without opposition. 
The president and vice 
president appoint the cabinet, 
the president appointing seven 
members and the vice president 
three. Other government posts 
are to be divided between the 
communities on the same general 
70-30 ratio--a concession to the 
Turkish Cypriots, giving them a 
greater voice than their pro-
portion of the population would 
call for. The civil service, 
police, and gendarmerie will be 
divided in this proportion, while 
the 2,000-man army will be cre-
ated on a 60-40 ratio.. In, the 
House of Representatives, there 
are 35 Greek Cypriots and 15 
Turkish Cypriots. 
The dichotomy in the Cypriot 
government is most apparent in 
the existence of two entirely 
separate Communal Chambers with 
sole responsibility for legis-
lating on community affairs, 
such as education, so-
cial welfare, and re-
ligion. Moreover, 
separate municipal 
governments for Turk-
ish Cypriots will be 
established in the 
five largest cities. 
The Supreme Con-
stitutional Court, 
which decides conflicts 
of jurisdiction between 
branches of the govern-
ment, is composed of , 
one Greek and one Turk-
ish Cypriot and a neu-
tral president, a po-
sition recently offered 
to a West German. A 
High Court of Justice deals with 
appointments, transfer, and pro-
motion of judges and consists of 
two Greeks, one Turk, and a neu-
tral president with two votes; 
the Irish Government has been 
requested to select a suitable 
judge for this post. The ju-
dicial system as a whole is ad-
ministered on the basis of the 
communal principle. 
Politics 
Markarios' political party, 
the Patriotic Front, is a het-
erogeneous mixture of basically 
conservative elements which prob-
ably will fragment into several 
smaller parties following inde-
pendence. Resignation of an in-
terim cabinet minister and: a

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
controversy over the naming of 
a foreign minister--both occur-
ring on the eve of independence--
indicate that the party is pres-
ently subjected to conflicting 
internal pressures. 
Some opposition to Makarios 
has come from older politicians 
who were not selected for top 
government posts. These men, 
led by John Clerides and The-
mistocles Dervis, tried without 
success to prevent Makarios' 
election as president. Their 
political party, the Democratic 
Union, continues to denounce 
the Cyprus Agreement and the 
archbishop but appears to have 
little popular support. 
Potentially more dangerous 
to tranquillity on the island 
has been the opposition of for-
mer members of EOKA, the under-
ground organization that fought 
the British from 1955 to 1959. 
While many senior EOKA leaders 
have joined the Patriotic Front 
and several are members of the 
cabinet,others oppose the Cyprus 
settlement as failing to achieve 
the goal for which EOKA fought--
"enosis," or union of Cyprus 
with Greece. A spokesman for 
such extreme nationalists in the 
past has been Makarios' nominal 
subordinate within the church 
hierarchy, Bishop Kyprianos of 
Kyrenia. 
In Athens, former EOKA lead-
er George Grivas has criticized 
the concessions made to the Brit-
ish in negotiating the terms for 
implementing the Cyprus Agree-
ment. However, his recent an-
nouncement that he intends to 
enter Greek politics appears to 
preclude an open campaign 
against Makarios at this time. 
The Communists on Cyprus--
nearly all of whom are Greek 
Cypriots--control the Reform 
Party of the Working People 
(AKEL). AKEL captured about 40 
percent of the Greek Cypriot 
popular vote in the legislative 
elections on 31 July, partly 
because of widespread absten-
tions by disgruntled national-
ists. However, AKEL holds only 
five of the Greek Cypriot seats 
in the 50-member House of Rep-
resentatives, by provisions of 
an electoral agreement with the 
Patriotic Front, which holds the 
remaining 30. Under a similar 
agreement regarding elections to 
the Greek Communal Chamber, AKEL 
received three of the 26 seats. 
Makarios negotiated these 
agreements in the hope of pre-
venting a vicious electoral bat-
tle on the eve' of independence 
and they were accepted by the 
Communists, who recognized that 
the electoral law gave them lit-
tle chance of winning any seats 
in open contests with the Patri-
otic Front. This collaboration 
was only for the election, how-
ever, and AKEL spokesmen have al-
ready indicated that they will 
vigorously oppose implementation 
of certain provisions of the Cy-
prus Agreement. They are concen-
trating attacks on the continued 
presence of British military 
bases on Cyprus and the need to 
"denuclearize" the island. AKEL 
leaders have visited Moscow and 
Peiping in recent months, bring-
ing back offers of increased 
trade and economic aid "without 
strings"--offers which will be-
come increasingly attractive un-
less present large-scale unem-
ployment on the island is re-
duced in the near future. 
The Communists can also be 
expected to advocate programs 
of social and economic reform, 
particularly land reform. Such 
a move would present Makarios 
with difficult decisions, because 
the Orthodox Church controls 
more than one sixth of the arable 
land on the island. 
The Communists' major source 
of strength continues to be their 
domination of the largest labor 
federation on Cyprus, the 40,000-
member Pan-Cyprian Federation of 
Labor (PEO). The nationalist la-
bor organization�approximately 
one fourth the size of the PEO--
suffers from inadequate leader-
ship and confused programs. 
The dependence of the Turk-
ish Cypriots on Ankara for guid-
ance and support has always been 
far greater than that of the 
Greek Cypriots on Athens. Until

18 August 1960 
the Turkish Cypriots appeared 
united under the leadership of 
Kuchuk. Because he was closely 
associated with the ousted re-
gime of Turkish Premier Menderes, 
his opponents hoped that the 
new government in Ankara would 
select other leaders for the 
Turkish community, and rumors 
are circulating in Nicosia that 
Ankara will eventually replace 
Kuchuk. Opposition elements 
within the Turkish community 
presented several candidates 
for the 15 Turkish Cypriot seats 
in the House of Representatives 
in the July 1960 elections, but 
only Kuchuk-supported nominees 
were elected. 
Foreign Relations 
For the present, Cyprus 
will maintain only four em-
bassies abroad--in London, Ath-
ens, Ankara, and Washington. 
The government is expected to 
apply for admission to the 
United Nations but not to NATO. 
Cyprus is allied with Greece 
and Turkey by a treaty providing 
for consultation on Cypriot de-
fense problems and obligating 
the parties to resist "all in-
direct and direct aggression" 
against the new state. A

tripartite headquarters has been

contributing 950 officers and

training the new Cypriot Army. 
In another treaty with 
Britain, Greece, and Turkey, 
Cyprus has undertaken to "en-
sure the maintenance of its 
independence, territorial in-
tegrity, and security." In a 
document signed in early July 
1960, the location and future 
of two military bases over which 
London is to maintain sovereignty 
and of several smaller sites to 
be used as training areas by the 
British are spelled out. Nego-
tiations over the size and fu-
ture of these bases caused post-
ponement of Cypriot independence 
from February to August 1960. 
Eventual agreement was reached 
on approximately 100 square miles 
for the bases and on provisions 
for cession of the bases to the 
Cypriot Government if the Brit-
ish ever abandon them. 
Relations with London will, 
of necessity, remain close for 
many years. Cyprus can expect 
considerable economic benefit 
from the presence of British 
troops on the island, and hopes 
to stimulate British tourism.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
The new republic will remain in 
the sterling bloc for the indef-
inite future and will probably 
seek to remain in the Common-
wealth. 
Relations with the United 
States will also be close, with 
technical aid already promised 
by Washington and the Cypriots 
hopeful for eventual economic 
and military aid. 
Amer-
icans also operate the largest 
mining enterprise on the is-
land--the Cyprus Mines Corpora-
tion--which produces copper ore, 
the island's most important 
source of foreign exchange. 
While relations between 
Cyprus and its Near Eastern 
neighbors are expected to be 
generally good, the govern-
ment will be faced with del-
icate decisions in its attitude 
toward Israel. The Arab states 
supported the Cypriot cause in 
the UN debates, are a natural 
market for Cypriot agricultural 
products, and are the home of 
some 10,000 Cypriots--most of 
whom live in the UAR. Israel, 
however, also seeks good rela-
tions with Cyprus, and has prom-
ised technical aid to the new 
republic. Cypriot leaders indi-

Communist bloc countries 
have demonstrated some interest 
in the emerging nation and will 
probably devote more attention to 
Cyprus in the future. Both the 
USSR and Communist China have an-
nounced their willingness to 
grant financial and technical 
assistance, and trade with the 
bloc--about 4 percent of total 
trade in 1959--appears likely to 
be doubled in 1960. The bloc's 
propaganda, backing the campaign 
of local Communists, has already 
begun to focus on the British 
bases on Cyprus and the danger 
to which the Cypriot population 
is exposed by their presence.

18 August 1960 
UNREST CONTINUES AMONG SOVIET ARTISTS 
Although the revolt on the 
literary front in 1956 and 1957 
has largely subsided, a spirit 
of unorthodoxy continues in So-
viet art. In an atmosphere 
which, despite the stiffened 
attitude of the regime since 
the uprising in Hungary, is 
still considerably less re-
pressive than in Stalin's last 
years, modern art has gained an 
enthusiastic following among 
the Soviet intelligentsia which 
increasingly threatens to un-
dermine the sternly guarded 
principle of "socialist real-
ism" in art. 
The growing interest in 
experimentation, stimulated by 
officially sanctioned displays 
of foreign art, is reflected 
in the existence of a thriving 
"underground" in such condemned 
styles as abstractionism and 
surrealism. One advocate of 
the party line has described 
the attitude of some artists 
as "a kind of diseased, mys-
terious 'internal spirit,' as 
if the person did not live in 
Moscow but somewhere in an un-
derground kingdom." The re-
gime has offered repeated re-
assurances against the rein-
stitution of a harsh policy, 
but it is seeking through a 
cautious broadening of the def-
inition of "socialist realism"

means to neutralize the spirit 
of noncomformity and preserve 
the propagandistic function of 
Soviet art. 
"Socialist Realism" 
The extreme modern art 
schools which flourished in Rus-
sia in the early 1900s and for 
a time after 1917 were emphati-
cally tabooed by the 1932 party 
central committee decree which 
called for the creation of na-
tional unions of artists, writ-
ers, and musicians and pro-
claimed "socialist realism" the 
only artistic method permissible. 
Modernist masterpieces were 
locked in storage vaults where, 
with few exceptions, they re-
main to this day. 
Socialist realism insisted 
on the style of 19th century 
Russian realism but demanded 
that content show society not 
as it actually was but as it 
was seen to be developing 
through the rose-colored glasses 
of Communist dogma. The value 
of art was judged in terms of 
its propaganda effectiveness 
Serov, "Lenin Receives Peasant Delegates'' 
Zverev (self-portrait) 
rather than by esthetic criteria. 
Socialist realist art was to use 
a realistic style clearly under-
stood by the masses, avoid un-
pleasant actualities, 
and dramatize heroic 
Communist exploits. 
Formalism, or a 
concern for form at 
the expense of con-
tent, was made the 
cardinal sin for So-
viet artists. The 
opposite extreme--
mechanical copying of 
details--was condemned 
as naturalism. Modern 
Western art from the 
1370s onward was de-
nounced as "bourgeois" 
"reactionary," "de-
cadent," or "subjec-
tive," because it 
rejected the primacy 
of social idea-con-
tent in favor of ex-
perimentation in form 
as a means of express-
ing the artist's sub-
jedtive thought.

which developed after Stalin's 
death, Ilya Ehrenburg's 1954 
novel The Thaw attacked the 
careerTgE,�gtWrility, and pres-
sures for conformity in the 
Soviet art world. 
Beginning in 1955 the works 
of some previously condemned 
artists began to reappear, in-
cluding works by members of the 
early 1900s modernist "World of 
Art" group. The Hermitage 
Museum in Leningrad and the 
Pushkin Museum in Moscow put on 
permanent exhibition selected 
works by French impressionists, 
Matisse, Cezanne, and Picasso. 
But works by the great Russian 
modernists Kandinsky, Chagall, 
and Malevich remain in storage. 
One result of Khrushchev's 
anti-Stalin speech in February 
1956 was a rash of articles di-
rectly critical of prevailing 
artistic standards. An art un-
ion official attacked "the anti-
democratic style of leadership 
in art (which) is incompatible 
with free creative competition." 
An art historian praised non-
conformist artists of the 1920s, 
rejected as "mass produced" 
most works since the 1930s, and 
defended impressionism as a 
valuable variant of realism. 
The First Congress of the 
USSR Union of Artists, held in 
March 1957, warned artists 
against disparaging socialist 
realism. Vigorous reaffirma-
tion of party guidance of the 
arts was balanced, however, by 
clear signals that there would 
be no return to Stalin's cul-
tural wasteland. While abstrac-
tionism was again condemned, 
party advocates also criticized 
shallow, prompous, naturalistic, 
and purely illustrative art. 
The replacement, prior to the 
congress, of the Stalin-ap-
pointed watchdog Aleksandr 
Gerasimov by moderate Boris 
Ioganson as head of the Academy 
of Arts was also seen as a ges-
ture in the direction of reduced 
administrative dictatorship over 
the arts. 
Private Network of Modern Art 
The more permissive cul-
tural atmosphere since 1955 has 
gradually encouraged more and 
more artists to venture outside 
the limits of socialist realism. 
They are handicapped by their 
comparative ignorance of West-
ern developments and the limita-
tions of their national tradi-
tion. But many of the younger 
generation, often with the en-
couragement of established fig-
ures in the Soviet art world, 
are clearly fighting for the 
right to create new forms. 
These, they argue--seeking, per-
haps cynically, td, cite the Com-
tunist gospel in support of 
their own heresies--are neces-
sary to express the neW condi-
tions of the "period of Commu-
nist construction" and the 
space age. 
Landscapes, portraits, and 
still lifes, forms which are 
poor vehicles for social preach-
ing, have become the most pop-
ular genres. Some artists have 
been accused of "salonism" be-
cause of their concentration on 
personalized themes. Ilya 
Glazunov's bold reintroduction 
of the nude to Soviet painting 
at his small Moscow exhibit in 
early 1957 was cheered by all 
but a few "loyalists" and 
puritans. 
The Soviet rediscovery of 
Matisse, Cezanne, Van Gogh, and 
Picasso, and of older Slavic 
art, especially the icon, has 
encouraged the use of dynamic 
rhythms, bold colors, and a 
flat decorative style foreign 
to conventional Soviet artistic 
expression. 
The regime's continued 
repudiation of any real experi-
mentation has given rise to a 
flourishing art "underground" 
lying just beneath the surface 
of official Soviet life. Sur-
realism and abstractionism are 
the most popular trends. More 
and more members of the intel-
ligentsia--including party

members and art union officials 
young and old--are collecting 
modern art or enjoying it in the 
privacy of friends' apartments 
or studios. Some black market-
eers are apparently making for-
tunes selling modern art. 
An increasing number of 
artists who produce convention-
al works for public consumption 
experiment in private. Glazunov 
paints excellent unorthodox 
portraits on the side. "These 
are my soldiers," he explained 
to a visiting American art ex-
pert in 1959. "Some day there 
must be art again in the USSR." 
Another artist who has won fame 
and luxury designing stage sets 
continues to paint nonconformist 
romantic works in private. Many 
engineers and professional peo-
ple do experimental art as a 
hobby. Some artists have man-
aged to 'live solely off the 
works sold to a few friends or 
are supported by established 
older artists or union offi-
cials. 
Public Deviations Increasing 
The controversial Young 
Moscow Artists Exhibition which 
opened in May 1959 illustrated, 
according to one Soviet review, 
the "general tendency of young 
artists no longer to be guided 
by socialist realism." The 
youth newspaper Komsomolskaya 
Pravda hurled such charges as 
"self-styled revolutionary" and 
"decadent" at some of the par-
ticipants. One artist was ac-
cused of "thoughtless imitation 
of ultraleft Western painting" 
because he was interested in 
bold color combinations rather 
than content. A distorted por-
trait by another was described 
as "stylistic, introverted, a 
green frog in black water." 
Subsequent exhibitions by young 
artists in 1959 and this year 
have produced less official 
furor, but the epithet "formal-
ist" has cropped up again. 
The large crowds at lec-
tures against abstractionism in 
May 1959 and January 1960 il-
lustrate Soviet youth's inter-
est in modern art. At these 
lectures, members of the en-
thusiastic audience supported 
Polish abstract art and raised 
the embarrassing question of 
Picasso, whom the regime is 
proud to claim as Communist but 
whose extreme experimentation 
is forbidden to Soviet artists. 
In June 1959 two young Moscow 
audiences, one composed of 
Komsomoi membe]c:,:, hooted a 
speaker off the um when he 
at to plorlound 
realism. 
These trends have even 
found some encouragement in of-
ficial publications. The in-
fluential Literary Gazette has 
published many of Ehrenburg's 
articles championing impression-
ism and Picasso, art free from 
political or ideological fetters, 
and the artist's right to ex-
press himself in his own way 
even if the public has diffi-
culty understanding him. Its 
pages have also carried a writ-
er's attack on Academician Iogan-
son for his highhanded criticism 
of the Young Moscow Artists' 
Exhibition. 
Another article quoted the 
views of a "militant ignoramus" 
who ridiculed the work of an 
archconformist sculptor: "We 
are lagging behind the West. 
Art has finished with primitive 
materialism and Philistine real-
ism. The leading artists in 
the West long ago renounced the 
servile imitation of external 
reality and entered the world 
of moods.... Art is experienc-
ing a new phase, the collapse 
of form. I don't need cranes 
and factory chimneys...." 
The journal Art has devoted 
a series of artiZres to the 
theory of abstract painting, its 
development, and application to 
design. Moscow Artist, organ 
of the Moscow ArTI-g-TiT Union, 
was attacked by Komsomolskaya  
Pravda for its "conciliatory" 
attitude toward formalism.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
The nonconformist young 
poet Yevtushenko declared in a 
Komsotholskaya Pravda article: 
"I believe in the decorative 
significance of abstract paint-
ing." Georgy Nissky, a promi-
nent older painter, argued in 
Moscow Komsomoler that modern 
technology had brought about 
new forms of perceiving the 
world, and that movies now por-
trayed thematic conflicts bet-
ter than realistic painting. 
Foreign Exhibits Stir Ferment  
The East-West cultural ex-
change program has fanned the 
interest of Soviet youth in 
modern art. A Picasso exhibit 
from England in 1956, a French 
exhibit, and the Western art 
displayed at the Seventh World 
Youth Festival in 1957 created 
a furor. The largely abstract 
Polish paintings in an other-
wise orthodox exhibition of art 
from countries of the Communist 
bloc in December 1958 provoked 
new controversy which has been 
kept alive by a Yugoslav graph-
ics exhibit, a Swedish exhibi-
tion, the American Exhibition 
at Sokolniki Park in 1959, and 
a current British exhibition, 
all of which included modernist-
ic works. Occasional lectures 
by visiting Western art special-
ists and publications like the 
magazine Poland, which repro-
duces Polish abstract art, also 
have stimulated considerable in-
terest. 
At these exhibitions the 
modern art works drew the larg-
est crowds. Mirth, befuddle-
ment, shock, or hostility were 
the most common reactions. Some 
visitors, however, expressed 
their growing appreciation of 
modern art. A small group--com-
posed primarily of students, 
artists, young scientists, en-
gineers, professional people, 
and Soviet minority nationali-
ties--dared to defend modern 
art openly at these exhibitions 
or at least to argue that it 
should be shown. One artist 
lamented the fact that mass 
tastes had not yet been raised 
high enough to appreciate 
modern art. 
Regime Intensifies Campaign  
Since 1959 the regime has 
intensified its campaign for 
conformity to the principles 
of socialist realism. It clear-
ly recognizes that stylistic 
deviations could threaten the 
party's basic premise that art 
is merely an instrument of 
propaganda, and abstract art 
hardly lends itself to promo-
tion of the Seven-Year Plan. 
The party also fears that de-
mands for greater stylistic 
freedom might expand into de-
mands for other freedoms, and 
that the artists' deviations 
might contaminate other sections 
of the intelligentsia. In ad-
dition, artistic deviations 
weaken the image the regime 
seeks to propagate abroad of 
happy unified artists rallying 
around the party on the platform 
of socialist realism, which 
alone guarantees the fullest 
cultural flowering. 
The regime continues to 
discourage nonconformists by 
denying them exhibition space, 
commissions, and entrance to 
art schools. Agitation against 
private collections has begun, 
including threats to invade 
private apartments and studios. 
Titles, prizes, fat commissions, 
access to luxurious artist colo-
nies, and travel abroad are 
positive incentives to produce 
officially approved art. 
Antimodernist propaganda 
is geared to a higher intellec-
tual level because interest in 
modern art can no longer be dis-
missed with old clich� Party 
concern is revealed by lectures 
against abstractionism, a 1959 
series "Against Revisionism in 
Esthetics," the discovery of 
serious shortcomings in art 
criticism by the October 1959 
Artists' Union plenum, and the 
increasing press attacks on mod-
ernists since the spring of 1959.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
18 August 1960 
The founding congress of 
the RSFSR Artists' Union was 
held from 20 to 24 June 1960 
to bring the artists--especial-
ly the unruly Moscow group--
into line. Vladimir Serov, 
later elected the union's first 
secretary, argued that contem-
porary subject matter rather 
than modern form counted most 
in meeting the artistic needs 
of the present period. He 
stressed that sociali�t real-
ism embraced a multiplicity of 
styles, subjects, and genres, 
and admitted that certain in-
novations could contribute to 
more effective art as long as 
they did not become ends in 
themselves. He condemned artists 
who altered their style merely 
for the sake of appearing dif-
ferent or fashionable. Other 
speakers at the congress, how-
ever, insisted that contempo-
raneity implied a new artistic 
idiom. 
Serov condemned "some of 
our critics and art scholars 
and several of our writers and 
artists of the older generation" 
who for the sake of popularity 
have lauded youth's errors as 
new forms of quest or as artis-
tic individuality. He cited 
the four young Soviet modernist 
painters described in a recent 
Life article as examples of the 
need for greater vigilance 
against alien bourgeois ideology, 
but he promised careful, friend-
ly criticism rather_than_renr:ps_ 
sion as the remedy. (b)(3)
