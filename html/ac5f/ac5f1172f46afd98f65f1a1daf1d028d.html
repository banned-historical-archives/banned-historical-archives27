 ISRAEL-SYRIA:   Tel Aviv gave wide publicity yes-

 According to an Israeli spokesman,  Syrian shells
 struck two Israeli civilian settlements--Ramot Mag-
 shimim and Nov--causing some damage but no casual-
 ties.   Syrian shelling of civilian targets will
 heighten pressure within Israel to strike back harder
 at targets in Syria.   The Israeli press, while con-
 tinuing to praise the "great restraint" shown by Is-
 rael's forces in the face of "the Syrian provocations,"
 is viewing the escalating situation on the northern

 *ISRAEL:   The preliminary report issued late
 yesterday by the five-member Agranat Commission,
 which investigated Israeli shortcomings connected
 with the October war, praised Prime Minister Meir
 for doing in a responsible manner everything she
 could.   It also cleared Defense Minister Dayan of
 direct responsibility,  in view of the advice and
 information given him by Chief of Staff Elazar and
 intelligence chief Zeira.
 Elazar, while rejecting the commission's ac-
 cusations, promptly announced his resignation,
 which has been accepted by the cabinet.   The others
 named will probably follow suit.
 Placing the blame squarely on the military,  the
 preliminary report recommended that Elazar and Major
 General Gonen, commander of the Egyptian front at
 the start of the war, be suspended from active duty
 pending the commission's final report, which is ex-
 pected late this month. or early next.   The report
 further recommended removing General Zeira as in-
 telligence chief and dismissing other senior mil-
 itary intelligence officers, including Brigadier
 General Shalev,  Zeira's deputy for estimates.
 The report will only partially mollify the gov-
 ernment's critics, who are likely to charge the com-
 mission with turning a blind eye to the larger ques-
 tion of fixing political responsibility for the
 October failings.   The opposition may also criticize
 the commission for seemingly making a scapegoat of
 the military, which ma   itself react bit erly to the
 report.

 FRANCE:   The first round of elections to select
 a successor to deceased French President Pompidou
 will be held on April 28 or May 5--earlier than
 either the Gaullists or their leftist rivals would
 have preferred.   Liberal Gaullist and former prime
 minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas, 58, and Socialist
 Francois Mitterrand, 57, will be the main contenders,
 but a number of others will declare themselves can-
 didates.
 The Communists, Socialists, and left Radicals
 had hoped an election would not occur until at least
 next year.   They wanted more time to develop an im-
 age of international statesman for their leader,
 Socialist Francois Mitterrand, and to exploit popular
 dissatisfaction with the government's failure to re-
 solve the country's economic problems.
 The leaders of the alliance are still not agreed
 on how to present their candidates.   The Communists
 want Mitterrand to run as the sole leftist candidate;
 they fear one of their own would do poorly, exposing
 the party's weakened position.   Mitterrand, however,
 wants his allies to field candidates so he can run
 on a moderate,  Socialist platform, rather than be
 associated with the more extreme portions of the
 alliance program.   He is gambling that he will win
 enough votes on the first round to make the second
 round, where he hopes to prevail with the additional
 support of the Communist electorate.
 The governing coalition--Gaullists, Independent
 Republicans, and a small centrist group--is also in
 disarray.   One of their major problems is that
 Giscard d'Estaing,  the leader of the Independent
 Republicans, may choose to break coalition unity
 and run in the first round.   Giscard, 47, was thought
 to be Pompidou's favorite, :but faces serious opposi-
 tion from orthodox Gaullists.   Giscard is also
 hampered by his patrician image and his associations
 with France's economic woes as Pompidou's economics
 and finance minister.

 Other first round challenges could also come
 --Pierre Messmer, 58, the lack-lustre, orthodox
 Gaullist prime minister.   Some reports indicated
 that Pompidou had decided to support him be-
 cause he thought Gaullist approval of Giscard's
 candidacy was remote.
 --Jean Lecanuet, 53,  leader of one of the two
 center union factions.   He won 16 percent of
 the first ballot vote in 1965 against de Gaulle.
 He may run to avoid having to associate himself
 prematurely with one of the front runners.
 --Edgar Faure, 65, the leader of the left wing
 Gaullists and president of the National As-
 sembly.   He sees himself as a compromise can-
 didate on the right.
 --Alain Poher, 64, the centrist who will act
 as interim president.   In 1969, when he acted
 in that capacity after de Gaulle's resignation,
 Poher won 42 percent of the second round vote
 against Pompidou.
 Although Foreign Minister Michel Jobert is now
 receiving considerable publicity from his aggressive
 foreign policy tactics, the absence of a political
 base--he is not a member of any party--makes him an
 unlikely candidate.
 Under the present system, no president has
 been elected in the first round.   In view of the
 many likely candidates, this election probably will
 not be an exception.   Middle-of-the-road and uncom-
 mitted voters make up some 30 percent of the French
 electorate and hold the key to the presidential
 election.
 The law allows the top candidates to withdraw
 in favor of one of the first ballot losers.   This
 happens most often when a loser is thought more
 likely to draw wider second ballot support.   On the
 second ballot,  a simple majority elects.

 GREECE:   The US Embassy in Athens has confirmed
 a build-up of Greek military personnel and equipment
 on the Turkish frontier,   The military activity ap-
 pears to be of a contingency nature, designed to con-
 vince the Turks that Greek claims to oil-exploration
 rights in the Aegean Sea must be taken seriously,   The
 junta in Athens may also be deliberately fanning the
 controversy as a diversion from domestic problems and
 as a means of fostering unity within the army.
 Prospects of extensive oil resources in the Aegean
 have led to a controversy between Greece and Turkey
 over exploration rights in the vicinity of Greek islands.
 The two countries have put forth conflicting claims to
 the underlying continental shelf, and Greece has threat-
 ened to extend its territorial limits from the present
 6 to 12 miles from all Greek territory, including is-
 lands.   Notes were exchanged last month on the contro-
 versy, but Athens has apparently not yet agreed to
 negotiate the dispute.   According to Turkish press
 reports, Turkey's national petroleum corporation plans
 to begin searching for oil in the disputed area in June.
 Many of the recent press rumors about Greek mili-
 tary movements in northern Greece and the northern
 Aegean have been exaggerated, but there have been an
 unusual number of visits to the area by high-level
 military leaders.   On a. recent trip along the frontier
 with Turkey, a US official observed the passage of a
 large number of military vehicles; he also noted that
 normally quiet military vehicle parks were full and
 busy.   Greek military authorities in the area played
 down the activity, saying that troop and radio contacts
 with facing Turkish units were normal.

 CHINA-CAMBODIA:   Premier Chou En-lai's remarks
 at a banquet in Pe ing on April 1 for visiting Khmer
 Communist leader Khieu Samphan were couched in rela-
 tively militant terms, but they do not reflect any
 real change in Peking's policies toward Cambodia and
 the rest of Southeast Asia.   Chou's reiteration of
 Chinese support for revolutionary struggles and his
 citation of recent revolutionary "successes" indi-
 cate continuing concern about his vulnerability to
 criticism from "leftists" at home.
 In his speech, Chou was especially critical of
 the detente between the US and the Soviet Union, and
 contended that "revolutionary people" everywhere do
 not believe in "lasting peace" or "a generation of
 peace."  He predicted that the world would "continue
 to advance amid violent turbulence."
 The concept of rivalry between Moscow and Wash-
 ington resulting in world turmoil is not a new theme
 for Peking.   It has been used before as part of Pe-
 king's argument that China sides with weak countries
 against the two superpowers.   A "turbulent" situation
 is also seen by Peking as one which can be exploited
 by "progressive" countries and groups.
 From the Khmer Communist point of view,  a pri--
 mary purpose of Samphan's appearance in Peking and
 in Hanoi last week has been to emphasize to the world
 that the Khmer Communists must be reckoned with po--
 litically before the fighting can end in Cambodia.
 Samphan's trip has indeed served to identify Peking
 more closely with the Khmer Communist leadership.
 The warm reception and prominence accorded Samphan
 may also raise some questions concerning the politi-
 cal future of Sihanouk, whose return to power the
 Chinese have long proposed as part of a solution in
 Cambodia.
 On the prospects for a negotiated settlement,
 Chou's remarks reflected the cautionary tone that
 has characterized Peking's statements on the Cambo-
 dian problem over the past year.   Although Chou made

 no reference to peace proposals, he did imply ap-
 proval of a negotiated settlement in Cambodia by
 citing as "victories" the Paris and Vientiane cease-
 fire agreements.
 In contrast, Samphan denounced the US and its
 "lackeys" for alleged espousal of "sham cease-fire,
 sham talks, and sham peace."  He reiterated the strong
 Khmer Communist line against any compromise or nego-
 tiated settlement of the war, contending that the
 Khmer Communists wanted a "genuine peace," not one
 which would allow the Phnom Penh government to "recu-
 perate and strengthen its forces" in order to resume
 the attack.
 CAMBODIA:   The situation continues to worsen at
 the southwestern provincial capital of Kampot.
 The city remained under heavy Khmer Communist
 attack yesterday.   Insurgent forces just west of Kam-
 pot and around the airstrip to the northwest are
 posing a serious threat to government positions in
 those areas.   Sharp fighting is also continuing along
 the city's eastern perimeter.
 Although the government has superior troop
 strength and firepower at Kampot, the new commander
 there has been demanding additional reinforcements,
 ammunition, and air support before he will take of-
 fensive action.   Military leaders in Phnom Penh are
 contemplating sending more reinforcements, but any
 undue delay in the arrival of such support would
 probably cause troop morale at Kampot--which is
 already low--to disintegrate further.

 CHINA:  Against the backdrop of domestic polit-
 ical strife, Peking's decision to send Politburo
 member Teng Hsiao-ping to the UN this week strongly
 suggests that Premier Chou En-lai retains a strong
 hand in his struggle with Mao's radical wife, Chiang
 Ching.
 Although Chou and Teng were rivals in the past
 and still may have their differences, Teng is cer-
 tainly more likely to side with Chou in the current
 political struggle than with the radicals,  led by
 Madame Mao, who ousted him during the Cultural Rev-
 olution and apparently still resent his return.
 Teng's rehabilitation last year was--and still
 is--a highly controversial issue.   His return was
 reportedly supported by Mao and probably by Chou,
 but there is evidence that Madame Mao strongly op-
 posed it.   She was conspicuously absent from the
 banquet at which Teng made his initial reappearance.
 She did not appear wi
 Teng for several months after his return.
 More recently, a Western news agency reported
 that a leftist document written in 1968 has reappeared
 in Peking.   The document takes an indirect swipe at
 Teng and attacks another high-ranking official who
 has since been rehabilitated.   The document may have
 been redistributed as a counterattack by Chiang
 Ching, well after the fact, against the rehabilita-
 tion policy promoted by Chou.
 Although the reappearance of this document may
 be interpreted to mean that Teng Hsiao-ping is once
 again in trouble, his attendance at the UN is likely
 to convey an entirely different message.   Heading
 the UN delegation is, of course, a feather in his
 cap.   Moreover, by sending such a high-ranking offi-
 cial, Peking seems to be reaffirming its intention
 to remain active on the international scene.   This
 contrasts with speculation in the Western press that

 the active role of the radicals in the current do-
 mestic turmoil might draw China back into the iso-
 lationism that prevailed during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.   Because Teng was a major figure prior to the
 Cultural Revolution, his presence at the UN may also
 be a signal to the outside world that China is not
 slipping into another Cultural Revolution.
 Teng's new role will probably fuel speculation
 that he is being groomed to replace Chou En-lai as
 Premier, with Chou moving up to the long-vacant po-
 sition of head of state.   The question of whether
 there should even be a state chairman is a contro-
 versial one, however, and Peking's most recent pro-
 nouncement on the subject implied that the post
 would be abolished.   Chou is likely in any case to
 steer clear of accepting the position.   The two men
 who preceded him as number two in the party are now
 in disgrace, charged, among other things, with
 coveting the state chairmanship.
 A more likely possibility is that Teng will
 emerge in his old job as ranking deputy premier.
 He has already taken some of the load off Chou's
 shoulders in recent months.

 SOUTH VIETNAM:   The recent increase in combat
 action in Military Region 3 probably represents a
 Communist effort to regain the initiative there.
 Much of the Communist force in this area is now en-
 gaged in coordinated attacks against government po-
 sitions and in diversionary pressure elsewhere in
 the region.
 Some of the heaviest fighting is in Duc Hue
 District of Hau Nghia Province--a district in the
 middle of a major infiltration corridor connecting
 the delta to support lines running along the South
 Vietnamese - Cambodian border.   In late March a regi-
 ment of the North Vietnamese 5th Division moved into
 Duc Hue and attempted to drive government Rangers
 from the infiltration corridor.   Fighting was sharp
 for over two days before easing.   The Rangers have
 now been reinforced, and a mobile group from the
 ARVN 25th Division has moved back through the area
 without incident.
 At the same time the Communists were attacking
 in Duc Hue, they sharply increased their pressure on
 several other government positions northwest of Sai-
 gon.  Lt. Gen. Thuan, MR 3 commander, believes this
 may be the opening of a combined campaign to isolate
 Tay Ninh Province from the surrounding provinces.
 Such a plan would be grandiose, in view of present
 Communist military capabilities in this area, but
 Thuan is taking precautions and has ordered his
 forces to keep the Communists on the defensive.   He
 appears optimistic that recent government operations
 have weakened the enemy and caused the Communists to
 change their plans.

 GRENADA:   The Seamen and Dockworkers Union has
 ended its Tree-month strike in exchange for a prom-
 ise by Prime Minister Eric Gairy to disband his se-
 cret police and resume the inquiry into charges of
 police brutality.   Cargo will not start arriving on
 the island until this weekend, by which time the
 strikers hope to have some indication whether Gairy
 intends to keep his promise.   Basic economic problems
 will persist, however, and the potential for renewed
 violence remains high.
 The union actually received nothing more than
 the assurances. Gairy gave last December and then re-
 fused to honor.   The strike,                            called to force his com-
 pliance, has so weakened the economy that Gairy--with
 a bankrupt government--may have to follow through
 this time.   If he does not, there may be a new walk-
 out,  augmented by unpaid teachers and, civil servants.
 The past four months of disorder and economic
 stagnation may have breathed new life into the dor-
 mant opposition Grenada National Party.   Many Grena-
 dians--including most businessmen--who do not feel
 comfortable allied with the more radical New Jewel
 Movement may now look to the Grenada National Party
 as the best alternative to Gairy.
 Gairy, however, is not required to call elec-
 tions for three years.  With a strong majority in
 the island Parliament, he is not likely to be forced
 into early elections by a vote of "no confidence"
 unless renewed disorder or a prolonged economic
 pinch causes many of his own party to "cross the
 aisle."

 UK:   The Labor government is moving to head off
 pressure by the party's left wing to force the govern-
 ment to make the large reductions in defense spending
 that had been promised in the party's election mani-
 festo.
 Defense Secretary Mason, in a speech on March 29,
 outlined the difficulties of making quick cuts in the
 defense budget beyond the $115 million announced by
 the government earlier in the week.  Mason stressed
 that:
 --increases in pay and allowances and costs of
 equipment were rising at an alarming rate be-
 cause of inflation.   For example, the cost of
 aviation fuel had risen by 200 percent.
 --each new generation of weapons is more sophis-
 ticated and expensive.
 --equipment cuts would be the most likely way
 to save in the short term; however, three indus-
 tries--aerospace, shipbuilding, and electronics--
 depend on defense spending for one fifth of their
 production.
 --consultations with the allies are necessary if
 the government plans major changes, and this is
 a complex matter.   In addition to its NATO com-
 mitments, the UK also has responsibilities in
 other-parts of the world and to British overseas
 territories.
 --troop pay must be consistent with the dangers
 faced, particularly in Northern Ireland.
 Mason said that his review of defense expendi-
 tures would be conducted "calmly and rationally" and
 that he would announce his decision later this year.
 A Ministry of Defense policy-planning official
 stated earlier this month that the new government
 plans to review long-range defense spending for the

 1977-83 period.   The review, in ascending order of
 importance, will begin with a study of UK commitments
 in the Pacific, the Middle East and Mediterranean,
 and finally NATO and the UK itself.   After the study
 is completed, probably in early summer, the allies,
 especially the US, will be consulted.   A white paper
 will be published late this year.
 The official emphasized that this measured ap-
 proach does not mean that the British defense effort
 will be maintained at current levels.   He anticipated
 that the review will force the government to make some
 hard decisions to reduce commitments, Particularly out-
 side NATO.

 West Germany:   Bonn officially announced yester-
 day a monthly record trade surplus of $1.8 billion
 for February--despite sharply higher oil prices.
 This compares with the previous record surplus of
 $1.6 billion in October 1973.   Bonn apparently de-
 layed its announcement for nearly two weeks in an
 unsuccessful effort to prevent further upward pres-
 sure on the mark.
