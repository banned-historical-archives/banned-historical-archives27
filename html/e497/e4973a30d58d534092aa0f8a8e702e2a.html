 Reform of China's Rural
 Industry: The Disadvantages
 The development of rural industry-a key element in China's economic
 reform program-is proceeding much too rapidly for Beijing to control or
 sustain, and is causing serious economic and political problems for the
 regime. Spurred by government incentives, eased credit restrictions, and
 enhanced business opportunities, rural enterprises-ranging from shoe
 repair stalls to small coal mines and factories-grew nearly 45 percent in
 1984, and about the same rate in 1985. At the beginning of last year, the
 sector was already producing more than one-fourth of the nation's coal,
 40 percent of its garments, and three-fourths of the output of building
 materials. This hyperactivity, however, has drawn resources away from
 grain production, contributed to inflation, weakened Beijing's efforts to
 control the economy, and facilitated corruption among rural officials.
 sector, and long-neglected rural consumers.
 China's reformers have long viewed rural industrial development as crucial
 to China's modernization. In general, it is intended economically to link
 agriculture to industry, and specifically to benefit China's food-processing
 industry, the state's transportation network, the much-needed services
 output, and responding to nascent market signals.
 Politically, the program is part of an effort to transfer successful reform ex-
 periences from the countryside to the cities. Some reformers appear to
 believe that it will also prove the practicability of loosened central controls
 and greater market influence over economic activity. Rural industry does
 indeed appear to be the sector most responsive to free market reforms. Free
 of excessive bureaucratic controls, rural industrial entrepreneurs have been
 aggressive in establishing new products and services, marketing their
 small-scale rural industries.
 Most important, however, Beijing's rural industrialization policies reflect
 demographic necessities. The success of agricultural reforms since 1979
 has given China excess farm labor. Over 160 million peasants have left
 farming to work for other enterprises on at least a part-time basis, and Chi-
 nese officials expect that over 200 million more will do so before the end of
 the century. Beijing intends to prevent this potentially migratory labor
 force from moving to China's already overcrowded cities, and instead to
 channel it to small satellite cities, where former peasants will engage in

 In our view, runaway growth began in the rural industrial sector during
 1984-85 as a result of unchecked peasant enthusiasm for establishing
 small-scale businesses, driven in part by the government's claim that rural
 industry was a way to "get rich through labor." Poorly developed credit
 policies and insufficient understanding of government goals by local
 officials were also major factors in the problems that developed. Beijing
 has responded belatedly with measures to limit rural credit and punish
 corruption, but the continued high growth rate for rural industry indicates
 that the problem is not under control. We believe that new problems will be
 exposed as inefficient and poorly managed rural enterprises begin to go
 bankrupt.
 But, at the same time, the expansion of the rural industrial sector has
 raised the quality of life for many of the 800 million inhabitants of rural
 areas. The income of families engaged in rural enterprises averages 24
 percent higher than those specializing in agricultural production, and rural
 industry throughout the country is beginning to provide peasants with a
 greater variety of consumer goods and services. In addition, rural enter-
 prises have helped ease critical economic bottlenecks, particularly in
 energy and transportation.
 Conservative critics of the rapid pace of economic reform, led by Politburo
 Standing Committee member Chen Yun, have seized upon problems
 related to rural industry-including the credit binge, corruption, and a
 drop in grain production-to step up their attacks on the reformist
 leadership. Implications that the reformers have mishandled rural econom-
 ic policy-the very area where they have achieved their most impressive
 success in the past-have been more damaging than charges that the
 reforms are ideologically suspect. Although the reformers are on the
 defensive, they have been able to hold their ground and are insisting that
 the programs will be continued.
 We believe rural industrial policies are so important to China's reform-
 ers-who have invested so much political capital in the program-that
 they have little choice but to continue. Rural industrial growth, therefore,
 is likely to continue to lead other sectors of the economy, at least for the
 short term. Rather than stimulate the sector any more, however, we believe
 Beijing will stress controlling the growth through financial institutions,
 reducing the waste and corruption through disciplining local officials, and
 guiding the output of rural industries through regulatory means.

 In our view, Beijing will find it difficult to control rural enterprise growth
 through its normal administrative policies without resorting to heavyhand-
 ed methods that would dampen economic activity excessively. Although a
 "socialist commodity economy" under free market controls may be
 ideologically unpalatable to some conservatives, that is the direction in
 which China's rural economy is moving, and we believe it is too late to turn
 back without serious social, political, and economic consequences. We
 believe that the reformers are preparing for a "shakeout" period of market
 discipline, during which some of the rural industries will be allowed to fail.
 This is likely to be a politically difficult period, as the government attempts
 to insulate the rest of the economy and society from the effects of large
 numbers of bankruptcies.
 In the longer run, however, we believe rural industrial policies will
 accomplish most of the goals reformers have set for them: creating a more
 diversified, efficient, and active economy. China hopes that an increasing
 share of its light industrial products and foodstuffs will be exported. The
 United States undoubtedly is viewed as a major potential market for these
 goods, and Beijing's efforts to develop trade links and join international
 organizations, such as the GATT, may be partially motivated by its future
 plans for the export of light industrial goods. In general, however, small-
 scale industries will have less of an impact on trade than on the
 development of the domestic economy.

 Beijing's View of the Development Stages
 of Rural Industrial Integration
 =Technology flow
 Under Mao Zedong's leadership, collectives were allowed
 to develop only a very small.rural industrial sector for
 processing agricultural produce for urban consumers and
 repairing and maintaining agricultural machinery. China is
 currently entering stage two of its plan, as rural industry
 begins to show a degree of sophistication and differen-
 tiation, and to supply components and products to the
 urban industrial sector. Agriculture is also becoming
 more closely integrated with rural industry as, for example,
 peasants process and market more of their crops and begin
 holdings more than one job.
 We believe that China's final goal is for the difference in
 products and quality between the two industrial sectors to
 largely disappear. The development and integration of rural
 industry will theoretically increase the incomes of the
 agricultural sector, simultaneously providing a market for
 the further expansion of the industrial sectors.

 Reform of China's Rural
 Industry: The Disadvantages
 of Rapid Growth
 Rural Industry: Spurring
 Modernization and Absorbing Labor
 China's economy for the past two years has generally
 been hampered by a problem of unbalanced growth
 and overheating. Although the urban industrial sector
 has been the focus of most Chinese as well as Western
 attention (with an overall growth rate in 1985 of about
 18 percent), rural industry has been leading the
 economy with 45-percent growth in 1984 and an
 estimated similar rate for 1985. This frenetic growth
 has contributed to several of China's more serious
 economic problems, including inflation, shortages of
 capital and construction materials, and lowered grain
 production. Because the hyperactivity in the rural
 industrial sector is a direct result of deliberate govern-
 ment stimulation, the burgeoning problems have gen-
 erated political controversy as well.
 In our judgment, Beijing had a variety of motives
 when it introduced new policies in 1984 to promote
 rural industrialization. In practical economic terms,
 the policies were designed to develop the much-needed
 service sector, improve the food-processing industry,
 make more consumer goods available to rural inhabit-
 ants, and ease the burden on the state's distribution
 and transportation networks. In a larger, more ideo-
 logical framework, many Chinese leaders see rural
 industry as the key to a socialist integration of the
 country, linking agriculture to industry and cities to
 the countryside (see figure 1). Some reformist leaders
 appear to view the rural industrial sector as a proving
 ground for the development of a "socialist commodity
 economy," with heavy elements of free market ex-
 change.
 Principally, however, the rural industrial development
 program has been driven by demographic necessity.
 Agricultural reform policies introduced since late
 1978 have been highly successful, more than doubling
 Beijing defines rural enterprises as businesses owned
 or operated by any of the following: townships,
 villages, production teams, combinations of several
 families, and individual households. The present-day
 township is equal in size to what was called the
 commune before its economic and political functions
 began to be separated in 1982. Communes were made
 up of brigades, which are now called villages or
 towns. Production teams, the third tier of the former
 collective accounting structure, have retained their
 name and usually consist of roughly 20 to 30
 families.
 The term rural is somewhat misleading, because
 many of the enterprises are in towns and may employ
 as many as several hundred workers. Rural enter-
 prise statistics are also an odd blend of agricultural
 and industrial figures. For accounting purposes, Chi-
 na in the past considered rural industrial production
 below the commune level as agricultural output,
 while commune level and above was considered as
 industrial output. Starting in statistical reports for
 1985, however, output value from the former brigade-
 and team-run industries is included in industrial
 output.
 Rural enterprises were traditionally engaged primari-
 ly in food-processing and agricultural machinery
 industries, linking the rural areas to the cities. But
 rural enterprises have expanded rapidly and now
 include a myriad of light and heavy industrial,
 transportation, and service enterprises.

 the value of farm production (see figure 2).' The
 increased productivity and specialization of agricul-
 ture have led to an excess of rural labor. Already
 some 60 million peasants have left agriculture, and
 Beijing estimates that an additional 100 million peas-
 ants are working in agriculture only part of the year.
 Xinhua, the official Chinese press, recently reported
 that over the next five years 30 million young people
 will enter the labor force, 10 million more will be
 rendered redundant as the result of reconsolidation of
 collective enterprises, and 100 million peasants will
 leave the land to enter rural industrial and service
 enterprises. In effect, it has taken only two years to
 change the traditional role of Chinese agriculture
 from being the employer of last resort for the urban
 unemployed to becoming the source of labor to devel-
 op industry. The Rural Policy Research Center in
 Beijing estimates that by the end of the century 40
 percent of the rural labor force will be involved in
 ' The new policies, usually referred to as the production responsibil-
 ity system, raised agricultural prices and broke up the traditional
 collective accounting structure. Contracts replaced strict produc-
 tion and acreage quotas, communal land was divided among
 individual families, and farmers were permitted to make their own
 production decisions. Diversification of production away from grain
 has also been encouraged, with families and collectives to specialize
 in the product in which they have the greatest comparative
 advantage. Families wishing to engage in rural enterprises are
 allowed to sublease their fields to other families specializing in crop

 flow.
 Market Towns Become Key Link
 Beijing has taken several steps to keep the peasants
 leaving the farm from migrating to urban areas.
 Cities can grant urban residency status to very few
 peasants, and strict short-term residency standards
 have been drawn up for peasants working in cities for
 short periods. In our view, a system being adopted
 that will require all citizens to carry a personal
 identification card is partially motivated by the desire
 to monitor and control the rural-urban population

 Beijing hopes instead to move peasants into smaller
 "market towns"' whose development is to be directed
 by local and regional officials. In effect, the policy
 encourages the creation of a giant network of suburbs,
 or satellite towns. Guidance on construction of the
 towns has come from both national and provincial
 levels, telling local officials to select and develop the
 towns carefully in light of their resources and
 potential.
 Despite problems-the press indicates that, in the
 haste of construction, most market towns are growing
 haphazardly without any master plans-market
 towns are important to Beijing's ideologues as well as
 its economic planners. They represent the bridge to
 integrate industry with agriculture, as well as cities
 with rural areas. To develop successfully, rural indus-
 try requires both labor, raw materials, and capital
 from the agricultural sector and the technology and
 markets provided by urban industry.
 Reasons for Rapid Growth
 Although the Chinese Government has always en-
 couraged the development of small-scale industries by
 rural production units, the rapid growth of the last
 two years is, in our view, a direct result of new state
 incentives and the ready availability of investment
 funds. Equally important, however, was the political
 support given to rural industrialization by high-level
 party leaders, especially General Secretary Hu Yao-
 bang. Party propagandists laid heavy stress on the
 idea that peasants could "get rich through labor" by
 engaging in rural enterprise development, and publi-
 cized numerous examples of peasant families who
 became "10,000-yuan households" through such
 endeavors.
 ' There appear to be varying definitions of what actually constitutes
 a rural market town-announcements of the current number of
 such towns range between 20,000 and 60,000. In general, the cities
 are government seats that are being developed into industrial,
 social, political, and commercial centers. The cities are to be of
 small and medium size but linked to large cities and other market
 towns to facilitate trade and communications. The US Embassy in
 Beijing reports that current plans are for 2,400 new market towns,
 and for the rest of the peasants to be absorbed by raising the
 population of existing small towns to 40,000, from an average of
 Government Incentives. Government directives since
 early 1984 have centered on encouraging the develop-
 ment of rural enterprises and freeing marketing chan-
 nels to allow them to operate freely and efficiently.
 Some of the regulations since that time have allowed:
 ? The establishment of service and commercial opera-
 tions in small towns.
 ? Liberalized loans for rural enterprises.
 ? Linking of managers' salaries to profits.
 ? Greater control of hiring, firing, and wages by local
 managers.
 ? Increased access to relevant production technology
 and management techniques.
 The most dramatic example of Beijing's new attitude
 toward small business has been its massive program of
 divestiture. According to a Ministry of Commerce
 announcement in August, the national government
 has turned over the management of 55,000 business-
 es-nearly 70 percent of its small, state-owned busi-
 nesses-to collectives, groups, or individuals. The
 entire ownership of 5,000 of these businesses has been
 turned over to collectives, some of which are issuing
 shares to their members, creating the equivalent of
 employee-owned corporations. According to the Min-
 istry of Commerce, these enterprises usually have
 annual profits of less than 200,000 yuan (US $67,000)
 and include enterprises such as general stores, snack-
 bars, tailors, barbershops, hotels, and grain shops.
 Available Financing. Chinese officials are pleased to
 point out that rural industrial production has been
 financed largely by local collective and individual
 investments rather than central funds. A recent arti-
 cle in the Peoples' Daily reported that the $2 billion
 of state financial aid to town and township industries
 from 1979 to 1984 was only one-fourth of the gross
 taxes delivered by those industries to the state during
 the same period.

 Developing Rural Enterprises: Small Coal Mines
 The development of China's small mines illustrates
 many of the successes, problems, and trade-offs being
 made in the development of rural enterprises.
 Small mines produce a wide variety of minerals in
 China, but by far the largest product is coal. In the
 Chinese press, small-scale mining refers to operations
 by townships, cooperatives, and individuals. Opera-
 tions by the last two levels are referred to as rural
 mines, and it is in this sector that the most dramatic
 growth has occurred, both in terms of the number of
 ? To increase energy supplies with a minimum of
 state investment.
 ? To provide energy to rural areas and industries
 where the state cannot or will not supply coal.
 ? To reduce the strain on the state's coal allocation
 and distribution systems.
 ? To work small deposits not economically feasible
 for large state operations.
 ? To increase the recovery rate for deposits already
 partially worked out, which larger operations prefer
 mines and in production.
 The growth started in 1981, when small mines were
 given subsidies, grants, and tax breaks. But, because
 central government funding mainly benefited the larg-
 er state-owned mines, small mines were developed
 mainly with funds from local governments and bank
 loans. As other rural industries developed and the
 price of free market coal was allowed to rise, incen-
 tives for mining increased. The US Embassy reports
 that the number of small mines grew 66 percent in
 1983 and another 22 percent to a total of 61,000
 mines in 1984. Total small mine output in 1984 was
 216 million tons (actual weight), up 27 percent, and
 accounted for 28 percent of China's total coal
 production.
 The dramatic growth has already accomplished most
 of the goals for which small mines were established,
 including:
 to ignore.
 However, these accomplishments have not come with-
 out some substantial, and probably largely unantici-
 pated, costs. Small coal mines are increasingly com-
 ing under fire in the Chinese press for uncontrolled
 growth. Problems with the small mines include:
 ? Interference with state mining operations, including
 encroaching on state property and ruining state
 sites and equipment.
 ? Poor safety records, both for the inexperienced
 peasant miners and for state miners operating near
 them.
 ? Low quality of mined coal, which is usually unsuit-
 able for industrial use and inequitably priced.
 ? Low efficiency, averaging only 20 percent recovery
 rates for small mines as opposed to an average of
 50 percent for state mines.
 ? Damage to the environment from indiscriminate
 mining.

 While direct state expenditures have been relatively
 small for the development of rural industries, the role
 of state financing through bank loans has been
 critical. Since 1983, Beijing has made several adjust-
 ments to the rural banking system to enable it to
 support specialized agricultural production and rural
 industry. Most of the changes involved giving the
 local banks more autonomy to make loans and set
 interest rates on loans and deposits
 Beijing has also begun turning the nation's rural
 credit cooperatives' into locally managed, dividend-
 paying, and profitmaking organizations. The decen-
 tralization has proved to be a major boost for rural
 enterprises. Loans to peasants skyrocketed, with one
 Chinese press report indicating that outstanding loans
 to rural enterprises increased 212 percent in 1984 to
 15.2 billion yuan. The article stated that, for the first
 four months of 1985, they had increased 485 percent
 over the same period in 1984.5
 Another major source of investment funds in the past
 two years has been the reemergence of the so-called
 popular forms of credit-peasant and collective funds
 pooled into mutual funds and stock or bond issues.
 According to a China Finance article, 30 to 40
 percent of all locally raised funds for rural develop-
 ment came from these forms in 1984. Peasants often
 find these forms of credit more attractive than those
 of the standard financial institutions because they
 offer higher interest rates on deposits and are more
 accommodating and less bureaucratic in their loan
 procedures. In some cases, the interest rates charged
 by the popular credit organizations are several times
 higher than prevailing bank rates. But peasants are
 still willing to sign the loans because of the high
 returns from rural industrial enterprises.
 Rural credit co-ops were organized in the 1950s as mutual aid
 organizations with a high degree of local autonomy. But in the past
 two decades the Agriculture Bank has undercut the independence
 of the co-ops, increasing their bureaucracy and turnin them into
 virtual subsidiaries of provincial agricultural banks.
 ' These figures may represent upward revisions of loan estimates or
 a mistake in the presentation of the data. Earlier Chinese an-
 nouncements were approximately 100 percent lower; that is, they
 stated that the loans had increased to (rather than by) approximate-
 ly 212 and 485 percent of the previous year's amount. In either
 case, it is clear that central authorities were not expecting such a
 The large pool of peasant savings provided the re-
 maining 60 to 70 percent of locally raised investment
 funds last year. Because of the increase in procure-
 ment prices and agricultural output-as well as the
 lack of consumer goods and agricultural inputs avail-
 able for purchase-peasant savings deposits have
 increased between 35 and 50 percent annually from
 1980 through 1984. In addition to the 200 billion
 yuan of peasant deposits in cooperatives in 1984,
 Chinese press articles estimated that peasants hold
 three-fourths of the currency in circulation, including
 50 billion yuan stashed away in homes.
 Were the Policies Too Successful?
 The response to these policies has quickly made rural
 industry a major sector of China's economy. In 1984,
 rural industry accounted for 13 percent of the gross
 value of social output 6 and two-fifths of the gross
 output of the rural economy. Total profits reached
 almost 18 billion yuan, and taxes from the sector grew
 to 9.1 billion, or over 60 percent of taxes collected
 from rural areas.
 The number of rural enterprises also increased sharp-
 ly in 1984, rising from 1.4 million to 6.1 million by
 yearend. At that time, Beijing announced that rural
 enterprises employed 52 million people, or roughly
 16 percent of the total rural labor force. Xinhua
 reports that by mid-1985 the number had risen to 60
 million.
 Information for the first half of 1985 indicates that
 the output of rural industries continued to grow at a
 rate more than one-and-a-half times the growth in the
 same period of 1984. At the beginning of 1985, the
 sector was producing more than one-fourth of the
 nation's coal, two-fifths of its garments, and three-
 fourths of the output of building materials. Although
 rural enterprises were originally envisioned as devel-
 oping the nation's food-processing industry, higher
 profits in other operations have led to the production
 of a wider variety of goods.
 `Gross value of social output is the measure of growth for China's
 economy as a whole, including industry, agriculture, capital con-
 struction, transportation, business, and commerce.

 China: Composition of Rural Enterprise
 Output, 1984
 Much of the recent growth has occurred in private
 business enterprises owned and run by one or more
 peasant families. At the end of June 1985, Chinese
 press reports indicate that 10.6 million private busi-
 nesses (both rural and urban) with over 15 million
 employees had registered with the state. This repre-
 sents a 14.5-percent increase since 1984 and nearly 15
 times the number of private businesses in 1980. These
 figures probably understate the real growth because
 of those engaging in business without a license.
 Registered private businesses include:
 ? 5.8 million commercial establishments.
 ? 1 million food stalls and restaurants.
 ? 800,000 transport firms.
 ? 750,000 repair shops.
 ? 650,000 service shops and stalls.
 ? 40,000 house-repair businesses.

 The Positive Results
 The expanding rural industrial sector has raised the
 quality of life for many of the 800 million inhabitants
 of rural areas. One 1984 Chinese survey showed that
 income of families engaged in rural enterprises aver-
 aged 24 percent higher than those specializing in
 agricultural production. Chinese press reports state
 that the peasant saying "no economic stability with-
 out agricultural development" has been replaced by
 "no prosperity without engaging in industry." And,
 perhaps just as important, rural industry is beginning
 to provide a greater variety of consumer goods and
 services for peasants to dispose of their rising incomes.

 The Accuracy of Chinese Rural Statistics
 Rural industries have also helped draw enterprises
 into the sectors that have been bottlenecks for the
 economy, particularly energy and transportation.
 Over the first half of 1985, the number of people
 engaged in private transport businesses grew by over
 40 percent, and these businesses now account for more
 than 40 percent of the total goods transported in
 China on a ton/kilometer basis. This phenomenal
 growth has occurred despite China's poor transport
 infrastructure and persistent press reports that some
 state transportation officials hinder private operators.
 The vast majority of private transport enterprises
 engage primarily in local hauling, and benefited from
 the state's decision earlier this year to increase short-
 statistical skills.
 We believe that the statistics announced by the
 Chinese Government are usually the best it has, and
 their accuracy is improving as China develops its
 constant prices.
 It is unlikely, however, that Beijing has current and
 reliable statistics on the vast number of changes
 occurring in the countryside. Indeed, the US Embas-
 sy reports that both State Statistical Bureau officials
 and State Council economic advisers have comment-
 ed unofficially that information on the rural economy
 is especially poor. State Statistical Bureau officials
 cautioned that rural enterprise statistics are unreli-
 able, overstated, and in current prices, while statistics
 on state-run enterprises are relatively reliable and in
 activity.
 It is also apparent that definitions of new organiza-
 tions and accounting methods are not uniform
 throughout the country. At the local level, cadre
 reporting is probably being influenced by ideology as
 well as the lack of statistical skills. For example,
 cadre eager to follow the new central directives on
 rural industry may overestimate growth and success
 under their administration. Likewise, Chinese press
 reports indicate that cadre in some areas are opposed
 to implementing the new reforms, which could lead
 them to distort their reports on rural industrial
 The Chinese-source statistics cited in this report were
 taken from the most authoritative sources and the
 most recent publication dates available. In some

 haul rail freight rates.
 China has reported that energy produced by rural
 industries in 1984 was equivalent to 164 million tons
 of standard coal or 20 percent of the nation's total
 energy output. During the same period, those indus-
 tries reportedly consumed less than the equivalent of
 100 million tons of standard coal.
 Finally, a Chinese survey revealed that changes in the
 management of the firms had resulted in better
 service, higher profits, and greater satisfaction among
 both employees and customers. In addition to unleash-
 ing initiative by linking personal income to produc-
 tion, rural enterprises have other advantages over
 state enterprises in their ample supply of cheap labor,
 flexibility, and full decisionmaking power. One town-
 ship enterprise official described his attitude toward
 competition with other businesses:
 We have what others have not; what we have is
 better than others; others may have good quality
 but ours is cheaper; and when theirs becomes
 cheaper, we will shift to some new products.
 Following the pattern of reporting occurring in 1979-
 81 when the peasant responsibility system was rapid-
 ly being implemented, it is likely that the quality of
 Chinese statistics on rural industry will improve as
 uniform definitions and statistical collection mecha-
 Trying To Control Growth
 We believe, however, that the decentralization of
 authority over the rural financial system set the stage
 for dangerously high levels of investment in rural
 industry. Because of the high profits available in the

 enterprises, peasants flocked to banks and coopera-
 tives to sign loans for investment funds. In 1984, for
 example, the Agricultural Bank increased rural enter-
 prise loans by 120 percent to 48 billion yuan ($16
 billion), when its goal was for only a 20-percent
 increase, and loans to rural enterprises during the first
 quarter of 1985 rose 420 percent over the same period
 of 1984. Chinese officials recently told visiting US
 officials that the level of investment and industrial
 growth had taken them completely by surprise.
 Moreover, the resurgence of popular credit forms,
 outlawed since 1949, has not come without some
 ideological opposition. The state is losing its monopoly
 over rural credit, and interest rates have also climbed
 dramatically as mutual fund and bond issues bid for
 money. Several Chinese press articles have attacked
 the credit forms for returning usury to the country-
 side.
 Beijing Clamps Down. Alarmed at the expansion, by
 April of last year Beijing began announcing economic
 and administrative controls to slow growth and cool
 down the economy. The State Council transmitted
 orders to all banks to limit loans and the issuance of
 currency by:
 ? Limiting the credit quotas and balances of all
 specialized banks (such as the Agricultural Bank).
 ? Having the specialized banks set credit balance
 limits for all provinces and instruct the provincial
 banks on handling their loans and deposits.
 ? Setting guidelines on making loans only to profit-
 able, efficient businesses producing desired goods.
 ? Subjecting the specialized banks to Peoples Bank
 regulations on deposits, credits, and interest rates.
 ? Requiring rural cooperatives to place at least 30
 percent of their deposits in the Agricultural Bank,
 thus decreasing their funds available for loans.
 ? Requiring agricultural procurement funds to be
 treated as a special item and not to be lent.
 The impact of the regulations was dramatic in Si-
 chuan, according to the Chinese publication Econom-
 ic Information. Officials there suddenly found them-
 selves without any funds in the midst of an
 foundry near Beijing.
 unprecedented economic expansion. The revised tar-
 get for Sichuan's bank loans to rural industries was
 dropped to 95 million yuan, down from 1.4 billion for
 all of 1984. But, during the first quarter of 1985,
 Sichuan's banks had already lent 160 million yuan to
 rural enterprises. All new loans were frozen, bank
 officials ordered rural enterprises to return 70 million
 yuan, and banks began to obtain working capital by
 making withdrawals from the accounts of some enter-
 prises that had already invested their loans.
 Growth Continues. By the end of August, Beijing
 announced that the growth in state loans had been
 slowed, but loans were still 20 billion yuan more than
 during the same period of 1984. Banks apparently had
 difficulty recalling loans and controlling credit, as
 evidenced by the inability of some banks to pay
 peasants for the procurement of their crops at mid-
 year. Some banks were criticized for not aggressively
 calling in their loans because bank personnel, or their
 friends and relatives, had interests in the enterprises.
 Peasants were also reluctant to repay the loans, and
 one county in Guangxi even increased its loans by
 having the local party officials threaten the bankers
 with the loss of their party membership if they
 insisted on recall.

 Moreover, even after state credit tightened in most
 areas, rural enterprises were continuing their expan-
 sion by using popular credit, over which the state had
 no direct control. Boosted by rural enterprises, nation-
 wide expenditures on capital construction through
 July were up by 43 percent and industrial production
 had increased by 23 percent, and this trend continued
 to place severe constraints on prices and supplies of
 many goods. During that time, investment in rural
 enterprises had risen 87 percent nationwide, and had
 more than doubled in eight provinces. Bank officials
 were encouraged to withdraw funds from the current
 operations accounts of rural enterprises. No loans for
 new construction projects were to be made, and local
 banks lost the authority to make such loans.
 Turning to Administrative Controls. Beijing evidently
 was not confident that simply limiting state funds was
 adequate, and so it turned to administrative controls.
 In October, the State Council ordered local govern-
 ments to run a credit check on popular credit institu-
 tions and to temporarily suspend their activities.
 Tianjin subsequently announced the closure of a
 county trust and investment company, with its capital
 to be turned over to the state banking system immedi-
 ately. The new controls and the closing of an appar-
 ently healthy investment company are probably only
 the first steps to control "unofficial" rural financial
 activity.
 Although data for the second half of 1985 have not
 been announced, Zhang Yi, head of the Agriculture
 Ministry's Rural Enterprises Bureau, estimated in
 November that the rate of growth in rural enterprise
 output would decline. Zhang conceded, however, that
 the growth rate for 1985 will still exceed the record
 growth in 1984 output. He projected that 1986 would
 bring slower growth rates in both the sector's output
 and its borrowing.
 Problems in Production and Consumption
 This loss of control has affected other sectors of the
 economy as well. In agriculture, for example, the
 higher profits available in rural industry and industri-
 al crop production led to a decline in the funds,
 acreage, and labor expended on the 1985 grain crops.
 China Daily reported in August that 1.3 million
 tractors, or more than one-fourth of the nation's total,
 had been diverted to transport goods full time. Grain
 stored from previous bumper harvests has thus far
 kept the problem from affecting food supplies, but
 Beijing is clearly worried. Some areas are reinstating
 grain output and acreage quotas, and Jiangsu has
 even required rural factories to invest in farmland
 improvement and to give other forms of aid to grain
 producers.
 Rural industries, particularly energy inefficient be-
 cause of their small scale and obsolete equipment, are
 also draining China's limited energy resources. Much
 of their equipment was transferred to them, or even
 previously scrapped, because of its energy inefficien-
 cy. Although rural enterprises mined more coal in
 1984 than the equivalent energy they consumed, the
 coal was of poor quality and not distributed nation-
 wide, leaving areas away from coal deposits even more
 strapped for energy. The planned expansion of blast
 furnaces in one province, moreover, has led to con-
 flicts with larger state-owned plants for raw materials,
 as well as cutthroat competition with other small
 plants.
 Worsening Income Distribution
 Rural enterprises are also worsening China's income
 distribution, which is already causing concern among
 conservative senior cadre, who are afraid that the
 growing income gaps will lead to a new class polariza-
 tion in rural areas. The issue arose during the summer
 of 1985, and particularly during the September Con-
 ference of Party Delegates, when Politburo Standing
 Committee member Chen Yun castigated the party
 propaganda apparatus for giving too much publicity
 to "10,000-yuan households." The reformers moved
 quickly to defend rural industrialization policies, in-
 sisting that certain peasant families were bound to get
 rich first, before they aided other families in doing so.
 The concern of conservatives will become harder to
 dispel, however, as income disparities remain and in
 fact widen under the reform policies. Although more
 wealthy provinces would probably have developed
 faster in any case, that fact was assured when state

 funds were cut off in April and Beijing announced
 that rural enterprises were to be developed with
 private and collective funds. In fact, the most rapid
 growth has occurred in the richer, coastal provinces;
 poorer, inland provinces still lack the funds, technol-
 ogy, and market access to capitalize on enterprise
 development.
 Beijing is undertaking several measures to improve
 income distribution. Supply and marketing coopera-
 tives are being established nationwide to provide
 better marketing opportunities and supplies of inputs
 in less developed areas. The Agricultural Bank has
 also adopted a program to provide 300 million yuan to
 the poorest 200 counties in China annually through
 1990, and an additional 300 million yuan was sched-
 uled to be lent to these areas in 1985. Articles in the
 Chinese press have even discussed the possibility of a
 personal income tax, motivated, we believe, by the
 desire to redistribute rural income.
 Several of Beijing's other long-term economic goals
 will be adversely affected by the development of rural
 enterprises. Efforts to control personal consumption
 expenditures may be more difficult because of the rise
 in disposable income and the increase in the number
 of consumer goods and services. In addition, rural
 areas probably will grow even less obedient to the
 state's one-child population control measures as farm
 labor becomes more scarce and the size of family
 farms increases.
 Parallel Concern Over Social Control
 The problems with unplanned and unbalanced eco-
 nomic production are perhaps symptomatic of an
 equally dangerous problem for Beijing-that of a
 growing, or at least more visible, unwillingness among
 peasants to subordinate personal interests. From early
 1984 to mid-1985 the Ministry of Justice established
 more than 20,000 township law offices to handle the
 growing number of state and civil disputes. A steady
 stream of Chinese press articles is attacking economic
 crime, warning peasants of the punishment for crimi-
 nal activity, and citing the necessity of following party
 discipline and state law.
 This task has been more difficult because of the
 rapidly changing definition of economic crime. Many
 activities that were previously forbidden, such as
 nearly all rural enterprises, are encouraged. And
 sometimes the distinction between legal and illegal
 activities-allowing peasants to transport goods but
 not to make profits on sales at another location-
 remains rather nebulous.
 But many rural enterprises have clearly overstepped
 state regulations, committing a number of crimes and
 producing a myriad of counterfeit goods. Provincial
 reports are presenting an increasingly lengthy list of
 fake wines, fertilizers, watches, aluminum ingots, and
 other goods produced by rural enterprises. The State
 Economic Commission has responded to the illegal
 activity by drafting regulations such as those for
 quality control of pharmaceuticals, food hygiene, the
 standardization of boiler pressure, and the licensing of
 permits for industrial production.
 Another problem for local and provincial officials has
 been the proliferation of state loans to nonexistent
 companies. Such companies are referred to in the
 Chinese press as "briefcase" companies. The Sichuan
 party committee described in June how some brief-
 case companies had wangled loans of tens of thou-
 sands of yuan by posing as specialized households.
 Having secured loans from local banks, the borrowers
 disappeared, leaving local governments to absorb the
 loss.
 Rural industrial development also is exacerbating
 already poor relations between peasants and cadre.
 Some officials have obstructed rural enterprises be-
 cause of resentment, ideology, or simply to protect the
 state operations under their administration. In some
 cases, state-operated enterprises are unable to com-
 pete with the tax-exempt and flexible operations of
 rural industries and seek local government help to
 close them down. Policies or prices have been changed
 to protect state enterprises, angering peasants who
 believe the rules have been changed after they have

 tionally dominated by the state.
 According to Red Flag, administrators in many areas
 have begun to impose charges against wealthy peas-
 ants to solve the problem of insufficient departmental
 funds. In one county in Guangdong, peasants wishing
 to own a tractor were required to pay 29 separate fees
 to 11 departments, including maintenance fees equal
 to one-third the tractor's price. Peasants in the area
 were evidently using the tractors mainly to engage in
 transport, reaping high profits in an enterprise tradi-
 difficult and slow.
 Rural enterprises have gotten into trouble with the
 State Council on the question of tax payments. In a
 recent investigation of Hubei's 600,000 individual
 industrial and commercial operators who should have
 been paying taxes, only 370,000 had even registered
 to do so. Hunan estimated that 78 percent of the units
 and individuals in the province evaded some taxes, led
 by 92 percent of collective enterprises and an even
 higher percentage of individual traders. The Ministry
 of Finance began a nationwide inspection on taxation
 and financial affairs in August, but improvements in
 collections from rural enterprises probably will be

 ants themselves, might be difficult to put back.
 Reduced Political Control
 The detrimental effects of the rapid growth of rural
 industry have given ammunition to opponents of
 reform. The most visible attack was made by Chen
 Yun in his speech before the closing session of the
 National Party Conference in September. Chen em-
 phasized grain production, implying that the successes
 achieved there by reform are being jeopardized by the
 rapid transfer of resources to rural industry. Once out

 Chen's view is typical of that held by conservative
 economists in China who believe that central planning
 is the only way to avoid the excesses of unbalanced
 growth. In midsummer the conservatives launched a
 press attack on popular forms of credit for rural
 industrial development. Proponents of reform argued
 that all enterprises and individuals have a right to
 take deposits to run businesses, and that the bank's
 restriction on credit was blocking the free circulation
 of capital in the countryside. Fiscal conservatives
 countered with ideological opposition to unplanned
 growth, usury, and economic crime and warned that
 growth was still occurring at too rapid a pace.
 The state's divestiture of its small businesses is also
 being criticized by conservative leaders, who see
 socialist enterprises being transformed into capitalist-
 style semiprivate operations. The new organizations
 have been attacked for paying out too much in profits
 at the expense of public welfare and for changing
 their operations without permission merely to obtain
 higher profits. The central government is therefore
 belatedly drawing up regulations to govern the taxing,
 finance, pricing, and labor management of the
 state/ collective contracted enterprises. We believe it
 likely that the regulations will limit the flexibility, and
 therefore the success, of the contracted enterprises.

 measures multiply and begin taking effect.
 Beijing's Next Moves
 Despite the problems, we believe China's reformers
 have little choice but to continue their program for
 developing rural industry because of the great invest-
 ment of political capital. Rural industrial growth,
 therefore, is likely to continue to lead other sectors of
 the economy, at least through China's current five-
 year plan (1986-90). Rather than stimulate the sector
 any more, however, we believe Beijing will try to slow
 the growth of rural enterprises without retreating on
 the policies of administrative independence and price
 incentives. As a result, we believe that the growth rate
 of rural enterprises will slow in 1986 as administrative
 trying to circumvent the controls of both.
 Over the next few years, we also expect that rural
 enterprises will probably be the most fluid sector of
 the Chinese economy, rapidly changing its product
 mix and rate of growth. Of all sectors of the economy,
 rural enterprises have shown the greatest response to
 market incentives. Therefore, the sector probably will
 continue to be swayed as price, wage, and financial
 reforms are instituted for the rest of the economy.
 Beijing probably will feel its way along, trying to
 guide the sector by using a combination of financial
 and administrative controls. The delicate balance
 between the two controls will bring continuing clashes
 between the market-oriented reformers and the con-
 servative proponents of a planned economy, with
 undecided bureaucrats and businessmen at all levels
 (GATT).
 Bejing hopes to export an increasing share of the
 output of rural enterprises to earn foreign exchange
 and fuel the expansion of the sector. The products will
 compete directly with the light industrial goods of
 many of China's neighbors, vying for a share of the
 US market. China's realization that it must increas-
 ingly engage in world markets to develop its light
 industry may be contributing to Beijing's efforts to
 join international financial and trade organizations,
 such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

 Appendix
 Continuing Economic
 Constraints
 The past two years have shown that the reform
 policies will encourage growth in rural industry, but
 Beijing has yet to prove that it can control the growth
 and make the sector efficient. Several economic bot-
 tlenecks remain to be dealt with in this area, including
 energy, technology, trade, service industries, and the
 lack of market information in China.
 Energy prices remain relatively low, and, until China
 takes the painful step of raising them, energy use will
 remain poorly distributed and inefficient. A Septem-
 ber article in People's Daily estimated that the energy
 consumed by rural industries in the year 2000 will
 reach 200 million tons of standard coal. But if the
 1984 increase in energy consumption by rural enter-
 prises continues, the estimate will be reached in
 roughly five years.
 Technology transformation in rural industries is an
 important issue to the leadership, and 1985 was the
 beginning of a two-year "sparking plan" to develop
 technology in areas of the economy where quick
 results can be expected with a minimum of invest-
 ment, such as the processing of agricultural and
 sideline products. More liberal financial rules have
 been made for enterprise investments in technology,
 and cadre leaving the military have been cited as
 contributing to the technical and management skills
 of rural industries. In reality, however, it is likely that
 technology is merely being used to get rural industries
 to hire the roughly I million soldiers who are to be
 demobilized. Far more technology is likely to be
 absorbed from heavy industry, where a small but
 growing number of urban technicians are being lured
 away by the high salaries and bonuses offered by
 rural industries.
 Trade, both domestic and international, must also be
 developed for the continued economic success of rural
 industries. To encourage domestic trade, regional
 trade centers for rural and industrial goods, which are
 basically wholesale centers, are being set up. The
 value of exports from rural businesses rose to more
 than 4.7 billion yuan in 1984, but virtually all of the
 products came from the wealthier coastal provinces.
 Import taxes established in mid-1985 suggest that
 China is becoming more serious about protecting
 some of its fledgling industries from foreign competi-
 tion. At some point in the future, China will have to
 shake itself free from its own bureaucracy and wean
 these industries from state protection if it intends to
 avoid the problems other developing countries have
 experienced in adopting import substitution policies.
 Service trades and businesses are developing rapidly
 despite strong ideological opposition in many local-
 ities. Continued expansion of the labor service indus-
 try will be necessary both to absorb labor and to
 support the development of other industries.
 industrial society.
 Information and current, reliable statistics will be
 needed if Beijing intends to use economic levers to
 control the economy. The government is taking steps
 to improve its statistical collection system, and is
 undertaking surveys to assess the number and state of
 rural enterprises currently in operation. More finan-
 cial information is also being disseminated to local
 enterprises to allow more rational production and
 marketing decisions. The fact that possibly one-fourth
 of China's peasants are illiterate, however, empha-
 sizes the difficulties that China will have in dissemi-
 nating market information, gathering equitable taxes
 from business records, and pressing toward a modern
