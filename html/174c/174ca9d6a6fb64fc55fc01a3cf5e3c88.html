 (U)   CHINA'S SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES:   LESS PROGRESS
 THAN MEETS THE EYE-1/
 Summary
 (C)   China's special economic zones once again
 are drawing fire from orthodox critics of reforms.
 Top reformers continue to support the zones but are
 echoing some of the charges.   They are pressing
 zone officials to improve management and to reduce
 smuggling and black-market currency exchange,
 activities that have flourished in the zones and
 surrounding provinces since controls over foreign
 trade were relaxed in 1979-80.
 (C)   Although the special economic zones were
 created to give China windows to the West, they
 have served the West equally well as windows to
 China.   In addition to a preview of some individual
 reforms considered by the leadership, they provide
 an indication of the direction and speed of the
 reform program.  A strong resurgence of conserva-
 tive influence in the leadership probably would
 lead to efforts to roll back some of the more con-
 troversial aspects of the special zones policy.
 (C)   Reformers remain committed to using the
 zones as an economics laboratory.   For example,
 (C) Subsequent to the drafting of this paper,
 the Chinese press on June 29 quoted Deng
 Xiaoping as telling a visiting Algerian delega-
 tion that the Shenzhen special economic zone
 was a pilot project and that its success
 remained to be proved.   Mounting criticism of
 the special zones,  particularly their level of
 corruption, may have induced Deng to moderate
 his support of the experiment.        Deng's comments
 may presage a tightening of control over busi-
 ness activity in the zones.

 foreign banks in April were authorized to operate branches in the
 zones.   Obtaining the consensus needed to conduct such experi-
 ments, however, continues to be difficult.   Implementation of two
 other measures poised to go into effect in the Shenzhen zone
 bordering Hong Kong--issuing a convertible zone currency and estab-
 lishing a customs control line between Shenzhen and the interior--
 has been delayed indefinitely.
 (C)   Visitors to the zones, especially to Shenzhen, report-
 edly are struck by the extensive construction under way.   Available
 evidence suggests that China's leaders, however, are disappointed
 with zone results, even though the zones have proved useful for
 demonstrating economic reform programs.   In particular, the zones
 have had little success in attracting technologically advanced
 industry.   Their development into the foreign exchange profit
 centers envisioned by the reformers is proceeding slowly.
 (C)   Earlier this year the government may have increased the
 amount of funds earmarked for infrastructure projects needed to
 make the zones more attractive to foreign investors.   Competition
 for foreign investment has sharpened since other coastal areas
 last year were authorized to offer concessions similar to those
 available in the special zones.  Without improvements in infra-
 structure, interest in the zones would likely wither.
 Approval of a higher budget allocation for the   25X1
 special.zones would indicate that the reform coalition is main-
 taining its influence in this area, despite the problems encoun-
 tered in developing the zones.   But slight changes in policy
 emphasis are probable.   Stronger efforts will be made to develop
 the zones as export bases, and less attention will be directed
 toward improving their role as diffusers of advanced technology.
 Current debate appears to center on the value of increasing their
 orientation toward foreign markets versus the benefits of forging
 more internal linkages.
 (C)   Although it is possible that the introduction of new
 policies to enhance the development of China's special economic
 zones may stall this year, the prospects for a retreat by the
 leadership seem remote in the near term.

 Background
 (C)   China's State Council, at the reported urging of Deng
 Xiaoping, in 1979 authorized the creation of special economic
 zones as part of a policy directed at liberalizing the foreign
 trade system and opening the economy to the West.  Four zones were
 established to spur and concentrate foreign investment.   The
 development of these zones subsequently became well publicized in
 the world press--and hotly debated in the ranks of China's leaders
 as well as by lower level party cadre.   The first major (and
 recurring) criticism was the inevitable comparison of the zones
 with the old treaty ports.
 (C)   In some respects the comparison had at least superficial
 validity.   Two special economic zones--Xiamen and Shantou--were
 designated to concentrate on developing export processing indus-
 tries and were fashioned after similar zones elsewhere in Asia.
 Xiamen and Shantou sought to attract foreign participation--partic-
 ularly by Hong Kong and overseas Chinese--in modernizing existing
 industry.   This program was counter to the deeply ingrained policy
 of self-reliance and raised concern over the possibility of
 foreign economic exploitation of Chinese labor and resources.
 The other two zones--Shenzhen on the border
 with Hong Kong and Zhuhai on the border with Macao--were scheduled
 for more diversified development.   The industrial base in those
 areas was meager, and foreign investors were encouraged to set up
 new industries.   Shenzhen and Zhuhai were to focus on production
 for export of electronics equipment, light industrial goods, and
 construction materials.   At the same time, the program called for
 development of tourism, farming, and fishing.
 (C)   All four zones offered investors low-cost labor, reduced
 rents and taxes, and scaled-down or waived customs duties.   And
 they sought to attract foreign investment in infrastructure
 projects as well as in industries that would promote exports and
 enhance technological development.   Reformers tried to quell crit-
 icism of concessions by pointing out that foreign investment was
 encouraged only on China's terms, unlike conditions prevailing
 when treaty ports were forcibly opened.

 Political considerations figured in the
 lead                  ion to open special economic zones and gave
 weight to its defense of the policy.   Emigration had been an irri-
 tant to the leadership for years.  In 1979 the residents of an
 entire commune--including cadre--had defected to Hong Kong.   Some
 officials thought that it was vital to create a prosperous area on
 the Hong Kong border if discontent and consequent out-migration
 were to be reduced.
 (C)   A demonstration of tolerance toward capitalist methods
 was another objective of the zones, partly pointed at easing
 concern in Hong Kong over the city's approaching reabsorption by
 China.   Shenzhen and Xiamen specifically were directed to increase
 contacts with Taiwan.. Chinese officials in 1983 openly invited
 Taiwan investors to participate in the special zones on the same
 terms offered foreign investors.   As recently as last year, Deng
 reportedly reaffirmed the objective of increasing contacts with
 Taiwan through trade when he held discussions with Fujian province
 officials in the Xiamen zone.
 (C)   Finally, creation of special economic zones provided
 the leadership with a laboratory where it could experiment in
 vitro with market-oriented economic reforms.   Reformers actually
 have used the zones more like a zoo and have encouraged (sometimes
 directed) unconvinced senior officials to visit and view it for
 themselves.
 (C)   The reformers'  strategy has won enough support that last
 year 14 coastal cities were authorized to offer foreign investors
 a similar set of concessions.   A 15th city received approval
 earlier this year.   More liberal policies also have been applied
 to Hainan Island and are being used to entice foreign participa-
 tion in developing several large coastal regions.
 (C)   Officials from interior provinces are lobbying effec-
 tively for expansion of their authority to offer investment
 concessions.   Consequently, as China opens to foreign invest-
 ment, much of the "specialness" of the special economic zones is
 vanishing.  The remaining distinguishing characteristic is an
 extraterritorial status, a difference that will remain nominal
 until the leadership opens customs control lines between the zones
 and the rest of China.
 Performance
 (C)   Development of the special economic zones has picked
 up momentum during the past two years, following a slow start.

 Investors initially were enthusiastic but reportedly became
 skeptical of their prospects after assessing the physical and
 legal infrastructure and encountering a cautious, bureaucratic
 attitude on the part of zone officials, according to soundings
 taken in the early 1980s by US officials in Hong Kong.   By
 mid-1982, the leadership had begun to tackle those concerns by
 investing in infrastructure projects to improve transport, power
 supply, and communications; by fleshing out laws on foreign
 investment; and by publishing regulations on the operation of the
 zones.   Most of the physical improvements  were concentrated in
 the Shenzhen zone; progress elsewhere was much less apparent.
 In 1983-84, Chinese officials redoubled efforts
 to make the zones work.   Investment in infrastructure increased
 significantly in 1983, and a fact-finding visit by Deng to Shenzhen
 in early 1984 was followed by further escalation in government
 funding for all four zones.   Deng's visit allayed concerns that
 the experiment would be short-lived, although Deng reportedly was
 troubled by slow progress.   Up to the time of his visit, stutter-
 ing economic performance and continuing opposition by conservative
 elements in the leadership reportedly had contributed to uncer-
 tainty over future government policy.
 (C)   Efforts to fill gaps in the legal code in such important
 areas as patent law have continued.   The absence of guarantees on
 patent protection and lack of recourse in cases of patent infringe-
 ment have been identified by many potential investors as primary
 factors preventing high-tech firms from setting up in China.   New
 laws covering patents and terms of foreign contracts which come
 into effect this year do not answer all of the foreign investors'
 questions, but they provide further evidence of the stability of
 China's open-door policy.
 (C)   Economic Development.  Statistical evidence on zone
 performance is incomplete and imprecise.   Yet, available figures
 provide a notion of rapid growth.   For example, last year the
 gross value of industrial and agricultural output (GVIAO) in the
 four zones reached 3.3 billion yuan, compared with 2.1 billion
 yuan in 1983.    The Shenzhen zone alone accounted for 45 percent of
 last year's turnover and more than 50 percent of the growth.   The
 Zhuhai zone, in contrast, accounted for only 12 percent of the
 turnover and 16 percent of the growth, even though GVIAO in that
 zone more than doubled.
 (C)   The industrial development of Shenzhen is used by Chinese
 officials as a showcase.   In 1983, the gross value of industrial
 output (GVIO) accounted for almost 84 percent of GVIAO; rapid

 growth last year probably raised the share of industry to about
 87-88 percent.  Much of this activity, however, reflects the pace
 of construction, not increases in production for sale outside the
 zone.   In 1983, for example, the construction sector accounted for
 more than four-fifths of turnover in industry.
 (C)   This pattern of activity probably is typical of growth
 in the other zones as well.  Investment in capital construction in
 the four zones grew more than 80 percent in 1984.   Although the
 largest portion was devoted to Shenzhen, it is likely that shares
 have remained roughly constant and that one main difference among
 the zones is variation in the scale of the building boom.
 (C)   In terms of ownership, foreign investors in Shenzhen are
 cashing in on the building boom but evidently are not contributing
 as expected to development of exports:

 Other activities                                37
 (C)   Exports from Shenzhen are said to be projected to reach
 $5.2 billion in 1990 but despite growth remain a tiny fraction
 of that figure, as illustrated in the following tabulation in
 (millions of US$):
 1980         1981          1982          1983
 11.2         10.2          15.0          21.1
 This compares with exports from Xiamen worth $120 million in 1983.
 (C)   Enterprises in Shenzhen engaging in foreign trade suf-
 fered a net loss during 1979-81; they turned a small profit in
 1982 and earned 6.6 million yuan in 1983.   Although profits report-
 edly doubled the latter amount in the first half of 1984, earnings
 still are not spectacular considering Shenzhen's location and
 relatively low labor costs.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/23: CIA-RDP93TO1142R000100250020-4
 (C)   Internal trade with China proper appears to be a more
 important component of Shenzhen's sales than exports.   In 1982,
 Shenzhen sold goods worth 460 million yuan to the rest of China,
 purchases amounted to only 125 million yuan.  While more current
 figures are unavailable, recent comments by Vice Premier Yao Yilin
 indicate that about one-third of sales by all four zones are
 exports and two-thirds are oriented toward the internal market.
 (C)   Foreign Investment.   The amount of foreign investment in
 China is exaggerated by the way the government defines it, and
 often it is further inflated in Chinese reporting.   Nonetheless,
 inclusion in Chinese data of agreements on licensing, processing,
 and compensation trade and of the potential value of investment
 agreements provides a basis for evaluating the success of the
 special zones policy in attracting and concentrating investment.
 (C)   Data on total direct foreign investment in China
 presented in Table 1, appended, are collected mainly from Chinese
 sources that sometimes conflict.  While the data at best consti-
 tute a preliminary estimate, the trends depicted in the table are
 indicative--especially the surge in investment since 1982.
 Excluding investment in joint oil exploration projects, direct
 foreign investment in 1984 increased by about $200 million.
 Between one-third and one-half of this amount probably represents
 investment in joint equity ventures and cooperative production
 agreements.   In part, the increase in investment derives from the
 improved ability of foreign firms to use joint ventures to pene-
 trate the China market.   The incentive for joint ventures was
 strengthened last year by a decision to allow repatriation of
 profits from domestic sales when internal sales of joint-venture
 products are deemed in China's interest.
 (C)   A similar breakdown of investment by type of activity
 in special economic zones is not available.   Aggregates, however,
 have been published.   By the end of 1984, pledged foreign invest-
 ment in the special economic zones reached about $4 billion,
 roughly two-fifths of the 1979-84 total for all of China.
 Realized foreign investment in the four zones since 1979 exceeded
 $800 million, about one-fifth of the total for China.   The lower
 "capture" rate in the zones compared with China as a whole prob-
 ably reflects greater pressure on zone officials to show results
 as well as exaggerated expectations on the part of some foreign
 investors.
 (C)   Shenzhen accounts for nearly 70 percent of realized
 foreign investment in special economic zones and about 15 percent

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/23: CIA-RDP93TO1142R000100250020-4
 of total realized foreign investment in China.   Nearly three-
 fifths of the investment in Shenzhen occurred during 1983-84.
 If data for Shenzhen were excluded from investment totals, the
 other three special economic zones would account for less than
 8 percent of total realized foreign investment.
 (C)   The poor showing for the other zones suggests that in
 general the special zones policy has failed to serve its invest-
 ment function.   The degree to which China has succeeded in
 concentrating foreign investment in the zones seems largely
 determined by Shenzhen's proximity to Hong Kong and efforts to
 improve facilities in the zone.   Concessions were a much less
 important factor in determining location of investment, a result
 that is consistent with analysis of the effect of tax variations
 on industrial location in other parts of the world.
 (C)   In general, the special zones policy also has failed to
 attract technology-intensive industry.   By the end of 1983, China
 had concluded, by its count, 188 agreements for joint equity
 ventures, of which 105 were keyed to the special economic zones.
 A sectoral breakdown of these agreements provided by Chinese
 sources is presented in Table 2; but these sources do not identify
 joint ventures located in the special economic zones.
 (C)   Some high-technology firms, of course, are located in
 the special zones.   For example, a microwave communications
 equipment plant is in Zhuhai and a number of electronics-related
 enterprises are located in Shenzhen.   In addition, several manu-
 facturing enterprises in Shenzhen incorporate advanced industrial
 technology, including computer-controlled production lines.
 Compared with other areas in China, however, the special zones
 have fared poorly.   An examination of 134 joint equity ventures
 concluded by mid-1984 suggests that the zones have been relatively
 unattractive (see Table 3).   An examination of location decisions
 by a subset of US and Japanese firms--a category more likely to
 promote technology--reinforces this finding.
 (C)   Two factors that reportedly disadvantage the zones in
 competition with other Chinese cities are the shortage of skilled
 labor and the lack of supportive industrial development.   These
 shortcomings will be difficult to eliminate.   Information on a
 large number of new joint venture agreements that were initialed
 in late 1984 has not yet been released, but significant change in
 the established pattern is unlikely.
 (C)   Leadership Reaction.   Some senior Chinese officials,
 evidently including those in favor of reform, again are growing

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/23: CIA-RDP93T01142R000100250020-4
 critical of the zones.  In a recent interview with foreign
 reporters, Vice Premier Yao Yilin, thought not to be one of the
 zones' staunchest supporters, aired some general criticisms in an
 ostensible defense of zone performance.   He noted that the zones
 have received construction assistance from the whole nation and
 that foreign investment in infrastructure--an original objective--
 has not been forthcoming.   Yao also took up the issue of buying
 and selling foreign currency on black markets, observing that the
 problem was particularly serious in the Shenzhen zone and in
 Guangdong and Fujian provinces.
 (C)   Gu Mu, who carries the zone portfolio in the Secre-
 tariat, recently gave zone performance a mixed review.   In an
 interview with a Hong Kong correspondent which was published in
 April, he singled out as shortcomings Shenzhen's lack of
 competitiveness compared with opportunities for foreign investment
 in the recently opened cities and such problems as issuing
 excessive credit, a falloff in foreign exchange earnings in the
 second half of 1984, and the rampant black market in currency.
 (C)   Gu Mu highlighted the zones' lack of success in attract-
 ing technologically advanced industry and indicated a shift in
 priority to put less emphasis on this objective and more on
 promoting exports.   This redirection of policy likely results from
 an early 1985 reassessment of the zones by top leaders.   Remarks
 by Gu Mu on zone progress that were published in January had given
 no hint of pending policy changes of this sort, but the redirection
 was clearly evident in late February at a conference he chaired in
 Shenzhen.
 (C)   Premier Zhao Ziyang, who is at the forefront of the
 move to open China to foreign investment and a strong proponent
 of special economic zones, also is critical of widespread corrup-
 tion in the zones and surrounding provinces.   In addressing the
 1985 National People's Congress, Zhao notably did not pursue the
 open-door theme as he did at the congress last year, even though
 some new areas will soon be authorized to grant investment
 concessions.
 Law and Order.   The government is moving to
 che'uK              .   Hainan Island was singled out last year for
 special attention because of its growing role in smuggling.
 Earlier this year, 3,000 untaxed cars imported through Hainan
 reportedly were seized in Wuhan.        More recently, the government
 published laws on foreign exchange controls and is taking steps
 to curtail currency black markets, especially in Shenzhen and in
 Guangdong province.

 (C)   Corruption in the zones for some years has been a
 favorite target of conservative critics.  Stronger government
 action in recent months may be designed to preempt the conserv-
 atives and protect zone officials from a shakeup.   Inflation in
 urban areas and declining foreign exchange reserves also may be
 prompting leaders to reimpose control over activities in the zonese
 (C)   Zone managers nonetheless are under attack, but from
 an unexpected direction.   A recent article published in a few
 influential Chinese newspapers charges the manager of the Shekou
 district--Shenzhen's.premier industrial area--with failing to
 supervise properly, overstaffing administrative positions, and
 permitting officials to enrich themselves.   The thrust of the
 criticism is that management has not kept up with the pace or kept
 faith with the spirit of reform.
 (C)   Economic Reform.   Special economic zones are continuing
 to point the way in reform of the economic system.  Reform leaders
 note improved results in production (from contract labor and piece-
 work wages) and in construction (from use of contract bidding) and
 tout them as examples of 'Shenzhen speed."  Most recently, foreign
 banks were authorized to open branches in the special zones,
 although the branches are prohibited from dealings with Chinese
 individuals and Chinese enterprises.  Admitting branches of
 foreign banks even with tight restrictions is a major step toward
 improving financial services in the zones.
 Further development of the zones is being         25X1
 frustrated by the delay in enacting two crucial measures:   the
 issuance of a convertible zone currency, and the establishment of
 a customs control line between the zones and the interior.   In
 part, the delay may reflect ideological opposition from influ-
 ential conservatives, such as Chen Yun; practical objections,
 however, appear more important.   Local officials reportedly fear
 that a customs line would harm development of the Shenzhen economy
 because of its dependence on trade with the interior.   Particu-
 larly threatened would be foreign exchange investments by
 provinces and enterprises seeking to profit from the Shenzhen
 zone's more liberal regulations.
 Indecision on the customs line is one factor    25X1
 delaying introduction of a currency--once scheduled for the
 beginning of 1985--because officials do not want this currency to
 go into surreptitious circulation in China.  Without a barrier,
 the value of Renminbi would fall rapidly relative to the value
 of the zone currency unit, and individuals and organizations
 could use zone currency to circumvent foreign exchange controls.

 Officials may also have delayed action because they perceive the
 recent decline in foreign exchange reserves as a threat to China's
 ability to support a zone currency against competition from the
 Hong Kong dollar.
 (C)   Prospects remain good that action will be taken by the
 end of 1985 on establishing the customs line at least for the
 Shenzhen zone. The zones were intended to provide an area for
 freer movement of goods and people.   Some reformers argue that the
 zones can not develop to their potential and that foreign trade
 can not flourish if the customs line is not established.
 The need for a zone currency is becoming acute
 because businesses in the zones prefer (and sometimes only accept)
 Hong Kong dollars and Chinese foreign exchange certificates.
 Those paid in Renminbi, especially party cadre, are suffering from
 an inflation driven by the inflow of foreign exchange, a situation
 which has worsened significantly since first criticized by Gu Mu
 nearly two years ago.   Strong opposition by conservatives,
 however, will likely keep the government from taking this step
 until it strengthens its control over corruption and currency
 speculations.
 Prospects
 (C)   Major changes in the government's policy toward special
 economic zones do not appear imminent, nor likely in the medium
 term.   The zones' lackluster record in obtaining key objectives,
 however, probably has tarnished the credibility of the policy, if
 not the policymakers.   Reformers are nimbly switching their strat-
 egy for China's modernization and are now focusing on upgrading
 technology in major industrial centers through licensing agree-
 ments and joint ventures.
 The orientation of the special zones remains
 an unresolved issue.   The debate centers on using them strictly as
 export centers--cut off from the rest of China--or on using them
 to speed development of less developed provinces in the interior.
 In recent years, these provinces have invested heavily in the
 zones to boost their own foreign exchange earnings.   If the prov-
 inces prevail or obtain a compromise on this issue, chances are
 slim that the zones ever will develop into export/industrial
 centers.
 (C)   Prospects for the zones are only slightly brighter if
 the leadership remains firm on the policy of developing export
 centers. The push to attract foreign investment in special

 economic zones is certain to encounter stiffening competition from
 other areas eager to modernize--especially major coastal cities
 and industrial regions--as well as from other export processing
 zones in Asia.   The special economic zones are likely to record
 only modest gains in obtaining technology-enhancing foreign
 investment if they continue to lack the added attraction of access
 to the China market, which other Chinese cities are able to offer.
 (C)  While slow progress toward attaining policy objectives
 is the most likely outlook for the medium term, it is possible
 that the development pace can accelerate and bring about a
 substantial rise in zone exports.   Success hinges on the zones
 acquiring sizable domestic investment in export-oriented industry
 along with the needed spending on infrastructure projects.
 Plans for three of the zones--Shenzhen,        25X1
 Xiamen, and Shantou--include construction of joint-venture oil
 refineries by the China Petro-Chemical Corporation and a foreign
 partner, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.   Shenzhen.
 officials already have received government approval for a refinery
 and have explored the costs of such a  ro'ect                         25X1
 The     25X1
 refinery in Shenzhen initially would process crude oil from Daqing
 and Southeast Asia, but is being built in anticipation of process-
 ing crude oil from the South China Sea once commercial production
 begins in that area.
 (C)   In the near term, the economics of locating refineries
 in the zones appears fragile because of the current oil glut,
 existing excess refinery capacity, and the expense of shipping
 crude oil for processing.   Over the longer term, the key factor is
 the development of large commercial oil finds in the South China
 Sea.   Oil exploration companies operating in that area have
 reduced their initially high expectations because of limited
 discoveries to date.   If oil is found, refineries in the zones
 could become the keystone of subsequent development.   If the South
 China Sea does not become a major producing area, the refineries
 in the zones would become another problem for the leadership--
 dressing up the landscape, but dragging down performance.
