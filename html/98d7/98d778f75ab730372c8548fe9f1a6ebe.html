 DEAN OF SYRACUSE SCHOOL
 At 39, Mr. Cleveland became dean of the
 Maxwell Graduate School of Citizenship and
 Public Affairs at Syracuse University, direct-
 ing graduate programs in economics, history,
 philosophy, political science, sociology, and
 anthropology.
 In July 1941, he married Lois W. Burton, a
 librarian.  Their children are all of college
 age: Carol Zoe was recently graduated from
 Rollins College, where Mr. Cleveland's mother
 was once dean of women; the twins, 20 years
 old, are juniors-Alan at American Univer-
 sity and Anne at Barnard. Anne is spending
 this semester in Florence, Italy, under a pro-
 gram her father devised.
 The Clevelands have a rented home on Mc-
 Kinley Street in Washington, and the Assist-
 ant          Secretary enjoys his drive at 8  a.m.
 through Rock Creek Park to the State De-
 partment "without getting involved in the
 city."
 Mr. Cleveland is an eloquent man with a
 far-ranging mind. He seems to some to have
 a touch of professorial reserve but it is soft-
 ened by a sense of humor that comes through
 in intellectual exchange.
 U.S.  OFFICIAL  SEES  U.N.  VIETNAM  ROLE-
 HARLAN CLEVELAND SAYS THAT. THANT COULD
 HELP SOLVE BERLIN PROBLEM ALSO
 (By Irving Spiegel)
 Harlan Cleveland, Assistant Secretary of
 State for International Organization Affairs,
 asserted last night that there was a role for
 the United Nations in any future settle-
 ment in Vietnam.  He also suggested that
 the "good offices" of the Secretary General,
 U Thant, could be used in the case of Berlin.
 Mr. Cleveland, comparing the Berlin and
 Vietnam problems, said that "in both cases
 the good offices of the Secretary General re-
 main available in the event the protagonists
 have anything to say to each other; and in
 both cases the United Nations might well
 have a role in supervising an agreement If
 one can be reached."
 He made his remarks' in an address pre-
 pared for delivery at a dinner of the biennial
 convention of the National Council of Jew-
 ish Women.  Delegates from various parts
 of the country attended the dinner of the
 72-year-old education and service organiza-
 tion in the delegates lounge at the United
 Nations.
 UNITED STATES SAID TO BE WILLING
 Authoritative sources in Washington have
 indicated in the past that the United States
 has always welcomed the possibility that the
 United Nations would provide a channel for
 mediation in Vietnam.  The difficulty, Wash-
 ington sources said, has been that the Hanoi
 regime has shown no willingness to end its
 aggression or to begin negotiations.
 Sources at the United Nations indicated
 that this was the first time that the State
 Department had suggested that the Secre-
 tary General might play a role in Vietnam.
 These sources said there had been efforts
 by Soviet journalists and East European dip-
 lomats to see if Mr. Thant could go to Hanoi
 to try to find a solution.
 ROLE OF DIRECT DEALING
 Mr. Thant, the sources indicated, would
 agree to go if there was some tacit agreement
 by the Soviet Union and the United States
 and if Hanoi would be willing to receive
 him.
 Another source interpreted Mr. Cleveland's
 reference to the "good offices" of the Secre-
 tary General as a sign that the State De-
 partment would do nothing to oppose a trip
 by Mr. Thant.
 Mr. Cleveland, who is known as a strong
 advocate of greater use of the United Na-
 tions for peacekeeping operations, asserted
 that  "some conflicts have not yielded to
 treatment by direct dealings among the par-
 ties."
 Berlin is "an obvious example," he said,
 ."and so-so far-is Vietnam."
 In neither case, he said, was the United
 Nations able to assume the task of enforcing
 peace.                               -
 "In neither case," he added, "has it seemed
 useful to freeze positions through public de-
 bate as long as no basis existed for a nego-
 tiated settlement among the powers mainly
 engaged."
 It was at this point that he suggested there
 was a role for the United Nations in Berlin
 and Vietnam.                        -
 "Meanwhile,"  he  added,  "in       our multi-
 plicity of machinery for containing conflict
 and building up systems for world order, the
 residual capacity for dealing with conflict
 and containing violence must reside with our
 own Armed Forces. Other peacekeeping ele-
 ments are clearly preferable to the direct use
 of American force."
 WHERE NATION'S INTEREST LIES
 He said that  the  use  of techniques of
 direct settlement was in the national interest,
 just as support "for regional peacekeeping
 institutions is in our national interest."  He
 also said that support for the United Nations
 was in the national interest.
 Earlier in the day, at the session at the
 Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the delegates urged
 amendment of the Johnson administration's
 school-aid bill, saying that the bill in its
 present form opened "the door to Involve-
 ment of sectarian educators in decisions af-
 fecting public education."
 The delegates cited the need for safeguards
 that would preclude undermining of "our
 tradition of separation of church and state."
 HOUSING BENEFITS OF THE KATE
 MAREMONT FOUNDATION
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  Mr. President, I am
 happy to bring to the attention of the
 Senate the successful efforts of the Kate
 Maremont Foundation, in Chicago, to
 rehabilitate buildings before they are
 turned into slum tenements. The work
 of this foundation, assisted by the tech-
 nical and financial resources of the
 Urban  Renewal Administration,  has
 helped Chicago's renewal program hur-
 dle one of its most vexing problems.
 When code regulations are enforced,
 many landlords will make the necessary
 repairs, and then will begin to charge
 higher rents.  The new rents force out
 the low-income tenents, who move into
 other overcrowded buildings offering low
 rents; and so the cycle continues.
 The April 11, 1965, edition of the
 Chicago Sun-Times described the work
 and results of the Kate Maremont Foun-
 dation; and I ask that the article be
 printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Apr. 11, 1965]
 REMAKING  OF  A  CITY-FOUNDATION
 NOTE.-For want of repairs and moderniza-
 tion many a Chicago building is becoming a
 tenement and many a Chicago neighborhood
 is sinking into a slum.
 Now      four  attempts  are  being made to
 break the downslide and to substitute pre-
 vention and rehabilitation for eventual slum
 clearance.
 One Is the effort of the Kate Maremont
 Foundation, another that of the Community
 Renewal Foundation.
 The other two are a new city project and
 the continuation of the city's longstanding
 program of conservation and renewal.
 If these efforts to upgrade the city's thou-
 sands of substandard and outdated buildings.
 succeed,  urban renewal  will move into a
 new and different phase.
 The Sun-Times is presenting a definitive
 -report on these new and varied efforts to
 remake a city.
 (By Ruth Moore)
 The problem was that the deterioration of
 thousands of the city's older apartments was
 enormous and seemingly -intractable.
 And when the Kate Maremont Foundation
 was established in 1963 and announced that
 it was going to undertake the rehabilitation
 of such buildings, it was about in the posi-
 tion of Jack the giant killer.        -
 Only under special circumstances had sub-
 stantial numbers of buildings been saved
 from a decline into slums, or brought back
 from those depths.
 One was in conservation areas where the
 expenditure of millions for slum clearance
 and environmental improvement opened the
 way for upgrading the other buildings.
 The  other  was  in  self-renewing  areas
 where owners were willing to pay for im-
 proving their homes.
 Elsewhere in the city buildings generally
 went only from bad to worse.
 The  Maremont    Foundation  proposed   a
 bold attack, using newly authorized 100 -per-
 cent Federal rehabilitation loans. It hoped
 to acquire about 100 buildings a year. The
 complexities of the work made this impos-
 sible, but the foundation now has rehabil-
 sated or is rehabilitating 15 buildings with
 about 1,200 units at a cost of $7 million.
 Among them are slum buildings, other
 units only shabby with age, and "The Rosen-
 wald."
 The latter, officially the Michigan Boule-
 vard Garden Apartments in the block bound-
 ed by 46th, 47th, Michigan and Wabash, was
 philanthropist Julius Rosenwald's 1930 pri-
 vate attempt to solve urban problems with
 decent housing.                       -  -
 Most  significantly,  the  foundation  has
 demonstrated that some key older buildings
 in a variety of neighborhoods can be remade
 into  livable,  modernized, code-complying
 apartments with little or no rent increase.
 The demonstration helped persuade city
 housing agencies to' move into a building-
 rescue operation as part of the renewal of
 the city.   If the process proves feasible, the
 city with its right of eminent domain and
 its  financial  resources  could  rehabilitate
 buildings a private foundation cannot han-
 dle and do it on a scale prohibited to a pri-
 vate group.
 Thus Chicago may be acquiring an effec-
 tive new tool for halting slums and rescuing
 downgrade neighborhoods.  The Sun-Times
 will report in another article on the program
 the city is organizing.
 Arnold H. Maremont established the Kate
 Maremont Foundation  in memory  of  his
 mother after he had seen the degraded con-
 dition in which thousands of welfare families
 lived.
 As former head of the Illinois Public Aid
 Commission, Maremont knew that the State
 and  Federal  Governments  in  effect  were
 spending $50 million a year or more to rent
 the slums of Chicago.
 Technically, the 90,000 welfare recipients
 in Cook County who rent private housing pay
 their own rent. Actually, the State makes
 specific rent grants.
 Though the amounts allowed are standard,
 ards,  many  welfare  recipients  can  afford
 only wornout apartments.         -
 Maremont wanted to do something about
 this housing and about other substandard
 buildings.   The  Federal  program   offering
 not-for-profit organizations 100 percent loans
 at below-market interest rates offered     an
 opportunity.                     -
 The loans provided for by the Housing Act
 actually amount to about 98 percent.       It
 'takes private funds to get projects started.

 ,The foundation provides this money and the
 initiative.
 The large loans, coupled with a low in-
 terest rate-initially the 3ye  percent the
 Government  Itself  had  to  pay for  the
 money-and repayment over a maximum of
 30 years, were designed to permit rehabili-
 tation  without                           an  increase  In rent. But
 given these aids, the rehabilitation Is ex-
 pected to pay its own way.
 Making such loans for the purchase and
 repair of derelict buildings was essentially
 a new process to the Federal Housing Ad-
 ministration.  Most  of Its  experience  was
 with new buildings.  To develop the tech-
 niques that would make the program work-
 able, FHA set up a special Chicago office
 headed by Carl D. Whitney. A staff was bor-
 rowed from other FHA offices.
 Real estate men thencame In, offering to
 sell  the  foundation  their worst  buildings
 and some others.  The FHA staff studied
 scores of them.
 Many were rejected as being beyond help.
 Small buildings with fewer than 30 units,
 poorly converted buildings and buildings in
 extremely  bad  neighborhoods  also  were
 judged impossible risks.
 Attention turned primarily to aging build-
 ings in sound neighborhoods and to build-
 ings near renewal areas, where coming de-
 velopments would give an improved struc-
 ture a chance.
 An apartment building at 3034-38 North
 Halsted became the foundation's first proj-
 ect.  Its 92 apartments faced on a green, at-
 tractive court, and they had not been abused.
 But it was clear that unless the building
 were thoroughly modernized, its days were
 numbered.
 The Maremont Foundation bought  the
 building for $350,000 and proposed to spend
 $252,800 to put it into first-class condition.
 FHA approved thetotal $602,600 loan needed.
 After a slow start, the foundation began
 rehabilitating one tier at a time. - Tenants
 were shifted to vacant units and no one had
 to leave the building.
 The apartments and building now have a
 spick-and-span look.  Paint Is fresh and the
 floors have been sanded.  The kitchen and
 baths with all their new equipment and out-
 lets compare favorably with those in new
 buildings.
 New closets provide some of the storage
 space the apartments always lacked.  The
 foundation did not try to remove partitions
 or change room sizes, though the rooms are
 small.
 And rents were Increased only about $5 a
 month.  They now average about $78 for a
 one-bedroom apartment.
 In some of the other Maremont buildings
 rents were lowered or maintained at present
 levels.
 The "stonefronts" the Maremount Foun-
 dation bought and is rehabilitating on the
 South Side provided a different test.
 The once fashionable 80-year-old row at
 1526-50 on East 85th could not have been
 in worse condition.  The original 48 units
 had been cut up into 96 and the building
 virtually had been gutted.
 The building department had found mul-
 tiple violations, and had ordered the owners
 to deconvert and make repairs that would
 have cost several hundred thousand dollars.
 Faced with this inevitability, they agreed
 to sell to the foundation for $100,000.  The
 foundation will spend $375,000 to completely
 remodel the buildings.  The $475,000 total
 was borrowed on a 100-percent loan.
 The 96 units with their crash panels and
 shared baths will be reduced to 57 apart-
 ments of 4 to 7 rooms each.  Virtually new
 baths and kitchens will be Installed, and the
 apartments thoroughly cleaned.   In addi-
 tion, the foundation will cut courts into the
 rear of the buildings to bring light and air
 to all the rooms.
 With all of this, rents will range from $90
 to $125 a month.  The Woodlawn Organiza-
 tion, a community group, will work with the
 foundation on the project and will help to
 find tenants.
 Strict code enforcement that made it pos-
 sible to buy the building for a relatively low
 figure was one factor that enabled the foun-
 dation to act.  The coming rebuilding of
 Cottage Grove between 61st and 63d and the
 further development of the South Campus
 of the University of Chicago changed the
 outlook for the neighborhood.  Both offered
 assurance of an environment in which a re-
 newed building could healthily survive for
 the 30 years of the mortgage.
 The Rosenwald offered still another test.
 The  block-square  buildings   with  their
 beautiful interior gardens had been an oasis
 in the generally forbidding area around
 them. Under the initial management of the
 late Robert R. Taylor and later, of a staff
 trained by  him,  the  buildings were well
 maintained.
 About 8 years ago the Rosenwald Foun-
 dation sold the building to private buyers.
 The buildings again were well handled, but
 by 1964 they were more than 35 years old.
 They, and the 450 units, needed major mod-
 ernization if they were to maintain their
 character.
 The foundation is buying them and plans
 to modernize them at a total cost of $2,300,-
 000.                                                                           A noble experiment  of another era
 thus will continue to fulfill Its high purposes.
 Without action the anchor buildings and
 all that- they stood for on the South Side
 might have been lost.
 The foundation has been moving slowly
 but is gaining experience.  It is now con-
 sidering a move into one of the most solidly
 built  areas  in  Chicago,  the "Canyon"  in
 Hyde Park-Kenwood.
 Both sides of Ingleside between 47th and
 48th are almost a solid mass of masonry.
 Apartments are built almost flush with the
 sidewalk and cover virtually every Inch of the
 land.  The block is one of Chicago's most
 notorious cases of overbuilding,
 The situation was bad enough when the
 apartments were their original size.  Then
 half of them were cut up Into smaller units,
 until now there are 650 units.
 Though the Canyon Is in the Hyde Park-
 Kenwood urban renewal area, it has largely
 been ignored.  To clear it would have re-
 quired the relocation of a backbreaking num-
 ber of families.
 Such a solution was rejected by the city
 department  of urban  renewal.   However,
 under the renewal program for the area the
 Canyon must be brought up to code con-
 formity.
 The Maremont Foundation has indicated
 that it would be willing to buy the buildings
 and rehabilitate them.
 Studies have shown how this might be
 accomplished.  To break up the solid mass
 and bring in light and air, the foundation
 would tear down two of the buildings on
 each side of the street.  The back half of
 two other buildings on each side would be
 razed.
 The way would then be open for a thorough
 renovation of the remaining buildings.  With
 demolition done, rehabilitation would cost
 about $1,600,000.
 Negotiations  to  purchase  the    buildings
 have foundered on the high prices asked by
 some of the absentee owners.
 The  department   of  urban  renewal     has
 the authority under the Urban Renewal Act
 to use eminent domain to buy and raze or
 rehabilitate the buildings.  State laws also
 permit the courts to disregard income from
 illegal conversions in fixing prices.   When
 this has been done in other places prices
 often have been halved.
 What will be done in the canyon has not
 been determined. Victor DeGrazia, president
 of the Maremont Foundation, said that if the
 buildings can be purchased at a realistic price
 and rehabilitated according to the proposed
 plan the area could be turned into a good,
 stable place to live.  As part of the renewed
 Hyde Park area it could have a bright future.
 The Maremont experience has shown that
 the prime requirement in rehabilitation is
 patience. DeGrazia said.  Many buildings and
 neighborhoods have to be studied before suit-
 able programs are found.
 Out of bitter experience, the Maremont
 Foundation also has learned that it cannot
 subcontract for all phases of remodeling-
 the wiring, plumbing, and all the rest. It now
 employs a general contractor who makes a
 general cost estimate and undertakes to have
 the work done for that amount.  Foundation
 and FHA inspection Insures that the work is
 done properly.
 The  further  the  foundation  goes  into
 management. DeGrazia said, the more con-
 vinced it is that it must have tenant co-
 operation.
 A staff member is being assigned to work
 with tenant councils and with the neighbor-
 hood.
 A nonprofit foundation has a special ad-
 vantage. DeGrazia believes.  He hopes that
 continued  maintenance  will  reduce  costs
 and lead to a reduction in rents.
 Experience also has shown. DeGrazia said,
 that enough buildings in any one neighbor-
 hood should be rehabilitated to produce an
 overall effect on the neighborhood. Cluster-
 ing helps.
 Above all. DeGrazia argues, the Maremont
 Foundat  n'  great experiment proves that
 rehabiliic   is possible as one way of sus-
 INADEQUATELY TRAINED
 Mr. MUNDT.  Mr. President, in a
 series of brief statements to the Senate
 over recent weeks-see pages 4059, 4751-
 4753, 5276-5281, 6382-6387, and 7599-
 7803 of the RECORD--I have attempted to
 demonstrate validity in the concept of
 the Freedom Academy bill as a most
 promising approach toward improving
 our capacity to function effectively as
 the leading non-Communist power in
 what threatens to be a generations-long
 struggle to make certain by peaceful ac-
 tions that Communist organization does
 not become the world's dominant politi-
 cal form.
 The bill, S. 1232, is sponsored by an
 extraordinarily broadly based group of
 Senators representing the entire spec-
 trum of mainstream American political
 thought ranging from liberal to con-
 servative.  They  are not a group of
 blustering professional anti-Communists.
 They are Senators basically agreed that
 this country must develop better de-
 fenses against nonmilitary aggression.
 Sponsors of the bill, besides myself, are
 Senators  CASE,  DODD,  DOUGLAS,  FONG,
 HICRENLOOPER, LAuscRE, MILLER, PROUTY,
 PROXMIRE,    SCOTT,    SMATHERS,    and
 MURPHY.
 The bill proposes, briefly, intensive
 concurrent effort of two kinds: research
 and training.  Research would concen-
 trate on an entirely new academic dish
 plane which we have largely ignored but
 which has been intensely and deter-
 minedly developed for a generation or
 more by our Communist adversaries.
 This is the field of nonmilitary aggres-
 sion-psychological  warfare,  guerrilla

 r
 operations, enervating a target society,
 and, all that goes with it.
 We do not entirely comprehend these
 processes in our own Government. As
 the principal force of resistance against
 Communist and other totalitarian non-
 military aggression, we need to compre-
 hend these processes fully and we need
 to disseminate this understanding to
 everyone who has interest in and ca-
 pacity for establishing effective defense
 against such aggression;
 So the Freedom Academy bill (S. 1232)
 proposes a training program more am-
 bitious by far than our current efforts
 and substantially different in character
 and purpose. It is a serious and com-
 prehensive effort to close the vast man-
 power training gap,existing between the
 Communists and the free world. Three
 categories of persons could participate
 in such training. First, of course, would
 be American Government personnel who
 function in the area of foreign affairs.
 These are the individuals charged with
 responsibility for our own national de-
 fense; and they should be prepared to
 recognize, to understand, and to counter-
 act nonmilitary aggression in its early
 stages when it can be counteracted with-
 out fielding an entire army to do the job.
 The second category of trainees would
 be foreign nationals, citizens of foreign
 countries who have an Interest in and
 a potential for resisting and stopping
 nonmilitary aggression against their own
 countries. We have mutual interest with
 these people. They seek to defend their
 own societies from external aggression
 and internal collapse.  We seek to pre-
 serve their countries as nonhostile en-
 tities, societies independent from Com-
 munist dominion.  Such persons would
 be government officials or private citi-
 zens in position to act effectively, given
 advantage of the sophistication it takes
 to stop professional revolutionaries, to
 defend their own societies from exter-
 nally inspired but internally conducted
 attack.
 The third category of trainees would
 be American citizens employed in non-
 Government work whose assignments
 station them abroad and who, given the
 sophistication which the Freedom Acad-
 emy could impart, could act effectively
 toward defense against nonmilitary ag-
 gression.
 The research arm of the. Institution
 would be closely coordinated with the
 training arms;. and training would be
 constantly bolstered by new understand-
 ing derived from continuing research,
 A great deal of research, I suspect,
 would, as the several extensive congres-
 sional hearings on Freedom Academy
 bills have indicated, concentrate on com-
 munication and motivation. We need to
 know more and more about what makes
 other peoples tick and we need to know
 more about how to communicate effec-
 tively and persuasively with them in ac-
 cordance with their own patterns of com-
 prehension. We need to know what our
 adversaries already know about various
 national 'Psychologies or psychological
 processes among different peoples.  Al-
 ready we know that effective motiva-
 tional stimuli vary from one people to
 another.  We need to know how they
 vary and how this information is utilized
 by our adversaries and how it can be used
 to defend the integrity of non-Commu-
 nist societies.
 Last week I attempted to demonstrate
 from the periodical press that Commu-
 nist revolutions occurring all over Africa
 are planned and coordinated by experts
 trained for nonmilitary warfare in coun
 tries which are antagonistic to our own
 interests.  Today I would like to utilize
 the periodical press to show the same
 kind of development occurring in Latin
 America.
 But no responsible person I know con-
 tends that all discontent in Latin Amer-
 ica is fomented by revolutionary activity.
 Skilled revolutionaries, rather, exploit
 discontent, turn it to their own ends.
 We need better capability to erect good
 defense against such activity.  The pro-
 fessional revolutionaries appear now to
 hold to themselves unchallenged the en-
 tire                                                                  field  of  this  effective      political
 activity.
 The Wall Street Journal of March 18,
 1965, carried a story from Guatemala
 City, written by James C. Tanner, de-
 scribing the general topic of Latin Amer-
 ican anti-government activity. Of Com-
 munist endeavors, he writes:
 Observers foresee increasing Latin Ameri-
 can terrorism * * * as Red China expands
 its revolutionary-minded ideology; the Bind
 guerrilla strategy particularly appeals  to
 younger Latin leftists.  One  indication of
 American concern is that U.S. Latin trouble-
 shooters in the State Department now get
 regular reports from U.S. Embassies on sabo-
 tage and other violence.  But terrorism is
 not the only weapon being used by Latin
 Communists.
 The Reds are pushing peasant unrest and
 seizing on such issues as the Panama Canal
 to stir up turmoil.  Though the Communists
 were unjustly blamed for starting the Pan-
 ama Canal riots in January 1964, they were
 quick to capitalize on the friction.  Since,
 a number of additional Communists have
 gone into Panama, and their hand was evi-
 dent in the student-sponsored demonstra-
 tions this past January in observance of the
 "martyrs" who died a year earlier.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the whole text of this article,
 "Latin Leftists," from the Wall Street
 Journal of March 18, 1965, appear at this
 point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 LATIN LEFTISTS-FEW AND DIVIDED, THEY STILL
 MANAGE To MAKE TROUBLE
 (By James C. Tanner)
 GUATEMALA CITY, GUATEMALA.-Minutesbe-
 fore                                                                           midnight  on  March  30,  1963,  army
 tanks rammed through a wall around Casa
 Creme, the rambling "cream house" residence
 of President Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes, leveled
 their guns at the front door and waited while
 the jaunty Ydigoras packed his bags for a
 trip into exile.
 Behind the golpe  (Latin military coup)
 was a taciturn army career colonel with a
 penchant  for  horseback  riding,  Enrique
 Peralta Azurdia. Already defense minister,
 Colonel Peralta named himself chief of gov-
 ernment and assured Guatemalans he acted
 only because Ydigoras was leading the gov-
 ernment into corruption and yielding the
 land to communism.  The 56-year-old col-
 onel today still trumpets the Red threat.
 Seated on an aging sofa in the national
 palace, he blames Castro "hoodlums" and
 Communist "bandits" for Guatemala's spas-
 modic outbreaks of terrorism.  But he con-
 fides that the military government is only a
 provisional one, that it is bringing political
 tranquility and that presidential elections
 will be held before the year's end.  He in-
 sists he will not be a candidate.  But might
 he refuse to relinquish control to the new
 President?  Yes; if the leftists win, replies
 the colonel.  "Under no circumstances will
 we permit a movement with a communistic
 tint," he says.
 Similarly, emerging political leaders in a
 growing number of the 2 dozen Latin lands
 are taking a tough, hard-line stand against
 the Reds.  While this would appear cheering
 to Uncle Sam, many like the colonel heading
 this one-time communistic country are dic-
 tators.   And                                                                                                                                   even  as  the  United ; States
 presses for democracies through such pro-
 grams as the Alliance for Progress, it's being
 increasingly saddled  politically  with  just
 the  opposite.   The  claimed  alternative is
 communism.
 The Latin far left is being fragmented by
 the Soviet-Sino split and by the fading hero
 image of Castro.  In the few countries where
 the Communist Party is not now outlawed,
 Red politicians are taking a thrashing at the
 polls.  But the leftists are growing adept at
 keeping  governments  shaky  and  forcing
 golpes.  Some  observers  of  volatile Latin
 politics insist that dictatorships are in line
 with    Communist objectives. Even if  the
 Reds can't twist' a revolt to'their own aims ,
 as they did in Cuba, it's reasoned, a military
 government that makes a mess of running
 things offers more fertile ground than a de-
 mocracy for Communist capture.
 MAKING MORE NOISE
 "The Communists, in Latin America are
 weak, but they are making more noise and
 working toward the chaos that leads to mili-
 tary takeovers," asserts Arturo Jauregui, sec-
 retary  general  of the  28 million-member
 Mexico-based Inter-American Regional Or-
 ganization       of  Workers.  A  Peruvian,  Mr.
 Jauregui   competes   against Communists
 across Latin America for control of labor
 unions.  Another Red foe, an astute Latin
 statesman, frets the day will come when
 perhaps as many as half of the Republics of
 Central and South America will be controlled
 by Communists.  The other half, he reasons,
 will be ruled by dictators who have used the
 Red threat as an excuse to take over.    .
 Latin America's Red repercussions pose
 more than just `a matter of strategic concern
 for Uncle Sam.  The United States has a
 bigger stake in this region than in any other
 area because Latin America is one of the best
 world markets for U.S. businessmen.  Amer-
 ican investments total $1 billion in Chile and
 more than $1 billion in Mexico, to cite just
 two examples.
 Communists directed from Moscow, Pei-
 ping, and Havana are after this plum.                                                                                                                                Red
 China recently proclaimed it now is in a
 position to increase the export of its ideology
 to Latin America.  In January, Pravda called
 on Latin working classes to join peasants in
 breaking the stranglehold of U.S. imperialists.
 Specific targets named in the Moscow com-
 munique  were  Panama,  Haiti,  Guatemala,
 Honduras, Colombia, Venezuela, and Para-
 guay.   Castro exports  guerrillas  to  other
 Latin countries.
 Until just a few weeks ago, Communists
 were well on the way in British Guiana to
 a solid toehold on South America's main-
 land.   Guatemala once fell to the Commu-
 nists, Cuba still is Red, of course, and Ar-
 gentina, Bolivia, and Brazil have go me close
 to capture, And despite their small num-
 bers                                                                                                                         and  growing  dissension within  their
 ranks, the Communists are getting some re-
 sults.
 There are growing hints, for example, of
 a military takeover in Colombia.  A thorny
 issue is leftist-inspired banditry. The com

 rnander of the armed forces complains In-
 creasingly of exploitation of Colombia's prob-
 lems by what he calla "unscrupulous agents
 of foreign doctrines"  President Guillermo
 Leon Valencia recently booted out his de-
 fense minister, mentioned as the likely lead-
 er cf a pending coup.
 A sticky situation also shapes up In El
 Salvador. though that tiny Central Ameri-
 can nation has fewer than 1,000 Communists
 by government count.  The trouble can be
 traced to Pablo Castillo, a physcian turned
 talented administrator. A civilian member
 of a six-man junta which seized the govern-
 ment briefly in 1960. Mr. Castillo is using
 the national university he currently heads
 as a power base for the presidency, some
 Salvadorans claim.  He's a recent visitor to
 Moscow, and set off a furor in his country
 with a proposal to bring in Russian profes-
 sors.
 Mr.  Castillo also  has labeled  Salvador's
 reformed-minded president Julio A. Rivera a
 puppet of the United States.  Through all
 the flap, President Rivera is acting with re-
 straint.  But this arouses mutterings from
 dissident elements of the military and from
 intransigent members of the oligarchy who
 want a hard-line approach to the leftist-
 leaning university.  "As a result, the most
 serious threat to the political stability of the
 country comes not from the left but the
 right," notes a foreign diplomat at San Sal-
 vador.
 If military coups should come in Colombia
 and Salvador, they would follow a path al-
 ready paved by a swift sequence of goipes
 since Colonel Peralta made his move in
 Guatemala.  The excuse of encroaching com-
 munism Is the theme even though the actual
 threat may not be clear.
 Some 17 months ago In Honduras, Col.
 Osvaldo Lopez Areilano, head of the armed
 forces, waged a brief but bloody battle to
 oust President Ramon Villeda Morales. The
 "golpe" came just 10 days before an election
 to name a successor for Villeda.  Colonel
 Lopez, who now becomes constitutional Pres-
 ident, says he acted to have the country
 from  communism.   Similar  reasons  were
 voiced by leaders of last year's revolt in
 Brazil which toppled the leftist regime of
 Joao Goulart.
 Recently in landlocked Bolivia, after Presi-
 dent Victor Paz Estenasoro courted danger by
 tangling with the Red-infiltrated tin miners'
 unions, widespread leftist-led student riots
 pushed his anti-Communist and American-
 backed government over the brink.  Heading
 the military junta which overthrew Presi-
 dent Paz: A crew-cut air force general, Rene
 Barrientos, who also is outspokenly anti-Red.
 Nicaragua has an elected president but the
 Somoza overlords still control that country;
 Ecuador is under a military junta, and a ci-
 vilian junta rules the Dominican Republic.
 REBELLION A POPULAR SPORT
 Rebellion, of course, Is the popular sport
 among Latins and not much of an excuse
 is needed to start one.  A clandestine press
 conference by a former president sparked the
 Guatemalan golpe, for example.  Though no
 Communist, Juan Jose Arevalo as president
 saw no danger from the Reds and permitted
 them to infiltrate labor and other groups.
 His successor, moreover, was dominated
 by  Communists.  Jacobo       Arbenz  Guzman
 elected  in  1951, staffed government posts
 with Reds, and Guatemala was controlled by
 Communists until a United States-backed
 insurrection chased him out.  The most re-
 cent elected president. Ydigoras. was anti-
 Communist,                                  but political  conditions grew
 chaotic under his regime.     Arevalo, in exile,
 loomed as his most likely successor.  When
 Arevalo slipped into Guatemala to outline
 his presidential campaign strategy for the
 press, the military overthrew Ydigoras in a
 bloodless coup.  Colonel Peralta justifies the
 action by characterizing Arevalo as a pro-
 Communist who would once again turn the
 country to the left.
 A new constitution now is being drafted.
 It will prohibit the reelection of a former
 president, eliminating from the running such
 exiles as Arevalo, Arbenz, and Ydigoras.
 Despitesafeguards being written into the
 constitution and Into Its laws, Guatemala
 so far hasn't been able to legislate the Com-
 munists out of existence  The Communist
 Party is Illegal, but some 1,000 active mem-
 bers continue working through a camou-
 flaged front group. Castro-trained guerrillas
 operating near Lake Izubai In the Interior
 and along the Honduras border occassionally
 machinegun an army officer, raid banana and
 rubber plantations, and sometimes, just to
 show the peasants whose side they are on,
 assassinate a landowner.
 In recent weeks, urban terrorism by Gua-
 tamalan  Reds-led  by  an  army renegade
 trained in guerrilla fighting by U.S. forces
 in Panama-has taken a new tack with tar-
 gets being U.S.-owned properties. New Year's
 Eve celebrations In Guatemala City included
 the burning of a U.S. Government garage
 along with the 23 cars in it.  A U.S. Army
 colonel has been shot at, and a U.S. Army
 building bombed.
 Observers foresee increasing Latin Amer-
 ican terrorism of this sort as Red China
 expands its revolution-minded idealogy; the
 Sino guerrilla strategy particularly appeals to
 younger Latin leftists.  One Indication of
 American concern is that U.S. Latin trouble-
 shooters in the State Department now get
 regular reports from U.S. embassies on sab-
 otage and other violence.  But terrorism is
 not the only weapon being used by Latin
 Communists.
 THE CANAL ISSUE
 The Reds are pushing peasant unrest and
 seizing on such Issues as the Panama Canal
 to stir up turmoil. Though the Communists
 were unjustly blamed for starting the Pan-
 ama Canal riots in January 1964, they were
 quick to capitalize on the friction.  Since, a
 number of additional Communists have gone
 into Panama, and their hand was evident in
 the student-sponsored demonstrations this
 past Janus" in observance of the "martyrs"
 who died a year earlier.
 The Latin Reds, however, are running into
 some sizable setbacks in their more legiti-
 mate pursuits.  Venezuela is cleaning up its
 Red-infiltrated schools, dismissing so far
 some 2.000 leftist teachers.  A potentially po-
 tent  leftist  labor movement  across Latin
 America has fallen apart.     Not the least of
 the Communist troubles        is the  Peiping-
 Moscow rift.  Notes a U.S. official long sta-
 tioned in South America: "The older Com-
 munists that were Moscow-trained are aging.
 The younger ones for awhile leaped at Castro
 as the rising star.  Now, he's out as a hero.
 and they look toward Peiping.  So really, the
 unity of the Latin Communists is shot."
 Pro-Soviet Reds still control the parties in
 most Latin lands.     But their leaders are
 mellowing.  Vicente Lombardo Toledano. an
 aging leftist who heads the Popular Socialist
 Party (PPS) in Mexico and long has been
 Moscow's chief missionary in Latin America,
 traded  out with Mexico's ruling  political
 party last year and backed anti-Communist
 Gustavo Diaz Ordaz for President.       Now
 Mr. Lombardo Toledano is a deputy, spout-
 Ing softened Marxist ideology from the con-
 gressional floor.
 In Chile's presidential election last Sep-
 tember. Communists threw all their support
 to  a  socialist,  a  popular  candidate  who
 looked like a sure winner.     He was soundly
 trounced  by  Christian  Democrat Eduardo
 Frei.    Mr.  Frei's   government     further
 strengthened its hand in congressional elec-
 tions this month by becoming the first to
 gain  an absolute  majority    in  the  lower
 house.   But experts on Latin Reds caution
 that their impact can't always be measured
 at the polls.  Frei's programs in Chile, for
 instance, are being bottled up by the Reds.
 Though most citizens back his plans to go
 into partnership with the big U.S. companies
 In Chile's copper business, the Communists
 are teaming with nationalists to accuse Frei
 of selling out to the Yankees.
 So,  despite  the  emergence  of  stanchly
 anti-Communist     leaders  in  a number of
 Latin lands, it is likely the Reds will keep
 Latin America in ferment for some time.
 Mr. MUNDT.                        Marguerite Higgins has
 also noted the increasing exploitation of
 real discontent in Latin America by pro-
 fessional revolutionists who work toward
 violent overthrow of legitimate govern-
 ments.  She has written two recent ar-
 ticles to which I will allude.  One ap-
 peared in the Washington Evening Star
 of March 22, 1965, where she quotes
 Cuba's Che Guevara as having asserted
 to an interviewer that:
 The armed fight which has already started
 in Guatemala and Colombia will develop into
 a continental movement.
 Noting the newly agreed declaration
 by 22 Latin American Communist parties
 of support and solidarity for Fidel Castro,
 Marguerite Higgins tells how Castro
 finally obtained unified support for his
 type of revolution:
 In exchange, for a Castro pledge of hands-
 off in most areas of Latin America, the hemi-
 sphere Communist parties promise "active
 aid" for violent attempts to overthrow the
 governments of Venezuela, Colombia, Guate-
 mala, Honduras, Paraguay, Haiti, and Pana-
 ma.  These countries were named in the
 Havana communique as countries where the
 "liberation movement is most likely to suc-
 ceed."
 And the professional revolutionaries are
 busily training others In their craft,
 With Soviet. Red Chinese, and North Viet-
 namese guerrilla experts already In place in
 camps near Havana, Castro now has un-
 precedented backing from the entire Com-
 munist apparatus In the hemisphere.
 There is no precedent-
 Marguerite Higgins writes-
 for such a brazen declaration of guerrilla
 warfare against sovereign nations in this
 hemisphere. ? * ? It is a measure of world
 communism's  confidence  of America's in-
 ability-or  unwillingness-to  do  anything
 about it.
 My purpose in this series of statements
 is to answer just that charge-that our
 country refuses to confront this chal-
 lenge. Establishment of something like
 the Freedom Academy, a concept which
 emerged from intensive effort and acute
 analysis, would commence improving de-
 fenses of the non-Communist world
 against nonmilitary aggression.
 I ask unanimous consent that this ar-
 ticle by Marguerite Higgins, entitled
 "United Reds Give Castro Lift," from
 the Washington Evening Star of March
 22, 1965, appear at this point in my re-
 marks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 UNITED REDS GIVE CASTRO LIFT
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 What are the Russians up to on the Carib-
 bean front of the cold war?  Is all as quiet
 south of the border as the Nation's preoccu-
 pation with Vietnam would seem to warrant?
 The answer, unfortunately, is "No."
 And the renewed cockiness of Fidel Castro
 & Co., inside Cuba and out, officials here
 concede, has a certain basis in fact.
 An example of this cockiness was the in-
 terview given In Algeria by Cuba's far-travel-
 ing guerrilla expert, Ernesto "Che" Guevara,
 who declared, "The armed fight which has

 already started in Guatemala and Colombia
 will develop into a continental movement."
 This is in line with the Cuban propaganda
 line that these two countries "will form the
 embryos for turning all of Latin America
 into a vast South Vietnam
 MOSCOW'S BLESSING
 A new reason for this Cuban cockiness is
 the declaration of support and solidarity for
 Fidel Castro wrested from representatives of
 all 22 Latin American Communist parties in
 convention assembled in Havana.  The corn-
 munique of this Havana convention was is-
 sued in late January and immediately dis-
 tributed by Tass New Agency, thus giving it
 Moscow's blessing.
 But there is far more to the communique
 than meets the casual eye.
 For one thing, it brings. a certain order
 out of the interparty bickering and chaos
 that has often been a hindrance to Latin
 American Communist Parties.
 For another, the communique of the hemi-
 sphere Communists, who are without excep-
 tion under Soviet discipline, marks the first
 time in 6 years of power that Castro has
 been able to win this group's promise of
 coordinated support, not just for himself, but
 for his export of armed violence.
 "ACTIVE  AID" OFFERED
 According to intelligence sources, Moscow
 engineered a rather remarkable compromise
 between  the  Latin  American  Communist
 Parties, who have resented Castro's meddling
 in their spheres of influence, and the Cuban
 dictator.
 In exchange for a Castro pledge of hand's-
 off in most areas of Latin America, the hemi-
 sphere Communist parties promise "active

 the                  governments  of Venezuela,  Colombia,
 Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Haiti and
 Panama.     These countries  were named in
 the Havana communique as countries where
 the "liberation movement" is most likely to
 succeed.                                  -
 The communique marks an end to the
 previous contention of the Communist par-
 ties that revolution ought to be left to locals
 inside each country and sanctions export of
 terror and revolution to certain predesig-
 .nated places.
 With Soviet, Red Chinese and North Viet-
 namese guerrilla experts already in place in
 camps near Havana, Castro now has un-
 precedented backing from the entire Com-
 munist apparatus in the hemisphere. It will
 no longer carp and protest at Cuban med-
 dling but will assist Castro.
 BAD NEWS FOR UNITED STATES
 In light of Castro's all  too substantial
 successes already, this is bad news for his
 intended victims-and for the United States.
 There is no precedent for such a brazen
 declaration  of  guerrilla warfare  against
 sovereign nations in this hemisphere.
 Unfortunately, it is not only a measure
 of Castro's cockiness : It is a measure of
 world  Communism's confidence in America's
 inability-or unwillingness-to do anything
 about it.
 Whatever became of those ringing declara-
 tions of the Cuban crisis days in which the
 United States warned it would never stand
 idly by if Castro were to persist in attempts
 to export subversion in the hemisphere?
 Mr. MUNDT. Miss Higgins continued
 a month later. She writes of the same
 developments but from the viewpoint of
 another month's consequential activities.
 And what is the situation in these threat-
 ened countries?  Violence has flared to some
 degree in all.  But the situations in Guate-
 mala and Venezuela cause the most concern.
 American officials estimate that in Guate-
 m:.la perhaps 500 well-trained terrorists are
 operating under direction from Havana where
 Soviet, Chinese, and even North Vietnamese
 experts cooperate in training Latin Ameri-
 cans in subversion.

 CASTRO ISN'T SHAKEN BY UNITED STATES
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 Fidel Castro is far from being in the corner
 into which Uncle Sam has tried to paint
 him.  In fact, in some things, he is ahead on
 points.
 This  is the most. significant conclusion
 to be drawn from careful analysis of testi-
 mony, given by top military, intelligence
 experts, and State Department officials to
 the House Inter-American Affairs Subcom-
 mittee.
 This country has hoped that policies of
 economic isolation would make Cuba impos-
 sibly expensive to support-so expensive that
 Russia would find reason to cut Castro off
 without a ruble.
 But according to John Crimmons, coordi-
 nator of Cuban affairs for the Department of
 State the situation today is that: "Despite
 apparent Soviet dissatisfaction with Cuban
 economic   performance * * * and  despite
 Soviet resentments of Cuban actions and
 attitudes, we estimate that the community
 of interest between Moscow and Havana is
 currently strong and that the reciprocal ben-
 efits of their association override their dif-
 ferences."
 Time was when the United States threat-
 ened the use of force if Fidel Castro attempt-
 ed to. export subversion.
 But the fact today is that the export of
 subversion is a fait accompli and such ex-
 perts as Ellsworth Bunker, former U.S, rep-
 resentative to the Organization of American
 States, believes that "we might well be on
 the threshold of an intensified. Communist
 effort in this hemisphere."
 "Not only has the American -threat of the
 possible use of force failed to deter Castro,
 it has failed to deter any of the hemisphere
 Communist Parties or Moscow.
 In November of last year, the Communist
 Parties of the hemisphere attended a con-
 ference in Havana at which they proclaimed
 in a communique they would coordinate ef-
 forts with Castro to overthrow by force and
 violence  ("liberate")  Venezuela,  Colombia,
 Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay,
 and Haiti.
 And what is the situation in these threat-
 ened countries?  Violence has flared to some
 degree in all.  But the situations in Guata-
 mala and Venezuela cause the most concern.
 American officials estimate that in Guata-
 mala perhaps 500 well-trained terrorists are
 operating  under  direction  from  Havana
 where Soviet, Chinese, and even North Viet-
 namese experts cooperate in training Latin
 Americans in subversion.
 In Venezuela, the important thing is that
 the guerrilla activities in the rural areas,
 which had been conspicuously on the wane,
 are now rising in Intensity.
 The capture last month in Caracas of three
 Communist  agents  carrying  $340,000  in
 American money is indicative of the high
 priority given by the Communist bloc to the
 terror and havoc spread by the so-called
 Venezuelan National Liberation Front.
 Mr. MUNDT.  Now let us look a little
 more closely how these exercises in non-
 military warfare in Latin America are
 progressing. There is an article written
 8511
 by a lieutenant colonel in the Argentine
 Army, Mr. Luis Alberto Leoni, which ap-
 peared in Military Review for January
 1965, in which one method of undercut-
 ting legitimate government is described.
 Castro's * * * uncanny psychological per-
 ception of his people and environment have
 enabled him to maintain a somewhat hyp-
 notic hold upon his admirers and fanatical
 followers.  This he has done by the simple
 expedient of using grisly beards, field uni-
 forms, and the ever present threat of "to
 the wall" as symbolic elements of the Cuban
 Communist revolution.
 Nearly all the subversive' groups which op-
 erate throughout South America wear uni-
 forms fashioned after those of their Carib-
 bean precursors.  The experience gained not
 too long ago of masses . of people inspired
 and agitated by slogans, symbols, and gaudy
 uniforms-all characteristic of fascism and
 nazism-contained lessons not  overlooked
 by  these  new traffickers  in  fervor  and.
 violence.
 This approach appeals to. the- crowd.
 Others go more directly to the individ-
 uals.
 Among the means employed by Communist
 propaganda experts * * * a special technique
 has been developed which involves the prep-
 aration and wide distribution of letters ad-
 dressed to "the fellow peasant."
 But look at the intensive work toward
 understanding the peasants to whom
 these letters are addressed before they
 are written.  Note the motivational per-
 ception.
 The technique employed in the preparation
 of these letters is proof in itself of the care-
 ful and detailed study of the . peasant and
 his environment.  The writers use a limited
 vocabulary, usually one not exceeding 500
 words.  Numerous comparisons and parables
 applicable to such typically everyday prob-
 lems as the weather and the soil, which are
 common,stock in the life relationships of
 agricultural  societies,  are  also  employed.
 'Statements like the following-taken from a
 letter which recently appeared in Brazil?
 are typical.
 "Together with your fellowmen, you are
 the one who makes up almost all of Brazil.
 You are the one who feeds the nation, while
 you go hungry yourself.  You are the one
 who clothes us, while you wear only rags.
 You  provide  the soldiers to  defend  your
 country while your country neglects you.
 You  provide  labor  and defend  the    big
 landowners who in turn exploit you.     You
 give offerings to the church, which tells you
 to be submissive and turn the other cheek
 in. the name of Christ.  But Christ himself
 was a rebel.
 And so on.  There follows talks of
 Fidel Castro, of  Mao Tse-tung,  St.
 Francis of Assisi, and Christ.
 This is powerful potion.  It is targeted
 exactly at the group to be subverted.
 Colonel Leoni says:
 It matches perfectly the intellectual level
 of the group for which it is intended, and
 in a clever manner it simultaneously pre-
 sents certain truths and falsehoods.
 And here is the warning to us in the
 United States who have failed to analyze
 nonmilitary warfare in order to prepare
 the non-Communist world to meet it.
 Colonel Leoni warns, "Right now these
 letters are not considered to present an
 immediate threat."  This is so even
 though, in diverse versions, they are
 commonly distributed throughout Latin
 America.

 tary Review of January 1965. appear at
 this point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article

 presently assigned to the general staff of the
 Argentine Army.  He is a frequent contribu-
 tor to Argentine military journals and the
 winner of several literary prizes. In addi-

 a course in counterinsurgency at the Argen-
 tine Army War College.)
 Sociological research Into the reasons for
 the tremendous popularity of the existential-
 ist theory among European youth found form
 rather than Intellectual content as the pre-
 eminent attraction which led so many to that
 particular philosophy.
 A similar conclusion could be drawn in
 connection with the support which Cuban
 Communist subversion has been obtaining
 from  certain  groups  of  Latin  American
 youths. Their reaction Is characterized by a
 subservient imitation of the outward ap-
 pearances of the Castrolte dictatorship-as If
 the mere adoption of such extravagant pos-
 tures and coarse language would promise to
 solve the numberless problems which afflict
 the American States south of the Rio Grande.
 There is no doubt that Castro's exceptional
 ability and uncanny psychological percep-
 tion of his people and environment have
 enabled him to maintain a somewhat hyp-
 notic hold upon his admirers and fanatical
 followers.  This he has done by the simple
 expedient of using grizzly beards, field uni-
 forms, and the ever-present threat of "to the
 wall" as symbolic elements of the Cuban
 Communist revolution.
 The emotional impact of these elements
 of apparent outward simplicity, but of great
 transcendence, is proved by the fact that
 nearly all the subversive groups which oper-
 ate throughout South America wear uni-
 forms fashioned after those of their Carib-
 bean precursors.  The experience gained not
 too long ago of masses of people inspired and
 agitated by slogans, symbols, and gaudy uni-
 forms-all  characteristic  of  fascism  and
 nazism-contained lessons not overlooked
 by  these new traffickers  in terror and
 violence.
 IGNORE DANGER
 Men and institutions of current demo-
 cratic regimes, who are inclined to look at
 these reactions with indifference, seem to
 ignore the explosive danger which lurks be-
 neath these demagogic efforts for the ideo-
 logical conquest of men and minds under
 the Marxist yoke.
 Among the means employed by Communist
 propaganda experts throughout the southern
 half of the South American Continent, a
 special technique has been developed which
 involves the preparation and wide distribu-
 tion                  of letters addressed to "the fellow
 peasant."
 The lexical, literary, and ideological con-
 tent of these letters is a masterpiece of con-
 vincing propaganda which seeks to move the
 very soul of the peasant by the apparent
 truth  of the  majority of the  statements
 therein.   These statements are made with
 the  obviously convert purpose of further
 transforming the peasants life of misery and
 want to one of absolute totalitarian subjec-
 tion.
 The technique employed in the prepara-
 tion of these letters is proof in itself of the
 careful and detailed study of the peasant
 and his environment.  The writers use a
 limited vocabulary, usually one not exceed-
 ing 500 words.  Numerous comparisons and    Mr. MtJNDT, Finally, for today, let us

 that is the reason why He was crucified. Like
 Christ, the good Saint Francis of Assisi of
 Italy was also like you.  Of those who are
 still living, Mao Tse-tung, of China, and Fidel
 Castro, of Cuba, won because they were like
 you and you are like them.  You were and
 you are; you are and you will continue to be."
 This technique for the conquest of the
 peasants has been quickly imitated in many
 other places of South America. Early in 1964
 a similar "letter of proclamation" was widely
 distributed among thepeasant population of
 the mountainous semijungle region of Salta,
 Argentina, near the Bolivian border, by a
 group of guerrillas whose activity was dis-
 covered in that area.
 This particular letter, titled "Proclamation
 From the Second in Command to the Com-
 rade Peasants" and issued by the Popular
 Guerrilla Army, followed the same subversive
 approach as the letter circulated In Brazil.
 It matches perfectly the intellectual level
 Of the group for which it is intended, and in
 a clever manner it simultaneously presents
 certain truths and falsehoods,  This feat is
 accomplished by making reference to actual
 persons and known facts, although the latter
 are distorted in such a subtle way that they
 become easily acceptable as unquestionably
 true. Thus, the seed of doubt is sown in the
 minds of the worker and peasant while. at the
 same time, they are offered Marxist solutions
 to their problems.
 Right now, these letters are not considered
 to present an immediate threat.  The same
 could have been said years ago about the
 Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels.
 But we must not overlook the great lessons
 to be found along the bloody and tearful
 path of history.  There is ample evidence of
 social inequalities which must first be cor-
 rected for the sake of human dignity and to
 uphold the spirit of democratic ideals,  In
 the specific can of Latin America, the action
 against Marxist subversion must be under-
 taken immediately.  This action should con-
 sist of a determined and selfless campaign
 aimed at the elimination of human misery,
 social neglect, disease. and Illiteracy.
 The people south of the Rio Grande want
 neither  pity, offerings,  demagogery,  nor
 Marxism in order to overcome these subver-
 sive trends.  They need assistance coupled
 with dignity, capable government, harmony
 between labor and management, and, above
 all. justice among men.  The placation must
 be attained now, not later when it May be
 more difficult to convince the people that
 their true environment Is not the utopian
 life of a proletarian world proffered them
 by the terror traffickers full of false promises.
 Only then will the peasant firmly realize
 that liberty and justice are the true symbols
 of a free world.  Then, also, the subversive
 letters,  leaflets, pamphlets,  proclamations,
 and other propaganda means will lack the
 conviction, the sense. and the capability to
 undermine his spirit. Then it will be pos-
 sible to talk about the true accomplishment
 of humanity-the victory of peace, human
 rights, and dignity on earth.
 surgents  who  are  following  a  prescribed
 course of violence and economic disruption.
 This pattern of guerrilla insurgency is a clear
 reflection of the  proliferating  Communist
 literature of violence-a literature deeply in-
 debted to the writings of Mao Tse-tung-
 and points to the adoption, in Venezuela, of
 the strategy of the long war, akin to the
 conflicts effectively waged in China, Algeria,
 and Vietnam.   Designed to force large num-
 bers of regular army units into antiguerrilla
 and  security  operations  throughout  the
 country and thus weaken the Government's
 ability to deal with urban rioting, terrorism,
 and barracks revolts, this strategy has al-
 ready                                                                                                  yielded  the  Communists  a  sizable
 dividend in political and social havoc.
 Their tactics are familiar. Assassina-
 tions. Executions of peasants who don't
 cooperate.   Attacks on small military
 outposts. Capture of munitions stores.
 The  real importance  of  the Venezuela
 insurgency can only be measured against
 the  increasingly  aggressive tactics  being
 adopted by the Communists in other key
 Latin American countries.
 In Cuba and Peru, just as in Venezuela,
 the Peiping line of violent insurrection pre-
 dominates, and in Ecuador, Colombia, and
 Brazil it appears to be gaining -rapidly.  In
 the Peruvian Andes, more than 250,000 In-
 dian  peasants have been organized into
 Communist-led federations to invade haci-
 endas and seize land.
 The organizers, of course, are trained
 professional revolutionaries.  Defending
 against their actions are personnel who
 largely do not recognize tactics used
 against them and who do not compre-
 hend the challenge they confront.                                                                                                     It
 would be interesting to know, Mr. Presi-
 dent, what percentage of the officer
 corps of our own State Department and
 related agencies are intimately familiar
 with the tactical and strategic writings
 of Mao Tse-tung.
 The Venezuelan Government, facing
 this Immediate challenge of warfare,
 Gall says, exhibits a curious policy of
 silence.
 The government has shown itself to be
 particularly lacking in resourcefulness when
 responding to the guerrilla Incursions, even
 where its own programsaxe at stake.
 That is, the officials responsible for
 defense do not comprehend the attack.
 Gall quotes a police chief who has
 tried fighting guerrillas:
 When we go out to hunt the guerrillas, we
 have only old Mauser rifles, no medicines,
 and no money to buy food.  We must often
 confiscate our meals from peasants ? ? *
 guerrillas usually have money to pay for
 theirs. Many peasants are abandoning their
 farms. ? - ' Our letters asking for supplies
 go unanswered.  We must arrest people to
 find out where the guerrillas are, since they
 have many agents in the countryside.
 But perhaps most intesting in this
 article is his discussion TTf the careful
 preparation   that I precedes  guerrilla
 expeditions.

 ism has been preparing an organized re-

 ica * * *. In response to this Internationale

 Ernesto "Che" Guevara, interviewed in the
 Algerian magazine Revolution Africaine, De-

 (By Norman Gall)
 SANTA CRUZ DE BUCARAL.-For 2 years now
 the successive Accion Democratica govern-
 ments of Presidents Romulo Betancourt and
 Raul Leoni have been announcing the im-
 minent annihilation of all guerrilla activity
 in Venezuela.  In his televised New Year's
 message, Leoni referred to the guerrillas as
 "some tens [decenas] of delirious noncon-
 formists" engaged In "criminal terrorist ac-
 tivities  in the cities  and  an absurd and
 impotent rebellion in certain rural zones."
 Yet, far from being destroyed, guerrilla war-
 fare has spread to wider and wider areas
 of the country during the past year.  In Tru-
 jillo and Falcon, two states where the army
 has had to be dispatched for antiguerrilla
 operations, the peasants are gripped by fear
 of reprisals from both the guerrillas and
 the army, and in all the cities and towns
 I have visited during a month in Venezuela
 the guerrillas have loomed unmistakably as
 the prime topic of conversation.
 The fact is, not only  in the  states of
 Trujillo and Falcon but elsewhere in key
 areas of the country, the Venezuelan Gov-
 ernment is now in a virtual state of war
 against guerrilla insurgents who are follow-
 ing a prescribed course of violence and eco-
 nomic disruption.  This pattern of guerrilla
 insurgency is a clear reflection of the prolif-
 erating Communist literature of violence-a
 literature deeply indebted to the writings of
 Mao Tse-tung-and points to the adoption,
 in Venezuela, of the strategy of the "longk
 war," akin to the conflicts effectively waged
 in China, Algeria, and Vietnam.  Designed
 to force large numbers of regular army units
 into antiguerrilla and security operations
 throughout the country and thus weaken the
 Government's ability to deal with urban riot-
 ing,  terrorism,  and  barracks  revolts,                                                                    this
 strategy has already yielded the Communists
 a  sizable dividend in political and social
 havoc.
 The apparent aim of the guerrillas is to
 divide Venezuela militarily during an up-
 rising.  With that end in view, there is now
 a chain of overt or incipient guerrilla activ-
 ity from the first continental outcropping of
 the Andean Mountain system near Cabure,
 about 30 miles from the Caribbean coast, all
 the way south to the Colombian frontier.
 Using the principal waterways of the region
 as their points of contact, the guerrillas in
 the mountains are able to coordinate their
 operations with those of their urban counter-
 parts, the  Unidades Tacticas  de  Combate
 (UTC),  who  function  in  a great many
 municipalities.
 The significance of these operations cannot
 be judged either by their'present strength or
 by current battle reports, which for the most
 part list only attacks on six-man police posts,
 assassinations of peasants accused of  be-
 traying the guerrillas, and assaults on mili-
 tary checkpoints on highways approaching
 the mountains.  The real importance of the
 Venezuela insurgency can only be measured
 against the increasingly aggressive tactics
 being adopted by the Communists in other
 key Latin American countries.
 In Cuba and Peru, just as in Venezuela,
 the Peiping line of violent insurrection pre-
 dominates, and in Ecuador, Colombia and
 Brazil it appears to be gaining strength rap-
 idly.  In  the  Peruvian Andes,  more  than
 250,000 Indian peasants have been organized
 into Communist-led federations to invade
 haciendas  and  seize  land.  Shipments of
 Communist arms have been entering Peru
 across the altiplano frontier with Bolivia, and
 in 1964 the Peruvian Communist Party was
 purged  to give control to its pro-Chinese
 faction; leaders who favored cooperation with
 the regime of President Fernando Belaunde
 Terry, whom the Communist organization in
 the Peruvian sierra helped elect, were ex-
 pelled.                                                                            Similarly,  in the northeast region
 of Brazil, which contains the most widely
 publicized peasant leagues in Latin Amer-
 ica, a Maoist insurgency has split the Com-
 munist Party in two.
 As an area of potential revolutionary activ-
 ity, then, the Andean highlands of Peru, Bo-
 livia and Ecuador look fertile indeed.  Com-
 prising more or less what had been the old
 Inca empire, this region forms a single geo-
 political unit whose more than 10 million
 Indian   inhabitants   have  scarcely been
 touched by Western culture.  Like the peas-
 ants of prerevolutionary China, they speak
 vernacular tongues (Quechua and Aymara)
 divorced from the official language; they are
 subject to aristocratic exploitation and re-
 pression,  deep  communal  allegiances,  and
 extreme scarcity of land among the mass
 of subsistence farmers.  Peonage and primi-
 tive farming methods continue unchanged,
 landlords collect rent in the form of labor,
 and the per capita ratio to cultivated land is
 virtually the same as that which existed in
 old China.
 The beacon for this pattern  of revolu-
 tionary activity is Cuba, which, after over-
 tures last year toward better relations with
 the United States, has begun to formulate
 what appears to be a new hard line.  "Che"
 Guevara's recent journey to Africa and Asia
 produced many statements supporting the
 Chinese attempt to divide the world into
 white and colored camps, and in Algiers he
 specifically mentioned the organization of a
 "continental front against imperialism" in
 Latin America to oppose the "Internationale
 of repression" being formed by the United
 8513
 States.  Castro himself, faced with increas-
 ing economic hardship and the possibility
 of curtailment of Soviet aid, used the oc-
 casion of his sixth anniversary in power, in
 January, to warn that Cuban Communists
 needed no meddling advice from other Com-
 munist parties-presumably a reference to
 the restraining hand of Moscow-and voiced
 faith in the ability of his people to subsist
 without foreign aid.
 But Cuba's role involves more than rhet-
 oric.  Last November 14, Venezuela's Fuer-
 zas Armadas de Liberation Nacional (FALN)
 opened its  international  headquarters  in
 Havana with    ceremonies attended  by the
 Russian, Chinese and North Vietnamese Am-
 bassadors.  In a New York interview a month
 later, Guevara declared:  "The road to the
 liberation of peoples, which will be the road
 to socialism, will go through bullets in al-
 most all countries * * *.                                                                                                                                 We have much en-
 thusiasm for the freedom fighters in Ven-
 ezuela.  We have taught some of them to ac-
 quire military knowledge."
 The majority of young Latin Americans
 now being schooled in Cuba in the tactics
 of rural and urban  guerrilla warfare are,
 in fact, Venezuelans and Colombians, and
 the insurgent movements in both countries
 remain in frequent contact across an un-
 guarded border which traditionally has been
 an open door for heavy smuggling in arms,
 cattle, and consumer goods.  Colombian guer-
 rillas have been operating for months now
 in the eastern mountain range along the
 Venezuelan frontier, and are said to have
 enlisted the  bandits of the area in their
 service.
 It  is  against this background of  rising
 guerrilla warfare along Maoist lines through-
 out Latin America that the activities of the
 Venezuelan insurgents must be seen.   Even
 in Venezuela itself, however, exact informa-
 tion about both guerrilla and antiguerrilla
 operations is not easy to come by.  Commu-
 nist journalists who remain infiltrated in
 the press, together with their still powerful,
 reactionary bosses, are alike in wanting to
 discredit  the  Accion  Democratica govern-
 ment.                                                                                                                            As a result, news of the antigovern-
 ment operations strays from secrecy to exag-
 geration to confusion.
 For example, a girlie magazine called Vene-
 zuela Graflca, owned by the rightwing Ca-
 priles chain, recently published a long pic-
 ture story eulogizing the guerrillas.  But it
 turned out that the pictures accompanying
 what were purported to be on-the-scene in-
 terviews were from another area of the coun-
 try.                                                                                                                            The magazine was suspended for print-
 ing                                                                                                                            the  story,  and  both  left  and  right
 accused the  government of  resorting to
 dictatorial methods.
 The source of a good deal of exaggerated
 reportage on guerrilla activities in INNAC,
 a news service owned by the rightwing news-
 paper El Universal, whose owner was the
 Communist-backed candidate for the presi-
 dency of the Venezuela Press Association last
 year.   Venezuela as a whole relies greatly
 on INNAC for news of the interior, though
 the organization is said to be heavily in-
 filtrated by Communists.
 The     government  further  confuses  the
 problem  by  pretending  at  times  that it
 doesn't exist.  Last October four peasants
 were kidnapped and murdered by guerrillas
 near the village of Guaramacal in the Andean
 state of Trujillo. After the bodies were ex-
 humed and identified, investigating officials
 reported the murders to Caracas, but the
 news remained a secret.  For months now
 600 troops have been engaged in antiguerrilla
 operations in Trujillo,.begun in response to
 the Guaramacal killings, yet there are no
 official reports on their activities.  In Febru-
 ary, the Caracas press reported the crash of
 an army helicopter in the Falcon state guer-
 rills zone, but denied that the helicopter
 had been brought down by ground fire.  On
 the following day, though, the Army rushed
 a company of reinforcements Into the area.

 Only last month, 30 guerrillas captured the
 police headquarters and telegraph office in
 the Falcon state town of Aracua. They sized
 a supply of weapons and ammunition, took
 over the town for 3 hours, and fled before
 any troops arrived.  The following day the
 Minister of Defense, Gen. Ramon Florencpo
 Gomez, said the guerrilla activities were "in-
 significant."
 In addition to its curious policy of silence,
 the government has shown itself to be par-
 ticularly lacking in resourcefulness when re-
 sponding to the guerrilla Incursions, even
 where its own programs are at stake.  The
 following incident provides a graphic illus-
 tration of Its ineffectiveness.
 In November there was a public execution
 carried out by the guerrillas in Tapatapa.
 about 20 miles from the village of Santa
 Cruz de Bucaral.  The trip takes 2 hours by
 jeep or 6 hours by burro-and the chilling
 winter rains often turn the dirt roads into
 swamps so that only burros can get through.
 The. roads wind through the rugged moun-
 tains and forests of Falcon state to connect
 caserios of mud-splattered adobe dwellings
 like  Tuy  and  Tapatapa  and  Macuquita,
 which do not appear on the map.
 Three years ago, the government bought a
 large hacienda at Tapatapa and  called  a
 meeting to tell the squatters that they could
 continue living on their parcelas. Without
 further ceremony or improvement, the In-
 stituto Agrarlo National added Tapatapa to
 the list of agrarian reform sites in which
 nearly 60,000 peasant families are said to
 have been "resettled" In the past 6 years.
 The secretary general of the peasant sin-
 dicato at  Tapatapa, Rodolfo Romero. was
 also the  local leader of the government's
 Accion    Democratica   Party.    Neighbors
 claimed that Romero "tried to make himself
 big" by falsely accusing his enemies of col-
 laborating with the guerrillas then being
 sought by the direction general de policia
 (Digepol, the state security police) and the
 army.  In any event, when Romero was in-
 formed that Douglas Bravo and his guer-
 rilla followers were In the neighborhood, he
 set out for the army post In Santa Cruz to
 inform the commander.
 When he arrived at the camp, another
 farm expropriated for the agrarian reform,
 the soldiers said they could not go to Tapa-
 tapa without permission from the command
 post 100 miles away.  Romero waited for the
 orders from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; they did not
 come, and he started back.
 On the lonely burro trail Romero was in-
 tercepted by guerrillas, who had been wait-
 ing for him.  They marched him back to
 Tapatapa with his hands tied behind his
 back, hung him from a tree by his armpits
 and threw broken bottles at his face to make
 him bleed.  They read an execution decree
 accusing Romero of betraying the cause of
 national liberation, then shot him as the
 whole community watched.  About 30 fam-
 ilies abandoned their parcelas In Tapatapa
 in the next few days.
 One Accion Democratica congressman from
 the area commented:  "When their leader
 dies this way, how will the others act?
 Through bribery and terror the guerrillas
 are steadily winning our peasants.  The area
 is ideal for guerrillas. It has corn, cattle,
 abundant fresh water, and many mountains
 and caves.  They are led by local boys who
 know the land far better than the army.
 The number of guerrillas in the hills is not
 important now.  What is important is the
 number of collaborators in the villages and
 firms beside the roads.
 The  guerrillas use money stolen from
 stores and factories and banks in the cities,"
 the congressman continued. '"They buy food
 from peasants at two or three times the reg-
 ular price.                    They call their robberies 'revo-
 lutionary confiscations' and give away the
 money as 'advances on revolutionary agri-
 cultural credit' which the FALN says it will
 bring them In  a future agrarian reform.
 The peasants voted for us by force of habit,
 but they are giving up hope and are co-
 operating more and more with the Com-
 munists.  When Is the Alliance for Progress
 coming  to these  mountains  to  meet  Its
 enemy?  I asked the political officer of the
 U.S. Embassy this question, and he merely
 said there already are appropriate institu-
 tions handling these problems."
 The situation of the peasants. caught In
 the crossfire of guerrilla and government
 forces,  has  now  become  extremely  grave.
 "When the army came to these mountains,
 things become rough for the peasants." said
 one farmer In Santa Cruz de Bucaral. "When
 the  guerrillas  were  relatively unknown{ a
 peasant could coexist with them, getting good
 prices for his corn and hens, though most of
 those cooperating did so for fear of being
 killed. When the army arrived the peasants
 had two governments to deal with. The dige-
 pol is very badly trained.  They often jail
 a peasant for a week or 10 days when he
 comes to give Information, so that his whole
 neighborhood knows he has informed when
 he gets back home.  The peasant then just
 stops giving information. The guerrillas pay
 for what they take and respect his women,
 while the army and the digepol often do
 neither.  To top all this, people go around
 making false accusations to the army and
 police about their neighbors to settle old
 grudges."
 The difficulties facing those assigned the
 task of suppressing the guerrillas were ex-
 plained to me by Rafael Antonio Garcia. the
 young police chief of Santa Cruz de Bucaral.
 "When we go out to hunt the guerrillas we
 only have old Mauler rifles, no medicines and
 no money to buy food," he said.  "We must
 often confiscate our meals from peasants.
 This is always a big problem, as the guerrillas
 usually have money to pay for theirs. Many
 peasants are abandoning their farms, leav-
 ing behind their animals and immovable pos-
 sessions.  The losses in crops are Incalculable:
 large  fields are abandoned with the corn
 unharvested.  Our letters asking for supplies
 go unanswered.  We must arrest people to
 find out where the guerrillas are, since they
 have many agents In the countryside.  In
 November and December we arrested 63 peas-
 ants as agents."
 Meanwhile, the guerrilla movement has
 itself given a new Impetus to the Venezuelan
 Communists, who had lately been losing
 ground.  The  violence of the  Betancourt
 years cost the Communists dearly.  Many of
 their top leaders are jailed.  Their support
 in the universities, though still strong, has
 ebbed significantly.  Their once effective in-
 filtration of the press, the teaching profes-
 sion, and the armed forces has beensome-
 what reduced.  In terms of both popular and
 organizational strength, the Communists are
 thus considerably less powerful than they
 were following the 1958 overthrow of Dictator
 Marcos Perez Jimenez-the period In which
 they enjoyed legality. Infiltration, and Influ-
 ence.  For all their lobbying, terrorism, and
 guerrilla warfare-and the prestige accrued
 from opposing the dictatorships of Perez
 Jimenez and Juan Vincente Gomez (1908-
 351-the Venezuelan Communists have yet
 to produce a leader comparable in stature to
 a Castro or a Togliatti.
 Ever since the failure of the FALN to stop
 the 1983 election, Internal memorandums of
 the  Venezuelan  Communist  Party  (VCP)
 have been full of reproaches and laments
 concerning the sad state of party organiza-
 tion.  There are, moreover, strong personal
 and ideological differences among the ex-
 tremist leaders.
 The FALN memorandum, "Our  Errors."
 describes some of its internal dimcultles as
 "Exhibitionism, which constantly leads us
 to show off ? ? ? before friends, comrades.
 and strangers, the tasks we are undertaking.
 the secrets we know ?  ?  ?.   Deviations of a
 military character [take place] when wcsub-
 stitute personal leadership for collective lead-
 ership, when we seek to demonstrate that
 we are right by raising our voice or by con-
 stantly insisting on our positions as 'chiefs.'"
 Still, the FALN record for 1964 has not
 been barren of success, and its prospects have
 been considerably brightened by the activi-
 ties of the guerrillas.  Thus, a recent memo-
 randum of the VCP Politburo outlines a "de-
 fensive situation" to last "at least 6 months,"
 with a plan consisting of the following oper-
 ations:  accelerated programs  for  training
 guerrillas abroad to take advantage of "un-
 limited" facilities offered; a campaign for
 amnesty  for  jailed insurrectionists; offers
 of a truce to the government by the VCP and
 the Marxist-Leninist Movement of the Rev-
 olutionary Left (MIR); quiet gestation of
 more guerrilla activity: and renewed efforts
 at Infiltration of the armed forces.
 In 1964 the leftist forces, even while ex-
 panding their guerrilla operations, were able
 to create a political climate propitious to
 amnesty for their jailed leaders.  Yet the
 jails, as so often is the case when they house
 political prisoners, have become schools of
 revolutionary  theory  and  tactics. Former
 Senator Pompeyo Marques, leading ideologue
 of the VCP's dominant pro-Chinese wing,
 writes his weekly column from his jail cell;
 It appears under the pseudonym "Carlos Val-
 encia" in the Communist paper Que.
 The amnesty campaign Is being spear-
 headed through pressure on President Leoni
 by two old enemies who have joined Accion
 Democratica in a government coalition-the
 Union Republicans Democratica (URD) and
 a new party led by writer-politician Arturo
 Uslar Pietri.  Both Uslar and URD have long
 records of collaboration with the Commu-
 nlats.  During the Christmas rush of pres-
 sure for                                                                                                                                      amnesty,  the jallhouse corridors
 were crowded by the comings and goings of
 leading URD and Uslarista politicians.  To
 date 33 political prisoners have been freed.
 In the 1958 elections the VCP won 160,000
 votes (8 percent of the total), which makes
 plausible a recent military estimate that
 there are 2,000 rural guerrillas and 3,000
 urban U'TC members available to the FALN,
 including those trained but not yet used.
 The new clandestine tactical manual "FALN
 Will Conquer" spells out one of the gravest
 political problems of antiguerrilla warfare
 in Latin America:  "The uncontrolled in-
 crease In the armed forces would break the
 equilibrium of forces guaranteeing the sta-
 biltty of the Government; in other words, a
 civil government cannot sustain itself in a
 Spartan  Venezuela.   When  revolutionary
 operations constantly strike the reactionary
 military vanguard, it is probable that the
 military will insist on certain political con-
 trols for 'pacification' and finally will decide
 on a coup d'etat."
 One  high-ranking  Accion  Democratica
 leader confirmed this analysis when he told
 me recently: "The real possibility of mili-
 tary overthrow of this Government is from
 the right rather than the left. It is likely
 that there will be a coup in Colombia soon
 and this could produce a strong reaction here.
 We are giving away nothing on the political
 prisoners.  URD and Uslar have promised so
 much during the election campaign on this
 that we have to let them blow off steam.  The
 few prisoners we have released mostly are
 students whose parents assured us that they
 will study at universities abroad.   We are
 being careful, and no Communist leaders
 will be released for a good while."
 Probably more significant than the size of
 guerrilla operations at this stage is the care
 with which they have been organized.  The
 first guerrilla units in Falcon and Lara States
 began functioning near the only two ham-
 lets in western Venezuela where the Commu-
 nists won a clear majority in the 1958 elec-
 tions.

 April 28, "1965           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                      8515
 Hipolito Acosta, guerrilla leader in an area
 where his father is one of the chief land-
 owners, went to Rome to study law in the
 early 1950's; he returned to his Falcon vil-
 lage of Ourimagua a declared Communist.
 His neighbors recall that in late 1950 "Polito"
 returned from a visit to Caracas with two
 youths who spent the next 2 months explor-
 ing the surrounding mountains.  Early in
 1959, groups of university students and pro-
 fesors  appeared  in  Curimagua  on  "field
 trips" to map the zone.  It was not until
 late in 1961 that the first open guerrilla ac-
 tivity began there.
 "They spend their first 6 months in the
 mountains carefully exploring the land and
 acclimatizing  themselves to  the  cold and
 rain," one Congressman from Trujillo State
 told me. "Many are university students from
 the cities and need this preparation.  After
 months of secrecy they slowly start approach-
 ing the peasants, buying provisions at high
 prices and sometimes handing out medicines.
 They say they want to liberate the country
 from Yankee imperialism and its agents, the
 leaders . of Accion Democratica.  Only when
 they are established in the countryside do
 they finally attack to draw the army into
 the zone, trying to make the peasants feel
 the Government cannot protect them and
 that there is greater security in siding with
 the guerrillas."
 One of the chief advantages in guerrilla
 operations is that the central government
 almost never recognize their importance un-
 til it is too late.  When will it be too late in
 Venezuela?  It is a nation of chronic in-
 stability-exacerbated  by  an  illegitimate
 birth rate of around 50 percent, a steady
 migration of peasants to the cities, furious
 political hatreds, and a military establish-
 ment which has let only one elected gov-
 ernment in Venezuelan history, the Betan-
 court regime, finish its constitutional term.
 In few Latin American nations, moreover,
 does there exist so dramatic a contrast be-
 tween capital and countryside as between the
 opulence of Caracas and the abysmal condi-
 tion         of  the  Venezuelan  peasantry.   The
 Betancourt regime contributed major ex-
 tensions of education and health facilities.
 Yet there are still appalling shortages of
 rural electrical and water supply installa-
 tions, schools and medical facilities.           Most
 of the scattered rural population-living in
 isolated shacks which cannot be protected
 from bands  of armed men-suffers from
 anemia, malnutrition,  and parasite infec-
 tions  which              stunt  growth  (many  male
 peasants are under five feet in height).
 Some 300,000 eligible peasant families are
 still waiting to receive land under an agrarian
 reform program which has been ineptly and
 sometimes corruptly implemented.
 Clearly, then, the governments not only of
 Venezuela but of other Latin American coun-
 tries need to realize that they are involved-
 and have been for years-in an extended
 political-military conflict.  All signs now in-
 dioate that violence will increase convulsively
 as new insurgencies go unrecognized and un-
 controlled, and efforts to establish constitu-
 tional democracy are repeatedly aborted.  In
 the past the progress of Communist insurrec-
 tion in Venezuela has been slowed by its own
 indiscriminate terrorism as well as the deter-
 mined opposition of a freely elected govern-
 ment.  After the tumultuous years (1959-64)
 of rightist and leftist insurrection against
 the Betancourt regime, the people of Vene-
 zuela are tired of violence, and yearn for
 stability.  And at the moment the Commu-
 nists  show  no  capacity  to  seize  power
 abruptly.
 But their popular strength will rise rapidly
 if the Leoni Government should lose the
 initiative in the political struggle, either
 through failure to deliver on its promises of
 social advance or by flagging in its deter-
 mination to resist Insurrection. Either course
 would heighten the  danger of a military
 coup, for which the FALN has been maneu-
 vering in order to produce a polarization in
 Venezuelan politics. The result of a rightist
 military takeover would almost certainly be a
 gruesome reenactment of the Spanish civil
 war throughout the region of the Andean
 highlands.  Thus, the outcome of this politi-
 cal struggle has implications for the United
 States as well.

 ment-of the Constitution of the United
 States.
 Mr.  MILLER.  Mr.  President,  the
 pending amendment, of which I am a
 cosponsor, should be adopted.  I find it
 ludicrous that there is any opposition
 to it at all. The arguments that have
 been offered against it are superficial,
 unresponsive, and irrelevant.  In sub-
 stance, they represent a negative attitude
 approving the status quo, which simply
 means that citizens validly casting their
 votes in elections in some areas will con-
 tinue to have their voice in Government
 canceled out by illegal votes or by votes
 which have been purchased by those who
 wish to perpetuate themselves in office.
 The amendment by the Senator from
 Delaware  [Mr.  WILLIAMS]  and myself
 simply provides as follows:
 Whoever knowingly or willfully gives false
 information as to his name, address, or pe-
 riod of residence in the voting district for
 the purpose of establishing his eligibility to
 register or vote, or conspires with another
 individual for the purpose of encouraging
 his false registration  or illegal voting, or
 pays or offers to pay or accepts payment
 either for registration or for voting shall
 be fined not more than $10,000 or Imprisoned
 not more than five years, or both.
 We believe that section 14(d) of the
 pending voting rights bill is deficient.
 First it limits its coverage to registra-
 tion and voting under this act.  There
 is no reason for limiting such coverage.
 Registration under this act or under any
 other act should be covered. There
 should be no loopholes.  We should have
 clean elections period-not clean elec-
 tions under one act and unclean elec-
 tions under some other act.  The bill
 prohibits fraudulent registration.  This
 is more difficult to prosecute than false
 registration, which is what our amend-
 ment prohibits.  What cancels out the
 registration of an honest citizen is a false
 registration-fraudulent or otherwise.
 The bill prohibits the payment for il-
 legal voting or the receipt of payment for
 illegal voting.  Our amendment prohib-
 its the payment of money for any voting,
 legal or illegal, or the receipt of payment
 therefor.    Whether the voting is legal
 or illegal, it is the payment that we seek
 to prohibit, because it is precisely this
 type of activity which corrupts the elec-
 tion process.
 In this connection, I would point out
 that the word "payment" is intended to
 be reasonably construed.  It does not
 cover giving a person a ride to the polls,
 ,for example.  It certainly does cover the
 payment of money.  If candidates for
 political office are so lacking in qualifica-
 tion that they or their supporters have
 to resort to the corruption of voters by.
 paying for their registration or voting,
 they ought to be put in jail instead of
 in office.  And if voters are so corrupt as
 to sell their vote, fairness to the honest
 and conscientious voter demands that
 they be penalized too.
 The need for this amendment is im-
 mediate and compelling.  The Senator
 from Delaware has placed in the RECORD
 various newspaper and other accounts of
 cheating at elections-dishonest and cor-
 rupt practices which have cancelled out
 the legal votes of good citizens.  I could
 spend the rest of the afternoon doing the
 same thing.  However, I shall not over-
 burden the RECORD and instead will in-
 vite the attention of my colleagues to
 just a few additional examples which cry
 out for the Congress to take action.
 In the Washington Post for April 19,
 Staff Writer Laurence Stern presents the
 story of Arkansas vote frauds where, for
 example, a migratory voter cast his bal-
 lot in at least four counties while travel-
 ing through the State last November 3.
 I ask unanimous consent that this article
 be placed in the RECORD at this point
 in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 PATTERN WIDESPREAD: ARKANSAS VOTE FRAUDS
 FOUND
 (By Laurence Stern)        -
 A migratory voter cast his ballot in at least
 four counties while traveling through north-
 west Arkansas last November 3.
 A prominent Little  Rock                                              attorney  was
 warned to get out of town by sundown when
 he asked to see public voting records in the
 home county of Gov. Orval Faubus.
 Signatures of 47 applications for absentee
 ballots from residents of an Arkansas nurs-
 ing home were -shown through handwriting
 analysis to have been forged.
 These are a few examples of what a bi-
 partisan investigating committee deemed to
 be a widespread pattern of election fraud
 in Arkansas last November 3.  A copy of the
 report by the Election Research Council, Inc.,
 was placed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD last
 Thursday by Representative MELVIN LAIRD,
 Republican, of Wisconsin.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE           Apia 28, 1965
 The council's findings resulted in a series
 of local grand jury investigations but no
 prosecution to date.  The Justice Depart-
 ment has been conducting a 2-month In-
 vestigation of voting fraud in Faubus' home
 county of Madison found no instances of
 fraud but did accuse the council of smear-
 ing honest local election officials.  A grand
 jury in Poinsett County acknowledged that
 there had been many voting irregularities
 but reported that it could not find the cul-
 prits.
 Governor Faubus, a Democrat, accused the
 council of being a tool of the Rockefeller
 political organization since roughly half of
 its funds came from Rockefeller family foun-
 dation sources.
 Winthrop Rockefeller opposed Faubus for
 the Governorship last November and got an
 unprecedented (for a Republican) 43 percent
 of the vote.
 But the chairman, John Haley, a Little
 Rock attorney, insisted that the election
 fraud  study  was  meticulously  '  ?  * as  a
 preponderant majority of the civic, business
 and church leaders who comprised its board,
 are Democrats.
 Absentee ballots, which were especially vul-
 nerable to abuse In Arkansas last year, were
 the council's main interest In its postelection
 report.
 The statewide absentee  ballot count of
 30,930 was "bloated with fraudulent and In-
 valid votes," the council reported.  On the
 basis of its own field studies the election
 group concluded that more than half of the
 absentee votes were invalid.
 Until last November, the election council
 noted, "anyone could purchase poll tax re-
 ceipts for an assortment of gravestones and
 then apply by mail for absentee ballots. The
 county clerk, seeing that the applicants were
 listed III the poll book, would then send the
 ballots and voters' statements to the desig-
 nated address.  The ballots would be re-
 turned and counted."
 Arkansas voters ratified an amendment last
 year setting up a statewide registration sys-
 tem.  Voters must now register in person and
 the poll tax has been abolished.  The council
 found nursing homes in Arkansas were used
 as a means of bloc voting.  It cited a letter
 from the president of the Arkansas Nursing
 Home Association to Its constituent members
 urging that they secure poll tax receipts for
 'each of your nursing home patients who do
 not have a poll tax receipt and ' ? ? for each
 of your employees.-
 One month after the election the Pine Bluff
 Commercial published an article pointing out
 that one nursing home paid the poll taxes of
 60 inmates, several of whom had been ad-
 judged as mental incompetents.  Absentee
 ballots mailed from the nursing home, the
 council found, deviated sharply from the rest
 of the county-with an overwhelming vote
 for Faubus as well as for a legalized gambling
 amendment and heavy opposition to the
 voter registration amendment.
 The Election Research Council report said
 that the high percentage of absentee voting
 in Faubus' home county of Madison-about
 10 percent of the total vote-indicated "that
 the absentee box in Madison County was
 manipulated for political purposes."  The 91
 percent absentee vote for Faubus contrasted
 sharply with his Madison County total of 64
 percent.
 When Chairman Haley asked the Madison
 County clerk, Charles Whorton, for permis-
 sion to inspect the public absentee voting
 lists the day after election, Wharton answered
 that the safe was locked.  Haley was then
 told to get out of town.
 Haley and Republican field workers per-
 sisted in their efforts to gain access to the
 records for more than 2 months.  Finally on
 January 14 Madison County authorities an-
 nounced that the voting records had been
 stolen the previous night.
 The FBI has been looking into the incident.
 Mr. MILLER.  In the Washington Post
 for March 12 of this year, there is a re-
 port indicating that In the April 1964
 Democratic primary in Philadelphia the
 U.S. Department of Justice found evi-
 dence of vote frauds. According to the
 advice received by U.S. Attorney D. J. T.
 O'Keefe from the Department, there was
 evidence of "conspiracy among ward
 leaders and committeemen to make false
 cancellation of returns."
 On the same day the New York Times
 ran an article by William 0. Weart on
 the same subject. I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the Times article be printed in
 the RECORD at this point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD.
 as follows:
 [From the New York Times, Mar. 12, 19651
 UNITED  STATES  CHARGES  FRAUD  IN  PHILA-
 DELPHIA DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY VOTING
 (By William G. Weart)
 PHILADELPHIA.-The  U.S. Department of
 Justice said today that unquestionably fraud
 had been committed in the reporting of elec-
 tion returns here in last April's bitter battle
 for  the Democratic senatorial nomination.
 A spokesman for the Department said there
 was "evidence of conspiracies among ward
 leaders and  committeemen  to make false
 certification of return" it, 12 of the city's 60
 wards.
 The irregularities, uncovered during a 7-
 month investigation by Government agents,
 were alleged in the contest between Justice
 Michael A. Musmanno of the State supreme
 court, the choice of the Democratic orga-
 nization, and State Secretary of Internal
 Affairs Genevieve Blatt.
 After 5 months of legal maneuvering that
 reached the State supreme court and a re-
 count of the city's 3.300 voting machines,
 Miss Blatt was certified as the winner of the
 statewide contest by a majority of 491 votes
 out of the 921,731 cast.
 In  the  November general  election  Miss
 Blatt was defeated for the Senate seat by
 the Republican Incumbent, HUGH SCOTT.
 The Justice Department Investigation cen-
 tered on "patterns" of errors in the vote tab-
 ulation and the large number of absentee
 ballots cast in certain wards of the city.
 A study of the errors in reporting returns
 showed, It was charged, that the same num-
 ber of votes subtracted from Miss Blatt's
 total In some divisions had been added to
 the vote for Justice Musmanno.
 The investigators found, for example, that
 In the first division of the 42d ward 22 votes
 were subtracted from Miss Blatt and 22 were
 added to Justice Musmanno for a net loss
 of 44 votes for Miss Blatt.
 Also in the 42d ward. 302 Democratic ab-
 sentee ballots were cast.  That represented
 one-quarter of the entire total In the city.
 The Justice Department, which has juris-
 diction because a U.S. Senate seat was at
 stake, has turned over to U.S. Attorney Drew
 J. T. O'Keefe, a 10-inch-thick file of reports
 by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
 gation and other investigators.
 Nathaniel E. Cossack, head of the Criminal
 Fraud Division of the Justice Department,
 summed                        up the information  In a 4-page
 letter that accompanied the file.  The letter
 noted it would be dlmcult to prove fraud
 although the evidence was "compelling."
 Mr. O'Keefe said be could not say what
 action might be taken until he had studied
 the voluminous file.  After he has reviewed
 the evidence, he will submit his "views and
 recommendations" to the Justice Depart-
 ment.
 Mr. MILLER.           Of course  everyone
 knows about the vote scandals in Chi-
 cago in the 1960 elections, but apparently
 there
 de,
 was some recurrence again last
 year.
 I ask unanimous consent that an
 article appearing in the Christian Sci-
 ence Monitor for November 6, 1964, be
 printed in the RECORD at this point in
 my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

 VOTE FRAUD CHARGED: EAGLE EYES IN CHICAGO
 (By Nobuo Abiko)
 CHICAGO.-As in 1960, the Democrats won
 in Chicago, and the Republicans are charg-
 ing vote fraud.
 But in 1960 Democrat John F. Kennedy
 carried the State by a tissue-thin 8,858 votes.
 This time President Johnson overwhelmed
 the Republicans by more than 800,000.
 This  difference has taken  some  of the
 urgency out of GOP charges of widespread
 voting Irregularities in this Democratic bas-
 tion.                                                                                                                                        As one  Republican  says privately,
 "When you lose by that much, what differ-
 ence does a few thousand votes make?"
 Obviously, there won't be any demand
 for a recount.  But Republicans charge that
 irregularities did occur-some right under
 their eyes.
 WATCHERS ASSIGNED
 This  year      Republicans  recruited  thou-
 sands of volunteers for poll-watching duty
 in a project dubbed Operation Eagle Eye.
 They assigned poll watchers to some 1,500
 Chicago precincts.
 Operation Eagle Eye was the biggest but
 not the only poll-watching operation in
 Chicago this year.  Others were run by the
 office of the Cook County sheriff (the sheriff
 is a Republican), the nonpartisan Citizens
 Honest Election Foundation, and the non-
 partisan Joint Civic Commission on Elec-
 tions.
 All of them report having observed numer-
 ous irregularities.
 Some eagle eyes didn't even get inside
 their  assigned  polling  place.   Other  poll
 watchers, who posed as Republicans, beat
 them to it, they protested.
 Sidney T. Holzman, Democratic chairman
 of the Chicago Board of Election Commis-
 sioners, called it "the most orderly election
 I can recall in my 45 years of public service."
 Richard  B.  Ogilvie,  Republican     Cook
 County sheriff, did not quite concur.   "A
 typical  Chicago  election,"  he  snorted,
 "widespread vote buying and illegal voting
 assistance."
 COMMISSIONER QUOTED
 Mr. Holzman remained unfazed.
 "All  precinct captains  worth their salt
 pay for votes," he was quoted as saying.
 "I've done it myself in the days when I used
 to be a precinct captain."
 When asked if he had been quoted cor-
 rectly, the election commissioner told this
 newspaper:
 "You can ask any precinct captain.  You
 gotta pay somebody to be a checker, to get
 out the vote.  Now, you don't pay them to
 violate the law.  But people are not inter-
 ested in their duties to government-I don't
 say In all but In many instances.
 "Every precinct captain is confronted with
 a family *  ?  * so he's got to utilize one
 member of the family as a political worker so
 he can get the rest of the family out to vote.
 Now if that isn't a form of solicitation, I
 don't know what Is.  It isn't actually asking
 you for compensation."
 Many of the volunteer watchers were col-
 lege students.  Said one of them: "This has
 been the most brazen and disgusting ex-
 perience of my life."
 Despite these experiences, poll-watch offi-
 cials found some grounds for satisfaction.
