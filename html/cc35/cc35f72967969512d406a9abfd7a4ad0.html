 TALKING POINTS FOR NSC MEETING ON REGIONAL AND BILATERAL ISSUES
 FOR GENEVA
 As of this point, we suspect the Soviets do not take the
 President's initiative on regional security issues serious y
 and may doubt whether the President takes it too serious y
 either.  In any case, the Administration's effort to get the
 regional issues into central focus at the summit was a failure;
 they do not appear (from what we've been able to learn) to have
 gotten much attention during Shultz-Shevardnadze-Gorbachev.
 The basie point is that the US has not, as yet, given the
 Soviets a powerful reason to back away from their adventures or
 from the formula for implanting and defending Marxi st~i ni st
 regimes.
 Arrayed against their total security effort, the total
 cost of these adventures, including economic support
 for -Cuba and Vietnam, and the military costs of
 Afghanistan, is not staggeringly large.  There is
 disgruntlement about this cost among Soviet elites and
 public, but not enough to change Soviet policy.
 More important, the risks of Soviet  olic  in the
 Third World are not great.  Although the US
 a ministration is committed in principle to supporting
 Soviet opponents and to making Moscow's policy fail,
 it is severely limited in doing so.  And it cannot
 credibly threaten threaten to raise the level of these
 conflicts to the point where Moscow must dramatically
 escalate its own actions, face a confrontation with
 the US, or get defeated.
 At the summit, the Soviets are likely to rebut US arguments
 about the evils of what they are doing by denouncing our
 policies in their terms.  They are likely to shrug off
 arguments about the dangers and risks of what they are doing
 because they doubt we can make it dangerous or risky.
 At the margin, they may show a little interest in
 "negotiated settlements" of a vague sort (not
 including the local opposition) in order to encourage
 those on our side who want to desert the various
 groups fighting them.

 Talking Points on Regional  Security Issues and the Summit
 I.   The Soviets have made it clear that they don't like the
 President's regional  conflict initiative and that they will
 continue to support their client states.
 they sent
 more AN-22 heavy transports onl
 the largest number of Soviet military transport
 aircraft to fly to Angola in one month since August 1983.
 (Cargo was military; possibly air defense equipment.)
 --They went ahead with a long planned visit by Ethiopian
 Chairman Mengistu and put him on the Lenin Mansoleum with
 the Soviet Politburo for the November 7th ceremony, the
 second time he has been accorded this honor.
 2.   During Secretary Shultz's recent trip to Moscow, Soviets
 listened quietly during US presentation on regional  conflict but
 made no response.
 --Are probably heartened by lack of vocal  international
 support for President's three-stage proposal  for ending
 conflicts in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Angola and
 Nicaragua.
 --But, they realize topic can't be avoided;
 3. Gorbachev has three options, in descending order of
 likelihood:
 A.   Deflect meaningful  talks on the issue.   Cite this
 year s talks on regional  issues between State and Soviet
 Foreign Ministry, and try to get talks back to arms
 control, or take propagandistic approach and come out
 swinging.
 B.   Recast the debate.   Offer up USSR's own set of
 "tension-reduction" proposals--which might include "code
 of conduct,"  resumption of conventional  arms transfer
 talks, Asian Collective Security Pact, nuclear-free
 zones, UN negotiations on Third World debt, global
 program for sharing high technology, etc.
 C.   Negotiate about one or more of the insurgencies
 mentioned by the President:

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5
 --Build upon the President's implicit acceptance in
 his speech of the USSR as a superpower and potential
 co-guarantor with the United States of agreements.
 --Shift the framework of discussions to one where
 acceptance would undermine the trust of our friends
 (for example Pakistan or anti-Sandinistas among
 Central  Americans) in US resolve and staying power.
 This last option would include Soviet discussion of the behavior
 and interests of their own allies, which Moscow would probably
 strongly resist.
 4.   While we think it is most likely that Soviets will  try to
 downplay and deflect the issue, the President should be prepared
 to respond to a more active attempt by Gorbachev to use the
 regional  conflict theme to promote Soviet interests.

 Regional  Issues at the November Meeting:   Gorbachev's Options
 Summary
 Moscow expects President Reagan to raise the issue of Soviet
 bloc military activity in Third World Marxist-Leninist states at
 his November meeting with General Secretary Gorbachev, and is
 preparing for this.  Soviet authorities see the President's
 three-stage proposal for resolving conflict in these countries,
 which he presented in his address to the UN General Assembly, as
 a design to shift the focus of world attention away from SDI,
 undercut the Soviet global propaganda campaign keyed to 'star
 wars" and nuclear holocaust, and justify armed aid to
 "counterrevolutionaries."  The Soviet leadership throughout the
 1980s has demonstrated a steady resolve to defend its gains in
 the states mentioned by the President--Afghanistan, Cambodia,
 Ethiopia, Angola and Nicaragua--and has viewed consolidation of
 client regimes in these countries as an essential element in
 expanding Soviet influence in the Third World.  Gorbachev is not
 deviating from this line.  While the Soviets probably believe
 that time is working in favor of consolidation of these regimes,
 they are aware of their present weaknesses and will try to ignite
 political backfires aimed at deflecting or reducing further
 outside support of anti-Marxist insurgencies.

 At the November meeting Gorbachev will have no interest in
 settling the armed conflicts in these `socialist-oriented"
 countries on the terms proposed by the President.  For tactical
 reasons it is conceivable, although unlikely, that Gorbachev
 might suggest talks--premised on entirely different terms--about
 insurgencies in Afghanistan, Angola or Nicaragua.  He will not--
 either to promote arms control. objectives or to contain the
 "costs of empire'--make significant concessions to the United
 States on Third World issues, although such considerations could
 affect his decision on whether to take a low-key approach to the
 regional conflict problem or look to score propaganda points at
 this meeting.  Conceivably he might seek to constrain the supply
 of mobile surface-to-air missiles mnd other weapon systems to
 insurgents fighting against Soviet clients.  It is possible that
 he will present "tension reduction" proposals designed to
 spotlight areas of US vulnerability and capitalize on potential
 longer-term opportunities the Soviets see to advance their
 fortunes in the Third World.
 1.   President Reagan's address to the United Nations General
 Assembly put Moscow firmly on notice that the United States
 intends at the November meeting to pursue vigorously the question
 of Soviet bloc military activity in Afghanistan, Cambodia,
 Ethiopia, Angola and Nicaragua.  This message could hardly have
 came a
 i   to Soviet  olic makers;
 Nevertheless, the Soviet press response demonstrates that the US
 move was an unwelcomed development.  Soviet authorities see this
 step as an initiative designed to shift the focus of attention
 away from SDI, undercut their global propaganda campaign keyed to
 "star wars," and pave the way for further US support of anti-
 Marxist insurgencies.  They themselves have no interest whatever
 in settling the armed conflicts in these five "Socialist-
 oriented" states on the terms proposed by the President, which
 they must read as an invitation to dismantle Soviet influence,
 abandon clients and repudiate support for Third World radicalism
 in return for more economic aid from the West.
 Marxist-Leninist Clients and Soviet Third World Policy
 2.  Consolidation of pro-Soviet Marxist-Leninist regimes in
 Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola and Nicaragua
 is an essential element of Moscow's continuing broad-gauged
 strategy for increasing its influence in the Third World and
 acquiring new political and military bases from which to expand
 Soviet influence further.   Levels of Soviet military and economic
 assistance to these regimes have fluctuated considerably over the
 past five years, with economic aid clearly being squeezed by
 declining growth of Soviet GNP.  The constant factor has been a

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5
 basic Soviet determination to make Marxist revolutions
 irreversible in these countries.   The tactical  changes made in
 each case--in levels of assistance and Soviet bloc military
 participation--have been based principally on the client's degree
 of peril and on the Kremlin's judgment of what risks the traffic
 would bear.
 3.  Soviet military assistance in recent years to client
 "Socialist-oriented" Marxist-Leninist regimes has been
 substantial:
 -- In Afghanistan, the USSR increased the number of its
 troops by 7,500 men in 1984-85 (now about 118,000) and
 has taken more forceful measures to suppress the
 insurrection's growing capabilities.  This has involved
 improved operational planning and reconnaissance, more
 direct use of Soviet ground and airpower, more aggressive
 tactics, and the dispatch during 1985 of three additional
 Spetznaz (Special  Purposes Force) battalions (bringing
 the total to seven battalions--about 4,000 men).
 -- In Cambodia, the USSR has played a key role in supporting
 Vietnamese occupation of the country.   Soviet military
 aid to Vietnam has levelled off in the past three years
 to about $600 million annually.  Without Moscow's
 extensive economic aid (an estimated $1 billion
 annually), Hanoi would have been hard pressed to maintain
 the level and intensity of its pressure in Cambodia.
 Despite the existence of certain frictions between the
 Vietnamese and the Soviets concerning Cambodia (and
 Laos), more than 100 Soviet military advisors are active
 in Cambodia.                           indicates that newer
 Soviet artillery has been made available to Vietnamese
 forces in Cambodia, and that the accuracy of Vietnamese
 artillery has noticeably improved in the past two
 years.   The Soviets have also begun providing medium
 tanks, older MIG aircraft, and small naval vessels to the
 Cambodian armed forces, and have trained Cambodian Air
 Force personnel.
 -- In Ethiopia, of the $3 billion worth of arms provided by
 the USSR since 1977, Moscow sent about $1.3 billion in
 1977-1978 and another $1.3 billion in 1983-1985--
 including modern MI-24/25 helicopters and jet fighters.
 This aid enabled the Ethiopians to mount, for the first
 time, a successful counterattack against Eritrean
 insurgents and to rapidly recapture lost territory.
 -- In Mozambique, the USSR since 1981 has supplied some
 $70T--nu million ion in military assistance.   Soviet military
 assistance rose considerably in 1983, including
 unprecedented deliveries of military equipment by air.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5       25X1
 Deliveries fell off in 1984 (probably due to Moscow's
 displeasure with Mozambique President Machel's signing of
 the Nkomati Agreement with South Africa), but they have
 increased in 1985.  This year's aid has included MI-24/25
 helicopters, tanks and APCs, patrol boats, artillery, and
 three batteries of SA-3 surface-to-air missiles.  Soviet
 economic assistance has also increased in 1985.
 -- In Angola, the Soviets have clearly beefed up their
 military support, raising their 1983 deliveries of arms
 ($582 million) to $850 million in 1984, and on occasion
 apparently commiting Soviet advisory personnel to direct
 military operations against UNITA.*  Among the more
 sophisticated weapons Moscow has supplied Luanda since
 1983 have been over 100 fighter aircraft, including MIG-
 23s and SU-22s; more than 20 MI-24/25 helicopters;
 antiaircraft systems for the creation of an integrated
 air defense over a large portion of the country; and
 large quantities of armor, transport, and ammunition.
 -- In Nicaragua, Soviet bloc military aid deliveries in 1984
 doubled over those of 1983.  Also, the nature of Soviet
 bloc military aid has expanded to include such equipment
 as MI-24/25 assault helicopters, minesweepers, and radar-
 controlled air defense guns.  There was a lull during the
 first three quarters of 1985 in the delivery of Soviet
 weapons to Nicaragua, although deliveries of Soviet
 military-associated cargoes (trucks, jeeps, and so forth)
 rose sharply over that of corresponding months in 1984.
 In October, however, a major Soviet weapons delivery to
 Nicaragua via Cuba appeared to be under way, the first
 since last November.   Nicaraguan ships shuttled back and
 forth between Cuba and Nicaragua's east coast under tight
 security.  The new weaponry probably includes more tanks,
 *Both UNITA and the South Africans claim that Luanda's recent offensive
 was planned and directed by Soviet military advisors.  As of now we have no
 firm independent confirmation of this but we find these claims credible.
 There are about 1,200 Soviet military personnel in Angola, including seven
 generals.  Soviet military advisors are attached to MPLA military formations
 down to the brigade level.  We as yet have no evidence that Soviet personnel
 have participated in ground engagements in Angola.  Likewise, we cannot
 confirm UNITA and South African statements that Soviet pilots were engaged in
 combat missions during the recent offensive, although we think it is quite
 possible.  The Soviets do have a permanently based squadron of medium-range
 air transport aircraft and crews, which daily fly transport missions for the
 Angolan military.  We believe the Soviets probably also pilot at least some of
 the 27 advanced MIG-23 fighters in Angola, with a likely primary mission of
 training Cuban and Angolan pilots.

 4.  Soviet actions over the past months have affirmed
 Gorbachev's apparent intention to protect these client regimes.
 Like his three predecessors, Gorbachev seems willing to furnish
 such military support as appears necessary--at least in the
 absence of great risk or significantly increased costs--to ensure
 their survival.   The USSR does face serious operational and
 logistical problems in conducting counterinsurgency wars at great
 distances and in unfamiliar situations, but these ventures are
 not that costly.  Soviet military assistance, while large in
 absolute terms is--except for Afghanistan--at the margin of
 existing Soviet force structure, stockpiles, and military
 production.                                                                 25X1
 5.  Despite Moscow's concern over the possibility of more
 forceful US initiatives in the Third World, the Soviet leadership
 seems to believe that the United States and others who seek to
 frustrate Soviet efforts there are hemmed in by a variety of
 constraints which, over the long run, will work against sustained
 effective opposition to Soviet aims.  At the same time, the
 Soviets probably think they will be able to profit from certain
 major trends now visible in the international environment:
 -- The fundamental shift in the regional "correlation of
 forces" in Southeast Asia that could arise with the loss
 of US bases in the Philippines--with or without a
 successful communist revolution in that country.
 -- The accelerating potential for serious revolutionary
 activity in South Africa.
 -- Growing frustration over the US role in the Middle East
 peace process and a possibly growing inclination of
 moderates in the region to accept more of a Soviet role.
 -- North/South tensions resulting from the debt problem and
 possible revolutionary upheavals, especially in Latin
 America.
 6.  The Soviets are well aware, however, of the short run
 problems of their client states:  economic crisis, incomplete
 systemic and leadership institutionalization, and military
 vulnerability to insurgent attack.  They know Washington has
 provided steadily increased support for some resistance groups
 and can see Washington is in the midst of a policy debate over
 escalation of that assistance to other insurgent groups.  The
 clear reference in the President's address to support for
 democratic resistance forces is probably read by the Kremlin as
 an accurate indication of the administration's intent to up the
 military ante in anti-Marxist insurgencies if this is politically
 feasible.

 7.  Under these circumstances, the Soviets almost certainly
 will:
 -- Attempt to continue to provide client regimes with levels
 of military assistance deemed adequate to prevent serious
 insurgent challenge to client governments.
 -- Seek to generate political pressures that will deflect
 further outside support for insurgencies in client
 states.
 -- Play for time in which to strengthen political, social
 and economic controls in t'Fese ;regimes.
 -- Try to distract world attention from the anti-Marxist
 insurgencies by focusing on areas of US vulnerability and
 Soviet opportunity.
 Runup to the November Meeting
 8.  Between now and 19 November Moscow will publicly attack
 President Reagan's proposal, strive to impose its own terms of
 reference on discussion of regional  issues at the meeting, and
 lay the groundwork for subsequent exploitation of whatever
 positio   Gorbachev advances in his talks with President
 Reagan.
 9.  Theoretically, Moscow could consider strengthening
 Gorbachev's hand in the talks by attempting to inflict a major
 military or political defeat beforehand on freedom fighters in
 one or more of its client states.  Practically, however, time is
 running out and opportunities to score such a psychological
 victory are not evident--even if Moscow did decide to risk more
 publicity for its involvement in counter-insurgency efforts and
 to expose the steel beneath its current efforts to appear
 "reasonable."
 10.   The main arenas of Soviet activity, thus, are likely to
 be propaganda and more finely tuned political influence
 operations ("active measures").  The most authoritative reaction
 to date to the President's comments on regional conflict in his
 UN address has been Gorbachev's speech of 1 November at a dinner
 for Ethiopian chief Mengistu.  Gorbachev did not address the
 President's proposals directly, but
 -- Asserted that the charge of Soviet machinations in
 Ethiopia and elsewhere in the Third World was an attempt
 to cover up US interference in these countries, obstruct
 their ties with the Soviet bloc (i.e., "hinder their free
 and independent development"), distract world attention
 from US encouragement of Israel and South Africa, and
 avoid addressing the nuclear arms control issue.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5
 -- Declared that the Soviet Union would continue to support
 Ethiopia.
 Repeated the conventional Soviet propaganda appeal for
 channeling funds saved from arms spending to Third World
 development needs.
 Approved the resolution of the organization of African
 Unity on turning Africa into a nuclear free zone and
 announced that the USSR would be prepared to observe
 Africa'a nuclear free status and serve as a guarantor of
 such a zone.
 Lesser Soviet spokesmen have stated that the USSR will be willing
 to discuss regional conflicts at the November meeting, but have
 suggested that Moscow's agenda might include US "state terrorism
 and imperialist interference in the internal affairs of other
 people," settlement of the Middle East conflict, and
 establishment of various "zones of peace" and nuclear free
 zones.
 11.  Moscow probably will wait to see how much positive
 response the President gets before deciding whether more is
 needed before the November meeting to put the United States on
 the propaganda defensive.   Thus far, the Soviets appear
 encouraged by statements from some Western leaders and Prime
 Minister Gandhi that the primary focus of the November meeting
 should be arms control, not regional conflicts.   If the
 President's proposal does not achieve much international
 resonance, the Soviets could very well decide to play it down An
 their own propaganda--hoping others will ignore it or write it
 off as simply a rhetorical maneuver.
 Soviet Behavior at the November Meeting:  Gorbachev's options
 12.
 Soviets reportedly dismissed US efforts to discuss regional
 issues in order to get the talks back to arms control.  Moscow
 realizes that, whatever it might wish, it cannot prevent the
 United States from raising the issue of regional conflict for
 discussion at the November meeting.   Gorbachev's choices revolve
 around (a) acceptance or not of any "linkage" between Soviet
 behavior in the Third World and achievement of Soviet objectives
 in the bilateral US/USSR relationship, including arms control
 agreements;  (b) whether there is anything at all to be gained
 from even discussing the possibility of negotiations over
 insurgencies in one or more of the five Soviet client states
 mentioned in the President's address;  (c) how actively to engage
 the President in talking about regional conflict; and (d)--
 looking beyond the meeting--what the best way is to turn the
 regional conflict theme against the United States.

 Linkage with the US/USSR Bilateral Relationship and Arms
 Talks
 13.   There are no compelling reasons from Moscow's
 standpoint to give up gains already achieved in the "socialist-
 oriented" countries or elsewhere in the Third World out of hopes
 of enticing Washington to agree to more favorable terms in arms
 negotiations.  Soviet America watchers would hardly feel
 confident enough to offer their leadership assurances about what
 such concessions might gain from Washington, and Gorbachev would
 probably not be able politically to-"give away the farm"--even if
 he wanted to, which he does not. -The Soviet leadership does
 recognize as a practical matter, however, that there is a
 connection between flagrant Soviet support of "national
 liberation" activities in the Third World and Congressional
 treatment of arms control issues.   For this reason it may well
 continue to exercise tactical caution in its support of, or
 conduct of, counterinsurgency efforts in its client states; and
 it may choose at the November meeting to argue that it has been
 acting prudently with respect, for example, to "provocations"
 along the Pakistan border or to military supply of Nicaragua.  If
 reminded of linkage at the November meeting by the United States
 and pressed for a commitment to future responsible behavior, the
 Soviets will probably restate their general principle of support
 for revolutionary movements.  But conceivably they might decide
 that calculated ambiguity or assertions that "revolution cannot
 be exported" could be perceived in this context by the United
 States as tacit consent to restrain specific possible future
 actions--for example, military supply of guerrillas in South
 Africa or the New Peoples' Army in the Philippines.
 Deflecting the Issue?
 14.  In previous exchanges with Western leaders Gorbachev
 has dealt with their attempts to raise Third World issues by
 merely listening and quietly reiterating Soviet positions.  He
 might do the same with the President at the November meeting.
 Alternatively, he could reaffirm agreement that the two
 countries'  foreign ministers continue and institutionalize the
 dialogue begun this year on regional issues.  The objective would
 be to terminate the discussion as quickly as possible and get
 back to arms control.   Such a strategy would help muffle the
 regional conflict theme, display Soviet "statesmanship," and
 minimize potential tensions that might arise between the USSR and
 client regimes if serious talks were initiated with the United
 States.  However, the strategy would not provide much of a
 platform for post-meeting propaganda and active measures campaigns,
 and would leave the initiative with Washington.                           25X1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5
 15.   Taking a more activist stance, Moscow might use the
 discussion of regional  issues at the meeting to score propaganda
 points against the United States while attempting to manipulate
 American unease with appearing to act hypocritically or not
 "even-handedly."  Picking up themes already in Soviet propaganda,
 Gorbachev could try to put the President off balance by directly
 accusing him of instigating "state terrorism  against regimes
 friendly to the USSR, of preparing to crank up aid to the South
 African "puppet" Savimbi, of supporting South African racism and
 aggression against its neighbors, of working with Israel against
 Arab interests, of backing military dictatorships in Chile and
 elsewhere in Latin America, or of exacerbating Third World
 tensions by deploying nuclear-armed vessels throughout the
 world.   Such an approach might win kudos for Gorbachev among
 conservative elements in the Soviet elite, but would risk
 generating unwanted controversy over Soviet bloc military
 activities in the Third World and might be seen by Soviet
 strategists as likely to spoil an atmosphere at the meeting
 otherwise more conducive to American concessions on arms control
 questions.
 Recasting the Entire Debate
 16.  An obvious option open to Gorbachev is to try to put
 the US in a "no win" position by presenting "constructive"
 "tension-reduction" proposals that are not transparently self-
 serving, but acceptance of which would constrain US military
 power projection capabilities, weaken US political influence, and
 enhance the Soviet presence in the Third World.  If Washington
 decided to accept the proposed negotiating agenda, so much the
 better from the Kremlin's standpoint.  But Moscow's main aim
 would be to position itself to (a) link US rejection of the
 proposals with US "bellicosity" in "star wars" and use this
 indictment to fan anti-Americanism in Western Europe and the
 Third World, and (b) to advance political  initiatives in the
 Third World calculated to exploit US vulnerabilities.
 17.  The statement issued by a meeting of leaders of the
 Warsaw Pact in late October, together with Gorbachev's response
 to a letter from the Club of Rome on the international arms trade
 and his 1 November speech, probably provide some clues about the
 items that would be included in such a set of "tension-reduction"
 proposals.  We might see calls for:
 -- A "code of conduct" for the Third World based on "respect
 for national  independence and sovereignty, nonuse of
 force or the threat of force, inviolability of borders,
 territorial integrity, peaceful solution of disputes,"
 etc.
 -- Resumption of the conventional arms transfer talks.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5       25X1
 An international effort to effect dismantlement of
 foreign military bases and a withdrawal of forces from
 foreign territories.
 -- The convening under UN auspices of an international
 conference on the Arab-Israeli dispute.
 -- An invitation to the US to join with the USSR in
 promoting an Asian Collective Security pact.
 -- Recognition of "zones of peace" and nuclear free zones in
 the Mediterranean, Persia-,Gulf, Africa, Indian Ocean and
 South Pacific.
 -- Approval of principles of North/South trade that paid lip
 service to the Third World's "New International Economic
 Order" initiative.
 -- Negotiations under UN auspices dealing with the Third
 World debt problem.
 -- Approval of a global program for sharing high
 technology.
 We rate the chances of the Soviets presenting some set of
 "tension-reduction" proposals at the November meeting about
 fifty-fifty.  Whatever the particular mix of proposals may be,
 the package would be designed not only to deflect attention from
 President Reagan's regional conflict agenda, but actively to
 advance longer-term strategems of capitalizing on the perceived
 opportunities noted just above.
 Negotiating One or More Conflicts Mentioned by the
 President
 18.  From Moscow's perspective, the President's proposal
 implies actions which are either in fundamental opposition to
 Soviet interests, or are unlikely to succeed:
 -- Promotion of negotiations between client Marxist regimes
 and insurgents.  The Soviets have tried but apparently
 failed to achieve negotiations in Ethiopia; they are
 probably uninterested in either having such talks or
 pressuring Cuba to engineer them in Angola and Nicaragua;
 and they are probably skeptical about the prospects of
 achieving serious talks with the Mujahedeen in
 Afghanistan, or between the two opposed Cambodian
 factions even if they wanted to pursue such a tack.
 -- Democratization of these five states.  This path would
 involve a complete reversal of efforts by the Soviets and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5
 their bloc partners to build single-party Marxist-
 Leninist systems of rule.
 -- Withdrawal of bloc military support of clients, with
 verification.   Pursuit of such a move would lead to
 collapse of client regimes in at least Afghanistan and
 Angola, serious loss of influence with Vietnam, probably
 loss of presence in Ethiopia, and major conflict with
 Cuba.
 -- Expanded trade and aid relations between client regimes
 and Western partners.  While the Soviets accept a certain
 amount of such intercourse as unavoidable and even
 desirable, their long-term objective is precisely to
 reduce the structural economic dependence of their
 clients on the West and stren then integration of those
 countries in the Soviet bloc.
 19.   Perhaps the only positive aspects of the President's
 proposal from Moscow's standpoint are its implicit acceptance of
 the USSR's role in the Third World as a superpower and potential
 co-guarantor with the United States of agreements, and acceptance
 by Washington of non-intervention principles that might constrain
 future US actions.  Conceivably those pluses, supplementing more
 concrete cost/benefit calculations (including the benefits to be
 gained from simply bein  seen to be engaged in a negotiating
 process with Washington),  im ght lead Gorbachev to explore talks
 about some of the insurgencies mentioned by the President.  It is
 difficult to imagine why Moscow would broach the subject of
 Ethiopia or Cambodia, but scenarios involving the three other
 countries are not totally implausible:
 -- Afghanistan.   The objective here would be to draw or
 create the illusion of drawing the United States into
 discussion of "guarantees" before the initiation of talks
 between the Karmal regime and the Mujahedeen, with the
 aim of eroding Pakistan's confidence in US staying power
 and Pakistani resistance to direct talks with the
 Afghans, and creating doubts among the Mujahedeen about
 the continuation of external, support.
 -- Angola.   The Soviets might restate their theoretical
 acceptance of at least partial Cuban evacuation from
 Angola in return for withdrawal of South African support
 for UNITA, combined with implementation of UN 435
 guaranteeing free elections in Namibia supervised by the
 UN.  The gain would be a probable SWAPO victory in
 Namibia; but the Soviets probably would doubt that the US
 could deliver the South Africans, and they would feel
 that the MPLA could not handle UNITA one-on-one even
 though they might be more heartened by FAPLA's
 performance in this year's offensive.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/03: CIA-RDP87B00342R000100180003-5
 -- Nicaragua/El Salvador.   Any Soviet counter-proposal  here
 would be conditioned by the need for gaining Cuban and
 Sandinista collaboration, which could well prove an
 insuperable obstacle.  No doubt the Soviets would be
 prepared to trade withdrawal of Western support for the
 Afghan freedom fighters for Soviet withdrawal of support
 from the insurgency in El Salvador.; but it is difficult
 to conceive how they would visualize such a deal being
 consummated.   The Soviets might see hints of it, however,
 as a useful  active measures tactic aimed at undercutting
 Pakistani resolve.  Similarly, while they would see
 consolidation of Sandinista power in Nicaragua as far
 more important than legitimation of limited participation
 of the FMLN in electoral  politics in El  Salvador, they
 might see hints of talks between Moscow and Washington
 about reciprocal incorporation of insurgents into the
 political process of both countries as a means of sowing
 doubt in Central America about the US commitment to El
 Salvador, and encouraging Congressional opposition to
 further US support for the contras.
 20.  The level of sophistication and destructiveness of
 weapon systems introduced into Third World conflicts is a
 question which Soviet policymakers inevitably must address.  As
 we suggest below, it is conceivable they might see some utility
 in broaching this issue on a global level in the context of a
 proposal to renew the conventional arms transfer talks.  But they
 also might see an advantage in raising the question on a regional
 basis.  As a backer of counterinsurgency warfare in the five
 countries mentioned by the President, the Soviets now have an
 obvious interest in reducing the flow to insurgents of anti-armor
 weaponry and--especially--mobile surface-to-air missiles and
 heavy machineguns capable of downing helicopters and fixed-wing
 aircraft.  The problem from the Soviet standpoint would be to
 find something to trade--openly or tacitly--for restraint on the
 part of their opponents.  It is conceivable that Soviet policy
 planners might entertain the possibility of offering to trade
 continued restraint in the bloc's supply of such weapons to
 guerrillas in El Salvador for future restraint in weapons
 available to the contras in Nicaragua.  Less plausible would be a
 Soviet attempt to gain US agreement to seek restraint in the
 types of weapons that might get to insurgents in Afghanistan or
 perhaps even in Angola by means of an offer of Bloc restraint,
 for example, in overall military delivers to Nicaragua or of
 Soviet restraint in "active pursuit" along the Pakistan border.
 It is highly unlikely that the Soviets would initiate discussion
 of US restraint anywhere in return for an understanding, however
 vague, about possible future Soviet non-supply of arms to South
 African dissidents or Communist insurgents in the Philippines.

 NIC OUTLOOK MEETING WITH DCI     NIO/USSR
 1. Once Again on Gorbachev's Game Plan:  The Summit Outlook
 By now we've said what we can, but it's worth recapping.
 Gorbachev wants a breathing space for the USSR in the form of some relief
 from the more intensely competitive behavior of the United States seen in
 the last five years, specifically:
 from our rising defense spending;
 from our more vigorous weapons development, especially SDI and new
 conventional weapons;
 from greater US engagement in regional issues;
 and from our more challenging political stance toward his system and
 its behavior.
 He wants this breathing space for two reasons:
 First, and most important, he wants to devote more economic resources
 and leadership attention, at the margin, to fixing the deep problems
 of a very unhealthy economy and society.  Doing so will. be the
 measure of his time in.power.
 Second, a breathing space like the one-sided detente of the 1970s
 would also allow the USSR to expand its influence at low cost and
 risk in the Third  or  and among   a  ies.
 Gorbachev is as yet not ready to pay anything substantial in the form of
 concessions to the US on vita  security issues -- arms control or
 regional conflicts -- or human rights. He wants a breather on the cheap,
 and believes he can get it.
 While sweeping, his arms control position is one-sided, demands great
 concessions from the US on SDI, and would take years to negotiate in
 any case.  Making his proposal involved no real concession so far.
 So far, Gorbachev has signalled no real flexibility on the re ional
 issues.  He appears determined to  ac  his Leninist clients in the
 Third World and to hang tough on Afghanistan.  With the exception of
 Afghanistan, the USSR's Third World adventures are not that costly or
 risky now.  Their real cost is the possibility that they will
 continue to inspire strong competitive behavior from the US on all
 fronts.  But this is not certain. [See Item #3 below]

 SECRET
 Gorbachev will clearly do what he can to exploit and deepen fissures
 in US alliance relationships by a more activist foreign policy.  He
 sees a detente environment as offering a favorable setting, but will
 try do this no matter what the atmosphere.
 He shows no sign of readiness to move toward liberalizing the human
 rights situation insthe USSR, except for some cosmetic gestures;
 an is pressing for more discipline out of East Europe.
 At this point, Gorbachev is not counting on specific concessions from the
 US that give him his breathing space.  At the summit, what he is after is
 an atmospheric result and a continuing political process that encourage a
 re axation of pressures from the US through other forces over the rest of
 the  rest dent s term.  He wants to convince publics, Congress, allies,
 and the President himself (if he can), that Moscow is willing to be
 reasonable, but cannot be pushed.  Coming out of Geneva, he wants all
 these parties to believe that Washington bears the main burden to make
 concessions and accommodations for the sake of bettern US- oviet
 relations.  If he can create this perception, over time the burden will
 wear down the Reagan administration and deliver a more accommodating
 president in the next election.
 As he watches the fate of defense budgets and other security issues
 in the     on ress, he sees how this can happen in the last years of
 e Reagan presidency.
 At the summit, Gorbachev will not be open to persuasion that his views
 and policies are wrong.
 Both his personality as a counterpuncher and his system run against
 his letting himself be persuaded.                     _
 On the contrary he will be out to take the measure of the President and
 to persuade him that his anti-Soviet policies are wrong and can easily be
 altered because Moscow will be forthcoming if the US makes concessions.
 Gorbachev is, indeed, likely to use the argument that Soviet domestic
 problems "prove" the Soviets will be reasonable -- if only the US
 signs up to peaceful coexistence on Soviet terms.  He did this in
 Time.
 There is not much the President can do to change Gorbachev's position at
 the summit.  His most important and achievable task is to inject doubt in
 the minds of Gorbachev and his team that they can get a cheap reathgel
 space without serious concessions, solely by playing on atmosp ere, Congress, etc.
 This places a premium on the following:
 At the summit, the President conveys confidence in the rightness of
 his policy course, in its congruence with US national interests and

 SECRETI
 the cause of peace, and in his ability to stay the course and make it
 a lasting part of American politics.
 After the summit, the President demonstrates his ability to keep his
 national security agenda on course in the Congress.
 2.  NIE on "Domestic Stresses on the Soviet System" and Implications
 As this NIE nears completion, there are still likely to be important
 arguments among NFIB agencies as to whether and just how much Soviet
 domestic, mainly economic, troubles oblige Gorbachev to hold to a flat or
 even go to a reduced level of defense spending.  Nevertheless, as of now,
 there is agreement that:
 Soviet internal troubles are deep and serious, both as regards the
 economy and the surrounding political and social environment.
 Gorbachev's likely conservative strategy for addressin  them will
 probably not make the Soviet s stem a  reat deal healthier in the
 next five years.  Even if he takes more reformist steps than we think
 likely, it will still take longer to make serious improvements.
 Moreover, many domestic intiatives (e.g., cadre replacement and
 management reform) will produce more social tension before they
 produce better system performance.
 All in all, the domestic scene is a heavier drag on the USSR's
 effectiveness as a superpower than ever.
 Nevertheless (and this goes beyond the NIE), the USSR can still field a
 lot of new military-power at.reduced--levels of defense spen in  because
 it is operating from such a-high base of production and active forces,
 and can still pursue its policies in the Third World, unless we make them
 more costly and risky.
 Thus, Gorbachev has a middle option between intensifying Soviet
 competitive effort and making concessions (which the NIE now
 mentions) of reducing defense spending somewhat and only for a finite
 eriod of four or five years, while stiff-arming the US on security
 issues and trying to work our allies. His ability to get away with
 this depends on a US Congress which fails to support the
 Admininstration ondefense and regional security.
 A foot-
 sal  on these matters that the KGB does not report 'to the
 ea ers ip on broad domestic conditions (which helps explain why they
 have been slow to get the picture), that religious adherence, while no
 real political threat, is growing in the USSR (our view as well), that
 detente because of the "operational opportunities" as well as-the
 economic help it brings the USSR (no surprise here).

 3.  Regional Security Issues and the Summit
 As of this point, we suspect the Soviets do not take the President's
 initiative on regional securit issues serious   and may doubt whether
 the President takes    too serious y either .   any case, the
 Administration's effort to get the regional issues into central focus at
 the summit was a failure; they do not appear (from what we've been able
 to learn) to have gotten much attention during
 Shultz-Shevardnadze-Gorbachev.
 The basic point is that the US has not  as yet, given the Soviets a
 powerful reason to back away from their adventures or from the formula
 for implanting and defending Marxist-Leninist regimes.
 Arrayed against their total security effort, the total cost of these
 adventures, including economic support for Cuba and  ietnam, and the
 military costs of Afghanistan, is not staggeringly large.  There is
 disgruntlement about this cost among Soviet elites and public, but
 not enough to change Soviet policy.
 More important, the risks of Soviet policy in the Third World are not
 great.  Although the    administration is committed in principle to
 supporting Soviet opponents and to making Moscow's policy fail, it is
 severely limited in doing so.  And it cannot credibily threaten to
 raise the level of these conflicts to the point where Moscow must
 dramatically escalate its own actions, face a confrontation with the
 US, or get defeated.
 At the summit, the Soviets are likely to rebut US arguments about the
 evils of-what they are doing by-denouncing our policies in_their terms..
 They are likely to-shrug off arguments about the dangers and risks of
 what they are doing because they doubt we can make it dangerous or
 risky.
 At the margin, they may show a little interest in "negotiated
 settlements" of a vague sort (not including the local opposition) in
 order to encourage those on our side who want to desert the various
 groups fighting them.

 12 November 1985
 Taiwan -- All the King's Horses and All the King's Men?
 1.  Only a few years ago the prospects for a smooth transition of power
 on the mainland of China from Deng Xiaoping to his successor looked
 uncertain while Taiwan awaited Chiang Ching-Kuo's passing with confidence
 and optimism. Now the tables have turned.  China's September party
 conference placed Deng's reformers more firmly in control and reduced the
 chances of old guard military officers playing king maker at his death.
 Meanwhile, the untimely stroke of Taiwan's Premier Sun and KMT party Chief
 Y. S. Chiang's indirect involvement in financial shenanigans on the island
 have thrown the succession to CCK into turmoil and doubt.
 2.  In retrospect, Premier Sun, as heir apparent, was a crucial element
 in CCK's succession plans.  He had the confidence of the old guard
 mainlander conservatives and the vision to depend on a younger generation of
 mainlander technocrats and upstart native Taiwanese to guide Taiwan into the
 21st Century.  CCK forged just such a coalition when he assumed power from
 his father, the legendary Chiang Kai-shek, in 1975.  The decade of political
 and economic progress that ensued spoke well of the idea and with CCK's
 blessing Premier Sun appeared poised to carry on in the same fashion long
 after CCK had passed from the scene.
 3.  So, too, was the KMT in good hands headed by the bright and
 articulate Y. S. Chiang.  The President's-trouble shooter of-many years
 presided over the modernization and Taiwanization of what had become almost
 a moribund and irrelevant artifice.  He breathed new life into the ruling
 party by promoting able, young, western educated mainlanders and transfusing
 the rank and file until about 70 percent of the membership became native
 Taiwanese.  What had begun many years before as a Leninist mechanism of
 control on the mainland became a modern political party stressing competence
 and constituent services on Taiwan.  He was so successful that it literally
 took the wind out of the sails of the once vigorous Taiwanese opposition.
 KMT victories in local elections with mostly native Taiwanese politicians
 left the opposition Tangwai little to criticize and more of an irritant than
 a real electoral threat.
 4.  Premier Sun's incapacitation and Y. S. Chiang's fall from grace
 changed all that.  An older and seemingly tired out CCK reacted to the new
 situation by surrounding himself with conservative hardliners suspicious of
 change and the native Taiwanese majority.  Old friendships rather than
 talent apparently counted for more in his choices.  The new Premier,
 Yu Kuo-hua, for example, has proven irrefutably that he cannot be counted on
 to lead Taiwan out of its economic decline despite his friendship with the
 President and reputed financial and economic expertise.  Others around the
 President appear no better.  They are quick to say yes, but apparently fear
 to give the "old man" bad news.  At the same time, they monopolize access to

 SECRET
 CCK and keep the young reformers at arm's length.  Possessed of little
 vision themselves and loathe to turn to a younger generation for ideas,
 these men appear bent on leaving Taiwan unprepared for CCK's passing.
 5.  What had once seemed assured for Taiwan--a smooth transition and
 continued political and economic progress--is now clouded and uncertain.  No
 new leader of the stature and capability of Premier Sun has emerged and the
 group influencing events now is more of a hinderance than help to CCK.  None
 of them seem capable of stepping into his shoes and carrying on.
 6.  CCK set in motion the beginnings of a major social change on the
 island by reversing the polarization of mainlanders and native Taiwanese
 that had been a fact of life even before his father retreated to the island
 in 1949.  While not yet complete, the gradual process of evolutionary change
 bringing mainlander and Taiwanese closer together portends profound
 consequences by the end of the century.
 7.  Unfortunately, those advising CCK today are not only out of step
 with this new reality, but are representative of the very group who in the
 past most vehemently opposed change.  Many of them have counselled
 repression over reform fearful that they and their kind would have no place
 in the new Taiwan envisioned by CCK.  Moreover, CCK had the advantage of
 rapid economic progress that allowed for a slow and patient strategy of
 reform.  His successors will not have that luxury.  The economic downturn
 that promises to linger on for sometime is likely to increase the demands
 for quickening the pace of political reforms.  A resort to repressive
 measures would only make matters worse and heighten the appeal of the more
 radical opposition.
 8.  The military's role in politics-also appears on the rise  General
 Hau Pei-tsun, the Chief of Staff, and General--Wang Chi-ng-hsu, -Director of
 NSB, appear positioned to play a larger role in the succession than
 previously expected.  Fortunately, both are able men and more enlightened
 than their civilian counterparts currently ensconced close to the
 President.  In the event of a near term succession crisis, both would have a
 large say in the outcome.  Some even speculate that General Hau might wish
 to become part of the civilian administration after CCK's death.  In any
 event, both men could prove decisive in choosing the shape and focus of a
 new government.  Although personally very capable, their power comes from a
 group--the military and security services--most desirous of stability and
 fearful of change.  Each may find it difficult to keep Taiwan moving on the
 course charted by CCK, Premier Sun and Y. S. Chiang.
 9.  CCK, to his credit, apparently recognizes that all is not well.
 Economic disarray and the prospects for opposition gains in the November
 elections have spurred reports that the President plans to reshuffle his
 Cabinet and bring in new advisors.  His choices and the overall complexion
 of the government and party apparatus that he puts his confidence in at this
 crucial stage will go a long way in determining whether his successors will
 be able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.  Will he continue to rely
 on old trusted civilian lieutenants looking to the past for guidance, or
 will he turn to a more forward looking group of younger reformers? At this
 point, unfortunately, it is anybody's guess.

 DCI/NIO REGIONAL CONFERENCE
 SUDAN:  Over the last weekend, Sudanese Defense Minister
 Osmandullah stated that Soviet military experts were en route to Sudan
 to recondition Soviet-supplied aircraft in the Sudanese air force
 inventory.  Abdullah also noted that Sudan had asked the US to remove its
 military equipment in Port Sudan (the US has prepositioned $100 million
 in military equipment for CENTCOM contingency in Port Sudan).  (In fact,
 the Sudanese Government has as yet made no such request.)  Given the
 manifest desire of both military and civilian leaders to obtain more
 military hardware from all sources--and US unwillingness to provide arms
 usable against southern insurgents--it is likely that such a request will
 be made of the US to enhance Sudanese prospects of receiving Soviet and
 Libyan arms.  Such a move would also reflect civilian and military
 desires to be more "nonaligned."
 indicates that the current south
 i
 ern
 nsurgent
 Pos        nonoring a ceasefire and encouraging negotiations is a ploy.
 In fact, the SPLA is preparing for a major offensive against Sudanese
 positions.  A new offensive will only increase northern military and
 civilian desires for more arms to fight the insurgents.
 ANGOLA/SOUTH AFRICA:                                 the Soviets are
 once again sending several large air transports to Angola, almost
 certainly containing military materiel.  This substantiates the
 prediction in our recent SNIE that the Soviets would quickly make up MPLA
 losses incurred in their recent offensive, and especially that the
 Soviets would reinforce and ex and the southern air defense network.
 Informatio                                     suggests the South
 Africans are contemplating a new, relatively large-scale incursion into
 Angola, allegedly to hit SWAPO targets.  We speculate that any new
 incursion may well have the real purpose of both helping Savimbi and
 sending a message to the MPLA and Soviets regarding extension of the air
 defense line southward, if not eastward.
 LIBERIA:  The situation in Liberia remains unsettled as some troops
 loyal to       of State Samuel Doe have apparently decided to battle the
 supporters of the coup launched by former commanding General Quiwonkpa.
 Although our mission reports that US citizens are safe, the situation in
 Liberia will likely remain very dangerous over the next few days as Doe
 and Quiwonkpa vie for the support of Liberia's military.  Given the
 widespread unhappiness with Doe, we believe Quiwonkpa stands a good
 chance of emerging the victor.  Regardless of who wins, however, the
 United States will come under increased pressure from the Liberian

 Government for increased economic and military assistance.  Liberia's
 latest descent into chaos will.also open new-doors for Soviet and Libyan
 meddling.  A Quiwonkpa takeover would likely see the re-emergence in
 Liberia of a political left despite Quiwonkpa's personal pro-US and
 conservative views.  Numerous leftists who fled from Doe's regime would
 be likely to return and benefit from their opposition to Doe.
 LIBYA-CHAD:  Libyan leader Qadhafi has again focused his attention on
 Chad, and the recent heightened Libyan military activity in northern Chad
 suggests that Qadhafi is again prepared to initiate attacks against
 Chadian territory south of the 16th parallel.  During the next few weeks,
 we will probably see Chadian rebel probes against government garrisons
 near the 16th parallel, and Qadhafi may well commit some Libyan military
 assets in support of the rebels.  The Libyans could provide some air
 cover for rebel operations, as well as send Libyan armor or artillery
 units to back the rebel efforts.  The French are unlikely to stand up to
 these initial Libyan challenges, thus encouraging Qadhafi to prepare for
 a?large-scale Libyan thrust into southern Chad.
