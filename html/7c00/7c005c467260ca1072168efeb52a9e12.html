 CHINESE POLITICS AND THE SINO-SOVIET-US TRIANGLE
 by
 The prospects for war, conciliation, or continued tension
 between China and the USSR have a critical impact on the leverage
 available to the US in its dealings with both Communist powers.
 The purpose of the study on which this overview is based is to
 explore in detail one of the most complex, problems which shape
 these prospects -- the relationship between Chinese internal
 politics and China's policy toward both the USSR and the US.  By
 focusing on the protracted and ultimately violent realignment
 of domestic political power that occurred in China during the
 years when the current contours of the Sino-Soviet-US triangle
 began to emerge (1968-1971), this study attempts to illuminate the
 basic forces within the political system which are likely to con-
 tinue to shape the course of Chinese foreign policy in a post-
 Mao era.  The study reconstructs two events which marked major
 turning points in the political struggle:  the Sino-Soviet border
 NOTE:  This brief overview is based on a forthcoming OPR Research
 Study (OPR-404, August 1975,) which presents a number of new inter-
 pretations regarding the patterns of interaction between Chinese
 politics and foreign policy.  The issuing office is aware that
 the complex and controversial issues discussed lend themselves
 to alternate interpretations. Neither the present essay nor the
 forthcoming Research Study represents an official CIA position.

 crisis of 1969, and the internal upheaval that led to the fall
 of Defense Minister Lin Piao and most of China's top central
 military leaders in September 1971.  A final section discusses
 the implications for US policy.
 The A  roach to the Problem
 The Chinese political system, far from representing a
 totalitarian monolith, has over the last several years been
 torn by deep political cleavages which are both the cause and
 the consequence of conflict at the top over the major policy
 issues facing the country.  Indeed, while all Chinese leaders
 have been acutely conscious of the need to enhance their nation's
 status and power in world affairs, there has been serious and
 protracted dissension over the optimum cluster of domestic,
 economic, defense, and foreign policies to pursue in order
 to do so.  These clusters, or policy alternatives, are supported
 by Chinese leaders representing policy coalitions which are in
 part bureaucratically based; the contention for power and in-
 fluence among these coalitions has shaped and is likely to
 continue to shape the course of Chinese politics and foreign
 policy.
 Three policy clusters, believed to approximate the complex
 reality of Chinese politics, have been identified for analytical
 purposes: (1) The radical alternative is highly ideological and
 sees revolutionary spirit and self-reliance as the vehicles

 for Chinese advancement; it inclines towards isolationism and is
 vehemently anti-Soviet and anti-US.  (2)  The moderate alternative
 is relatively pragmatic and outward looking; it favors improved
 relations with the US, Japan, and the West generally both as a
 a counterweight to Soviet power and as a means of speeding
 China's economic development. (3) The military alternative is
 essentially non-ideological; its general goal is to enhance
 China's power and status by increasing military capabilities,
 especially in the field of advanced weapons technology. It opposes
 the opening to the US, and as an alternative proposes a short-term
 decrease in tension with Moscow combined with long term emphasis
 on developing a credible nuclear deterrent.
 The chart at Annex summarizes the main points of the status
 and power alternatives outlined above, and provides an overview
 of the periods within recent Chinese history when each cluster has
 been partially dominant, dominant, or in contention for dominance.
 This framework and the subsequent analysis reflect what has
 come to be called the "bureaucratic politics" approach to
 foreign policy analysis.  It views the Chinese government not
 as a unitary actor which makes foreign policy decisions designed
 solely to optimize Chinese national interests, but rather as a
 number of competing "players"; foreign policy is the political
 outcome of the interplay and infighting among these players,
 each of which tends to interpret the national interest in terms

 of its own factional interests.
 Before identifying the key players in the political struggle,
 it is important to note that each policy cluster represents a
 general tendency, or, as the nomenclature implies, a cluster of
 tendencies rather than clearly defined and inflexible programs
 of action. No individual Chinese leader adheres without deviation
 to all the tenets of any specific cluster, and individuals who
 generally support one tendency may over time come to alter their
 views and swing toward another alternative. With this caveat in
 mind, we can say that the principal leader of the moderate coalition
 was Premier Chou En-lai, who drew support primarily from the civilian
 bureaucracies; that the radicals were represented by Chiang Ching
 and Yao Wen-Yuan, who, as members of the radical wing of the Party,
 had risen to prominence during, the Cultural Revolution; and that
 the military coalition was headed by Defense Minister Lin Piao,
 whose primary base of support was in the defense establishment.
 During the course of contention for power and influence
 among these leaders, Chairman Mao Tse-tung of course played the
 central -- and usually the dominant -- role.  While Mao probably
 made many decisions in relative isolation, the coalition leaders
 regularly sought to influence the Chairman to gain his powerful
 support for their initiatives.  He, in turn, attempted to main-
 tain his overall position of primacy in part by carefully
 assessing the relative strength of the contending coalitions and

 by playing off each group against the others.  Nonetheless,
 in. this process, he appears at times to have been forced --
 at the very least persuaded by concern about the constellation
 of forces raised against him -- to reverse specific policies
 or positions he had previously taken.
 The degree of Mao's dominance has long been a contentious
 issue among analysts of Chinese affairs.  But Mao is now old and
 ill; evidence is accumulating that he is already decreasing his
 active involvement in Chinese politics.   And since his gradual
 eclipse is almost certain to usher in a new period of jockeying
 for power, a new look at forces shaping Chinese politics other
 than Mao himself seems in order. Thus, while the overall approach
 taken here is the retrospective analysis of two central events,
 the focus is on the future and the patterns and tendencies
 within Chinese politics which are likely to continue in a
 post-Mao, post-Chou era.
 Turning Point:  The 1969 Crisis in Sino-Soviet Relations
 On 2 March 1969 an unusual incident occurred on the
 frozen Ussuri river near the desolate island which the Chinese
 call Chen-pao and the Soviets call Damansky.  On numerous occa-
 sions since the early 1960's, there had been periodic non-shooting
 skirmishes in this and other areas along the disputed Sino-
 Soviet border.  On 2 March 1969, for the first time, Chinese
 soldiers opened fire on a Soviet patrol, killing 7 soldiers

 Sino-Soviet relations.
 The 1969 crisis has always been difficult to explain.
 and wounding 23.  On 15 March, the Soviets retaliated with
 a full scale military engagement in the same area during
 which hundreds of troops on both sides were killed and injured.
 Following these conventional military exchanges, Soviet spokes-
 men hinted in a number of forums that a nuclear attack on China
 might become necessary.  By August 1969, the situation had
 deteriorated so badly that some Western observers were convinced
 that war was inevitable in the near term.  In short, the events
 of 1969 marked the most serious crisis in the entire history of
 the face of it, the Chinese attack at Chen-pao seemed irrational.
 i
 Why should Peking risk even local hostilities with the Soviets
 to assert an historical claim to a useless island?  And if
 Peking's goal was to demonstrate that China could not be pushed
 around', then why was an area chosen where Soviet troops were
 heavily concentrated and, as the 15 March clash showed, quite
 capable of humiliating the Chinese in pitched local battles?
 Most critically, why would China's leaders want to engage
 themselves in a foreign policy crisis when they were in fact
 preparing for a major domestic political event:  the Ninth
 Party Congress which opened in early April?
 Perhaps no completely satisfying explanation of the origins
 of the crisis will ever emerge, but a good case can be made that

 the initial Chinese attack on the Soviets was the outcome
 of intense political infighting within China, both over who
 would set Chinese policy and whether Peking should execute a
 major departure in its foreign policy by improving relations
 with the US.
 For some years prior to the crisis, the radical coalition
 had been dominant in China, and foreign policy had been charac-
 terized by a xenophobia which had left Peking isolated inter-
 nationally.  During 1968,-however, a number of events, including
 the opening of the Paris peace talks on Vietnam and the Soviet
 invasion of Czechoslovakia, gave the leaders of the moderate
 coalition the chance to argue for a shift in Chinese policy
 toward an opening to the US.  In the fall of 1968, basic de-
 cisions were made to move in this direction by Mao and Chou, but
 these were apparently reversed in February 1969 because of the
 intense opposition of both the military and radical coalitions.
 The radicals opposed the opening for ideological reasons; Lin
 and the military opposed it in part because it would have been
 a triumph for Lin's rival, Chou-En-lai, and in part because
 they wanted to leave the door open for improved relations with
 Moscow.
 That Mao and Chou had been reversed on an initiative in
 which they had invested considerable prestige is only one of a
 number of indications that they may have been in serious political

 trouble at this time.  According to
 the many delays in
 tary at the meeting.   Moreover,
 convening the Ninth Party Congress were a direct result of Mao's
 calculation that he could not count on the support of the mili-
 depicted the strength Lin Piao and his supporters ultimately
 achieved in the most vivid terms, and Lin was very likely making
 major strides toward this position of strength in early 1969.
 Mao himself, for example, has recently stated that "Lin Piao
 almost succeeded in taking over the whole party," and vice
 Premier Teng Hsiao-ping has gone so far as to say that "the Lin
 Piao anti-party clique was able to expand its influence and
 gradually gain control of the Party."  If all this is coupled
 with the advances made by Lin at the Party Congress at the ex-
 pense of moderates and radicals, then one can make a case that
 both Mao and Chou were in a precarious political position in
 early 1969.
 Under these circumstances, a clash with the Soviets would
 serve the interests of Mao and Chou in a number of areas.  Most
 importantly, it would be a strong reassertion of Mao's personal
 authority following the February setback on US policy and the
 general trend toward greater power for Lin and the military.
 Secondly, it would make it far more difficult for the military

 coalition to sustain a case that Sino-Soviet relations should
 be improved.  Thirdly, the resultant increase in Sino-Soviet
 tension would provide dramatic justification for an opening to
 the US.  In short, it would serve both the foreign policy and
 domestic political purposes of these key Chinese decisionmakers.
 This line of explanation, however, raises some very difficult
 questions:  if Lin and his supporters on the Politburo had been
 strong enough to reverse Mao and Chou on the question of the
 first steps toward the opening to the US, why would they not
 have had enough clout to prevent an action which was not in
 the best interests of the policy line they advocated?  Moreover,
 since Lin was in charge of the defense bureaucracy, how could
 a decision requiring a military action be taken without his
 approval?
 While it is possible that Mao and Chou confronted Lin
 directly on this decision and simply ordered him to take steps
 to implement it, it seems more likely, given the internal political
 situation, that they pursued their goals by circumventing the
 normal chain of command and directly ordered Chen Hsi-lien,
 commander of the Shenyang Military Region, to attack the Soviets.
 Because Chen's own personal ambitions were well served by an
 increase in tension on the Sino-Soviet border, it is likely
 that he would have obeyed an order from Mao even at the risk
 of involving himself directly in the internal power struggle

 in Peking.  Moreover, many other aspects of the events. surrounding
 the 2 March incident support the view that the attack was not
 carefully planned by China's central defense establishment, but,
 instead, was arranged on short notice and executed without the
 knowledge of higher military authorities.
 This interpretation of the 2 March clash, in short, has
 Mao and Chou acting hastily for highly political reasons rather
 than making a rational and detached determination of what China's
 national interests required.  That they were prepared to risk
 the death of hundreds of Chinese soldiers, and even war with
 the Soviet Union, is thus a measure not only of how high they
 calculated the stakes in the internal power struggle, but
 also of how badly they wanted to discredit those within China
 who opposed  the opening to the US. Certainly the message
 that Mao could count on the loyalty of China's second most
 powerful military regional commander would not be lost on
 Lin in the continuing power struggle.
 While there were ups and downs in Chinese propaganda
 throughout the remainder of 1969, tension in Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions remained high.  Nationwide demonstrations began on the
 day after the clash, and by 7 March some 260 million Chinese
 had participated in mass rallies denouncing Soviet revisionism
 and vowing vigilance along the border.  The message to the
 domestic rivals of Mao and Chou was unmistakable:  anti-Soviet

 sentiment was strong among the Chinese people and anyone favoring
 lessened tension with Moscow was treading on very unpopular
 ground.  Moreover, the Chinese continued aggressive border
 patrolling until August when the Soviets responded by dropping
 veiled hints about a possible nuclear strike. The crisis atmosphere
 reinforced the position of the Chinese moderates who were
 disposed to be receptive to the overtures for improved Sino-US
 relations which were coming out of Washington.
 In what was almost certainly a compromise between the
 moderates and their opponents, the Chinese agreed in October
 to open negotiations on the border dispute with Moscow, and then
 in January 1970 announced they would be willing to reschedule
 the aborted February 1969 Warsaw talks with the US.  While it
 quickly became apparent that they were not taking the Sino-Soviet
 border talks seriously, they tried to keep up momentum in rela-
 tions with the US by meeting in Warsaw in February 1970 and then
 scheduling another session of the bilateral talks for May 1970.
 Thus, the basic foreign policy goal of justifying steps toward
 an opening to the US was well served by the 2 March crisis;
 though, as discussed below, Lin's drive toward expanding his
 power and influence in party affairs was not derailed but only
 slowed.  In this context, the Sino-Soviet clash of March 1969 was
 a prelude to the decisive confrontation between the moderates and

 the military which  came to a crisis two years later -- the
 fall of Lin Piao.
 Watershed:  The Fall of Lin Piao
 By almost all surface criteria, Lin Piao had won a stunning
 victory at the Ninth Party Congress, primarily at the expense
 of Chou En-lai, his principal rival.  Chou's power base was in
 the governmental bureaucracies, and of the six men drawn from
 this sector on the Politburo in 1968, all but two, Chou and Li
 Hsien-nien, lost their positions at the Congress.  Eleven military
 men were added to the Politburo, a majority of whom were apparently
 Lin supporters.  Lin's close ally Chen Po-ta was named to the
 crucial Standing Committee of the Politburo, and more importantly,
 the Congress formally adopted a new constitution designating
 Lin by name as Mao's successor.  Lin, it appeared, was well on
 his way to supreme power within China.  And yet, in just over two
 years after the Ninth Party Congress, Lin had fallen from power
 following an intense and ultimately violent struggle within the
 Chinese leadership.
 Lin's fall was far more than the purging of a single individ-
 ual.                      It was preceded by an elaborate conspiracy against Mao
 that involved a large number of individuals and was followed
 by a purge of virtually all of China's ranking central military
 leaders.  In the context of the framework presented in this
 study, the Lin Piao affair represented the crisis stage of the

 struggle for power between the moderate coalition and the mili-
 tary that had been under way since the winding down of the
 Cultural Revolution in 1968.  In relative terms, the radical
 coalition played only a marginal role.
 Most previous explanations of the Lin Piao crisis have
 played down the role of foreign policy issues.  By contrast,
 this study presents the view that these issues, and more specifi-
 cally what they implied in terms of resource allocation and the
 resultant balance of power between the moderate and military
 coalitions, are central to explaining the course of events that
 preceded Lin's abortive 1971 coup.  In brief, Lin appears to
 have consistently opposed any steps toward rapprochement with
 the US throughout 1969 and 1970.  He apparently seized on the
 US invasion of Cambodia in the spring of 1970 to persuade Mao
 both to cancel the scheduled Sino-US talks in Warsaw and to
 make a series of reconciliatory gestures toward Moscow.  This
 shift toward Lin's approach to foreign policy came to an abrupt
 end following the Second Plenum of the Ninth Party Congress in
 August 1970 when the balance of internal political forces be-
 gan to tilt against Lin.  Soon thereafter, there was a major
 change in China's propaganda line.  New and authoritative anti-
 Soviet pronouncements were made and an ideological justification
 for improved relations with the US was endorsed publicly by high
 Foreign ministry officials.  By December 1970 Mao felt strong

 enough to extend the historic invitation to President Nixon.
 Lin's continued opposition to the opening to the US is well
 documented, but what is more difficult to explain is why he felt
 compelled to risk a confrontation with Mao on this issue.  The
 answer apparently lies in the fact that concomitant with the
 critical debates over foreign policy issues in 1971 there was
 an intense struggle over the allocation of scarce resources,
 with Lin and his supporters favoring the continuation of the
 high levels of military expenditures they had obtained for
 1968-1971. If Chou succeeded in enhancing China's sense of
 security by improved relations with Washington, they reasoned,
 a key element in their rationale for high military expenditures
 would be undercut.
 Recent intelligence studies on military expenditures
 for procurement of new equipment bear out this interpretation.*
 Indeed, the rise and fall in the influence of. the military
 coalition is starkly reflected in the statistics presented
 in these studies. During the period when Lin and the military
 were in an ascendant position, roughly from 1968 until the
 end of 1971, military spending on procurement in all fields
 increased dramatically, with a growing proportion going to
 aircraft and missiles combined.  Just as significant, however,

 are the sharp cutbacks in this same area that followed Lin's
 fall from power in 1971.  While the amounts expended for the
 procurement of land arms have continued to remain at the high
 levels attained by 1971, and while purchases for naval forces
 have declined only slightly, expenditures on new aircraft
 and missiles have fallen dramatically. In overall terms, the
 reallocation of resources is shown by the fact that military
 procurement has decreased in relation to total industrial
 production (see accompanying chart "Resource Allocation and
 Military Procurement in China, 1965-1974").
 This interpretation of Lin's fall from power does not
 argue that foreign policy issues were more important than the
 general issue of civilian versus military rule.  In effect,
 foreign policy issues were so intimately linked to a cluster
 of other issues that they formed an integral part of the overall
 struggle between the moderate coalition and the military coali-
 tion.  A debate over resource allocation and foreign policy was
 the immediate catalyst-because it brought to a head the entire
 question of the continued predominance of the military in Chinese
 politics and society.  Mao and Chou were undoubtedly engaged in
 a broadly-based campaign to prevent Lin and the military from
 expanding their power still further, and to do so they not
 only confronted this issue specifically, but also used the
 thrust of their foreign policy program to focus the debate on

 the concrete issue of resource allocation.
 Just as in 1969 when they had used a foreign policy crisis
 to further their domestic goals, so in 1971 they used arguments
 drawn from the implications of their diplomatic program for
 the same purpose.  Moreover, in the unsettled situation that followed
 Lin's abortive coup, Mao and Chou systematically exaggerated the
 threat of war with the Soviet Union in order to create a crisis
 atmosphere conducive to party unity during the purge they conducted
 of pro-Lin military figures.
 All of this points to a general view that there is not as
 wide a division in China as in the US between the worlds of the
 foreign and domestic policymaker; indeed, it is reasonable to
 conclude that the small number of men at the apex of China's
 political structure do not make any significant distinctions
 between the spheres of domestic, foreign, and national security
 policy.  Indeed, Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua has stated
 explicitly that Chinese "foreign policies are inseparable from
 domestic policies," and that no formal decisionmaking structure
 for foreign policy similar to the National Security Council
 exists in China.

 foreign policies in 1968, backers of the moderate alternative have

 had to fight a two-front domestic war.  On the one hand,
 they have been opposed by the radicals who were hostile to the
 moderate policy cluster for ideological reasons.  On the other,
 they have been opposed by the military coalition not only because
 it was seeking supreme power in China, but also on grounds of
 "national security."
 While the leverage of the radical coalition on policy
 decisions has now been considerably reduced, this apparently
 is not the case for the military coalition.  In the first place,
 many military leaders have their own independent power bases;
 secondly, they almost certainly have sympathizers within the
 S             moderate coalition in general and the foreign policy establish-
 ment in particular; and thirdly  they have a strong argument
 which is cast in terms of China's vital national security in-
 terests.  Their argument probably would go something like this:
 A basic. premise of the moderates' national security
 program is that 'contention" will always win out
 over "collusion" in Soviet-US relations, and that
 China can therefore count on a powerful US as a
 counterbalance to the USSR in world affairs.  This
 premise, however, is extremely dangerous because it
 does not take into consideration two very real
 possibilities:  1) the first is that the US, because
 of domestic political and economic difficulties as
 well as international setbacks, may fall seriously
 behind Moscow in terms of the strategic balance of
 power and therefore be unable to fill the role of a
 counterbalance to Soviet power; 2) perhaps in part
 because of the above, the US may well find it
 convenient or even necessary to place such a great
 emphasis on improved relations with the Soviets,
 especially in the critical area of strategic arms
 limitation, that it will be willing to sacrifice its

 relations with China to attain this goal. Thus,
 China is endangering its national security
 by placing too large a share of its national
 resources in the service of economic development
 rather than military expenditures, and the
 diplomatic rationale for following this course
 may well be incorrect because it fails to take
 into consideration the prospect that Soviet-US
 competition in world affairs could well be replaced
 by a degree of cooperation that would seriously
 endanger China's national security.
 Seen in this perspective, events which signal significant
 or rapid progress in Soviet-US relations, especially in the area
 of strategic arms limitation, are likely to lead to renewed
 debate within China over the wisdom of its present stance, and
 could lead to an increase of the relative power of the military
 coalition which in turn might result in a shift in the conduct
 of China's policies toward the US and the USSR.
 B.   The Level of Tension
 Overall, tension in Sino-Soviet relations has declined
 since 1969, in large measure because the moderate policy coali-
 tion has extended its control, the internal situation has become
 somewhat more stable, and China has received greater recognition
 from the international community.  Nevertheless, tension could
 easily again flare up if during the protracted and delicate
 succession process already under way, a group within China were
 to become predominant which judges that its interests would be
 served by a provocation such as the 1969 border clash.  Whether
 or not such a situation evolves depends in part on events out-

 side China in general and on the actions of the USSR and the US
 in particular.
 US moves which would enhance China's status, such as es-
 tablishing full diplomatic relations, would probably strengthen
 the moderates' hold on power and their commitment to the policy
 of expanding ties with non-Communist countries.  Paradoxically,
 such developments would probably also serve to lessen the
 imperatives pressing elements in the Chinese leadership toward
 periodic crises with the USSR.  Not only would the leadership
 have a decreased need to play up the Soviet threat to deflect
 attack from domestic critics, but -- with more self-confidence
 regarding China's status in the international hierarchy --
 these leaders would probably be more willing to enter into
 serious negotiations with the Soviets over the border issue.
 If Moscow were careful to take Chinese sensitivities into
 consideration by making a substantial conciliatory gesture
 (such as a sizeable drawdown of its forces in the border area),
 some form of mutually acceptable border arrangement could con-
 ceivably be worked out.
 The primary impact of a border arrangement would be to
 decrease substantially the chances of some future border inci-
 dent escalating into a nuclear war in Asia.  Nevertheless,
 China's interests are at odds with the USSR's throughout Asia,
 and a border agreement would not end the struggle for influence
 and power there and in the rest of the world.

 Moreover, even if there were some improvement in Sino-
 Soviet relations, the US would still have leverage for maintaining
 competition between the two powers.  The moderates, having been
 strengthened by normalization of relations with the US, would
 probably allow the logic of their thesis on enhancing China's
 status to carry them even further in their pragmatic search
 for power and prestige through conventional diplomacy and economic
 development. Indeed, given the right circumstances, a moderate
 Chinese government might in the future be amenable to expanding
 substantially its cultural, economic, and perhaps even military
 ties with nom-Connnunist countries in general and the US in
 particular. Should the Sino-US relationship advance along these
 lines, there is little doubt that there would be serious Soviet
 concern, and that this would express itself in increased Sino-
 Soviet tension.
 At the same time, expanded ties with the US would directly
 or indirectly provide greater resources for meeting the military
 coalition's goal of strengthening China's military capabilities.
 And an amelioration of internal antagonisms on this issue would
 be likely to increase support for the moderates among at least
 some elements of the military, a development which in turn
 would contribute to the strength and stability of a Chinese
 leadership coalition with vested interests in maintaining
 good relations with the US.

 HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
 the 1950s: The Rejected Alternative
 During most of the 1950s China followed the general policy of allying and
 working with the Soviet Union to further the goal of advancing the interests of the
 communist bloc against the forces of "imperialism  in general and the United
 States in particular. To enhance China's economic and military capabilities, Peking
 relied on the importation of technology from the Soviet Union and accepted grants
 and long-term loans to finance their economic modernization. Militarily, they
 relied on the Soviet nuclear umbrella and the importation of advanced Soviet
 weaponry such as jot aircraft..
 1958-1961: The Radical Alternative
 In the late 1950a, the Chinese became increasingly dissatisfied with their
 status in the world communist movement, and increasingly restive to assert their
 own ideological leadership against the Soviets. They were also acutely conscious
 of their exclusion from the thermonuclear club of great powers, and of their slow
 pace of economic development under Soviet tutelage,
 The Chinese, therefore, embarked on a course of action which reflected many
 of the elements of the radical alternative, (that is, Pohpy !luster II. ' By launching
 the Great Leap F    nd, a massive effort to further theindlrstrial strength of China
 by stirring up theuticutary spirit of the masses, they aimed toward becoming
 economically ^selhreliaht:"
 After two years t l' frenzied effort, the failure of the Greet Leap was increasingly
 apparent. Nevertheless, during this period the Chinese had rejected the centralized
 soviet model for tfve deVelopment of their economy and had laid the groundwork
 for a complete'breatt With the Soviets in other areas.
 19621965: The ?i oderate Alternative Foreshadowed
 During this perod the'break with the Soviets became final, and elements of
 Policy Cluster 11 ctleiwe to -the fore though many of the tendencies of the radical,
 alternative In the ftQrelgn policy area continued. The extremes of the Great Leap
 were abandoned arfd a more pragmatic economic course was set which emphasized
 realizable goals. Foreign trade was also increased, and in 1963 and 19964 the
 Chinese went so far Ns to negotiate for the purchases of. whole plants from Japan
 and Western Furope:' Concomitantly, steps were taken `tir establish or improve
 relations with certain non-communist nations.
 1965-1968: The8dica! Alternative
 Before the elarrients of the moderate alternative could become established,,
 the external setting was altered by the Increases in international tension, that
 accompanied the   c atron of the Vietnam war. China's early efforts to expand
 ties with Japan a    .stern, urope ran into serious trouble, and the moderates ,
 who had favored tttla-ppahing were discredited. Frustrated in this early aftempt
 to enhance China`,#+ s tus through 'increased international Intercourse, and
 fearful that evenif'euccessful, the opening to the West would lead to a decline
 in revolutionary elan, Mao and the radicals launched the Great Proletarian
 Revolution, a movditlent which in its foreign' policy dimension carried the radical
 ,alternative to the exireme of cutting off virtually all forms of traditional intercourse
 with the internationdtcommunity. An intense xenophobicisotaticnism characterized
 Chinese policy and both the US and the Soviets were cpndemlgd;with equal fervor.
 1968.1975: A Re iilgnment of Domestic Political Dower
 1968: Numerous events in the external setting-Hirst indications of US
 disengagement triam' ndochine, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia,'theelection
 of a new admirl+stratlpn In .Washington? allowed the Moderates to take the first
 steps toward improlle  relations wig the US.
 1969: In Febru*V these early steps toward the Us ureic reversed by a
 coalition of the military and radicals. In March, with Mao's support, the moderates
 took the drastic step of provoking a serious Sino-$oviet cr support
 in an Attempt to
 regain the initiative. in the internal power struggle and to provide a powerful
 rationale for the cfpetfiltg to the US.
 1970-1971: While,the'1969 crisis slowed their advance, the military , coalition
 maneuvered toward an.ascendant position, The moderate coalition and Mao
 continued to push fo' Improved relations with the US apd resisted advocates of.
 ameliorating tensioh with the USSR. Rather than accept the' transformation of
 policy underway ip 1971, the military coalition under the leadership of Defense
 Minister Lin Piao ottempted a coup against Mao and the moderates, and the
 struggle between moderates and the military reached a crisis stage resulting
 not only in the fall of Lin but also in a massive purge of China's top military leaders.
 1971-Present: The fall of Lin Piao was a clear-cut victory for Premier Chou
 En?lai and the moderates. They therefore moved over the next,few y~arsto imple-
 ment both their domestic and foreign policy programs. Diplomatically,; thhey con-
 tinued to place great emphasis on improved relations with the West,'receiving
 President Nixon in early 1972, and normalizing state-to-state relations with, a
 growing number of countries including Japan and West Germany. In the economic
 field, new emphasis began to be put on developing scientific and technical expertise
 and importing Western technology and technological knowledge, and b  inning
 in late 1972, there Was a major drive to import whole manufacture g bens from
 the West. During 1971 contracts were signed for over one billion dnollars of plant
 technology, over ten times the amount contracted for in any given pro-Cultural
 Revolution year.
 While the Fourth National People's Congress held in early 1975 was generally
 dominated by the, moderates, advocates of the radical and military alternatives
 still retain powerful positions and the contention for power within China continues,
