 INTRODUCTION
 The recognition of foreign governments is an often-practiced but little
 understood area of foreign policy. Although the practice of recognizing
 governments that come to power through extraconstitutional means
 is over two centuries old and literally thousands of new governments
 have been recognized, much remains unclear about both the practical
 and the theoretical side of recognition.
 Foreign policy decision makers have utilized recognition in
 myriad ways, depending on the political circumstances of the time and
 their perception of the national interest involved in a change of
 government. Thus, for example, the United States has used recogni-
 tion as a political tool to support antimonarchical governments (under
 George Washington), to advance economic imperialism (under Theo-
 dore Roosevelt), to promote constitutional government (under Wood-
 row Wilson), and to halt the spread of communism (under Dwight
 Eisenhower). The practice of other states is similarly diverse.
 While the use of the recognition instrument in order to achieve
 political objectives may be justifiable, the instrument is often em-
 ployed without the development of an adequate analytical framework
 to explain it. Consequently, there has been vacillation in policy and
 confusion over such matters as when the question of recognition
 arises, under what conditions (if any) It should be granted, and what
 it means once granted. The confusion is reflected in policy statements
 issued by foreign ministries and the State Department, in press ac-
 counts, and in the reaction of the man on the street. Often the question
 whether to recognize a new government creates strong emotion among
 average citizens, as it did in the case of the Maoist government in
 the People's Republic of China.
 Practice over two centuries has not established whether recogni-

 meet is not always clear, and problems may arise in determining
 whether a particular change of government raises the question of
 recognition.
 Unlawful changes of government occur in a variety of ways. In
 perhaps the most extreme case, a revolution may occur in which the
 social, economic, and political institutions of a state are radically
 altered. In such a case, there can be no doubt that the change violates
 the existing domestic law of the -state.
 Far more common is the military coup d'etat. In the classic case,
 the military, dissatisfied for one reason or another with the existing
 government, may take power, killing, imprisoning, or exiling the head
 of government and members of the cabinet or ruling body. The overt
 seizure of power is often followed by the formation of a--military junta
 to rule the country until elections are held, or for an indefinite period.
 As with the case of revolution, when the military seizes. ,over overtly
 by taking to the streets, there can be little question but that the change
 of government violates the domestic law of the state, and therefore
 raises & 'question of recognition of the new government.
 In other cases, it may not be so Clear that a change of government
 is extraconstitutional. For example, the military may bring pressure
 and cause the resignation of the existing government without an
 overt show of force. The military may then assume power, commonly
 with the legislature's approval, which the legislature may or may not
 have the constitutional authority to bestow.
 A similarly questionable change of government occurs when the
 president is replaced by the vice-president instead of a military junta,
 but the change is brought about by duress. Here the. form of domestic
 law may be preserved but not the substance. The vice-president who
 assumes power may be merely a figurehead. In such. situations the
 problems for an outside state in determining whether the question of
 recognition is raised are patent.
 In other cases, it may not even be clear that a change of govern-
 ment has occurred, at least in a formal sense. For example, the mili-
 tary may in fact assume power but leave the head of state and perhaps
 the head of government in office as figureheads. In such cases outside
 states are confronted with a difficult choice-whether to accept the
 action at face value and conclude that no question of recognition
 arises because no formal change of government has occurred, or to
 look behind the form and run the risk that their judgments will be
 attacked as intervention in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state.
 Political forces govern the practice of most states when confronted
 with such situations. For example, in responding to military coups in
 Latin America in recent years, the United States fairly consistently
 has refused to make a close inquiry into changes of government,. fear-
 ing charges of intervention and wishing to maintain relations with as
 little disturbance as possible.
 Neither the United States nor other states has developed guide-
 lines to determine just when the question of recognition is raised.
 Indeed, this is probably impossible given the differences in the do-
 mestic laws of the various states and the great variance in factual
 circumstances. The decision, therefore, is basically ad hoc with the
 political interests of the recognizing state outweighing the technical
 violation of the other state's domestic law.
 States may avoid the recognition question entirely simply by de-
 ciding that a change has been in accordance with domestic law. This
 normally occurs when an outside state wishes merely to continue
 relations with the new government or to maintain a low profile for
 political reasons.
 Criteria for the Grant of Recognition
 The decision to recognize a foreign government that comes to power
 through extraconstitutional mean's usually involves an interesting and
 often subtle interplay between the principles of international law and
 international politics. The interplay is no less interesting merely be-
 cause political forces often overshadow legal principles.
 Some scholars have argued that the decision to recognize a new
 government is a wholly legal decision." Most policy makers have
 taken the opposite view, contending that the decision to recognize is
 political and within the discretion of the recognizing stater In prac-
 tice, the majority of states blend both law and politics into their
 decision.
 The three major approaches to recognition that have developed
 in the past two centuries reflect this interplay, and each has its own
 set of criteria for determining whether to grant recognition. The
 three are: (1) the traditional approach, (2) the Estrada Doctrine, and
 (3) the Tobar or Betancourt Doctrine.
 Traditional Approach. Under the traditional approach, a state con-
 sidering recognition first seeks to determine:
 (1) whether the government is in de facto control of the terri-
 tory and in possession of the machinery of the state;
 I Lauterpacht, Recognition in International L.aw, pp. 87-97.
 T Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations, Hearings on S. Res. 203, pp. 8-17.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/09/26: CIA-RDP05CO1629R000300610013-4
 (2) whether the government has the consent of the people, with-
 out substantial resistance to its administration, that is,
 whether there is public acquiescence in the authority of the
 government; and
 (3) whether the new government has indicated its willingness to
 comply with its obligations under treaties and international
 law.'
 The first criterion is fundamental and by no means limited to the
 traditional approach. States seldom recognize a new government, at
 least openly, that is not in effective control of the territory and the
 machinery of the state.' Such action would constitute "premature
 recognition" and would be considered intervention in the domestic af-
 fairs of the state.'? While the principle is uncontroverted, in practice,
 when the political interests of the recognizing state favor the new gov-
 ernment, the question of effective control may be finessed. The recog-
 nition of the Yemen government by the United States in 1962, and the
 grant of recognition by Hitler and Mussolini to the Franco regime in
 Spain before Franco had gained control, are examples of such prema-
 ture recognition.
 The second criterion-the consent of the people-is more contro-
 versial. In most instances such consent is assumed from popular
 acquiescence in the assumption of power by the new government. A
 State Department official, testifying before the Senate Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee in 1969, explained the United States practice this
 way:
 CHAIRMAN. With the consent or the acquiescence, which do
 you mean, or do you mean both?
 MR. ALDRICH. Well, I think this is something that-can mean
 different things to different people. We have had this am-
 biguity since Jefferson referred to "the will of the nation
 substantially declared."
 CHAIRMAN. If it is so ambiguous and difficult, is
 significant consideration then?
 MR. ALDRICH. I think it has been in some cases.
 CHAIRMAN. But is it under your present policy?
 it really a
 MR. ALDRICH. I think our present policy is more concerned
 with the acquiescence rather than the declaration of the will
 of the people. I think that what we have done in recent years

 shows a far greater concern with deciding whether the par-
 ticular government involved has effective control and is not
 sitting on top of 'an imminent revolution, but does in fact
 govern with the acquiescence of the people. We have not
 generally concerned ourselves with asking, would the people,
 if given a free plebiscite, endorse that change of government.
 CHAIRMAN. In other words, the present policy which, as you
 say, is established policy, does not require that they be a
 fully developed democracy in which the people have elected
 their government?
 MR. ALDRICH. I would say that the present policy would like
 to see that happen but that there are a number of cases in
 recent years in which we have not insisted on that before
 recognizing a new government or engaging in diplomatic
 relations."
 The present approach of most states is to interpret the criterions"con-
 sent of the people" to mean acquiescence of the people to the new
 government.
 Policy makers have found that in many coups d'etat the concept
 of actual consent is meaningless. As one State Department official
 stated:
 Most coups occur in less developed countries which
 have predominantly illiterate and politically dormant popu-
 lations. The coup is usually quick, bloodless, and effective.
 Moreover, such changes in government usually occur in one-
 party states, and take the form of one elite replacing an-
 other elite, political or military. In such circumstances the
 popular will remains largely irrelevant. In the absence of a
 popular revolution or a clear division of allegiance within the
 country, the consent or. acquiescence of the population must
 as a practical matter be taken for granted.12
 The third criterion under the traditional approach, the willing-
 ness to fulfill international obligations, finds its origins in United
 States practice in the last half of the nineteenth century when the De-
 partment of State used the standard to extract guarantees for U.S.
 investments in unstable Caribbean and Latin American states." Today
 it is largely a pro forma requirement; new regimes that seize power
 usually announce as a matter of course that they will honor all inter-
 national obligations.

 V
 Once the three basic criteria under the traditional approach are
 met, the outside state normally must make a political judgment
 whether recognition would be in its best interest. In making this
 political decision, it usually will consider
 the existence or non-existence of evidence of foreign inter-
 vention in the establishment of the new regime; the political
 orientation of the government and its leaders; evidence of
 intention to observe democratic principles, particularly the
 holding of elections; the attitude of the new government
 toward private investment and economic improvement. Im-
 portantly, also, the interest of peoples, as distinguished from
 governments, is of concern. These, and other criteria, de-
 pending upon the international situation at the time, have
 been considered, with varying weight."
 One might fairly characterize the traditional approach to recognition
 as flexible and pragmatic. Each decision to recognize is somewhat
 ad hoc, with the political interests of the recognizing state the major
 consideration. In many cases the recognizing state may perceive little
 national interest in a particular change of government, hence down-
 playing recognition and resuming relations with as little disturbance
 as possible. However, if the recognizing state perceives that a signifi-
 cant national interest is involved, under the traditional approach it
 may bargain with the new regime for free elections, a realization of
 individual freedoms, economic -guarantees, and so forth. In the rare
 case, a state may withhold recognition for a substantial period of time
 because the new government refuses to comply with such conditions.
 For example, the U.S. refusal to recognize the government of Albania
 after World War II continues to the present.
 The Estrada Doctrine. Under the Estrada Doctrine, the recognition of
 governments that come to power through extraconstitutional means
 is for all practical purposes eliminated from diplomatic practice. Only
 new states are recognized; when a new government comes to power
 either through constitutional means or otherwise, its relations with
 outside states remain unchanged.
 The doctrine of recognizing only states, and not governments,
 was first articulated by the Mexican Foreign Minister Don Genaro
 Estrada in 1930:
 It is a well-known fact that some years ago Mexico
 suffered, as few nations have, from the consequences of that
 doctrine, which allows foreign governments to pass upon the
 Digest of International Las, vol. 2, p. 73.
 legitimacy or illegitimacy of the regime existing in another
 country, with the result that situations arise in which the
 legal qualifications or national status of governments or au-
 thorities are apparently made subject to the opinion of
 foreigners.
 Ever since the Great War, the doctrine of so-called
 recognition has been applied in particular to the nations of
 this continent, although in well-known cases of change of
 regime occurring in European countries the governments of
 the nations have not made express declarations of recogni-
 tion; consequently, the system has been changing into a
 special practice applicable to the Latin American Republics.
 After a very careful study of the subject, the Govern-
 ment of Mexico has transmitted instructions to its ministers
 or Charges d'Affaires in the countries affected by the recent
 political crises, informing them that the Mexican govern-
 ment is issuing no declarations in the sense of grants of
 recognition, since that nation considers that such a course is
 an insulting practice and one which, in addition to the fact
 that it offends the sovereignty of other nations, implies that
 judgment of some sort may be passed upon the internal
 affairs of those nations by other governments, inasmuch as
 the latter assume, in effect, an attitude of criticism, when
 they decide, favorably, or unfavorably, as to the legal quali-
 fications of foreign regimes."'
 The Estrada Doctrine embraces the principle of unfettered na-
 tional sovereignty and rejects interference with the domestic affairs of
 one state by another through the granting or withholding of recogni-
 tion. States..that have adopted the Estrada Doctrine often say they
 recognize states, not governments; however, as a practical matter,
 many states depart from the doctrine whenever they perceive a major
 political advantage in using the recognition instrument.
 A substantial number of states have adopted the Estrada Doc-
 trine, either officially or in practice. In response to the Department of
 rs The statement continues: "Therefore, the Government of Mexico confines itself
 to the maintenance or withdrawal, as it may deem advisable, of its diplomatic
 agents, and to the continued acceptance, also when it may deem advisable, of such
 similar accredited diplomatic agents as the respective nations may have in
 Mexico; and in so doing, it does not pronounce judgment, either precipitately or
 a posteriori regarding the right of foreign nations to accept, maintain or replace
 their governments or authorities. Naturally, in so far as concerns the usual
 formulas for accrediting and receiving agents and for the exchange of signed
 letters of Heads of Government and Chancellors, the Mexican Government will
 continue to use the same formulas accepted up to the present time by inter
 national law and diplomatic law" (Whiteman, Digest of International Lars, vol.
 2, pp. 65-16).

 State's 1969 survey, thirty-one states indicated that they had aban-
 doned traditional recognition policies and substituted the Estrada
 Doctrine or some equivalent by which they accepted whatever gov-
 ernment was in effective control without raising the issue of recogni-
 tion. Among the states accepting the Estrada Doctrine were Mexico,
 France, Finland, Turkey, Germany, Indonesia, and Peru."
 The Tobar Doctrine. The Tobar or Betancourt Doctrine stands in di-
 rect contrast to the Estrada Doctrine. It attempts to encourage demo-
 cratic and constitutional government by refusing to recognize any
 government that comes to power through extraconstitutional means
 until a free election is held and new leaders elected. One writer has
 noted: "If the Estrada Doctrine mode of approach assumed automatic
 recognition of new governments, then it might be said that, for prac-
 tical purposes, the Tobar Doctrine implied automatic nonrecogni-
 tion."17 This doctrine is often criticized for its substantial interference
 with the domestic political processes of sovereign states, and because
 it bars revolutionary change as a method to overthrow even corrupt
 and despotic governments.
 The Tobar Doctrine was first developed by a foreign minister
 of Ecuador, and was embodied in a treaty signed in .1907 by five
 Central Americanrepublies A 1923 treaty went further and barred
 recognition-even if the people constitutionally approved the change
 -if the choice of headship or vice-headship fell upon a person con-
 nected with the coup d'etat or revolution.
 The Tobar Doctrine never has enjoyed widespread acceptance;
 however, it did not vanish following the termination of the 1923
 treaty. In 1963, the governments of Venezuela and Costa Rica at-
 tempted to persuade the governments of the Americas to adopt the
 Tobar Doctrine through a resolution submitted to a meeting of foreign
 ministers.'" Although the attempt failed, some states adopted the
 doctrine unilaterally, including Venezuela and Costa Rica, which ap-
 plied the doctrine for several years.
 Effect of Recognition. Just as there has been no agreement on the
 proper approach to recognition, there is uncertainty and disagreement
 over the effect of recognition once granted. In short, what does it
 mean to "recognize" a new government?

 As Professor Stephen Schwebel has written, the simple ansv
 is that recognition of foreign governments, for all its long history a
 frequent use, has little substantive content. Governments deal wi
 each other, sometimes extensively, without recognizing one anoth
 They may negotiate and conclude treaties with governments they,
 not recognize. They may sit in international or regional organizatio
 with other governments they do not recognize. In fact, they m.
 trade with governments they do not recognize." On the other har
 one state may recognize the government of another and yet have i
 diplomatic relations with that state, even interdicting trade, limith
 travel, and maintaining all intercourse with that state through a thii
 party."
 The current relations between the United States and the People
 Republit.of China on the one hand, and until recently Cuba on ti
 other, illustrate the lack of substantive content in the recognition i
 foreign governments. The United States recognizes the government ,
 Fidel Castro, but until recently it interdicted trade and limited trave
 maintaining no diplomatic ties with Cuba. In contrast, although th
 United States does not recognize the government of the People's Re
 public of China, a considerable relationship has developed between th
 two states. Ambassadors have been exchanged and "liaison offices" es
 tablished in each state. The President of the United States was is
 ceived as a head of state by. the Chinese government. Cultural a
 changes have occurred and trade is now lawful between the tw
 states. Both sit on the Security Council of the United Nations. Thi
 relationship was established not only while the United States dl,
 not recognize the Maoist government but while it recognized another
 that of Chiang Kai-chek, as the government of China.21
 One-might logically inquire why states attach importance to
 concept that has so little substantive content. The answer appears h
 be that the importance attached to recognition derives in part fron
 the weight of tradition and in part from the sense of legitimacy recog
 nition confers. And because states granting or receiving recognitiot
 perceive the act as important, they have made it a precondition fo:
 other actions that do have inherent significance, such as the continu
 ante of aid or the resumption of diplomatic relations.
 The main importance of recognition over the years has been po-
 litical. Recognition has served as a rough initial indicator of a state's

 attitude toward a new actor on the international political scene and
 of the recognizing state's values and priorities in international affairs.
 If a state feels strongly about constitutional government and
 democratic rule it may refuse recognition until a new government
 promises to hold elections. If a state wishes to contest vigorously the
 spread of an ideology it may refuse to recognize governments of that
 persuasion that come to power. Or if a state wishes to protect the
 economic interests of its citizens in the foreign state it may condition
 recognition on economic or investment guarantees from the new
 government.
 On the other hand, if a state desires to protect national sover-
 eignty, or combat intervention in its internal affairs, it may adopt the
 Estrada Doctrine and reject the political use of recognition entirely.
 No one disputes that states repeatedly have used recognition to
 advance their political interests in the course of the past two centuries.
 The controversy concerns whether recognition has been effective in
 advancing the interests of the recognizing state, and if so, whether it
 is a legitimate political instrument.

 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND,
 1780-1960
 Obscurity shrouds the precise origins of the concept of recogniti
 of foreign governments. However, recognition finds its general I
 ginnings in the political doctrines of the European monarchies and t
 rise of the modern nation-state.
 The doctrine of the divine right of kings was paramount in t
 late Middle Ages in Europe and the sovereignty of the. king w
 identified with the sovereignty of the state. The king was the "chos,
 of God" and thus the only legitimate ruler. From this basic premi
 sprang the concept of legitimacy which provided that any govemme
 that came to power in a state depended for its legality not upon
 facto control, but upon compliance with the established legal order
 the state.'
 Legitimacy was first invoked on behalf of monarchical gover
 ments and reached its zenith in the period following the French Rev
 lution when the European monarchies banded together and determin,
 not to recognize a government created in open revolt. Diplomats at tl
 Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815 invoked the doctrine in their a
 tempts to restore monarchical regimes to power. The Quadruple Al
 ance formed during the Congress of Vienna likewise provided th
 sovereignty could not be acquired by an act of conquest. Thus, tl
 great powers hoped to defeat any revolutionary attempts to ups
 the status quo.
 It was within this conservative historical context that the Amet
 can Revolution occurred. Quite clearly, the United States, born c
 revolution, could not invoke legitimacy to prevent popular changes c

 government in foreign states. In fact, the Declaration of Independence
 had as one of its primal features the right of the people to overthrow
 an unjust government.
 Therefore, it came to the first secretary of state, Thomas Jeffer-
 son, to develop and put into practice a revolutionary new theory of
 recognition to counter the theory of legitimacy, one that gave effect
 to the consent of the governed' Jefferson developed what came to be
 known as the de facto theory of recognition, which holds that any
 government in effective control of a state and representing the will
 of the people should be accorded recognition. The European mon-
 archies regarded Jefferson's idea as an open encouragement to revo-
 lution.
 The de facto theory flowed inexorably from Jefferson's general
 political philosophy, the cornerstones of which were popular sover-
 eignty and the right to revolution. Jefferson, a follower of the social
 contract theory espoused by John Locke, believed that government
 was based on the consent of the people and that the people retained a
 right to abolish any unjust or unrepresentative government and es-
 tablish one that would represent their will. The step from this belief
 to the de facto theory of recognition is a short one. One historian has ?
 commented:
 Thomas Jefferson is rightly considered the author of
 many of the cardinal principles of United States foreign
 policy. No doctrine, however, bears more deeply the im-
 print of his political thinking than does our recognition
 policy. Indeed, so far removed were his doctrines from the
 accepted canons of international law, and even from the
 recent example of the recognition of the colonies by the
 French government, that it is impossible to trace any rela-
 tionship between the two. We are obliged to conclude, there-
 fore, that the ideas developed by Jefferson relative to the
 de facto principle of recognition were of his own invention
 and in no way connected with previous international
 precedents.'
 Jefferson first applied the principle in , 1792, upon the fall of the
 French monarchy, when he instructed the American ambassador in
 France:
 with our principles to acknowledge any Gov-
 ernment to be rightful which is formed by the will of the

 ,Untversity,191h1 .
 nation, substantially declared. The late government [set up
 in France by the Revolution of 1789) was of this kind, and
 was accordingly acknowledged by all the branches of ours;
 so any alteration of it which shall be made by the will of the
 nation, substantially declared, will doubtless be acknowl-
 edged in like manner.4
 In later instructions to the ambassador, Jefferson elaborated on the
 theme:
 We surely can not deny to any nation that right
 whereon our own Government is founded-that every one
 may govern itself according to whatever form it pleases,
 and change these forms at its own will; and that it may trans-
 act its business with foreign nations through whatever organ
 it thinks proper, whether King, convention, assembly, com-
 mittee, President, or anything else that it may choose. The
 will of the nation is the only thing essential to be regarded."
 Jefferson's ideas on recognition, enunciated in the above instruc-
 tions, became the foundation of American recognition policy. Under
 Jefferson's test, recognition was granted to a new government, what-
 ever the origin of the government, on the basis of two criteria:
 (1) The government to be recognized should be in actual control
 of the entire governmental authority.
 (2) The government to be recognized should represent the will
 of the nation, substantially declared.'
 During the early 'nineteenth century the United States became the
 foremost champion of the de facto theory of recognition. In devel-
 oping recognition- policy in this period the -foreign policy decision
 makers stressed the acceptance of the government de facto and as-
 sumed that the acquiescence of the people signified the will of the
 people.' Thus, for practical purposes, U.S. recognition policy was
 virtually automatic, turning solely on a question of fact-did the new
 government have effective control?" If it did, recognition was granted.'

 Whatever its democratic sympathies, the United States normally fol-
 lowed the simple formula that the government de facto was equally
 de jure1e
 Role of Congress
 Jefferson envisioned recognition as a function of the executive branch
 of government, and this is largely how the practice of granting recog-
 nition to new governments developed. Congress did however play a
 limited role in recognition in the early nineteenth century.
 In 1811, the House of Representatives passed a resolution claim-
 ing the prerogative of empowering the President to accord recognition
 by appropriating money to pay diplomatic agents to be assigned to
 the new powers. Similarly, Henry Clay argued for the proposition that
 Congress could grant recognition to new states or governments, rea-
 soning that by passing a statute regulating universal intercourse,
 recognition would be automatically conferred:
 This House unquestionably has a right to recognize in the
 exercise of the Constitutional power of Congress to regulate
 foreign commerce.... Suppose for example we passed an
 act to regulate trade between the United States and Buenos
 Aires [sic]; the existence of the nation would therefore be
 recognized as we could not regulate trade with a nation
 which does not exist."
 Clay made further attempts in 1818 and 1836 to gain at least con-
 current control for Congress of the power to recognize states and gov-
 ernments.. The, first attempt was through an amendment to an ap-
 propriation bill to include the sum of $18,000 for one year's salary of
 a minister to the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata and to pay the
 cost of maintaining an embassy. Clay felt that passage of the amend-
 ment would constitute recognition of the new state.
 In 1836 Clay introduced a resolption stating that the inde-

 has been by the-subversion of pre-existing Government or by the violent or

 pendence of Texas should be acknowledged by the United States
 whenever satisfactory information was received that it had a govern-
 ment capable of performing the duties and fulfilling the obligations of
 an independent nation. This resolution passed the Senate and was
 endorsed by President Jackson:
 It will always be considered consistent with the spirit of the
 Constitution, and most safe, that it, the spirit of recogni-
 tion, should be exercised, when probably leading to war,
 with a previous understanding with that body by whom war
 can alone be declared, and by whom all the provisions for
 sustaining its perils must be furnished.12
 Modification of De Facto Principle
 There was some modification of the de facto principle before the Civil
 War. In 1848, a number of revolutions occurred in Europe that evoked
 great sympathy in the United States and altered recognition policy by
 placing an emphasis on Jefferson's second criterion, the will of the
 nation, at the expense of the criterion of effective control.
 In February 1848, Secretary of State James Buchanan sent an in-
 struction to the U.S. minister in Paris that went beyond the de facto
 principle and indicated that recognition policy be applied to favor
 democratic government." The first part of the instruction to the
 minister paralleled the usual doctrine.
 '= John Bassett Moore, A Digest of International Law, vol. 1 (Washington, D.C.:
 Government Printing Office, 1906), p. 99. Congress has on various other occasions
 commented on Its role in the recognition of particular governments or states. In
 1864 the Committee on1breign Affairs in the House of Representatives advanced
 a resolution that stated: "Congress has a constitutional right.to an authoritative
 voice in declaring and prescribing the foreign policy.of the United States as well
 in the recognition of new Powers as In other matters." (H. Rep. 129, 38th Congress,
 1st session, p. 156.) In 1897 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended
 adoption by the Senate of a resolution which stated "that the independence of
 Cuba be, and the same is hereby, acknowledged by the United States of America."
 (Sen. Doc. 231, 56th Congress, 2nd session, p. 64.) These congressional actions
 concerned the recognition of a new state. However, Congress also took action
 on the issue of recognition of governments. In 1919 Senator Fall introduced a
 resolution that sought the removal of recognition -from the Carranza regime In
 Mexico; in 1922 a resolution was introduced to the effect that "the Senate of the
 United States favors the recognition of the present Soviet Government in Russia."
 (Ibid., 67th Congress, 2nd session, p. 6945.) Also with regard to the Soviet govern-
 ment, a resolution was Introduced in the House "directing the President of the
 United States to recognize the present government of Russia." (Ibid., 69th Con-
 gress, 1st session, p. 8872.) This material was first collected in T. Cole, The
 Recognition Policy of the United States since 1901 (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State
 University, 1928), pp. 12-13.

 In its intercourse with foreign nations the Government of
 the United States has, from its origin, always recognized de
 facto governments. We recognize the right of all nations to
 create and reform their political institutions according to
 their own will and pleasure. We do not go behind the exist-
 ing Government to involve ourselves in the question of
 legitimacy. It is sufficient for us to know that a government
 exists capable of maintaining itself, and then its recognition
 on our part inevitably follows.
 However, Secretary Buchanan then introduced a new factor: "Whilst
 this is our own settled policy, it does not follow that we can ever be
 indifferent spectators to the progress of liberty throughout the world,
 and especially in France. 1114  Secretary Buchanan believed that the
 United States should be the first to recognize the provisional govern-
 ment because of the democratic nature of the new regime. President
 Polk supported this idea in his message to Congress in 1848. He
 stated that while the policy of the United States has "ever been that
 of nonintervention in the domestic affairs of other countries, leaving
 to each to establish the form of government of its own choice, all
 U.S. sympathies were on the side of democracy and the new regime.""
 However if a return to democratic government was not involved,
 the normal procedure of recognizing any government in control of a
 state was followed. For example, the traditional policy of recognizing
 de facto governments was applied with vigor in 1856-1857 in the
 successive coups in Mexico 76 During these years there were a number
 of governmental changes in Mexico. Despite the rapidity of develop-
 ments the. United States recognized each, not concerning itself with
 the stability of the governments it recognized, much less with a com-
 mitment to constitutional government. In May 1856, President Frank-
 lin Pierce informed Congress that five successive governments had
 assumed authority in Mexico in the course of a few months and had
 been recognized successively by the United States."

 the new regime that resulted from the Hungarian revolution. The same response
 was used in the revolution of 1848-1549 in Germany, where the Buchanan
 corollary was used to fustify recognizing a de facto government more promptly
 and enthusiastically than was usual.

 The Recognition Practice from 1860 to 1913
 With the outbreak of the Civil War, American recognition policy be-
 came more complex as the United States began increasingly to look
 to other considerations besides the factual existence of a new govern-
 ment. Factors such as the extent to which the new government repre-
 sented the will of the nation, the degree of stability which the govern-
 ment possessed, and its willingness to fulfill international obligations,
 began to play roles in the decision to recognize."
 The first signs of a departure from the de facto policy came before
 the Civil War in the policy of Secretary of State Webster. When
 Louis Napoleon overthrew the French Republic and became virtual
 dictator of France in 1851, the United States was faced with a case of
 de facto control but with a return to conservative, monarchical gov-
 ernment. The United States did not extend recognition to the new
 regime immediately, but waited until a national plebiscite was held.
 Secretary Webster summarized the U.S. position in a communication
 to the American diplomatic representative in France:
 Before this reaches you, the election will be over; and if, as
 is probable, a decided majority of the people should be found
 to support the President, the course of duty for you will
 become plain. While we deeply regret the overthrow of pop-
 ular institutions, yet our ancient ally has still our good
 wishes for its prosperity and happiness, and we are bound
 to leave to her the choice of means for the promotion of
 those ends."
 This action-by Secretary Webster marked a significant deviation
 from past recognition practices, one that would appear in later policy.
 Here the United States waited until elections were held before grant-
 ing recognition, presumably relying on the second criterion of Jeffer-
 son's recognition formula-"the will of the people, substantially
 declared."
 The change in policy heralded by Secretary Webster came to
 fruition during the 1860s, as a result of the efforts of Secretary of
 State William Seward, who served under President Lincoln. One of
 has overthrown existing government and another has been esablished in Its
 place, according to pre-existing forms, or in a manner adopted for the occasion
 by those whom we may find in the actual possession of power. It is the more
 imperatively necessary to apply this rule to the Spanish-American republics, In
 consideration of the frequent and not seldom anomalous change or organization
 or administration which they undergo, and the revolutionary nature of most of
 the changes." Moore, Digest of International Law, vol. 1, p. 142.

 Seward's tasks was to prevent the recognition of the Confederacy by
 the great powers of Europe, a task that had an impact on Seward's
 views on general recognition policy. It was difficult for Seward to
 follow an automatic, factual policy of recognition while at the same
 time opposing the right of other nations to recognize the Confederate
 government"
 According to some historians, the principle that Seward devel-
 oped was based on the fortuitous fact that the Confederate States of
 America, because of wartime conditions, never convened a popularly
 chosen Constituent Assembly nor held elections for a legislative body.
 Seward seized on this historical accident, so it is argued, to develop
 the principle that only a regularly organized state formally accepted
 by the people under its jurisdiction merited recognition. In this in-
 auspicious situation some find "the origin of the doctrine that 'free
 elections' are requisite to a government's recognition by the United
 States."21
 A British jurist, Hersh Lauterpacht, more accurately pointed to
 the real origin of this principle. While Seward did seize upon the
 anomaly to justify nonrecognition of the Confederacy, statements by
 Seward, and before him Secretary Webster, reflect a deep concern
 for the instability pervading Latin America and a growing dissatis-
 faction with the never-ending line of military dictatorships. The de
 facto principle advanced by.Jefferson was aimed at elevating the will
 of the people against the encroachments of monarchical legitimism.
 As Lauterpacht notes, -however, when it became apparent that ad-
 herence to de facto recognition resulted in substituting the tyranny
 of ruthless and adventurous dictatorships for that of monarchies, the
 United States adopted the principle of subsequent legitimation by the
 people."
 In 1862 Seward refused to recognize a new government in Vene-
 zuela despite its de facto establishment. Seward indicated there was
 a Revolutionary spirit pervading the republican states on
 this continent, and that the United States therefore deemed
 it a duty to discourage that spirit so far as it can be done by
 standing entirely aloof from all-such domestic controversies
 until, in each case, the state immediately concerned shall

 versity Press, 1947), pp. 113-46.
 unmistakably prove that the government which claims to
 represent it is fully accepted and peacefully maintained by
 the people thereof."
 Seward went further in modifying the traditional de facto policy
 in 1866 by instructing the American minister to Peru not to recognize
 a revolutionary regime that had seized power: "Revolutions in repub-
 lican states ought not to be accepted until the people have adopted
 them by organic law with the solemnities which would seem sufficient
 to guarantee their stability and permanency."24 Seward felt that the
 de facto recognition policy stimulated unrest by making it too easy
 for a self-seeking group of revolutionaries to obtain governmental
 status .*t Therefore in such situations recognition should be withheld
 until there was, evidence of a "formal acquiescence and acceptance of
 the new regime *by the people."" The Seward argument bears a
 marked similarity to that advanced by the monarchies of Jefferson's
 time.
 Later administrations did not adopt the Seward view whole-
 heartedly. Nonetheless, the United States did apply Seward's criteria
 to various coups in Latin America in the latter half of the nineteenth
 century. In 1880, the Department of State instructed the American
 minister to Peru to recognize a new regime in Peru if it was "sup-
 ported by the character and intelligence of Peru and is really endeavor-
 ing to restore constitutional government." In 1883, the United States
 recognized a new regime in Peru only after the new president was
 confirmed in office by a representative assembly. In 1885, after one
 government had fallen from power, the Department of State an-
 nounced that+ ;the new president would be recognized "when his
 authority shall have been confirmed by the Peruvian people."27

 the people. U.S. Department of State, Diplomatic Correspondence, vol. 2 (1368),

 War.= Technically, this was not a new criterion, since the principle
 was accepted that the obligations of a state are not affected by changes
 of government" However, in the years after the Civil War, the
 United States would not assume that any government in actual con-
 trol would acknowledge or fulfill its international obligations, that is,
 would honor treaties and agreements entered into by the preceding
 regime.
 The reason for the increased U.S. interest in this factor, and its
 application to recognition policy, lay in the growing economic interests
 of the United States in foreign lands. In the second half of the nine-
 teenth century the United States enjoyed a period of sustained eco-
 nomic growth and expansion, and it became a major creditor nation.
 Recognition policy was altered to serve this new interest.
 Many of the states in which Americans invested substantially
 suffered from chronic political instability and deep-seated poverty.
 This combination resulted in frequent defaults on government bonds
 and other instruments, making such investments risky. In an attempt
 to protect American holdings, the United States relied on recognition
 as a bargaining weapon and increasingly insisted on evidence that a
 new government would pay its debts and respect foreign investment'0
 In its zeal to protect legitimate interests, the United States repeatedly
 overstepped the bounds of legitimate action and actually took direct
 control of the finances of Haiti and the Dominican Republic in order
 to ensure the sanctity of American investments. Recognition of new
 governments was a handmaiden of the overall drive to protect U.S.
 financial interests''

 Similarly, in 1877, the United States withheld recognition from
 a new government in Mexico because of "occurrences on the Rio
 Grande border" that raised questions about the willingness of the
 new regime to honor. its international obligations."
 These incidents ultimately subsided and formal recognition was
 granted the next year (May 1878).
 The emphasis on fulfillment of international obligations grew
 more marked at the turn of the century during the presidencies of
 Roosevelt and Taft. Roosevelt utilized recognition policy as "a means
 of enforcing his demands-a means to see that American interests
 were protected and advanced."" Taft, if anything, was more aggres-
 sive than Roosevelt in protecting American financial interests. As one
 historian commented: "If Roosevelt-had been painstaking in looking
 after the rights of Americans in foreign states and especially in Latin
 America, Taft was actually aggressive in attempting to aid American
 financiers in those regions.""
 The emphasis on international obligations was limited almost ex-
 clusively to the Latin American area. As one historian commented in
 regard to recognition of a new government, in Serbia in 1903:
 The fact that: no special mention was made of international
 obligations in the correspondence. leading up to the recog-
 nition of the government headed by Karageorgevitch does
 not signify by any means that this instance furnishes an ex-
 ception to a rather well established rule. American financiers
 had not found in Serbia the rich opportunity for investment
 that they had found in Latin America, and American citizens
 had not yet begun to travel or reside in this part of the
 world in any numbers. De facto control only was necessary in

 were both essential in Latin-American states"
 Recognition Practice toward Coups d'etat In Central America. Prin-
 ciples different from those applied to other states governed the grant
 of recognition to states in Central America in the early part of the
 twentieth century. The general instability in Latin America was espe-
 cially pronounced in Central America and there was almost continual
 warfare in the region in the early twentieth century." President
 Roosevelt arranged a conference in 1907 to consider the problem, and
 several conventions were agreed upon, including an annex on recog-
 nition policy that was agreed to by Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras,
 Nicaragua, and El Salvador. The annex provided:
 ARTICLE L. The government of the high contracting
 parties shall not recognize any other government which may
 come into power in any of the five Republics as a conse-
 quence of coup d'etat, or of a revolution against the
 recognized government, so long as the freely elected repre-
 sentatives of tie people thereof, have not constitutionally
 reorganized the country.
 ARTICLE 2. No government of Central America shall
 in case of civil war intervene in favor of or against the gov-
 ernment of the country where the struggle is taking place.
 ARTICLE 3. The Governments of Central America, in
 the first place, are recommended to endeavor to bring about,
 by the means at their command, a constitutional reform in
 the sense of prohibiting the re-election of the President of a
 republic, where such prohibition does not exist, secondly to
 adopt all measures necessary to effect a complete guarantee
 of the principle of alternation in power."
 The United States was not a party to the treaty but agreed to follow
 the policy enunciated in the annex in ?granting or withholding recogni-
 tion to new governments in the five states of Central America." Thus
 the criterion of explicit popular support or subsequent ratification by
 election which had before been invoked in an ad hoc manner was
 placed on a formal juridical footing In Central America.

 The 1907 treaty was replaced in 1923 by a considerably more
 drastic version. Under the treaty of 1907 the revolutionary forces
 could retain power and legalize their position by means of elections.
 This opportunity was foreclosed by the treaty of 1923 which forbade
 the leader of the revolutionary forces from assuming control of the
 government even if he won a free election following the coup and
 commanded strong popular support.'0
 Both the 1907 and the 1923 treaties had repeated application.
 Coups occurred in all the Central American countries. Revolutions or
 coups d'etat occurred in Nicaragua in 1909, 1912, and 1926. Honduras
 experienced coups in 1911, 1919, 1924, and 1931. General Tinoco
 assumed power in Costa Rica by extraconstitutional means in 1917.
 Guatemalan'governments were overthrown three times in this period,
 first in the Cabrera coup in 1920, next in the Herrara coup in 1921,
 and finally in the Orellano coup in 1930. A coup occurred in El
 Salvador in 1931."
 In each coup, the United States ostensibly followed the treaty
 in force at that time. However, the actual policy followed by the
 United States government varied considerably depending on the
 political forces involved. For example, President Taft and Secretary of
 State Knox were strongly opposed to President Zelaya of Nicaragua
 and favored the coup against him in 1909. To aid the anti-Zelaya
 forces, President Taft refused to allow anyone associated with Zelaya
 to stand for the presidential election. Similarly, President Wilson was
 bitterly opposed to General Tinoco, who assumed power in Costa
 Rica in 1917. Thus, despite the fact that Tinoco met the requirements
 of the 1907 treaty, President Wilson refused to recognize Tinoco's
 government.42.-
 In Nicaragua, the United States recognized Adolfo Diaz as presi-
 dent even though he was an uncle of one of the leaders of the coup
 against the existing government, an action in violation of the treaty.
 The United States repeated the violation in 1926 when it recognized
 Moncado as president of Nicaragua following the overthrow of Diaz,
 "Secretary of State Stimson outlined United States policy in a statement: "'It
 [policy of not recognizing unconstitutional governments] Is quite different from
 the general policy of this country and from the general policy of international
 law toward the recognition of governments in the world at large.' The reason
 for adopting a more stringent policy in regard to Central America was that the
 five governments of that area had agreed to apply the restrictions themselves,
 'with the object evidently of discouraging a revolution or coup d'etat within the
 five Republics."' Department of State, Problem of Recognition in American For-
 eign Policy, p. 57.

 even though Moncado had led the coup' The failure of the United
 States to follow either the letter or the spirit of the 1907 and 1923
 treaties led to criticism that U.S. policy was not to discourage revolu-

 The bloodless Tinoco overthrow of the Gonzalez regime in Costa
 Rica provides a graphic illustration of the deep     involvement
 the internal affairs of a Central American country as a result of the
 1907 treaty. On January 25, 1917, General Frederico Tinoco over-
 threw President Alfredo Gonzalez, who claimed that  conflict over
 an oil concession to American businessmen was the principal
 the coup. Tinoco nevertheless was initially popular with the people
 and quickly placed his regime on a constitutional basis. He held elec-
 tions on April 1, 1917, received an overwhelming majority, and was
 proclaimed president by the Constitutional Assembly. President Wil-
 son refused to recognize the Tinoco government even though it was
 eligible under the 1907 treaty. Indeed, the United States hardened its
 stand and informed Central American governments that recognition
 of Tinoco would not be "evidence of a friendly feeling toward the
 United Stites."" Despite this warning, all Central American govern-
 ments, save Nicaragua, granted recognition as did most South Ameri-
 can and European governments.'s Historians cite two reasons for the
 U.S. nonrecognition: the doctrine of constitutionalism

 view that Tinoco had staged the coup.                  result of
 the actions of American businessmen.
 In August 1917 internal problems multiplied, and Tinoco stepped
 down in favor of Juan Bautista Quiros. The United States refused to
 recognize Quiros, and he stepped down after twenty days in favor
 of Francisco Aguilar Barquero, whom the United States said should
 be the president because he was the third designate elected in 1914
 under the 1871 Constitution. This position was outlined by the secre-
 tary of state:
 The governmental power should be deposited in the
 hands of Francisco Aguilar Barquero, successor to the execu-
 tive power, under the Alfredo Gonzalez regime. Barquero
 should hold free and open elections for president at earliest
 possible date. Were this done, it would appear that the
 necessary legal formalities had been complied with to con-

 stitute a legitimate government worthy of recognition by the
 Government of the United States."
 The U.S. action was bitterly resented in Costa Rica. When Aguilar
 was elected designate in 1914, his term was only four years; Costa
 Ricans regarded as ridiculous the argument that he was the "legal"
 president in 1919.
 The Recognition Policy of Woodrow Wilson
 President Wilson made significant changes in the traditional recogni-
 tion doctrine by extending to all Latin America the constitutional
 criterion that had previously been applied on a formal basis only to
 the five republics of Central America.
 On March 11, 1913, seven days after he assumed office, Presi-
 dent Wilson set forth in a public statement the principles for recogni-
 tion to be followed not only in the case at hand but also in future
 actions. His statement was a strong endorsement of a policy designed
 to strengthen constitutional democracy.
 Cooperation is possible only when supported at every
 turn by the orderly processes of just government based upon
 law, not upon arbitrary or irregular force. We hold, as I am
 sure all thoughtful leaders of republican government every-
 where hold, that just government rests always upon the con-
 sent of the governed, and that there can be no freedom
 without order based upon law and upon the public con-
 science and approval. We shall look to make these principles
 the basis oftnutual intercourse, respect, and helpfulness be-
 tween our sister republics and ourselves. We shall lend our
 influence of every kind to the realization of these principles
 in fact and practice, knowing that disorder, personal in-
 trigues, and defiance of constitutional rights weaken and
 discredit government and injure none so much as the people
 who are unfortunate enough to have their common life and
 their common affairs so tainted and disturbed. We can have
 no sympathy with those who seek to seize the power of
 government to advance their own personal interests or
 ambitions."
 Wilson's policy was a significant though not total break with
 past recognition policy. The legitimist criteria of the Central America
 Treaty of 1907 served as a limited precedent for it as did Secretary

 Seward's requirement of explicit popular support. Nonetheless, the
 Wilson policy marked a strong shift In emphasis 45
 The Wilson administration utilized recognition as a political
 sanction to support constitutionalism, particularly in Latin America,
 and to discourage the overthrow of existing governments. There is
 an ironic parallel between Wilson's use of recognition to discourage
 dictators and encourage democracy and the European monarchies' use
 of recognition to discourage democracy and encourage the monarchical
 form of government in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries"
 Wilson did not apply this policy often in non-Western Hemis-
 phere changes of government 60 and even in Latin America he did not
 invoke it consistently, not applying it to revolutionary governments
 that seized power in Peru in 1914 and 1919. On the other hand, he
 did apply it against new regimes in Mexico, the Dominican Republic,
 Ecuador, Haiti, and Cuba sr
 Perhaps the primal illustration of the Wilson approach is found
 in his dealings with General Huerta of Mexico who came to power in
 1913. President Wilson stated in August 1913, in instructions to a
 personal representative who was to negotiate with Mexican authori-
 4" Department of State, Problem of Recognition in American Foreign Policy, p. 36.
 One historian commenting on this parallel noted: "Recognition thus came to be
 used as a means of ensuring democratic regimes, at least in middle America, upon
 the assumption, presumably, that only such regimes were consonant with the
 Pan American Ideal. The conception of recognition as a moral sanction repre-
 sented a throwback to the legitimist principle of the eighteenth and early nine-
 teenth centuries. Under that arrangement established governments operated their
 own club with rules of their own choosing and required applicants for member-
 ship to comply with those rules. Those rules were based upon the supposed
 interests of monarchies and the rights of dynastic succession. That system had
 been rejected by the young American nations as they took their places in the
 international community. But in what Baty has called 'this illogical twentieth
 century' it has been resurrected, not, as formerly, for the purpose of defending
 monarchy, but rather as a means for promoting democratic or constitutional
 legitimacy.. The actual existence of a regime in power in a state and its con-
 tinuance in power were not deemed sufficient proof that its power rested upon
 the consent of the governed." D. Dozier, "Recognition in Contemporary Inter-
 American Relations," lournal of Inter-American Studies, vol. 8 (1966), pp. 322-323.

 "The most.signif cant issue of recognition to arise in Europe during the Wilson
 presidencywas that occasioned by the overthrow of the provisional government
 of Russia (under Alexander Kers sky) by the Bolsheviks on November y, 1917.
 The provisional government had assumed power upon the abdication of the Tzar
 of Russia, Nidrolas II, on Mardi 7, 1917. It was accorded U.S. recognition on
 March 20. However, the United States withheld recognition of the new Bolshevik
 government for sixteen years, until November 26, 1933. The reasons underlying
 the refusal to recognize are well known, and centered on the Bolshevik unwilling-
 ness to honor international obligations and the United States aversion to the
 revolutionary nature of Communist ideology.

 ties, the conditions he thought necessary for a satisfactory settlement
 of the recognition question:
 (1) An immediate cessation of fighting throughout Mexico,
 a definite armistice solemnly entered into and scrupu-
 lously observed;
 (2) Security guaranteed for an early and free election in
 which all will agree to take part;
 (3) The consent of General Huerta to bind himself not to be
 a candidate for election as President of the Republic at
 this election; and
 (4) The agreement of all parties to abide by the results of
 the election and cooperate in the most loyal way in
 organizing and supporting the new administration.62
 Huerta rejected the conditions. Wilson then maintained his policy of
 nonrecognition for -two-and-one-half years, even after Huerta had
 been elected by the Mexican people, until Carianza came to power in
 1915 and was accorded recognition !i? Not surprisingly, the Wilsonian
 recognition policy was criticized, especially by Latin Americans, as
 placing one state, the United States, in the position of making itself
 the arbiter over the internal affairs of another, thus violating the
 principle of nonintervention.
 President Wilson generally sought to use recognition as a po-
 litical weapon to strengthen constitutional government. However, he
 violated his own ideals on occasion, and attempted to exclude from
 power certain political leaders the United States did not favor, even
 after they had been elected. On other occasions he accorded recog
 nition to governMents before elections were held if he perceived this
 to be in the national interest of the United States.
 The Recognition Policies of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover
 The decade of the 1920s, and the presidencies of Harding, Coolidge,
 and Hoover, saw a renewed emphasis on American economic interests.
 When Harding took office, the question of the recognition of the
 Obregon regime in Mexico was outstanding. American investors in
 Mexican oil and mining were concerned with a provision of the Mexi-

 can constitution which separated sub-soil mineral rights from the title
 to the surface.
 Senator Albert Fall, the secretary of the interior under Harding,
 set out the basic United States position: "So long as I have any-
 thing to do with the Mexican question, no government of Mexico will
 be recognized with my consent, which does not first enter into a
 written agreement promising to protect American citizens and their
 property rights in Mexico. 144 Secretary of State Hughes reiterated
 this position. Nevertheless, President Obregon refused the offer to
 negotiate, contending that he would accept recognition only on an
 equal basis with the United States and on terms that did not compro-
 mise Mexico's sovereignty. The United States rejected this view and
 advanced the unique argument that recognition did not fall within
 the scope of international law but was purely a domestic question.
 The United States then withheld recognition for two and one-half
 years, even though all Latin American states had recognized the
 Obregon government .55
 The constitutionalist views of President Wilson, while not totally
 rejected by the Harding and Coolidge administrations, were relegated
 to a position of less importance in U.S. recognition policy. The ad-
 ministrations of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover normally accepted
 the general acquiescence of the people as sufficient and did not re-
 quire formal evidence of popular support for a government that
 came to power through extraconstitutional means. The administration

 existence. He retained but deemphasized the requirement that a new
 government give evidence of its willingness to fulfill international
 obligations. President Roosevelt and his secretary of state, Cordell
 Hull, also stressed the need for consultation among American re-
 publics before extending recognition to a new government in the
 Western Hemispheres'
 President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy toward Latin Amer-
 ica rested on the doctrine of nonintervention. As a corollary, no test
 of recognition could pass judgment on the constitutionality of the
 internal processes of foreign governments. In a direct repudiation of
 the Wilsonian doctrine, President Roosevelt stated in 1933 that he
 favored a policy of nonintervention and mutual consultation:
 The maintenance of constitutional government in other
 nations is not a sacred obligation devolving upon the United
 States alone. The maintenance of law and orderly processes
 of government in this hemisphere is the concern of each
 individual nation within its own borders first of all. . . . If
 and when the.failure of orderly processes affects the other
 nations of the continent it becomes the joint concern of the
 whole continent in which we are all neighbors."
 Despite this general policy, recognition of new regimes in Latin
 America did not become automatic. Indeed, in the thirteen years of
 the Roosevelt presidency, recognition, of new governments was con-
 sidered in fifteen instances and significantly delayed or withheld for
 political purposes on five occasions."
 64 Until the 1920s recognition was an unilateral act, completely within the dis-
 cretion of the recognizing state. The 1920s saw the first halting movement by an
 international body touronsider the issue, and in 1925, there was an attempt by an
 inter-American judicial body to codify recognition practice. Following this, no
 further inter-American steps were taken to codify recognition practice or pro-
 vide for collective recognition action until the 1940s. The recognition issue in-
 creasingly became integrated into the general fabric of the developing inter-
 American system, and acquired procedures not present in recognition policy in
 other areas of the world. ibid., p. 66.
 w Ibid., pp. 67-68.
 ss For example, recognition was withheld for two years in the United States
 response to the Hernandez Martinez regime in El Salvador which took power in
 December 1931. When Roosevelt assumed office, the 1923 treaty concerning recog-
 nition of new Central American governments was still in effect. Consequently, when
 General Hernandez Martinez assumed power, the United States took the posi-
 tion that recognition could not be accorded because the assumption of power
 violated the terms of the 1923 treaty. Martinez had assumed the presidency
 through military coup d'etat, and the new regime had not been ratified through
 free elections. Also, Martinez was disqualified from the presidency since he
 had been minister of war within six months of the coup. In February 1932 the
 United States rejected a plan to have Martinez deposit the power of the press-,
 dency in the first vice-president for six months and reassume the presidency
 thereafter.

 The overall United States attitude toward military coups in Latin
 America and recognition of the new regimes is perhaps best captured
 in a telegram from an embassy official concerning the U.S. position
 on the assumption of power in Ecuador by General Enriquez in 1937:
 A military dictatorship under one guise or another will
 continue in power in Ecuador for some time to come with
 possible occasional changes in the supreme chief. The ques-
 tion, therefore, would seem to be the recognition of that
 form of government which apparently is accepted by the
 people of Ecuador because (Ist) they have no other choice
 and (2nd) they seem resigned to the fact that constitutional
 government cannot be had. Accordingly, we shall probably
 continue to have to deal with this form of government ?0
 Influence of World War II on Recognition Policy. With the outbreak
 of World War II, the American states established the Inter-American
 Emergency Advisory Committee for Political Defense for the purpose
 of studying and coordinating measures for preventing subversive ac-
 tivities that might be harmful to the security of the American re-
 publics. The committee in 1943 adopted a Resolution on the Recogni-
 tion of New Governments Instituted by Force which provided:
 For the duration of the present world conflict they do not
 proceed to the recognition of a new government instituted
 by. force, before consulting among themselves for the pur-
 pose of determining whether this government complies with
 the inter-American undertakings of the defense of the Conti-
 nent, nor before carrying out an exchange of information as
 Finally, almost two years later, with Martinez still in power, Costa Rica and
 El Salvador renounced the 1923 treaty and Costa Rica recognized the Martinez
 regime. Shortly thereafter the other three Central American states extended
 recognition through an agreement that the 1923 treaty would continue to bind
 them, but would not bind either Costa Rica or El Salvador. The United States
 accorded recognition one day after the Central American states. Department of
 State, Bureau of Public Affairs, Historical Office, U.S. Policy toward Latin

 With the advent of the war, and the establishment of the inter-
 American committee, the attitude of the new regime toward the war,
 and specifically toward the Axis powers, became of prime importance
 in the recognition decision 62
 The influence of the war issue on the U.S. recognition decision
 is illustrated in the assumption of power in Argentina by General
 Edelmiro Farrell in February 1944. Upon taking control, the Farrell
 government appointed a pro-Axis general as the head of press and
 information, granted contracts to German firms for the construction
 of barracks, and censored U.S. films. The United States reacted
 strongly to these moves, stating that it had "reason to believe that
 groups not 'in*sympathy with the declared Argentine policy of join-
 ing the defense of the Hemisphere were active" in the assumption
 of power by Farrell." The U.S. ambassador recommended a "minimum
 action program" as a precondition to recognition to include "liquida-

 Villarroel assumed power in Bolivia in December 1943. On the day of the coup,
 the U.S. ambassador recommended that recognition not be granted until the
 government deported certain Nazis and Japanese. Secretary Hull on December
 22 told the press that the attitude of the Villarroel government toward the war
 effort was of first importance and the United States was concerned whether out-
 side influence unfriendly to the Allied cause played any part in the assumption of
 power by Villarroel.
 Secretaq. Hull went further on January,24 and accused .the Villarroel govern-
 ment of finks to subversive elements hostile to the Allied cause. According to
 Hull, the Bolivian coup was "but one act committed by a general subversive
 movement having for its purpose steadily expanding activities on the continent."
 Nineteen Latin American states refused to recognize the Villarroel government
 on the same grounds. The "Axis taint" precluded recognition. In May, Villarroel
 offered to trade the deportation of Axis nationals for United States recognition.
 The United States refused the offer.
 However, the Bolivian cabinet voted to detain and expel Axis nationals any-
 way because It wished to identify itself with the Allied war effort. Based on
 this and other actions friendly to the Allied cause, and after extensive contact
 between American and Bolivian officials, the United States finally extended
 recognition on June 23. Department of State, U.S. Policy toward Latin America,

 recognition continued for a year until Argentina on March 27,    ,
 declared war on the Axis states and pledged adherence to the acts of
 the Mexico City conference!"
 In contrast to the lengthy delay where Axis sympathy was sus-
 pected, the United States promptly granted recognition to new regimes
 in Ecuador in June 1944 and Guatemala in November 1944. The
 United States did wait until elections were held in the case of Guate-
 mala, but since elections were held only two weeks after the coup, the
 delay was not substantial."
 Other Parts of the World. Outside the Western Hemisphere, President
 Roosevelt generally adhered to the principle of nonintervention " The
 President refused to grant recognition in the Spanish Civil War until
 all effective resistance to the national regime had ended. In the grant
 of recognition to the Franco government, President Roosevelt followed
 the traditional policy of recognizing a new government solely on the
 basis of its de facto existence"
 However, the question of recognition did not arise in areas out-
 side Latin America often enough to result in the development of a
 consistently applied policy. Africa, which was to become a fertile
 ground for military coups in the 1960s, was still under colonial con-
 '+

 "On June 7, 1943, following the resignation of President Arturo Rawson of
 Argentina, General Pedro P. Ramirez assumed the presidency and command of
 the armed forces. The United States accorded recognition four days later after
 receiving assurances that the new regime would support the war effort. The
 tenor of the United States position is reflected in a statement made to the Argen-
 tine Foreign Ministry upon the grant of recognition:      United States views]
 with satisfaction the public declarations of the new Argentine Government
 affirming a policy of friendship and loyal cooperation with the nations of America
 in accordance with the agreements In force, and that this policy will be imply
 mented by acts. This assurance is especially welcome in view of the fact that
 these agreements were designed to protect the safety of all American nations
 which now is gravely threatened by the lawless aggressors." Department of

 *v The statement of Secretary Hull In a letter to Representative Tinkham on
 May 16, 1936, was frequently referred to by o81cers of the Department of State
 to explain the prerequisites to recognition of new governments: "It is the rule of
 the United States 'to defer recognition   another executive tive in Its place until
 it shall appear that it is In possession of the           of the state, adminis-
 terbng government with the assent of the people thereof and without substantial
 resistance to its authority, and that It Is in a position to fulfill all the Inter-
 national obligations and responsibilities incumbent upon a sovereign state under
 treaties and international law.'" Whiteman, Digest of international Law, vol 2,

 trot. Liberia was an exception, and the United States accorded recog-
 nition to the administration of President Edwin Barclay in June 1935.
 Europe of course did not spawn many coups d'etat or revolutions dur-
 ing this time, although the annexation of sovereign states by the Axis
 powers did raise recognition problems, both at the time of conquest
 and at the time of liberation and the formation of new governments.
 The Near East and South Asia as well as the Far East were still largely
 under colonial control, or were relatively stable during the Roosevelt
 years.
 The Recognition Policy of Harry Truman
 Latin America. A move to codify inter-American recognition practice
 was made in 1945.when Guatemala presented a draft resolution to
 the Inter-American Conference in Mexico City. The resolution, which
 did not enjoy U.S.- support, provided that American nations refrain
 from granting recognition to antidemocratic regimes that might estab-
 lish themselves in any state in the hemisphere. The Guatemalan reso-
 lution was defeated. However, two resolutions on the issue were
 adopted. The first stated that the right of maintaining, suspending, or
 renewing diplomatic relations should not be exercised as a means of
 obtaining unjustified advantages under international law. The second
 resolution provided that the establishment or maintenance of diplo-
 matic relations with a government did not imply any judgment upon
 the domestic policies of that government."
 In the Truman years, nineteen changes of government in Latin
 America were achieved through extraconstitutional means. Almost
 all the changes Were military-inspired, and in over half?(ten of nine-
 teen) the United, States delayed recognition. This reflected a policy
 decision made within the Department of State to proceed cautiously
 in recognizing military governments."
 Dean Acheson characterized the recognition policy toward
 changes of government in Latin American in a 1949 speech to the
 Pan American Society:
 Our policy with respect to recognizing new governments in
 Latin America is not inconsistent with our encouragement of
 democracy. We maintain diplomatic relations with other
 countries primarily because we are all on the same planet
 and must do business with each other.... When a freely
 elected government is overthrown and a new and perhaps

 militaristic government takes over, we do not need to recog-
 nize the new government automatically and immediately. We
 can wait to see if it really controls its territory and intends to
 live up to its international commitments. We can consul ,
 with other governments, as we have often done. But if and
 when we do recognize a government under these circum-
 stances, our act of recognition need not be taken to imply
 approval of it or its policy.71
 This policy resulted in ultimate recognition of most military govern-
 ments after a short delay to determine if the regime controlled the
 territory of the state and was willing to honor its international obliga-
 tions. Delay also resulted from the practice of consulting with other
 American states. In practice, as George Kennan aptly noted, recog-
 nition was accorded after an interval neither so short as to be unWgni-
 fied nor so long as to make recognition a source of conflict between
 the United States and the new governments."
 In the majority of instances the United States accorded recogni-
 tion within a month after it satisfied itself that the usual criteria had
 been fulfilled. The following statement prepared for Secretary 'Ache-
 son for use regarding the June 1951 military coup d'etat in Bolivia is
 representative:
 From appearances to date the Junta has met the criteria
 which the U.S. has applied in other recent cases involving
 the recognition of Latin American governments which have
 come to power through irregular procedures. It has estab-
 lished its authority over Bolivian territory, with the substan-
 tial acquiescence of its people, it has declared its intent to
 honor Bolivian international obligations, and its assumption
 of power has not been due to any external infiuences.'s
 In certain cases when the United States was displeased, especially
 where a constitutional government was overthrown by the military,
 as in Venezuela in November 1948, recognition was delayed for a
 period of months. This was sometimes accompanied by United States
 Interest in a promise to return to constitutional government .74

 T4 For example, recognition was delayed for several months In         to the
 January 11, 1946, assumption of power in Haiti, by the?mtlitary. 11w United
 States acted cautiously because It did not wish to encourage the establishment
 of military regimes that promised to observe democratic practices to gain recog-
 nition but then ignored their promises after recognition was granted. Department
 of State, U.S. Policy toward Latin America, pp. 45-46.
 However, the United States was hesitant to utilize recognition
 as a club to secure the promise of elections. For example, in the Feb-
 ruary 1949 forced resignation of President Juan Natalicio Gonzalez of
 Paraguay, the American charge recommended that recognition not be
 granted and that relations be suspended until the new government
 complied with its promise to hold elections. The Department of State
 rejected this approach, doubting that the suspension of relations, and
 presumably the withholding of recognition, would effectively en-
 courage democratic processes or increase stability.'s
 Other Parts of the World. Like the Roosevelt administration, the
 Truman administration did not confront, at least in the traditional
 sense, enough extraconstitutional changes of government outside
 Latin America to develop a policy. The "minimal" recognition criteria
 were applied in it 'routine fashion, as this response to a coup d'etat in
 Syria in 1949 reflects;
 The Legation has been instructed to inform the Min-
 istry that the United States Government has noted with
 satisfaction the public assurances which His Excellency the
 Prime Minister, Colonel Husni Zaim, has made affirming the
 intention of the new Syrian Government to discharge Syria's
 obligations arising out of all treaties and international agree-
 ments entered into by previous Syrian Governments, as well
 as its attachment to democratic principles and its intention
 to hold new elections at an early date.
 The Legation avails itself of this opportunity to renew
 to the Ministry the assurances of its highest consideration."
 T` A similar hesitance is found in the response of Secretary Acheson to another
 coup in Paraguay in 1949, where he felt that to withhold recognition until after
 elections occurred: "might be interpreted as an endorsement of the quality of
 these elections."
 This interpretation, the secretary felt, would be particularly damaging since
 it would lend support to the erroneous but widely held belief that recognition
 implied approval of a new regime. To rebut this misconception, the secretary
 stressed on numerous occasions, such as the takeover by Arnulfo Art" in
 Panama In December 1949, that recognition did not constitute "approval of the
 manner in which the present government came into power." Department of State,
 U.S. Policy toward Latin America, pp. 46-47.
 Ts Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 2, p. 455. Similarly, when another
 government was formed in Syria on August 14, 1949, It was promptly recognized
 on the same criteria: "The United States Government relies upon the assurances
 given to it by the Syrian Government that Syria Intends to honor its international
 obligations, and trusts that the friendly relations between our two nations will
 be continued. The promulgation on September 11, 1949, of a new electoral law
 reflecting the Syrian Government's intention to hold elections and form a con-
 stitutional government has also been noted." (Ibid., p. 455.)

 However, the Truman administration faced difficult recognition deci-
 sions in two separate instances outside Latin America: (1) the assump-
 tion of power by Mao Tse-tung in China, and (2) the liberation of
 states in Central Europe from Axis control.
 In perhaps the most celebrated instance on nonrecognition in
 modern times, the United States withheld recognition from the new
 government of the People's Republic of China, which was proclaimed
 in Peking on September 21, 1949. The establishment of a government
 headed by Mao Tse-tung followed the crossing of the Yangtze River
 by Communist troops, and the evacuation of Nanking by the govern-
 ment of the Republic of China. The government of the Republic of
 China moved to Canton, then to Chungking, and finally to Taipei in
 December 1949.
 President Truman and the Department of State refused recogni-
 tion to the new government and continued recognition of the Chiang
 Kai-shek government on several grounds. First, the Mao government
 was not in control of the entire land mass of China, and a rival gov-
 ernment already recognized by the United States continued to func-
 tion. Second, the new Communist government did not represent the
 will of the Chinese people. Third, the Communist government was
 not willing to honor all its international obligations. Fourth, as a
 sovereign state the United States was free to withhold recognition
 rather than accord recognition to a government that fomented revolu-
 tion and hatred of the United States" Nonrecognition continued for
 the duration of the Truman presidency.
 Communist activity also presented President Truman with recog-
 nition problems in another area of the world, the sovereign states that
 had been conquered and occupied by the Axis powers during World
 War II. In February 1945 at the Yalta conference, the United States,
 Great Britain, and the Soviet Union in a unanimous "Declaration on
 Liberated Europe" agreed that the three governments would assist
 the liberated states "to form interim governmental authorities broadly
 representative of all democratic elements in the population and
 pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections
 of governments responsive to the will of the people."r" In certain
 cases, such as Albania, major problems arose and recognition was not
 accorded?' However, in other instances elections were held, a new

 government was formed, and recognition was promptly accorded, as
 occurred in Poland.80
 The Recognition Policy of Dwight Eisenhower
 Latin America. Recognition policy toward Latin America under Eisen-
 hower was dominated by two considerations: (1) the new regime
 should be in effective control of the state; and (2) the new regime
 should be anti-Communist. If both factors were met, recognition was
 promptly extended, even though in some instances an elected president
 might be replaced by a right-wing military junta that repressed human
 rights or violated civil liberties. While the United States still inquired
 whether the new regime was willing to honor its international obli-
 gations, this was, in most cases, merely pro forma. Elections were
 seldom mentioned when the United States extended recognition, and
 rarely was a promise to hold elections, legislative or presidential, ad-
 vanced as a condition to recognition.
 The Eisenhower administration faced nineteen instances in Latin
 America where the question of recognition arose. In only two cases
 was recognition delayed, and then for only six weeks. In most situa-
 tions, a non-Communist bent plus effective control was enough ').0
 gain recognition."r
 A number of the military regimes that were accorded quick
 recognition because of -their anti-Communist beliefs did promise to
 hold free elections, apparently on their own initiative."= While the
 would be held and. that the treaties and agreements in effect between the United
 States and Albania on April 7,.1939, remained in effect. Assurances were given
 with respect: to democratic elections but problems developed over certain bi-
 lateral treaties; and the government of Albania refused to accede to the treaties
 until certain '=corrections" had been made. (Wteman, Digest of International
 Law, vol. 1, pp. 322-325.) These treaties were never "corrected" and to the
 present, the United States does not recognize the government of Albania.

 "1 On January 1, 1959, following years of revolutionary activity by Fidel Castro,
 President Batista fled Cuba. On the evening of January 1, Fidel Castro proclaimed

 1%1, President Eisenhower broke diplomatic and consular relations with the
 government of Cuba. Nonetheless, recognition of the Fidel Castro regime con-
 tinued. Ibid., pp. 268-270.
 "s For example, the United States granted recognition to a military junta six
 days after it overthrew the elected president of Honduras, Julio Lozano Diaz, on
 October 21, 1956. The United States accorded recognition because the junta was
 considered friendly to the United States and was anti-Communist, and in addition,
 had announced its willingness to fulfill Its international obligations, and restore
 constitutional rule through elections. Department of State, U.S. Policy toward
 Latin America, pp. 58-39.

 I
 United States was undoubtedly glad to receive such assurances (Haiti,
 1956; Honduras, 1956; Venezuela, 1958), there is no evidence that it
 demanded such promises as a condition to recognition.
 Indeed, on several occasions the Department of State
 refused to rely on a promise to return to constitutional gov-
 emment as a condition to the grant of recognition. For ex-
 ample, in the June, 1957 takeover by General Antono
 Kebreau in Haiti, the American ambassador requested that
 recognition be deferred until the intentions of the new
 regime toward elections became clear. The Department of
 State rejected this suggestion, arguing that conditioning the
 grant of recognition on the holding of elections constituted
 intervention in the domestic affairs of Haiti."
 Other Parts of the World. Eisenhower, like Roosevelt and Truman
 before him, did not confront many recognition decisions outside Latin
 America. The significant cases included Vietnam (1953), Tunisia
 (1957), Iraq (1958), Burma (1958), Pakistan (1958), Korea (1960),
 Laos (1960), Turkey (1960), and the continuing problem of the re-
 fusal to recognize the People's Republic of China.
 The July 14, 1958, coup in Iraq is representative of the Eisen-
 hower policy. Here the military overthrew the monarchy of Iraq and
 almost immediately announced that ii would honor all its international
 obligations, including those relating to petroleum. On July 30, Secre-
 tary of State Dulles recommended to President Eisenhower that the
 United States recognize the new government of Iraq.
 I believe that we should shortly recognize the new gov-
 ernment in Iraq. Although we deplore the brutality which
 characterized its seizure of power, the new regime has
 quickly restored order, is in full control of the country and
 apparently faces no organized opposition. The Foreign
 Minister and other officials have repeatedly said that Iraq
 wishes to continue close friendly relations as well as eco-
 nomic cooperation, particularly in oil matters, with the
 United States and other Western powers. These assertions
 have been accompanied by public assurances that the new
 government would fulfill Iraq's international treaty ob-
 ligations."
 a ibid., pp. 656.
 u Whiteman. Digest of International Law, vol. 2, pp. 450-451. The recommenda-
 tion continued: "fine question of recognition of the Iraqi Republic has been dis-
 cussed with representatives of the Muslim Baghdad act countries, Iran, Turkey
 and Pakistan, who have Indicated their understanding of the advisability of our
 recognizing the new Iraqi Government without undue delay so as to be In the
 best position to protect United States interests In Iraq and to exert constructive
 40
 United States recognition policy throughout the 1950s was dis-
 torted somewhat by the continued nonrecognition of the People's Re-
 public of China. While in the normal case the United States followed
 the de facto approach with anticommunism an additional criterion,
 State Department officials often defended the nonrecognition policy
 towards Communist China in sweeping, doctrinal terms, causing con-
 fusion and misstating general policy. For example, Secretary Dulles
 stated in an address in 1954:
 Let me first recall that diplomatic recognition is a volun-
 tary act. One country has no right to demand recognition
 by another. Generally, it is useful that there should be
 diplomatic intercourse between those who exercise de facto
 governmental 4uthority, and it is well established that recog-
 nition does not imply moral approval.
 President Monroe, in his famous message to Congress,
 denounced the expansionist and despotic system of Czarist
 Russia and its allies. But he said that it would nevertheless
 be our policy "to consider the government de facto as the
 legitimate government for us." This has indeed been the
 general United States policy, and I believe that it is a sound
 policy

 ere it does not serve our interests, we
 are free to vary from it.

 been consistently and viciously hostile to the United, States.""
 Summary
 U.S. recognition policy from the time of Jefferson until 1960 was com-'
 plex and changing. There was much confusion and disagreement over
 the proper role of recognition from one administration to another, and
 usually significant cnfusion and inconsistency within an administra-
 influence upon the new reg                                                                                              s expected that the Baghdad
 also will soon extend recognition. The Governments of Lebanon and Jordan nha
 similarly expressed to us in private their appreciation of the considerations
 which argue for early recognition by the United States. Other Arab states, such
 as Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, have already extended
 to consult with other friendly nations, such as the NATO powers, but your an-
 thority is now sought for the United States to extend formal diplomatic recogni-
 tion to the Republic of Iraq as soon as such action is

 tion. U.S. policy varied from a de facto policy of almost automatic
 recognition to the active use of recognition to achieve policy goals.
 The changing nature of recognition policy and the inconsistent
 application of the policy continued into the Kennedy administration,
 to which we now turn.
 2
 U.S. RECOGNITION POLICY
 UNDER JOHN F. KENNEDY,
 1961-1963
 President John F. Kennedy based his recognition policy toward Latin
 America on two deeply held views-his antipathy toward military dic-
 tatorships and his belief in the need for social, economic, and political
 progress through the Alliance for Progress. Kennedy's basic foreign
 policy, vividly reflected in his recognition policy toward Latin
 America, broke sharply with U.S. foreign policy under Eisenhower.
 In the 1950s the United States accepted.de facto military regimes ob-
 taining power through coup.d'etat, and gave them military, economic,
 and humanitarian assistance. If the new regime was friendly and
 anti-Communist, it could count on a warm United States response.
 One historian has observed that "the operative premise seemed to be
 that dictators offered-the surest defense against the threat of commu-
 nism."'
 Kennedy rejected the complacent acceptance of military regimes
 and strongly denounced militarism in Latin America. He believed
 that democratic, constitutional government was a precondition to the
 social and economic development Latin America so badly needed and
 therefore he premised his most ambitious Latin American programs
 on the development of strong, constitutional government.2 Conse-
 quently, the Kennedy administration viewed military coups d'etat in
 Latin America with considerable distaste and 'sought a return to
 constitutional government in as short a period as possible. As one
 writer commented:

 New York, 1964), p. 114.
