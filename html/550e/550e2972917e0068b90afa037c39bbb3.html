 Approved For RoIease 2007/03/07 : CIA-RDP79T009754
 Peking radio's casual acknowledgement on Thursday
 that Hua Kuo-feng had been elevated to chairman of the party
 central committee and of the military affairs commision,  and
 that the leftist quartet on the Politburo had been "struck
 down," still falls short of a formal announcement that the
 party central committee has confirmed Hua in his new posts.
 Thursday's broadcast moved closer to a full account of the
 charges against the leftists, but a detailed description of the
 machinations of the four has yet to be made public and official.
 I       INor has a new Politburo, to replace that elected at
 the  last party congress three years ago and now depleted by
 death and purges, been revealed. The elevation of Li Hsien-nien
 to the post of premier--generally assumed in Peking to be
 imminent--has not been announced, but Hua is now being identi-
 fied as chairman rather than premier.
 Many of these formal announcements may be made this
 morning during a television broadcast from Peking which is to
 be transmitted abroad.  In any event,  the new Chinese leadership
 appears anxious to underline the legality of its actions--in
 contrast to the moves earlier this year against Teng Hsiao-pLng,
 which many Chinese considered "illegal". Formal endorsement of
 the new shape of political affairs requires action by the central
 committee and other national bodies. A central committee plenum
 may still be in session;  large numbers of officials who were
 flown to Peking shortly after the arrest of the leftist quartet
 still appear to be in the capital.
 I  I If no formal announcement is made today or during a
 broa cast scheduled for -transmission abroad next Monday,  and
 both broadcasts merely recapitulate the large-scale demonstra-
 tions which have taken place in most Chinese cities this past
 week it would suggest that problems may have arisen in sorting
 out a new leadership and formalizing a new set of programs.
 There is as yet, however, no indication that this is the case.
 The events of the past two weeks have clearly been welcomed
 widely throughout China and the current leadership appears to
 be acting with great confidence.

 ~f problems exist,  they do not involve Hua's enhanced
 position or the arrest of the leftists. Even without the final,
 formal announcements, these actions seem irrevocable. Hua, more-
 over,                        appears to have the firm backing of the bulk of the mili-
 tary establishment--a fact which has been underlined both in
 the demonstrations of recent days and in Chinese propaganda
 since the arrests.
 A detailed but informal and unofficial account of the
 events surrounding the arrests obtained by the US liaison office,
 in fact, portrays Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying--a close
 associate of Chou En-lai and an outspoken critic of the fallen
 leftists--as the prime mover in the showdown and the man who
 convinced Hua to act. This account states that Hua decided to
 move after an attempt was made on his life on the morning of
 October 6 by an unnamed individual instigated by the leftist
 quartet. Hua is reported to have had the support of eight of
 the eleven powerful military region commanders.
 If this account is correct, however, it suggests that
 two and perhaps three military region commanders either remained
 passive or supported the left. One was probably Li Te-sheng,
 commander of the Shenyang Military Region  (Manchuria). The four
 provinces with which Li has been most closely associated were
 the provinces which have been most vociferous in promoting the
 campaign against Teng Hsiao-ping since last February.
 In any event, Li is almost certainly not the only
 military figure with leftist sympathies. Nearly all accounts of
 the turbulent month following Mao's death claim that the leftist
 quartet was counting on military support of some sort. Although
 their hopes were obviously largely misplaced,  a number of rela-
 tively senior officers in the provinces supported "radical"
 Red Guard groups during the Cultural Revolution, and at least
 some of these individuals have not been weeded out of active
 service in the intervening years.

 How to handle these men could be a delicate problem
 for the dominant leadership group in general and for the PLA
 leadership in particular. Neither Yeh Chien-ying, Su Yu,  a lead-
 ing member of the military affairs commission,  nor any of the
 regional military commanders has appeared since the leftists
 were arrested,  and it is possible that the PLA high command is
 now grappling with this and other immediate problems. One could
 be the appointment of a new chief of staff and a new head of
 the general political department; both jobs are currently un-
 filled.
 Other possible problem areas are the exact composition
 of a" reconstituted Politburo and the question of whether or not
 to close out the campaign against Teng Hsiao-ping quickly. The
 US liaison office account of the arrest of the leftists states
 that a preliminary investigation of the charges against Teng
 has revealed that many of the charges against him were trumped
 up by the discredited "black gang"  and that the riot in Tienanmen
 square last April was instigated by Wang Hung-wen, one of the
 leftist quartet. Hua Kuo-feng and some of those close to him
 may, however, prefer not to move too quickly in "reversing the
 verdict" on Teng, whose shoes Hua has in effect filled.
 There may also be some concern over how fast to move
 against individuals in Peking and the provinces who have long
 espoused leftist positions.  The account obtained by the US
 liaison office claims that some 500 people were arrested in the
 provinces on the night of October 6-7, but a handful of left-
 leaning province chiefs and other prominent officials are ap-
 parently still at large. No extensive arrests have apparently
 yet been made in the propaganda apparatus,  long a leftist strong-
 hold.
 The elimination of the leftist leaders has obviously
 left a major vacuum in Shanghai, China's  largest city, where
 three of the four members of the "black gang" held the top posts
 in the municipal party committee. The commander of the Shanghai
 garrison,   long an opponent of the leftists, is reported to have
 immediately disarmed the local urban militia,  a leftist organiza-
 tion.

 Wallposters and diplomatic accounts state that the
 Peki    authorities have subsequently dispatched the party boss
 of neighboring Kiangsu Province and two alternate members of
 the Politburo, Su Chen-hua and Ni Chih-fu,  to supervise the po-
 litical reorganization of the city.
 Still another Politburo member, Wang Tung-hsing,
 initially rumored to have fallen with the leftist quartet,
 appears not to be in political trouble. Wang had been suspected
 by many Chinese, as well as foreign observers, of leftist sym-
 pathies, but at the crucial moment he seems to have cast his lot
 with Hua Kuo-feng. Security forces in Peking, which are under
 his control, were warmly lauded during last Thursday's demon-
 stration in the capital.                                                          25X1
 //Most of Rhodesia's whites, including members of

 that since the blacks are not known to have any programs for

 limited to the top ministry posts while middle- and lower-level

 LEBANON:  Situation Report

 Relative calm prevailed throughout Lebanon on the
 second day of the cease-fire. yesterday.
 I     I  There was some military action in southern Lebanon
 near the Israeli border, where Christian forces supported by
 Israeli artillery fire have been moving on Palestinian posi-
 tions for the last several days. Although fighting there ap-
 parently tapered off yesterday,  there was some shelling of
 Bint Jubayl and other villages in the vicinity.

 Palestinian and leftist forces,  charging that the
 Israelis conducted the artillery attacks on Bint Jubayl, have
 vowed to continue resisting Israeli and Christian incursions
 in the area. The joint Palestinian-leftist command met Thurs-
 day night to discuss the Riyadh summit resolutions and issued
 a statement declaring that it will not adhere to the cease-
 fire where Israeli forces are involved.
 The leftist command under Kamal Jumblatt reinforced
 the threat with a unilateral declaration last night of its
 intention to launch a "large scale armed struggle against the
 Israeli incursions" if the Arab summit conference scheduled
 to convene on Monday does not handle the issue.
 Arab League security forces concentrated their at-
 tention yesterday on reestablishing checkpoints to supervise
 the cease-fire along the line dividing east and west Beirut.
 Five checkpoints were established yesterday,  and a security
 force spokesman discussed with Lebanese and Palestinian leaders
 arrangements for additional checkpoints and a buffer zone as
 interim measures before the arrival of the expanded 30,000-man
 force to be constituted at the Arab summit meeting.
 At the summit, Arab League secretary general Riyad
 will as      all Arab states to indicate whether and in what num-
 bers they wish to contribute to the expanded force. The final
 selection of additional contingents will then be left to Leba-
 nese President Sarkis, who is to have overall control of the
 peacekeeping troops.
 Saudi Arabia is expected to augment its con-
 tingent, and of er troop contributions are anticipated from
 Sudan, Tunisia,        Morocco,  and possibly Kuwait.

 Despite general adherence to the cease-fire

 IRAQ:   Reaction to Riyadh Accord
 Iraq's statement on Thursday denouncing the agreement
 reached in Riyadh this week by Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
 Kuwait, Lebanon,  and the Palestine Liberation Organization re-
 flects the Iraqis'  sense of betrayal by Egypt. Until recently,
 Cairo had been collaborating with Iraq's effort to strengthen
 Palestinian and Lebanese leftist forces arrayed against the
 Syrians.
 Iraqi strongman Saddam Husayn probably believed that
 President Sadat shared his objective of complicating Syria's
 involvement in Lebanon in the hope of encouraging moves within
 Syria to topple President Asad.  Saddam probably now sees Sadat's
 willingness to go along with the Riyadh agreement as a reversal
 by Egypt, one that opens the way for Syria to extricate itself
 from the problems brought on by its role in Lebanon.
 //Despite their opposition to the agreement, the
 Iraqis may begin to reduce their own involvement in Lebanon
 if they believe that Lebanese leftists and the Palestinians
 intend to observe the truce.  Forces controlled by Baghdad in
 Lebanon are not strong enough to provoke a renewal of full-scale
 fighting,  although they could spark incidents.
 Approved For Ro

 Having apparently parted ways with Egypt on policy
 toward Lebanon, Iraq may now be seeking a common approach with
 Libya. The Libyans have announced they will not attend the
 Arab summit conference scheduled to open in Cairo on October
 25 and are probably urging Baghdad to boycott the conference,
 too.
 25X1
 The Iraqi strongman is probably concerned that
 internal rivals may try to exploit Iraq's lack of political
 return for its investment of money and prestige in Lebanon.
 Not only does Syrian President Asad,  the archrival of the
 Iraqi Baathists, seem to have weathered domestic criticism of
 Syria's intervention in Lebanon, but the Riyadh agreement is
 also an implicit legitimization of Damascus'  role by conser-
 vative and moderate Arabs.
 II PLO chairman Yasir Arafat, during his visit to
 Baghdad this week, probably pressed the Iraqis to attend the
 summit in spite of their misgivings. Arafat will need all the
 help he can line up to support Palestinian views on peacekeeping
 arrangements and the safeguarding of Palestinian interests in
 Lebanon. Syria and most of the other Arab states would cer-
 tainly veto any Iraqi offer to participate in peacekeeping

 MALAYSIA:     Oil Negotiations
 II Malaysia's national oil company, Petronas, may reach
 a production-sharing agreement with the major oil companies
 before the end of the year. Prime Minister Hussein told Shell
 and Exxon executives in July that their companies must conclude
 a contract by mid-November or face nationalization.
 The major issue separating the two sides concerns
 provisions for the rate of return and investment recovery in a
 new agreement. Petronas'  proposals were based on similar company-
 government agreements elsewhere in the world, but the companies
 believe these overlook the high risk and difficulty of extract-
 ing Malaysian offshore oil.
 //In late September, the controversial and
 highly nationalistic Petronas chief, Tengku Razaleigh resigned
 to devote full time to his Finance Ministry portfolio. He was
 replaced by the former secretary of the government, Tan Sri
 Kadir, who is more sympathetic to Hussein's desire to accommodate
 foreign investors and to conclude an agreement with the oil
 companies.//

 Malaysia is seriously concerned that failure to reach
 a satisfactory agreement could scare off foreign investment in
 non-oil sectors. The ambitious development plan for 1976 to
 1980 calls for continued  ig h dependence on foreign investment
 in the private sector.                                                            25X1
 USSR:  Nuclear Power Program
 //The Soviet nuclear power program continues
 to fall behind schedule despite the emphasis it has received in
 successive economic development plans. The USSR is  looking to
 the West for technology and equipment to solve the problem.//
 //Even if the Soviets acquire the Western
 technology and equipment they want, it will not help them meet
 the goals of the tenth Five-Year Plan, ending in 1980. Failure
 to meet current goals could possibly cause some localized elec-
 tric power shortages in the European part of the USSR.//
 //The USSR now has a nuclear-electric gen-
 erating capacity of 6,146 megawatts. The tenth Five-Year Plan

 program, which had an installed capacity of more than 38,000
 megawatts by the end of 1975.//
 //The Soviet nuclear program has never
 achieved the established goals of previous Five-Year Plans.
 There have been numerous delays caused by poor construction and
 management techniques,  late delivery of important components,

 Acquisition of Western nuclear component manufacturing equipment
 and technology thus would not help meet goals of the tenth Five-
 Year Plan. It would, however, put the Soviets on a solid indus-
 trial footing to meet the goals for nuclear power plant con-
 struction in the eleventh and twelfth Five-Year Plans.//
 //In the meantime, the USSR has been attempt-
 ing to purchase foreign reactor components or even complete
 nuclear power stations to make some Pro ress toward meeting the
 goals of the nuclear power program.
 foreign purchase of major components for a 1,000-megawatt
 nuclear power plant would cost about $300-$400 million per
 plant.//
 //Purchases of Western reactors and components
 would not help attain the goals of the tenth Five-Year Plan be-
 cause of relatively long construction times. Such purchases,
 however, would significantly reduce the strain on the Soviet
 nuclear reactor component industry during its expansion period.//
 //The Soviets evidently are willing to spend
 a considerable amount of foreign exchange to increase their
 nuclear power capacity. Their shopping list is large and the
 program has high-level backing. It will require a great deal of
 time, however,  for the Soviets to build up their machine build-
 I in  industry to the levels reaui rfd     current plans.

 The Italian government last night imposed a tax on
 purchases of foreign currency for the second time this month in
 order to strengthen the lira.
 The government decision to impose a 7-percent tax on
 foreign currency purchases comes one week after the expiration
 of a similar tax of 10 percent. The previous tax essentially
 dried up the Italian exchange markets and left the central bank
 the only lira seller in the market. When the previous tax was
 lifted on Monday, the lira plunged from 844 to 870 to the dol-
 lar. So far this week it has been kept at this level by heavy
 intervention by the Bank of Italy and a program of exchange
 controls.
 In contrast to the earlier surcharge, which served
 only as a temporary expedient to shore up the lira, the latest
 tax would reportedly remain in effect up to four months and
 should have the same impact on import costs as a currency de-
 valuation.
 In response to the Italian government's action., the
 Monetary Committee of the EC Commission held an emergency meet-
 ing and later issued a statement critical of the Italian move.
 It urged Rome to take immediate austerity measures to stabliize
 the Italian economy and to restore confidence in the lira. The
 Committee intends to meet ac lain early next week to discuss the
 matter more fully.
 //Political tensions are rising in Portugal,
 fueled by rumors of government changes, squabbling within the
 military,  and divisions in the governing Socialist Party. A key
 figure in many of the rumors is President Eanes, who apparently
 has begun to consider taking a greater role in the government.//

 1//Eanes seems to be worried about the cur-
 rent situation on many counts:
 --He has made no secret of his disillusionment with the
 minority government of Prime Minister Soares. He believes
 Soares is not doing enough to tackle Portugal's serious
 economic problems and has not responded sufficiently to
 his behind-the-scenes prodding.
 --He reportedly fears an attempt on his life may be made by
 leftists, who would try to pin the blame on the right.
 --He may be concerned that rightists in the military are
 bidding effectively for greater influence.
 --He may also fear that recent protests by conscript of-
 ficers over pay and promotions are weakening the armed
 forces.//
 I                   //Eanes has apparently not yet settled on a
 course of action, however. He clearly does not want to be more
 closely identified with the Soares government,

 //If Eanes decides to intervene in the po-
 litical process soon, he probably will try another civilian
 government before resorting to military rule. He has spoken
 favorably of a coalition government with majority support in the
 legislature,  and he may eventually try to force the Socialists
 to ally with one or both of the parties to their right.//
 II Snares still needs the support of the left, however,
 especially in the labor movement, and the Marxist faction is too
 small either to challenge his  leadership or to have any future
 as a splinter party. He may use the Socialist congress to chas-
 tise the left and perhaps even remove its leaders from cabinet
 posts, but he will probably hesitate to force it out of the
 government altogether.                                                              25X1
 //Left-wing British Labor Party leader Michael Foot,
 with the support of many moderate Laborites, won a comfortable
 victory this week over Education Secretary Shirley Williams in
 the race for the party's deputy leadership.//
 //The contest had threatened to aggravate left-
 right tensions within the party, but the passive campaign of
 both candidates helped avoid divisive bickering. Prime Minister
 Callaghan did his part to minimize damage to party unity by re-
 maining officially neutral. Callaghan clearly favored Foot even
 though he is more ideologically attuned to Williams. Foot has
 been a loyal cabinet minister and a key figure in maintaining
 harmony between the government and its union supporters.//
 //Williams, however, has not lost out completely.
 Her substantial vote in Thursday's party election gives her the
 strongest claim to inherit Roy Jenkins'  role as titular head of
 Labor's right wing. Jenkins will soon resign from Parliament
 and in January become president of the EC Commission.
