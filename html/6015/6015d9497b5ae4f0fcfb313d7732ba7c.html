 Synopsis
 1               Perspective-South America's War on Inflation
 The civilian governments of Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Bolivia-perceiving that
 unabated price spirals in the three-to-five-digit range could be their downfall-
 have moved boldly to slash inflation in the past year. In our judgment, however,
 these gains will prove temporary unless greater attention is directed to eliminating
 the root causes of inflation and labor demands for wage increases are held in check
 in 1987.
 3            Argentina: Austral Plan Running Out of Steam
 Argentina's year-old economic austerity program, the Austral Plan, has reined in
 chronic inflation and budget deficits, but President Alfonsin has largely failed to
 exploit this success to reduce the size and role of government in the economy and
 create a more favorable climate for private invesrtment. We expect the economic
 gains from the program to dissipate over time and that Argentina's persistent
 payments problems and strained relations with international creditors will re-
 emerge.
 7            Brazil: Uneven Progress Under the Cruzado Plan
 Brazil's five-month-old Cruzado Plan so far has checked the growth of inflation.
 While economic growth does not appear to have been hurt, the plan-because of
 growing skepticism about the government's willingness to curb its spending-has
 not dampened consumer spending, encouraged savings, or spurred investment, a
 sign that Brasilia has not yet succeeded in breaking inflationary expectations.
 The oil market during the next six months will be characterized by substantial
 price volatility. We believe that oil prices will average between $10 and $15 per
 barrel, but we do not expect a smooth pattern.
 15          Kuwait-USSR: Expanding Economic Ties
 Kuwait and the USSR have concluded an agreement that will strengthen bilateral
 ties and provide Moscow loans and access to state-of-the-art Western oil technol-
 ogy. If these projects are successful, Moscow probably will increase its use of
 commercial arrangements for political as well as economic gains with other
 Persian Gulf countries.

 19          LDC Banking Systems: Impact of Liberalization
 The banking systems of some key LDCs are undergoing major changes as a result
 of debt-related reform programs and past bad management policies. LDC
 governments' efforts to liberalize their banking systems could complicate relations
 with international creditors if further bank failures are the result.

 creases are held in check in 1987.
 The civilian governments of Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Bolivia-perceiving that
 unabated price spirals in the three-to-five digit range could be their downfall-
 have moved boldly to slash inflation in the past year. In the face of growing
 nationalistic sentiment and impatience with externally prescribed austerity, each
 developed "stabilization formulas" independent of the IMF, although Argentina
 and Bolivia subsequently concluded loan agreements with the Fund. These self-
 designed programs are slowing South American inflation dramatically from a
 1985 average of 280 percent to a projected 50 to 60 percent this year. In our judg-
 ment, however, these gains will prove temporary unless greater attention is
 directed to eliminating the root causes of inflation and labor demands for wage in-
 money creation.
 The centerpieces of the stabilization strategies adopted by Argentina, Peru, and
 Brazil have been comprehensive and, ostensibly, temporary price and wage freezes.
 Argentina and Brazil supplemented these controls with some significant reforms,
 including issuance of new currencies and an end to indexation practices that
 perpetuated past inflation. Deindexation and the price and wage freezes were
 expected to break the psychological back of spiralling inflation, restore savings and
 investment incentives, and give governments time to address structural imbalances
 in their economies. For these three countries, stronger fiscal and monetary
 discipline has played a secondary role in their strategies. Only in the case of
 Bolivia did the government's anti-inflation package closely resemble conventional
 IMF prescriptions. La Paz has made large reductions in government spending,
 substantially reduced the public-sector deficit as a percent of GNP, and stopped
 administrations of Presidents Alfonsin, Garcia, and Sarney.
 All four programs have throttled inflation effectively, but the consequences have
 differed. In Bolivia, real wages and social programs have borne the brunt of the
 stabilization efforts although the Paz Estenssoro administration has not come
 under any immediate threat so far. In contrast, the price freezes in Argentina,
 Peru, and Brazil have come to represent a form of "tax" on the countries' private-
 sector producers but led immediately to sharp cuts in monthly inflation rates,
 widespread popular support for the programs, and immense political gains for the

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/12/12 : CIA-RDP88-00798R000400090005-6
 We believe the prospect for long-term success is clouded for all four stabilization
 programs, despite their differences. Bolivia-already impoverished-cannot sus-
 tain continued draconian measures without substantially increased foreign finan-
 cial assistance. Moreover, the government will be hard pressed to withstand
 intense pressure from labor for large wage increases, traditionally a major
 determinant of inflation in Bolivia. In the other countries, the selective gains of the
 price freezes in the early months-not the least of which have been political-may
 obstruct the longer term economic prospects for success. In our judgment,
 Argentina and Peru are backing away from earlier plans to slash bloated public-
 sector spending and are maintaining the major parts of their freezes longer than
 initially indicated. The Brazilian Government, bent on getting its favored candi-
 dates elected to Congress in November, may be headed down the same path.
 Excessive reliance on price freezes, we believe, will have self-defeating effects.
 Instead of providing incentives to save and invest, the controls-if maintained-
 will fuel ongoing consumer spending booms while prompting private investors to
 delay plant expansion until further government intentions become clearer. As a
 result, product shortages are likely to grow, black markets may develop, and
 inflationary pressures will mount. Already, in Argentina, Peru, and Brazil
 inflation rates are inching up as businesses    ways to circumvent government ef-
 forts to enforce price controls.
 Before prices can be fully decontrolled, the governments of Argentina, Peru, and
 Brazil need to begin important structural adjustments such as slashing government
 subsidies, privatizing more state-owned corporations, and cutting government
 payrolls. The danger is that the government leaders in these three countries will
 continue to shirk tougher reforms and squander their opportunities to create the
 conditions for low inflation and high growth in the future. President Sarney's
 announcement this week of new measures to reinforce Brazil's fight against
 inflation falls short of redressing structural imbalances but does hold out some
 hope that Brasilia may be willing to take increasingly tough steps to ensure the
 program's longer term success. As for Bolivia, its government probably will be
 unable to withstand political opposition and pressure from labor for large wage
 hikes unless additional foreign financial assistance becomes available to lessen the
 social sacrifices required to make needed adjustments.

 Argentina: Austral Plan
 Running Out of Steam
 Argentina's year-old economic austerity program, the
 Austral Plan, has reined in chronic inflation and
 budget deficits, but President Alfonsin has largely
 failed to exploit this success to reduce the size and
 role of government in the economy and create a more
 favorable climate for private investment. Although
 Alfonsin may tinker further with economic policy, we
 doubt he will carry out the radical restructuring
 needed to generate long-term growth. We therefore
 expect the economic gains from the program to
 dissipate over time, and that Argentina's persistent
 payments problems and strained relations with inter-
 national creditors will reemerge.
 The Austral Plan worked quickly to stabilize the
 economy. Its freeze of wages and prices, introduction
 of a new currency, and end to printing-press financing
 slashed monthly increases in the consumer price index
 from more than 25 percent during the first half of
 1985 to 3 percent during the second half of the year.
 The government deficit as a share of GDP shrank,
 and real wages leveled off from their free-fall. Alfon-
 sin's popularity as measured by public opinion polls
 soared.
 The economic program, which stole the public spot-
 light from labor unions and opposition parties de-
 manding a moratorium on foreign debt payments, was
 also popular with the international financial commu-
 nity. The plan paved the way for a revised $1.4 billion
 standby agreement with the IMF and $4.2 billion in
 new lending from commercial banks. Buenos Aires
 liquidated its interest arrearages-many of which had
 been pending since 1982-and increased reserves by
 $1.9 billion, according to US Embassy reporting.
 In addition, the program set the stage for short-term
 industrial improvement. Euphoria over price stability,
 combined with uncertainty over how long it would
 last, increased demand for consumer durables. Manu-
 facturing, steel production, and electricity consump-
 tion all rose significantly during the first quarter of
 1986 over year-earlier levels, according to press re-
 ports. Help wanted ads indicate that demand for labor
 has risen sharply over the past year.
 Disappointing Followthrough
 Despite its initial promise, the Austral Plan has
 turned out to be largely an emergency measure to
 overcome hyperinflation and maintain political stabil-
 ity, rather than a well-conceived project to reform
 Argentina's economy. We believe that Alfonsin frit-
 tered away his political honeymoon following the
 plan's implementation, missing what the US Embassy
 has dubbed "an historic opportunity" to introduce
 structural reforms that could have spurred private
 investment and reduced Argentina's bloated public
 sector. The policy supplements that Buenos Aires has
 added to the Austral Plan in the last six months
 confirm our view that Alfonsin is resigned to making
 only incremental changes that will not reduce signifi-
 cantly the government's role in the economy.
 Alfonsin's recent initiative to privatize six large state-
 owned enterprises-a badly needed move in a country
 where the government controls over 350 companies
 and state activity accounts for one-half the GDP-is
 only a drop in the bucket. Moreover, few Argentine
 firms have sufficient capital to acquire these compa-
 nies, and stiff nationalistic resistance is likely to
 hamper foreign purchasers. At the same time, Alfon-
 sin announced a list of companies he would not
 privatize that includes the largest money losers. He
 has also created a ministry to oversee state enterprise
 activities and announced a hiring freeze in a bid to
 stem their losses. We doubt, however, that the Presi-
 dent will be much more successful than his predeces-
 sors at increasing efficiency of the public concerns.

 He has already pledged to avoid the massive layoffs
 needed before profitability could be restored.
 In the area of banking reform, Argentina lowered
 100-percent reserve requirements and allowed banks
 to introduce a free-market interest rate. It then
 partially negated the effect by requiring banks to
 deposit the money freed by this measure in blocked
 accounts and to purchase Central Bank bonds yield-
 ing government-regulated rates of return with money
 deposited in "free" accounts. There was little attempt
 to improve the efficiency of the overstaffed and costly
 financial system, and credit remains expensive and
 scarce.
 This spring Alfonsin replaced the wage and price
 freeze in force since June 1985 with an administered
 price system. The new scheme, however, is scarcely
 more market oriented than the freeze: it clamps
 maximum prices on 50 essential products and requires
 case-by-case approval of price hikes on other goods
 produced by medium- and large-sized firms. This
 system is already bogging down-a strike in the
 Commerce Ministry forced the government to set the
 most recent changes unilaterally.
 Buenos Aires has, for the time being, closed the gap
 between official and parallel market exchange rates,
 which will help make exports more competitive.
 Moreover, it obtained World Bank financing for a
 scheme to replace export taxes with a production-
 enhancing tax on land. We believe, however, that a
 new plan to promote industrial exports could backfire
 as it widens the bureaucracy's discretion in awarding
 incentives and complicates the regulatory maze al-
 ready confronting exporters.
 refunded after five years-funnels surplus capital to
 the government and discourages foreign investors
 from making new commitments. Tight money policies
 have helped stem the flow of capital abroad, but the
 government has had little success inspiring Argentines
 to repatriate their capital.
 In addition, Alfonsin is losing room to maneuver
 politically. Recent public opinion polls show that his
 popular support, while still high, is beginning to erode.
 Nationwide strikes-a 24-hour work stoppage last
 month was honored by 70 to 80 percent of the
 population in Buenos Aires, according to US Embassy
 reporting-underscore labor's impatience to regain
 real wages lost before the program was implemented.
 Farmers, too, are becoming increasingly vocal; they
 recently struck for 48 hours to demand relief from low
 commodity prices and high export taxes.
 Meanwhile, Argentina's international position re-
 mains precarious. Flooding in agricultural areas last
 fall contributed to a 20-percent drop in exports during
 the first three months of this year, the Embassy
 reports. Despite last year's sizable debt rescheduling
 and the $875 million the IMF and commercial banks
 disbursed last month, Buenos Aires is not meeting all
 of its current commitments. Argentina continues to
 unilaterally withhold payments on Paris Club debt
 due this year, and makes only sporadic payment on
 the rescheduled bilateral debt, according to a US
 government official.
 Alfonsin may further refine the Austral Plan over the
 next year, but we judge that he is unlikely to an-
 nounce an "Austral Plan II" centered around far-
 reaching fiscal and structural reforms. The President
 and his economic team believe their gradualist ap-

 The bloom of Alfonsin's initial success is already
 starting to fade. GDP growth during the first quarter
 was an unimpressive 0.4 percent. Inflation has begun
 to inch up over the past four months, and this year's
 fiscal deficit will probably equal 6 percent of GDP-
 double the government's initial projection. Investment
 continues to stagnate as a forced savings plan-

 Over the long run, however, the outlook is somewhat
 more hopeful. Alfonsin's turn toward free-market
 solutions such as privatization, wage increases based
 on productivity gains, and the promotion of foreign
 investment-all previously associated with the dis-
 credited military regime-is, in our view, helping to
 change the rhetoric of Argentine economic policy
 making for the better. Alfonsin has laid some of the
 groundwork that may enable a more secure civilian
 government to take bolder actions at a later date. The
 President's proposal to move the capital to Viedma-
 in the underdeveloped southern portion of the coun-
 try-could be a politically acceptable way to cut the
 size of the government, as thousands of employees are
 expected to quit rather than move from Buenos Aires.
 Declining interest rates and a favorable reserve posi-
 tion have diminished short-term pressure on the debt
 front, although problems are likely to resurface next
 year.
 We believe Buenos Aires
 will eventually conclude a new IMF standby agree-
 ment, but will continue its pattern of falling in and out
 of compliance during the coming year.

 Brazil: Uneven Progress Under
 the Cruzado Plan
 Brazil's five-month-old Cruzado Plan so far has
 checked the growth of inflation. While economic
 growth does not appear to have been hurt, the plan-
 because of growing skepticism about the government's
 willingness to curb its spending-has not dampened
 consumer spending, encouraged savings, or spurred
 investment, a sign that Brasilia has not yet succeeded
 in breaking inflationary expectations. Because the
 plan is still very popular with the general public,
 Brasilia appears reluctant to make major adjustments
 to the program before the important November do-
 mestic elections. Although President Sarney an-
 nounced new measures this week, they were little
 more than fine-tuning adjustments. Even so, if rosy
 economic forecasts for the remainder of this year hold
 up, Sarney will enter the November elections in
 strong shape. In order to prevent the unraveling of his
 Cruzado Plan next year, however, we believe the
 President will need to ease the controls soon after the
 elections and, at the same time, exercise tighter
 budget and monetary restraint.
 The Cruzado Plan has brought the Sarney adminis-
 tration good economic news. Deindexation-the elim-
 ination of automatic price adjustments to compensate
 for past inflation-and the comprehensive price freeze
 have for the time being broken the inflationary spiral.
 Since February, monthly consumer price increases
 have averaged less than 1 percent, a drastic reduction
 from the nearly 15-percent average in the months
 leading up to the plan. With lower prices and higher
 wages, consumer spending remains strong, at least
 temporarily removing the fear that the stabilization
 package will lead to a recession. The deceleration of
 inflation, according to an Embassy report, has also
 caused a sharp decline in interest rates, although
 nominal rates are still significantly above measured
 inflation, especially for consumer credit.
 Indexation offindncial assets was eliminated, except
 for passbook savings accounts that will be corrected
 for inflation on a quarterly basis.
 All prices were frozen for an indefinite period.
 A new currency, the cruzado, replaced the cruzeiro.
 One cruzado equals 1,000 cruzeiros.
 The dollar/cruzado exchange rate was fixed at
 13.84 cruzados per dollar for an indefinite period.
 25X1
 25X1
 Wages were increased 8 percent above their average
 value during October 1985-February 1986. The mini- 25X1
 mum wage was boosted one-third to 804 cruzados
 ($58) per month.
 Wages will remain frozen for a year or until cumula-
 tive inflation reaches 20 percent. Future cost-of-living
 adjustments will guarantee only 60 percent of past
 price increases, with the other 40 percent negotiable.
 Rents and mortgage payments were frozen for a year.
 A limited form of unemployment insurance was set
 up. Eligible workers will draw up to 1,206 cruzados
 per month ($87) for up to four months.
 President Sarney has reaped
 substantial political benefit from his bold economic
 move. USIA polls indicate that his public approval
 rating-which stood at 35 percent before announce-
 ment of the plan-has reached an unprecedented 90

 lieve they have benefited from the plan; the price
 freeze has been hailed by middle-class consumers, and
 wage earners have benefited from the 8-percent boost
 in real wages. Moreover, press reports indicate that
 the wage freeze is supported by most businessmen,
 although the hurried imposition of price controls has
 drawn their ire.
 The program has also set in motion some market-
 oriented reforms necessary to strengthen Brazil's
 economy. The US Embassy reports the domestic
 banking system was quick to recognize that deindexa-
 tion would mean the end of huge profits from invest-
 ing in indexed securities. Banks are streamlining their
 operations through layoffs and branch closures, and
 the government has enacted legislation to allow them
 to charge fees for various services. Moreover, stock
 prices surged as Sao Paulo's market index rose nearly
 85 percent during March and April. Government
 officials are publicly expressing confidence that the
 stock market will become a source of equity capital
 for Brazil's heavily indebted private sector.
 investment in additional capacity.
 We believe that the decision to proceed with the
 Cruzado Plan was predicated on Brasilia's conviction
 that inflationary expectations had become so in-
 grained as to constitute a major impediment to contin-
 ued high levels of growth and that shock treatment
 was necessary. Stable prices were expected to stop
 consumers from hedge buying and increase incentives
 to save. The architects of the plan also hoped that the
 drastic reduction in inflation would spur badly needed
 sharply declined from March through May.
 To date, however, neither consumers nor businessmen
 have reacted to the plan as expected. The US Embas-
 sy reports that consumers went on a spending spree,
 with retail sales increasing more than 40 percent
 during the first three months of the plan. Much of the
 spending, however, was fueled by drawdowns of sav-
 ing accounts. Consequently, passbook savings-a key
 financial instrument for capital formation in Brazil-
 Meanwhile, new business investment continues to be
 sluggish while overall capacity utilization is about
 80 percent, according to the US Consulate in Sao
 Paulo. Various investor surveys report most business-
 men are still inhibited from sinking money into plant
 expansion because profits have been cut by the price
 freeze and because of uncertainty about future remov-
 al of price controls. Instead of investing in additional
 capacity,                  businessmen are di-
 verting production into more lucrative export markets.
 In addition, a, recent wave of wildcat strikes in Sao
 Paulo's important industrial park indicates that labor
 support for the Cruzado Plan is faltering. Nearly
 50,000 workers in more than 40 businesses are now on
 the picket lines demanding higher wages, according to
 the US Consulate in Sao Paulo.
 This behavior on the part of consumers, businessmen,
 and labor indicates to us that the Cruzado Plan has
 done little to dampen the psychology of inflation.

 black markets and hoarding.
 Indeed, reporting in Brazil's financial press indicates
 that investment in real estate and demand for dollars
 on the unofficial market-both traditional barometers
 of inflationary expectations-have increased rather
 than declined since 1 March. Moreover, the combina-
 tion of rising demand and capacity constraints is
 causing the economy to begin to overheat, as evi-
 denced by recent spot shortages of a wide range of
 goods. Although the government is encouraging im-
 ports to fill supply gaps, we believe the persistence of
 shortages could introduce serious distortions, such as
 A significant part of the problem, in our view, is that
 Brasilia has not followed through on its pledges to
 curb its own spending habits. Soon after implement-
 ing the package, government officials contended that
 the real public-sector deficit would drop to only 0.5
 percent of GDP this year, from last year's 3.2 percent,
 on the strength of increased taxes legislated last
 December. In contrast, large deficits registered dur-
 ing the first two months of the plan have led officials
 to admit that this year's deficit is likely to match last
 year's. According to the press, the government has
 introduced a subsidy to ensure ample supplies of milk
 and has granted tax breaks to some industries hit hard
 by the freeze-measures that enlarge the deficit.
 The government's monetary management is more
 difficult to gauge. Despite reforms earlier in the year
 designed to break the rapid rise in the money supply,
 official statistics indicate that the monetary base has
 increased by more than 90 percent since March. The
 government argues that this has not been inflationary
 because velocity has dropped dramatically; this is
 probably true, as consumers are now more willing to
 hold currency, but no data are available to confirm
 this. The US Embassy suggests that rapid expansion
 of the monetary base is slowing, as the economy
 adjusts to lower prices.
 These signs of trouble have not been lost on Brazilian
 economists such as former Planning Minister Delfim
 Netto and former Finance Minister Henrique Simon-
 sen, who are expressing doubts in the press about the
 viability of the program. Although they agree that
 deindexation is an important first step, they argue
 that the price freeze is not sustainable over a long
 period. Moreover, these economists contend that the
 public deficit will need to be controlled in order to
 prevent inflationary pressures from resurging. In Ad-
 dition, many experts are questioning the wisdom of
 the fixed exchange rate and are urging the govern-
 ment to return to a policy of minidevaluations. Others
 advise more import liberalization and reform of the
 domestic capital market.
 Brasilia has been making economic adjustments in an
 effort to keep the program from faltering. In an
 attempt to prevent overheating, the administration
 recently tightened consumer credit terms. The Na-
 tional Monetary Council enacted measures to make
 savings accounts more attractive, and, in June, depos-
 its exceeded withdrawals for the first time since
 February. Measures to cool stock market speculation
 were implemented in late April, but new issues and
 prices in May and June were still higher than before
 deindexation. The government is considering legisla-
 tion that would limit use of the parallel market in
 foreign exchange, according to the US Embassy. To
 enhance monetary control, Brasilia also has limited
 lending by state-owned banks.
 While such measures are important, the government
 recognized they would not be enough, and, according-
 ly, unveiled new measures this week to shore up the
 Cruzado Plan. According to press reports, Brasilia
 took actions designed to dampen demand, encourage
 savings, and stimulate investment. These include:
 ? Excise taxes ranging from 25 to 30 percent on
 automobiles, fuel, foreign travel, and on the pur-
 chase of dollars.
 25X1

 ? Creation of a fund to stimulate investment to be     25X1

 ing economy and may help to promote some invest-
 ment. However, President Sarney continues to avoid

 making major adjustments to the plan-a course he is
 likely to continue through the gubernatorial and
 congressional elections set for November. He will
 probably be particularly loath to ease the price freeze
 because of its immense popularity, according to the
 US Embassy. Likewise, deep spending reductions
 would be politically difficult in an election year.
 Consequently, we believe the government probably
 will continue to respond with fine-tuning adjustments.
 These relatively minor adjustments should be suffi-
 cient, in our view, to drop inflation from the 235-
 percent level recorded in 1985 to about 70 percent this
 year. We further anticipate that strong consumer
 demand will lead to an economic growth rate of 5
 percent this year and will forestall major discontent
 with the program through the end of this year.
 Against this backdrop, we believe that moderates will
 make gains in the congressional elections and leftists
 will be kept in check.
 At the same time, however, we believe Sarney will
 have to move fairly soon after the elections to address
 fundamental problems that, if not dealt with, could
 lead to the ultimate unravelling of the Cruzado Plan.
 To prevent shortages and to stimulate investment, we
 believe Sarney will need to ease price controls quickly.
 In addition, he will have to implement tighter fiscal
 and monetary policies to prevent a resurgence of
 inflation as the controls are loosened. The key indica-
 tors of Sarney's resolve to tackle these problems will
 be his willingness to implement measures to reduce
 government subsidies, privatize state-owned enter-
 prises, cut government payrolls, and avoid financing
 the public deficit by increasing the money supply.

 Near-Term Oil Price Outlook
 The oil market during the next six months will be
 characterized by substantial price volatility. The in-
 teraction of several variables-seasonal swings in oil
 demand, inventory behavior, producer intentions, and
 market psychology-will determine the extent of
 price fluctuations. We believe that oil prices will
 average between $10 and $15 per barrel, but we do
 not expect a smooth pattern. Indeed, prices could
 plunge well below $10 per barrel followed by quick
 turnarounds. Under no circumstances do we antici-
 pate that prices will rise above $15 per barrel unless
 the Saudis decide to drastically change course. At this
 time there are no signs that Saudi Arabia is prepared
 to pare production.
 OPEC production in June-including natural gas
 liquids-averaged nearly 20 million b/d, some 3
 million b/d above average 1985 levels. Nearly all the
 gain reflects increased Saudi output, which is now
 hovering around 6 million b/d. The only offset to
 Saudi gains has been a 500,000 b/d to 1 million b/d
 decline in non-OPEC output due in large part to
 marketing problems. On the consumption side, we
 estimate non-Communist oil usage during first half
 1986 was about 500,000 b/d above last year's levels,
 less than some oil companies had expected. Delays in
 passing on lower crude costs combined with sluggish
 economic growth is for the most part responsible for
 the modest rebound in oil use.
 OPEC has met four times so far this year to try to
 resolve its differences over the production-sharing
 issue. In the wake of OPEC's latest stalemate last
 month, spot prices have fallen sharply and are hover-
 ing near $10 per barrel-the lowest level in 13 years.
 We estimate the world average oil price was $12 per
 barrel last week, compared with $27 per barrel last
 year. Spot prices have become extremely volatile-
 often fluctuating by as much as $5 within a few
 weeks.
 Key determinants of price behavior over the next six
 months will be consumption patterns, inventory be-
 havior, non-Saudi supplies, and Saudi oil production
 policy.
 Consumption. The consensus view among forecasters
 looks for non-Communist oil consumption to increase
 at an annual rate of about 2 to 3 percent during the
 last half of the year. Almost all of the increase in
 demand will come from OECD countries, principally
 the United States. This assumes OECD real GNP
 growth of about 2 to 3 percent above year-earlier
 levels, roughly what the major forecasting organiza-
 tions now expect. Oil consumption under these cir-
 cumstances will approximate 45 million b/d during
 the third quarter and somewhat over 47 million b/d in
 the winter heating season. In general this forecast is
 consistent with prices in the $10 to $12 range. It could
 prove optimistic, however, if economic activity in the
 industrialized countries falters.
 Inventory Overhang. Under normal circumstances we
 would expect a seasonal inventory drawdown in the
 fourth quarter of less than 1 million b/d. It could
 prove much larger this time, however, because of the
 large inventory overhang accumulated in recent
 months. This unusually high stock accumulation was
 driven largely by buyers' expectations that prices
 would rise later this year to the $1,8-per-barrel level.
 This is unlikely to happen-the market is rapidly
 coming to recognize that prices will not rise to that
 level-and buyers may now decide that inventories
 are in fact far too high and accelerate the destocking
 that normally occurs. If this process happens too
 rapidly it would contribute to price volatility. Indeed,
 the high inventory accumulation that occurred in
 recent months probably prevented' prices from falling
 even further than they have.

 OPEC and Non-OPEC:
 An Unlikely Partnership
 In the wake of the recent price collapse, we cannot
 rule out that nonmembers might join OPEC in an
 international production-sharing pact to stabilize the
 market. Norway's new government, for example, re-
 cently met with an OPEC minister and indicated it
 might be willing to support higher prices by limiting
 future increases in output.
 Recent trends suggest, however, that any such coali-
 tion will be shrouded in distrust and guided by a
 you first " principle. The non-OPEC oil producers
 that have expressed a possible willingness to cooper-
 ate this year-Oman, Egypt, Mexico, Malaysia, Bru-
 nei, Angola, and China-have said that any cutbacks
 are contingent upon a new OPEC output ceiling
 substantially below current production levels. More-
 over, the cutbacks they have suggested are less than
 the amount already reduced because of lost market
 share in earlier rounds of the price war.
 In our view, attempts to maintain a long standing
 agreement between OPEC and nonmembers probably
 would be thwarted. The wide divergence in interests
 among all oil producers probably would lead to the
 same kind of violations that currently plague OPEC
 and would work to undermine an international pro-
 duction-sharing pact. For example, the major non-
 OPEC exporters-the United Kingdom, Norway, and
 Canada-are industrialized nations with larger,
 more diversified economies and are less dependent
 than OPEC on oil for revenue. In addition, non-
 OPEC LDCs striving for energy self-sufficiency are
 unlikely to join in an effort that would dampen their
 production prospects.
 company recently announced intentions to boost oil
 exports over the course of the year by about 200,000
 b/d. Even wealthier OPEC states have suffered from.
 the lower oil prices, and countries like the UAE,
 Kuwait, and Qatar appear adamant to keep oil ex-
 ports at a high level.
 Saudi Oil Production Policy. Saudi Arabia will play
 the key role in determining market conditions over the
 balance of 1986. The Saudis now hold about 15
 percent of the world oil market-about 6 million b/d.
 If Riyadh is determined to maintain this share of the
 market and demand fails to grow as market analysts
 are forecasting-either because of excessive destock-
 ing or slow economic growth-prices could drop well
 below the $10 per barrel level and stay there until
 other producers back out. The Saudi dilemma is that
 at $10 per barrel Riyadh's oil revenues approximate
 $18 billion annually, below the level Saudi Arabia
 earned last year. Even if Riyadh adjusted its present
 stance and decided to shave output to bolster prices it
 may not work. Specifically, Riyadh has no guarantee
 that other producers would not replace Saudi supplies.
 Saudi Arabia.
 We continue to believe that Riyadh would like to see
 prices stabilize, at least for a while, at around the $15-
 per-barrel level. At this price we believe that the
 Saudis would be comfortable with a production level
 of about 4.5 million b/d-enough to generate a
 revenue flow of roughly $20 billion. The 4.5-million-
 b/d level would also assure Riyadh's position as the
 world's largest oil exporter, a goal we believe was
 important to Riyadh when it initiated the market
 share fight last August. We doubt, however, that the
 Saudis will substantially reduce production to achieve
 the $15-per-barrel price level unless they are reason-
 ably certain that others will not simply increase their
 market share at Saudi expense. The major risk Saudi
 Arabia runs may be the danger of retaliation from
 Iran if Riyadh is unyielding on the production front.
 Tehran is pushing for higher prices and, if diplomatic'
 pressures fail to convince Riyadh to stabilize prices,
 we are concerned that Iran may increase pressure on

 aimed at expanding economic cooperation, particular-

 Kuwait also will participate in highly visible joint
 development projects with the USSR in third coun-

 successful, Moscow probably will increase its use of
 commercial arrangements for political as well as
 economic gains with other Persian Gulf countries.

 Kuwait and Moscow also agreed to cooperate on

 extended a $150 million loan to Moscow, and the
 Soviets offered to allow Kuwaiti banks to purchase
 Soviet treasury bonds. After discussing Kuwaiti de-
 fense needs with Defense Minister Salim al-Ahmad,
 Katushev declared Soviet willingness to accept oil in
 payment for Soviet exports, according to press reports.

 issues and signed a memorandum of agreement that

 ? Cooperation in construction of energy and economic

 Arab nations.
 ? Development of ties between Soviet and Kuwaiti

 Kuwait's efforts to build a world-class international
 oil industry took a major step when it purchased the
 US-based Santa Fe International Corporation for
 $2.5 billion in 1981. At the time of purchase, the
 company employed 14,000 people and had reserves of
 $1.2 billion. The company is split into four divisions:
 ? Santa Fe Drilling Company. One of the world's
 largest and foremost contract drilling operators. At
 the time of purchase it had about 85 rigs engaged in
 offshore and onshore operations in 16 countries,
 including several in the Middle East.
 ? Santa Fe Minerals, Inc. An exploration and produc-
 tion group set up in 1969. It is active in the United
 States and in the UK North Sea with a share in
 Thistle oilfield production. It also is involved in
 exploration work in the South China Sea.
 ? C. F. Braun. An engineering, firm with an impressive
 list of work worldwide. This division designs, engi-
 neers, and constructs petroleum refineries, chemical
 and petrochemical plants, and power plants. It also
 has the available expertise to construct synthetic
 fuel plants.
 ? Santa Fe Engineering and Construction. This divi-
 sion is involved in marine construction, underwater
 services, and specialized shaft drilling for construc-
 tion and mining industries.
 Something for Everyone
 Both Kuwait and the USSR stand to benefit from the
 agreement, which probably will be more extensive
 than initial reports indicated. Access to Western
 technology could enhance the Soviets' oil-processing
 capabilities. Moreover, the equipment comes cheaply
 to the Soviets, who may use the Kuwaiti loan to
 finance the purchase. While the Soviets would like to
 increase their oil exploration capabilities within the
 USSR, acquisition of the advanced technology could
 be used to improve their relatively poor oil exploration
 record in other countries.
 The composition of Moscow's delegation to last
 week's meeting is an indication of the significance the
 Soviets attach to their relationship with Kuwait and
 of their awareness that this agreement could allow
 them political rewards at little cost. Using Kuwaiti
 financing and technology, Moscow will participate in
 Kuwaiti development projects in third countries,
 which may make the Soviet presence appear less
 threatening. The Soviets probably hope that offering
 development assistance and high-quality technology
 will enhance their image in Arab and Third World
 countries and provide them political entree.
 The Kuwaitis, whose motivations appear primarily
 political, also will gain from the partnership. Since the
 US freeze of Libyan assets, the Kuwaiti Government
 has been under domestic pressure to reduce its invest-
 ments in the United States. The well-publicized
 agreement with the Soviets will relieve some of this
 pressure and burnish Kuwait's nonaligned credentials.

 The Kuwaitis have become increasingly alarmed over
 the last six months about the possibility of an Iranian

 which will reduce earlier recriminations about the

 Implications for the United States
 If the proposed agreement proves fruitful, the Soviets
 may be emboldened to seek similar arrangements with
 other Persian Gulf countries. The Soviets established
 diplomatic relations last year with Oman and the
 UAE, although these ties are developing quite slowly.
 It is not the policy of the other Gulf countries-as it is
 Kuwait's-to seek balanced relations with the super-
 powers, but they might be willing to respond favor-
 ably to overtures from the Soviets. Even so, the
 immediate political gains for Moscow would be mini-
 mal, and probably would not be commensurate with
 the commercial benefits. If Moscow proceeds slowly
 and cautiously in cultivating a long-term relationship
 with the Gulf states, including arms deals and securi-
 ty guarantees, US security ties to some Gulf states
 would be jeopardized. As Kuwait has done, the Gulf
 states would try to play the superpowers against one
 another to maximize their economic and political
 investments.

 LDC Banking Systems:
 Impact of Liberalization
 The banking systems of some key LDCs are undergo-
 ing major changes as a result of debt-related reform
 programs and past bad management policies. Despite
 domestic political pressure on governments to support
 failing banks, a number of institutions may be allowed
 to go under as a result of changes in LDC financial
 systems. Disagreements, however, over how to handle
 the debts that failed banks have outstanding to inter-
 national creditors threaten to make debt restructuring
 negotiations more difficult.
 removed indexation and drastically reduced the re-
 cord profits earned by Brazilian banks. The inefficien-
 cies, previously hidden by high real interest rates and
 indexation before 1986, are forcing the banking sys-
 tem to cut back on personnel and to charge for
 services that previously have been free. Embassy
 reporting suggests that, despite these cost-cutting
 measures, many banks continue to experience liquid-
 ity problems and that further bankruptcies are being
 avoided only by government-approved accounting
 methods that allow banks to ignore overdue debts
 Third World banking systems historically have lagged
 behind the development of Third World economies.
 Most systems are comprised of highly inefficient
 state-owned institutions with officers who often lack
 the training necessary, or the willingness, to assess
 risks in a competitive loan market. These problems
 have been exacerbated by: forced low-interest loans to
 dying, yet still favored, industries; government-
 directed takeovers of poorly run firms; and govern-
 ment-approved accounting practices that overlook
 nonperforming assets. As both government spending
 and private-sector investment have fallen off, many
 LDC domestic banks have been left with the burden
 of managing large accumulations of bad debt.
 Three countries-Brazil, South Korea, and the Philip-
 pines-are illustrative of the problems and vulnerabil-
 ities of LDC banking systems.
 The Brazilian banking system, one of the more
 sophisticated financial systems in Latin America, is
 now suffering the results of attempts at liberalization
 begun last year as well as recent monetary reform.
 The Cruzado Plan, implemented in March 1986, has
 from state-owned enterprises.
 Until 1985, these types of problems were solved by
 merging weak institutions with stronger firms and
 then having the government step into stabilize the
 newly formed company and resolve its outstanding
 debts. President Sarney's government, however, has
 discontinued these types of bailouts. When three
 private Brazilian banks-Comind, Auxiliar, and Mai-
 sonnave-failed last year, the government liquidated
 the banks and denied responsibility for the obligations
 of the three banks to foreign creditors. The govern-
 ment's position became a major obstacle in negotia-
 tions to reschedule $31 billion in Brazilian commer-
 cial debt and trade credits, although a compromise
 settlement appears to be imminent. The current up-
 heaval caused by the Cruzado Plan probably will
 cause a few more banks to close, but, if Brasilia's anti-
 inflation package is successful, other financial institu-
 tions should emerge in better shape.
 In South Korea, the financial press has warned that
 there are billions of dollars of bad loans-accumulat-
 ed through government-directed policy loans to fa-
 vored industries-that render the Korean banking
 system technically insolvent. Most of these loans are
 long-term, low-interest government credits to South

 Korea's huge shipbuilding and construction conglom-
 erates. Such government support of these companies
 helped backstop the economic prosperity of the 1970s.
 These firms now are suffering the effects of a slump
 in the construction and shipbuilding industries, and
 the burden is being shouldered by Korean banks and
 the government, according to US Embassy reporting.
 For example, when the Kukje conglomerate, the
 country's sixth largest, went bankrupt last year, the
 government-faced with the prospect of letting
 Kukje's creditor banks fail-stepped in to guarantee
 all outstanding debts. Such support for domestic
 banks, however, has put a sizable strain on the
 national budget, and the economy would not easily
 sustain the failure of either a major bank or another
 major conglomerate. As a result, we believe Korean
 officials, under renewed pressure to protect domestic
 banks for local interests and nationalistic pride, may
 have to scale back their reform schedule.
 While the Philippines' financial system as a whole is
 in a stronger position than in 1984, there are some
 banks that remain vulnerable. A few of the largest
 commercial banks were able to show hefty profits last
 year, but a greater number of small commercial banks
 are still suffering from a liquidity crisis that began in
 1984, according to press reports. Those private banks
 that have survived did so by maintaining a high
 degree of liquidity and channeling money into high-
 interest government securities. Many of these banks
 continued to increase in size by attracting deposits
 from weaker domestic banks and strengthening their
 capital base.
 Government-owned banks, holding 35 percent of the
 assets in the commercial banking system, are a weak-
 er link in the Philippine financial sector, however.
 Recent press estimates state that up to 80 percent of
 their assets are nonperforming. Many of the problems
 of these institutions are the result of past policies that
 fostered low-interest loans to Marcos's political cro-
 nies. This has left the Aquino administration the
 unpopular task of implementing banking reforms
 needed to meet conditions for IMF and World Bank
 support. Of the total government deficit for 1986,
 about $1 billion (65 percent) will be needed to stave
 off bankruptcies in state-run financial corporations,
 an amount equal to 17 percent of total projected
 government spending.
 Minimum capital requirements instituted by the new
 government will put pressure on undercapitalized
 state-owned banks-specifically the Development
 Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine
 National Bank (PNB)--to consolidate, potentially
 causing 15,000 employees to be fired, according to
 Embassy reports. In mid-July, the Central Bank
 Governor outlined a reform program that is to trans-
 fer nonperforming assets of the DBP and PNB to a
 management trust, thereby cutting in half the involve-
 ment of government banks in the system and accom-
 plishing a primary goal of banking-sector reform.
 Because of many problems in the Philippine banking
 sector, the Aquino government will not attempt to
 significantly liberalize the financial sector this year,
 according to the US Embassy. International bankers
 agree, stating that it will be many months before a
 streamlining of the system is politically feasible. An
 IMF team visiting Manila in June 1986, however,
 observed steps under way to clean up government
 financial institutions, specifically citing one major
 government bank, the DBP, as moving ahead on
 reforms. Nevertheless, in our judgment, Aquino will
 accelerate banking reforms only if substantial im-
 provement in the performance of the economy is
 forthcoming.
 We believe many LDCs, including the Philippines and
 South Korea, will encounter some difficulties in re-
 forming their banking systems, while a few such as
 Brazil will probably proceed with liberalization mea-
 sures. LDCs that do move to reform their banking
 systems will do so in the face of significant domestic
 opposition:
 ? Financial-sector liberalization is opposed by those
 who are wary of increasing foreign influence in
 domestic markets.
 ? Reforms that increase competition in the banking
 sector probably will force more bank closures and
 increase unemployment.
 ? Greater privatization in the banking systems will
 decrease government power by transferring control
 of financial resources to the private sector.

 LDC governments' efforts to liberalize their banking
 systems could complicate relations with international
 creditors if further bank failures are the result. In
 particular, most LDC banks have fully utilized credit
 lines with international banks and, as greater compe-
 tition forces some banks to fail, loan obligations to
 foreign creditors could then hold up international debt
 negotiations. A large number of closures could easily
 overwhelm the abilities of some debtor governments
 to cover payments to foreign creditors.

 meters of Soviet gas in 1987 rising to an annual level of 4 billion cubic meters by
 1992. In exchange, the Soviets must purchase Turkish exports equal to about 70
 percent of the value of the natural gas in the first three years of the agreement     25X1

 United States to investigate nuclear safety issues. Beijing's recent press blitz
 includes reporting on Deng Xiaoping's support for the nuclear program, on
 extensive new domestic safety regulations, and on both new and continuing nuclear
 safety cooperation with France and the United States. The French, who hope to
 supply the plant's two reactors, agreed last week to provide full-scale nuclear
 safety cooperation to China free of charge; the United States last week sold China
 a simulator to train nuclear power plant operators. A pullout by Hong Kong would
 probably force China to cancel the project, further reducing its commercial
 nuclear program to plans for one to three domestically built reactors at Qinshan,
 near Shanghai.

 commercial bank creditors again but warned that hope was slim for any further
 concessions. Earlier this year the commercial banks reluctantly agreed to resched-

 of about $1 billion between payments and earnings this year and will continue to
 appeal to all creditors for new loans and reschedulings. Ultimately, Warsaw will
 have to seek IMF assistance to balance creditors' demands and to develop a
 comprehensive package to deal with its debt problems. The IMF will require
 Warsaw to accept austerity measures as a condition for new credits. The Poles,

 New Japanese
 Finance Minister
 Favors Economic
 Stimulus
 Developed Countries
 Prime Minister Nakasone's appointment this week of Kiichi Miyazawa places a
 longtime advocate of increased public works spending at the helm of the powerful
 Finance Ministry. Miyazawa, who served in the Finance Ministry for several years
 before entering politics in the 1950s, is best known for his proposal to double
 spending on basic infrastructure over the next decade. He recently called for a $19
 billion supplemental budget this fall-a record if implemented-to spur Japan's
 lagging economy. We do not believe Miyazawa's appointment signals a major shift
 in Japan's five-year-old policy of budget austerity. Instead, it appears Nakasone
 gave Miyazawa, a longtime political rival, the post in part to quell his criticism of
 the Prime Minister's conservative economic policy. Although Miyazawa may be
 able-with the support of politicians and business groups concerned by the
 economic slowdown-to push through a modest pump-priming package this fall,
 his influence on the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins in April, is
 questionable.
 Ministry's budget guidelines.
 The previous Cabinet on Monday approved stringent guidelines for ministries
 drawing up budget requests for FY 1987. The guidelines, which call for a 1-
 percent increase in general government expenditures, again require cuts in most
 programs-except defense (allowed a 6.3-percent increase) and foreign aid (al-
 lowed a 7.5-percent rise). Recent public statements by Nakasone, moreover,
 suggest he remains committed to the goal of eliminating most types of deficit

 Ottawa Considers       Ottawa's continuing budget deficit, as well as expected tax reform in the United
 New Tax as Remedy     States, is sharpening Finance Minister Wilson's determination to introduce a
 for Budget Deficit    value-added tax-although under a different name. Wilson is worried by projec-
 tions that Canada's 1986 budget deficit will be $1.5 billion larger than initially
 forecast-reaching $23 billion-mainly because of the impact of low oil prices.
 Two successive unpopular budgets-which emphasized personal and corporate tax
 surcharges and sales tax increases-and the expected widening of the divergence
 between marginal rates in the United States and Canada as a result of US tax re-
 form, are curbing Ottawa's enthusiasm for hiking tax rates to control the deficit.
 Instead, Wilson favors introducing a business transfer tax (BTT)-in effect a
 value-added tax on consumer goods and services-to replace the narrowly based
 federal sales tax and the recent surcharges. The BTT's primary advantage is its
 broad base, which would permit Ottawa to raise substantial revenue with only
 modest increases in the BTT rate. The Cabinet guardedly approved Wilson's
 proposal two weeks ago, and it is expected to be the centerpiece of a tax reform
 plan to be released in the fall.
 Spain Pushing         To reduce the strain on the troubled government-run pension system, Madrid has
 Private Pension Funds introduced legislation that will not only allow the creation of private pension funds
 but will also encourage them with a series of tax incentives. The bill is supported
 by business and labor and should be signed into law before the end of the year.
 Government officials look to the new funds-70 percent of whose assets must be
 invested in government securities, stocks, bonds, and mortgages-to provide
 venture capital for startup companies and to offer alternative long-term financing
 to private firms. Businessmen believe that the reduction of their onerous social
 security contributions will enable them to increase investment. Labor unions have
 given their support with the stipulation that the government must continue to
 guarantee state pensions. We do not see this as a problem, however, since Madrid
 is not likely to abandon its constitutionally mandated responsibility. It aims,
 rather, to move toward the model prevalent in most other industrial countries in
 which state pensions are augmented by private pension plans.
 Less Developed Countries
 Philippine Agricultural According to government data, Philippine agricultural output in the first quarter
 Output Improves       of this year rose 2.5 percent above the level recorded during the same period in
 1985, a sharp contrast to the performance of the industry and services sectors,
 which contracted by 3 percent, and total national output, which grew by less than
 1 percent. Production of rice and corn-the two most common crops-increased
 by 8 and 13 percent, respectively, aided by good weather, government credit
 programs, and the elimination of price ceilings for major crops. The sector's only
 production decline was registered by sugar, where output dropped 10 percent in re-
 sponse to record-low world market prices. The growth of the rural economy has
 probably helped many Filipinos adjust to widespread unemployment in urban
 areas. Nevertheless, increasing the standard of living in the countryside-where
 incomes have been depressed by rapid population growth and marketing monopo-
 lies for agricultural products-is likely to require agricultural growth rates of over

 and probably will approach $12 billion in 1986.
 ~In addition, Taipei has announced it will increase domestic
 spending on social development projects from 3 percent of GNP to 15 percent over
 the next five years. Taipei may believe these measures will deflect foreign-
 principally US-criticism of Taiwan's trade surplus and huge foreign exchange
 holdings. However, these moves neither cut exports nor increase imports. More-
 over, Taiwan has deferred several major industrial projects involving US firms
 that would have reduced its bilateral surplus, which topped $10 billion last year
 Coffee Downturn      Kenya's hopes of improving its foreign payments position and reducing its budget
 Shortens Kenya's Boom deficit have been hurt as world coffee prices have declined by about 25 percent
 since first quarter 1986, according to the US Embassy. Coffee earnings for 1986
 probably will exceed 1985 receipts by only 40 percent, well short of earlier
 government projections of about 80 percent. The current account deficit could
 widen by more than $100 million unless the government acts to reduce imports.
 Moreover, lower tax revenues probably will undermine Nairobi's plan to cut its
 budget deficit from the 1985/86 level of 4.5 percent of GDP to 3.5 percent of GDP
 for 1986/87.
 Rising Food          In a 9 July speech, Afghan Prime Minister Keshtmand expressed concern over the
 Prices in Kabul      continuously rising price of some foods-particularly fruits and vegetables-in
 Kabul. While the overall foodstuff price index in Kabul rose only 7 percent in
 1985, the index for fruits and vegetables increased 17 and 23 percent, respectively,
 according to official Afghan data. Keshtmand claimed rising transportation costs
 are partly responsible. The increase in transportation costs is probably the result of
 the poor security conditions in the countryside and the high demand for trucking
 services from both the private sector and the black market. Keshtmand also cited
 various production constraints including farmers' preference for growing wheat,
 inadequate irrigation and storage facilities, and a weak marketing infrastructure
 as contributors to rising produce costs. Fresh produce is frequently unaffordable
 for many Kabul residents. Lack of a varied diet has caused malnutrition in 60 per-
 cent of Kabul's children, according to recent reports from medical personnel in
 Kabul.

 Turkish                Turkey's current account deficit more than tripled to $690 million in first quarter
 Current Account        1986, compared with the same period last year, largely because of a 17-percent
 Deficit Rises          rise in imports and a drop in worker remittances and tourism revenues. The jump
 in imports follows liberalization by Ankara of restrictive import rules, although
 government officials attribute the rise to a temporary surge in imports for
 government investment. Net tourism revenues declined 22 percent, apparently
 because of concerns over terrorism and because Turks are increasingly taking
 advantage of their new opportunities to travel abroad legally. Worker remittances
 fell 31 percent to $290 million, perhaps because of layoffs of Turkish workers in
 oil-producing countries. Dislocations in these countries also hurt Turkish exports.
 If it continues, the widening current account deficit will complicate Ankara's
 efforts to meet the high level of debt repayments due over the next several years
 and could shake confidence in the Ozal government's economic program
 Baghdad Reshuffles     The US Embassy reports that Iraqi President Saddam Husayn has returned some
 Economic Decision      key economic powers to First Deputy Prime Minister Ramadan by appointing him
 Making Authority       head of the "presidential committee" that controls foreign exchange. The decision
 was announced during an extra session of the Bath Party Congress called by
 Saddam earlier this month to counter growing criticism of his monopolizing
 decisions on the war and the economy. The creation of the presidential committee
 by Saddam earlier this year-after the collapse in oil prices-had centralized
 decisionmaking and undermined Ramadan's role as the chief architect of econom-
 ic policy. In retaliation, according to the Embassy, Ramadan-who orchestrated
 tough austerity measures in 1982-83-stymied decisions on several economic
 matters. By putting Ramadan back in charge, Baghdad probably will be better
 able to eliminate bureaucratic delays that have hampered efforts to deal with
 lower oil revenues.
 Tanzania Presents    Tanzania's 1986/87 budget presented last month calls for total spending increases
 New Budget           of about 70 percent, a 25-percent exchange rate devaluation, and price increases of
 30 to 80 percent for agricultural products, according to the US Embassy. Other
 measures-including reductions in income tax rates and increased allowances for
 public workers-probably were taken to appease opponents to economic reform.
 Although the government is avoiding a heavy reliance on domestic borrowing and
 has introduced additional taxes on a wide range of goods to help fund the increased
 expenditures, the boost in government expenditures may impair negotiations for an
 IMF program. Moreover, deep ideological divisions within the Mwinyi government
 remain a stumblingblock in implementing additional IMF-supported austerity
 measures.

 Zimbabwean
 Budget Problems
 month, the budget will show a $520 million deficit, more than 10 percent of GDP.
 The government is negotiating a $125 million loan from the World Bank but will
 have to resort mainly to inflationary borrowing from the domestic banking system
 to finance the deficit. Although the Cabinet has agreed on the need to cut
 recurrent expenditures in order to devote more to investment, it has been unwilling
 to make hard decisions on major line items such as education or defense spending
 for the maintenance of Zimbabwean troops in Mozambique.
 Soviet Grain Prospects Meteorological and other reporting indicate that dryness in the southern and
 Less Favorable       central Volga region-dating from April-continues and has spread to the North
 Caucasus, Central Chernozem, and northwestern Kazakhstan. A week of hot,
 drying winds further stressed crops in mid-June in the lower Volga and Rostov re-
 gions and in eastern and central Ukraine. The affected areas produce about
 20 percent of Soviet grain. The remaining grain regions, including the New Lands,
 still look favorable. Given normal weather for the remainder of the season, Soviet
 grain production probably will reach only 190 million tons, below last year's
 estimated output of 195 million tons and far short of the goal of 220-230 million
 tons Agriculture Minister Nikitin recently mentioned to US Department of
 Agriculture officials. If weather conditions continue to deteriorate, the 1986 crop
 may fall below the estimated 184-million-ton average for 1981-85.

 Deficit Persists       probably will be close to last year's level of roughly $10 billion, according to
 estimates by the consulate in Hong Kong. As a result, China's foreign exchange
 reserves will continue to decline, and Beijing is likely to step up pressure on foreign
 countries to ease restrictions on imports of Chinese goods. Beijing has enjoyed
 striking success with its efforts to make up for lost oil revenues by promoting sales
 of grain, textiles, and coal; a surge in exports-up 13.3 percent over the same peri-
 od in 1985-brought China's midyear deficit down from last year's level of $5.3
 billion. Continued growth, however, in imports-up 6.2 percent-was evidence of
 Beijing's inability to cut imports of capital equipment and raw materials needed
 for its industrial modernization. Despite cutbacks in imports of 16 commodities
 (including fertilizers, televisions, automobiles, and synthetic fibers), China's de-
 mand for iron ore and rolled steel remains strong.
