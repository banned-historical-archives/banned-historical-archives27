 Perspective            OPEC: No Solutions in Sight
 OPEC ministers meet on Monday for the second time in less than three weeks
 amid an atmosphere bordering on despair. As the ministers gather this
 weekend in Geneva, the near term offers few promising options. Weak oil
 demand, rising competition from non-OPEC producers, and internal disarray
 continue to challenge OPEC's ability to avert a major price break. OPEC's
 falling oil revenues have placed financial pressures on its members and forced
 them to compete against each other for oil sales
 At the early July meeting, financially strapped Nigeria, Iraq, and Ecuador
 bitterly opposed a stopgap plan to reduce every member's production quota by
 7 percent. Algeria, Iran, and Libya, who have joined other members in
 underselling official OPEC prices through barter deals and discounting,
 argued against any adjustment in the official price structure. Such hypocrisy
 contributed to an atmosphere of distrust among members, who'were quick to
 blame each other for the organization's predicament
 A sword hanging over Monday's meeting is the Saudi threat to cease acting as
 the organization's swing producer. At the last session, Petroleum Minister
 Yamani bluntly warned that Saudi output would be boosted unilaterally if the
 members continue to violate established price and production guidelines.
 Poorer and more populous OPEC nations have little sympathy for the Saudi's
 economic plight, but they realize that a decision by Riyadh to follow through
 on its threats would trigger a price war.
 Pressure for a downward price adjustment has mounted in the two weeks since
 the ministers last met. Mexico lowered its oil prices for the second time in less
 than a month, US and Canadian producers have cut light oil prices, and press
 reports indicate that Egypt will do the same. According to US. Embassy
 reporting, Venezuela-with exports down sharply-is waiting until after the
 meeting to announce a badly needed price cut.
 OPEC members realize that even concerted action in Geneva will not alter the
 gloomy demand outlook for its oil over the next two years:
 ? Oil consumption will remain steady, while non-OPEC production is expected
 to rise by nearly 1 million barrels per day (b/d) this year and about 500,000
 b/d in 1986.
 ? Substitution of other fuels for oil is occurring at a rapid pace, and
 conservation efforts continue to improve energy efficiency.
 As a result, demand for OPEC oil probably will be only 16-17 million b/d
 through 1986, roughly one-half the 1979 level.

 Indeed, some members are seriously questioning the value of remaining in
 OPEC, if it means only additional production restraint and declining revenues.
 Production discipline is no longer viewed as a short-term sacrifice guarantee-
 ing a brighter future, but as a long-term headache with no relief in sight.
 While OPEC's most effective course of action would be to cut production
 further, an allocation scheme acceptable to all members does not appear
 negotiable at this time. The other alternative, price cuts, would be slow to spur
 demand and would only increase pressure on revenue-starved members to
 violate production quotas. Bolder initiatives-such as a central marketing
 organization for OPEC crudes-may be necessary to break the deadlock but
 have little support going into the meeting.
 In any case,.OPEC lacks the innovative leadership and resolve needed to deal
 with its problems. In the unlikely event that members pull together in Geneva,
 they will still have little cause to celebrate. Yet, if OPEC fails to act, July 1985
 may well mark a de facto dissolution of the cartel as members attempt to solve
 their problems individual1 . Even Yamani-once a voice of optimism within
 OPEC                  said following the debacle earlier this month that
 the group will cease to be an effective entity over the next six months until
 members once again realize that a united OPEC is in their own self-interest.

 Saudi Arabia: Threats To Boost
 Oil Output Unilaterally
 Shrinking government revenues have forced Saudi
 officials to consider boosting crude oil production
 unilaterally if other OPEC countries fail to adhere
 to production quotas and official prices. They be-
 lieve they are bearing an unfair burden as swing
 producer, particularly now that spending cutbacks
 are beginning to affect domestic programs. Petro-
 leum Minister Yamani has publicly threatened to
 boost Saudi oil production if other OPEC countries
 continue to "cheat." The Saudis hope their threats
 to increase production will prod other members to
 agree to a new quota and pricing scheme, but they
 are prepared to act on their own if no new agree-
 ment is reached and observed.
 Riyadh's goal of a $55 billion balanced budget was
 unrealistic from the outset. Despite projected
 spending cuts of about 14 percent, declining oil
 revenues are pushing the red ink to levels that
 Saudi officials find unacceptable. Saudi output fell
 to an estimated 2.1 million b/d in June, far below
 the 3.8 million b/d on which Riyadh's current
 budget is based. We believe Riyadh wants to avoid
 having to finance a budget deficit much larger than
 $10 billion because it has already drawn down its
 liquid international assets from $135 billion to $90
 billion in less than three years. If crude production
 averages 2 million b/d for the fiscal year, at
 current prices and spending levels, Riyadh would
 face at least a $20 billion deficit.
 If the Saudis tried to pare spending by an addition-
 al $10 billion, outlays would be nearly 40 percent
 below last year's level-an almost impossible feat
 for both political and bureaucratic reasons. For the
 first time since oil revenues began to decline,
 budget cuts are being targeted toward Saudi citi-
 zens. Allowances, benefits, bonuses, and other pay-
 ments received by civilian employees of the Saudi
 Government already have been severely curtailed,
 amid loud complaints. Saudi officials are chary of
 cutting broader consumer subsidies after seeing the
 political disturbances that followed similar cuts in
 Morocco, Tunisia, and Sudan.
 The Saudis are calculating that the prospect of the
 market disruption and downward price spiral that a
 unilateral production increase would cause will
 induce other OPEC members to maintain better
 discipline. The opening gambit came during a
 meeting of OPEC's Ministerial Executive Commit-  25X1
 tee in early June, in which Yamani read a letter
 from King Fahd stating that, if any OPEC member
 cheats, they all have the right to do so. According
 to the US Embassy, Yamani said that Saudi
 Arabia could easily expand production to 4.35
 million b/d-its implied quota under the current
 OPEC agreement.                        Ya-  25X1

 indicate prices might initially fall to $12 to $15 per
 barrel. Lower prices probably would not be trans-
 lated into significantly higher demand-particular-
 ly in the short run-meaning little budgetary relief
 for Riyadh. For example, at a price of $15 per
 barrel and Saudi output of 3 million b/d, Riyadh
 would still face a $20 billion deficit in the absence
 of any additional spending cuts. At that price, the
 Saudis would have to boost output to 5.7 million
 b/d to hold the deficit to $10 billion without
 cutting spending. Only a smaller price drop or
 better demand response would permit the Saudis to
 stay within their deficit target.
 The Saudis have delayed taking any unilateral
 action until after Monday's OPEC meeting. If an
 agreement on quotas is worked out then, the Saudis
 would probably wait a few months to see how well
 it is observed. If no agreement is reached or if an
 agreement is promptly violated, the odds are better
 than even that the Saudis would boost output
 unilaterally.

 Key LDC Debtors:
 Lackluster Investment
 Portends Problems '
 The high investment growth that powered the
 economies of the key LDC debtors during the past
 two decades may be a thing of the past. After an
 unprecedented four-year plunge, investment in
 these countries is only now beginning to recover.
 Even if this recovery is sustained, we believe invest-
 ment growth through 1989 will be slower than in
 the past. The fallout from this dramatic shift in
 investment behavior will multiply the economic and
 political problems-these countries will face during
 the next decade. In particular, slow investment
 growth will limit their economic recovery, further
 aggravating existing political and economic ten-
 sions. Sluggish investment growth may also place
 additional strain on the international financial sys-
 tem by jeopardizing compliance with IMF-support-
 ed programs and eroding trade competitiveness.
 In general, investment growth in the key LDC
 debtors was impressive before the international
 financial crisis shattered the two-decade-old trend.
 Over the past four years, investment in these
 countries declined by nearly $55 billion-a 30-
 percent drop. Investment last year was well below
 1980 levels in each country. (See foldout on page
 13.) In Argentina, investment plunged by nearly 55
 percent during the past four years. The investment
 slump was severe, but less dramatic, in Chile,
 Brazil, Peru, and Mexico. At the end of last year,
 their investment stood 25 to 35 percent below 1980
 levels. Nigeria, the Philippines, and Venezuela
 fared somewhat better, registering investment de-
 clines of only 10 percent.
 debtors include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
 the Philippines, and Venezuela. Investment refers to gross fixed
 investment-investment in structures, machinery, and equipment.
 All dollar values and growth rates are based on constant 1980 US
 We believe three key factors underlie the recent
 investment slump:
 ? Financing difficulties probably were the major
 drag on investment. The pool of funds available
 for investment fell by 15 percent during the last
 two years. Lower domestic savings and reduced
 access to foreign borrowing stifled investment by
 either pushing up financing costs or, where inter-
 est rate controls exist, causing. a shortage of
 funds.
 ? Economic recession produced an unprecedented
 slump in aggregate demand that led to an invest-
 ment decline when the expected returns from
 investment projects plummeted and internally
 generated investment funds dried up.
 ? Heightened economic and political uncertainty
 also contributed to poor investment performance.
 Investors found it impossible to gauge the future
 returns from projects, and-massive capital flight
 restricted the supply of investment funds.
 Our analysis indicates that investment in the key
 LDC debtors will rebound during 1985-89, but it is
 unlikely that investment growth will be high
 enough to restore investment to its level before the
 international financial crisis. We expect investment
 to grow at an average annual rate of 3 to 5 percent 25X1
 during the rest of this decade, a dramatic improve-
 ment over the average decline of 8.2 percent regis-
 tered during the past four years, but well below the
 7.3 percent average growth of the 1971-80 period.
 Even if these countries sustain investment growth
 of 5 percent through 1989, only two-thirds of the
 1981-84 investment decline will be reversed.

 In our judgment, a modest economic recovery in
 the key LDC debtors during 1985-89 will lead to an
 investment rebound. Rising aggregate demand
 should stimulate investment by increasing the ex-
 pected returns from investment projects. We fore-
 see minimal improvement, however, in the other
 key factors affecting the pace of investment. Slug-
 gish domestic savings and limited access to foreign
 borrowing suggest that the high cost/limited avail-
 ability of investment funds will continue to put a
 damper on capital formation. A significant im-
 provement in the underlying level of political-
 economic stability in these countries also appears
 unlikely.
 Individual Country Outlooks
 Our analysis indicates that investment growth in
 the key LDC debtors will vary widely across coun-
 tries during 1985-89. We believe Mexico will lead
 with investment growth averaging 4 to 6 percent.'
 Although problems exist, Mexico's demand pros-
 pects and political-economic stability are ranked
 higher than those of the other countries. After a
 period of harsh austerity, demand is projected by
 the major economic consulting firms to grow at an
 average annual rate approaching 5 percent. Al-
 though opposition parties are gaining strength, the
 long tenure of the government party should lead to
 relative political-economic stability. Regarding the
 availability of investment funds, only Venezuela is
 ranked higher. Mexico's banking system is relative-
 ly mature and efficient, but inflation, devaluation
 fears, and capital flight will continue to dampen
 domestic savings and limit the supply of investment
 funds
 In Venezuela and Brazil, annual investment growth
 is likely to average 3 to 5 percent through 1989.
 With demand projected to grow at an annual rate
 of about 4 percent, the demand prospects of these
 countries are relatively good. Venezuela's tradition-
 ally high savings rate, low inflation, and relatively
 stable currency earned Caracas the highest ranking
 for availability of investment funds. Investment
 funds may be more scarce in Brazil because of
 triple-digit inflation and high devaluation risk.
 Given Venezuela's two decades of democracy and
 the broad popular and military support for the
 constitutional process in Brazil, the future political-
 should be relatively stable.
 In Peru, Chile, and the Philippines, we believe
 investment will grow 2 to 4 percent a year through
 1989. Demand prospects are considered fair-GDP
 ' Projections were developed by ranking each country according to
 the key factors that will determine investment growth during the          25X1
 1985-89 period-aggregate demand prospects, cost/availability of
 investment funds, and the stability of the political economic system.
 By examining these rankings, investment growth projections were
 assessed and a range of average annual investment growth was set
 for each country. Our projections were then compared to, and in
 some cases revised in light of, the investment growth forecasts of
 outside experts. Given the volatility of investment spending, our
 projections should be viewed as benchmarks that indicate the
 underlying trend in investment growth. As has historically been the
 case, annual investment growth may fluctuate dramatically around

 is expected to grow, on average, about 3 percent per
 year. Historically low savings in Chile and inflation
 and devaluation concerns in Peru and the Philip-
 pines should limit the supply of investment funds.
 Instability in all three countries should stifle invest-
 ment growth. In Peru, the nationalistic, left-leaning
 philosophies of President-elect Garcia, the Sendero
 Luminoso insurgency, and a history of shifting
 economic policies raise serious concerns about
 political-economic stability. In the Philippines, a
 country with a more stable economic system, the
 Aquino assassination, the presidential succession
 question, and a growing insurgency have boosted
 investor uncertainty. We believe rising opposition
 to the repressive rule of President Pinochet will
 keep the level of political-economic uncertainty
 high in Chile.
 Investment growth in Argentina and Nigeria
 should be slower than in the other countries, aver-
 aging only 1 to 3 percent through 1989. Demand in
 these countries probably will be sluggish, expand-
 ing at about 2 percent per year, on average.
 Historically, low savings have restricted the supply
 of investment funds in these countries. This trend
 should continue as inflation and devaluation risk
 discourage domestic saving and spur further capital
 flight. Although Argentina has recently taken bold
 steps to reduce runaway inflation, the country's
 economic system may remain unstable. Political
 stability, however, may improve marginally under
 President Alfonsin. If the economy limps along,
 Alfonsin may be the first democratically elected
 president since 1952 to complete his term. Nigeria,
 on the other hand, with a more stable economic
 system has dismal political prospects. Lagos is
 plagued by divisions in the ruling militar  student
 dissatisfaction, and regional tension.
 Even if investment grows at the highest projected
 rates through 1989, only three key LDC debtors
 will regain the ground lost since the international
 financial crisis. Venezuela, the Philippines, and
 Nigeria could have investment in 1989 that is 2 to
 15 percent higher than before the crisis. Their full
 recovery will be the result of less severe investment
 downturns rather than to particularly rapid invest-
 ment growth during 1985-89. In contrast, we pro-
 ject investment in Argentina will still be roughly 50
 percent lower in 1989 than in 1980. Peru and Chile
 may regain more lost ground than Argentina, but
 their investment should still fall about 30 percent
 short of precrisis peaks. Mexico and Brazil should
 regain all but about 10 to 15 percent of the ground
 lost following international financial problems.
 Implications
 Recent and projected investment performance in
 the key LDC debtors foreshadow a number of
 problems. Because investment is required to expand
 productive capacity, slow investment growth will
 limit their rate of economic growth over the longer
 term. On the heels of the drop in living standards
 registered recently, any further declines would
 aggravate existing social tensions. Slow investment
 growth may also impede structural adjustment.
 Economic restructuring may require investment
 growth well above our projections. Slower structur-
 al adjustment could jeopardize compliance with

 IMF-supported programs and cause international
 financial problems and economic inefficiency to
 linger over the longer term. Slow investment
 growth may also limit the flow of new technologies
 to these countries thereby slowing economic growth
 and hurting trade competitiveness.
 If these problems develop, US relations with the
 key LDC debtors could become more contentious:
 ? There could be increased pressure on Washington
 to take these. countries' needs into account during
 the formulation of US monetary, fiscal, and trade
 policies.
 ? These countries could press the United States for
 increased development assistance. In a cash flow
 bind, the United States may be forced into the
 role of "lender of last resort."
 ? If debtor-creditor conflicts arise, the United
 States may be caught in the middle; both debtors
 and creditors would pressure Washington to sup-
 port their positions.

 Cooperation Agreements:
 A Step Forward
 China and the USSR signed a $14 billion five-year
 trade agreement and a separate economic coopera-
 tion agreement-the first such agreement in 20
 years-on 10 July as part of Vice Premier Yao
 Yilin's four-day visit to Moscow. Although some-
 what of a breakthrough in economic relations,
 bilateral trade by 1990 will still only represent less
 than 5 percent of each country's total trade. The
 cooperation agreement could prove more signifi-
 cant in that it will result in direct Soviet participa-
 tion in Chinese industrial projects. Together, the
 two pacts. provide a framework for continued dia-
 logue and improvement in overall political and
 economic relations.
 Terms Negotiated Until Last Minute
 The trade accord reportedly calls for rising levels of
 bilateral trade, reaching $3.5 billion in 1990, for a
 total of $14 billion over the five-year period. By
 comparison, trade conducted during 1981-85 is
 expected to total only $4 billion, with this year's
 figure projected at $1.6 billion. Unlike the trade
 accord, no value was given for the cooperation
 agreement, although
 USSR participation in Chinese industrial pro-
 jects could reach up to $1 billion per year by 1988.
 the long-term
 trade agreement sets out a general framework
 within which annual protocols can be negotiated.
 Two types of barter exchange have reportedly been
 established. The first-as is the case for trade
 now-requires the yearly settlement of accounts.
 The second allows the Chinese to pay for imports of
 capital goods and technical assistance over a multi-
 year period.
 The economic cooperation agreement reportedly
 involves the Soviet supply of machinery, capital
 equipment, and technical assistance to support
 China's Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90). ~     25X1
 the USSR will                  25X1
 participate in seven new Chinese development pro-
 jects-including two thermal power plants, two
 coal mines, and a 1,000 kilometer rail line-as well
 as the renovation of 17 existing plants. Several
 smaller projects have also been targeted for Soviet
 participation. This marks the first time in over 20
 years that the Chinese have asked the Soviets for
 assistance and technology in the construction of
 new plants. During the height of the Sino-Soviet
 relationship in the late 1950s, Moscow was involved
 in over 200 projects in China~~         25X1
 Soviet deliveries of manufactured goods, chemicals,
 raw materials, and transport equipment are also
 likely to rise as a result of the new agreement.
 Beijing will continue to need imports of such Soviet
 metals as nickel and steel alloys. At the same time,
 despite recurring problems with quality and tardy
 delivery, China will probably want to increase its
 imports of timber, industrial chemicals, and fertil-
 izers.
 25X1
 We expect Moscow will seek higher imports of
 meat, soybeans, grain-mostly corn-and other 25X1
 agricultural products. Similarly, to supplement its 25X1
 own production, Soviet imports of wool, cotton,
 apparel, and textiles are likely to rise. Finally if the
 Chinese can increase their domestic production, the
 Soviets also may try to boost their imports of such
 consumer electronics as televisions and radios.
 Clearly, both sides can benefit from an expanded
 economic exchange, but the decision to formalize

 this expansion within a multiyear trade agree-
 ment-after a 20-year hiatus-reflects a slow pro-
 cess of improving relations since 1980:
 ? Regular political consultations at the deputy for-
 eign minister level.
 ? A sharp increase in bilateral trade and a resump-
 tion of scientific and technical exchanges.
 ? Low-level nonpolitical contacts at athletic meets,
 cultural events, and the like.
 Probably the most important of these moves was
 the resumption of Sino-Soviet political discussions
 in October 1982. Although the six rounds of "con-
 sultations" to date have done little to resolve major
 political and security issues, the dialogue has,
 nonetheless, helped reduce tensions. Moreover, by
 expanding various forms of cooperation, as well as
 increasing bilateral trade, Moscow and Beijing
 have helped repair some of the damage inflicted on
 their relationship during the 1960s and 1970s.
 Their success in improving relations, in turn, has
 demonstrated to other countries that Sino-Soviet
 ties are not frozen, even though the two sides
 remain deadlocked on the main issues dividing
 them.
 Besides helping both sides to show some balance in
 their ties to the United States, both countries have
 individual reasons for signing the new accords. The
 Soviets almost certainly look upon the new agree-
 ments with China-especially the project assis-
 tance-as a means of regaining some of the influ-
 ence that they had wielded in Beijing before
 relations deteriorated in the early 1960s. Indeed,
 a number of
 the USSR's top Sinologists believe that there are
 Chinese officials who are dissatisfied with the
 current leadership's policy of developing close ties
 to the West, particularly with the United States.
 According to these Soviet experts, many of the
 more "hopeful" Chinese cadres were educated in
 the USSR during the 1950s, and want a return to
 better relations with Moscow or at least a more
 balanced approach to the two superpowers.F_~
 The Soviets almost certainly have tailored such
 remarks to their Western audience. While the
 degree of Chinese support is probably not as wide-
 spread as the Soviets claim, some Chinese appar-
 ently do see increased trade and economic ex-
 changes-which are unlikely to evolve into
 economic dependencies-as a comparatively safe
 way to improve their relationship with the USSR
 without compromising on more fundamental politi-
 cal issues. Furthermore, the Soviets appear to be
 including Chinese who, as Marxist-Leninists, ad-
 mire the highly centralized Soviet planning system
 (and who have reservations about China's economic
 reforms), but who also have serious problems with
 many Soviet policies, especially toward China.
 Economic Benefits: The Soviet Perspective
 In addition to political reasons, both countries had
 strong economic incentives to sign the new agree-
 ment. Moscow is undoubtedly anxious to boost
 imports of agricultural products and consumer
 goods from China. Besides reducing shortages and
 saving on high transportation costs particularly for
 the Soviet Far East, these increased imports also
 would provide a boost to the Soviet Long Term
 Consumer Goods program that is scheduled to be
 unveiled as part of the upcoming 12th Five-Year
 Plan.
 Another positive aspect of increased trade from
 Moscow's vantage is that it will allow the USSR to
 acquire through barter goods that would otherwise
 require the expenditure of foreign exchange. At the
 same time, Moscow will be supplying goods, pri-
 marily equipment, which have only limited demand
 in the West. Any hard currency savings will be
 relatively small, however, in comparison with total
 hard currency expenditures. China can probably
 supply the USSR with 1-3 million metric tons of
 grain-primarily corn-and several hundred thou-
 sand tons of soybeans annually for at least the next
 few years saving Moscow $200-500 million a year.
 Hard currency expenditures for meat-which aver-
 aged $350 million in 1981-84-could be cut by
 additional purchases from China; in 1984, imports
 of meat from China totaled over $100 million.

 The Chinese Side of the Ledger
 Increased sales to the USSR will provide China
 with an outlet for its growing production of textile
 fibers, fabrics, and apparel. Both the United States
 and Western Europe have placed restrictions on
 imports of some Chinese products-including tex-
 tiles and consumer goods-forcing Beijing to
 search for alternative markets.
 The use of Soviet capital equipment, machinery,
 and technical assistance-in addition to raw mate-
 rials-will also prove beneficial to Beijing. The
 Chinese have apparently decided that, for some of
 those factories built originally with Soviet help, it is
 cheaper to modernize using Soviet equipment. Al-
 though this equipment may not be as technological-
 ly advanced as that available from the West, it will
 still improve industrial performance. The Chinese
 probably also believe that for a number of new
 projects-primarily energy-the Soviets can pro-
 vide technology that is as good as in the West and
 without the expenditure of hard currency.
 Given these incentives, we believe the annual trade
 turnover goal of $3.5 billion by 1990 is possible.
 Nonetheless, even this level by 1990 would still
 probably represent less than 5 percent of each
 country's total trade.
 Although trade levels under the agreement will be
 a function of bilateral political ties, transportation
 problems may be the principal long-term impedi-
 ment. Even now, rail transport is so tight on both
 sides that many products are shipped by sea. Port
 congestion in both China and the Soviet Union,
 however, has also slowed deliveries. China is build-
 ing new port capacity to alleviate seagoing freight
 delays, but planned improvements to the rail sys-
 tem in both countries are not likely to be sufficient
 to eliminate major problems

 $150-200 million. Further negotiations await final Soviet funding approval
 which is not likely before late this year.                        each US
 firm could produce the rigs at its own plants or through licensees in Canada,
 France, Italy, Finland, or Japan. The decision to limit the competition to US
 and Canadian firms probably reflects Soviet recognition that rigs made from
 US-designed components are the world's best. If the Soviets opt for a US firm,
 they may still insist that the rigs be manufactured outside the United States as
 a precaution against US trade restrictions. US companies may also prefer to
 produce abroad because of lower manufacturing costs and access to foreign
 export credits.

 complete payments on arrears from the 1981 agreement, and to make interest
 payments on the rescheduled debt. Poland is unlikely to cover more than half
 of the $900 million due to governments if it continues to give priority to
 imports and payments to bank creditors. The Poles probably will demand new
 trade credits in the bilateral negotiations, but Western governments are
 unlikely to commit more than minimum amounts, at best. If Poland fails to
 pay, the Paris Club may demand a new private rescheduling that provides for
 equal treatment of creditors.
 IMF Postpones          Morocco's efforts to secure $300 million in IMF loans collapsed last week. The

 agreement with the London Club, large arrears on official debt to Paris Club
 members, and poor performance on meeting IMF guidelines this year
 prompted the Fund's decision to postpone new assistance until at least
 September. Recent promises of large-scale aid from Saudi Arabia and Libya
 may be a factor in Rabat's intransigence as well as the favorable terms
 Morocco enjoys by prolonging the 1983 short-term credit and rescheduling
 arrangements,                                  The problems with the  25X1
 IMF preclude any progress on urgently needed debt rescheduling for 1985 and

 cuts in the 1985 budget of up to $100 million are being considered to trim bor-
 rowing needs. The US Embassy says the government has not yet approached
 the IMF for financial assistance or help with debt rescheduling, but a
 continued oil market slump makes such a move likely by the end of 1986. The
 current domestic political situation, however, probably will cause officials to
 focus on short-term financial juggling rather than on long-term debt planning
 and on the difficult choices in subsidies as well as economic liberalization-

 Uruguay's Preliminary  The four-month-old Sanguinetti government is counting on an IMF package to

 ing Director de Larosiere has recently given tentative approval to an 18-
 month, $120 million standby arrangement in which Montevideo pledged to
 bring its fiscal deficit down from 10 to 6 percent of GDP, to lower inflation to
 60 percent from the current 78 percent, and to maintain a floating exchange
 rate. We believe that the IMF package is required to keep Uruguay's
 financing gap manageable. Based on government estimates, capital inflows
 will total 30 percent less then the projected $110 million current account
 deficit through December. To cover, the gap, Montevideo is approaching its
 foreign commercial banks-which recently agreed to roll over, principal
 repayments until the end of September-for $130 million in new money, but
 negotiations have yet to begin in earnest. With foreign exchange reserves
 virtually exhausted, Montevideo will need to keep a tight lid on imports to re-
 main current on obligations.

 and said it would accept a higher limit if Japan substantially increases its
 investment in Canada. Tokyo, however, agreed only to avoid disrupting the
 Canadian market and views anything up to 22 percent as meeting this
 condition. As a result of Honda's decision, other Japanese automakers are
 pressing Tokyo to seek a limit higher than 18 percent in the final agreement.
 The others are unhappy at the prospect of Honda increasing its Canadian
 market share-which it can do because the US-built Honda cars will not count
 against the quota. Meanwhile, to make up for the US-built cars sent to
 Canada, Honda apparently plans to ship more Japanese-produced cars to the
 United States now that Tokyo has eased its US voluntary restraints. We
 believe the final outcome likely will involve an increase in the quota on
 Japanese cars in return for a Japanese pledge to modestly boost investment in
 Canada.

 ing Canada as a test market before beginning exports to the United States, has
 seen its Canadian sales soar 270 percent in first half 1985, as compared with
 the year-earlier period. South Korea is now behind only Japan in the Canadian
 auto market with a nearly 6-percent market share. The Canadian Motor
 Vehicle Manufacturer's Association has suggested Ottawa is avoiding action
 because it does not want to jeopardize attempts to sell South Korea a nuclear
 reactor. Canadian Finance Department officials stress South Korea's willing-
 ness to purchase Canadian auto parts, and especially Hyundai's decision to
 build a parts plant in Canada, as factors behind Ottawa's decision to delay tar-
 iff applications. Canada's resistance to demands to restrict Korean imports
 may also reflect the success of Seoul's extensive lobbying of prominent Tory
 politicians.

 Economic Summits       summits are no longer "fruitful exchanges of views" and that he sees no reason
 for France to participate unless they change. Mitterrand's threat that he will
 not attend the Tokyo summit next spring is not an idle one. He found the Bonn
 summit-where he was generally isolated and seen as unwilling to compro-
 mise-particularly distasteful, but he has been complaining for several years
 that summits have become too structured and overly orchestrated. Mitterrand
 wants more emphasis on exchanging views rather than on winning consensus.
 If the Socialists lose the legislative elections next spring, it will leave him
 without a mandate and increase the likelihood he will stay home.
 Italian Government     Italy's five-party coalition government is reviewing its policies with debate
 Review Focuses         expected to focus on economic problems, particularly the rapidly growing
 on Economy             public-sector deficit. Last week, Rome raised its 1985 budget deficit forecast
 by $5 billion to $60 billion-16 percent of estimated GDP-largely because of
 higher unemployment compensation and use of the wage supplement fund. So
 far, Prime Minister Craxi has been unable to win coalition agreement on
 cutting the deficit, and discussions at the policy review are likely to be divisive.
 Treasury Minister Goria, a Christian Democrat, has called for new taxes to
 make up the expected revenue shortfall. On the other hand, Republican
 Finance Minister Visentini, supported by the Socialists and Social Democrats,
 insists that spending must be cut before new taxes can be considered. Craxi an-
 ticipates a compromise which may include some new indirect tax measures.
 The outcome of the debate will help to determine which portfolios are changed
 in the widely anticipated cabinet shuffle later this summer-and will also have
 a major influence on the longer run stability of the coalition.
 Cut in British         Leading British commercial banks lowered their base interest rates to 12
 Interest Rates         percent on Monday, the lowest level since the height of the pound crisis in Jan-
 uary. The banks followed the lead of the Bank of England, which had made a
 one-half point cut in its money market dealing rate a few days earlier. The cut
 came as a surprise to many British forecasters who had assumed that excessive
 money supply growth would prevent any reduction in interest rates. London-
 although pleased with sterling's recovery against the dollar-apparently
 became concerned that the parallel surge against the West German mark
 would threaten export competitiveness. The government also hoped to appease
 industry leaders, who recently blamed Thatcher's economic policies for
 damaging the recovery and demanded an immediate 2-point reduction in
 interest rates. Although industry lobbies and worried or dissident Tories will
 continue to press the government to make further cuts in interest rates,
 London's overriding concern with inflation makes substantial reductions
 unlikely.

 employment. The accord eliminates wage indexation through September;
 instead it awards employees lump-sum payments less than their usual cost-of-
 living adjustments. The press reports that the wage talks succeeded in part
 because the 14.9-percent inflation rate in June was far below what labor had
 expected. The agreement is a political face saver for Prime Minister Peres and
 Histadrut leader Kessar, but it is not likely to solve Israel's economic woes.
 The government realizes that it needs to implement the rest of the austerity
 program it adopted on 1 July-particularly the budget cuts-and eventually
 supplement the program with additional tax and monetary reforms. Peres's
 latest compromise, however, may weaken his hand in future talks.

 Economy in Trouble     in June reached 22 percent at an annual rate-compared with 9 percent a year
 earlier. The data also show that economic growth has steadily declined during
 the last 12 months-the economy actually contracting by 1 percent in first
 quarter 1985, as a result of a major shakeout in manufacturing and farming
 and a tight monetary policy in the face of rising prices. Nevertheless, unions
 are setting the stage for a showdown with the government by demanding
 immediate 15- to 20-percent cost-of-living increases. Wellington has pledged
 not to award any wage increases until the next round of negotiations in
 September-and then to grant only moderate pay hikes in order to promote in-
 dustrial restructuring.

 Deadlocked on          to the USSR emerged from the Soviet-Egyptian economic talks in Cairo last
 Military Debt          week,                                 in a week of discussions, the two  25X1
 sides were unable to agree on the debt's size or on whether to apply Cairo's
 trade surplus funds, now frozen in Moscow, to repayment. Moscow reportedly
 rejected out-of-hand Cairo's argument that the size of the debt ought to be re-
 duced by the amount Egypt spent on reproducing Soviet spare parts after the
 arms cutoff in the mid-1970s and by the rapid depreciation of the equipment.
 The Egyptians told the US Embassy that the dispute is delaying implementa-
 tion of the trade protocol agreed on in May. Major progress was probably not
 achievable; even so Cairo proved to be more uncompromising than expected. It
 is clearly unwilling to sacrifice on thorny economic issues for the sake of
 improving overall relations. When the talks resume, probably this autumn, the
 USSR's desire for closer ties may lead it to consider Cairo's proposal that the
 frozen trade surplus be used to modernize Soviet-built plants in Egypt. While
 Moscow may allow a small amount for this pur ose, it robably will demand
 that most be used to liquidate the military debt~                     25X1

 Shell Petroleum after it postponed oil drilling in light of current economic and
 political instability. Shell-the only multinational now exploring for oil in
 Bolivia-stands to lose its $22 million investment. In addition, the government
 also nationalized the 38-percent US-owned Totoral Mine, the largest tin mine
 in Bolivia, alleging fraudulent activities. We believe Siles's moves will worsen
 the economy's downward spiral. Current operations would be paralyzed as
 foreign managers leave and access to technology and essential imports is cut.
 The next administration would also find it more difficult to attract the foreign
 investment necessary for economic reconstruction.

 demand for copper-which accounts for nearly half of export earnings-
 caused Finance Minister Buchi to reduce the trade surplus projection by 30
 percent to $700 million. To encourage export diversification, the US Embassy
 reports that Santiago is proposing legislation to provide direct incentives to
 export industries-including a 10-percent export rebate scheme, increased
 export financing, and new export insurance facilities. The Pinochet govern-
 ment is drafting this legislation carefully to avoid violating GATT rules
 against export subsidies. Although Santiago advocates free market policies, we
 believe these proposals indicate a growing state role in directing economic
 activity.

 Chromite Deposits      Deposits of chromite ore on the southwest coast of Greenland have been
 in Greenland           opened to development, according to Embassy reporting. Although extensive
 drilling and core sampling will be required to determine ore quality, a
 Canadian mining firm, Greenex, will soon receive a nonexclusive prospecting
 license for chromite and other minerals in the region. The Danish Government
 said it would welcome interest by US mining firms as well. If exploitable, these
 deposits could provide a new, more reliable source of supply for this strategic
 mineral. The United States presently depends on imports for about 80 percent
 of its chromite needs-with half coming from South Africa. Currently, South
 Africa and the USSR provide over 50 percent of world production, and
 southern Africa holds 99 percent of the world's known reserves.

 Liberalization         products represents only a small concession in its highly publicized plan to
 liberalize its trade barriers. The move follows a February 1985 decision which
 freed some 5,000 textile and agricultural products from the same import
 license requirement. The impact of these moves will likely be minimal, given
 the extent to which remaining tariff and nontariff barriers continue to restrict
 imports. Taiwan's trade surplus for the first half of 1985 was about $5 billion.
 Soviet Interest in.    A Soviet trade organization has placed a tentative order with a Japanese

 for 7,000 to 10,000 units will be evaluated for their suitability. The USSR is
 also interested in obtaining TV monitors and printers but would develop its
 own software. The Politburo recently endorsed an ambitious computer literacy
 program with the long-range goal of placing 10 million computers in schools.
 Limitations in their own industry are forcing the Soviets to purchase foreign
 computers, at least initially. The computers involved are similar to the Apple
 II and are not under COCOM controls. A purchase of this size would be
 unusual, however, and Moscow may be holding out the promise of a major pur-
 chase to obtain computer production technology or plants-a gambit it has
 used with other Western companies.                                 25X1

 and controls. The plant, completed in 1976, incorporated US technology and
 some US equipment. The momentum generated by the recent Joint Commer-
 cial Commission meeting and the upcoming summit in November appears to
 have improved the commercial environment for US firms. This is the first
 sizable Soviet order of US chemical equipment since 1982. Moscow probably
 views it as a test of US commitment to expanded nonstrategic trade. The firm
 expects to obtain a US export license within two weeks.

 China Cuts Number of   Last week State Councilor Gu Mu told
 Open Cities            that Beijing had decided to cut from 14 to four the number of coastal cities
 opened last year under regulations favoring foreign investment. The decision
 probably was made at a conference held in late June of mayors of coastal cit-
 ies. Gu-one of the main architects of the open cities policy-said financial
 controls will be reimposed on the 10 smaller cities. Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian,
 and Guangzhou will remain open cities. The decision to modify the policy,
 which has been closely identified with top leader Deng Xiaoping, probably was
 made under pressure from conservative leaders, who have increasingly criti-
 cized corruption, waste, and inefficiency in the open cities. The reduction-
 part of an overall retrenchment in the economy-probably represents Deng's
 decision to cut his losses as he prepares for a major party conference in
 September. Recent press articles praising the general policy of opening to the
 outside world and the fact that Beijing is pushing ahead with controversial
 wage reforms indicate that the reformers are determined to keep the basic
 program on track.
 China's New Japanese   China has arranged to borrow $2 billion from a syndicate of Japanese banks-
 Commercial Credit                         led by the Bank of Tokyo-to finance some of the development projects in its
 Seventh Five-Year Plan, 1986-90. The loans, which will carry an interest rate
 of only 0.25 to 0.375 percentage point over the London Interbank Rate and a
 10-year repayment period, can be drawn on for the next five years. This line of
 credit replaces a $2 billion arrangement negotiated with Japanese commercial
 banks in 1979 that expired unused last month. China is reportedly also seeking
 a $2 billion line of credit from Japan's Ex-Im Bank to finance electric power
 projects. The Chinese probably will continue to avoid using commercial credit
 lines until all available concessional financing is exhausted. They are currently
 seeking several billion dollars in export credits from West Germany, the
 United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada, and Austria, in addition to those
 from Japan. The Chinese may buy as much as $50 billion worth of capital
 goods during the next five-year plan, of which perhaps $10 billion will be
 financed with long-term loans. Nevertheless, China will have no problems
 servicing its debt, which currently stands at only about $6 billion.
