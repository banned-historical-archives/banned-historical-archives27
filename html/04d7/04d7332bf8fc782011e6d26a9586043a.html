 The North Vietnamese divisions are getting closer to
 Saigon. In two critical areas--Xuan Loc to the east and
 Tan An to the southwest--the communists have kept the
 pressure on government defenses while sending additional
 forces past to new positions between the cities and Sai-
 gon.              while the South Vietnamese have been extracting the
 remaining defenders from Xuan Loc, for example, North
 Vietnamese regiments have driven toward Bien Hoa city.
 This city's main defense units--two brigades of marines
 which escaped from Da Nang--are newly regrouped and suf-
 fering from very poor discipline.  They are not expected
 to stand and fight.  The nearby Long Binh supply depot
 contains about 60 percent of all government munitions.
 The loss of Bien Hoa city and the air base and supply
 depot is likely to lead to the rapid collapse of other
 government forces.
 To the northwest, remaining South Vietnamese 25th
 Division battalions have been pulled out of Tay Ninh city
 to blocking positions closer to Saigon.   The North Viet-
 namese 9th Division is swinging around the southern flank
 of the 25th to threaten Saigon's western perimeter.
 Southwest of the capital, the North Vietnamese have
 moved additional forces up from the delta to challenge
 the main defenses of Long An Province directly, and
 other communist regiments are sweeping north of this
 action to approach the southwestern outskirts of Saigon.
 The communists are also moving five sapper regiments
 into the Saigon area to disrupt government control, ter-
 rorize the population, and guide North Vietnamese regu-
 lars into the metropolitan area.

 Saigon no longer has any reserve forces available
 to help defend the city.  The Joint General Staff does
 not consider it practical to attempt to bring any of its
 units deep in the delta closer to Saigon.
 Communist forces have taken Phan Thiet and Ham Tan,
 and are continuing their drive down the coast toward
 Vung Tau.  They will probably capture that lightly de-
 fended port within a few days.
 The communists appear to be ruling out any consid-
 eration of a genuine negotiated settlement of the con-
 flict.  At a press conference in Saigon Saturday, the
 Viet Cong's spokesman carefully avoided mention of ne-
 gotiations with the present government or even a recon-
 stituted one such as they had been demanding.   Instead,
 he reiterated the Viet Cong's position of March 21 which
 called for the overthrow of Thieu and the immediate sus-
 pension of all US support as the only two preconditions
 which could bring about a "rapid settlement."
 On the government side, however, President Thieu
 still shows every sign of intending to stay in office.

 Despite Thieu's tough public stand, South Vietnamese
 opposition elements apparently are still trying to work
 behind the scenes to form a new government that could
 lead to negotiations with the communists.  Catholic op-
 position leader Tran Huu Thanh, retired general Duong
 Van "Big" Minh,  former Senate chairman Nguyen Van Huyen,
 and Buddhist opposition leader Senator Vu Van Mau plan
 to issue a joint proclamation on April 23 demanding the
 immediate resignation of President Thieu and calling for
 the formation of a "national leadership council."  The
 new council would be headed by the same four leaders
 with a cabinet composed two thirds of "rightists"--pre-
 sumably military officers and others closely identified
 with the present government--and one third of "leftists"--
 presumably elements represented by the four opposition
 leaders.
 The hazy plan of action for the proposed new govern-
 ment appears to consist of immediate negotiations with
 the communists and establishment of the National Council
 of Reconciliation and Concord called for in the Paris
 Accords.   Under the opposition scenario, the "leftist"
 faction of the government would concentrate on political
 competition with the communists within the Council, while
 the "rightist" faction would attempt to stabilize the
 military situation in what remains of South Vietnam's
 territory.

 LATIN AMERICA
 April 21, 1975
 Secretary Kissinger's trip to the region this week
 and the OAS General Assembly meetings next month are
 focusing Latin American attention again on the state of
 inter-American affairs.   At the same time, events in
 Indochina have provided a peg for a new round of Latin
 commentary on broad aspects of US policy.
 While attitudes range from close identification with
 the US to antipathy, ,a common thread among the Latins is
 discomfort over the need to adjust to a new US view of
 the world.   US positions on a variety of international
 topics have been interpreted as tougher toward the non-
 aligned and less benevolent toward friendly governments.
 A few Latin governments,  including Venezuela, Argentina,
 and Brazil, harbor some hope that reverses in Asia will
 turn US attention closer to home.   Most seem to fear that
 current problems in the Far East will make Washington
 less flexible in other areas.
 In Brazil, some officials are expressing apprehension
 over the reliability of the US as an ally.   Thus, govern-
 ment leaders will be particularly interested in exploring
 with Secretary Kissinger how events in Southeast Asia will
 affect Brazil's close relationship with the US.
 Concern over reverberations from Indochina is high-
 est in Latin countries that feel themselves embattled
 in an anticommunist struggle.   Chile, for example, feels
 increasingly isolated in its effort to eliminate Allende's
 Marxist influence there.   Events in Indochina, taken to-
 gether with the removal of Santiago from Secretary Kissin-
 ger's itinerary, have lowered US prestige and made Chile
 feel that its best option is to strengthen ties with neigh-
 bors in Latin America.
 Uruguayans question the value of their long loyalty
 to and cooperation with the US when the Secretary of
 State plans to visit Buenos Aires, capital of an osten-
 sibly nonaligned government, but not Montevideo.   They
 view detente as an unwise accommodation to the communists
 and deplore Washington's change of heart about Cuba and
 Indochina.

 Panama's unique relationship with the US has raised
 grave fear over the political fallout from the Indochina
 situation.   Panamanians speculate that US public opinion,
 weary of setbacks, will not tolerate yielding the Canal
 Zone to Panama.
 Elsewhere in the hemisphere, US attention to Asia
 has fortified the view that Latin America continues to
 have very low priority in US thinking.  Few seem to ex-
 pect that Secretary Kissinger's travels to Argentina,
 Brazil, and Venezuela or the OAS meetings will restore
 the sense of rejuvenation that permeated inter-American
 events last spring.   That enthusiasm has withered with
 the successive failures to find common ground on numerous
 economic issues, with the abortive effort to end sanc-
 tions against Cuba, with official revelations about US
 actions in Chile, and with growing discord in interna-
 tional forums between the US and the less developed
 world.

 April 21, 1975
 The failure of the Central Committee plenum of
 April 16 to fill the vacant post of party secretary for
 propaganda and culture indicates that the unsettled at-
 mosphere in cultural affairs evident during the past
 several months is persisting.  As a result of candidate
 Politburo member Petr Demichev's appointment to the gov-
 ernment post of minister of culture, he was relieved of
 his long-time responsibilities for culture on the party
 secretariat at a Central Committee plenum last December.
 When the leadership failed at that time to name a
 successor to the party post, there were signs of inde-
 cision--and possibly even deadlock--not only on whom to
 choose, but also on the future course of cultural policy
 in an era of detente.  Now that another plenum has passed
 without dealing with these problems, it is likely that
 cultural policy and the selection of Demichev's successor
 will become a part of the political maneuvering within
 the party hierarchy in advance of the CPSU congress
 scheduled for February 1976.
 So far, the leadership's stopgap solution has been
 to parcel out Demichev's former secretariat responsibil-
 ities among several incumbent secretaries, and also to
 act collectively at times when the intervention of the
 party secretary for culture is normally called for.   In
 terms of policy, a pragmatic carrot-and-stick approach
 has been evident in some sectors and immobility and
 drift in others.  The public drumbeat on cultural issues,
 however, has tended toward a reiteration of generally
 hard, doctrinaire positions.
 The latest example of collective responsibility in
 cultural affairs and of public policy orthodoxy was the
 joint meeting in Moscow of Soviet "creative" unions on
 April 15.   It was attended by seven of the nine party
 secretaries--only Brezhnev and party secretary for agri-
 culture Kulakov were absent.  Although Demichev, who
 also attended t4e meeting, was legitimately present in

 his capacity as minister of culture and candidate Polit-
 buro member, he was nevertheless conspicuous as the only
 leader present who was not also a party secretary.   This
 may strengthen speculation among some Soviet intellec-
 tuals that the vacuum in the party's cultural post has
 enabled Demichev to exercise more of a say in cultural
 affairs than is customary for a minister of culture.
 The joint meeting of the cultural unions, devoted
 to preparations for the 30th anniversary of the end of
 World War II in Europe, took the opportunity to restate
 the commitment of the Soviet cultural establishment to
 the party and its program by "praising the heroism of
 the Soviet people during the war and philosophically
 assessing its result."  The main speaker, head of the
 writers' union board Georgy Markov, never strayed from
 standard, orthodox positions.   None of the party lead-
 ers present delivered a speech.
 Markov, who is also a full member of the Central
 Committee, was among the speakers at the CPSU plenum the
 following day.  None of the speeches at the plenum has
 been published, but Markov's role evidently was to re-
 assure the political leadership that present controls
 over culture are adequate to maintain the status quo, at
 least until the leadership decides on where to go from

 ISRAEL
 April 21, 1975
 Prime Minister Rabin focused on the state of US-
 Israeli relations in a lengthy interview published Friday
 in Israel's largest daily.   His remarks were apparently
 intended for Washington as well as for his domestic
 audience.
 Rabin was plainly attempting to calm widespread
 fears in Israel that relations with the US have danger-
 ously deteriorated in the wake of the suspension of in-
 direct talks with Egypt last month.  He also served no-
 tice on the US that Tel Aviv believes there is little
 hope for further progress in negotiations with the Arabs
 until the "rough edges" in bilateral relations have been
 smoothed over.
 Rabin said that Foreign Minister Allon will try to
 obtain from Secretary Kissinger during their meeting to-
 day a reading on the implications for Israel of Washin -
 ton's policy reassessment.
 Rabin again denied, as he did in his speech on
 April 16 commemorating Israel's 27th anniversary, that
 the problem with the US was more than one of a difference
 of opinion.. He urged Israelis to remain sensible and
 calm in dealing with it.
 Defense Minister Peres, however, has openly labeled
 US-Israeli relations as in a state of "crisis."   Rabin
 too, despite his public efforts to play down the matter,
 is worried.  This is reflected in his candid outline of a
 two-pronged government effort to improve Israel's position
 in the US.   The first task, which he deemed of "utmost"
 importance, is to conduct a detailed and full-fledged
 information campaign in the US to convince the American
 people that last month's indirect talks with Egypt broke
 off as a result of Egyptian inflexibility, despite Israeli
 willingness to compromise.

 The other part of the effort, Rabin said, is directed
 at prominent members of the US administration and the
 Congress.   Israel, he continued, must confront them over
 the content and position of the US in "every sphere" of
 Washington's relations with Israel, while displaying a
 firm stand of its own.   This stand, he said, will have a
 "decisive" influence on determinin   the outcome of Wash-
 ington's policy reassessment.

 USSR-SOMALIA
 April 21, 1975
 Although the power struggle in Somalia last month
 resulted in the "confinement" of several pro-Soviet
 figures,  including Defense Minister Samantar, the upshot
 seems to be that the Soviets are still firmly entrenched
 and Samantar is back on the job.
 Speaking at the Somali army's 15th anniversary fes-
 tivities last week, Samantar blasted "Western propaganda"
 that implied Somalia is a Soviet satellite.  The ceremony
 had some of the trappings common in Eastern Europe; behind
 the dais a portrait of General Secretary Brezhnev was
 given equal prominence with President Siad's likeness.
 Moreover, the organizers managed to leave Yugoslav
 diplomats off the guest list.   There probably was a
 Soviet hand behind this omission,  although the Yugoslavs
 are in trouble with the Somalis because of signs that
 they are selling arms to Ethiopia.
 The Soviets are not counting solely on Siad or
 Samantar to maintain their assets in Somalia.   They have

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 April 21, 1975
 The limits of Prague's toleration of dissidence will
 probably be spelled out this week at a plenum of the
 party's Central Committee.
 In the speech on Wednesday,  in which he condemned
 Alexander Dubcek, party boss Husak announced that the
 Central Committee will "examine certain proposals in the
 sphere of social policy" that will constitute an "impor-
 tant step for a great section of the population."
 Minister of Interior Obzina,  in a speech the next
 day, picked up Husak's lead and warned that the security
 forces would do everything "immediately and resolutely"
 to suppress illegal activities of domestic reactionary
 groups and individuals, although without using the police
 as a "tool of repression against the people as a whole."
 These remarks buttress Husak's warning that some dissi-
 dents had mistakenly interpreted his avoidance of "ad-
 ministrative methods"--arrests and executions--as weak-
 ness.
 The leadership has been debating the highly contro-
 versial question of how to deal with the 1968 reformers--
 andparticularly Dubcek--ever since Husak came to power
 six years ago.   The debate has sharpened considerably
 over the past six months, however,  and Husak's attack on
 Dubcek, after Dubcek's letter of last fall calling for a
 return to the rule of law was published recently in the
 West,  suggests that hardliners in the party are asserting
 themselves.
 This week's plenum, plus Dubcek's reaction to Husak's
 condemnation, will set the stage for action in Prague.
 Should Dubcek run true to form, he will refuse to go into
 exile; Husak has now drawn the line, and any retreat from
 his stand will risk deepening the divisions in the party.

 Finnish political observers now expect the current
 four-party coalition government to resign in early May,
 paving the way for an election on August 17-18.
 The Social Democrats and the Center Party--the major
 coalition partners--have set up a ministerial group in a
 last-minute effort to resolve persistent disagreements.
 In letters to leaders that were subsequently leaked to
 the press, President Kekkonen threatened earlier this
 month to dissolve parliament if coalition differences
 were not composed.
 Neither partner appears willing to make the neces-
 sary concessions, in part because opinion polls suggest
 both would improve their standing in parliament through
 a new election.  The Social Democrats do not relish an
 election in the vacation season, but are said to be only
 going through the motions of negotiating and to be re-
 signed to the fall of the government.
 Observers assume that Kekkonen will turn to Helsinki
 Mayor Aura to form a nonpolitical administration until
 a new coalition can be hammered out after the election.
 Aura, who led similar teams in 1970 and 1971-72, may
 therefore be in office when Finland hosts the European
 security conference's concluding summit meeting, which
 could take place in mid-summer.

 CHINA - NORTH KOREA
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping's speech at the wel-
 coming banquet for North Korean President Kim 11-song
 last Friday in Peking reflects the cautious approach the
 Chinese are currently taking toward problems on the
 Korean peninsula.
 Although Teng took a pro forma swipe at the US for
 "clinging to a two Koreas policy" and for failing to with-
 draw its troops from South Korea, his emphasis was strongly
 on "peaceful reunification" of the two Koreas.  Teng re-
 ferred three times to Chinese support for the "correct
 policy" of peaceful reunification, a policy he claimed
 had originated in Pyongyang.
 Kim was predictably harsher than Teng in describing
 the Korean situation, but did not go beyond his own pre-
 vious pronouncements..  He implied that either a war in-
 stigated by the South or a revolution there would result
 if US forces and the Pak government remained, and de-
 clared that Pyongyang would "not stand idly by" in either
 event.   He guaranteed a durable peace and subsequent re-
 unification by peaceful means if US forces withdrew and
 Pak were replaced.  Kim concluded that "everything" de-
 pended on the US attitude.
 Both Teng and Kim praised Prince Sihanouk's role
 in the Cambodian people's struggle for "liberation."
 They also singled out Sihanouk, whose presence at the
 banquet was featured, for post-speech toasts.  Coupled
 with the absence of any reference to other Cambodian
 insurgent leaders, this suggests that both Peking and
 Pyongyang are solidly in favor of an important role for
 Sihanouk in the new Cambodian government.
 Kim continues to receive an extremely warm and high-
 level welcome in Peking.   In addition to his meeting
 Friday with Mao, he has also met once with Premier Chou
 En-lai and twice with Teng.

 THAILAND - NORTH KOREA
 The Khukrit Pramot government has agreed to estab-
 lish diplomatic relations with North Korea.
 The decision, which comes at Pyongyang's initiative,
 is the first concrete step by the new government to im-
 prove relations with Asian communist regimes.  The two
 countries have exchanged sports teams and trade delega-
 tions in recent months.
 indeed, the decision was a relatively easy one; w i e
 the Thai are deeply suspicious of the intentions of Hanoi
 and Peking in Southeast Asia, they do not view Pyongyang
 as a potential threat to their security.
 Pyongyang views relations with Bangkok as another
 step forward in its diplomatic competition with Seoul
 and as beneficial to Pyongyang's side of the Korean ques-
 tion at the UN.  Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region,
 North Korea established relations with Malaysia in 1973
 and with Australia last year; it has maintained ties
 with Indonesia since the Sukarno era.
