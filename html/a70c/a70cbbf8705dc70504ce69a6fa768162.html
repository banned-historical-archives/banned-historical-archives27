 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                     17875
 [From the Washington Post, Aug. 7, 19641
 VIETNAM OF 1964 RECALLS KOREA OF 1960
 (By Marquis Childs)
 The really deep trouble in Vietnam lies
 outside the scope of American sea and air
 power.  The great question is whether the
 South Vietnamese Army has the will to go
 on fighting on the ground against Commu-
 nist guerrillas after 17 years of almost un-
 remitting warfare.
 Before the naval action in the Gulf of
 Tonkin, evidence was accumulating that war
 weariness and political dissension in Saigon
 had raised grave doubts about the future.
 Hints were coming from the military clique
 headed by  Gen.  Nguyen Khanh that the
 United States would have to take a much
 larger share of the burden, including even
 direct participation in combat.
 On the recommendation of Gen. Maxwell
 D. Taylor, the new Ambassador in Saigon,
 Washington moved to increase the number
 of American military advisers from 16,000 to
 22,000.  They were, it was reported, empow-
 ered to fire back if fired on.  No one can
 say whether this will be enough.
 At the same time, disturbing rumors have
 circulated in Saigon about a new coup to
 replace General Khanh.  If the worst should
 happen, the Johnson administration faces an
 awesome choice-sending in large numbers of
 American combat troops or expanding the
 war with massive bombing in the north.
 The risks in either course are incalculable.
 To get out, a third choice, seems impossible in
 view of what has gone before and in the
 light of politics in the presidential year.
 The beginning of the Korean war 14 years
 ago comes vividly to mi d.  The atmosphere
 then was very much what ,it is today.  Re-
 publicans  and  Democrats  were                        rallying
 around President Truman and promising him
 support   against  Communist   aggression.
 Robert A. Taft, minority leader in the Sen-
 ate, gave reluctant assent despite his strong
 isolationist convictions.  It was a moment of
 patriotic fervor in which Mr. Truman, by al-
 most unanimous opinion, emerged as a strong
 and decisive President.
 But that mood quickly altered.  As the
 woefully untrained  American  troops  that
 were rushed from Japan were pushed back
 almost off the Korean. Peninsula with fear-
 ful casualties, it became "Truman's war."
 By the  1952 campaign and the disaster
 resulting from the massive Chinese invasion,
 this was the chief line of Republican attack.
 General Eisenhower could say at the Uni-
 Ing the war has been based on a formula of
 neutralization that sounds like surrender.
 Three long-term consequences of a greatly
 enlarged war in Asia, if it comes to that, are
 unforeseeable.  The most important single
 event of the last 2 to 3 years has been the
 split between, the Soviet Union and China,
 with reverberations throughout the Commu-
 nist world.  In recent weeks that split has
 seemed to be irreconcilable.  It could be
 healed by a war between the United States
 and China. Expert opinion here is that Mos-
 cow would stop short with condemnation of
 American moves.
 But that is conjecture.  As often in the
 past, the most baffling and frustrating ele-
 ment in the new crisis is the enigma of Red
 China.  American policy has walled  off a
 nation of 600 or 700 million people and what
 goes on in  the fastness of Peiping is as
 mysterious as what may be happening on
 Mars.   That may have been inevitable after
 Korea.  But it is today a tragic commentary
 on the  darkness that cloaks the dubious
 future in Asia.
 [From a Milwaukee Journal editorial, Aug. 6,
 1964, as reported in the New York Times]
 APPEAL FOR RESTRAINT
 It may be that the North Vietnamese, with
 the backing of Communist China, were test-
 ing the American will.  If so, they have their
 answer.
 There is some danger that this country
 may tend to overreact to North Vietnamese
 stings  because  of  our  political  situation.
 President Johnson has been under attack for
 what opponents call a "no win" policy in
 southeast Asia.  He has been unwisely urged
 to escalate the war.
 Under such circumstances, a President can
 be handicapped in making vital decisions.
 President Johnson will  need courage  and
 patience and restraint to keep the Nation
 from the wider war that he-and all who
 realize what modern war is-wish to avoid.
 MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE
 A message from the House of Repre-
 sentatives, by Mr. Hackney, one of its
 reading  clerks,  announced  that  the
 House had passed a joint resolution (H.J.
 Res. 1145) to promote the maintenance
 of international peace and security in
 southeast Asia, in which it requested the
 concurrence of the Senate.
 versity  of  Illinois  that  Midwestern  farm
 boys should stay at home and let Asians fight
 Asians.                                 U MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL

 Yalu River.  He had shown mar
 out of concern that the war would be en-
 larged to a global scale.  He was damned
 from hell to breakfast for that restraint.
 There Is one important difference today.
 In 1950, Mr. Truman went to the United
 Nations  before 'responding  to  the  North
 Korean attack.  By a piece of luck, the Soviet
 delegate was absent, so that the Security
 Council could pass a resolution calling on the
 U.N. to join in resisting aggression.  This
 time the United States struck first.
 Except for the Communist nations, almost
 every U.N. member approved a joint defense
 of Korea.  Even neutralist India sent an am-
 bulance unit.  If a widened conflict develops
 in Vietnam, this country will find it hard to
 rally support.  It will have the look of a
 war waged by white men against Asians.
 This is, in effect, what President de Gaulle
 has been saying-that the war, as it is cur-
 rently being fought, cannot be won.  The
 French tried for nearly 7 years, beginning in
 1947, and they sacrificed the cream of St. Cyr,
 their West Point, in the vain effort. Un-
 happily, De Gaulle's prescription for end-
 The Senate resumed the consideration
 of the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 189) to
 promote the maintenance of interna-
 tional peace and security in southeast
 Asia.
 Mr. NELSON.  Mr. President, has my
 time expired?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 time of the Senator has expired.
 Mr. MORSE.   In fairness to the Sen-
 ator from Alaska, I cannot yield any
 more time.
 Mr. McNAMARA.   Mr. President, I
 suggest the asbence of a quorum, with
 the time not to be charged to either side.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator withhold that suggestion?
 Mr. McNAMARA.   I withhold it.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, a
 parliamentary inquiry.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Senator will state it.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Since the House
 has passed a joint resolution which I
 understand is identical to our resolution,
 by a vote of 414 to 0, with one Member
 voting present, and the House joint reso-
 lution has now been received by the Sen-
 ate, is it proper to ask unanimous con-
 sent to take up the House joint resolution
 and substitute it for the Senate joint
 resolution?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  It  is
 proper to ask unanimous consent to take
 up the House joint resolution, and to vote
 on the House joint resolution in lieu of
 the Senate joint resolution.
 Mr. MORSE.  Temporarily, I shall
 have to object. When the time has been
 exhausted; if the Senator wishes to re-
 new his request, I may not object.  I do
 not wish to sacrifice any more of our
 time.  I object.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Objec-
 tion is heard.
 Mr.  FULBRIGHT. Mr. President,
 how much time have I remaining?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Senator from Arkansas has 2 minutes
 remaining.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  What happened to
 my 7 minutes? Every time I inquire as
 to how much time I have left, the time
 goes down by 5 minutes. I-was not talk-
 ing on my time.  I was responding to a
 question by the Senator from Wisconsin.
 I did not yield myself any time to re-
 spond to the question.                                                                                        I do not see how
 I can possibly have used any time.
 The    PRESIDING OFFICER.  The
 Chair's statement as to the remaining
 time is based on what the Parliamentar-
 ian advises the Chair.
 Mr.   FULBRIGHT. Perhaps   his
 watch-
 The                                                                                                PRESIDING OFFICER.  All
 these discussions take a great deal of
 time.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  It depends on whose
 time it is.  The Senator from Arkansas
 did not yield any time.
 Mr. MORSE.  This is becoming ridic-
 ulous.  I ask unanimous consent that the
 agreement be extended for an additional
 10 minutes, with that time made avail-
 able to the Senator from Arkansas.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Is there
 objection?  The Chair hears none, and
 it is so ordered.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  I yield 1 minute to
 the Senator from Florida.
 Mr.  SMATHERS.  Mr.  President,  I
 voted for this resolution in the *Foreig'
 Relations Committee yesterday, -and "'
 expect to support it when we vote in the
 Senate today.
 In the committee I had the occasion
 to commend the Secretary of State Dean
 Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert Mc-
 Namara, the Chairman of the Joint
 Chiefs of Staff, General Wheeler, and-
 of course-the President of the United
 States, on the action which they took in
 response to the unprovoked, premedi-
 tated, and deliberate attacks made on
 our naval ships on the 2d of August and
 again on the night of the 4th of August.
 The facts are indisputable.  At the
 time of the first attack by the North
 Vietnamese PT boats on the U.S.S. Mad-
 dox on August 2, the U.S.S. Maddox was

 something in the neighborhood of 25 to
 30 miles offshore operating in interna-
 tional waters In the Gulf of Tonkin.
 According to the testimony, the com-
 mander of the U.S.S. Maddox had some
 information that this attack might de-
 velop and he was seeking to avoid any
 contact with the PT boats, yet they pur-
 sued and overtook him, firing torpedoes
 at his ship and subsequently coming
 alongside and strafing him with .50-call-
 ber machineguns.
 The U.S.S. Maddox returned the fire,
 damaging seriously one of the PT boats.
 It was shortly after this occasion that
 we were briefed by the Department of
 Defense as to Just what had transpired.
 Secretary McNamara told us of plans to
 continue to operate our naval ships in
 the international waters In the Gulf of
 Tonkin, and said that now the Presi-
 dent had given orders for the ships and
 men not only to defend themselves, but
 to shoot to destroy. It was shortly after
 these orders went out that we were called
 to the White House and told of the sec-
 ond attack by a host of North Vietnamese
 PT boats against not only the U.S.S.
 Maddox, but the destroyer C. Turner
 Joy which was operating in conjunction
 with the Maddox some 65 miles from the
 nearest coast.
 After all the facts were presented to us
 no responsible persons could arrive at
 any other conclusion than that the at-
 tacks were deliberate and intended to be
 provocative. When the President told us
 of his orders in response to the attack,
 it was agreed by all those present that
 our retaliation was appropriate.  It was
 decisive; It was thorough; it was quick,
 and yet it was restrained and it was
 measured. The punishment fit the crime.
 By such action the President of the
 United States made it clear that the
 United States was not going to have its
 ships, its men, or its flag, shot at or
 attacked anywhere in the world where
 we had a legal right to be without quick
 and decisive response.  This action Is,
 figuratively speaking, language which the
 Communists understand. If they made a
 miscalculation with respect to whether
 or not the United States was in truth
 and in fact, as their propaganda had in-
 sisted, a "paper tiger," they no longer
 suffer from such disillusionment.  They
 now know for a certainty that we will
 respond totally and completely if neces-
 sary, to any unwarranted action they
 niay take against us.
 They now understand that we are con-
 cerned in southeast Asia through our
 membership in the SEATO Organization;
 and that our commitments there are
 totally concerned with protecting the
 newly independent countries of south-
 east Asia and assisting them in achieving
 freedom and democracy.  They now
 know that we are not going to be bluffed
 or bullied out of our commitments to
 our friends and allies in that area of the
 world.
 I. along with others, approved of this
 action by the President of the United
 States because I believe it signifies a
 long needed change in policy.  it, in
 effect, states that there will never again
 be a haven behind which the Communists
 can hide after they have made attacks
 on us, such as existed in Korea, north of
 the 38th parallel.
 If we should  become involved  In
 stepped-up military action in the Asiatic
 theater, and we of course hope and pray
 that we do not, but if we do, the Com-
 munists must understand that there will
 be no sanctuary from which their mili-
 tary forces can operate with Impunity.
 I hope and trust that those who would
 make these momentous decisions for the
 Communist world,  would  understand
 that the policy has changed.
 Mr. President, I shall not delay the
 Senate longer.  I am sure each Senator
 has his mind already made up.  I am
 certain that a vast majority of Members
 of Congress on both sides of the aisle
 stand wholeheartedly behind this action
 taken by the President of the United
 States.
 I am certain that every Member of the
 United States Congress who votes for
 this resolution recognizes that if we do
 not make such response-as we d'd in this
 recent instance against the North Viet-
 namese-there will be other more seri-
 ous aggressions against us, and others in
 the free world.  And the time would
 come when we would be forced out of in-
 ternational waters, and forced to retreat
 and run from our friends and allies
 around the face of the globe.  This reso-
 lution makes it clear that we stand be-
 hind the President in a firm resolve to
 give whatever is required in time, sub-
 stance, money or lives to the protection
 of those ideals of freedom which we hold
 so dear and for which this Nation has so
 long stood.  I feel that each Senator
 who supports this resolution recognizes
 that in being true to our heritage we
 have no other course.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  I yield 5 minutes
 to the Senator from Illinois.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.    Mr. President, last
 night I read in one of the local news-
 papers a speculative article which un-
 dertook to give this subject something
 of a partisan cast. One of the expres-
 sions used was, "The President has done
 It again." That Is an unfortunate spec-
 ulation, because that was not involved
 in any of the discussions we have had
 about the Joint resolution.
 I attended the briefing at the White
 House.   It lasted for almost an hour
 and a half. The whole case was laid on
 the table by the President, by the
 cto      of  the  Central   Intelligence
 Agency, by the Secretary o      Defense,
 an  7y the Secretary of State.    There-
 after, there was no limit on the amount
 of discussion or on the questions that
 any member of the joint leadership
 from both the House and Senate might
 have wished to propound, whether they
 were addressed to the Secretaries or to
 the President.
 When the meeting was over, we dis-
 cussed the content of a resolution, with
 the understanding that the resolution
 could be modified and simplified, if that
 were necessary or deemed desirable.
 That was the whole story.
 Before we left the Cabinet room, the
 President asked every Member who was
 present whether he would give support
 to the resolution.  Every Member re-
 sponded. I am rather proud of the fact
 August 7
 that every Republican who responded
 said that, speaking for himself and,
 hopefully, for the party, he would sup-
 port the President in his determination
 to meet the crisis now before us in the
 South Pacific.
 This is in line with every policy state-
 ment that the minority policy committee
 and the minority party have made with
 respect to foreign affairs. We have con-
 stantly emphasized that all we ask, when
 a decision is pending or a crisis is upon
 us, is to be consulted, to have an op-
 portunity to offer al:ernative proposals
 and substitutes. When we have had our
 day in court and the decision has been
 made, we are prepared to abide by the
 decision and to demonstrate to the whole
 wide world that there is no division be-
 tween the Executive and Congress in re-
 pelling aggression aimed at our forces
 wherever  we are under protocol or
 treaty obligations. We have religiously
 adhered to that posture and that policy
 ever since.
 The President could have taken this
 action in his own right as the Com-
 mander in Chief.  He does not have to
 ask Congress about ,he deployment of
 troops, submarines, bombers, and fighter
 planes.
 What is involved Is a demonstration
 that  the executive  and  legislative
 branches of the Government stand to-
 gether in an hour of need and threat,
 and when there is peril In a section of
 the world that could easily jeopardize
 the entire free world.
 I wished to make clear how the minori-
 ty stands, and how it stood in that brief-
 ing session, and also when this subject
 was before the various committeesof the
 Senate and House.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, I
 yield myself 5 minutes.
 I wish to affirm what the distinguished
 minority leader has said.  I was present
 at the briefings.  There was not the
 slightest indication of' any kind of par-
 tisanship in any sense.                                                                                                         Back through
 the years, when similar resolutions have
 been under consideration, this has also
 been true.  It was true when there was
 a Republican administration.
 I cannot resist paying a compliment to
 the distinguished Senator from Illinois
 [Mr. DIRKSENI.   While on certain mat-
 ters he is a great partisan leader, never-
 theless, on all matter,3 affecting the se-
 curity of this country, matters which are
 comparable to this kind of situation, I
 have never seen him :)e partisan, either
 on the fl or or off the floor of the Senate.
 He always rises above partisanship in
 deaFng with problems that directly in-
 volve our security ant' reserves his par-
 t'.sanship, as all of us do, for less pro-
 found subjects than those which threat-
 en the security of our country.  This is,
 of course, normal and demonstrates the
 distinction between foreign relations and
 domestic relations.
 I did not see any such article as that
 to which the Senator from Illinois has
 referred; but if there %as such an article,
 it was entirely in error, because there
 was no partisanship, and none Is involved
 in th_s measure.
 Now I wash to say a word or two about
 the House joint resolution.  It passed

 the House by a vote of 414 to 0. I do not
 believe that in a democracy unanimity is
 always necessary.  Certainly, it is not
 necessary when we are dealing with mat-
 ters of substance involving domestic leg-
 islation, or even legislation dealing with
 foreign relations. However, in the ex-
 pression of an advisory opinion of broad
 policy, which this resolution is, it is a
 happy and fortunate circumstance if
 there can be a high degree of unanimity.
 So I am much pleased by the House ac-
 tion.  I hope the Senate will approach
 that unanimity, if possible.
 I realize that we all have our appre-
 hensions about what may happen in
 South Vietnam or elsewhere.  But fun-
 damentally, under our system, it is the
 President, as our representative in these
 activities, who must necessarily have the
 dominant role, however jealous we may
 be of our own privileges-and we rightly
 should be in many areas. But in dealing
 with the Nation's security or with threat-
 ened warfare, we must rely to a great
 extent on the decisions of the Executive.
 We always have a reserve power, when
 we see that the President has made a
 mistake.  We can always later impeach
 him, if we like, if we believe that he has
 so far departed from the sense of duty
 that he has betrayed the interests of our
 country.
 But essentially the joint resolution is
 an exhibition of solidarity in regard to
 the will and determination of this coun-
 try as a whole, as represented in Con-
 gress, to support the broad policies that
 have been well announced and well de-
 scribed in the words of the President,
 both recently and in past months.  We
 are exhibiting a desire to support those
 policies. That will have a strong psycho-
 logical  effect  upon  our               adversaries,
 wherever they may be.
 I believe the joint resolution is cal-
 culated to prevent the spread of the war,
 rather than to spread it, as has been
 alleged by some critics of the resolution.
 I have considered every possible alterna-
 tive, both those that have been suggested
 on the floor of the Senate and elsewhere,
 and I still have come back to my own
 conclusion that the action that was
 taken; the resistance that was made in
 the Gulf of Tonkin; the joint resolution
 adopted in committee; and all our ac-
 tions in this connection, are best de-
 signed to contribute to the deterrence of
 the spread of war.
 No one knows, in this uncertain world,
 whether the war will spread.  It could
 easily spread because of the determina-
 tion of our adversaries, in spite of any-
 thing we might do. But I sincerely be-
 lieve that this action, taken with such
 general support by both Houses of Con-
 gress, will result in deterring any ambi-
 tions or reckless adventuresome spirit on
 the part of the North Vietnamese or the
 Communist Chinese. So I ask and hope
 that Members of this body will support
 the joint resolution.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed at this point in my
 remarks certain editorials relating to
 this subject.
 There being no objection, the editorials
 were ordered to be printed in the REC-
 ORD, as follows:

 INTENTIONS IN THE GULF OF TONKIN
 Whatever the Vietcong attack on the U.S.
 destroyer Maddox may mean about Com-
 munist intentions in southeast Asia, the de-
 cisive response it sparked both aboard the
 warship and in the White House underscores
 the clear American intention to stick by its
 commitments in that troubled area.
 While  viewing  the  incident  as  serious,
 U.S. officials were not sure what it portends.
 It might have been a hapless joy ride un-
 dertaken by a trio of thrill-seeking patrol
 boat jockeys. It might have been a tactical
 maneuver, a planned one-shot probe to test
 U.S. reflexes in a sensitive location.  It might
 have been the opening gambit in a drive to
 insulate coastal supply lines between mili-
 tarily important Luichow Peninsula of Red
 China and North Vietnam.  Or it might have
 been a political play to forestall pending divi-
 sion in the Communist ranks by increasing
 tensions in a vital area of conflict between
 East and West.
 Against  this  range  of  possibilities,  the
 U.S. response was. at once appropriate and
 cautious.    The   Maddox's     counteraction
 against the three attacking torpedo boats and
 President Johnson's shoot to kill order illus-
 trate the importance the United States at-
 taches to continuance of patrols in the Gulf
 of Tonkin.   That waterway has significant
 strategic importance as a line of supply for
 men and material in support of guerrilla ac-
 tivities in South Vietnam.  And it offers the
 readiest access for assault on supply links
 into North Vietnam.
 Orders to bolster and defend the naval
 positions there seem to mean that the United
 States intends to stay right on the job.
 [From the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch,
 Aug. 6, 19641
 THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
 If the ghost of John Foster Dulles were
 lurking in the wings of the world stage at
 this climactic moment, he would smile grimly
 to see his policy of brinkmanship imple-
 mented by the very liberals who denounced
 his basic premise; namely, that the United
 States must dare to go the very brink of
 war in order to halt the expansion of Red
 imperialism.
 President Johnson's statements of the past
 2 days revealed the deep reluctance of the
 United States to risk a major war.  But he
 paraphrased Dulles' contention when he said
 that "aggression unchallenged is aggression
 unleashed."
 It is reassuring to learn that our NATO
 and SEATO allies, with the tentative excep-
 tion of France, agree that the instant re-
 taliation ordered by Mr. Johnson was un-
 avoidable.  Yet they expressed hope that Red
 China will realize the futility of provoking
 a military showdown certain to occur, should
 Peiping decide to overrun southeast Asia.
 Whether she will do so depends to a great
 extent  on whether  Moscow  considers  the
 time propitious to revert to Stalinism, throw
 in her lot with Red China, and shoot the
 works in a desperate gamble to destroy West-
 ern capitalism and clear the track for a Com-
 munist takeover of the globe.
 Moscow's temptation to do so cannot be
 dismissed, but it is highly doubtful that
 Khrushchev-and  Mao,  for  that matter-
 would risk counterrevolutions.  The peoples
 of East and West equally dread a nuclear
 war that would exterminate millions and, in
 all likelihood, condemn survivors to a pain-
 ful, lingering death on a nuclear-contami-
 nated planet.
 For the time being, Moscow has worded its
 comments obliquely.  Tass, as the Kremlin's
 mouthpiece, has stated that competent So-
 viet circles resolutely denounced the U.S. re-
 taliatory attack on North Vietnam as abso-
 lutely unjustified.  Under the circumstances
 some such gesture was to be expected.  It is
 to Moscow's advantage to retain at least a
 perfunctory alliance with Peiping, if only to
 keep the West off balance, and Russian nu-
 clear weaponry as a bargaining counter in
 negotiations over Berlin, Cuba, and her Euro-
 pean satellites.
 "Truth is the first casualty," in any war, as
 history has redundantly proved.  The North
 Vietnamese propagandists claim that our re-
 port of a second attack on U.S. destroyers
 was a fabrication.  Peiping's New China News
 Agency denounced Johnson's order to bomb
 North Vietnam bases as a move to enhance
 his position in the forthcoming presidential
 election.
 Both claims are palpably false; the first,
 because the approach of North Vietnam's tor-
 pedo boats within range of the Maddox and
 Joy proved their intention to invite return
 fire; the second, because the President's de-
 cision to attack North Vietnam naval bases
 was approved by leaders of both parties and
 by Senator GOLDWATER, Mr. Johnson's oppo-
 nent in the November elections.
 As the President said yesterday, at Syra-
 cuse,  in this crisis-"We are one Nation,
 united and indivisible."
 [From  the  Atlanta   (Ga.)   Constitution,
 Aug. 4, 1964]
 POLITICAL MATURITY  AS WELL   AS OUR  NAVY
 ARE TESTED IN TROUBLED ASIAN WATERS
 The unprovoked North Vietnamese attack
 on the American destroyer Maddox was a
 test both of our naval preparedness and the
 maturity of our diplomatic judgment.
 Happily, we came through both tests with
 flying colors.
 The Maddox herself was undamaged, but
 she and Navy jets scored hits on two of the
 PT marauders.  The third was stopped cold.
 Diplomatically, we forcefully restated our
 position in  southeast Asia,  and President
 Johnson backed it  up  with  orders for a
 beefed-up Navy force.
 But the President, for the time being at
 least, declined to let the incident trigger car-
 rying the war into North Vietnam.
 The difficulties of conducting a wise for-
 eign policy and a presidential election at the
 same time are well illustrated by the inci-
 dent.  After repeated sniping from the why-
 not-victory crowd, the President must have
 been tempted to order direct retaliation on
 North Vietnam.  But because of the delicate
 involvement of Vietnam in the entire south-
 east  Asia problem,  Mr.  Johnson exercised
 restraint.
 The time may indeed come when there is
 no honorable alternative to retaliation on
 North  Vietnam's  land bases.   We  should
 never fail to make that clear to the Com-
 munists.
 In the meantime, however, President John-
 son and the Navy have made our position
 plain :
 U.S. ships have a right to sail in interna-
 tional waters.  They will defend that right
 with immediate return of fire against any
 attacking vessel.
 North Vietnamese are probing America for
 any signs of weakness and dissension during
 this political year.  It is to be hoped that
 none of our homegrown politicians give the
 Reds any comfort with scatterbrained pro-
 posals.

 fore with U.S. ships In International waters
 or U.S. planes In free skies will be met with
 retaliatory blows of equal promptness and
 severity.
 As the President made plain In both his
 address to the Nation Tuesday night and his
 talk at Syracuse University on Wednesday,
 the United States seeks no enlargement of
 the conflict.  But this Nation Is united In Its
 belief that, in Mr. Johnson's words, "there
 can be no peace by aggression and no immu-
 nity from reply."
 We Americans have also the solemn com-
 pulsion to face the fact that the Commu-
 nists, by their attack on American vessels In
 international waters, have themselves esca-
 lated the hostilities-an escalation we must
 meet.  Thus the struggle in southeast Asia
 inevitably will become deadlier.  At least now
 the cause is clear and we know what we are
 doing and why we do it.
 The motives behind North Vietnam's delib-
 erately aggressive acts are for the moment
 obscure.  It must have been clear to both
 Hanoi  and  Peiping  that shooting  at U.S.
 ships would not frighten the 7th Fleet out of
 Tonkin Gulf.  Nor, it should have been equal-
 ly clear, would these acts be permitted to go
 unpunished.
 The destruction of Red antiaircraft bat-
 teries in Laos 2 months ago after U.S. planes
 were shot at should have been ample proof
 of this.
 Perhaps the North Vietnamese and Chi-
 nese were counting on U.S. retaliation as a
 lever to force greater Soviet commitment to
 the Communist side, in the belief that re-
 gardless of doctrinal differences the Russians
 would stand with their fellow Communists in
 the event of a showdown with the United
 S ,ates.
 Perhaps the attacks were part of an overall
 strategic  plan,  timed  to  coincide  with
 stepped-up ground activities In South Vlet-
 nam.
 Or perhaps the intent was simply to gain a
 propaganda victory by a quick humiliation
 of vaunted U.S. seapower.
 In any case the North Vietnamese chal-
 lenge has been answered, and the United
 Skates has shown that any further attempt
 to escalate the conflict will Indeed result In
 what North Vietnam has called grave con-
 sequences.
 The Communists may believe that domes-
 tic U.S. policies precludes our taking effec-
 tive  action  in southeast Asia.   They  are
 wrong.    Senator   GOLDWATER's statement
 Tuesday night and the response in Congress
 have shown that, as the President noted,
 "there are no parties-and there is no par-
 tisanship-when our peace or the peace of
 the world Is imperiled by aggressors In any
 part of the world."
 The crisis continues, and in the days ahead
 may intensify.   U.S. strength in  the area
 is being increased, a further earnest of our
 intentions to challenge any aggression.  As
 the quickly mounted, multipronged strikes
 against the North Vietnamese naval installa-
 tlona proved, the United States has the power
 as well as the will to destroy selective tar-
 gets on a controlled basis.   Whether that
 power will be again used is very much up
 to the Communists.
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star,
 Aug. 4. 19641
 SHOOT To DESTROY
 It is difficult to understand why the North
 Vietnamese would want to provide a clash
 with the U.S. 7th Fleet.
 In any such encounter the odds would be
 overwhelmingly against the attackers.  They
 have no naval force which would stand a
 chance in a sea engagement, and if they were
 to damage or sink a U.S. ship on the high
 seas this would amount to an engraved in-
 vitation for a counterattack against North
 Vietnam.
 The fact remains, however, that three PT
 boats did attack the destroyer Maddox while
 the latter was on patrol In the Gulf of Ton-
 kin, and there seems no doubt that the Com-
 munist ships came out of a North Vietnam-
 ese base.
 In these circumstances, the President's re-
 sponse, It seems to us, has been apropriate.
 He has Instructed the Navy to continue Its
 patrols in the gulf, to add another destroyer
 to the patrol, to maintain fighter plane cover
 over the destroyers, and, most Significantly,
 to shoot with a view to destroying any at-
 tacking force.  This last reflects a major pol-
 lcy change since previous Instructions to the
 Maddox had been to defend Itself if attacked,
 but not necessarily to destroy the attacker.
 It seems unlikely that Hanoi, In the face
 of these beefed-up defensive measures, will
 permit any further attacks on American ships
 steaming in International waters.  If the con-
 trary should prove to be the case, however,
 the North Vietnamese would be solely re-
 sponsible for the consequences-and we hope
 the  consequences.  If  need  for  retaliation
 arises. will be severe.
 [From the Now York (N.Y.) Times]
 WARNING  TO  HANOI
 President Johnson's response to the North
 Vietnamese attack on the destroyer Maddox
 contained the right mixture of firmness and
 restraint.  No reprisals are being undertaken.
 But a   strong  diplomatic  protest Is  being
 combined with military measures that should
 discourage Hanoi from further attacks,     if
 any are planned.  American naval forces in
 the Tonkin Gulf area are being strengthened.
 And they now have orders to destroy any
 forces that attack them, rather than merely
 to drive them off.
 Tt must be hoped that this first attack
 by North Vietnam on the U.S. 7th Fleet was
 an error.  South Vietnam's small naval forces
 have staged a number of raids on the North
 Vietnam coast.  One theory In Washington
 is that the American destroyer, as seen on
 North  Vietnamese  radar,  may  have  been
 taken for a similar South Vietnamese ship.
 Another  theory is that the  Incident may
 simply have been the trigger-happy response
 of a North Vietnamese patrol, or its com-
 mand, to an encounter with an American
 vessel near coastal waters.  There have been
 other recent indications of North Vietnamese
 nervousness, following talk In Saigon of ex-
 tending the war.
 But the possibility cannot be excluded that
 the torpedo boat strike was intended to be
 the first of a series designed, perhaps, to test
 Washington's determinationto continue aid-
 Ing Saigon.  If that be the case, It is essen-
 tial that Hanoi realize Immediately that it
 has opened a Pandora's box.
 North Vietnam's capability of Injuring the
 7th Fleet is small.  The power of the 7th
 Fleet to damage North Vietnam is Incalcul-
 able.  Since this must be evident, nothing is
 more vital than for Hanoi to be left In no
 doubt about the American intention to re-
 main In the Tonkin Gulf and to continue
 supporting South Vietnam's military effort.
 The President's action should convey this
 message clearly.
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Post]
 SOBER RrsPoNSz
 The administration has responded with a
 reassuring blend of firmness and balance to
 North  Vietnam's  attack  on the  destroyer
 Maddox.             President Johnson reaffirmed the
 shoot-back orders which had led the Mad-
 dox to return the fire of the three Viet-
 namese torpedo boats, and he beefed up the
 7th Fleet patrol in the International waters
 off the Vietnamese coast.  At the same time
 he directed that a protest be made through
 one of the indirect channels available to
 this country in the absence of formal rela-
 tions with Hanoi.
 This sequence, no less than the calmness
 with which it was undertaken, should leave
 no doubt In Hanoi's mind about the inten-
 tion of the United State,; to claim and exer-
 eise  Its  right  to  cruise  In  international
 waters and to defend itself against any fur-
 ther  unprovoked attacks.   The President's
 actions should also leave no doubt that the
 United States is determined to use its great
 power wisely, to husband its strength unless
 and until there is appropriate military and
 political occasion for its employment, and
 to  avoid  being  tricked  or  provoked  into
 imprudence.
 Naturally, it will be asked if the American
 reaction was adequate to the needs of the
 situation. These    needs  are, in our view,
 limited:  the protection of American ships
 and men and the discou?agement of further
 attacks.   Premier Khanh of South Vietnam
 feels the United States -must also aet so as
 not to appear a "paper ti?ter." One can guess
 that others, perhaps thinking of different
 ends than morale in South Vietnam, will join
 him in extending the list of needs which
 require satisfaction.
 There is nothing sacred about the Presi-
 dent's restraint, to be sure, but we feel it
 was tailored well to tht; specific challenge
 and that It leaves the United States in a
 strong  position, politically and diplomati-
 cally, to take more drastic action later if
 that should become necessary.  In our view,
 it  was sensible  to treat the attack as   a
 single  incident or uncertain purpose,   and
 not as the deliberate start of a campaign
 to tease the American  Navy or provoke a
 David-Goliath     confrontation   with   the
 mighty 7th Fleet.  Hanio's persistent efforts
 to pry the United States out of the Vietnam
 conflict argue against the latter view.  The
 Communists  must  also consider  that    the
 advantages which    accrce to guerrillas  on
 land are  largely  lacking to maruaders by
 sea.
 The dif i silty of reading Hanoi's mind on
 this score is enhanced by the peculiar half-
 light of signal  and security which shines
 on. but falls to illuminate, many moves by
 both sides In Vietnam.  Of all the moves so
 lighted, those connected with proposals to
 carry the war to the North are the most deli-
 cate.  Over the weekend the North charged
 that two Islands had been shelled by Ameri-
 can and South Vietnamese ships and that a
 border village had been bit from the air by
 American planes crossirg over from Laos.
 These accusations  were promptly rebutted
 by American officials, but they contribute to
 the atmosphere of danger and ambiguity
 that enshrouds the attack on the Maddox.
 [From the Baltimore  (Md.)  Sun, Aug.  4,
 19641
 ON WARNING
 When the news of the North Vietnamese
 attack on the U.S.S. Maddox was flashed back
 to Washington early Suniay the administra-
 tion decided to play the affair in low key.
 That posture was deliberate and studied.  At
 home nerves already are on edge, and In
 southeast Asia tension is a standard com-
 ponent of the atmosphere.  Because the raid
 on  the  patrolling  destroyer  was repulsed
 without American casualty, there was noth-
 ing to be gained from turning it into an emo-
 tional production.                                                                                                                                       The news was made pub-
 lic In an announcement, exemplary for its
 restraint, and in subsequent discussion the
 administration portrayed the attack as an in-
 cident of minor consequence.
 There Is a danger in such caution.  It con-
 ceivably  could  encourage  a  rash                                                                                                                                       enemy,
 thwarted once, to try again. If the North
 Vietnamese or any of their allies had found
 the American reaction deceptive, and had
 thought of new adventures, the President's
 fresh Instructions to the Navy must make
 the prospect singularly unattractive.  The
 White House has ordered the patrols in the
 Approved For Release 2004/11/29 : CIA-RDP66B00403R000200070008-3
 1964
 Gulf of Tonkin to be continued with air
 cover and in doubled strength, and the Navy
 is directed to destroy any attacking force.
 In the future there can be no doubt as to
 the response.
 The presence of American warships off the
 Communist coast is necessary to the defense
 of South Vietnam. It is a surveillance opera-
 tion designed to detect any unusual move-
 ment of troops or supplies and to prevent
 any sudden Communist push.  It is a per-
 fectly legal patrol, and American ships have
 as much right to be there as in the high
 seas off Hampton Roads.  No ship in inter-
 national waters can be expected to endure
 attack without reprisal, and the Communists
 have been put on formal notice that Amer-
 ican reprisal will be swift and devastating.

 MAO FACING WAR-OR-PEACE CHOICE IN SOUTH-
 EAST Asia
 For the second time in less than 2 years
 the United States-and perhaps the world-
 stands on the brink of major war.
 Now, as in October 1962, there Is no need
 to talk of national unity or national deter-
 mination.  These we have in full measure.
 All the political leaders who have so re-
 cently been engaged in partisan strife, from
 Senator  BARRY  GOLDWATER  on  down, have
 thrown their Support to the President with-
 out hesitation in a critical hour.  Congress
 is speedily backing his hand.
 Ugly as they are, the Mississippi murders,
 the northern race riots and the growing bit-
 terness between races and between political
 factions, all these have been suddenly thrust
 into the shadows by gunfire and bomb bursts
 in the Far East.
 We wait and watch while the deployment
 and use of vast destructive powers move to-
 ward a showdown, link by link.
 The chain began with an incident which,
 in a tactical sense, would scarcely have rated
 mention in the annals of World War II.
 North Vietnamese patrol boats made torpedo
 attacks on the Maddox, a 7th Fleet destroyer
 on solitary and lonely patrol In the Gulf of
 Tonkin off North Vietnam,  The Maddox ac-
 quitted itself well, and with the help of
 naval aircraft, damaged and drove off the
 attacking craft.
 President Johnson responded with the kind
 of caution which is imperative in world lead-
 ers in the nuclear age.  He issued a warning
 and ordered air and surface reinforcements to
 the scene.  It was barely possible that the
 attack had not been authorized by the gov-
 ernment of Ho Chi Minh.
 Tuesday a new flash came, and all doubt
 Was blasted away. The Maddox, the destroy-
 er C. Turner Joy and supporting aircraft had
 fought off another attack, sinking two enemy
 boats and damaging two.
 In every capital of the world, all lingering
 questions about timidity or excessive re-
 straint were answered by President Johnson's
 response.  The punishing air attack which
 he ordered against the coastal installations
 of  North  Vietnam  constituted  but  one
 thing-a heavy punch on the nose of Asian
 Communists.
 But as the President stated, it was a "lim-
 ited and fitting" response.               While force was
 met with superior counterforce, the options
 for broadening the conflict now rest in the
 lap of Mao Tze-tung, the real originator of
 Communist aggression in southeast Asia.

 destructive war is almost certain to come
 with any new Communist aggression.
 [From the Los Angeles (Calif.) Times,
 Aug. 6, 19641
 U.S. ANSWER TO AGGRESSION
 The U.S. response to what President John-
 son called deliberate and unprovoked attacks
 on American destroyers in the Gulf of Ton-
 kin was fitting in selectivity, proper in ap-
 plication and-given the clear, long-stand-
 ing statement of U.S. intentions-inevitable
 in delivery.
 There is not the slightest doubt that fur-
 ther attempts by the Communists to inter-
 fere with U.S. ships in international waters
 or U.S. planes in free skies will be met with
 retaliatory blows of equal promptness and
 severity.
 As the President made plain in both his
 address to the nation Tuesday night and
 his talk at Syracuse University on Wednes-
 day, the United States seeks no enlargement
 of the conflict.  But this Nation is united in
 its belief that, in Mr. Johnson's words, "there
 can be no peace by aggression and no im-
 munity from reply."
 We Americans have also the solemn com-
 pulsion to face the fact that the Commu-
 nists, by their attack on American vessels in
 international waters, have themselves esca-
 lated the hostilities-an escalation we must
 meet.  Thus the struggle In southeast Asia
 inevitably will become deadlier.  At least
 now the cause is clear and we know what we
 are doing and why we do it.
 The motives behind North Vietnam's delib-
 erately aggressive acts are for the moment
 obscure.  It must have been clear to both
 Hanoi and Peiping that shooting at U.S.
 ships would not frighten the 7th Fleet out of
 Tonkin    Gulf.   Nor,  it should  have  been
 equally clear, would these acts be permitted
 to go unpunished.
 The destruction of Red antiaircraft bat-
 teries in Laos 2 months ago after U.S. planes
 were shot at should have been ample proof
 of this.
 Perhaps the North Vietnamese and Chi-
 nese were counting on U.S. retaliation as a
 lever to force a greater Soviet commitment
 to the Communist side, in the belief that
 regardless of doctrinal differences the Rus-
 sians would stand with their fellow Commu-
 nists In the event of a showdown with the
 United States.
 Perhaps the attacks were part of an overall
 strategic  plan,  timed  to  coincide  with
 stepped-up ground activities in South Viet-
 nam.
 Or perhaps the intent was simply to gain
 a propaganda victory by a quick humiliation
 of vaunted U.S. seapower.
 In any case the North Vietnamese chal-
 lenge has been answered, and the United
 States has shown that any further attempt
 to escalate the conflict will indeed result in
 what North Vietnam has called "grave con-
 sequences."
 The Communists may believe that do-
 mestic -U.S. politics precludes our taking
 effective action in southwest Asia.  They are
 wrong.   Senator   GOLDWATER's   statement
 Tuesday night and the response in Congress
 have shown that, as the President noted,
 "there are no parties-and there is no par-
 tisanship-when our peace or the peace of
 the world is imperiled by aggressors in any
 part of the world."
 The crisis continues, and in the days ahead
 may intensify.  U.S. strength in the area is
 being increased, a further earnest of our in-
 tensions to challenge any aggression.  As the
 quickly  mounted,  multipronged strikes
 against the North Vietnamese naval installa-
 tions proved, the United States has the power
 as well as the will to destroy selective tar-
 gets on a controlled basis.  Whether that
 power will be again used is very much up to
 the Communists.

 Ms. STEVENSON  SPEAKS von AMERICA
 Ambassador Adial E. Stevenson's calm and
 lucid discussion before the United Nations
 yesterday of    Communist torpedo attacks
 upon American warships off the coasts of
 North Vietnam provided the American peo-
 ple with an understanding of the crisis in
 southeast Asia which, until he spoke, had
 been sadly lacking.
 President Johnson, in his address to the
 Nation Tuesday night and in his speech yes-
 terday at Syracuse University, had asked
 unity in support of American firmness.  He
 is more likely to get it now that Mr. Steven-
 son has stated the facts and explored the
 Communist motives.
 As our spokesman told the U.N. Security
 Council, the attacks by North Vietnamese
 patrol  torpedo  boats  in  internatioanl
 waters-the first 30 miles offshore and the
 second  more  than  80-were  senseless  in
 themselves,  But, said Mr. Stevenson, taken
 as part of a larger pattern, they disclosed
 a relentless determination by the Commu-
 nists to subjugate the whole of the area by
 terror and force.
 In this enterprise, he emphasized, the Ho
 Chi Minh regime in Hanoi could not be con-
 sidered to be acting alone.  It was teamed
 up with and supported by Communist China
 in a systematic violation of the Geneva ac-
 cord of 1954 which was supposed to guaran-
 tee the peace of the countries which for-
 merely composed French Indochina.
 Mr. Stevenson said that these aggressors
 must be taught that their criminal mthods
 would not pay.  He said that the American
 reprisal air raids against Communist torpedo
 boat flotillas, their bases, and their oil depots
 were limited in intention, designed to cor-
 rect the mistaken Communist impression
 that the United States would hold still for
 any brazen act of piracy.
 if Peiping and Hanoi get the message and
 put into practice the agreements to which
 they are honorbound under the Geneva ac-
 cord, the Ambassador said, southeast Asia
 could look forward to peace.  But not until
 there are visible proofs that the Communists
 intend to cease their aggressions on land and
 sea and leave their neighbors in peace would
 the United States find it possible to withdraw
 its forces from that part of the world.
 Mr.  Stevenson  repeated  what  President
 Johnson had said-that the United States
 does not want any wider war.  He went be-
 yond that to say that the United States does
 not want war at all, and there would be no
 war in southeast Asia If the Communists, in
 violation of their Geneva pledges, were not
 making it.
 The Russian spokesman, who followed Mr.
 Stevenson, made the usual Soviet effort to
 befog the issue by calling for an appearance
 by North Vietnam before the Council.  That
 country is not even a member of the United
 Nations, and the only purpose would be to
 fill the air with propaganda.
 We have felt all along that the American
 people will support the policy of this or any
 other administration as long as they know
 what it is and what is at stake.  Until now,
 the administration has created most of its
 difficulties in winning public confidence by
 its own failure to deal honestly with the
 people.
 When  Its  Pentagon spokesman has de-
 clared the existence of a policy of "news man-
 agement" and has spoken of news as "weap-
 onry" available to the President, adding that
 is the right of a government "to lie to save
 itself," it is hardly inviting the confidence
 of the people.
 Mr. Stevenson has put Communist piratical
 acts and the systematic campaign to con-
 quer South Vietnam and Laos in clear per-
 spective.  His unadorned recital of what has
 happened and is happening in southeast
 Asia will go a long Way toward persuading

 the people that they now are informed about

 (From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 6, 1964]
 THE  PRESIDENT'S  DECIBION
 Everyone hopes  the            President's  decisive
 move In ordering limited retaliation against
 North Vietnam will cause the Communists
 to abandon their forays In the Gulf of Ton-
 kin and perhaps rethink their Whole War
 effort.  Yet, decisive though this U.S. re-
 action was, an aura of Indecisiveness still
 clouds Important questions on both sides of
 the struggle.
 While Communist intentions can only be
 a matter of speculation, it may be that the
 Reds' own uncertainty about how far to push
 the war inspired the attacks on the 7th Fleet.
 At least it seems reasonable to interpret the
 attacks as a probing action designed to gage
 the American response; for a long time no
 one could be sure how strongly the United
 States would prosecute the defense of South
 Vietnam.  Now the Communists have part of
 the answer, though what they will make of
 it Is something else again.
 It is possible Communist China and its
 allies have decided now Is the time for a
 showdown with the United States, but their
 own past behavior suggests otherwise.  They
 did not push Korea to the bitter end.  They
 did not mount an all-out attack on Taiwan.
 They  did not  pursue  the  harassment   of
 Quemoy and Matsu to the point of major
 hostilities.
 In Vietnam itself, of course, the Red tactic
 has been guerrilla warfare-Incessant probes
 for weakness, if you like-rather than fron-
 tal assaults, and so far there has been rela-
 tively little evidence of direct Chinese par-
 ticipation.  Since this type of warfare has
 been increasingly successful  for  them.  It
 seems likely they will continue to stop it up
 despite their stern rebuff  In  the Gulf of
 Tonkin.
 That prospect leads us to the remaining
 areas of uncertainty about the U.S. position.
 It seems beyond doubt that the Govern-
 ment has decided to stay in Vietnam.  It
 seems  further  that  a  decision  has been
 reached to make a stronger stand-advo-
 cated, perhaps not so incidentally, by Sen-
 ator  GOLDWATER1.                           Even before  this week's
 naval engagements, It was planned to beet
 up the American forces in South Vietnam.
 But if the war aim is to rid South Viet-
 nam of the Communists once and for all,
 how it is to be accomplished?   It certainly
 is not being accomplished now.  Will It be
 necessary to intervene in much greater force
 and finally take over the direction of the
 war from the Vietnamese generals?
 Anything along that line faces serious ob-
 stacles.  Those generals are jealous of their
 prerogatives.  The political instability in Sal-
 gon Is so bad that talk to heard of yet another
 coup. Many of the people are far from dedi-
 cated to the fight against communism and
 indeed an  undetermined  number  in  the
 countryside are evidently sympathetic to the
 Communist Vietcong guerrillas.
 Even if it is possible to extirpate the Com-
 nnunists with  a  major  undertaking,  It is
 difficult to see how future infiltration could
 be prevented. At any rate, it would seem to
 require a very large force to seal off the vari-
 ous and fluid borders, and the force might
 have to remain indefinitely, as in Korea.
 Perhaps the Pentagon has effective an-
 swers to all these questions, but our Viet-
 namese involvement to date does not lend
 much support to that hope.  Indeed, the
 history of that involvement has been marked
 by indecisiveness and confusion. The United
 states has drifted deeper and deeper into
 the war, without even appearing to know
 how to achieve its aims or always knowing
 what the alms were.
 For some time, however, the course of
 events has itself narrowed the range of in-
 decision.  That is, the failure of small-scale
 "advisory" action has led to progressively
 fuller participation and mounting American
 casualties until now we are at the point of
 limited action against North Vietnam.  Un-
 less the Communists are deterred by that, it
 seems only too probable that the process w Ill
 continue until we are committed to doing all
 that Is necessary to get the Communists out.
 Whatever actually happens, it is regret-
 table the United States Is once again so en-
 meshed in so unpromising a venture.  Yet we
 have gone so far that there appears no ac-
 ceptable alternative.  And If the President's
 order means the Government is at last on
 the road to firmness and decisiveness, it may
 be the best hope the circumstances offer.

 BACKLASH IN   TONKIN GULF
 The  North        Vietnam Reds on  Tuesday
 mounted their second PT boat attack on U.B.
 warships In the Gulf of Tonkin.
 Thereupon, President Lyndon B. Johnson
 remembered that he is a Texan, or gave a
 thought to Senator BARRY GOLDWATER's re-
 peated "Why not victory?" cracks, or both.
 Anyway,  the President ordered our Far
 East air and sea forces to backlash fittingly
 at the North Vietnam Reds,
 Our men carried out this assignment yes-
 terday, superbly.
 U.S. naval aircraft destroyed or damaged
 25 North Vietnamese PT boats, hashed up 5
 torpedo bases, and wrecked the big oil stor-
 age depot at Vtnh, in North Vietnam.
 Cost to us: two planes and their pilots,
 may they rest In peace.
 Unless the North Vietnamese take some
 more pokes at us. this backlash will he our
 last, according to present plans.  The Presi-
 dent said we want no wider war, in his dra-
 matic TV-radio address to the Nation late
 Tuei:day night.
 The great majority of Americans, we be-
 lieve, heartily approve all this; and we think
 Congress should endorse It after adequate
 debate.
 And it is reassuring  to see our Far East
 forces get set for whatever may grow out of
 the episode.
 North Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh is
 obviously hopping mad over this unexpected
 singe dealt by us to his wispy whiskers.  He
 may try to get hunk: Red China may try to
 help him.
 Both  of  the  Communist        governments'
 press and radio mouthpieces are making big
 talk about how they will soon be coming
 around to get revenge for yesterday's U.S. air
 strikes.
 In that event, It may be our heaven-sent
 good fortune to liquidate not only Ho Chi
 Minh but Mao Tse-tung's Red mob at Pei-
 ping as well, presumably with an important
 assist from Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
 and his Nationalist Chinese forces on Taiwan

 "WE ARE ONE NATION, UNrrED AND INDIVISIBLE"
 In the short but calmly strong address in
 Syracuse, President Johnson restated this
 country's simple formula for the restoration
 of peace in southeast Asia.  He also made it
 abundantly clear that in the current crisis.
 there are no parties and no partisanship
 dividing the American people.
 What Mr. Johnson offered as a formula for
 peace in southeast Asia Is essentially the same
 formula to which President Eisenhower and
 the late President Kennedy dedicated their
 efforts: the governments in that part ofthe
 globe ought to follow international agree-
 ments already supposed to prevail.
 The President urged the governments there
 to leave each other alone, to settle their
 "August 7
 differences peacefully, and to "devote their
 talents to bettering the life of their peoples
 by working against poverty and disease and
 Ignorance."  "Peace requires that the exist-
 ing agreements In the area be honored."
 "To any who may be tempted to support
 or to widen the present aggression" by North
 Vietnam, he said, "I say this.  There is no
 threat to any peaceful power from the United
 States, but there car be no peace by aggres-
 sion and no immunity from reply.  That is
 what is meant by the action" taken by the
 Navy.
 Having made plain "to the people of all
 nations" the reasons for this Nation's course
 of action In recent days, the President made
 it equally plain that. for Americans, this is
 no time for politicking with crisis.   Con-
 gressional support of the President yesterday
 dramatized this fact.
 "Let no friend needlessly fear and no foe
 vainly hope that this Is a nation divided in
 this political year," he said.  "Our free elec-
 tions-our full and free debate-are Amer-
 lea's  strengths,  not  America's  weaknesses
 * ? '   We are one nation, united and in-
 divisible; united :,nd Indivisible we shall re-
 ma In."
 There was strength of purpose and calm-
 ness of language in    the President's brief
 message.   But  there also was clarity and
 eloquence. There will be plenty to debate In
 the coming campaign, but in the face of sav-
 age threat to "our peace and the peace of the
 world," there Is solid national unity.

 Ac roN IN THE EAST
 President Johnson has acted with appro-
 priate firmness and dispatch In ordering
 retaliatory action against North Vietnam for
 Its attacks on U.S. naval vessels on the high
 seas.
 There is no doubt the overwhelming senti-
 ment of the Nation is behind him.  This was
 swiftly expresed In terms of bipartisan con-
 gressional support and included a special
 statement from Senator BARRY  GOLDWATER.
 The salient fact of this grave development
 in the Far East is this : the Comunists have
 changed the ground rules of the continuing
 struggle in the Far East--and now cannot un-
 change them.  Nor should the United States,
 In its show of firmness, seek to unchange
 them.
 Before the attack by North Vietnamese tor-
 pedo boats on American destroyers patroling
 the Gulf of Tonkin, the "rules" were clear.
 They specified that North Vietnam was a
 supplier of men and arms to Red guerrillas
 In South Vietnam.  They specified that the
 United States would train and advise the
 forces  of  South  Vietnam  in  operations
 against those guerrillas
 Now the North Vietnamese Government, or
 perhaps the Peiping Government, has ap-
 parently decided on a broader confrontation.
 The manipulators have t.hus forced the Unit-
 ed States to raise its own sights, too.  And
 It is too early to foresee the consequences of
 this sudden escalation of war In the Far
 East.
 However, now that oil:' sights are thus ad-
 justed, perhaps the Issue of quelling Commu-
 nist imperialism In the area is closer at hand
 than before.  Perhaps now the vast power
 of the United States wtl' be brought to bear
 to enforce peace In the :Ear East.
 The aim of the Unitec States in its blows
 against North Vietnam is not to spread con-
 flict and not to engage in a major war, nor
 should It be.
 The aim Is peace-peace instead of unpro-
 voked assault on the high seas, peace Instead
 of armed attempts to overthrow legitimate
 governmentsand peace instead of the outlaw
 behavior of regimes contemptuous  of the
 fate of millions.

 The right response
 Whoever planned the torpedo-boat attacks,
 for whatever purpose, stand warned.  If they
 were probing the intentions of the United
 States, of Red China, of the Soviet Union,
 they at least know that the United States
 will resist aggression, and that it has the
 capability of doing so.
 The controlled impact of the American
 counterblow  has  clearly  made  its  impact
 on the world.  From its friends this coun-
 try has received such congratulations as that
 of Japan (very directly concerned with the
 problem of Communist expansion in Asia)
 and such encouragement as that of Britain
 in the Security Council.  From the Soviet
 Union has come denunciation-but it is odd-
 ly perfunctory.
 [From the New York Post, Aug. 6, 19641
 THE U.N. AND VIETNAM
 Clearly the United States does not seek a
 wider war.  Let us hope Asia's Communists
 do not either.  The initial Soviet response,
 as given        by Tass,  was  quite  restrained.
 While deploring U.S.  "aggressive       actions,"
 the statement avoided committing Moscow
 to doing anything about them.
 At  the U.N., the     Soviet  delegate was
 equally restrained.       His request that a rep-
 resentative of North Vietnam be invited to
 participate was doubly significant.
 It served to suggest that Moscow did not
 know what its Communist brethren in Asia
 were up to. It also set up interesting possi-
 bilities of dividing Hanoi from Peiping.
 Whatever Russia's motives, there is every
 reason to invite North Vietnam.
 "It is a solemn responsibility," said Presi-
 dent Johnson Tuesday night when he dis-
 closed an air strike was in progress, "to have.
 to order  even  limited  military  action by
 forces whose overall strength is as vast and
 as awesome as those of the United States."
 That awesome strength makes it all the
 more  baffling that the  North     Vietnamese
 should be seeking to provoke us.   Direct
 contact with the representatives of Hanoi
 may shed some light on this.
 North Vietnam may not like our vessels'
 presence in the Tonkin Gulf.  The Commu-
 nists have always been sensitive about their
 frontiers-almost to the point of paranoia.
 But neither does the United States exactly
 welcome electronically equipped Soviet ves-
 sels carrying on continuous survelllance off
 Cape Kennedy.                                                (independent)]

 Test of U.S. policy
 The sudden flareup of hot war in Vietnam
 provides a vital test of the flexible defense
 strategy favored by the Kennedy-Johnson
 administration.
 The next move is up to the Reds.  if they
 seek a wider war, they can have it. Because
 of our flexible strength, because we are able

 [From  the Philadelphia Inquirer, Aug. 7,

 As  THE       TENSION CONTINUES
 One inevitable consequence of momentous
 events in southeast Asia the past few days
 is the necessity for American foreign policy
 experts to reassess the entire situation in
 that part of the world.
 Although the basic U.S. objective-to pre-
 serve freedom and repel Communist aggres-
 sion-remains the same, there will need to be
 major revisions in the planning and execu-
 tion of methods to achieve the goal.
 The Communists should have no delusions
 now about the overwhelming superiority of
 American naval power in the Far East-but
 on land it is a different story.  For this rea-
 son, the great peril is that the Reds will step
 up their offensive in- the jungles of South
 Vietnam and Laos where American destroyers,
 aircraft carriers and jet planes can't help
 much.                          -
 Meanwhile, as fresh policy studies proceed,
 and the U.S. military buildup in the Far East
 is accelerated in preparation for any even-
 tuality, it is important for Americans to re-
 main united behind President Johnson in
 this crisis and to be wary of any wishful
 thinking that the danger has passed.  The
 North Vietnam dragon is nursing humiliat-
 ing wounds. "Saving face" is very important
 in that part of the world.
 Russia, apparently, is not anxious to en-
 courage North Vietnamese attacks against
 the United States, as indicated by the rela-
 tively mild nature of official Soviet words
 emanating from Moscow and the United Na-
 tions.  Red China, of course, is another mat-
 ter.  Peiping is always unpredictable.  Mao
 is always dangerous.
 Under existing circumstances it was shock-
 ing to have unity in Congress rudely shat-
 tered by Senator MORSE, of Oregon, -a mav-
 erick Member of the President's own party,
 who charges that the trouble in southeast
 Asia "is as much the doing of the United
 States as it Is the .doing of North Vietnam."
 Mr. MoRsE ignores all the facts in the case-
 notably the prolonged Communist aggression
 against Laos and South Vietnam and the un-
 provoked Red attacks on U.S. warships on the
 high seas.          -
 In contrast to the ill-advised outburst by
 Senator MORSE was the prompt support given
 to President Johnson by Senator GOLDWATER
 in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation that is
 so essential in this grave time.              -
 Facing up to all the new implications in-
 herent In the radically altered situation in
 southeast Asia is a task that requires the best
 in all of us.  This applies especially to those
 in  positions  of  public  responsibility who
 should dedicate themselves unstintingly to
 the task of doing whatever may need to be
 done to win the struggle for peace and free-
 dom.

 show the North Vietnamese aggressors their
 self-defeating folly in ignoring an unequivo-

 the American Navy on the high seas.  This
 Mr. Johnson did by means of a severe but
 measured response deftly fitted to the ag-
 gression: retaliation against the boats and
 bases used in the attack * * *.

 the Presidency as the single center of con-
 trol and responsibility for American power.
 "Military measures were  only a part of
 President  Johnson's response.   He coordi-

 and communities of which he is the leader.
 He asked and got from Senator GOLDWATER
 a promise of nonpartisanship.   The Senator,
 like the patriot he is, instantly forsook poli-
 tics and stood by his side."
 Pittsburgh Post Gazette:
 "In both his Tuesday announcement of
 the attack order and in his speech Wednes-

 stressed the limited nature of the American
 response to the gunboat attacks and the de-
 sire of the United States to avoid the tragedy
 of a wider war.  Yet no one in Washington
 has any way of anticipating the thinking of
 officials in Peiping.
 "In view of the serious danger to world
 peace  from  the  broadened  hostilities  in
 southeast Asia, the United States has prop-
 erly called for an emergency session of the
 United Nations Security Council to deal with
 the crisis.  Hopefully, through the good of-
 fices of that agency and the good sense of
 responsible officials in various capitals and
 chancelleries, the ugly Vietnamese war can
 be kept from triggering an  immeasurably
 more destructive wider conflict.
 The Boston Globe:
 "President Johnson, speaking at Syracuse
 University Wednesday, enunciated the prop-
 osition that 'aggression unchallenged is ag-
 gression  unleashed.'  This  striking  phrase
 reiterated a principle that has long lain at
 the heart of American foreign policy and at
 the core of every international crisis, how-
 ever complex it has seemed.
 "Peiping, with an unsolved food problem,
 would like an excuse to move into the 'rice
 bowl' of Indochina.  It might hope by a mass
 attack to leave the United States only the
 alternative  of  giving way  or  fighting  a
 major-perhaps  an  all-out-war.      Success
 would give the Chinese an immense advan-
 tage in the competition with Russia for the

 how far."
 The Times, London:  "The  next step is

 their counteraction, have issued no threats
 or ultimatums.   The Communists are not
 forced against a wall.  Secondly, the American
 reinforcements are enough to warn the Com-

 be highly costly and dangerous to them, as

 Americans have, very rightly, put the whole
 matter to the Security Council."
 The Guardian, Manchester: "The war will

 "BE IT RESOLVED-"
 As Commander in Chief, President John-
 son could, and did, order retaliatory action
 against North Vietnam for its unprovoked
 attacks upon American ships.  That was a
 logical extension of the right of self-defense;
 speed was of the essence.  But the continu-
 ing crisis in southeast Asia may call for
 other, more elaborate measures. It is sound
 policy to provide congressional indorsement
 in advance for such steps, both as an expres-
 sion of the role of the legislature in the
 American system of government and, at least
 equally important, as a demonstration of
 American determination.
 This dual role will be performed by the
 joint resolution to be voted today by both
 the Senate and House, approving the Presi-
 dent's action and empowering him to "take
 all  necessary  steps  including  the  use  of
 armed force," to aid America's allies, to repel
 attacks upon U.S. forces, and prevent fur-
 ther aggression.
 Red China has made it very clear that it
 considers North Vietnam's cause its own.. It
 Is very far from clear just what Peiping in-
 tends to do about it.  But in the light of
 past history (in Korea, on the Indian border,
 along the Formosa Strait) it would be folly
 to brush the Red Chinese menaces aside.  It
 would also be folly to assume that if action
 does not immediately follow on the threat
 the latter is empty.
 Red China has not always made good its
 boasts.  But it has hit hard in almost every
 case.  It brags now that Indochina presents
 a far better field of military action for its
 teeming divisions than the Korean Penin-
 sula, while no body of water separates China
 from Indochina as was the case with Que-
 moy, Matsu, and Formosa.
 The United States and its  allies,  then,
 would do well to regard the threat from
 Peiping as a time bomb, which will only go
 off when the Red Chinese want it to.     The
 best method of preventing an explosion Is to
 impress, as strongly as possible, upon Mao
 Tse-tung and his band, that this country is
 prepared, physically and morally, to meet
 any thrust.
 The joint resolution gives the President
 full backing for any preparations that the
 Armed Forces may require in the danger area.
 It does so publicly and unequivocally.  At
 the same time, it gives voice to the American
 will.  Indeed, it might be said that the most
 significant part of the measure is the formal

 17884                      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I yield
 the remainder of my time to the great
 statesman from Alaska [Mr. GRUENINGI.
 Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, yes-
 terday, I made my views on the pending
 resolution known on the floor of the
 Senate, and they appear in the CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD.  There is no need to add
 to them, except to reaffirm them.  It is
 a matter of deep regret for me that I
 cannot, on this major issue, support the
 resolution drafted by the Foreign Rela-
 tions and Armed Services Committees in
 response to a message from the Presi-
 dent to the Congress requesting such
 support.
 I believe that President Johnson in
 his more than 8 months in office has
 shown himself to be a great President.
 I find myself in warm accord with most
 of his actions and declarations of policy.
 I intend to campaign for him after the
 adjournment of Congress.
 Regrettably, I find myself In disagree-
 ment with his southeast Asian policy,
 and have repeatedly voiced my disagree-
 ment in                     the Chamber.  The serious
 events of the past few days, the attack
 by North Vietnamese vessels on Ameri-
 can warships and our reprisal, strikes
 me as the inevitable and forseeable con-
 comitant and consequence of U.S. uni-
 lateral  military  aggressive policy  in
 southeast Asia.
 I consider the action of the North Vi-
 etnamese in attacking our vessels as ut-
 terly stupid and outrageous, and our
 prompt  retaliation   justifiable and
 proper. But this is precisely the kind of
 episode that our unilateral and aggres-
 sive policy in southeast Asia would In-
 evitably bring forth.                      That incident has
 in turn brought about the President's
 message and the responding resolution
 by Congress.
 If this resolution merely affirmed its
 approval of the President's declared pol-
 icy and action to respond to attacks on
 our fleet when in international waters,
 as he has responded, that would be one
 thing.  I would gladly approve of such
 a resolution, as I approve of his action.
 But this resolution now before us. goes
 far beyond that.  It not only endorses
 all our Government has done to date in
 southeast Asia, but also gives the Presi-
 dent a blank check, not merely to do
 whatever he likes in South Vietnam, but,
 to quote the text of the resolution:
 To take all necessary steps, including the
 use of armed force, to assist any member or
 protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collec-
 tive Defense Treaty requesting assistance in
 defense of its freedom.
 That Is, in effect, a pre-dated declara-
 tion of war, if and when the Executive
 chooses, and war not merely in South
 Vietnam but in all southeast Asia.
 Is that what the Congress intends?
 That is what the Congress is doing.
 We now are about to authorize the
 President if he sees fits to move our
 Armed Forces-that Is, the Army, Air
 Force, Navy, and Marine Corps-not
 only into South Vietnam, but also into
 North Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thai-
 land, and of course the authorization
 includes all the rest of the SEATO na-
 tions.
 That means  sending our American
 boys into combat in a war in which we
 have no business, which Is not our war,
 Into which we have been misguidedly
 drawn, which is steadily being escalated.
 This resolution is a further authoriza-
 tion for escalation unlimited.
 I am opposed to sacrificing a single
 American boy in this venture. We have
 lost far too many already.
 I have repeatedly expressed my view
 which I now reiterate.  That we should
 have been waging peace with the same
 energy and fervor with which we have
 been waging war.
 I have asked, and ask again now, that
 instead of multiplying our Armed Forces
 and the resulting casualties, we request
 a cease-fire and seek, instead of hostile
 military action, a peacekeeping United
 Nations police force. I should be happy
 to see Americans as a part of that peace-
 keening police force.
 'T'his procedure, as I have pointed out,
 has been successfully used on the Israel-
 Egypt border, and in the Congo.  Why
 not try it in South Vietnam?
 My time being short, I can only call
 attention to my earlier statement on this
 resolution and repeat that I Cannot in
 good conscience support the pending
 resolution, which opens the door to un-
 limited unilateral war by our country In
 an area and for a cause which pose no
 threat to our national security, and in
 which no more American lives should be
 sacrificed.
 Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, how much
 time remains to me?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Senator from Oregon has 8 minutes re-
 maining.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I shall
 not use all of that time. I wish only to
 correct a misapprehension that I was
 not able to cover in my speech earlier,
 but I wish to add one further point which
 I overlooked.
 I was commenting on a Washington
 Post editorial which cited the Cuban
 resolution as being comparable to the
 pending resolution.
 Last night, I pointed out that they
 are quite different resolutions.
 I ask Senators to turn to page 17845
 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of August
 6. where I inserted the Cuban resolu-
 tion.                                                     It will be recalled that in discus-
 sion of the Cuban resolution the point
 was made, both in committee and on the
 floor of the Senate, that the resolution
 differed from the Middle East resolution
 and the Formosa resolution, in that it
 made no reference whatever to author-
 izing any power to the President of the
 Un`tcd States.  It was because of that
 that we were able to get support for the
 resolution.  At the time of the Cuban
 resolution if there had been an attempt
 to give war making authority to the
 President, the resolution would not have
 received the votes it did. Some Senators
 announced that they would not support
 the resolution with such a clause in it.
 If we examine the resolution, we see
 that all it does Is to set out the opinion
 of Congress as to what American foreign
 policy should be, vis-a-vis Cuba.
 That Is quite a different thing from
 giving the President any authority for a
 predated declaration of  war  in respect
 to Cuba, as this resolution does in respect
 to Asiatic problems.
 August 7
 I believe that history will record that
 we have made a great mistake in sub-
 verting and circumventing the Constitu-
 tion of the United States, article I, sec-
 tion 8, thereof by means of this resolu-
 tion.
 As I  argued earlier today  at some
 length, we are in effect giving the Presi-
 dent of the Unitec States warmaking
 powers In the absence of a declaration of
 war.
 I believe that to be a historic mistake.
 I believe that within the next century,
 future generations will look with dismay
 and great disappointment upon a Con-
 gress which is now about to make such a
 historic mistake.
 Our constitutions= rights are no better
 than the preservation of our procedural
 guarantees under the Constitution.
 We are seeking by indirection to cir-
 cumvent article I, section 8 of the Con-
 stitution.  Senators know as well as I do
 that we cannot obtain a test before the
 U S. Supreme Court of that attempt to
 grant warmaking powers to a President
 by a resolution because under this set of
 facts we cannot hail the President of the
 United States before the Supreme Court
 for a determination of such a question as
 to the unconstitutionality of the pending
 resolution.
 I am sorry, but I believe that Congress
 Is not protecting the procedural, consti-
 tutional rights of the American people,
 under article I, section 8 of the Consti-
 tution.
 If the President of the United States,
 after Pearl Harbor, could exercise his in-
 herent power in defense of this country,
 as every President alas the right to do
 and then come before the Congress and
 ask for a declaration of war as Roosevelt
 did, then the pending regulation is not
 necessary.  The President can come to
 Congress and ask for a declaration of
 war, as was done against Japan at that
 time. The President of the United States
 can now do likewise, if the time ever
 comes when the President must ask for
 a declaration of war against a country
 in Asia or anywhere else.
 For the reasons I have set forth, I shall
 vote against the resolution.
 Mr. President, I yield back the re-
 mainder of my time.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, the
 senior Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr.
 CLARK]  is necessarily absent today but
 has asked that he be recorded in favor
 of the resolution supporting the Presi-
 dent's policies in Vietnam. The Senator
 would slate, if he were here, that the
 United States was the victim of unneces-
 sary provocation and that the United
 States was compelled to respond and, he
 would add, that it is essential for the
 country to unite behind the President at
 this time of crisis.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the Senate
 proceed to the consideration of House
 Joint Resolution 1145, as a substitute for
 the Senate joint resolution.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Char 1c ys before the Senate a joint reso-
 lution coming over from the House,
 which will be stated by title.
 The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1145)
 was read twice by its title.

 So the joint resolution (H.J" Res. 1145)
 was passed as follows:
 Whereas naval units of the Communist
 regime in Vietnam, in violation of the prin-
 ciples of the Charter of the United Nations
 and of international law, have deliberately
 and repeatedly attacked United States naval
 vessels  lawfully  present  in  International
 waters, and have thereby created a serious
 threat to international peace; and
 Whereas these attacks are part of a delib-
 erate and systematic campaign of aggression
 that the Communist regime in North Viet-
 nam has been waging against its neighbors
 and the nations joined with them in the col-
 lective defense of their freedom; and
 Whereas the United States is assisting the
 peoples of southeast Asia to protect their
 freedom and has no territorial, military or
 political ambitions in that area, but desires
 only that these peoples should be left in
 peace to work out their own destinies in their
 own way: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
 resentatives of the United States of America
 in Congress assembled, That the Congress
 approves and supports the determination of
 the President, as Commander in Chief, to
 take all necessary measures to repel any
 armed attack against the forces of the United
 States and to prevent further aggression.
 SEC. 2. The United States regards as vital
 to its national interest and to world peace
 the maintenance of international peace and
 security in southeast Asia.  Consonant with
 the Constitution of the United States and
 the Charter of the United Nations and in
 accordance with its obligations under the
 Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the
 United States is, therefore, prepared, as the
 President determines, to take all necessary
 steps, including the use of armed force, to
 assist any member or protocol state of the
 Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty re-
 questing assistance in defense of its freedom.
 SEC. 3. This resolution shall expire when
 the President shall determine that the peace
 and security of the area is reasonably assured
 by international conditions created by action
 of the United Nations or otherwise, except
 that it may be terminated earlier by concur-
 rent resolution of the Congress.
 The preamble was agreed to.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that Senate Joint
 Resolution 189 be indefinitely postponed.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-

 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, I

 MONUMENT  TO  COMMEMORATE
 THE FOUNDING OF THE UNITED
 NATIONS ON ALCATRAZ ISLAND,
 CALIF.
 Mr. LONG of Missouri.  Mr. President
 ,
 on Monday of this week I had the privi-
 lege and honor of filing with the Con-
 gress the final report of the Commission
 on the Disposition of Alcatraz Island.
 The Commission, established by Public
 Law 88-138 as amended by Public Law
 88-226, made several recommendations
 In its report as to how best Alcatraz
 Island might be utilized.
 Today, I have the privilege of intro-
 ducing on behalf of myself and the Sen-
 ator from California [Mr. SALINGERI leg-
 islation in this august body to implement
 the recommendations of the Commission.
 Representative   JEFFREY   COHELAN,   Of
 California, Is introducing similar legis-
 lation in the House of Representatives
 today.
 The primary purpose of this bill is to
 provide for the erection of a monument
 on Alcatraz Island to commemorate the
 founding of the Un'ted Nations in San
 Francisco, Calif., in .1945, and to serve as
 a symbol of peace.
 To achieve this noble objective, this
 bill would establish a commission to be
 known as the United Nations Monument
 Commission.  The Commission's func-
 tion would be to develop and execute
 suitable plans for (he erection of the
 monument. Moreover, the international
 architectural competition, designed to se-
 lect the most suitable monument for
 erection on the island, will be under the
 general supervision of the Commission,
 as will be the demolition and removal of
 the present structures on the island and
 the building of the monument.
 Although all costs incurred in the de-
 molition and building aspects on the is-
 land are to be borne by the San Francis-
 co Chapter of the American Association
 for the United Nations, rather than the
 Federal Government, the proposed legis-
 lation provides for the Commission, In
 consultation and cooperation with  he
 Secretary of Interior, to oversee activi
 ties on Alcatraz.  The National Park
 Service Is charged with administeriT,
 protecting, and developing the monu-
 ment after it is built.
