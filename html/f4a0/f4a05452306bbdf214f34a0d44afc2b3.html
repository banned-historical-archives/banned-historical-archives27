 The Factional Factor
 in Chinese Politics                                               25X1
 The existence of factions within the Chinese Communist Party is clearly a
 source of much of the political instability that has beset China for decades.
 With deep roots in Chinese history and political culture, factions are a
 traditional and proven part of political conflict. They emerge in times of
 crisis and weak leadership, and have a paralyzing effect on the political
 system until the effective distribution of power is resolved. China's
 factional proclivities are exacerbated by a Leninist one-party system that
 leaves no room for loyal opposition.
 The Chinese recently have begun to address the issue of factionalism in
 their political system. In the past few months, the official media have
 discussed factionalism in detail, especially as it affects the lower levels of
 China's various bureaucracies. Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang,
 after several tours through the provinces, called on all areas to "eradicate"
 factionalism, as part of the process of cleansing the party and reforming
 the political system.
 In response, many provinces have begun to publicize their factional
 problems with unprecedented frankness. We believe that this new informa-
 tion, when added to what we already know about high-level politics, now
 provides sufficient grounds for making some judgments about the effect of
 factionalism on the current leadership and its policies. Our conclusions are
 necessarily speculative because the information is still fragmentary and
 leaves much room for variant interpretations:
 ? We believe that factionalism-the propensity to divide into exclusive
 groups loyal to specific individuals for the purpose of political conflict-
 currently is a latent, not manifest problem in the Central Committee.
 This is due to the political strength of Deng Xiaoping, the relative
 homogeneity of the Politburo, and rough consensus at the top on general
 policies and the rules of the political game.
 ? Factional considerations presently play a limited role in the formulation
 of policies in China, particularly foreign policy. Foreign policy is
 determined by a small group of the most senior leaders-dominated by
 Deng-who consider China's foreign policy primarily in geopolitical
 terms. In domestic policy, factionalism has been muted in part because
 Deng has shifted decisionmaking to the smaller, younger party
 Secretariat.

 ? US-China relations thus are somewhat insulated from the push and pull
 of Chinese domestic politics, though not completely so. Some Chinese
 occasionally have played on Western concerns about Politburo factional-
 ism to gain advantage in working out bilateral problems.
 ? Factionalism may emerge in a post-Deng era, as survivors and successors
 compete for his power. Deng has controlled factionalism but has not
 eliminated its causes. General Secretary Hu Yaobang is gaining prestige
 and authority, but there are still several other party veterans capable of
 leading formidable factions to counter him.
 ? The current campaign against factionalism will probably score limited
 success in overcoming local factional problems, but it will not resolve the
 system's fundamental susceptibility to factional infighting.

 Scope Note             The behavior of political factions within the Chinese Communist Party has
 long been a controversial subject among Western analysts and scholars of
 China. Generally, the scarcity of reliable information on political interac-
 tions in this secrecy-shrouded regime has made it difficult for the
 intelligence and academic communities to develop a thorough understand-
 ing of the dynamics of politics at the Central Committee and Politburo
 level. Lacking clear definitions or conceptual precision, factionalism has
 become a type of analytical "fudge factor": its relevance to the real
 political process often is more assumed than analyzed, and it is frequently
 held responsible for the occasional sudden shifts in Chinese foreign or
 domestic policy that defy conventional analysis or confuse Western
 observers.
 China's tumultuous political history over the last three decades lends itself
 easily to analysis along factional lines. Ever since Mao Zedong launched
 the Great Leap Forward in 1958, China has been a country of sweeping
 policy and personnel changes, of government by conspiracy and coup, of
 intense political polarization and vicious infighting. Even though the
 current situation, by comparison, is orderly and quiet, analytic habits
 acquired over several years of observing political instability and fluidity
 have disposed analysts to doubt official claims of a "new situation of
 unprecedented unity and stability" in China, and to look for factionalism
 beneath the surface tranquillity. This paper is an attempt to come to grips
 with some of the analytical problems involved in defining and assessing
 factionalism. It addresses questions of how pervasive factionalism is in
 Chinese society, under what conditions factions develop, how they affect
 policy decisions, and how they can be controlled.

 Secret
 in Chinese Politics
 The term "faction" (pai) is used commonly, but
 somewhat loosely, in the Chinese language to describe
 any identifiable group in a political context. It is
 generally attached to the end of a descriptive term or
 name. Thus the term has been used to define groups
 of "reactionaries" (fandong pai), or the "left wing"
 (zuo pai) of a larger party; one can be labeled a
 "Dengist" (Deng pai) or a "capitalist roader" (zou zi
 pai), or a member of the "whatever faction" (fan shi
 pai) associated with former party Chairman Hua
 Guofeng. Individuals so designated in this popular
 form of political stereotyping may not agree with the
 designation.
 A more precise definition is needed, however, for the
 purposes of analysis of factionalism as a factor in
 current Chinese politics. In the discussion that fol-
 lows, a faction is understood to be a group of individ-
 uals bound by strong personal ties to a particular
 leader, consciously engaged in competitive, goal-
 oriented political action. Its primary goals are the
 enhancement of power and security for constituent
 members. Factional activity refers to conscious politi-
 cal choices intended primarily for the benefit of one
 faction or to damage other perceived factions. These
 run the gamut from preferential appointments and
 promotions to a wide variety of negative activities
 directed at factional opponents, from minor harass-
 ment to incarceration or murder.
 Factions arise from, but are not equal to, the networks
 of informal relationships and personal ties that are
 referred to in China as guanxi.' Factions tend to arise
 in situations of political uncertainty or irresolute
 authority, either as a defense against attack by hostile
 political forces, or as a means of acquiring political
 ' Guanxi means, literally, "relationship," but in a sociopolitical
 context, it has extensive connotations. Guanxi refers to mutual
 obligations between two individuals, based upon family, school,
 work unit, region, or other association. It is the channel through
 which things get done in China-it is "who you know." It is the
 glue which binds factions together; guanxi can thrive without
 power. Power in China accrues to individuals, not
 offices, and a faction leader is one who is perceived to
 have personal power sufficient to provide for his
 supporters. Given its concentration on individuals,
 rather than issues or offices, factional activity tends to
 generate intense political animosities and lasting per-
 sonal hatreds.
 One of the paradoxical,characteristics of factionalism
 in China is that it is viewed with near-universal
 opprobrium. As in any Leninist party, factionalism in
 the Chinese Communist Party is considered a grave
 violation of the "rules of the game," which call for
 collective decisionmaking and discipline through
 "democratic centralism." Equally important, faction-
 alism has been anathema to Chinese political theorists
 from Confucius to Mao. A consistent strain in Chi-
 nese political philosophy is the idealization of a
 harmonious and unified leadership, maintaining le-
 gitimacy through commitment to and exemplary
 practice of moral virtues. The idea of banding togeth-
 er to compete for power or personal gain is abhorrent,
 prima facie evidence that the individuals concerned
 are evil and unworthy of leadership.
 The accusation of factionalist behavior, then, carries
 considerable pejorative weight, and this sharply limits
 the scope for legitimate political conflict in modern
 China. Factionalism is pure power politics, but since
 that is considered improper, the losers of a political
 struggle are usually accused of factionalism, as if that
 alone were the cause of their downfall. Mao invari-
 ably so charged his fallen opponents,' and even the
 Gang of Four, despite abundant evidence of their
 involvement in murder and vast abuse of power, were
 tried and convicted primarily on charges of "leading a
 counterrevolutionary clique."
 2 A list of Mao's primary opponents and their "crimes" would
 include: Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, purged in 1954 for forming
 an antiparty alliance"; Peng Dehuai, Huang Kecheng, and others,
 dismissed in 1959 for forming an "antiparty military clique"; and
 Lin Biao and his General Staff, branded after their 1971 fall as "a

 Although its most violent phase ended 15 years ago,
 and the entire era was declared over with the purge of
 the Gang of Four in 1976, the Cultural Revolution
 still permeates political life in China to a remarkable
 degree. The leadership, and particularly Hu Yaobang,
 seems obsessed with it: rectification is intended to
 purge the party of its influence, and cadre are still
 being charged with crimes committed during that era.
 In many other cases, people are trying to recover
 property, -reputations or family members lost during
 the "10 years of chaos," or avenge themselves against
 former persecutors.
 Factionalism is in no small part responsible for the
 perpetuation of the problems created during the Cul-
 tural Revolution. In its most turbulent phase, 1967-
 69, social order collapsed in many areas of the
 country. A multitude of political factions, all claiming
 allegiance to Chairman Mao, struggled for power at
 every level with escalating ferocity. Thousands died in
 sectarian violence that in some places involved heavy
 artillery and armored vehicles stolen from military
 arsenals. With the help of the People's Liberation
 Army (PLA), order was finally restored, violent Red
 Guard youth were shipped off to rural exile, and the
 party began to reconstruct its shattered organizations.
 But because no clear winners had emerged, the new
 "revolutionary committees" often were composed of
 roughly equal numbers from opposing factions, with
 Beijing-designated PLA officers holding real power.
 As the Army withdrew from political life over the
 next few years, the factions continued their competi-
 tion for power and revenge, though in a somewhat less
 violent manner.
 Factionalism in the Politburo exacerbated problems
 below. Increasingly hostile groups in the Central
 Committee jockeyed for power and intrigued against
 each other, with the denouement occurring after
 Mao's death in 1976. This turbulence was amply
 reflected at lower levels; political change at the top
 brought renewed struggle at lower levels, with direc-
 tives and propaganda slogans serving as openings for
 shifting power and arresting opponents. Moreover,
 local factionalism took on a life of its own, persisting
 in many areas without direct support from, and even
 in defiance of, Beijing. Feuds dating from the Cultur-
 al Revolution have delayed or distorted implementa-
 tion of Deng's political and economic reforms, despite
 massive personnel changes ordered by Beijing. It was
 this linkage of low-level policy opposition to Cultural
 Revolution factionalism that evidently led Deng and
 Hu to confront the factionalism issue directly.
 The party leadership, however, has been revising its
 assessment of factionalism as it has begun to realize
 how deeply the problem is rooted in society. Judging
 by the "Decision on Consolidation," adopted by a
 party plenum in October 1983, factionalism was
 equated in practice with political opposition, and
 factionalists were among the "three types of people"
 to be removed from office during the party rectifica-
 tion campaign.' According to the communique, those
 afflicted by factionalism "use their faction as the line
 of demarcation and appoint people by favoritism while
 elbowing out of their way those who hold different
 views; they form cliques to pursue selfish interests,
 seriously impairing the unity and solidarity of the
 party and hindering the party from carrying out its
 line, principles, and policies." A product of the Cul-
 tural Revolution and "leftist" ideology, factional be-
 havior, in the view of Deng and his reformist support-
 ers, was small group behavior in opposition to the
 established goals of the regime.
 More recently, the party seems to have recognized
 that the association of factionalism with leftist opposi-
 tion was not always accurate or helpful in carrying
 out party rectification. Investigations of various prob-
 lem-ridden leadership groups evidently showed that
 factional animosities existed within the reformist wing
 of the party itself, between the local party leadership
 and the PLA, or even within the PLA itself-and in
 IThe
 other two "types" to be excluded from leadership positions are
 those who rose dramatically during the Cultural Revolution on the
 basis of "rebel" activities, and those who engaged in "beating,

 Secret
 none of these cases was the charge of leftist opposi-
 tionism appropriate. In late May, party leaders, and
 especially Hu Yaobang, shifted gears somewhat, and
 phased into party rectification work an education
 campaign to portray factionalism as a consequence of
 the Cultural Revolution that can afflict even officials
 with the "correct" political orientation.
 The logic of Hu's campaign is relatively simple:
 factions are a product of the Cultural Revolution; the
 Cultural Revolution was totally wrong; therefore, all
 factions were wrong then, and are wrong now. No
 faction can insist that it pursued a "correct" political
 or ideological line, nor can the PLA claim its support
 for one faction or another was correct. All should
 recognize their errors, engage in self-criticism, hold
 "heart-to-heart talks" with their adversaries, and let
 bygones be bygones. Interestingly, the most thorough
 and authoritative exposition of this approach to the
 problem was contained in the 28 July issue of the
 PLA newspaper, Jiefangjun Bao.
 We believe, however, that the campaign to "negate
 the Cultural Revolution" and eliminate factionalism
 is more than just a mild phase in the party's rectifica-
 tion campaign. The evidence presented in the publici-
 ty campaign indicates that factionalism is a serious
 problem at every level of society, and that it presents a
 clear danger to the party's ability to rule and refur-
 bish its tarnished image. In our view, the national
 campaign against factionalism also has implications
 for politics at the center.
 Factionalism in the Politburo-Image and Reality
 Western analysts tend to disagree on the importance
 of factionalism in current Politburo politics. There are
 those who see factional alignments and infighting
 everywhere, or who attribute any evidence of policy
 disagreement within the leadership to a factional
 fight. Taiwan's "China watchers" also appear to take
 this approach.
 We believe that the conceptual framework is crucial
 to analyzing Chinese politics at the Central Commit-
 tee level. As in any political system, the Chinese
 leadership is subject to a variety of cleavages and
 categorizations, some of which are regarded-errone-
 ously, we believe-as the basis for factionalism. For
 example, some observers see generational differences
 as being paramount, and view Deng as head of an
 "old cadres faction." Others see factions based on
 attitudinal positions, such as a "pragmatist faction"
 or an "opposition faction." Some analysts see factions
 based on policy positions, such as a "heavy industry
 faction" or "pro-Soviet faction," while others have
 looked at past bureaucratic assignments as the basis
 of factions like a "Third Field Army faction" or a
 "China Youth League faction."
 Although these are fruitful areas for investigation,
 they are of limited value in explaining political dy-
 namics at the upper levels of the Central Committee.
 Interest groups, bureaucratic associates, and "old boy
 networks" do exist in the Chinese political system and
 do have an impact on the development of policy. They
 often form the basis of "guanxi networks" that can
 develop into factions under some circumstances. They
 should not be confused with factions, however. Fac-
 tions are cohesive, personalistic, and power oriented;

 We believe that available evidence supports the con-
 clusion that factionalism is now a latent, not a
 manifest, problem in the national party leadership.
 Compared with those periods when factionalism was
 clearly operating and was recognized by the Chinese
 for what it was-that is, the 1972-76 period between
 the death of Lin Biao and the purge of the Gang of
 Four-the absence of evidence of factionalism in the
 current Politburo is striking. Although there are
 serious policy disputes within the Politburo, as well as
 personal rivalries and scores to be settled, the situa-
 tion, in our judgment, is well below the point where
 any of the principals may feel obliged to draw togeth-
 er a faction to do battle. Furthermore, we believe that
 there are now specific institutional constraints against
 factionalism, some of them attributable to actions and
 policies undertaken by Deng Xiaoping.
 Mitigating Conditions
 Several characteristics of the current leadership make
 it less prone to factionalization than any leadership
 group in China since the 1950s. These act as con-
 straints on the Chinese inclination toward
 factionalism:
 ? Relative homogeneity of the Politburo. The purge
 of the Gang of Four and the "winnowing" of the
 Politburo since that time has resulted in the virtual
 elimination of the extremist elements that precipi-
 tated earlier factional struggles. The current Polit-
 buro is a collection of moderate party bureaucrats
 committed to economic progress and orderly poli-
 tics. They are experienced in getting things done by
 pulling the right bureaucratic strings. Although
 claims of "unity and stability" need not be taken at
 face value, it would appear that this Politburo has
 less to fight about than most of its predecessors.
 ? Deng's domination. Deng Xiaoping's control of the
 central decisionmaking apparatus is nearly unchal-
 lenged. By virtue of his political skills, policy initia-
 tives, and extensive bureaucratic contacts, he has
 managed to sidestep, co-opt, or eliminate opposition
 and establish himself as the ultimate authority
 figure in the regime. He has prevented others from
 taking collusive action against him, and he has
 avoided the appearance of factionalism in confront-
 ing his own opponents. In such an environment of
 confident authority, careful attention to the opinions
 of other party leaders, and fair allocation of power,
 factionalism has not been able to flourish.
 ? Ideological/procedural consensus. Nearly all cur-
 rent Politburo members share a revulsion against
 the kind of cutthroat factional infighting that char-
 acterized the Cultural Revolution. The leadership
 seems committed to orderly rules of political inter-
 action, especially the prohibition on factions. Deng
 Xiaoping, although he thoroughly dominates the
 political scene, has tended to avoid the appearance
 of organizing a factional battle against his oppo-
 nents and has eschewed subjecting them to extreme
 humiliation or disgrace.
 ? Crosscutting loyalties and the distribution of pow-
 er. Under Deng, the political process in China has
 become somewhat more decentralized. Important
 policy issues get decided at various levels of various
 bureaucracies-power is more diffuse than it has
 been previously. Moreover, the policymaking proc-
 ess is more open. Alternative views can be aired and
 disagreements can be expressed without one's politi-
 cal loyalty or ideological standing being questioned.
 This has helped reduce the interpersonal frictions
 within the system. Furthermore, individuals within
 the Politburo are subjected to crosscutting institu-
 tional and personal loyalties.

 ? Rough policy consensus. There appears to be a
 general agreement among members of the Politburo
 that the policy lines developed by Deng Xiaoping
 are appropriate and correct. Reorientation of the
 party's work to economic modernization (rather
 than class struggle), party rectification and bureau-
 cratic reorganization, pursuit of an "independent"
 foreign policy, and increasing foreign trade are all
 issues that have elicited both popular support and
 elite agreement. Although there are marked differ-
 ences of opinion and heated arguments over particu-
 lar aspects of some policies, they have generally not
 seriously damaged personal relations within the
 leading group.
 ? Systemic loyalty. In any bureaucracy, the higher
 one rises in the system, the stronger the loyalty to it.
 This is clearly the case in the Politburo and other
 Central Committee decisionmaking organs. Most of
 their members have experienced the near collapse of
 the political system, and are determined that it will
 not happen again. Whatever their personal differ-
 ences, Politburo members have a strong sense of
 responsibility about their jobs and a commitment to
 the survival and improvement of the political/
 economic system that overrides other concerns.
 This is not to say that political strife is absent from
 the upper levels of the Central Committee. There are
 fierce debates on economic, political, and ideological
 issues, contention between those who favor accelerat-
 ing economic reform and those who want to slow it,
 and numerous bureaucratic battles over scarce re-
 sources and budgetary priorities. In our view, how-
 ever, these are fundamentally different from faction-
 alism.

 Ziyan                              tend to portray
 the policy process as orderly and bureaucratically
 logical. We believe                   basically accu-
 rate, if somewhat flattering to the current regime.
 Premier Zhao Ziyang: Recently described Chi-
 na's foreign policy decisionmaking process in
 According to Zhao's remarkably frank comments, the
 Politburo Standing Committee does not meet as a
 group, and the Politburo does so only rarely, because
 of the age and poor health of many Politburo mem-
 bers. Only the weightiest issues-such as the overall
 direction to be pursued in Sino-US relations-are
 brought to the attention of China's most senior lead-
 ers, and on those occasions, Deng Xiaoping's influ-
 ence is decisive. In the formulation of foreign policy,
 as described by Zhao               proposals
 come up through the foreign policy bureaucracy, with
 critical inputs from quasi-governmental "think tanks"
 and noted Chinese scholars. A special State Council
 "small group" (presumably formally designated by
 the leadership) coordinates foreign policy questions
 and adjudicates interministerial disputes. If it cannot
 resolve the issue, it is then passed up to the party's
 Secretariat (headed by Hu) or the State Council
 (under Zhao), or to both in joint conference. The party
 has its own foreign policy "small group," chaired but
 not dominated by President Li Xiannian, that ad-
 dresses more sensitive foreign policy issues.

 Propaganda Department Director Deng Liqun:
 Chief advocate of national campaign against
 "spiritual pollution."
 Deng, in our view, has established a decisionmaking
 process that effectively bypasses the Politburo. In
 addition to making the process more efficient, we
 believe that these procedures also tend to reduce the
 factional factor in decisionmaking. The Politburo is
 prone to factionalism because it is composed of veter-
 an party leaders who have risen on the basis of their
 political power and administrative talents. They are
 all, in a sense, potential faction leaders because of
 their extensive personal ties and patron-client rela-
 tionships within the party bureaucracy.
 As far as factional activity is concerned, those in the
 Politburo who have the prestige and guanxi to form
 serious factions appear to lack the bureaucratic ac-
 cess, the physical stamina, or the willpower to take on
 Deng Xiaoping. They also have as negative examples
 Hua Guofeng, Wang Dongxing, Chen Xilian, Wu De,
 Ji Dengkui, and Wei Guoqing, Politburo leaders who
 have sought to organize a challenge to Deng and paid
 a heavy price. The Politburo's propensity for faction-
 alism, but unwillingness to engage in it, can be seen in
 the 1983 "campaign against spiritual pollution" (see
 inset).
 Despite the fact that Deng Xiaoping appears to have
 latent factionalism under control within the Central
 Committee leadership, it is clear from evidence the
 party media recently have provided that the problem
 permeates Chinese society. The campaign to publicize
 factionalism suggests that the leadership is confident
 enough about the results of its rectification campaign
 to risk opening old wounds, but also that it recognizes
 the hidden dangers of allowing factional animosities
 to fester in the party bureaucracy.
 Most of the recent articles on factionalism have been
 carefully written to reflect Beijing's goals for party
 reform. They generally describe factionalism in small
 units or localities, link it clearly to the Cultural
 Obviously, one must keep in mind when analyzing examples of
 factionalism provided by the party media that the stories being
 related are carefully chosen for their didactic value. In some cases,
 they are written from the perspective of the winner of the factional
 struggle. Nonetheless, they are useful in illustrating the scope and

 The Spiritual Pollution Campaign-
 Factionalism Fizzles
 The "campaign to eliminate spiritual pollution, "
 which threw the Chinese political system into turmoil
 in late 1983, had all the markings of a factional
 struggle. The issue-the growing influence of modern
 Western culture and philosophy on a Chinese popula-
 tion long denied knowledge of them-was a highly
 emotional and symbolic one, lacking in policy speci-
 ficity. It was raised at a mid-October Central Com-
 mittee plenum by Deng Xiaoping himself, in response
 to problems emanating from the "liberal" wing of the
 party. Deng did not, however, provide specific guid-
 ance on the targets for the campaign, or the methods
 to be used to carry it out, this opened the possibility
 of competing for the favor of the party's ruling figure
 by rushing to carry out his perceived wishes.
 Propaganda Department head Deng Liqun charged
 forward with the campaign, using it first as a means
 to attack certain heterodox writers, and then, with
 the support of the Politburo's chief theoretician, Hu
 Qiaomu, to force the ouster of two "liberal" editors
 of the People's Daily. By early November, the cam-
 paign began to take on policy overtones, with People's
 Daily articles implicitly attacking certain cherished
 domestic policies, such as agricultural reform, and
 possibly China's foreign policy tilt toward the United
 States. At lower levels, the campaign evidently led to
 retrenchment on "liberal" policies, persecution of
 unconventional youth, and the reopening of factional
 battles in various localities. Finally, it appeared that
 the campaign was being used to undermine the status
 of General Secretary Hu Yaobang. Some media
 commentaries seemed obliquely critical of him, and
 rumors began to circulate that Hu and Deng had
 fallen out, and even that Deng had begun looking for
 another successor. Hong Kong's Zhengming maga-
 zine eventually claimed Deng Liqun and Hu Qiaomu
 were involved in an attempt to weaken Hu Yaobang.
 Hu Yaobang reportedly called a Politburo meeting
 prior to his 23 November visit to Japan, at which the
 negative results of the campaign were brought to
 Deng Xiaoping s attention. Deng ordered that the
 campaign be limited to literary and theoretical areas,
 and that it be strictly separated from practical policy.
 In late November and early December, Deng Liqun
 and the head of the military commissariat set out
 strict guidelines limiting the campaign.
 But although spiritual pollution receded from the
 main policy arenas by the beginning of 1984, the
 campaign continued with great intensity in the theo-
 retical realm so closely watched by China's intellec-
 tuals. In mid-January, Hu Qiaomu wrote a long
 theoretical exposition refuting liberal interpretations
 of Marxism. Despite the regime's intent that Hu's
 article be the final word on the subject, it aroused
 more protest and criticism of its theoretical incon-
 sistencies and perpetuated the bitterness that the
 campaign had injected into the political atmosphere.
 Deng Xiaoping had finally had enough.
 he retracted the portions of his
 October speech dealing with spiritual pollution
 (which had never been published, in any case) and
 criticized the propaganda apparatus for its clumsy
 execution of the campaign. It was expected that Deng
 Liqun would be fired as Propaganda Department
 Director, but he held on to his job, probably because
 the party leadership did not want to project an image
 of disarray. In June, Zhao Ziyang declared the
 "spiritual pollution" issue to have been "successful-
 ly" concluded. Since then, the "reformist" line asso-
 ciated with Hu and Zhao has advanced strongly,
 controversial new economic and social policies have
 been adopted, and propaganda units have been specif-
 ically instructed that their work is to support the
 reforms.

 Did Deng Liqun, thinking he had the support of other
 party elders, such as Chen Yun, Wang Zhen, and
 Peng Zhen, attempt to weaken Hu Yaobang? Did a
 "reformist faction" of Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang,
 Wan Li, and Hu Qili counterattack in late Novem-
 ber? The evidence is inconclusive and fully illustrates
 the difficulty of analyzing factional activity. One
 point is very clear, however: Deng Xiaoping decided  25X1
 the outcome of the campaign. He set it in motion, and
 he ended it. His unchallengeable authority put a stop
 to whatever factionalization was taking place in the
 Politburo. He appears to have protected both Hu
 Yaobang and Deng Liqun from each other. We believe
 that the seeds of factionalism personal animosities,
 teaming up for defense, and emotional treatment of
 obscure issues-were sown but that Deng 's interven-
 tion prevented growth. Party unity was preserved,
 factionalism withered.                          25X1

 According to a 6 April article in Renmin Ribao, the
 Xian City Cement Factory was a sorely troubled unit.
 Established in 1970, its leadership had been changed
 eight times by 1979, yet it still could not produce
 enough cement to turn a profit. The fault lay with one
 Li Naiheng, a "cement specialist " who evidently knew
 little about cement. In 1980, the Xian City party
 committee placed a vacancy notice for Li's job, and
 hired a university graduate named Hu Zhaoming to
 help get the plant in operation. Hu did so by appoint-
 ing seven other technical specialists to management
 positions, and they oversaw the repair of facilities
 and supervised production. The plant soon began
 producing high-quality cement and earning profits for
 the state.
 Li Naiheng, however, was part of an important local
 faction. Taking advantage of his connections above
 and below, he spread rumors on the shop floor, got a
 friend in the local press to spike a commendatory
 article about the new factory management, colluded
 with quality inspectors to declare the plant's output
 substandard, and ultimately persuaded the city party
 committee to recall Hu Zhaoming. After Hu's depar-
 ture, his fellow technicians were dismissed or idled.
 In their place, several people who had risen to
 prominence during the Cultural Revolution were
 appointed to direct the factory's operations, despite
 their lack of technical qualifications. The result, of
 course, was disastrous. By 1983, output was down,
 losses topped a million yuan, and the plant faced
 bankruptcy. Despite their failure, the "leftist" man-
 agers were protected by a bureau chief in the Xian
 municipal party committee, crony of Li Naiheng and
 himself a Cultural Revolution star. At the time of
 writing, despite exposes written by local and national
 magazines and newspapers, the problem had not been
 resolved. Hu Yaobang subsequently commented on
 the article, and, although we do not yet know the
 outcome in the Xian City Cement Factory, the munic-
 ipal party committee has come in for more than its
 share of central criticism in the party press.
 Revolution, and show how it prevents the effective
 implementation of economic or political reform poli-
 cies. The articles have strong "good vs. evil" over-
 tones, and make the point that factionalism is a
 product of weak leadership by implying that higher
 party authorities often do not attend to the problem
 until investigative journalists bring it to their atten-
 tion. Despite the "official expose" aspect and clear
 central guidance for discussing such problems, the
 articles are a rich source of information on factional-
 ism and, by careful reading, permit "nonofficial"
 conclusions to be drawn (see insets).
 Several characteristics of local factionalism seem to
 stand out in an analysis of these recent official
 accounts:
 ? Factions are joined by deliberate choice. Members
 are known to each other, as well as to interested
 political observers on the scene.
 ? Power is the goal; the issues over which factional
 battles are fought usually are personnel issues,
 unrelated to policy. Although purported factional-
 ists are routinely accused of policy-related short-
 comings, these are usually secondary concerns,
 though Beijing gives them propaganda priority.
 ? Factions depend for their survival on strong ties to
 higher levels of party leadership. The winners of a
 factional struggle are invariably those who have the
 more powerful backing at higher levels. The higher
 the "guanxi networks" of faction leaders extend, the
 stronger the factional unit.
 ? Factionalism is pervasive in society and is remark-
 ably resistant to cleanup efforts. Officials tasked
 with eliminating it often end up victims of factional
 intrigues. Beijing's preferred method for solving
 factional problems at local levels is to transfer
 factional leaders to other areas, thus disrupting
 their guanxi networks, although there is no report-
 ing on the overall success of this method. Punish-
 ment for factional activity is usually light, despite
 the evidence of related crimes.

 Rats in the Grain Bureau-Shuangya City,
 Heilongjiang
 A February Renmin Ribao expose by a well-known
 reformist journalist gave a detailed look at factional-
 ism in a small unit. Chief malefactors in the case
 were Yin Haijiang, secretary of the party committee
 of the Shuangya municipal grain bureau, and Duan
 Lianxi, head of the organization (personnel) section of
 the bureau. In 1978, Duan had been accused of
 Cultural Revolution crimes, including murder, but
 Yin protected him from investigation. Both had been
 members of the "upstairs faction" during the Cultur-
 al Revolution. Described as 'political and personnel
 specialists, " the upstairs faction had easily and thor-
 oughly defeated the technical experts of the "down-
 stairs faction. "
 After the Cultural Revolution, the Yin and Duan
 faction maintained and augmented their power
 through bribery and extortion. Their abuse of privi-
 lege became well known throughout the city. Extrav-
 agant dinner parties, gift-giving, and other forms of
 corruption proliferated. Investigations were done by
 various party organs, but Duan and Yin were protect-
 ed by a deputy secretary of the Shuangya City party
 committee, whose brother had been given a job by
 Duan. Over time, Duan and Yin ruined the careers of
 many of their political enemies and set back both the
 quality and quantity of flour production. Although
 they drew the attention of the Central Discipline
 Inspection Commission, the investigation dragged on
 for several years, during which time the chief investi-
 gator found himself under attack by other factional
 elements in Heilongjiang Province. The article ended
 with the implication that the case had not been
 resolved.
 ? Blatant factionalism diminishes with proximity to
 and opposition from superior authority. It also
 appears to be more prevalent and more intense at
 lower levels of bureaucracy.
 Given the party's desire to portray factionalism as a
 discipline problem left over from the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, Beijing has been considerably more circumspect
 A County Takeover in Shandong
 In February, Xinhua announced that Shandong Prov-
 ince had decided to reorganize the party committee of
 Chengwu County, which had been "controlled by a
 few people with serious factionalist influence and
 lawbreakers, who used their power to form factions
 and cliques, seek personal gains and violate law and
 discipline." Three individuals were singled out as the
 worst violators: Ai Fuhua, Lu Maijun and Cai
 Xiangcun. Cultural Revolution beneficiaries, they
 were transferred to Chengwu in 1978 and immediate-
 ly began to organize and expand a factional network.
 By 1980, when the county elected a new party com-
 mittee, they had gained enough support to be elected
 to leading positions, defeating 'four conscientious
 and honest candidates.'
 Once in office, they "abused their power to seek
 personal gains and willfully squandered and embez-
 zled state resources. " They also proceeded to ignore
 important central policy decisions, particularly in the
 area of agriculture. As a result, production suffered,
 per capita income declined, and valuable forest lands
 were destroyed. For three years, the province sent
 investigation teams to the county in response to local
 complaints, but not until the Central Discipline In-
 spection Commission investigated in late 1983 did
 anything get done. With pressure from Beijing, the
 provincial and prefectural authorities decided to
 crack down. In the end, the county magistrate, four
 members of the county party committee, and a vice
 chairman of the local people's congress were dis-
 missed from office. Only one, however, was expelled
 from the party.
 in discussing factionalism within provincial party
 committees. Provincial party committees have been
 reorganized several times since 1976, with Beijing
 always having the final word on important appoint-
 ments. The most recent reorganizations took place in
 early 1983 and brought to prominence a number of
 younger, well-educated technocrats with strong re-
 formist credentials, reportedly handpicked by Deng.
 For Beijing to admit that these new leading bodies
 had factional problems would be tantamount to adver-
 tising its own lack of influence.

 Guangxi Province: Local Factions and Central
 Support
 Scene of some of the Cultural Revolution's bloodiest
 fighting, with Red Guards stealing munitions from
 trains bound for North Vietnam, Guangxi has never
 fully recovered from its violent past. Members of the
 rival "April 22" and "headquarters"factions have
 preserved their animosities over the years. Wei
 Guoqing, a conservative Guangxi native, generally
 sided with the "headquarters"faction, but actually
 ran the province with an iron PLA hand. As he moved
 on to higher office in the party and army, ultimately
 becoming head of the PLA commissariat-the Gener-
 al Political Department, Wei appointed cronies to run
 Guangxi. Although an early Deng supporter, Wei
 reportedly grew increasingly unhappy with Deng's
 reforms. Like-minded supporters in Guangxi, believ-
 ing they had Wei's support, appear to have stymied
 the implementation of reformist economic and educa-
 tion policies in the province.
 Evidently concerned with Wei's dual support base in
 the PLA General Political Department and Guangxi,
 Deng removed Wei from his military job in late 1982,
 and reorganized the Guangxi provincial party com-
 mittee in early 1983, leaving First Secretary Qiao
 Xiaoguang as the sole surviving Wei appointee. New-
 ly appointed Deputy Secretary Wei Chunshu was put
 Provincial response to Beijing's call to publicize fac-
 tional problems has been mixed. Several provinces
 have been relatively silent, giving little publicity to
 factional problems at any level. Others, such as
 Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, have taken specific
 steps to correct factional abuses at lower levels,
 including the mass transfers of county-level officials.
 Still others, most notably Guangxi and Hunan, have
 "gone public" with their factional problems, although
 they have been very careful to avoid mentioning
 names or directly implicating current leaders. Gener-
 ally, the provinces that have discussed their factional
 problems most openly have been those whose party
 committees are documented as containing "leftist"
 supporters of Politburo members now in disgrace.F_
 in charge of party rectification in the province, with
 the additional task of resolving `problems left over
 from the Cultural Revolution. " In the face of opposi-
 tion from both factions, Wei proved unequal to the
 tasks, despite help from a large workteam dispatched
 by Beijing.
 In January 1984, Hu Yaobang visited the province for
 several weeks, and delivered direct guidance on re-
 solving the problems. In short order, the Guangxi
 party committee gave more power to Wei Chunshu,
 began criticizing its own shortcomings in rectification
 and reform, and denounced the errors of
 ';former party committees" (without directly men-
 tioning Wei Guoqing). The province's progress was
 carefully monitored in the pages of People's Daily,
 which carried reports of the arrest of several promi-
 nent Cultural Revolution leaders in March, critical
 commentaries on the province's factionalism in May,
 and finally, Qiao Xiaoguang's mild self-criticism in
 August. As this campaign progressed, Wei Guoqing
 dropped out of sight. It would not be surprising to see
 him removed from the Politburo at a future Central
 Committee meeting.
 The contrast between Guangxi Province and Fujian
 provides a striking example of Beijing's selective
 approach to exposing factional problems (see insets).
 Guangxi's party first secretary is a follower of Polit-
 buro member Wei Guoqing, whose star is currently
 declining due to his opposition to some elements of
 Deng's reform program. Guangxi's factional problems
 are discussed frequently in local and national media.
 Fujian's first secretary is a protege of General Secre-
 tary Hu Yaobang and may be slated for higher
 national office. Fujian's factional problems, no less
 serious than Guangxi's, have received very little na-
 tional media attention.

 Guangxi's power brokers: (left to right) Politburo member Wei Guoqing, Provincial Party First
 Given its organizational structure and personnel poli-
 cies, the PLA is particularly susceptible to factional-
 ism. Promotion patterns within the army would al-
 most seem to guarantee high degrees of cronyism:
 typically, an individual will stay within the same army
 corps throughout his entire career. There are numer-
 ous documented examples of commanders promoting
 their staffs along with them as they rise through the
 hierarchy. In contrast to local party units, however,
 the army until recently has staunchly rejected charges
 that it was factionalized. With regard to the Cultural
 Revolution, PLA commentaries tended to maintain
 the fiction that the army was aloof from Cultural
 Revolution struggles, that its participation in "support
 the left" activities in local areas during that period
 was ordered by Beijing, and that army officers usually
 played the role of neutral arbiter, not active partici-
 pant.
 More recent articles in PLA newspapers have admit-
 ted that the PLA's facts as well as attitudes were
 incorrect, and that the army was as immersed in
 factionalism and as guilty of serious political errors
 during the Cultural Revolution as any other group.
 Furthermore, by refusing to admit their errors, PLA
 units have tended to perpetuate them, and factional-
 ism has remained a deep-rooted problem. Army lead-
 ers have also been forced to recognize that their
 attitude won them few friends among civilians, many
 of whom suffered career or personal setbacks while
 the army was in charge.
 Most articles about factionalism in the military have
 discussed the problem in generic terms, rather than in
 detail.                     have been unable to      25X1
 provide much further information on the nature of
 factional struggles within the armed forces. Some
 local military units have admitted that they had taken
 part in "miscarriages of justice," or incorrectly sup-
 ported leftists in local governments, and have apolo-
 gized to their civilian counterparts in public meetings.
 As far as factionalism within units is concerned, the
 most explicit description of a problem has been that of  25X1
 the General Logistics Department (GLD). In late
 August, People's Daily reported that the GLD had

 Fujian Province: The Persistence of Factional Feuds
 Although the Cultural Revolution in Fujian was not
 as violent as in Guangxi, the factional rivalries were
 equally intense, and considerably more complex. In
 addition to the two primary Cultural Revolution-
 generated factions, the "red faction" and the "black
 .faction"-(which ultimately dominated), the provincial
 leadership has long been divided between the "Shanxi
 faction, " consisting of Shanxi-born officials who
 transferred to Fujian in the late 1940s, and the
 "underground faction" of native Fujianese revolu-
 tionaries. To complicate matters, Fujian is a Military
 Region (MR) headquarters, and successive MR lead-
 ers have dominated or dabbled in local politics to
 varying degrees.
 vicious factional
 infighting down to the county level; local leaders
 taking advantage of a leadership change in Beijing to
 jail opponents on trumped-up charges; fighting over
 control of economic bureaucracies to the point that
 they are immobilized. Fujian's former provincial. first
 secretary, weakened by poor health, finally quit
 trying to resolve factional difficulties after repeated
 failures.
 extensive meetings and "heart-to-heart talks" with
 division leaders, animosities and factional viewpoints
 that dated to the early part of the Cultural Revolution
 were reportedly dispelled. A People's Daily commen-
 tator praised the GLD's method of handling old
 problems as a model for the party to follow. In our
 judgment, however, most PLA participants in the
 political strife of the Cultural Revolution remain
 reluctant to admit their mistakes, and the party is
 giving the army great credit for small progress.
 Fujian's current party leader, Xiang Nan, reportedly
 has made some progress in straightening out faction-
 al squabbles. The new party committee put in place in
 early 1983 seems to have been designed to mollify the
 existing factions, while giving more power to Xiang
 and other new leaders untainted by old battles.
 Nonetheless, Xiang 's own son told US officials in
 Hong Kong that the province is still plagued by
 factionalism. The `Shanxi faction," which has resist-
 ed economic and political reform efforts, is still
 strongly represented on the provincial party commit-
 tee, and continues to hamper Xiang 's efforts to run
 the province efficiently. At the lower levels, "red" and
 "black "faction members continue to vie for power
 and privilege. Perhaps not surprisingly, Fujian's eco-
 nomic performance is not cited as a national model,
 and Xiang has publicly criticized his own perform-
 ance in economic reform. Fujian's record, however,
 has not been criticized by Beijing in the way
 Guangxi's has. Hu Yaobang, Premier Zhao Ziyang
 and other central leaders have visited the province in
 the past two years, but Xiang's performance has won
 nothing but praise.
 factional problems nationwide, media attention has
 focused on the Ministry of Coal Industry and the
 Ministry of Railways, which were claimed to have
 successfully addressed their Cultural Revolution
 problems and eliminated residual factional bitterness.
 Although in their study sessions the ministries dis-
 cussed factional problems in great detail, no accurate
 accounts have been published in the party press.

 bring the factions under control.
 most seriously affected by factional problems are the
 party Propaganda Department, the Ministry of For-
 eign Economic Relations and Trade, the Ministry of
 State Security, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 (see inset).
 Although we believe that Deng Xiaoping has effec-
 tively contained the centrifugal forces that exist with-
 in the Central Committee, and has set China on a
 course that steers clear of the social and political
 excesses that polarized the society under Mao, we do
 not believe that he has solved the problem of faction-
 alism. He has not institutionalized effective channels
 of conflict resolution, nor has he dispersed power to a
 degree that will preclude some form of power struggle
 from emerging after his death.
 In our judgment, Hu Yaobang is making important
 progress in preparing to succeed to Deng's power from
 his strong position as General Secretary. He is taking
 bold policy initiatives that enhance his reputation for
 leadership without jeopardizing his relationship with
 Deng. Hu also seems to be strengthening his own
 power base. He has placed people reputed to be his
 proteges (based on career associations in the Chinese
 Youth League) into important positions within the
 party's Secretariat, Organization Department, and
 General Office. He is strengthening his influence in
 the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and National De-
 fense through appointments of supporters to key
 positions. Although these actions improve his power
 position in the long run, they also create tensions.
 They leave him vulnerable to charges that he is
 engaging in factionalism, and, without Deng's sup-
 port, Hu might find himself faced with a Politburo
 determined to limit his powers by destroying his
 "faction."
 Hu Yaobang's power thus far has been conferred
 upon him. He has enhanced and expanded it some-
 what, but he has faced no serious challenge to his
 authority without Deng's power behind him. Hu's
 uncertain personal power base, his reputation as a
 rather impulsive leader, his association with the par-
 ty's controversial "liberal" wing, and the continued
 influence of several other senior party veterans may
 permit a reemergence of factionalism in a post-Deng
 era.
 Given our limited access to the Chinese leadership,
 and the necessary secrecy in which factions cloak
 their activity, it is unlikely that we will be able to
 develop a clear picture of post-Deng factional align-
 ments. Because factions are based on interpersonal
 relationships and guanxi networks, they can emerge
 for any number of reasons. Hu's use of his powers
 may cause an opposition faction to coalesce around
 another leader of his generation or around a party
 veteran who believes Hu to be unsuited for power.' Or
 it may involve Hu himself engaging in more obvious
 factional activity as a defense against a potential
 challenge. Another possibility is an escalation of a
 struggle between two other members of the Politburo
 that Hu was unable or unwilling to resolve, resulting
 in the polarization of the leadership.

 We do not foresee the Politburo inevitably breaking
 up into competing factions upon Deng's death. The
 policymaking process that has emerged recently
 seems to be effective and satisfactory to most of the
 Factionalization can be a slow process, a progressive
 deterioration of the cohesiveness and competence of
 the leadership over time. It appears to go through
 several stages, some of which have observable
 characteristics:
 ? Concentration on ideological or symbolic issues.
 Such issues lend themselves more easily to factional
 manipulation intended to weaken perceived oppo-
 nents. Examples could include constantly shifting
 the discussion of US-China textile disagreements to
 the question of "national dignity," or transforming a
 debate on economic reform policy into an issue of
 "socialism versus capitalism."

 Secret
 ? Heightened personalization of political discourse.
 Policies become associated with particular leaders,
 and support for those policies equates to support for
 the leader. The success or failure of the policy
 reflects less on the correctness of the policy than on
 the abilities of the leader who proposed it. Indicators
 in this phase are usually negative ones, such as
 media articles extolling the "unity and stability" of
 the central leadership in the face of rumors to the
 contrary. Historical allegories about leaders of past
 dynasties may also appear.
 ? Polarization of the leadership. Opposition becomes
 programmatic-a "two-line struggle;" interpersonal
 tensions are beyond mediation or meaningful coop-
 eration between two factions; neutral leaders are put
 under increasing pressure to choose sides. Factions
 become more open in this phase and may be given
 descriptive names. Policies become more cautious;
 important personnel decisions may be delayed.
 ? Plots and intrigues. Personnel issues become dead-
 locked; bureaucratic vacancies cannot be filled.
 Factions are clearly known. All parties try to ensure
 some form of physical security, either through pub-
 lic security or military forces. Political activity
 increases in all bureaucracies, as factional networks
 spread downward. The entire decisionmaking proc-
 ess becomes paralyzed pending the outcome of the
 struggle.
 ? Denouement. The battle is joined when one faction
 is convinced it has the power necessary to defeat its
 opposition. This usually takes place at a Politburo or
 expanded Politburo meeting. The losers suffer some
 form of political disgrace, including being charged
 with factionalism.
 The party's current effort to "eradicate" factionalism
 is indicative of the scope and seriousness of the
 problem at all levels of China's bureaucracies. Beijing
 is clearly aware that factions have done enormous
 damage to the political system since the Cultural
 Revolution by:
 ? Obstructing policy implementation.
 ? Blocking effective communication upward in the
 bureaucracy.
 ? Promoting corrupt and incompetent personnel while
 preventing better educated persons from becoming
 cadre.
 ? Engaging in flagrant abuse of power and corruption,
 thereby damaging the party's prestige.

 has, or will he face a factional challenge?
 Given the tendency of factionalism to recede in the
 face of power exerted from above and the shaming
 effect of national publicity, we believe Beijing's anti
 factionalism campaign will achieve a measure of
 success in improving bureaucratic performance at
 lower levels. To the degree that deep animosities left
 over from the Cultural Revolution are ameliorated,
 the party's purposes will also be well served. In our
 judgment, however, factionalism is too pervasive in
 society to be quickly eliminated by a party publicity
 campaign.
 Despite its prevalence in the society at large, faction-
 alism does not appear to be a serious problem within
 the current Politburo leadership. Deng Xiaoping has
 established workable, stable policymaking procedures
 that have reduced interpersonal tensions within the
 system by dispersing power to several bureaucracies.
 He has also shifted more authority away from the
 Politburo to the younger, more activist and cohesive
 party Secretariat. By virtue of his own political
 strength, Deng has quelled the emergence of power-
 seeking factions at the top.
 Hu's prospects for maintaining a leadership group in
 which factionalism plays a limited role will depend
 upon political changes still to be accomplished by the
 Deng reform coalition. If Hu can bring more of his
 supporters and fellow reformists into the Secretariat
 and Politburo (that is, strengthen his own potential
 faction) and succeed to Deng's real power position, he
 may be able to prevent opposition from coalescing. If
 current reformist policies continue to achieve satisfac-
 tory results, the regime may be able to dampen the
 kinds of recriminations and blame-laying that accom-
 pany failed policies and sometimes degenerate into
 factionalism. If Deng can bring about the true retire-
 ment of a significant number of the aged veterans who
 still dominate the Politburo, potential post-Deng fac-
 tional networks will be diminished in strength. These
 are formidable challenges for Deng and Hu, and are
 the essence of their political reform program. The
 more successful they are in achieving their political
 goals, the more likely the regime will be able to
 contain the impulse to factionalism that has hampered
 China's political and economic development in the
 past.
 The linkage between factional politics and any partic-
 ular policy issue is often difficult to draw. Factions
 tend to coalesce over power and personnel questions,
 rather than specific issue areas. Differences over
 specific policies can contribute to the factionalization
 process, as disagreements among Chinese leaders tend
 to get personalized readily, but a single policy issue is
 unlikely to precipitate a full-scale factional battle.
 This is particularly true of foreign policy issues, which
 are handled by a smaller number of senior officials
 who think in geopolitical terms and generally seek to
 insulate foreign policy from the push and pull of
 domestic politics.
 The Chinese, in fact, have played occasionally on
 Western concerns about their factionalism to gain
 tactical advantages in dealing with bilateral problems.
 An example of this sort of manipulation occurred in
 1982, when Chinese diplomats hinted that Deng's
 position would be jeopardized if the United States
 decided to sell advanced fighters to Taiwan. We also
 believe that hints from Chinese officials that "faction-
 al infighting" was the cause of a policy position
 unfavorable to the United States should be viewed
 with skepticism.

 Secret
 This is not to say that foreign policy questions are
 immune to factional considerations. The handling of
 China's foreign policy could become part of factional
 infighting, particularly as a leader under pressure for
 other reasons might be blamed for perceived failings
 in the management of China's foreign relations. Given
 their high emotional content, some aspects of Sino-US
 relations could get drawn into an ongoing factional
 squabble, with accompanying rhetorical excess on the
 part of the Chinese. We believe, however, that this
 need not be cause for great concern. Even if factional-
 ism within the Politburo shifts the balance of power
 among the leaders, this will not inevitably affect
 Chinese leaders' perceptions of their national interest,
 or of the nature and direction of their relationship
 with the United States. In the past, major factional
 changes have taken place without any great shifts in
 Chinese foreign policy, and, conversely, major
 changes in Chinese foreign policy have been made
 without any factional realignment.
