 KOREA:   Situation Report
 The North Korean proposal at the meeting of the Mili-
 tary Armistice Commission yesterday seems designed to demon-
 strate that Pyongyang is seeking a constructive approach to re-
 ducing tensions. The North Koreans described their proposal to
 separate the security personnel of both sides in the Joint Se-
 curity Area as a way to avert further incidents.
 Approved F4
 Approved For Rele
 I         I According to the North Korean statement, all previous
 inci en s were "directly related" to the fact that opposing
 military personnel must "stand face to face" or "pass by" the
 other side's guard posts.
 The North Koreans,  in effect,  are taking up a pro-
 posal                  or a separation of personnel made by the UN Command in
 1953 and again in 1970. At present, the UN Command has no guard
 posts in the North Korean portion of the Joint Security Area.
 Thus,  it appears that it would only require the North Koreans
 to pull their guard posts back in order to implement their
 proposal.
 In addition to creating a favorable impression abroad
 of North Korean "reasonableness," the proposal probably is aimed
 at deflecting attention from the UN Command's demands for North
 Korean assurances that the safety of UN personnel be protected
 and that freedom of movement for both sides in the Joint Secu-
 rity Area will be respected.
 I          I Pyongyang may calculate that acceptance by the UN
 Command of the proposal could be portrayed as acquiescence in
 President Kim I1-song's call last Friday for joint efforts to
 prevent a recurrence of the incident of August 18.  On the other
 hand, the North Koreans may believe that rejection of the pro-
 posal by the UN, pending North Korean assurances on the safety
 of UN personnel, would leave the UN Command vulnerable to
 charges that it was unwilling to accept a reasonable measure
 to avert further incidents.
 During the meeting yesterday,  the North Koreans re-
 peatedly turned aside inquiries about the assault last week,
 asserting that the subject had been adequately treated in Kim
 Il-song's message which termed the incident "regrettable" but
 evaded the question of responsibility.
 Probably with an eye toward the large press represen-
 tation from the West,  the North Koreans were on their best be-
 havior at the meeting, which was businesslike and devoid of the  25X1
 customary communist invective.

 CHINA:   Anti-Teng Economics
 Economic factors may be working to the advantage of
 Peking moderates in their efforts to hold in check the campaign
 against former vice premier Teng Hsiao-ping and his supporters.
 I          IA People's Daily editorial published Monday appears
 to reflect a growing concern within the Chinese leadership over
 the effects of the campaign on industrial production.  It calls
 for tighter party control over anti-Teng activities,  for more
 leniency in dealing with other alleged "capitalist roaders,"
 and for an end to factionalism.  It is also the first editorial
 since early April that has repeated an injunction against form-
 ing "fighting groups."
 The guidelines in the editorial take the hardest line
 against disruptive activities since Teng first came under at-
 tack and they may reflect rising moderate influence. While wide-
 spread disorders would not seem to be in the interest of the
 radical faction, the left has often appeared to condone, if not
 encourage,  a certain amount of ferment at the grassroots level
 as a means of exerting pressure on political opponents.
 Campaign-related factionalism and wall poster attacks
 on provincial leaders have been evident in a number of places
 for some time, particularly in Fukien and Chekiang.

 out of sight for some time have reappeared.  In Fukien, the re-
 emergence of first party secretary Liao Chih-kao was accompanied
 by a high-level provincial party meeting seeking a solution to
 the chronic factionalism there.
 I        I The recent series of earthquakes in China have also
 probably worked to the advantage of the moderates.  In the wake
 of these disasters, moderates are undoubtedly contending that
 substantial industrial losses make it even more imperative that
 production receive higher priority.  This argument seemed to be
 tacitly acknowledged in a People's Daily editorial two weeks
 ago which warned against using the quake to divert attention
 from the anti-Teng campaign.
 //In addition, the moderates may now be in a
 e   er position to defend certain economic policies closely as-
 sociated with Tena which are under radical fire.
 The pace of whole-plant imports and raw-material ex-
 ports has been a major bone of contention in Peking's leader-
 ship for some time.  In this regard, the fifth Five-Year Plan,
 which was scheduled to take effect last Januar ,  has yet to be
 finalized.

 Conservative whites have retained control of the
 Namibian branch of South Africa's ruling National Party in an
 election held Tuesday,  the opening day of the branch party's
 annual congress.
 I     I Moderates in the party,  led by Deputy Chairman Dirk
 Mudge, had been privately predicting that they would wrest con-
 trol from the conservative chairman, A. H.  du Plessis. Both
 men were re-elected to their posts.
 The outcome of the election casts serious doubt on
 the future of the plan for Namibian independence released last
 week by a committee of the multiracial constitutional confer-
 ence. That plan called for an interim government and indepen-
 dence by December 31,  1978.  It is supported by the white mod-
 erates, but is opposed by conservatives who are not reconciled
 to losing control of the territory.
 I     I The US embassy in Pretoria believes that South Afri-
 can Prime Minister Vorster privately intervened to see that
 the plan was publicized, but he was not willing to see an
 open party split. The ambiguities of the plan and the outcome
 of the party election can be used by Vorster to reassure Nami-
 bia's white settlers that Pretoria will not be stampeded into
 precipitate action on the future of the territory.                        25X1
 A long-standing dispute over exchange rates is threat-
 ening to damage the close political relationship between India
 and the USSR.
 I      I An official of the Indian External Affairs Ministry
 w nose responsibilities include relations with the USSR told US
 embassy officials on Monday that he did not expect an agreement
 to come from negotiations slated to take place in New Delhi next
 week on the Soviets'  demand for a new rate favorable to Moscow.

 I                 IThe official indicated his government is prepared to
 agree    o a new rate for future transactions, but opposes retro-
 active application of any change.  The Indians claim they stand
 to lose about $500 million if a new rate is applied to outstand-
 ing Soviet loans.
 I             lAccording to the official, the Indian government con-
 siders t e issue to be of great political as well as economic
 significance and will not succumb to Soviet pressure. He added
 that "very senior people" in the Indian government are ready to
 accept a major change in Indo-Soviet relations, such as a re-
 duction in Indian arms purchases and bilateral trade,  if Moscow
 does not back down.
 I                                                 Ithe Indians are increas-
 ing y   issa is ie  wi    numerous aspects of Indo-Soviet economic
 relations.  Repeated Indian attempts to secure from Moscow more
 advantageous terms on aid and trade have been largely unsuccess-
 ful. New Delhi's frustration--at a time when Indian planners
 are trying to spur economic development and have come to recog-
 nize the limitations of Soviet aid--probably partially accounts
 for the emotional overtones that have surrounded the rupee-
 ruble issue.
 The Indian official could be overstating the willing-
 ness o    is government to accept a major change in its relation-
 ship with Moscow. Prime Minister Gandhi is unlikely to take any
 action that would abruptly jeopardize relations with India's
 major arms supplier.
 Gandhi has, however, permitted a gradual cooling in
 Pakistan, and the US.  Such factors probably are encouraging
 the Indians to stand up to the USSR on a matter in which they

 Talks between Prime Minister Miki,  Deputy Prime Min-

 Approved For Re
 I            lAs the Prime Minister's recognized successor, Fukuda
 holds the key role in the oust-Miki campaign and his explicit
 consent is mandatory to any action by the party to remove Miki.
 The caucus of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party adopted a mo-
 tion yesterday calling for "freshening the party leadership"--
 a codeword for Miki's removal--but refrained from passing a
 specific no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister for
 the time being.
 I      I Fukuda has preferred all along that Miki be removed
 by negotiation rather than as a result of an open party battle.
 He may well find the idea of Miki's voluntary resignation at-
 tractive even at the price of a few additional weeks in office
 for the Prime Minister.,
 Like Ohira, however, Fukuda is well aware that allow-
 ing   i i to convene the Diet offers him a number of opportuni-
 ties to extend his political life. Miki could,  for example, use
 the expected opposition of the left wing to the pending fiscal
 bills to delay their passage for weeks, thereby diminishing both
 the mood and the time available for any change in leadership be-
 fore the general election.
 I     I Even so, Fukuda and Ohira hold the balance of power       25X1

 resolution designed to placate Greece without unduly antago-
 nizing Turkey.
 25X1                         The resolution urges both parties to exercise re-
 straint' calls on them to resume direct negotiations,  and re-
 minds them of the role the International Court of Justice could
 play in settling their remaining differences.

 Passed by consensus, the resolution was the result
 o  near y two weeks of hard bargaining. The Greeks originally
 sought strong references to Turkish seismic exploration in con-
 tested areas and to international adjudication. The Turks
 fought hard to dilute such references after they failed to fend
 off a formal resolution.
 Greek Prime Minister Caramanlis expressed satisfac-
 tion wit                           the resolution--especially its reference to the
 Court--and called on Turkey to abide by its recommendations.
 Caramanlis has staked his prestige on his simultaneous appeals
 to the Security Council and the International Court.
 After adoption of the resolution Caglayangil said his
 government still held that there was no need for the measure.
 He added that Athens'  unilateral application to The Hague
 Court was contrary to the spirit of the resolution and said
 that in this instance Turkey will not recognize Court action
 as binding. The Turks have declined to participate in the
 Court's hearings on the Greek appeal which began on Wednesday.
 Turkish Foreign Ministry sources yesterday were quoted as
 saying that to do so would merely give legitimacy to the Greek
 case.
 The continued tension resulting from the Aegean dis-
 pute may be spilling over into Cyprus, where there apparently
 was a serious violation of the cease-fire by Turkish forces in
 Nicosia yesterday.  Turkish troops also advanced at several
 points into the UN-patrolled neutral area separating the two

 President Giscard yesterday named Raymond Barre to
 succeed Jacques Chirac,who resigned as prime minister after
 disagreements with the President over government policy and
 political strategy. A new cabinet is to be named by the end of
 the week.
 I      I Barre, who is 52 years old, has no political affilia-

 jority" when he was named minister of foreign commerce last
 January.
 I     I Barre's appointment does not appear to indicate that
 the President is ready to break with the Gaullists. The cabinet
 shuffle may be a holding action,  caused by Chirac's determina-
 tion to get out.  Some reports indicate that Giscard would have
 preferred to wait until after the municipal elections next
 March to make major changes.
 In a press conference after naming the new prime min-
 ister, Giscard indicated that Barre would be carrying out the
 President's instructions rather than initiating policy. Giscard
 also noted that the appointment reflects his desire to combine
 all parties of the governing majority into a "presidential ma-
 jority" and eventually to form a center-left government.
 I             The choice of Barre, an economics expert,  indicates
 that the new government will tackle more vigorously the problems
 of inflation, unemployment, and monetary stability that are of
 primary concern to the citizens and a crucial factor in the
 coalition's survival in the next legislative election.

 The USSR for the first time publicly acknowledged in-
 creased tension between. Libya and Egypt.  In a broadcast on Tues-
 day, the Soviets replayed Libyan denials of complicity in the
 hijacking of an Egyptian aircraft earlier this week.
 The Soviets avoided suggesting either that Egypt was
 responsible for the incident or that it was seeking pretext for
 action against Libya.
 The broadcast did not mention incidents between the
 two countries--Egypt's anti-Qadhafi rhetoric, or Cairo's blam-
 ing Libya for the hijacking incident. The broadcast charged
 that Israel and its backers were seeking to use such incidents
 to divide the Arab World.
 I     I The broadcast commented positively about alleged ef-
 orts to improve relations between Libya and Egypt and reproached
 Cairo for not doing more in this regard.  This reproach, by So-
 viet standards,  is mild given the USSR's poor state of relations
 with Egypt and its relatively better relations with Libya.
 The USSR may be disinclined to get too closely asso-
 ciated with Libya and Qadhafi, particularly in view of his more
 adventuristic statements and actions in recent months.
 I            IEgypt late last night accused Libya of kidnaping on
 Tuesday two Egyptian security men from an Egyptian-chartered
 airliner at Tripoli airport.  According to an Egyptian statement
 the plane was chartered from a US company and carried an Ameri-
 can crew. Egypt called the incident an "act of air piracy" and
 warned it would take appropriate but   nspecified countermeasures.
