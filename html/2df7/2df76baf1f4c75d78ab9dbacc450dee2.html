 China and Western Europe:          An Overview
 The Chinese and the West Europeans view their steadily
 expanding relationship from very different perspectives.
 For Peking, two considerations are dominant:                rapid eco-
 nomic development and greater security vis-a-vis the
 Soviets.   After years of insisting that China must rely
 mainly on its own resources for development, the Chinese
 are now making up for lost time.   Their delegations are
 crisscrossing Europe with long shopping lists (including
 military items), economic agreements are proliferating,
 and hundreds of students will be sent to Europe over the
 next few months.   In the security area, Peking is making
 clear at every opportunity the importance it attaches to
 the containment of the Soviets and its concern that weak-
 ness in the Atlantic Alliance is undermining this effort.
 For the Europeans there are many secondary motives,
 but the driving force is commercial.   Few Europeans suf-
 fer from the illusion that there is a vast and easily
 exploited market in China, but they all know that sig-
 nificant opportunities do exist; and given Western Europe's
 current economic situation, the opportunities look par-
 ticularly enticing to them.   To the extent that security
 considerations enter their calculations, the lessons they
 draw are ambivalent.   They recognize that bolstering the
 Chinese makes sense in terms of the international power
 balance--and also could open up diplomatic opportunities
 for them in their relations with the Soviets.  At the same
 time, many of them are concerned over the possibility of
 an adverse reaction from Moscow.
 Nowhere is West European ambivalence more notice-
 able than in the area of arms sales.   These are often
 particularly lucrative, and they have an obvious appeal
 to those who emphasize Europe's interest in helping China
 become a more effective counterweight to the Soviets.  Yet
 deals in this field have the greatest potential for pro-
 ducing an unpleasant Soviet response.   Soviet President
 Brezhnev tried to play on these concerns in letters last

 month to London, Paris, and Bonn--although he  too, dis-
 played a degree of caution
 The Soviets probably recognize that they will be
 unable to prevent the expansion of Sino - West European
 ties, including those in the arms field.   The pace of
 expansion is likely to be gradual for other reasons,
 however, and China will remain a small market for European
 industry.   The Chinese have consistently proven to be
 sticky negotiators, and they are asking for things which
 the Europeans will often be reluctant to give:   the sale
 of weapons production technology,  for example.  Even more
 important, China's ability either to pay for or to absorb
 the goods it wants is limited.   Both the Chinese and the
 West Europeans, moreover, have other foreign policy con-
 cerns that loom much larger than Sino - West European
 relations, and neither the leaders in Peking nor those in
 Europe are likely to put too much faith in a nexus of this
 But the expansion, gradual though it may be, also
 seems irreversible--barring another sea change in Chinese
 policy.   The Europeans will remain nervous about the Soviets,
 and while recognizing that they are in competition with
 each other (and with the United States), they will at the
 same time be reluctant to move too far ahead of each other
 in such a sensitive field as arms.   Commercial advantage
 will remain the dominant consideration, however, and a
 slow growth in Sino - West European commerce in such sen-
 sitive fields as weapons technology and nuclear power is
 almost certain.   West Germany, France, the UK, and Italy
 will probably get the lion's share of China's business,
 both military and otherwise, but smaller countries such as
 Switzerland and the Nordic countries will also obtain a
 piece of the action.  II
 The pace of the expansion is not likely to be af-
 fected much by the establishment of diplomatic relations
 between China and the United States.   If anything, this

 development is likely to accelerate the Europeans'
 efforts, both because they will consider that it
 enhances the respectability of doing business with Peking
 and because they almost certainly anticipate more active
 competition from the US in the future.

 China - Western Europe:   From Peking's Perspective
 II
 China expects to draw heavily on Western Europe as
 a source of modern industrial equipment, technology,
 and expertise and to use the region as a vital element
 in a strategy of counterbalancing the USSR on a global
 scale.   Chinese officials miss few chances to warn the
 West Europeans about the peril Moscow poses to the West
 and to encourage a strong, united Western Europe firm
 in its opposition to Soviet expansionism.   Conversely,
 the Chinese are quick to criticize what they interpret
 as the slightest sign of "appeasement" on the part of
 the West Europeans.   This encouragement of anti-Sovietism
 goes beyond European regional concerns to encouragement
 of greater West European cooperation with the Third world,
 particularly in Africa and the Middle East.   For example,
 earlier this year the Chinese were approving of French
 aid to President Mobutu to repel the second Katangan
 invasion of Zaire.   Peking also hopes for closer rela-
 tions between Western Europe and Japan in the interest
 of containing the Soviets.
 This does not mean that Peking wants to encourage
 West European unity, strength, and independence at the
 expense of Western European ties to the United States.
 On the contrary, though uncertainty about US steadfast-
 ness produces an occasional note of ambivalence in Pe-
 king's statements, the Chinese generally emphasize the
 indispensability of the United States, in the mainte-
 nance of NATO and the defense of Western Europe.   "Neu-
 tralization" of the region, with its concomitant damage
 to US - Western European relations, would be a severe
 blow to Peking.
 The anti-Soviet orientation of China's attitude
 toward Western Europe has contributed to Peking's con-
 tinuing ambivalence toward the major "Eurocommunist"
 parties.   Although there have been tentative signs this
 year that the Chinese are rethinking their policy toward
 these parties, Peking's suspicion of their continued
 links to the Soviets has continued to inhibit Chinese-
 Eurocommunist rapprochement.

 Increasing Sino - West European trade, with the
 prospect of greater increases to come, provides tangible
 content to the more problematical and slower developing
 political relationship.   So far this year Peking has
 signed a trade agreement with the EC and a long-term
 economic cooperation agreement with France.  Various
 types of long-term agreements with Italy, West Germany,
 and Great Britain are under consideration.  During the
 same period, China also has concluded scientific and
 technical cooperation agreements with France, Italy, West
 Germany, and Britain.   Chinese delegations of all sorts
 have crisscrossed Europe in increasing numbers.   China
 also is turning to Western Europe as a source of educa-
 tion necessary to improve and expand its pool of scien-
 tists and engineers.   Large numbers of Chinese students
 eventually will study at European institutions.
 Western Europe will continue to be a major supplier
 of plants and equipment for China's modernization drive,
 although the Europeans face stiff competition from Japan
 and--potentially--the United States.   Peking is interested
 in purchasing a wide range of industrial goods, including
 steel mills, petrochemical plants, thermal and nuclear
 power stations, truck plants, and mining equipment.   By
 purchasing technology from various West European countries
 the Chinese will avoid overdependence on one source, gain
 access to US technology produced in Western Europe under
 license, and promote competition in price and financing
 terms among potential suppliers.   They also hope to en-
 courage West European governments to press for revision
 of strategic trade controls.
 China's military interest in Western Europe goes
 beyond urging that the region look to its own military
 strength vis-a-vis the USSR.   Peking is interested in
 purchasing modern arms and military technology, including
 such items as antitank missiles, helicopters, and combat
 aircraft.   During the past year, Chinese military dele-
 gations have visited every major national armaments in-
 dustry in Western Europe.                            Moreover, China is attempting
 to create the impression of a military relationship be-
 tween Western Europe and China through visits by West
 European military delegations to Peking, exemplified by
 the publicity given by the Chinese press to the visit
 last April of`the chief of the British defense staff.

 China's opening to Western Europe still faces major
 economic obstacles, and there remain important differences
 over political subjects, particularly detente.  Neverthe-
 less, barring a political upheaval in Peking that might
 bring to power a more inward looking, less pragmatic
 leadership, the o enin  is likely to continue and will
 probably widen.

 EC:   A Long, Long March Toward Increased Trade With
 China
 A spate of contacts, rumored deals, and negotiations
 on trade agreements highlights the European Community's
 scramble to profit from China's decision to turn again
 to Western suppliers for technology and equipment.   The
 two-way flow of commodities and cash, however, remains
 small.   Increases implied in recent agreements are on
 the order of 15-20 percent per year through the mid-
 1980s--a feasible target starting from current low
 levels.
 Except for the problems involved in sales of military
 equipment and nuclear technology, constraints on in-
 creased EC-China trade are largely on the Chinese side--
 primarily China's limited ability to pay for and absorb
 the goods offered.  While China may now be willing to
 accept conventional foreign credits, Peking still wants
 to offset imports with exports of Chinese commodities.
 0
 For the West Europeans, the key obstacle to meeting
 trade goals will be finding suitable Chinese products
 at competitive prices.   Soviet displeasure with growing
 EC-China trade, and particularly with the prospect of
 Chinese arms purchases, may affect EC relations with both
 China and the USSR.   The West Europeans will consider the
 Soviet angle, as well as US policy, in responding to
 Chinese requests for goods considered sensitive.   Although
 a turning point appears to have been reached, frustratingly
 long and difficult negotiations loom for the West Euro-
 peans; regardless of the outcome, China will remain a
 small market for West European industry.  II
 EC-China Trade Ties
 The EC Commission has sole authority to set general
 rules for trade between member states and outsiders.   Com-
 mercial arrangements are left up to individual member

 states whose bilateral accords cannot specify or eliminate
 quotas or provide for preferential trading arrangements.
 In November 1974, the EC offered to negotiate trade agree-
 ments with state-trading countries, including China.
 Following mutual diplomatic recognition in 1975, China
 responded favorably to the EC invitation.  An agreement
 was tentatively approved in September 1977 and formally
 signed in Brussels last spring.   The five-year, non-
 preferential agreement contains a weak most-favored-nation
 clause; a "balance trade" clause, according to which the
 two sides promise to make "best efforts" to expand trade
 at similar rates; a safeguard clause, which provides for
 "friendly consultations" in case of EC difficulties with
 Chinese goods and which tacitly recognizes an EC right
 to apply specific restrictions if difficulties persist;
 and a clause designed to prevent Chinese sales at prices
 well below market levels.
 The agreement allows the EC to maintain its current
 restrictions on selected Chinese goods while calling for
 the Community to liberalize imports from China as much
 as possible.   For its part, China promises to take im-
 ports from the EC into "favorable consideration," a
 promise hailed by the West Europeans as a Chinese con-
 cession not previously granted to any trading partner.
 The agreement also establishes a joint EC-China Economic
 Commission to review progress in promoting trade.   The
 initial meeting of the Commission will be held in the
 first half of 1979.
 Exports from the EC to China reached $1.4 billion
 in 1975 but by 1977 had fallen back below $1 billion.
 Even in 1975, however, exports to China represented
 less than 0.5 percent of total exports by EC countries,
 or about 1 percent of sales outside the Community.
 China's share of imports by EC countries was only about
 0.3 percent.   Both market shares were well below the
 levels of the early 1960s.
 Over the past two years, a flurry of Chinese delega-
 tions has descended on Western Europe.   At each stop,
 the missions have looked, poked, prodded, and made
 various--sometimes overlapping or contradictory--promises
 to government and business officials.  Very few major
 contracts have been signed. Nevertheless, a quiet but
 sharp increase in trade has occurred.  In the first half

 of 1978, EC shipments to China ran close to the total
 for all of last year.   Over the full year, EC exports
 to China no doubt have broken the 1975 record.
 Major European Traders
 West Germany
 The West Germans have been less active than their
 EC partners in obtaining an all-encompassing trade agree-
 ment with China, possibly because West Germany outsells
 the rest of its EC partners combined.  Nevertheless,
 West Germany agreed in November to begin discussions
 leading toward an economic cooperation agreement.  West
 Germany recently won the first major West European
 contract from the Chinese since the current buying round
 began.   It calls for a West German consortium to provide
 approximately $4 billion in know-how and equipment to
 modernize the Chinese coal mining and coal mining equip-
 ment industries.  While financing details still must be
 worked out, a West German bank consortium apparently
 will provide credit with five- to 10-year terms.   The
 West Germans have also signed contracts for the construc-
 tion of five petrochemical plants.   A rumored $14 billion
 contract for West German construction of an integrated
 steel complex will probably be split among suppliers in
 several countries, including Japan and perhaps France,
 the UK, and Italy.
 France
 France's independent foreign policy stance makes
 Paris the obvious first point of contact for the Chinese
 in Western Europe.   As with Franco-Soviet ties,  however,
 the "special relationship" provides only limited trade
 advantages for France.  Although at the forefront in
 negotiations and publicity, the French consistently run
 a poor second to West Germany when final contracts are
 signed and deliveries made.
 In the current round of Sino-European trade talks,
 France was the first to obtain formal signature of a new
 bilateral trade agreement.   The pact, signed in Peking
 on 4 December by French Foreign Trade Minister Deniau,
 calls for total two-way trade of $13.5 billion in 1979-85.
 The agreement also stipulates that "best efforts" be made

 Approved For Release 2006//TCIA-RDP79T00912A001600010016-5
 to balance trade, and France has promised to make $6.75
 billion worth of credits available for its exports,
 probably at interest rates of 7.25-7.50 percent.   The
 credits, reportedly repayable in 10 years, will be made
 available only as contracts are signed.
 Specific sectors mentioned in the agreement as being
 of priority interest to the Chinese include steel,
 electrical energy (nuclear, hydroelectric, and thermal),
 mining research, hotels, port facilities, aviation,
 agricultural machinery, rail transport, and oil.   Pro-
 jects listed as being in advanced stages of negotiations--
 and for which French firms will receive "preference"
 from Peking if all competitive and technical considera-
 tions are equal--include a steel complex, a magnesium
 plant, a specialty steels plant, a sugar refinery, and
 an aluminum complex.   The most publicized project connec-
 ted with the trade package is a Chinese commitment to
 purchase two nuclear power plants, which would be built
 by the French under US license.   France has pledged not
 to sell the plants until US approval is obtained.   China
 is pushing for French arms sales not spelled out in the
 agreement, particularly deliveries of missiles and pos-
 United Kingdom
 A draft UK-China trade agreement was drawn up during
 Chinese Deputy Premier Wang Chen's visit to the UK in
 November.   The draft contains a target of $10 billion
 in total two-way trade during the period 1979-85.   The
 signing of the agreement is planned for Industry Minister
 Eric Varley's trip to Peking next April.   The pact lists
 12 sectors of key interest to the Chinese, largely du-
 plicating the French-Chinese list.   One potential problem
 is that conclusion of the agreement may hinge on a British
 decision to sell the vertical-takeoff Harrier aircraft.
 The full extent of British credits apparently is
 still being worked out.  A consortium of banks reportedly
 agreed on 6 December to lend the Bank of China a total
 of $1.2 billion, with repayment in about five years and
 an interest rate of 7.25 percent.   According to the press,
 the funding will work exactly like a standard buyers'

 credit, with the money released to the Bank of China and
 then to British companies as sales are made.   The credits
 will be guaranteed by the British Government.
 Italy
 Italian companies have a relatively long history of
 activity in China, particularly in oil and petrochemical
 equipment sales.   Italy was the first EC member to sign
 a trade agreement with China, in 1971.   That three-year
 agreement contained a general list of goods to be traded,
 provided most-favored-nation treatment (with exception for
 EC obligations), and established a joint commission to
 meet at least once a year to review progress.   No specific
 trade target was set.
 The Italians are negotiating a new trade agreement
 with China and hope to conclude it early next year.   Given
 the French and British precedents, a target two-way trade
 goal will probably be specified through 1985.   One deal
 currently being discussed with the Chinese would involve
 Fiat construction of a tractor plant.   In the long term,
 Fiat hopes to participate in a complex producing trucks
 and diesel engines.   The Italian state oil company, ENI,
 hopes to play a role in Chinese oil development.   Italy
 has already offered China a $1 billion line of credit,
 although details have not been worked out and probably
 will not be decided until specific contract negotiations
 are further advanced.
 Sorting Out the Potential Market
 A summation of current Chinese agreements and
 negotiations involves the danger of double-counting.
 The Chinese are not averse to--and are rather adept at--
 negotiating with several countries for the same items
 at the same time.   For example, aluminum and steel
 complexes head the lists of potential contracts with both
 France and West Germany.   France appears to have the
 inside track on the initial aluminum contracts while,
 within Western Europe, West Germany could be the first
 to supply steel equipment. Both the UK and France hope
 to participate in coal modernization plans, but West
 Germany has already won the lion's share of the early
 contracts in this field.   France and Italy both are
 confident of winning vehicle plant contracts, and all

 Even after allowing for double-counting, China's
 1976-85 modernization plan could entail a substantial

 -- Ten steel plant complexes.
 -- Nine nonferrous metal plants.
 -- Eight coal fields.
 -- Ten new oil and gas fields.
 -- Thirty electric power plants.
 -- Six major railway networks.
 -- Five major ports.
 Compensation and Balanced Trade
 Compensation and balanced trade are constant themes
 in talks with the Chinese.  Most negotiations commence
 with Chinese offers to pay for oil exploration and equip-
 ment with crude oil,  for coal mining equipment  and
 technology with coal, and so forth.  Western Europe's
 response has been skeptical, questioning just how much
 China has to offer. While China's crude oil reserves,
 for example, may be great, the West Europeans note that
 Chinese crude is not well suited to their refineries
 because of its high paraffin content.   In addition,
 Peking thus far refuses to discount its price to  make
 Chinese crude competitive with Arab oil that is closer
 to Western Europe.   Italy and France have agreed to buy
 small test shipments of Chinese crude and both have
 hinted at larger purchases in the future.   Italy has
 mentioned the possibility of taking up to 20,000 barrels
 per day in 1979.   A truly significant increase in pur-
 chases, however, depends on Wropean refining results
 and Chinese price decisions.

 Peking has naturally raised questions about increased
 West European imports of Chinese manufactured goods and
 liberalization of Western Europe's tariff and quota re-
 strictions on Chinese products.  Despite the EC-China
 trade agreement, liberalization will be slow in coming.
 It is likely to be particularly slow for textiles, a
 sector in which West European firms are already suffering
 from foreign competition, overcapacity, and high un-
 employment.  II
 The possibility of West European firms obtaining
 access to China's huge and presumably low-cost labor
 force for subcontracting and assembly operations--somewhat
 along the lines of the Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong
 models--is being explored.   Although the Chinese until
 now have disdained such operations, associating them
 with colonialism and exploitation, these activities could
 Credits and Direct Investment
 For many years China has adamantly refused to accept
 overt foreign credits.   Suppliers' credits, euphemistically
 referred to as "deferred payments" by the Chinese, have
 been used to finance plant purchases.   The Chinese, how-
 ever, have now agreed to buyer's credits from France and
 the UK.   In addition, a thinly disguised form of debt
 has operated fairly efficiently, whereby the Bank of
 China has accepted foreign currency in interest-paying
 deposits and drawn on the deposits to pay for imports.
 Although deposits have been limited to about one year,
 two-five year deposits are now being considered; five-
 10 year credits of this type may result from current
 contract and financing negotiations.
 Just how far China will go in accepting standard com-
 mercial credits and other financial schemes cannot be
 predicted.   The Chinese have given conflcting signals
 on the issue, probably because the leadership is still
 formulating a decision.  West European bankers and
 government officials would prefer to use standard com-
 mercial loans or lines of credit rather than the deposit
 scheme.  With a regular line of credit, West European
 banks would have use of the funds until called upon by
 the Chinese, and government guarantees would be easier

 China and Western Europe:   Some Organizational Aspects
 The story of increasing Chinese - West European
 relations has unfolded in multilateral organizations as
 well as in the bilateral dealings of individual West
 European states with China.   The West European approach
 so far has been positive but cautious, largely out of
 fear that West European relations with the Soviet Union
 might be damaged.   The West European treatment of Chinese
 relations in the EC and NATO--and China's approach to
 these organizations--has, naturally enough, differed
 because of the differing purposes the organizations them-
 selves are designed to serve.
 In the case of both the EC and NATO, China has
 voiced strong support for the organizations' goals:
 increased integration for the Community and a strong de-
 fense against the Soviets for NATO.  With the EC, how-
 ever, it has been both necessary and desirable from the
 Chinese point of view to go beyond verbal support:  nec-
 essary, because the EC Commission must negotiate trade
 agreements with outsiders; desirable, because the Chinese
 think a more economically, politically, and militarily
 integrated Europe cannot help but be troublesome to the
 The West Europeans, for their part, are interested
 in trade with China and intrigued by the Chinese support
 for integration; at the same time, they are aware of the
 potential for irritating the Soviets that is inherent in
 stronger EC-Chinese ties.  Hence the caution in the West
 European approach.  There is a sense that the proper I
 amount of EC dealings with China might actually make the
 Soviets more cooperative, while too rapid movement toward
 closer ties could only alarm Moscow and produce specific
 negative results.  The problem, of course, is finding the
 magic point at which the positive disappears and the nega-
 tive begins.                        Whatever the course of West European -
 Chinese trade relations, however, the EC provides .a useful
 framework within which they can develop.

 In the military sphere, there is no organization
 readily available to structure and contain West Euro-
 pean - Chinese relations.   This has led some West Euro-
 peans to suggest that, to the extent they consult each
 other on arms sales to the Chinese, they should do so
 in the EC.  Others have thought that specific arms sales
 could be considered by COCOM--the Western committee that
 approves sales of items based on advanced technology to
 Communist countries.  Most, however, agree that neither
 the EC nor COCOM can treat properly the military dimension
 of the subject--which leads, almost inevitably, to NATO.
 From the West European point of view, however, NATO
 is far from the ideal forum.   For one thing, deliberations
 would be heavily influenced by the United States:   a
 common NATO policy for selling arms to China would not
 necessarily coincide with an ideal common European policy.
 Another problem is that NATO, loose association of states
 that it is, has traditionally had a difficult time defining
 itself in relation to other parts of the world (except,
 on most occasions, the USSR).   So it is difficult to
 arrive at common external policies.   Common arms sales
 policies are particularly difficult to arrive at because
 national economic as well as security interests are
 involved.   In the Chinese case, the glaring implications
 for East-West relations increase the complexity of attempts
 For many of these reasons, NATO has dealt with the
 Chinese problem in the most general way.  At the North
 Atlantic Council meeting on 20 November--the most thorough-
 going recent discussion of China in a NATO forum--the West
 European caution on selling arms to the Chinese was
 evident.   Most of the Ambassadors agreed that the Soviet
 reaction should be a primary consideration of NATO coun-
 tries in their dealings with the Chinese.   Some speakers
 pointed to the possibility of future political turmoil in
 China; others highlighted the practical constraints on
 Chinese economic development.                                              25X1
 The Dutch had little success recently in proposing
 that NATO go beyond general discussion and consult on arms
 sales to China.  While the Italians and Canadians were
 willing, the British and French--both of whom had possible
 military sales in the works--were opposed.                                 25X1

 Arms sales will continue on a purely bilateral basis
 for the foreseeable future.  This is not merely because
 the political rhetoric about caution conflicts with eco-
 nomic interest.   It is, rather, that some NATO members
 feel themselves to be perfectly capable of exercising
 caution in selling arms to China--without detailed Alliance
 discussion.  And yet it is possible that as more arms are
 sold (or look as if they might be sold) to the Chinese,
 other members may feel the need for more specific con-
 sultations.                                 For instance, discussions might be held on
 the implications of a particular sale, with the under-
 standing that the results of the discussion were in no
 way binding on the seller.   Or an attempt might be made
 to arrive at a definition of what it is proper to sell--
 bilaterally--to the Chinese:   defensive weapons only--or
 some offensive weapons as well?  However, anything resembling
 a common policy on arms sales seems a distant                       25X1

 The French-Chinese Connection
 0
 Most French officials see the Chinese opening to
 Western Europe as an opportunity that should be seized
 upon for maximum advantage--not only because of its
 economic potential but also as another way of enhancing
 French leverage with the USSR.                According to this
 thesis, the Soviets--feeling themselves in danger of
 encirclement by a Chinese - West European - US alli-
 ance--will be more inclined to accommodate European
 interests in hopes of securing their Western flank.  A
 minority view in the French foreign office holds that
 an increase in Chinese activity and influence in Western
 Europe--particularly if Moscow perceives it as fostered
 by the West Europeans--could provoke unforeseen and
 possibly dangerous Soviet reactions.   Thus, the French
 reaction to China's probes has two predominant themes:
 an avid interest in the possibilities, mingled with
 anxiety over the reactions of the superpowers--particu-
 in such areas as arms sales and nuclear exports.
 A more active China on the Soviets' eastern border
 suits French foreign policy.  France is interested in
 keeping the Soviets off balance, in reducing their
 ability to involve themselves militarily in Africa and
 elsewhere, and in easing their military pressure on
 Europe.  At the same time, France does not want to
 antagonize the USSR by aligning itself too closely with
 the Chinese.  In its more grandiose moments, France
 sees itself as a sort of Zubin Mehta, orchestrating the
 superpowers' relations with the Third World.  One of
 its main goals is to bring China into the concert of
 nations, provided that China does not try to play first
 violin and provided its contribution contains sufficient
 nuances.
 France has long seen itself as the industrial
 nation best qualified to deal effectively with the
 Third World.   Paris aspires to be more than just a
 principal source of technology for Peking; it hopes to
 be China's main interlocutor and primar  point of
 contact on the European continent.

 The French think that the public way in which the
 Chinese have sought West European technology is intended
 to create the impression that the West Europeans are
 aligned with Peking in the Soviet-China dispute and are
 not averse to furthering that impression within limits.
 Accordingly, France is happy to be supportive of
 China's effort to expose many of its senior officials
 to Western organization and work methods--provided the
 Chinese do not venture into areas the French consider
 sensitive.   Paris, for example, expects almost 500 Chi-
 nese students to arrive in France, starting in February
 1979.   But the Chinese had proposed that over 200 be
 accepted for advanced studies at certain scientific re-
 search centers that are considered sensitive by the
 French.   According to a Quai official, the French re-
 few high-technology items, while more profitable con-
 tracts for less advanced items go to their competitors.
 In fact, the main return the French expect for the time
 they spend satisfying Chinese interest in such technol-
 ogy is to open the door to a wider array of French goods.
 Moreover, the French have not yet taken a firm po-
 sition on the transfer of computer technology to the
 Chinese because of its military ramifications and be-
 cause it might incur Soviet displeasure.   Some 13 dele-
 gations of Chinese technicians visited the French com-
 puter research center during 1978.   The French do not
 want to be put in the position, however, of providing a
 The seven-year bilateral trade agreement signed in
 Peking in early December was a psychological boost to
 French ambitions in China and a signal from the Chinese
 that they are willing to expand their trade with France
 in at least certain areas.  At the moment, France is
 more interested in economic and commercial sales to China
 than in arms sales.   France has no illusions that China
 will become a major export market in the near future--the
 ambitious new agreement projects an eight-fold increase
 over 1977 in French-Chinese trade through 1985.   France
 is starting from a low base, however:   France's share

 of the Chinese import market was less than 2 percent in
 1977.   France in the past five years dropped from fourth
 to 12th among China's trading partners because of its
 inability to move beyond occasional one-shot capital
 equipment contracts into a wide spectrum of high volume
 repeat sales of consumer goods.   France feels that, as
 a late-starter in the newly opened and potentially impor-
 tant Chinese market, it must hurry to establish its share
 against competition from Japan, UK, West Germany, and
 the United States.   In addition to more work for its
 own industries, France hopes that China will become a
 significant supplier of raw materials.   The signing of
 what is a framework agreement signals a turning point
 in French-Chinese economic relations, but France must
 now quickly table some highly competitive offers in order
 to exploit the political and psychological momentum the
 accord has generated.
 Projects that might reach fruition quickly are those
 involving hydroelectric power as well as China's agreement
 in principle to buy two nuclear power plants from France--
 the first such sale of nuclear technology to China by a
 Western power.   If approved by the United States, the
 highly coveted order will go to Framatone, a nuclear
 plant construction company financed by the French Gov-
 ernment (COGEMA) and another private firm, Altshom-At-
 lantique.   The sale has yet to be approved formally by
 the Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM),
 an organization set up by industrial nations to screen
 the sale of sensitive technology to Communist countries,
 but France foresees no objections from other COCOM mem-

 West Germany's Fernostpolitik
 II
 A responsible German foreign policy may not give
 in to the temptation to play up Soviet-Chinese differ-
 ences.   (West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
 Genscher, 23 August 1978)
 The West Germans are clearly pleased, yet somewhat
 uneasy, about the rapid expansion of political, economic,
 and technical relations with the People's Republic of
 China that has occurred during the past year.   The "Chi-
 nese breakthrough," as dubbed by the Soviet media, has
 resulted in a steady stream of high-level Chinese visit-
 ors to Bonn, the virtual doubling of West German exports
 to China, and the conclusion of several technical and
 development accords.  Not since the early heyday of
 Ostpolitik have top leaders in West German industrial
 and government circles been so acutely eastward-oriented.
 The growing China trade has added an economic dimen-
 sion to the already delicate political balancing act in-
 herent in Bonn-Peking-Moscow relations.   The Soviets have
 indirectly warned the West Germans about overplaying the
 economic gains to be had in the Chinese opening to West-
 ern Europe.  West German officials are in fact worried
 about possible economic retaliation by the Soviets for
 the sharp increase in West German economic ties with
 China. *
 ",It can be argued that the West Germans actually have a measure of
 economic leverage with the Soviets.  West Germany in 1977 supplied
 nearly one-fourth of Soviet machinery and equipment imports from
 the West and was the larggst single supplier of equipment for the
 chemical industry, metal-cutting and forge press equipment, and auto
 production.  It would be hard for the Soviets in the short term to
 switch to alternate suppliers; if they did so, they probably would
 not get the delivery terms and the technology they prefer.

 Some West German officials are concerned the govern-

 deals that could trigger some sort of adverse Soviet re-
 action.   Many Qf the major deals under consideration are
 for the modernization of specific Chinese industrial sec-
 tors, such as petrochemicals, which Moscow could conceiv-
 ably view as directly threatening Soviet interests.   Such
 package deals do not require approval by the West German
 Government.   The West Germans, particularly Chancellor
 Schmidt, have gone to great lengths in recent weeks to
 assure Moscow that such trade ties are simply part of
 the process of building normal relations with China.
 Nevertheless, the West Germans believe that the Soviets
 are irrational on the subject and see little possibility
 of completely assuaging Soviet fears about the Bonn-Pe-

 little to say about the end use of ostensibly nonmilitary
 hardware, such as trucks and communication gear, which
 the Soviets tend to lump in the armaments category.
 Many West German officials, especially in the Foreign
 Ministry, are ambivalent about the value of such potential
 sales.  Some Foreign Ministry officials have unofficially
 supported visits by the Chinese, such as that in May-June
 by a military delegation from China's "armaments office,"
 going so far as to be listed on one occasion as a co-

 West German private industry clearly has become less

 sort of official sanction.
 *Since 1971 the West German Government has banned the export of arma-
 ments to so-called areas of tension.  Although senior officials of
 both coalition parties--the Social Democrats and Free Democrats--
 have defended specific sales to countries not directly affected by
 "tension," such as Iran, they have also stated their intention to
 maintain a restrictive arms export policy, at least for the fore-
 seeable future.

 The West German Government must also contend with

 the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian ally, the

 should "spare no effort" to be of assist      to the
 Chinese in their modernization efforts.
 Regardless of whether the present social/liberal
 coalition stays in power or is replaced by a conservative
 government, the West Germans will remain constrained for
 some time to come from too actively playing the "China
 card."  Although the Soviets appear to have resigned

 and Peking, Moscow would certainly seek to retaliate
 against any sort of arms deals at the present time.
 Schmidt told British Prime Minister Callaghan in October
 that there would be no West German arms exports to China
 except as part of the co-production arrangements with
 France.  Even here, however, Bonn will need to weigh
 carefully the possibility of an adverse Soviet reaction
 which could damage the hard won and fragile benefits of
 Ostpolitik.   For their part, the Chinese are sensitive
 to West German concerns about the Soviets and have pur-
 posely played down anti-Soviet polemics in the West
 German - China context.   For Bonn, however, there remains
 the tough question of determining the   i its of Soviet

 UK:   Opening to the East
 Relations between the UK and China, which began
 both to increase and improve in the mid-1970s, will ex-
 pand even more rapidly during the next decade.  Although
 stepped-up bilateral contacts have been confined mostly
 to talk, some concrete deals have been made during the
 past three years and, more importantly, the groundwork
 has been laid to broaden cooperation in such diverse
 areas as trade, culture, education, public health, in-

 defense.  As Peking intensifies its contacts with the
 outside world, particularly the West, the new era in
 Anglo-Chinese relations will become increasingly im-
 From the Chinese perspective, the step-up reflects
 the desires of the post-Mao leadership to broaden con-
 tacts with the West generally and specifically to speed
 up Peking's development program with sophisticated
 Western technology and equipment.  From London's per-
 spective, future economic and trade pacts are the most
 important aspect of cooperation with China, since agree-
 ments in these areas hold open the prospect of a vast
 new market that could give the British economy a much
 needed boost.  Despite the existence of certain limiting
 factors related to the ability of the Chinces to finance
 and abrosb Western goods and technology, British leaders
 see the prospect of a large-scale market as an opportun-

 offered the Chinese extensive lines of credit, including
 possible government-to-government loans, and will con-

 to absorb.  Bilateral trade already has picked up sig-

 bring two-way trade to between $8 and $10 billion by

 Arms sales will play an important part in future
 Anglo-Chinese relations, both because the UK is willing
 to supply Peking with weapons and military technology
 and because the Chinese have linked the question of ex-
 pansion in other areas with London's willingness to sell
 arms.*  Peking has expressed an interest in purchasing
 a varied and substantial amount of military hardware,
 such as tanks, guns, naval vessels, radar systems, mis-
 siles,  aircraft, as well as the spare parts and know-
 how.   If agreement can be reached, the most significant
 and controversial deal--symbolically, if not militarily--
 will be to sell the Hawker-Harrier jump jet fighter to
 China.   The British Government is presently considering
 a Chinese request for the plane, but London will move
 cautiously before making a final decision.
 *During the mid 1970s the sale of the Spey engine, including license
 to produce it in China, for a Chinese-designed aircraft was the
 single most important deal between Britain and China.  That agree-
 ment has recently been updated, another jet engine agreement has
 been made with Vickers, and a deal to supply China with marine
 turbine engines for high-speed naval vessels is near completion.
 The earliest deal between London and Peking was for the Trident
 jet and, although it is primarily a civilian aircraft, some have
 been adopted for military purposes.

 The sale of weapons--particularly offensive weap-
 ons--is a sensitive issue that Prime Minister Callaghan
 wants to defuse.  He points out that any broad economic
 or trade agreement will emphasize British industrial and
 commercial goods and that military hardware and technol-
 ogy will assume a much smaller role.   Callaghan's ra-
 tionale is that nonmilitary sales probably would be more
 lucrative in the long run.  More importantly, he recog-
 nizes that military sales could have a negative effect
 on relations with the other Western Allies and the USSR,
 as well as on domestic politics.
 Callaghan has indicated that the UK does not want
 to be China's lone supplier of military goods and pre-
 fers a coordinated Western approach.  Therefore, London
 has announced that arms sales to China will be handled
 on a case-by-case basis and, in full consultation with
 Britain's allies.   The sale of defensive weapons does
 not appear to bother the UK's West European allies who
 are themselves involved in arms deals with China or the
 United States, but London believes that Washington, if
 not the other allies, would be more skeptical about of-
 The step-up in Anglo-Chinese relations and the pos-
 sibility of major arms deals have brought a sharp reac-
 tion from the Soviet Union.   Soviet President Brezhnev,
 in a recent blunt letter to Prime Minister Callaghan,
 warned the UK to exercise caution in selling arms to
 China, since Peking is "not part of arms control talks
 and follows an aggressive ideology."  The Soviet initia-
 tive, which climaxed a campaign to dissuade the British
 from selling the Harrier to China, warns that UK-USSR
 relations could be damaged by this and other weapons
 The letter actually may have increased the likeli-
 hood of an agreement on the Harrier.                         Callaghan and For-
 eign Secretary Owen, not wanting to appear to be pres-
 sured by Moscow, have indicated that they support moves
 toward detente, but will not permit the Soviets to inter-
 fere with growing British-Chinese relations or with a
 specific arms deal.  A stiffening attitude in Westminster
 is likely to increase tensions between London and Moscow,

 which already are high because of Soviet human rights
 policy, adventurism in Africa, and the Warsaw Pact arms
 build-up.  Nonetheless, Soviet anxiety, which is taken
 seriously by the Callaghan government, is one of the
 most important reasons for delays in completing a
 Harrier deal and, along with the concerns of Britain's
 allies, will be a major consideration in future arms
 deals.
 The expansion of British-Chinese relations is sup-
 ported by the Labor and Conservative parties, although
 Labor's left wing has strong reservations about arms
 deals because it fears that they will lead to an increase
 in Chinese-Soviet and Anglo-Soviet tensions.   The Con-
 servatives see little chance for a thaw between the
 UK and the USSR and favor strengthening China primarily
 as a counterweight to growing Soviet power as long as
 the Chinese do not pose a threat to the security of
 Britain or Western Europe.   For this reason the Tories
 are particularly anxious to see major agreements con-
 cluded, and have charged that the Callaghan government--
 because of fear of Soviet reaction--has deliberately
 dragged its feet on the Harrier deal.
 British policy toward China will continue regard-
 less of which party wins the next general election.   If
 a Tory government is returned, however, the policy--
 particularly its military aspects--will be pursued even
 more vigorously, and anti-Soviet undercurrents are likel
 to be more blatant.

 Italy and China:   Improved Prospects for Cooperation
 During the past year, bilateral contacts and
 agreements between Italy and the People's Republic of
 China have burgeoned in several key areas.  Rome has
 welcomed the opportunity to capitalize on a potentially
 significant export market as well as to strengthen ties
 between China and Western Europe--particularly Italy--on
 all fronts.  At the same time,  Italian initiatives have
 been complicated by problems related to possible Italian
 arms sales to Peking clearly the most controvert
 aspect of relations between the two countries.  u
 After establishing diplomatic relations with China
 in 1970, Rome sought persistently to increase Italian
 trade with Peking but experienced uneven success as a
 result of Mao's commitment to autarky.  But the signing
 of a trade agreement with. China in 1971 placed Italy in
 the forefront of EC nations dealing with China.  The
 agreement provided for an. annual mixed commission
 meeting to review the progress of bilateral trade,
 numerous exchanges of technical delegations, and parti-
 cipation in reciprocal trade fairs.  As a result of the
 treaty, Italy agreed to provide China with items such
 as machine tools, agricultural machinery, chemical
 products, and motor vehicles in return for textiles,
 food products, and handicrafts.  The volume of this
 trade, however, was strictly limited by the Chinese
 preference for deferred or installment payments over
 the extension of export credits--a fact dictated by
 Peking's chronic shortage of hard currency and its
 desire to keep exports and imports balanced.
 Improving Trade Prospects
 The current Chinese leadership's more outward look-
 ing policies have greatly improved the prospects for Sino-
 Italian cooperation, especially in the industrial and
 technological fields.  This attitude was underscored by
 Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua's unofficial visit
 20 December 1978

 to Italy in early October.  Although Huang signed bila-
 teral cultural, scientific, and technological agreements
 while in Rome, Italian Foreign Ministry officials viewed
 his trip as having three broader objectives:  to heighten
 West European perceptions of the Soviet threat, to use
 that as a basis for greater Sino - West European coopera-
 tion, and to arrange West European participation in China's
 20-year development plan.  II
 The most recent Sino-Italian trade statistics give
 some idea of the dimensions of the new Chinese opening
 to the West.  In the past year, for example, the Chinese
 sent four trade delegations to Italy, and during the
 first half of 1978 Italian exports to China increased
 by over 300 percent, compared to the same period in
 1977.  The total value of Italian exports to China--
 $70 million--now slightly exceeds the value of their im-
 ports for the first time in three years.  Despite the
 improvements, the current level of trade is still not
 commensurate with Rome's ability to supply or with China's
 ability to consume Italian products.  A significant ex-
 pansion of bilateral trade can only be achieved if the
 Italians convince the Chinese to buy entire "turn-key"
 industrial plants, to accept lines of export credits, or
 to agree to trades involving industrial plants or produc-
 tion for Chinese energy-producing supplies such as coal
 Last February, Italian Foreign Ministry officials
 recognized their country's potential to play a role in
 China's master plan, especially those aspects involving
 improved transportation and increased agricultural mechani-
 zation.  There were signs, for example, that the Chinese
 were interested in having Fiat build a pro osed truck and
 diesel engine factory--at a total cost of p$8 billion.  At
 that time, Italian Foreign Minister Forlani even ventured
 to suggest to Ambassador Gardner that such projects could,
 over the long term, mark the reorientation of Italian trade
 away from the Soviet bloc and toward China.
 Italy wasted no time reacting to the apparently
 favorable Chinese attitude.  In recent months, several
 high-level Italian delegations--representing both govern-
 ment and industry--have visited :Peking.  One of the most
 significant trips was led by the Italian Minister of
 Transportation, who returned with the impression that
 China wanted to sell some of its oil to a West European

 country.  Subsequent negotiations culminated last Novem-

 Peking and a West European country.  Although the amount

 to speculation that they might then conclude a bilateral

 slurry pipeline, and long-distance power transmission lines

 The PCI's Position
 The question of arms sales to China is a complex one
 for the Italian Communists.  They have recently shown a
 keen interest in reestablishing party-to-party relations
 with the Chinese.  Such a move would also serve to empha-
 size to domestic and foreign audiences the PCI's inde-
 pendence from the Kremlin.
 Chairman Hua Kuo-feng's trip to Yugoslavia last fall
 produced rumors that the Chinese were willing to rees-
 tablish relations with the Italian Communists.  The PCI
 reacted warmly and also took a positive view of Foreign
 Minister Huang Hua's subsequent visit to Italy.  But de-
 spite the PCI's apparent willingness, little concrete
 progress has been made in improving relations between
 the Italian and Chinese parties.  This probably reflects
 Peking's continuing skepticism of the PCI's independence
 as well as its desire-to-pursue relations on a state-to-
 The Italian Communists hope to improve their ties
 with the Chinese without needlessly antagonizing Moscow.
 The PCI might thus be inclined merely to look the other
 way--particularly if an arms deal with Peking included
 mainly defensive weapons and was concluded quietly.  Sales
 through third-country outlets or international arms traf-
 fickers might permit the PCI to disclaim responsibility.
 But if the Italian Communists were forced to make an offi-
 cial public record of their position on arms to Peking,
 there is a greater chance they would oppose the deal to
 keep peace with the Soviets.
 Outlook
 As a result of China's expanding commitments to inter-
 nal development and foreign contacts, bilateral relations
 and trade with Italy will probably improve significantly
 in the future.  There appears to be a convergence of in-
 terests centering on Rome's ability to provide large-scale

 industrial plants and technology in return for Chinese en-
 ergy supplies.  Any significant expansion of trade, however,
 is dependent on Peking's willingness to accept a line of
 export credits tied to purchases of Italian goods.  And
 although the Chinese desire for Italian arms is a key ele-
 ment in the relationship, Italy will remain reluctant to
 deal with the Chinese unless it can convince its EC part-
 ners to adopt a common position on the issue while avoiding
 developments that would force the Italian Communists to take
 a public stance.  Under these circumstances, the prospects
 for mutually beneficial ties between Italy and China appear
 virtually unlimited.

 China's Relations with Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus
 0
 China's contacts with Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus
 had been quite limited before the visits of Foreign Min-
 ister Huang Hua to Ankara and Athens earlier this year.
 They now promise to increase as China seeks to counter
 Soviet influence in the region and as the eastern Medi-
 terranean countries try to exploit Peking's interest
 for political, economic, and even security benefits.
 China's positions on issues affecting the region under-
 scores its greater interest in recent years in a strength-
 ened Western Europe able to cope with any Soviet threat.
 Background
 Relations between the three countries and China
 date back to 1971-72, when Ankara, Nicosia, and then
 Athens recognized Peking.  At that time, the unexpected
 abstention of Cyprus on the vote to bring China into the
 UN--as well as the yes votes of other so-called mini-
 states--was one of the factors leading to Peking's entry
 into that body sooner than either its opponents or its
 supporters had expected.   In establishing ties with Pe-
 king, none of the three countries felt it was doing more
 than conforming to the growing view in the West that
 China could no longer be ignored.   On a more positive
 note, Greeks and Turks were hoping for profitable com-
 mercial ties with Peking and for diplomatic support of
 their respective cases on the Cyprus problem.   For the
 Chinese, the eastern Mediterranean connection was yet
 another effort to increase their legitimacy and to match

 Soviet intentions, Hua agreed in Ankara to the activa-

 cooperation.   In Athens, he signed a cultural coopera-

 and cultural exchanges.   Greek and Chinese leaders also
 agreed to look into the possibility of broadening their
 economic cooperation, particularly in the maritime field.
 Hua invited Ecevit and Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis
 to visit China.
 Prior to the Hua visit, neither Peking nor any of
 the three countries, except perhaps Cyprus, had shown
 much interest in developing political and economic ties.
 Close party ties were not feasible because the Communist
 parties in Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus are generally pro-
 Soviet, and pro-Chinese splinter groups are insignificant.
 To be sure, Peking signed trade agreements with all three
 countries during ministerial and, in the case of Cyprus,
 presidential visits to Peking between 1972 and 1974, but
 these did not significantly advance commercial ties.   In
 1977, for example, Greek, Turkish, and Cypriot trade turn-
 over with China only amounted to $5 million,  $7 million,
 and $300,000 respectively, most of it in the form of
 Greek and Turkish exports of agricultural products and

 If the economic gains of the Peking connection have
 been disappointing for the Greeks and Turks, so too have
 been the diplomatic payoffs for their respective cases
 on the Cyprus and Aegean disputes.   Peking has pursued
 an evenhanded policy on both, generally abstaining on
 the Cyprus issue in the UN and listening without comment
 to the Greek and Turkish views on the Aegean.   Such com-

 Hua also praised Karamanlis for his efforts on be-
 half of West European unity and expressed support for
 Greece's bid to join the EC.   Similarly, the Chinese
 have welcomed Karamanlis' initiatives on behalf of Balkan
 cooperation, which they see as an antidote to Soviet in-
 fluence in the region, particularly in the post-Tito era
 in Yugoslavia.  II
 Outlook
 Relations between Peking and the three countries
 are likely to improve further, but the process is apt to
 be slow.  Although Greeks and Turks appreciate Peking's
 new interest in their region and in a strengthened West-
 ern Europe, they continue to view their relationship
 with the Soviet Union and their more immediate Communist
 neighbors as more important politically and economically.
 And while they welcome China's presence as a counter to
 Soviet influence, they are also concerned about the pos-
 sible adverse consequences of the intrusion of the Sino-
 Soviet rivalry into their area.   China, for its part,
 gives greater priority to improving its ties with the
 larger and technologically more advanced West European
 states, from which it ho es to secure arms and the means
 to rapid modernization.
 may see it in their interests to strengthen their ties.
 Greeks and Turks do, however, appreciate China as a
 potential market for their products, and this apprecia-
 tion is apt to grow as their export capabilities develop.

 the region in the post-Tito era, both Moscow and Peking

 Canada:    Long Time Fascination With China
 While it is impossible to determine the exact
 measure of Canada's contribution to China's de-
 cision to become a major and responsible actor
 in international affairs, Canada's role can be
 considered a distinctive and important accom-
 plishment of contemporary Canadian foreign pol-
 icy.
 1978 Survey of Relations
 with China prepared by
 External Affairs.
 Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau made an exten-
 sive private visit to China in 1960 before he became in-
 volved in Canadian politics.                                            The country fascinated him,
 and as part of his campaign to be prime minister eight
 years later, he promised to work toward establishing dip-
 lomatic relations.   China was already a major market
 for Canadian wheat, and Canada had high hopes for both
 expanding the bilateral relationship and for playing a
 special role in convincing the Chinese to broaden their

 range of bilateral agreements that covered consular re-
 lations, most-favored-nation treatment, establishment of
 a joint trade committee, a long-term wheat sale, and a
 unique family reunion program.  Under the program, some
 3,000 Chinese have joined relatives in Canada.   Trudeau
 talked extensively with Premier Chou En-lai and met Chair-
 man Mao Tse-tung for two hours in what the New China News
 Agency described as "a friendly atmosphere."  The Canadi-
 ans took this to mean that China highly favored Canada.

 Canada and to develop a distinct identity in interna-

 nated with China as Trudeau--also favored this move.
 The US Embassy in Ottawa surmises that in the Chinese
 view, part of the attraction was toward Canada as a
 strategically placed window on North America.
 But the Canadians became disappointed with the rela-
 tionship.   China was mainly interested in buying wheat,
 and last year wheat still accounted for 83 percent of
 Canada's exports to that country.   Finished goods repre-
 sented only .3 percent of total sales to China in 1977.
 After Trudeau's trip, four years passed before another
 cabinet-level minister visited China, again to sell
 wheat.   Canada concluded that its limited relationship
 was probably as close "as it is possible for a Western
 country to have with China."

 The new outward-reach policy of China has rein-
 vigorated Canadian interest.  This time the Chinese are
 the initiators of delegations and agreements.   In Octo-
 ber 1977, Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua, former
 Ambassador to Canada, chose Ottawa for his first visit
 abroad as Foreign Minister.  A steady stream of other
 delegations followed, including Chinese experts who have
 been quietly scouring Canada for advanced technology.
 Canadian officials see these trips as evidence of a con-
 centrated Chinese effort to absorb Western know-how.   They
 point to the Chinese push to train thousands of students
 in the West--u  to 500 of them in Canada--as part of
 this effort.

 Canadian businessmen also got the message.  A high-
 level Canadian industrial and commercial delegation in
 Peking in October received a "promise of over $10 billion
 of trade between now and 1985," up from about $2.2 bil-
 lion over the past six years.  One observer estimated,
 however, that this jump would be just enough to main-
 tain Canada's current share of 2 percent of China's
 external trade.
 Canadians, concerned that the 7 to 1 trade imbalance
 in favor of Canada would inhibit the Chinese from mak-
 ing further deals, are busily devising ways to keep the
 imbalance within bounds China will find acceptable.
 There are few Chinese products that Canada wants to
 buy, but businessmen are exploring other methods, such
 as "triangulating" trade (receiving payment in goods that
 Canada then sells to a third country), to encourage
 China to deal with Canadian companies.
 As a member of NATO, Canada has been concerned
 about the security aspects of other countries selling
 arms to China, and has no visible intentions to do
 so itself.  Fear of Soviet reaction could play a part,
 but would not weigh nearly as heavily as it does on
 West E  o eans  who face the Russian bear on their door-
 step.
 The Canadians, eager to share in the boom in sales to
 China, take comfort from the Chinese assurances that they
 will favor Canadian goods over those of the US, given
 comparable technology and price.  These assurances will
 probably not hold good in light of the normalization of
 relations between the United States and China.  Observers
 point out, in addition, that the US generally outper-
 forms Canada in most areas, that Japan is already far
 ahead of everyone else in trade with China, and that
 West European industrialists have also made inroads.
 Thus, while Canadians believe that they were a con-
 tributing factor in China's emergence from isolation,
 they realize with regret that Canada can no longer
 lay claim to the                hi  with China of any
 Western country.

 Malta:  China's West European Beachhead
 economically and politically.
 Prime Minister Mintoff has always emphasized Malta's
 links with the Third World and with most Communist coun-
 tries except the USSR.   It is not surprising, therefore,
 that he agreed to China's request for diplomatic recog-
 nition in 1972 or that he accepted Peking's terms:  the
 severance of relations between Valletta and Taipei.
 Since then, Mintoff has traveled to China three times
 and economic relations between China and Malta have
 deepened.   Chinese assistance to Malta is substantial
 and has had a significant impact on the country both
 Economic Ties
 Shortly after diplomatic recognition, China agreed
 to grant Malta a $45-million interest free loan, with no
 conditions attached.  A $4.6 million line of credit was
 also included in the package.  The $45 million loan is
 being used for a variety of projects, but the most im-
 portant is the construction of a drydock facility that
 will be capable of servicing 300,000 ton vessels; when
 completed it will be one of the largest facilities of
 its kind in southern Europe.  There are approximately
 100 Chinese technicians involved in the project, which
 has been plagued with a variety of problems ranging from
 language barriers between the Maltese and Chinese to
 the inexperience of both sides in building a facility
 of this size.
 Meanwhile, China has emerged as one of Malta's ma-
 jor trading partners, accounting for about 30 percent of
 Valetta's transshipment business.   The percentage will
 increase, moreover, under the terms of a May 1978 agree-
 ment calling for more Chinese ship visits.  The Chinese
 have also contracted for more ship repair visits and for
 the construction of a variety of small vessels; two
 5,700 ton petroleum carriers have already been delivered.
 The carriers are Malta's most significant export to
 China, but do little to correct the heavy trade deficit
 with the Chinese.

 Domestic Impact
 Projects such as the drydock construction help
 shore up Miritoff's domestic political base.   With the
 British military forces scheduled to withdraw from Malta
 on 31 March 1979, unemployment is certain to increase
 and Mintoff--who depends on Malta's labor movement for
 much of his political strength--could become more vul-
 nerable politically.   The new drydock's increased ca-
 pacity for ship repair and modification should offset
 some of the unemployment potential since it will be
 inaugurated next March.   The threat of unemployment in

 Even the Nationalist opposition, which had been
 cool to China when it was in power, has been compelled
 to take notice of China's economic contribution to Malta.
 In July 1978, at Chinese invitation, a Nationalist dele-
 gation headed by opposition leader Fenech Adami paid a
 five-day goodwill visit to China.   The Chinese invita-
 tion to the Nationalists is a clear signal to Mintoff
 that China has no qualms about dealing with his opposi-
 tion if this would facilitate blocking an eventual So-
 viet presence in Malta.
 Chinese Objectives
 Keeping the Soviets out of Malta is clearly the
 main Chinese motive in establishing strong economic and
 diplomatic links with Valletta.   Since the Soviets lost
 their Egyptian bases, it has become more difficult to
 resupply and refit their Mediterranean naval squadron.
 Obviously, the Soviets would like a replacement for
 these lost facilities.  Malta possesses everything they
 need--strategic location, drydocl_facilities, and a
 skilled labor force to man it.
 China will probably continue to support Mintoff
 as long as he maintains his current policy of neutrality--
 with an emphasis on aloofness toward the Soviets.  And
 given his excellent relations with Peking, Mintoff would
 have to think long and hard before yielding to Soviet
 overtures.

 The Soviet Response
 0
 With each demonstration of Western receptivity to
 overtures from the Chinese, Moscow professes to be more
 alarmed.   In even the most minor incidences of concilia-
 tion or cooperation, the Soviets perceive an unsettling
 new alignment of international forces, an alignment di-
 rected primarily against themselves.   But the increasing
 stridency of their warnings and threats against this
 Chinese-Western rapprochement is doubtless accompanied
 by a growing realization among the Soviet leadership
 that there is little--if anything--they can do to pre-
 The Soviets condemn China's growing connection with
 Western Europe in all its manifestations,  from innocuous
 cultural exchanges to suggestions of overt military sup-
 port.   Party-level dealings--for example, Chinese Premier
 Hua Kuo-feng's recent visit to Romania and Yugoslavia
 and the favorable reactions of the Italian and Spanish
 Communist parties--complete the threat posed by warming
 state relations and the evident willingness in some West
 European capitals to balance their Soviet connection with
 their new Chinese one.   The Soviets have closely moni-
 tored the nature and development of each country's rela-
 tionship with China, particularly those whose governments
 are considering sales of military hardware.   The Soviets
 see multiplying Western sales and investments in China
 as strengthening the Chinese not only economically, but--
 most significantly--politically.   They appear to realize
 that any genuine military impact would be further down
 It is unquestionably the political impact of West
 European arms sales to China that disturbs the Soviets
 most profoundly, particularly the global perception of
 the success of China's anti-Soviet policies.   But while
 they have said they would regard such sales as "unfriendly
 acts," they are clearly unwilling to risk alienating the
 West Europeans with strong-arm tactics.  Moscow may also
 48

 have concluded that arms sales to the Chinese--of defen-
 sive weapons, at least--are inevitable, and that a mod-
 erate approach on the Soviets' part may induce the West
 Europeans to place some limitations on their dealings
 with the Chinese.  Soviet Embassy officials and military
 attaches in West European capitals are energetically
 seeking information on possible Chinese military pur-
 chases.  It is also possible that Moscow will attempt
 to enlist some Third World countries to support its po-
 sition.
 The tone of Soviet diplomatic demarches to West
 European governments concerning arms sales to the Chi-
 nese has been cautionary, the theme being China's war-
 like intentions and the certain damage to international
 detente.  This was the approach taken by Soviet Presi-
 dent Brezhnev during his talks with West German Chancel-
 lor Schmidt in Bonn last May and by Soviet Foreign Min-
 ister Gromyko on his visit to Paris in late October.
 The Soviet media ceaselessly echo this warning, only
 more stridently.

 The Soviets can be expected to maintain and amplify
 their outcry against arms sales.   It is doubtful, how-
 ever, that Moscow will take stronger measures if such
 measures threaten to harm Soviet interests without en-
 suring the desired impact on West European policy.   SALT,
 MBFR, or bilateral economic arrangements could well prove
 to be the next forum the Soviets choose to express their
 displeasure over the West's Chinese connection.
