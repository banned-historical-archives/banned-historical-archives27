unit . seen as 
Vietnam peace 
to Saigon rule 
By Beverly Deepe 
Special correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Saigon 
Announcement of 10 national-level corn-
. 
mittee members of a new peace group is 
considered here as a significant step towards 
an all-out Communist drive to topple the 
government of President Thieu. 
? 
Reliable Vietnamese sources here believe 
.the announcement of the peace group's 
leadership marks a crucial turning point 
for the United States-backed anti-Commu-
nist here. 
It is not considered a clear-cut political. 
defeat for the Thieu government, but it, 
does represent an acceleration in the ero-
sion of political strength in the govern-
ment-controlled areas. ? 
. Observers say formation of the 10-merh-
'ber alliance publicly stresses the continued 
state of crisis and the unsolved problems 
ef President Thieu's elected government. 
Use of name indicated 
The annoucement 4:4 the leadership for 
'the alliance of National, Democratic, and. 
Peace Forces also is considered,likely here 
to offer .the pretext for the Communists to 
use the name of the movement to perpette 
ate their so-called "general uprising" in:t.he 
. cities and towns. 
. They also are expected to simultaneously?, 
launch a concerted diplomatic offensive to; 
win over leftists in America and the world; 
while Washington-Hanoi peace talks pre-
liminaries are getting underway. 
"The Communists are interested in the 
substance rather than in the semantics of 
, words .like front and alliance;" one Viet-
namese political source explained. 
"During the French Indochina war, the 
Viet Minh was technically known as an 
alliance, while today the Viet Cong are 
' called a front. During the Indochina war, 
. Ho Chi Minh organized a front within a 
front; Now the Viet Cong have organized' 
the new alliance as an appendage of the'? 
National Liberation Front, or a satellite to 
it. 
"In general, the Communists want bigger 
and bigger concepts to attract an ever 
widening base of mass support. If the Amer-
ican government wants to negotiate with 
the new alliance to dump the Thieu govern-
. ment, fine -- but Wahington rejected that 
Approved For Release 2005/08/17 
idea, so now they'll try to destroy the Thieu 
government by themselves." 
Just what methods the Communists will 
:use in their attempts to overthrow the Thieu 
i government are sill unknown here. Some 
!believe their political offensive will be made 
'in conjunction with either ground assaults 
and /or rocket attacks on the cities and 
towns. Saigon is currently in a high state 
,cf tension and uneasiness as developments 
,e7 this kind have been predicted by both: 
.ihe Vietnamese and American military corn-
tUands here. 
Other sources believe the Communists will 
Tim more and more toward political agi-
1 ition, subversion, attracting urban dissi-
RGents, propaganda, and terroristic activi-

significance outlined 
' The short-range, immediate significance 
of am )uncing the national-level committee 
niemters of the alliance is considered by 
Vietna nese political sources to be: 
1. T:is is the 4rst known migration of as 
many s 10 persons of what amounts to the 
upper- rust, snob-set Vietnamese to the pro-
Comm ;nist side since 1960, when the Na-
tional . beration Front was established. 
This not considered an outright defec-
tion of no-American, anti-Communists to 
the pr.( -..lommunist camp. The important 
-membc - of the announced alliance are not 
known ere as anti-Communists; several 
have 11 tories of pro-French leanings or 
prosoci st and proleftist peace leanings or 
activiti in the past.-/ 
Yet, ese committee members are not

munists either, nor is there immediate,

into the cities at a time when militarily 
they are attempting to encircle some urban 
centers from the outskirts and when eco-
nomically they are trying to strangle these 
populated centers from the agricultural 
produce of the countryside. 
The Communist radio broadcasts during 
the Tet offensive in late January first men-
tioned the Alliance for National, Democrat-
ic, and Peace Forces, under a variety of 
names, as representing a return of the "gov-
ernment to the people" in Hue. Later the 
committee members were named for the 
chapter in Hue and the two northernmost 
provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien. 
Le Van Hao, a professor of ethnology at 
the Universities of Saigon and Hue was 
rimed chairman. He was the son-in-law of 
a businessman closely identified with man-
aging the economic interests of Mrs. Ngo, 
Dinh Nhu, the sister-in-law of the late Pres-
ident Diem; the businessman also was a, 
relat ve by marriage to the Diem family. 
Named deputy chairman was a woman,: 
Mrs. Thong Vy, a former director of an 
important girl's school in Hue and the 
mother-in-law of a Vietnamese general, 
currently head of the political warfare de-
partment, as well as the mother-in-law of 
a rich pharmacist who is currently acting 
as an assistant to President Thieu. 
Buddhist monk named 
Also named deputy chairman was a. Bud-
dhist Monk, the Venerable Thich Don Rau; 
his student leader protege, Hoang Phu Ngoe 
Tuong, was narned secretary-general. The 
Venerable Thich Don Hau a Buddhist 
spiritual leader who .was heir apparent to 
Thich Tri Quang in Hue, also is listed on 
the newly announced committee list for Said 
gon. Some Buddhist sources believe he was. 
captured by the Communists during the bat-
tle of Hue and his name was involuntarily 
entered on the committee roster. 
Also during the Tet offensive, Communist 
radio broadcasts said a Saigon chapter 
had been established, but no names were 
listed. Last weekend, both Liberation radio 
and Hanoi radio mentioned that the Saigon 
committee?expanded to mean the national,. 
level committee?had met on April 20-2A 
outside Saigon. 
Numbers of unnamed persons reportedly 
drew up the alliance's program and sp. 
lected the 10 leaders. The program is "de; 
scribed here as a carbon copy of the 14-
point National Liberation Front program 
issued last September, in. the terms of the 
main objectives, of fighting the common 
enemies. of the Thieu7Ey government and 
the Americans. 
The tone is less Strident and he words 
are less biased: "The Americans" replaces 
'the Communist language of "the American 
imperialists," for example. 
Mixture 
The 10 members listed as heading the' 
Approved For Release 2005/08/1 
represented 
PeliSaW/tItittinekiMOW60i53643454) a 
'mixture of t e three regional divisions of 
Vietnam?northern, central and southern?
of various religious groupings, and of various professions. It is heavily weighted to-
ward lawyers, doctors, professors, and stu-
dents which are considered the best-educat-
ed layer of Vietnamese society. 
The chairman was listed as Trinh Dinh 
Thao, a semiretired Saigon lawyer. He was 
born in North Vietnam, but moved to the 
South at middle age. His law degree was 
earned from his studies in France. His son, 
also a lawyer, is married to the daughter 
of one of the richest jewelers in Saigon.; 
Mr. Thao was considered years ago by 
informed Saigonese to be close to Nguyen 
Huu Tho, head of the National Liberation 
Front; the two lawyers reportedly worked 
together in peace movements at the end of 
the French Indochina war. 
Vice-chairman Lam Van Tet is a south-
ern-born Cao-Daist, a religious sect. Tet was 
prominent in Saigon as the chairman of 
the All-Religions Citizens Front established 
in 1964 with the Rev. Hoang Quynh repre-
senting the Catholics, and others represent-
ing the Hoa Hao and Buddhists and Cao-
Deists. 
He is' reportedly rather elderly. While 
listed as an engineer, a more accurate 
'translation ? would be a land surveyor. He 
-also is a large landowner, which Viet Cong 
land Hanoi radio broadcasts conveniently 
'failed to mention. He unsuccessfully ran for 
the upper house of the Legislature that is 
now in session. 
Reported in hiding 
A second vice-chairman is the Buddhist 
monk Thich Don Hau, who is also vice-
chairman of the chapter for Hue. He, like 
the chairman of. the Hue grouping, is 
;thought to be in hiding outside of Hue, 
,where heavy fighting has taken place in 
the past few days between U.S. Army 1st 
?Air Cavalry 101st airborne troops and 
North Vietnamese Army units. 
Secretary-General Duong Ky was ar-
rested for his anti-government actions in 
1965. He was one of three peace advocates 
sent over the Ben Hai Bridge to North Viet-
nam in that year. He went'to Paris and re-
turned to Saigon in 1967, informed sources 
report. Active in the past Buddhist-inspired 
crises and demonstrations against a suc-
cession of governments following the fall 
of Ngo Dinh Diem, he was for a time a 
professor at Saigon and Hue Universities. 
Listed as assistant secretary-general is a 
rather well-known, wealthy woman doctor in 
Saigon, Duong Quynh Hoa. She received 
her doctor's degree in France, and reliable 
sources said she was once engaged to a 
Frenchman who was a member of the Com-
munist Party. He passed on before they 
were married and she never 'wed anyone 
else. 
She was bitter for sometime, these sources

1960's. But she suspected that government 
agents during the Diem regime committed 
the crime. 
A second assistant secretary-general was 
listed as Le Hieu Dang, who was well known 
as deputy chairman of the Saigon student 
union, with headquarters on the main street 
of Saigon, in 1966 and,1967. He was known to 
have participated in the American-aided 
summer student programs which helped 
rebuild and clean up some of Saigon's slum 
districts. 
A third assistant secretary-general, Thanh 
Nghi, is known as the author of a French. 
Vietnamese ,dictionary. He holds the equi-
valent of a master of. arts. degree from 
:France.

Little information is available, even from

Front fo 
? 
Whatever, the Communists or their 
agents do in Vietnam these days is mani-
festly connected with both the talks in 
Paris and the presidential election cam-
paign in the United States. Hanoi has 
things impressively organized ? even if it 
occasionally fails or misreads the signs. 
And so it is presuniably no coincidence 
that there have come together in recent 
days both a brief resumption of the rock-
eting of Saigon?as well as stepped-up 
military activity elsewhere ? and a re-
gumption of political activity by one of 
the newest and most significant Commu- ? 
nist-front organizations in the South, the 
Vietnam Alliance of National; Democratic 
and Peace Forces (VANDPF). 
The VANDPF is in fact a front for a 
front -7 for the National Liberation Front 
(NLF) which has had s,ome non-Commu-
nist components all along but is now ex-
posed as on a tight rein to Hanoi. Even 
Hanoi at last recognizes apparently that 
it is asking too much of the other side to 
accept the NLF as the sole legitimate 
spokesman for the South and to insist on 
the NLF's program as the only one ac-
ceptable for a resolution of the country's 
long agony. So the VANDPF has been set 
up in Viet Cong-held territory in South 
Vietnam, with possibly only one known - 
Communist on its 10-man central commit, 
tee. (That one, paradoxically, is a woman 
who may either have been a member in 
her youth of the French Communist Party 
or was once betrothed to a member of It.) 
r a front 
Hanoi's intention would seem to be to 
get the VAN131410 recognized as the non-
Communist component in an eventual 
coalition government in Saigon. And to 
achieve this, it has first to bring about an 
undermining of the legality of and confi-
dence in the present government in South 
Vietnam ? the Thieu-Huong tandem 
which the United States supports. In ef-, 
fect, then, the plan is first to substitute 
a VANDPF team for the Thieu-Huong 
team, to be immediately followed by the 
VANDPF's seeking a coalition with the 
NLF. To discredit these efforts, the Thieu-
Huong tandem has recently pronounced 
capital sentences in abstentia on the 10 
members of the VANDPF's central com-
mittee. 
? A good case can be made that this 
central committee while playing Han-
oi's game ? is less pro-Communist than 
neutralist, anti-American and more at 
ease with French than any other outside 
' culture. Among intellectual and some reli-
gious and business circles in Saigon, there 
are signs of a patchy growth of these 
trends perhaps an incipient hedging of 
bets against an imagined American sell-
out or walkout. 
' It would be na? .not to see the 
VANDPF for what it is. Yet at this stage 
in the game, could it not be short-sighted 
to make its non-Communist central com-
mittee members martyrs, albeit in abl 
sentia? Could not these people under cer-
tain circumstances be used against as 
? much as .by the communists?

Principal Developments World Communist Affairs  
(20 August-19 September 1968) 
1. World Communist Conference  
In the light of the deep divisions in the Communist world which the 
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia has caused, questions have been raised 
in many quarters in and outside the Communist world whether the Soviets 
could effectively proceed with the World Communist Conference, a convo-
cation planned to demonstrate the unity and harmony binding the world 
Communist movement together (it is scheduled for 25 November 1968). As 
we go to press all indications are that they do indeed plan to go ahead 
with it. Pravda on 13 September published an article by the war horse 
of Stalinist Communism, Jacques Duclos, former head of the French Commu-
nist Party, urging the importance of the Conference. The desperation of 
the Soviets to find a prestigious figure to call for proceeding with the 
Conference is illustrated by the fact that this call was actually origin-
ally published by Duclos in Fi'anc on 15 May (!), long before the invasion. 
Since the invasion, it is doubtful the Soviets would be able to find any 
major Communist leader in the free world willing to support such a move. 
In fact, Italian Communist leader Luigi Longo wrote in the Party journal 
Rinascita in mid-September that it would be "neither useful nor opportune, 
nor perhaps even possible" to go ahead with the Conference unless the 
Soviets withdraw their troops from Czechoslovakia in the interim --an 
unlikely development. (Correspondent Alvin Shuster's article in the New 
York Times, datelined Budapest 17 September, says that another prepara-
tory meeting for the Conference will convene in Budapest during the week 
of 23 September, but that no official announcement has been made. The 
last such preparatory meeting was held last June.) 
2, Polycentrism Revived? 
Even if the Soviets succeed in ramming through their demand for a 
meeting of many Communist parties next November, it is doubtful they could 
gain assent for formalizing world Communist unity in some sort of organi-
zation or in the unanimous underwriting of some bold new Manifesto. 
Much more hope of success could be expected from an idea that is 
hinted at by Maurice Duverger, a leftist French professor of political 
science writing in Le Monde on 5 September 1968, that is, "A Western 
Communism" ("Un Communisme Occidental") (See attachment). He points 
out that the invasion merely highlights the inapplicability of the So-
viet model of Communism for Western Europe, and argues that it can only 
become viable by seeking its own path. In this vein, the veteran Austrian

have the moral duty of severing relations with the CPSU as a result of the 
invasion, and it is but a step beyond this to suggest that West European 
Communist parties should get together -- without the Soviets to discuss 
the development of a more relevant form of Communism (an application of 
deceased Italian CP leader Togliatti's "polycentric Communise). 
3. The Soviet Dread of Freedom 
On the night of 20-21 August 1968, the Soviet Union by invading 
Czechoslovakia with four Bloc partners: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, 
and Bulgaria, again demonstrated its disregard of solemn agreements, in 
this case those reached with the Czechs at Cierna nad Tisou and Bratislava 
a scant three weeks earlier, and of its solemnly and oft repeated "prin 
ciple" of non-interference in the internal affairs of another state. The 
desperate proliferation of excuses for the intervention proferred after-
wards in Bloc propaganda betrays the lack not only of a reason that is 
acceptable to the world at large, but even of one that would be convincing 
to anyone in the Bloc itself. The main justification offered -- that 
"counterrevolutionaries" were on the verge of toppling the Czechoslovak 
regime -- is patently absurd, and it seems impossible for the Soviets to 
have believed it true. 
The true reason was and remains the Soviet fear that its system of 
Communism, wherever practiced, cannot survive free and critical self-
examination such as that which Czech intellecti]Als were conducting and 
airing in public information media and which the Czech leadership refused 
to suppress. This Soviet fear may well be justified, and it is a telling 
commentary on the ideological poverty of Soviet Communism that it cannot 
exist under conditions where even some of the basic human freedoms are 
permitted to flourish. 
There was some early hope among both friends and enemies of the Soviet 
Union that the invasion would be recognized as a mistake with an accompany-
ing disposition to make amends, but that hope is fading in the light of 
the single-minded and persistent determination of the occupiers to require 
complete fulfillment of their demands, which they choose to call "normal-
ization." Itis still not clear how tar these demands will extend, but there 
is reason to believe that a liberalized, or even humanized, Czech Communism 
will not be permitted, and that the Czech leadership will not be permitted 
to rum the country without direct Soviet supervision (for example, via a 
system of Soviet "advisors" in all key sectors). 
4. HIELlIghts of Events  in Czechoslovakia  
The occupation of Czechoslovakia was achieved smoothly and effi-
ciently, in its military aspects, as if it had been planned far in 
advance. It seems most likely that it was the execution of a contingency

2 
Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030015-0 
plan made long before, though it is less certain when the decision was 
taken to put such a contingency plan into effect. Presumably it was 
some time after the agreements reached at Cierna and Bratislava, at 
which the Czech leaders believed they had received assurances that they 
would be permitted to meet minimum Soviet requirements in their own way. 
The invaders were received by the Czech people with uniform hostil-
ity though with little violence (this latter at the behest of the Czech 
leadership). While the main Czech leaders, with the exception of Presi-
dent Ludvik Svoboda, were seized and held incommunicado, the Soviets 
were surprised at not being able to find enough Czech Quislings to set 
up an amenable yet viable government. Hence they had to resort to the 
unexpected alternative of re-installing the original key leaders: Party 
Chief Alexander Dubcek, Premier Oldrich Cernik, and National Assembly 
head Josef Smrkovsky, after dictating to them the conditions that would 
have to be met. These conditions are known as the "Moscow Agreement," 
reached between 23-27 August. While the authorities have not revealed 
the content of the agreement, a version acquired by the New York Times  
(attached) is probably a fair approximation. Judging by this and by 
events following the Moscow meeting, the most important provisions 
are clear: (a) restoration of the formal, organized censorship of news 
and information, especially to prevent criticism of the Soviet Union, its 
allies, or Communism (b) elimination of any kind of political or quasi-
political grouping not sanctioned by the occupying authority (c) removal 
from office of certain officials repugnant to the Soviet Union. The 
first two provisions have been fulfilled, though full conformity of the 
Czech news media with Soviet requirements has not yet been achieved 
and the Soviet regularly note this fact in their propaganda. Full con-
formity is probably simply a matter of time. Some Czech liberal leaders 
long under personal attack in Soviet and Bloc media have been purged, 
others will undoubtedly be removed in due time. Among the more promin-
ent liberal figures relieved of their main responsibilities (some have 
taken less sensitive jobs) are Central Committee Secretary Cestmir Cisar, 
National Front head Frantiszek Kriegel, Minister of Interior Josef Pavel, 
and Deputy Premier Ota Sik, prime architect of Czechoslovakia's new eco-
nomic model. Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek resigned on 19 September. A 
number of well known Communist conservatives also resigned their posts. 
Another provision of the agreement is that the Soviets will decide 
when the situation is "normalized" sufficiently to warrant the with-
drawal of troops. Most observers believe this will be a long time com-
ing, and that even when most troops are withdrawn some units will remain 
along the Czech-German border. 
Lesser provisions seem to include the requirement that the Czech 
leadership make public its disapproval or take a public stand on cer-
tain issues such as, disavowing the anti-Soviet deposition made by 
Foreign Minister Hajek in the United Nations and declaring null and void 
the clandestine 14th Party Congress which was held just after the invasion 
and which elected an overwhelmingly liberal Central Committee (the regular

Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030015-0 
Party Congress scheduled for 9 September has not yet been rescheduled). 
Whether the Czechs will indeed be forced to discard all elements of Sik's 
economic program, as Soviet propaganda suggests, is not yet certain. 
There is some reason to believe that Dubcek's days as Party Chief 
may be numbered. He was the only one of the present top leaders named 
in a Pravda editorial of 22 August (hence the day after the invasion 
and before he joined the talks in Moscow) as a "right-wing opportunist." 
He was also said to be one of a minority at the Cierna meetings that 
refused to abide by the Bratislava agreement. However, that has been 
the only adverse mention of Dubcek in Soviet media. A straw in the wind 
may be that an "independent" Polish newspaper, Zycie Warszawy ("Warsaw 
Life"), on 4 September printed him as gullible, moral, and sincere, but 
expressing "certain reservations as to his political acumen and ability 
to engage in resolute action when necessary." 
5. Communist Reaction  
The ultimate impact of the Soviet invasion of the World Communist 
Movement (WCM) still remains to be seen. The reaction of certain key 
Communist parties is still evolving. The Communist governments behaved 
for the most part as was to be expected. The four Bloc partners, of 
course, defended it. Rumania and Yugoslavia denounced the invasion 
immediately, unequivocally, and vehemently. In succeeding days, the 
Rumanians softened their tones, whether under pressure by the Soviets, 
or voluntarily in order not to add gratuitously to the disruption of the 
Communist world, is not clear. The Chinese Communists and Albanians de-
nounced the invasion in vitriolic terms (% monstrous crime," "utterly 
shameless"). Among Chinese objectives in condemning the invasion may 
well be the hope of sabotaging the World Communist Conference. And of 
more than passing interest is the fact that the North Vietnamese chose 
clearly to support the Soviet position even though it flatly contradicted 
the Chinese Communist line. The Cubans approved it as "necessary" while 
simultaneously asserting that of course it was illegal. 
All the legal European Communist parties condemned the Soviet inva-
sion, some more vigorously than others. Among the strongest condemnations 
was that of the Austrian Communist Party. Central Committee member Ernst 
Fischer persohally proposed that Communist parties cut all ties to the 
CPSU and form another leftist movement. The powerful Italian and French 
parties condemned the invasion, but not -going so far as to suggest a break 
with the Soviet Party. 
Parties of countries in the Near and Middle East receiving Bloc 
military and economic aid supported the Soviets; perhaps for analogous 
reasons, so did most Latin American parties. In the rest of the free 
world, condemnation of the Soviet action by Communist parties was virtu-
ally unanimous.

A Western Communism? 
CPYRGH 
by Maurice Duverger 
' The 'action of the USSR in Czechoslovakia raises the problem of a third pole in 
the development of communism. It has not brought together the two which already exist, 
the Russian and the Chinese. That Mr. Dubcek might be more "revisionist" than 
Mssrs. Brehnev and Kosygin, that the latter might employ Stalinist methods to 
eliminate them, these do not sufftce to give them grace in the eyes of Mao Tse-tung. 
He has understood perfectly well one of the essential meanings of the Soviet decision: 
the affirmation by one of the two great powers of its freedom of action within its 
zone of influence, which obliges it to accord the same prerogatives to the other. 
The new coup de Prague could justify a new coup de Santo.Domingo. It strengthens 
the.imperialism of the United States in Latin America. Nothing is more removed 
from the Chinese concept of world revolution. 
The two present forms of communism still correspond to fundamentally different 
situations. That of Peking embodies the hope of the poor, ,of the under developed, 
of those who have nothing to lose and everything to gain in employing violence. 
That of Moscow relates to the more advanced countries, which naturally tend toward 
prudence and realism. But, since 21 August 1968, it has shown itself incapable of 
embodying, the future of the more modern industrial nations. To tell the truth, 
it never truly embodied it. As early as 1917, Lenin hoped that the revolution in 
Germany and in the rest of Western Europe would relay the Russian revolution and take 
the lead in the movement. Since then, the progress of the .communist parties in 
France, in Italy and in the other countries having a pluralist democracy has always 
been held back by certain aspects of Soviet practice. 
, This phemonenon remained a secondary one as long as these parties were far re-
moved from power. Moreover, the evolution of the USSR and of the popular democracies, 
in recent years, gave reason to think that the gap between the structure of their 
communism and the technical; political, and cultural needs of the western nations 
was going to be progressively filled in. Thus one could think that the liberaliza-
tion of Eastern Europe Would develop more rapidly -- or as rapidly -- as would the 
possibility of the communists accede to the government in Paris or in Rome, so that 
they would not have been too weakened by the sequels of Stalinism. 
Hereafter one can no longer believe that. The military occupation of Czecho-
slovakia. shows that the USSR is absolutely determined to prevent a profound liberali-
zation. Although it remains less brutal than in Hungary, because popular resist-
ance has taken different forms, the action of the Soviet tanks is more grave for 
the future of communism. Twelve years ago it aimed above all to prevent the disso-
lution of the Warsaw Pact; Imre Nagy had been imprudent in this respect. Today its 
essential aim is to paralyze the internal democracy of a country otherwise determined 
to remain faithful to the socialism camp and to the Russian alliance. It is moti-
vatpd by fear of the contagion of liberty more than by the necessity of protecting 
outward appearances. 
Let us not deceive ourselves on the other hand. The conflict which last month 
was able to divide the Soviet leaders did not really pit the liberals against the 
"hard liners." Rather it pitted the advocates of military intervention against 
those of political pressure, to reach the same goal: to conserve the monolith. 
There are no real liberals in the apparatus of the Soviet party and state. As always 
in Russia, liberty remains above all the idea of the intelligentsia. The formidable 
weight of the traditions of an authoritarian empire is added to that of a dictator- NI, 
ship of the proletariat to brake evolution towards socialism, pushed moreover by

economic and technological developments. Yesterday tie examp popular de-
mocracies, and particularly that of Prague, acted in the opposite sense; it is now 
suppressed. 
Certainly, as in Hungary after 1956, liberalization will undoubtedly begin again, 
little by little, in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere. But so slowly and so weakly that 
it will remain for a very long time (if not forever) short of the degree of liberty 
necessary to render communism assimilatable by the nations of the West. The gap ' 
becomes more serious as the communist parties are no longer totally beyond the hope 
of coming to power. The communists have participated in the government of Finland 
since 1966; their participation in France is no longer entirely unimaginable; even 
in Italy they have moved a little towards it. Facing a Social Democratic movement 
that is more and more bureaucratic, could not a liberal communism restore its chances 
for, achieving socialism in the advanced countries? But Moscow now appears as 
incapable of resolving these parties' problems as those of the under developed 
countries. Its responsibilities as a great atomic power, its (valid) efforts to es-
tablish a, modis vivendi with the United States, its economic growth, the remoteness 
of revolutionary methods: these lend justification to Chinese communism. Its rejec-
tion of an authentic liberalization, its attachment to dictatorial control over 
information, its allergy to political democracy, its estrangement from the needs of 
industrial nations: these would justify the birth and development of an original 
western communism. 
Soviet communism remains very important. Without the revolution of 1917, the 
development of socialism in the world.would be less important. Without the present 
strength of the USSR, which confronts that of the. United. States, capitalism would 
be more widespread and more dominant. In misunderstanding this aspect of the problem, 
and in considering the Russians as enemies, the Chinese are probably wrong in rela-
tion to their own revolutionary objectives. In refusing to break completely with 
Moscow, the communist parties of the West show themselves more realistic. But they 
would not be so, on the other hand, if they content themselves with protesting the 
military occupation of Czechoslovakia in the name of the right of each country to 
determine its own road to socialism. 
Stalin transformed the USSR from a power which exports ideasinto a simple 
conservator of a system. It became a place of security, a citadel, and nothing more. 
It is even loco able to ,spread its doctrine in the industrialized countries than in 
the under developed countries; rt. ntill has something to teach to the Chinese com?
munists. It has nothing to teach to the western communist, since it refuses the 
liberalization which alone would permit the Soviet model to correspond to the level of 
Aft ; 
tecnological and political evolution of Western Europe. On the contrary, the latter 
could teach it a lot in defining a model of liberal communism which world raise 
Eastern Europe from the stagnation 'in which it is progressively engulfed. 
In saying "no" Moscow over the invasion of Czechoslovakia, the communist parties 
of the West have opened the way for such an evolution. They do not seem determined 
to go further in this direction after this enormous first step However, on their 
ability to do so depends not Only their own future, but perhaps that of international 
communism. There is no reason to think that the under developed countries will be 
the prime movers of history in the coming decades; without doubt this role will 
belong for a long time yet to the most technically advanced countries, as Marx 
thought moreover, and except at the end of his life, Lenin. The future of socialism 
in the latter countries depends less on Moscow now than on the capacity of the 
Italian CP and, to a lesser degree, the French CP to take the-leadership of a western 
communism.

Kulnetsov Sees Party Chief 
in an Effort to Reconcile 
ConfliCting Viewpoints 
DEMANDS MADE KNOWN 
Text of 14 Points Suggests 
Prague Has Been Balking

PRAGUE, Sept. 7?Vasily V. 
Kuznetsov, the Soviet First 
Deputy Foreign Minister, con-
ferred today with Alexander 
Dubcek, the Czechoslovak par-
ty leader, in his second day of 
negotiations aimed at resolving 
conflicting interpretations of 
a Soviet-Czechoslovak accord 
reached in Moscow two weeks 
ago. 
The agreement, concluded 
Aug. 26, contained Soviet con-
ditions for tlie withdrawal of 
the 600,000 troops of the 
Soviet Union and four , of its 
Warsaw Pact, allies that in-
vaded Czechoslovakia on the 
night of Aug. 20-21. 
A list of 14 points of the 
Moscow agreement, which has 
now become available here, 
suggests that while the Czecho-. 
slovak leadership has fulfilled, 
some of the conditions de-' 
manded by the Soviet Union,: 
others have been met only: 
partly and still others not at 
all. 
The conditions were pre-
seated earlier this week at 
closed briefings of regional and 
district party leaders through-
out Czechoslovakia.

said. "The occupation has called 
to life a fight for freedom that 
,cannot be suppressed by the 
Security Council or anyone 
else."
choslovakia broke diplo-
matic relations with Israel fol-
lowing the 1967 war ? before 
Mr. Dubcek's advent to power?
but the Czechoslovak press has1 
not occupied itself with attacks 
on Israel. 
Despite the wide use of such 
double entendre, Soviet troops 
evacuated last night all but 
one of the newspaper offices 
they had been occupying since 
the Invasion. Still under guard 
was the youth newspaper 
Mlada Fronta, but the People's 
party's daily Lidova Demok-
rade appeared today and the 
Socialist newspaper Svohodne 
Slovo is expected to come out 
tomorrow. 
However, the showing of a 
newsreel on the first days of 
the occupation was stopped 
earlier this week, apparently 
on orders from the Soviet 
command. ? 
Mr. Kuznetsov called on Mr. 
Dubcek early this afternoon 
at the latter's offices at the 
Ceneral Committee of the Com-
munist party. He was accom-
panied by Ambassador Stepan 
V. Chervonenko and one un-
identified person. 
Authoritative informants in-
dicated later in the day that 
Mr. Kuznetsov might remain in 
Prague indefinitely. The view 
In foreign Communist quarters 
was thant his presence, was "n 
positive event" that might lead 
to a settlement. 
East European diplomats alsol 
believe that Mr. Kuznetsov's 
talks may be followed late next( 
week by another visit to Mos-
cow by a delegation headed by 
Mr. Dubcek. 
Yesterday, the Presidium ofi 
the Czechoslovak party called' 
for "open and direct negoti-
ations" to remove obstacles 
"from any side" to the fulfill-
ment of the Mosco(A, agreement.' 
This was taken to mean that 
the Czechoslovak leadership 
was preparing for a new round 
.of negotiations on the highest 
'level to clarify the terms and 
the United Nation g Security the implications of the agree-
Reigko,i4worui;,:iegg.P781-ra4d440C1040.008001:51.01 
merit by the Prague radio 
seemed 14 indicate that the, 
Soviet 414- Czechoslovak offi-I 
dials renNined at odds. 
Last night, the talk with Mr. 
Svoboda was described as an 
"open and comradely" ex-
change. On the meeting today 
with Mr. Dubcek, the Prague 
radio said that the two men 
"informed each other and pre-
isented opinions about current 
questions concerning relations 
between the two countries and 
parties." 
A comparison between the 
14 points and the present situ-
ation shows that, for example. 
Czechoslovakia has not yet 
issued a required statement 
that her border with West 
Germany was not properly 
prepared for defense and must, 
therefore, 
he secured by War-
saw Pact forces. 
It has been reported that at 
least two divisions are to be 
stationed on the West German 
border after withdrawal of the 
other occupation forces. 
The Prague government has 
removed Deputy Premier Ota 
Shik, the chief economic plan-
ner, and Interior Minister Josef 
Pavel as demanded, in the 7th 
and points, but it has not "re-
leased from his functions," as 
requesteed, Foreign Minister 
Jiri Hajek. In fact, Mr. Majek 
returned to Czechoslovakia 
today despite an attack on him 
in the Soviet press in recent 
days. ? 
, While Point 2 demanded a 
declaration that the 14th con-
gress of the Czeechoslovak 
Community party, which met 
clandestinely in a Prague In-
dustrial plant while Mr. Dub-
cek and his assoclatees were 
In Soviet interment, was illegal, 
no such statement has yet been 
made. 
According to the Czecho-
slovak party briefings insist 
that such a declaration be de-
layed until the withdrawal has 
been completd. 
Prss censorship has been for-
mally instituted, as the third 
point of the Moscow agreement 
spcifid, but the Russians are 
known to b unhappy over its 
laxity. 
A Pointed U.N. Report., 
Czechoslovak methods of 
handling their press in the face 
of restrictions were evident in 
the prominent front-page dis-
play this morning in the Com-
munist party's official organ, 
Rude Pravo, of a report from 
New York on the meeting of

According to Rude Pravo, 
three East German deputy 
defense ministers, including 
and admiral, visited last week 
their country's occupation 
units in Czechoslovakia. It was 
believed that they met with 
liaison staff and the token 
units that remain in north-
western Czechoslovakia after 
most of the East German forces 
were evacurtled for political 
reasons a week after the inva-
sion. 
Meanwhile the afternoon 
newspaper Vccerni Praha re-
ported this evening the return 
to. Prague of Foreign Minister 
Jiri Hajek who came under 
attack by rthe Soviet press 
earlier this 'week. 
There appeared to be no im-

part to dismiss Mr. Hajelc, one 
of those on the Soviet black 
list.

New Soviet Phase Seen 
:;reciai to The New Yorit Timri 
MOSCOW, Sept. 7?The visit 
of Vasily V. I< utznetsov 
:Prague was viewed by East 
European observers today as 
possible opening step in a! 
?new phase of Soviet policy; 
toward Czechoslovakia. 
Although nothing has be-
.come known of Mr. Kuznelsov's 
-conversations today with Alex-
ander Dubcek, the Czecho-
slovak party leader, and yes-
terday with President Ludvik 
Svoboda, the observers 
that such a visit at this timel 
is of more than routine impor-
tance. 
In the light of public soviet' 
statements since the Moscow 
agreement of Aug. 26, the oh-
servers .feel that a HMV phase 
of Soviet policy would be . 
marked by a more draconic 
attitude toward the occupied 
country.
