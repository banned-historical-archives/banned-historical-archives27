 VIETNAM
 Except for a one-day standdown in observance of Bud-
 dha's birthday,  allied forces last week continued
 their major assault against North Vietnamese staging
 areas and heavy gun positions in northeastern Quang
 Tri Province.   In Saigon,  signs that Chief of State
 Thieu intends to run for the presidency are creating
 friction in military circles.
 LAOTIAN PREMIER'S POLITICAL MOVES FRUSTRATED
 Conflicting regional interests have blocked his ef-
 forts to reorganize the cabinet.   Communist military
 forces are increasingly active in northern Laos.
 HONG KONG GOVERNMENT SUPPRESSES COMMUNIST-LED DISORDERS
 The strong measures seem to have set back for the
 moment the Communist challenge to British authority,
 but Peking is maintaining its pressure on the British.
 CONTINUED DISORDER IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Peking's accounts of widespread violence involving
 pro-Mao forces are probably exaggerated and designed
 to discredit local party officials.   Their circulation
 underscores Peking's difficulties in effecting changes
 .in the provinces.

 The appointment of party secretary Yuri Andropov as

 ARAB-ISRAELI CONFRONTATION AT NEW HIGH
 Israel and its Arab neighbors are mobilizing.   With
 Nasir's announcement affecting shipping into the Gulf
 of Aqaba,  the threat of conflict is greater than at
 any time since 1958.   An incident in the gulf or along
 the Israeli frontiers could quickly lead to escalation
 of the war of nerves.
 FIRST STEP  IN GREECE TOWARD RETURN TO CONSTITUTIONALITY
 A committee has been appointed to prepare a new draft
 constitution within six months, but the government
 probably would not be prepared to submit any revisions
 to public referendum until at least early 1968.   Mean-
 while life in Greece goes on at an apparently normal
 pace.

 FAR EAST
 Although the confrontation in Hong Kong remains
 tense,  local Communist leaders appear uncertain as
 to their future course in the face of the unyield-
 ing British stance.                      The Hong Kong Government has
 banned unauthorized demonstrations and public meet-
 ings and has taken other strong measures to suppress
 leftist agitation.   In Peking the regime is display-
 ing strong public support for the Hong Kong leftists
 by denouncing alleged British "atrocities," demand-
 ing prompt acceptance of its five-point demand of
 15 May,  and staging new demonstrations outside the
 British Embassy.   It is still unclear,  however, how
 far Peking will go in supporting more violent and
 risky actions to force British compliance with Chi-
 nese demands.
 There is no evidence so far that policy in deal-
 ing with the Hong Kong crisis has become an issue in
 the internal struggle in China.   Reports in Chinese
 media of widespread violence and disorder underscore
 the apparent inability of the Peking leaders to exert
 effective authority in some areas.   Peking posters
 have blamed local military commanders for instigat-
 ing clashes with militant Red Guards in at least
 five provinces.
 The brief truce in Vietnam commemorating Bud-
 dha's birth produced no changes in the diplomatic
 impasse.   Although Hanoi routinely denounced US and
 South Vietnamese operations in the southern Demili-
 tarized Zone as an "extremely serious step of war
 escalation,"  it avoided any charge that this opera-
 tion has destroyed the Geneva agreements as a whole.
 There were no indications that Hanoi interpreted
 this operation as foreshadowing an invasion of North
 Vietnam or that it will result in any significant
 changes in Hanoi's war policy.
 Pressure on the fragile unity of Saigon's mil-
 itary leadership increased with an announcement that
 Chief of State Thieu has decided to run for the pres-
 idency.   The rivalry between Thieu and Premier Ky
 apparently encouraged the leading civilian contender,
 former premier Tran Van Huong,  to decide on an earl
 declaration of his candidacy.

 VIETNAM
 US Marine and South Vietnam-
 ese Army  (ARVN)  task force ele-
 ments are in the final phase of
 a major offensive against an esti-
 mated 9,000 North Vietnamese regu-
 lars in the southern portion of
 the Demilitarized Zone  (DMZ)  and.
 adjacent areas of northeastern
 Quang Tri Province.
 The allied campaign began on
 17 May in an effort to relieve
 heavy Communist pressure on five
 Marine outposts--Con Thien, Cam
 Lo, Camp Carroll, Gio Linh,  and
 Dong Ha--on the periphery of a
 strategic 100-square mile area
 just south of the buffer zone.
 Marines positioned in this area
 have suffered heavy casualties
 from two months of steady artil-
 lery, rocket, and mortar bombard-
 ment from emplacements within the
 DMZ.   There had been recent indi-
 cations that elements of at least
 three North Vietnamese regiments
 had completed battlefield prepara-
 tions for a major ground assault
 against the Con Thien garrison.
 Communist resistance to the
 allied push has varied from
 moderate to heavy.   As of 25 May,
 confirmed enemy losses stood at
 641 killed as against allied
 casualties of 125 killed  (101 US)
 and 728 wounded  (613 US).  In ad.-
 dition,  allied units had captured
 and/or destroyed enemy stockpiles
 containing more than 55 tons of
 ammunition,  explosive,  and food-
 stuffs.
 Elsewhere in Quang Tri Prov-
 ince,  two battalions of the lst
 ARVN Regiment killed more than 150
 Communist troops dur__nq a 14-hour
 engagement on 20 and 21 May with
 an estimated North Vietnamese Army
 (NVA) battalion some five miles
 east of Quang Tri city.   On 21 May
 elements of the 325th NVA Divi-
 sion launched a heavy mortar at-
 tack against the allied Special
 Forces camp at Lang Vei near the
 Lao border, but failed to breach
 the camp's defense perimeter in a
 follow-up ground assault.
 Heavy Infiltration Continues
 There are indications of con-
 tinuing North Vietnamese infiltra-
 tion into the DMZ - Quang Tri -
 Thua Thien areas.
 Recently captured documents
 indicate that the 9th Regiment/
 304th NVA Division entered South
 Vietnam via the DMZ on 1 March and
 that at least one of its subordi-
 nate battalions participated in

 the attack against La Vang,  south
 of Quang Tri city, on 6 and 7
 April.   Although the present loca-
 tion of the 9th Regiment is un-
 known,  there is evidence that the
 unit may have reinforced the Com-
 munists'  "Northern Front" military
 command which is responsible for
 operations in Quang Tri and Thua
 Thien provinces.
 In addition,  there are tenu-
 ous indications that elements of
 the 330th NVA Division may be de-
 ploying to South Vietnam.  I
 North Vietnamese Military
 North Vietnam's limited fighter
 aircraft inventory has been seri-
 ously reduced during May with the
 loss of over 30 aircraft. Twenty-
 five have been lost in aerial en-
 gagements and another six, and
 possibly seven,  fighters have been
 destroyed on the ground.   Hanoi's
 operational in-country fighter
 strength is now estimated to be
 about 45 aircraft.
 Despite these significant
 losses, Hanoi has a substantial
 reserve of jet fighters at China's
 Yunnani Airfield with which it can
 maintain at least a limited air
 defense capability.
 Bloc Aid to Hanoi
 A high level Hungarian mili-
 tary delegation led by the minis-
 ter of defense visited Hanoi from
 15 to 23 May.   The almost exclu-
 sively military character of this
 delegation strongly suggests that
 military aid was discussed.   This
 is the first such visit by Hun-
 garian military personnel since
 North Vietnam came under aerial
 attack.   Most other East European
 countries have sent delegations
 to North Vietnam in the past two
 years, but they have been pri-
 marily political in character.
 Hungary has no independent
 capacity to supply Hanoi with
 sophisticated weapons systems
 but could provide small arms and
 support equipment or some trained
 personnel.   The background of the
 men on the delegation would qual-
 ify them to discuss a variety
 of military aid specialities,
 including conventional artillery
 systems.
 Politics in South Vietnam
 Broad hints from Chief of
 State Thieu that he soon plans
 to announce his presidential
 candidacy in opposition to Premier
 Ky are creating some friction in
 the military and perhaps encour-
 aging civilian candidacies.

 In press interviews and pub-
 lic statements last week, General
 Thieu broached the possibility of
 his candidacy, but stopped short
 of committing himself.   Foreign
 Minister Do and Thieu's press of-
 ficer later declared that he had
 definitely decided to run.   No of-
 ficial announcement has yet been
 made, however, and it is still pos-
 sibile that Thieu will not be a
 candidate.   By promoting reports
 of his candidacy in the meantime,
 Thieu is trying to keep his op-
 tions open and to prevent the mil-
 itary establishment from uniting
 behind Ky.
 Ky's supporters are showing
 concern over the possibility of
 Thieu's candidacy.
 Civilian candidates may well
 feel that the war of nerves be-
 tween Thieu and Ky significantly
 enhances their own prospects for
 an electoral victory.                  25X1

 LAOTIAN PREMIER'S POLITICAL MOVES FRUSTRATED
 Laotian Prime Minister Sou-
 vanna's success in electing a more
 amenable National Assembly early
 this year has not yet led to sub-
 stantive progress in resolving
 long-standing political problems.
 The spirit of cooperation
 among regional,  family, and mili-
 tary factions which seemed to be
 emerging after the election has
 diminished as Souvanna has sought
 to implement his oft-stated polit-
 ical goals.   The reassertion of
 factional suspicions and Souvanna's
 failure to win backing for a broad-
 based "united front" have forced
 him to abandon all but the least
 controversial governmental changes.
 One of the unresolved prob-
 lems is the reorganization of the
 cabinet.   Although there is com-
 mon agreement that changes are
 needed, Souvanna has found it
 difficult to make them without
 conflicting with regional inter-
 ests. Thus his efforts to replace

 Deputy Prime Minister Leuam
 Insisiengmay, an obstreperous
 rightist, have foundered on the
 refusal of southern leader Bourn
 Oum to see his protege demoted.
 Souvanna has also attempted
 to remove from Vientiane the left-
 leaning neutralist,  Information
 Minister Pheng Phongsavan, long
 a target of rightist assembly
 deputies, by naming him ambassa-
 dor             to Moscow.   His move was  com-
 plicated by the cool Soviet re-
 sponse to Souvanna's intent to
 name the outgoing ambassador,
 rightist Khampan Panya, to the
 position of foreign minister.
 Unable to make these desired
 changes,  Souvanna will reportedly
 content himself with filling cer-
 tain minor subcabinet positions
 and will retain the foreign min-
 ister's portfolio himself.
 Other political problems,
 such as the designation of a fu-
 ture successor to Souvanna, have
 been placed in abeyance because
 of the regional hostilities which
 they generate.   Souvanna is sen-
 sitive to the fragility of his
 present alliance with key mili-
 tary commanders.   His awareness
 of the danger in pressing changes
 too vigorously will probably
 cause him to pursue a cautious
 course in the coming months.
 On the military front,  the
 Communists appear to be making a
 renewed effort to counter recent
 government initiatives in iso-
 lated areas of northern Laos.
 In late April and early May,
 Communist forces of perhaps two
 battalions captured several for-
 ward guerrilla positions north-
 east of the royal capital of
 Luang Prabang  (see Indochina map
 on page 3).
 Farther east near Communist-
 held Samneua town,  enemy forces
 were reported early this month to
 be moving toward a progovernment
 outpost with access to important
 lines of supply from North Viet-
 nam.   The Communists had been
 pushed back earlier in recent
 fighting in the area.
 Although they are reacting
 to the increased aggressiveness
 of government forces, the Commu-
 nists probably are also trying to
 weaken the government's ability

 HONG KONG GOVERNMENT SUPPRESSES COMMUNIST-LED DISORDERS
 Strong measures by the Hong
 Kong government against Communist-
 led agitation has set back for
 the moment the Communist challenge
 to British authority in the colony.
 Peking is maintaining pressure,
 however,  through diplomatic moves
 and harassment of British diplo-
 mats.
 On 22 May the police used
 tear gas and truncheons to dis-
 perse mobs in the main shopping
 area of Hong Kong island--an
 episode which Communist propaganda
 exploited to spread charges of
 brutality.   The government has
 since banned all unauthorized
 processions and meetings in an
 effort to prevent further inci-
 dents.   Since the disorders began
 on 6 May over 600 demonstrators
 have been sentenced to jail terms
 ranging from three to 18 months.
 In addition, the local au-
 thorities have banned the broad-
 cast of inflammatory statements
 from loudspeakers and set heavy
 penalties for violators.   London
 has approved actions against the
 Peking-controlled Bank of China
 which has acted as a command post
 for the agitation,  and has dis-
 patched a helicopter assault ship
 carrying British commandos.
 Confronted by this firm
 stand,  the Communists appear un-
 certain as to their future course.
 Their influence in leftist
 unions has been spotty.   Sporadic
 busmen's strikes have been only
 partially effective,  and only
 half the employees in the gas
 company responded to a four-hour
 strike call.   Although the Commu-
 nists appear to be planning future
 strikes against the utility com-
 panies, the authorities can prob-
 ably maintain essential services
 with a well-organized emergency
 volunteer corps.
 In Peking on 22 May the Brit-
 ish charge was handed a strong
 protest over alleged British
 "atrocities" in Hong Kong.   The
 Chinese also called for a quick
 reply to the Foreign Ministry
 statement of 15 May which had de-
 manded that the British release
 arrested demonstrators, punish
 those guilty of police brutality,
 make an apology, and guarantee
 that similar actions will not
 occur.
 The British have deliberately
 avoided acknowledging the Chinese
 demands in the hope that Peking
 would let the matter slide.   Since
 many of those arrested have al-
 ready been tried, convicted and
 sentenced,  the British could not
 release them without suffering
 the same loss of face the Portu-
 guese accepted in Macao.
 Peking's reiteration of its
 demands suggests an intention to
 maintain pressure until it gets
 some concessions from the Hong
 Kong authorities.   In other moves,
 Peking ordered the closure of
 the British representative's of-
 fice in Shanghai and on 24 May
 renewed demonstrations outside
 the British Embassy in Peking.

 CONTINUED DISORDER IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Chinese Communist propaganda
 media continue to report wide-
 spread violence involving pro-Mao
 forces in accounts which are prob-
 ably exaggerated and designed to
 discredit local officials.   Their
 circulation underscores Peking's
 difficulty in effecting political
 changes in the provinces, however,
 and implies that leaders in Peking
 disagree on who is to be purged.
 The latest wall posters
 allege that Red Guards have been
 massacred by the hundreds in
 Heilungkiang and Szechwan recently,
 and have been involved in lesser
 conflicts in several other prov-
 inces.   Almost all reports blame
 local military commanders for
 instigating the conflicts.
 In Heilungkiang--long touted
 by Peking as a model area--posters
 claim that regular army troops,
 led by a deputy commander of the
 Heilungkiang Military District,
 joined with "reactionary"  forces
 to attack pro-Mao elements on 14
 and 19 May.   More than a thousand
 people,  including representatives
 of prominent Red Guard organiza-
 tions in Peking, were allegedly
 killed, wounded, or arrested.
 Other posters charge that Wang
 En-mao,  commander of the Sinkiang
 Military Region,  ordered the ar-
 rest of numerous Red Guards in-
 volved in clashes which broke out
 in Urumchi on 16 May.
 Other posters, and some
 provincial broadcasts,  indicate
 that local military commands are
 in open conflict with militant
 Red Guards in Szechwan, Honan,
 Kansu, and Hupeh provinces.   In
 only one area has the regime ap-
 parently taken forceful measures
 to end the fighting.   According
 to one poster on 18 May, Premier
 Chou En-lai ordered troops de-
 ployed into a district of Szechwan
 where local troops had been fight-
 ing Red Guards.   Since then, how-
 ever, additional bloody fighting
 is said to have erupted in other
 parts of the province.
 Peking's handling of recent
 disorders in the provinces has
 been equivocal.   An editorial in
 the People's Daily of 22 May
 strongly denounced those who re-
 sort to violence,  said they had
 caused serious production losses,
 and implied that Mao Tse-tung
 had personally authorized army
 units to intervene and stop vio-
 lent clashes.   There is little
 evidence that this order is being
 vigorously enforced, however, and
 other recent editorials take a
 militant line in stressing the
 need to sustain the drive against
 Mao's enemies,  including those
 who have "sneaked into the army."

 EUROPE
 British Foreign Secretary Brown's delayed visit
 to Moscow began on 22 May.   The Middle East crisis
 probably has commanded primary attention in his dis-
 cussions.
 Both Britain and France are eager to attract
 broad international support for any action that might
 have to be taken in the crisis.   Paris has also ap-
 proached the Russians to use their influence construc-
 tively but received little satisfaction.   The French
 are trying to maintain the position that they are the
 impartial friend of both the Arab and the Israeli
 sides.
 The eyes of the Soviets like everyone else's
 have been drawn toward the Middle East,  and they are
 maintaining a bold front on behalf of the Arabs.
 Moscow's propaganda on the Middle East has forced
 its harangues over Vietnam momentarily into second
 place.   Condemnation of the US military action in
 the Demilitarized Zone and of the bombings in Hanoi
 has been sharp but not high pitched.   Soviet Ambas-
 sador Dobrynin continues his protracted consultations
 in Moscow but,  according to Foreign Minister Gromyko,
 will return to Washington "soon."
 In other areas of US-Soviet relations,  the USSR's
 Supreme Soviet Presidium late last week ratified the
 Outer Space Treaty and,  although the Russians held
 to their tough bargaining position on the Nonprolifer-
 ation Treaty,  they continued to give signs that they
 wanted a treaty signed.   The Soviets continue to ob-
 ject, however,  to the articles on amendments and safe-
 guards,  and negotiations continue in Geneva toward
 some compromise which would permit the draft treaty
 to be tabled before the Eighteen Nation Disarmament
 Committee.

 MOSCOW NAMES NEW KGB CHIEF
 The appointment of party
 secretary Yuri Andropov as chair-
 man of the Committee of State Se-
 curity  (KGB)  this week was prob-
 ably a result of high-level dis-
 satisfaction with the performance
 of that organization and of shift-
 ing power relationships in the
 politburo.   The manner of the
 change suggests that the ousted
 chairman, Vladimir Semichastny,
 who had headed the KGB since 1961,
 is in disfavor.   Semichastn  's
 future remains uncertain
 The public record of the
 KGB's errors during the past year
 or so alone may have been suffi-
 cient to convince the politburo
 that changes in its leadership
 were necessary.   The KGB has no
 doubt been criticized for not
 preventing the defection of Sta-
 lin's daughter and for the intel-
 ligence operations recently ex-
 posed in Northern and Western
 Europe.   Other blots on the KGB's
 record include its involvement
 in the kidnaping of US citizen
 Vladimir Kazan and its alleged
 role in both the Rankovic affair
 in Yugoslavia and attempts to
 subvert Rumanian party officials.
 The party leadership may also
 have been concerned that Semi-
 chastny was becoming so entrenched
 and influential as to escape the
 party's control.   His organiza-
 tion's missteps could then merely
 have hastened the c:iange which
 the leadership probably expects
 will enable the party to tighten
 control over the KGB and ensure
 the subordination of its activi-
 ties to broaden foreign policy
 considerations.
 Thus far there are no good
 clues as to how Kremlin politics
 figure in the change, but Semi-
 chastny's removal could be dam-
 aging to his long-time political
 patron and predecessor as KGB
 chief, politburo member Alek-
 sander Shelepin.   Late last year
 there were rumors--which cropped
 up again about a month ago--that
 Semichastny's removal would be
 the next step in the gradual
 erosion of Shelepin's position.
 During the past month or so, how-
 ever, Shelepin has been more ac-
 tive in tasks outside his assigned
 SECRET

 responsibility for overseeing the
 consumer goods sector of the econ-
 omy.   Most notable was his attend-
 ance with Brezhnev and Andropov
 of last: month's meeting of Euro-
 pean Communists at Karlovy Vary.
 Like the two previous KGB
 chiefs, Andropov is not a profes-
 sional security official.   He has
 been engaged for ten years in over-
 seeing intrabloc party affairs--
 since 1.962 as a member of the cen-
 tral committee secretariat.   Al-
 though bloc unity has weakened
 during this period,  there is no
 good indication that his perform-
 ance has been considered unsatis-
 factory.   At any rate,                          it is
 most unlikely that he would be
 moved to the top security post
 if he were under a cloud.
 Not since Beria's ouster in
 1953 has the security chief simul-
 taneously held a second top po-
 litical post, and it is likely
 that Andropov will have to give
 up his place on the secretariat.
 A central committee plenum would
 be required to formalize changes
 in the secretariat membership.
 Party statutes call for a plenum
 no later than the end of June,
 and it may reassign secretariat
 responsibility for intrabloc re-
 lations and yield further insight
 into the effect of the KGB re-
 shuffle on the leadership.
 EEC MEMBERS TO MEET AT ROME SUMMIT
 The meeting of the Six in
 Rome scheduled for 29-30 May will
 be their first at the summit level
 since 1961.   Originally intended
 to mark the tenth anniversary of
 the Rome treaties establishing
 the EEC and EURATOM,  the summit
 comes at a time when De Gaulle's
 strong opposition to Britain's
 membership in the community
 threatens again to divide France
 from the Five and to cloud pros-
 pects for political cooperation.
 De Gaulle has cast a further
 shadow over the meeting by threat-
 ening to stay away if EEC Commis-
 sion President Hallstein is pres-
 ent.   The French have long been
 hostile to Hallstein as a strong
 and effective advocate of Euro-
 pean supranationality.   De Gaulle's
 behavior in this connection has
 created considerable resentment
 among the Five, but De Gaulle is
 probably counting on their re-
 pressing it in order to avoid
 worsening the atmosphere.   Hall-
 stein apparently is to play no
 official role in the two-day ses-
 sion.
 He recently withdrew his
 candidacy for president of the
 new 14-man commission which is
 to result from the merger of the
 present executives of the EEC,
 EURATOM,  and the Coal-Steel Com-
 munity, and one of the tasks at
 Rome will in fact be to select

 Hallstein's replacement.   This
 may not be easy.   The Italians
 are expected to press for accept-
 ance of one of their candidates.
 EEC Vice Presidents Rey of Bel-
 gium and Mansholt of the Nether-
 lands will also be strong con-
 tenders even though the Six have
 agreed to give first considera-
 tion to an Italian.
 On "political unification,"
 the summit is expected at most to
 make a gesture by agreeing to re-
 institute the periodic meetings of
 the foreign ministers of the Six
 which started after the 1961 sum-
 mit but subsequently were aban-
 doned.   The Five, despite a desire
 for some movement toward political
 unity,  remain suspicious of French
 designs to use such sessions under
 the guise of political consulta-
 tions to take certain matters out
 of the hands of the EEC Council.
 The Five are also reluctant to
 move far in this area without the
 British.   Belgian Foreign Minister
 Harmel in a conversation with Am-
 bassador Knight this week noted the
 impossibility of serious study of
 what the future political organi-
 zation of Europe should be "until
 the UK is either in or out."
 In any 'discussion in Rome of
 British entry,  De Gaulle is likely
 to reiterate the line he took in
 his press conference last week that
 Britain is economically and politi-
 cally unready for full membership.
 He will probably assert that ad-
 mission of the British would dis-
 rupt progress toward integration
 and probably destroy the Community.
 The French are apparently also
 spreading the word--despite its
 inconsistency with the latter
 argument--that De Gaulle will
 demand a complete reorganization
 of the Community to take account
 of new members.   Another line be-
 ing heard from the French is that
 the commission, whose opinion is
 required on entry questions, will
 not be in a position to give ad-
 vice because of the reorganiza-
 tion necessary when the merger
 agreement goes through.
 None of the Five is eager to
 confront the French over British
 entry,  and an open break on the
 question in Rome appears possible
 only if De Gaulle should refuse
 to consider any negotiations with
 the British.   The Dutch are plan-
 ning to try in Rome to form a
 united front of the Five in favor
 of entry negotiations,
 In the meantime,  discussion has be-
 gun on whether or not the UK ap-
 plication should be placed on the
 5-6 June agenda of the EEC Coun-
 cil, as favored by the Belgians
 and Germans.   The discussions in
 Rome may center on this point, but
 the turn of debate on the British
 question remains unpredictable.

 UK RESISTS SPAIN'S PRESSURE ON GIBRALTAR PROBLE
 London is refusing to give
 in to pressures from Madrid to
 relax British control over Gibral-
 tar.
 The present phase of their
 confrontation began in mid-April
 when the Spanish announced a new
 zone prohibited to all air traf-
 fic--a restriction which would
 affect operations at the Gibral-
 tar airport,  especially in bad
 weather.   The British reacted by
 calling off a fifth round of talks
 on the Gibraltar problem scheduled
 for 18 April.   These were to be
 held to comply with a UN General
 Assembly resolution inviting
 both countries to negotiate over
 decolonization of Gibraltar.   The
 British also appealed to the In-
 ternational Civil Aviation Organ-
 ization  (ICAO)  to get the Span-
 iards to postpone the 15 May ef-
 fective date of the prohibited
 zone.   Evidently influenced by
 the Spaniards' argument that the
 problem was a political matter
 not under its jurisdiction,  the
 ICAO Council took no action.
 When the ban took effect,
 the British indicated that their
 civil aircraft would try to comply
 with the restrictions and in bad
 weather would fly to other air-
 fields rather than make major in-
 fringements of the prohibited
 zone.   British instructions per-
 mit minor infringements when nec-
 essary to meet safety require-
 ments.   Good weather during the
 first week of the ban has pro-
 vided no occasion to test these
 instructions.   Spain has made a
 show of keeping British aircraft
 under surveillance with F-86 jets
 and a radar-equipped destroyer.
 On  17 May,  the British re-
 quested direct negotiations with
 Spain about the effects of the
 prohibited area on use of the
 Gibraltar airfield.   When the
 British ambassador delivered the
 note,  the Spanish Foreign Minis-
 try gave him a Spanish note ask-
 ing for prompt resumption of the
 postponed general negotiations
 on Gibraltar.   The British replied
 the following day with a strong
 note which rejected the Spanish
 request for general talks unless
 Spain is willing to lift the air
 traffic restrictions or at least
 discuss this issue.
 The Spanish press announced
 on 23 May that Spain had replied
 with still another note inviting
 the British to send a negotiating
 delegation to Madrid on 5 June.
 The note indicated that although
 the air traffic prohibition has
 gone into effect and will not be
 altered,  the Spanish Government
 will listen to whatever the UK
 desires to say about it.   This
 move may reduce tension b   o

 THE NEW YUGOSLAV GOVERNMENT
 The Yugoslav Government under-
 went a sweeping change of leadership
 this week to conform with a provi-
 sion of the constitution that one
 half of all officials be rotated
 every four years.   The personnel
 changes and accompanying organiza-
 tional adjustments ensure the con-
 tinuation of the regime's economic
 reform program,  further enhance the
 authority of the leaderships in the
 republics,  and neatly balance power
 between the two important rival re-
 publics--Serbia and Croatia.
 Tito,  as expected and as al-
 lowed by the constitution, was re-
 elected to the presidency for the
 fifth straight time.   in the Federal
 Executive Council  (the cabinet),
 however,   nine of the 17 members are
 new and the eight holdovers are
 strong backers of the country's eco-
 nomic reforms.   These include the
 dynamic young liberal, Mika Spiljak,
 and economic expert Kiro Gligorov,
 in the important positions of pre-
 mier and deputy premier,  respective-
 ly.   All but one of the top leaders
 of the Federal Assembly (parliament)
 were rotated.
 Tito's long-time friend,              Defense
 Minister Gosnjak, was rotated out, as
 was Assembly President Edvard Kar-
 delj, who for many years rivaled the
 deposed Aleksandar Rankovic for the
 number two spot behind Tito.   These
 and other former leaders probably
 will become policy advisers.   The
 only important demotion apparently
 was that of Veljko Vlahovic, who was
 not returned to parliament in any
 capacity.   There have been rumors
 that Vlahovic favors closer rela-
 tions with Moscow.
 The changes preserve the im-
 portant nationality balance among
 the major government offices.   Al-
 though two of the top leaders--Tito
 and Spiljak--are Croats, Assembly
 President Popovic is a Serb and be-
 comes second to Tito in the govern-
 ment.                                                                The Serbs, who previously
 had complained that they were not
 receiving a fair share of the key
 positions,  also were given the de-
 fense secretariat and the new secre-
 tariat for economy.
 Organizational adjustments have
 further increased the authority of
 Yugoslavia's six constituent repub-
 lics.                                                                The number of federal secre-
 tariats was reduced from 13 to 6,
 and newly created federal councils
 responsive to the republics were
 created to replace the abolished
 secretariats.
 The election and reorganization
 also diffuses power within the gov-
 ernment.   Tito has not only made it
 difficult for any single successor
 to dominate the party, but he has
 also made accumulation of individual
 power difficult in any future gov-
 ernment.   The post of vice president
 has been abolished and the constitu-
 tional status of the deputy commander
 of the armed forces removed.   Tito
 apparently intends that power will
 devolve to the Federal Assembly,  and
 not to any individual,  following his
 death.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The Arab-Israeli confrontation overshadowed all
 other problems in the Arab world this past week.
 Even if the crisis should be contained,  the latest
 events have raised new political currents.   The Arab
 peoples are fascinated with the prospects of a war
 against Israel.   From Jordan,  for example,  there are
 reports of a rise in Nasir's popularity and a drop
 in King Husayn's, even within the army,  and the King
 has felt obliged to make new gestures toward Arab
 military unity.
 The pace of Egyptian air strikes against royal-
 ists and dissident tribes in Yemen may be slowed by
 the diversion of Egyptian units to Sinai.   For the
 time being,  this would probably also serve to reduce
 Egypt's military threat to Saudi Arabia along the
 Yemen border.
 In Aden,  the two principal nationalist terrorist
 groups are submerging their internecine quarrel and
 focusing anew on the British and the South Arabian
 Federation Government.   Although this may not be re-
 lated to the Arab-Israeli crisis, Adeni nationalist
 leaders have been meeting in Cairo.
 How far the Egyptians push their campaign of vil-
 ification against the US and the UK,  and whether this
 will encompass the sabotage against American proper-
 ties Cairo is calling for, depends on the evolution
 of the crisis.   There is some indication that Cairo
 is preparing to exploit documents purloined from the
 US AID installation in Taiz.

 ARAB-ISRAELI CONFRONTATION AT NEW HIGH
 Nasir's announcement on 22 May
 that the Gulf of Aqaba would be
 closed to Israeli shipping has
 brought the long confrontation be-
 tween the Arab world and Israel as
 close to flash point as it has been
 since 1958.
 The Egyptian proscription on
 shipping into the gulf,  and thus
 into Israel's highly strategic port
 of Eilat,  extends not only to all
 Israeli shipping, but to oil cargoes
 carried by ships of any nation.
 Since the bulk of Israel's oil im-
 ports,  in addition to its exports
 of phosphate now transit the narrow
 Strait of Tiran at the entrance to
 the gulf,  Nasir is threatening what
 the Israeli's view as a vital life
 line.
 The Egyptian announcement came
 on the eve of the departure of the
 element of the United Nations Emer-
 gency Force  (UNEF)  posted at Sharm
 ash-Shaykh southwest of the Strait
 of Tiran.   Its presence had been
 a token of the assurances of safe
 passage for Israeli shipping which
 Tel Aviv won in 1956-57.   Last week,
 Nasir first demanded that the UNEF
 units withdraw temporarily from
 Sinai to the Gaza Strip, and then in-
 sisted that the UNEF be pulled out
 of Egypt altogether.
 Although Nasir may not have ex-
 pected the early withdrawal of the
 UNEF which followed his request,
 the Egyptians moved rapidly to rein-
 force and occupy their military po-
 sitions in Sinai.   Until his threat
 to intercept shipping was issued,
 the Egyptian deployments were con-
 sistent with the assumption of a
 defensive posture which would be
 touted as indicating his readiness
 to attack Israel in the event of an
 Israeli strike against Syria.   Now,
 however, Nasir has put himself in
 a position where he must either fol-
 low up on his threat or retire be-
 hind a smokescreen of allegations
 of international pressure.
 Egyptian forces have deployed
 to Sharm ash-Shaykh, which controls
 the narrow   Strait of Tiran and the
 ship passage hugging the Sinai coast.
 Additional naval units have been sent
 south to the Gulf of Suez and the
 northern Red Sea.   These forces would
 be employed in a ship interception
 operation.
 Egyptian public statements
 about mining the entrance to the
 Gulf of Aqaba, however, may be ex-
 aggerations.   Whether or not Egyp-
 tian units will interfere with ship-
 ping given military escort also is
 not clear.   Nasir, however, has
 threatened this,  and if he felt
 hard pressed he migh': shoot regard-
 less.
 The first test of the blockade
 is expected sometime in the next few
 days, when two tankers of Liberian
 registry, but possibly Israeli owned,
 are due at Eilat with cargoes of
 Iranian crude oil.
 All the Arab states in the area
 have undertaken some kind of military

 Statements from Damascus mean-
 while,  give no indication that Syria
 intends to exercise any restraint
 over terrorist forays into Israel
 by the Palestinian groups it sup-
 ports.   The Israelis report finding
 more explosives on 25 May.   There
 are indications, however,  that Egyp-
 tian authorities in the Gaza Strip
 have acted to ensure against forays
 into Israel from Gaza.   Increased
 patrolling on both sides of the Is-
 raeli border in the Gaza sector has
 led to several incidents, but so
 far these have not been permitted
 to get out of hand.
 King Husayn of Jordan has been
 put in a most difficult position by
 the onset of the crisis.   On the one
 hand, his government is making every
 effort to ensure against the mount-
 ing of terrorist operations via
 Jordan.   On the other, as a good
 Arab he has felt obliged to make
 gestures toward joining in with
 Egyptian and Syrian military plan-
 ning.                   This has been rebuffed, but
 if an Arab-Israeli clash erupted he
 would probably feel similarly obliged
 to put Jordanian forces into action
 as well.   According to reports from
 Jordan,  there is an upsurge of popu-
 lar support for Nasir, particularly
 among Palestinian Jordanians, over
 his measures toward confronting
 Israel, and a parallel decline in
 popular support for the King, even
 within the army which has so long
 been the mainstay of his regime.
 Amman has withdrawn its repre-
 sentatives from Damascus in retalia-
 tion for the explosion on 21 May of
 a bomb carried over the border into
 Jordan in a Syrian automobile.   This
 killed 16 people near the border
 checkpoint.
 The Israelis are standing on
 Prime Minister Eshkol's statement
 of 23 May that Egyptian interference
 with shipping would be considered
 an act of aggression.   The most re-
 cent Israeli statements,  in contrast
 to those of the Arabs, have been
 relatively restrained, but,  at the
 same time,  the Israelis are taking
 care not to tip their hand.   They
 evidently regard the Egyptian de-
 ployments as a more serious threat
 than they had previously considered
 them.
 The USSR, whose attitude may
 determine whether or not the Syrians
 and in particular the Egyptians push
 events toward a conflict,  is main-
 taining a bold front on behalf of
 the Arabs.   In public statements and
 in talks with Western representatives
 the Soviets have backed the Arabs
 and condemned Israel and her "im-
 perialist supporters," and in the
 UN the Soviet response to sugges-
 tions for multilateral consultations
 has been negative.
 There have been hints, however,
 that in private the Soviets may be
 counseling both Cairo and Damascus
 to exercise more restraint in their
 actions than in their propaganda.

 Initial Western efforts in the
 UN Security Council to find some
 formula for defusing the crisis were
 stalled when they met opposition
 from the Afro-Asians and the Commu-
 nist nations.   Further action along
 these lines presumably depends on
 Secretary General U Thant's report
 on his meetings in Cairo with the
 Egyptian :Leaders.   Some UN members
 are trying to find a way to re-
 establish a UN presence to fill the
 void left by the abrupt departure
 of the UNEF from Sinai.   The UN
 might,  for example,  try to work
 through the defunct Egyptian-Is-
 raeli Mixed Armistice Commission on
 the UAR side of the border and on
 the Israeli side through the UN
 Truce Supervision Organization,
 which is still active along the
 Israeli borders with Jordan, Syria,
 and Lebanon.   There have been some
 signs from Cairo and Tel Aviv that
 both are rethinking their attitudes
 toward such bodies, but their first
 reactions were generally negative.
 As the crisis has developed,
 Arab propaganda from Cairo and
 Damascus has become increasingly
 vituperative in its allegations
 that "the colonialists" and the US
 have plotted with the Israelis to
 flout Arab interests and take over
 the Middle East.  In Arab propaganda,
 the situation is portrayed more and
 more as a confrontation with the US,
 and calls are being issued for at-
 tacks and sabotage against American
 installations and properties
 throughout the Arab world.   If the
 crisis is defused,  in the UN or
 through US or other Western pres-
 sures,  Cairo--even though it may
 welcome it in private--can be
 counted on to portray this as a
 blatant exercise of imperialism and
 to step up its campaign of agitation
 against the US throughout the Mid-
 dle East.

 FIRST STEP IN GREECE TOWARD RETURN TO CONSTITUTIONALITY
 King Constantine's 21 May
 announcement of the formation of
 a committee to revise the consti-
 tution within six months marks
 the first move by the new Athens
 government toward returning to a
 parliamentary system.   Previously,
 the members of the junta had re-
 fused to be pinned down to a
 schedule.
 The task of rewriting the
 constitution will doubtless oc-
 cupy the committee for the full
 six months.   Even after this,
 moreover,  it will probably be
 several more months before the
 government would be ready to pre-
 sent it to the public in a na-
 tional referendum.
 As the new government enters
 its second month in office its
 hold on the country remains un-
 challenged by any overt domestic
 resistance.   So far economic ac-
 tivity has been normal.   Life in
 general appears on the surface to
 be going on as usual, with the
 public neither conspicuously en-
 dorsing nor rejecting the group
 in power.   The new government in
 fact has been able to allow a
 gradual easing of its original
 restrictions on the population
 without triggering any acts of
 opposition.
 The coup leaders have re-
 mained out of public view for
 the last few days,  apparently hard
 at work on two matters of great
 importance to them---the removal
 of bureaucratic "deadwood" from
 government offices and the prepa-
 ration of cases against the political
 prisoners who are later to be
 brought to trial.
 he retirement
 of a number of high-ranking offi-
 cers and the reshuffling of the
 Orthodox Church hierarchy evoked
 little public response.
 Relations with. the King ap-
 pear workable, although not cor-
 dial.   Constantine's efforts to
 keep himself in the public eye
 and to avoid being upstaged by
 the junta members were aided by
 the timely arrival of an heir ap-
 parent on the King's nameday,
 21 May.   The King plans to make a
 royal tour of military installa-
 tions  "down to company level" dur-
 ing the next week or so, and will
 undoubtedly do his best to increase
 the personal allegiance he com-
 mands within the army.
 There is no real evidence of
 a split between the new regime's
 two strong men, Papadopoulos and
 Pattakos.   There have been occa-
 sional rumors that one is develop-
 ing, but these may be based on
 wishful thinking.   A recurrent
 theme is that Pattakos,  a native
 of Crete, has shown favoritism
 to his fellow islanders and that
 this is resented by Pa ado oulos.

 INDIAN PARLIAMENT OPENS DIFFICULT SESSION
 The current session of
 India's; Parliament  (22 May - 11
 August)  promises to test the
 cohesiveness and effectiveness of
 the ruling Congress Party and of
 Prime Minister Gandhi's new cab-
 inet.
 The party's position in this
 first full-scale session of the
 new Parliament since its election
 in February appears on the surface
 to be marginally strengthened
 over that in the initial short
 inaugural session  (18 March - 18
 April).   During that session the
 opposition parties--despite their
 substantial ideological differ-
 ences--were able to demonstrate
 increasing solidarity under the
 unifying influence of a common
 desire to discredit the already
 humbled. Congress Party.
 Now, however,  the defections
 from the opposition front which
 contributed to its loss of the
 recent presidential contest to
 the Congress candidate have led
 to bickering which has damaged
 the image of cohesiveness which
 the opposition parties had managed
 to project at the national level.
 Nevertheless,  they will undoubt-
 edly continue to seek every op-
 portunity to embarrass and dis-
 tract the government.
 At. the same time,  the Con-
 gress Party's unity and confidence,
 althouc[h probably restored some-
 what by its impressive victory in
 the presidential contest,  is still
 in question.   Potentially trouble-
 some cleavages within its hier-
 archy and incipient unrest among
 a few Congress members of Parlia-
 ment were only superficially
 papered over in a recent lengthy
 meeting of the party high com-
 mand.   The opposition parties,
 however, offer little attraction
 to potential Congress defectors
 at the national level.
 The major piece of legisla-
 tion to be considered at this
 session of Parliament is the an-
 nual general budget.   No matter
 what its character and content,
 this will be subject to contro-
 versy.   Deputy Prime Minister and
 Finance Minister Morarji Desai
 is  expected  to submit a stand-
 still budget directed mainly at
 controlling excessive deficit
 financing and halting India's
 spiraling inflation.
 Present economic stagnation
 is expected to continue at least
 until crops are harvested next
 autumn.   This is bound to heat up
 the political atmosphere this
 summer and provide ample oppor-
 tunity for opposition grandstand-
 ing.   Center-state problems as
 well as possible crises in some
 of the state governments not con-
 trolled by the Congress Party may
 provide further distractions.
 This may especially be the case
 in West Bengal, governed by a
 coalition in which the Communists
 are the largest element.   Here,
 the uncertain internal security
 situation is a source of great
 concern to New Delhi.                  25X1

 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NIGERIAN CRISIS
 Lt. Col. Gowon, head of
 Nigeria's federal government, has
 made a new attempt to conciliate
 Eastern Governor Ojukwu, but the
 odds continue to favor eventual
 secession of the Eastern Region.
 and some form of federal military
 counteraction.
 Last week, Gowon ordered the
 lifting of economic sanctions
 against the East and asked Ojukwu
 to demonstrate good faith by
 revoking his recent antifederal
 edicts,  as well as by releasing
 railroad cars being held in the
 East and returning hijacked
 aircraft.   In thus accepting the
 recommendations of the unofficial
 civilian National Conciliation
 Committee, Gowon is trying to
 show that he is doing all he can
 to prevent the breakup of the
 federation.
 Gowon has indicated
 hat with this initiative
 he is also laying the groundwork
 for stronger action against Ojukwu
 at a later date should this be
 decided on.   Operational military
 planning by federal staff offi-
 cers is clearly continuing, and
 probably includes military action
 aimed at least at supporting
 guerrilla activity among Eastern
 minority tribes.   Such action
 might well go hand in hand with
 a federal decree creating addi-
 tional states separating the
 majority Ibos in the East from
 the minority tribes.
 Although the East has not
 yet formally responded to Gowon's
 initiative,  it is unlikely at
 this time to take any signifi-
 cant step backward -from its course
 toward secession.   Indeed,  the
 Eastern Region's Consultative
 Assembly, scheduled to meet on
 26 May,  reportedly will give
 Ojukwu a mandate to declare the
 East independent, as the "Repub-
 lic of Biafra," whenever he de-
 cides the time is ripe.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Turbulence continued to dominate the domestic
 scene in a number of Latin American countries last
 week while diplomatic activity in the area was gen-
 erally low-key and inconclusive.
 Little forward movement has been made recently
 by either Venezuela or the Organization of American
 States in deciding just how to handle the latest ex-
 ample of Cuban subversion in Venezuela.   The main
 Venezuelan labor confederation has reinstituted a
 boycott of shipping from countries trading with Cuba,
 but government officials in Caracas and elsewhere in
 Latin America are increasingly pessimistic about
 chances of getting multilateral agreement on any
 more meaningful anti-Castro measures than those
 limited ones now in effect.
 Students and their violence-oriented activities
 are continuing to plague authorities in several coun-
 tries.   In Panama, Communist-controlled students try-
 ing to re-enact the anti-US student riots of May 1958
 were at least temporarily squelched by local security
 forces.   The Mexican state of Sonora, where martial
 law has been imposed in the wake of prolonged student
 rioting against the government,  is calm but tense as
 arrests continue.   Brazilian students apparently are
 becoming more rambunctious as a result of the rela-
 tive permissiveness of the Costa e Silva administra-
 tion and were able to stage new demonstrations in
 Rio de Janeiro on 24 May.
 There was little change in the insurgency situ-
 ations in Bolivia and Guatemala during the week al-
 though the number of terrorist incidents in the lat-
 ter country increased despite heavy pressure from
 army and police forces.   The number of terrorist
 incidents in the Dominican Republic dropped, how-
 ever,  and political tensions there subsided a bit
 as a result.   Meanwhile, on the other end of the
 island, Haitian dictator Duvalier continued what ap-
 pears to be a general housecleaning of possible
 troublemakers from his security forces and govern-
 ment entourage, making the first cabinet changes

 MEXICAN GOVERNMENT CRACKS DOWN IN SONORA
 25X1
 A wave of arrests continues
 in Mexico's northwestern border
 state of Sonora, where the tense
 calm of martial law has replaced
 antigovernment rioting.
 Student leaders of the three-
 month-old movement opposing the
 nomination of Faustino Felix Serna
 for governor are seeking refuge
 in the United States.   Mounting
 popular indignation following the
 arrest of prominent citizens in
 many parts of the state has led
 to a steady build-up of federal
 troops to supplement the 1,200
 soldiers already stationed in
 Sonora a week ago.
 The governing Institutional
 Revolutionary Party  (PRI)  is un-
 doubtedly alarmed by the wide
 support for the Sonora opposition,
 which is essentially a protest
 against Mexico's system of polit-
 ical dictation or "imposition" of
 candidates.   Indicative of a ris-
 ing demand throughout Mexico for
 more honest and democratic repre-
 sentation in the power structure
 are the many ovations accorded
 ousted PRI president Carlos
 Madrazo by student and labor au-
 diences.   Madrazo, a champion of
 democratization,  is in extreme
 disfavor with the party hierarchy.
 Government maneuvering behind
 the scenes is implicit in the ab-
 sence of reaction outside the
 state to the army occupation of
 the University of Sonora.   Mexican
 students,  sensitive to government
 violation of university autonomy,
 normally respond vehemently to
 such action.
 A new dimension has been
 added to the political situation
 with the entrance of a Party of
 National Action  (PAN)  candidate
 into the race for covernor of
 Sonora.   The PAN,  identified with
 the right in Mexico, has provided
 the ruling PRI with its most
 energetic competition.   PRI has
 not lost an important election
 for a generation, though,  and
 even a good showing by a defeated
 opposition,  should a large-scale
 defection by PRI dissidents occur
 in the 2 July elections, would
 be a significant political event
 in Mexico.

 BRAZILIAN POLICY DIRECTION CAUSES CONCERN
 There is growing concern
 among responsible Brazilian mili-
 tary and political leaders over
 President Costa e Silva's failure
 to assert firm leadership in
 either domestic or foreign mat-
 ters.
 In the absence of clearly
 defined administration policies,
 politically ambitious cabinet
 ministers are maneuvering for
 position.   This is leading to
 some instability in the cabinet
 and to the development of cen-
 trifugal forces within the gov-
 ernment?  to the detriment of cen-
 tralized planning and authority.
 Particularly criticized has
 been the "independent" foreign
 policy vigorously espoused by
 Foreign Minister Jose Magalhaes
 Pinto.
 For example,  the Foreign
 Ministry has backed away from
 Castello Branco's strong support
 of the US position in Vietnam.
 In an appearance before Congress,
 Magalhaes Pinto became the first
 Page 29
 authoritative Brazilian spokesman
 in several years to fail to indi-
 cate solidarity with the US,  say-
 ing instead that Brazil will re-
 main "distant" from that conflict.
 Also, despite repeated pri-
 vate reassurances to US officials,
 the government has done virtually
 nothing to halt recent anti-US
 incidents.   Security officials
 reportedly have expressed alarm
 over government indifference
 toward large anti-US student dem-
 onstrations.   Top military leaders
 fear that unless the government
 reacts more firmly to extremist-
 inspired student agitation than
 it has in recent weeks,  increas-
 ingly provocative demonstrations
 may cause it eventually to react
 with undue force.
 Many Brazilians are becoming
 concerned over Costa e Silva's
 preoccupation with seeking popu-
 larity at the expense of clearly
 defined policies and effective
 leadership.   He has shown a de-
 finite reluctance to intervene in
 issues where his action might
 erode his public support.   Costa
 e Silva retains strong support
 from the bulk of the military.
 The military, however, could prob-
 ably be an effective brake only
 on policies that might threaten
 its own vital interests.               25X1

 PERU'S FISCAL CRISIS CAUSING POLITICAL PROBLEMS
 A worsening economic and
 fiscal crisis in Peru has forced
 a major confrontation between
 President Belaunde and the oppo-
 sition-controlled Congress which
 could lead to military interven-
 tion.
 At issue is the administra-
 tion's request for general au-
 thority to levy new taxes to meet
 the crisis.   Specifically, Peru
 is facing increasing inflationary
 pressures and a deteriorating
 balance of payments.   The budget
 deficit is approaching $200 mil-
 lion compared with last year's
 deficit of $66 million.   Foreign
 reserves dropped from $140 million
 at the end of March to only $105
 million on 22 May.
 As a partial remedy the
 government has frozen the salaries
 of all government employees and
 has proposed sharp cuts in non--
 military expenditures.   On 8 May,
 Finance Minister Mariategui  ap-
 peared before Congress with the
 government's plan.   He warned that
 currency devaluation could result
 unless new taxes were authorized.
 The President's opponents in
 Congress, however,  claim the pro-
 posed measures fall primarily on
 the working classes--a major
 bastion of political strength for
 the largest opposition party,
 APRA.   APRA leaders have proposed
 instead even greater budgetary
 austerity, which would affect
 many of the President's pet
 projects.
 In the face of this polit-
 ical stalemate, rumors have begun
 to circulate that military leaders
 are restless and that the Presi-
 dent may be planning some extra-
 legal moves.   US Embassy officials
 have received reliable information
 that Belaunde told leaders of his
 own party on 18 May that he plans
 to dissolve Congress--presumably
 when it reconvenes next week--at
 least long enough to implement
 tax measures by decree, although
 the constitution has no provisions

 Some reports reaching the
 embassy indicate that the military
 will support the President by
 serving notice on the Congress
 that it must comply with the execu-
 tive's request for new tax author-
 ity or face dissolution.   Still
 other rumors have it that the
 cabinet is about to be reconsti-
 tuted to include military officers
 or that a new all-military cabinet
 is to be appointed.

 CUBA PLEDGES TO SUPPORT SUBVERSION
 Cuba's admission of complic-
 ity in the landing of a guerrilla
 team on the coast of Venezuela on
 8 May is a measure of the Castro
 regime's commitment to violent
 revolution.   In openly admitting
 involvement in the incident, Cuba
 effectively laid to rest any
 suspicion that the affair was
 staged by Venezuelan officials
 to provide "proof" of Cuban in-
 tervention.
 A communique made public in
 Havana on 18 May acknowledged
 that three infiltrators captured
 by Venezuelan forces after the
 landing were Cuban nationals,  and
 defiantly announced that "we in-
 deed are giving help, and shall
 continue to give help as many
 times as we may be asked to do so,
 to all the revolutionary movements
 fighting against imperialism in
 any part. of the world."   Although
 the communique was issued in the
 name of the central committee of
 the Cuban Communist Party,  it
 bears all the marks of Fidel
 Castro's flamboyant and aggres-
 sive style.
 The communique, perhaps a
 tactical blunder, may have been
 precipitated by frustration over
 several reverses the Cubans have
 recently experienced in attempting
 to export revolution.   On 8 May,
 President Balaguer of the Domin-
 ican Republic announced that an
 agent of Cuban intelligence, with
 a clandestine radio and espionage
 paraphernalia, had been seized
 in Santo Domingo.   On 3 May, the
 Colombian Government announced
 the capture of a courier involved
 in smuggling counterfeit passports
 to Havana.
 The Bolivian Army,  recovering
 from a clash with Cuban-supported
 guerrillas, on 20 April captured
 Jules Regis Debray,  a noted French
 intellectual and highly touted
 exponent of Castro's revolutionary
 philosophy who recently spent a
 year in Cuba.   In Guatemala,  Luis
 Turcios Lima,  leader of a Cuban-
 supported guerrilla group called
 the Rebel Armed Forces, was killed
 in an automobile accident last
 October.   In Mexico,  a Cuban dip-
 lomat had to be recalled last
 September when he was caught in
 the roundup of a clandestine ring
 supplying arms to Guatemalan
 guerrillas.
 The incident in Venezuela,
 therefore,  is merely the latest
 in a long string of Cuban setbacks
 in the field of subversion.   The
 communique makes it clear, how-
 ever,  that the Castro regime will
 not slacken its efforts to provide
 material support for pro-Cuban
 insurgents where chances for their
 success are judged to be high.

 OAS MOVING CAUTIOUSLY ON CUBAN AGGRESSION ISSUE
 Members of the Organization
 of American States are reacting
 with considerable caution to
 Venezuela's call for early action
 against Cuban subversion.   All
 Latin American countries approve
 calling a consultative meeting of
 foreign ministers of the OAS,
 but many of them feel that a con-
 sensus should first be reached
 on exactly what the meeting is
 to accomplish.   They fear that a
 hastily called meeting without a
 definite objective will only un-
 derline the impotence of the OAS
 in the face of Cuban support for
 Latin American revolutionaries.
 Some governments,  such as
 the Frei government in Chile,
 although willing to support a
 consultative meeting of foreign
 ministers, have suggested that
 the OAS has already exhausted
 its legal possibilities of action
 against Castro and would prefer
 that the present case be taken
 instead to the UN.
 Venezuela recognizes that
 a mere condemnation by the OAS
 without specific sanctions will
 have little effect on Cuban sub-
 version.   It also recognizes that
 application of the few measures
 still possible under the OAS
 charter,  such as a blacklist of
 firms trading with Cuba, will not
 curb Castro.   After Havana's
 statement on 18 May admitting its
 interference in Venezuelan af-
 fairs, however, President Leoni
 said that Castro's regime must be
 punished "at all costs" and that
 if the OAS does not take action,
 "Venezuela will have to do it on
