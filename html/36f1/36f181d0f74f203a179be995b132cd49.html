-DICLUNIST PROPAGANINDICATIONS BEARING ON  
PRESENT SITUATION AND'DEVELOBENTS IN INDOCHINA 
Summary and Conclusions  
1 (I A 4) Viet Minh propaganda over the past six months provides the follow-
ing indications concerning the situation in Viet Minh-held territory: 
a. The intensification of Ho Government propaganda and action 
on both the foreign and domestic levels and the military 
successes of Viet Minh troops have largely been unable to 
counter the apparent decline in the morale of Viet Minh 
cadres and supporters, particularly among the peasantry. 
b. The decline in morale is evidenced by charges of "unreli-
ability" against cadres, lack of personal integrity, dis-
regard for "public property," and laxness with respect to 
the "prompt and complete" implementation of Government 
orders. 
c. Repeated calls for cooperation in the economic effort and 
frequent reiteration of long-standing failures and short-
comings indicate that the unfavorable conditions represent 
a constant source of concern to the Viet Minh. EMphasis 
on women's participation in all fields of activity and new 
regulations to correct "erroneous" labor recruitment 
methods suggest that the Viet Minh are still unable to 
exploit available manpower to the greatest advantage. 
d. The question of peasant support continues to be a problem 
for the Ho Government. Marxist propaganda has in some 
areas failed to take root among the peasantry, and the 
Viet Minh seem forced to resort to coercion as much as 
to persuasion to secure peasant adherence. 
2 (II B 4) Viet Minh propaganda and the policy statements of Ho Government 
leaders during the past six months indicate that: 
a. The Viet Minh are intent on the implementation of a far-
reaching political and economic program to create condi-
tions similar to those which existed in the early stages 
of the People's Democracies, and in particular to those 
which developed during the first phases of the Chinese 
Communist regime after the victory on the mainland. The 
results of this program are apparently expected to aid 
in coping with the mounting economic difficulties that 
beset the regime, and in securing the adherence of the 
peasant masses who are publicized as the program's 
prime beneficiaries.

b. The Bo Government seeks to consolidate the dominant role 
of the Lao Dong Party and impose acceptance of Communist 
values in the areas under Viet Minh control, even at the 
risk of alienating still further various non-Marxist na-
tionalist elements who are becoming increasingly disaffected. 
c. The Viet Minh appear intent on broadening the scope of 
the Indochina conflict by giving increased support to 
Communist-oriented "liberation" forces in Cambodia and 
Laos, and by extending full-scale military activities 
to these areas, 
3 (II B 6) The intentions of the Chinese Communists toward Indochina remain 
obscure in the propaganda. Chinese affirmations of support for the Viet 
Minh are couched only in the most general terms, while references to 
China and the USSR reveal no marked deference to one over the other. 
Certain belligerent and defensive elements, similar to those which 
appeared in Chinese Communist propaganda immediately before the Chinese 
intervention in Korea, have recurred with increased frequency in both 
Soviet and Chinese Communist propaganda. These elements, however, have 
thus far assumed no definite pattern and do not constitute a major com-
ponent of the propaganda.

.GOMMUNIST PROPAGANDA INDICATIONS BEARING ON  
PRESENT SITUATION AND DEVELOPMENTS IN INDOCUNA 
;dscussion 
A. (IA4) Conditions in Viet Minh-held Territory: 
1. Despite repeated propaganda claims that "the situation is more favor-
able" to the Viet Minh than ever before, that the Viet Minh have 
"gained the initiative" in the fighting and have driven the enemy 
into a "defensive position," and that the "forces of liberation" 
are constantly growing stronger and forging closer ties with the 
"world camp of peace and democracy" headed by the Soviet Union, it 
seems apparent that the intensification of Ho Government propaganda 
and actions, and even the military successes scored by Viet Minh 
troops in specific sectors of the changing theaters of conflict, 
have largely been unable to counter the adverse effect on Viet Minh 
morale produced by. war-weariness. The failure of the Ho Government 
to make good its oft-reiterated promise of a "general counter-
offensive" that would bring final victory, the continuously de-
teriorating economic conditions, and the growth in strength and 
striking power of the French Union forces undoubtedly are the prin-
cipal factors that contribute to the decline of Viet Minh morale, 
a. References to the "general counteroffensive" have become in-
creasingly rare in Viet Minh propaganda. The last reference 
to such an undertaking is contained in a 1952 year-end Ho Cabi-
net report, which merely notes that the Government is committed 
to "lay the foundations for a counteroffensive and set up bases 
for final victory." The consistent failure of the propaganda 
to widely reaffirm this military goal, which in past years has 
constituted the touchstone of Viet Minh military propaganda, 
suggests that the Ho Government is sensitive on this point and 
aware of the limitations of Viet Minh military strength. 
b. Although the strength of the French Union forces and the mili-
tary abilities of Bao Dal "puppet" troops continue to be dis-
paraged by the Viet Minh, the propaganda has recently shown 
increased concern with, and reacted more promptly to, announced 
plans to step up U.S. aid to the Associated States. Vehement 
and voluminous comment marked Viet Minh--as we44s Soviet and 
Chinese Communist--reaction to the recent U.S.-French talks in 
Washington and to the Indochinese tours of General Clark and 
Marshal Juin. Viet Minh propaganda admitted that increased 
U.S. aid will create "a few more difficulties" for the resist-
ance fighters, and urged the people to be "still more vigilant" 
against enemy maneuvers, tighten ranks more closely, and 
"struggle on resolutely toward final victory."

Tt?V S VW F.+ ? 
c. .An indication of apparently poor morale even among Lao Dong Party 
cadres is contained in Viet Minh comment marking the 3 March anni-
versary of the Party's formal establishment. Central Committee 
member Nguyen Thuong Vu charged "some Party members" with "having 
betrayed their honor" by cheating in paddy and tax collections, 
"considering the Party without value," and putting "personal and 
family interests" above Party requirements. He urged "criticism 
and self-criticism" in order to improve cadre morale and perform-
ance. Popular resistance to Viet Minh policies was revealed in a 
Ho Chi Minh speech on the same anniversary castigating local Party 
cadres for failure to "fully carry out the policies of the Party, 
the Government, and the Lien Viet Front." 
2. Charges of "unreliability" against cadres, lack of personal integrity, 
disregard for "public property," and laxness with respect to "prompt 
and full" implementation of government orders have become a prominent 
feature in Ho Government propaganda, and have been reiterated by 
Government and Lao Dong Party leaders on several recent occasions. 
During the past six months the Viet Minh leadership has been greatly 
concerned with economic problems, and repeated appeals have been made 
to the people to increase production and "improve the standard of 
living" of both civilians and soldiers. The participation of women 
in all fields of activity is widely publicized and encouraged, and 
repeated exhortations and new regulations to correct "erroneous" 
methods of labor recruitment and utilization indicate that the man-
power problem is still a critical one. 
a, .An official report issued in January Of this year on the work of 
the Ho Government in 1952 and its projects for 1953 criticizes 
the "poor" efforts of propaganda cadres, unwarranted "leniency" 
shown by local authorities toward "traitors and criminals," mis-
use of "national.property," and the unsatisfactory results ob-
tained in the Government's tax collection, production, and econo-
mization program. The work plan for 1953 specifically calls for 
more efficient tax collection and greater production to improve 
the standard of living. 
b. The active participation of women in the Viet Minh resistance 
struggle, including guerrilla fighting, is detailed in a 15 April 
message sent by the "Vietnamese Vomen's Union" to the "Women's 
International Democratic Federation." 
c. Shortcomings in the manpower program and concern with morale among 
workers and peasants conscripted for public labor were revealed 
in an October 1952 Ho Government directive, which criticized 
cadres for using "arbitrary" methods and underscored the need to 
"make people understand their duty" to join in the "people's 
labor projects." In a January 1953 Cabinet report, Viet Minh 
military commander Vo Nguyen Giap noted that the "replenishing" 
of the resistance forces was a task which must be "resolutely" 
carried out this year. No indication was given as to the source 
from Which the additional manpower was to be drawn.

3. A shift in Viet Minh propaganda emphasis, noticeable since 1952, from 
questions of over-all production to those concerning peasant life and 
farm economy indicates that the problem of peasant support looms large 
for the Ho Government, from a political point of view as well as with 
regard to a more complete exploitation of the country's agricultural 
potential. The stress laid on peasant welfare and the material in-
ducements held out to the peasants in terms of,land redistribution, 
lower taxes,-and other rewards indicate that the Ho Government is at-
tempting to stimulate increased food production, and is making an ef-
fort to counteract the effect which the Bao Dai land reform program 
may have on the political loyalty of Vietnamese peasants both in and 
outside Viet Minh-controlled area. However, the thorough manner in 
which the Viet Minh are attacking the agrarian problem suggests that 
they are not trying merely to remedy an existing situation unfavorable 
to them, but are apparently determined to establish the basis of a 
farm economy possibly designed to evolve along the lines of the pre-
sent Chinese Communist model.* Marxist propaganda has apparently not 
had the desired effect of marshalling peasant support solidly behind 
the Ho Government, and the Viet Minh seem forced to rely on coercion 
as much as on persuasion in order to secure the adherence of the 
peasants. 
a. The Ho Government's growing concern with the peasant problem was 
brought into sharp focus in the summer of 1952, when a series of 
tax reductions on agricultural products, particularly rice, and 
special exemptions for certain categories of peasants was an-
nounced in an apparent effort to increase peasant support and 
stimulate food production. Further evidence of concern with 
these closely related issues was revealed in an October 1952 
Cabinet announcement that plans were to be worked out to stimu-
late the production of crops other than rice, in order to aug-
ment the food supply, increase the prosperity of the peasants, 
and emancipate the country from a one-crop economy. The agri-
cultural plan for 1953 also calls for "encouraging crop diver-
sity" and, in particular, for a ten-percent increase in rice 
production--an implicit admission of the reported rice shortage 
in the Viet Minh-controlled area. 
b. Ho Chi Mirth's call for "full implementation" of the agrarian re-
form in his Resistance Anniversary message of December 1952 
underscored that increased material benefits, in the form of 
land redistribution and lower taxes, land rents, and loan in-
terests, must immediately be made available to the peasant masses 
who constitute the overwhelming majority of the population and 
who endure the heaviest burden of the resistance. In return, 
the peasants were asked to have a "clearer understanding" of 
their duties, to engage in the resistance struggle "with more 
enthusiasm," and to support Viet Minh policies "without reserva-
tion." Subsequent propaganda emphasized that a planned improve-
ment in the living conditions for the peasants wodd heighten 
their "enthusiasm" for the resistance struggle, and induce them 
to increase food production and "join the troops and...the auxi-
liary services of the army." Full "mobilization Of the peasant 
masses" and uninterrupted implementation of the agrarian reform 
program were decreed as the Government's "principal task" for 
the current year by a joint session of the Standing Committee of

the Viet Minh "National Assembly" and the National Committee of 
the Lien Viet Front, held in March. The decision was ratified 
by the Ho Cabinet, which has ordered the redistribution among 
loyal working peasants of land belonging to "foreign colonial-
ists" and Vietnamese "traitors," and the retroactive reduction 
of land rents and loan interests. 
c. Viet Minh efforts to counter the possible effects of the Bao Dai 
Government's land reform program include offers of land to Viet-
namese "puppet" troops who desert from the French Union forces, 
and wide publicity is given to the allotment of land to Bao Dai 
Army defectors. Viet Minh irritation with Nationalist Premier 
Nguyen Van Tam's social reform program is seen particularly in 
propaganda blasts which deride the Bao Dai land reform as "an 
illusory distribution of land" that will never improve the liv-
ing conditions of the peasants. Tam himself is bitterly assailed 
as "this unscrupulous bloodhound who now claims to be a revolu-
tionary socialist." 
d. Although the confident tone and positive approach of the propa-
ganda seem designed to negate in advance any implications of 
peasant resistance to the Viet Minh agrarian reform and intensi-
fied mobilization of the peasants, instances of punishment of 
recalcitrant landowners and other "reactionary" elements are 
cited. Ho Chi Minh's appeal to landowners to "cooperate volun-
tarily and on their own initiative" with the Viet Minh program 
carried with it an implied threat of drastic Government action if 
necessary. Vice Premier Pham Van Dong declared recently(in March) 
that a majority of landowners "continue the exploitation and op-
pression" of the peasant masses, and the Cabinet decree on agrarian 
reform provides for the establishment of "people's tribunals" to 
"judge acts committed against the land policy and the mobilization 
of the masses." 
B. (II B 4) Indications of Viet Minh Intentions Derived from Statements of 
Party Policy and Measures Taken by the Ho Government: 
1. The Viet Minh seem determined to carry through at this time a far-
reaching political and economic reform program which will create, in 
the area under their control, conditions similar to those which 
existed in the early stages of the People's Democracies, and in 
particular to those which developed during the first days of the 
Chinese Communist regime. The results of this program are apparently 
expected to aid effectively in coping with the mounting economic dif-
ficulties that beset the regime, and in securing at the same time the 
adherence of the working peasant masses who are publicized as the 
program's prime beneficiaries. The Ho Government may be counting on 
increased material aid from the Communist Orbit to offset the cur-
tailment of plans for industrial development which would seem to be 
entailed by the current concentration on fuller exploitation of the 
country's agricultural potential.

2. The Ho Government intends to consolidate the hegemony of the Lao Dong 
Party and impose acceptance of Communist values in the areas under 
Viet Minh control, even at the risk of alienating still further 
various non-Marxist nationalist elements who have been disillusioned 
with the regime and are becoming an increasingly dubious source of 
support for the Viet Minh. The Ho Government may feel that the poli-
tical and economic elimination of these groups will strengthen the 
position of the regime by removing a potential fifth column, and will 
leave the way open for a more thorough implementation of the revolu-
tionary program. The most recent statements of policy by Government 
and Party leaders, and the measures taken in the economic and poli-
tical field, appear to commit the Viet Minh to a course of action 
which will tie the Ho Government even more closely to the Communist 
Orbit. 
a. A more vigorous assertion of Lao Dong Party leadership in the 
Viet Minh liberation struggle was first voiced by Party Secretary 
General Truong Chinh on the occasion of the September 1952 anni-
versary of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Reaffirming the 
Lao Dong Party's role as the "revolutionary party of the working 
class," Truong Chinh demanded that the Ho Government administra-
tion--ostensibly still functioning as a coalition of "popular" 
parties--and the Vietnamese "People's Liberation Army" be placed 
under the "full direction" of the Lao Dong Party, and he reaffirmed 
that the ultimate goal of the Viet Minh struggle was the establish-
ment of a socialist Vietnam. Subsequent propaganda has increas-
ingly stressed the role of the former Indochinese Communist Party 
in the anti-French liberation struggle and has reiterated the 
socialist goal of the Vietnamese Revolution.* 
b. The political nature of the "peasant mobilization" program is 
underscored by appeals to the "peasant masses" to "overthrow the 
reactionary forces" and "eliminate feudal elements"; the announced 
expulsion from the Lien Viet Front of "reactionary elements" and 
landlords who do not properly implement the new agrarian policy; 
the formal establishment of "class components in the countryside," 
consisting of "agricultural workers, poor peasants, middle 
peasants, rich peasants, and landowners"; the setting up of 
"people's tribunals" to judge "acts committed against the land 
policy and the mobilization of the masses"; and new emphasis on 
thegalliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals" as the 
basic force of the Vietnamese Revolution. 
* Reaffirmation of Communist Party leadership in Viet Minh propaganda may also 
reflect Stalin's exhortation at the 19th Soviet Party Congress that the "Commu-
nist and Workers' Parties" must assert their leading role in the colonial 
peoples' liberation struggle. Referencesto Stalin's teachings in connec-
tion with the agrarian character of the Vietnamese Revolution may be seen as 
an affirmation of the Communist orthodoxy of present Viet Minh policy despite 
its emphasis on the peasants and relative de-emphasis of the workers' role in 
the resistance.

c. Heightened affirmation of Communist leadership and techniques 
occurs with increased frequency in all other aspects of the 
propaganda. Apart from emphasis on the peasant masses' "high 
revolutionary spirit" which must be harnessed by the Lao Dong 
Party, there is new stress on the development of "democracy 
at the local level"--that is, in the province and villages; 
exhortations for internal Party reform; the elimination of 
"lukewarm" Party members and of "bureaucracy and authoritarian-
ism" witlimParty ranks. Party cadres are asked to conduct them-.. 
? selves in a.manner worthy of membership in the Lao Dong Party, 
"successor to the former Indochinese Communist Party." In his 
Party anniversary message in March, Vice Premier Pham Van Dong 
called for the elimination of'kulakefrom local administrative 
bodies, and Central Committee member Nguyen Thuong Vu voiced 
the need to "increase vigilance." 
d. Intensified identification of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam 
with the Soviet Union and Communist China, in the context of . 
both internal and external events, points up the increased em-
phasis on the 'fraternal unity" of the international Communist 
bloc. China is honored as the example to be followed by all 
colonial peoples in their "liberation struggle," but every occa-
sion is taken to reaffirm the primacy of the USSR as the "leader" 
of the world camp of "peace and democracy." The death of Stalin 
brought Viet Minh pledges of "unreserved" loyalty to his teach-
ings, and an avowal by Ho Chi Minh of "implicit confidence" in 
the Soviet Communist Party and its leadership. However, the 
occasion was also taken to affirm Ho Chi Mirth's position of 
leadership in his own right, in that his name was linked to Mao 
Tse-tung and Malenkov as a "disciple" of Stalin and as the 
leader who "correctly applies the principles of Marxism-Leninism" 
to the Vietnamese Revolution. Prompt praise of Malenkov and the 
new Soviet leadership, and absence of the usual deference to 
China in the Viet Minh comment on Stalin's death--at a time when 
other Satellite propaganda emphasized Sino-Soviet friendship and 
China's role--suggest a possible Ho Government bid for closer 
direct contact and liaison with Moscow. 
e. However, the direct influence of the Chinese Communists is evi-
dent in a number of pertinent Viet Minh propaganda statements 
and actions. In his September 1952 Liberation Anniversary re-
view, Truong C4inh specifically pointed out that the Viet Minh 
drive against "bureaucracy, waste, and corruption" had not at-
tained the scope of the "anti's" campaign in China. The Cabi-
net decision "fixing the class components of the countryside"; 
a "peasant mobilization" directive issued by the Viet Minh 
"National Assembly" which "in the present phase of the resist-
ance" divides the people into "workers, peasants, petty bour-
geois, and national bourgeois"; and, a Lien Viet Front exhorta-
tion to extend ideologic reform not only to the correction of 
wrong acts but also to the elimination of "erroneous thoughts"?
these and other features of Viet Minh propaganda and actions are

reminiscent of policies and actions undertaken by the Peking re-
gime. In addition, there are frequent pledges by Ho Government 
leaders that the Vietnamese people and the Lao Dong Party will 
"diligently learn the thoughts of Mao Tse-tung and...the precious 
experiences of the Chinese Communist Party." 
In his Lao Dong Party anniversary speech in March, Ho Chi Minh 
made a pointed reference to the "three great tasks" announced by 
the Peking regime--the intensified Resist-America Aid-Korea cam-
paign, the coming all-China elections, and the Five-Year basic 
construction program--and declared that these developments would 
have "special repercussions" in Vietnam. Viet Minh assertions 
that Overseas Chinese peasants in Vietnam will be among the Im-
portant beneficiaries of the land reform program point to the 
"peasant mobilization" as further evidence of Sino-Vietnamese 
unity and identity of views. 
3. The Viet Minh appear intent on broadening the scope of the Indochina 
conflict by giving increased support to Communist-oriented "libera-
tion" movement in Cambodia and Laos, and by extending full-scale 
military operations to these areas. Increased attention to the situa-
tion in Cambodia and Laos has marked Viet Minh comment since a Lien 
Viet Front resolution of July 1952 called for "the strengthening of 
the alliance of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and the granting of more  
effective aid to the resistance in these two friendly countries." 
Subsequent propaganda has exploited the "anniversaries" and activities 
of the Communist liberation movements with heightened intensity. The 
comment emphasizes the Laotian and Cambodian peoples' "determination" 
to free-themselves from French rule, and features the "unitrof the 
"Vietnam-Khmer-Laos Alliance" existing between the Ho Government, 
the "Cambodian Committee of National Liberation" headed by Son Ngoc 
Minh,* and the "Lao Issara Front of Pathet Lao (Free Laos)" led by 
Prince Souvannavong, The independent action of the Cambodian and 
Laotian peoples' fight for freedom has been consistently stressed, 
with the Viet Minh role depicted as essentially one of providing 
experienced guidance in the joint struggle against the common enemy. 
References to Khmer and Laos minority groups in Vietnam which "ac-
tively support" the Vietnamese people's resistance struggle is a 
further indication of the Viet Minh's recognition of the independent 
* Viet Minh propaganda has never mentioned the Issarak rebel movement headed 
by the Cambodian nationalist defector Son Ngoc Thanh. This avoidance is par-
ticularly noticeable when contrasted with the increased attention given to 
the "liberation" movement of Son Ngoc Minh, and with the repeated efforts 
made by Thanh's propaganda--broadcast over the clandestine transmitter, 
"Voice of Free Cambodia"--to demonstrate sympathy for the Viet Minh.

"nationality" status of these two peoples.* Viet Minh awareness of 
the deep-seated religious sentiments of Cambodians and Laotians is 
pointed up by repeated allegations that participation in the resist-
ance movement is synonymous with "love of Fatherland and worship of 
Buddha." 
a. The "duty" of the Lao Dong Party and the Vietnamese people to 
"aid" the Cambodian and Laotian revolutions, as affirmed by Ho 
Chi Minh at the time of the Vietnam-Khmer-Laos "united front" 
formation three years ago, is reiterated in the propaganda' 
that publicizes the current Viet Minh drive into Laos. How-
ever, recognition of the Laotian liberation movement's "inde-
pendent" status is implicit in the Viet Minh dispatches, which 
give credit for the victories to the "Laotian People's Libera-
tion Army" and limit accounts of the Viet Minh contribution to 
noting the "assistance" rendered by the "Vietnamese People's 
Volunteers."** Specific assurances are also given that the 
Viet Minh "volunteers" will "respect Pathet Lao's national 
sovereignty and the persons and property of the Lao people." 
b, Up to the time of the current Viet Minh drive into Laos, Cam-
? bodia actually received the greater share of attention in Ho 
propaganda on the two "allied" countries. The infrequent 
references to Laos discussed "liberation" activities in broad, 
general terms, with some emphasis given to the participation 
of "Free Laos" delegates at the Communist-sponsored "peace 
congresses" in Peking and Vienna. In November 1952, Viet Minh 
sources reported a message from an unnamed "Foreign Minister 
of Pathet Lao" to Soviet Foreign Minister Vishinsky, thanking 
the USSR for vetoing the U.N. membership application of the 
French-allied "so-called Associated State of Laos and its puppet 
government." Subsequent Viet Minh propaganda shows slightly in-
creased attention to Laos, with little change in thematic empha-
sis. The apparent absence of derogatory comment against the 
Laotian Royal House and the pro-French Cabinet contrasts sharply 
with the Viet Minh's vehement denunciation of the Cambodian King 
and his French-allied administration. 
* Apart from the Ho Government's acknowledgment of the special status of the 
Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, the attitude shown toward the Cambodians and 
Laotians is apparently at variance with the Viet Minh policy toward other 
minority groups in Vietnam. Such groups are usually not distinguished from 
the rest of the ,,Vietnamese people," whose "indissoluble unity" is affirmed 
on every occasion, Thus, Ho propaganda denounced the "Autonomous Thai Terri-
tory" established by the Bao Dai Government as a French-inspired device to 
"divide and rule." 
** The similarity between the designation "Vietnamese People's Volunteers" in 
Laos and the "Chinese People's Volunteers" in Korea is obvious, and represents 
a further indication of apparent Chinese influence. By identifying the Viet 
Minh forces as "volunteers," the Ho Government may also wish to counter pos-
sible charges of "foreign aggression" as well as reassure the Laotian popula-
tion of the essentially "national" character of their "liberators."

c. Viet Minh propaganda has shown great interest in the situation in 
Cambodia, and has reacted promptly to events there. In contrast 
to the apparent minimization of the Viet Minh role in Laos, the Bo 
Government seems to identify itself more directly as the guiding 
force of the Cambodian resistance. The successes of the Khmer 
"liberation" forces are credited to the "correct line of conduct 
traced by P17esident Ho." King Norodom Sihanouk's dismissal of the 
Huy Khantoul cabinet in?the summer of 1952 elicited immediate Viet 
Minh denunciation of the action as a betrayal of the popular will. 
The King, in terms approaching the vehemence of Viet Minh comment 
on Bao Dai, was described as a "fascist...a traitor to his people." 
His recent interview in New York (18 April) was the object of com-
ment by the Ho radio three days later which derided the King's 
sudden "change of heart" for full independence from France without 
further delay as a last-minute maneuver to save his throne with 
American aid. 
Theuvictories" of the Communist Cambodian guerrilas are also fea-
tured in Viet Minh propaganda at a sustained level of relatively 
high attention, and a recent report (21 April) refers to the Cam-
bodian resistance forces as the "Cambodian Army of Liberation." 
An 11 April dispatch notes the existence of a ',Vietnam People's 
Delegation" in Cambodia, presumably "accredited" to Son Ngoc 
Minh's "Cambodian Committee of National Liberation." 
d. Viet Minh propaganda since the end of last year has revealed an 
air of expectancy sharply at variance with previous reticence and 
unwillingness to assume commitments. This element was brought 
into focus with the publication late in December of an 8-point 
decree prescribing the procedures to be followed by Viet Minh 
troops in administering and controlling the populations of newly 
"liberated" areas. The decree, both in content and order of 
reference, is an almost verbatim repetition of the 8-point army 
directive issued by Chinese Communist Commander Lin Piao in 1948 
shortly before the fall of Peking and Tientsin. It gives elabo-
rate instructions on the maintenance of public order, troop rela-
tions with the "liberated" inhabitants, punishment of "spies and 
traitors," and the disposition of public and private property, 
including. the expropriation of properties belonging to "French 
colonialists and traitors." Subsequent propaganda directed to 
Viet Minh troops reiterates these points, with particular empha-
sis on "respecting the religious beliefs, customs, and habits of 
the people." ? 
Although exhortations of this nature may indicate an attempt to 
counteract unfavorable behavior and poor morale of Viet Minh 
troops, no such broad, all-inclusive directive as the 8-point 
decree had been issued before by the Viet Minh command. The 
order, therefore, may have represented Viet Minh anticipation 
of coming action on a scale and in territory not previously en-
visaged, and possibly beyond the scope of previous possibilities.

C. (II B 6) Propaganda Indications of Chinese Communist Intentions toward 
Vietnam: 
1. The intentions of the Chinese Communists toward Indochina remain ob-
scure in the propaganda. Affirmations of support for the Viet Minh 
are couched only in the most general terms in the propaganda emanating 
from Peking Government sources, while Viet Minh references to China 
remain on a comparable level with those made to the Soviet Union. 
Certain belligerent and defensive elements, similar to those which 
constituted the bulk of the Chinese Communist propaganda build-up 
immediately before the Chinese intervention in Korea, have appeared 
with increased frequency in both Soviet and Chinese Communist propa-
ganda, and have to some extent been echoed by the Viet Minh, These 
elements, however, have thus far occurred without a definite pattern 
and have not been built up as a major component of the propaganda. 
At their present level, they do not constitute a well-defined propa-
ganda trend, although such a trend could be built up to justify 
eventual overt action by the Communist bloc with respect to Vietnam. 
a, Chinese Communist propaganda broadcasts to and about Indochina* 
note the achievements and victories of the Viet Minh but do not 
identify China as an active participant, Certain "anniversaries" 
and other occasions are taken to publicize statements of sympathy 
and supportfrom Chinese Communist leaders. Generally, however, 
Peking treats the Indochina conflict as one expression of the 
Asian people's desire for national independence and their resist-
ance to Western colonialism and aggression. Peking propaganda, 
like Ho comment, apparently seeks to minimize the historic antago-
nism felt by the Vietnamese people for the Chinese, by avoiding 
specific references to the status of Overseas Chinese in Indochina 
and by emphasizing the "unity" of the Chinese and Vietnamese 
peoples.** The bulk of Chinese comment on the situation in Indo-
china relates to the struggle in Vietnam. References to Laos and 
Cambodia have largely been limited to accounts of activities of 
these countries' resistance delegates at various international 
Communist gatherings, 
* Peking's seven hour per week Tonkinese-language broadcasts constitute approxi-
mately nine percent of the Chinese Communist Radio's foreign service, a rdatively 
high percentage. News and discussions of the situation in Indochina make up 
three percent of all Peking broadcast content, the highest percentage of atten-
tion devoted to any country in Southeast Asia, However, original comment is in-
frequent; the bulk of Peking radio material on Indochina consists of battle re-
ports and official Viet Minh statements, transmitted by the Ho Government's 
VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY. 
** Avoidance of the Overseas Chinese issue in Indochina contrasts sharply with 
Peking's self-assumed role of defender of Overseas Chinese interests in other 
Southeast Asian countries. Thailand and the British Administration in Malaya 
have been special targets of abuse in connection with alleged mistreatment and 
persecution of Overseas Chinese.

b. Soviet radio propaganda* also features the achievements of the 
Viet Minh, with expressions of Soviet sympathy voiced only in 
the most general terms, and usually even more restrained than 
those emanating from China. EXcept for periodic reviews of the 
military situation, the Indochina conflict has been discussed 
by Moscow largely in terms of the world-wide East-West conflict 
and the Asian peoples' "liberation struggle" against colonial 
domination. Like Peking, Moscow devotes the bulk of its material 
to the situation in Vietnam, and has mentioned Laos and Cambodia 
mainly in connection with world-wide Communist events. 
c. The degree of Chinese influence on the Ho Government's policy and 
propaganda effort is uncertain. However, a known transmission 
belt of information and propaganda exists in the form of messages 
and news exchanged between the Ho radio and an unidentified radio 
outlet in Communist China which uses the call letters GMH. A 
study of the traffic over this circuit reveals that the Chinese 
side acts as the initiator of certain policy and propaganda 
directives subsequently carried out by the Viet Minh. The Chinese 
side also requests specific information and propaganda support 
from the Viet Minh source, in the form of messages to international 
Communist gatherings, comment on world affairs, and details of 
certain developments in Indochina. A recent GVIE request for 
"more material" in memory of Stalin was promptly followed by 
voluminous accounts of Stalin memorial meetings and special com-
mentaries from the VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY. - 
A possible indication of what may be direct Chinese policy guid-
ance or influence on the Ho Government may be seen in the fact 
that the December 1952 Resistance _Anniversary and Christmas mes-
sages of Ho Chi Minh were virtually verbatim repetitions--both 
as to content and phraseology--of the "suggestions" forwarded via 
GMH to Ho from Hoang Van Hoan, the Viet Minh ambassador in Peking. 
Apart from the question of the degree of Chinese control, this ex-
change of messages reveals that at least one of the formulators 
of Ho Government policy--the message contained the opening call 
for agrarian reform and peasant mobilization--is in Peking, where 
there is every opportunity for direct consultation with the ranking 
members of the Communist regime. 
* MOSCOW broadcasts wven hours per week in Tonkinese, these broadcasts consti-
tuting slightly more than one percent of the Soviet radio's foreign service. 
The situation in Indochina is discussed in less than one-half of one percent 
of Moscow radio comment--a low volume, comparable to similar absence of focus 
on other areas which are not in the forefront of the East-West struggle. 
Roughly one-third of the propaganda is directed to Vietnamese listeners. Of 
the remainder, the bulk goes to other Asian audiences. Indochinese listeners 
generally hear about the weakness and disunity of the West, the Soviet home 
audience is treated to accounts of Viet Minh successes, while Western listeners 
are told about U.S. aggressive and imperialist designs in Vietnam.

d. During the past six months, and particularly since the beginning 
of this year, there has been a noticeable increase of attention 
in both Soviet and Chinese Communist propaganda to the situation 
in Indochina, including prominent mention of the activities of 
Cambodian and Laotian delegates to the Peking and Vienna "peace 
congresses." The Soviet interest in Indochina is highlighted by 
Malenkov's reference to "the courageous fight for freedom and 
national independence waged by the people of Vietnam" in his 
Stalin funeral oration of 9 March. The reference followed a 
similar one-sentence mention of., the Korean war, Subsequent 
Soviet propaganda has, in particular, emphasized the "growing 
strength" and "certain victory" of the "liberation" movement, 
and has shown an unusual interest in Vietnamese internal devel-
opments--a departure from previous practice. Recent Soviet re-
ports, for example, have featured the Ho Government's agrarian 
reform and peasant mobilization program. 
e. Soviet and Chinese propaganda has lately contained certain bel-
ligerent and defensive elements which reveal heightened concern 
with the possible effects of a stepped-up Western effort in 
Indochina. These elements have to a certain extent been re-
flected also in Viet Minh propaganda. Prompt and vehement reac-
tion has been registered to the latest U.S.-French talks, with 
emphasis on the charge that plans to augment the size of Bao Dai 
Government troops are merely part of an over-all U.S,-directed 
effort to "extend the war in Asia and pit Asians against Asians," 
During the past two weeks, Chinese propaganda has prominently . 
mentioned Laos with the charge that the French-allied "bogus" 
Laotian Government, by expanding its army, was implementing the 
U.S. policy of inducing Asians to fight Asians. Chinese sources 
have also featured the accusation that Thai Government forces 
were actively helping the French Union troops in Laos.* This 
accusation has not yet been repeated by the Ho Government, but 
previous Viet Minh propaganda has asserted that the United States 
intended to have Thailand "reoccupy" the Cambodian provinces of 
Battambang and Siemreap. 
f. Although the primacy of Soviet leadership is reiterated on every 
occasion, Viet Minh propaganda has continued its intensive affir-
mation of Sino-Vietnamese friendship and its efforts to overcome 
the traditional Vietnamese suspicion and antagonism toward the 
Chinese. Recent statements have pointed up the "teacher-pupil" 
relationship and have again referred to the "ties of blood" exist-
ing between the two peoples. Similar references to "blood_rela-
tionship" marked Chinese propaganda prior to Chinese_intervention 
in Korea. . 
* This latest charge is apparently also part of an intensified revival of 
Peking's virulent denunciations of the Songgram Government. The Chinese Com-
munists have also claimed that Thailand plans to conscript its Overseas 
Chinese for military purposes under Eisenhower's program to have Asians 
fight Asians.

SECURITY INFIRMATION 
. -15-
g. 
The recent establishment of mail service between China and the 
Democratic Republic of Vietnam will apparently facilitate Sino-
Vietnamese contact and strengthen the relationship. The official 
directives state that "in order to guarantee smooth mail service, 
names and addresses of letters destined for the Democratic Re-
public of Vietnam should be written in both Chinese and Vietnamese." 
Effective mail service is likely to increase Chinese Communist in- , 
fluence among the Overseas Chinese in both the Vietilinh and French-
controlled areas of Indochina. 
h. The purposes and effect of the much-publicized formation by Peking 
of the "Autonomous Thai Region" in Southern Yunnan are not clear 
insofar as they may have a bearing on future developments in Indo-
china with its considerable Thai minority population. Chinese 
Communist policy on recognition of the Thai ethnic group appears 
to be in contradiction to the Bo Government's vigorous disavowal 
of the "Autonomous Thai Territory" established by the French and 
the Bap Dai Government. 
i. At their present level, the various belligerent and defensive 
elements in the propaganda which could be built up to justify 
eventual overt action by the Communist bloc--and specifically by 
Communist China--in Vietnam do not constitute a well-defined 
propaganda trend. The current propaganda focus on Vietnam (and 
broadly speaking, on all of Southeast Asia) could be explained 
by a number of alternatives, including principally (1) the Com-
munist intention to keep the issue of the Asian "liberation 
struggle" alive and distinct from any settlement.in Korea, and 
(2) increased Communist concern with the possibility of a more 
effective, dynamic Western policy in Asia stemming from U.S. 
leadership under the Eisenhower administration and the increas-
ingly closer collaboration of the major Western powers in Asia.
