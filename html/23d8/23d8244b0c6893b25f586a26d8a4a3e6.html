 Interview With a Chinese Who Grew Up Under Communism
 Behind the turmoil in Red China-
 Are the Communists riding for a fall? Is their
 tight control slipping? What do China's millions
 really think of their rulers?                        %
 A vivid picture of today's China emerges from
 this interview with a Communist defector, Miao
 Chen-pai. He has only boyhood memories of
 China before the Reds. But his knowledge of his
 homeland since is sharp and perceptive.
 Miao Chen-pai, now in the United States, was
 interviewed by two members of the staff of
 "U. S. News & World Report" who have lived in
 China. Both were struck by his intelligent, ob-
 jective answers to their questions.
 Q Mr. Miao, where were you and what were you doing
 when the Communists 'came to power in China in 1949?
 A I was living with my parents about three hours' train
 ride from Shanghai. I was 13 then. My parents were both
 schoolteachers: I was in school.
 Q As a 13-year-old boy, what did you think of the
 Communists and Mao Tse-tung?
 A Mao Tse-tung was a hero to me. I believed in him,
 and in the Communists. I believed their ideas were right
 and good for China, so later I joined the Communist Party.
 Q 1fow long did you continue to believe?
 A For many years. That's why I went on to join the
 Communist Party. I could see some things that were good
 for my country. Conditions improved for the lowest of the
 peasants-the ones who never owned any land. The country
 was unified, too-brought under one Government.
 Q What advantages do you get by being a member of
 the Communist Party?
 A We don't get any immediate material advantages
 from being a member of the party. A party member, for
 example, gets the same pay as a nonparty member doing
 the same job. But all Chinese know that, in the long run,
 the party member does benefit.
 Nobody talks about this, but we can see it. Party mem-
 bers are promoted faster, move up to higher jobs. Of course,
 as you move up the ladder, you get better living quarters
 MIAO CHEN-PAI, 29, joined China's`Young Com-
 munist League in 1949 and the Communist Party
 itself in 1956. He was in China's armed forces from
 1950 until 1957. Then he went to work for the Min-
 istry of Foreign Trade. Last year, Mr. Miao was as-
 signed by the Communists to the commercial mis-
 sion of the Chinese Embassy in Damascus, Syria. It
 was there that he walked into the U. S. Embassy
 last July 26, asked for political asylum and got it.

 and better food. So, if you want to get ahead faster, you
 try to get into the party.
 Q Why don't people talk about this?
 A You don't like to talk about anything like that in
 China. For example, students in the universities are not
 only graded for their work, but also are graded for their
 loyalty. The party does the grading on loyalty. So., if the
 party committee at your university hears that you have said
 something that sounds disloyal, that is put in your record
 when you graduate. This is bad for you, because it means
 you are sent to an unsatisfactory job or to some faraway
 place. All students know this, so they try to show how
 loyal they are.
 Q When did you, Mr. Miao, begin to have doubts about
 Mao Tse-tung and the Communists-and why?             %
 A Almost all Chinese trusted Mao Tse-tung, thought of
 him as being almost infallible, until 1957. They believed
 him when he said he wanted a hundred flowers to bloom
 and a hundred thoughts to contend. Because they trusted
 him, many expressed their ideas and criticisms.
 Then we found out that the "hundred flowers" was a trap.
 Mao Tse-tung used this trap to get people to tell their
 thoughts. In this way, Mao Tse-tung found out who opposed
 him-and got rid of these people.
 Still, many people continued to believe in Mao Tse-tung.
 They said the trap had been a smart move by him-to get
 rid of people who were bourgeois and antiparty.
 Personally, my doubts began in 1959, when it became
 obvious to me and others that the "Great Leap Forward"-
 a creation of Mao-was a failure. Then, afterward, Mao
 never criticized himself for this error-although he had al-
 ways said that members of the party should criticize them-
 selves.
 Then, when Marshal Peng Teh-huai [former Defense Min-
 ister] was purged for criticizing Mao's "Great Leap For-
 ward," I realized that Mao would not criticize himself, nor
 would he accept the criticism of others. Instead, he blamed
 others for the failure.
 This strengthened my doubts. Not only did Mao Tse-tung
 refuse to accept criticism, but he also was trying to make
 himself appear infallible, a man who could make no error.
 Q Did others feel this way? Did people talk about it?
 A I am certain many people felt this way. But nobody
 talked about it. We were afraid. Ever since the trap of the
 hundred flowers, we Chinese keep our discontent in our
 hearts. We are afraid to speak of these things to each other.
 Q Then how can you be certain others felt this way?
 A It came out later, in the last few years. It came out
 in literary work. It came out in criticisms by economic peo-
 ple and the educated classes. It came out even inside the
 party-which is why you now see the purges and the "great
 proletarian cultural revolution."
 Q How did you learn about these events inside the party
 in China while you were in Syria?
 A Beginning last May, while I still was in the Embassy
 in Damascus, our Ambassador received orders from Peking
 to implement the cultural revolution. Peking began sending
 him a number of documents on the situation in China. These
 were studied and discussed in long sessions held every day
 in the Embassy.
 Some of the documents and reports were shown only to
 the relatively few Communist Party members in the Em-
 bassy. As a party member, I was shown these documents.
 From them, I learned what happened to Peng Chen.
 Peng Chen was one of the six most-powerful men in the
 Politburo of the Communist Party-the mayor of Peking, the
 capital, and also head of the party organization there. The
 documents showed that he was removed primarily because
 he was anti-Mao.
 In September of 1965, Peng Chen made statements at a
 national meeting of provincial propaganda workers. The state-
 ments were considered anti-Mao. What Peng Chen said was
 that everyone should be given freedom to speak-and that,
 even if it is Chairman Mao who is wrong, he, too, must be
 criticized,
 Mao Tse-tung no doubt has made many errors, but as
 long as he retains power, no one will be allowed to criticize
 him. Peng was purged a few months later.
 0 Peng and others must have known the risks they were
 taking when they dared to criticize Mao. Why did they do
 it?
 A Peng and other high leaders in the party and the mili-
 tary have their own followers. I don't know, but it may have
 been that they felt strong enough, politically, to voice their
 opinions.
 But this I do know: The reason for the existence of
 widespread opposition to Chairman Mao's policies is the
 many setbacks the country has suffered. Both domestically
 and in the field of foreign relations, the policies of Mao have
 not succeeded. But these policies have no chance of being
 changed so long as Mao Tse-tung is alive, and so long as
 anyone who questions the policies is purged.
 0 Do you believe, Mr. Miao, that the purges and mobs
 of young Red Guards will make everyone obedient to Mao
 Tse-tung now?
 A No, I don't. As long as Mao's policies are followed,
 whether by Mao himself or by his successors, there will be
 opposition. There are other groups besides the Mao Tse-tung
 group. As I said, Peng Chen had many followers, and many
 of these have not been purged. There are groups in the mili-
 tary, too. As long as there are groups who believe that Mao
 Tse-tung's policies are wrong for China, the struggle will
 continue.
 Q What in your mind are the main policies of Mao that
 are causing the problems?
 A There are two main policies.: At home, there is the pol-
 icy of continued class struggle; abroad, there is the policy of
 world revolution.
 Q Are these policies popular?
 A I don't think so. The class struggle at home means con-
 tinuing war against the bourgeoisie and the people with
 bourgeois thoughts. Chinese suspected of having bourgeois
 thoughts are those who are not opposed to the bourgeoisie.
 As for world revolution, I don't think the Chinese are en-
 thusiastic or very much interested. They are more interested
 in getting a better life for themselves. They do not like to
 make sacrifices to help "liberate" people far away. People
 ask why we have to send help to foreign "liberation move-
 ments" when we don't. have enough money for our own de-
 velopment.

 Y  e   ha?arg   con r?  I!    a?ea. People are unhappy..
 Q What do the Chinese think they should have to make
 their lives better?
 A Personal freedom is the main thing. Thought control is
 hated. People are unhappy with the way Communism is
 breaking up traditional family life. They want time in the
 evening to spend with their families-instead of attending
 study groups and self-criticism meetings and listening to
 propaganda lectures. People want time for themselves.
 Q What do they think of things like the law against mar-
 riage before a fairly advanced age?
 A The law isn't too bad. It says men can marry at age
 20 and women at age 18. But the party says men shouldn't
 marry until they are 27, and women until they are 25. And
 you must understand that, in China, what the party says is
 more important than the law. So, generally, in the cities, men
 don't marry until they are 27. In the countryside, however,
 more people get married earlier-following the law rather
 than the party.
 Q Chinese propaganda also discourages sexual relations
 before marriage. Is this accepted?
 A Many people do accept this. They work hard, practice
 self-restraint: But many people do not obey-particularly in
 the universities. You never hear about it in China, but there
 .re a great many babies born out of wedlock.
 0 How effective is the party propaganda in China?
 A Very effective. Remember, we hear nothing from the
 outside world that the party doesn't want us to hear. As a
 result, Mao Tse-tung has been able to make the Chinese be-
 lieve one thing at one time, and just the opposite at another
 time.
 In 1956, for example, Mao Tse-tung told us that Russia
 was the great leader and teacher of the' revolution. Then a
 few years later, after Khrushchev had gone to Camp David
 to see Eisenhower, he made us believe that Khrushchev no
 longer was a Marxist-Leninist, and Russia no longer was the
 leader of the revolution.
 AS MAO'S TROUBLES GROW--
 Q Well,. if Mao's propaganda is that effective, why does
 he now need the cultural revolution and the Red Guards and
 the purges of party leaders?
 A Mao Tse-tung needs all this because of the opposition
 that has developed to his policies-and because of his failures.
 1e started the cultural revolution because of this opposition.
 Then he found that many members of the Young Communist
 League were not supporting the cultural revolution, or were
 not enthusiastic.
 So then he had to turn to the Red Guards. These are the
 younger people, who are most easily swayed and controlled
 by the propaganda.
 Q Who are the Red Guards? How did they get started?
 A The Red Guards started in the universities in Peking.
 That was well after the cultural revolution had been started.
 At first, the Red Guards were not publicly formed in the
 name of the party. The party element behind Mao and Mar-
 shal Lin Piao wanted it to appear that the Red Guards had
 been formed by student leaders in the universities. But, in
 fact, the Red Guards were backed, instructed and developed
 by this element of the party.
 Q Do you think the Red Guards can be controlled-or
 that they might turn out to be some kind of "Frankenstein
 monster" and turn on their creators?
 A I don't think it is possible that they will get out of
 control, like a "Frankenstein monster." That is because Mao
 and Lin have created them, would make sure to have means
 of control over them. Chinese Communist Party leaders have
 had great experience in creating and stopping such move-
 ments, you know.
 Q Is the present situation connectedb.in any way with the
 results of the break with Soviet Russia?
 A I don't think it is, in the minds of the people.
 When it became realized that there was a break, people
 were happy, in a way. Now, they thought, China can show
 the world that it can progress on its own, without help. We
 Chinese had confidence that we could progress on our own,
 although we realized it would take longer. But we felt that
 the accomplishment would be more satisfying, because it
 would be ours.
 Besides, there was dissatisfaction with the type of help
 Russia was giving us. Engineers told me that the automobile
 plant the Russians helped us build in Changchun was not
 good. 1 didn't see the Russian plants myself, but many peo-
 ple who did told me the same kind of story.
 "CHINA CAN PUSH AHEAD"--
 Q Can China, in fact, progress on its own?
 A I think China basically can push ahead economically.
 Of course, China is still economically weak. Because of this,
 she hopes to supplement her own technological and scien-
 tific capabilities with the technological and scientific capa-
 bilities of the Western countries.
 She is seeking to do this now by developing her foreign
 trade with these countries. Though she has shown she can
 do things on her own-the atom bomb, for example-China
 has a long way to go, still, in many, many fields. Such
 things as bombs, of course, are not everything. China in
 recent years has refused development aid from Russia, and
 there have been no new developments or changes on this.
 I don't believe China needs aid from Russia or anybody
 else. As a matter of national pride, and because China is a
 vast country and full of resources, I believe China can do it
 on her own-though it will take time. And, of course, she
 needs to develop her foreign trade in order to strengthen her-
 self economically and technologically.
 Q What will be the effects of the development of a
 nuclear-carrying missile which Communist China has just
 announced?
 A I don't believe it will have any actual military worth,
 but it can elevate China's. influence and be of use to her in
 a propaganda way for prestige.
 I think the reaction of the Chinese people will be pride,
 just as they were proud that China had an atom bomb.
 Q Is there any sentiment of importance in favor of
 Chiang Kai-slick's coming back from Taiwan?
 A Older people might like to see Chiang come 'back.
 Others might want the personal liberties that they now be-
 lieve existed under the Nationalist Government. But the
 young people know hardly anything about Chiang and the
 Nationalists-except what the Communists tell them.
 Q Is there any man or group who appears to the Chinese
 to give hope of restoring the personal liberties they want?
 A I know of no specific person or group, but the people
 do long for personal freedom. So, eventually, maybe the peo-
 ple will be able to find such a man or group for themselves.

 Many, particularly the older people. long for the old ways
 and customs. I'll give you an example:
 A few years ago, Mao Tse-tung ordered the whole Peking
 Opera changed. This was the great opera of China. The songs
 were familiar, and many people loved them. Mao Tse-tung
 changed the opera so that it would do songs that help the
 revolution. One day, in a barber shop in Peking, I heard an
 older man ask the barber to please turn off the radio while it
 was playing one of the new songs of the opera. The barber
 did.
 Q How would you describe the kind of personal liberties
 that the Chinese want?
 A There are many different kinds, depending on who
 the individual Chinese is and where he is. A peasant wants
 to own his own land. A worker wants to be free to enjoy
 his time off work. A writer wants to be free to put down
 his own thoughts-to criticize if he feels strongly about
 something.
 What it amounts to, I guess, is the kind of revisionism
 they have in Russia and Eastern Europe, although this I did
 not realize until after I left China.
 The material shortages bother the Chinese people. But many
 people live just about as they did before. Some-the lower
 peasants-may live a little better than before.
 But it is the spiritual oppression that is hated most-the
 thought control, the control of your time.
 Q How tight is political control from the party headquar-
 ters in Peking?
 A It is extremely tight. Whenever provincial party lead-
 ers get out of line, people are sent out from Peking to
 straighten them out. This happened in Anhwei and in other
 provinces.
 Now the Red Guards are being used against some of the
 provincial party headquarters.
 Q What do the Chinese people generally feel about the
 American people now? Are we the hated enemy, or would
 they like to make friends again?
 A I am sorry to say that the U. S. is the hated enemy
 in the popular mind as a result of the propaganda. I do not
 feel that they particularly fear the U. S.-and this, also, is the
 result of propaganda.
 It is hard for foreigners to understand this if they have
 never lived under such a system. Ever since 1950, the prop-
 aganda against the United States has been never-ceasing.
 After being subjected to such cleverly devised propaganda
 day after day for 15 years, the human mind can't help but
 be affected by it.
 CHANCES OF WAR WITH U. S.-
 Q What about the war? What would make the Chinese.
 enter the fighting in Vietnam?
 A We Chinese do not feel that the party wants war with
 the United States. I personally never felt we were going to
 war in 1958 over the offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu.
 I cannot say now what would force the party to decide
 ight in Vietnam. Once the party said China would go to
 to f
 war if Hanoi was bombed. But Hanoi was bombed, and
 China did not go to war.
 Maybe China would go to war if American ground troops
 invaded North Vietnam and moved too close to the Chinese
 border. But I am not even sure of that. It isn't like Korea.

 First, Chinese Communist foreign policies are in conflict
 with Soviet foreign policies. Therefore, the Chinese Commu-
 nists, by pushing their foreign-policy ideas in Vietnam, hope
 to win an ideological victory over the Soviets.
 Second, the Chinese Communists hope to expand Commu-
 nism throughout Southeast Asia through successes in Viet-
 nam. The Vietnam war, therefore, is the basic key to Mao's
 whole theory of world revolution and wars of "national lib-
 eration." He wants victory in Vietnam because that would
 be taken as evidence that he is right and Russia is wrong.
 But, if the United States can bring about negotiations for
 peace, he loses.
 South Vietnam is not Mao's whole goal. It is the key to
 Communist expansion generally. So Mao will try every pos-
 sibility to prevent peace.
 WHY COLLAPSE IS UNLIKELY--
 Q Where does China go from here? Is it headed for in-
 ternal collapse, for example?
 A So far, I haven't seen anything to indicate that an
 internal collapse is coming to China. But, inside China,
 there are a lot of contradictions, and these contradictions
 are sharpening. The main one is the desire of the people for
 more freedom.
 After a period of time-how long, I really couldn't guess
 -this might bring about a trend toward something like re-
 visionism and changes in China. But, so far, I really see no
 basis for believing internal collapse is coining.
 Q. Is there a chance that China will break up into semi-
 autonomous regional governments or regimes?
 A I see no possibility of this, because the power of the
 Central Government-Mao and his group-is simply too
 strong, too ironclad.
 China won't go back into the old system of war lords.
 And I don't think there will be semiautonomous regional
 governments set up. We had them, you know, even under
 Communism. It wasn't until 1954 that Mao Tse-tung was
 able to break he hold that some party groups had over
 various regions.
 But what you' arc more likely to see develop is political
 divisions among various groups. We already have had that
 -which is why we now have the purges and the cultural
 revolution.
 Q In your personal opinion, what is thm best course China
 could take?
 A This is a very difficult question.
 My personal view of revisionism is that it is the period of
 transformation from a socialist system to a capitalist system.
 You see, Marx himself told how to carry on revolution
 against capitalism, but he never explained a specific way
 to build socialism.
 All over the world there are people who say they are
 Marxists, and many are trying to build socialism. But Rus-
 sia itself, after almost 50 years, has reverted to revisionism,
 and this, to my mind, is evidence of the failure of socialism.
 So, up to now, I don't know how to build socialism in

 Is Poised for New Clashes
 Hobbled by Limited Resources

 Staff Reporter of THsi WALL STREET JOURNAL
 While Red China writhes under the whip
 and words of Mao and the Johnson Adminis-
 tration shudders over the grandiose global de-
 signs of Mao's heir-apparent, Lin Piao, U.S.
 officials are getting some fresh, and in some
 ways  conflicting,  impressions  of  mainland
 China, and its real menace, from a man
 named Miao.
 The full name is Miao Clren?pai. And while
 he Is a nobody in the Peking hierarchy, he
 Is currently a very hot article indeed within
 what is loosely called the U.S.  "intelligence
 community."  Reason:  As  recently  as  six
 months  ago, Mr.  Miao  was,    by  his ac-
 count, a, Loyal Communist Chinese bureaucrat,
 dutifully employed as a, "foreign aid" official
 In Damascus with the assignment of promot-
 ing world revolution, In keeping with the doc-
 trine of Lin Pia.o.
 About then, however, Mr. Miao began to
 sour on Mr. Mao. As he tells it, on July
 26, he waited until all his colleagues in the
 Red Chinese chancellery had stepped across
 to the embassy for lunch, then reached over
 his bed for a suitcase -surreptitiously packed
 in advance, walked out the door and, five
 breathless minutes later,  walked into  the
 American embassy.
 He  thus  became,  by      U.S. intelligence
 standards, probably the most important Com-
 munist Chinese defector yet to fa.11 into Amer-
 ican hands. Though refugees cross regularly
 into  British-controlled Hong Kong,  few  are
 government officials. A mixed assortment of
 Red Chinese have defected to the U.S. in re-
 cent years, including a cook, an acrobat and
 a, piano player. But the last government of-
 ficial to seek U.S. asylum was a low-ranking
 language expert and non-party member, who
 defected In Burundi more than two years ago.
 Intensive U.S. quizzing
 By contrast, Miao Chen-pal was a party
 member of 10 years standing. This, and the
 fact that he is fluent in Arabic, placed him
 frequently at the right hand of his ambassador
 In Syria and kept him In close touch with the
 party line as well as with government policy
 during the year he -..pent in the Damascus
 embassy.  Finally,  his  American  custodians
 consider him not only the highest-ranking but
 much the most Intelligent Chinese government
 defector yet to become, available for pro-

 thorities. Indeed, Mr. Aliao, comfortably en-

 of official U.S. escorts, by a desire not to of-

 questioning he had already been subjected to

 Though his English is surprisingly good, and

 across what lately has seemed to be a funda-
 mental tenet of U.S. policy--that Vietnam, as
 President Johnson put it . the other clay, is
 "the opening salvo in a series of bombard-
 ments, or as they are called in Peking, 'wars
 of liberation.' " Quoting with evident approval
 from the London Economist, the President
 went on: "Until and unless there is solid
 evidence that China. does not intend to do
 what Lin Piao says it wants to do or can-
 not do it (i.e., promote guerrilla  wars  in
 "the countrysido of the. world"-Asia, Africa
 and Latin America-by way of encircling and
 conquering the "cities of the world," mean-
 ing the U.S. and Europe) the only safe as-
 sumption . . . is that the Chinese mean every
 word they say."
 Without questioning that the Red Chinese
 ultimately may want to carry out this pro-
 gram, Mr. Miao, on his own experience, is
 doubtful that they can, at least any time soon.
 He is not  even  convinced  that  Lin Piao's
 celebrated declaration of a year ago does
 mean what It seems to mean or was meant
 for consumption outside the Communist world
 at all. "It is a theory for the long range,"
 he declares. "But it is not practical for now."
 A Substitute for Arms?
 As Mr. tti.Tiao read it, Lin Piao was talking
 partly to the Russians-as part of the continu-
 ing Sino-Soviet debate over the relative merits
 of Soviet-style  "peaceful co-existence"  and
 Peking's professed intent to promote revolu-
 tionary war. Lin Piao's second purpose, ac-
 cording to Mr. Miao, was to give the Com-
 munist forces in Vietnam what he calls a
 "theoretical weapon," presumably meaning a'
 morale-building sense of mission. By this rea-
 soning,  Lin Piao's  doctrine  becomes  not a
 global call to arms but a substitute for more
 Chinese arms in the Vietnamese struggle, Red
 Chinese help toward Vietnam's war of libera-
 tion right next door, by Mr. Miao's measure-
 ment, has been negligible.
 "The war in Vietnam doesn't cost China
 anything," he declares.
 As. Mr. Miao interprets his former govern-
 ment's policy, Peking would naturally be de-
 lighted if Communist forces prevailed In South
 Vietnam, for the sake of a victory in Red
 China's Ideological dispute with Moscow, for
 the prestige loss the U.S. would suffer and for
 the impact this would have "on the leadership
 struggle" among Communist factions around.
 the world. Failing victory, the last Mr. Miao
 heard directly of the Peking line, it was rigid-
 ly against a negotiated settlement. Instead, he
 says, the government in Peking wants "the
 war to drag on, to weaken the United States
 and cause increasing difficulties for the Ameri-
 cans within and outside their country.''
 "As of July, my government wanted to
 continue the war in Vietnam, but not to join
 it," says Mr. Miao.
 There are ample reasons the Chinese might
 not wish to plunge more deeply into the
 struggle on behalf of -the Vietcong and the
 North Vietnamese, not the least being fear
 of  entanglement  with  the  U.S.  and  ex-`
 posure of China's limited war potential.
 J,/ C- /; 2-
 But beyond the military arena, Mr. Miao,
 who had served a stint as a Middle East
 specialist at home before being shipped out to
 Syria,  pictures  a highly flexible,  pragmatic
 Chinese approach overall. Far from fostering
 guerrilla movements in pursuit of "pure,"
 Maoist revolution, Peking's practice has been;
 to use  Its  economic aid to curry political)
 favor with non-Communist governments, even
 when such tactics might actually strengthen a
 government against possible Communist In-
 surgency.
 Contributing to this flexible approach and
 influencing Red China's potential for global
 trouble-making,  Mr.  Miao strongly suggests,
 is China's limited capability for advancing its
 economic aims. (Last year,. U.S. figures show,.
 Communist China gave  only  $59  million  in
 credits and grants to less developed non-Com-
 munist countries, compared with over $1.1 bil-
 lion extended by Russia and its satellites.)
 Syria, where, Mr. Miao was intimately-involved
 in Peking's economic offensive for world in-
 fluence, is a striking case in point.
 Peking's aim in Damascus, as Mr. Miao
 understood it, was not to subvert Syria but
 to win Influence for China and support for
 Chinese causes, to fan Syrian antagonism to.
 ward the West and, in all this, to outdo the
 Soviets. Not the least of the ironies in this
 approach, however, was that even if it worked
 part way and the Red Chinese managed to
 fan anti-Western feelings, the principal bene-
 ficiaries were' probably the Soviets. For the
 Soviets could do for Syria what the Chinese
 could not-furnish the sort of splashy, "im-
 pact" aid, such as a sizable Soviet payment
 toward the cost of a dam on the Euphrates
 or railroad-building help, which Peking was
 simply incapable of furnishing.
 "Ali we could do was offer light industry,"
 Mr. Miao declares. "And after I saw the light
 industry which the French had given Syria, It
 became clear that Syrian technology was bet-
 ter, or at least the equal of China's."
 The result was that a Communist Chinese
 credit granted to Syria in 1963, in the amount
 of 70 million Swiss francs (about $16 million
 at today's exchange rate), was still untouched
 by May' 1965.  In 1964 experts from both
 countries exchanged visits; the Chinese showed
 plans for sugar refineries, textile mills, gen-
 erator plants and other light industry. The
 Syrians were asked to make their selection.
 "But there was no answer from the Syr-
 ians," aidman Miao recalls. Why? "Probably
 because our choice was- very limited, what
 the Syrians wanted we could not supply. Be-
 sides, they. had more confidence in Europe.
 At least, that's the conclusion we reached In
 the embassy."
 Ultimately, a portion of the credit was used
 for the purchase of Chinese rice, and the
 Syrians urged that a further portion be ap-
 plied to other regular Syrian imports from
 China. But the Chinese felt obliged to turn this
 down,  on the ground that it would have
 adversely affected Red China's already ad-
 verse balance of payments with Syria, growing'
 out  of heavy  Chinese  purchases  of  Syrian
 cotton.                                     II

 Industry finally put in orders for a small tex-
 ttle plant, a paper mill and some phosphate-
 mining equipment, to be charged against what
 remained of that three-year old credit,, Mr.
 Miao reports. The last word he had was that
 Peking had okayed the textile plant but had
 told Syria it was unable to supply either the
 phosphate-mining gear or the paper factory.
 The Red Chinese, in short, hava not been
 buying much political favor in Syria, and part
 of the reason may be found in Mr. Miao's
 analysis of the fundamental Peking approach.
 For one thing, the Rod Chinese refuse to bid
 competitively against the West;  aid terms
 must be reached by negotiation. This naturally
 makes it Impossible for the recipient to shop
 around for a better deal. Also, the Chinese
 refuse to engage In any joint ventures with
 other aid-giving countries, which tends to rule
 them out of really..big projects even if lack
 of funds or high-quality equipment or materials
 did not. "The Chinese government does not
 wish to share the credit for its aid," says
 Mr. Miao. "They want It to be entirely Chi-
 nese:"
 This accent on a positive political return
 characterizes Red Chinese aid around the
 world. Emphasis is heavy on what are called
 "labor intensive" projects-meaning things like
 road-building that provide a pretext for bring-
 Ing in large numbers of Ped Chinese "tech-
 nicians" to lend a hand. The tendency is
 strong, too, to turn off aid rapidly when no
 political pay-off results. When Cuba's Commu-
 nists leaned hard in the direction of Moscow,
 for example, Peking suddenly could..#ind no
 further need for buying Fidel Castro's sugar.
 Also, effective foreign aid management may
 be further impeded by the fact that a fair
 proportion of the people officially listed as
 Peking's overseas aid representatives aren't
 .really foreign aid men at all. Mr. Miao can't

 cus struck him as lamentably untutored  in
 matters economic.
 "I  think  they were  working for 'special
 agencies'," he. declares. What made him think
 so was partly the fact that these men had
 separate filing cabinets, to which the others
 did not have access, and partly the need for
 the. most careful coaching of these men when-
 ever, for the sake of appearances, they did
 have to engage in economic palaver with the
 Syrians. "We used to have to, what do you
 say, brief them for hours, and then usually
 sit in with them in.their business discussions,"
 he recalls.
 He guesses what they were really doing was
 collecting intelligence. or "making propaganda,
 such as telling any Syrians they ran into
 what was wrong about your American 14
 points for peace in Vietnam."
 Syria's example, however, Is not matched
 everywhere around the world. Though Chinese
 economic aid is only a, fraction of that of the
 Soviet bloc or of the U.S., it has had some
 successes in lands such as Yemen, Mali or
 that part of present-day Tanzania which used
 to he the island of Zanzibar; the common de-
 nominator in most such instances is an econo-
 my measurably more backward than that of
 Red China itself.
 "Syria was too progressive, too advanced,"
 argues Mr. Miao.
 In theory, of course, there may be more
 than enough countries in the world still suf-
 ficiently backward to provide fertile ground
 for Chinese "economic aid" as well as for
 Lin Plao's liberation wars.
 But the impression Miao Chcn-pal received,
 sitting In. Damascus, was of a homeland torn
 by a host of what he calls "contradictions" and
 "conflicts," of a ruthless "cultural revolution"
 likely to preoccupy Peking's leaders "for a
 long time to come" and of a limit on re-
 sources that by itself would be bound to put a
 limit on how hard and how fast Red China
 ca,n advance Its revolutionary concepts even
 at home, let alone around the globe. It was
