 AGREEMENT   .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .       Page  1
 Soviet disarmament delegate Zorin, responding to an
 earlier informal US presentation of views,~on 7 June moved
 toward the American position by accepting' suggestions on
 three points at issue.  However, the Soviet Union main-
 tained intact its minimum terms for a partial agreement
 as set forth in its 30 April proposals--suspension or
 cessation of nuclear tests, renunciation of the use of
 nuclear weapons, and a commitment to reduce forces beyond
 the first-stage level of 2,500,000 for the US and the USSR.
 In the forthcoming phase of the London talks, Zorin
 probably will seek to focus attention on two issues on
 which Moscow apparently believes the West's position is
 most difficult to defend--a nuclear test ban and a Euro-
 pean inspection zone.
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  2
 Developments favorable to the West in the first phase
 of the Lebanese election coincide with potentially impor-
 tant setbacks for Nasr in his relations with other Arab
 governments.  King Saud's six-day visit to Jordan which
 commenced on 8 June highlights the emergence of an impor-
 tant Arab bloc estranged from Nasr.  Meanwhile, relations
 between Jordan and Egypt have virtually been broken off,
 and there are growing indications of Saudi rapprochement
 with Iraq.
 NEW ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CRISIS   .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  Page  4
 The search for a new Italian premier to succeed Chris-

 .ing place in an atmosphere of political bitterness accen
 tufted' by press demands for early elections.       Formation of
 an exclusively Christian Democratic caretaker cabinet, to
 govern pending elections advanced to autumn         seems the
 most likely solution.

 THE NEW FRENCH GOVERNMENT         . .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  Page   5
 Maurice Bourges-Maunoury, youngest premier under the
 Fourth Republic, will be obliged to follow the general
 lines of the Mollet policy on the key financial and North
 African problems.  His strong nationalism will be a com-
 plicating factor, however, in any discussion of France's
 role in Africa and the Middle East as well as on disarma-
 ment.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 NORTH AFRICA    .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  . .  . . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 Clashes between French army units and the Tunisian
 national guard continue.     As a result, Premier Bourghiba
 has renewed his demands that France evacuate all Tunisia
 except the strategic base at Bizerte.  The French contend
 that Bourghiba cannot maintain order.   In Algeria, the
 widely publicized Melouza massacre which occurred on 28
 May and the riots by Europeans on 11 June are symptomatic
 of the continuing deterioration of the security situation.

 KARACHI SESSION OF BAGHDAD PACT COUNCIL  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  .  Page  2
 The recent meeting of the Baghdad pact council in
 Karachi demonstrated that, despite differences of opinion
 on procedural and organizational matters, the members are
 basically united in their desire to get ahead with the
 business of area defense planning.  There is agreement
 that while the membership of other Arab states is de-
 sirable, no pressure will be exerted to bring them in at
 this time.
 KISHI'S WASHINGTON VISIT    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  3
 The major purpose of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's
 visit to Washington, scheduled for 19-21 June, is to lay
 the foundation for a change in the "basic spirit" of the
 relationship between the United States and Japan.               He
 apparently feels the key to better relations lies in re-
 vising the US-Japanese security treaty and administrative
 agreement, but he is expected also to seek adjustments on
 several other major issues.   These include the status of
 the Ryukyus and the Bonins, China trade, nuclear tests and
 the release of Japanese war criminals.

 BULGANIN-KHRUSHCHEV VISIT TO FINLAND    .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  .  Page   5
 Bulganin and Khrushchev on 13 June ended their seven-
 day visit to Finland--their first to a non-Communist coun-
 try since the Hungarian revolution.                  The two leaders made
 a special attempt to demonstrate that Soviet-Finnish re-
 lations constitute a prime example of friendly intercourse
 between countries regardless of their social systems.
 Although the Soviet delegation included high government,
 defense and trade officials, no outstanding problems be-
 tween the two countries were negotiated.

 ORGANIZED RESISTANCE TO SOVIET LITERARY POLICY    .  .  .  .  .  Page  6
 At a recent Communist Party meeting of Moscow writers,
 it was openly charged that the editors of the much-criti-
 cized almanac Literaturnaya Moskva, supported by several
 liberal young authors,  a  formed an "opposition group" on
 the basis of a "clearly defined literary-political plat-
 form not in conformity with the party's policy in the
 field of literature."  The platform is alleged to advo-
 cate "democracy without bounds," "freedom of the press
 "
 and other "petty-bourgeois vacillations."                                   25X1
 HUNGARY'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS   .  .  .  . .  . . .  .  .  . .  .      .  .  Page  7
 Fiscal policies underlying this year's economic plan
 and budget in Hungary have been radically revised in order
 to meet some of the country's grave economic problems.
 Investments, military expenditures and outputgoals have
 been cut drastically.  Nonetheless, judging from the poor
 performance during the first quarter of this year, it
 seems that even these modest goals are too high.  For the
 foreseeable future, Hungary will continue to be an eco-
 nomic liability to the Soviet bloc.                                           25X1

 order to avoid army service, East German youth are flee-

 As a result of his preliminary investigation of the
 Cyprus question, NATO Secretary General Spaak believes
 that internationally guaranteed independence offers the
 most helpful basis for reopening negotiations.  British
 governor Harding wants London to make some positive move

 Lt. Col. Sumual, commander in East Indonesia, and
 army chief of staff General Nasution have reached a "mu-
 tual understanding" for "normalizing" military, economic
 and financial relations between East Indonesia and the
 Djakarta government.   The degree to which such, an under-
 standing will be implemented remains to be seen.   Mean-
 while, the economic consequences of the separatist move-
 ments are becoming increasingly apparent.  Prime Minister
 Djuanda plans to submit the $100,000,000 Soviet technical
 aid agreement to parliament in the near future.

 Laotian prime minister-designate Katay is attempting
 to form a cabinet in which all major parties will be repre-
 sented.                      His chances of success, while still fair, have
 been somewhat reduced as a result of the unfavorable re-
 action of a number of deputies to his proposed tough
 policy toward the Pathet Lao.  The Pathets, meanwhile,
 are engaged in an all-out effort to block Katay and re-
 turn Souvanna Phouma to office.

 The upcoming session of Communist China's National
 People's Congress--nominally the highest organ of govern-
 ment--will probably stress Peiping's policy of general
 relaxation in internal affairs, reaffirming in particular
 the regime's decision to allow popular criticism of the
 Chinese Communist Party.  The highlight of the session,
 scheduled to open on 20 June, is likely to be Chou En-
 lai's foreign policy report in which he will probably
 support all Soviet policies toward the West and under-
 score the importance of bloc unity, while pointing out
 that such unity does not require complete agreement among

 COMMUNIST CHINA CHARGES INTRUSION BY AMERICAN

 Peiping can be expected to use the 12 June incident
 near Swatow involving American aircraft in its propaganda
 campaign against Taiwan.         The Chinese Communists were
 quick to link their allegations of intrusions of Ameri-
 can naval aircraft with charges of new American "aggres-
 sion and provocation."  The Communist charges were not
 unusual, either in tone or the speed with which they were

 President Fulgencio Batista's government has suffered

 It has failed in its drive against the rebels in eastern
 Cuba and in its efforts to promote a political compromise
 in Havana.  Batista's ability to retain control until the
 end of his term in February 1959 is uncertain.)
 THE CANADIAN ELECTIONS                                               Page 15
 The failure of either of the major Canadian parties
 to win a majority in the 10 June election and the absence
 of any apparent basis for a coalition suggest that new
 elections may be held soon.  Most observers expect, how-
 ever, that the Conservatives will in the meantime form a
 government which would display heightened sensitivity
 about Canadian sovereignty in relation to the United
 States, and seek to tighten relations with Britain and
 the Commonwealth.

 Communist intellectuals in Eastern Europe have begun

 are at some variance with Soviet doctrine (especially
 Chinese concepts of "let all flowers bloom" and "internal
 contradictions"), and writers in the hard-line Satellites
 have begun to do the same.  With the exception of Hungary,
 these hard-line Satellite regimep have avoided:interpreta-

 stress that the new Chinese doctrines are not necessarily
 applicable elsewhere in the Communist world.  This ap-
 proach, which is probably intended to check any ground-
 swell of Chinese-inspired intellectual ferment, has re-
 cently been sanctioned by Khrushchev and may become the
 orthodox line in the Soviet bloc.

 SHORTCOMINGS IN COMMUNIST CHINA'S ECONOMIC PLANNING  . .  .  Page  3
 The Chinese Communists recently have admitted they
 made "serious mistakes" in being overambitious in eco-
 nomic planning, implying that this was in part a result
 of their past dependence on Soviet economic advice.  These
 mistakes, they say, are the cause of the raw material and
 consumer goods shortages as well as the financial strin-
 gencies of the past six months which forced Peiping to
 make 1957 a year of retrenchment and austerity.   Indica-
 tions are that a conservative outlook will affect China's
 Second Five-Year Plan (1958-1962).  The investment pattern
 for the plan is to be altered to give an increased pro-
 portion of funds to light industry and agriculture, and
 more emphasis will be put on the construction of small-
 and medium-sized enterprises which can be designed and
 equipped from China's own resources.                                           25X1
 SINO-CEYLONESE RICE-RUBBER AGREEMENT TO BE RENEGOTIATED      Page  7
 The Ceylonese government is preparing to renegoti-
 ate with Communist China the five-year rice-rubber agree-
 ment which expires at the end of 1957.  A delegation
 tentatively scheduled to visit Peiping this month for
 this purpose will probably find the Chinese disinclined
 to sign an agreement as favorable as that obtained by
 Ceylon in 1952.   Signature of a less favorable agree-
 ment would subject Prime Minister Bandaranaike's govern-
 ment to considerable domestic criticism.  A breakdown of
 negotiations without agreement could have repercussions
 seriously affecting the government's stability.
 SOME LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNISTS LOOKING TO PEIPING  . .  .  .  Page  9
 Some Latin American Communist Party leaders--partic-
 ularly in Ecuador, Chile, Colombia and Costa Rica--have
 recently been emphasizing the applicability of the methods
 and activities of the Chinese Communist Party to Latin
 American conditions.   Ideologically, the Communists cite
 parallels between pre-Communist China and Latin America,
 such as economic domination by foreign capital and a "semi-
 colonial" political status.

 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 USSR MODIFIES PROPOSALS FOR PARTIAL DISARMAMENT AGREEMENT
 Soviet disarmament dele-
 gate Zorin, responding to an
 earlier informal US presenta-
 tion of views, on 7 June moved
 toward the American position by
 accepting suggestions on three
 points at issue.   However, the
 USSR maintained intact its
 minimum terms for a partial
 agreement as set forth in its
 30 April proposals--suspension
 or cessation of nuclear tests,
 renunciation of the use of
 nuclear weapons, and a commit-
 ment to reduce forces beyond
 the first-stage level of 2,500,-
 000 for the US and the USSR.
 In the forthcoming phase of the
 London talks, Zorin probably
 will seek to focus attention on
 two issues on which Moscow ap-
 parently believes the West's
 position is most difficult to
 defend--a nuclear test ban and
 a European inspection zone.
 The Soviet memorandum, pre-
 sented by Zorin on 7 June, agreed
 to the United States delegate's
 suggestions for (1) a three-
 stage reduction of forces;  (2)
 an inspection system to enforce
 a cessation of nuclear tests;
 and (3) armaments reductions by
 specific quantities rather than
 on a percentage basis as the
 USSR had previously proposed.
 While Zorin has consistent-
 ly stated that the USSR regards
 a commitment to reduce forces
 beyond the first-stage level of
 2,500,000 for the US and the
 Soviet Union as an essential
 part of a limited agreement, he
 had indicated at the end of
 April that the precise amount
 of reductions was "negotiable."
 He now has agreed to the US sug-
 gestion that conventional forces
 be reduced in three stages: to
 2,500,000 men for the US and
 the Soviet Union in the first
 stage, to 2,100,000 in the
 second stage, and to 1,700,000
 in the third stage.
 The Soviet memorandum re-
 quires that any partial agree-
 ment must commit the signatories
 to all three stages and implies
 that the US position that the
 second- and third-stage reduc-
 tions are dependent on progress
 toward political settlements is
 unacceptable.
 In response to the United
 States' position that there must
 be an inspection system to
 supervise a cessation of nuclear
 tests, Zorin's 7 June memo
 abandoned Moscow's previous posi-
 tion, expressed as recently as
 20 April in Bulganin's letter
 to Prime Minister Macmillan,
 that no such inspection is neces-
 sary to stop tests.   Moscow now
 indicates "readiness to estab-
 lish such control" and proposes
 that control posts be established
 in the Soviet Union, the United
 States, the United Kingdom,
 and "in the area of the Pacific
 Ocean."
 Zorin, however, repeated
 the standard Soviet demand for
 an immediate and unconditional
 cessation of nuclear tests in-
 dependent of any other aspects
 of the disarmament problem.
 He rejected the US proposal for
 a ten-month cessation of tests
 on the grounds that it is made
 contingent upon Soviet agreement
 to halt production of nuclear
 weapons and that it "could
 actually be used to prepare for
 subsequent tests."  The Soviet

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 government, according to Zorin's
 memo, believes that a temporary
 cessation of tests should last
 "at least two or three years."
 The third modification in
 the Soviet proposals for a par-
 tial agreement accepted the US
 position that armaments reduc-
 tions should be negotiated in
 specific quantities rather than
 on a percentage basis.   Moscow's
 30 April proposals had called
 for a flat 15-percent reduction
 in both armaments and military
 budgets during the first stage
 of a partial agreement.
 The Soviet memorandum
 again demanded that the powers.
 assume "a solemn obligation to
 renounce the use for military
 purposes of atomic and hydrogen
 weapons" and rejected the US
 position concerning exceptions
 to a prohibition on the use
 of these weapons as tantamount
 to a "legalization" of their
 use.   Zorin charged that the
 US position would make possible
 a "completely arbitrary use of
 atomic weapons" and stated that
 the "Soviet Union cannot be a
 partner in such a deal."
 On  the question of aerial
 inspection, Zorin confirmed
 Soviet readiness to consider
 establishing "appropriate zones"
 but noted the "negative attitude"
 of the United States toward the
 zones proposed in Moscow's 30
 April plan.   Zorin stated that
 "a solution should be sought,
 not in rejecting or narrowing
 aerial control, but rather in
 its expansion."  This statement
 reflected the Soviet leaders'
 belief that Western European,
 particularly official West
 German, opposition to a European
 inspection zone will provide
 them with a chance to repeat the
 charge that the United States
 is again abandoning its own
 disarmament proposals after the
 USSR accepts them.
 Moscow is likely to reject
 any Western proposals which do
 not provide for a European in-
 spection zone and can be ex-
 pected to exploit heavily any
 opportunity to blame West German
 opposition to a European zone
 for any failure to reach a par-
 tial agreement.   Soviet propa-
 ganda since Chancellor Adenauer's
 visit to Washington has stressed,
 that the US and West Germany have
 formed a "united front" to pre-
 vent any disarmament.   Zorin
 told the US delegate on 3 June
 that the disarmament talks
 should not be complicated by
 political questions and warned
 that if the US brings the Ger-
 man question into the disarma-
 ment talks, it would hamper
 progress in both disarmament
 and reunification.

 However, the election in the
 predominantly Moslem northern
 city of Tripoli, scheduled for
 30 June,  could be attended by
 antigovernment demonstrations
 requiring army action.
 A New Arab Bloc
 Election developments in
 Lebanon coincide with important
 setbacks for Nasr in his rela-
 tions with other Arab govern-
 ments.   As a result, Nasr has
 become more cautious and ap-
 parently is attempting to cur-
 tail somewhat his conspiratorial
 activities against his Arab
 "allies."
 King Saud's six-day visit
 to Jordan which commenced on 8
 June highlights the emergence
 of an important Arab bloc
 estranged from Nasr.
 On 10 June, during Saud's
 visit, Jordan expelled the
 Egyptian military attache and
 the consul general in Jerusalem
 for subversive activities; Egypt
 responded by demanding the re-
 call of Jordan's ambassador.
 Meanwhile,  relations between
 Egypt and Jordan have virtually
 been broken off.
 Saud's attitude toward Nasr
 has undergone a marked trans-
 formation following the disclo-
 sure of Egyptian intrigue
 against various Arab governments,
 including his own.
 Jordan
 In Jordan, King Hussain
 appears willing to risk pro-
 voking Nasr by his determina-     25X1
 tion to eradicate and publicly
 discredit Egyptian influence.
 Jordan's economic plight
 remains serious despite Saudi
 and American aid.   At least
 a $20,000,000 budget deficit
 threatens, largely because of
 the refusal of Egypt and Syria
 to provide aid promised to re-
 place the old British subsidy.
 It has been announced that
 this aid will not be forthcoming
 unless Jordan adheres to the
 line of "positive neutrality"
 espoused by Nasr.

 At least two of these transited

 Prime Minister Ben-Gurion
 on 7 June reaffirmed Israel's
 intention to send one of its

 stated on 11 June that this

 NEW ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CRISIS
 The search for a new

 of political bitterness accen-

 early elections.   Formation
 of an exclusively Christian
 Democratic caretaker cabinet,
 to govern pending elections
 advanced to autumn, seems the
 most likely solution.
 Zoli's failure makes it
 improbable that any Christian
 Democratic government except
 a caretaker one could win par-
 liamentary approval.   Zoli
 himself repudiated the backing
 of the extreme right, and the
 Nenni Socialists refused their
 support despite his left-of-

 further alienated the small
 center parties, which formerly
 co-operated with the Christian
 Democrats.
 Widespread dissatisfaction
 over the prospect of another
 year of parliamentary indecision
 may lead to elections in the
 fall.   In such a case, an all-
 Christian Democratic minority
 cabinet will probably be set up
 to prepare for elections.   For-
 mer premier Giuseppe Pella, Sen-
 ate president Cesare Merzagora
 and Pietro Campilli, former
 minister in charge of southern
 development, have been mentioned
 as the most logical candidates
 to head a caretaker government.
 Such a government's only
 pressing task would be next
 year's appropriations which
 must be provisionally approved
 by parliament before 1 July and
 given final approval by 31
 October.   If the Chamber of
 Deputies were dissolved by Pres-
 ident Gronchi in late July, elec-
 tions could then take place in
 early October.   This timing
 would meet the constitutional
 provision for elections within    25X1
 70 days of dissolution without
 interfering with the harvest or
 the summer holidays.
 THE NEW FRENCH GOVERNMENT
 Maurice Bourges-Maunoury,
 at 42 the youngest premier under
 the Fourth Republic, will be
 obliged to follow the general
 lines of the Mollet policy on
 the key financial and North
 African problems.  His strong
 nationalism will be a compli-
 cating factor, however, in any
 discussion of France's role in
 Africa and the Middle East as
 well as on disarmament.
 His small 240-192 investi-
 ture majority is mainly the re-
 sult of a last-minute decision
 by the Popular Republicans to
 Abstain.  The new premier's
 shaky start is also emphasized
 by the rightists' warning that
 the 60 Independent votes for
 investiture cannot necessarily
 be counted on in the future,
 and by widespread dissatisfac-
 tion within the ranks of the
 Socialists, despite their sup-
 port.
 Like Mollet's this is a
 minority government; the only
 major cabinet change is the re-
 moval of Socialist Paul Ramadier
 from the Finance Ministry.  Em-
 phasis on exploiting Saharan
 oil resources is evident in the
 establishment of a Ministry for
 the Sahara.  Ramadier's ouster
 is a sop to the right, and his
 successor, Radical Socialist
 Felix Gaillard, may be under
 less immediate pressure to sup-
 port Socialist welfare goals.
 He will, however, probably
 push an austerity fiscal policy
 basically the same as that on
 which Mollet fell.
 Although Robert Lacoste
 continues as minister residing
 in Algeria, he reportedly has
 accepted the idea of some modi-
 fication in his "pacification
 first" policy.   Bourges-Maunoury
 has already proposed a temporary

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 NORTH AFRICA
 Four clashes between French
 army units and the Tunisian
 national guard occurred on
 June 7 in the Gabes region of
 central Tunisia.   As a result,
 Premier Bourghiba has renewed
 his demands that France evacuate
 all Tunisia except the strategic
 base at Bizerte.   French and
 Tunisian reports vary widely
 on the cause of the clashes in
 which seven French soldiers
 and six Tunisians were killed.
 A French communique of 2
 June implied that the French
 army would ignore Bourghiba's
 order that it not leave its
 barracks without advance author-
 ization.   Bourhiba has told
 the American ambassador that
 the French army considers itself
 above civilian control and is
 "determined again to establish
 France"  in Tunisia.
 The French claim, mean-
 while,that three of the 7 June
 incidents occurred even though
 authorization for troop move-
 ments had been given by local
 authorities in Gabes.   A French
 spokesman in Paris has told
 the American embassy that
 Bourghiba rejected a French
 proposal that a French-Tunisian
 commission of inquiry investi-
 gate the clashes.  The alleged
 rejection may have occurred in
 a note handed the French ambas-
 sador in Tunis on 9 June urging
 a "review of recent incidents"
 and reiterating Tunis'  demand
 for the withdrawal of French
 troops before any defense
 negotiations with France begin.
 The French spokesman also
 charged that the Tunisian
 government may have provoked
 the incidents to arouse public
 opinion against the French
 army and provide a basis for
 an appeal to the United Nations.
 However, he, as well as French
 officials  in Tunis, drew atten-
 tion to the possibility that
 Algerians or anti-Bourghiba
 elements may have instigated
 the incidents and that Bourghiba
 is reluctant to admit he cannot
 enforce order.
 The Tunisian security
 forces--which number less than
 5,000, including the 2,200-
 man Tunisian army--lack the
 essential materiel and mobility
 to maintain order, partly
 because France has withheld
 essential supplies.   French
 forces  in Tunisia have been
 reduced to 25,000, according
 to the Paris spokesman,  and
 will be drawn on heavily to
 meet the request of Robert La-
 coste, French minister residing
 in Algiers,  for more troops.
 The reduction envisaged by Paris
 may have to be stepped up con-
 siderably if present tensions
 are to be alleviated.
 The well-disciplined Neo-
 Destour youth and Neo-Destour-
 affiliated labor groups have
 been unusually active, possibly
 in preparation for action a-
 gainst French forces or a de-
 fense against Algerian subver-
 sion.

 reportedly has succeeded in
 deterring some Moslems from
 rallying to support France, and
 many Moslems who had accepted
 administrative appointments
 recently now are resigning.
 Both the Algerian National
 Liberation Front (FNL) and the
 French are attempting to cap-
 italize on the incident.  The
 FLN--claiming  that the massacre
 was a French act--is working
 through the Arab-Asian bloc in
 the United Nations to demand
 an international investigation.
 The French government, probably
 in a bid for support when the
 Algerian issue is brought be-
 fore the UN again this fall,
 has invited the United States
 and eight other governments to
 send observers to the Melouza
 area to question survivors.
 Meanwhile, terrorism seems
 on the upsurge throughout Alge-
 ria.   The explosion of time
 bombs in lamp posts on 3 June
 and in a casino on 9 June--re-
 sulting in 16 persons killed
 and 70 wounded--were the most
 spectacular incidents in Algiers
 since a milk bar bombing last
 fall.   European youths, seeking
 vengeance for the casino bomb-
 ing, staged all-day riots on 11
 June, during which they clubbed
 at least five Moslems to death.

 KARACHI SESSION OF BAGHDAD PACT COUNCIL
 The recent meeting of the
 Baghdad pact council in Kara-
 chi demonstrated that, despite
 differences of opinion on pro-
 cedural and organizational mat-
 ters, the members are basically
 united in their desire to get
 ahead with the business of area
 defense planning.  There is
 agreement that while the mem-
 bership of other Arab states is
 desirable, no pressure will be
 exerted to bring them in at
 this time.
 The Karachi meeting was
 the first at which Britain was
 formally represented since the
 Suez crisis.   The Middle East
 members also enthusiastically
 welcomed American participation
 as a full member of the economic
 and military committees of the
 pact.   They continue to hope
 for eventual full American mem-
 bership.
 The note of optimism on
 which the council adjourned does
 not reflect, however, the heated
 debates and inner conflicts of
 the four-day session when mat-
 ters of extreme national con-
 cern were discussed.   The air
 cleared somewhat when the chief
 delegates, in restricted session,

 such as Pakistan's concern over

 area of military responsibility,
 creation of a military command
 system and a declaration of
 common   action   in the event of
 Soviet intervention in the pact
 area.    These basic problems
 were all apparently reconciled
 during the course of the ses-
 sion, but evidence of lingering
 dissatisfaction indicates that
 they will continue to be areas
 of controversy.
 Pakistan and Iraq are espe-
 cially interested in broadening
 the terms of reference to in-
 clude possible subversion from
 India and Israel.   At one point
 Pakistani prime minister Suhra-
 wardy asserted that because of
 the limitations of the terms
 of reference, the "whole pact
 structure was being shaken."
 The pact members are most anx-
 ious to delineate the geograph-
 ical area of pact responsibili-
 ty in relation to NATO and
 SEATO and to develop a military
 defense command.   The Middle
 East delegates especially re-
 gard the clarification of area
 responsibility as essential for
 military planning in peace and
 control of military operations
 in war.   They have stated that
 without such planning the Bagh-
 dad pact is merely words.
 It was finally agreed to
 set up a unified Directorate
 of Combined Military Planning
 with the directorship rotating
 among the member countries and
 an American general or flag
 officer as deputy director.
 This organization is merely a
 planning structure, however,
 without command functions. The
 British delegate urgently pro-
 posed the beginning of a common
 Baghdad pact infrastructure
 program aimed at improving air-
 fields and improving the radar
 coverage of the area, especial-
 ly plugging the serious radar
 gap in Iran.   Britain's desire
 to support the Middle East mem-
 bers' defense aims is high-
 lighted by the British offer
 of a $1,400,000 annual contri-
 bution for agreed infrastructure
 projects.
 The proposed political
 declaration,  which would in ef-
 fect decree that Soviet inter-
 vention against any member of
 the Baghdad pact would consti-
 tute aggression against all
 members, was deferred until the
 Ankara meeting of the council
 next January.   There was also
 a consensus that further meas-
 ures should be taken to continue
 the trend toward Egyptian prime
 minister Nasr's isolation and
 to cultivate a pro-Western poli-
 cy on the part of Afghanistan.
 The decision to omit from
 the final communique any ref-
 erence to such specific problems
 discussed as Palestine, Algeria,
 Cyprus, and Kashmir undoubtedly
 lessened the criticism from
 nonpact  countries.

 He has expressed the hope that
 some of the 7,000 former resi-
 dents of the Bonin Islands will
 be permitted to return to their
 homes soon.   He will also prob-
 ably seek an early release of
 the 67 American-sentenced war
 criminals still in detention.
 As for China trade controls,
 Japan will not immediately fol-
 low Britain's example in abolish-
 ing the China trade differential,
 but the prime minister will
 probably point out that Japan
 cannot accept for long a dis-
 criminatory position vis-a-vis
 its major competitors.
 Kishi recently completed
 a tour of six Asian nations de-
 signed partly to establish him-
 self in American eyes as a
 spokesman for Asia.   Most ob-
 servers believe he failed in
 this purpose but that, as a re-
 sult of the tour, he is likely
 to make a strong plea, based on
 general Asian sentiment for the
 cessation of nuclear tests.  Al-
 though he found only lukewarm
 support for an Asian development
 fund--a favorite project of
 his--he is expected to press
 for co-ordinating US financial
 aid with Japanese technology
 and materials in developing
 Asian economies.
 Kishi has avoided building
 up Japanese expectations regard-
 ing the outcome of his talks in
 Washington.   He reportedly hopes
 as a minimum to gain American
 approval in principle for the
 establishment of a joint com-
 mittee to revise the administra-
 tive agreement, for the return
 of former residents to the Bonin
 Islands, and for the creation of
 an Asian development fund.   He
 believes this would give him a
 political victory at home and
 permit his government to main-
 tain the close relations with
 the United States which he
 favors.
 The Socialists, who are
 planning a large rally to em-
 barrass Kishi on the eve of his
 departure, are preparing to
 launch a major attack on him if
 he fails to achieve his objec-
 tives.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Bulganin and Khrushchev
 on 13 June ended their seven-
 day visit to Finland--their
 first to a non-Communist coun-
 try since the Hungarian revolu-
 tion.          The two leaders made a
 special attempt to demonstrate
 that Soviet-Finnish relations
 constitute a prime example of
 friendly intercourse between
 countries regardless of their
 social systems.  Although the
 Soviet delegation included
 high government, defense and
 trade officials, no outstanding
 problems between  the two
 countries were negotiated with
 the exception of a trade proto-
 col.
 The official communique
 signed and issued on 12 June
 reportedly was based almost
 wholly on the Finnish draft.
 It reaffirmed Finland's neutral-
 ity and aim to "contribute to
 the development of a better
 mutual understanding and greater
 accord based on mutual confi-
 dence."
 Recognition of the princi-
 ple of universal membership as
 a "natural prerequisite" for
 the success of the UN reflects
 the Soviet desire for Finnish
 support of Red China in the
 General Assembly.   Both govern-
 ments acknowledged the need for
 international control, a ban
 on the use of nuclear weapons,
 and an unconditional cessation
 of tests.   An additional proto-
 col called for an expansion of
 trade in 1957 by $25,000,000.
 According to the terms, the So-
 viet Union will supply Finland
 with much-needed steel and oil
 products in return for Finnish
 power cables,and pulp and paper
 products.
 Stressing the exemplary
 nature of Soviet-Finnish rela-
 tions, the Soviet leaders during
 their visit urged Finland to
 promote conditions of peace in
 northern Europe.   During the
 time set aside for formal talks,
 Khrushchev made a 40-minutes;..;..
 denunciation of the United
 States, echoing the Bulganin
 letters to Norway and Denmark
 warning that small nations hav-
 ing atomic bases near the So-
 viet Union risk annihilation in
 the event of war.   Khrushchev
 suggested that Finland should
 convince the Nordic countries
 of this danger.
 The reaction of the Finns
 to these overtures demonstrates
 their determination to maintain
 strict neutrality.    Finnish
 foreign minister Virolainen told
 25X1
 Finland could not possibly com-
 ply with the Soviet request to
 influence the Nordic countries
 since such action would  con-
 flict with Finnish policy of
 noninvolvement.
 The Soviet leaders were
 afforded a polite but modest
 reception by the Finnish public,
 and the presence of Bulganin
 and Khrushchev at the Finnish
 Trade Union celebration was
 given no special recognition.
 At a state dinner, Bulganin
 presented  to Finnish president
 Kekkonen a, personal invitation
 from Soviet president Voroshilov
 to visit the USSR at the earliest
 convenient time.   Voroshilov
 visited Finland  last August,
 and any return visit by Kekkonen
 probably would not take place
 until next year in view of his
 scheduled trips to Iceland and
 Denmark.
 By continuing to promote
 exchange visits of high officials,
 and thus keep alive the Finns'
 hope that Karelia will be re-
 turned, Soviet leaders probably
 hope to keep Finland strictly
 neutral.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ORGANIZED RESISTANCE TO SOVIET LITERARY POLICY
 At a recent Communist
 party meeting of Moscow writers,
 it was openly charged that the
 editors of the much-criticized
 almanac Literaturnaya Moskva,
 supported byliberal_y uung
 authors--Dudintsev (of Not by
 Bread Alone fame), Yashtn
 aut or of-a satirical sketch
 Levers, a thinly disguised
 criticism of the Soviet system),
 Kron (whose Notes of a Writer
 has been severely criticize
 and others--had formed an "op-
 position group" on the basis
 of a "clearly defined literary-
 political platform not in con-
 formity with the party's policy
 in the field of literature."
 The platform is alleged to ad-
 vocate "democracy without bounds,
 "freedom of the press," and
 other "petty-bourgeois vacilla-
 tions."
 Although they actively de-
 fended their position at the
 March plenum of the board of
 the Moscow Writers' Union, these
 rebellious writers allegedly
 took a "pledge of silence" at
 the 14-17 May plenum of the All-
 Union Writers' Union attended
 by party secretaries Shepilov
 and Pospelov, and refused to
 acknowledge their mistakes or
 submit to group criticism.   The
 report of the Moscow party meet-
 ing states that they still "per-
 sist in their errors."
 Furtseva spoke at the Mos-
 cow party meeting, and a deci-
 sion was adopted "which noted
 that ideological vacillations
 of certain Communists have led
 to factionalism by the Litera-
 turnaya Moskva editorial bard
 deserving the severest condemna-
 tion."
 Statements at the meeting
 and other recent developments
 indicate that the Literaturnaya
 Moskva board enjoys the taeft-
 support of a considerable number
 of less outspoken Moscow writers
 and that the Moscow writers' or-
 ganization has been convulsed
 for several months by internal
 quarrels centering around con-
 troversial publications in
 Literaturnaya Moskva and the
 literary journals Navy Mir and
 Moskovsky Literator.   Since the
 dissident writers are of the
 younger generation, the attempt
 to restrain them by older ortho-
 dox writers inevitably has over-
 tones of a struggle between the
 generations.   There is also
 evident resentment on the part
 of non-Russian writers of the
 privileged positions and luxuri-
 ous lives of the Moscow writers,
 who are almost exclusively Great
 Russians.
 Although a number of writers
 were purged or withdrew from
 creative work during Stalin's
 lifetime rather than conform to
 party directives,  this movement
 is the first known organized re-
 sistance to the party line by
 writers since the early thirties
 and poses a serious problem for
 the regime.   The editor of
 Moskovsky Literator has already
 been replaced, and more edi-
 torial shifts may well follow.

 Fiscal policies underlying
 this year's economic plan and
 budget in Hungary have been
 radically revised in order to
 meet some of the country's grave
 economic problems.   Investments,
 military expenditures and out-
 put goals have been cut drasti-
 cally.  Nonetheless, judging
 from the poor performance dur-
 ing the first quarter of this
 year, it seems that even these
 modest goals are too high.
 Although investment outlays
 have been cut 36 percent and
 military appropriations almost
 halved, budgeted expenditures
 are 25 percent higher than last
 year.   The need to subsidize
 industries producing at a loss
 will account for over a seventh
 25X1
 of all expenditures
 budgeted and will
 negate in large part
 the economies achieved
 in military and in-
 vestment cuts.
 The severe in-
 flationary pressures
 at work in Hungary
 today are reflected
 in the fact that the
 expanded budget is
 accompanied by a plan
 to produce only 2.4
 percent more this
 year than last--a
 goal about 7 percent
 below the level a-
 chieved in 1955.
 Adding to the infla-
 tionary pressures is
 a pronounced emphasis

 over 1956 and a decline in heavy
 industrial production of 4 per-
 cent.   A major tenet of the
 economic plan is the promise
 of an increase in the standard of
 living, especially a 14-percent
 increase in the workers' pur-
 chasing power, but it seems in-
 evitable that inflation will
 make this impossible.
 Economic output during the
 first quarter was lower even
 than the regime anticipated in
 its modest plan.   Industrial
 production was 20 percent be-
 low last year, and output per
 worker was down 10 percent.   In-
 dustrial costs were up 14 per-
 cent and the average earnings
 of workers were up 20 to 25 per-
 cent.   These factors combined

 The plan calls for a 9-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 that of exports, the balance
 being paid with bloc credits.
 Since domestic production
 of consumer goods cannot bal-
 ance the increased purchasing
 power of 1956-57, the regime
 is planning to reduce exports
 of these goods in order to
 reduce inflationary pressures.
 The subsequent loss of markets
 is a serious deterrent to such
 a policy.   Shipments from the
 Soviet Union are already ap-
 proximately double the rate
 of last year.
 Further inflationary pres-
 sure comes from the abandonment
 of compulsory farm deliveries
 which puts an extra five bil-
 lion forints per year into
 the hands of the peasants.  The
 price rises of 10 May which
 run counter to the promise of
 higher living standards were
 designed to deprive the peasant
 of a part of this.  The price
 increase may be the forerunner
 of other actions to "abolish
 the unhealthy discrepancies
 between purchasing power and
 stocks" by manipulating prices,
 wages and taxes.
 The handicaps of the Hun-
 garian economy are such that
 the minimal plan for 1957 will
 probably not be achieved; nor
 is the standard of living likely
 to withstand the inroads of in-
 flation.   Credits from the bloc
 are forestalling immediate
 deterioration, but repayment
 must be started as early as
 1959 in some cases.   For the
 foreseeable future, Hungary
 will continue to be an economic
 liability to the Soviet bloc.

 The East German regime's
 determination to stamp out de-
 viationist ideas in university
 and intellectual circles is
 being emphasized at discussions
 between party leaders and uni-
 versity officials throughout
 East Germany.  Party leaders
 have made it clear that no con-
 cessions such as have been
 made to the Polish intelli-
 gentsia will be granted in East
 Germany,  and have indicated
 their belief that a purge of
 the universities is necessary.
 In discussing the problem
 in Leipzig on 2 June,  first
 secretary Walter Ulbricht said
 that "the working class wants
 honest work... study... and
 scientific discussions at uni-
 versities ... but we will not
 tolerate the organized work of
 Western intelligence agencies
 at our universities."  Threat-
 ening to withhold scholarships,
 without which few students can
 attend universities, Ulbricht
 warned that "those who cannot
 be convinced, need not accept
 scholarships of the workers
 and peasants in the German
 Democratic Republic."
 Elsewhere, party officials
 have stated that major emphasis
 in the future would be placed on
 making good socialists of stu-
 dents.   They criticized the
 party for its failure to de-
 velop strong cadres in the uni-
 versities capable of overcoming
 the limitations in the know-
 ledge of students,  limitations
 which had been exploited by the
 "enemy" to foment unrest and
 provoke dissension.  Occasional
 arrests of students allegedly
 subverted by the West have been
 widely publicized as a warning
 to students and faculty members
 alike.

 Despite the vigorous
 student opposition which
 greeted the government's an-
 nouncement limiting vacation
 travel to the West by univer-
 sity students, the restrictions
 probably will be extended to
 elementary, trade and high
 school students.   In the past
 several years student travel
 to the West has been quite ex-
 tensive.               In a corollary move,
 the regime, has stepped up pro-
 paganda urging students to

 volunteer for mining, farm and
 factory work during the summer
 holidays, and has announced a
 broad summer camp program.
 The travel restrictions,
 the most stringent limitation
 on intra-German travel since
 1953, are aimed primarily at
 curbing student visits to West
 Germany during the summer va-
 cation.  The Communists not
 only fear that many students
 would defect if permitted to
 travel freely, but that those
 who returned would be infected
 by democratic ideas and make
 invidious comparisons of life
 in East and West Germany.   Al-
 though the regulation permits
 "visits with close relatives"
 and trips "which serve either
 scientific purposes or peaceful
 rapprochement between the
 German Democratic Republic and
 the state concerned," it is
 clear that permission
 for visits to the
 West will be granted
 only to those whose
 loyalty is beyond
 question.
 Undoubtedly
 alarmed by the gov-
 ernment's attitude
 and in order to avoid
 army service, young
 East Germans are de-
 fecting to the West
 at a rate even higher
 than last year.  De-
 spite a drop of approximately
 33 percent in the total number
 of refugees fleeing to West
 Berlin so far this year,
 there has been an increase in
 the 17-24 age group to 14,883,
 34.6 percent of the total, as
 compared with 13,234, 20.5 per-
 cent at this time last year.
 As a result of his prelim-
 inary investigation of the
 Cyprus question, NATO Secretary-
 General Spaak believes that
 guaranteed independence offers
 the most helpful basis for
 reopens ;  negotiations.   British

 outcome of Spaak's endeavors.

 and Turkey through their North

 on his views to US ambassador
 Perkins on 6 June.   Spaak feels
 that the only possible solution
 lies somewhere between the two
 extremes of union with Greece
 or partition, and he has con-
 cluded that the best basis for
 getting negotiations started
 would be internationally. guaran-
 teed independence for Cyprus
 for either an indefinite or a
 specified period.   The idea is
 premised on the drafting of an
 acceptable constitution which
 would clearly enunciate minori-
 ty group rights.   Defense of
 the island would be ensured by
 military base rights granted to
 Britain, if necessary under a
 NATO arrangement.
 The American consul at
 Nicosia, after a long talk with
 Governor Harding on 8 June,
 believes Harding wants some
 further statement from London
 indicating that Britain is
 trying to keep the door to
 limited self-government open.
 The governor fears that the
 Cyprus issue is being "pushed
 aside" in London and that even
 the reform plan for local gov-
 ernment will probably not be
 published now because of Turk-
 ish apprehensions.   Cyprus
 government officials have been
 urging London to call a con-
 ference of representative
 Cypriots immediately.
 Harding spoke somewhat
 bitterly of the new British
 Labor Party manifesto advocat-
 ing.self-determination for all
 dependent territories, saying
 that it will virtually end any
 chance that Makarios might be-
 come less intransigent.   Al-
 though the general policy advo-
 cated is not new, the issuance
 of the manifesto will probably
 further encourage Makarios to
 insist on self-determination in
 the hope that a Labor govern-
 ment will eventually come to
 power in Britain.   For the
 present, he is expected to
 visit various foreign countries
 for propaganda purposes and to
 go to the UN General Assembly
 this fall.

 Lt. Col. Sumual, commander
 in East Indonesia, and army
 chief of staff General Nasution
 have signed an agreement in
 Makassar placing the entire
 East Indonesian command direct-
 ly under Djakarta.   By this
 agreement Sumual relinquished
 his post as commander of East
 Indonesia and reportedly is to
 become a candidate for training

 Makassar radio broadcast, how-
 ever, Sumual claims to have

 financial relations between East

 authority under the reorganiza-
 tion may be, it is not at all
 clear that the "mutual under-
 standing" will be marked by
 genuine co-operation between
 Djakarta and East Indonesian
 civil and military officials.
 Sumual has stated that the
 2 March proclamation in which
 he virtually proclaimed autonomy
 for East Indonesia remains in
 force, but gives lip service
 to Djakarta's authority by say-
 ing that it is to be implemented
 within the framework of national

 The economic consequences

 East Indonesia and elsewhere

 Laotiam prime minister-des-

 representatives of the four
 major Laotian parties will serve.
 His chances of success, while
 still fair,  have been somewhat
 reduced as a result of the un-
 favorable reaction of a number
 of deputies to his proposed
 policy toward the Pathet Lao.
 The decision of former premier

 Such a development might en-
 courage deputies in the other
 parties, many of whom are wary
 of Katay's personal ambitions,
 to combine with Souvanna Phouma
 in sufficient numbers to block
 a Katay government.
 Judging from the advance
 copies of his investiture speech,
 Katay will call for a foreign
 policy based on strict neutral-
 ity and will propose continued
 negotiations with the Pathet
 Lao on terms less favorable to
 the Pathets than those advanced
 by his predecessor, Souvanna
 Phouma.   While Katay indicates

 on agreements previously con-
 cluded between Souvanna and
 the Pathets--including entry
 of Pathet representatives into
 the Laotian government--imple-
 mentation of these agreements
 is to depend on prior dissolu-
 tion of the Pathet Lao movement
 and reimposition of royal gov-
 ernment authority over the two
 northern provinces.   In order
 to check Pathet stalling, nego-
 tiations are to be limited to
 a two-month period and to be on
 a new basis:   the Pathet Lao
 will no longer bargain as a
 "state within a state" but will
 be regarded as "outlaws" who
 fought in the Viet Minh army
 against their own country.
 The next session of Com-
 munist China's National People's
 Congress, scheduled to open on
 20 June, will probably stress
 Peiping's policy of general re-
 laxation in internal affairs
 and provide the Communists with
 an opportunity to demonstrate
 the greater freedom of debate
 sanctioned in Mao Tse-tung's
 recent doctrinal pronouncements.
 The National People's Con-
 gress is nominally the highest
 organ of government in China
 and, like the USSR's Supreme
 Soviet, provides the regime with
 a platform from which to an-
 nounce major policies and plans.
 At the forthcoming session, non-
 Communists will probably enlarge
 on the unusually frank criti-
 cisms they have been voicing in
 recent weeks of the political
 impotence of China's puppet
 parties, of dogmatism in the
 arts and in science, and of the
 lack of real authority given
 to nonparty personnel.
 While a good many of these
 criticisms may have been stage-
 managed, some of them appear
 to have gone beyond the limits
 of approved argument.   For ex-
 ample, an elderly physiologist's
 condemnation of the proposal to
 abolish the Chinese script in
 favor of an alphabet is probably
 the first time since the present
 regime was established that a
 policy approved by Mao himself
 has been publicly criticized.
 The heterodox nature of the
 criticisms now being permitted
 suggests that Peiping is con-
 fident that a bold liberaliza-
 tion policy will not get out of
 hand.  Peiping's position ap-
 pears to be that blunt condemna-
 tions of the mistakes of sub-
 ordinate party personnel in all
 fields will draw the fire of
 malcontents away from the re-
 gime itself, improve the work

 CONFIDENTIAL
 NEW FERMENT IN EASTERN EUROPE
 STIMULATED BY CHINESE COMMUNIST DOCTRINES
 Communist intellectuals in
 Eastern Europe have begun to
 turn to Communist China for in-
 spiration and ideological sup-
 port.   Polish intellectuals are
 quoting Chinese doctrines con-
 cerning "all flowers" and "in-
 ternal contradictions" in sup-
 port of their own convictions,
 and writers in the hard-line
 Satellites have begun to do the
 same.  While they probably fear
 a groundswell of Chinese-in-
 spired intellectual ferment,
 the Satellite regimes, with the
 exception of Hungary, have de-
 liberately avoided direct com-
 ment on the Chinese ideas.  The
 approach in Hungary--stressing
 that the new Chinese doctrines
 are not necessarily applicable
 elsewhere in the Sino-Soviet
 bloc--has recently been sanc-
 tioned by Khrushchev himself
 and may become the orthodox line
 throughout the Soviet bloc.
 A relatively liberal atti-
 tude toward freedom of expres-
 sion in the arts, coupled with
 professions of toleration of
 non-Marxist thought, became the
 party line in Communist China
 a full year ago.   It was not
 until this year, however, that
 liberal intellectuals in Eastern
 Europe began to cite the Chinese
 doctrines as support for their
 own ideological tenets.   Until
 the suppression of liberalism
 in Hungary,  the intellectuals
 had depended on themselves, or
 looked to Yugoslavia, to the
 West and to the pronouncements,
 of the Soviet 20th party con-
 gress for inspiration and en-
 couragement.
 stimulated the search for sup-
 port from a new quarter.   The
 Chinese doctrine--"let all flow-
 ers bloom"--seemed to offer such
 support  from an unimpeachable
 Marxist source.   The "internal
 contradictions" thesis, fully
 expounded in late February,
 added new scope to the Chinese
 concepts and further encouraged
 the Satellite liberal Communists,
 particularly those in Poland.
 While the Chinese would be averse
 to intrabloc polemics develop-
 ing over their doctrines, they
 have nevertheless suggested that
 their recent formulations are
 applicable to all Communist
 countries.
 Peiping's 29 December state-
 ment on intrabloc relations,
 for example, has been described
 by one Chinese writer as the
 solution to "certain theoretical
 points on socialist societies
 which have not been set forth
 or concretely discussed in the
 Marxist classics."  Mao Tse-
 tung's formulation on the exist-
 ence of contradictions between
 the masses and the leaders in
 socialist societies has been
 acclaimed in China as a con-
 tribution to basic Communist
 theory which supersedes the
 earlier theories of Lenin.
 The Polish Interpretation
 The belief in Poland, shared
 by both the liberals and the
 regime, that winds of "funda-
 mental" and "strategic" signif i-
 cance are "blowing mightily in
 China" has been well publicized
 in the Polish press, particular-
 ly since Mao Tse-tung made his     25X1
 "secret" speeches to the Chinese
 party in late February and earl

 Titoism and of "revisionism" in

 socialism and the healthy evolu-
 tionary development of Marxism.
 In late May, the regime
 established a Polish-Chinese
 Friendship Society, the first
 such organization in the Satel-
 lites.   The society will pub-
 licize Chinese theories in Po-
 land, which--according to a Pol-
 ish politburo member--can pro-
 fit from Chinese experience as
 much as it can from the Soviet.
 The Polish liberals, when
 attacked by the regime for "re-
 visionist tendencies," cite
 Chinese thought. to bolster
 their arguments against censor-
 ship and authoritarian attitudes
 in general.   Let differences
 within the nation be solved by
 "long-range, patient and ex-
 haustive arguments and not by
 means of vulgar, primitive or
 administrative methods," the
 Poles repeat after the Chinese.
 To a Soviet writer's remark
 last winter that flowers may
 bloom but weeds must die, the
 Polish liberals answered that
 killing the weeds may also elim-
 inate some of the "choicest flow-
 ers"; further, they argued, who
 is to tell the difference be-4,
 tween the two?  Marxism itself
 was once considered a "weed."
 A Slovak Echo
 Although the Poles claim
 that the Chinese concepts are
 "pregnant with significance"
 and should thus serve as a
 "starting point for discussion
 on an international scale,"
 little overt discussion has as
 yet taken place in the hard-line
 Satellites.
 Only in Czechoslovakia have
 the intellectuals made public
 use of the Polish interpretation.
 Ignoring staunchly orthodox
 party dicta, the Slovak writers
 association journal in mid-May
 printed an attack against party
 dogmatism under the guise of a
 discussion of Chinese attitudes
 toward art and literature.
 Declaring that the people have
 the right to discuss non-Marxist
 as well as Marxist thought, the
 article observed that non-Marx-
 ists have existed and will con-
 tinue to exist and that, as
 a purely logical consideration,
 the socialists cannot play a
 leading role within a society
 unless there are some nonsocial
 ists around to be led.   It also
 noted--as have the Polish com-
 mentaries--that Marxism-Leninism
 should certainly not be afraid
 of criticism since it is strong
 enough to withstand any test.
 The Regimes React
 Private discussions of the
 Chinese concepts--in large part
 inspired by the public Polish
 comments--are undoubtedly taking
 place throughout the Soviet bloc.
 The Hungarian party, however--
 perhaps because its problems
 with the intellectuals are the
 most urgent--is the only orthodox
 one as yet to provide a full
 analysis,of the Chinese doctrines
 and their implications for East-
 ern Europe.   A party lecturer
 on the Budapest radio in late
 May, discussing "What is really
 going on in China?" give rel-
 atively,       frank treatment to the
 Chinese concepts but stressed
 that the Chinese themselves
 would protest the wholesale ap-
 plication of their doctrines in
 Hungary, where "counter.revolu---
 tionary" elements are still
 alive.
 The Rumanian regime has in
 a small way repeated the Hun-
 garian approach, without pro-
 viding full analysis.   It has
 acknowledged that the Chinese
 party is applying Marxist-
 Leninist theory to its own con-
 crete conditions and that the
 Rumanian party could learn.a
 great deal from the Chinese.
 But this acknowledgment em-
 phasized the "purity" of the
 Chinese approach, the "glorious"
 leadership of the Soviet party,
 and indicated that things to be
 learned from the Chinese are re-
 lated only to matters already
 subscribed to by the Rumanian

 proportion of funds to light

 that more emphasis will be put on
 the construction of small- and

 can be designed and equipped
 (the objective is up to 70 to
 80 percent) from China's own
 resources.
 The Planning Process
 An annual economic plan
 begins to take shape when the
 top levels of the party--ideally
 in the last half of the preced-
 ing year--draw up a set of "con-
 trol figures" or targets for
 all major economic activities.
 These "control figures" would
 appear to have already had the
 benefit of initial study by
 the government planning bodies,
 the State Planning and the Na-
 tional Economic Commissions, if
 only because of the interlocking
 party and government positions
 of the principal planners, Lu
 Fu-chun and Po I-po.   In addi-
 tion, Soviet advisers very likely
 play an important role in these
 deliberations.
 These "control figures" are
 then broken down and sent to the
 ministries concerned for study.
 The minis tries sound out the
 principal enterprises under
 their jurisdiction before arriv-
 ing at an estimate of the feasi-
 bility of the performance levels
 required.  When they are satis-
 fied as to what level can be
 reached, they submit the con-
 clusions to the National Eco-
 nomic Commission, which then be-
 gins the delicate task of "bal-
 ancing" the various sections
 into an internally consistent
 plan.   After making the needed
 adjustments, the planning organ
 submits a draft plan to the top
 party leaders.   When approved,
 it becomes a "final".plan-which
 is then supposed to be routed
 through government channels
 for ritual approval.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Planners at Work--1956
 "Don't bite off more than
 you can chew," warned the party
 leaders at the outset of the
 First Five-Year Plan (1953-19-
 57).                   But when the 1956 plan
 was drawn up, the top command,
 spirits buoyed by the gratify-
 ing 1955 harvest and by the
 rapid and easy socialization
 of agriculture and private busi-
 ness, forgot the warning.  One
 of them is reported to have re-
 marked,"We invested too much,
 we went too fast, we were wrong."
 By late 1956, resulting
 difficulties could no longer be
 ignored.   Serious shortages of
 steel, electric pow-
 er, coal, cement,
 lumber and other
 building materials
 developed.   Increases
 in individual pure,,
 chasing power outdis-
 tanced the supply of
 consumer goods.  Ag-
 gravating the result-
 ing inflationary
 pressures was the in-
 flux of a large un-
 planned addition to
 the urban labor force.
 The state's agricul-
 tural procurement
 programs, especially
 those involving grains
 and cotton, began to
 lag.   The collecti-
 vization of agricul-
 ture did not yield
 anticipated increases
 in output and actually drove
 down production of secondary
 farm products.   State buying
 prices were raised on some agri-
 cultural products, and agricul-
 tural loans were greatly in-
 creased.  The state's carefully
 shepherded reserves were run
 down and revenues were disap-
 pointing.
 The socialization of com-
 merce also seemed to hinder do-
 mestic trade.  Wastage up to 25
 percent of total investment was
 discovered on construction pro-
 jects.   In addition, there were
 transportation bottlenecks, par-
 ticularly on the rail net facing
 the North China Plain.
 On top of all this, events
 in Eastern Europe probably
 brought home to the Chinese Com-
 munists the dangers inherent in
 too slavish an imitation of the
 Stalinist emphasis on heavy in-
 dustry.  According to an article
 in a Chinese journal last Decem-
 ber, questions regarding the con-
 flict between the preferential
 development of heavy industry
 and care for the people's live-
 lihood were raised by "some com-
 rades" after seeing the "mis-
 takes" of certain Eastern Euro-
 pean countries.
 Planning for 1957
 By the time the leaders
 began programming for 1957 their
 optimistic mood had largely dis-
 sipated.  The "final" 1957 eco-
 nomic plan will not be made pub-
 lic until the National People's
 Congress meets late this month,
 but it is already clear that the
 regime sees this as a year of
 retrenchment and austerity.
 There is some evidence that
 the investment program for the
 year may be cut, perhaps by 10
 to 15 percent.  A  number of

 important projects-in heavy in-
 dustry are being suspended or
 slowed down.   Investment by
 central industrial departments
 is nevertheless to increase
 slightly and will be concen-
 trated in those fields where
 shortages have been most crip-
 pling--iron and steel, electric
 power, coal and building mate-
 rials.           The pattern of invest-
 ment in railroads has been
 shifted to lay primary emphasis
 on improving the capacity of
 overworked older lines.
 Budgetary spending on ad-
 ministration and defense is due
 for a cut.   For example,  the
 operating funds of the army's
 Rear Services Department, which
 "manages and uses" a large share
 of all military funds, have been
 cut by one third, and the armed
 forces are to be reduced in
 size as an economy measure.
 The uneven pattern of Chi-
 na's industrial growth is indi-
 cated by the fact that, while
 more than 20 of the 46 key in-
 dustrial targets were reached
 by the end of 1956, 15 will not
 be met even at the end of the
 plan this year.  Petroleum,
 railroad, equipment, nonmilitary
 ships, and almost all important
 consumer goods will not meet
 plan goals.
 To help ease China's finan-
 cial strains, the Soviet lead-
 ers have agreed to permit Pei-
 ping to delay delivery of about
 $100,000,000 in agricultural
 goods until 1958.  Moscow re-
 portedly has also agreed to a
 moratorium on repayment of Chi-
 na's debt, which now totals
 around $2 billion.
 Implications for the Future
 Commentary surrounding the
 campaign to popularize Mao Tse-
 tung's theses concerning "con-
 tradictions" suggests that pre-
 occupation with gigantic, modern
 enterprises is being reconsid-
 ered in favor of a more modest
 approach which will yield quick-
 er returns.  Central among the
 economic "contradictions" is
 the demand for building China
 into an advanced industrial
 power and what are referred to
 as the "realities of China's
 backward agricultural economy."
 Peiping recently acknowledged
 that its avid pursuit of -expen-
 sive'.large-scale modern plants
 with high standards of construc-
 tion and automation has tended
 to "overemphasize the future
 and overlook the present."  More-
 over, it is a policy which af-
 fords only limited employment
 opportunities, aniimportant con-
 sideration in overpopulated
 China.
 The correctness of past
 investment ratios between heavy
 and light industry has been
 called increasingly into ques-
 tion.  China began the First
 Five-Year Plan with the ratio
 standing at 8:1, but later re-
 duced it to 7:1.   (The ratio in
 the Soviet Union, which the Chi-
 nese say stood at around 6:1 in
 the First Five-Year Plan, has
 more recently been held at about
 '10:1; )
 As long ago as last December
 a writer in the official Peo-
 ple's Daily--possibly a party
 leader us ni g a pseudonym--sug-
 gested that China was becoming
 a "prisoner" of the theory that
 the people's livelihood had to
 be sacrificed to the demands
 of heavy industry.  He asserted
 that a stubborn pursuit of this
 policy might lead to a. situation
 where "we have neither the in-
 dustry nor the people."  Other
 writers have argued that the
 ratio should be reduced to 6:1
 for 1957 and the Second Five-
 Year Plan, and that agriculture
 should also be given a greater
 share of total investment.
 Chairman Mao reportedly has
 associated himself with these
 sentiments, and the planning
 chiefs have agreed that in the
 Second Five-Year Plan (1958-
 1962) increased proportional
 investment should be made in
 agricultural and light industry,

 They have also proposed
 that the country, while continu-
 ing to build some big modern
 plants in the Second Five-Year
 Plan, should emphasize medium-
 and small-sized enterprises
 which not only'can be designed
 and equipped by China itself,
 but also can be built more
 quickly and at less cost.   Most
 projects should be designed by
 China's own experts with the
 aim of providing 70-80 percent
 of the necessary equipment
 domestically.   Construction
 costs should be cut by 20-30
 percent and a more fluid econom-
 ic administration should be set
 up to give greater power at the
 lower levels.   Extensive re-
 visions are probably being made
 in the earlier targets for the
 plan.

 dispute on planning, including
 that surrounding the heavy/light,

 SINO-CEYLONESE RICE-RUBBER AGREEMENT TO BE RENEGOTIATED
 The Ceylonese government
 is preparing to renegotiate
 with Communist China, the five-
 year rice-rubber agreement
 which expires at the end of
 1957.   A delegation tentatively
 scheduled to visit Peiping in
 June for this purpose will
 probably find the Chinese dis-
 inclined to sign an agreement
 as favorable as that obtained
 by Ceylon in 1952.   Signature
 of a less favorable agreement
 would subject Prime Minister
 Bandaranaike's government to
 considerable criticism.   A
 breakdown of negotiations with-
 out agreement could have reper-
 cussions seriously affecting
 the government's stability.
 The 1952 Agreement
 The first five-year rice-
 rubber agreement involved the
 annual exchange of 50,000 metric
 tons of rubber-..>about half of
 Ceylon's annual production--
 in return for 270,000 metric
 tons of Chinese rice.   China
 agreed to pay a higher price
 for rubber than the world market
 rate, and the prices of both
 commodities were to be negotiated
 annually to take account of fluc-
 tuating rates.   The arrangement
 has resulted over the past four
 years in an average annual net
 profit to Ceylon of roughly.
 $10,000,000, which China has
 normally paid in sterling.

 SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 At the time of signing in
 1952, the international rubber
 embargo against Communist China
 was effective.       Ceylon did China
 an important favor by opening
 the first significantbreach.in
 the trade control system.   Si-
 multaneously, China assisted
 Ceylon out of a precarious posi-
 tion by assuring it of a regu-
 lar source of rice.
 Ceylon imports about two
 thirds of its total food sup-
 ply and half of the 1,000,000
 tons of rice it consumes an-
 nually.                      In 1952, it was suf-
 fering from the effects of
 crop failures throughout South
 and Southeast Asia.  Traditional
 suppliers such as Burma were
 unable to fill Ceylon's needs.
 Furthermore, Ceylon badly
 needed a stable market for its
 rubber.  During the war, the
 West had been cut off from
 Southeast Asian rubber, and
 Ceylon had sold its total pro-
 duction to the Allies.  The re-
 emergence of Southeast Asian
 competition in the postwar
 period, the poor condition of
 Ceylon's rubber plantations
 which had been overtapped, high
 production costs, and the grow-
 ing use of synthetic rubber put
 Ceylon in a poor market position.
 Changed Conditions
 Prime Minister Bandaranaike
 has recently said that his gov-
 ernment desires to renew the
 rice-rubber agreement, presumably
 on terms equally favorable to
 Ceylon.   Under present condi-
 tions, however, Peiping can be
 expected to take a harder bar-
 gaining position than in 1952.
 It now can buy rubber freely in
 Southeast Asia at world market
 prices, and having obtained its
 immediate political objective
 in Ceylon--the exchange of am-
 bassadors--Peiping may no longer
 see sufficient political advan-
 tage in paying premium prices.
 The Chinese Communist negotia-
 tors therefore are likely to
 offer no more than the current
 world price.  They may also
 suggest substitution of com-
 modities for sterling in set,-tling-any.annual_:tradb balance.
 During the past two years, Pei-
 ping has sought unsuccessfully
 to lighten the burden of its
 sterling payments by linking
 Chinese goods and Ceylonese
 rubber in a package deal; such
 a plan has been repugnant to
 Colombo.
 If the Ceylonese prove
 obdurate, Peiping may shift its
 rubber, purchases to Southeast
 Asia, an area where it is
 seeking closer political and
 commercial ties.   In fact, recent
 reports from Singapore indicate
 renewed Chinese interest in the
 Malayan rubber market, formerly
 the principal source of China's
 imports.  Diversion of buying
 to Malaya at this time would
 give Peiping an entering wedge
 for contacts in the Federation--
 scheduled to gain independence
 next August.   Such,1a move would
 disrupt the $65,000,000-$70,000-
 000 yearly rice-rubber trade,
 depriving Ceylon of the $10,-
 000,000 annual profit which
 Colombo has come to count on in
 budgetary planning.
 Other Possibilities
 These considerations have
 become sufficiently important
 for Bandaranaike to accept a
 watered-down agreement rather
 than lose the Chinese market.
 His difficulties in seeking al-
 ternative arrangements elsewhere
 would probably create more
 problems than he could solve.
 The USSR has claimed that
 there are mutual advantages in
 increasing Ceylonese-Soviet
 trade, but seems unlikely to re-
 place China in the Ceylonese
 rubber market.   The USSR has
 bought a large part of China's
 purchases from Ceylon, but
 largely to aid China in breaking
 the trade embargo.   Should Mos-
 cow now decide to buy some of
 Ceylon's output, it would prob-
 ably not be willing to pay
 premium prices.

 CURRENT 'INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY:
 There is no promising mar-
 ket in the free world for Cey-
 lonese rubber.                      Since World
 War II, Ceylon has several times
 unsuccessfully attempted to
 sell its rubber output to the
 United States or sought American
 aid equal in value to its rub-
 ber trade with China.   Private
 American buyers have not been
 interested, and the US govern-,
 ment has filled its stockpile
 needs elsewhere.   US financial
 aid to Ceylon has been well be-
 low the $10,000,000 annual rub-
 ber premium from Communist China
 upon which Ceylon has come to
 depend in its budgeting.
 Bandaranaike is already
 faced with the threat of a
 civil disobedience campaign by
 the Tamil-speaking minority
 population of northern Ceylon
 next August.  Communist and
 leftist labor unions may capi-
 talize on this campaign to
 create additional unrest.   Should
 the prime minister in the next
 few months be forced to sign a
 new rice-rubber agreement less,
 favorable to Ceylon than  the
 present one,   his political op-
 ponents would probably raise a
 storm of criticism.   If no agree-
 ment is reached, the consequences
 at home might be politically
 disastrous for Bandaranaike.

 LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNISTS LOOKING TO PEIPING
 Some Latin American Com-
 munist party leaders--particu-
 larly in Ecuador, Chile, Colombia
 and Costa Rica--have recently
 been emphasizing the applica-
 bility of the methods and activ-
 ities of the Chinese Communist
 Party to Latin American condi-
 tions.
 This growing interest of
 Latin American Communists in the
 ideological and propaganda les-
 sons to be learned from Peiping
 has been evidenced both in of-
 ficial publications and in re-
 ported statements at party meet-
 ings.   Illustrative of the in-
 creased attention to the example
 of Communist China was the siz-
 able representation of Latin
 American parties at the eighth
 congress of the Chinese Commu-
 nist Party in Peiping in Septem-
 ber 1956.   Delegations from
 over half the Latin American
 Communist parties attended.
 The USSR's unpalatable ac-
 tions in Hungary a few  weeks
 later probably made'Peiping seem
 a more useful symbol in Commu-
 nist eyes in Latin America as
 elsewhere.   Additional stimulus
 has probably been given by Pei-
 ping's rising prestige among
 Latin Americans general'y.   A
 record number of Latin Americans
 visited Communist China in 1956,
 and the same year saw Peiping's
 first extensive effort in the
 hemisphere.  A Chinese opera
 troupe toured Chile, Argentina,
 Uruguay and Brazil in the late
 summer and fall, while a trade
 mission is now negotiating in
 Uruguay and may visit Argentina
 later.
 Ideological Considerations
 Besides such immediate in-
 fluences, however, there is a
 solid basis in Communist theory
 for this growing interest of
 the Latin American parties. Com-
 munist thinking emphasizes many
 parallels between pre-Communist
 China and Latin America, such
 as economic domination by foreign

 capital, a "semicolonial"
 political status, and the
 existence of indigenous bour-
 geois elements which could be
 used by a Communist party in
 its transformation of the state.
 Thus, though Latin American
 Communists. look to Moscow f or
 leadership, some of them may
 think that China's experience
 can be regarded as more per-
 tinent than the USSR's as a
 general guide to the achieve-
 ment of power and the transi-
 tion to Communism.
 The Soviet 20th party con-
 gress, moreover,  laid down the
 doctrine that the path to power
 and the transition to Communism
 will vary in each country ac-
 cording to local conditions.
 This in effect amounted to a
 Soviet sanction of increased
 attention by Latin American
 Communists to the lessons of
 the Chinese Communist experienxe.
 Ecuador
 The Ecuadoran Communist
 Party (PCE) has already evi-
 denced a clear intent to turn
 toward the Chinese Communist
 Party for a greater degree of
 orientation.  At the national
 party congress in May, dele-
 gates of the PCE reportedly
 praised Communist China rather
 than the USSR as an example
 for world Communism, making
 specific reference to land re-
 form--a socio-economic problem
 in Ecuador which the PCE at-
 tempts to exploit in its do-
 mestic political program.
 Pedro Saad, re-elected secre-
 tary general at the congress,
 was one of two top PCE leaders
 who is believed to have attended
 the Peiping congress and may
 have inspired the laudatory
 discussions on China.
 PCE interest in China is
 being supported by Chinese prop-
 aganda which is apparently en-
 tering the country in sizable
 quantities and is distributed
 by a special outlet in Quito.
 A second outlet reportedly is
 now being established in
 Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest
 city.
 Since last September, the
 outlawed Chilean  Communist
 Party (PCCh) is reported to
 have made increasing use of
 Chinese Communist Party study
 and ideological material in
 PCCh publications.  The PCCh
 magazine Principios devoted an
 entire issue to   a congress
 in Peiping which was attended
 by several top Chilean Commu-
 nists.                                                        The magazine noted par-
 ticularly the similarities be-
 tween pre-Communist China and
 Chile, the Chinese enrichment
 of methods of developing so-
 cialism, and Chinese avoidance
 of Soviet errors.   PCCh propa-
 ganda and the high level of
 Chilean Communist travel to
 China suggest close liaison
 between the two parties and
 possibly strong Chinese ideo-
 logical guidance.
 The secretary general of
 the outlawed Colombian Commu-
 nist Party (PCC), Gilberto
 Vieira, who attended both the
 Soviet 20th party congress in
 Moscow and the Chinese congress
 in Peiping, reportedly dis-
 cussed and praised in detail
 the Chinese Communist interpre-
 tations of the Hungarian revolu-
 tion, de-Stalinization, Stalin's
 historical place in world Com-
 munism, and the relation of na-
 tional parties to the interna-
 tional Communist movement.F
