 Key Judgments   Beijing since the spring of 1983 has begun implementing a basic decision to
 Information available improve relations with the United States. Chinese leaders-who are
 as of 15 June 1984 acutely conscious of China's relative military weakness and absorbed by

 China's ambitious modernization program-want to retain the United
 States as a strategic counterweight to the USSR and gain greater access to
 US technological and economic resources.
 We believe Beijing will subordinate criticism of US policy toward Taiwan
 and other bilateral issues at least through the end of 1984 in order to build
 a more stable, working relationship with the Reagan administration.
 Beijing intends-in our view-to build on the positive atmosphere devel-
 oped during the visits of Premier Zhao and President Reagan and will
 probably work to prevent US-China relations from becoming entangled in
 the US election campaign.
 There are limits to Beijing's ability to expand relations, however. Beijing
 does not want to undermine its ability to manage the Soviet threat through
 negotiations or to pursue expanded ties with the Third World and touchy
 associates, such as North Korea, by identifying too closely with Washing-
 ton. As China does improve relations-especially military relations-with
 the United States, it will take even greater care to preserve the appearance
 of "independence" in its foreign policy.
 During the next six months, we believe China will gradually attempt to
 strengthen security ties with the United States by:
 ? Continuing steps toward the purchase of defensive weapon systems.
 ? Broadening discussions of strategic issues.
 China will continue to press for a greater US role in economic moderniza-
 tion through increased US investment in Chinese enterprises, greater
 access to US technology, and an end to alleged US trade "discrimination"
 against China. As the United States and China broaden their economic
 ties, however, Chinese expectations may exceed the ability of the United
 States to fulfill them. The Chinese may express their disappointment
 publicly. We expect the Chinese to press for US ratification of the Nuclear
 Cooperation Agreement, for instance, and to react-sometimes harshly-
 to Congressional statements doubting Chinese promises on nuclear prolif-
 eration. Nonetheless, we do not believe that the Chinese will risk damage
 to the overall relationship by pursuing the issue too aggressively.

 On Taiwan, China has taken a less aggressive position and, we believe, will
 continue to insist only that the United States adhere to the Joint
 Communiques and accelerated reduction of US arms sales to Taiwan.
 Beijing will nevertheless remain particularly sensitive to signs that Wash-
 ington is improving the quality or quantity of arms sales-directly or
 through third countries-and to remarks by US leaders on policy toward
 Taiwan that China interprets as violating the US commitment to a one-
 China policy. We believe that China will publicly protest any US arms
 sales to Taiwan, though in a relatively low-key manner.
 We believe that internal Chinese political factors will play only a minor
 role in US-China relations in the next six months. Some senior leaders
 apparently do not share Deng Xiaoping's enthusiasm for relations with the
 United States, but we have no evidence of significant opposition.
 Although Chinese leaders will be constrained by the existing strategic
 situation, the death of Deng Xiaoping would probably lead to a period of
 less activity in bilateral relations while a new leadership begins to assert
 itself.
 Over the longer term, a fundamental shift in international pressures on
 China or altered domestic political and economic priorities would almost
 certainly prompt China to review its approach to the United States. Even
 so, we believe that, as long as China remains primarily committed to
 economic modernization and faces an expanding Soviet threat, Beijing's
 need for a security tie to Washington will remain.

 US-China Relations:
 Short-Term Prospects
 After three years of strongly pressing the Reagan
 administration for concessions on Taiwan and other
 matters, Chinese leaders have made a basic decision
 to improve relations with the United States. Beijing
 has elected to subordinate criticism of US policy
 toward Taiwan and other divisive issues in the interest
 of building a more stable, working relationship-
 including improved economic and military ties. For at
 least the short term-through the end of 1984-we
 believe the Chinese intend to build on the positive
 atmosphere developed during the last year and will
 work to prevent US-China relations from becoming
 entangled in the US election campaign.
 Beijing has changed tactics-in our view-primarily
 because it feared that further decline in US-China
 relations would undermine Chinese security and dip-
 lomatic leverage in the face of the continuing Soviet
 military buildup. Chinese leaders are well aware of
 China's relative military weakness and the need for
 time to complete military modernization. They there-
 fore want to retain the United States as a strategic
 counterweight and to cautiously increase military ties.
 China's long-term need for US and Western economic
 and technical assistance provides them with addition-
 al incentives to seek a closer US connection.
 Chinese leaders also believe they established better
 personal relations with President Reagan and key
 members of his administration during the visits of the
 President and Premier Zhao.
 Premier Zhao was particularly pleased
 by the reception he received in Washington-and
 regarded it as a significant indication of the renewed
 importance the administration attaches to relations
 with China. Chinese leaders indicated after the Presi-
 dent's trip in April that they believed it had been a
 success and that the President had reassured them on
 the US position on sensitive issues such as Taiwan.
 the appearance of "independence" in its foreign poli-
 cy. We expect the Chinese to take further steps
 toward the purchase of US military technology and
 weapon systems-following the June 1984 visit of
 Defense Minister Zhang Aiping and during succeed-
 ing visits by military delegations-and to broaden
 their discussions of strategic issues with US policy-
 makers. The Chinese will almost certainly take ad-
 vantage of the visits of senior US military officials,
 such as General Vessey, to do so. Beijing probably
 intends to consult the US increasingly on matters of
 mutual strategic interest-such as arms reduction
 negotiations or Southeast Asia.
 Publicly, we expect that China will underline for
 Moscow its evolving security cooperation with the
 United States but will continue to preserve an air of
 ambiguity about the relationship-in order not to
 precipitate overly hostile Soviet reaction nor to alien-
 ate friends and associates in the Third 'World and
 elsewhere.' While sending Defense Minister Zhang
 Aiping to the United States in June, for example,
 Beijing indicated its intention to send Vice Foreign
 Minister Qian Qichen to Moscow for talks and had
 Premier Zhao publicly express China's support for
 closer ties with Europe
 Chinese leaders have indicated they will continue to
 urge the United States to provide greater long-term
 assistance for their ambitious economic moderniza-
 tion program. Beijing continues to stress its interest in
 increased US investment in Chinese enterprises,
 greater access to advanced US technology, conces-
 sionary financing for joint ventures and industrial
 projects, increased funding from international finan-
 cial organizations in which the United States plays a
 prominent role, and an end to alleged US trade
 ' Beijing also wants to preserve an image of independence in its
 foreign policy-and avoid overly close identification with Washing-
 ton-to further its relations with North Korea, East European
 nations with whom China is seeking closer ties, including Romania,
 Yugoslavia, and East Germany, and the socialist and Communist
 Chinese Expectations

 the United States while striving not to compromise

 "discrimination" against China. During the period in
 question, the Chinese will probably continue to press
 discreetly but persistently for US action on economic
 issues raised during the President's visit, such as
 technology transfer and the amendment of some US
 trade laws. We expect Beijing to also seek US approv-
 al of the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, but we
 believe that it is prepared to wait rather than risk a
 major political controversy over the issue this year.
 On Taiwan, Beijing has retreated to a baseline posi-
 tion that asks for US adherence to the joint communi-
 ques and accelerated reduction of arms sales to
 Taiwan. Beijing will be particularly sensitive to signs
 that the United States is upgrading the quality or
 quantity of arms it sells to Taiwan, and to remarks by
 US leaders on policy toward Taiwan that China
 interprets as violating the US commitment to a one-
 China policy.
 Taiwan has not been a
 fractious issue in i ate~tions recently because
 the United States has not taken actions that require
 Beijing to react.
 China's Concern About Its Strategic Position
 Chinese leaders demonstrated concern in early 1983
 that their "independent" stance in foreign policy
 threatened to jeopardize long-term Chinese security
 and development interests. In the two preceding years,
 angered by perceived US slights over Taiwan and
 encouraged by the increasingly strong US response to
 the Soviets, Beijing had set in abeyance its interest in
 joining the United States in an anti-Soviet "united
 front." Chinese leaders instead strongly pressed the
 United States on bilateral disputes, stressed China's
 fundamental identity with the Third World, and
 revived political consultations with the Soviet Union.
 Beijing was in part exploiting a perceived US need for
 good relations with China, and Chinese leaders
 judged that Beijing's new "independence" would in-
 crease its leverage within the US-China-USSR strate-
 gic triangle.
 We believe, however, that by early 1983 Chinese
 leaders realized they had miscalculated. Talks with
 the Soviets had failed to slow the pace of the Soviet
 drive for military and political dominance in East
 Asia. At the same time, Chinese leaders were met by
 US firmness on bilateral issues and were concerned
 that Washington had downgraded China's strategic
 value. They were worried in particular that growing
 US military ties with Japan, South Korea, and
 ASEAN-without taking Chinese interests into ac-
 count-could leave China strategically isolated
 against the USSR in East Asia. Further, according to
 the Embassy in Beijing, Chinese assessments indicat-
 ed that the President would win reelection and that
 the bilateral relationship could continue to be trou-
 bled well into the Reagan administration's second
 term. Thus, we believe, Chinese leaders began to
 reassess their ties with the United States.
 Increased Chinese concerns since then about the
 growing Soviet military and political threat in East
 Asia have also pushed China closer to the United
 States. A recent series of People's Daily articles, for
 instance, detailed the buildup of the Soviet Pacific
 Fleet, the strengthening of Soviet forces stationed at
 Cam Ranh Bay, and the expanding deployment of
 SS-20 intermediate-range missiles in Siberia.
 In unusually strident language, the Chinese media
 recently accused the Soviet Union of supplying mas-
 sive military and economic aid to Vietnam for "strate-
 gic reasons" and stated that unprecedented Soviet-
 Vietnamese joint naval exercises in the Tonkin Gulf in
 March were aimed at encouraging Vietnamese "ag-
 gression and expansion" against China.
 Chinese leaders have concluded that Moscow's intran-
 sigence over security disputes with China will proba-
 bly continue, despite periodic Sino-Soviet talks. Deng
 Xiaoping told an unofficial US delegation earlier this
 year that the Soviet leadership has entered a long
 transitional period during which Moscow will become
 more "rigid" and even less willing to compromise with
 China
 Chinese officials noted that the Soviets had warned
 the Chinese Government they would cancel the visit
 of First Deputy Premier Arkhipov if the President's
 visit went well                            After
 the cancellation, a Foreign Ministry official com-
 mented that China would not permit the Soviets to

 the growing Soviet threat was
 enough to dampen the leadership's desire for a "rap-
 prochement" with Moscow and to underline its inter-
 est in ties with the United States, which, unlike the
 United States:
 ? To provide an undergirding for bilateral relations
 during times of political stress.
 ? To create leverage within the United States.
 ? To demonstrate tangible benefits from good rela-
 tions with the United States to skeptics in China,
 25X1
 25X1
 USSR, was not a threat to China.
 During the unprecedented exchange of visits over the
 past year, the Chinese gradually indicated an increas-
 ing interest in reviving strategic ties z with the United
 States. During the visit of Secretary of Defense
 Weinberger last September, Chinese leaders began to
 discuss the purchase of US military technology and
 weapon systems. Premier Zhao affirmed China's in-
 terest during his visit to Washington in January and
 later during the President's visit to Beijing in April.
 And Defense Minister Zhang underlined China's
 intent to purchase specific advanced weapon systems
 during his June 1984 visit.
 The Chinese also revived a close, detailed dialogue
 with the United States on Soviet strategy in East Asia
 and globally. During the President's visit, Chinese
 leaders pointed to the Soviet threat to China as one of
 several areas in which US and Chinese strategic
 interests converge. Following the visit, they attempted
 publicly to convey the impression that the United
 States approved Chinese military activity against
 Vietnam. Nonetheless, China continues to criticize
 some US actions in the Third World and Europe that
 it believes permit the Soviets to gain advantage (see
 inset).
 The Importance of Economic Ties
 Chinese leaders regard closer economic ties with the
 United States as vital to the long-term success of
 China's ambitious modernization program. As senior
 policy adviser Huan Xiang indicated last August,
 China wants continued access to what it believes will
 be the world leader in high technology for a long time.
 Chinese leaders also attach broader political signifi-
 cance to building stronger economic ties with the
 ' By strategic ties, we mean a range of relations with the United
 States that directly or indirectly strengthen China's position against
 the Soviet threat. Most concretely, these involve US sale of arms,
 military equipment, and dual-use technology to China's defense
 industries. More broadly, they concern bilateral consultations that
 give China a clearer understanding of the US position toward
 Moscow, allowing Beijing to more effectively adjust its own
 Chinese leaders have ceased for now to elevate eco-
 nomic disputes to a level that would sour overall
 bilateral relations. During the past year, they have
 sought to emphasize the potential for bilateral eco-
 25X1
 25X1
 nomic relations while continuing to press for greater
 US concessions. Minister of Foreign Economic Rela-
 tions and Trade Chen Muhua, for instance, told
 Xinhua news agency in April 1984 that "many obsta-
 cles and difficulties" remain in bilateral economic
 relations. But she also took pains to emphasize the
 considerable development of bilateral trade, US in-
 vestment in Chinese industries, and the removal of
 bureaucratic impediments to further development by
 both countries.
 Chinese leaders have been cautiously optimistic about
 the administration's decision to liberalize technology
 transfer to China. They have publicly hailed the US
 action as a significant step forward in bilateral rela-
 tions, although they complain about continuing im-
 pediments-most notably involving COCOM~
 according to the Embassy in Beijing.
 Deng Xiaoping underlined the political importance of
 US economic concessions when he remarked last
 August that technology transfer is the key to the
 Chinese determination whether China and the United
 States are "good friends" or just "ordinary friends,"

 Beijing began to hint at its desire for better strategic
 ties and the amelioration of bilateral disputes in
 conversations with US officials and other foreign
 visitors in 1983. In May, the Chinese Ambassador to
 the United States tied increased US willingness to
 transfer technology to China to Chinese acceptance of
 current US policy toward Taiwan. Subsequent US
 gestures to China over technology transfer, an-
 nounced during the visit of Commerce Secretary
 Baldridge in late May, opened the way for the
 unprecedented series of high-level visits. During the
 visit of Secretary of Defense Weinberger in Septem-
 ber, the Chinese indicated revived interest in US-
 Chinese military exchanges, dormant for several
 years because of differences over Taiwan.
 A major test of Chinese resolve in seeking closer
 strategic ties came last November. The leadership
 met-sifter two Congressional resolutions appeared
 to call into question US support for a one-China
 policy-to decide whether to cancel the visit of
 Premier Zhao.
 Chinese leaders decided that China must
 improve relations with the United States by sending
 Premier Zhao-in spite of disagreements over
 Taiwan policy. Official guidance later justified the
 decision in general terms by noting that the visit
 would improve China's position in the triangular
 relationship and its overall international influence.
 Chinese treatment of Premier Zhao's January 1984
 visit to Washington and President Reagan's visit to
 Beijing this spring further defined China's growing
 interest in developing cooperation on parallel strate-
 gic matters. In Washington, Zhao told leaders of
 Congress that China could not accept "comprehensive
 strategic cooperation" with the United States but
 indicated a genuine interest in arms purchases from
 the United States. At the same time, Zhao noted the
 "great strategic importance" of US-China relations
 and termed good bilateral relations "an irresistible
 trend of history. "
 In Beijing, despite their censorship of the President's
 remarks on the Soviet Union, the Chinese under-
 scored the Soviet threat to China and points of
 parallel US-China strategic interest. They also tried
 to convey an impression of US approvalfor China's
 escalated military action against Vietnam-including
 an unprecedented naval exercise in the South China
 Sea-in April and May 1984.
 Beijing timed the action to coincide with the Presi-
 dent's visit. The Chinese media highlighted an unusu-
 al separate meeting between Chinese Defense Minis-
 ter Zhang Aiping and military officials in the
 President's party-at which the Chinese privately
 rformed the Americans of Chinese intentions toward
 Vietnam, according to the United States military
 attache. Zhang publicly indicated an interest in a
 carefully calibrated increase in military ties during a
 visit to Washington in June.
 Despite basic agreement on strategic issues, Chinese
 leaders continue to place different emphases-public-
 ly and privately-on policy toward INF, the Third
 World, and other areas. They see the United States
 overplaying its hand to the ultimate benefit of the
 USSR. Chinese leaders now argue, for instance, that
 the United States should attempt to reach an arms

 Secret
 Premier Zhao meanwhile has repeatedly sought to use
 the lure of the China market to build a constituency
 within the US business community and the adminis-
 tration for better relations. Last November, for exam-
 ple, Zhao extolled the merits of greater US invest-
 ment in Chinese industry to US governors but
 lamented that expanded trade would not be possible
 until the US removed various obstacles. In the same
 vein, while expressing a desire to purchase US equip-
 ment, Chinese officials have told US nuclear industry
 executives that China would have to turn to Europe if
 the United States was unable to secure ratification of
 the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement this year.
 Chinese leaders have also explicitly linked US inten-
 tions to improve political relations with China to
 better opportunities for US businessmen to trade with
 China. Zhao underlined this point while in the United
 Taiwan
 US policy toward Taiwan remains the most conten-
 tious issue and is the one issue on which the bilateral
 relationship would be most likely to falter during the
 rest of this year. Nonetheless, we believe that Beijing
 is willing to set aside its more extreme demands on
 Taiwan for better relations with Washington-at
 least through the November elections. Beijing will
 probably claim for domestic consumption that its
 posture is justified by significant US concessions.
 Beijing's public treatment of US policy toward
 Taiwan last year was laced with accusations that the
 United States favored a "one-China, one-Taiwan"
 policy and continued to violate the August 1982 joint
 communique. Chinese commentary during this period,
 however, also included calls for strengthening
 "mutual trust" and improving relations. And Chinese
 officials-such as the Ambassador in Washington last
 May-sometimes hinted that Beijing would be willing
 to lessen its criticism of US policy toward Taiwan if
 the United States were to strengthen relations in other
 areas.
 Since the exchange of visits between Premier Zhao
 and President Reagan, Beijing's public treatment of
 US-Taiwan policy has changed markedly. Recent
 authoritative media commentary has not emphasized
 past demands, threats, or sharp accusations that the
 United States is not fulfilling the joint communiques.
 Indeed, the recent comment by a Foreign Ministry
 spokesman that the United States had violated the
 quality stipulation of the joint communique by selling
 C-130 aircraft to Taiwan was mild. Instead, Chinese
 leaders for the first time have publicly accepted US
 claims that the United States is reducing arms sales to
 Taiwan and have urged that the pace of reduction be
 accelerated. They have not called upon the President
 to seek the recision of the Taiwan Relations Act-as
 they did in the past-but ask simply that it be
 managed in a low-key way that least harms Chinese
 interests
 Privately, Chinese leaders have acknowledged since
 early this year that they believe that the "basic
 orientation" of US-China relations is set and that
 further US concessions on its policy toward Taiwan
 realized that the United States would riot abandon the
 idea of "one-China, one-Taiwan"-no matter who sits
 in the White House                   China      25X1
 understands the United States believes that it must
 continue to supply arms to Taiwan.                ~ 25X1
 Meanwhile Beijing has launched an invigorated effort
 to convince Taiwan-and overseas Chinese-that its
 reunification proposals are reasonable. While in the
 United States, Premier Zhao appealed to Chinese-
 American audiences in San Francisco and New York
 to accept Beijing's efforts toward Taiwan. Beijing has
 publicly urged Washington not to "interfere" in the
 process (through stepped-up arms sales, for example)
 though it has not pressed for US support.

 Other Political Issues
 With the exception of US policy toward Taiwan, the
 Chinese have shown greatest sensitivity about their
 status in the bilateral relationship. Zhao Ziyang told
 the US delegation in February that China resented
 the alleged US treatment of it as a "junior partner" in
 bilateral relations and likened some US actions with
 those of the Soviets toward China during the 1950s.
 The Chinese indicated during President Reagan's trip
 that the President had alleviated their concerns on
 this score. On the President's last full day in Beijing,
 for instance, Premier Zhao expressed his appreciation
 at the "spirit of mutual respect and mutual benefit"
 that the President "repeatedly emphasized" while in
 China.
 Nonetheless, despite US assurances, the Chinese con-
 tinue to cling to residual fears that the United States
 will use improved bilateral relations to China's disad-
 vanta e.
 China had censored the President's remarks in
 Beijing on the Soviet Union because China did not
 want to be "used" against the Soviets. And some
 Chinese officials have suggested that the administra-
 tion was improving relations, including military sales
 to China, partly to reduce Chinese complaints about
 the sale of weapons to Taiwan.
 Chinese Domestic Politics
 We believe that internal Chinese political factors will
 play a relatively small role in US-China relations over
 the course of the next six months. Beijing's decision to
 improve its relations with the United States was based
 primarily, we believe, on its assessment of China's
 strategic and development needs. Unlike domestic
 policy, China's foreign policy is formulated by a small
 group of senior leaders and is not usually debated
 beyond the Politburo. China's current policy toward
 the United States reflects the views of Deng Xiao-
 ping-China's dominant leader and primary strategic
 thinker. Most other leaders appear to support it,
 though there may be some disagreement over the pace
 of development of the relationship. We have no ?
 evidence to suggest that particular groups in the
 leadership have vigorously opposed it.
 Domestic political arguments, however, could affect
 the tone of Chinese foreign policy statements or
 inflame ongoing bilateral disputes. A People's Daily
 commentary during the height of the spiritual pollu-
 tion campaign last fall, for instance, contained some
 strident anti-American overtones. The antiforeign ele-
 ment of the campaign was short lived and was
 thoroughly discredited by the leadership, however.
 Although Hu Yaobang's remarks threatening the
 cancellation of Premier Zhao's trip to the United
 States were made at the height of the campaign, there
 is no evidence that domestic political considerations
 were behind Hu's comments.
 The strongest supporters of relations with the United
 States, with the exception of Deng himself, are repre-
 sented most prominently by Premier Zhao and those
 most deeply involved in the management of China's
 modernization program. Senior officers of the Army's
 General Staff Department and Defense Minister
 Zhang Aiping also appear to be strong supporters of
 improved US-China relations, especially the strategic
 and defense elements. In fact, on the eve of the
 President's trip to China, Zhang publicly identified
 himself with emerging US-China defense coopera-
 tion-which he dated to the visit of Secretary of
 Defense Weinberger.
 Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang has not clearly
 articulated his views on relations with the United
 States and probably is still content to follow Deng's
 lead on foreign policy. Hu is now becoming personally
 identified with China's strategic opening to the West,
 especially Japan, however, and is beginning to play a
 greater role in US-China relations. Although Hu has
 expressed some ambivalence about the United States
 in the past and was the chief articulator of China's
 "independent" foreign policy line, he has increasingly
 lent his support to the strategic aspects of bilateral
 relations. He recently told Japanese reporters that he
 supports Chinese efforts to buy United States military
 technology

 members Chen Yun and Li Xiannian-who have been

 other aspects of relations with the United States over

 initiatives. Li Xiannian told the President in April
 that China supports US policy in East Asia and, at
 the end of the visit, publicly pronounced it a "suc-
 Ministry officials dispute the accuracy of US figures,
 the quality or quantity of US weapons sold to
 Taiwan-either directly or through third countries.
 Although China has formally accepted the US posi-
 tion that it is reducing arms sales to Taiwan in accord
 with the August 1982 communique, some Foreign
 Beijing
 The occasional opposition of some senior Army and
 party conservative leaders, like Chen Yun, to relations
 with the United States stems primarily from their
 concern with the byproducts of the opening to the
 West. These leaders worry about the infatuation of
 Chinese youth with Western ideas and material goods
 and the consequent deleterious impact on public order
 and revolutionary purity. Some of them, such as
 Politburo member Wei Guoqing, have lost key posi-
 tions from which they could have rallied support
 against the open-door policy, however.
 Continuing Irritants
 We believe that China will carefully nurture the
 positive momentum in US-China relations for the rest
 of this year and will take special care to preserve the
 strategic basis of its relations with the United States.
 Chinese leaders will try to confine unanticipated
 disputes over bilateral issues and to deal with them in
 a way that will not sour relations as a whole. Nonethe-
 less, there remains a distinct but low-level chance that
 accumulated friction over US policy on such sensitive
 issues as Taiwan, Chinese nuclear proliferation policy,
 or Korea could raise bilateral tensions substantially.
 The Chinese remain extraordinarily sensitive to per-
 ceived shifts in US policy toward Taiwan. They will
 probably react strongly to public statements that
 appear to question the US commitment to a one-
 China policy, to support Taiwan's independence in
 any form, or, to a lesser extent, to reaffirm the role of
 the Taiwan Relations Act in the formation of US-
 China policy. The Chinese will probably respond more
 temperately to Congressional statements on these
 issues-unless the administration is seen as not oppos-
 ing them vigorously.
 Similarly, the Chinese would probably react to com-
 pelling evidence that the United States is increasing
 would probably be quick to seize upon indications that
 the United States has violated China's interpretation
 of the August communique-as it did :recently with
 the sale of the C-130 aircraft to Taiwan. The severity
 of China's reaction would probably be directly related
 to the extent of US actions and the publicity they
 receive.
 Chinese leaders appear to be concerned that the
 Korean Peninsula could become an issue in US-China
 bilateral relations as well. Chinese officials have
 indicated privately that China has little leverage with
 the North Koreans and worry that instability on the
 peninsula could lead to Soviet inroads and an unwant-
 ed US-Chinese confrontation there. The Chinese are
 especially concerned that North Korean leader Kim
 11-song could strike agreements with the Soviets lead-
 ing to greater Soviet involvement on the peninsula-
 and more intense pressures on the Chinese to woo the
 North. In this case, China would probably feel con-
 strained to adopt a more publicly anti-US position on
 Korea, including stronger calls for withdrawal of US
 troops from South Korea or greater insistence that the
 United States participate in tripartite talks on Korean
 reunification.
 statements.
 The Chinese appear to have had high expectations
 that the United States would soon ratify the Nuclear
 Cooperation Agreement that was initialed in Beijing
 last May. Nonetheless, China remains very sensitive
 about disclosures-in the media or before Congress-
 that it may have transferred nuclear technologies to
 other countries. Should the administration be buffeted
 by strong Congressional or other criticism of China's
 nuclear proliferation policy, China may react defen-
 sively. We believe, however, that Chinese leaders will
 want to limit damage done by debate over China's
 nuclear policy-though they may express their asper-
 ity over it to US officials privately or through public

 .Wa.I ca
 Other possible economic irritants include:
 ? Technology Transfer: The Chinese are pressing the
 United States to remove China from COCOM
 restrictions, or, at a minimum, to remove additional
 COCOM restrictions from sensitive US technol-
 ogies-such as fiber optics communication technol-
 ogy. China hopes to sign a Telecommunications
 Protocol with the United States in the fall that
 incorporates some of these wishes. If that effort
 fails, Beijing probably will moderately protest US
 reluctance to accommodate Chinese interests.
 ? Textiles: The Chinese are pressing the United
 States to allow greater imports of textiles and have
 expressed resentment of the administration's "un-
 reasonable" restrictions. If restrictions on Chinese
 textiles go up markedly this year, China would
 certainly protest-though probably also at a low
 level.
 Although Deng Xiaoping appears to be in good
 health, his death could also have a significant impact
 on US-China relations in the near term. If Deng
 Xiaoping dies within the next six months, an interim
 leadership-probably led by Party General Secretary
 Hu Yaobang-would most likely be absorbed by
 efforts to construct a new leadership and would not be
 in a position to implement initiatives in foreign af-
 fairs. Although a new leadership would continue to be
 bound by the existing strategic imperatives, it might
 feel constrained to adopt a more nationalistic posture
 or to place greater stress on China's foreign policy
 "independence.'
