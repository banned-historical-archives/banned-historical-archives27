 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 June 1958
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 SOVIET SUMMIT TACTICS
 The Soviet aide-memoire of
 25 June reflects a major shift
 in Moscow's recent tactics for
 handling technical test inspec-
 tion talks at Geneva.                       It may
 also mark an abrupt and sub-
 stantial change in over-all pol-
 icy toward the West and signal
 the abandonment of negotiations
 on inspection and possibly the
 resumption of Soviet nuclear
 tests.   This is in sharp con-
 trast with recent Soviet prop-
 aganda and diplomatic efforts
 to show that the USSR was still
 interested in a summit confer-
 ence.
 The aide-memoire is contrary
 to that of the previous day,
 which had indicated Soviet agree-
 ment to the Geneva talks and had
 expressed the moderate hope that
 the conference "should aid in
 the most rapid cessation" of nu-
 clear tests.   The 24 June aide-
 memoire may have been prepared
 by the Foreign Ministry as a
 routine matter without clearance
 at those levels of government
 where the decision for a change
 was being prepared.   A factor
 in the Soviet shift may have
 been an American memorandum de-
 livered on 24 June,, outlining
 briefly for the first time the
 scope of issues that should be
 discussed by the experts.
 On the tactical level, the
 new aide-memoire can be viewed
 as a bold maneuver to force the
 United States to agree in prin-
 ciple to a test cessation inde-
 pendent of other aspects of the
 disarmament problem.   The 13
 June aide-memoire and subsequent
 propaganda indicated that the
 USSR desired such a commitment,
 oire appeared to confirm the im-
 pression that Moscow would not
 insist on it.
 Now Moscow seems to be seek-
 ing American agreement to a def-
 inition, of the Geneva meeting's
 purpose that would establish a
 clear link between technical
 talks and the "ultimate end" of
 a test cessation agreement.   Mos-
 cow now insists it had agreed
 to talks only on the assumption
 that the United States accepted
 this principle, although in fact
 the American insistence that
 there was no commitment to sus-
 pend tests had been repeatedly
 made clear in notes to Moscow.
 The USSR may think that, by fol-
 lowing these tactics, it can
 force Western agreement to a
 test suspension without any in-
 spection system.
 This latest Soviet move may
 indicate a more fundamental
 change in Soviet policy and be
 intended to prepare the ground
 for an abandonment of all pre-
 tense of interest in negotiating
 a test cessation and may signal
 eventual resumption of the Soviet
 nuclear test program.   Such a
 radical turn in  the Soviet
 Union's stand might well spring
 from a major shift in the bal-
 ance of forces within the Soviet
 leadership or at least a funda-
 mental reassessment of over-all
 Soviet policy in the light of
 recent Eastern European develop-
 tnents.
 If Moscow is abandoning its
 efforts to gain a general test
 suspension,  perhaps in the belief
 that it would have to pay too
 high a price in terms of inspec-

 reason for it to seek a summit
 conference.   The primary purpose
 of a summit meeting, from the
 Soviet viewpoint, has been the
 ratification of an agreement on
 test suspension.   In any case,
 Moscow must realize that  its
 latest move will greatly reduce
 the prospects for a summit con-
 ference because it will be taken
 by the West as clear proof that
 the USSR  is unwilling to make
 any substantive compromise to
 solve outstanding  East-West
 problems.
 Nevertheless, Soviet prop-
 aganda prior to 25 June empha-
 sized Moscow's continuing desire
 for a summit meeting and blamed
 the West for using the Hungarian
 events as a pretext to bar a
 conference.
 The demonstrations against
 the  American,  West  German,
 and  Danish embassies  in  Mos-
 cow, while obviously reflect-
 ing Moscow's anger                                                        at      the
 strength  and violence  of re-
 action  in  Western  countries
 to  the  Hungarian executions,
 appeared  to  be  seriously at
 odds with  the  USSR's  pose
 as  the champion  of peaceful
 coexistence and   negotiations.
 The nonviolent  nature  of the
 demonstrations  outside the
 American   Embassy  may, how-
 ever,   indicate                                                            a   desire
 not  to  raise  unnecessary
 obstacles  to  negotiations
 with  the  United   States.
 LEBANESE SITUATION
 UN Secretary General Ham-
 marskj old may have reached an
 agreement with UAR President
 Nasir to bring at least a tem-
 porary halt to UAR support for
 the Lebanese rebels.   It seems
 almost certain that he held
 out some positive inducement to
 the Egyptian leader.   The nature
 of this inducement is not yet
 known, but Nasir is said to be
 waiting "with interest" a fur-
 ther proposal from Hammarskjold.
 The Lebanese Government re-
 mains very wary.   It seems pos-
 sible that the rebels,may make
 another military effort to im-
 press the government and foreign
 observers with their strength.
 Certainly Lebanese army commander
 Shihab, who recently has become
 even more reluctant to engage
 the rebels in decisive action,
 will regard any agreement as a
 reason to hold firmly to his
 policy of taking  no  real

 clash.    This  may ref lect a
 Kremlin   feeling  that  events
 in  Lebanon  are   developing
 favorably  for  Soviet   in-
 terests.
 If the  Soviet  leaders
 are  convinced        that  the
 likelihood  of  Western  mili-
 tary  intervention  has passed
 or  diminished, Moscow  may
 step up  its  diplomatic  and
 propaganda  attention  to
 Lebanon, and  attempt  to
 claim credit  in  the  Arab
 world    for protecting the
 Middle  East  from  Western
 "aggression."
 INCREASED SOVIET PRESSURE ON POLAND LIKELY
 The       Gomulka  experiment
 in  Poland  is  the  major
 obstacle  to  restoration of
 complete  Soviet   domination
 over  bloc  policies,  and
 Moscow  will  probably  now
 increase  its efforts   to
 bring   Gomulka  into line. Al-
 though                     Moscow can  apply
 economic  pressures and mili-
 tary  f orce               if    Gomulka  does
 not  ultimately  support  the
 bloc  positions  on  Tito  and
 Nagy,  it  is  more likely to
 try     through  political  ac-
 tion            to  unseat           Gomulka in
 favor  of  more  acceptable
 leaders, possibly  a   Stalin-
 ist-conservative                                 coalition.
 Former   Polish    leaders  most
 hated  by  the  population
 would  probably  be  relegated
 to  behind-the-scenes positions.
 The Hungarian executions
 are a clear warning to all sat-
 ellites that revisionism will
 no  longer  be  tolerated  in
 the bloc.    They  must  be
 so  interpreted  by  Gomulka,
 whose  brand  of  Communism
 embraces many   of  the  prin-
 ciples  for                                                                which  Imre Nagy
 was    killed. Despite  this,
 neither  Gomulka  nor   the Pol-
 ish                                                               press has  made  any
 comment on   the  executions,
 although          the other satel-
 lites                                                                have been quick to
 endorse the  punishment  of
 Nagy.   The  Polish central
 committee  apparently  sent a
 letter  of   guidance;  to pro-
 vincial   party  committees in-
 dicating                                                                  disapproval  of the
 Hungarian  executions and
 stating that  they   should
 be  treated  without    comment
 as a Hungarian internal matter.
 Pessimism is mounting in
 Warsaw as to whether the studied
 detachment can  be  maintained,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 the capital of a Soviet emissary
 are symptomatic of Polish fears
 of an imminent crisis with the
 USSR.   Nonetheless, Gomulka ap-
 pears determined to uphold his
 principles.   His independent
 stand vis-a-vis Moscow on the
 Yugoslav dispute and other is-
 sues is largely responsible for
 his popularity.
 Gomulka cannot, however,
 count on the undivided backing
 of his party, which is still
 badly  torn  by factionalism.
 Conservative and opportunistic
 members of the central commit-
 tee, if persuaded that Gomulka's
 control was weakening and that
 popular uprisings  could  be
 avoided, would probably form a
 coalition with the Polish Sta-
 linists who have consistently
 opposed the Polish leader.   It
 is the knowledge that Gomulka
 is the sole Communist acceptable
 to  the  masses,   and therefore
 the  sole means of maintaining
 party rule in Poland,   that has
 heretofore ensured him the votes
 of a considerable section of
 the central committee.
 In the face of obvious So-
 viet intervention, it is likely
 that the forces which rallied
 to his support in October 1956
 would do so again, and for the
 same reasons.   The Soviet Union,
 in deciding how to bring Gomulka
 into line, must consider the pos-
 sibility that unrest might de-
 velop in Poland if strong pres-
 sure is brought to bear on him.
 Having  before it the  example
 of Hungary and an unstable situa-
 tion  in                                                              East  Germany,   Moscow
 would also have to estimate the
 extent to  which its  broader
 world policies would suffer if
 armed intervention were used to
 suppress the popular riots that
 would  occur  if  Gomulka were
 summarily ousted.
 Under these circumstances,
 the Soviet Union is likely to
 regard a policy of gradual sub-
 version of the Polish  party,
 which would lead to a "legiti-
 mate"  overthrow  of  Gomulka,
 as the most  feasible course
 if Gomulka persists in refusing
 to endorse the bloc  line on
 Tito and Nagy.
 GREEK-TURKISH TENSION OVER CYPRUS
 Greek belief that Ankara
 instigated the recent rioting
 on Cyprus has intensified deep-
 rooted antagonisms against Tur-
 key.               Greek Air Force officers
 are openly discussing possible
 operations against Turkish tar-
 gets, and Greek Air Force fight-
 ers are on a partial  alert
 status. A large cross section
 of the Greek population, in-
 cluding many junior officers
 in the armed services, would
 welcome military action against
 Turkey for what are regarded as
 repeated provocative acts by
 the Turks.  It is doubtful, how-
 ever,  that Greece would initiate
 hostilities against  Turkey,
 barring large-scale attacks
 against Greek minorities in
 Istanbul and Izmir.
 Gkb6k ?oreign Minister
 Averoff has recently emphasized
 Greece's strong ties with Yugo-
 slavia, but has announced that
 Greek-Turkish cooperation within
 the Balkan pact or NATO is no
 longer possible.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 June 1958
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 AFTERMATH OF THE EXECUTION OF NAGY
 Hungarian party leader
 Janos Kadar may now be losing
 his usefulness to Moscow be-
 cause of his close association
 with Imre Nagy during the revo-
 lution and his specific endorse-
 ment of Nagy policies which are
 now condemned as treasonous.
 The fact that the two 'initial
 authoritative Hungarian state-
 ments on Nagy's execution were
 made by the reported leaders of
 the Stalinist opposition to
 Radar supports this speculation
 and suggests that he may be los-
 ing control of the party.   It
 is believed in political and
 journalistic circles in Buda-
 pest that Kadar had opposed this
 drastic solution of the Nagy
 affair.   If so, he will probably
 be removed.   It is also possi-
 ble, however, that the manifest
 effort of Kadar to hold aloof
 from the execution may be a
 face-saving maneuver.   Moscow's
 action may be governed by the
 apparent lack of a suitable suc-
 cessor.
 In Budapest, although no
 overt demonstrations have been
 reported and police precautions
 are reportedly stringent, gov-
 ernment employees are reported
 to have stopped work in protest.
 According to the American Lega-
 tion,  "rage and despair at their
 own helplessness" are the pre-
 vailing emotions.   In this at-
 mosphere, the Supreme Court has
 pressed ahead with hearings on
 political offenders.   The re-
 gime has not yet revealed the
 fate of other individuals ac-
 cused with Nagy.
 The Yugoslavs are not mak-
 ing matters any easier for
 Kadar.   In a note delivered to
 Budapest on 23 June,  Belgrade
 accused the  Hungarians  of
 treachery and quoted   Kadar's
 assurances that Nagy would not
 be punished.
 Most of the bloc has con-
 tinued to thunder denunciations
 of Nagy,  "revisionism," and
 Yugoslavia, with Communist China,
 the USSR, Bulgaria, and Albania
 taking the lead.   Rumania, while
 headlining the "sentiments of
 approval and satisfaction" with
 which the Rumanian people al-
 legedly greeted the news of
 Nagy's death, has been somewhat
 less severe in its condemnation
 of Yugoslavia--perhaps because
 of its own involvement in the
 Nagy case.   The Rumanian foreign
 minister had assured the UN
 General Assembly on 3 December
 1956 that his government "would
 observe the international rules
 relating to political asylum"
 in providing refuge for Nagy
 and his companions.
 Moscow's reversion to
 Stalinist procedures has had a
 strong impact on neutralist na-
 tions, especially India, where
 Nehru declared,Nagy's execution
 was "most distressing news both
 in itself and in its possible
 consequences."  In Austria--so
 closely involved in the 1956
 revolt--the executions appear
 to have had an extraordinary
 impact on public and official
 opinion, and probat1y will kill
 plans. for negotiations for im-
 provement of Austro-Hungarian
 relations.
 In Ceylon, the government
 reportedly has authorized its
 UN representative to vote con-
 demnation of the executions in
 the UN special committee, if
 he feels it is warranted.   The
 ambassador of the United Arab
 Republic in Budapest informed
 American officials confiden-
 tially that,  although  his

 instructions were to preserve
 neutrality, he and his govern-
 ment were "profoundly shocked"
 at the executions.
 Elsewhere in the free world,
 the sense of shock has been pro-
 found and the Kremlin's action
 has been branded "needless folly."
 Fellow travelers and some left-
 wing parties have been estranged
 by Moscow's actions, and some
 Western Communist parties, no-
 tably the British, appear to be
 undergoing conflicts of loyalty
 similar to those experienced fol-
 lowing the Hungarian revolt in
 November 1956.
 SOVIET CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING
 The communiqud issued by
 the Soviet Communist party cen-
 tral committee after its meeting
 of 17-18 June represents  on the
 surface at least, another gain
 for Khrushchev.   He has added
 two of his proteges as candidate
 members of the presidium and has
 pushed through a decree which
 advances his agricultural poli-
 cies by abolishing the present
 system of compulsory deliveries
 of collective-farm produce to
 the state.
 It is not likely that the
 committee, and especially its
 members serving in foreign capi-
 tals, would have been called
 suddenly into session for the
 second time in six weeks to ap-
 prove these measures alone. So-
 viet leaders are faced with a
 number of pressing problems, and
 both sessions met in an atmos-
 phere of continuing rumors of
 opposition to Khrushchev. Both
 sessions, however, lasted only
 two days, and allegedly passed
 only economic resolutions on
 the chemical industry and agri-
 culture.   These resolutions,
 although important in themselves,
 may have been part of a politi-
 cal maneuver in which KhrushcheM
 having achieved agreement on
 specific issues, turned them
 into a vote of confidence for
 himself and his policies.
 It is now virtually cer-
 tain that'relations with Yugo-
 slavia were discussed at the
 May plenum.   Similarly, ques-
 tions of bloc unity, particular-
 ly the implications of Nagy's
 execution, must have weighed
 heavily in the decision to con-
 voke the June session.   Foreign
 policy issues dealing with the
 summit or the Middle East may
 also have been touched on at
 the plenum or taken up later in
 special conferences.   This may
 also have been the case with
 the new seven-year plan, a draft
 of which has been scheduled to
 be ready by 1 July.
 The addition of two new
 candidate members, N. V. Pod-
 gorny and D. S. Polyansky, to
 the party presidium--the only
 personnel changes announced--
 brings the membership to 15 full
 and 10 candidate members. Both
 Polyansky and Podgorny  were

 elected full members of the par-
 ty central committee for the
 first time at the 20th party
 congress in 1956, both have had
 extensive experience in key
 agricultural areas, and both
 have come into prominence since
 Khrushchev became party first
 secretary in 1953.
 The decision to establish
 a single system for procuring
 agricultural products of the
 collective farms, hitherto ac-
 quired under three different
 programs, will facilitate plan-
 ning and profit calculations in
 Soviet agriculture, and is an-
 other important step in reducing
 the differences between state
 and collective farms.   Beginning
 with the 1958 crop, the state
 will have one procurement pro-
 gram for collective farm output,
 instead of obtaining it partly
 by compulsory procurement at
 very low prices, partly as pay-
 ments in kind for the services
 of the MTS, and partly by over-
 quota purchases at prices con-
 siderably higher than the com-
 pulsory procurement prices. The
 new state purchase price will
 vary from  region to region de-
 pending on the cost of produc-
 tion and from year to year de-
 pending on the size of the har-
 vest.   The free market apparent-
 ly  will remain as an outlet
 for  some  collective-farm prod-
 uce..
 A change in the agricultur-
 al procurement system applicable
 to collective farms was made-
 necessary by the reorganization
 of the machine tractor stations
 (MTS) which virtually eliminated
 payments in kind for the services
 of the MTS as an important source
 of agricultural produce to the
 state.   The abolition of the
 present system of compulsory-de-
 liveries probably does not mean
 that future sales of agricultur-
 al produce by the collective
 farms to the state will be vol-
 untary.   Plans for the procure-
 ment of agricultural produce by
 the state are to be drawn up for
 republics, krais, oblasts, col-
 lective farms, and state farms.
 The decision states that the
 procurement system must guaran-
 tee delivery to the state of the
 necessary amounts of agricultur-
 al produce.
 The collective farms' mone-
 tary income probably will in-
 crease  inasmuch  as they are
 now able to sell to the govern-
 ment produce which was formerly
 delivered to the MTS in payment
 for services.   However, this
 probable increase in income will
 be partially or wholly offset
 by increased expenditures en-
 tailed in the purchase, mainte-
 nance, and operation of the farm
 machinery acquired from the MTS
 by the collective farms.
 The decision does state
 that a further increase in the
 income of collective farms must
 be based on a sharp increase in
 the volume of marketable prod-
 uce` and on a reduction in costs.
 This increase, it  is  hoped,
 will permit a  lowering of
 procurement prices,  which
 would  in  turn   enable  the
 state  to lower  retail prices.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 June 1958
 HARVEST PROSPECTS POOR IN SATELLITES
 Bad weather during the
 past winter and early spring
 will probably preclude fulfill-
 ment in Eastern Europe of 1958
 crop goals, especially for
 small grains, and reduce bread-
 grain supplies in the southern
 satellites, which were hit hard-
 est.   Government reserves of
 bread grains will have to be
 drawn on throughout the satel-
 lites for an additional four
 to six weeks unless strict con-
 trols of bread and flour are
 imposed in urban areas.   The
 Soviet Union will probably a-
 gain be obliged to deliver ad-
 ditional quantities of grain
 on credit to Eastern Europe
 this winter.   Barring further
 bad weather, a near-average
 crop of corn, sunflower, and
 root plants is still a possi-
 bility, as is an average sup-
 ply of feed for livestock.
 A cold, wet spring retard-
 ed growth of autumn-sown grains
 and delayed spring planting by
 an estimated three to six weeks
 in the northern satellites and
 Hungary, and by about five
 weeks in Albania, Bulgaria, and
 Rumania.   In the southern sat-
 ellites and Slovakia, unfavor-
 able weather was followed by
 subnormal precipitation and as
 a result, yields of autumn-
 sown grains are expected to be
 somewhat below the average for.the
 last five years.   In East Ger-
 many, Poland, and western
 Czechoslovakia, yields should
 exceed this average and may
 approximate the 1957 level.
 Near-drought conditions
 existed by the first week of
 June in the southern satellites
 and Slovakia.    At the present
 time, despite the onset of
 rain, spring-sown grains in
 these areas have probably suf-
 fered damage sufficient to re-
 sult in less-than-average yield
 per acre, and only with ideal
 distribution and supply of
 moisture can the southern sat-
 ellites now hope for a harvest
 only slightly below average.
 A sizable portion of spring-
 sown grains in the southern sat-
 ellites is expected to be cut
 for hay rather than grain, thus
 compensating for small yields
 in nongrain fodder crops, which
 so far are considerably below
 the 1957 level.   Since pastures
 suffer earlier and to a greater
 extent than do most crops, how-
 ever, continued unfavorable
 weather could cut still further
 into the supply of feed for
 livestock.   Production of feed
 for livestock in the northern
 satellites may approach the
 1957 level.
 Because they are in an
 early stage of growth through-
 out the satellites, corn, sugar
 beets, potatoes, and sunflower
 may suffer less from bad weath-
 er, if precipitation in the lat-
 ter half of June is more nearly
 normal.   Because of the hot, dry
 weather, however, the danger
 from insects has increased.
 Certain regions of Hungary and
 Rumania already report larger
 numbers of potato beetles, and
 insects injurious to other crops
 as well seem to have multiplied
 in the southern satellites.   In
 Bulgaria, too, peasants are
 being exhorted to battle the
 pest menace.
 The food situation for the
 southern satellites in the 1958-
 59 consumption year is thus to
 be less bright than during 1957-
 58,even though good harvests
 permitted the governments last
 year to accumulate large stores.
 A further rise in per capita
 intake is unlikely in the south-
 ern satellites, since bread re-
 mains the main food staple in
 these countries and supplies of
 high-quality foods such as meat
 and dairy products should in no
 case surpass normal.

 and payment terms on trade with
 Poland are being eased.
 An agreement to supply the

 it can move from its position

 of foreign credits Poland has
 begun to shift a larger share
 of its trade to the West.   So-

 respectively to 31 percent and
 60 percent in 1957.

 to obtain new aid probably re-
 sults from a desire to ensure a
 continued influx of foreign cur-
 rency and to ensure Western par-

 curtailing industrial growth.
 Poland also is planning to

 THE CZECHOSLOVAK PARTY CONGRESS
 A  full-scale  campaign
 against the remnants of "bour-
 geois ideology" and the "revi-
 sionist heresies" that Yugo-
 slavia exemplifies was launched
 at the 11th Czech party congress
 which concluded on 21 June.   The
 condemnation of the Yugoslavs
 by party First Secretary Novot-
 ny, only slightly less vitriolic
 than that: of Premier Siroky,
 promises continued public de-
 bate of these issues.   The con-
 gress endorsed the Soviet line
 that the 1948 Cominform resolu-
 tion was essentially correct.
 The elimination of "bour-
 geois ideology" at home was
 declared to be of "overriding
 importance" in order to enable
 Czechoslovakia to become the
 second country to "achieve so-
 cialism"--a status reached by
 the Soviet Union in 1936.   Se-
 curity forces are to be strength-

 "class  -enemies"  are  to  be
 stepped up.   The Justice Minis-

 also to be strengthened, and a
 full-scale vigilance campaign,
 often a sign of internal inse-
 curity, has been launched.

 toward full "socialization" in
 the agricultural, industrial,
 and governmental fields and set
 goals for the rapid conclusion of

 two years.   Agriculture is now
 71.5 percent socialized.
 The present economic re-
 organization, while ostensibly
 intended to grant the masses a
 greater voice in production,
 is actually designed to reduce
 costs.   Under it some 9,50C
 functionaries have already
 been eliminated from central
 government organs and another
 30,000 functionaries in in-
 dustrial administration will
 be affected, according to
 Novotny.   Although the regime
 promised to increase living
 standards through price cuts,
 a contemplated wage revision
 for 1,800,000 industrial workers
 could have an adverse effect
 on morale if work norms are
 raised out of proportion to
 wage increases.
 The USSR, in a 17 June
 Moscow broadcast, granted its
 blessing to the "achievement
 of socialism" by Czechoslovakia
 ahead of the other satellites.
 After declaring that only the
 Soviet Union had thus far a-

 Czechoslovakia had won this
 honor over its nearest competitor,
 Bulgaria, in order to show that
 Communism can succeed in an in-

 as well as in a "backward" nation.
 The congress ostentatiously
 spoke of solidarity with the

 EAST GERMANY INCREASING
 Government action in re-

 dissatisfaction of the East
 German people with the regime.
 Growing resentment is evidenced

 attitude among workers, farmers,

 Increasingly stringent security

 strations,  but an eruption of
 unrest in Poland might spread
 to East Germany despite these
 precautions.
 Major factors contributing
 to the growth of discontent
 have been the pressure on the
 workers to increase their out-
 put for little if any reward
 and the intensified drive to
 force private farmers and crafts-
 men into state-dominated co-

 party functionaries,  spreading
 "work slow" mottoes,  advocating
 the liquidation of the Communist
 dictatorship, and opposing serv-
 ice  in the auxiliary factory
 militia.
 Private farmers are es-
 pecially bitter over the dis-
 crimination shown against them
 in the allocation of seed and
 fertilizer and the services of
 the machine tractor stations
 and over the constant harass-
 ment by party and government
 functionaries.   Farmers are
 using every conceivable pretext
 to justify their refusal to
 join the "socialized sector"
 of agriculture.
 The discrimination shown
 against independent craftsmen
 has resulted in a steep drop
 in income for many of them,
 forcing some into bankruptcy,
 and leaving them little choice
 but to join the production co-
 operatives.
 The fixing of higher
 prices for food following the
 derationing decree of 1 May
 has also contributed to the un-
 rest.   The decree itself has
 been followed by additional
 travel restrictions, and by ru-
 mors of another currency con-
 version and imminent redocumen-
 tation of all East German citi-
 zens.
 Strictures leveled against
 the Evangelical Church, the only
 remaining all-German organiza-
 tion, have given the people ad-
 ditional grounds for resentment.
 The government's withdrawal of
 recognition of the church on
 19 May may foreshadow an attempt
 to create a church in East Ger-
 many dominated by the Pankow
 regime.   Pressures on pastors
 and church members to support
 such a church would be strongly
 resisted.
 A major ideological drive
 now under way in East German
 universities has the objective
 of achieving "the socialist
 transformation" of institutions
 of higher learning.   Individuals
 are being singled out and ac-
 cused of "improper attitudes."
 Failure to recant and conform
 to regime directives has result-
 ed in the loss of posts for fac-
 ulty members, expulsion of stu-
 dents, and even imprisonment for
 some individuals.   As a result
 of these pressures, there has
 been a significant increase in
 the number of scientists, stu-
 dents, and professional peo-
 ple fleeing to West Germany.

 PEIPING'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST DOMESTIC REVISIONISM
 Communist China's present
 "thought-reform" campaign, which
 is being implemented in conjunc-
 tion with its attacks on Yugo-
 slav heresies, is giving spe-
 cial attention to Mao Tse-tung
 as a theorist.   The Chinese
 Communists are attempting, in
 Mao's recent words, to "write
 the newest and most beautiful
 words" of Marxism-Leninism on
 a "clean sheet of white paper"
 --his metaphor for the minds
 of the Chinese populace.
 Peiping's need for continuing
 the steady diet of orthodoxy
 as part of the "rectification"
 drive suggests that party lead-
 ers are faced with a greater
 degree of political unreliabil-
 ity among the populace than
 they had foreseen.
 As part of the indoctrina-
 tion campaign, the party central
 committee has inaugurated a
 theoretical organ, Red Flamm,
 and most of the provincia  and

 municipal party committees have
 announced plans to publish theo-
 retical journals.                         The purpose
 of these publications is to re-
 flect current "theoretical and
 practical"  problems,   combat
 "revisionism," criticize "bour-
 geois viewpoints," and play up
 the regime's cultural achieve-
 ments.
 The regime also plans to
 train political and theoretical
 cadres.   Hunan Province, with
 1,200 full-time  theoretical
 workers, intends to double that
 number in the next five years.
 To emphasize the importance
 Peiping attaches to these ef-
 forts,  leading party officials
 --including two politburo mem-
 bers--have been assigned  to
 teaching posts in local univer-
 sities.
 As the key element in Pei-
 ping's increased emphasis on
 orthodoxy, Mao Tse-tung's pres-
 tige and works have received
 special attention this spring.
 The bolstering of Mao's person-
 al prestige reached a peak at
 the recent  party  congress,
 where he  was credited with
 originating the general guide-
 lines for Chinese development
 during the "transition to so-
 cialism."                      He was further cred-
 ited  with                  formulating  the
 guiding principles of the "rec-
 tification" campaign,  and the
 economic goal of catching up
 with Britain in 15 years.  This
 attention to Mao is apparently
 to restore some of the prestige
 he lost  as  a  result of the
 failure  last  year  of  his
 "hundred  flowers"  thesis and
 the  criticism  of  "rightists."
 Peiping seems anxious to
 counter speculation that Mao,
 who in 1957  tampered  with
 Leninist practices  of party
 control, has any ideological af-
 finity                                                                 with the Yugoslav lead-
 ers.   The  first two issues of
 Red Flag in June contained sev-
 eral ar icles by politburo al-
 ternates  attacking  Yugoslav
 rejection  of  the  concepts
 of  the Communist    party power
 monopoly,   class struggle, and
 strong  state  control  of all
 activities.   In  praising Mao
 for  his  "creative  develop-
 ment"                                                        of          the "theory of
 state," politburo alternate
 Wang Chia-hsiang       was  careful
 to  stress  that Mao was not
 deviating from accepted Leninist
 doctrine.
 The Chinese Communist lead-
 ers,  seeing a long road ahead
 in their efforts to humble op-
 ponents of  orthodox  doctrine
 and to indoctrinate  lukewarm
 supporters, are planning period-
 ic "rectification" drives. Any-
 thing other than a "hard" line
 toward deviationists in  the
 bloc would be incompatible with
 this zealous domestic emphasis
 on conformity.   Chinese Commu-
 nist propagandists are expected
 to continue their attacks on
 Yugoslav heresies and to prod
 the Poles into an acceptance of
 Soviet  leadership in the politi-
 cal and ideological fields.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 FRENCH POLITICAL OUTLOOK
 De Gaulle's first official
 contacts with NATO leaders have
 confirmed his support for the
 West's major defense aims, but
 there is growing speculation
 that he may demonstrate a more
 independent policy on relations
 with Communist China and other
 bloc countries.   Meanwhile, do-
 mestic opposition is coalescing
 and extremists  on  both left
 and right are preparing to at-
 tack his Algerian and constitu-
 tional reform proposals.
 There is wide speculation
 on De Gaulle's attitude toward
 various bloc countries.   The
 Foreign  Ministry  has   denied
 recent press rumors that dip-
 lomatic recognition of Peiping
 is  'imminent,   but  admits  ex-
 panded  economic contacts                      are
 under consideration.   De Gaulle
 is  reported to  have  left
 the door open on an offer of
 credits  for  raw materials
 from Soviet Ambassador Vino-
 gradov.                 A Foreign Ministry
 spokesman has said the premier
 is  toying  with  the  idea of
 a European defense plan which
 would "help the Poles."
 Further clarification of
 his North African program is
 expected to result from his
 visit to Algeria on 2-4 July.
 The Tunisian agreement on
 troop  withdrawals  gives  him
 a respite, and  he  plans  to
 meet Moroccan King Mohamed V
 in August.   Steps to mollify
 Moslem  opinion  will  inten-
 sify                                                               extremist  settler  re-
 actions,   however,   and                                                                 many
 of  the  leaders prominent  in
 the disturbances which brought
 him  to  power  are  seeking
 to organize a strong rightist
 movement to  oppose  any  mod-
 erate                                                                solution.  Pierre Pou-
 jade  is supporting                                                               the  move-
 ment General Chassin is trying
 to organize.
 Pierre Mendes-France is
 reported organizing a "labor
 rally" to include   the   So-
 cialist  party's                                                                   left   wing
 and the Mitterrand group with
 his own Radical elements in a
 "constructive opposition to
 De Gaulle."  Claude Bourdet,
 editor of the left-wing France-
 Observateur, is actively promot-
 ing a broad-based                                                               Socialist
 party.   The left  wing of the
 Socialist  party   is  trying
 to build up action groups in
 each party unit with the ob-
 jective                                                                   of  disavowing  Guy
 Mollet.    All  these  groups
 are potential objects of Com-
 munist  exploitation  and  run
 the  risk   of  Communist  domi-
 nation.
 Regardless of the policies
 De Gaulle eventually proposes
 on Algeria, and on constitution-
 al reform, opposition from both
 extremes will foment discontent.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 however, has apparently not yet
 been able to attract French
 holdings abroad.      More economic
 adjustments, possibly:with, further
 devaluation of the franc, will
 be required if France is to
 compete effectively in foreign
 trade and regain international
 financial confidence.
 During the first four days
 of the 3.5-percent tax-exempt
 gold loan, the government took
 in $43,000,000 of hoarded gold
 as compared with total receipts
 of only $34,000,000 from Pinay's
 successful gold loan of 1952.
 The total of about $100,000,000
 subscribed  in  the  four-day
 period also  represents  a high-
 er  rate                 than  the  1952  loan.
 The head of the Treasury has in-
 dicated that he would consider
 the loan a success if it yielded
 $250,000,000 by mid-July, when
 it is expected to be closed.
 France's deficit in the EPU
 is reported at only $25,000,000
 by 21 June,  in contrast with one
 of $115,000,000 during May, and
 even this deficit will be large-
 ly offset by a surplus with the
 dollar area this month.   Last
 month's strong pressure on the
 franc, for which the free market
 quotation was about 465, was
 accompanied by speculative trans-
 fers of  funds  out  of France,
 with $50,000,000 in foreign ex-
 change  flowing to West Germany
 alone. The franc recovered
 sharply with the accession of
 De Gaulle and has since been
 quoted in the 430's, as compared
 with the official rate of 420.
 No further flight of funds is
 indicated.
 The government succeeded
 in maintaining a surplus of re-
 ceipts over expenditures through
 May in contrast with a $400,-
 000,!000 deficit during the same
 period in 1957.   A deficit can
 be expected to recur in a few
 months.   The 19 June authori-
 zation of appropriations for
 the Algerian campaign far ex-
 ceeds military expenditures
 agreed on earlier this year in
 negotiating the $655,000,000
 emergency loan from the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund, the EPU,
 and the United States Government.
 The total budget deficit may be
 forced above the agreed ceiling.
 In addition to the prospec-
 tive budget deficit,  an accumula-
 tion of unsatisfied wage demands
 in the nationalized industries
 also poses a threat of reinvig-
 orating inflationary pressures.
 These pressures, which have only
 very recently shown some tendency
 to abate, in line with the gen-
 eral recession in the West, have
 been  largely  responsible  for
 France's adverse  trade-and-
 payments balance during  the
 past  two years.  Any major re-
 surgence, would; - cut short the
 financial breathing spell now
 available to France for placing
 its economic affairs in order.
 Another step toward for-
 mation of a Maghrebian (North
 African) federation was taken
 at the tripartite conference
 of Moroccan, Tunisian, and
 Algerian political leaders in
 Tunis from 17 to 20 June which
 was held concurrently  with
 Moroccan-Tunisian governmental
 discussions.   The conference
 served to increase the formal
 ties between the participants
 and to coordinate more closely
 their policies toward France.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 As a result, the independent
 states of Morocco and Tunisia
 now are committed more clearly
 than before to support the Al-
 gerian National Liberation Front
 (FLN) in its fight for independ-
 ence.   At the same time.. Moroc-
 co and Tunisia hope they can
 hold the FLN in line and serve
 as intermediaries if France
 should be willing to negotiate
 with the FLN.
 In a final communiqud, the
 conferees rejected De Gaulle's
 policy of integrating Algeria
 with metropolitan France and
 again proclaimed the right of
 the Algerian people to sover-
 eignty and independence.   Their
 decision to proceed with the
 formation of a 30-member "pro-
 visional consultative assembly"
 for North Africa--implementing
 a recommendation of the Tangier
 conference held late in April--
 promises to enhance the FLN's
 status.   Although the conference
 side-stepped the inflammatory
 issue of an Algerian government-
 in-exile,  the FLN's executive
 committee seems to have reorgan-
 ized itself as a quasi-govern-
 mental body under the nominal
 leadership of moderate Algerian
 spokesman Ferhat Abbas.
 The presence of FLN dele-
 gates in Tunis seems not to have
 hindered conclusion on 17 June
 of an agreement providing for
 the evacuation of some 9,000
 French troops from Tunisia. How-
 ever, Tunis' outright support
 for Algerian independence prob-
 ably will continue to compli-
 cate its relations with France,
 particularly the negotiations
 scheduled to begin by this fall
 for a new status for Bizerte.
 Morocco's support for Al-
 gerian independence may also
 make more difficult the Moroc-
 can-French negotiations now un-
 der way regarding the evacuation
 of most of the 30,000 French
 ground troops still in Morocco
 and the retention of some French
 training bases.   France may re-
 duce its demand for such bases
 from 18 to six or eight, but
 seems likely to insist on the
 retention of the base at Oujda
 on the Algerian border.   This
 is one of the locations which
 Morocco  on 20 May wanted evacu-
 ated immediately.
 COMMUNIST GAINS IN GUATEMALA
 The Guatemalan Communists
 now are more active than at any
 time since the Arbenz regime
 was ousted four years ago. Pres-
 ident Ydigoras, who has been
 notably complacent toward the
 Communists in the nearly four
 months since he took office,
 now seems preparing  to  act
 against them.   The President,
 however, appears to feel more
 immediately threatened by right-
 ist plotting, and his moves
 against the Communists may be
 made more to satisfy his anti-
 Communist critics, both at home
 and abroad, than to cope with
 the Communist problem.
 Communists have been re-
 turning from exile at an ever
 increasing rate since the as-
 sassination of President Castillo
 Armas last July.   The political
 disturbances in October and the
 markedly increased toleration
 of leftist political activity
 that, followed have permitted
 them to operate in an environ-
 ment of relative freedom.   The
 Communists now strongly influ-
 ence and perhaps control some
 leading labor unions, are ac-
 tive in student and intellec-
 tual groups, and have infiltrated
 the leftist Revolutionary party

 convention which began on 25
 June could be pro-Communist.
 Two recent events are in-
 dicative of the current high
 degree of confidence felt  by
 the Communists.   In early June,
 the party instructed all but
 the four most prominent members
 still in exile to return, clan-
 destinely if necessary, by 30
 July.   In mid-June, a leading
 Communist gave an arrogant press
 interview after he had slipped
 back into the country immediate-
 ly after having been expelled
 by the police.   He said he re-.
 gretted being the first Guate-
 malan deported under Ydigoras
 and hoped the President would
 punish those guilty of this of-
 fense.
 Disillusionment with the
 President is mounting among
 anti-Communist Guatemalans, Who
 had expected him resolutely to
 goras may now realize that he
 must quickly take some action
 to restore confidence in his
 government.
 Adolfo Lopez Mateos, cer-
 tain winner in Mexico's presi-
 dential elections on 6 July,
 may have difficulty in carrying
 on the moderate policies of the
 present Ruiz Cortines adminis-
 tration under which Mexico con-
 tinues to enjoy a political
 stability and balanced economic
 development rare in Latin Amer-
 ica.   Leftist influence in the
 labor movement, an important
 component of the governing Par-
 ty of Revolutionary Institutions
 (PRI), appears to be exploiting
 the growing conviction of work-
 ers that PRI domination has
 helped deprive them of a fair
 share in Mexico's rapid econom-
 ic growth.
 The PRI has run Mexico for
 30 years through a highly cen-
 tralized organization.   Its pol-
 icy of favoring groups consid-
 ered most capable of advancing
 the country's welfare at a giv-
 en time while managing to pla-
 cate less favored groups has
 provided a political unity Mex-
 ico sorely needed.   At present,
 however, the workers say their
 union leaders, who are also par-
 ty leaders, have gone too far
 in accepting the government's
 encouragement of investment
 while keeping wages low to fight
 inflation.
 Recent widespread strikes
 by telegraphers' and teachers'
 groups, which repudiated their
 union heads to follow leftist
 dissident leaders, resulted in
 substantial wage increases and
 have influenced other unions.
 Unemployment in farming areas
 of northern Mexico is high this

 Communist Popular party (PP)
 has organized mobs of squatters
 to occupy private farmlands to

 made concessions.
 Marxist-led electricians
 negotiating for higher wages
 are meeting with very little
 opposition in efforts to organ-
 ize a national labor federation
 in competition with the govern-

 Their traditional demand for

 About 75 percent of Mexico's

 usual unfavorable trade balance
 is offset by US tourist spending.
 If the effects of the US economic

 in Mexico, the pressure will be
 strong on Lopez Mateos to seek
 the advice of ex-President La-
 zaro Cardenas, who remains a
 strong political force and leads
 the nationalistic left wing of
 the PRI.   Cardenas is considered
 the leading proponent of the

 GOVERNMENT CRISIS IN EAST PAKISTAN
 The  resignation  of  two
 successive governments in East
 Pakistan Province between 18
 and 23 June led President Mirza
 on 25 June  to  take over the
 provincial administration under
 President's  Rule.   These  de-
 velopments                       will  facilitate
 Mirza's efforts to realign the
 national government coalition
 so as to increase his control
 of the government.
 The 21-month-old Awami
 League government in East Paki-
 stan was defeated on 18 June
 in a vote of confidence, follow-
 ing weeks of opposition effort
 to undermine the government's
 majority.  A new coalition of
 all groups opposing the Awami
 League was toppled on 23 June
 after only four days in office.
 The leftist National Awami party
 (NAP) appears to hold the bal-
 ance of power in the provincial
 assembly.    After  helping  to
 bring about the fall  of  the
 Awami League government on 18
 June by withdrawing its support,
 the  NAP  later  reversed  its
 stand and on 23 June voted with
 the Awami League to defeat the
 newly installed government.
 The defeat of the Awami
 League weakened the national
 position of the party's leader,
 former Prime Minister Suhrawardy.
 Since he provides the chief sup-
 port of the present national
 government  coalition  led  by
 Prime Minister Noon, the devel-
 opmentsin East Pakistan are
 likely to promote Mirza's ef-
 forts to eliminate Suhrawardy's
 influence by replacing Noon's
 coalition with one more amena-
 ble to his control.
 Increased instability would
 probably force postponement of
 the national elections scheduled
 for November and encourage Mirza
 to carry out his threat to dis-
 pense with parliamentary gov-
 ernment altogether and impose a
 dictatorial regime in Pakistan.

 The Indonesian cabinet re-

 President Sukarno falls short
 of the antileftist changes de-

 hinted by government officials
 and Sukarno himself.   The pro-
 Communist A.  M. Hanafi appears
 to have been demoted, however,
 from his post as minister for
 manpower mobilization to minis-

 Cabinet changes involve
 the abolition of two ministries
 but the retention of their in-
 cumbents in other posts and the
 addition of`three new ministries.
 Only one man was dropped from
 the cabinet--Sunardj o of the
 Nahdlatul Ulama, who had been
 minister of trade and charged
 with corruption.   The army had
 demanded his removal.
 Four new names have been
 added.   Two are members of the
 non-Communist Nahdlatul Ulama,
 an indication that this party's
 prestige is growing in the eyes
 of President Sukarno.   A third
 is Mohammed Yamin, who has been
 appointed minister without port-
 folio.   Yamin is anti-Western,
 has been in and out of a number
 of parties including Murba, the
 "national Communist" party, and
 has recently joined a small na-
 tionalist party.   He was prob-
 ably included to balance the
 appointment of the fourth new-
 comer, Colonel Suprajogi.   The
 principal gainer in the shake-up
 seems to be Sukarno, who appears
 to have increased his influence
 in a cabinet already responsive
 to his demands.
 Sukarno has announced that
 the first job of the reshuffled
 cabinet is to establish a na-
 tional planning board to super-
 vise the nation's economy--a
 feature of the President's pro-
 gram of "guided democracy." A
 preparatory committee consist-
 ing of five cabinet ministers
 is to be formed to work on the
 problem and reportedly will in-
 clude both Hanafi and Yamin.
 The government announced
 on 26 June that the dissident
 capital of Menado in North Cele-
 bes had fallen.   The dissidents
 there had been reported in a
 critical situation for several
 days.   In Sumatra

 BURMESE POLITICAL FERMENT CONTINUES
 Burmese Premier Nu's coa-    i status in return for a cessation
 lition government, which depends
 on the  Communist-dominated Na-
 tional Unity Front (NUF) for
 its majority,  is so unstable
 that he is expected to dissolve

 reported negotiating, has taken
 advantage of the government's
 instability to  demand  legal
 of hostilities.   The NUF is re-
 ported seeking three cabinet

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 June 1958
 Swe - Kyaw Nyein faction has
 unilaterally "dissolved" the
 AFPFL executive committee, oust-
 ing Nu as president, and has
 elected one of its own members
 as AFPFL president.
 In the districts outside Rangoon,
 Nu's followers are reported at-
 tempting to recruit locally re-
 spected retired police and civil
 service officials to stand for
 Parliament on his ticket.
 Both government and army
 officials are continuing their
 efforts to avert violence in
 the political controversy. The
 Home Ministry has ordered dis-
 trict police officials to pro-
 vide each member of Parliament
 with a 24-hour, two-man, armed
 bodyguard.   In addition, police
 officials are required to take
 immediate action following any
 information of planned violence
 --"no matter how unlikely the
 information may appear to be.,,
 The status of the persons in-
 volved is not to affect this
 order, and four members of Par-
 liament have already been brief-
 ly detained.   Most recently the
 Home Ministry has started the
 demobilization of the politically
 oriented home guard in an ef-
 fort to limit armed violence
 between the government and op-
 position factions.
 Army commander Ne Win, de-
 termined to maintain the armed
 services' prestige and reputa-
 tion for political neutrality,
 has advanced the date of the
 annual Burma Armed Forces Com-
 manding Officers' Conference
 from September to 23 June and
 has insisted on nonparticipation
 of officers in politics.   Po-
 litically inclined                                                                   officers,
 such  as  Colonel Aung Gyi, a
 Socialist and  deputy  army
 chief, will probably be forced
 to  choose  between   military
 and  political careers.
 SOUTH VIETNAMESE - CAMBODIAN BORDER DIFFICULTIES
 Phnom Penh's accusation
 that South Vietnamese troops
 have invaded Cambodian terri-
 tory, occupying several villages
 in the northeast, climaxes a
 series of increasingly bitter
 border incidents between the
 two countries.   Cambodian lead-
 ers have appealed for American
 intervention in Saigon to se-
 cure the prompt withdrawal of
 the Vietnamese forces, and may
 seek Sino-Soviet bloc support
 if this proves ineffectual.
 Saigon denies any violation of
 the poorly defined and disputed
 common frontier by its army.
 Cambodia's charges against
 South Vietnam were aired in a
 nationwide radio appeal on 25
 June to all Cambodians to "ral-
 ly to the defense of their na-
 tion."  The alleged Vietnamese
 incursion is in the same general
 region where a border encroach-
 ment by Cambodian forces earlier
 this month had been reported by
 Saigon.   The remoteness of the
 area, poor communications, and
 the vaguely defined boundary
 have given rise to exaggerated
 reports in Saigon and Phnom Penh
 which have heightened tension
 in both capitals.
 Cambodians have a strong
 fear of a Vietnamese invasion,
 and are unlikely to handle this
 dispute objectively.   Although
 Cambodia's widely scattered
 army of  roughly  30,000  is

 both parties to the

 tude,  there  is a dan-

 The major dan-
 ger in this   situa-
 tion,   however,    is
 that Cambodia  may
 enter into diplomatic
 relations with Com-
 munist China in order
 to secure Peiping's
 support.   Cambodian leaders are
 inclined to feel that the West
 will not support neutralist Cam-
 bodia in its dispute with anti-
 Communist Vietnam,  and have
 hinted broadly on recent occa-
 sions at such a development.
 Cambodian Prime Minister Sim
 Var stated on 25 June that Cam-
 bodia will turn to "other friend-
 ly powers" if its appeal for
 American support is unavailing.
 Peiping, which already has a
 large economic mission stationed
 in Phnom Penh,  has been anxious
 to enter into political rela-
 tions as well, but Cambodia pre-
 viously has avoided a diplomatic
 exchange because of fear of in-
 creased Communist subversion.

 COUFI' ENTIAL
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN IRAN
 Iran has made a relatively
 good financial recovery since the
 oil nationalization crisis of
 1951-1953 plunged it into near
 bankruptcy.   Over 80 percent of
 the Iranian people continue to
 live in extreme poverty and see
 little prospect of personal ben-
 efit from the government's eco-
 nomic plans.                    The per capita
 gross national product is esti-
 mated to be only slightly over
 $100.   The living standard of
 the average Iranian is unlikely
 to be raised as long as the
 present feudal landowning sys-
 tem is maintained.
 The Oil Industry
 Although Iran has consid-
 erable resources aside from its
 oil, the economy depends almost
 completely on its oil revenues
 for funds, not only for devel-
 opment but for day-to-day gov-
 ernment operations.   Until re-
 cently, the oil industry was
 almost a complete monopoly of
 the Consortium--a group of 17
 Western companies formed to ex-
 tract, process, and market
 Iran's oil as part of the set-
 tlement of the nationalization
 crisis df 1953.   Recently, how-
 ever, an Italian government-
 controlled firm secured a choice
 concession in the Persian Gulf
 by promising 75 percent of the
 profit to Tehran.   Following
 the Italian lead, the Pan Amer-
 ican Petroleum Corporation, a
 wholly owned subsidiary of
 Standard Oil Company (Indiana),
 signed a similar profit-sharing
 agreement for an offshore con-
 cession opposite the prolific
 Kuwait fields.
 Although oil production
 did not regain the  precrisis
 level until 1957, the incor-
 poration of the 50/50 profit-
 sharing principle in the set-
 tlement caused a dramatic rise
 in oil revenues.   Crude oil
 production averaged 725,000 bar-
 rels a day last year, compared
 with 660,000 barrels a day in
 1950, about a 10 percent in-
 crease.   Oil revenues,  however,
 were markedly higher. In 1950,
 the last full year before the
 oil shutdown,  Iranian oil rev-
 enues amounted to almost $45,000,-
 000; in 1957 revenues had in-
 creased to about $230,000,000.
 Prospects for rapid expan-
 sion of Iran's oil production
 are quite good, despite a gen-
 eral world oversupply of oil,
 since the Consortium provides
 a wide marketing base for Irani-
 an crude.   Iran's output last
 year increased at a much sharper
 rate than in the rest of the
 Middle East, and will probably
 do so again in 1958.   It will
 probably be some time, however,
 before the new companies on the
 scene begin to make a substan-
 tial contribution to Iranian
 economic progress.
 Agriculture and Industry
 Aside from the oil indus-
 try, agriculture is the main-
 stay of Iran's economy.   Last
 year the value of agricultural
 output probably approached $1
 billion, largely as a result of
 a 9-percent increase in produc-
 tion over 1956.   Despite its
 importance, agriculture is
 primitive, wasteful, poorly man-
 aged, and dominated by absentee
 landowners.   These politically
 powerful landowners control over
 60 percent of the farm land and
 thus far have avoided undertak-
 ing even the relatively mild re-
 form measures suggested by the
 throne.   In addition,  invest-
 ment funds allocated to agricul-
 ture by the economic plan author-
 ities   have totaled only about
 12 percent of plan investments--
 a disproportionate amount in
 view of the fact that agriculture
 provides a livelihood for about
 75 percent of the population.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Except for the Western-
 owned petroleum industry, which
 employs about 40 percent of the
 industrial labor force, indus-
 trial enterprises are small and
 inefficient by Western standards.
 Iranian industry--which supplies
 about 60 percent of domestic
 cement and glass requirements,
 25 percent of sugar, and 38 per-
 cent of cotton cloth--employs
 only about 70,000 workers.
 Economic Development
 Economic development in
 Iran is dominated by the Plan
 Organization, which spent about
 $153,000,000.1ast year.   The
 master development plan--the so-
 called Seven-Year Development
 Plan which ends in September
 1962--scheduled investments of
 over $1 billion.   This organiza-
 tion has been subjected to con-
 tinuing criticism
 both in and out of
 the government. While
 some criticism has
 been deserved, a good
 deal can be attributed
 to the organization's
 poor public relations
 proved with the awarding of con-
 struction and planning contracts
 to American, Italian, and French
 firms.
 As a result of growing cen-
 tral budget deficits, the gov-
 ernment recently reduced the
 share of oil revenues allocated
 to the Plan Organization.  While
 this caused some concern, it is
 not likely to result in any
 serious curtailing of the sched-
 uled projects, since plan author-
 ities are resorting to foreign
 borrowing.
 Finance
 Iran's over-all financial
 situation is sound.   Foreign
 exchange reserves reached an all-
 time high of about $150,000,000
 in April,compared with $113,000,-
 000 before the crisis and a low

 on the part of most

 who block his plans

 The bulk of the

 is in transportation,

 While this type of
 investment is a pre-
 requisite to further
 development,   con-
 struction often takes
 place far from cen-
 ters of population
 and gives rise to the
 popular belief--in
 part probably correct
 --that some develop-

 of $58,000,000 in 1952.   Total
 foreign assets of the national
 bank were about 400 percent
 higher in April than at the end
 of 1956.  While the money sup-
 ply continues to increase, gains
 are modest and in line with
 other developments.
 The central budget this
 year was faced with the possi-
 bility of a substantial deficit
 prior to the reapportioning of
 oil revenues.   The deficit was
 caused chiefly by the sizable
 increase voted for government
 and military salaries and an in-
 crease--not including the mili-
 tary pay increases--of 37 per-
 cent in the defense budget.
 Prior to the reallocation of oil
 revenues, the central budget was
 to receive 5 percent of "sched-
 uled oil revenues."  Under the

 oil is moved to markets entirely
 by way of the Persian Gulf rath-
 er than by pipelines, and the
 Iranians are largely indifferent
 to Arab causes, especially when
 money is involved.
 Arab appeals on the basis
 of religion or Arab unity usual-
 ly leave Tehran's policy unaf-
 fected.   Iranians have no racial
 or linguistic affinities with
 the Arabs.   Iran sells oil to
 Israel despite Arab protests.
 Proud of their history and the
 high cultural level reached in
 ancient times, Iranians consider
 themselves superior to the Arabs,
 whom they regard as semicultured
 tribesmen.
 Tehran is also indifferent
 to the Arab League economic boy-
 cott of Western firms dealing
 with Israel.   Iran,

 substantial increase in oil
 production, the government prob-
 ably will receive almost $110,-
 000,000, about a 65-percent in-
 crease over the last fiscal year.
 Iran is following a mildly
 inflationary path, a concomitant
 of almost any development pro-
 gram.                      As long as the country's
 liberal import policy prevails,
 inflation probably will not
 reach serious proportions.

 because some of them
 are assembled in Israel.
 Numerous  Western
 vessels  which   are
 banned from Arab ports
 for dealing with Israel
 ply freely between
 Iranian and free world
 ports.
 Prospects
 Although Iran has made sub-
 stantial progress in achieving
 financial stability, it has made
 little progress in solving its
 major economic problem--wide-
 spread poverty and illiteracy.
 Even the ambitious development
 program,   if   fully  and honest-
 ly  implemented,  would not
 produce   a meaningful  rise in
 the  standard of living   of
 the bulk   of   the population.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 June 1958
 South Vietnam, nearing its
 fourth anniversary as an inde-
 pendent state, has made remark-
 able strides since the July 1954
 armistice, when it was threat-
 ened by an early take-over by
 Hanoi.   Today's surface tran-
 quility, however, belies South
 Vietnam's continuing struggle
 for long-range survival and for
 eventual unification of Vietnam
 under non-Communist rule.   The
 acceleration of Communist ter-
 rorism in South Vietnam during
 the past year,  together with a
 more aggressive and imaginative
 propaganda offensive on the part
 of Hanoi, attests to the intens-
 ity of this struggle.
 Internal Security
 Saigon had achieved a high
 degree of nationwide stability
 by early 1957, but the security
 situation in the rural areas of
 the delta region and  in  the
 western provinces bordering on
 Cambodia has deteriorated.   In
 addition, there was an anti-Amer-
 ican terrorist incident in Sai-
 gon last October, when Commu-
 nist bombs wounded 13 American
 MAAG personnel.  Despite tight-
 ened security measures, there
 is a real threat of further vio-
 lence against Americans in view
 of the Communist objective of
 impairing American support of
 the Diem regime.
 The resurgence of Communist
 terrorism has been marked by the
 assassination of provincial of-
 ficials and central government
 representatives at the village
 level.  This coincides with in-
 tensified efforts by the Commu-
 nist underground to gain  the
 support of entire villages--
 either                    by  persuasion  or  by
 threats.   There are indications
 that these efforts are meeting
 with some success in the more
 isolated areas.   The renewed
 security threat has reinforced
 the Diem government's determi-
 nation to place primary emphasis
 on strengthening its military
 and paramilitary forces at the
 expense of basic economic and
 sociological progress.   This low
 priority for economic matters
 constitutes the real danger to
 stability over the long run.
 A major breakthrough in
 Saigon's efforts to improve rural
 security occurred in May with
 the rallying to the government
 of some 1,200 dissidents of the
 Hoa Hao sect, the last signifi-
 cant force of indigenous rebel
 groups whose combined private
 armies once threatened the Sai-
 gon regime.   The remaining few
 hundred native dissidents are
 widely scattered and are con-
 sidered under Communist control.
 Actual Communist underground mil-
 itary strength in believed to
 be 2,100, with a larger number
 of political agents and sympa-
 thizers.   Since 1954, the Commu-
 nists have sought to perpetuate
 local armed revolt against the
 Diem government to further their
 own terrorist activities, which
 run counter to Hanoi's public
 espousal of the Geneva armistice.
 Relations With Neighbors
 The surrender of the Hoa
 Hao force should also help to
 improve the chronically poor re-
 lations between South Vietnam
 and Cambodia, as this dissident
 band formerly had operated on
 both sides of the frontier.   In
 instances where Vietnamese troops
 have crossed the border in pur-
 suit of dissident elements seek-
 ing refuge in Cambodian terri-
 tory, armed clashes with Cam-
 bodian forces often resulted.
 South Vietnamese - Cambodian
 hostility stems from traditional
 animosity between the two races
 and from the divergent political
 policies of the present-day re-
 gimes.   The recurrent border in-
 cidents have frustrated sporadic
 efforts to achieve a modus vi-
 vendi.

 Cambodia, has vacillated between
 conciliation and toughness in
 attempting to influence  the
 Phnom Penh regime.   The hard ap-
 proach has been particularly
 unavailing and risks driving
 Cambodia closer to North Viet-
 nam and Communist China.
 The Diem government is also
 alarmed at the recent Communist

 fears a leftist-oriented re-
 gime will eventually emerge in
 Vientiane which will facilitate
 Communist infiltration across
 Vietnam's remote and hard-to-
 defend frontier.   The contem-
 plation of being isolated as
 the only militantly anti-Commu-
 nist state on the Indochina
 peninsula is disturbing to Sai-
 gon.   South Vietnam is taking
 direct action through its dip-
 lomatic mission in Vientiane to
 support the merger of Laotian
 conservative forces against the
 Communist political threat.   In
 addition, the two governments
 recently exchanged preliminary
 ideas for closer trade relations
 and improved communications.
 Military Strength
 South Vietnam's military
 capability to face the threat
 of external Communist aggression
 continues to show steady im-
 provement under MAAG training.
 The army of some 137,000 men is
 considered firmly loyal to Pres-
 ident Diem and continues to be
 the government's main pillar of
 support.   Together with less
 developed air and naval forces
 numbering about 4,000 and 5,000
 men, respectively, South Viet-
 nam's army is capable of initial
 limited resistance in the event
 of overt aggression from North
 Vietnam.   Steps are also being
 taken to streamline and increase
 the effectiveness of two major
 paramilitary forces--the Civil
 Guard and Self-Defense Corps,
 each with about 50,000 men.
 In contrast to its military
 strength, South Vietnam's econ-
 omy continues to be precarious.
 Agriculture, the nation's eco-
 nomic mainstay, is recovering
 slowly from wartime ravages.
 A limited start has been made
 in industrial development, but
 prerequisite foreign capital re-
 mains wary of the Diem govern-
 ment's suspicious attitude to-
 ward private investment.   The
 government's predilection toward
 strict controls and its ultra-
 conservative financial policies
 have aggravated deflationary
 tendencies in the economy.  Com-
 mercial activity is generally
 slow at present, and growing un-
 employment is a problem.   In re-
 sponse to heavy pressure from
 business and labor circles, how-
 ever, the government recently
 has taken a few cautions steps
 toward easing the situation.
 American aid still accounts
 for about 85 percent of Vietnam's
 imports and more than two thirds
 of its budgetary revenues.   In

 surplus was realized by stringent

 Greater economic progress has
 been hampered by the Vietnamese
 leaders' lack of experience in
 this field as well as by their
 primary interest in political
 and military matters.
 Diem's Leadership
 In one sense, the princi-
 pal factor in South Vietnam's
 early   stability--the  strong
 leadership of President Diem--
 today has become somewhat of an
 unsettling influence.   Diem's
 continued unwillingness to del-
 egate authority and his reluc
 tanceto grant greater individ-
 ual  freedoms at this time are
 hamstringing government opera-
 tions and contributing to popu-
 lar discontent.   Senior Viet-
 namese officials,  including
 Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho
 and several cabinet members,
 have expressed serious alarm in
 recent months over the govern-
 ment's apparent loss of popu-
 larity.  These officials believe
 Diem's narrow approach to politi-
 cal affairs is seriously weak-
 ening the regime.
 Criticism of Diem,'s author-
 itarian ways is not new, but has
 become more insistent now that
 relative political stability,
 which would permit more repre-
 sentative government, has been
 achieved.   Diem is undoubtedly
 aware of this criticism but has
 given no indication of being
 dissuaded from his belief that
 more liberal government, however
 desirable, cannot be afforded
 during the present "national
 emergency."  He speaks frequent-
 ly, however,-of having only "two
 or three years" in which  to
 hammer out a strong political
 and economic base for the nation
 before ..internal  pressures
 threaten to force a modifica-
 tion of the present driving
 pace.   Diem has been shrewd and
 far-sighted in his leadership;
 his decisions on several major
 issues in the past have proven
 correct.
 South Vietnam has made con-
 siderable progress since 1954
 against  great  odds,   and  to-
 day is a going concern.   There
 is a good economic potential
 for continued development toward
 greater  stability  and econom-
 ic viability.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NORTH VIETNAM BEGINS NEW THREE-YEAR PLAN
 Having completed a three-
 year period of economic rehabil-
 itation following the Indochina
 war, Hanoi has launched  its
 first three-year plan for eco-
 nomic development (1958-60) aimed
 h.t  transforming  backward,
 agricultural North Vietnam into
 an advanced industrial nation
 organized along "socialist"
 lines.   Hanoi recognizes that
 it faces tremendous obstacles,
 and President Ho Chi Minh has
 estimated that this "intricate
 and difficult" task will require
 three or four "long-term plans."
 Nearly 11,000,000 of the
 13,000,000 inhabitants of North
 Vietnam are peasants, farming
 uneconomical holdings which av-
 erage one third of an acre.
 In addition  to  recurring
 droughts and floods, the agrar-
 ian  population, which lives at
 a bare subsistence level, is
 burdened by high taxes and in-
 creasing regimentation.  The
 industrial sector of the economy
 is underdeveloped and ineffi-
 cient.   The creation of invest-
 ment capital in such an economy
 poses great problems, and North
 Vietnam is forced to rely heav=
 ily on the largesse of the rest
 of the Sino=Soviet bloc.   Hanoi
 draws so heavily on Chinese ex-
 perience that its economic plans
 and policies are almost carbon
 copies of those used by its "fra-
 ternal" neighbor to the north.
 Socialization of Agriculture
 The North Vietnamese au-
 thorities have proceeded in a
 gingerly fashion in socializing
 agriculture.   This caution is
 a reflection partly of Hanoi's
 decision to follow the'gradual
 precepts Peiping advocated for
 socialization and partly of the
 opposition generated by attempts
 at land reform in late 1956.
 By the end of 1957, only 0.05
 percent of agriculture was so-
 cialized, while 24.4 percent of
 industry, 27.6 percent of do-
 mestic retail trade, and 61 per-
 cent of wholesale trade had been
 socialized.   Socialization of
 foreign trade and the banking,
 postal, and railroad systems
 is virtually complete.
 The land reform program in
 North Vietnam, under which land
 was taken from farmers with rel-
 atively,  extensive holdings and
 given to the poor and landless,
 got under way even before the
 Communist occupation of Hanoi.
 In 1956 it was described as
 "basically complete," but vio-
 lent opposition--too strong for
 the regime to ignore--forced

 Hanoi, like Peiping, has sought
 to take advantage of tradition-
 al peasant joint-planting prac-
 tices in the formulation of mu-
 tual-aid teams and, more re-
 cently, of temporary agrarian
 difficulties such as the drought
 last winter, to impress on the
 peasants the benefits of co-
 operative effort.   By the end
 of this year, Hanoi hopes to
 more than double the number of
 households in mutual-aid teams.
 The controlled press recent-
 ly complained of the "conserva-
 tive mentality" of a peasantry
 "still reluctant to institute
 collectivization," and Truong
 Chinh has observed that the par-
 In pushing a campaign to
 socialize agrarian activity at
 this time, Hanoi probably feels,
 that the peasants will not be
 able to oppose it effectively.
 Chinese experience showed that
 once the blood bath of the land
 reform movement has broken down
 established patterns of rural
 life, the remaining steps toward
 socialization came relatively
 quickly and easily.   It is ques-
 tionable just how effective
 Hanoi has been in breaking down
 these established patterns, and
 many observers doubt that the
 peasantry will willingly join
 the campaign.

 indulging their natural inclina-
 tion to "separate, individual
 self-development."  The peasants,
 resentful of high tax levies,
 have persistently frustrated
 the efforts of the party to col-
 lect the full amount of agri-
 cultural taxes demanded by Hanoi.
 They have made it impossible
 for the cadres to carry out an
 accurate estimate of taxable
 land and yields.   There is lit-
 tle doubt that the peasants feel
 exploited, and Hanoi has found
 it necessary to take special
 steps to keep the peasantry
 from migrating to the cities.
 the regime is pushing
 the establishment of
 other types of rural
 cooperativization,
 including credit co-
 operatives and supply
 and marketing coopera-
 tives.
 Industry and Commerce
 The move toward
 socialization in in-
 dustry and commerce
 has proceeded further
 than in agriculture.
 In pursuing its cam-
 paign against private
 business, Hanoi prob-
 ably will continue to
 use the same restric-
 tive trade and financial pro-
 cedures, including retributive
 taxation, as were employed in
 China.
 The regime says that it
 has already "laid hold" of pri-
 vate businessmen by use of the
 state trade system.   Through
 its control of sources of supply
 and markets, the state has been
 able to restrict-the "external
 relationships" of the private
 businessman and lead him "along
 the lines of the state plan."
 In Hanoi's present mood, however,
 these procedures do not go far
 enough.   The regime feels it

 must increasingly concern it-
 self with the "internal af-
 fairs" of private enterpreneurs
 by investing money in their
 firms and thus transforming
 them into semisocialist enter-
 prises similar to the joint pub-
 lic-private enterprises now
 common in China.
 Here again Hanoi faces the
 obstacle of a resentful, unco-
 operative group .which  can
 scarcely be expected to cheer
 its own liquidation.
 In 1957 the to-
 tal value of agricul-
 tural and industrial
 production reached an
 estimated $944,000,-
 000.  Agriculture
 contributed about
 three quarters, rough-
 ly $698,000,000,
 while industry and
 handicrafts contrib-
 uted'some $246,000,-
 000.   The 1958 plan
 envisages an over-
 all increase of ap-
 proximately 10 per-
 cent.   The total value
 of agricultural out-
 put is to go up 5.4
 percent, while that of
 industrial and handi-
 craft production is
 to the European satellites.
 This has left very little, if
 any, for domestic stockpiles.
 Current crop conditions suggest
 an early rice crop this year
 somewhat poorer than last year's
 early crop.   Rice exports, which
 continued through January 1958,
 subsequently dropped off sharply,
 perhaps in anticipation of a
 tight domestic supply situation
 this summer.

 principal stress on food crops,

 in that period rather than a
 carefully balanced set of tar-
 gets.
 Premier Pham Van Dong has
 described the increase in rice
 production as the regime's
 "biggest success."  The output,
 according to Hanoi's figures,
 rose from 2,400,000 tons in 1939
 to 4,100,000 tons in 1956.   In
 1957 the rice crop came to only
 3,900,000 tons, largely because
 of a widespread drought during
 the fall harvest.   The regime
 that year exported an estimated
 180,000 tons of rice, mainly
 it has consistently urged great-
 er production of industrial
 crops.   In 1957, for example,
 the authorities programed a 30-
 percent increase in such crops.
 The targets for oilseeds, pea-
 nuts, and tobacco were probably
 achieved, while that for cotton,
 in which the authorities have
 been especially interested, was
 not.   The 1957 plan to produce
 7,500 tons of cotton was not
 fulfilled, and the crop prob-
 ably totaled only several hun-
 dred tons above the 1956 output
 of 6,300 tons.   The 1958 plan
 calls for an output of indus-
 trial crops amounting to 106.3

 hampered production.   Industrial
 production targets had to be
 lowered in September 1957 when
 it became apparent the orginal
 goals were not going to be met.
 In fact, state enterprises in
 nine major fields--coal, cement,
 electric power, phosphates, fac-
 tory-made cloth, paper, matches,
 alcohol, and tin--attained only
 about 55 percent of the produc-
 tion levels of 1939, generally
 considered the peak year.  On
 the other hand, private indus-
 tries in 11 fields--bricks,
 wood, sugar, fish, salt, home-
 spun cloth, handicraft paper,
 leather, soap, aluminum, and
 lead--were outproducing their
 1939 level by 27 percent.
 Foreign Trade and Aid
 Without large amounts of
 aid from the Sino-Soviet bloc
 countries, even the marginal
 economic development of North
 Vietnam would have been impos-
 sible.   Hanoi admits that its
 capital funds have come largely
 from "friendly, countries." This
 condition is expected to con-
 tinue.
 Total bloc aid in all forms
 --loans, grants, goods exchanges,
 and flood relief--will total an
 estimated $563,000,000 by 1960.
 Communist China will contribute
 over half, with a $326,000,000
 five-year (1955-59) grant,  plus
 another $20,000,000 in other
 forms of assistance.   During the
 past three years, Chinese aid
 has gone chiefly into the res-
 toration  and development of
 transportation, communications,
 and irrigation.
 The Soviet Union provided
 a $100,000,000 grant in 1955
 and subsequently made available
 an additional $70,000,000 in
 loans and materials.   Some 75
 percent of this aid has been
 allocated for industrial devel-
 opment and construction, includ-
 ing North Vietnam's first machine
 tool factory,  recently opened
 in Hanoi.   The European satel-
 lites have contributed an esti-
 mated $100,000,000, of which
 East Germany, Poland, and Czech-
 oslovakia gave  60  percent.
 Satellite aid has consisted
 largely of equipment and tech-
 nical knowledge in industry and
 public health.
 The bloc accounts for rough-
 ly three quarters of North Viet-
 nam's foreign trade.   This per-
 centage has been declining, how-
 ever, as trade with the free
 world--chiefly Japan, Hong Kong,
 Indonesia,  India, and France--
 has been increasing. Coal from
 Hongay is still the major export
 item,  accounting for about one
 third of.the total value of ex-
 ports.   In 1957, rice was  ex-
 ported in considerable quanti-
 ties, but prospects for compar-
 able amounts this year appear
 poor.   Other items for export
 in significant quantity are
 crushed apatite (a phosphatic
 fertilizer), cement, and timber,
 but these and the country's
 other exports are not available
 in sufficient bulk to permit
 North Vietnam to achieve a more
 balanced trade position in the
 near future.
 With the initiation of a
 period of economic development,
 the Hanoi regime has begun a
 crucial test of its ability to
 survive and, parenthetically,
 of the applicability of the
 Chinese model for developing
 backward Asian economies.   Hanoi's
 success will depend, to a large
 extent, on the outcome of its
 attempt to inflict socialism
 on the economy.
 There is discontent in
 both the cities and the country-
 side, which is reflected in the
 government and the party as well.

 necessary to castigate party

 TRENDS IN SOVIET SHIPBUILDING
 Since the end of World War
 II, the USSR has developed a
 highly efficient shipbuilding
 industry, with the result  that
 it ranks second in world naval
 power and first in submarine
 power.   The  Soviet  maritime'
 fleet has expanded considerably
 during this period,  along with
 the inland waterway and fishing
 fleets.
 To achieve this build-up,
 large capital outlays were made
 for the reconstruction of war-
 damaged shipyards, for the com-
 pletion of shipyards begun be-
 fore the war, and for the build-
 ing of new shipyards.  Probably
 the most important capital in-
 vestment made during this period
 was in the industry responsible
 for the production of ship com-
 ponents.  This investment was
 achieved in part through the
 appropriation of machines and
 equipment from countries over-
 run in the war and through war
 reparations.
 Priority of Naval Construction
 About 90 percent  of. the
 postwar shipbuilding effort in
 terms of value has been devoted
 to the construction of naval
 vessels.   To meet the immediate
 postwar needs for merchant ves-
 sels, the USSR turned, as it
 did before World War II, to for-
 eign sources.   It exploited ship-
 building industries in the satel-
 lites and procured vessels from
 nonbloc sources through trade
 agreements.

 ently was phased out.   Four
 shipyards were engaged in this
 program, and a total of about
 240 submarines of this class
 were produced.
 The construction of medi-
 um-range Q-class submarines
 began in 1954 and possibly is
 still continuing.   These ships
 are built only at Sudomekh
 Shipyard 196 at Leningrad, which
 had produced 43 vessels by the
 end of 1957.   A reduction in
 output in 1957 from the previous
 year seems to have resulted
 from technological difficulties
 and alterations, and does not
 indicate a phasing out of this
 model.
 The USSR may be preparing
 to produce new submarines in-

 ventional- propulsion or nuclear
 propulsion, some of which may
 be equipped for guided-missile

 The Kotlin, an improvement
 over the earlier Skorry  and
 Tallinn. was apparently modified.
 Separate  sightings.  in  1957,
 one in the Pacific and one in
 the Baltic, indicated that the
 after-gun mount had been replaced
 by a "catapult"  or   launching
 rail,   suggesting a   possible
 missile-launching installation.
 The construction  of  the
 Riga-class destroyer escort be-
 gan in 1952.                                                             About 60 of these
 ships hate been built, but the
 program appears to have been
 completely phased out in early
 1957.
 Cruisers:   Since 1949 four
 shipyards have been engaged at
 least part time in the construc-
 tion of cruisers.  A total of
 20 cruisers were laid down, of
 which only 16 have been completed.
 Destroyer and Destroyer Es-
 corts:    Construction  of  the
 Kotlin-class destroyer began in
 1952 and has continued to the
 present time, with about 30 pro-
 duced in all.   Zhdanov Shipyard
 190 in Leningrad, Shipyard 445
 in Nikolayev, and Shipyard 199
 in Komsomolsk have been engaged
 in the program.   Possibly nine
 additional vessels now are in
 varying stages of completion.

 Construction of minesweep-

 torpedo boats has continued at
 a fairly consistent rate.   Im-
 provement made in these types
 has been in the area of elec-
 tronics and in the use of gas-
 turbine propulsion and hydro-
 foil hulls.
 Merchant Vessel Construc-
 tion:   The characteristics of
 new merchant vessels proposed
 and under construction in the
 USSR suggest a change in policy
 toward  the  merchant  fleet.
 Cargo vessels and tankers, which

 tonnage and slow speeds.  At
 present, however, two new ma-
 jor vessels are under construc-
 tion, one a tanker, one a car-
 go vessel.   These vessels are
 modern in design and are,-com-
 parable to the better Western
 ships of the same type.   The
 tanker, however, is small com-
 pared with the "supertankers"
 of the West.
 The  most noteworthy non-
 naval vessel to be produced by
 the USSR is the nuclear-powered
 icebreaker Lenin, which  was
 launched on 5 December 1957 in
 Admiralty Shipyard 194 in Lenin-
 grad.   This is the first ice-
 breaker to be built in the USSR
 since the war, and is the first
 New Tanker:   Only one or
 two tankers, of an improved de-
 sign over the Kazbek, are known
 to be under construction.   One
 was laid down, in the  Baltic
 Shipyard in Leningrad about the
 first of September 1957.   Series
 production of this class will
 probably begin as soon as the
 prototype has been satisfacto-
 rily tested.   The new tanker,
 the largest ever built in the
 USSR, has a cargo-carrying ca-
 pacity of 27,000 metric tons,
 is about 660 feet long over-all,
 87 feet wide, and has a draft
 of 34 feet.   Powered by a steam
 turbine, the vessel will have
 a speed of about 18.5 knots.

 Kazbek-class Tanker:   The
 program for the production of
 the Kazbek-class tanker which
 began in 1950 or 1951 and has
 produced 48 ships appears to be
 nearing an end, although Kherson
 Shipyard 102 delivered two tank-
 ers in 1958.  Two other tankers,
 both scheduled for sale to East
 Germany, were under construction
 at the end of 1957 at the Admi"
 ralty yard in Leningrad.   Ship-
 yards engaged in this program
 have undertaken construction of
 other nonnaval vessels, with
 the result that production of
 these tankers will be sharply re-
 duced, if not wholly eliminated.
 go ships are under
 construction at Kher-
 son Shipyard 102.  As
 in the case of the new
 tanker under construc-
 tion, this type ship
 is a vast improvement
 over the cargo vessels
 presently in the mar-
 itime  fleet, and will
 be the largest  dry-
 cargo ship ever built
 in the USSR.   The new
 ship, with a cargo-
 carrying capacity of
 10,000-13,000 metric
 tons, is designed to
 haul general and grain
 cargo in relatively ice-free
 waters and also is turbine-pro-
 pelled.
 Fishing and Inland Water-
 way Vessels:  Because the fish-
 ing fleet is important not only
 in the economy of the USSR but
 also as a potential naval auxil-
 iary, the production of improved
 trawlers, seiners, loggers, and
 the like continued in 1956 and
 1957.  The capability  of  the
 fishing industry is being im-
 proved by the installation of
 electronic aids on trawlers for
 the detection of schools of
 fish, and in the construction
 of special ships to operate with
 the fishing fleets for freezing
 and  processing  the  catch  and

 transporting it between the
 fleet and the mainland.   In ad-
 dition,  a large and improved
 whale-processing ship is under
 construction,   and  a fleet of
 new and improved whale-catchers
 is to follow.
 Some of the principal ship-
 yards in the USSR once engaged
 in naval construction are now
 building vessels for the inland
 fleet; these include Krasnoye
 Sormovo Shipyard 112 in Gorkiy,
 which was the largest builder
 of submarines in the USSR.   In
 early 1956 this shipyard began
 building a series of Bolshaya
 Volga-class self-propelled dry-
 cargo river vessels.
 The inland waterways fleet
 is being improved for more rapid
 and economical transportation
 of freight and passengers. The
 trend seems to be away from the
 SECRET
 use of towed  barges  to  that
 of  pusher-type  tugs  and
 barges,   similar to  those
 used  on  the  Mississippi
 River, and  of  more  self -
 propelled dry-   and  liquid-
 cargo vessels.
 Foreign Orders
 The number of construction
 contracts placed with Western
 countries, except for Finland,
 has been sharply reduced.
 As a possible exception to
 this trend, the USSR may agree
 to purchase Japanese-built ves-
 sels because the cost of ship-
 building in Japan is low com-
 pared with that in other West-
 ern countries.   In  addition,
 the Soviet Union may be able
 to offer products attractive
 to Japan in payment.
