THE SINO.SOVIET DISPUTE 
INTER-PARTY DEVELOPMENTS AT AND AFTER THE 
RUMANIAN WORKERS PARTY CONGRESS?BUCHAREST, 20-25 JUNE 1960 
The background of the dispute (1957-1960)  
1. The present dispute between the Communist Party of the 
Soviet Union (CPSU) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) has 
its origins in differences which date back at least three years--
that is, to the summer of 1957. On the Chinese side, antecedent 
resentments may date as far back as the formative period of the 
CPC in the twenties, when Stalin's policy of alliance with the 
Kuomintang drove the CPC to disaster, as well as to the war and 
early post-war perion, when Soviet support for the Chinese Com-
munist cause was minimal and did not inhibit the stripping of 
Manchuria. There is clearly no single cause for the current 
dispute. Rather, it would appear, an accumulation of Chinese 
policies and actions increasingly displeased and challenged 
Khrushchev and, presumably, a majority of the Soviet leadership. 
In the field of domestic policy, it is now known that Mao's "Let 
a hundred flowers bloom" program aroused Soviet doubts about 
its usefulness. The program for the "great leap forward" 
beginning in early 195$ and the communes program, adopted by 
the CPC in May 1958 were readily recognisable as s. considerable 
irritant in Sino-Soviet relations by the silent treatment which 
they received in the Soviet Union. 
2. Disagreement over foreign policy manifested itself in 
August 1958 when Khrushchev, after four days of discussion with 
Mao Tse-tung, publicly rejected, on 5 August, Vestern proposals 
for a summit meeting within the U. N. Security Council on the 
crisis in the Middle East?proposals which he had accepted in 
July. Nevertheless, on 23 August the Chinese began shelling of 
the off-shore islands. On 23 May 1958 the Coplimder of the 
Chinese Air Force predicted that China would make atomic bombs 
"in the not too distant future" and the Chinese press ceased to 
amismaimea.

li?i plan for an

for "the Far East and the entire Pacific Basin' e 21st 
CPS, Cngrse a in February 1959. Chinese reactions were 
not enthusiastic, and, from April 1939. an, refurtnc. to the 
plan disappeared altogether. In the light of these and other 
indicetions, it Can be fairly assumed that Soviet unwillingness 
to deliver atomic weapons to Chinese control had become a 
serious issue. It is now known that the Soviets cited as the 
reason for their reluctance their apprehension over Chinese 
policies and pronouncements in the external field which were 
in conflict with Khrushchevis "peaceful coexistence" tactics, 
which affirmed that global or limited war need not be avoided, 
and Which objected to Khrushchev's aid programs for "bourgeois" 
regimes in underdeveloped countries on the grounds that they 
would delay revolution. Chinese objections to peaceful coexistence 
tactics manifested themselves after 1957 in the deliberations of 
the International Communist Front organisations, especially 
within the World Peace Council and the International Union of 
Students...two organisations which were most directly and in-
tensely engaged in building their appeal on the unity campaign 
so typical of the peaceful coexistence perioe. They desired to 
Involve bourgeois and nationalist groups in mass action and 
therefore advocated informal conversations, negotiations, 
and concessions to such groups. The Chinese refused to "sit 
around the table" with them except in formal meetings of 
designated representatives, and resisted Soviet efforts to 
broaden the scope of concessions on program and organisation 
questions. Chinese resistance was particularly manifest after 
the Soviet decision of June 1959 concerning Ithrushcbev's visit 
to the United States. 
. In August 1959, the Chinese overran Indian border 
Longju and reopened the border dispute wialt India, after 
years of quiet. The Soviet position on this dispute signifi. 
failed to give full endorsement to the Chillt61V claims, 
earlier Chinese repressive actions in Tibet had been

Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001200240023-7 
promptly supported as just and as an "internal affair." 
Khrushchev, as was known later, did not interpret the reopening 
of the dispute as a mere attempt to register opposition to his 
trip to the United States, but as an un-Marxist blunder which 
needlessly undermined Indian neutralist attitudes and potential 
value in the peace and disarmament campaign and impaired the 
appeal of CP India. When Khrushchev visited Peiping, after 
his trip to the United States, for the October anniversary cele-
brations in 1959. the Si1110?117Lgon dispute was dne topic of discussion 
sad it is virtually certain that Khrushchev presented his views on 
improving USSR-U.S. relations. Sine-Soviet discussions were 
? unsatisfactory, however, and no communique was published. 
According to three widely separated and reliable sources, in

November 1959, V. Uyitchev, Chief of the Agitprop Department 
of the CPSU, published an article in  Problems of Peace and 
Socialism that justified the policy of peaceful coexistence as Vtlase 
struggle on the international plane" and significantly noted Lenin's 
criticism of "Left Communists." It is known that the Chinese 
have since been accused of criticising the November 1959 joint 
program of the European parties, which is clearly based upon 
the same premises as the article. In December 1959, Khrushchev 
warned the Chinese in stating at the Hungarian Party Congress 
that "we must all synchronise our watches." 
4. In January 1960, the Chinese positions hardened. At 
the Rome meeting of the Presidential Committee of the World 
Peace Council in January 1960 it transpired that the Chinese 
had charged the USSR with seeking to isolate China in the 
interest of achieving a =Lofts vivendi  with the U.S. A reliable 
source states that the USSR in January 1960 informally broached 
to the Chinese the idea that the Sino-Soviet differences required 
discussion, only to be told by the Chinese that the differences 
were between the parties and should not be mentioned. The 
CPC appears to have reached during January important decisions 
which had a major effect on the dispute. On 21 January the

mid.April 1960 the Chinese took advantage 
sexy of Lenin's birth to make their most 
on the theoretical innovations developed by the 
CPSU at and after the 10th Party Congress in January 1956. 
Using oblique but unmistakable arguttemts. the Chinese 
challenged the premises underlying Soviet foreign policy and 
by implication disparaged Ithrushchev's stature as a Communist 
theorist. The Chinese attack comprised three major statements: 
two articles in the party's theoretical monthly Red mks (issues 
alls. 7 and 14 1 sad 16 APT11), the first entitled "On Imperialism 
as the Source of War in Modern Times" end the second entitled

Lu Tingd, gave a speech in Peiping which incorporated many 
of the arguments of the "Long Live Leninism" article. The 
divergences between the two speeches were so great that when 
one Commie:dot party seriously affected by the dispute. the 
Indian party, published both speeches side by side in the $ May 
lima of its newspaper New Age, without comments, its action 
aroused considerable comment and created confusion among 
party members.

party discussions of the Sino-Soviet differences.

Albania were led by per eons of national stature equal to that 
01.101ruehchev, but the late arrival of Comullra of Feland 
and the early departure of Novotny of Csechosievehis, suggest 
that this top4evel representation was organized on abort 
notice. The leader of She Chinese delegation, Film; Chen, 
was clearly outranked by this group. Fifty parties were 
represented at the congress. Twenty.ftve of the thirty.five 
bon-bloc fraternal delegations identified as present were 
composed of second and third echelon party leaders and 
none of the more significant Fre* World parties, except 
Chile and Syria, were represented by their leaders. 
19. The Soviet delegation to Bucharest included 
B. Ponontarev and Y. A. Andropov, the heads of the two 
Central Committee sections for relations with the non*bloc 
parties and bloc parties, respectively. During the first days 
of the congress they and their colleagues concentrated on 
briefing fraternal delegates. It is knovm that a group of 
En lishospeaking delegates and a second group comprising 
those who spoke Spanish were called together separately and 
briefed from a long letter which the CPSU intended to issue 
to all parties, The letter had apparently been either corn. 
plated or revised at this last moment, for it contained the 
Soviet account of the Moscow oxchaages of 17 June and 
explained the Soviet view of how the inter?party discussion 
should be handled. The inclusion of Wu lisiu-ch'uan, the 
deputy director of the CPC's International Liaison Depart 
merit. as one of the four Chinese delegates suggests that the 
Chine.. too planned to exploit their supporters and acquaintances 
among the delegates.

of points to the 12 Party Declaration, he emphasised the 
doctrinal statements previously highlighted in the Chinese 
criticisms of the Soviet line. He praised the Cuban and Alger an 
struggles and said that war could be averted and peace pre-
served by aiding liberation movements and revolutionary 
struggles. He also sailed for Communist unity and the 
"broadest possible anti.imperialist united front with this unity 
at its core." He further charged, as his party had done 
earlier, that the imperialists were using modern revisionists 
(Tito) to disrupt Comnamist unity, and he called ler a struggle 
to the end against modern revisionism. He made no mention 
of "peaceful coexistence." an omission for which he was later 
upbraided by Khrushchev. It was on this day that the CPSU

from 50 parties was convened. This ameond meeting, a full* 
scale debate, was opened by the first secretary of the 
Rumanian party. Cateerglska..Dej, who read the draft corn 
mutaique. A number of other delegate' then spoke, including, 
at least, representatives of East Germany, the UK, France, 
and Italy. In fact, according to one source, more than 
twenty delegates spoke before the Chinese representatives 
took the floor. The Soviet caucusing and briefings had had

erred in general to the Soviet line of argtuttent. It is also 
lb noting that PasPolovi the Soviet representative at this 
reportedly did not speak. This tactic...in which

and is usually employed to permit the CPSU to have the last

merely as one more partisan participant in a debate. When

line taken by most of the preceding speakers, chartists that 
It Was unrealistic, slanderous, and groundless, and based 
upon incomplete evidence. He also criticised negative 
attitudes toward certain Chinese domestic policies and 
asserted that the reports prepared for the WFTU Peiping 
meeting had contained attacks against the communes and great.. 
step forward programs. (Se. note.) He refuted charges 
that the Chinese had not played their full part in the peace 
struggle, referring to their support of /Chruslichev's visit to 
the U.S. and to Mau En.lai's negotiations with many countrie

Be els* insisted that the Chine.. had supported peaceful 
coexistence, noting in particular their role in the 1935 Bandung 
conference. According to another source, the Chinese rep. 
resentative also stated that China would stand on the Moscow 
declaration of 1957, supported the idea that a reappraisal of 
the international situation was necessary, and endorsed a 
proposal that the reappraisal should be carried out on a 
multiparty basis. Pospelov too endorsed this proposal. This 
Chinese reaction appears to have been mainly defensive; what 
new facts the Chinese delegate brought forward were apparently 
selected to prove that the Soviet case was t biased and and 
incomplete presentation. 
(Note. This Chinese charge is particularly interesting 
because the two main WFTU reports presented at Peiping, by 
Marcel Bras and Ibrahim Zakaria, did not criticize these 
Chinese policies. In fact, the Bras report contained two 
laudatory references to the communes. It is known, however, 
that on 2 June (i.s.. three days before the delayed opening of 
the Peiping meeting) the Chinese informed V. Grishin, the 
head of the Soviet delegation, that the treatment of the peace 
and disarmament themes in the draft V rTu reports was 
inacceptable and would be openly attacked if the drafts were 
not amended before presentation.. It is also known that these 
sections were not amended to meet Chinese demands?in fact, 
a number of amendments actually made in the final report 
strengthened the WTI'U's support for the Soviet peace line. 
At least one amendment, dealing with the question of Free 
World economic trade and aid with under-developed countries, 
was, in fact, of such a nature as to be particularly unpalatable 
to the Chinese. It has *leo been reported that the French 
representatives at Bucharest were particularly incensed with 
the Chinese for having brought this question into the debate, 
but no one is reported to have refuted the Chinese charge as 
untrue. One report provides a clue to a plausible explanation 
of this matter by noting that the Chinese said that "such a 
WFTU report would have been rejected by the Chinese people."

It seems likely then that the Chines* charges referred to 
original draft of the WTTU report prepared by Louis SsUlant. 
The offending language probably was edited out. at Soviet 
insistence, before Bras actually delivered the report to the 
council. The involvement of the two Frenchmen. Saillant and 
Bras, in this matter would explain the vigorous reaction of the 
French delegates at Bucharest.) 
Z3. Delegates at this second meeting received a numb?r 
of papers, including en 80-plue page Chinese translation of a 
CPSU document. This document appears to be a critical factor 
In the further development of the dispute. Its existence has 
been reported by a number of independent and widely separated 
sources, and at least time reports indicate that it was a sharp. 
wide ranging, and bitterly critical summary of Soviet criticisms 
of the CPC. One source has reported that, prior to the Bucharest 
congress, the CPSU addressed a "sharp" letter to the CPC 
embodying its criticisms of Chinese doctrines and actions in.-
luding charges against the Chinese foreign policy toward India 
and Algeria, as well as charges that Chinese actions were 
straying "bourgeois" confidence in Communist desires for 
peace end arousing Afro 'Asian suspicions of international 
Communism. The fact that the CPSU sent a letter "raising 
various issues" to the CPC was also stated by Vans Chen at 
Bucharest. A third source, describing the contents of the 
document, also notes its sharp.tone and its charges of Chinese 
tors in the foreign policy toward India. In addition, this 
source says that it criticised Chinese nationalism and Chinese 
non-cooperation with the USSR in military matters. On the 
basis of this series of reports it seems probable that the 
Chinese?translated Soviet document distributed at this second 
meeting on ZS June was in fact the full text of the "sharp" 
CPR! letter to the CPC (see above pars U). If this was the 
case its presentation by the Chinese was clearly a part of 
their effort to set the record straight, and undoubtedly 
disrupted the Soviet tactical plans for the meeting. Such a 
significant decision must necessarily have been mode by the

CPC Central Committee, probably during its rly June 
meeting, and suggests the CPC's attitude ?toward the 
Bucharest meeting was predicated, at least to some extent, 
on the Use of this tactic. There is some question whether 
librushchev was present at this first day of debate. At least 
one source indicates that he was present, but there is no 
evidence that he participated in the discussion. 
24. On 26 June came the final meeting, another closed 
*ion that was attended by those present on the preceding 
it was at this second installment of the debate the 
chev personally presented his general indictment of 
Chinese and provoked a heated exchange with Vent Chen. 
A number of reports state that the Khrushchev sppech opened 
the proceedings. The speech was a long one and reportedly 
Involved direct attacks on Liao Tse-tung, comparing him to 
Stalin as "always thinking in his own terms" and "formulating 
theories without coming into contact with the events of the 
modern world." One source states that Khrushchev's speech 
was arranged at short notice. The reporting on the speech 
suggest* that it was at least partly extemporaneous, with 
Khroshchev injecting facts, anecdotes, and direct charge*. 
that effectively demolished the attitude of restraint, tact, 
and adherence to principle wlich the CPSV had previously 
tried to maintain in the debate. Speaking angrily, with 
violent gestures, he described the CPC doctrine* as ultra-
leftist, as dogmatic, and, finally, as left revisionist. He 
said the Chinese did not understand the nature of modern 
war, and rejected Chinese protests over the fact that the 
USSR had failed to support China in her border dispute with 
India characterizing the dispute as a conflict of purely 
national interests in which the interests of world Communism 
re not involved. There is reason to suspect that his attack 
o included charges directed against some elements of 
r Communist parties of complicity with the Chinese. He 
attacked Pleng Chen himself, chiding him for his failure to 
refer to peaceful coexistence in his public address to the

congress on the 22nd. In generalapparently reiterated in 
ronger and less ambiguous terms virtually all the charges 
embodied in the original CPSU letter to the CPC. Since 
s speech is described by sem* sources as a systematic and 
detailed presentation of the Soviet charges, it seems likely 
that it was in fact built around the argumentation of the draft 
ciruclar letter of 21 June earlier shown to Free World 
delegate., 
25. Pleas Chen is reported to have replied very 
heated tonna. He said he had asked for on to he 
held on equal terms, and that the CPC respected the CPSU 
as an "elder brother" but not as a "father" party. Counter. 
attacking strongly, he accused Khrushanv of orgsaieing the 
meeting to make an attack on the CPC and Mao Tse.tung and 
to cover up a Soviet effort to undermine the prestige of the 
CPC. He defended Mao'es "more in contact with the modern 
world than Xhruslachev, and more active than ever since 
leaving the government chairmanship." Referring to 
Khrushchev himself in terms reminiscent of the 16 June Red 
Fin article, he charged that HIChrushchev's policy is a policy 
of revisionism, creating illusions about imperialism and under 
estimating its true nature." Speaking of the abrupt shifts in 
Khrushchev's policy toward the imperialist powers, he repor 
tei 
asked the delegates whether "any conclusione can be drawn re 
gerding 1Chrushchevis policy toward the imperialist powers." 
Hs stated finally that the CPC had no trust in Xhrushchev's 
analysis of the world situation and especially his policy toward 
the imperialists. Refuting Ithrushchev's charges that the 
Chinese did not understand modern 'oar, Pleas said the Chinese 
had proved in Korea as well as against the Japanese that they 
have more experience than other peoples of the world. He 
further registered a proteet, saying that he had asked for delay 
in the iseuance of the communique but had been told on 24 June 
that It had to be aimed ia the interest of unity. He stand for 
the benefit of other delegates the instructions under which he 
was working, and said that if the communique were published

In a general discussion. Todor Zhivkov first spoke d gave

position. Khrushchev reportedly ended the session by saying 
that further bilateral discussions between the CPSU and the 
CPC were necessary. 
21. A commission (or comm et up

arties were to present their views. Divergent reports 
on e composition of the committee have been received. In 
Emeriti they agree that the committee was to involve about 
parties and that all the bloc parties were to be rop-
ed. At least two separate reports state that the polities 
gentina, Cuba, Brazil, Japan, and West Gerrnaity were 
to be represented on the commission. One of these re 
supported by a third separate one, also states that Italy 
since were to participate. Other perties to participate, 
listed only in single reports, are those of the U.S., the U.K., 
India. Syria. and Australia. At least one source states that 
the commission was to be composed only of representative* 
of the bloc parties. The terms of reference of this COIXOW I Sian 
are not known. The commission has since been called to meet 
in Moscow at the end of September. ALseparate CPSU committee 
has allegedly been set up as well, to prepare a new CPSU 
? document on the dispute. It seems probable that the CPSU is 
plownong to use it in November as the draft letter of 21 June 
was used at Bucharest, to predetermine the outcome of the 
conference. According to one source. Khrushchev gave in.

results of these plenums to be disseminated at all 1eels of

28. The final co unique approved by the fraternal 
delegates was relessed by TAMS in Moscow on 27 Sun.. 
According to one source, it was adopted primarily to conceal 
the fact that the meeting had fated to accomplish anything, 
but the CPSU, particularly lihrushchev, clearly wanted it 
as a device to exert pressure for prompt resolution of the 
dispute. A short and virtually mechanical reaffirmation of 
the validity of the 12 Party Declaration of November 1957, 
its text did not in fact clarify any of the issues in the dispute. 
This became apparent in a few days with the appearance of 
the Soviet and Chinese press statements on the communique. 
The signatures of the 12 Bloc parties (including the CPC) 
registered on 24 June, and the unanimous approval given by 
the fifty parties represented were to prove the only significant 
feature of the communique. 
29. The principal result. of the Bucharest tinge appear 
to be the following. The Chinese succeeded in making known 
to a large audience of bloc and non-bloc Communist party 
gates their strong exceptions to Khrushchevos policies and 
orne of the less "principled" actions taken against them by 
the CPSU. They may have hoped that their adamant tactics 
would create fear of an open split and thus force the Soviets 
to break down or compromise. Their actions left the Soviet 
and their supporters in other parties little CAOL4411 but to 
defend the Soviet position as the supreme suthority and policy 
maker in the international Communist movement and to apply 
against the Chinese all their influence within the bloc and Free 
World Communist parties. It would appear that the final

with the 1957 Moscow Decleration and Peace Ma:life:go. The 
CPSU had made no move against these Chime. statements, 
considering it necessary to bold a meeting to discuss them.

? 33. On 6 February 1940, this Catrai Canunittee of the 
CPSU proposed a discussion to resolve the dlffersnc?a. The 
Chinese retailed to attend such a meeting and began publicising 
their views. 
34. At the time of the meeting of the General Council of 
the WFTU in Peking in early June, the Chinese revealed to 
the Soviets their great dissatisfaction with CPSU positions 
and they also told other Communists of their attitude. On 
Z JUJU Liu Ning-yi told Grishin that the Chinese were very 
dissatisfied with the position of the WITU one question of 
peace and disarmament. Liu Ning-yi said that "to sit down at 
the same table with imperialists" meant the "betrayal of ell 
mankind". He warned ?dab that U the report of the WETU 
were not changed, the Chinese would criticize the WFTU and 
expo** its "right opportunism." 
3. At a session of the General Council, Liu Ning?yi 
presented views that differed from the Soviet positions, the 
CPSU document charged. Than. at a suppor and meeting to 
which the Chinese Politburo invited some delegates, LAu 
Shao-,chi said that there wore important differences of opinion 
among the Communist Parties. Tang Hein0441ini then spoke 
on "War and Peace", accusing the Soviets of errors in the

overboard" the Moscow Declaration--at the some time, 
according to the CPSU document, as he himself contradicted 
the Moscow Declaration. He attacked Soviet efforts to negotiate 
with the West as 11 "betraysl" a world Communism. Chou 
En.lai was going to *peak, but the delegates aeserted that they

of the Communist Porties.

expressed against their ottitude, they would not speak in the 
WFTU sessions; but they did so nevertheless. even in 
discussion with non?Corrirnunist delegates. Then, the 
Chinese speekers at the WFTU meeting tried to impose the 
Chinese line on the WFTU and openly to line the WFTU up 
against the CPSU.

were distributing "Long Live Leninism" and o

39. It is necessary to discuss the problems of the 
"character of the present epoch", "war and peace", "cod.

the changes in the correlation of class forcer and that they 
misunderstand and misinterpret Lenin's thesis. The Chinese 
analysis is "incomplete" and it conflicts with the Soviet 
cheracteriastion of the "epoch" as oat also of "disintegration 
of imperialism, transition to socialism, and of formation and 
consolidation of the world system of socialism." Developing 
further the well-established Soviet concepts in this regard, the

think that there could be a world without wars and without 
ms so long as imperialism exists. At a public session 
of the WFTU, members of the Chinese Central Committee 
launched a polemic against the Pease manifesto which had 
been signed by "all" Parties, including the Chinese. 
47. The CPSU document declared that peaceikil co-
tence means "gaining time" for the "consolidellon of 
Socialist system and the acceleration of the building of 
socialism and Communism." The "Communist Parties 
cannot permit society to be thrown back hundred of years' 
and the destruction of "hundreds of millions" of people. 
46. It is Impossible to accept the arguments of 
"'WS toed not fear war. Atom bombs are pap 
ger* rased by the iroperialistil to subjugate people. The 
losses Fron2 war will be compensated by the victory of 
socialism. " 
49. The Soviet position, the CPSU document said, is 
that ten or fifteen years of peace will assure the supremacy 
of Socialism and it will then be possible to exclude war, "even 
if capitalism remains in part of the world." (The document 
cited Lenin in support of this policy.)

51. The Chinese say that coexistence me lass peace". 
This is wrong. The Soviets never included within the concept 
of coexistence relations between colonies and colonialist 
countries, between dependent and imperialist countries, 
between the proletariat and the exploiters. Coexistence, on 
the contrary, is a "form of class war" on the international 
level. It opens up possibilities for solidarity with the masses 
for the eventual defeat of capitalism. (The document cited 
the November 1959 Rome "Appeal" of the 17 West European 
CPO. 
52. The Chinese say that, in connecti 
for national liberation, "the CPSU is flirting with the nati 
bourgeoisie" and "abandoning class positions." This is 
wrong. The Soviet position on participation of the national 
bourgeoisie in the national liberation struggle is "Leninist". 
53. Soviet economic aid to the "liberated countries" 
Is justified by the fact that "objectively" such aidpromotU 
the causeic4Aeakens imperialism. The Chinese 
say that the policy, should be "revised" on the ground that 
when the national bouueoisie gains power it loses its ability 
to fight imperialism /India.. Egypt. and Indonesia were 
cited/ and "are themselves becoming imperialists". 
54. The Soviet?nswered. this by saying that it is 
necessary not to "skip stages in the revolution". To do 
so can cause "serious danger." It is essential to "look at 
the correlation of class forces." The "imperialists" try to 
exploit "splits in the national liberation movements". The 
Communists must try to increase their "friends" among 
the neutralists. This used to  be the policy of the Chinese,

61. At the IUS meeting at Tunis In Iebruary 1960, the 
Chinese had opposed "broader contacts with student organi-
zations in capitalist countries" and had instead emphasized 
the need for "u:ncompromising struggle". At a WFDY meeting 
in March, and at the Afro-Asian conference in April, the 
Chinese had opposed discussion of disarmament on the ground 
that the "call for disarmament lulls the popular masses and 
demobilizes them in the struggle against imperialism." 
62, As early as 1949, at the conference of Asian trade 
unions in Peking. the Chinese had r ropoeed "unfolding bitter 
struggle in colonial and semi-colonial countries' "and formation 
of "liberation armies" under Party direction. This bad been 
done without consulting the Parties and had helped the "imperiali 
in their fight against the VETT.% The Chinese had later revised 
this attitude, the document said. 
63. In May 1954, the Chinese Central Committee had sent 
e CPSU a report cf the Communist fraction of the Chine.. 
unions which agreed with the WFTU position'. However 
Mese were opposing WFTU decisions Which applied to 
all countries. This caused trouble between the WITTY and 
some CPs. "Now", the CPSU document said, "the Chinese 
talk of NkFTU opportunism, and this threatens the unity of its 
ranks.

64. Chinese divergence from the 1957 Declaration and  
ice Manifesto. The CPSU charged the Qtinese with departing 
the Moscow documents of 1957 on sin main count.. 
1. They had "revised" the characterisation of the 
pre epoch's so as to make it read that this is "az epoch 
of wars and revolutions". 
2. They say that the "Leninist pr pie of peaceful 
coiucistencess1 as it is spelled out in the Moscow Declarations 
creates "illusions" and that "peaceful coexistence is impossib e 
it only gratifies the imperialists ane enables them to murder 
the people* of Asia and Africa with impunity." 
3. 3. The Chinese say that the thesis in the Moscow 
Declaration that "the struggle for peace /1s7 the foremost 
task" of the Communist Parties is "erroneous and anti-Leninist' 
and that it encourages the "delusion that there can be peace 
with capitalism." 
4. The Chines, reject the Moscow De n' 
thesis on" 'different form. of transition' "as corning from 
an" 'incomrect understanding of " 
5. The Chinese question the thesis of the Moscow 
Declaration that the Zeth CPR; Congress had opened "a new 
stage" in the international movement, and they want to re. 
open the question of the "cult of personality." The Chinese 
had endorsed the CPSU's action regarding the "cult of Stalin". 
and Mao-Tse.tung himself had done so at the 1957 mo?covir 
meetings. The new proposal to reopen the discussion "de. 
tracts from important Party tasks, end weakens the struggle 
against the consequences of the cult of personality" in some 
other ituttes? the document declared.

had disagreed with the November 1959 "Appeal" of .e' teen 
West European CPs and had called *Li mlocuznent "opportunist". 
In this way. the Soviets say. the Chinese have set themselves 
up as the "judges over the group of moat experienced parties'.
