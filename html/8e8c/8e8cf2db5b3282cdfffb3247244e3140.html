 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 1.   USSR.   New Soviet sea map caps 10-year labor:  A recent Soviet broad-
 cast was devoted to what was described as the first detailed "Sea Atlas"
 in the world.  This Atlas was produced after ten years' labor on the
 initiative of Shakalsky, the outstanding Soviet cartographer and oceano-
 grapher, and the first volume of the series was published in 1950.
 The creators of the Atlas were said to have put considerable effort
 into restoring the priority of Russian geographers and navigators in
 geographical discoveries.  In addition, clarification was sought for the
 names of archijelagos,-islands;-peninsulas, bays, and straits first dis-
 covered and named by Russian explorers.
 Reference was made in the broadcast to a recently discovered. map
 of the Russian empire of the s.evente.enth_c.entury_in.which Alaska, the
 Aleutians, and other lands are marked as discovered by Russian navi-
 gators.  Thanks to this map, it is,,now possible "to establish accurately
 the real names of the geographical points which were later renamed by
 the American colonizers."  (R FBIS, 28 Dec 51)
 Comment:  This is a good example of post-war Russian chauvinism
 which has been frequently manifested in numerous claims of scientific.
 discoveries.  In this case, British Admiralty maps were also found in
 need of correction.  "Distortions" introduced by Japanese geographers
 particularly regarding Korea were obliterated, and considd*ble help
 was said to have been derived from the "new maps published by the.
 Government of the Korean People's Democratic, Republic."
 2,   ALBANIA.  Soviet planes reported in Albania;  An Albanian exile news
 report published in Rome states that Russian technicians have ac.lem-
 bled 40 planes at airfields near the.capital Tirana.  The planes
 reportedly were shipped dismantled from the USSR.  (R FBIS Ticker,
 27 Dec 51)
 Comment:  The French Minister in, Tirana informed the US Embassy inBelgrade
 in March 1951 that two YAK-9 aircraft had been seen flying over Tirana.
 Subsequently, in August 1951,                      reported that there      25X1 C
 were 21 or 22 Soviet YAK-9 and Stormovik aircraft in Tirar.a.  Periodic
 reports have, been received that the USSR was shipping crated planes to
 Albania.
 3.   YUGOSLAVIA.  Yugoslavia's 1952 budget announced:  In announcing the 1952
 Federal budget totaling 232 billion dinars ($940  million dollars),

 Approved For R&se 2002/05/20 : CIA-RDP79T01146AI0700020001-3
 Boris Kidric, chairman of the State Economic Council, stated that the
 Yugoslav Government hoped that the West would cover the anticipated
 Yugoslav deficit of 189 million dollars.  Kidric explained that "we
 have a moral right to expect this assistance from the West because we
 are exposed to more difficulties than any other country in Europe
 today."  He added that the Yugoslav requirements were modest compared
 with the amount of American aid given to other European countries since
 1948.
 Expenditures for defense and defense industries will not exceed
 the 1951 allotment according to Kidric.  They will total. 210 billion
 dinars (700 million dollars at the new rate of exchange), which is
 reportedly 23.7 per cent of Yugoslavia's national income. 30 per cent
 of the nation's overall budget,. and 74 per cent of the federal budget.
 The total national expenditures which include the federal, republic,
 and local budgets,"will approximate 570 billion dinars (1.8 billion
 dollars).
 Kidric-contended that Yugoslavia was making only the "absolute
 minimum" capital construction in 1952, involving some 128 billion
 dinars (430 million dollars) or 13.6 per cent of the national income.
 Beginning in 1953, Kidric said, the main emphasis of the capital ins
 vestment program will be directed to eGriculture, and he added that
 with completion of the capital investment program, Yugoslavia would
 be in a position to wipe out all deficits and to balance its inter-
 national payments.  (U NY Times, 29 Dec 51)
 Comment; Yugoslav statistics are quite unreliable.  Nonetheless,
 last year's budget figure totaled  172.6 billion dinars. The large
 increase in the dinar value of the 1952 budget arises from this year's
 higher price levels.  However, a comparative analysis cannot be made
 until the bases for computations and additional statistics are avail-
 able..
 Yugoslavia's rate of capital investment during the past few years
 has approached a figure of one-third of the national income.  Last
 year's budget was a composite of federal, republic and local expendi-
 tures, and the term "defense industries" was not included in the
 military breakdown.  This semantic maneuver makes it virtually imposs-
 ible to differentiate between capital investment and strict military
 expenditures; however, the implication is that no significant change
 will be undertaken in either of these crucial fields.
 4.        Use of UN Peace Commission in Yugoslav-Hungarian border dispute
 suggested:  The Yugoslav-Hungarian border dispute over a small island
 located in the Mura River provides a. suitable  occasion for the

 Yugoslavs to request an-investigation by the newly created LN Balkan
 subcommission, in the opinion of Ambassador Allep.  The Ambassador
 believes that a Yugoslav request for the services of the subcommission
 would be particularly appropriate at this time in view of the strong
 UN support recently given to Yugoslavia's resolution citing Cominform
 pressures.  (S Belgrade 841, 29 Dec 51)
 Comment:  Heretofore, Yugoslavia has opposed the presence of any
 UN "watchdog unit."
 Although Hungarian occupation of the island, on 20 December has
 created a potentially explosive border situation, the Yugoslav
 Government has given no indication of unilateral retaliatory action.
 On 27 December, however, Yugoslavia officially protested the occupation
 of the island and demanded the immediate withdrawal of Hungarian
 soldiers.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1.  INDIA.  Congress Party expected to win Indian national elections:  The US
 Embassy in New Delhi feels that preliminary results in the Indian national
 elections foreshadow a Congress Party majority in Parliament and in vir-
 tually all of the states.  (S New Delhi 2258, Joint Weeka 52, 28 Dec 51)
 2.  BURMA/CHINA.  Chinese Communists reportedly concentrating near Burma border:
 The Chinese Communists have concentrated "several thousand"' troops in
 Paoshan, near the Sino-Burma boundary, according to reports received by a
 25X1 C                      from the hill tribes which inhabit the area.  The
 25X1 C                         the hill people are fearful of Chinese aggression against
 Burma during the present dry season.                                                25X1 A
 Comment:   Chinese Communist ability to intervene in Burma on short
 notice has been recognized for some time.  Such intervention could be ex-
 plained on a number of grounds, particularly the continued presence of
 organized Chinese Nationalist forces on the Burma side of the border.  In
 this connection, the Peiping radio has recently accused the US 7th Fleet
 of ferrying 70,000 Nationalist troops from Taiwan to reinforce those on
 the Sino-Burma border.
 3.        Chinese Nationalists reportedly preparing new attack on Yunnan: The
 US Embassy in Rangoon reports that the British Consul in Maymyo in northern
 Burma has been informed by the Sawbwa of Kengtung State that the Chinese
 Nationalist forces in the Sino-Burma border area are intending to return
 to Yunnan in February.  (S Rangoon 614, 1 Jan 52)
 Comment:.  The Chinese Nationalist forces in Burma are incapable of con-
 ducting military action against the Communists in Yunnan, and are not like-
 ly to cross the border except as defectors or as small bandit gangs which
 will use Burma as sanctuary.
 4.  INDONESIA.  Foreign Minister sees small prospect of satisfactory progress
 in current negotiations with Netherlands:  Foreign Minister Subardjo told
 American. Ambassador Cochran that he sees small prospect of progress in
 The Hague discussions before 15 January--the date on which the Indonesian
 Government plans to review its policy on the negotiations.  Subardjo said
 he is strongly opposed to unilateral abrogation of the Netherlands-
 Indonesian Union but that popular Indonesian resentment of the Dutch at-
 titude is making his government's position increasingly difficult.  (S
 Djakarta 920, 28 Dec 51)

 TOP SECRET
 Comment:  The National Party, the second largest in Indonesia, has
 vigorously and persistently criticized the cabinet's policy on the current
 negotiations with the Dutch.       Along with Communist elements, it has de-
 manded the recall of the Indonesian delegation to The Hague and the uni-
 lateral abrogation of the Netherlands-Indonesian Union and of other Nether-
 lands-Indonesian agreements signed in 1949.
 5.        Government has no plans to negotiate trade agreement with USSR:1
 Foreign Minister Subardjo commented to US Ambassador Cochran regarding
 a. press story on Indonesian-Soviet trade negotiations in London that his
 government has taken no decision toward entering trade negotiations with
 Soviet Russia and has no plans for such.  He said the Indonesian Parlia-
 ment definitely would not ratify any agreement even if the government
 should negotiate it.  (C Djakarta 921, 28 Dec 51)
 Comm en a  The Indonesian Government has negotiated no diplomatic ex-
 change with the Soviet Union, nor is it known to have responded to any
 Soviet overtures for trade negotiations.  Trade agreements with certain
 of the Satellites, originated during the period of Dutch sovereignty, have
 been renewed, but the opening of negotiations now with the USSR would be
 out of keeping with the present trend of Indonesian foreign policy.

 "Chinese Nationalist merchandise" and had no basis in fact.  I  -
 mitted that Chinese Communist forces in this area are in sufficient
 strength to hit Indochina hard and fast if Peiping so decides.
 25X1X
 "'definite information"` that Chinese Communist forces in Yunnan and Kwangsi
 now number about three hundred thousand.  This report also states that
 clothing, military supplies, and small quantities of food are continuing
 to flow into Indochina, that the railway  from Nanning to Pinghsiang
 will apparently not be extended, and that there are no regular Chinese
 Communist troop  units in Indochina.  (S Hanoi 435, 31 Dec; S OARMA
 Saigon MC 386-51, 31 Dec 51)
 Commen :,  It is certain that the number of troops in the provinces
 bordering on Indochina has been increasing, but it is unlikely that the
 number of confirmed troops is as high as three hundred thousand.

 7.  CHINA/INDONESIA.  Chinese reportedly get Indonesian rubbers
 25X1 C
 a Chinese bankder several months ago attempted to con-
 tract for rubber in Indonesia.  Several Indonesian firms reportedly re-
 fused to deal with him, but agreement was finally reached with one company.
 This company is known to have bid for rubber in Djakarta last November at
 prices substantially above current market quotations.
 The rubber acquired through this company was allegedly shipped to
 Singapore for reshipment to China.  (S Bangkok 1348, 29 Dec 51)
 Comment:  The Government of Indonesia prohibits the export of rubber
 to China, but evasions of the embargo are frequently reported.  Legal
 shipments of rubber from producing areas to China have not been made since
 a Polish vessel lifted over 5,000 tons from Ceylon last October, and
 Chinese Communist agents are known to be-making energetic efforts  to
 acquire additional supplies.
 CHINA.  Chinese Communists reportedly have temporarily given up plans for
 invasion of Chinmen and Formosa:  A prisoner taken in a Chinese Nationalist
 guerrilla raid on the mainland reportedly has stated that the Chinese
 Communists have temporarily given up plans to invade Chinmen Island and
 Formosa because too many troops are occupied both in Korea and in anti-
 guerrilla warfare on the China mainland.   (S ALUSNA Taipei, Joint Weeka
 52, 29 Dec 51)
 Comments  Other sources have recently reported that Chinmen Island
 would be invaded in early 1952.
 Anti-Communist guerrillas in East China are not considered signifi-
 cant enough to cause Peiping to divert sizable numbers of troops to that.
 area for their suppression.
 25X1 C
 secret settlement with Britain and France:
 a Chinese Communist representative was in
 Hong Kong in December to negotiate secretly a temporary settlement in the
 Far East with Britain and France.  Peiping's representative reportedly
 promised Colonial Secretary Lyttelton that, in exchange for admission to
 ..,the UN and UN trusteeship over Formosa, Peiping would "yield"'' in the
 Korean talks and would "guarantee the safety" of Hong Kong, Singapore and
 Indochina. F_                    I the Chinese official, after reaching
 "'preliminary agreement" with Lyttelton, conferred with Mao Tse-tung and
 then departed for France by air for further discussions with British and
 French officials.

 100 million US dollars worth in 1950 alone.
 Comments  For the first time in many years China may have enough
 domed cotton for its textile industry in 1952.  The Communists have made
 strenuous efforts to increase cotton production, which was about 1.7 million
 bales in 1949 and 2.4 million in 1952.  In an-effort to meet domestic re-
 quirements of about three million bales anz*ually, the Communists have im-
 ported large quantities of raw cotton since their takeover in 1949--nearly

 25X1 C
 states that Chinese leaders an  their Soviet advisers reached the following
 decisions in late November regarding UN POW's:
 (1) to leave the POW problem (henceforth?) to the "Pyongyang War
 Prisoners Administration" for solution; but
 25X1A
 (2) to give "thought training" to POW's already sent outside the
 jurisdiction of the above agency;
 (3) to send all American POW's to a Manchurian center to be handled
 by a special agency;
 (4) to send some 500 UN POW's to the USSR after basic "short-term"
 training& and                                          -            -
 (5) to send)10O UN FOW's to Peiping to work in "cinema propaganda."
 Comments  Returned POW's have reported that all POW's as part of their
 daily routine are indoctrinated by Communist political officers.  It is pre-
 sumed on the=,basis of past Communist practice that some hundreds of POW's
 have been or will be sent to the USSR and China for long-term training.-

 order of their probability:
 (1) to mount the principal offensive on the central front, with
 Wonju as a primary objective, followed by an attack to the west
 to isolate the Seoul area.  T:North Korean Army would be

 artillery support and air cover" would be needed. -Chinese
 forces would be held in reserve.or would make diversionary
 attacks.

 (2) to mount the main effort in the western sector,-with an
 armored force of "300 tanks" spearheading a joint Chinese-
 North Korean infantry force.  A ten-division reserve in
 the forward area would be maintained, with an additional
 reserve force in the Anju-Wonsan area to guard against
 a UN amphibious operation.
 (3) to. conduct limited offensives all along the line, if
 intelligence indicates the probability of a UN-amphi-
 bious operation.  Chinese forces would remain in the
 combat zone, but North Korean forces would be with-
 drawn.  A UN landing on the North Korean west coast
 would be strongly opposed before it got ashore by enemy
 air operations, but a landing on the east coast would
 2 5X1A         be unopposed by enemy air in its initial phase.
 Comment:  While this report seems logical on the surface, it must be
 noted that at best these are gnly staff recoammendations.  These plans seem
 to center around a fear of another UN amphibious operation--a-fear which is
 generally confirmed by other sources.  It is, however, illogical.that a UN
 amphibious operation on the east coast would be unopposed by air during its
 most critical phase before a beach-head is secured.
 15.           Three. Chinese Communist antiaircraft units accepted in Korea:  The
 Far East Command, on the basis of intelligence reports, the increased volume
 of AAA fire received, and photo interpretation of AAA installations, has now
 accepted the 1st,, 2nd, and 3rd Chinese Communist Antiaircraft Artillery
 Regiments in Korea.  Each of these units is estimated to have a strength of
 3,375 and 64 guns (predominantly 37 mm) and to be truckdrawn.  Photo inter-
 pretation indicated the presence in early December of over 1800 antiaircraft
 weapons of all calibers in Korea.  (S FEAF Tokyo AX 8251, 30 Dec 51)
 Comment:  Enemy antiaircraft units identified in Korea now constitute
 three Nor i  orean regiments--the 19th, 20th, and 23rd--and these newly-
 accepted Chinese regiments.  Additionally, the presence of some Soviet
 personnel serving antiaircraft artillery has been accepted, and most enemy
 ground combat units possess organic antiaircraft units.
 16.           North Korean Premier's New Year's speech indicates no change in
 Korean pry a anda line:  North  Korean-Premier Kim I lsong in a 1 January

 the Korean war.  He noted that the aggressive "interventionist plans" had
 gone bankrupt, and that the UN faces an acute crisis in Korea in view of the
 "quarrels and splits within the aggressive camp" and the. lowered morale of

 ,the UN soldiers.  Chinese intervention was praised as a "just war" to fore-
 stall the invasion of China and a brotherly gesture to preserve the
 freedom of North Koreas  Kim concluded with the familiar threat that "if
 the enemy does not withdraw from Korea but continues the aggressive war,
 the destruction of American imperialism will surely be hastened." (R FBIS
 Ticker, Pyongyang, 1 Jan 52)
 17.           Various economic measures urged by Pyongyang:  In a lengthy year-
 end report, Pyongyang outlined various economic measures that must be
 initiated to ensure victory in the war.  Admitting "the unprecedentedly
 great economic loss" caused by UN bombing and the expansion and prolonga-
 tion of the war, the article listed six proposals to secure increased
 mobilization and utilization, of materials and resources:  maintenance of
 a monthly balance sheet registering "all valuables, such as raw materials,
 fixtures, and'all the monetary assets"; effective utilization of all scrap
 material; strict conservation of raw materials, merchandise, and foods;
 increased distribution of idle labor and "rational systemization of labor";
 a decrease in the state budget and individual financial organizationst
 expenditures; and stricter "economic calculation and accounting" by each
 financial and economic organization.  (U FBIS, 21 Dec 51)
 Comment:. This discourse points out the three major problems that
 beset North Korea's economic recovery: destruction of industrial facili-
 ties; extreme shortage of manpower; and fiscal dislocation.
 18.   JAPAN.  Japanese worried by large reserve of pounds sterling:  Japanese
 financial and trade circles are apprehensive over the problem of increasing
 sterling balances, according to the Pan Asia press service.  The present
 large sterling holdings are the result of two factors.  First, many
 Southeast Asian countries recently have begun to buy Japanese goods through
 Hong Kong with-cheap pounds, saving scarce American dollars.  Secondly,
 Japanese buying from sterling areas has dropped off because of a decrease
 in British export capacity as well as a deterioration in the quality of
 goods from sterling area countries.   (U FBIS Ticker, 31 Dec '51)
 Comment:  The Japanese Foreign Exchange Control Board recently
 announced a reduction of the buying quotation of the pound sterling while
 maintaining the present selling rate.  This action, it is expected, will
 to some extent  discourage Japanese exports to the sterling area, as the
 exporter will receive less yen from sterling sales to the Board.  In
 addition, maintenance of the selling rate may tend to encourage imports
 from the sterling areas.

 Former Home Ministry official appointed Osaka police chief:
 Naraichi
 Tanaka, a depurgee, has been appointed police chief
 of Osaka
 over
 the
 protests of both the Federation of Municipal Chiefs
 of Police
 and
 the
 National Rural Police Headquarters.  Tanaka was formerly attached to the
 police bureau of the Home Ministry, and CINCFE comments that his appoint-
 ment may presage the return to police power of depurged former Home
 Ministry officials.  (S Tokyo Weeka 52, 29 Dec 51)
 Comment:  Many Japanese bureaucrats look back nostalgically upon
 the relative efficiency of the centralized form of the Japanese Police
 under the Home Ministry prior to the Occupation's reform of the police
 system. `Many of the depurgees will no doubt find their way back into the
 police in a government effort to strengthen internal security and improve
 police efficiency.
 Yomiuri on 30 December reported a "movement in the air" aimed at
 reviving the defunct Home Ministry.

 SECTION 3  (WESTERN)
 1.  GERMANY.  Comunists exploit former German Chancellor in unity campaign:
 Certain West German political leaders are concerned over Soviet and
 German exploitation of Joseph Wirth, a former Centrist-Chancellor of the
 Weimar Republic, in the current unity campaign.  Wirth, now in the Soviet
 Sector of Berlin as a guest of the Communists, has reportedly already seen
 important Soviet and East German officials.
 The former Chancellor, who is embittered against the present West German
 Government for neglecting him politically, reportedly plans to send a letter
 to all members of the West German Parliament denouncing Adenauer as a
 separatist and traitor and attacking the Schuman Plan and the West German
 position on unification.  Official concern is felt over the possible effect
 of such a letter, since Wirth's name is thought still to carry weight among
 older. generation Germans, and-in neutralist circles.  (C Berlin 864,
 .29 Dec 51)
 Comment:  Wirth has not been politically influential in postwar Germany,
 and the efeffect of any letter he may send to parliamentary delegates may be
 undercut somewhat by recent press reports of his presence in Berlin as the
 guest of the Communists.  Nevertheless this, as well as Paster Niemoeller's
 present trip to Moscow, represepts increased Soviet East German pressure on
 vulnerable West German political elements.
 2.  EAST GERMANY.  Ulbricht alleged to be in Moscow's disfavor:  East German
 Foreign Minister Georg Dertinger was asked on 19 December whether there is
 any truth in a rumor that Walter Ulbricht is in disfavor with the Russians.
 Dertinger said that it was a fact; he added that Ulbricht's objections to
 the sending of an East German delegation to Paris had been overruled by
 4-)A 1A
 Ambassador Semenov.
 Comment:  A West German press source recently reported a "violent
 dispute" on 5 December between Otto Grotewohl, East German Premier, and
 Ulbricht, Deputy Premier and Secretary-General of the East German Socialist
 Unity (Communist) Party.  Ulbricht, reputed to be the number one Communist
 in the East German Government, allegedly opposed the sending of a delegation
 to the UN.  Ulbricht's recent visit to Moscow, reportedly for policy
 consultations, suggests that he is still high in Moscow's favor; moreover,
 the credibility of Dertinger's statement is reduced by his reputation for
 making contradictory and unreliable declarations.

 since the elections, is "actively casting about" for a compromise formula
 in the current budget discussions.  Although the Assembly has succeeded in
 passing a provisional military expenditures bill, the tug of war over revenues,
 on which the government is expected to put the confidence question, continues,
 The Radicals, who insist on reform of the railroad and social security systems
 as the condition for voting tax increases, and the Socialists, who reject all
 such legislation, are in a deadlock.  The Gaullists and the Communists oppose
 both the reforms and tax increases.   A compromise whici would allow Socialist
 abstention without-causing the government to collapse is being sought.  (C
 Paris 3849 and 3906, 28 and 31 Dec 51)
 Comment:  Despite the strong support given three weeks ago to the Pleven
 government in the Schuman Plan ratification, coalition strength is indicated
 not by agreement on foreign policy, but by the degree of cohesion on economic
 ,,and ideological issues, where the cleavages are most pronounced.
 4.      AUSTRIA.  Austro-Czech trade agreement depends on exports of alloy steels:'
 Following the breaking-off of negotiations in Prague, the chief Austrian
 trade delegate has returned to Vienna with the report that the Czechs remain
 adamant in their demands for 105 tons of high-speed 10 percent tungsten steel
 and chrome nickel anti-corrosion steel.  The draft agreement, involving the
 exchange of about 60 million dollars worth of goods, is otherwise completed
 with a Czech offer of 20 percent less coal than in the previous agreement
 and Austrian exports of less than half the previous quantities of steel.  In
 return for various types of coal and coke, sugar, and ceramic clays, the
 Austrians will export steel, pig iron, non-embargo-type ball bearings, cranes,
 electrical ovens, moulds, aluminum, and free dollars.  On the grounds that
 the problem of payment for alternative coal supplies and the need for an
 export market requires a conclusion of the agreement, the Austrian Foreign
 Office has requested the US Embassy'for an early decision permitting the
 shipment of special alloy steels demanded by the Czechs.  (S Vienna 2160,
 29 Dec 51)                                        -
 5.            West refuses-to amend air corridor route:  The Western elements
 of the Allied Council re use  to accept a Sav=e  proposal to change the
 long-established air corridor connecting Graz, in the British Zone, with
 Vienna,  Despite Soviet allegations to the contrary, the Western elements
 contended that the new corridor would be more dangerous than the old one.
 US and British representatives replied to Soviet protests that the West
 would have to accept responsibility for the consequences of failure to
 change the route by reminding the Soviet representative that air safety
 was the responsibility of all four occupying powers.  (R Vienna 2158,
 29 Dec 51)
 Comment:  US officials in Vienna have believed that Soviet motives in
 pressing for a change in the corridor reflected a concern for protecting

 Western unanimity in rejecting the Soviet proposal appears to have disposed
 of US anxiety that bilateral Anglo-Soviet negotiations on this issue would
 compromise the principle of quadripartite authority in this field.
 6.   NETHL LANDS.  Dutch-Indonesian talks at a standstill:  A Dutch Foreign
 Office official has stated that t He Dutch-Indonesian talks are at a stand-
 still because of failure to settle incidents involving Indonesian seizure
 of arms from two Dutch vessels.  The Dutch are also irritated at the
 Indonesian refusal to grant exit permits to Dutch nationals working in
 Netherlands New Guinea to return there after spending leave in Indonesia.
 The official concludes that the "only bright spot" is that Indonesia has
 not sought to-justify its actions.on the basis of its claim to New Guinea.
 (S The Hague 640, 28 Dec 51)
 Comment:  Despite the Dutch official's statement, Indonesia's actions
 in these instances were uryloubtedly prompted by the New Guinea dispute.

 8.      SWITZERLAND.  Dissension in Swiss Communist Party is at all-time high:
 Dissension within the Swiss Communist Party has developed to such an extent
 as to.cause the party's central committee to circulate publicly a directive
 calling attention to the discord.  The directive charges former Communist
 Buenzod and others with fomenting discord in the party and warns that contact
 with expelled party members would be considered a gross breach of party
 discipline,  (R, Bern Joint Weeka 52, 28 Dec 51)
 Comment:  This is a further indication that the Swiss Communist Party
 will continue to diminish in popularity, suffer further electoral losses,
 and undergo additional intraparty strife.
 UNITED KINGDOM-SWEDEN.  New trade agreement increases Swedish imports of
 coal from Britain:  Anew   ade agreement between Sweden and the United
 Kingdom provides that the UK will deliver 1.2 million tons of coal and
 200,000 tons of coke to Sweden during 1952.  The 1951 agreement called for
 no coke and only 500,000 tons of coal.  Sweden will export 3.6 million tons
 of iron ore to Britain, the same amount as in 1951.  (R Stockholm Joint Weeka
 52, 28 Dec 51)
 Comment:  Britain's pressing need for iron ore enabled the Sweden to
 obtain promises for increased quantities of coal and coke, despite the fact
 that the UK is itself importing 750,000 tons of American coal in the first
 three months of this year.  Sweden's solid fuel supply for 1952 is now
 assured.

 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 1.   YUGOSLAVIA.  Tito considers danger of Soviet aggression lessening:  In a
 recent conversation with an American UN delegate, Tito stated that'he
 thought the danger of outright Soviet aggression was lessening in propor-
 tion to the rearmament and strengthening of the non-Cominform world.  He
 believes that Stalin and other high Soviet authorities remain prisoners of
 their preconceived notions concerning capitalism and still expect to bring
 about the defeat of the West through the latter's economic collapse;
 Tito declared categorically that armies and peoples fought best to pre-
 vent their country from being overrun by an aggression and that all other
 considerations were secondary.  (S, S/S Belgrade 834, 28 Dec 51).
 Comment:  Yugoslav leaders had previously indicated that they considered
 the danger of Soviet attack greatest in the year 1952 since the USSR might
 decide to strike before the West reached its peak of preparedness in 1954.
 Tito's statement is consistent, however, with his previous assertions that
 Western strength is a primary deterrent to Soviet aggression.
 Further evidence that the regime is well aware that its people will
 fight best for nationalistic reasons is the increasing stress that has been
 placed on nationalism in Yugoslav holiday celebrations and the relegation of
 Communist ideology to a secondary role.
 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 2.    EGYPT.      ptian King awaiting opportunity to appoint new government:  Accord-
 ing to the new Chief of the Royal Cabinet, King Farouk is taking precautions
 to avoid the-appearance that any action he might take in causing a change of
 government in Egypt would be British-inspired.
 The British Ambassador has warned his Foreign Office that a solution of
 the present problem is impossible without a minimum concession on the Sudan.
 He believes that this concession might be British recognition of King Farouk's
 new title within a framework providing for Sudanese self-determination.
 (S, S/S Cairo 967, 29 Dec 51).
 Comment:  king.Farouk has shown increasing eagerness to bring about the
 fall of the present Wafd government.  There is considerable doubt, however9
 whether even Western acceptance of Farouk's title of "King of Egypt and the
 Sudan" would sufficiently pacify aroused Egyptian public opinion to enable
 the dismissal of the majority party government without serious internal dis-
 turbances.

 SECTION 3 (WESTERN)
 3.      SWITZERLAND.  Swiss and Germans negotiate on World War II German assets
 liquidation:  The Swiss and Germans have made progress in reaching agreement
 on the liquidation of German assets in Switzerland, required by a postwar
 agreement among Switzerland, France, Britain, and the United States.  Accord-
 ing to the new proposals the Swiss will receive between 100 and 135 million
 Swiss francs, from which they will pay Swiss war victims.  The same amount
 will be divided among the Allies.  Individual German holdings under 10,000
 francs will be exempted.  Because the liquidation of German assets will
 yield about 400 million francs, or roughly 100 million francs more than
 necessary to reimburse all the parties concerned, approximately twenty-five
 percent of the assets will not be liquidated.
 The Germans would like to have the sums which they pay the Swiss under
 this agreement apply against the over-all German-Swiss debt settlement
 picture. The Swiss are resisting this on the grounds that under the previous
 Swiss Allied agreement, they would receive 250 million Swiss francs, which is
 more than\is allotted to them under the new proposals.  (C, S/S London SIGTO.
 895, 12 Dec 51).
 Comment:  This report indicates that the problem of the liquidation of
 German assets in Switzerland is as yet not ready for solution.  Any Swiss-
 German agreement must be acceptable to the Western Allies.  France and the
 UK appear, however, ready to accept any plan agreeable to the Swiss and
 Germans,
