1, The Preparatory Session of the Sixth All-China Labor Congress was opened in 
Harbin on 31 July 1948 with LIU Nine-4, Chairman of the Congress Preparatory 
eaunittee, presiding. LI Hsieh-pol Secretary-General of the Congress 
Preparatory Committee, first made a report on the past functions of the 
Preparatory Committee? The following is a summary of the major points of 
eI's report: 
Originally it was plalned to call the Liberated Area Congress of 
employee& and laborers e1egates (IACELD)(Chieh Fang Chu Chin 
Kung Tai Piao Ta Hui Ply -4N, ip 4k_ 
- 
in Yenan in September 1945; the Preparatory Committee for this congress 
had been formed by the delegates of the various general labor unions of 
the Liberated Areas and was organized in Yenan in April 1945. THUG Fa 
(la 4H was chairman of this committee; since ThNGgs death in April 
19469 LIUNing-i has been Chairman of the committee. Because of the 
Japanese surrender which forced the cemmittee to be active in various 
new areas which the Chinese Communists occupied ahead of the Kuomintang 
forces, the convocation of the LACeLD was postponed. Finally, in March 
1948 the Preparatory Committee notified the various labor unione of the 
Liberated Areas to prepare for the All-Liberated Areas Congress of 
asployeee' and Laborers Delegates.2 
According to the committees announcement, this conaress was to be held 
:n Harbin an 10 June 1948. Because of requests from CHU Hsueh-fan and the 
Shanghais, Tientsin and other underground "demcratic labor unions" in tee 
then Kuomintang-controlled areas to send delegates of their unions to 
attend the congress, the date for the congress was again postponed to 
1 August 1948 in order to allow sufficient time for the underground 
delegates of the various unions to arrive in Harbin. As the congress 
then vete not limited only to delegates of the Liberated Areas, LIU Ning-i0 
CHU Hauch-fan and various other leaders of the "democratic labor unions" 
suggested that the title for the congress be changed to the Sixth All-
China Labor Congress; this su2gestion was approved by the Preparatory 
Committee on 30 July /948.

-eacticeary groups and establishing an independent, liberal, democratic and 
erCified new China as pointed out by Chairman LAO Tse-tung.

was a 3ergthy political report by K10 Kang (111) 4 ). representative of the 
Chinese Communist Party's Northeast central Bureau (Chung Kung Tung Pei 
Chung Yang Chuir dieJj ). KAO presented the "historical facts" 
eleeroina ?low the Chinese labor cla:is had struggled under different political 
caaracteristies of the present natimal and international situation into 
"democratic" and nreactiona-y" and noncluded that it is "the duty of the label.' 
elaes to Iloilo with all demecratie elesses of the world for the overthrowing of 
American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary regime."

third session 3 August 1948 when CH EN Yun utilized the time of the entire day's 
eeecion to deliver a lengthy speech on the "Present Aims of the Chinese smployee-
Jeoorer (lrade Union) Movemelt." Tie content of CH' EE's speech was actually the 
eate- ae that of the "Resolutions" peesented by LI Li-ean on 17 August (see psra-
eraphs I" and 19). Like the Resolutions themselves as well as LI Li-san's pre-
senteeion speech, the tone of CHIN's address was violently anti-Kuomintang and 
neti-Ameriear and the points of his entire speech followed the oscow party line. 
It is significant that this speech aas delivered by CII ?EN Yun, who is a member 
cr the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee and Central Politburo and 
that the Lesolutions as such were presented by another ardent international 
Communise, LI Li-san. In conclusion, CH'EN stated that in order to realize 
these aims there must be established the China National Union of Trade Unions 
TUTU),

ogainst Anerican imperialism and aeainst the reactionary Kuomintang regime 
)o the Ain of the fight of the emp:'oyees and laborers in the Kuomintann-con-
erelled areas. Then CHU related how the "Kuomintang reactionary groups con-
trolled and slaughtered the laborers, how the laborers suffered under the 
Kuomintang economic collapse, and how they carried out their heroic anti-CH1ANG 
and anti-emerican struggle." Fina:,ly he mentioned the "historical facts" 
regarding ham the Chinese Labor Association (Chung Kuo Lao Tung Hsieh Hui 
lp ih ir ) was established and haw it joined the Chinese Communists 
in January 1946 to realize its sirelar aims. In the 11 August session, OU-YANG 
Thu-junia Al )0 Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Establish-
eeet of the Shanghai (Communist) Labor Union, gave his own report and supported 
t41:: stateeents of CHU Hsueh-fan. CU-YANG listed all the labor strikes and labor 
etreTles,since the Japanese surrender in 1945 and concluded that these were led 
by the "dmoeratic labor unions" (underground) for the purpose of carrying out 
the anti-CHIANG and anti-American movements. 
11!. In the 12 August session lau fling-i reported on the international trade union 
movement. He first discussed the eorld Federation of Trade Unions (FTU); then 
he mentioned how MEG Fa had represented the Liberated Area Labor Union and 
CHU Hsueh-fan had represented the Chinese Labor Association in joining the 
September 1945 Conference of the WilU in Paris, thus establishing the link 
with international labor leaders anti international trade unions. LIU stressed 
the folleerine: 
"The eorld democratic strength has been united under the leadership of 
Stalin and other Communist leaders of the world. To be faithful to the 
international proletariat means to be faithful to one's own race! The 
expansion of the international trade union strength will never cease if we 
depend on the assistance of the democratic trade unions of the USSR and 
other democratic nations of the world, upon the national people's strength 
and the overseas Chinese labor strength, and upon the victory of inter-
nationalism. The way to peace and democracy is to support the eFTU? to 
strengthen the CNUTU and to cooperate closely with the labor class of all 
nations for the formation of a united anti-American front." 
15. In the 13 August 1948 session LI U-san announced the Regulations eoverning 
the CHUTU II explained that because of the latest changes in the situation 
in China, new missions were new put before the labor movement. In order to 
fulfill these now missions: a change in the form of the organization of the 
labor unions was needed. Strictly speaking, different productive enterprise 
trade unions should be the units or members of the CNUTU. All productive 
enterprise trade unions existing ee present, all vocational unions and all 
local labor unions should be members of the CNUTU. Anyone who works in any 
enterprise, school or organ and who depends on the salary or rages from his 
nenual or mental labor as the major source of his income should join as a 
member of the respective trade union which union is in turn a member of the CBU13.4 
There were no meetings on 14 and 1) August. In the 16 Aueuat session, the 
iresidium's proposal was "passed" to send a telegram to the overseas Chinese 
in the name of the Sixth All-China Labor Congress. This cable expressed 
qempathy :or the overseas Chinese :ho "are oppressed overseas by the reactionary 
Kuomintang" and heartily welcomed the overseas laborers and personnel of the 
industrial and commereial circles emong the overseas Chinese to come to the 
"liberate areas and participate in the Communist industrial reconstruction." 
17. In the seesion of 17 August 1948 La Li-Ban represented the Presidium of the 
Congress in announcing the "Draft esolutions Concerning the Employee-Laborer 
(Trade Union) Movement." These were passed with applause. These resolutions 
were actually the saw in content as CH 'EN Yun's report on the "Present Aims 
of the Chinese Employee-Laborer (Trade Union) Movement." (See paragraph 10.)

and of those made by KAO Kang and CHIEN Yun on the present aims of the Chinese 
,iiployee-Laborer (Trade Union) Loeement and made these into final resolutions 
of the Congress; these of course were "passed" unaltered. These "resolutions" 
were not the result of discussions of the proposals made by the delegates to 
the cong7ess but rather were the unification of the ideas and principles 
?eeviously set up by a few key members of the Presidium, CCP members who are 
ardent leaders and advocates of the international labor movement.6 
vO. The closing ceremony for the Congeess took place on 22 August 1948. Chairman

26. Several aspects of the CNUTU definitely reflect Seviet influence and are 
poeeible evidence of Moscow connections and USSR clrection: 
o. The wmilarity in organization and structure of the CNUTU with that of the 
Soviet Trade Union organizatior and structure le apparent from wch things, 
mono otherss as the pyramidal etruoture and the "Democratic Centralized 
nysteres" the authority and functions of the hxecu.tve Committee and Standing 
Committee, the use of vinstructors" (trade union ctoanizers and inseectors)? etc. 
b, The CCP has adopted the Soviet Idea of "labor heroes" and "awards of merit." 
c. As in the Soviet systems the CCP now includes all emeloyees and laberers in 
its trade union set-up, that is, both manual and ment 1 laborers; formerly 
this vas not necessarily true ce the CCP labor or tracl) union organization. 
d. Like the Soviet coal, the aim ce' the Sixth All-China Lor Congress, the 
CNUTU and the CCP is to "combat American imperialiam;" %c: course, the 
Chinese Communists will add "and the imperialism of the ',lectionary Kuomintang." 
The powerful and influential CV officials of the CNUTU e.e Party members, are 
Moscow trained and are former Comintern members; hence tie CNUTU is not an 
organization dominated or controlled by "nationalist" Chi.eee Communists. 
2? Liaison with Moscow and Soviet officials can be carried on b. those CCP 
leaders going to the USSR or passing through MOSCOW to attend \trious inter-
actional labor or trade union c Inferences such as those of the'.1elet-dominated 
orld 2ederation of Trade Unione (UTU). Several CCP officials u the CNUTU 
also hold positions in the WFTU, 
25X1X 
1111111v,.?,,t. The number of CNUTU officials who are listed in tis reiNkt 
and in CCP Chinese-language publications regarding the CNUTU as holding posit.eo,s 
i'or various labor organizations for Shanghai is perhaps indicative o.7 the prepea,, 
tion by the CCP for a take-over of Shanghai labor elements. Varioue'reports from 
sources other than those of this report and various Chinese-languag: press arti-
cles have already given some information on the liaison, contact an. "negotiations" 
going on between Shanghai labor leaders and trade union elements wiLh officials 
of the CNUTU such as CHU Hsueh-fan, former Shanghai labor leader aed Ch ling Pang 
eecret Society "fraternity brother" of Shanghai labor ozar TU Yuchesheng.

_ . 
-chinese Communist publications, including English-language Chinese Communist 
25X1X publications such as the Chi et in Hong Kong, plus Chinese Communist 
Chinese-language publications in Hone Kong and some CCP Chinese-language 
publications filtering into Hong Kong from CCP-controlled areas of North China 
and Manchuria; b) interrogation of travelers from CCP-controlled areas of North 
:Mina and Manchuria who come and co from Hong Kong as well as miscellaneous bits 
of information gathered from leftist and third party members in Hong Kong with 
good Communist contacts. Biographical information was supplied to a large degree

,..21,. 
m. The word "all" was added to the title because by March 1948 
there were more Liberated Areas than formerlor. 
_Comrent. CCP publications in Hong Kong are perhaps naively honest in 
25X1X their presentation of such incidence:, as the "passing" of motions or proposals 
at the Coneress; all CCP Chinese-lareuage publications which have discussed or 
reported or the ::ixth All-China Leber Congress simply state that such and such 
'as passee" (1.,Jia2 114 At) by the delegates attending." No mention is 
made of amendments, criticisms etc., by the minority.)
