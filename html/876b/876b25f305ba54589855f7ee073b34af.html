 HOW TO USE THE DRAWING APPARATUS:
 1.               all Average Test Specimen Cotton into
 Divide the Small
 four equal parts.
 Turn Screw           ~ 17  to adjust the distance or space between
 the two pairs of Rollers to obtain a space of about 3-5 m.m.
 in excess of the Length Standard under test.
 3. Set on Levers (7 to tighten the two pairs of Rollers.
 4. Feed the said four equal parts one after another separately
 into Cotton-feeding Rollers  1) (2 , ' turn Handle  8
 counter-clockwise.
 5. Take away the foreign matter and nePs from the Specimen
 Cotton on Velvet Roller (12).
 6. Take off Specimen from Velvet Roller (12) pass it through
 the Drawing Apparatus for three to five times not less than
 three times for cotton grade 3 and up-not less than five
 times for cotton  b vrade 4 and down) and make it into four
 Slivers.
 7. Part each of the four Slivers into two equal lengthe discard-
 U one half of each and keeping the other four halves.
 inb
 Combine            he remaining four halves into one
 each two of t
 and pass them again through the Drawing Apparatus for
 a same number of times as aforesaid to produce two Slivers.
 $. Cut each of the two Slivers into two equal halves, again
 ng one half of each and keeping the other two
 discards
 halves. Combine the remaining two halves into one and
 pass it again through the Drawing Apparatus for a same
 number of times as aforesaid thus producing the Test
 Specimen Sliver.
 9. Select out lengthwise 0.1 to 0.12 gram from the Test
 Sliver. Manipulate the fibres carefully by fingers
 Specimen
 and cast off the dust and other impurities. Again, pass it
 through the Drawing Apparatus to }produce the Ultimate
 Cotton Sliver.

 er may be elected, who shall have the same rights as a
 basic trade union committee.  The regulations govern-
 ing the organization of basic trade union committees shall
 be formulated by the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions or the national committees of the respective in-
 dustrial unions.
 ARTICLE 14
 Apart from the basic trade union committees formed
 in accordance with Articles 3 and 13 of this Law, and
 approved by the industrial unions or the local unions, no
 other organizations in factories, mines, business estab-
 lishments, farms, institutions, schools and other produc-
 tive or administrative units shall be entitled to the rights
 enjoyed by the basic trade union committees.
 ARTICLE 15
 The number of members of a basic trade union com-
 mittee who are full-time trade union functionaries and
 who are freed from production, shall be determined in
 accordance with the total number of workers and staff
 members employed in each factory, mine, business estab-
 lishment, farm, institution, school and other productive
 or administrative unit.  The ratio shall be as follows;
 Number of workers and                      Number of full-time trade
 staff members              union functionaries

 enterprise, must, in accordance with the decisions of the
 basic trade union committee, release from production
 those members who are required.
 ARTICLE 17
 Full-time trade union functionaries who are freed
 from production shall be paid by the trade unions and
 the amount should not be less than the rate of wages
 previously paid to them.  They shall continue to share
 in labour insurance and other welfare facilities paid for

 prise.  After completing their term of office, the manage-
 ment, or the owner of the private enterprise, shall en-

 CONSTITUTION OF THE TRADE UNIONS OF THE
 PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 PREAMBLE
 The Chinese working class, under the leadership of
 the Communist Party of China and its great leader Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung, has waged a protracted struggle in
 which it established the closest alliance with the peasants,
 formed a united front with all patriotic and democratic
 forces to fight against imperialism, feudalism and bureau-
 crat-capitalism, and consequently defeated the foreign
 imperialists  and the internal counter-revolutionaries,
 thereby achieving great victory in the people's democratic
 revolution.
 It was after the birth of the Chinese Communist
 Party-a party of the Chinese working class itself-and
 under its direct leadership that the working-class move-
 ment of present-day China progressed along the road to
 victory.
 The trade unions of China led by the Communist
 Party have rallied the workers around the Party and
 have thus become transmission belts between the Party
 and the masses.  After the establishment of the people's
 democratic dictatorship, the trade unions under the
 leadership of the Party have become a school of adminis-
 Adopted by the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions,
 May 10, 1953.

 tration, a school of management and a school of commu-
 nism for the workers.
 The trade unions of China are mass organizations of
 all manual and non-manual workers living entirely or
 mainly on their wages, formed on a voluntary basis with-
 out distinction of nationality, sex or religious beliefs.
 The People's Republic of China is a republic led by
 the working class.  Hence, the interests of the state and
 the common interests of the entire people constitute the
 fundamental interests of the working class.  The trade
 unions, on behalf of the workers, should therefore take
 an active part in the enactment of laws and decrees of
 the state concerning production and labour as well as
 the material and cultural life of the workers, firmly sup-
 port and carry out all the policies, laws and decrees of
 the People's Government, and serve as firm social pillars
 of the people's democratic dictatorship.
 The most important tasks of the trade unions of
 China during the period of national construction are to
 strengthen the unity of the working class, to consolidate
 the alliance of workers and peasants, to educate the work-
 ers to observe consciously the laws and decrees of the
 state and labour discipline, to strive for the development
 of production, for the constant increase of labour produc-
 tivity, for the fulfilment and over-fulfilment of the pro-
 duction plans of the state, for the speedy industrializa-
 tion of the country and for the steady advance towards
 socialism.  The trade unions should constantly show
 concern for the improvement of living and working con-
 ditions and, on the basis of developing production,
 16
 gradually but actively improve the material and cultural
 life of the workers.
 In state-owned enterprises, the workers are the mas-
 ters, and it should be the sacred duty of the trade unions
 to mobilize and organize the workers to ensure the fulfil-
 ment and over-fulfilment of state production plans.
 In enterprises jointly owned by state and private
 capital and in the enterprises which regularly do process-
 ing work for the state, it is the paramount duty of the
 trade unions to raise production and to supervise the
 implementation of contracts.
 In privately-owned enterprises, although the work-
 ers are still subjected to exploitation, their political rights
 and legitimate economic interests are afforded effective
 protection by the law of the state and by the trade union
 organizations.  Therefore it is also the duty of the trade
 unions in the privately-owned enterprises to organize and
 educate the workers to raise production and see to it
 that the capitalists are observing the government laws
 and decrees, thus enabling these enterprises to play an
 active part in the national welfare and people's livelihood
 under the leadership of the state-owned sector of the
 national economy.  This conforms with the fundamental
 interests of the working class.
 The trade unions of China are organized along in-
 dustrial lines, based on democratic centralism.  They
 must take collective leadership, persuasion and educa-
 tion as the main methods of their work.  They must
 show concern over the interests of the masses, gather
 their views and promote criticism and self-criticism.
 They must consistently pay attention to the fight against

 bureaucracy and commandism which separate them from
 the masses, and at the same time, constantly improve
 the organization and discipline of the workers.
 The trade unions of China must constantly educate
 the workers in internationalism and actively take part
 in the international working-class movement.  They
 must strive for the unity and solidarity of the movement
 and for the defence of lasting peace in the Far East and
 throughout the world.

 DECISIONS  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT
 ADMINISTRATION COUNCIL OF THE
 CENTRAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT
 CONCERNING CERTAIN AMEND-
 MENTS                                                                              TO THE  LABOUR
 INSURANCE  REGULA-
 TIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S
 REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 (Adopted at the 165th Administrative Session of the Government
 Administration Council on Ianuar!/ 2. 1953)
 Since the promulgation of the Labour Insurance
 Regulations of the People's Republic of China by the
 Government Administration Council in February, 1951,
 certain achievements and experiences have been gained
 in their practical application. These Regulations have
 won the support of the masses of workers and staff
 members and played an active part in improving their
 life and in stimulating their enthusiasm for work.  But
 since these Regulations were drawn up at a time when
 State finance and economy had not yet been completely
 restored, some of their benefits were comparatively
 small, and the scope of their application was limited by
 the need for experimentation in certain enterprises. At

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 present, our finance and economy are fundamentally
 improved; economic construction will soon commence on
 a large scale.  Accordingly, the Labour Insurance
 Regulations should be applied on a wider scale and the
 standard of benefits accruing therefrom appropriately
 raised. However, as the need to resist U.S. aggression
 and aid Korea still continues and vast sums of money
 are to be invested in economic construction, the State
 should first and foremost finance those major enterprises
 which serve the basic interests of the people of the whole
 country. Moreover, the welfare of the working class
 and the entire popular masses can only be gradually
 improved in proportion to the development of produce
 tion.  Therefore, the Labour Insurance Regulations can-
 not at present be applied on too wide a scope nor can
 the standard of benefits accruing therefrom be raised
 too high. In view of this situation, the Government
 Administration Council hereby decides as follows:
 1.  Regarding a widened scope of application:
 Apart from enterprises which have already carried
 out the labour Insurance Regulations, e.g. railways,
 post and tele-communications, water transport, factories,
 and mines each employing 100 or more workers, the
 scope of application is now extended to cover the fol-
 lowing enterprises:  (1) Capital construction units of
 factories, mines, and transportation enterprises;  (2)
 State-owned building companies.
 As of January 1, 1953, labour insurance funds shall
 be paid by the management of all enterprises to which
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104/08: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 the newly-extended Regulations now apply. From
 March 1, 1953, workers and staff members in these
 enterprises shall enjoy the various labour insurance
 benefits as stipulated by the Labour Insurance Regula-
 tions.
 The management of all enterprises now covered by
 the newly-extended Regulations shall, together with the
 primary trade union organisations, devise the methods
 of application, which shall be submitted to the local
 labour administration organs for examination before
 they are put into effect.  In case of particular difficulties
 in the carrying out of the present Regulations, approval
 for temporarily putting off such application must be
 sought from the local labour administration organs.
 2.  Regarding higher standard of labour insurance
 benefits:
 The stipulation that a worker or staff member can
 be absent from work in order to receive medical treat-
 ment for a period not more than 6 months is to be
 abolished.  The standard of benefits accruing to workers
 and staff members during the period of medical treat-
 ment is to be suitably improved.  Provisions are made
 to grant allowances for expensive medicines according
 to circumstance, to increase the rates of old-age pensions
 and to allow more liberal conditions for old-age pen-
 sions.  Other benefits such as maternity benefits,
 funeral benefits, allowances for funerals, and relief for
 family dependents in the case of death not incurred
 on the job, are also increased.  The standard of the

 various kinds of benefits is specifically defined i

 enterprises where the position of raw materials, marketing
 and technique permits.  State shops and co-operatives
 big and medium cities and in the factory and mining districts
 should, as far as possible, also operate on an eight hour w, work-
 ing day system.  In cases where work is detriment
 health, working hours should be less than eight hours per day.
 Overtime work in all state and private enterprises should be
 strictly restricted.
 All unemployed workers should be registered and placed
 individually or given training for re-employmet hen other
 d
 trades.  Those unemployed workers who cannot  placed
 or given training right away, but who have real diffiicnlti s
 in maintaining their living, should be helped in the
 providing relief work, organising migration to other areas
 for land reclamation, equipping them for self-employment or
 by giving temporary or long-term relief.
 Women who were workers before liberation and who
 want to resume work should be organised to do processing
 work for the factories or take part in handicraft production
 as the position of raw riiaterials and marketing permits, or
 be other work according to the needs and possibilities.
 II.  With regard to the problem of intellectuals, the basic
 situation is that there are too few intellectuals to meet the
 needs of large-scale national construction.  Ilowever,therde
 are at present a number of intellectuals who are unemployed,
 mostly because they lack special knowledge or skill, a result
 of the colonial economy and educational system of old China.
 They are rather slow at changing their outlook, while some
 are starting to make progress, others are sell falling behind;
 and some have a complex political background.  Most of
 them are middle-aged and have family burdens, and in gen-
 eral, they are unwilling to work in the countryside, and stile
 less in the more remote areas and border districts. But som

 of them would have real family difficulties if they were to go
 to work in other places.  All these constitute reasons why
 they have not yet obtained employment. Some of them, most-
 ly educated housewives, have never worked in the past due to
 various reasons.  On the other hand, certain enterprises and
 institutions have been only willing to accept young cadres of
 student origin and were reluctant to accept these unemploy-
 ed intellectuals.                  Such an attitude must now be done away
 with; consideration should be given to the actual circum
 stances and the over-all situation and the policy of recruiting,
 educating, reforming and employing intellectuals on a wide
 scale should be carried out, ;otherwise it will be impossible
 to cope with the pressing needs of the large-scale national
 construction which will soon commence.  In particular, the
 departments of education, health, trade and the co-operatives
 should pay attention to recruiting these unemployed intellec-
 tuals, to training, reforming and employing them, and to
 continue to reform them while they are working.  At the same
 time, the unemployed intellectuals should see their own ideo-
 logical shortcomings and make efforts to improve themselves.
 For those intellectuals who had, in the past, taken part, to
 a greater or lesser degree, in counter-revolutionary activities
 or organisations but have now sincerely, honestly and com-
 pletely told their stories, the policy of educating, reforming
 and employing them should he adopted.  The small number
 of unemployed intellectuals who can continue their studies in
 higher institutions or specialised intermediate schools should
 be given help to enable them to enrol, with a view to meeting
 the needs of the further development of national construction.
 With regard to a section of the unemployed intellectuals
 who are locally well-known and have a considerable educa-
 tional level but cannot undertake heavy work due to olcl age
 or had health, appropriate measures should he taken to give
 them suitable work and care.  Proper relief should also
 be given to those aged unemployed intellectuals who are com-
 pletely incapable of work and have genuine difficulties in
 maintaining themselves.
 With regard to housewives of intellectual origin who
 now want to work, special consideration should be given in
 view of the fact that most of them have household work. There-
 fore, appropriate measures should he adopted to draw them
 into worl; in a planned, organised and systematic way, as,
 for example, giving them part-time work with pay which is a
 means beneficial both to them and to the public.
 III.  The Kuomintang reactionary regime left behind a
 large number of ex-army officers and government officials
 who were generally supporters of the reactionary rule.  Al-
 though some of them still have hostile feelings towards the
 People's Government, nevertheless, because of the inspiration
 and influence of the great victory of the people achieved in the
 last three years, the majority of them have now shown that
 they are willing to come over to the side of the people and
 are prepared to make amends by good service.
 Most of the ex-Kuomintang army officers and govern-
 ment officials have gone back to their own villages, received
 their share of land during the land reform and have joined
 in agricultural production.  Some of tliem, after their return,
 have been put tinder the control and supervision of the pea-
 sants because of resentment toward their behaviour.  This
 is not only natural, but also correct and necessary. How-
 ever, if they work properly in agricultural production or other
 trades, observe the laws and decrees of the government, and do
 not engage in any reactionary activities, then, after the place
 where they live has been liberated for three `ears, their status
 as the ex-Ict.uomintang army officers or government officials
 may he changed on the recommendation of the Hsiang Peo-
 ple's Congress and the sanction of the County People's Gov-

 ernment; their new status shall be decided accorcing to the
 nature of their work or trade (those who are concurrently of
 landlord origin shall be treated according to the regulations
 in regard to changing the status of landlords) .  Among the
 ex-Kuomintang army officers and government officials scat-
 tered in the cities, there are some who have means to live on,
 some who have already found work, some who are engaging
 in dishonest business and some who have real difTicttllies in
 maintaining a living.  The two latter shall be required to
 register and the policy of educating, reforming and employing
 them should be adopted.  They should he provided seriatim
 with systematic training in groups, and be helped to transfer
 to other trades, being reformed through training and work.
 However, ex-Kuomintang army officers and government offi-
 cials should also endeavour to reform themselves and clarify
 their past position.  For those \vho have no serious questions
 in their past political background and have now honestly told
 their stories, the same policy of educating, reforming and em-
 ploying them should be adopted. Proper consideration should
 be given in dealing with the cases of those high-ranking ex-
 Kuomintang army officers and government o(Ticials who can-
 not be trained to do other work, but have real difficulties in
 maintaining a living, provided they have nu specially bad
 records and have not incurred the great hatred of the people.
 There are some ex-Kuomintang army officers and gov-
 ernment officials who took part in the 1911 Revolution, the
 Northern Expedition or the War of Resistance to Japanese
 Aggression, and who changed over to the side of the people
 during the War of Liberation and were given money and sent
 back to their native towns; if they have no particularly bad
 records, special consideration should be given in dealing with
 their cases.
 JV.  The problem of the large amount of suri)ltis labour
 in the country-side is different from that of the unemployed
 62
 and under-employed in the cities.  They have food to eat and
 land to work.  But the potentialities of their labour have not
 been brottglat into full play.  Posi live measures should be
 taken to find ways and means of utilising these potentials
 on production.  At the same time, even with the present
 farming techniques, there is not enough  cultivated land
 for the peasants to till, so that with the further develop-
 ment of technique more surplus manpower will be created.
 This is a basic problem. Consequently, a fundamental essential
 should be the carrying out in a Manned and systematic way
 of imigra[ion to the Northeast, Northwest and Southwest, so
 that the area of cultivated land can be expanded through land
 reclamation, on the condition that in so doing soil and water
 conservation shall not be disrupted nor the pasturage of
 hocks and herds interfered with.  Small water conservancy
 projects should be \videly developed and arid land turned
 into irrigated fields, seed selection and farming techniques
 should be improved and intensive cultivation advocated so
 that the output per unit area will be raised.  In densely popu-
 lated areas, there are still large quantities of waste land such
 as sandy, alkaline and laterite soil. Experiences have proved
 that all these lands can be utilized, and surplus manpower
 in the countrysiclc should be organized to reclaim them. The
 work of clearing land, improving soil, utilizing some existing
 lakes as detention basins and reclaiming others and of soil
 and water conservation in mountainous areas should also be
 carried out in a planned way.
 Furthermore, a lot of surplus manpower can be utilized
 through the planned development of subsidiary rural occupa-
 tions whose products have a good market, handicrafts, pro-
 cessing of agricultural and other subsidiary products, affores-
 tation, fishery, river dredging, road construction and the
 construction of large water conservancy projects.  The com-
 petent authorities should draw up plans for such develop-
 63

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 ment in accordance wish the actual circumstances, and see
 that they are implemented systematically.  In particular,
 the All-China Federation of Co-operatives should, as far as
 possible, organize handicraft producers' co-operatives to de-
 velop the production of handicraft products which have a
 good demand both in the domestic and foreign markets.
 The mutual-aid and cooperative rnoveniciit should be
 actively developed. And, upon the basis of such an organized
 movement, it will be easier to organise the work of the imig-
 rants on land reclamatiin, of clearing land and of small water
 cunservancv projects.
 While the growth of cities and industry and the develop-
 ment of national construction require a large number of
 labour force from the countryside, this must be organised in
 a planned and systematic way, and it is impossible to draw
 in a large amount of labour in a short space of time.  There-
 fore, the peasants must be persuaded not to mine into the
 cities blindly, without an' job to go to.
 V.  With regard to the problem of unemployment of na-
 tional minorities living in the cities, the main question is that
 of unemployment and under-employment of Moslems.          At-
 tention must be given to help them to solve this problem.
 Their scope of employment is limited because their customs
 and habits are different from those of the Han people.. Ef-
 forts must be made to give them wide opportunities of em-
 ployment and of transferring to other trades, and it is better
 to recruit them into factories and mines in a planned way on
 a group basis in addition to helping them by individual
 placing.  Care and attention should be given, in all cases,
 to respect their customs and habits.
 VI.    Proper arrangements must be provided fcr those
 refugee and povert}--striken Chinese nationals who have re-
 turned to the country from overseas.  keen attention should
 64
 he given to this by the administrations in charge of afair~
 concerning Chinese resident abroad and of civic affairs.
 [very opportunity should be fully explored to help them to find
 employment Or to settle down in production, and they must
 not be left in an unsettled state to face unemployment or lack
 of education facilities.  Substantial relief should be provided
 to those who are unable to work and cannot maintain a living.
 VII.  I-iomeless children and helpless, aged and dis-
 abled persons who are incapable of work, should be provided
 with homes and education or given individual relief.  Those
 who are able to engage in light work may be organized in
 production. Loafers and beggars who are capable of work
 should be compelled to work, and where feasible, it is prefer-
 able to reform there collectively through labour.
 VIII.  All the unemployed in the cities should be system-
 atically registered.  These should include unemployed per-
 sons wiio have no permanent job such as manual and non-
 manual workers formerly employed in state and private indus-
 trial and commercial enterprises, communication and trans-
 l)ort cstablislunents, handicraft workshops, government insti-
 tutions, public organizations and schools, as well as building
 and transport workers without definite employment; seasonal
 workers who cannot find work because of a decline in their
 trades; unemployed intellectuals of not less than junior mid-
 dle school education; such independent producers, itinerant
 traders, stallkeepers and pedlars, managing agents and own-
 ers of small enterprises whose businesses have closed down
 and who Iiave no other income, have dificiiIties in maintain-
 ing   living and want to work as ~vage-earners; as well as
 II employed ex-Kuomini~.ing army officers and government
 officials who want to find work because of hardship.
 After registration, all the cases shall be individually
 dealt with according to their circumstances.  As a general
 65

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 rule, they should be trained in groups seriatim in a planned
 way, and thereafter, the problem of their employment shall
 be solved gradually in accordance with the needs of the de-
 velopment of national construction and their own qualifica-
 tions.  To cope with practical needs, the departments which
 recruit them should be responsiblc for their l.)olitical and voca-
 tional training and training for re-employment in other trades.
 After registration, those unemployed who really have diffi-
 culties in maintaining a living should be provided with pro-
 per reliefs.
 In order to achieve labour employment in a co-ordinated
 way and to further realize the unified allocation of the labour
 force, labour employment committees with offices and their
 own full-time staff should be established by the central
 authority, the greater administrative areas, the provincial
 authorities and the large municipalities.  These committees
 shall direct the registration and placing of all unemployed
 persons handled by departments in charge of labour and by
 other departments concerned. In case of necessity, labour em-
 ployment committees may also be set up by municipalities
 under the provincial authorities, with the approval of the
 provincial people's government concerned.
 To sum up, in dealing with the problem of unemployment
 and under-employment in the cities, as well as the problem of
 the vast amount of surplus man-power in both urban and
 rural areas, consideration must be given to the needs of na-
 tional construction, to the over-all situation, to the actual
 circumstances and to long-term interests, and any work which
 is necessary and feasible at the present time should be started.
 Only in this way can unemployment be gradually eliminated
 and the potentialities of surplus urban and rural man-power
 be fully and systematically tapped, thus creating more wealth
 for the state and the society and promote the further develop-
 ment of the national economic and other construction.

 DIRECTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION
 COUNCIL ON DEVELOPING THE SPARE TIME EDUCA-
 TION OF WORKERS AND STAFF MEMBERS
 (June 1st, 1950)
 The development of spare time education is one of the
 most important means of raising the political, educational and
 technical levels of the broad masses of workers and staff
 members.  The  appropriate  government  departments  in
 various parts of the country, the bureaus administrating the
 enterprises and the trade union organisations shall under-
 take joint studies aimed at the implementation of this work
 in a planned, systematic and organised way. The following
 rules are to be followed in carrying out the work in the
 country.
 (1)  At present the students of spare time education
 shall be mainly workers and stall members in factories and
 enterprises, and literacy classes shall be the main content
 of spare time education.  Spare time education of workers
 and staff members may be carried out in diverse forms which
 can be maintained regularly.
 a. In all factories and enterprises where elementary
 political education has been carried out among the
 workers and stall members for a certain period, a
 planned literacy movement shall be now started to
 open primary spare time education classes and en-
 courage the illiterate workers and staff members to
 join the classes on a voluntary basis, in order that
 within three or five years all existing illiterate work-
 ers and 'staff members will be able to recognise
 about one thousand characters and to read simple
 publications.

 b.    Mobilise all literate staff members, workers and
 members of their families in factories and enterprises
 to become teachers of primary classes and all
 literate people shall be enabled to understand that
 teaching illiterates is their glorious task and a duty
 they are bound not to refuse. As a matter of prin-
 ciple, teaching primary classes shall be a non-
 . remunerative or quasi-remunerative work, while
 honours and material awards shall be given to dis-
 tinguished teachers who have done good work.
 C. The methods of teaching in primary classes should
 be flexible; in places where there are no classrooms,
 lessons may be given on the work site, in dining
 rooms and living quarters or at the pitheads. The
 number of students in each class may not be fixed,
 but there should be a study plan, organization and
 system and the students shall be graduated only
 after finishing certain textbooks.
 (1.  Schools near factories and enterprises shall give
 every assistance to the trade union organisations to
 develop the literacy movement by opening primary
 spare time education classes for workers and staff
 members.  Schools which have made an outstand-
 ing contribution in this work shall be awarded.
 (2) In order that workers and staff members who have
 a certain degree of education may have a chance to raise
 their educational level, all factories and enterprises should, in
 accordance with circumstances, provide higher Sl)are time
 education.  This shall be carried out generally in the follow-
 ing way:
 a.  Higher spare time education shall be of a more
 formal type such as: intermediate classes (the edu-
 cational level whereof shall be equal to that of [lie
 68
 fifth or sixth grade in primary schools, workers and
 staff members who graduate from the primary class
 or have a prin1i.~ry school educational standard are
 qualified to join these classes) ; higher classes (the
 educational level whereof shall be equal to that of
 middle schools, workers and stall members who
 graduate from the intermediate class or have an
 educational standard of a graduate from the primary
 school are qualified to join these classes) .  The cur-
 ricula shall be similar to the main courses in regular
 primary and middle schools.
 b.  The term of study is provisionally fixed as two years
 for the intermediate class and five years for the
 higher class, but it may be prolonged or shortened
 according to circumstances.  The students who
 have finished the major courses and passed the
 examination may receive certificates from the gov-
 ernment educational departments. These certificates
 arc equivalent to those issued by corresponding
 regular schools.
 c. The intermediate and higher classes of spare time
 education shall employ permanent teachers whose
 remuneration shall be correspondent to [hose obtain-
 ing in regular schools.
 olitical education of workers and staff mem-
 The
 p
 1)e1's may be carried out in such forms as reports on current
 affairs and lectures on special topics.  In large factories and
 enterprises there may be established spare time political edu-
 cation classes for those workers and staff members who have
 a certain e(lucahonal level, in order to give them a systematic
 education of political theory and to train them as functio~alries
 shall
 with a preliminary understanding of theory.  This

 from the educational departments of the provincial
 or municipal governments.  The students receiving
 good marks who wish to continue their studies may
 be recommended for entrance examinations of high-
 er political schools such as the People's University
 and College of Marxism-Leninism.
 (4) In order to further raise the technical level of work-
 ers and staff members to meet the demand for technical work-
 ers in the course of the industrial development, the factories
 and enterprises shall now carry out planned technical educa-
 tion according to their circumstances. In the implementation
 of this work, attention should be given to the following:
 a.  All technicians and skilled workers in the factories
 and enterprises shall be mobilized to help in the
 glorious task of training technical workers for the
 country by becoming voluntary technical teachers.

 prize or award (in the private enterprises, these may
 be laid down in the collective contract or decided in
 the labour-cal)ital consultative conference).
 (5)       As spare time education is so extensive, it should
 be carried out under the leadership of the government educa-
 tional departments, with the help of trade union organisations
 as well as others concerned.  Therefore, coordinated leading
 organisations shall be established, and it is hereby decided:
 a.        The Ministry of Education of the Central People's
 Government and the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions shall invite the Ministry of Labour and other
 bodies concerned to set ul~ a Committee on Spare

 terprises shall be responsible for the carrying out
 of spare time education for workers and staff rnem-
 bers there, under the direction of the local spare time
 education committees.  The management or owner
 of the factory or enterprise shall provide all neces-
 sary and available help.
 (6) Sixty per cent of the cultural and educational fund
 which the factory or enterprise contributes to the trade union
 organisation shall be appropriated as expenditure for the
 spare time education of workers and staff members.  Any
 deficit shall be made up by a subsidy from the educational
 fund of the local government.  The expenditure on spare
 time education is limited to the payment of teachers' wages,
 allowances, prizes, subsidy for the purchase of books and
 small sundry purchases and should not he wasted.
 (7)  All factories and 'enterprises should try to provide
 buildings and equipment necessary for the spare time educa-
 tion.
 (g)  Studies shall be held out of working time.  The
 primary and technical classes shall meet at least twice a
 week; the intermediate, higher, and political classes at least
 three times a week, each lasting at least ninety minutes. On
 study days the students may not have to work overtime or
 take part in meetings.
 (9)  Tl1e Ministry of Education of the Central People's
 Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 together with     NI iii istrv of Labour and the Ptthlicatinrts
 Administraliott shall jointly set up an editorial committee
 responsible for editing the teaching materials for the primary
 and political classes.  The intermediate and higher classes
 may use similar teaching materials as used in regular
 schools of the same level or in the short term middle schools
 for workers and peasants, but the content should he con-
 densed.  Technical and supplementary materials may be
 edited by the teachers and then sent to the local spare time
 education committee for approval.
 (10)  The present Directive may be applied to spare time
 education for workers and staff members with low educational
 level in various institutions.
 (11)  All local educational departments and local trade
 union organisations, upon receiving the present Directive,
 shall call on all bodies concerned to set up oil an early date
 a Committee on Spare Time Education of Workers and Staff
 Members to plan and expedite the implementation of this
 work.

 EDITOR'S NOTE
 Printed in the People's Republic of China
 On January 25, 1956 Mao Tse-tung, Chairman of
 the People's Republic of China, called a meeting of
 the Supreme State Conference to discuss the Draft
 National Programme for Agricultural Development
 (1956-1967) which had been submitted by the Polit-
 ical Bureau of the Central Committee of the Com-
 munist Party of China.
 In his address at the meeting Chairman Mao said
 that the country was at that moment witnessing the
 flood tide of the great socialist revolution.  With the
 founding of the People's Republic of China, the
 Chinese revolution had passed from the stage of
 bourgeois-democratic revolution to that of socialist
 revolution.  In other words, it had started the period
 of transition from capitalism to socialism.    The work
 of the first three of the past six years had been con-
 centrated mainly on restoring the national economy
 and carrying out various social reforms - first and
 foremost land reform - left incomplete in the first
 stage of the revolution.  Since last summer socialist
 transformation, that is, socialist revolution, had devel-
 oped on a vast scale with far-reaching results.  This
 socialist revolution, he said, could be completed in the
 main and on a national scale in about three more years.
 The object of socialist revolution, said Chairman
 Mao, was to set free the productive forces of society.
 It was quite certain that the change-over from indi-
 vidual to socialist, collective ownership in agriculture
 and handicrafts, and from capitalist to socialist owner-
 ship in private industry and commerce would lead to
 an ever greater release of productive forces; this laid

 the social basis for an enormous expansion of industrial
 and agricultural output.
 Our method of carrying out the socialist revolu-
 tion, continued Chairman Mao, was a peaceful one.
 In the past many people, both inside and outside the
 Communist Party, doubted if that was possible. But
 since the great upsurge of the co-operative movement
 in the countryside last summer, and the swelling tide
 of socialist transformation in the towns and cities in
 the past few months, there was no longer much room
 for doubt.
 Conditions in China were such that it was not
 only possible, by using peaceful methods, methods of
 persuasion and education, to turn individual into so-
 cialist, collective ownership, but also to change capi-
 talist into socialist ownership.  The speed of socialist
 transformation in the past few months had been far
 more rapid than anyone expected.  There were people
 who had worried that it would not be easy to get
 through the "difficult pass" to socialism.  It now
 lookc.l, said Chairman Mao, as if this "difficult pass"
 would not be so difficult to get through after all.
 A fundamental change had taken place in the
 political situation in China, he went on.  Up to last
 sumnier there had been many diflleulties in agricul-
 ture, but things were quite different now.  Many
 things that had seemed impracticable were now quite
 feasible.  It was possible to fulfil ahead of time and
 overf ulfil the country's First Five-Year Plan. Now
 this National Programme for Agricultural Develop-
 ment for 1.956-1967, based on the realities of the great
 upsurge in socialist transformation and socialist con-
 struction, was intended to outline the prospects for
 agricultural production and rural work and set a clear-
 cut goal before China's peasants and all who work in
 agriculture.  A spurt must be made in other kinds
 of work besides agriculture to keep in step with the
 situation arising from this upsurge of socialist rev-
 olution.
 In conclusion, Chairman Mao said that the nation
 must have a far-reaching, comprehensive plan of work
 for the next few decades to wipe out its economic,
 scientific and cultural backwardness anti get abreast
 of the most advanced nations in the world.  To reach
 this great goal the decisive thing was trained per-
 sonnel-to have plenty of capable scientists and tech-
 nicians.  At the same time they had to go on
 strengthening and extending the people's democratic
 united front, by uniting all forces that could be united.
 The Chinese people would ally themselves with people
 anywhere in the world to work for the preservation
 of world peace.
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung was followed by Liao
 Lu-yen, Deputy Head of the Department of Rural
 Work of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Com-
 mittee, who made a speech explaining the Draft Na-
 tional  Programme  for  Agricultural  Development
 (1956-1967).
 Then representatives of science, education, indus-
 try and commerce and of the various democratic parties
 made speeches, all expressing their warm support of
 the Draft National Programme for Agricultural Devel-
 opment.  Included in this pamphlet are the full text
 of the Draft National Programme for Agricultural
 Development (1956-1967) and the explanations on the
 programme given by Liao Lu-yen.

 THE DRAFT NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR
 AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
 1956-1967
 (Submitted by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
 of the Communist Party of China on January 23, 1956)
 The great tide of agricultural co-operation that
 has swept China is bringing forth an immense, nation-
 wide growth of agricultural production, and this in
 turn is stimulating the development of the whole
 national economy and all branches of science, culture,
 education and public health.
 To give the leading Party and government bodies
 at all levels and the people of China, particularly the
 peasants,  a  long-term  programme  of agricultural
 development, the Political Bureau of the Central
 Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after
 consulting comrades holding responsible positions on
 Party committees in the provinces, municipalities and
 autonomous regions, has drawn up a draft national
 programme outlining the scale of agricultural develop-
 ment during the period 1956-1967 (the last year of
 the third Five-Year Plan) ,  On a certain number of
 related questions this draft programme also touches
 upon work in the urban areas.  It sets a number of
 important targets for agricultural production. Others
 will be specified in each of the five-year plans and in
 the annual plans.
 This draft is now distributed so that it can be
 studied by the Party committees of all provinces
 (municipalities or autonomous regions), administra-
 tive regions (autonomous thou), counties (autonomous
 counties), districts and hsiang (nationality hsiang),

 as well as by all departments concerned, all of whom
 are asked to submit their views on it.  At the same
 time workers,. peasants, scientists and people from all
 walks of life who love their country should also be
 widely consulted.  These views should be collected
 before April 1, 1956, so that the programme can be
 submitted for discussion and adoption by the seventh
 plenary session (enlarged) of the seventh Central
 Committee of the Communist Party of China which
 will be held some time after that date. It will then be
 presented to the state bodies and the people of the
 whole country, first and foremost the peasants, as a
 recommendation.
 Except in some remote areas where democratic so-
 cial reforms have not yet been introduced, every lead-
 ing Party and government body of provinces (munici-
 palities, autonomous regions), administrative regions
 (autonomous chou), counties (autonomous counties),
 districts and hsiang (nationality hsiang) should draw
 up specific plans, based on the present draft national
 programme and taking into account conditions peculiar
 to each locality.  These plans should specify the suc-
 cessive stages of development of every aspect of their
 local work. At the same time all state departments
 concerned with economic affairs, with science, culture,
 education, public health, civic affairs or the judiciary
 should also review and revise their plans of work in
 accordance with the present national programme.
 (1)  Seeing that in 1955 more than 60 per cent
 of all peasant households were in agricultural pro-
 ducers' co-operatives, all provinces, municipalities and
 autonomous regions should, in the main, complete
 agricultural co-operation in its elementary form and
 set themselves the goal of getting about 85 per cent
 of all peasant households into agricultural producers'
 co-operatives in 1956.
 10
 (2)  Areas  where  co-operation is on better
 foundations and where a number of co-operatives of
 advanced form are already functioning should, in the
 main, complete the change-over to co-operation of
 advanced form by 1957. Each district of the remain-
 ing areas should, in 1956, set up and run one or more
 large co-operatives of advanced form (each with a
 hundred or more peasant households) to serve as ex-
 amples; and by 1958 they too should practically com-
 plete co-operation of advanced form.
 In going forward to the advanced form of co-
 operation certain conditions must be observed : the
 change must be of the free will and choice of the
 members; the co-operative must have people ca-
 pable of giving proper leadership; and it must be
 possible for over 90 per cent of the members to earn
 more after the change.  When all such conditions in
 the elementary form of co-operatives are ripe, they
 should at different times, group by group, go over to
 the advanced form of co-operation, otherwise the
 growth of their productive forces will be hampered.
 (3)  Every agricultural producers' co-operative
 must make suitable arrangements to see that those of
 its members who lack manpower, are widows or
 widowers, who have no close relations to depend on,
 or who are disabled ex-service men, are given pro-
 ductive work and a livelihood, so that they have
 enough food, clothing and fuel, can bring up their
 children properly, arid see that the dead are decently
 buried, so that they are assured of help during their
 lifetime and decent burial thereafter.
 (4)  During 1956 attempts should be made to
 settle the question of admitting to the co-operatives
 former landlords and rich peasants who have given
 up exploitation and who have asked to join.  This can
 be done on the following lines:  (a)  Those who have
 11

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 behaved well and worked well may be allowed to join
 co-operatives as members and change their sta u
 that of peasants.  (b) Those who have conducted
 themselves neither well nor badly, but have behave
 fairly well, may be allowed to join as candidate mem-
 bers, with their status for the time being unchanged.
 (c)  Those who have behaved badly the Hsiang the Peo-
 ple's Council should allow them to work
 operatives under supervision; those who have commit-
 ted sabotage should be brought to trial as the law
 directs.  (d) . Whether they acquire the status of co-
 operative member or not, former landlords or rich
 peasants shall not, for a specified time after joining
 a co-operative, be allowed to hold any important post
 in it.  (e)  Co-operatives must work on the principle
 of equal pay for equal work, and pay former land-
 lords or rich peasants in the co-operative the proper
 rate for the work they put in.  (f)  Sons and daugh-
 ters of landlords or rich peasants who were under
 eighteen at the time of the land reform, or who were
 still at school, or who had taken part in work before
 the land reform and had been under the thumb of
 other members of the family, should not be treated
 as landlords or rich peasants, but should be allowed
 to join the co-operatives as members, be reckoned as
 of peasant status, and given work suited to their
 abilities.
 (5)  Counter-revolutionaries in the rural areas
 should be dealt with as follows:  (a) Those who have
 committed sabotage or had committed other serious
 crimes in the past, and against whom there is great
 public feeling, should be put under arrest and dealt
 with in accordance with law.  (b)  Those who com-
 mitted crimes which were commonplace in the past,
 but have not committed sabotage since liberation, and
 against whom public feeling is not great, should be
 12
 13
 allowed by the Hsiang People's Council to work in the
 co-operative under supervision, to be reformed by
 work.  (c) Those who have committed minor crimes
 and since made amends, those who have served their
 sentence, been released and behaved well, and those
 who committed crimes but did deserving work in the
 campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, may be
 allowed to join the co-operative-some as members, no
 longer regarded as counter-revolutionaries but as
 peasants, and others for the time being as candidate
 members, not classified as peasants-depending on
 what they have done to make amends and what merit
 they have earned.  In no case, however, whether they
 are admitted as members or not, must they be allow-
 ed to take on important posts in the co-operative for
 a specified time after joining. (d) Such counter-
 revolutionaries as have been allowed to work in the
 co-operatives under supervision should be paid for their
 work by the co-operative on the principle of equal pay
 for equal work.  (e)  Other members of the families
 of counter-revolutionaries should be allowed to join
 co-operatives, and enjoy the same treatment as any-
 one else without being discriminated against, provided
 they took no part in crimes committed by the counter-
 revolutionaries.
 (6)  In the twelve years starting with 1956, in
 areas north of the Yellow River, the Tsinling Moun-
 tains, the River Pailung, and the Yellow River in
 Chinghai Province, the average annual yield of grain
 should be raised from the 1955 figure of over 150
 catties to the mou to 400 catties.' South of the Yel-
 low River and north of the Huai the yield should be
 raised from the 1955 figure of 208 catties to 500 cat-
 ties.  South of the Huai, the Tsinling Mountains and
 'One catty-1.1023 lb.  One mou=0.1647 acre.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 the River Pailung it should rise from the 1955 figure
 of 400 catties to 800 catties per mou.
 In the same twelve years the average annual
 yield of ginned cotton should be raised from the 1955
 figure of 35 catties to the mou (the average for the
 whole of China) to 60, 80 or 100 catties depending on
 local conditions.
 Everywhere vigorous steps should be taken to see
 that output targets set in state plans for grain, cot-
 ton, soya, peanuts, rape, sesame, hemp, cured tobacco,
 silk, tea, sugar-cane, sugar-beet, fruit, tea-oil and
 Lung-oil trees, are reached.  Besides this, all areas
 must take more energetic measures to develop all other
 marketable industrial crops.  In large mountainous
 areas vigorous efforts should be made to grow all pos-
 sible marketable industrial crops, provided that they
 not only produce enough food to make themselves self-
 sufficient, but also to build up a surplus against times
 of natural calamities.  In those parts of South China
 where conditions permit, vigorous efforts should be
 made to develop tropical crops.
 Agricultural producers' co-operatives should en-
 courage their members to 'grow vegetables on their
 own private plots by way of improving their standard
 of living.  Peasants who live on the outskirts of cities
 or near industrial or mining districts should go in for
 market gardening in a planned way so that the supply
 of vegetables to these places can be ensured.
 More medicinal herbs should be grown.  Those
 which grow wild should be protected and, wherever
 possible, gradually brought under cultivation.
 (7)  All agricultural producers' co-operatives, be-
 sides producing enough food for their own consump-
 tion and to meet the requirements of the state, should,
 within 12 years starting from 1956, store enough
 14
 grain for emergency use for a year, a year and a half
 or two years, according to local conditions. All prov-
 inces (municipalities or autonomous regions), adminis-
 trative regions (autonomous thou), counties (autono-
 mous counties), districts, hsiang (nationality hsiang)
 and all agricultural producers' co-operatives, should
 draw up detailed plans to meet this requirement.
 During the same period, the state too should store
 sufficient reserve grain for one to two years for use in
 any emergency.
 (8)  Live-stock breeding should be encouraged.
 Cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, camels, pigs, sheep and
 all kinds of poultry should be protected and bred. Spe-
 cial care should be taken to protect the females and
 young and improve breeds.  State live-stock farms
 should be extended.
 The prevention and cure of. animal diseases is an
 important part of live-stock breeding.  As far as pos-
 sible, all areas should, within a period varying from
 7 to 12 years, practically eliminate the most serious
 animal diseases such as rinderpest, hog cholera, New-
 castle disease, pork measles (cysticercosis), contagious
 pleuro-pneumonia of cattle, foot and mouth disease,
 lamb dysentery, sheep mange, and glanders.  For this
 purpose, within seven years  starting from 1956,
 veterinary stations should be set up in all counties in
 agricultural areas and all districts in pasture areas.
 Veterinary work should be improved and extended.
 The co-operatives should have personnel with basic
 training in the prevention and cure of animal diseases.
 Care should be taken to protect pastures, improve
 and grow grass for cattle fodder and encourage silage.
 Agricultural producers' co-operatives and live-stock
 breeding co-operatives should see that they have their
 own supplies of fodder and grass.
 (9)  There are two main ways of increasing the

 yield of crops : taking steps to increase production, and
 imparting better techniques.
 (A)  The chief steps to increase production are:
 (a) water conservancy projects and water and soil
 conservation; (b) use of improved farm tools, and
 gradual introduction of mechanized farming;  (c)
 efforts to discover every possible source of manure and
 improve methods of fertilizing ; (d) extension of the
 use of the best and most suitable strains; (e) soil
 improvement; (f) extension of multiple cropping areas;
 (g) planting more high-yielding crops; (h) improv-
 ing farming methods; (i) wiping out insect pests
 and plant diseases; and (j) opening up virgin and
 idle land and extending cultivated areas.
 (B)  The chief steps to impart better techniques
 include the following : (a) provinces, municipalities
 and autonomous regions should collect data on the
 experience of the best co-operatives in their own areas
 in increasing yields, compile and publish at least one
 book a year, so as to spread this knowledge as widely
 and rapidly as possible; (b) agricultural exhibitions;
 (c) conferences of model peasants called at regular
 intervals by provinces (municipalities or autonomous
 regions), administrative regions (autonomous thou),
 counties  (autonomous  counties),  districts,  hstiang
 (nationality hsiang), with awards and citations to
 peasants who distinguish themselves in increasing
 production; (d) visits and emulation campaigns, the
 exchange of experience; and (e) imparting technical
 knowledge and encouraging peasants and cadres to
 take an active part in learning better techniques.
 (10)  Water conservancy projects and water
 and soil conservation.  All small-scale water conserv-
 ancy projects (for example, the digging of wells and
 ponds and the building of irrigation canals and dams),
 the harnessing of small rivers and water and soil
 16
 conservation work should be carried out by local
 governments and agricultural producers' co-operatives
 systematically and on a large scale.  This work and
 the large-scale water conservancy projects and the
 harnessing of the larger rivers undertaken by the
 state should virtually eliminate all ordinary floods and
 droughts in 7 to 12 years, starting from 1956. The
 engineering industry, commercial undertakings and
 supply and marketing co-operatives should see that
 pumps, water-wheels, steam engines and other de-
 vices for raising water are made available.
 Local governments and agricultural producers'
 co-operatives, basing their work on the unified plan
 for developing the economy of the mountainous areas,
 should wherever possible carry out the water and soil
 conservation work required by agricultural produc-
 tion, live-stock breeding and forestry, so that within
 12 years striking results are achieved and soil erosion
 is, in the main, stopped.
 Within twelve years starting from 1956 small
 hydro-electric power stations should be built where
 water power is available, each of them to serve one or
 several hsiang.  This, alongside the great water con-
 servancy and power projects undertaken by the state,
 will gradually bring electrification to the countryside.
 (11)  Promote new types of farm tools. Starting
 from 1956, within three to five years 6 million more
 ploughs with two wheels and two shares should be
 in use, together with a considerable number of sowers,
 cultivators, sprayers, dusters, harvesters, shellers and
 silage cutters.  Good repair services should be main-
 tained.                                                                                        Agriculture will be gradually mechanized as
 the industrial development of the country forges
 ahead.
 (12)  Within twelve years, starting from 1956,
 local governments and agricultural producers' co-
 17

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 operatives in most areas should have made them-
 selves responsible for providing more than 90 per cent
 of all manure and other fertilizers needed-and in
 some places the whole of it.  To work towards this
 position, peasants everywhere should be encouraged
 to do everything they possibly can to increase the
 amount of fertilizer, paying special attention to pig-
 breeding (and in some cases sheep-breeding), and
 providing adequate green manure crops. Local gov-
 ernments should take active steps to develop the
 manufacture of phosphate and potassium fertilizers,
 extend the use of bacterial fertilizer (including soya
 bean and peanut root nodule bacteria), and collect and
 utilize to the fullest extent urban waste and manure
 from other miscellaneous sources. At the same time '
 the state will vigorously promote the chemical fertilizer
 industry.
 (13)  Energetic steps must be taken to breed
 and extend the use of improved strains suitable to
 local conditions and encourage work to improve seed.
 Within two or three years starting from 1956 picked
 seed should be in pretty general use for cotton grow-
 ing, and within seven to twelve years the same should
 be true of such important crops as rice, wheat, maize,
 soya, millet, kaoliang, potatoes, rape, sesame, sugar-
 cane, tobacco and hemp.  All agricultural producers'
 co-operatives should set aside land specially for grow-
 ing seed as such.  State farms should make them-
 selves centres for increasing the amount of picked
 seed.
 (14)  Agricultural producers' co-operatives should
 take energetic steps to improve the soil and do every-
 thing they can to turn poor into fertile land.
 (15)  Extend the area of multiple crops.  In
 twelve years starting with 1956 the average multiple
 crop index set for various areas will be raised to the
 18
 19
 following levels : (a) areas south of Wuling Moun-
 tains, 230 per cent; (b) areas north of Wuling Moun-
 tains and south of the Yangtse River, .200 per cent;
 Paoi
 (c) areas north of the Yangtse River and south
 the Yellow River, Tsinling Mountains and River
 Yello
 lung, 160 per cent; (d) areas north of he     vi
 ooutt
 River, .Tsinling Mountains and River Pailung and south
 of the Great Wall, 120 per cent; and (e) in areas
 of the Great Wall, multiple crop areas should also be
 expanded as much as possible.
 (16)  More high-yield crops should be grown.
 First, the area under rice should be extended, and all
 available water resources used to grow more. In the
 twelve years starting 1956 the area under rice should
 be increased by 310 million mou, maize by 150 million
 mou and potatoes by 100 million mou.
 (17)  Methods of cultivation should be improved.
 Deep ploughing, careful cultivation, proper rotation
 of crops, intercropping and close planting, sowing in
 good time, thinning out and protecting young plants
 and improving field work-these things must be clone
 to bring about good yields and good harvests.
 (18)  In seven or twelve years starting 1956,
 wherever possible, virtually wipe out insect pests and
 plant diseases that do most harm to crops. These in-
 clude locusts, armyworms, rice borers,' maize borers,
 aphides, red spiders, pink boll-worms, wheat smut,
 wheat nematode and black rot on sweet potato. Local
 plans should include any other serious insect pests
 and plant diseases that can be wiped out.  Greater and
 attention should be paid to plant protection  a
 quarantine measures to achieve this end.
 (19)  The state should reclaim waste land in a
 planned way and extend the area under cultivation.
 Wherever conditions permit, agricultural producers
 co-operatives should be encouraged to organize branch
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104/08: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 co-operatives to carry out such reclamation. The work
 should be linked with the general plan of water and
 soil conservation so as to prevent any danger of water
 loss and soil erosion.
 (20)  Expansion of state farms.  The area culti-
 vated by state farms should be increased in the twelve
 years starting 1956 from the 1955 figure of 13,360,000
 mou to 140 million mou.  Vigorous work must b p
 in to improve the running of state farms, to raise
 acct
 their output, practise the strictest economy
 down cost of production, so that state farms are the
 which
 models of farming technique and management
 they are expected to be.
 (21)  In the twelve years starting 1956 we must
 clothe every possible bit of denuded waste land and
 mountains with greenery. Wherever possible trees
 should be planted in a systematic way near houses,
 villages, along roads and rivers, as well as on waste
 land and mountains.  To achieve that end, agricul-

 trees of economic value such as mulberry and oak (for
 feeding silkwo'rms), and tea-trees, trees for varnish
 and fruit, and oil-yielding groves.
 Afforestation plans should include the creation
 of wind-breaks, sand-breaks and shelter belts to pro-
 tect farmland, the head-waters of rivers, sea coasts
 and cities.
 Local agricultural producers' co-operatives should
 plant and look after trees along railways, roads and
 rivers, and the income derived from this source should
 accrue to the co-operatives. Afforestation work along
 railways and roads should tally with specifications
 made by the government departments concerned with
 railways and communications.        prevent insect

 do. Industry means giving full encouragement to mein
 bers to work conscientiously, to branch out into new
 fields of production, to develop a many-sided economy
 and to exercise minute care over everything.  Thrift
 means being strictly economical, lowering the cost
 of production and opposing extravagance and waste.
 In all capital construction plans co-operatives should
 make the fullest use of their own manpower and the
 material and capital at their disposal.
 (25)  Improve housing conditions.  As produc-
 tion by the co-operatives grows and the income of
 their members increases, agricultural producers' co-
 operatives should encourage and assist members to
 repair or build houses for their families and thus im-
 prove their housing conditions.  This should be done
 in a prepared, planned way, at different times and
 group by group, taking needs and possibilities into
 account, and on a voluntary and economical basis, for
 it will help them with their work, their political and
 cultural activity, and improve their health conditions.
 (26)  In seven or twelve years from 1956 deter-
 mined efforts should be made to virtually wipe out
 wherever possible all diseases from which the peo-
 ple suffer most seriously, such as schistosomiasis,
 filariasis, hookworm, kala-azar, encephalitis, bubonic
 plague,  malaria,  smallpox  and venereal  diseases.
 Energetic steps should be taken to prevent and cure
 other diseases such as measles, dysentery, typhoid
 fever, diphtheria, trachoma,. pulmonary tuberculosis,
 leprosy, goitre and Kaschin-Beck's disease.
 To this end every effort should be made to train
 medical workers and gradually set up. health and
 medical services in counties and districts, and clinics
 in villages.
 (27)  Wipe out the "four evils." In five, seven
 or twelve years beginning 1956 we should practically
 22
 wipe out the "four evils"-rats, sparrows, flies and
 mosquitoes--wherever possible.
 (28)  We should improve our research in agri-
 cultural science, provide better technical guidance for
 agriculture and train in a planned way large numbers
 of people to handle the technical side of agriculture.
 A systematic effort is needed to start, improve and
 extend bodies undertaking research in agricultural
 science and those providing technical guidance. These
 bodies include colleges of agricultural science, re-
 gional and other specialized institutes of agricultural
 science, provincial agricultural experimental stations,
 model county breeding farms, and district agricul-
 tural instruction centres.  In this way agricultural
 research and technical guidance will be of better ser-
 vice to developing agriculture.  In the twelve years
 from 1956 agricultural departments at all levels
 should, to meet the needs of co-operative economy,
 between them be responsible for training five to six
 million experts of primary and intermediate grades
 for technical work in agriculture, forestry, water con-
 servancy, live-stock breeding, veterinary work, farm
 management and accounting for agricultural pro-
 ducers' co-operatives.
 (29)  In five or seven years from 1956, depend-
 ent on the situation locally, we must virtually wipe
 out illiteracy.  The minimum standard of literacy
 must be 1,500 characters.  In every hsiang we should
 have spare-time schools to raise the educational
 standard of our cadres and the peasants.  In the
 next seven or twelve years, again depending on the
 local situation, we should extend to all rural areas
 compulsory elementary education.  Primary schools
 in the countryside should mostly be run by agricul-
 tural producers' co-operatives.  In seven or twelve
 years, too, we should establish in the rural areas a

 wide network of film projection teams, clubs,
 stitutes, libraries, amateur dramatic groups and other
 bodies for education and recreation.  In the next seven
 to twelve years, every hsiang should have a
 the
 field and sport should be a common sight sports
 countryside.
 (30)  Starting from 1956 we shall, in the next
 seven to twelve years, depending on local circumstances,
 extend the radio diffusion network to all rural areas.
 All hsiang and all large producers' co-operative in
 agriculture, forestry, fishery, live stock breeding, salt
 producing and handicrafts are called on to install ei-
 ther rediffusion loudspeakers or wireless sets proper.
 (31)  In seven to twelve years from 1956, vary-
 ing with local circumstances, all hsiang and large co-
 operatives should have a telephone service. Radio tele-
 phone-telegraph equipment should be installed wherever
 it is needed.  Inside seven years all villages are to be
 provided with a decent post and telegraphic service
 and a proper distribution of newspapers and periodicals.
 (32)  In a matter of five, seven or twelve years,
 starting from 1956, depending on differing local condi-
 tions, the whole countryside must be provided with
 networks of roads.  All roads between one province
 (municipality or autonomous region) and another, be-
 tween administrative regions (autonomous chow), coun-
 ties (autonomous counties), districts and hsiang (na-
 tionality hsiang), must be built to specifications laid
 down by government departments concerned with
 communications.  All roads must be constantly and
 carefully kept up.
 In places served by water-ways, navigable chan-
 nels should be dredged and kept in good order under
 whatever conditions are possible to improve com-
 munications.
 (33)  In seven to twelve years from 1956, de-
 24
 pending on local circumstances, a network of hydro-
 graphical and meteorological stations and posts should
 be in the main completed so as to improve the work
 of providing agriculture with reliable weather and
 meteorological forecasts.  All areas should pay atten-
 tion to such forecasts so that they can ward off such
 calamities as flood, drought, gale and frost.
 (34)  In the main, co-operation among handi-
 craftsmen and salt producers, the fishing and water-
 side population, should be complete in 1957.  Plans
 should be drawn up to extend co-operation in live-
 stock farming in the light of local conditions.
 (35)  Commercial bodies and supply and market-
 ing co-operatives in rural areas should complete the
 reorganization of their buying and selling machinery
 in 1957, improve planning for the circulation of goods
 and ensure that all rural areas are given good service
 in the supply of goods and the purchase of agricul-
 tural produce.
 (36)  In 1957 there must be a rural credit co-
 operative in practically every hsiang to provide credit
 and encourage saving.
 (37)  Protection of women and children.  The
 principle of equal pay for equal work must be rigidly
 adhered to wherever women do productive work. Dur-
 ing busy times of the year on the farms agricultural
 producers' co-operatives should run creches. When
 work is given out the health and physique of women
 members must be taken into consideration.
 Organizations concerned with health should train
 midwives for the rural areas, do all they can to see
 that modern methods of delivering babies are used,
 provide post-natal care and take steps to cut, down
 the incidence of maternal diseases and the infant
 mortality rate.
 As co-operation in agriculture goes from strength

 to strength and as production rises and the peasants
 begin to live better, suitable regulations and restric-
 tions should be made. in regard to the employment of
 children in auxiliary work, with consideration to their
 age and strength.
 (38)  Young people in the country should be
 given every encouragement to show initiative in their
 work, to study and acquire scientific knowledge and
 skill.  The young people in the rural areas should be-
 come the spearhead, the shock force in productive,
 scientific and cultural work in the countryside.
 (39)  Starting from 1956, in the next five to
 seven years steps should be taken in the light of local
 conditions to wipe out unemployment in the cities and
 provide work for all urban unemployed.  The un-
 employed can find work not only in the cities but also
 on the outskirts of towns and cities, in the country-
 side proper, in areas where land reclamation is going

 SOME EXPLANATIONS ON THE DRAFT
 NATIONAL  PROGRAMME  FOR AGRI-'
 CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT , (1956.1967)
 LIA0 LU-YEN
 Chairman, Comrades and Friends :
 The Draft National Programme for Agricultural
 Development in 1956-1967 put forward by the Polit-
 ical Bureau of the Central Committee of the Com-
 munist Party of China elaborates and carries forward
 the earlier "seventeen-point" programme. On various
 occasions in November 1955, Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 exchanged views on the development of our agricul-
 ture with the secretaries of 14 provincial Party com-
 mittees and the secretary of the Party Committee of
 the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. The "seven-
 teen points" were decided on as a result of these con-
 sultations.  In January 1956, after further consulta-
 tions with responsible comrades from various provinces,
 municipalities and autonomous regions, Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung expanded these 17 points into 40 to make the
 first draft of this programme. In the past few days,
 the Central Committee of the Party has invited 1,375
 people gathered in Peking, including scientists working
 in industry, agriculture, medicine, public health and
 the social sciences, leading members of the democratic
 parties and people's organizations; and workers in the
 fields of education and culture, to group discussions of
 this draft.  Some good points raised in these discus-
 sions were adopted and the necessary revisions made in
 the draft.   Other useful paints also emerged during the
 discussions. They will not be ignored; they will be
 taken up and dealt with later on in. our practical work,
 27

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 but they were not considered suitable for inclusion in
 the programme.
 The revised version of this draft programme,
 adopted by the Political Bureau of the Central Com-
 mittee of the Communist Party of China on January
 23, is now being submitted to the Supreme State
 Conference for discussion.  As I am working in the
 Ministry of Agriculture and am also in the Depart-
 ment of Rural Work of the Central Committee of the
 Party, the Central Committee of the Party has dele-
 gated me to explain some points in this draft.
 The following are a few points that I would like
 to make.
 First, the Draft National Programme for Agri-
 cultural Development in 1956-1967 is put forward at
 a time when the agricultural co-operative movement is
 on the upsurge throughout the country.
 The situation in our country has changed radi-
 cally as a result of Chairman Mao Tse-tung's report,
 "The Question of Agricultural Co-operation," delivered
 last July, and the decisions adopted on the basis of
 this report in the following October by the sixth ple-
 nary session (enlarged) of the seventh Central Com-
 mittee of the Communist Party of China.  Let us re-
 call how things were in the first half of 1955.  At
 that time, as a result of the influence, of rightist con-
 servative ideas, particularly in agricultural co-opera-
 tion, the socialist transformation of agriculture had
 been brought to a standstill; in some cases the trend
 was even reversed; the spirit of progress was being
 suppressed in the countryside, the spirit of reaction
 was in the ascendant; the socialist initiative shown
 by the peasants was checked and capitalist ideas began
 to gain ground; the planned purchase and supply of
 grain, a` socialist measure of paramount importance,
 came up against opposition from the forces of capital-
 28
 ism both in town and countryside. At that time, not
 a few people were worried because the growth of agri-
 culture lagged behind the needs of industry; some even
 became sceptical of the policy of socialist industrializa-
 tion of our country.  At that time, although we never
 lost faith, although we were quite convinced that the
 disequilibrium between industrial and agricultural
 development would certainly be corrected, we had not
 yet mastered the most effective way to deal with this
 problem ; we were not able to rid these people of their
 worries.
 But now things are different.  Since the Central
 Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 grasped the key to the situation, that is, agricul-
 tural co-operation, and correctly tackled this prob-
 lem, the second half of 1955 saw a radical change
 in the situation.  There was an unprecedented up-
 surge of socialist initiative among the overwhelming
 majority of the peasants; a few well-off peasants, rich
 peasants and former landlords were the only excep-
 tions.  The tide of socialist revolution rose through-
 out the countryside.                                                                                    In a few brief months in the
 second half of 1955, the number of peasant house-
 holds which joined agricultural producers' co-opera-
 tives increased from 16,900,000 to 70 million--that is,
 from 14 per cent to over 60 per cent of all peasant
 households.  In some provinces and rural areas under
 municipal authorities, practically all peasant house-
 holds have taken up co-operative farming in its ele-
 mentary form.  At the present time, more and more
 peasant households are joining co-operatives, and the
 percentage is still rising.  It is estimated that before
 the spring ploughing this year, except for certain
 provinces and autonomous regions, all provinces and
 municipalities will have completed ahead of time the
 task set in Point One of the Draft National Pro-
 29
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104/08: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 gramme for Agricultural Development. In other words,
 the plan for agricultural co-operation in its elementary
 form will be completed ahead of time.
 In areas where agricultural co-operation has a
 fairly sound foundation, the growth of co-operatives
 from the elementary to the advanced form (collec-
 tive farms-Ed.), the transition from a semi-socialist
 to a socialist stage, has taken on the character of a
 mass movement.  In other areas, actual steps are
 being taken to set up collective farms. Liaoning Prov-
 ince now has 4,655 collective farms with more o h
 1,600,000 peasant households in them; this is   per
 cent of all peasant households in that province. In
 the Sinsiang Special Administrative Region in Honan
 Province, the switch to collective farms has been vir-
 tually completed.  And there are a great number of
 whole counties, districts and hsiang where co-operative
 farming has reached this higher stage.  It is estimated
 that before the spring ploughing this year, one-gird of
 the total number of peasant households in the country
 will be in collective farms.  If all agricultural pro-
 ducers' co-operatives raise their output this year, it is
 very likely that the task set in Point Two of the Draft
 National Programme for Agricultural Development will
 be realized ahead of time, that is, the drive for advanced
 co-operative farming will be completed in the main
 by 1957 or 1958, depending on local conditions.
 In the past six months, the number of agricultural
 producers' co-operatives has been growing, and grow-
 ing rapidly.  Are they well founded?  Judging from
 the facts, most of them are.  With this swift flowing
 tide of socialist revolution, there is no longer any
 question of cadres urging the masses to join co-ops;
 quite the contrary : plans for promotion of co-opera-
 tive farming made by leading bodies at every level
 have been outstripped again and again by the eager-
 30
 ness of the masses to join co-ops.  The bulk of co-op
 members are in fact already turning their eyes to
 socialism; they are concentrating their efforts on in-
 creasing both agricultural output and subsidiary pro-
 auction.  There is a great deal less thinking about
 narrow personal gains and losses.   At the same time,
 now that the co-operatives have gained experience
 and the Model Draft Regulations for the Agricultural
 Producers' Co-operative have been published, all the
 many concrete problems which crop up and concern
 the economic interests of co-operative members are
 being handled more carefully and in a more reason-
 able way.  Generally speaking, relations between poor
 and middle peasants in the co-operatives are now
 normal and healthy. The essential thing-and the
 most important of all-is that all the agricultural
 producers' co-operatives have made or are making
 plans to increase production, while the peasants are
 showing the greatest keenness in their work.  In 1955,
 there was a record harvest; grain output was more
 than 20 per cent higher than in the peak pre-libera-
 tion year; cotton output was 70 per cent higher.
 Ploughing and planting in the autumn and winter of
 1955 have been done more satisfactorily than in any
 previous year.  In many places, a>>tumn and winter
 drought has been mastered and the plan for sowing
 winter wheat fulfilled and overf ulfilled.  The peasants
 are now busy with their winter tasks and preparing
 for the spring ploughing.  Many jobs which in the
 past were left undone until the spring are now done
 early in the winter.
 I myself am a native of Nanking.            I was down
 there at the beginning of this month, and saw groups
 of peasants on its outskirts busy at work: even in
 cold weather like this, some were ploughing the land,
 some were working on water conservancy projects,
 31

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 some were stocking up manure.                   This is something
 that one rarely saw in the past.  And now it is happen-
 ing not only in the south but in the north as well,
 according to what comrades from other places tell
 me.  This is something new, but it has become a corn
 monplace throughout the country.  During the past
 few years, we kept on telling the peasants m at
 ade in
 saying :  "The plan for the year must
 the spring" was not true.  We said:~~ "The plan for
 the year must be made in the winter," that is, in the
 winter of the previous year. Not very many listened
 to us.  But today this new slogan has actually
 put into practice by the agricultural producers' co-
 operatives and the peasant masses.  There   a wadrain
 ter-
 on supplies of bean-cake, chemical fertilizers,
 double-wheeled and double-shared ploughs and
 other new farm tools.  This well illustrates ho
 the peasants are at work and what initiative they are
 putting into increasing production.
 True enough, in the past six months, agricultural
 producers' co-operatives have been set up in great
 numbers, very swiftly, and they are working well..
 This nation-wide upsurge in agricultural co-operation
 is resulting in an upsurge of. agricultural production
 throughout the country.  This National Programme
 for Agricultural Development is put forward precisely
 because at this time agricultural co-operation and pro-
 duction is rising to a new height. It is timely and fully
 conforms with the needs of the present situation.
 Secondly, the National Programme for Agri-
 cultural Development (1956-1967) has been drawn up
 mainly for the peasants and we must rely mainly on
 the strength of the peasants for its realization. This
 programme shows the peasants in detail how to carry
 out the socialist transformation of agriculture and
 what is the aim of this long-term struggle for the
 32
 development of agriculture.  It also gives a picture
 of the prosperous and happy future of the. Chinese
 countryside.
 The peasants who have gone in for co-operation-
 the peasants who are working hard to build their own
 happy socialist lif e_urgently need a well defined goal
 for their long-term struggle.  Without this it is dif-
 ficult for the agricultural producers' co-operatives to
 work out comprehensive plans.
 The peasants not only need a goal for their long-
 term struggle to develop production : they have also
 put forward a list of demands concerning their ma-
 terial and cultural life.  After raising output, increas-
 ing their incomes and being able to eat and dress well,
 they want to repair their old houses and build new
 ones, to improve their living conditions, learn to read
 and write, to raise their general cultural level; wipe
 out disease and improve sanitary conditions, so as to
 "have healthy people and abundant wealth."  Such a
 list of things making for improvements in the ma-
 terial and cultural life of the peasants in line with
 the rising level of their production is just as it should
 be.  We should try to realize these hopes sooner.
 As Stalin pointed out, the basic economic law of
 socialist development is to continuously develop pro-
 cluction so as to satisfy the growing needs of the peo-
 ple as the level of their material and cultural life rises.
 The National Programme for Agricultural Develop-
 ment put forward by the Central Committee of the
 Chinese Communist. Party, the core of which is the
 development of agricultural co-operation and produc-
 tion, outlines plans to satisfy the peasants' demands
 for a better material and cultural life.  For this rea-
 son, publication of the draft will exert a powerful
 influence on the peasants; it will call on and mobilize
 them for action ; it will give fresh impetus to the
 33
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104/08: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010104108: CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 upsurge of agricultural co-operation and production.
 When the "17 points" drawn up in November 1955 by
 Chairman Mao together with the responsible com-
 rades of various local Party committees were spread
 through the countryside, they played an important
 part in rallying the peasants for action.  Many peas-
 ants in many places exclaimed:  "Now we can see
 what socialism is!" Judging from this we may safely
 predict that the 40 points of this draft will play an
 even greater part in encouraging the 500 million peas-
 ants of China to march bravely forward along the
 road of socialism.
 Realization of this programme depends mainly
 upon the peasants themselves, upon their manpower
 and their material and financial resources. The tasks
 set in this programme include : the promotion of agri-
 cultural co-operation, an increase in agricultural out-
 put and a number of measures to increase production,
 extend afforestation and clothe barren lands with
 greenery, the developing of animal husbandry, fish-
 ing and handicrafts, the wiping out of illiteracy, estab-
 lishment of primary schools, increasing the number
 of broadcasting and receiving sets, the promotion of
 cultural, recreational and athletic activities and of
 health work in the countryside, the improvement of
 housing, and provision of work for the urban unem-
 ployed.  Apart from a few of these things which will
 be done by the state or by the peasants with the
 assistance of the state, all the rest will be done by
 the peasants themselves.
 Are the peasants capable of handling these tasks?
 Of course they are.  They, have a huge amount of
 manpower.  And how about their material and finan-
 cial resources? Suffice it to say that the value of the
 grain and cotton they produced in 1955 over and above
 their output in 1954 was double the amount the gov-
 34
 ernment budgeted in 1955 as expenditure on agri-
 culture, forestry and water conservancy.  Further-
 more, their output is expected to increase every year
 from now on.  That  ' is, their material and financial
 resources will also increase steadily year by year. So
 we can be quite positive in stating that the peasants
 are quite capable of carrying out this programme.
 Of course the state should give the peasants all
 possible financial, economic and technical assistance.
 But it cannot spend too much on these things, espe-
 cially in the next few years.  Too much dependence on
 the state, the habit of looking to it for all kinds of
 investments would place too great a strain on its
 financial resources and would delay or indefinitely post-
 pone the doing of these things. Furthermore, if the
 state spent too much money in this way, it would have
 to reduce its investment in industry, and that would
 mean retarding the progress of our socialist indus-
 trialization.  The postponement or abandonment of
 things which can be done mainly by the peasants
 themselves, or retardation of industrialization of our
 country, would neither serve the interests of our so-
 cialist construction, nor of our people as a whole, nor
 of the peasants.
 As this programme is mainly for the peasants and
 will be carried out mainly by the peasants themselves,
 it should be a convincing document for mobilizing them
 for action.  It should, therefore, be written in a clear
 and concise style easily understood by the peasants.
 During the many discussions some comrades suggested
 additional points for inclusion.  Some concerned work
 which would be carried out entirely by the state, some
 had only a slight bearing on the development of the

 In these many discussions proposals were
 out-
 to include the following items in the programme:s for
 put targets for various agricultural crops; targ
 stock breeding, fishing, forestry and irrigation; tar-
 u h
 gets for the number of tractors and the amount
 chemical fertilizers to be produced and so forth. targets were actually incorporate  in tite r better programme.
 But they were later deleted bc        part of the
 set these targets after thorough study as
 various five-year plans and annual plans of the state.
 In this way it is possible to address the programme
 to the broad mass of the peasants specifically, to give
 them a clear idea of the aim of their long-term strug-
 gle, and the various things they should do to realize
 this aim.  This makes it a more effective instrument
 in mobilizing the broad mass of peasants for action.
 This doesn't mean, of course, that realization of
 this piogramme is an affair for the peasants alone.
 On the contrary, many points in the programme must
 be jointly carried out by town and country.  Many
 government bodies will have to work hard to com-
 plete work set out in the programme and essential
 to its realization.  Every single department concerned
 with agriculture must do its work well. But this is
 not all.  Machine-building departments, too, must ful-
 fil the state plan, and produce and supply the peas-
 ants with new-type farm implements such as double
 wheeled and double-shared ploughs, pumps and
 water raising equipment, and agricultural machinery
 such as tractors.  The chemical industry should fulfil,
 and overfulfil, its task of producing chemical fertilizers.
 36
 Commercial enterprises and supply and marketing co-
 operatives should do a good job in purchasing agri-
 cultural and subsidiary products and supplying
 peasants with the things they need, whether hose anare
 d
 capital or consumer goodCommunications
 to build up
 transport departments should
 local road networks throughout the country, and tele
 phone and postal services in the countryside. Scien
 tific, cultural, educational and health t them in the

 itself declares
 programme. In short, as the programme
 in its very first sentence:  "The great tide of agri-
 cultural co-operation that has swept Chi growth is bring-
 ing forth an immense, nation-wideturn r~s stimulating
 cultural production, and this s national economy and
 the development of the whole
 all branches of science, culture, education and public
 health."
 Leading Party organs and government bodies
 all levels in the country "`should draw up specific plans,
 and
 based on the present draft National Programme
 taking into account conditions peculiar to each locality.
 These plans should specify the successive stages At
 development of every aspect of their local work.
 the same time all state departments concerned with
 economic affairs, with science, culture, education,
 public health, civic affairs or the judiciary should also
 review and revise their plans of work in accordance
 with the present ' National Programme."     mobilized
 Workers and intellectuals must also be
 to give the peasants whatever assistance is needed in
 carrying out this National programme for Agricultural
 Development. Many things listed in the programme-
 such as new farm implements, tractors, telephone sets,
 broadcasting and receiving equipment, medicines Tand
 he
 medical apparatus--are made by the workers.

 peasants have to depend on help from intellectual
 and scientists to carry out many of the tasks set out
 in the programme-both measures connected with.
 increasing production and cultural, educational and
 health work.  Unless the workers and intellectuals
 are mobilized to give this aid this programme can-
 not be realized.
 So, although this programme is mainly for the
 peasants and depends for realization upon their man-
 power, material and financial resources, it is also for
 the whole nation.  Its realization also depends on
 whole-hearted co-operation by the people of the en-
 tire nation, upon mobilization of all the workers, peas-
 ants, intellectuals, and patriotic people in every walk
 of life.
 This draft programme with its 40 points will re-
 main in the form of a draft for the next few months.
 Workers, peasants, intellectuals and patriotic people
 in every sphere of work throughout the land are asked
 to discuss it and give their opinions.
 Thirdly, the tasks put forward in the National
 Programme for Agricultural Development (1956-1967)
 are forward-looking and feasible.  The prerequisites
 and conditions for 'their fulfilment exist ; they can be
 completed ahead of time or overfulfilled.
 The keynote of the programme is to raise agri-
 cultural  output swiftly, to produce things in large
 quantities, to develop agriculture, forestry, cattle-
 breeding, subsidiary occupations, fishing and other pro-
 ductive activities on the basis of co-operation. Special
 emphasis is put on raising within twelve years the
 average yield of grain per mou in three different re-
 gions from 150, 208 and 400 catties in 1955 to 400,
 500, 800 catties respectively; on raising the average
 yield of cotton per nou from the national average of
 35 catties of ginned cotton in 1955 to .60, 80 and 100
 38
 catties respectively depending on local conditions.
 These new standards will give China over two and a
 half times as much grain? and three times as much
 cotton in 1967 as in 1955.  If these central targets
 are reached, there is no doubt that, in keeping with
 the development of production, we can bring about
 the improvements in the peasants' material and cul-
 tural life set forth in the National Programme for
 Agricultural Development.
 The responsible comrades in the localities are full
 of confidence and working with great zeal to reach the
 targets set for increased yields.  Some provinces have
 reported that they can reach these targets ahead of
 time.  When the original seventeen points were re-
 layed to the countryside, the broad mass of peasants
 were similarly filled with confidence and enthusiasm
 in fulfilling the targets for increased production.
 What are these prerequisites and conditions
 which ensure these increased yields ?  The most im-
 portant is the fact that China has a huge population,
 a vast amount of labour power, a pretty good climate,
 and that there are vast potentialities in using labour
 power and land to increase production.  By the time
 co-operative farming, especially socialist co-operative
 farming, is the rule everywhere, a system of collec-
 tive ownership and the principle of "to each accord-
 ing to his work" will replace the system of private
 ownership of means of production.  This will free the
 productive forces. This will foster an astonishing de-
 velopment of the initiative and creativeness of the
 broad mass of peasants in their work ; it will permit
 us to use the available labour force more rationally and
 more effectively, to greatly improve the utilization of
 labour power and labour productivity in general, and
 enable us to make fuller and more reasonable use of
 land, draught animals and farm tools.

 Co-operative farming by pooling the land wipes
 out borders and unnecessary paths between fields and
 so brings more land under cultivation. (Statistics show
 that this can bring 5 per cent more land under cultiva-
 tion, that is to say, add another 80 million mou to the
 country's arable land.)
 Co-operative farming makes it possible to carry
 out water conservancy projects, water and soil con-
 servation, and land and soil improvement   a large
 scale.  Co-operative farming makes it possible
 transform arid land into irrigated fields, and barren
 and waste land into fertile soil.
 Co-operative farming makes it possible to use to
 the full the abilities of all men and women-those who
 are able-bodied, those who are not fully able-bodied,
 and those who can do light tasks-enabling them all
 to engage in many fields of work to help develop pro-
 duction in agriculture, forestry, cattle-breeding, sub-
 sidiary occupations and fishing.
 Co-operative farming makes it possible to have a
 single management for the farm, to cultivate crops
 best suited to the various types of soil, to put more
 labour power into improving the land, to improve
 methods of cultivation by deep ploughing and careful
 weeding, better techniques of sowing and planting; to
 improve the organization of field work and increase
 yields per mou.
 In short, co-operative farming will develop po-
 tentialities for increasing production as never before,
 make it possible to do things on a bigger scale, and
 have more strings to our bows in doing jobs and to
 get more careful cultivation, all of which will greatly
 increase agricultural output, the wealth of society and
 the income of co-operative members.  The reality of
 all this has been proved in practice by numerous co-
 operatives in various parts of the country.  Today
 40
 there are already groups of co-operatives, some whole
 hsiang, districts, and even a few counties where the
 average grain and cotton yield per mou has reached
 or even surpassed the targets which the National
 Programme has set for the next twelve years. Since
 these typically high-yield co-operatives, hsiang, dis-
 tricts, and counties have reached, or even surpassed
 these targets, we have every reason to believe that
 other co-operatives and other hsiang, districts and
 counties in the same areas under more or less similar
 conditions can reach the targets too.  Since these
 typically high-yield co-operatives, hsiang,  districts
 and counties have reached or surpassed the targets
 under the circumstances of today, we have still more
 reason to believe , that with development of indus-
 trialization in the next twelve years, and the gradual
 increase in the number of tractors, water pumps,
 amount of chemical fertilizers, insecticide and farming
 machinery in general, and with more large-scale water
 conservancy projects, it is quite possible for the
 various regions of the country to reach and even sur-
 pass the targets set out in the National Programme.
 The demands for communications, posts and tele-
 communications services, cultural, educational and
 health facilities set out in the National Programme
 are things that have already been realized in many
 agricultural producers'  co-operatives and villages.
 New solutions have also been found for the problem
 of resettling over a million city unemployed-a prob-
 lem many people felt would be difficult to solve in a
 short time.  The Chiahsing Region of Chekiang Prov-
 ince has asked for 100,000 people from Shanghai.
 Kiangsi Province has also asked for half a million
 urban unemployed capable of doing farm work. Need-
 less to say sparsely populated remote regions have an
 even greater need of manpower.  The more than one

 million unemployed left over from pre-liberation days
 will all get jobs in a few years as a result of arrange-
 ments made both in the cities and countryside.
 That is why we say the tasks and demands set
 forth in the National Programme for Agricultural
 Development are both forward-looking and feasible.
 They are not conservative, nor adventurist.  It is
 quite possible to meet these targets ahead of time
 or overfulfil them.  This way of doing things has
 its advantages; it stimulates the local government
 initiative.
 Fourthly, by putting forward the National Pro-
 gramme for Agricultural Development (1956-1967)
 immediately after correctly solving the problem of
 agricultural co-operation, the Central Committee of
 the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung firmly grasped the key link-agriculture;
 this enables our socialist cause to forge ahead still
 more swiftly.
 The essential part of socialist construction is
 socialist industrialization of the country and the core
 of industrialization is development of heavy industry.
 Industry leads agriculture, the city leads the country-
 side and the workers lead the peasants-these are
 unchangeable, fundamental principles of socialism that
 are not to be doubted and cannot be brushed aside.
 But ours is a big country.  It has 600 million
 people.  There are more than 500 million peasants,
 exceeding five-sixths of the population. Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung  in  his  article  On Coalition Government
 pointed out that "the peasants (are) the mainstay of
 the market for China's industry.  It is the peasants
 who are, and alone can be, the largest suppliers of
 foodstuffs and raw materials, and who consume the
 largest amount of manufactured goods." No other
 country in the world has as big a domestic market as
 42
 ours.  The purchasing power of this market is still
 very low (though slightly higher than in pre-libera-
 tion days).  But its potential power is enormous.
 Once   the National  Programme  for  Agricultural
 Development is realized, we shall have a domestic
 market with a fantastically great purchasing power.
 Can there be any other way to develop China's in-
 dustry, save by relying on our own domestic market?
 Of course we can manage to export some of our indus-
 trial products, but we must rely chiefly on our own
 domestic market.  At the present time there are about
 80 million people living in cities and industrial and
 mining areas, and each year they need huge quanti-
 ties of grain and other foodstuffs.  Is there any other
 source to which we can turn to satisfy this demand,
 besides our own, our rural areas?  The purchas-
 ing power of our 600 million people is bound to rise
 steadily, and they will present a formidable demand
 for light industrial products.  Should we try to get
 raw materials for our light industry mainly from
 foreign countries, instead of relying on the domestic
 supply of raw materials?  Our agriculture also needs
 a huge quantity of means of production.  If we are
 to use tractors on all our farmlands that can be tilled
 by machines, we, will need 1,200,000 to 1,500,000
 standard 15 h.p. tractors.  Between 120,000 and
 150,000 worn-out tractors will have to be replaced by
 new ones every year.  If we make extensive use of
 chemical fertilizers, we will need at least 20 million
 tons of nitrate fertilizer, besides phosphate and po-
 tassium fertilizer.  This again means a huge domestic
 market for heavy industry.  Furthermore, the de-
 velopment of agriculture means an important source
 for the accumulation of funds for socialist construc-
 tion.  So we can see that unless we correctly solve
 the agricultural problem, unless we bring about a
 43

 tremendous development of agriculture, our socialist
 industrialization will. run into serious difficulties.
 China is a big. country with 600 million people
 and over five-sixths of them are peasants-this is a
 fundamental fact which in our work of building so-
 cialism we ignore at our peril.  Nevertheless, if any-
 one thinks that socialist industrialization is not the
 main thing, and refuses to recognize the leadership of
 the working class, he is making a gross mistake. We
 take serious note of the important role our five hun-
 dred million peasants are playing in the socialist con-
 struction of our country.  We must take serious note
 of the extremely important bearing agriculture has
 on industrial development. By putting forward this
 National Programme for Agricultural Development
 (1956-1967) at this moment, during the great upsurge
 in agricultural co-operation, the Political Bureau of
 the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
 Party has systematically solved the most difficult and
 complicated problem of our socialist revolution-the
 problem of the peasantry and agriculture.  As a result,
 we shall be able to strengthen still further the worker-
 peasant alliance on a new basis, accelerate the prog-
 ress of socialist industrialization and fulfil the funda-
 mental task of our country during the transition
 period ahead of time.

 DECISIONS ON AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION
 Adopted at the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged)
 of the Seventh Central Committee of the
 Communist Party of China
 (These decisions were adopted on October 11, 1955, in the light
 of Comrade Mao Tse-tung's report "The Question of Agricul-
 tural Co-operation" delivered at a meeting of secretaries of
 provincial, municipal and autonomous region committees of the
 Communist Party of China on July 31, 1955)
 At the present moment, a profound movement of
 socialist transformation is taking place in the rural
 areas.                   Between the spring of 1954 and the summer
 of 1955 the number of agricultural producers' co-
 operatives rose from 100,000 to nearly 650,000.  The
 number of peasant households in the agricultural pro-
 ducers' co-operatives rose from 1,800,000 to 16,900,000.
 That is about 15 per cent of all peasant households in
 China.  The progress of the movement is, however,
 uneven.  In many parts of the old liberated areas it
 has already assumed the form of a huge mass move-
 ment.                                                                                     This is because the peasants there have a
 richer experience of revolutionary struggle,  and
 mutual-aid teams (which serve as a foundation for
 ca-operation) have existed there for many years. For
 instance, in provinces in North China, like Shansi, 41
 per cent of the peasant households have joined the
 co-operatives while in Hopei, 35 per cent have joined.

 Thirty-four per cent of all peasant households in the
 three northeastern provinces are in co-operatives.  In
 some hsiang,1 districts and even counties in these re-
 gions, 60, 70 or even 80 per cent of all peasant house-
 holds have joined co-operatives.  In the provinces in
 Southeast, Central-South, Southwest and Northwest
 China that were liberated later on, most hsiang already
 have their first groups of agricultural producers' co-
 operatives.  This has paved the way for a great
 expansion of the agricultural co-operative movement.
 The facts confirm the estimate of the Central
 Committee of the Party that the tide of social reform
 in the countryside-in the shape of co-operation-will
 soon sweep the entire country.  It has already reached
 some places.
 II
 Faced with the daily growth of the agricultural
 co-operative movement, the Party's task is to lead the
 movement forward, boldly and according to plan, not
 timidly.  It must be understood that in leading the
 peasants to overthrow imperialism and feudalism, our
 Party carried out a bourgeois-democratic revolution.
 But the aim of the working class is to continue the
 advance and follow up that revolution by leading the
 peasants to embark on a socialist revolution.  In the
 earlier stage of the revolution the class struggle in the
 rural areas was chiefly a struggle between the peasants
 and the landlord class.  The peasant question which
 had to be solved then was that of land.  In this new
 stage of the revolution, however, the class struggle in
 the countryside is chiefly between the peasants on the

 one hand and rich peasants and other capitalist ele-
 ments on the other.  It is essentially a struggle over
 the choice between two roads-the development of
 socialism or of capitalism.  The question to be solved
 is a new peasant question-the problem of agricultural
 co-operation.  New relationships within the worker-
 peasant alliance and the leading role of the working
 class in this alliance must be established and strength-
 ened on the basis of concerting the development of
 socialist industrialization and agricultural co-operation.
 China's industry is growing rapidly.  Facts show
 that if the development of agricultural co-operation
 fails to keep pace with it, if the increase in grain and
 industrial crops lags behind, China's socialist in-
 dustrialization will run into great difficulties.  The
 situation has already changed fundamentally, but the
 attitude of some of our comrades to the peasant ques-
 tion still remains at the old stage.  They fail to see
 the sharp struggle over the choice between the two
 roads which is now taking place in the rural areas.
 They fail to see the active desire of the majority of
 the peasants to take the road to socialism.  They are
 satisfied .that the peasants have obtained land from
 the landlords, and want to keep things as they are in
 the villages, or contend that the speed at which agri-
 cultural co-operation develops should be very slow.
 They fail to understand that this means abandoning
 the active leadership of the Party in the movement
 for agricultural co-operation and allowing capitalism
 to develop freely in the rural areas. This would result
 in undermining the worker-peasant alliance, losing
 working-class leadership of the peasantry and so head-
 ing the cause of socialism for defeat.  Comrades with
 such misguided views are afraid to trust the masses.
 They are pessimistic about the policy on co-operation
 of the Central Committee of the Party and about the

 leadership . of.. the local. Party committees at various
 levels. They assume that our Party can hardly con-
 solidate the. several hundred thousand small co-opera-
 tives that already exist, and that any large-scale
 expansion is certainly inconceivable.  They have put
 forward a Right-opportunist policy ' of "drastic com-
 pression," and in some places dissolved a large number
 of co-operatives by compulsion and "orders from
 above."  Yet this pessimism is in practice shown to
 be unfounded by the growing consolidation of the
 several hundred thousand co-operatives which already
 exist, the increased output of the great majority of
 them, and the active desire of the peasant masses to
 join them.  The bankruptcy of this Right opportunism
 is thus exposed and shown up for what it really is-a
 reflection of the demand of the bourgeoisie and the
 spontaneous growth of forces towards capitalism in
 the rural areas. The Sixth Plenary Session holds
 that the criticism made by the Political Bureau of
 the Central Committee against Right opportunism is
 absolutely correct and necessary.  We can bring about
 a fundamental change in the Party's rural work and
 alter the situation in which leadership lags behind the
 mass movement only when this Right opportunism is
 thoroughly criticized and repudiated.  This change is
 vital if progress in the agricultural co-operative move-
 ment is to continue till complete victory is. won.
 III
 It is possible to develop agricultural co-operation
 primarily because we have established in our country
 a people's democratic dictatorship headed by the work-
 , ing class,  and because this people's  democratic
 dictatorship is now engaged in organizing our socialist
 construction.  At the same time, it is possible because
 'the majority of the peasants are willing to take the
 socialist road in order to get rid of exploitation and
 poverty.. The majority here referred to are mainly
 the poor peasants who have not yet risen to a better
 economic position, the lower middle peasants among
 the new middle peasants who were formerly poor
 peasants, and the lower middle peasants among the
 old middle peasants.'  Since the land reform the
 economic condition of these sections of the peasantry
 has improved to varying extents, but many peasant
 households still have their difficulties or are still not
 well-off, while some have again lost their share of land
 because of exploitation by rich peasants or speculative
 merchants, or because they were unable to withst  o
 natural calamities. Therefore, if the Party fails to
 give the peasants active guidance along the socialist
 road, capitalism will inevitably grow in the rural areas
 and the separation of the rural population into two
 extremes will become serious.  Actual experience has
 taught the peasants that they cannot go on living as
 they used to-farming scattered, tiny plots on their
 own-that the only way out is for a large number
 people to come together, pool their labour and work
 under collective management.   The advantages of this
 method were first shown by the numerous mutual-aid
 teams and, even more, later, by the large number
 of agricultural producers' co-operatives which were
 established.  Agricultural producers' co-operatives can
 organize labour power rationally. so that productivity
 can be raised more rapidly; they can systematicallY
 and effectively use land and extend the area under
 i Old middle peasants are those who were middle peasants
 before the land reform. New middle peasants are those who
 have risen to the status of middle peasants since the land
 reform.-Translator.         .

 cultivation; they can resist or reduce the ravages of
 nature, and, with state help, gradually introduce
 technical reforms in agriculture.                For these and other
 reasons, they are able to bring about a speedy develop-
 ment of the productive forces in agriculture and
 give the peasants substantial benefits.  That is what
 accounts for the growing popularity of agricultural
 producers' co-operatives among the peasants.
 As the past few years' experience shows, the fol-
 lowing procedure will enable the co-operative move-
 ment to develop on an even firmer foundation:
 1.  As the movement progresses, an acute strug-
 gle will be waged against the rich peasants and
 speculative merchants, and the peasants themselves
 will be educated in the midst of the struggle.  The
 mass of the middle peasants in particular must be
 educated and convinced so that they can stop vacil-
 lating between the socialist and capitalist roads.
 Therefore, the movement must be given a firm core
 -a core formed of the active elements among the
 poor peasants who have not yet been elevated to a bet-
 ter economic position and those of the lower middle
 peasants among the new middle peasants who were
 formerly poor peasants.  It should also include part
 of the active elements of the lower middle peasants
 among the old middle peasants.  The first step to be
 taken by the Party in the co-operative movement
 should be to organize these people, so that they can
 set an example and convince other peasants.
 2.  Although these sections of the peasantry-
 the poor peasants and the lower middle peasants among
 both new and old middle peasants, stand fairly close
 to each other as far as their economic condition is
 concerned, their active desire to join the co-operatives
 will for a time differ in degree for various reasons.
 Therefore, every year we should carry out work among
 10
 them so that they will, over the next few years, or-
 ganize themselves group by group, according to the
 degree of their understanding, into new co-operatives,
 or be absorbed into existing ones.  Patience must be
 exercised towards those who, for the time being, do
 not wish to join, even if they are poor or lower middle
 peasants.  The principle of voluntariness should never
 be violated; they should not be dragged into co-opera-
 tives against their will.  A peasant may put forward
 and withdraw his name for membership several times
 before he finally makes his mind up.  He should be
 given plenty of time to consider the matter.
 3.  Well-to-do middle  peasants   (that is,  the
 upper middle peasants among both the old and new
 middle peasants) have better farm tools and draught
 animals, their land is more intensively cultivated, its
 yield is higher, or they derive a bigger income from
 subsidiary occupations.  As long as they still do not
 realize that the benefits derived from co-operative
 farming are greater than-or at least, for the time
 being, equal to-those obtained by working on their
 own, they will not readily join a co-operative.  If they
 join reluctantly, frequent conflicts are bound to arise
 among the members over the practical question of
 benefits. That is why, when a co-operative is organized,
 it is not advisable at the start to accept well-to-do
 middle peasants unless they show a genuine willing-
 ness to join, still less to drag them in against their
 will.  Efforts should be made to influence them by
 showing them the advantages of co-operative farming,
 letting them wait and see for a bit and not enrolling
 them till their understanding grows.
 4.  The middle peasants are the permanent allies
 of the working class and the poor peasants.  Good
 relations should be maintained with them both inside
 and outside the co-operatives.  Their interests should
 11

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 never be infringed nor their property taken from them.
 The backward ideas of the middle peasants, particular-
 ly the tendency towards capitalism of the well-to-do
 middle peasants, should be properly countered by
 convincing argument, not dealt with by arbitrary
 administrative methods.  The purpose of criticism
 must be to achieve unity. It must never be used as a
 pretext for attacking the middle peasants.
 5.  Before setting up co-operatives it is essential
 that the masses should be mentally prepared and
 that Rightist tendencies in the Party should be
 censured and overcome. Our Party's principles, policy
 and measures on agricultural co-operation must be
 publicized, systematically and repeatedly, among the
 mass of the peasants.  And not only should the ad-
 vantages of co-operation be made known to them; they
 should also be made aware of the difficulties that may
 arise in the course of co-operation and how such
 difficulties can be overcome.
 6.  The masses should be prepared organiza-
 tionally for the formation of co-operatives.  Agricul-
 tural producers' mutual-aid teams must be promoted
 on a really widespread scale ; wherever possible they
 should be combined into joint teams so as to lay the
 groundwork for turning them into co-operatives. Joint
 committees of mutual-aid teams and co-operatives may
 be established in villages where there are mutual-aid
 teams and co-operatives.  These should hold regular
 meetings, to which representatives of individual peas-
 ants should be invited so that experience can be ex-
 changed and arrangements made for whatever mutual
 help is needed and possible.  This will pave the way
 for the future merging of co-operatives, the gradual
 transformation of mutual-aid : teams into co-operatives
 and the drawing of individual peasants step by step
 into the co-operatives.
 12
 7.  Short-term training of cadres for running
 co-operatives is an important preparation for the
 setting up of co-operatives. Those to be trained should
 be carefully chosen.
 IV
 The growth of the co-operative movement should
 go hand in hand with the consolidation of existing co-
 operatives. It is one-sided and wrong to pay attention
 only to consolidation and disregard expansion, to deny
 that an increase in the number of co-operatives would
 help raise their quality.  It is equally one-sided and
 wrong to pay attention only to expansion and to
 disregard consolidation, attaching importance only to
 the number of co-operatives and ignoring their quality.
 Therefore, once they are established, co-operatives
 should take steps to check over their work systematic-
 ally.  Checking over of the co-operatives should be
 carried out not just once, but twice or three times a
 year, so as to keep on improving their quality.
 1.. Each co-operative, in the light of its own
 special characteristics and current practical problems,
 should draw up a policy and measures for checking.
 2.  The work of checking should be carried out
 group by group, starting with those co-operatives
 which have the most problems. The varied experience
 gained in checking over different types of co-operatives
 should be made known to help push forward the entire
 movement.
 3.  Those carrying out the work of checking
 should have a warm and helpful attitude and approach
 this work with care.  It should not be done in an over-
 simplified and arbitrary manner.  It is utterly wrong
 to decide beforehand the number of co-operatives that
 must be cut down and then forcibly dissolve them.
 13
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 It is also entirely wrong to be harsh towards
 those co-operatives which have been "spontaneously
 organized."  They should be given warm help after
 careful consideration of their cases.
 4.  In checking  over  co-operatives,  attention
 should be focussed on production, for that is the key
 issue. In the course of organizing production various
 problems should be unearthed and solved methodically;
 ideological work among co-operative members should
 be intensified; management improved; and the Party
 policy on the co-operative movement of voluntariness
 and mutual benefit thoroughly carried out.
 5.  During such checking, attention should also
 be paid to improving the make-up of the co-operatives,
 reshuffling their leading members as need arises, and
 training of new key personnel from among the poor
 peasants.
 6.  The hsiang Party and Youth League branches
 must be relied on both for establishing co-operatives
 and checking them over.  The key to the successful
 running of co-operatives lies in the strengthening
 of the work of Party and Youth League branches.
 Therefore, the work of building and checking over
 co-operatives should be closely associated with the
 building and strengthening of the Party and Youth
 League branches in the countryside.  In carrying out
 all such work the local cadres in the rural areas should
 be the mainstay, cadres sent from above should be an
 auxiliary force.
 V
 At the present stage agricultural producers' co-
 operatives in our country are generally of an elemen-
 tary, semi-socialist type, characterized by the pooling
 14
 of land and a single management.  This kind of
 co-operative is a transitional form to the fully socialist
 type.  Private ownership of land and some other
 important means of production is, in the main, or to
 a considerable extent, retained, and privately-owned
 means of production are not to be hastily turned into
 common property.  That is to say, both during the
 period of establishing and of checking over co-
 operatives, the private property of the members should
 be dealt with in a reasonable way, in line with the
 principle of mutual benefit, so as to make it easier to
 expand the co-operatives and put them on a sound
 footing.  This means that co-operatives pay a certain
 amount of compensation for the use of private land,
 draught animals and large farm tools, and reasonable
 prices for such private means of production as
 draught animals and farm tools when transferred to
 the co-operatives as common property.
 The means of production owned by members of
 co-operatives differ in number and quality.  Moreover,
 it is necessary for different co-operatives in different
 areas to take varying circumstances into account
 when they decide on how and when the means of pro-
 duction owned by members are to be hired or trans-
 ferred to the co-operatives as common property.                                                                                          In
 view of this, suitable agreements must be reached
 between co-operative members, and chiefly between the
 poor and middle peasants, on all these questions, as
 well as on the question of subsidiary occupations.
 1.  As regards the land belonging to members of
 the co-operatives:
 a. Methods of assessing the yield of land to be
 pooled in the co-operatives should be based on the
 quality of the land, giving due consideration to the
 economic interests of those members the yield of whose
 land is, owing to lack of means, relatively low but
 15
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 can be raised after being pooled in the co-operative.
 Likewise, due consideration should be given to the
 value of the labour and fertilizer previously applied to
 the land by its owner on the basis of its actual yield
 for a normal year.  In this way, conflicts arising out
 of differences in the actual yield as well as in the latent
 productivity of the land can be solved amicably
 between the poor and middle peasants, and this will
 make for greater enthusiasm on the part of the mem-
 bers to raise the productivity of the land and to invest
 in it.
 b.  Different methods are used in different areas
 to decide what dividends will be paid on land pooled
 in co-operatives.  Generally speaking, the method of
 giving a filed dividend is good for encouraging the
 members' enthusiasm for work.  The method of giving
 dividends on land and paying for labour according to
 a fixed ratio is suitable, however, in newly organized
 co-operatives or in areas where the yield tends to
 fluctuate.  In certain places some methods supple-
 mentary to these have been adopted. Whatever method
 is used, attention should be paid to the following
 points:
 The amount paid out in dividends on land should
 generally be lower than the amount paid out for labour.
 It is wrong to set the dividend on land too high. But
 at the same time consideration should be given to those
 co-operative member households which are short of
 labour power but have more land, especially those of
 the old, weak, orphaned or widowed, so that they can
 get a suitable income.  It is just as wrong to fix the
 dividend on land too low.
 The proportion of income decided on as dividend
 for land should not be arbitrarily standardized. Con-
 sideration should be given to the difference in condi-
 tions between areas which have relatively less land
 16
 and more people, and those which have more land and
 fewer people, as well as to the specific circumstances
 of certain areas which grow industrial crops requiring
 more field work.
 In view of the peasants' predilection for the
 private ownership of land, the amount of dividend
 which the co-operatives decide to pay on land should
 remain constant for a certain period, say two or three
 years after a co-operative is founded, and should not
 be lowered each year; still less should dividends on
 land be discontinued prematurely,
 C.  Co-operative members should be allowed to
 retain small plots of land of their own, amounting to
 about two to five per cent of the average individual
 land-holding in the village, for growing vegetables, or
 for subsidiary agricultural products and occupations.
 The produce of such plots may be kept for home use
 or sold on the market.  Some co-operatives have re-
 fused to allow their members to retain any land for
 their own use.  That is wrong.
 2.  As regards draught animals and farm tools
 belonging to members of the co-operatives:
 a.  Great care must be taken while deciding
 whether draught animals belonging to me
 b
 m
 ers shall
 k1 be transferred to the co-operatives as common prop-
 erty.                                                                                  During the first year or two after they are
 formed, and while they are still economically weak or
 lack administrative experience, the co-operatives may
 retain the private ownership and rearing of draught
 animals, and hire them on a temporary or long-term
 basis so that the co-operatives may avoid incurring
 too many debts or losing animals through improper
 feeding.  As productivity increases, the co-operatives
 may purchase the animals in such ways as circum-
 stances permit.  Those co-operatives which bought
 draught animals when they were established need not,
 17
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 however, reverse their decision, provided that lthey
 fairly
 organized on a sound basis and econom the animals
 well off and that the original owners of
 objection.
 or other members of the co-operative raise no  J
 In some places, there is no difficulty in getting
 fodder but the charge for the hire of draught animals
 is rather high.  In cases like this, if it is beneficial
 to the production of the co-operatives to buysenthe
 t
 animals somewhat earlier and if the owners
 conditions
 the co-operatives can do so proviofd local production needs
 permit.  In other places, because   pro
 or the local custom among the peasants of feeding their
 draught animals jointly, co-opervaadopt the
 period before the animals are purchased, method of individual ownership of animals and co-
 operative rearing (or co-operative rearing during busy
 seasons and private rearing during slack seasons).
 This is permissible if it is convenient for farm work
 and the draught animals can be fed properly.
 b.  Contracts for the hire or purchase o animals should be signed after the co-operatives have
 conducted thorough negotiations with members who
 own the beasts.  Reasonable fees should be fixed anfor
 d
 the hire of animals depending on their condition, be
 reasonable prices and terms of payment should fixed for the purchase of animals by co-operatives.
 When payment is made by instalments, a certain
 amount of interest should be paid to owners before
 final instalment is cleared. The length of time taken to
 pay off the instalments may vary according to econom-
 ic conditions in various areas and co-operatives.  In
 general, three years is reasonable; anyhow, it should
 not be longer than five.  There are some co-operatives
 which set too low a price on draught animals and too
 long a period for payment; there are even cases where
 is
 no definite date is set and no interest is paid at all.
 This has led to members neglecting their animals.  It
 must be put right.
 C.  Co-operatives should make appropriate ar-
 rangements frr the use of the big, medium and small
 draught animals which are hired, bought by the co-
 operatives or owned and used privately.  In order to
 breed more draught animals, special care should be
 given to pedigree beasts and the protection of young
 animals.
 d.  In dealing with large and fairly large farm
 tools owned by members, too, co-operatives can, after
 renting for a certain period, buy them over one by one.
 Co-operatives should pay a reasonable sum for the
 hire of such tools and pay by instalments if they are
 bought. There are some co-operatives which use their
 members' farm tools for prolonged periods but pay
 nothing for their hire or upkeep, and no compensation
 when they are damaged.  This must be corrected.
 3.  As regards means of production for sub-
 sidiary occupations such as groves of trees, fish-ponds,
 etc. belonging to members of the co-operatives:
 a.  A distinction should be made between those
 subsidiary occupations which are best run individually
 and those which are best run collectively.  It is un-
 suitable to bring into the co-operatives means of pro-
 duction used in subsidiary occupations which can be
 made better use of under individual management, and
 it is even more unsuitable to make them the property
 of the co-operatives.  Those which can be better used
 under collective management, which will help improve
 the economic status of all members to a greater ex-
 tent, may be gradually brought under the management
 of the co-operatives after negotiations with the owners,
 19
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 either by hiring them or buying them on the instal-
 ment plan.
 b.  Members' small holdings of trees (including
 fruit trees, bamboos and other trees used for industrial
 purposes) may in general be left to the management
 of members themselves.  Where members own groves
 or orchards and there is need for unified planning of
 agricultural and forestry production, they may be
 brought with the owners' consent under the single
 management of the co-operative, but the private own-
 ership of them remains.                         The method of distributing
 income from such groves and orchards must be settled
 through thorough negotiations among members.
 The question of fish-ponds owned by members may
 be dealt with according to circumstances in the same
 way as that of groves and orchards.
 VI
 In. order to put their collective economy on a sound
 basis, agricultural producers' co-operatives should
 gradually build up common funds in two main forms,
 namely, a shares fund and a reserve fund.
 The shares fund is built up in the following way.
 lverv member makes a contribution towards the costs
 r,1'r,roducttof covering seed, fertilizer, fodder. etc., or
 t*,warr(ls the cost of draught animals and tools bought
 i'rorr, members.  The amount of the contribution is
 ~rw~sed r,,1 ?;he amount of land pooled (or in some cases
 (,n al, agreed ratio between the laTld and labour con-
 'i buted, or iu others, whert, land is plentiful and
 a 1ifs 1It f'ox it low, on labour only) .  r1he share each
 ;i)(,uid   L/ whou1d he ProPerly worked out, and should
 ~)G wither, the i~ow' of the majority of membt rs to
 20
 pay.  Payments to the shares fund may be made in
 cash or kind.  If the amount paid in kind is more
 than is needed, the balance should be credited to the
 member concerned as investment.  Poor peasants who
 cannot afford to contribute to the shares fund may be
 helped by state loans.
 The amount to be set aside each year as a reserve
 fund for increasing the co-operative's means of pro-
 duction must be decided according to the actual cir-
 cumstances.  Generally speaking, it is better in the
 first few years that it should not exceed five per cent
 of the total annual income from agriculture and sub-
 sidiary occupations  (gross output less production
 costs) .  Later, as output grows, this proportion can
 be suitably raised. The fund set aside for the wel-
 fare of members should, in the first few years, gen-
 erally speaking, not exceed one per cent of a co-
 operative's total annual income.  Depending on local
 conditions, the relative amounts to be set aside for
 the reserve and welfare funds may be slightly higher
 in co-operatives in areas cultivating industrial crops.
 When a member withdraws from a co-operative,
 he may take with him his share contribution but not
 any of the reserve fund or welfare fund.  There must
 be a revision of the regulations given in the "Decisions
 on the Development of Mutual Aid and Co-operation
 in Agricultural Production" issued by the Central
 Committee of the Communist Party of China in March
 1953, in as far as they specify "complete freedom for
 members to withdraw both their invested capital and
 their contributions to the reserve fund" when leaving
 the co-operatives.
 Apart from the shares fund and the reserve fund,
 members should be encouraged to invest in the co-
 operatives, which should repay capital so invested, with
 interest, at regular intervals.

 VII
 Agricultural producers' co-operatives must adopt
 measures to ensure the growth of their productive
 powers and prove in practice that co-operatives are
 much superior to individual farming and mutual-aid
 teams.
 1.  They should draw up their annual production
 plans and long-term over-all production plans, make
 full use of all favourable factors in the co-operatives
 or. in the locality, unearth the key factors which make
 for increased output, and develop the latent capacity
 in agricultural production.
 a.  They should improve farming skills and
 methods by such means as deep ploughing and inten-
 sive cultivation, planting rationally in close rows, in-
 creasing the number of crops harvested annually,
 using good seed, popularizing new farm tools and
 fighting plant diseases and pests.
 They should pay attention to learning from
 veteran farmers and absorbing all that is valuable in
 their experience; they should take energetic measures
 to teach the young men and women members to im-
 prove their farming skills.
 b.  They should undertake capital construction
 where necessary and possible, for example, building
 small water conservancy projects, terracing fields,
 improving the soil, work on conservation of soil and
 water, buying draught animals and farm tools.  They
 should use locally-produced natural fertilizer and make
 great efforts to accumulate and prepare fertilizer.
 Appropriate payment should be made to members who
 hand over their accumulated fertilizer to the co-
 operatives for public use.
 c.  They should expand the area under cultivation
 and plant high-yield crops.  Wherever there are
 22
 water-ways or other water sources, the acreage of rice
 should be extended as much as possible in order to
 further increase grain output.
 d.  A diversified economy should be developed in
 accordance with local conditions and with the plans
 of the local state organs, to include agriculture, handi-
 crafts, livestock breeding, forestry, fruit growing,
 fishery and other subsidiary occupations.
 To develop the economy of hilly, well-forested
 areas where livestock breeding prevails, producers' co-
 operatives may be organized to combine agriculture,
 forestry and livestock breeding.
 2.  The valuable experience of those co-operatives
 which have successfully built up a system of fixed
 responsibility for a specified job should be publicized,
 and labour power should be rationally organized.
 Where such a system of responsibility cannot be
 practised all the year round, it may be adopted on a
 temporary or seasonal basis to prepare the ground
 for a year-round system of responsibility.
 a.  Systems should be introduced to specify the
 responsibilities of production brigades and groups and
 their individual members as regards cultivation, live-
 stock breeding and the care of farm tools.  Labour
 discipline should be tightened up.
 b.  A labour production quota (that is, a standard
 work-day) system covering both quantity and quality
 should be introduced on a piece-work basis, on the
 principle that "he who works more is paid more and
 he who works less gets less."
 C.  A regular inspection system should be in-
 troduced whereby the work of the production brigades
 and groups and their individual members can be ex-
 amined at all levels and any work that falls below
 standard improved in good time.
 23

 3
 d.  A system of rewards for above-quotaprodu?c-
 tion should be adopted, tied to a seasonal
 year-round system of responsibility.  Those who
 overf ulfil their production plans should be rewarded
 and those who fall behind because of slackness should
 have deductions made from their pay.  In the event
 of natural calamities, production quotas should be
 revised taking into account the resultant difficulties.
 Those who work hard in combatting calamities and
 exceed their revised production quotas should be re-
 warded. .  Those who do little or nothing to
 revised
 natural calamities and so fail to  each
 quotas should be penalized.
 3. An industrious and thrifty attitude should
 be encouraged in running co-operatives.  Fina weal
 management and book-keeping should be improved.
 Financial work should be such as to supervise r n d
 ensure a growth in production and a proper hou distribu-
 should
 tion of income.  Slack financial management
 tion                                          b-
 cut out and waste and extravagance checked. The
 a.  A limit should be set to all expenditure.
 simple and convenient system of "fixing a maximum
 expenditure for each item" should be widely adopted.
 d
 Those who economize should be rewarded, and
 guilty of corruption or waste penalized.
 b.  Reliable book-keepers should be selected a
 a mutual-help network set up among. book-keep i s of
 co-operatives to exchange experience.
 4.  Political, cultural and educational work should
 be improved to raise the level of socialist conscthe r
 ness among co-operative members and develop
 keenness and creativeness.
 a.  Our country's socialist cause and the momen-
 tous significance of agriculture in the economic life of
 the nation should be widely publicized among co-
 operative members.  The state plans for economic
 24
 construction, particularly the agricultural production
 plan and the plan for the purchase of agricultural prod-
 uce, should be publicized among co-operative members
 and they should be shown how to properly implement
 the policy of the state on rural work and the planned
 purchase of grain and other farm produce.
 b.  The idea of collective concern for the co-
 operative and for common property should be instilled
 in members, and efforts should be made to gradually
 overcome individualist tendencies.  Behaviour detri-
 mental to labour discipline should be checked.
 C.  Unity and mutual help should be promoted
 among production brigades and groups and individual
 members, and emulation in labour introduced.  Un-
 remitting research into and improvement of farming
 technique should be fostered.  Care should be taken
 to bring the energies of the women and the younger
 members of the co-operatives into full play.
 d.  Democracy should be promoted within the co-
 operatives and members encouraged to put forward
 rationalization proposals to improve the work.
 e.  Plans should be drawn up to eliminate illiter-
 acy over a period of years and to raise the cultural
 level of members, particularly of cadres.
 f.  Co-operative members should be educated to
 raise their political vigilance so that they can wage
 an unrelenting struggle against all forms of counter-
 revolutionary sabotage.
 VIII
 Financial and economic departments concerned,
 and especially agricultural  administrative  depart-
 ments, must treat financial and technical aid for the
 agricultural co-operative movement as one of their
 most important tasks.

 1.  Besides issuing loans to poor peasants to help
 them take up shares in agricultural producers'
 and thus facilitate co-oper  ? Bank and
 them and the middle peasants, t people's the Agricultural Bank should gradually
 co- increase the
 opera-
 amounts loaned to agricultural producers'
 for investment in capital construction, reduce
 interest rates where appropriate, and extend
 period of repayment of loans which can be set at three
 to five years.
 2.  Departments  concerned  with  agriculture
 should set up agro-technical stations in a planned

 administration should pay attention to the training of
 a large number of book-keepers and gradually send a
 sufficient number of book-keeping instructors, who can
 travel from place to place to give guidance to co-
 operative farms in improving their book-keeping and
 accounting methods.  Book-keepers in  district or
 hsianq branches of the People's Bank, the Agricultural
 Bank and the supply and marketing co-operatives
 should do their best to help agricultural producers'
 co-operatives with their book-keeping and accounting.
 Ix
 As the co-operative movement develops, many
 former landlords, rich peasants and counter-revolu-
 tionaries of various sorts will undoubtedly engage in
 all kinds of sabotage.  We must be alert to the serious
 danger of such sabotage in the agricultural co-
 operative movement.                                                                                            Quite a number of landlords,
 rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries have already
 wormed their way in various guises into co-operatives.
 Some have even seized important positions in them,
 pushing their way into the leadership in an effort to
 turn them into their tools or destroy them by under-
 hand means.  They try to undermine the Party leader-
 ship in co-operatives, attack and victimize the active
 elements among the masses and the cadres of the co-
 operatives, slaughter livestock, destroy farm crops and
 even commit such crimes as arson and assassination.

 Some landlords, rich peasants and counter-revolution-
 aries have even organized sham co-operatives.  It
 must therefore be laid down that:
 1.  In places where the great majority of peas-
 ants have not yet joined co-operatives, for the next
 few years landlords or rich peasants must be resolutely
 debarred from joining co-operatives.  Only in those
 places where the great majority of peasants have
 joined co-operatives and the co-operatives are on a
 sound basis can former landlords or rich peasants be
 permitted to join in different groups at different time,
 and then only on condition that they are law-abiding
 and have for a long time ceased to exploit others and
 have themselves engaged in work.  This may be done
 in order that their reform can be continued through
 collective work in production.
 2.  Landlords or rich peasants who have already
 joined the co-operatives should be dealt with in-
 dividually according to how they have behaved since
 joining. Those who have engaged in sabotage must
 be resolutely expelled. Cases of serious misdemeanour
 should be handed over to the courts.  Only those who
 work and are law-abiding may be permitted to remain
 and continue their reform in the co-operatives.
 3.  Measures appropriate to the circumstances
 must be taken to clean up and reorganize those co-
 operatives in which landlords, rich peasants or counter-
 revolutionaries have gained control of posts.
 4.  Sham co-operatives organized by landlords,
 rich peasants or counter-revolutionaries must be
 dissolved.  Educational work suited to each individual
 case should be carried out among the poor and middle
 peasants who joined such co-operatives; they should
 be reorganized in a proper way.
 In various provinces there are still backward
 villages where the agrarian reform was not carried
 28
 out in a thorough-going way.  Such villages total
 approximately 5 per cent of all villages.  Feudal land-
 lords, rowdies, counter-revolutionaries and other bad
 elements in these places are still exploiting and op-
 pressing the peasants, either openly or in secret.  In
 such villages, it is also possible to organize the active
 and reliable elements among the poverty-stricken peas-
 ants to form co-operatives.  At the same time, it is
 essential to get the masses fully on the move as soon
 as possible, resolutely wipe out the feudal and counter-
 revolutionary forces, and so create the conditions
 necessary for smooth development of agricultural
 co-operation.
 X
 To give active, planned leadership to the move-
 ment for agricultural co-operation, national, provincial
 (or autonomous region), administrative region  (or
 autonomous chou), county (or autonomous county),
 district, hsiang (or nationality hsiang) and village
 plans should be drawn up for the co-operative move-
 ment to be carried out in stages.  In making such
 plans, attention should be paid to specific differences
 which the co-operative movement shows in different
 places, as well as to similarities.
 Because different conditions obtain in different
 areas, the progress of agricultural co-operation may,
 generally speaking, differ in the following ways :
 1.  In places  where the  mutual-aid  and co-
 operative movement is relatively well advanced, and
 where, by the summer of 1955, between 30 and 40 per
 cent of all peasant households had joined co-operatives,
 the movement can, generally speaking, be expanded
 by the spring of. 1957 to embrace 70 or 80 per cent of

 the peasant households.  That is to say, in such areas,
 the building of semi-socialist co-operatives can be
 basically completed by that time.               Provinces in North
 and Northeast China and a larger or smaller area in
 certain other provinces will fall into this b category.

 areas the work of building semi-socialist 'cooperatiVeS

 These are for the most part border areas. not he et been
 some border areas where land reform  s o-operatives

 have been organized at all.  In such areas, ita,l is
 necessary to advance fairly slowly, or even wait

 the Communist Party committees in various urovseles,
 municipalities and autonomous regions
 establish-
 the areas where conditions are ripe to try ou
 ment of agricultural producers' co-operative) of an
 advanced (that is, entirely socialist) type.  In some
 areas where the work of building semi-socialist
 be
 operatives has been basically completed, plans may
 drawn up to transform co-operatives of an elementary
 type into co-operatives of an advanced type, bearing
 in mind the need for increased production, the degree
 of the people's political consciousness
 ashould be
 nomic conditions.  Such a transformation
 carried out step by step-that is, by the trial establish-
 ment of a few co-operatives of an advanced type and
 a gradual, stage-by-stage increase in their number.
 In areas where many nationalities live together
 co-operatives may be formed either by people of a
 single nationality or of several different nationalities.
 In areas where livestock breeding is the only
 occupation of the people, experimental livestock breed-
 ing co-operatives may also be established if conditions
 permit.
 Plans for agricultural co-operation in the various
 areas should include such branches of the economy as
 forestry, livestock breeding, fishing, salt production
 and other occupations.  They should also include
 plans for supply and marketing co-operatives, credit
 co-operatives,  handicraft  producers'  co-operatives,
 transport co-operatives, and plans for cultural and
 educational work and for the growth of the Party and
 the people's organizations.
 In drawing up plans for agricultural co-operation,
 the Party committees at all levels, and first and fore-
 most the hsiang Party branches and county Party
 committees, should  simultaneously work out all-
 embracing, long-term production plans based on local
 conditions, all with the development of agriculture as
 their central aim.
 XI
 In planning agricultural co-operation, particular
 attention should be paid to the plans for hsiang and
 villages, because such plans are the foundation of the
 whole plan of agricultural co-operation.  Party com-
 mittees at all levels should give the tarty organizations
 of a number of selected hsiang or villages guidance in
 the preparation of comprehensive plans for stage-by-
 stage development in the light of local conditions. This
 will build up experience that helps to guide the whole

 movement.  Such plans should include the following
 measures :
 1.  The making of a concrete analysis of class
 relationships in the village and the way in which
 the mutual-aid and co-operative movement is being
 organized.
 2.  The  making  of  arrangements  for  the
 establishment or expansion of mutual-aid teams and
 agricultural producers' co-operatives stage by stage
 and group by group.  This should be done on a
 voluntary basis, taking into account the degree of un-
 derstanding of various strata of the peasantry, their
 social relations and where they live and work.
 3.  The making of suitable arrangements to train
 and supply key personnel for the establishment of
 mutual-aid teams and agricultural  producers' co-
 operatives, taking into account the interests of the
 whole movement for agricultural co-operation in the
 hsiang or village.
 These plans should be carefully studied by the
 cadres and active elements among the peasants; they
 should be repeatedly discussed with the mass of the
 people. Punning things by simply issuing orders must
 be avoided and necessary revisions made from time
 to time as the work goes ahead.
 XII
 The Party organizations of provinces (or autono-
 mous regions), administrative regions (or autonomous
 chou), counties (or autonomous counties), districts
 and hsianq (or nationality hsiang) should pay close
 attention to rural questions and energetically improve
 the quality of their leadership in rural work.  The
 leading responsible comrades of local Party committees
 at all levels should spare no pains in learning to be-
 come experts in agricultural co-operation.  In short,
 what is needed is initiative, not passivity; active
 leadership, not its relinquishment.
 Those in the leadership should base their work
 on the method of learning from the mass movement,
 familiarizing themselves with the actual situation,
 summing up  experience  and adopting a flexible
 approach in guiding the movement. Ignorance coupled
 with unwillingness to learn, the issuing of arbitrary
 orders and an irregular tempo of work-these are
 things which violate the principles on which the growth
 of the movement must be founded in actual practice.
 They represent subjectivism, not Marxism.  There can
 be no correct leadership unless such subjectivism is
 opposed.
 The leadership should respect and encourage
 initiative and creative ability among the masses; it
 should protect and foster these growing, developing
 forces.  To impede or discourage the growth of new
 things emerging in society, instead of helping them
 wholeheartedly, or to try and force their growth
 artificially, in a rash and impetuous way, before con-
 ditions are ripe, instead of taking appropriate measures
 to foster their natural birth and development-are
 both methods which injure the tender shoots of the
 new.  They are opportunist, not Marxist methods.
 There can be no leadership unless such opportunism
 is opposed.
 The aim of the co-operative movement is to lead
 about 110 million peasant household, from individual
 farming to collective farming and then go on to bring
 about technical reform in agriculture; it is to eliminate
 the last vestiges of capitalist exploitation in the rural
 areas and establish socialism.  This is a tremendous
 change affecting the livelihood of several hundred

 million people, and it is inconceivable that difficulties
 should not crop up.  Opportunists and subjectivists
 lose the ability to exercise sober judgement and over-
 come the difficulties with which they are confronted,
 either because they do not realize that they need to
 rely on the masses and the Party, or because they
 have no confidence in them.  However, ours is a well-
 tempered, well-steeled Party, a Marxist-Leninist Party
 closely linked with the people.  Throughout the thirty
 years and more of its existence, our Party has weath-
 ered many storms in the revolution and faced many
 serious difficulties.  But its close unity with the
 masses enabled it to overcome such difficulties one by
 one and lead the people's revolution to victory.  The
 building of socialism is the cause of hundreds of
 millions of people.    In the industrialization of our
 country, in the building up of agricultural co-opera-
 tion and in every other aspect of our work, we should
 give full play to the creativeness and initiative of the
 masses, work in a realistic spirit and shun complacency
 and impetuosity.  It is the conviction of the Sixth
 Plenary Session that if we do this we shall overcome
 all difficulties and go on to new and greater victories.
 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT
 DECISIONS ON AGRICULTURAL
 CO-OPERATION
 (A Speech Delivered on October 4, 1955 at the Sixth Plenary
 Session of the Seventh Central Committee of
 the Communist Party of China)
 Chen Po-ta
 Comrade Mao Tse-Lung's report on agricultural
 co-operation, delivered on July 31, 1955 at the meet-
 ing                                                                                   of  secretaries of provincial,  municipal  and
 autonomous region committees convened by the Cen-
 tral Committee of the Communist Party of China,
 summed up many years' experience of the agricultural
 co-operative movement in our country.  It pointedly
 criticized the main ideological errors-Rightist errors
 -now existing in our Party on the question of ex-
 panding agricultural co-operation, and gave policy
 directives on a series of questions, such as the neces-
 sity and possibility of agricultural co-operation, the
 practical way forward and the steps to be taken, and
 the way to lead agricultural co-operation.  These
 directives of Comrade Mao Tse-tung have enabled all
 our Party comrades to prepare themselves ideologically
 and organizationally for the coming upsurge in the
 socialist mass movement in the countryside, and to
 avoid serious mistakes at this vital turning point in
 history.
 On the basis of Comrade Mao Tse-tung's report,
 the Political Bureau of the Central Committee has

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 prepared draft Decisions on Agricultural Co-operation
 which are now submitted to this plenary session.  As
 I am in charge of part of the work in the Rural WTork
 Department of the Central Committee, the Political
 Bureau has appointed me to give explanations of the
 draft Decisions.
 I wish to draw attention to the following points:
 THE POLICY OF EXPANDING AGRICULTURAL
 CO-OPERATION
 (1)  The draft Decisions point out that the
 nature of the peasant question is different in each
 of the two stages of the revolution.  Our Party must
 adapt its policy in the rural areas to a new turn in
 the revolution and to new changes in class relations
 and in the forms of class struggle in the rural areas
 since the land reform.  Rightist mistakes made by
 some comrades arise precisely from their failure to
 see this new situation and the new changes.
 As you all know, our Party's general line in the
 period of transition has three parts : socialist in-
 clustrialization, socialist transformation of agriculture
 and  handicrafts,  and  socialist  transformation  of
 capitalist industry and commerce.  These parts can-
 not be separated one from the other, because the work
 of socialist construction and socialist transformation
 covers the whole national  economy.  A      socialist
 economy must include the two main branches of pro-
 duction-industry and agriculture.                                       As Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung pointed out in his report, socialist industrial-
 ization is not something that can be carried out in
 isolation, separate from agricultural co-operation ; our
 36
 country must, therefore, adopt the policy of keeping
 agricultural co-operation in step with socialist in-
 dustrialization. We cannot stand with one foot planted
 on socialist industry and the other on a small-peasant
 economy.  The victory of socialism is unthinkable un-
 less we win over the five hundred million strong rural
 population to take part in socialist construction. There
 is a rising tide of socialist industrial construction; and
 in view of this, it is highly significant that Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung has in good time put the expansion of
 agricultural co-operation as an important item on the
 agenda of work for the whole Party.
 (2)  Our Party led the bourgeois-democratic
 revolution for almost thirty long years.  The work of
 every comrade in the Party centred round the struggle
 for victory in this revolution.  It is quite natural,
 therefore, that some comrades are not mentally pre-
 pared for the transition from this stage of the
 revolution to the stage of socialist revolution.  But
 our Party has Comrade Mao Tse-tung at its head and
 is armed with Marxism-Leninism; even when it was
 working to overthrow the system of land ownership by
 feudal landlords, it was preparing to lead the peas-
 ants on from the point where the land was returned
 to the tillers to socialist co-operation.  Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung in his report recalled the history of the
 agricultural co-operative movement in our country;
 this is also the history of the gradual putting into
 practice of the policy of our Party on agricultural co-
 operation.
 It would be as well for us to review Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung's exposition of this Party policy in his works
 written in various periods.  As you all know, as early
 as the time of the First Revolutionary Civil War
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung, in his Report of an Investiga-
 tion into the Peasant Movement in Hunan, described
 37
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 the co-operative movement as an important part of
 the peasant movement, though, in view of   t al
 conditions at that time, mention was made only
 supply and marketing co-operatives and credit co-
 operatives.
 During the Second Revolutionary Civil War,
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung, drawing on the experience of
 mutual-aid working groups and ploughing teams
 created by the masses in the revolutionary bases,
 pointed out the great role played in agricultural pro-
 duction by this kind of mutual aid in labour (that is,
 co-operative organizations for agricultural produc-
 tion) .  (See Comrade Mao Tse-tung's Survey of
 Chaff gkang Hsiang.)
 During the War  of Resistance to Japanese
 Aggression, Comrade Mao Tse-tung gave two famous
 speeches, On Co-operation and Let Us Get Organized,
 in which he called on the people in all the anti-
 Japanese bases to organize this rudimentary form of
 mutual-aid production group in large numbers on a
 voluntary mass basis.  Later, in other works (such
 as On Coalition Government), Comrade Mao Tse-tung
 continued to draw attention to this question.  At the
 Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Com-
 mittee of the Party in 1949, speaking of economic
 construction after the liberation of the country, Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung said:
 If we have only a state sector in the national
 economy and no co-operative sector, it is impos-
 sible to lead the individual economy of the
 labouring people gradually on to the road of col-
 lectivization ; we cannot consolidate the pro-
 letariat's leadership in the political power of the
 state.  Anyone who ignores or underestimates
 this point will be making a grave mistake.
 38
 After the founding of the People's Republic of
 China, the Central Committee of our Party, on the
 basis of Comrade Mao Tse-tung's views, passed the
 "Decisions  on  Mutual Aid  and . Co-operation  in
 Agricultural Production" in December 1951, and the
 "Decisions on the Development of Agricultural Pro-
 ducers' Co-operatives" in December 1953.  All this
 shows that the Party has consistently adhered to the
 policy of agricultural co-operation; this is not some-
 thing put forward all of a sudden.  Some of our com-
 rades are somewhat taken aback by this policy because
 they have not had time to study the question seriously.
 The main reason for this is that many of our comrades
 joined the Party during the bourgeois-democratic
 revolution against imperialism and feudalism, and
 are acquainted, in their day-today practical work,
 only with the programme of that revolution (that is,
 our Party's minimum programme) but are not yet
 familiar with the Party's programme relating to
 socialist revolution (that is, our Party's maximum
 programme) .  That is why, as with many other im-
 portant new questions, we must take up the question
 of agricultural co-operation again and devote serious
 study to it; and in the course of our study we must
 realize what our mistakes are and correct them, so
 as to correctly grasp our Party's principles and policy,
 and raise our knowledge of Marxism-Leninism to a
 higher level.  That is the task confronting all Party
 comrades.
 (3)  The draft Decisions criticize the illusions
 harboured by certain comrades who are quite content
 with things as they are in the countryside, and with
 the small-peasant economy.  The Party must criticize
 such mistaken ideas.  At the Third Conference on
 Mutual Aid and Co-operative Work called by the Cen-
 39

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 tral Committee in  October 1953,  Comrade  Mao
 Tse-tung had this to say :
 If positions in the countryside are not held
 by socialism, capitalism will assuredly occupy
 them.  How then can we say that we will take
 neither the socialist nor the capitalist road?
 It is an invariable law that, once the feudal land
 system is overthrown, a struggle begins in rural areas
 in which the choice lies between the capitalist and
 the socialist roads.  It is either the one or the other:
 there is no middle course.  Some comrades took quite
 a  radical  stand  in  their  attitude  towards the
 bourgeois-democratic revolution, but once they pass
 through that stage of the revolution, they remain quite
 content with the peasants' having got back their land.
 So they loiter at the crossroads; between socialism and
 capitalism, and are actually more interested in pre-
 serving tl~e small-peasant economy than in giving a
 lead in its transformation to a socialist agriculture.
 Such comrades fail to realize that a small-peasant
 economy is not a paradise for the peasantry, but a
 garci .n in which capitalism grows.   i ,  the China LocOnl~ Tnve

 classes were formed in the period between 1951 and
 1954 which gave training to 18,847 workers for various
 sports activities.
 .   As sports activities spread, more facilities and
 grounds have been provided for the workers in fac-
 tories and mines.  The number of basket-ball and
 volley-ball courts, football pitches, tracks and grounds
 for athletic activities run by the primary trade union
 organizations in the three municipalities (Shenyang,
 Fushun, and Harbin) increased from 1,237 in 1954 to
 2,054 in 1955, and the equipment provided, such as
 horizontal bars, parallel bars, box horses and weights
 for weight-lifting, increased from 2,571 pieces to 3,101.
 It was decided at the First National Workers' Sports
 Conference held in November 1954 that 10 to 15 per
 cent of trade union funds should be appropriated for
 the use of athletic activities.
 In order to encourage the workers to go in for
 sports and to improve athletic standards, many track
 and field meetings and ball games have been held.
 Partial data of five municipalities-Peking, Shanghai,
 Harbin, Fushun and Taiyuan-and of the China
 Locomotive  Sports Association showed that 6,881
 athletic meetings were held from 1951 to August 1955,
 attended by more than 940,000 athletes.  The First
 National Workers' Sports Meeting which took place
 in Peking in October 1955 enabled a review to be made
 of the achievemeiit~ of the workers in the field of
 physical culture.  Over 1,700 men and women athletes
 took part.  In the forty-seven track and field events,
 cycle races an(1 weight-lifting contest, eight national
 records were broken by ten me11 and women workers,

 pie's  Physique" the trade union organizations at
 various levels have, since liberation, done a lot to
 popularize physical culture among the workers and
 staff members. Remarkable results have been achieved
 in improving the health of workers, ,which has led
 to a decrease in sickness, ensured a regular attendance
 at work and raised labour productivity.  During 1954,
 more than 838,000 workers in China regularly took
 part in basket-ball, volley-ball and football matches and
 more than 82,700 teams were organized. The majority
 of workers and staff in various industrial and mining
 enterprises are enthusiasts for morning exercises
 directed by music from the radio and many sports
 teams and training groups have been formed to carry
 on regular physical training.
 The basic organization to lead sports activities is
 the sports association, which is a voluntary body of
 amateur athletes.  In 1951, the China Locomotive
 Athletic Association, the first trade union national
 . sports association, was organized by the railway work-
 ers.                         In 1/54, after the convening of the First Na-
 tional Workers' Sports Cdnf erence, there was a further
 increase in the number of sports associations.  At the
 end of 1955, there were 11 national, 61 provincial and
 municipal and 181 local athletic associations in addi-
 tion to many athletic committees and groups.
 A great number of workers have been trained by
 the trade union organizations during the last six years
 to take on coaching, training and other sports work in
 their spare time.  According to partial figures for the
 eight municipalities of Peking, Shanghai, Tientsin,
 Canton, Wuhan, Shenyang, Harbin and Fushun, 53
 32
 classes were formed in the period between 1951 and
 1954 which gave training to 18,847 workers for various
 sports activities.
 .   As sports activities spread, more facilities and
 grounds have been provided for the workers in fac-
 tories and mines.  The number of basket-ball and
 volley-ball courts, football pitches, tracks and grounds
 for athletic activities run by the primary trade union
 organizations in the three municipalities (Shenyang,
 Fushun, and Harbin) increased from 1,237 in 1954 to
 2,054 in 1955, and the equipment provided, such as
 horizontal bars, parallel bars, box horses and weights
 for weight-lifting, increased from 2,571 pieces to 3,101.
 It was decided at the First National Workers' Sports
 Conference held in November 1954 that 10 to 15 per
 cent of trade union funds should be appropriated for
 the use of athletic activities.
 In order to encourage the workers to go in for
 sports and to improve athletic standards, many track
 and field meetings and ball games have been held.
 Partial data of five municipalities-Peking, Shanghai,
 Harbin, Fushun and Taiyuan-and of the China
 Locomotive Sports Association showed that 6,881
 athletic meetings were held from 1951 to August 1955,
 attended by more than 940,000 athletes.  The First
 National Workers' Sports Meeting which took place
 in Peking in October 1955 enabled a review to be made
 of the achievements of the workers in the field of
 physical culture.  Over 1,700 men and women athletes
 took part.  In the forty-seven track and field events,
 cycle races and weight-lifting contest, eight national
 records were broken by ten men and women workers,

 4.  Production Work
 In a people's democratic state led by the working
 class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, the
 ultimate aim of developing production is to satisfy the
 ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the
 people.  Therefore, to develop production is in the
 greatest interest of the liberated Chinese people. The
 most important task of the trade union organizations
 is to unite and lead all the workers to struggle con-
 scientiously and enthusiastically for greater and great-
 er output.
 One of the main methods used by the trade union
 organizations to improve production is to lead and
 encourage the mass of the workers to take part in
 socialist emulation  campaigns.  In  1950,  683,000
 workers took part in these emulation campaigns; the
 figure went up to 2,380,000 in 1951; from 1952 on-
 wards, over 80 per cent of all workers and staff in the
 country's factories and mines were taking part.
 _i  the socialist emulation drive, we put into prac-
 ('ice                   ie principle of constantly improving technique
 auii learning and mastering new techniques; we give
 full play to the collective wisdom of the workers, and
 we rely on their enthusiasm to put forward rational-
 ization proposals.  The proposers are given material
 reward. The workers are encouraged to learn seriously
 Soviet advanced experiences as well as to popularize
 their own successes.
 34
 From 1950 to 1953, 1,643,708 rationalization pro-
 posals were put forward by workers and staff mem-
 bers.                                                                                        In 1954, when the All-China Federation of
 Trade Unions put forward the call to "Further De-
 velop the Labour Emulation   Drive"  not only did the
 number of proposals increase, but they were generally
 much more valuable.  In 1954, over 848,000 rational-
 ization proposals were made and it was estimated that
 the realization of 102,966 alone increased the wealth
 of the country by 174,310,000 Yuan.
 In August 1954 on the proposal of the All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions, the Government Ad-
 ministration Council promulgated the "Provisional
 Regulations on Awards for Inventions, Technical Im-
 provements and Rationalization Proposals Concerning
 Production."  This policy has greatly enhanced the
 workers' enthusiasm.
 The Soviet advanced experiences and the ad-
 vanced experiences of our own workers have been
 widely popularized in the industrial and mining en-
 terprises  throughout  the  country.  According  to
 available data for 1952-1954, 102 important advanced
 methods were adopted in heavy industry, and as a
 result the output of steel was increased by 60 per cent
 and the total value of output of iron was increased
 by one third.
 As the socialist emulation drive has extended and
 deepened, a great number of model workers and dis-
 tinguished workers have been brought forward on the
 production front.  From 1949 to 1953, more than 230,-
 600 model workers were elected from the primary
 trade union organizations throughout China. In 1954,
 35

 15:1,9()0 iliodel workers and distinguished workers and
 220,400 advanced workers were elected from the pri-
 mary trade union organizations in the factories and
 mines.  In the first halt of 1955, among the highway
 transport workers in 33 provinces and municipalities,
 there was, on the average, one model worker or ad-
 vanced worker out of every fifteen workers.  Many of
 the model workers and advanced workers were en-
 gineering technicians.  Among the eighty-seven model
 workers elected from the power industry in 1955, en-
 gineering technicians constituted more than 19 per

 the workers are going about their jobs with great en-
 thusiasm for the realization of their pledge to fulfil
 the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.  In
 the Tientsin Bicycle Factory, after the workers had
 taken a pledge to fulfil the Five-Year Plan ahead of
 schedule they put forward over eighty technical pro-
 posals.  The workers and staff in the Harbin Flax
 Mill, where the 1955 production targets were fulfilled
 more than one month ahead, set themselves the task
 of reaching the production levels of 1957 one year
 and twenty-three work-days ahead of time.
 5.  Wages
 As mentioned above, the aim of developing pro-
 duction of our country is to satisfy the ever-increasing
 material and cultural needs of the people.  It is the
 highest aim of the people's government and the Com-
 munist Party of China to bring about a happy life
 for the people.  The wages system of our country also
 serves this general aim.
 Wages are the main income of workers and staff.
 They have a direct bearing on their personal interests.
 As the conditions of the wages system will also in-
 fluence directly the development of production, trade
 union organizations have always paid close attention
 to the question of wages, treating it as an important
 part of their work.
 Socialist state-owned enterprises handle their
 wages problems according to the following two prin-
 ciples:
 37
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 First, to raise the material and cultural standaris
 of workers and staff on the basis of developing pro-
 duction, and at the same time the rate of increase in
 labour productivity must exceed the rate of increase
 in wages.
 Second, the state pays wages in a planned way
 according to the principle of "to each according to his
 work."  Hence, higher wages are paid to those en-
 gaged in skilled or heavy work.  Wages are higher
 in the important departments and enterprises iii the
 national economy.  Workers who turn out the same
 amount of products of the same quality in the same
 length of time receive same wages irrespective of na-
 tionality, race or sex.
 The wages of workers in the old China were a
 mere pittance.  Equal work did not receive equal pay.
 Auld usually the wages received did not bear relation
 to their contributions.  And, what's more, there was
 ruthless feudal exploitation.  Workers lived like pau-
 pers without enough food and  clothing  all(1  were
 always threatened by unemploynlent.  For instance,
 miners of the Kailan Mining Administration earned
 only 20 cents (pre-liberation currency) a clay with
 16 hours' work.  And if they should die at work the
 owner of the mine gave only 20 dollars to their families.
 If a horse died, it was GO dollars' loss.  So, before
 liberation, the life of a worker was worse than that
 of beasts.
 Since the establishment of the People's Republic
 of China, from 1950 onwards, trade union orgalliza-
 tions have helped the government and the manage-
 ments of enterprises in readjusting and reforming the
 38
 wages system. Trade union organizations at all levels
 took part in drawing up schemes for adjusting the
 wages of workers and staff, carried out propaganda
 and explanation work among them, and organized them
 to discuss and decide the wages scale, thus drawing
 the broad masses of workers and staff into the work of
 reforming the wages system.  Owing to the correct
 wages policy of the people's government and the Com-
 munist Party of China and the active help of trade
 union organizations, the wages reform gained the sup-
 port of all workers and staff.                                                                                          The corrupt, chaotic,
 irrational and multi-grade wages system left over from
 the reactionary Kuomintang regime was completely
 changed.  A new wages system was introduced and
 the principle of "to each according to his work" was
 gradually put into practice. At present there are
 eight grades of wages for workers of state-owned en-
 terprises.                                                                                                 A different standard of wages is provided
 for each grade.  There are also extra pay and allow-
 ances.
 In the last few years the trade union organiza-
 tions have helped the managements of enterprises to
 replace the old piece-work wage system with a new
 one and enforce the merit system.  The old piece-work
 wage system was used by the capitalists before libera-
 tion to raise the intensity of labour, to lengthen work-
 ing time and to exploit the workers more.  They made
 use of this system to undermine the unity of the work-
 ing class and force the workers to work like slaves
 for wages which were hardly enough to keep them
 alive.
 39

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Our piece-work wage system has been set up by
 taking into account the introduction of new technique
 and the replacement of manual labour with machinery.
 Besides, piece-work wages are fixed for various kinds
 of products.  Every piece of extra work is counted.
 Therefore more work means more pay.  Trade union
 organizations also do what they can to help the man-
 agements of enterprises to take measures to raise the
 cultural and technical level of the workers and to help
 the workers to fulfil or overf ulfil their quotas.
 According to the statistics of the seven industrial
 ministries for September 1955, wages paid on piece-
 work rate already exceeded 40 per cent of the total
 wages paid out in all enterprises under these minis-
 tries.
 Besides, all enterprises have set up various merit
 systems : there is the system of rewards for saving
 coal on the railways and there is the system of re-
 wards for safety in operation in departments of power
 industries.  On the basis of the suggestions of the
 trade unions, the Government Administration Council
 promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Awards
 for Inventions, Technical Improvements and Ration-
 alization Proposals Concerning Production" which
 enabled some 135,600 workers and staff to receive
 material rewards in 1954.
 With the participation of the trade unions, the
 government and managements of enterprises made pro-
 visions of wages, allowances and subsidies for those
 working under exceptional conditions : women work-
 ers who have to take time off breast-feeding their
 babies during working hours receive full pay; workers
 40
 who work in conditions harmful to the health get
 health allowances ; workers who work in remote places
 also receive special allowances; when the production
 of enterprises is suspended either because of natural
 conditions or because of management problems, work-
 ers also get allowances.  When a worker is transferred
 he gets travelling expenses and allowances for moving
 or making arrangements for the family.
 With the development of production the real wages
 of workers and staff have been steadily rising over
 the years.  According to the statistics of five industrial
 ministries, the average money wages of workers and
 staff in 1952 was 66.20 per cent higher than in 1950.
 During the period of the First Five-Year Plan the
 average money wages of workers and staff in the whole
 country will increase by 33 per cent.  According to
 the plan, the average wages of the workers and staff
 in 1955 would be 20.5 per cent higher as compared
 with 1952.
 With the development of the national economy,
 4,220,000 more workers and staff are needed in the
 period of the First Five-Year Plan.  So more people
 will be employed.
 In addition to gradually raising the wages and
 the number of employed persons, the state has made
 vigorous efforts to stabilize commodity prices, or-
 ganize various welfare facilities, extend the scope of
 labour insurance, expand the health and medical ser-
 vices, increase funds for cultural and educational
 work, in order to constantly better the cultural and
 material life of the workers and staff.  Consequently

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 the life of our workers and staff has improved a great
 deal since liberation.
 6.  Labour Protection
 In China, labour protection is a fundamental
 policy of the state manifesting its concern to see that
 the workers and staff members work under healthy
 conditions and are provided with safety measures. As
 mass organizations of the working class, China's trade
 unions also pay full attention to this work. The Trade
 Union Law of the People's Republic of China provides
 that it is the duty of trade unions to ensure that the
 managements or employers effectively carry out the
 regulations and directives concerning labour protec-
 tion and the standards and regulations concerning
 safety devices and factory sanitation,
 The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has
 set up a Labour Protection Department which gives
 directions to the trade union organizations at different
 levels on how to improve labour protection ; it also
 investigates and studies the safety and health condi-
 tions in various enterprises, submits proposals for
 labour laws and helps to popularize knowledge of
 safety devices and industrial health.  The principal in-
 dustrial unions and the principal provincial and munic-
 ipal trade union organizations have also set up sec-
 tions concerned with labour protection work. Primary
 trade union organizations have committees to look
 after labour protection, and groups of workers elect
 one of their number to act as labour protection in-
 42
 spector,  By 1955, 1,630 primary trade union organ-
 izations had set up labour protection committees and
 50,303 groups had labour protection inspectors.
 During the period of the rehabilitation of the
 national economy immediately after the liberation, the
 trade unions led the workers to make an extensive in-
 vestigation of safety and sanitary conditions. A great
 many defects and shortcomings were corrected in the
 various establishments throughout the country, and
 the extremely dangerous and bad working conditions
 began to disappear.
 Since 1953 the key problems concerned with im-
 proving safety devices and health facilities, such as
 ventilation, cooling, control of dust and poisonous
 fumes, electricity safeguards, etc, are being tackled
 in the various industrial enterprises. In many textile
 mills, iron and steel works and machine-tool factories,
 the previous high temperatures have been gradually
 reduced and machinery has been installed to lighten
 labour.  In the state-owned collieries, over forty-five
 per cent of coal is cut by combines, mechanical coal-
 cutters or pneumatic picks and the rest by electric or
 pneumatic drills or blasting with explosives; more
 than 80 per cent of traction on the working face and
 the underground haulage roadways is mechanized.
 In 1954 the Ministry of Labour laid it down that
 industrial enterprises, in drawing up their annual
 financial plans, should work out industrial safety mea-
 sures for labour protection and allocate a specific sum
 for the improvement of working conditions in the
 enterprises.  The trade unions signed agreements with
 the managements to enable them to supervise and en-
 43

 sure the enforcement of these measures and to see that
 the working conditions were systematically improved.
 The trade unions co-operate with the manage-
 ments in educating the workers on safety questions
 and instructing them on the working of safety devices
 and safe methods of work.  In many industrial cities,
 the government and the trade unions have jointly ar-
 ranged lectures on industrial safety and health a to
 held exhibitions of labour f rotection.  With a view
 studying and popularizing advanced experience
 Trade
 labour protection, the All-China Federation of T
 Unions has opened permanent exhibitions.
 In connection with the plans for improving work-
 ing conditions, the trade unions pay particular atten-
 tion to the training of specialized personnel fh labour
 e
 of
 protection.  The  All-China  Federation
 Unions, as well as the industrial ministries, industrial
 unions and the provincial and city governments, has
 setup training classes on this subject.  Up to the end
 of 1954 about a thousand persons had received train-
 ing.  In 1955, 4,726 persons were trained in 26 classes
 established by the provincial and city authorities and
 industrial unions.
 . Thanks to the effort made by the trade unions,
 managements, governmental bodies and the workers
 themselves, working conditions in the enterprises
 . throughout  the country  have  steadily  improved.
 Casualty figures in industry for 1953 were 5.8 per
 cent lower than 1952 and for the period between
 January and September 154, there was a further de-
 crease of 1.7 per cent over the corresponding period of
 1953.

 Before liberation the Chinese workers generally
 worked twelve hours a day and some as long as 16-18
 hours, seven days a week.  Since liberation the law
 protects the working people's right to rest.  Now vir-
 tually all enterprises are operating an eight-hour day,
 and in branches particularly injurious to the workers'
 health, a six-hour day is enforced.  Women workers
 are given special consideration.  "Equal pay for equal
 work" is provided by law.      Expectant mothers are
 given light work.  They are entitled to 56 days'
 maternity leave with full pay.  Larger enterprises
 have set up creches, and in workshops where there are
 many women workers, special hygiene rooms are set
 aside for women.  There is no longer any child labour
 in state-owned factories and mines.
 7.  Labour Insurance
 Labour insurance forms part of the government's
 labour policy that expresses the state's concern for
 the welfare of the working people.  It is one of the
 measures the state has adopted to improve the mate-
 rial and cultural life of the workers and to develop
 the productive forces.
 In the old China, there was no such thing as labour
 insurance for the workers, and they had to manage
 as best they could in times of childbirth, old age,
 sickness, death, injury and disability.  Many women
 workers dared not marry for fear they might have a
 child and be dismissed.

 Since liberation the government has paid great
 attention to labour insurance work.  But as early as
 December 27, 1948, Northeast China, which already
 had been liberated, had its Provisional War-time
 Labour Insurance Regulations for State-owned Enter-
 prises. After the nation-wide liberation, the people's
 government promulgated in February 1951 the Labour
 Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of
 China.  Since then the labour insurance programme
 has been put into effect on a national scale and en-
 forced in such enterprises as railways, water transport,
 posts and telecommunications and factories and mines
 employing 100 or more workers.  In enterprises with
 less than 100 workers, labour insurance may be nego-
 tiated between the management and the trade union
 representing the workers. Amendments to the Labour
 Insurance Regulations were made on January 2, 1953,
 which extended its scope and increased the benefits.
 September 20, 1954 witnessed the birth of the
 Constitution of the People's Republic of China. This
 Constitution reinforces the Labour Insurance Regula-
 tions.                           Article  93  of  the  Constitution  provides:
 "Working people in the People's Republic of China
 have the right to material assistance in old age, and
 in case of illness or disability.  To guarantee enjoy-
 ment of this right, the state provides social insurance,
 social  assistance and public health services and
 gradually expands these facilities."
 The rise in the living standard of our workers is
 not only shown by increases in their actual money
 wages.  For one thing, 12 per cent of the total pay-
 46
 roll of the enterprise is appropriated for labour in-
 surance benefits.
 Every year more and more people become eligible
 for labour insurance benefits.  From 600,000 in 1949
 the number increased to 5,550,000 by the first half of
 1955, an increase of 9 times in the space of 6 years.
 Our Labour Insurance Regulations apply to all
 workers and staff members without exception who are
 employed in enterprises covered by these Regulations,
 regardless of their race, nationality, age or sex.  The
 Regulations provide that all the labour insurance ex-
 penses should be borne by the managements or own-
 ers of the enterprises.  The workers and staff mem-
 bers do not pay any contributions whatsoever.
 The whole administration of the labour insurance
 programme is handled by the trade unions, which have
 established organizations at all levels in which the
 workers themselves are drawn into the administration.
 The Labour Insurance Department and the Collective
 Labour Insurance Administration Bureau of the All-
 China Federation of Trade Unions direct labour in-
 surance work nationally and give guidance for the
 operation of such communal labour insurance establish-
 ments as sanatoria and rest homes throughout the
 country.  In the municipal and provincial trade union
 organizations and industrial union organizations there
 are special departments and personnel to take charge
 of labour insurance work.  Trade union committees in
 factories and mines, as a rule, have set up committees
 or appointed representatives to do the actual labour
 insurance work-they pay out the labour insurance

 benefits and also organize mass campaigns for pre-
 venting and reducing sickness and injury.
 Our labour insurance benefits cover illness, injury,
 death, maternity benefits and old-age pensions.
 A worker who falls sick or is injured outside his
 work can be treated free at the medical institutions
 of the enterprise where he is employed.  During treat-
 ment, for a period of up to six months he receives a
 sick benefit of between 60 to 100 per cent of his wages,
 depending on the length of time he has been employed
 in the enterprise.  In the case of medical treatment
 exceeding six months the allowancepaid is esganataria
 to 40-60 per cent of his wages.  Priority in
 or rest homes is accorded to convalescents or those
 who are constitutionally weak.
 In the case of injury sustained at work, the total
 cost of treatment, medicines, hospitalization, meals at
 the hospital and travelling expenses involved is borne
 by the management or owner of the enterprise. Wages
 must be paid as usual throughout the period of treat-
 ment.  If the worker becomes disabled, he is paid
 according to the degree of disablement, an invalid bene-
 fit equivalent to 60-75 per cent of his wages until such
 time as he regains his ability to work or until his
 death. If he is partially disabled but is still able to
 work, he gets, apart from his wages, a monthly invalid
 allowance equivalent to 10-30 per cent of his previous
 wages.
 \Women workers are entitled to a total of 56 days'
 maternity leave with full wages.  In the case of a
 difficult delivery or the birth of twins, the mother is
 entitled to an extra 14 days also with full wages. Ex-
 48
 penses for pre-natal examinations and child delivery
 are borne by the enterprise.  In the case of childbirth,
 a woman worker or the wife of a male worker receives
 a small maternity benefit which is increased in the
 event of twins, triplets, etc.
 Male workers upon attaining the age of 60 who
 have worked for 25 years, including 5 years in their
 present post, and women workers on reaching the age
 of 50 who have worked for 20 years, with 5 years in
 their present post, may retire with a monthly old-age
 pension of 50-70 per cent of their wages.  Retired
 workers are still entitled to medical treatment at the
 clinic or hospital of the enterprise where they used to
 work.  Workers who are eligible to retire but continue
 to work receive, in addition to their normal wages,
 an allowance equal to 10-20 per cent of their wages
 according to the length of time they have worked in
 the enterprise. By the end of June 1955, there were
 37,000 workers enjoying old-age pensions.  The state
 has also established homes for the aged workers who
 have no family of their own.  All the expenses for
 such establishments are borne by the state.  There
 are at present 15 such homes in the country for the
 aged and permanently disabled.
 In the case of the death of a worker, his family
 dependents receive considerable material assistance
 from the state.  When a worker or retired worker
 dies from sickness or injury not sustained at work,
 his immediate dependents receive a funeral benefit
 equivalent to two months' average wages.  In addi-
 tion, they receive a relief benefit equivalent to 6-12
 months' wages according to the number of his depen-
 49

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 dents.  Greater material assistance is given to the
 family dependents of a worker who dies while at work
 or after retirement in consequence of disablement re-
 sulting from injury sustained at work. To begin with,
 the family dependents receive a funeral benefit equiv-
 alent to 3 months' average wages.  In addition, they
 are allowed a monthly pension ranging from 25 to 50
 per cent of the deceased's previous wages according to
 the number of the dependents.  The pension is paid
 until such time as the dependents no longer have the
 status of dependents.  A funeral allowance of one-
 third to one half of the average monthly wage is also
 paid in the case of the death of a family dependent of
 a worker.
 The number of sanatoria and rest homes establish-
 ed by trade unions with labour insurance funds has
 been increasing from year to year.  By the end of
 June 1955, there were 126 such establishments in the
 country with 15,930 beds.  In addition, primary trade
 unions in factories and mines have set up 1,500 sana-
 toria (including sanatoria where the workers go in
 their spare time) with 38,000 beds. A total of 335,-
 000 workers had used these sanatoria and rest homes
 by the end of June 1955.
 8.  Women Workers
 The trade unions of China have always paid great
 attention to the problems of women workers.  In the
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions as well as local
 trade unions of all levels and the industrial unions,
 50
 women's departments have been set up.  Where there
 are women members, the primary trade union organi-
 zations have formed committees or made a com-
 mittee member responsible for dealing with the
 special problems of women workers.     The duties
 of the committee or committee member are ; to
 carry through, in co-ordination with the various de-
 partments of the trade union concerned, the policies
 and decrees of the Party and the government concern-
 ing the protection of women and children ; to show
 women that their emancipation can only be gained
 through their own efforts; and to keep in close contact
 with the women workers in order to know and reflect
 their needs and to help them solve their personal dif-
 ficulties.
 Before liberation, Chinese women workers had no
 rights whatsoever, politically, socially or in any other
 respect. In many cases they did the same kind and
 amount of work as men but were paid only half or
 two-thirds as much.  They also found it very difficult
 to find a job, and were liable to be dismissed due to
 pregnancy or childbirth.
 Since the founding of the People's Republic of
 China, the rapid rehabilitation and development of
 the national economy has afforded tremendous oppor-
 tunities to women to obtain employment.  In the first
 half of 1955 there were already two million women
 workers in the country.  "Equal pay for equal work"
 is guaranteed by law.    Many women workers have
 been promoted to managerial positions.  In 1953,
 1,569 women workers were promoted to responsible
 posts in various enterprises; and in 1954, 2,397 were
 51
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 promoted to administrative or technical positions.  By
 the end of 1954, more than 32,400 women workers
 had been promoted to leading or responsible jobs dur-
 ing the five years since liberation.
 Women workers of the new China are displaying
 great enthusiasm for work and a new creative spirit
 in the country's socialist construction.  Many ad-
 vanced workers have been developed.  According to
 a national survey in 1954, more than 11,600 women
 workers were elected byoprimary trade union organiza-
 tions as model workers and distinguished work-
 ers, and over 20,200 as advanced workers.
 Women workers have made an outstanding con-
 tribution in the construction of our country, and have
 brought about a change in the old scornful attitude
 to women's work.  Many women workers have been
 elected as people's deputies, including eighteen as rep-
 resentatives to the First National People's Congress.
 Under the Labour Insurance Regulations, women
 workers not only enjoy the same privileges as men,
 they are also entitled to certain special welfare bene-
 fits.                     Up to 1954, more than 2,200,000 women work-
 ers and wives of workers throughout the country had
 received maternity benefits.
 To protect the health of mothers and their babies,
 special canteens, rest rooms for expectant mothers
 and baby-feeding rooms have been set up in factories
 and enterprises and special buses provided to take
 expectant mothers and mothers with young babies
 to and from work.  By the first half of 1955, 901
 hygiene rooms had been set up in factories, mines
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 and enterprises throughout the country for women
 workers.
 Before liberation, illiteracy among women work-
 ers was very widespread, in some areas even reaching
 a hundred per cent.  Since liberation, women workers
 have been taking an active part in spare-time literacy
 classes in the factories. In the first quarter of 1955,
 over 470,200 women workers were studying in spare-
 time literacy classes throughout the country.  In addi-
 tion, a large number of women workers entered work-
 er-peasant short-term secondary schools and colleges.
 9.  Workers' Family Dependents
 Work among the workers' families is an important
 branch of our trade union work.  The organizing of
 the wives and families and uniting them around the
 trade union, and so helping to raise their political
 consciousness, goes a long way towards helping the
 workers in their work.
 Before liberation, the Chinese workers were re-
 garded as having no rights and the women members
 of their families particularly had to put up with all
 kinds of indignities.  As the workers only received
 very small wages while commodity prices rose several
 times a day, the workers' families were continually in
 great difficulties.
 With the liberation, the working class became the
 masters of the country, and with the growth in pro-
 duction, the workers' life improved considerably.
 Their real wages increased, and, in addition, the Labour
 53
 52
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Insurance Regulations promulgated in 1951 provided
 material assistance to them in the case of birth, old
 age, sickness, death, injury and disability.  The Reg-
 ulations also provide that members of workers'
 families also enjoy free medical treatment, and have
 to pay only a half of the cost of medicine.
 While the living standards of the workers' families
 improved, so their political status was raised and their
 cultural life improved.  The Constitution of the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China provides that women enjoy
 equal rights as men politically, economically, and in
 cultural and family life.  Three hundred and ninety
 members of coal miners' families in various parts of
 the country were elected as county, municipal and
 provincial people's deputies.  The wife of a lathe
 turner in Shenyang was elected as deputy to the Na-
 tional People's Congress.                          A large number of work-
 ers' wives attended spare-time schools organized in
 the areas in which they lived or in the enterprises
 where their husbands were employed.  The trade
 unions also helped them organize self-study groups.
 Up to the first half of 1955, 100,813 working-class
 housewives had taken part in literacy classes.
 The trade union clubs use various ways to at-
 tract the workers' families to take part in cultural
 activities.  For example, they organize lectures on
 political and current affairs and talks on the essentials
 of maternity hygiene, hold exhibitions and  dISCUSSio:~
 meetings, form reading and literacy groups and put
 on film-shows, etc.  After completing their studies,
 many housewives took up jobs.  For example, 2,960
 54
 working-class housewives were found jobs in Tientsin
 in 1951.
 To enable housewives to study and take up work,
 the trade union organizations have helped them to set
 up creches and nurseries of their own where their
 children can be looked after.  According to a survey
 made in 1954, there were 1,228 creches in various
 parts of the country run by workers' families, where
 more than 28,900 children were cared for.
 ? The housewives are not concerned only with im-
 proving their own lives, they also take part in work
 for the benefit of society.  Many have formed or-
 ganizations for improving, sanitary conditions.  As
 these improved, so the amount of sickness decreased
 considerably.  They also organize mutual-aid groups,
 which look after workers' wives or other relatives who
 are ill, so that the workers can go to work with an
 easy mind.  In the first half of 1955 there were 23,464
 such mutual-aid groups in the country with over 231,-
 400 members.
 10.  Finance Work
 According to  the Constitution  of the Trade
 Unions of the People's Republic of China trade union
 funds are derived from the following sources:  (1)
 Admission fees of new members.  A new member pays
 an admission fee equal to one per cent of his total
 wage of the month previous to his admission; (2)
 Membership dues.  Each member pays regularly one
 per cent of his monthly wage as membership dues;
 55

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 (3) Proceeds from cultural and sports activities spon-
 sorecl by the trade unions; (4) Allocations by the
 managements or owners of enterprises in accordance
 with the Trade Union Law, under which the manage-
 ment or the owner of an enterprise must allocate to
 the trade union two per cent of the total payroll every
 month.
 In the last few years, as a result of the develop-
 ment of national construction, there has been a con-
 tinuous expansion of the trade union membership and
 a rise in the level of wages, which means that the
 trade union funds have also increased.
 The income of the trade unions is used to serve
 the members and to improve production.  It is mainl~'
 used for the following purposes: (1) To pay for mass
 cultural work.  This includes expenses incurred in
 running spare-time schools for the workers, training
 trade union activists, sponsoring recreational and
 spare-time artistic activities, buying books, showing
 films and general propaganda work.  (2) To pay for
 sports activities.  This includes expenses incurred in
 the purchase of equipment and articles necessary for
 the workers and their children to carry on sports
 activities, in the holding of sports competitions, train-
 ing of sportsmen and propaganda work,  (3) As
 material assistance given to the members. This in-
 cludes  '.lowances to members who are in difficulty,
 subsidies allocated to the mutual-aid savings organiza-
 tions, nurseries and young pioneers' summer camps.
 (4) For trade union's administration, including  'ages
 for trade union officials, administrative expenses and
 expenses incurred in the organizational work of the
 56
 trade union (e.g. the holding of membership meet-
 ing, etc.)
 The administration costs take only a minimum of
 the trade union funds, the major part of which is
 used to enhance the cultural life of the members.  In
 1955 the administrative expenses of all trade unions
 in the country amounted to 30.2 per cent of the com-
 bined income and a continuous drive will be made to
 reduce this proportion in the future.
 11.  Living Conditions
 The Chinese workers' living conditions were ex-
 tremely poor before liberation.  Most of them lived in
 squalid sheds. In working-class districts there was
 no sanitation to speak of: the air was foul and there
 was neither piped water nor a sewerage system.
 Epidemics were frequent and the mortality rate was
 high.
 Since liberation the people's government has built
 large numbers of workers' houses.  In 1952 they built
 houses enough to accommodate one million families.
 In 1953 and  1954, houses with floor spaces of 12
 million and 13 million square metres were constructed
 respectively for the workers.  According to the First
 Five-rear Plan for. Development of the National.
 Economy, in the five-year period (1953-57), the govern-
 ment will build workers' houses with a total floor space
 of 46 million square metres.   Apart from the housing
 construction financed by the government, a lot has
 been done by trade union organizations to help im-
 57
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 prove the workers' living conditions.  For instance,
 they arranged for the workers to build their own
 houses with government loans.  In this way in 1955,
 houses were built for 15,954 railway workers' families,
 covering 417,984 square metres of floor space.
 Rents are now much lower than they were before.
 In pre-liberation days workers used to pay 30-50 per
 cent of their income in rent. In addition, they had to
 pay 3-12 months' rent on deposit.  Nowadays rents for
 government-financed houses take up only about 5 per
 cent of their wages.
 The people's government pays considerable atten-
 tion to the workers' ever-increasing demand for con-
 sumer goods.  After liberation it applied itself first
 of all to the stabilization of commodity prices.  Since
 1955, the government has carried out a planned supply
 of grain, edible oil and cotton cloth, with the result
 that speculation was rooted out, the stability of prices
 fully established and the livelihood of the whole body
 of working people safeguarded.
 Meanwhile the government has expanded the pro-
 duction of light industry and agriculture in due pro-
 portion to the development of heavy industry, so as
 to satisfy the workers' material needs which are
 growing with the steady increase in their wages.  In
 addition, the government has extended the network of
 department stores, retail shops or consumers'     co-
 operatives in factories and mines and the workers'
 residential areas.
 Before liberation there were hardly any canteens
 in the factories.  The workers had to take their meals
 in the open air or by the side of the machines. Things
 58
 are quite different today.  Every factory and mine
 has its own canteen or dining hall built and equipped
 at the expense of the management, who also subsidizes
 them.
 The wages of most workers before liberation were
 so low that they were hardly sufficient to provide the
 bare necessities of life.  Since liberation, however,
 their life has been improved enormously.  With a
 steady increase in production has come a steady rise
 in the workers' wages.  They not only live much bet-
 ter than before but are able to save out of their earn-
 ings.  The savings of the workers and staff members
 of the Shenhsin Textile Mill in Wusih, for example,
 amounted to 193,900 yuan in 1952, increasing to 514,-
 600 yuan in 1955.
 A small number of workers with little skill, with
 too many mouths to feed, or who have run into un-
 expected troubles, however, still have financial diffi-
 culties.  Allowances  are  made  to  these  workers
 according to their actual circumstances, from relief
 funds financed by 20 per cent of trade union member-
 ship dues, part of the labour insurance funds and 5
 per cent of the enterprise's premium funds.
 There are mutual-aid savings associations under
 the control of trade union organizations, from which
 workers can get interest-free loans.  By the end of
 1954, 28,000 primary trade union organizations had
 ?stablished their own savings associations.

 Comrades!  Our Motherland is now entering upon a new
 historic epoch and has entrusted us with a new historic task,
 the task of carrying out the industrialization of our country
 and the gradual transition to socialism.  Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung                                     "Without industry, it wcul.d not be possible
 g has s
 to have solid national defence welfare for the people and a
 strong and prosperous . country."
 The first and foremost need for the development of our
 country under present conditions is the rapid development of
 ~
 our industry and especially the building and development of
 our heavy industry.  The level of our present industrial out-
 put must be raised from year to year both in quantity and
 quality. Many factories will be renovated and expanded.
 At the same time we will build many new factories and new
 branches of industrial production.  Other economic and cul-
 tural enterprises must also be developed rapidly in conformity
 with the development of industry.
 Step by step we must turn our country into an industrial
 country with a high technical level. This great enterprise has
 already begun; work on several hundred construction projects
 is already, or will soon be started, and they will be carried
 on in the future on an ever expanding scale.  The fulfilment
 of this historic task will make our country and our people
 immensely rich and prosperous.  But such a task depends
 especially on the Chinese working class, who must make their
 efforts in a better organized way and on a higher level of
 political consciousness.
 For the purpose of carrying out this new historic task, we
 must exert the greatest efforts toward developing to the full
 the activity and creativeness of the broad masses of the work-
 and over-fulfilling the
 ing class, in the struggle for fulfilling               c
 economic plan of the country, and in the struggle for raising
 labour productivity, improving the quality of products, prac-
 tising strict economy and reducing cost of production.
 10
 In order to do this it is necessary to organize effectively
 labour emulation drives of the workers in a practical way, to
 bring to the fore and seriously study all new and advanced
 experiences  and  rationalization  proposals. We  should
 especially learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet
 Union> spread these advanced experiences and aPP1Y them in
 a practical way.  We must incessantly raise the technical and
 cultural levels of the workers. We must intensify the training
 of the ever-growing number of new workers, and help the old
 a
 workers treat the new workers in a proper and helpful
 manner.
 For this purpose we must strengthen communist educa-
 tion among the workers and raise their political conscious-
 ness, so that they may realize the identity of the interests
 of all the PeoPle of the state and of their own. At the same
 time we must adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism
 to overcome the defects and correct the mistakes existing in
 the various enterprises, oppose bureaucracy, oppose all kinds
 of breach of labour discipline and greatly strengthen labour
 discipline.
 For this purpose too we must constantly - pay close atten-
 tion to the living conditions of the masses of the workers.
 On the basis of increased production, the material and cul
 nd working conditions of the workers shall be
 tural life a                                          -
 improved step by step wherever necessary and possible. To material and cultural well-being of the workin
 raise the g
 class and all the labouring PeoPle and to prevent our coun-
 try             invaded by imperialism constitutes the
 Y from be
 ultimate aims of the industrial development and all other
 efforts of our country.
 I believe that in the deliberations of this Congress you
 will and should thoroughly discuss these problems.  If these
 ,,i
 problems are solved correttly?, we will further improve our
 work in the trade unions.

 of the Communist Party, will be further improved and that
 our trade unions will actually become, as Lenin said, the
 "builder of new life," the "educator of tens of millions."
 Comrades.  Aside from shouldering the above-mentioned
 responsibilities
 in the domestic field, the Chinese working class has to take upon itself grave responsibilities in the in-
 ternational field.  That is the Chinese working class must
 struggle for the unity of the working class of the whole
 .
 world and under the leadership of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions must strive for the unity of the international
 working-class movement and work together with the working
 class of all the countries and the progressive mankind as
 a whole for the defence of world peace and security.
 The Chinese working class which has already achieved
 victory must whole-heartedlY render every Possible assistance
 to the working class and labouring people in capitalist as
 well as colonial and semi-colonial countries.  This is a
 glorious duty which we must not shirk.  The Chinese trade
 unions must in the future strengihen their work in this respect
 so that it can be better carried out.
 Comrades, the responsibilities in both domestic and in-
 ternational fields of the working class as the leading class
 in our country are enormous.  In order to gradually carry
 out national industrialization and the transition to a socialist
 society and in order to best shoulder our international re-
 sponsibilities, we must consolidate the unity in the ranks
 of the working class further consolidate the alliance of the
 12
 intellectuals and strengthen
 peasants and the workers and 1
 the people's democratic front based on the alliance of the
 workers     peasants.  Our comrades must take note that
 Ars and the whole country is paying close attention to every piece of
 work done b    working class, and the labouring people and
 by the progressive mankind throughout the world are following our
 work with the same interest.  The success or failure of our
 work will have far-reaching effects.  Therefore, our trade
 to remember what Com-
 unions must educate all the workers
 rade Mao Tse-tung has taught  -not to be satisfied with
 bht us
 our past achievements, never to show arrogance, and to
 maintain every minute of the day a modest attitude of learn-
 mg, to abandon all bad habit 1s and prejudices and make every
 effort to improve ourselves-so that the working class can
 do all its work in an ever better manner.  Only in this way
 shall we not disappoint the hope of all the Chinese people
 and the labouring people of the whole world.
 We are confident that under the brilliant leadership of
 the Communist Party of China and of Comrade Mao Tse-
 tuug, with the common efforts of the Chinese working class
 and the entire population, and with the mighty help of the
 Democracies and the working

 Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Tse-tung and the
 Communist Party of China the Chinese working class,
 1
 displaying unmatched courage and firm will, has always stood in the forefront whether in the struggle for the libera-
 tion of the Chinese people, in the construction of the country,
 of in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.  The
 workers have shown inexhaustible wisdom and strength, and
 have constantly overcome difficulties.  Many heroes and
 model workers both men and women have emerged from
 the working class. Victories have been won. These victories
 have brought about profound and basic changes in all aspects
 of Chinese society.
 In the three years since the liberation of the whole
 country, the Chinese people have become united as never
 before; state economy, disrupted by Protracted fighting, has
 been completely restored; people's democratic dictatorshi

 have grown on an unprecedented scale its status as the
 leading class has been strengthened.  All this has created
 advantageous conditions for our country's large-scale, long-
 term and planned construction.

 Mao Tse-tung and the Communist Party of China the Chinese
 people have the strength a+ their command to achieve great
 and brilliant successes.

 SPEECH  BY  UN  PO-CHU  ON  BEHALF  OF THE
 CENTRAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT
 Delegatcs and Comrades:
 The Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions was
 inaugurated in Peking today. On behalf of the Central
 ~'
 People's Government I extend warm greetings to the Con-
 gress.
 U11der the leadership of the Communist Party of China
 and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung, the Chinese working class, together with the
 Chinese PeoPle has finally achieved victory in the great rev-
 olution and has founded the People's Republic of China
 after more than thertYYears of heroic struggle. This is the
 greatest victory the 'ninese worKLng cuss arm tiie iauuuf-
 ins people of China have ever won in their history.  It is
 b
 precisely because the state system of this country is that of
 a people's democratic dictatorship, led by the working class
 and based on the alliance of the workers and peasants that
 the status of the working class and the labouring people has
 b
 undergone distinct, basic changes.
 Ever since its establishment, the Central People's Gov-
 ernment of the People's Republic of China, in order to
 safeguard the fruits of the people's victory and to consolidate
 the people's democratic dictatorship, has relied on the working
 class and the people of the whole country to carry out the
 great Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea,
 the land reform  suppression of counter-revolutionaries,
 San Fan and Wu Fan movements, and the democratic reform
 in the enterprises throughout the country.  Through more
 than three years of ceaseless struggle, the working class has

 From the very first day, the Central People's Govern-

 attention to the status and role of the working class in the
 state power of our country, and to the great significance of
 strengthening the trade union work as a means of achieving
 the industrialization of the country and its advancement

 towards socialism.

 Your first successes in your creative work, dear
 Chinese
 comrades, have without any doubt put
 y          you on the road to
 even greater successes.
 You have taken this road under the guidance
 of your
 respected and beloved leader Chairman of your glorious
 Communist Party, Comrade Mao Tse-tung.
 We view with great joy th
 the progressive transformation
 of China.  The Chinese workers have the right to be proud
 of the achievements to
 which they are devoting
 Y            al] their
 efforts and all the
 passion of a       that loves its coun
 people                trY.
 In their work of creating a new and 1?iaPPY life in your
 country, which without any doubt is laying the foundations
 of socialism the Chinese people are drawing inspiration
 from the great historic lessons and the victorious experiences
 of the Soviet people-
 the first      in the hi
 people       storY of mankind
 to have shown that
 capitalism was neither universal nor
 eternal, and who with the October Revolution of 1917, showed
 that the era of socialism had begun, ope
 ninb new perspectives
 before all mankind.
 Comrades while
 you men and women workers of New
 China are winning d
 b  ay after day new successes on the road
 to a better life the situation of the workers in the capitalist,
 semi colonial and colonial countries is very different.
 In point of fact misery is increasing in these countries
 wreakin  havoc amon                                 '
 g           g families.  Unemployment is rapidly
 expanding.  Wherever s
 octal welfare exists
 it is subjected
 to attacks. Social legislation is
 under constant attack.  Re-
 pression is striking the working class its
 militants and its
 organizations. Where the monopoly capitalists are accumulat-
 in maximum gigantic profits the 1
 wing conditions of millions
 of working men g   n and women are
 becoming more and more
 unbearable.
 This is why the number of struggles for wage demands
 has increased considerably recently. derablY recentl}.  The workers
 with ever-
 22
 I
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 increasing unity of action, are switching more and more on
 to the offensive in these struggles.
 The recent strikes in Japan, the many strikes in India
 and other countries of South-East Asia and the general in-
 crease of struggles against unemployment, dismissals and
 the lowering of real wages, are proofs of positive develop-
 nients of this mass action.
 Every case confirms the direct link that exists between
 the workers' struggles for their demands and the action of
 the people for national independence and the defence of peace.
 How is one to characterize the conditions under which
 the struggles of the workers and the activity of the World
 Federation of Trade Unions are developing in the capitalist,
 colonial and semi-colonial countries?  We can answer this
 question as follows:
 1.  The unceasing struggles of the labouring masses for
 better living conditions, for pj eace and national independence
 are resulting in the open violation by th~ ruling classes of
 the capitalist countries of their own bourgeois laws.  These
 bourgeois laws no longer sufficiently Protect the ruling classes
 against the legitimate demands of the working masses.    The
 ruling classes are resorting more and more to brutal, anti-
 democratic and anti-working class repression. They are
 changing their regimes into police regimes which will
 absolutely Protect their class privileges.
 Political and social discrimination of a fascist character
 is one of the bases of the new laws which the ruling class
 is attempting to establish and extend.
 2.  Contradictions of interests between the capitalist
 countries are arising and growing more open than in pre-
 vious years.  Other conflicts are rapidly maturing which are
 the direct consequence of the intolerable policy of the Amen-
 can imperialists in trying to achieve world hegemony.
 23

 11
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 In face of these contradictions of interests between
 capitalists eager for maximum       the working profits,               class with
 its vanguard organizations and its trade unions is developing
 its struggles on the basis of
 proletarian internationalism.
 In each country, the working class i
 is furthering the cause of
 unit  among workers,          intellectuals unity              peasants,            and the pro-
 gressive sections of the bourgeoisie.
 Thus  the ardent
 struggle of the peoples for their democratic rights and vital
 needs is linked with their no less ardent struggle for national
 independence.
 3.  The conflicts between
 the peoples of the colonial
 and
 semi-colonial countries and the governments of the colonial
 powers are growing, and b&oming more intense.  Within
 the last few ears the
 y        have extended to new sections of the
 world.  The whole colonial system is shaken t
 to all its tradi-
 tional and vital foundations.  The colonial and feudal systems
 are seeing the rise of millions of human beings in
 open
 struggle against colonial oppression.
 In these struggles, the estimations
 we made here in
 Pekin  in December 1949 at the Trade Union Conference
 of
 the Asian and Australasian Countries concerning the role and
 tasks of the trade unions have roved to
 p        be correct.
 In the colonial and semi-colonial countries the trade
 unions are a real force of a genuinely
 national character from
 the moment when they tale an active art in the
 P        people's re-
 sistance against Colonialism and when they become impor-
 tant basis for the development of mass action.
 This makes the
 colonialists want to subject the trade
 unions completely to their
 own policies.  But they are meet-
 iiig with increasing difficulties.
 We certainly foresee the time when the trade unions
 she                                                tn
 colonial and semi-colonial countries will surge forward
 and develop fully.
 This will be the moment when the Peo-
 24
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/08 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000200100037-4
 pie, through a tremendous effort of patriotism, will have
 shaken off the hold of imperialism and colonial '
 slavery.
 It is the honour and pride of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions to support this great historic struggle of the
 peoples for their national independence and national libera-
 tion wherever it is necessary.
 It is the honour and pride of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions to have stimulated the great currents of in-
 ternational solidarity on behalf of the complete liberation of
 the colonial peoples.
 It is the honour and pride of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions to have stood since June 25, 1950, side by side
 with the Korean PeoPle who rose united and solid as a rock
 against the aggression of the United States imperialists.
 In the last three years the World Federation of Trade
 Unions has continuously affirmed its active solidarity with
 the wonderful people of Korea.  From this rostrum
 you will
 permit its representative to express his gratitude and pay
 homage both to the fighting Korean people and to the heroic
 Chinese Volunteers.
 The move for peace from the governments of the People's
 Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of
 Korea, shows the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the
 whole Korean question and was welcomed last month by all
 the peoples of Asia and by those of the other conti:.~nts.
 Today, the facts once more prove that there is no in-
 ternational conflict that cannot be settled by discussion and
 negotiation.  We are now living in a period of major im

 Comrades!
 One of the reasons why we attach great importance to
 the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions is that it
 takes place five months before the convocation of the Third
 World Trade Union Congress which will be held in Vienna
 beginning on October 10 next.  Organized by our Federa-
 tion, the Third World Trade Union Congress will be effec-
 tively the congress of all the workers of the whole world.
 This Congress will be a congress of unity in which or-
 ganizations ?anizations not affiliated to the WFTU but desirous of defend-
 ing the workers' interests and peace, may Participate.
 On April 22> the Executive Bureau of the World Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions appealed to the workers of the world
 to prepare for the Third World Trade Union Congress.  What
 language does the World Federation of Trade Unions use to
 all the workers of the world to all the trade unions, whether
 they be members of the Federation or not?
 It is the language of comradeship, of fraternity and of
 so]}darity.
 The World Federation of Trade Unions said to them:
 Dear Comrades and Friends,
 We live in different countries. We represent all the
 races, all the nationalities, and all the political and
 religious convictions on earth.  We speak different
 languages but we have common interests for we are class
 brothers.  We are united in the conviction that the living
 conditions of the workers are deteriorating in the capi-
 talist and colonial countries and that we must struggle
 for an improvement.
 We are united in the conviction that, wherever it
 exists, social legislation should be improved, and that
 it should be instituted wherever there is none.
 We are united in the conviction that. an end must
 be put to super-exploitation, and that discrimination

 forbid the legitimate activities of the trade unions, nor rob man of his rights and his basic and sacred democratic
 liberties.
 Finally,
 we are, united in the conviction that peace can be safeguarded and that war is not inevitable.
 We have, then,, abroad basis for unity.  If we want
 to win our struggles we must make this unity of common
 aims and interests into a unity of action. Wherever the
 workers are united success is assured.
 The World Federation of Trade Unions has always
 considered the struggle for international unity of action
 anion                  greatest duty.  It has always
 rs as its g the workers
 promoted the unity and action of workers.
 BY preparing for it at all places of work, make the
 Third World Trade Union Congress a great congress of
 unity of all the workers of all countries.
 Undoubtedly        organization is in the position so
 no other to speak to the workers of the world.  The splitters in the
 ranks of trade union movement are the advocates of im-
 colonial and semi-colonial
 perialist policies who support the
 systems because they personally are closely linked with the
 : ments.  It is
 interests and actions of the imperialist goven
 not the         speak this way to the workers of all cour,-

 The World Federation of Trade Unions is conscious of
 its responsibilities before the workers of the whole world. We do not feel responsible only before the 80 million mem-
 bers of the Federation or the workers affiliated to the World
 Federation of Trade Unions.

 parts of the                  World Federation of Trade
 Programme of the Unions as their programme, and to use the means of action
 which are recommended by the Federation.

 Engels, and Lenin.
 The banner of Marx Engels, Lenin and Stalin is the

 the world.
 mankind throughout
 Marx had the warmest sympathy and concern for the
 national liberation struggles of the Chinese people in history.
 As early as a hundred years back Marx wrote many articles
 on the Opium War and the Taiping Revolution.  In his writ-
 ings he bitterly condemned the criminal acts of the aggressors
 and the unjust war they launched against the Chinese people.
 Together with Engels he predicted that from the struggles
 of the Chinese people one would see "the dawn of a new era
 in the whole of Asia."  Today, this prediction has already
 come about.  Without the guidance of Marxist ideology, it
 would be impossible to imagine the victory of the Chinese
 revolution.  In his work On People's Democratic Dictator-
 ship, Comrade Mao Tse-tung stated:  "We are indebted to
 Marx Engels, Lenin and Stalin for giving us our weapon.
 This weapon is not a machine-gun, but Marxism-Leninism."
 He further stated: "The Chinese people found Marxism-
 Leninism, a universal truth which is applicable anywhere.
 The face of China then began to change."
 The Chinese people found the truth of Marxism-Leninism
 through a process of groping and searching.
 In the early Years of the twentieth century, and before
 the bourgeois revolution in 1911, the name of Marx was men-
 tioned in the publications of China and Marxist theory was
 introduced in bits and pieces.  But at that time the Chinese
 working class had not yet become an independent political
 force and the revolution at that time was led by the bour-
 geois and petty-bourgeois elements,  The bourgeois and
 ii2
 petty-bourgeois revolutionaries only mentioned Marx in pass-
 ing, they could not understand the theory of Marx at all.
 At that time the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois revolu-
 tionaries attempted to reform their country on the model of
 the western capitalist. countries; they ended in failure.
 Doubts and distrust of the bourgeois ideology among Doubts Chinese people arose and increased; the First World Wthe
 ar
 proved that capitalist system could only bring disaster to
 the people of the world.  The victory of the October Socialist
 Revolution which broke out during the First World War
 brought new hopes to the Chinese people.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung said:
 The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us
 Marxism-Leninism.     The October Revolution helped the
 advanced people of China and of the whole world to
 adopt a proletarian world outlook as an instrument for
 looking into a nation's future or for reconsidering one's
 own problems.
 During the First World War, following the great de-
 velopment of national capital in China, there was a great
 development of the Chinese working class. Working-class
 movement began to develop and Marxist ideology helped
 the advanced people of China to see that the dependable force
 in the reform of our country was no other but this developing
 force of the working class.
 Thus  under the immense influence of the October
 Socialist Revolution the Chinese started to really understand
 Marxism.  Moreover, as soon as Marxism came to China,
 it was combined with the working-class movement through
 the progressives among the intelligentzia of the time and
 became a powerful material force.

 and the Chinese working-class movement> the Chinese Corn-

 And we are confident that it will continue to lead the Chinese
 1;eupis to socialism and the final aim o  communism.
 The appearance of the modern working class in China
 and the development of the working-class movement were the
 class basis for the birth of the Communist Party of China.
 But with this condition alone and without the dissemination
 of Marxism-Leninism in China there could not have been the
 birth of the Chinese Communist Party.  For had the working

 class relied only on their own force, it would have led them
 to the ideas of syndicalism, and there would not have been
 an awakening to communism.  On the ideological basis of
 a
 syndicalism there would not have been the birth of the Corn- munist Party. Only by permeating the scientific theories of
 Marxism within the Chinese working class was it possible
 to change the Chinese working class from a class in itself
 to a class for itself, and organize a real militant revolutionary
 political party-the Communist Party of China.
 The history of the Communist Party of China and of the
 Chinese revolution led by the Party, i; the history of the
 application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China.
 It is also the history of the struggle of Marxist-Leninists in
 China against various erroneous ideologies.  This history
 centred around the Chinese Bolsheviks headed by y Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung.  In guiding the Chinese revolution. . Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung has combined the universal truth of Marxism-
 Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung's theory and tactics on the Chinese
 revolution based on i\Iarxism have applied and developed
 the teachings of Marx Engels Lenin and Stalin in accord-
 ance with the concrete conditions in' China.
 Marxist's theory on class struggle and the idea of the
 hegemony of the proletariat are clearly manifested in the
 a
 works of Comrade Mao Tse-tung.  Basing himself on this
 theory,              Tse-tung routed the erroneous ideas

 Comrade Mao
 and actions of opportunism of all kinds.  The opportunists
 opposed and distorted Marxism on this very basic point.
 The thesis of the Right-wing opportunists actually, was the denial or reconciliation of class struggle, the giving up or
 of the proletariat. The "Left"
 weakening of the hegemony
 wing opportunists also did not understand how to conduct
 class struggle, nor did they - understand how hegemony of the proletariat can be won over. Therefore they caused the
 ~i,
 revolutionary struggles of the proletariat to end in failure.

 If we followed the direction of the opportunists, we would have lost hegemony of the proletariat.

 opportunism.  He  persistently opposed the non-Marxist
 thesis of den'             le, and at the same time, ably
 denying class struggle,
 analysed the concrete historical situation and starting from the ractica
 1 conditions of the relative strength of all classes, practical
 formulated the tactics of revolutionary struggles in opposing
 blind adventurism.

 on the                          and peasants; it is a revolution of
 alliance- of workers

 and  bureaucratic  capitalism.  Under  all  circumstances,
 whether before or aft +er the victory of the revolution, Com-

 of the proletariat
 When analysing the causes of failure of the revolutions
 other countries in 1848-1849, Marx
 in Germany, France and
 aid special attention to the role of the peasants in revolu-
 tionary tionar struggles.  This thought of Marx was later developed
 Y Lenin and Stalin into the thought of alliance between
 b
 workers and peasants under the leadership of the proletariat.
 This is the keyproblem of the achievement of revolutionary
 victory by the proletariat.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung, basing himself on the theory
 of Marx Engels Lenin and Stalin on peasant question, has
 fully appraised the force and role of the peasantry in the
 a
 Y  PP
 Chinese revolution.  China at present is still a country in
 redominant position
 which small farming economy is in a predominant position
 quantitatively.  Therefore the peasant question  has its
 special significance.  The basic divergence of view between
 Chinese Marxists and opportunists is sharply expressed in
 the peasant question.  During the First Chinese Revolution-
 ary Civil War, the Right opportunists as represented h
 ~                                      Y
 Chen Tu-hsiu, paid attention only to the co-operation with
 the Kuornintang, and forgot about the peasantry.  On the
 other hand> the "Left" opportunists as represented by Chang
 Kilo-tao, paid attention only to the working-class movement,
 and also forgot about the peasantry.  Both of these two
 groups of opportunists did not know where to find allies.
 Only y Comrade Mao Tse-tung who thoroughly understod the
 teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin correctly solved
 this problem.  As early as 1926, he pointed out that the
 broadest and most reliable ally of the proletariat was the
 peasantry.  Later on, in his work, On People's Democratic
 Dictatorship, Comrade Mao Tse-tung again emphatically
 Pointed out.
 116
 The foundation of the people's democratic dicta-
 torship is the alliance of the working class, peasantry
 and urban petty-bourgeoisie.  It is mainly the alliance
 of the workers and Peasants.... In over-throwing im-
 perialism and the reactionary clique of the Kuomintang,
 these two classes are the major force.  The transition
 from New Democracy to socialism also depends Pri-
 marily upon the alliance of these two classes.
 Therefore the Chinese workers who have acted under
 the direction of Marxism should not, even for one minute,
 detach from their own peasant brothers nor overlook the
 alliance with the peasant class.  They should know well how
 to maintain and develop this alliance, to educate and reform
 the peasantry through this alliance, so as to march with them
 towards socialism.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung's theories on the united front,
 on revolutionary wars on the construction of New Democ-
 racy, etc. all are conclusions drawn from the practical ex-
 periences of the Chinese revolutionary struggles, through the
 application of the Marxist standpoint viewpoint and Marxist
 method.  Lenin said:  "The Marxian doctrine is omnipotent
 because it is true."  The victory won by the Chinese revolu-
 tion under the direction of the thought of Mao Tse-tung also
 shows that the Marxian doctrine is true, and also omnipotent.
 As in the past and present the working class and other
 labouring people of China should rely, in the future, on
 Marxism as their guide; they uide; the y should unite with the working
 class an,. the working people of all nations and march on
 victoriously under the g        a lorious fghting banner of Marx,
 Y and
 Engels Lenin and Stalin.
 Comrades, when commemorating the anniversary of the
 birth of Marx, the great founder of scientific socialism, we
 should carry out ideological education on Marxism more

 founding of our Party, we have carried out much work and
 achieved great results in the field of
 popularizing Marxism
 and in the carrying
 out of ideological education in Marxism
 among our working class and other labouring people.
 ,
 Since 1949, when the Chinese revolution achieved nation-
 wide victory, we have also persistently strengthened Polit-
 ical and ideological education among
 the working class.
 During these four       beside
 g          years,      s the education in current
 events and policies which has been carried out from time
 to time, alongside of the development of
 p       the work of the
 whole nation, ideological education in
 Marxism, such as the
 education in materialist world outlook
 education in the laws
 of social development  education in class struggles and
 e:iucation regarding the future of socialism and communism
 has been carved out more or less systematically.  Such
 education has          achieved the generally           expected results. This
 ..
 was manifested in the great raising of the
 g      level of class con-
 sciousness of the workers and the continuous appearance of
 inventions and creations among the
 workers.  Besides in
 different enterprises education has s been carried out among
 the workers on the development of
 production.  It is pointed
 out that only by the development o
 Y  Y                 of production can the
 strength of the working class be
 increased.
 g                      As instructed
 by Lenin and Stalin the establishment of every new factor
 Y          y
 is equal to the establishment of a
 new fortress. It is pointed
 out that only by the development of roduction can the
 p                liv-
 ing standards of the working class and other working Peo-
 pie be gradually raised.  The
 working masses are t
 g                 aught
 to understand the identity of the immediate and long-term
 interests, the identity of the interests of the individual and of
 the state, and the superiority
 of socialist enterprises. As a
 result the political level of the m
 asses of workers has

 ness of the working                            ,
 the consciousness of the working class is raised, the more
 will the road of our country to industrialization be secured.
 This is an inevitable law.
 But it must be pointed out that not all our comrades

 of         out Marxist education among the working class.

 tion in Marxism among nation    working class is not yet balanced

 regions the tendencies of syndicalism and economism still
 exist. Both these tendencies have a common feature, that
 is both of them neglect the carrying out of the ideological education           among the workers or dare not prop-

 Delegates Guests and Comrades:
 The Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions is
 now drawing to a victorious conclusion.
 The Congress, held from May  to 11, has heard reports
 on trade union work in China, on the amendments to the
 Constitution of the Trade Unions of the People's Republic
 of China on the financial work of the trade unions of China
 and on conditions in industry. After discussions at group
 meetings and at plenary sessions, the Congress has adopted
 resolutions of historical significance concerning the above-
 mentioned reports.  In these reports and resolutions, the
 Congress has summed up the experience in the trade union
 work in China during the past four years and has defined the
 policy y and task of the trade unions of China during the period
 of national planned economic construction.  A new leading
 organ of all the trade unions of China-the Seventh Execu-
 tive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions-
 has been elected at this Congress, which is a sign of the
 unprecedented unity of the Chinese working class.  vTe
 believe that the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-
 China Federation of Trade Unions, under the leadership of
 the Communist Party of China, will uphold and develop the
 glorious traditions of China's trade unions, keep in close
 contact with and whole-heartedlY serve the masses of work-
 ers throughout the country, and correctly and thoroughly
 Y~            Y carry out the resolutions of the Congress.  We believe that
 it will mobilize and organize the workers of the whole coun-
 try for the successful accomplishment of the new historical
 task of ensuring the fulfilment and over-fulfilment of the

 This    eat achievement is inseparable from the intimate

 in a democracy led by the working class can the

 enjoy such a glorious and important position.  At the same
 time we are even more profoundly aware of our great re-
 sponsibilities in the construction of our country.  The trade
 union organizations at different levels must hereafter further
 strengthen education in patriotism among the workers of the
 country.  The trade unions must educate the workers to
 observe state policies, laws and decrees and supervise their
 implementation.  The trade unions must in this way fulfil
 their responsibilities in the period of national construction,
 and play their role as the solid social pillar of the people's
 democratic state power.
 Our Congress has been honoured by the speeches of the
 representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the
 peasants at the closing session and by messages of greet-
 ings from people of various circles of the country.  These
 greetings represent the expectations and encouragement of
 the people of the country towards the Chinese working class.

 Mao Tse-tung, working in common with the entire Chinese people and with the support and assistance of the labouring
 people of the world, will certainly succeed in the great his-

 and have thus become transmission belts between the Party
 and the masses.  After the establishment of the people's

 of the Party have become a school of administration, a schoo
 of management and a school of communism for the workers.
