 Key Judgments
 China: Short-term Implications
 of Deng Xiaoping's Death
 Deng Xiaoping's death will intensify political jockeying among senior
 leaders to assume his formidable power and influence, but none is likely in
 the next six months to fill Deng's unique role as elder statesman and princi-
 pal power broker.
 We believe all key participants, including the military, will try to prevent
 succession maneuvering from jeopardizing domestic stability, policy conti-
 nuity, and the preeminence of the party-interests shared by most, if not
 all, top-level leaders.F__1
 Although Deng's designated heir, party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, has
 a modest edge over political rivals in the near term, the unresolved leader-
 ship picture means decisionmaking will be collective and-without Deng's
 strategic vision-cautious and defensive in the months following Deng's
 death
 Under this scenario, we do not expect significant changes in China's funda-
 mental political and economic policies. However, Beijing's increasing
 assertiveness in its relations with the United States will probably continue
 to sharpen differences over human rights, proliferation, and trade issues.
 The potential volatility of Chinese society and politics tempers our judg-
 ments on short-term probabilities. The leadership's efforts to effect a
 smooth transition could be frustrated by spontaneous outbreaks of local
 unrest over social and economic conditions-for example, rice or tax riots
 that threaten to escalate-or a sudden deepening of political rifts in the
 leadership.F__1
 The United States has few means to influence the succession process with-
 out risking widespread Chinese condemnation. Some US actions, such as
 imposing trade or proliferation-related sanctions, could intensify leadership
 infighting. Other US steps-such as an exchange of presidential visits-
 would provide a moderate boost to present leaders, and especially Jiang
 Zemin.

 February 1994
 Images of Decline. Photographs chronicle Deng's
 increasing physical frailty. His daughter, Deng Rong,
 finally admitted in mid-January 1995 that her father's
 health was in decline and his days numbered. Deng's last
 public appearance, on television in February 1994,
 showed him to be in obvious decline. Observers point to
 additional physical enfeeblement evident in the recently
 released photograph of a seated Deng allegedly watching
 a fireworks display on 1 October 1994, China's National
 Day; some observers interpret the photo as Beijing's way
 of alerting the Chinese populace that Deng's time is near.

 Discussion
 The Void Deng Leaves
 With "paramount leader" Deng Xiaoping prob-
 ably in his final year, China is on the brink of a
 major political transition. The Deng succession
 will be less a competition for rank and title-
 Deng holds no formal position-than a compli-
 cated political chess cam to determine  ho
 will emerge       inher-
 iting Deng's informal but formidable power
 and influence over the Communist Party, gov-
 ernment and military institutions, and state
 policy
 The succession is also a political transition
 from China's "second generation" of elderly
 leaders-those who followed Mao and his
 peers-to a "third generation," who as adults
 have known no other China but the People's
 Republic. Jiang Zemin-party chief, Central
 Military Commission Chairman, and state Pres-
 ident-is officially designated by the Central
 Committee as the "core" of this next generation
 of leaders]
 A Broad Interest in Stability...
 The current leadership roster-a compromise
 arrangement that emerged in the heat of
 Tiananmen in 1989-was assembled by Deng
 and his elderly compeers to ensure political sta-
 bility and policy continuity. This uneasy tacti-
 cal alliance-centered on Jiang, Premier Li
 Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji-recog-
 nizes the political imperative of cooperation
 and has been moderately effective in submerg-
 ing personal differences in the interest of man-
 aging China. China's leaders have strong
 Key Questions
 ? What effect will Deng 's death have on
 Chinese policies?
 ? Will the question of a political "succes-
 sor" to Deng be resolved in the follow-
 ing six months?
 ? How will Deng's death a ect the US
 relationship with China?
 Working Assumptions
 ? Post-Cultural Revolution political
 rules-consensus-building policymak-
 ing, no bloody purges or appeals to
 groups outside the party-will prevail.
 ? China's neighbors, and_.East Asia in gen-
 eral, will remain politically stable and_ ....
 nonthreatening.
 ? No outside power will attempt to steer
 China's succession.
 ? China will su er no major economic
 shocks.
 incentives to maintain the outward appearance
 of unity and to facilitate a smooth transition.
 A divisive competition for power would:
 ? Jeopardize continued economic growth,
 which requires a strong, stable center and
 broad popular participation.
 ? Dissipate the party's scant remaining legiti-
 macy and possibly encourage popular opposi-
 tion in a repetition of the Tiananmen
 formula-a publicly divided leadership inter-
 acting with unruly crowds.
 ? Undermine China's growing international
 stature-diligently and successfully nurtured
 by Beijing after 1989-and scare off foreign
 investors
 Senior leaders of the People's Liberation Army
 (PLA) share this interest in-and are essential
 to-preserving stability following Deng's
 death. Above all, they hope to avoid a repeat of
 Tiananmen, in which main force units were
 called upon to suppress civil unrest. Moreover,
 the military high command has in general
 bought into economic reform; for example, the
 Army receives substantial budgetary infusions
 drawn from the profits of commercial military
 enterprises. We expect Army leaders to con-
 tinue their broad         support of the Jiang
 leadership, even as their disinclination to get
 involved in political maneuvering is tested by
 their desire to strengthen the PLA's institutional
 position in the new era.-
 ... But Political Jostling
 Is Already Under Way
 The premium we expect Chinese leaders to
 place on preserving domestic stability does not,
 however, augur a moratorium on political
 maneuvering, as each leader recalculates his
 relative power and his prospects for advance-
 ment or survival under a new regime. Low-key
 competition for advantage is a perpetual preoc-
 cupation among the top leaders, who seek to
 enlarge their respective degrees of control over
 personnel slots, policy portfolios, economic
 resources, and influence within security and
 military forces.
 By these criteria, the present group is relatively
 well balanced. Deng's departure, however, will
 remove an important balancing mechanism;
 indeed, among Deng's accomplishments were
 the moderation of extreme positions and suc-
 cess in settling disputes among fractious politi-
 cal leaders and groups.
 top leaders are maneuvering to
 consolidate their positions as Deng's health
 steadily declines. Indeed such maneuvering has
 probably taken place out of Deng's ken; by
 mid-1994, Deng's health had forced his disen-
 gagement from policy deliberations, and he
 maintains formal contact with top leaders
 through family members and trusted aides.
 Political machinations are likely to continue as
 particular contenders try to strengthen their
 claims: Jiang to solidify his shaky "mandate";
 Li Peng to resist calls for reappraisal of the
 Tiananmen incident; and other senior leaders to
 avoid being slighted or eased aside.
 Personnel Moves? The leadership's shared
 concern for stability also does not rule out the
 dismissal-or marginalization-of one or more
 high-level officials. Some leaders are
 at particular
 risk-for example, Zhu Rongji for having
 alienated too many influential leaders on too
 many issues, and Li Peng for his role in Tianan-
 men. The six months after Deng's death may
 well be characterized by fluid personnel
 What Deng's Death Sets in Motion
 In the immediate aftermath of Deng's death,
 we expect China's top leaders to focus on
 preserving public order. The public security,
 apparatus has almost certainly worked out
 crowd-control contingencies to the last detail
 in seeking to prevent a repeat of 1989, when
 large crowds packed Tiananmen Square to
 mourn former party chief Hu Yaobang.n
 arrangements for enhanced security will go
 into effect immediately upon word of Deng's
 demise. Indeed, the first indications of this
 event may well be a heightened PLA alert
 status and bolstered People's Armed Police
 deployments in and around Tiananmen
 Square, Beijing University, and other open
 places.
 A variety of               media sources
 also indicate China's central propaganda
 apparatus will mount a carefully controlled
 media campaign to project leadership unity
 and a clearly defined policy direction in
 accord with Deng's ideas. Reports
 indicate Beijing s media
 blitz will be accompanied by new efforts to
 repress dissenting points of view; party and
 state propaganda officials have already
 tightened scrutiny in light of Deng's expected
 death]
 Deng's memorial arrangements presumably
 have been drawn up to comply with a 1991
 ban on. mass. public funerals for top leaders,
 conceived in response to the events of 1989.
 In that case, the ceremony will probably be
 small, by invitation only, and held under
 tight security. Foreign leaders are unlikely to
 be invited, although Beijing-based diplomats
 and some `friends of China" such as King
 Sihanouk may be included. In a recent
 example of funeral protocol, the memorial
 ceremony for former Standing Committee
 member Yao Alin was held in the hospital
 where he died, with the entire Politburo
 Standing Committee present.
 We presume Deng 'S funeral committee has
 already been determined and will be headed
 by Jiang Zemin. Every ruling group member
 will probably attend the memorial meeting
 or provide a public explanation for
 absences. Deng's official eulogist-probably
 Jiang-will read from a carefully crafted
 script that is likely to include phrases anoint-
 ing Jiang as an authoritative interpreter of
 Deng's wishes and inheritor of his political
 legacy.-
 Striking the proper balance in the level of
 sanctioned public mourning will almost cer-
 tainly be a delicate problem for Jiang and
 his colleagues. In particular, the leadership
 will probably try to minimize the public
 involvement without seeming disrespectful.
 Public displays carry the risk of either an
 effusive reaction that implicitly denigrates
 Deng's successors or an eruption of public
 outrage against inflation, corruption, and
 repression, such as accompanied Hu's death.
 ret
 arrangements as Jiang seeks to shore up his
 authority by promotin su  orters and trading
 off positions to rivals.
 Jiang's Leg Up. Although no Chinese leader is
 likely to consolidate sufficient power over the
 next six months to assume Deng's political
 dominance, we believe Jiang Zemin has a mod-
 est edge. As party chief, Jiang enjoys substan-
 tial influence over personnel decisions and
 resource allocation. He has used his position to
 make advantageous personnel moves, court
 military support with promotions and bigger
 budgets, and play the statesman by assuming a
 high domestic and international profile.
 ? Potential challengers have, in our view,
 greater liabilities and fewer advantages; Li
 Peng has Tiananmen, and Zhu Rongji is a
 potential scapegoat for economic problems.
 Jiang nevertheless has his own vulnerabilities.
 From the time of his selection in 1989 as a
 compromise choice to head the party, Jiang has
 been criticized as a lightweight placeholder
 lacking both vision and broad institutional
 political backing
 The absence of unqualified support
 for Jiang strengthens the possibility of his
 heading an interim collective leadership, pend-
 ing consolidation of power by a single individ-
 ual.F---]
 The Elders Want In. The remaining members of
 Deng's political generation, by their unwilling-
 ness to go softly into retirement, may compli-
 cate efforts to effect a smooth transition.
 Traditionally, they exercised political influence
 S cret
 and enjoyed the perquisites of power through
 strong personal "pull" with Deng, alliances
 with each other, and support networks through-
 out the Chinese apparatus. More recently,
 through public appearances, some elders-in
 particular, former President Yang Shangkun-
 are trying to insert themselves more promi-
 nently into the political calculus as news about
 Deng grows grimmer.)
 In contrast to 1987 or 1989, when they were
 decisive in ousting two party general secretar-
 ies following outbreaks of public disorder, the
 elders will wield considerably less power after
 Deng's death.
 ? Their numbers have shrunk considerably-
 several prominent revolutionary generation
 leaders have died since the 1992 party con-
 gress.
 ? With the exception of Yang, most are physi-
 cally infirm, mentally diminished, and gener-
 ally unfit for the political fray.
 ? They no longer have Deng to act in their col-
 lective interest or to legitimize their contin-
 ued presence in the arena.F__1
 Although Jiang and his peers would almost cer-
 tainly prefer to avoid the reemergence of the
 veteran revolutionaries on more than a sharply
 restricted basis, contenders for power may feel
 compelled to broaden their bases of support
 and legitimacy with appeals to well-connected
 older leaders. As a result, we cannot rule out
 what in effect would be a short-term perpetua-
 tion of the "Deng Xiaoping system"-that is,
 the temporary emergence of yet another elder

 S \ret
 The "Deng System"
 In China, the regime-whether Imperial,
 Kuomintang, or Communist-has lacked
 institutional mechanisms for resolving politi-
 cal disputes, thus providing no guarantee
 that whoever holds the top posts will in fact
 exercise final authority. In this tradition,
 Deng Xiaoping wielded power informally as
 China's acknowledged "paramount leader"
 and the key remaining member of the revolu-
 tionary generation. "The Deng system "-
 rule by an elder while younger leaders pre-
 side over day-to-day party and government
 business formally began in the early 1980s,...
 when Deng-protege Hu Yaobang supplanted
 Hua Guofeng as party chief. Deng remained
 third in the formal hierarchy.F_-]
 Deng has seldom exercised dictatorial power
 but has usually functioned
 in performing three critical functions. He
 has:
 ? Set broad policy directions.
 ? Acted as referee in disputes that could not
 be settled at lower levels.
 as final arbiter. This could be compatible with
 general leadership continuity and, in particular,
 with Jiang's continuation in his present roles.
 Yang seems to be trying to orchestrate this sce-
 nario; his "investigations" and meetings across
 the country have received wide publicity. His
 ? Wielded veto power over candidates for
 key official posts.)
 Integral to the Deng system has been the
 participation of China's party elders. In
 China's personalistic polity, Deng and his
 octo- and.nonagenarian colleagues-the last
 survivors of the Long March generation that
 .......... .
 founded the People's Republic in 1949-
 were unmatched in prestige, individual con-
 nections, and authority by virtue of their rev-
 ---...
 olution-era experiences. Deng and junior
 leaders maintained consultative relations
 with the elders, which in effect ensured the
 elders' continued participation in the system.
 At present, China's informal politics contin-
 ues to require that the party elite agree upon
 a final arbiter. The passing of Deng and his
 elderly colleagues, however, makes more
 probable a transition to position-based,
 rather than personal, rule. Deng's eventual
 successor is thus likely to lead from the top
 party or state office rather than from behind
 the scenes.
 fall from favor in 1992 and the hostility he
 faces in certain military quarters, however,
 make Yang's possible return to a major active
 leadership role a destabilizing prospect; more-
 over, any arrangement involving a prominent
 role for octo- or nonagenarians must necessar-
 ily be short-term
 Looming Issues
 Regardless of how the succession proceeds,
 China's post-Deng leadership must begin to
 address a formidable range of interrelated
 economic and political issues that, if not
 quickly attended to, will threaten the coun-_.
 try's longer term stability.
 Clarifying the Role of the Party.
 regime survival generally
 depends on a combination of repression and
 an ability to provide economic goods. More
 over, senior Chinese leaders-in initiating
 recent efforts to renew local party institu-
 tions as .instruments of leadership--are try-
 ing to show that they are addressing the
 party's loss of discipline.
 Balancing Center-Local Relations.
 Beijing's relations with the provinces are tra-,
 ditionally marked by tensions between con-
 trol and autonomy. The national leadership
 is now focused on regaining control over
 China's most freewheeling and prosperous
 provinces, through closer central supervi-
 sion of party activities, more vigorous tax
 collection, and tightened regulation of bank-.
 ing practices.
 Redefining Civilian-Military Ties- F
 support from the military establishment
 remains indispensable to the political sur-
 vival of the party and of individual leaders.
 Since Tiananmen, the Army has recognized it
 is the party's guarantor and will probably
 seek greater recognition for its pivotal role,
 in the form of increased budgetary outlays,
 freedom to operate profit-making enter-
 prises, and enhanced influence over foreign
 and national security policies. F--]
 Getting On With Economic Reforms. A
 wide variety of sources suggest that the
 economy will be an important arena of polit-
 ical infighting during the succession period.
 Restructuring state enterprises and the bank-
 ing and finance systems, however, are intrac-
 tably tangled in conflicting bureaucratic and
 political interests. If implemented, such
 reforms would increase unemployment and
 exacerbate social tensions. Some leaders
 may elect-as.. Deng has in the past-to pro-
 pose or jettison policy simply to sharpen
 leadership differences or to leverage tactical
 political advantages.F--]
 Grappling With Corruption. After inflation,
 the Chinese are most concerned about the
 pervasive effects of crime and corruption,
 according to Chinese opinion surveys and a
 variety of anecdotal evidence. Although
 Beijing has pursued a series of highly publi-
 ciZed antico. rruptaon drives, m s- con uct
 among senior officials and their families
 generally goes unchecked and unpunished.
 Unless Beijing visibly attempts to bring offi-
 cial corruption under control, efforts to
 restore the party's popular credibility are
 likely to founder.
 Skret
 Policy Departures Unlikely
 Over the six months following Deng's death,
 we do not expect major changes in Chinese
 economic or foreign policies. As portrayed in a
 host of                        media
 reports, China's leaders-while nervous about
 inflation and reform's social side effects, such
 as mounting unemployment, rural-urban
 income disparities, and official corruption-are
 nevertheless convinced that long-term political
 stability depends on continued economic
 growth and foreign investor confidence.
 ? Under Deng, the party leadership has set in
 place a multifaceted modernization effort that
 has greatly increased the stakeholders in
 reform at all levels.
 ? Beijing's vigorous development of economic
 ties to the rest of Asia and its carefully planned
 cultivation of global political influence dem-
 onstrate a confident and growing presence on
 the world stage from which the Chinese lead-
 ership, regardless of its eventual political com-
 position, will be loath to retreat.
 Moreover, the growth of administrative profes-
 sionalism and functional expertise in the State
 Council over the last 15 years has enabled
 China's Government to function routinely
 without the day-to-day involvement of senior
 leaders. Barring a massive outbreak of social
 unrest-a contingency we view as remote-the
 bureaucracy's relative distance and insulation
 from high politics will probably ensure contin-
 ued efforts to implement current priority poli-
 cies.)
 Without Deng at the helm and the succession
 question still largely unresolved, however,
 decisionmaking will be slower and possibly
 more subject to deadlock. Nobody in the
 leadership has demonstrated Deng's ability to
 broker internal disputes, steer negotiations, and
 shape a consensus around new policy initia-
 tives. Senior leaders will be unwilling to take
 positions that expose them to criticism for com-
 promising basic domestic and foreign interests.
 The commitment to policy stability will, on the
 one hand, produce bureaucratic inertia; on the
 other hand, stubborn inflexibility.-
 Searching for a Soft Economic Landing.
 Beijing's continued efforts to cool the economy
 will probably guide policy in the immediate
 post-Deng period. Since mid-1993, economic
 policymakers have tried to put on the brakes
 through sporadic administrative measures such
 as credit rationing and price controls. In recent
 media comments, Chinese economists express
 confidence that the economy is headed for a
 soft landing in 1995. We are skeptical of this
 judgment, however, and expect a moderately
 harder landing in light of continued massive
 subsidies to the state industrial sector and the
 potential for further inflationary shocks.-
 Beijing will probably also remain hesitant to
 undertake large, controversial, and potentially
 destabilizing reform initiatives on which the
 leadership has long procrastinated.
 a combination of rampant
 inflation and local official malfeasance had
 made them fearful of civil unrest on the eve of
 the September Central Committee plenum. As a
 probable result, they discarded their economic
 agenda for that meeting and focused on political
 and social control issues.
 ? Stalled economic policies-such as further
 reforms of tax collection and the banking sys-
 tem-will remain mired in the uncertainties
 and insecurities of the succession political
 climate.
 Tightening Domestic Controls. Over the next
 six months, leaders in Beijing will almost cer-
 tainly follow up enhanced post-Deng security
 measures with additional prophylactic steps to
 ensure that expressions of dissent remain unor-
 ganized. As custodian of party authority, Jiang
 is using a current "party building" drive as a
 means of strengthening Beijing's ability to
 monitor social moods and economic perfor-
 mance. The party will probably resort to more
 intrusive guidance and scrutiny at all levels.
 For example, Hong Kong press reports indicate
 local-level party units are being encouraged to
 swear oaths of loyalty and service not only to
 the party in general but also specifically to the
 Jiang leadership.
 A More Nationalistic Tone. Beijing will proba-
 bly emphasize broad continuity with foreign
 policy lines laid down by Deng-reinforcing
 China's aspirations to great power status and
 not simply to Third World leadership. This
 could produce a greater assertiveness in foreign
 olicy-toward the United States in particular.
 one of Beijing's top foreign policy
 goals is a working relationship with Washing-
 ton that acknowledges China's growing inter-
 national stature and moves past the tensions
 that have dominated relations since the Tianan-
 men crackdown. Nevertheless, a variety of
 reports over the
 past year point to a running dispute within the
 leadership over China's approach to the United
 States-particularly on issues involving
 Taiwan-which some leaders characterize as
 too "soft" and too willing to negotiate away
 Chinese security interests.
 In the succession context, we expect such con-
 cerns will sharpen the more assertive tone we
 have discerned in Beijing's dialogue with
 Washington after the Administration decoupled
 human rights from China's most-favored-
 nation status renewal last year. In talks on
 GATT accession, intellectual property rights,
 human rights, and other areas of bilateral inter-
 est, the Chinese have increasingly fallen back
 on formulas emphasizing and defending
 China's rights as a sovereign nation. Moreover,
 anecdotal evi-
 dence suggest that even Chinese group
 generally sympa-
 thetic to Western human rights and market-
 access goals support the government when for-
 eign tactics are perceived as "China bashing."
 Greater assertiveness in foreign relations is
 consistent with China's current trade negotiat-
 ing tactics, which
 define trade as a means to further
 China's political goals by "punishing enemies
 and rewarding friends."
 Behind China's Recent Harder
 US Policy Line
 Beijing sharpened its rhetoric toward the
 United States in the controversies surround-
 ing GATT accession negotiations, bilateral
 intellectual property rights talks, and the
 Administration's Taiwan policy review
 China's recent decision to freeze. the China-
 US nonproliferation dialogue and threats of
 broad retaliation fora US-backed resolution
 on China in the UN Human Rights Commis-
 sion (UNHRC) underscore frustration with
 US pressure and possible sanctions.
 ? Chinese policymakers are emboldened by
 their self-described "victory" last May-
 when the United States decoupled China's
 most-favored-nation trade status from
 human rights-and ensuing perceptions of
 China's economic-leverage.F__1
 Beijing is driven by what it perceives as
 Washington's betrayal of the basis for "con-
 structive engagement. " Chinese leaders. view_
 the MFN decision as a commitment by both
 sides to focus on mutual economic interests
 and relegate contentious issues like human
 rights to the side. For example, leaders-
 expecting economic interest and quiet bilat-
 eral dialogue-to deflect US pressure-were
 shook by efforts to obtain a China resolution
 at the UVHRC.
 ? Implicitly, if not explicitly, Beijing is
 drawing,-new: lines on issues-human
 rights, Taiwan-that it has long identified
 as "internal affairs" and matters of prin-
 ciple.l
 Chinese assertiveness is heightened by suc-
 cession concerns. Senior leaders are unwill-
 ing to make concessions that expose them.to
 criticism for caving under Western pressure.
 Even were Deng at the helm, the leadership
 may have laid down the same strong mark-
 ers. On issues like Taiwan and human rights,
 all leaders share "hardline" views. Deng 's
 departure, however, means the-re will be no
 single leader capable, as Deng was, of defin-
 ing the limits of China's assertiveness; with-
 out him, the Chinese run the risk of
 miscalculating their leverage and boxing
 themselves in with threats they feel com-
 pelled to honor.)
 Some in the Community maintain Chinese
 behavior is also driven by the leadership's
 reappraisal of US ties and its conclusion that
 Washington is determined to thwart China's
 modernization
 ? Most agree, however, it is premature to
 conclude that Beijing has reevaluated its
 US relationship; in some areas-especially
 defense-we see little evidence that China
 wants to reduce or terminate bilateral con-
 tacts.
 The Chinese remain sensitive to the economic
 and diplomatic costs of a serious deteriora-
 tion in bilateral relations and appear unwill-
 ing to push differences over trade and human.
 rights to the breaking point. Their responses,
 so far, suggest a desire to continue segregat-
 ing the more contentious issues and follow
 the customary pattern o calculated, con-
 trolled retaliation,
 A Peaceful Transition
 The immediate post-Deng period is likely to be
 relatively tranquil, even as leaders maneuver
 for political advantage. Security arrange-
 ments-involving both the People's Armed
 Police and the PLA-will prove sufficient to
 dissuade potential demonstrators from trying to
 exploit the situation and, after a moment of
 mourning, the state bureaucracy will return to
 its preoccupation with administering the econ-
 omy and preparing for the 9th Five-Year Plan.
 The Army will remain in the barracks and be an
 overall force for stability. Transition politics
 will be driven by Jiang Zemin's efforts to con-
 solidate his leadership and by other leaders'
 countervailing exertions to hem Jiang in or to
 gain influence over him.l
 Low Probability, High-Impact Scenarios
 Our confidence in a relatively calm transition
 over the short term is tempered by the potential
 volatility of Chinese politics and society. We
 cannot rule out a number of contingencies in
 which the well-laid plans of Chinese authorities
 unravel in the face of spontaneous local out-
 breaks of disorder-for example, rice or tax
 riots or protests over local corruption-or lead-
 ership fragmentation, either of which would
 increase the probability of more remote scenar-
 ios.)
 The Reappraisal of Tiananmen
 power former party chief Zhao Ziyang, who is
 still widely admired within the elite for his
 administrative flair in the 1980s reforms. A res-
 urrection of Zhao is improbable, largely because
 it would require the party to reverse Deng's rul-
 ing on Tiananmen as a "counterrevolutionary
 riot" that Zhao fueled by his mistakes. Such a
 reversal would discredit virtually all current
 leaders and many retired elders. =
 Eventually, some contender for power will
 probably seek to enhance his legitimacy and
 bolster his political support by appealing to the
 numerous Zhao proteges still within the sys-
 tem. Steps to reverse the Tiananmen decision
 would be a requirement for gaining support
 from Zhao's network. Under this scenario,
 Zhao would very likely be rehabilitated but not
 returned to a position of power. The reversal of
 the Tiananmen decision would require a politi-
 cal coalition strengthened by several current
 Politburo members, some support from power-
 ful elders, and the assent of senior military
 leaders]
 Such a scenario would have broad effects,
 including a purge of leaders closely associated
 with the Tiananmen crackdown or the Zhao
 dismissal-for example, Premier Li and several
 of his proteges. These steps would increase sys-
 temic pressure to speed up the pace of political
 reforms and market-oriented economic
 reforms]
 The Army Steps In. The probability of direct
 military intervention is low. The Army might,
 however, intervene "to save the nation" in one
 of two situations: widespread disorder or pro-
 longed leadership deadlock. Although Army
 leaders would, under such circumstances, be
 unlikely to impose a system of military rule,
 once involved, it is unclear whether they would
 return control to the existing leadership or
 would compel a top-level shakeup in China's
 leadership organs. To effect such a shakeup,
 military leaders would probably enlist a coterie
 of senior civilian allies and retired elders.
 ? An Army-led shakeup of China's leadership
 would probably have little effect on eco-
 nomic policies but might underscore the
 nationalistic element in foreign policy
 But If We Are Wrong
 Early tipoffs that the succession is not going
 smoothly and that leadership politics are lurch-
 ing toward confrontation would include:
 ? Key omissions or absences from Deng's
 funeral committee.
 ? A eulogist other than Jiang Zemin at Deng's
 memorial.
 ? An unusual role-positive or negative-
 accorded to party elders.
 ? Provocative language-with a clearly identi-
 fiable target-in Deng's eulogy, in postevent
 press commentary, or in quoted leadership
 comments.
 ? An irregular pattern of leadership appear-
 ances or the failure of a leader to make
 expect d public or official appearances.
 An open challenge to Jiang's authority or a
 more overt bid by Jiang to aggrandize his
 power at some later time would involve a
 contest for control over key functional port-
 folios and over top posts in one or more of
 China's three major institutions-the party,
 the government, and the military. At that point,
 we might see:
 ? In the official media, veiled critical references
 to, or unusually explicit praise of, senior lead-
 ers, their known supporters or appointees, or
 Scret
 their policy preferences; marked departures
 from formulistic language, shifting from an
 emphasis on unity toward criticism of
 unnamed leaders for "factionalism."
 ? In the party bureaucracy, evidence of person-
 nel movement in key units such as the Orga-
 nization Department (personnel), Propaganda
 Department (media), and the General Office
 (housekeeping affairs, party records, leader-
 ship security); changes in the leadership of
 the party Leading Groups that supervise gov-
 ernment policies.
 ? In the government apparatus, unusual per-
 sonnel shuffling; unanticipated major policy
 initiatives; sizable cutbacks in, or criticism
 of, current programs closely associated with
 specific leaders-for example, the Three
 Gorges Power Project or the 1993 Tax Plan;
 enhancements in the real authority of "rub-
 berstamp" organizations like the National
 People's Congress or the Chinese People's
 Political Consultative Congress, both of
 which are headed by potential rivals of Jiang.
 ? In the Army, unanticipated personnel moves
 in the Central Military Commission or in the
 three General Departments (Staff, Logistics,
 and Political); statements by senior Army
 leaders that betray any succession-related
 sentiments other than whole hearted endorse-
 ment of Jiang Zemin; thinly disguised efforts
 by retired PLA figures to influence succes-
 sion politics or policy.-
 Implications for the United States
 The United States can have little direct impact
 on the succession. Any action that might be
 perceived as interfering in China's domestic
 affairs or favoring a contender would very
 likely provoke widespread Chinese condemna-
 tion. Under all short-term scenarios, China will
 affect US interests by:
 ? Continuing to emphasize its expanding for-
 eign economic relations, thereby ensuring the
 importance of trade and foreign direct invest-
 ment as central to US-China ties.
 ? Resisting major concessions-for example,
 on human rights, nonproliferation, or admis-
 sion into GATT and the World Trade Organi-
 zation-as fraught with short-term political
 risks for any Chinese leader who might be
 cast as weak in defending Chinese interests or
 sovereignty.
 ? Being particularly sensitive to perceived
 slights to sovereignty over either Taiwan or
 Hong Kong.
 ? Avoiding significant steps toward political
 liberalization or greater emphasis on human
 rights, whether because of the insecurities of
 leadership groups feeling their way toward
 new political relationships or simply out of
 continuity with Deng's policy of linking
 openness to political repression.-
 US actions might indirectly affect the succes-
 sion. For example, additional US trade or pro-
 liferation-related sanctions might intensify
 leadership infighting and fingerpointing in
 Beijing. On the other hand, US gestures to
 improve relations-for example, an exchange
 of presidential visits-might boost the political
 credentials of present leaders, and Jiang Zemin
 in particular.F--]
 Annex
 Significant Chinese Leaders
 Politburo Standing Committee Members
 Jiang Zemin, 68, is General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party,
 President of China, and Chairman of both party and state military commis-
 sions. Jiang is, Dena's public choice as the "core" of the new leadership
 In his public remarks he regularly emphasizes the
 need for party control and the primacy of the center.
 Li Peng, 66, oversees the State Council as Premier. Li reportedly has long-
 standing ties to party elders, largely by virtue of his having been raised in
 the household of former premier Zhou Enlai. Li has been dubbed the
 reflexively anti-Western and particularly sensitive to outside criticism of
 China's human rights record.F__1
 Qiao Shi, 70, is Chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC),
 China's rubberstamp legislature. Information on Qiao is fragmentary, and
 his policy views are largely unknown. Although he is working to increase
 the legislature's influence, his power derives primarily from his back-
 ground in the security and legal apparatus.~
 Li Ruihuan, 60, is Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consulta-
 tive Conference, a "united front" organization of generally non-Communist
 members. Li has strongly supported Deng's economic reform program and
 open-door policy. He held the propaganda and ideology portfolios until
 1992 and currently focuses on united front work.n
 Zhu Rongji, 66, is Vice Premier and People's Bank of China Governor.
 Zhu has been the point man for recent banking and tax reforms. He favors
 market solutions to microeconomic problems but continues to support a
 high degree of state intervention in the economy. A variety of reports indi-
 cate Zhu has broad support within the bureaucracy's reformist wing but
 weak party and military connections.-
 Liu Huaqing, 78, is Vice Chairman of both the party and state military
 commissions and a career military officer.
 Liu has supported Deng's push for military modernization and
 professionalization. A strong backer of closer US-Chinese military ties
 before the Tiananmen crackdown
 wants to renew the relationship.
 Hu Jintao, 52, oversees personnel and organizational affairs and is the
 ranking member of the Secretariat-the working body responsible for
 internal party matters. A staunch public proponent of Deng's reform
 agenda, Hu's background is largely in the party apparatus.n
 A Key Party Elder
 Yang Shangkun, 87, is a former President of China and Vice Chairman of
 the Central Military Commission. A Long March veteran, he has been
 closely allied with Deng for decades. Yang and his half brother were
 removed from the military chain of command in 1992, ostensibly to satisfy
 senior commanders displeased by the Yangs' heavy politicization of the
 PLA. Yang-viewed by some Chinese observers as a key potential broker
 in the successio
