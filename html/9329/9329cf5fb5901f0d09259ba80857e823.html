 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 CHINESE COMMUNISTS CONTINUE
 FORMOSA STRAITS BUILD-UP. 9-0 . . . . .    .    . . .  .  . .  . .  Page  1
 The long-range build-up in military potential in
 East China continues.

 e eRsential to a successful assault on the major off-
 shore islands, have yet to be taken.  No observable
 preparations are required for assaults on several minor
 offshore islands.  C
 USSR SEEN MOVING
 TOWARD BIG-POWER TALKS
 Premier Bulganin's cautious statement on President
 Eisenhower's remarks concerning a great-power conference
 apparently is the initial phase of a maneuver by the
 Soviet leaders to extricate themselves from an untenable
 position.   The USSR had got into a diplomatic blind
 alley as a result of a series of statements implying
 that ratification of the Paris accords would make fur-
 ther international negotiations futile.   In view of the
 failure of such warnings to prevent ratification, Moscow
 is now engaged in preparing the way for a return to its
 former line calling for a five-power conference to dis-
 cuss all the sources of international tension.
 SOVIET UNION REVIVES
 AUSTRIAN TREATY ISSUE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  Page  3
 Molotov's invitation to Chancellor Raab to visit
 Moscow for talks on treaty problems apparently reflects
 Soviet fears that Austria will become linked to NATO
 and dominated by West Germany.       The USSR probably also
 hopes to use the Austrian issue to delay implementation
 of West German rearmament and considers that German
 neutralist sentiment would be greatly strengthened by
 evidence that the USSR is preparing to agree to a
 treaty neutralizing Austria.

 While forces loyal to Premier Diem appear to have
 the upper hand in the city, the premier by his action
 during the current crisis has challenged the Binh Xuyen
 and thereby risked a break with Bao Dai.

 Voroshilov Warns Against Atomic War "Fable":  Voroshilov's
 warning that the USSR could not be intimidated by
 "fables" about nuclear warfare  and other recent re-
 pudiations by Soviet leaders of Malenkov's thesis
 that an atomic war might mean the end of world civili-
 zation  probably were motivated in part by a desire to
 correct any impression that the USSR is weak.  The
 charges that the former premier was guilty of tamper-
 ing with Communist doctrine also might be used in the
 future to undermine his position still further.
 .   Page  1
 Soviet Propaganda on London Disarmament Talks:   The USSR
 seems to believe that the London disarmament talks
 will soon break down.   Moscow did not hesitate to
 violate the secrecy agreement in an attempt to place
 the entire blame on the Western delegates if the con-
 ference fails.                                                     .    .    .    .  .  . .  .    .    .  .  Page  2
 The Austrian Situation:   The decision of the Austrian
 cabinet to accep  the Soviet invitation to Chan-
 cellor Raab to visit Moscow was taken on a rising
 tide of optimism in Vienna.  Encouraged by an ap-
 parent Soviet undertaking to discuss the Austrian
 and German problems separately, the Austrians have
 been exploring the possibility of guarantees against a
 future Anschluss with Germany, and of forms of
 neutrality which might be acceptable to the USSR.

 Peiping Diplomats Display Views Differing From Moscow's:
 Recent remarks by Chinese Communist diplomats to
 Yugoslav officials suggest a Chinese effort to dis-
 play some independence of the Soviet Union.                                                                                                                                                                             The
 statements also indicate a possibility that Peiping
 is dissatisfied with some aspects of its relations
 with Moscow.  I            I .  .  .  .  .  . .                                                                                                                                    .  .  .  .  Page  3
 Soviet Diplomats Comment on Molotov:   The manner in which
 two Soviet diplomats recently spoke of Foreign Min-
 ister Molotov, and the fact that he appears to be
 playing his usual role in foreign policy, suggest
 that his political stock is not likely to suffer a
 spectacular decline in the near future.

 Problems of the Hungarian Leadership:   Hungarian party
 first secretary  a osi is attempt to oust Premier
 Nagy, who was censured on 4 March by the,party
 central committee for "rightist deviation," has
 resulted in increased dissension within the party
 and Rakosi is having difficulty asserting his au-

 Soviet Military Training in East Germany:  The winter
 training program for Soviet army units in East
 Germany is nearing an end.  Developments thus far
 this year reflect the heavy influx of new weapons
 and equipment during 1954 and also suggest greater
 emphasis than last year on air-ground operations.

 The New Delhi Conference:          The propaganda build-up
 Moscow and Peiping are giving the Communist-
 sponsored "Asian Conference for the Relaxation
 of International Tensions," scheduled to meet in
 New Delhi from 6 to 10 April, indicates that con-
 siderable effort will be made at the meeting to
 influence the Afro-Asian conference in Indonesia
 two weeks later.   F7       I . .  .  .  . . .     Page 6

 Laos:   In its efforts to reach a settlement with the
 Communist-backed Pathets, the Laotian government
 has conceded them the right to select a governor
 for one of the two disputed northern provinces.
 Despite this concession, the Pathets, reversing
 an earlier position, have refused to send repre-
 sentatives to Vientiane for further negotiations.

 the USSR.      Tokyo, however, is likely to make a strong
 demand for the return of the Habomais and Shikotan,
 and this may encourage popular feeling for the return
 of the American-held Bonins and Ryukyus.  Meanwhile,
 Moscow may benefit from its continued silence if
 popular pressure for a rapprochement with the USSR
 continues to mount in Japan.                       . .  Page 8

 British Adherence to Turkish-Iraqi Pact:   Iraq's and
 Britain's agreement to replace the Anglo-Iraqi
 treaty of 1930 by a new accord, and Britain's
 decision to adhere to the Turkish-Iraqi defense
 pact, announced on 30 March, strengthen Middle
 Eastern stability.   F_              I .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  12
 Plotting Against Nicaraguan Government:   Plotting
 against    caraguan president  omoza appears to
 have intensified in the past two months.  Hos-
 tile activities among exile groups and the do-
 mestic opposition can be expected to increase
 further with the approach of the presidential
 elections scheduled for late 1956.
 Oil Discovery Stirs Optimism in Brazil:   The discovery
 of oil in Brazil's Amazon valley improves the out-
 look for eventual Brazilian self-sufficiency in
 oil.   Brazil's nationalistic petroleum law, how-
 ever, will tend to slow progress toward this goal.
 Petroleum imports consume almost half of Brazil's
 hard currency earnings.

 SOVIET POLICY DIFFERENCES AND THE FALL OF MALENKOV.  .  .  .   Page  1
 The circumstances surrounding Malenkov's fall pro-
 vide many clues to the general policy orientation of
 the present Soviet leadership.   The February political
 crisis in Moscow involved a number of separate but
 closely interrelated chains of cause and effect, no one
 of which alone adequately explains the change of leaders
 or the accompanying shifts in emphasis in Soviet policy,
 The basic elements in this complex pattern of events sug-
 gest that Malenkov fell as a result of a many-sided con-
 flict between him and Communist Party Secretary
 Khrushchev.

 CHINESE .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .                 .    . , .     Page  7
 Chinese Communist propaganda against the use of
 nuclear weapons has increased greatly in the past two
 months, and a program for indoctrinating the population
 on the effects of such weapons has been launched.
 Peiping apparently calculates that its actions could
 lead to the employment of nuclear weapons against the
 mainland.
 PROSPECTS FOR A COMMUNIST-NENNI SOCIALIST SPLIT .  .  .  .  .  Page  9
 The possibility of a break with the Italian Com-
 munists may be discussed at the Nenni Socialists'
 national congress opening in Turin on 31 March.   In
 view of the weakness of the Scelba cabinet, the
 Christian Democrats might accept Nenni Socialist sup-
 port of a new left-of-center government.   This would
 weaken Italy's co-operation in Western defense policies,
 but would put the administration in a position to carry
 out long-planned reforms, thereby impairing the princi-
 pal source of Communist strength in Italy.

 Military activity during
 the past week has been limited
 to sporadic artillery exchanges
 in the Quemoy area.   The Matsu
 area has remained quiet except
 for a Nationalist air attack
 on nine small Communist patrol
 craft near Foochow on 30 March.
 Soviet foreign minister

 refusing to take
 part in any con-

 mosa question in
 which Nationalist
 China was represented.
 Molotov reaffirmed
 that Moscow supported
 Peiping in this stand,
 although he expressed
 the hope that explor-
 atory talks would
 continue.
 The Communists
 may intend to delay
 both military and
 political moves until
 they can assess their
 support at the Asian-
 African conference
 beginning 18 Arpil.
 They probably hope
 that the conference
 will endorse Peiping's
 claims to Nationalist-
 held territory and
 thereby improve the
 Chinese Communist
 position for either
 military or political
 operations.

 USSR SEEN MOVING
 TOWARD BIG-POWER TALKS
 Premier Bulganin's brief
 and carefully worded comment
 on President Eisenhower's
 statement of 23 March on
 negotiations with the USSR
 after the Paris agreements
 are brought into force sug-
 gests that the Soviet leaders
 are trying to extricate them-
 selves from an untenable po-
 sition.
 The USSR had got into a
 diplomatic blind alley as the
 result of a series of state-
 ments implying that ratifica-
 tion of the Paris accords
 would make further interna-
 tional negotiations futile.
 In view of the failure of
 such warnings to prevent rat-
 ification, Moscow is now en-
 gaged,in preparing the way for
 a return to its former line
 calling for a five-power con-
 ference to discuss all the
 sources of international
 tension.
 Bulganin's declaration
 that the USSR takes "a posi-
 tive view" toward the idea
 of any great-power conference
 which would "contribute to
 the easing of tension in in-
 ternational relations" is
 considerably milder than the
 Soviet press has been in its
 initial reaction to the Presi-
 dent's remarks.
 ment of nuclear weapons.   (See
 article on Chinese nuclear
 warfare propaganda, Page 7,
 PART III)
 Moscow wants to maintain
 the posture of the champion
 of peace and pacific settle-
 ment and has claimed that the
 Western powers, despite their
 public calls for negotiations
 with the-USSR, are actually
 seeking to avoid and discredit
 such talks.  The Soviet leaders,
 therefore, could hardly ignore
 a statement by President Eisen-
 hower on the subject of a fu-
 ture conference.
 Bulganin was careful, how-
 ever, to include in his com-
 ment safeguards which would
 allow the Soviet government
 to reject any specific Western
 initiative.
 Thus, he inserted the
 qualifying phrase that any
 conference must contribute
 to the easing of international
 tensions and, aside from a
 reference to Austria, he made
 no mention of the President's
 expressed preference that a
 conference be limited to the
 four powers.
 These safeguards could
 provide the basis for insist-
 ing at some later date on the
 participation of Communist
 China and the inclusion of a
 whole series of Soviet propa-
 ganda topics on the agenda.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 March 1955
 Bulganin's reference to
 Soviet proposals to hold a
 four-power conference on
 Austria "in the nearest fu-
 ture" may have been intended
 to provide top-level support
 for recent Soviet initiatives
 on the Austrian question.
 It seems more likely, how-
 ever, that this was merely
 cited as evidence of the USSR's
 sincere interest in negotia-
 tions as a means of reducing
 tensions.
 A Soviet commentary broad-
 cast to Europe on 27 March
 pointed to these proposals on
 Austria as evidence that the
 Soviet people "are vitally
 concerned with maintaining
 peace."   It cited as further
 evidence of this Bulganin's
 statement on big-power talks,
 Voroshilov's speech to the
 RSFSR Supreme Soviet, and
 Gromyko's proposals in the
 London disarmament conference.
 SOVIET UNION REVIVES
 AUSTRIAN TREATY ISSUE
 Moscow's suddenly renewed
 interest in encouraging Aus-
 trian hopes for a treaty and
 particularly in seeking a firm
 neutrality commitment from
 Vienna seems to reflect a
 real Soviet fear that there
 is a serious"danger of Austria
 becoming linked to NATO and
 being dominated by West Germany.
 The Kremlin may expect
 that, by inviting Chancellor
 Raab to Moscow for bilateral
 talks and wringing. public
 assurance of neutrality from
 Austria, it can interfere
 with any shift toward the West.
 It may also hope to confront
 the Western powers with a
 fait accompli on Austria if
 and when four-power treaty
 .talks are resumed.
 The care with which Moscow
 continues to maintain the links
 between the German and Austrian
 issues indicates that it prob-
 ably also hopes to use the
 Austrian issue to delay im-
 plementation of West German
 rearmament.   Moscow may con-
 sider that German neutralist
 sentiment would be greatly
 strengthened by evidence that
 the USSR is preparing to agree
 to a treaty neutralizing
 Austria.
 Until recently, Soviet
 .officials had stated publicly
 and privately on a number of
 occasions that an Austrian
 treaty settlement would be
 impossible after ratification
 of the Paris accords.
 Molotov's statements to
 the Austrian ambassador and
 the latest Soviet note, how-
 ever, imply that this is not
 the case.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Voroshilov Warns Against
 Atomic War 'Fable"
 Soviet party presidium
 member Voroshilov has provided
 the latest repudiation of the
 thesis expounded by Malenkov
 in March 1954 that a third
 World War would cause civiliza-
 tion to perish.
 Addressing the RSFSR
 Supreme Soviet on 26 March,
 Voroshilov stated that the
 Soviet Union cannot be in-
 timidated by such "fables,"
 and reassured his audience
 that only capitalism, and not
 world civilization, would
 perish.
 Voroshilov's remarks were
 patterned after the statement
 made on this subject by Molo-
 tov in his speech to the Su-
 preme Soviet on 8 February.
 caused considerable top-level
 displeasure by failing to give
 overriding consideration to
 the nation's military strength.
 Malenkov's colleagues may also
 have feared that the Western
 powers might regard his thesis
 as an indication of Soviet
 weakness or uncertainty which
 offered opportunities for
 exploitation.
 In addition, Malenkov's
 statement may have caused some
 confusion and dissatisfaction
 among second-echelon party
 leaders, which the regime now
 wishes to correct.   It is pos-
 sible, however, that Soviet
 citizens will not in fact be
 reassured by a prolonged dis-
 cussion of the subject of nu-
 clear warfare in their propa-
 ganda media.
 They also followed closely
 a similar pronouncement appear-
 ing in the most recent issue of
 the party publication, Kom-
 munist.
 Kommunist declared that
 the thesis of the "destruction
 of world civilization" is used
 by the apologists of imperial-
 ism to frighten "weak-nerved
 and unstable" elements.
 While not discounting the
 possibility that a future war
 might be more "destructive"
 than those of the past, Kom-
 munist insisted that however
 monstrous the "dying fury of
 capitalism" might be, atomic
 war would only hasten its. ruin.
 Judging from the attention
 now being devoted to clarifying
 the party line on this subject,
 Malenkov's remarks probably
 Malenkov's phrase diverged
 significantly from the long-
 established Bolshevik theory
 that the Communist system is
 destined to win ultimately
 over all others, wars notwith-
 standing.   The charge of
 tampering with Communist dogma
 might be used against Malenkov
 in the future to undermine his
 position still further.
 The Soviet leadership
 presumably is in basic agree-
 ment as to the real hazards
 and possible consequences of a
 general war fought with nuclear
 weapons.   The very fact that
 Malenkov was moved to make his
 March 1954 statement provides
 evidence of a keen awareness
 in Moscow of the implications
 for the Soviet regime of atomic
 warfare.

 Soviet Propaganda
 on London Disarmament Talks
 Soviet charges that the
 Western nations have been sabo-
 taging the London disarmament
 negotiations reached a climax
 at the end of last week.
 TASS published a long
 interview with Gromyko attack-
 ing the Western position in
 the negotiations; and Pravda
 printed an article whic    e-
 scribed the "new" Soviet pro-
 posals introduced on 18 March
 and condemned the Western dele-
 gations for "inventing all pos-
 sible obstacles to reaching
 agreement."
 Moscow probably believes
 that the London talks will
 soon break down as a result of
 the favorable vote on the Paris
 agreements in the French
 Council of the Republic.
 The Soviet proposals ap-
 pear designed to establish the
 final Soviet propaganda posi-
 tion and to saddle the Western
 powers with responsibility if
 the conference fails.
 Pravda justified publica-
 tion ofthee USSR's proposals
 in the secret talks by charg-
 ing that the Western press,
 while hypocritically proclaim-
 ing that the talks were secret,
 deliberately misrepresented
 the attitude of the Soviet
 Union.
 Gromyko's interview was
 described as "a blow against
 misinformation because it
 showed the true meaning of the
 Soviet proposals and unmasked
 the maneuvers" of the Western
 representatives aimed at making
 the work of the conference more
 difficult.
 The secrecy agreement ob-
 viously handicapped Soviet
 attempts to exploit the talks
 for propaganda advantage.
 Moscow found.that the public
 discussion of Vyshinsky's dis-
 armament proposals in the United
 Nations General Assembly last
 fall afforded a much more
 effective opportunity for
 propaganda.
 The Soviet press has also
 attacked the appointment of
 Harold Stassen as special as-
 sistant to the President on
 disarmament problems as a
 "propaganda maneuver" designed
 to screen American preparations
 for atomic war.
 Pravda characterized
 Stassen's nnew title as "quasi-
 comic opera" and declared "it
 is not by chance that the Amer-
 ican press links Stassen's ap-
 pointment with the possibility
 that the London talks will be
 broken off by the United States
 in order to prevent the reach-
 ing of any agreed decisions."
 The decision of the Aus-
 trian cabinet to accept the
 Soviet invitation to Chancel-
 lor Raab to visit Moscow fol-
 lows a tide of rising optimism
 in Vienna.
 Encouraged by an apparent
 Soviet undertaking to discuss
 the Austrian and German prob-
 lems separately, the Austrians
 have been exploring the possi-
 bility of guarantees against

 heretofore in making conces-
 sions to the USSR on'conditions
 for a state treaty.
 Peiping Diplomats Express Views
 Differing From Moscow's
 Recent remarks by Chinese

 of its relations with Moscow.

 Such a position would
 leave Austria under the eco-

 Belgrade's ambassador in
 Moscow has reported that the
 Chinese Communists were dis-
 gruntled by Molotov's foreign
 policy report of 8 February.
 Peiping's charge in Moscow is
 reported to have commented that
 Molotov's remarks on the Far
 East were only "Molotov's
 personal opinion."  Yugoslav
 officials were surprised that
 the Chinese should disclose
 their views to outsiders,

 These remarks would seem
 intended to impress the Yugo-
 slavs with Peiping' s self-respect.,

 Soviet Diplomats
 Comment on Molotov
 Two Soviet diplomats, in
 recent conversations with
 Western officials, have taken
 what appear to be special pains
 to buttress the prestige of
 Foreign Minister Molotov, who
 had recently seemed to suffer
 a loss of authority.
 Molotov's recent diplo-
 matic activity appears to
 indicate, moreover, that his
 usual role in Soviet foreign
 policy has not been reduced.
 Ambassador Lodge reported
 on 17 March that a member of
 the Soviet delegation to the
 United Nations had complained
 to him that the American govern-
 ment and press constantly uis-
 tort normal changes in the
 structure of the Soviet govern-
 ment.
 Another delegate added
 that, in describing Molotov as
 the third-ranking member of the
 Soviet hierarchy, the United
 States had greatly underesti-
 mated his importance, as would
 be proven in the course of time.
 The American embassy in
 Vienna reported on 28 March
 that First Deputy Foreign
 Minister Gromyko had recently
 this Yugoslav view, and thus
 to facilitate a joint Sino-
 Soviet effort to lure Yugosla-

 spoken in a similar vein in a
 conversation with an Austrian
 Foreign Ministry official.  The
 Austrian remarked that his
 government had been encouraged
 by the fact that Molotov was
 personally dealing with the
 Austrian question, and Gromyko
 replied that this was a correct
 interpretation, since Molotov
 is the second man in the Soviet
 government.
 These strikingly similar
 comments by two Soviet diplo-
 mats, apparently offered  .
 gratuitously, seem more than
 a coincidence.
 The Soviet government has
 shown itself sensitive to
 Western reactions to its leader-
 ship problems and eager to
 forestall conjecture about inter-
 necine conflicts.  The stress
 on Molotov's importance, there-
 fore, may be designed to counter-
 act recent press speculation
 concerning his status.
 The diplomats' remarks
 seem, however, to have gone
 further than this objective
 alone would have required, and
 it is unlikely that such con-
 fident claims would have
 been made on Molotov's behalf

 Problems of the Hungarian
 Leadership
 Hungarian party leader
 Rakosi's attempt to oust Pre-
 mier Nagy, who was condemned
 on 4 March by the party cen-
 tral committee for "rightist
 deviation," has resulted in
 increased dissension within
 the party.  Rakosi is having
 difficulty asserting his
 authority, but he is not likely
 to lose control of the party.
 Rakosi reportedly was able
 to force an anti-Nagy resolu-
 tion through the party central
 committee meeting on 4 March
 only by throwing his full
 weight and the support of
 Moscow behind it.  He has not
 yet been able to oust Nagy,
 because the premier has con-
 siderable support in the party
 and because Moscow wants to
 avoid giving the impression
 that a struggle for personal
 power is being waged.
 Nagy reportedly continues
 to refuse to resign or recant.
 He also would not appear before
 the central committee meeting
 and sent letters defending his
 position to all committee mem-
 bers except Rakosi.
 The confusion which has
 hamstrung the party leadership
 throughout the new course
 period apparently continues.
 The central committee
 meeting, which was designed to
 firm up party policy, has only
 served to accentuate internal
 party differences.
 In an effort to overcome
 this confusion and unite the
 party leadership, Rakosi re-
 cently spoke to two meetings
 of local party leaders and
 minimized the economic dif-
 ferences between the March
 resolutions and the policy
 pursued under the Nagy govern-
 ment.
 Local party committee
 elections are being held, and
 national conferences of public
 prosecutors and of district
 party secretaries are being
 convened, apparently in an
 effort to weed out or intimi-
 date Nagy supporters in the
 party.
 Rakosi and other party
 :leaders have also tried to
 placate the hostile peasantry,
 which took the central committee
 resolutions to mean the end of
 new course "liberalism."
 While specifying that
 "voluntary" collectivization
 will continue, Rakosi has
 emphasized the need for winning
 the co-operation of private
 farmers, who cultivate approx-
 imately 70 percent of the
 arable land.  Rakosi and other
 leaders have also tried to
 allay rumors that the free
 agricultural market world be
 abandoned and that the pro-
 duction of consumers' goods
 would be shay l  curtailed.

 consideration of the "desira-

 The Laotian government is
 continuing its efforts to nego-
 tiate a settlement with the
 Communist-backed Pathets and
 has gone so far as to concede
 them the right to select a
 governor for one of the two
 disputed northern provinces.
 The latter development
 comes in the face of Pathet

 The Pathets have, moreover,

 The organization speaks
 optimistically of provisions for
 $112,000,000 to $140,000,000
 trade each way annually.        This
 contrasts sharply with the
 government's maximum estimate
 of $40,000,000 to $50,000,000
 each way and suggests a plan
 to include embargoed trade for
 political purposes.
 Since the Communists
 staged their row in Hong Kong
 last week over the wording of
 their visas, more and more of
 the larger firms are refusing
 to associate themselves with
 the negotiations or allow
 their factories to be "in-
 spected" by the delegation.
 The firms are becoming more and
 more convinced that the prime
 purpose of the visit is propa-
 ganda, and they are afraid to
 endanger their relations with
 the United States.

 the middle of May.     By that
 time, the triennial elections
 to a new national assembly,
 now scheduled to convene on 4
 May, should have been completed
 and a legislature satisfactory
 to the winning group installed.
 By mid-May, too, nomadic
 Afghan tribes should be on
 their way to relatively inac-

 policy-making tribal assembly.
 Syria
 Although the Syrian gov-
 ernment agreed "in principle"
 on 2 March to sign the Arab
 pact proposed by Egypt as an
 answer to the Turkish-Iraqi
 defense agreement, Foreign
 Minister Azm is now having
 second thoughts..   Iraqi bland-
 ishments, Turkish psychological
 warfare, and Western demarches
 apparently have led the Syrians
 to seek to modify the Egyptian
 proposals so as to meet Iraq's
 and Turkey's major objections.
 The effect of these pres-
 sures also has been to weaken
 the pro-Egyptian .Azm and to
 strengthen Prime Minister
 Asali, whom some pro-Iraqi
 Syrians are now supporting
 for lack of a better leader.
 Regardless of shifts
 which may occur in the Kabul
 power structure, the royal
 oligarchy will almost cer-
 tainly continue in power.   As
 a result of the current re-
 assessments in Kabul, however,
 Afghanistan is likely to be
 inclined to accept less Soviet
 aid in the future.
 Azm is said to have lost
 some of his army support to
 Asali.  Azm and his remaining
 army supporters are also re-
 ported to be veering away from
 the anti-Western, extremist
 Arab Socialist-Resurrectionist
 Party, which strongly favors
 the pact with Egypt.
 On the other hand, Asali
 has asked Britain and the United
 States to support Syria's ef-
 forts in Cairo to have the pact
 modified to make Iraq's in-
 elusion possible.
 The Syrian cabinet is un-
 likely to last long even if it
 survives the immediate crisis.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 March 1955
 British Adherence
 To Turkish-Iraqi Pact
 Iraq's and Britain's
 agreement to replace the Anglo-
 Iraqi treaty of 1930 by a new
 accord and Britain's decision
 to adhere to the Turkish-
 Iraqi defense pact, announced
 on 30 March, strengthen Middle
 Eastern stability.
 This action puts Anglo-
 Iraqi relations on a basis
 consistent with Iraqi sover-
 eignty and therefore takes
 much of the force out of the
 local nationalists' denuncia-
 tion of the 1930 treaty as
 "Western imperialism."
 British adherence to the
 Turkish-Iraqi pact will make
 that treaty significantly more
 effective.  Moreover, Iraq's
 alignment with Turkey and
 Britain may reduce Israel's
 fear of hostile action by
 Baghdad.
 Plotting Against Nicaraguan
 Government
 Plotting against Nicaraguan
 president Somoza appears to
 have intensified in the past
 two months.  Hostile activities
 among exile groups and the
 domestic opposition can be ex-
 pected to increase further with
 the approach of the presidential
 elections scheduled for late
 1956.
 Somoza, strong man in
 Nicaragua since 1934, appears
 to be preparing to succeed him-
 self in office.  He enjoys wide-
 spread personal popularity and
 apparently retains the loyalty
 of the National Guard, the
 country's only armed force, but
 his opposition is bitter and
 desperate.
 Anti-Somoza Nicaraguan
 exiles, now concentrated in
 El Salvador, Honduras, and
 Mexico, have engaged in several
 plots to oust Somoza in re-
 cent years.
 Some of the Nicaraguan
 exiles were subjected to

 their stay in Guatemala under
 the pro-Communist Arbenz regime.

 It is unlikely that the
 exiles will be able to obtain

 Even Somoza's bitter en-

 Figueres, is unlikely to risk
 compromising his domestic and

 The governments of El

 would dissociate themselves
 from any anti-Somoza movement.
 Somoza's death or ouster

 Oil Discovery Stirs Optimism
 In Brazil
 The recent discovery of
 oil at Nova Olinda in the
 Amazon region of Brazil has
 roused Brazilian hopes that
 the country will eventually be
 relieved of its heavy petroleum
 import burden.
 Heretofore, Brazil has had
 to import almost all its oil.
 In 1954, petroleum imports used
 up 45 percent of the total
 convertible currency earned by
 Brazilian exports.  This has
 been a major factor in the
 country's serious economic
 difficulties.
 The Nova Olinda strike is
 in a vast sedimentary basin in
 which the existence of oil had
 been only conjectured.   The
 area is believed to contain
 sizable reserves.  Further
 discoveries are expected, and
 the head of Petrobras, the
 Brazilian government petroleum
 monopoly, has even predicted
 that Brazil might be self-
 sufficient in oil in three
 years.
 This prediction is overly
 optimistic.  Brazil's average
 daily consumption of petroleum
 products in 1954 was at least
 155,000 barrels.  Even under
 the most favorable conditions,
 production on this scale could
 be reached only with substan-
 tial foreign. capital.
 Brazil's petroleum leg-
 islation is monopolistic,
 however, and Petrobras alone
 does not have the resources to
 produce the petroleum that the
 country's expanding economy
 demands.

 The circumstances sur-
 rounding Malenkov's fall
 provide many clues as to the
 general policy orientation of
 the present Soviet leadership.
 The February political
 crisis in Moscow involved a
 number of separate but closely
 interrelated factors, no one
 of which alone provides an
 adequate explanation of the
 change of leaders or the
 accompanying shifts in emphasis
 in Soviet policy.
 The basic elements in this
 complex pattern of events sug-
 gest that Malenkov's "resig-
 nation" on 8 February came as
 the result of a many-sided
 conflict with Party First
 Secretary Khrushchev.
 The conflict reached a
 critical intensity because
 Malenkov and Khrushchev in the
 preceding year had pinned their
 political fortunes to divergent
 policies in a variety of fields
 affecting the long-term develop-
 ment of Soviet economic and
 military strength.  These dis-
 agreements were resolved in
 Khrushchev's favor by the
 time of the Communist Party
 central committee meeting in
 January.
 Thus far, however, Khru-
 shchev is not exercising
 absolute power in the Stalin
 tradition.  He seems, rather,
 to have acquired a primary
 position among Soviet policy
 makers because his views
 reflect the current weight of
 opinion in this top circle.
 A pervasive aspect of the
 conflict between Malenkov and
 Khrushchev was the apparent
 divergence in their attitudes
 toward the international
 situation.  This applied
 particularly to the degree of
 danger to the USSR from
 "capitalist encirclement" and
 the most advantageous posture
 for the USSR to assume in
 defense and diplomacy in the
 next two or three years.
 During the period of his
 political ascendancy in 1953,
 Malenkov became the main
 official spokesman for the
 view that it was both necessary
 and feasible to lessen the
 intensity of the cold war with
 the West at least for a few
 years.  This relaxation was
 to be achieved by bringing the
 Korean war to an end and
 moderating the aggressive manner
 in which the USSR under Stalin
 had conducted diplomatic
 relations.
 In the long run, Malenkov
 must have reasoned, the USSR
 would be better off if it
 markedly eased the pressure on
 the Western coalition, thus
 allowing divisive forces to
 come into full play in the
 West and giving the USSR a
 chance to build up Soviet
 strength for the long haul.
 Malenkov apparently
 believed that the country's
 most pressing problems were
 internal, and that they con-
 sisted of the slowdown of
 industrial growth since 1950,
 the stagnation of agriculture
 at pre-World War II levels,
 and the general apathy of the
 Soviet population.  The cam-
 paign to relax international
 tensions evidently was designed
 to allow the Soviet Union to
 halt the further growth of
 defense expenditures for
 several years and to devote
 more resources to alleviating
 imbalances in the economy.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 March- 1955
 The "New Course"
 Domestically, the Malenkov
 view manifested itself in the
 "new course," a program empha-
 sizing an "upsurge" in the
 production of consumers' goods
 and agricultural output.   Since
 heavy industrial investment and
 output were to maintain their
 rapid rates of growth, fulfill-
 ment of the consumer welfare
 aspects of the "new course"
 required a sharp leveling off
 of defense expenditures, which
 actually occurred in 1953 and
 1954.
 The Malenkov regime
 apparently intended no sub-
 stantial increase in defense
 outlays at least through 1956.
 Mikoyan, indeed, strongly
 implied in a speech made in
 October 1953 that the same
 general policy of expansion of
 output of consumers' goods and
 agricultural products would
 continue through the next five-
 year plan to 1960.
 In 1953 all the Soviet
 leaders apparently subscribed
 to the view that international
 tension could be reduced suffi-
 ciently--without major Soviet
 concessions--to allow the USSR
 safely to sacrifice short-term
 increases in military strength
 to longer-range economic growth:
 In fact, they still adhere to
 the more general outlines of
 this hypothesis, and some of
 them may think of themselves
 as merely making certain
 modifications or adjustments
 within the general framework
 of post-Stalin policy.
 On the other hand, some
 Soviet leaders--particularly
 Khrushchev--seem in the past
 year to have grown increasingly
 out of sympathy with Malenkov's
 attitude toward the inter-
 national situation.
 Khrushchev on several
 occasions in the past year
 revealed a basic attitude
 fundamentally more pessimistic
 than Malenkov's concerning
 conflict with the Western nations,
 and seemed more inclined to
 rely on threats instead of
 negotiations to protect Soviet
 interests in connection with key
 international issues such as
 German rearmament.   In informal
 discussions with foreign diplo-
 mats, he sometimes displayed a
 harsh attitude toward the West,
 on some occasions only to have
 his comments repudiated by
 Malenkov.   Khrushchev made a
 bellicose speech in Prague in
 June 1954, which later appeared
 in the Soviet press substantially
 modified and softened.
 Military Preparedness
 Khrushchev evidently found
 it increasingly difficult to
 reconcile himself to all aspects
 of the "relaxation of tensions"
 policy.  Undoubtedly supported.
 .by Soviet military leaders, he
 apparently decided that the
 USSR must keep its short-term
 military preparedness growing
 at a reasonably high rate in
 .order to support Soviet foreign
 policy in the political con-
 flicts with the West in the
 next year or two.
 Bulganin, speaking at the
 parade on the anniversary of
 the revolution last November,
 stated that "no such changes"
 had as yet occurred in the
 international situation "as
 would give us grounds to lessen
 in any measure our attention
 to questions of strengthening
 our defense capability."
 Khrushchev's sense of
 urgency over the immediacy of
 the need for increased military
 preparedness may be inferred
 from the emphasis which he and
 his supporters have placed on
 defense, by the appointment of
 Bulganin as premier, the advance-
 ment of Zhukov and a number of
 other professional military
 officers, the stress on East
 European security measures

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 March 1955
 required to counter German re-
 armament, and the attention
 given at the time of Malenkov's
 fall to the need for increasing
 state reserves--i.e., stockpiles
 of raw materials, industrial
 articles, and food.
 The new emphasis on mili-
 tary strength is discernible
 in the Soviet budget for 1955,
 which reflects a major departure
 from the thinking implicit in
 the 1953 "new course" plan revi-
 sion.
 Malenkov's official views
 on the dangers of nuclear war-
 fare also have been reversed by
 the new regime.  Malenkov stated
 in a speech in March 1954 that
 an atomic war could well mean
 the end of modern civilization.
 This concept has since been
 explicitly rejected in favor of
 the dogma that an atomic war
 would result only in the de-
 struction of the capitalist
 world.
 The conflict of policies
 apparently reached its height
 in the period of energetic
 East-West diplomacy in the
 second half of 1954.
 This period began with the
 Indochina settlement arranged
 at the Geneva conference.  The
 Communist acquisition of control
 over half of Indochina and the
 collapse of the European Defense
 Community concept about a month
 later may have seemed victories
 for the Malenkov technique of
 conducting foreign affairs.
 If so, the fruits of vic-
 tory soured somewhat as a re-
 sult of the rapid Western re-
 covery of the diplomatic initi-
 ative in Europe and continued
 Western progress toward German
 rearmament in another form.
 Furthermore, tensions in
 the Far East began almost imme-
 diately to rise sharply as the
 result of Communist China's
 "liberate Formosa" campaign.
 Chou En-lai went to Moscow in
 July 1954 and almost certainly
 discussed the Formosan issue
 with Soviet leaders.
 Both Khrushchev and Bul-
 ganin shortly made a ceremonial
 visit to Peiping in connection
 with the revision of the Sino-
 Soviet treaty and must then
 have formed a realistic estimate
 of the magnitude of the economic
 effort involved in the "support"
 of China promised on behalf of
 the Soviet people.
 Khrushchev openly criti-
 cized Malenkov on the occasion
 of a recent interview with the
 Indonesian ambassador, accord-
 ing to information received by
 Ambassador Bohlen.  Among the
 major complaints cited against
 the former premier, Khrushchev
 mentioned that his foreign
 policy had not been "firm"
 enough on China.
 The Dispute over Agriculture
 The most protracted open
 policy disagreements between
 Khrushchev and Malenkov centered
 on competing plans for the
 improvement of agriculture.
 Malenkov emphasized the
 need for increasing crop yields
 in the traditional agricultural
 areas.  He embraced the idea of
 incentives for the rural popu-
 lation, calling for an increase
 in delivery prices and a
 reduction in procurement norms
 and monetary taxes, as well as
 increased output of consumers'
 goods.
 He seemed to regard major
 increases in labor productivity
 --to be obtained through high
 rates of investment in tradi-
 tional cultivated areas and
 through inducement rather than
 coercion of the peasantry--as
 the best means of increasing
 the contribution of agriculture
 to the nation's long-range in-
 dustrial and military potential.
 When the results of the
 1953 harvest were compiled, it

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 March 1955
 must have become known that
 production of most crops and
 most species of livestock had
 failed to reach prewar levels.
 Acreage sown to food crops had
 been less than one percent
 larger than in 1940, and yields
 of most crops had failed to in-
 crease at all.  Production of
 major food crops, such as grain
 and potatoes, fell below the
 previous year because of ad-
 verse weather conditions, and
 livestock numbers increased
 only slightly.
 At this point, it seems
 likely that Khrushchev, and
 probably some of his colleagues,
 became more convinced than be-
 fore that the process of stim-
 ulating production through in-
 tensive investment in tradi-
 tional areas and through con-
 cessions and incentives would
 be too slow.  They probably
 persuaded the majority of party
 leaders that it would be more
 sensible to make major addition-
 al efforts to expand the sown
 area.
 Early in 1954, Khrushchev
 introduced the "new lands" pro-
 gram which, by 1956, is sup-
 posed to result in an increase
 in the grain acreage of 70-74
 million acres, an area equal to
 the total sown acreage of Canada.
 This is a risky program aimed
 at rapid, short-term benefits,
 since most of the new lands are
 likely to suffer an almost com-
 plete crop failure on the average
 of two out of every five years.
 Malenkov's resistance to
 the "new lands" concept may have
 succeeded temporarily.   At the
 central committee plenum in
 June 1954, Khrushchev's partici-
 pation was noticeably lacking,
 and the plenum decreed new con-
 cessions to the grain farmers
 along the lines advocated by
 Malenkov.
 The situation was reversed
 when it became evident that a
 severe drought would plague the
 principal grain-producing
 regions, leaving the "new
 lands" area to save the day
 by bringing 1954 agricultural
 production slightly above the
 level of 1953.   In the face of
 a 10-percent rise of population
 since 1938, however,agricultural
 production was only 3 percent
 higher in 1954 than in 1938.
 In January 1955, the
 cantral committee issued
 another major decree on agri-
 culture, which may have provided
 a final point of argument over
 this subject within the leader-
 ship.  This decree not only
 reaffirmed the "new lands"
 program to expand wheat pro-
 duction, but set forth another
 grandiose plan to increase corn
 acreage sevenfold in the USSR
 by 1960.
 Malenkov may well have
 opposed this program as ex-
 pensive and unfeasible, since
 the combination of soil and
 weather favorable for corn
 growing is simply not available
 in most of the USSR.
 These two parallel agri-
 cultural programs were largely
 competitive in terms of ad-
 ministrative effort and in-
 dustrial resources, and a
 choice between them for major
 emphasis was bound to have a
 substantial effect on other
 sectors of the economy.
 The 1953 program empha-
 sized increased incentives for
 intensified cultivation of
 already settled lands and was
 specifically dependent on
 increased production of durable
 consumers' goods.   If agricul-
 tural buying power were to be
 increased in this way, con-
 sumers' goods must be made
 available to absorb that in-
 crease, unless it was to be
 drawn off through currency
 reforms or forced savings pro-
 grams, which would defeat the
 morale-lifting purpose of the
 program.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 March 1955
 On the other hand, the 1954
 virgin lands program required
 additional farm machinery and
 thus priority emphasis on heavy
 industry.
 Heavy vs. Consumers'  Industry
 Both the dispute over
 military preparedness and the
 dispute over a.+*ri.niilture prob-
 ably lay beneath the surface
 oz the somewhat cryptic debate
 over heavy industry versus con-
 sumers' goods--the issue on
 which open disagreement appeared
 in the Moscow press shortly be-
 fore Malenkov's resignation.
 It was the principal public
 controversy reflecting the
 existence of two schools of
 thought in the Soviet ruling
 group.
 At the very time that this
 issue was being considered in
 Moscow in connection with the
 1955 budget and advance planning
 for the 1956-1960 five-year
 plan, some of the European
 Satellites--particularly
 Hungary--were providing vivid
 examples of the administrative
 confusion, industrial slippage,
 and political demoralization
 that could result from attempts
 to implement the "new course"
 economic policy.
 The appearance of the
 light industry-heavy industry
 disagreement in the Soviet
 press may have reflected a last
 attempt by Malenkov to salvage
 at least some of his program
 by opposing the new military
 expenditures and insisting that
 increased distribution of con-
 sumers' goods to the rural
 areas was still essential for
 increased agricultural pro-
 duction, despite the "new
 lands" program.   If so, his
 continued resistance to the
 general Khrushchev line prob-
 ably forced the showdown that
 resulted in his resignation.
 Personal and Political Rivalry
 Personal and political
 rivalry between Malenkov and
 Khrushchev in the course of
 the past year became thoroughly
 fused with their policy dis-
 agreements.
 Hints of some sort of
 political friction appeared as
 far back as the 19th Party
 Congress in October 1952.   At
 that time, Malenkov, in his
 major address to the congress,
 appeared to go out of his way
 to remind his audience that
 "certain of our leading offi-
 cials" had been wrong in their
 efforts to amalgamate small
 collective farms into col-
 lective farm towns or "agrogo-
 rods."  This seemingly gratui-
 tous remark--made more than a
 year after the policy had been
 abandoned--must certainly have
 been aimed at Khrushchev, the
 only top official publicly as-
 sociated with this policy.
 It is not surprising
 therefore, that the sins to
 which Khrushchev forced Malen-
 kov to confess were agricul-
 tural, or that the first count
 which he cited to the Indo-
 nesian ambassador was Malen-
 kov's maladministration of
 economic matters--both as to
 policy and execution.
 Khrushchev may not have
 been personally responsible,
 but he benefited immensely
 from the March 1953 action of
 the Soviet leaders--probably
 led by "Old Bolsheviks" Molo-
 tov, Bulganin, and Kaganovich--
 in nipping in the bud Malen-
 kov's campaign to succeed to
 Stalin's full power and majesty.
 Malenkov surrendered his
 post as principal Communist
 Party secretary, the job that
 Stalin had parlayed into ab-
 solute authority over the USSR,
 but retained the role of chair-
 man of the Council of Ministers.
 He then attempted to increase
 the authority of that body,
 which his loss of the party
 secretaryship forced him to
 rely on as his base of power.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Khrushchev, confirmed as
 first secretary of the party
 in September 1953, chose the
 central committee and the
 party apparatus as his source
 of strength.   It is of interest
 that one of the complaints
 against the defeated premier
 which he voiced in his out-
 spoken conversation with the
 Indonesian ambassador was that
 Malenkov had attempted to run
 the government through bureau-
 crats rather than through party
 representatives.
 Personnel Appointments
 The strategies and chang-
 ing fortunes of the two rivals
 are reflected in the careers
 of various members of their
 factions.
 For example, in March
 1953, when Malenkov was pro-
 ceeding with his plan for
 strengthening the government
 as against the party, he ap-
 pointed some of his close.as-
 sociates--Saburov, Malyshev,
 Pervukhin--to head the con-
 solidated economic ministries,
 and Kozlov was transferred from
 the party apparatus to head the
 government Ministry of Agri-
 culture.
 At the central committee
 plenum in February 1954, Khru-
 shchev criticized the opera-
 tions of the Gosplan, over
 which Saburov presided, and
 personally attacked Kozlov,
 who was then minister of state
 farms.
 At  the plenum in June
 1954, when Malenkov appeared
 to have gained the advantage,
 no accusations were leveled at
 Kozlov.
 The attack against him
 was resumed at the plenum in
 January 1955, and on 4 March
 he was removed from office
 for "failure to cope with the
 work."
 A number of old Khrushchev
 associates have been promoted
 or reinstated after having
 being demoted at the 1952
 Party Congress, when Malenkov
 appeared to be controlling
 personnel appointments.   It
 also seems likely that the
 great increase ii personal
 publicity accorded Knrushchev--
 sometimes at Malenkov's ex-
 pense--since the Beria purge,
 must have contributed to
 weakening the positions of
 Malenkov's followers and to
 persuading some of them that
 it would be wiser to join the
 opposition.
 Malenkov's youth in com-
 parison to the "Old Bolsheviks"
 on the presidium, his rapid
 political rise, his role in
 the purges of the 1930's, and
 his personal influence with
 Stalin probably were sources
 of antagonism or resentment.
 These older members of
 the leadership group may also
 have felt that Malenkov went
 too far in the explicit re-
 pudiation by his regime of the
 excesses of the Stalin era,
 especially in such domestic
 political issues as police
 terror and rigid control over
 the arts, sciences and re-
 ligion.  The difference here
 was almost certainly only a
 matter of degree.   Neverthe-
 less, even a small difference
 of opinion in this domestic
 field would be likely to arouse
 strong feelings, since the
 personal security of every
 member of the leadership would
 be at stake.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PEIPING CAMPAIGNS TO BELITTLE NUCLEAR WARFARE IN EYES OF CHINESE
 Chinese Communist propa-
 ganda against the use of nu-
 clear weapons has increased
 greatly in the past two months,
 and a program for indoctrinat-
 ing the population on the ef-
 fects of such weapons has been
 launched.
 Peiping apparently calcu-
 lates that its action could
 lead to the employment of nu-
 clear weapons against the main-
 land.
 The Peiping regime initi-
 ated  a limited program of
 troop indoctrination on the
 atom bomb in the fall of 1950
 during the Korean war, but
 only this year has there been
 a mass indoctrination of the
 civilian population on this
 subject.  A series of lectures
 to familiarize the Chinese
 civilian population with the
 effects of nuclear weapons was
 begun late in February.
 Unlike the earlier troop
 indoctrination, recent propa-
 ganda has not attempted to
 persuade the populace that the
 United States will not use nu-
 clear weapons.   It has tended
 instead to minimize the de-
 structive power of such
 weapons.
 The propaganda alleges,
 for example, that "China's
 population and industries are
 not highly concentrated," and
 that for China "the destructive
 effects of atomic bombs can
 hardly create any serious or
 practical threat."
 Peiping's propaganda con-
 cedes that a hydrogen bomb is
 more powerful than an atomic
 bomb.   It asserts, however,
 that neither bomb is as power-
 ful as the "American imperial-
 ists"'   laim.  A person de-
 scribed as "China's foremost
 nuclear physicist," who wit-
 nessed the test at Bikini
 Atoll   in 1946 as a Chinese
 Nationalist representative,
 now claims that he saw "only
 two waves rise on the sea near-
 by. ,if
 The current propaganda
 campaign cites an "appeal" of
 the Communist World Peace
 Council `WPC) issued in Jan-
 uary.  The  appeal" calls for
 a ban on the manufacture and
 use of nuclear weapons.
 Campaign activities have
 begun all over the world.  A
 collection of signatures to
 the appeal is under way in the
 Sino-Soviet bloc and in sev-
 eral countries of the free
 world.
 The Communists claim that
 300,000,000 persons had signed
 the appeal by 20 March.  This
 is 50,000,000 more than the
 Communists claimed signed the
 "Stockholm Peace Appeal" in
 1950.
 Apart from Peiping's in-
 terest in co-ordinating its
 propaganda campaign with the
 WPC's effort, the Chinese Com-
 munists are showing that the
 issue of nuclear warfare is of
 immediate concern to them.
 In reaffirming Peiping's
 intention to "liberate" Na-
 tionalist-held territory, Chi-
 nese Communist propagandists
 have frequently cited American
 efforts to "intimidate" the
 Chinese and have exhorted the
 people to stand firm.
 One typical statement is
 that "those who seek to occupy
 Taiwan...are also the chief
 instigators in the preparation
 of atomic war."  Another is
 that "the American imperialists
 are clamoring for the use of
 atomic weapons against China,
 hoping thus to frighten the
 Chinese people into submission."
 In this connection  Chou
 En-lai reportedly told
 hat he expected war.    e
 is said to have added that nu-
 clear weapons might kill

 100,000,000 Chinese but that
 there would still be 500,000,-
 000 left.
 The objectives of allay-
 ing domestic anxiety and de-
 terring an American attack
 have been pursued primarily
 by stressing Soviet strength.
 "Explanations" which min-
 imize the possible effects of
 nuclear weapons have also been
 employed to ease popular appre-
 hension.  The effort to mo-
 bilize "international opinion"
 has been aimed at making it
 politically costly for the
 United States to launch a nu-
 clear weapons attack.
 The signature collection
 campaign in Communist China was
 begun on 14 February, the fifth
 anniversary of the signing of
 the Sino-Soviet treaty.  The
 Chinese Communists clearly
 chose the moment when their
 propaganda could most easily
 exploit the theme of Soviet
 strength as a deterrent to
 American use of nuclear weap-
 ons against the Chinese main-
 land.
 Peiping's comments on nu-
 clear weapons seem appropriate
 to a nation which has none.
 Whereas Soviet propaganda has
 explicitly stated that the
 Soviet Union has nuclear weap-
 ons with which it would re-
 taliate in kind against an
 American attack, Chinese Com-
 munist commentators have made
 no such claims for China.   In-
 stead, Peiping has stressed
 Soviet strength, suggesting
 that the USSR's alliance with.
 China is acting to deter those
 who might wish to attack Peiping.
 The most aggressive pub-
 lic statement of this kind
 came. from Mao Tse-tung himself
 at a party given by the Soviet
 chargd on 14 February.
 Mao declared that, "with
 the great co-operation between
 China and the Soviet Union,
 there are no aggressive plans
 of imperialism which cannot
 be smashed."  He added, "Should
 the imperialists. start a war
 of aggression, we, together
 with the people of the whole
 world, will certainly wipe
 them from the face of the
 earth."
 Mao is reported to have
 m erica a  aiml i nr remark  to the
 the United States
 were  o use the "atom bomb,"
 then "we will wipe out the
 United States and then dispose
 of the American leaders."
 most certainly used  a   er-
 ately by Mao as a channel to
 the West, and similar state-
 ments from Chinese Communist
 leaders are expected through
 other channels.
 -Mao's language, and Chi-
 nese Communist propaganda along
 the same lines, have been in-
 terpreted by some observers as
 showing that Mao is confident
 the USSR would retaliate in
 kind in the event of an attack
 with nuclear weapons on Com-
 munist China.
 In this connection, Peng
 Te-huai, Peiping's minister of
 defense, boasted at the Soviet
 army day celebration in Port
 Arthur on 23 February that
 if Communist China is attacked,
 "our countries will support
 each other at all times."
 Moreover, Ambassador
 Bohlen reports Khrushchev has
 stated to the Indonesian am-
 bassador that if Communist China
 were "attacked," the Soviet
 Union would honor its 1950
 treaty.  Khrushchev did not,
 however, make it clear what
 he meant by "attack."
 It is not known whether
 Peiping has been given a Soviet
 promise to retaliate with nu-
 clear weapons.   In any case,
 the leaders of the Peiping
 regime are apparently anxious
 to make the United States be-
 lieve that such a Soviet com-
 mitment exists.

 PROSPECTS FOR A COMMUNIST-NENNI SOCIALIST SPLIT
 There are growing signs
 of restiveness within the Ital-
 ian Nenni Socialist Party (PSI)
 over the party's continued
 subservience to Communist con-
 trol.
 The possibility of an
 actual break between the Com-
 munists and the PSI is attract-
 ing increasing interest in
 Italy, and the question may
 be thrashed out at the PSI
 national congress opening in
 Turin on 31 March.
 Some reports have stated
 that any ostensible break be-
 tween the PSI and the Communists
 would be only a maneuver having
 no effect on their unity-of-
 action pact.   Such a break,
 however, whether real or purely
 tactical, would increase the
 chances of Nenni Socialist sup-
 port of, and eventual partici-
 pation in, the Italian govern-
 ment.
 There has been increasing
 evidence in recent months that
 a substantial number of Nenni
 Socialists, at both the national
 and local levels, want to get
 out from under Communist con-
 trol.  Party leaders have shown
 annoyance as well as apprehen-
 sion over the PSI's continued
 dependence on the Communist
 Party for financial aid.
 At least some Nenni Social-
 ist leaders also seem to resent
 what they consider a subordina-
 tion of the workers' interests
 to the policy considerations of
 their party's stronger ally.
 Nenni has never, however,
 reversed his public position,
 reiterated as recently as
 February, that his party's ties
 with the Communists through
 their unity-of-action pact are
 as strong as ever.
 ,, The PSI, in fact, may _
 mer.eliy want to give the
 impression of a split from the
 Communists in order to attract
 greater electoral support for
 Nenni or to entice the Christian
 Democrats into accepting Nenni
 Socialist co-operation in a
 new government formula.
 On the other hand, the
 PSI may be seeking, through a
 demonstration of independence,
 to develop sufficient electoral
 support to justify a real split
 with the Communists.
 The Communists, if they
 attempt to engineer a simulated
 break, will run the risk of
 actually losing their hold on
 the Nenni Socialists.  This will
 probably cause the Communists
 to try to obstruct Socialist
 co-operation with the govern-
 ment,
 Furthermore, in the event
 of a Nenni Socialist-Communist
 split, the ensuing isolation
 forced on the Communists,
 particularly if followed by an
 increase in the strength of
 Nenni's party among the work-
 ing classes, would greatly re-
 duce the Communists' popular
 appeal as advocates of consti-
 tutional measures in the fight
 for better living standards.
 Most leaders of the par-
 ties in the present coalition
 government are aware that their
 domestic objectives are similar
 to those long urged by Nenni.
 They realize, moreover, that
 the shaky Scelba cabinet's days
 may be numbered.  These factors
 might induce the Christian
 Democrats to accept Nenni So-
 cialist support of a new left-
 of-center government provided
 Nenni's price is not too high.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The government received a
 substantial vote of confidence
 in parliament on 23 March, but
 the increasingly frequent
 clashes of interests in the
 Scelba coalition will make its
 road more and more difficult
 in the coming months.
 A fall of the Scelba cabi-
 net might discredit the four-
 party formula once and for all
 and compel the Christian Demo-
 crats to look to either the
 left or the right for support
 to maintain a parliamentary
 majority.
 Despite contrary pressure
 from the small but influential
 right wing of the Christian
 Democratic Party, the forma-
 tion of a left-center govern-
 ment supported by Nenni appears
 to be at least a 50-50 possi-
 bility.
 The Christian Democrats'
 national council has voted
 against co-operation with the
 Monarchists and other rightist
 groups, and the party is domi-
 nated by its left wing under
 party secretary Amintore Fan-
 fani, who aspires to be pre-
 mier.
 A coalition made up of
 the Christian Democrats, Demo-
 cratic Socialists and Repub-
 licans, with Nenni Socialist
 support and perhaps eventual
 participation, would give the
 government a substantially
 greater parliamentary majority
 than any has enjoyed since.the
 end of World War II.
 Pronouncements by Nenni
 during the past six months
 suggest that growing numbers
 of Nenni Socialists are pre-
 pared to take advantage of the
 first opportunity that would
 permit them to support the
 government.
 In October 1954; Nenni
 indicated that his party would
 fully support a government
 "inspired by the Christian
 Democratic left wing" which
 would combine Christian Demo-
 cratic and Socialist demands
 for social reform.
 On 20 February Nenni de-
 clared that the PSI, rather
 than see democratic institu-
 tions in Italy weakened by a
 Christian Democratic surrender
 to pressure from the right,
 would support the Christian
 Democrats even if this meant
 losing the votes his party
 might gain as a result of a
 popular reaction against a
 rightist government.
 Nenni's own intentions, in
 the event he offered to sup-
 port a new government, could
 be tested only by performance.
 Nenni Socialist support would
 probably be based on an arrange-
 ment under which the party would
 agree to modify its opposition

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 March 1955
 to the government's foreign
 policy in return for a pledge
 by the latter  to meet most of
 Nenni's demands in the domestic
 field.
 An indication of what
 Nenni's party would expect in
 foreign relations was given in
 the PSI paper Avanti: in Feb-
 ruary.  The paper stated that
 the Nenni Socialists do not
 seek abrogation of existing
 alliances, but rather neutrality
 for Italy and a policy of de-
 tente between East and West.
 While Nenni Socialist
 support of the government would
 probably weaken Italy's role
 in Western defense planning,
 and might increase Communist
 penetration of the bureaucracy,
 it would also make it possible
 to put into effect the social
 and economic reforms which the
 government has long planned
 but has hitherto been unable
 to implement.  This in itself
 would cut the ground from
 under the Communist Party in
 Italy.
