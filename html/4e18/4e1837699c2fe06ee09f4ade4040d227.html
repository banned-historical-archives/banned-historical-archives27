1964 CONGRESSIONAL' RECORD ? SENATE 11015 
CHAPTER 3?MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
Sgc. 303. Chapter 3 of part III of the For-
eign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 
which relates to miscellaneous provisions, is 
amended by adding at the end thereof the 
following new section: 
"SEC. 648. SPECIAL AUTHORIZATION FOR tTSE 
'OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES.--SUbjeCt to the pro-
visions of section 1415 of the Supplemental 
Appropriation Act, 1953, the President is 
authorized, as a demonstration of good will 
on the part of the people of the United 
States for the Polish and Italian people, to 
use foreign currencies accruing to the 'United 
States Government under this or any other 
Act, for assistance on such terms and con-
ditions as he may specify, in the repair, 
rehabilitation, improvement, and mainte-
nance Of cemeteries in Italy serving as the 
burial place of members of the armed forces 
of Poland who died in combat in Italy during 
World War II." 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, 
there will be no action taken on the bill 
this evening. 
Mr. MORSE, Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. 
Mr. MORSE. I think the Senator will 
probably make the same statement a 
week from tonight. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Very likely. 
Mr. MORSE. However, that is not 
what I rose to tell the Senator from Mon-
tana. If it is the desire of the Senator 
from Montana from time to time to lay 
aside the amendment to the Foreign As-
sistance Act of 1961 for the purpose of 
considering various problems as they 
arise, I want him to know that he will 
have my complete cooperation in agree-
ing to lay aside the bill at any time he 
wishes to do so. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I must say that / 
am surprised and delighted. 
CIVILIAN 'EMPLOYMENT OF RE-
TIRED MEMBERS OF THE 'UNI-
FORMED SERVICES 
Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask 
that the Chair lay before the Senate a 
message from the House of Representa-
tives. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the House of Representatives: 
Resolved, That the House concur in the 
amendments of the Senate numbered 1, 2, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to the bill (HR. 7381) enti-
tled "An Act to simplify, modernize, and 
consolidate the laws relating to the employ-
ment of civilians in more than one position 
and the laws concerning the civilian employ-
ment of retired members of the uniformed 
services, and for other purposes." 
Resolved, That the House disagree to the 
amendment of the Senate numbered 3, to 
aforesaid bill. 
Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, on 
July 23 the House of Representatives ac-
cepted the Senate version of the com-
pensation bill with one exception. The 
House struck out section 206. Of the 
nine amendments that the Senate made 
to the House bill, the House accepted 
eight, but they struck out the one sec-
tion, which is section 206, and agreed to 
carry it into conference. But now there 
will be no conferqnce. 
Mr. CARLSON. Mr. president, I be-
lieve that the action is a very happy 
solution to a very difficult problem that 
has confronted the Congress and many 
of our citizens. I sincerely hope that the 
Senate will accept the action of the 
House. 
Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, when 
the dual compensation bill was passed 
by the Senate on July 20, the Senator 
from Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS] requested 
the committee to advise him in regard 
to crediting military service for retire-
ment purposes for Members of Congress. 
I ask unanimous consent that there be 
inserted in the RECORD a letter from An-
drew E. Rudock, Director of the Bureau 
of Retirement and Insurance of the 
Civil Service Commission. I believe his 
letter is responsive to this question. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
U.S. CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, 
BUREAU OF RETIREMENT AND 
INSURANCE, 
Washington, D.C., July 24, 1964. 
Hon. RALPH W. YARBOROUGH, 
Chairman, Subcommittee on Civil Service, 
Committee on Post Office and Civil Serv-
ice, U.S. Senate. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: As you requested for 
the RECORD in connection with H.R. 7381, I 
em furnishing an explanation of how the 
Civil Service Retirement Act operates with 
respect to the crediting of military service 
in computing the annuity of a Member of 
Congress. 
The formula for computing Member an-
nuity is set forth in section 9(c) of the Re-
tirement Act (5 U.S.C. 2259(c) ). Under this 
formula, a retiring Member's basic annuity 
(subject to a maximum of 80 percent of final 
salary) consists of two parts as follows: 
Part I: 21/2 percent of "high-5" average 
salary multiplied by his years of?(a) Mem-
ber service, (b) active honorable military 
service performed during war or national 
emergency while on leave of absence from 
Congress, if he is not receiving military re-
tired pay, (c) other active honorable military 
service, not exceeding 5 years, if he is not 
receiving military retired pay, (d) congres-
sional employees service, not exceeding 15 
years: Plus?
Part II: 1% percent of "high-5" average 
salary multiplied by any years of other credit-
able Federal civilian or military service 
which, when added to years of 2% percent 
service do not exceed a total of 10 years (if 
22 percent service totals 10 years or more, 
1% percent does not operate), and 2 percent 
of average salary multplied by any remaining 
years of creditable Federal civilian or mili-
tary service not used at 2% or 1% percent. 
If the Member does not receive military 
retired pay, the formula affords him 2% per-
cent credit under part I for a limited portion 
of his active honorable military service. Any 
remaining military service not used at 2% 
percent is credited at the lower percentage 
rates provided in part H. 
If the Member does receive military re-
tired pay, the creditability of his military 
service is determined under the Retirement 
Act provisions outlined in my letter to you 
dated July 14, 1964; that is, under the same 
rules applicable to employees in general. If 
the type of retired pay received by the Mem-
ber falls under one of the exceptions not bar-
ring credit for military service, annuity credit 
for his active honorable military service is 
computed under the 1% or 2 percent steps of 
part II of the formula. If retired pay is not 
one of the accepted types, credit is of course 
barred for all of the Member's military serv-
ice. 
Sincerely yours, 
ANDREW E. RUDDOCK, 
Director. 
J`OHNSTOR. Mr. President, I 
move that the Senate recede from its 
amendment No. 3. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
question is on agreeing to the motion 
of the Senator from South Carolina. 
The motion was agreed to. 
COMMISSIONING ADDRESS FOR 
U.S.S. "JAMES MADISON" BY HON. 
THOMAS D. MORRIS 
Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, this 
week more muscle was added to one of 
America's great arms of defense when 
the James Madison, our 23d Polaris sub-
marine, was commissioned at Newport 
News. I am pleased to offer for the REC-
ORD the splendid address of the day made 
by the Honorable Thomas D. Morris, 
Assistant Secretary of Defense, Installa-
tions and Logistics, as the submarine was 
turned over to its well-trained officers 
and crewmen. 
The commissioning honored the fourth 
President of the United States, who was 
known as the master builder of the Con-
stitution and who guided the young Na-
tion through the War of 1812. 
I have personally met many of the 
officers and men who served on the 
Madison and have been tremendously 
impressed by their dedication of their 
abilities to keep America safe from 
enemy attack. Two complete crews will 
man the submarine. Comdr. Joseph L. 
Skoog, Jr., of Seattle, Wash., will com-
mand the blue crew, and Comdr. James 
D. Kearny, of Washington, D.C., will 
command the gold crew. The James 
Madison was launched on March 15, 
1963. 
I ask unanimous consent to have the 
address printed at this point in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
COMMISSIONING ADDRESS FOR U.S.S. "JAMES 
MADISON" (SSBN-627) BY THE HONORABLE 
THOMAS D. MORRIS, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE, INSTALLATIONS AND LOGISTICS, JULY 
28, 1964, AT NEWPORT NEWS, VA. 
Admiral Lowrance, ladies, and gentlemen; 
it is my pleasant duty today to express to 
the Navy, to the officers and crews of our 23d 
Polaris submarine, and to its builders?the 
deep gratitude and respect of our Govern-
ment and of the citizens of the free world 
everywhere. 
In a world where no major wars are now 
raging, it may seem inappropriate to dwell 
on the awesome destructive power that will 
be poised ready for launching, in this sub-
marine. It is for this very reason that we 
speak of our deterrent force?a force to put 
potential enemies on notice that we havefl 
the weapons to retaliate overwhelmingly if 
attacked. Sixteen nuclear tipped missiles?
which take their name from the North Star, 
Polaris?will soon be hidden somewhere in 
the vastness of the ocean?ready to rain de-
struction on a potential enemy, if all-out 
war should come. 
Although we do not wish to rattle our mis-
siles, or raise our weapons in threat, this 
submarine is an indisputable fact. It is a 
significant fact. The whole world now ap-
preciates the military significance of the mo-
bile Polaris missile system, as well as of the 
other weapons in our defense arsenal which 
include land-based missiles and weapons 
carried in aircraft. All three types are on 
constant alert; the submarines on station

at sea, and the aircraft, in flight, in substan-
tial numbers. The James Madison is, there-
fore, a powerful addition to a Convincing, 
*unsurpassed deterrent forCe. 
As you know, all Polaris submarines are 
named for outstanding figures in American 
history. I cannot think of a more fitting 
namesake than James Maxtlsop,, a great Presi-
dent and a native Virginian. When ours was 
a new nation, Madison's efforts to frame a 
workable constitution were largely respon-
sible for achieving the necessary strength of 
the Federal Government: In fact, he is 
known as the master builder of the Consti-
tution. 
As the fourth President of the United 
States?who served from 1809 through 1817?
James Madison guided the country safely 
through the perilous War of 1812. /t was 
his leadership that brought into being the 
American Navy on the Great Lakes, which 
delivered the pivotal victories in that region. 
Madison was a great scholar, President and 
statesman. He was an intellectual who could 
exercise firmness with justice. 
In the early years of our country when its 
young government was beset by dissension 
from within and war from without, the 
steady nerves and quiet wisdom of James 
Madison brought the Ship of State safely to 
harbor. I know that the two crews of this 
submarine will be a great credit to their 
outstanding namesake. 
The crews of this sulamarine have been 
carefully selected and trained to their task. 
They are about to embark in a ship which 
is the product of the highest skills of Amer-
ican industry. Scientists, engineers, and 
skilled craftsmen, who have labored to-
gether to build this ship, deserve the respect 
and thanks of us all. This ship is truly a 
product of their minds, their hearts, and 
their hands. It is to the ingenuity of these 
people?and to their effective hard work?
that this Nation owes much of its strength. 
There are two striking parallels that we 
can draw between this submarine and Pres-
ident Madison. This ship was conceived in 
liberty and dedicated to freedom as was the 
Constitution of the United States, which 
owes so much to the inspiration of Madison. 
This ship has been built to a high purpose?
to deter war and assure freedom. Madison's 
efforts in the Constitutional Convention, in 
the Federalist Papers, as Secretary of State 
under Thomas Jefferson, and as President, 
were directed toward the same high pur-
pose?an end to tyranny and assurance of 
individual freedom. 
The second parallel can be drawn between 
the builders of the ship, ,and her namesake, 
in the concern of both for maximum strength 
at the least cost. President Madison strove 
for a strong America and one wherein the 
purchasing power of the' dollar would re-
main high. Submarines, vitally needed for 
the Nation's defense, such as the James Madi-
son, are complex and costly. In building 
this submarine and in the procurement of 
all weapons, the Department of Defense vig-
orously strives for powerful military forces 
with maximum value for every dollar spent. 
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara has 
recently reported to the President that the 
Defense Department has achieved a great 
Increase in its military strength and readi-
ness at savings of over 621/2 billion during 
the past year. Mr. McNamara advised the 
President that we shall strive to preserve 
and increase this strength while attaining 
savings of 84.6 billion a year by fiscal 1968 
and each year thereafter, The Secretary has 
assured the President that these savings are 
being achieved by increased efficiency and 
without any adverse effect on our military 
strength or combat readiness. It is his con-
viction and mine that a well equipped Mili-
tary Establishment and prudent low-cost 
management go hand in hand. 
In fact, during the last 3 years we have 
increased the number of nuclear warheads 
in the Strategic Alert Forces?which include 
the Polaris submarine?by 150 percent. We 
have achieved a 100-percent increase in gen-
eral ship construction and conversion to 
modernize the Navy. Similar increases have 
been made in Army and Air Force combat 
strength. 
The Secretary of Defense has also paid 
high tribute to the genius of American in-
dustry which has made it possible to produce 
these miracles of modern tchnology. The 
managers and employees of the Newport 
News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. stand 
among the foremost members of defense in-
dustry in their ability to contribute new and 
powerful weapons to our arsenal at a cost 
which sets a high mark of efficiency for 
competitive free enterprise. The James 
Madison bears witness to the determination 
of our Government and of private enterprise 
to provide the best weapons available at the 
lowest sound cost to the Nation's taxpayers. 
In closing, I would like to commend the 
men of the James Madison who will soon 
embark on their first operational patrol. I 
believe that if President Madison were alive 
today he would stand here proudly, know-
ing that the safety of his country is in the 
hands of men as patriotic and dedicated to 
freedom as any who ever served this Nation. 
Your willingness to endure the long, lonely 
patrols in the remote depths of the sea are 
setting a new standard of self-secrifice in 
your country's service. I know that this sub-
marine will be a credit to the officers and 
men who man her, and I also know that I 
speak for all Americans in extending to you 
our best wishes for a peaceful voya e IV! 
God watch over you. Thank 
PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S STA Ehi NT 
ON THE ratST ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY 
Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, yes-
terday the President of the United States 
reminded the Nation and the world, that 
this week marks the first anniversary of 
the nuclear test ban treaty signed in 
Moscow on August 5, 1963. This is, in-
deed, a most timely and relevant state-
ment. 
In my opinion, history will record the 
nuclear test ban treaty as the single most 
important accomplishment of our late 
President, John F. Kennedy. History 
will note clearly that on this date?Au-
gust 5, 1963?the world took one long 
step back from the brink of nuclear de-
struction. 
In his profound analysis of the ele-
ments of world peace delivered at Amer-
ican University on June 10, 1963, Presi-
dent Kennedy observed: 
There is no single, simple key to this 
peace?no grand or magic formula to be 
adopted by one or two powers. Genuine 
peace must be the product of many na-
tions, the sum of many acts. * * * For peace 
is a process?a way of solving problems. 
One year later the nuclear test ban 
treaty stands as a major contribution 
In that process which President Ken-
nedy understood with such clarity and 
vision. 
The U.S. Senate and the American 
people responded to this challenge of 
transforming the drift toward war into 
a process of peace. As President John-
son noted yesterday, three-fourths of the 
Republicans joined with tour-fifths of 
the Democrats in approving the resolu-
tion of ratification by the overwhelming 
margin of 80 to 19. As with the passage 
of the civil rights bill this year, the two 
great political parties of America joined 
together in achieving an objective so ob-
viously in the best interests of this coun-
try. We can be justly proud of a politi-
cal system which permits such accom-
modation and cooperation when the se-
curity of our people is at stake. 
One year later we breathe air which 
is cleaner of nuclear contamination. 
This is a factor which every American 
family understands and appreciates, for 
the debate on the ratification of the 
treaty had disclosed shocking examples 
of unacceptably high levels of radiation 
to which Americans had been exposed. 
This year has passed without any at-
mospheric testing; every American reaps 
the benefits of the resulting lower levels 
of nuclear fallout. 
President Johnson also reported that 
the program of safeguards to insure 
against secret testing has been fully im-
plemented and that the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff have reported that satisfactory 
progress is being made under this pro-
gram. As the President said yesterday: 
Indeed the safeguards program leaves us 
much safer against surprises than we were 
in the period of moratorium begun in 1959. 
In the past year the United States has 
not relaxed in its mission to protect free-
dom around the world. In fact, our de-
fense capability has never been more 
powerful. But in this past year we have 
been successful in reducing somewhat 
the nuclear arms race. We have con-
tributed to the process of peace for which 
every President has labored since the 
dawn of the atomic age. We must never 
forget that President Truman, President 
Eisenhower, President Kennedy, and 
President Johnson have been united in 
their belief that an enforcible nuclear 
test ban treaty clearly enhanced Ameri-
can national security. 
Let us join with President Johnson in 
this affirmation: 
We can live in strength without adding to 
the hazards of life on this planet. We need 
not relax our guard in order to avoid un-
necessary risks. This is the legacy of the 
nuclear test ban treaty and it is a legacy of 
hope. 
I ask unanimous consent that Presi-
dent Johnson's remarks of July 30, 1964, 
dealing with the first anniversary of the 
nuclear test ban treaty be printed at this 
point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the remarks 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
The PRESIDENT. First, a year ago this week 
the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed 
and agreed upon. Today, a year later, more 
than 100 nations have joined the 3 origi-
nal signing countries. We have also seen 
a U.N. resolution banning weapons of mass 
destruction in outer space, and steps to cut 
back production of fissionable materials. 
A year without atmospheric testing has 
left our air cleaner. This is a benefit to 
every American family, and to every family 
everywhere, since all radiation, however 
small, involves some possibility of biological 
risk to us or to our descendants. At the 
same time we have taken every precaution to 
insure the security of the United States. To 
this end, we have put into full effect the 
program of safeguards originally approved 
by President Kennedy on the advice of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. I can report that the 
Chiefs have reviewed the present program

and agree that satisfactory progress is being 
made under lt. Indeed the safeguards pro-
gram leaves us naucli safer against surprlies 
than we were in the period of moratorium 
, 
begun in 1059. 
Even if this treaty should end tomorrow, 
the United States would be safer and 
stronger than before. We ?vie the test ban 
treaty, and this year of progress, to the 
determined and dedicated leadership of a 
great President, and the Senate of the United 
States and this, leadership toward peace has 
had no Partisan tinge. -FOur-lifehs of The 
Democrats and three-fourthe of the Iteptibli-
cans in the Senate voted for this treaty. tt 
Is therefore right that all Americans, without 
regard to party, should give thanks in this 
anniversary week for what the President and 
the Senate achieved last year. 
This thankfulness can be traced to the 
deep desire that all or us have for & world 
in which terror does not govern our waking 
lives. We should think of a World in which 
we need not fear the"milk :which our chil-
dren cif:ink; in which we do nOt need engage 
in agonizing speculation on the future gen-
erations and whether they will be deformed 
or scarred. 
We can live in strength without adding 
to the hazards of life on this , planet. We 
need not relax our guard in order to avoid 
unnecessary risks. This is the legacy of 
the nuclear test* ban treaty and it is a 
legacy of hope. . 
? "FLOODWATERS AN' ASSET" 
Mr. METCALF. Mr. President, iciOn-
taria was recently ravaged by some of the 
most damaging floods in its history. As 
a result of these floods in Montana 
there has been oonsiderahle,speculation 
concealing the construction of additional 
flood-control projects. As always, there 
are those who Maintain that big flood-
control dams are not needed and do" not 
serge any purpose except in time of 
floods7--which, fortunately, do not occur 
very often. all of us in Montana 
follow that line of thought ? and recently 
I was pleased to find that an objective 
editor outside the State of Montana sup-
ports our position. 
I ask unanimous consent that an edi-
torial entitled "Floodwaters an Asset," 
from the Minneapolis Star, and reprint-
ed in the Great Falls Tribune, be printed 
in the CONGRE85IONIqf 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the lizboin, 
as follows': 
OTHER EDITORS SAY "r1400D,WATEAS AN MART" 
The June floods in Montana caused tens 
, 
of millions of dollars damage andi took'many 
lives. The Great Northern RRilway alone 
had to spend $3 million to restore its service. 
Great waste and damage, yes, but not en-
tirely waste. Less than three decades ago, 
the same water would have poured down 
the Missouri River, perhaps damaging points 
below Montana, and would have ended up 
in the Gulf Of Mexico. The only useful 
function might have been the moistening of 
some farmlands along the way. 
Last month's floodwaters did not do this. 
Instead, they ended up peaceably in the 
chain of Missouri River reservoirs that extend 
from FOrt Pgcic Pam in eastern. Montauk t0 
Gavins Point Darn in eastern South Dalcs4a. 
The six-dam system scored a net gain of 
4.9 million acre-feet in June, or more than 
three times as intleh as actually was released 
at Gavins Point to flow sOlktli. On June 30 
storage had reached a record 45.8 million 
acre-feet?a valuable and growing natural 
resource to aid power production, navigation, 
recreation and, hopefully someday, large-
scale irrigation in both North and South 
Dakota. 
The question of such irrigation is timely, 
for the House Interior and Insular Affairs 
Committee last month approved the first 
$207 million phase of the proposed Garrison 
diversion project in North Dakota. This irri-
gation measure is expected to be taken up 
by the full House this summer. It already 
has passed the Senate in slightly different 
form. What the House does will have a sig-
nificant impact on the future of North 
Dakota. 
THE RUSSIAN GRAIN DEAL 
_ . 
Mrs. SMITH, Mr. President, the 
Daily Kennebec Journal, of Augusta, 
Maine, has a long and distinguished rec-
ord for the excellence of its objective 
and cogent editorials. 
The lead editorial of the July 28, 1964, 
issue of this great publication illustrates 
its editorial excelle.nce.. I e9minend_ to 
the Members of this body, and i ask 
unanimous consent that it be inserted in 
the body of the RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE RUSSIAN GRAIN DEAL 
, . 
Joseph J. Lombarcfo, commander of the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars, has urged that 
this country halt wheat shipments to Russia 
pending investigation of reports that the 
Soviets are reshipping U.S. grain to Cuba. 
Soviet spokesmen have denied reports by 
the captain and chief officer of the U.S. 
freighter Sister Katingo that they saw Amer-
ican wheat being loaded aboard a Soviet 
vessel for shipment to Cuba in the Black 
Sea port of Novorossisk. 
The Sister katingo is the vessel which the 
Russians halted at sea, with three shots 
across the bow, following a dispute over 
cargo-handling charges. A boarding party 
from a Soviet naval ship then searched the 
U.S. vessel, compelled the captain to sign a 
paper which he couldn't translate, and fined 
him, the equivalent of about $50. 
Demanding that further 'U.S. grain ship-
ments to Russia halt until the charges made 
following this incident can be investigated, 
the VFW commander says that "the United 
tates finds itself in the strange position of 
building up a regime dedicated to our own 
destruction." - 
The United States-Soviet wheat deal has 
been a strange thing from the beginning. 
First,. the American people were given the 
Impression that this country would get rid of 
some surplus wheat for Which the Russians 
would pay in gold. But then it developed 
that long-term credit had been extended 
from the Export-Import Bank to both the 
Soviet Union and Red Hungary. Instead of 
swapping grain for gold, we were letting the 
Reds say, "Charge it, please." 
Next, there was the word that at least 50 
percent of the wheat for Russia must 
be hauled in U.S. vessels. But American 
ships have moved very little of that grain. 
Paul Hall, president of the AFL-CIO Sea-
farers Union, has understandably expressed 
organized labor's unhappiness over this. 
The charge that U.S. wheat is now going 
to Communist Cuba? via the Soyiet Union, 
would, if -substantiated, serve as one more 
example of Red duplicity in the face of a 
supposedly binding agreement; Tinder terms 
of the export licenses granted by the Vepart-
ment of Commerce for the Soviet wheat ship-
ments, none of the grain may be exported 
from Itusala without U.S. approval;

RADIO'S NEW LOOK 
Mr. BARTLETT. Mr. President, in 
spite of the inroads made by television, 
the radio industry continues prosperous 
and vigorous. Local radio stations 
across the country in recent years have 
brought forth many interesting and 
stimulating program ideas. The effec-
tiveness of these ideas can be seen in the 
continuing growth of radio audiences. 
The Federal Communications Commis-
sion has estimated that radio is listened 
to in at least 40 million homes each 
week. 
Radio has great potential. Nowhere 
in the country has this potential been 
shown to better advantage than in 
Seattle, Wash., where the small radio 
station KRAB-FM has developed, in 
little more than a year, a devoted, if 
small, following. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD an article de-
scribing this station and its original and 
challenging programing. The article 
is from the June issue of Seattle. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
RABBLE'S BABBL, 
.' HOT LICKS BY BIX 
r 
, (By Rillmond Schear) 
In a ramshackle structure that used to be 
a doughnut shop, a radio announcer throws 
three switches in quick succession and 
breathes the fumes of Spanish wine into a 
microphone. "This is KRAB in Seattle," he 
says?and then he coughs. Around the city, 
people are presumably seated by their radios, 
monitoring Seattle's most extraordinary 
broadcasting operation. They listen atten-
tively as the announcer continues; "We're 
now, going to hear a program of occupational 
disease music, with the Falashas of Ethio-
pia"?and he is dead serious. 
KRAB is that odd little FM station (107.7 
on the dial) which refuses to take advertis-
ing but will happily put on anything else 
that people care to hear?or to air. Of four 
listener-supported stations in the country, 
It is the only one which is independently 
owned and operated. Its subscribers pay $12 
a year, but KRAB keeps right on running 
impressive deficits. The advantages of this 
unique system are obvious, for KRAB is 
getting more irresistible all the time. 
Typical programs include such varied fare 
as "The Pedagogy of the Russian Violin, Gas 
Warfare" (an article in favor of; read from 
the National Review); "Jelly Roll Morton 
Tells His Own Story"; a live panel discussion 
about the State's liquor laws; readings in 
Latin, Russian, Chinese, Urdu, and other 
popular languages; "Sacred Music of the 
Renaissance"; "Music for the Glass Harmon-
ica"; "Music of Afghanistan"; and "Music for 
Belly Dancers" (featuring Vivaldi, Bix 13eider-
becke, Tschaikovsky and Leadbelly) . 
In return for their contributions, sub-
scribers receive a program guide every 2 weeks 
that is printed, surprisingly enough, in Eng-
lish. They are also regularly urged to sup-
port KRAB in ways other than financial?
from interviewing dignitaries to prettifying 
the premises. - 
On any given day, people who show up at 
the studios may include housewives, high 
school kids, physicians, dock workers, lawyers 
and assorted beatniks. Their combined ex-
perience in radio amounts to almost nothing, 
and their social and political opinions, if 
they happen to have any, are as disparate as 
their backgrounds. 
Therein lies the great value of KRAB. It 
is Seattle's leading medium for the unusual,

the offbeat, the unpopular and?often?the 
unheard of. Material fo.t Kr has toineet 
only two conditions: it Mu have Inherent 
quality and it must, by its Very nature, be 
unlikely to get aired by any other radio 
staticei. 
The cbaraeter of !CRAB, both on and off 
the air, has been shaped by its, founder, 
Lorenzolidilam., who alsn'don? les as itapro-
gram director, chief announcer and head 
politician. "if there's lust one guy who 
thinks that certain stuff greet," -says 
?T11 play it." 
A tall, affable 30-year-old -who was crip-
pled by polio in his youth. Milam sPends 
much of his time coaxing the right people 
(he hopes) into appearing on-ERAB as bom-
mentators, intnrviewers or panelists?a role 
that Is particularly attract. ive because panel 
membera are served beet or -wine whffs on 
the air., Milarn makes a special point of 
attracting extremists. "those wild ideas," 
he says, -"you've got to have them to form 
your own opinions somewherein between." 
Perhaps the strangest thing about HAAB 
Jihad here in Seattle when e original seed 
is that it should have sprottted and !Jour-
was sown some 3.000 miles away. .That was 
In Jacksonviiie, Wasi's harnetown, 
where iliae young Lorenzo used to lie awake 
nights listening to east-coait stations and 
Iniagining how Might` revelutionize Their 
programing. 
Years afterward. in 1949. Milani appeared 
personally before the Pedevil Communica-
tions Commission in Washington. D.C. and 
proclaimed his wish to start ,station. "'They 
thought, that was pretty funny," he recalls 
His initial ploy was to launch a 1111.AB-
type operation in Washington itself. 'This 
proved fruitless, so Milani decided to apply 
for a commercial license in tome other. city. 
His first choice was Setitle?, which he. had 
never Visited but Which,,roin everything he 
had heard, soundedlike i,:reasonably cltllzed 
Place. 
The application that he filed with the FCC 
made three essential dein* (1) He was 
legally qualified to own a-station ("You-have 
to prove you are a good guy:" he says); (2) 
be wee, technically tins:lifted by virtue of 
ownhag.a transmitter of 1948 vintage which 
had coot him $5,000; and (3) he was finan-
cially cfuallfied because of Ilquid itisets ex-
ceeding $15,009 that he had inherited from 
MS father. 
Milani mailed in his application and took 
off for Spain. A year later, he got the FCC's 
go-ahead. It was in April 062 that Milam 
arrived here without fanfare:to start CRAB. 
The Shoice of call littera had paRlally 
teen a puke. The FCC required applicants 
to submit 10 cotabinations, of t hitters, 
listed in order of preference. /nem headed 
his list with Irt.tie ("I like ids paintings") 
and KANT ("the philosopher; I have not 
Mad his works, but"). The FCC Passed 
these over in favor of NO. 3--ERAB. U had 
been ineluded "more or less a cetiously;" ac-
cording to Milam, but he has no regrets. 
"A crab can go iii all directions," he points 
out "In time of danger, it can scuttle un-
der the nearest mex, antit le capable cif de-
livering a vicious bite." 
After looking over Seattle, Milam decided 
to locate the station in an 
lag at 91st Northeast and Roosevelt ,Way, 
which he now rents for $75 a month. Then 
he advertised in Broadcasting magazinp for 
"i1,31 engineer to work with no pay." To his 
surprise, Milam got one?a teenege tech-
nical genius named Jere/iv Lanszmn, Of San 
Francisco, who, at 13, had run his own six-
station ? network by making 5-watt trans-
matters and passing them out among his 
neighborhood pals?until the FCC- smashed 
the illicit operation. _ 
Atter' weeks of tinkering, Lansmaii got 
Ittalre ancient transmitter to perk. 
"Then," recalls wain, "the bloody power 
? 
transformer started shooting blue sparks all 
over the place, so we took It out on the 
street and started beating and kicking it. 
That was our first live broadcast?us taking 
out all our aggressions on the old trans-
former." - 
Even now, ICRA.B has only two paid em-
ployees. One of these is Charles Howlett, 
an engineering student who has succeeded 
Lens/nen and earns $25 a week as chief tech-
nician. The other is Robert Garflas, an 
ethnomusicologist at the university, who 
makes $25 weekly as the -station's music 
director. 
All performers appear without pay, and 
they are a decidely diverse group. Among 
ICRAB's commentators have been Dr. William 
Halliday, a physician who favors conserva-
tion and opposes Federal medical plans; 
Frank Krasnowski of the Socialist Workers' 
for Trotskyite) Party; Father Thomas 
O'Brien, a conservative who is director of 
the honors program at Seattle University; 
Donald Flynn of the John Birch Soicety; 
Dr. Frederick Exner, a radiologist and critic 
of fluoridation; and Deb Dag. as Indian-born 
graduate student at the `university who 
espottles a mystical approach to politics. 
The number of subscribers now exceeds 
$00, Which assures =LAB a monthly income 
of more than $500. The station costa $975 
a month to operate. The gap is closed, more 
or less, through such fundraising gimmicks 
as concerts, cover-charge parties and out-
right begging. Solicitations are spearheaded 
by a group called Claw?the Committee to 
Enlighten the Airwaves?which is run by Bud 
Havlisch and his wife, Sylvia. Havlisch is 
a longshoreman. 
But the station's best promotion is the 
bimonthly program guide that Milam puts 
together. In it he writes passionate paeans 
to HAAB in a Dos Passos-esque style. To 
him, the transmitter has a "great smelly 
driving hum." The sound is therapeutic, 
for it means "that your scurrilous words are 
flooding the countryside, bouncing off hills 
and trees, ramming headlong-into cows ? * ? 
filtering into that radio, into that tiny coil 
of heat ? ? ? red, deep, rayaerious." 
Rot long ago, the pnagram guide listed a 
discussion of "The Origin of the Species," 
which was to be followed by an "Origin of 
the Species Concert" blending Australian 
aboriginal music, Charlie Mingus and Pithe-
canthropus Erectus. A program of "Poems 
by THOMAS PHUT" (written long before he 
went to Congress and accompanied by ap-
propriate music) was followed several weeks 
later by "Poems by Mao Tse-tung" because 
the guide explained, "It has been claimed 
that our presentation of the poeiry of 
THOMAS PELLY did not give equal time bo the 
other side." 
As a clearinghouse for ideas, which makes 
/CRAB invaluable to Seattle, the station is 
wide open to charges of propagandizing. 
However, Milam himself is entirely apolitical. 
"I was sort of a mushy liberal in school," 
he concedes, "but this station has been an 
eye opener. I've found there are just as 
many finks on the left as on the right. I'm 
confused. My views change from day to day. 
I tend to agree with the individual I'm drink-
ing beer with. To hell with politics?I 
prefer Baroque music."

BILL 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. 
Mr. MORSE. I think, in fairness to 
the Senator from Montana and myself, 
I should say that, as I did last year, I 
take the position that the foreign aid 
bill should be discussed under the rules 
of the Senate, without any agreements 
Involving any limitations fixing a time 
to vote or any of the other provisions 
that can be made by unanimous consent. 
But I want the Senator to know I speak 
in good faith when I tell him I have every 
intention of expediting the handling of 
the foreign aid bill in every possible way, 
consistent with adequate and full dis-
cussion of the points involved. I be-
lieve time will be saved by following that 
course of action. 
/ thought, in fairness to myself, 
should make that statement, so it is un-
derstood that as we undertake consider-
ation of the foreign aid bill this year, I 
shall take the position that it should be 
discussed under the rules of the Senate. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I thank the Sen-
ator. 
AMENDMENT OF SECTION 3 OF AD-
MINIS'ISA'rIVE PROCEDURE ACT 
OF 1946 
Mr. HUMPHREY, Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to reconsider Senate bill 1666, 
and that the Senate reconsider the votes 
by which the bill was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading, and was read 
the third time, and passed. 
Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, has this matter 
been cleared? 
Mn HUMPHREY. Yes, it has been 
cleared, I assure the Senator. 
The PRESIDING OFFIehlt. The bill 
will be stated by title. 
The LEGISLATIVE CLERIC. A bill (S. 
1666) to amend section 3 of the Admini-
strative Procedure Act, chapter 324, of 
the act of june 11. 1946 (60 Stat. 238) , to 
clarify and protect the right of the public 
to information, and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the unanimous-consent re-
quest to reconsider the engrossment, 
third reading, and passage of the bill? 
The Chair hears no objection. 
The bill is before the Senate. 
Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, on 
Tuesday, July 28, 1964, the Senate-passed 
without debate S. 1666, amendments to 
section 3 of the Administrative Procedure 
Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 238) . I entered sub-
sequently a motion of reconsideration of 
S. 1666, and the bill returned to the 
calendar. 
I want to make it crystal clear to every 
Senator that I am not opposed to S. 1666. 
It deals with the vital subject of access of 
Information in Federal agencies and 
every Senator knows that certain agen-

most flagrant manner the legitimate 
right to withhold certain privileged or 
confidential information. The time for
