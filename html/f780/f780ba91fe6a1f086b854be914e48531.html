SITUATION REPORTS 
CHINA-VIETNAM-USSR 
China has formalized its offer, made earlier through 
the media, to negotiate its differences with Vietnam. In 
a note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry to the Vietnamese 
Embassy in Beijing, China reiterated its call for "peace 
talks" and suggested the two sides dispatch representa-
tives at the deputy foreign minister level to hold talks 
"as soon as possible" at a mutually agreed upon location. 
The Chinese note implies the negotiations would be re-
stricted to border problems. Vietnam has not yet re-
sponded to the proposal but almost certainly will reject 
it; Hanoi has consistently refused to negotiate so long 
as Chinese soldiers remain on Vietnamese soil. In the 
event of a rejection, China will undoubtedly portray 
25X1 
Vietnam as the intransigent party. 
We continue to receive little reporting on the mili-
tary situation along the Sino-Vietnamese border, but 25X1 
heavy fighting apparently is continuing in several areas.

Leadership Speeches  
Like the speeches of the Soviet leaders who preceded 
him, Premier Kosygin's election speech yesterday provided 
no clues as to how Moscow will respond to the Chinese in-
vasion of Vietnam. Kosygin's remarks were notable for: 
-- His statement that Vietnam would not be 
abandoned in its "time of trial." 
Criticism of unnamed international forces 
who take "an equal approach" to China's 
invasion of Vietnam and events in Kam-
puchea. 
The attack on "imperialist forces in the West 
and the Far East" for encouraging "the Chi-
nese leadership's aggressive course" and 
trying to make states renounce their efforts 
to curb the arms race. 
-- His reaffirmation of Soviet interest in 
expanded trade and economic ties with the 
US. 
-- His conclusion that despite recent 
developments, the trend toward relaxation 
of tension remains "a leading one in in-
ternational life." 
25X1 
Kosygin said, however, that in view of escalation 
by the "militaristic aggressive forces" in the world, it 
is necessary to maintain and strengthen the Soviet de-
fense potential.   25X1

to resist efforts for a negotiated settlement of the

conflict in Kampuchea.

ALERT MEMORANDUM 
IRAN 
25X1 
despite some progress in re-
storing economic activity. His government has not suc-
ceeded in restoring law and order, is beset by political 
divisions in its own ranks, is troubled by nascent au-
tonomy movements in Kordestan and Azarbaijan, and is facing 
a severe challenge from heavily armed and committed left-
ists. 
  Bazargan's problems may 
be increased now that Ayatollah Khomeini has left Tehran 
for Qom and has removed himself  from the day-to-day con-
duct of governmental affairs. 
25X1 
We believe there is a good possibility that the 
Bazargan government may not survive the combined pres-
sures posed by internal friction and a sustained chal-
lenge from the left. Even if Bazargan is able to remain 
in office, he probably will have to continue to make far-
reaching concessions to the left in order to retain power. 
There is also the possibility that the Prime Minister may 
be overthrown by more radical members in or outside of 
his own government, and there is potential for civil war 
if he decides to challenge the left militarily. 
Given the likelihood of prolonged instability in 
Iran, there is little prospect that the Bazargan govern-
ment will be able or willing to develop effective coop-
eration with the US. The government will be preoccupied 
with its own survival and maintaining the country's na-
tional cohesion; its reliability as an oil exporter will 
be in doubt.

opponents on one key issue--their insistence that they 
be allowed to retain the arms that enable them to force 
concessions from him. Moscow is likely to increase co-
vert efforts to broaden its contacts among the leftist 
factions while gradually becoming more open in support 
for the Tudeh (Communist) Party's claim to a role in the 
new power alignment. Should the situation degenerate 
into open civil war, the Soviets are likely to funnel 
covert support to those groups that then appear most 
favorable to their interests, while professing noninter-
vention  and continuing to warn the US against interven-
tion.

USSR-IRAN: Soviet Position 
Soviet leaders have been notably quiet about Iran, 
and a Soviet Foreign Ministry official told a US Embassy 
officer this week that the situation there is unclear. 
The Soviets are undoubtedly concerned about Ayatollah 
Khomeini's anti-Communist orientation, however, and prob-
ably hope to strengthen those forces?especially the 
Tudeh (Communist) Party--they would prefer to see in 25X1 
power. 
The Soviet official indicated that the revolution 
would not be stopped, although it might slow down or 
take a conservative turn because the left is weak. 
The Soviet media coverage of the government of 25X1 
Prime Minister Bazargan, while reminiscent of the cau-
tious line toward the Shah before his fall, has been both 
more positive and more extensive. The Tudeh Party and 
the Soviet-supported clandestine radio, the "National 
Voice of Iran," which had consistently attacked the Shah, 
have expressed support for Khomeini. 
25X1 
The Soviets, however, treat Khomeini's victory as 
only the "first stage" in the revolution. While this 
line can be defended as supporting the Bazargan govern-
ment, we believe it indicates the Soviets are hoping to 
see movement toward a leftist regime. The "National Voice" 
is calling on the revolutionary forces to retain their 
arms despite the Bazargan government's efforts to disarm 
the population. The "National Voice" argues that this 
is necessary to guard the revolution against the threat 
of imperialists and counterrevolutionaries.   25X1 
The "National Voice" has also expressed support for 
the Mujahadin, the terrorist group that defends Khomeini's 
interests. We have no evidence of any open Soviet con-
tacts with either the Mujahadin or the Chariks, the left-
ist terrorist group. While both groups have probably re-
ceived assistance from Soviet-supported third parties, 
the Soviets have generally avoided providing direct sup-
port to such extremist groups. It seems unlikely that 
the Soviets would support any direct challenge to Kho- 25X1 
meini and risk alienating him completely.

USSR: Oil Export Problems 
25X1 
Recent severe weather in the USSR has boosted oil 
consumption and slowed oil production. It has also Zed 
to oil transport difficulties, especially in rail move-
ments. Another problem is the four-month cut-off in 
Iranian gas deliveries, which has forced the Soviets to25X1 
substitute oil for gas in the Transcaucasus region, and 
to cut back oil deliveries to the West. The prospect is 
for a decline in total oil exports throughout 1979. 
the USSR has cut 
off oil deliveries of about 65,000 barrels per day to 
Sweden for the past three or four months. India also 
has reported  delays in Soviet shipments of kerosene and 
25X1

diesel fuel.r 
the USSR has also with-
drawn from the spot market in Rotterdami

CHAD: Military Situation 
25X1 
Forces loyal to President Malloum are abandoning 
most of central and eastern Chad to rebel armies and 
followers of Prime Minister Habre, a former rebel leader. 
Units of the Chadian Army appear to be withdrawing south 
to a line extending roughly from Am Timan to Mongo to 
Ndjamena. Habre's army controls many of the towns in the 
center of the country, including Oum Hadjer and part of 
Ndjamena. Rebels led by Goukouni, the most influential 
of the Muslim rebel chieftains, appear to have substanti-
ally strengthened their position and now control Mao 
and Arada and most of the territory north. Goukouni's 
forces and rebels allied with them also control most of 
the Lake Chad region. By pulling back to the south, 
Malloum undoubtedly hopes to retain administrative con-
trol over the most populous and wealthiest part of the 
country where he also has his primary base of tribal 
support. Goukouni, on the other hand, is taking ad-
vantage of the situation to strengthen his bargaining 
position in the peace negotiations scheduled to take 
place next week in Nigeria. 25X1 
MOROCCO - SAUDI ARABIA: Hassan Visit 
King Hassan is to visit Saudi Arabia next Monday, 
according to the Saudi Ambassador in Rabat. Hassan may 
request Saudi assistance in reopening direct Moroccan-
Algerian talks on Western Sahara. French efforts to 
facilitate such contacts last month apparently were un-
successful. The war is going badly for Morocco, and 
Hassan needs a political settlement. He will also dis-
cuss regional developments with the Saudis and request 
renewed Saudi financial support. Saudi aid, other than 
that tied to specific projects, has been generally 
blocked for more than a year largely because of Moroccan 
unwillingness to accept effective monitoring of its end 
use.

less, the inauguration on 12 March of President-elect 
Herrera--who has already praised the recent round of 
price increases--as well as growing internal pressure 
to take advantage of current market trends, will doubt-
less bring an increase in crude prices when current con-
tracts expire on 31 March.

USSR: Salyut-6 Update 
25X1 
Two Soviet cosmonauts who boarded the Salyut-6 
space station on Monday have activated and performed 
an initial checkout of the station's equipment. They 
are giving special attention to the station's life sup-
port, thermoregulation, and power supply systems. Al-
though some replacement of parts is necessary, the cos-
monauts stated that their preliminary examination indi-
cates the station is capable of supporting a continued 
mission. It is likely that the Soviets later this month 
will launch an unmanned Progress resupply vehicle.

SPECIAL ANALYSIS 
CHINA: Youth Protests 
25X1 
25X1 
Chinese leaders seem to recognize that, in the long 
term, the success or failure of their drive to modernize 
the nation depends in part on how effectively they can 
harness rising public expectations. In recent months, 
the leadership has been fairly tolerant of peaceful demon-
strations by young people impatient for the improved 
living conditions they associate with modernization. 
The disruptive protests by urban youth in Shanghai early 
last month, however, prompted swift but measured action 
to restore order and to prevent similar outbreaks else-
where. 
25X1 
In early February, youth who had been resettled 
in rural areas in lieu of college or factory employment 
took advantage of liberal leave and travel policies 
during the Lunar New Year celebration to return to Shang-
hai and protest the refusal of local leaders to approve 
their permanent transfer back to the city. Students 
blocked rail service to the city, damaged streetcars, 
tied up traffic, and surrounded the municipal offices. 
25X1 
The central authorities responded swiftly. Public 
security officials warned the protesters to cease, and 
after a series of meetings and the receipt of a hastily 
telephoned directive from Beijing, the disruptions ended. 
According to the city's radio service, only two of the 
protesters were detained. 
25X1 
Problems with Resettled Youth 
The Shanghai protests, while the most violent, are 
not the first involving disgruntled resettled students. 
Protests by the students--unhappy about their educational

or urban job prospects--have occurred throughout the 
history of the "down-to-the-countryside" program. Modi-
fications of the program announced at a national con-
ference last fall heightened expectations that real im-
provements were just around the corner and led the stu-
dents and urban youth to demand immediate improvement 
in their living condition and transfers home. Beijing 
had tried to avoid the impression that changes would come 
swiftly; the conference held that, while it was possible 
to "modify the policy and improve methods," the end of 25X1 
the program and the solution of related problems could 
come only after modernization--that is, slowly. 
The most successful and widely publicized protest 
came in late December when a group of 28 students from 
the border areas of Yunnan went to Beijing and demanded 
a meeting with top officials. Although Premier Hua 
Guofeng and Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping apparently did 
not meet with the group, Vice Premier Wang Zhen, who once 
had responsibility for the resettlement program, and 
the Minister of Civil Affairs did. They sharply rebuked 
the students for leaving their workposts and warned that 
such behavior could seriously damage China's moderniza-
tion effort. 
Managing Expectations  
25X1 
The Shanghai protests, and similar disturbances 
in Hangzhou and Nanchang, reflect potential contradic-
tions in China's overall drive toward modernization. The 
relaxation of restrictions on the public airing of griev-
ances last fall was aimed largely at generating popular 
enthusiasm for modernization. The regime's open commit-
ment to change and, more specifically, to the improvement 
of living conditions already appears to be resulting in 
rapidly rising levels of expectation and a  degree of pro-
test clearly unacceptable to the regime. 25X1 
How successful Beijing is in balancing popular ex-
pectations against realistic goals will be an important 
factor determining the long-term success or failure of 
its modernization effort. Beijing's response to the re-
cent protests, in fact, suggests a deep awareness of the 
long-term implications of such unrest.

The leadership has taken strict action only against 
a small number of instigators. More important, it has 
not attempted to sweep the recent disturbances under the 
rug. Instead, it has widely publicized the Shanghai 
protests as a means of forcefully restating its basic 
policy that "socialist democracy" is necessary but that 
it cannot be permitted to disrupt the modernization ef-
fort. The leaders have begun to drive home the sobering 
point that improved conditions, both political and so-
cial, depend on how successful the drive is to boost pro-
duction and modernize China.

OVERNIGHT REPORTS 
25X1 
(The items in the Overnight Reports section have not 
been coordinated within the intelligence community. 
They are prepared overnight by the Office of Current 
Operations with analyst comment where possible from the 
production offices of NFAC.) 
Spain 
According to official projections of results of yes-
terday's legislative election announced late last night, 
Prime Minister Suarez' Union of the Democratic Center 
will win about 170 of the 350 seats in the lower house 
of the legislature--five seats more than it won in 1977 
but short of a majority. The Socialists of Felipe 
Gonzalez have about 116 seats. As anticipated, ab-
stentions rose to over 30 percent, giving a boost to 
the Communist Party, which will probably increase its 
20 seats in the current legislature to about 25. The 
rightist Democratic Coalition may slip from 16 to eight 
seats. 
25X1 
COMMENT: Suarez' party appears to have won a sur-
prisingly clear victory. King Juan Carlos is virtually 
certain to nominate Suarez to form another government. 
Parliament must approve Suarez' appointment; because he 
lacks a majority there, Suarez may delay government 
formation, perhaps until after the municipal elections 
on 3 April. 
UK 
25X1 
The opposition Conservative Party yesterday won two 
byelections held in districts traditionally "safe" for 
the Tories. The Conservatives promptly called for a 
general election. According to Western news services, 
official results of the referendum on devolution in 
Scotland and Wales will not be known until tonight. A 
poll conducted after the referendum by Britain's com-
mercial television network indicated that voters in Wales 
overwhelmingly rejected devolution. Those voting in 
Scotland approved devolution, but voter turnout 
was low. The network projected that the measure would 
consequently fail to meet the requirement that 40 percent 
of the electorate approve it.

Italy 
25X1 
According to the US Embassy, Prime Minister - 
designate La Malfa has proposed the formation of a 
government composed of the Christian Democrats, 
Republicans, and Social Democrats that would be sup-
ported by the Socialists and Communists. The three 
prospective coalition members support the proposal. 
The Socialists and Communist Party leader Berlinguer 
have not commented, but the Communist daily L'Unita has 
ruled out the proposal as a possibility. The Embassy 
believes that the Socialists are trying hard to convince 
the Communists to go along with La Malfa and at the same 
time are attempting to decide whether they can risk 
supporting him if the Communists do not. Christian Dem-
ocratic and Communist leaders met yesterday; they re-
portedly did not resolve their differences. La Malfa 
will consult with leaders of  all the parties and then re-
port to President Pertini. 
Namibia 
25X1 
The US Embassy in Ethiopia reported yesterday that 
South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) Presi-
dent Sam Nujoma, upon arriving in Addis Ababa on Wednes-
day, publicly accused the US and other "imperialist coun-
tries" of subverting the UN plan for Namibia while 
working toward the creation of a South African puppet 
regime in the area. Although Nujoma restated SWAPO's 
desire for a UN-supervised election, he advocated active 
participation by the Organization of African Unity in 
the implementation of the plan and strongly rejected the 
inclusion of NATO or Australian forces in the proposed 
UN peacekeeping contingent for Namibia. Ethiopia's 
acting Foreign Minister Dawit informed the US Ambassa-
dor that Nujoma is giving serious consideration to boy-
cotting the election. The Embassy commented that Nujoma's 
trip to Addis Ababa reflects his intention to maintain 
close connections with the East as insurance against 
failure of the UN plan.
