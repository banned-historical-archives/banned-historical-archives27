 CHILE: A TIME FOR EXPEDIENTS  ( 1, 'y
 FAs Chileans and their president totted up the
 score at year's end, there were plenty of minuses
 but also a few pluses. The theme struck by Presi-
 dent Allende last week was the need for drastic
 economic remedies to defend the people from
 shortages and speculation.
 Although Allende has warned of impending
 austerity before, the realities of Chile's economic
 position are now grim. Over the past two years,
 the country has been on a consumption spree that
 has cost it some $550 million in foreign reserves,
 a large part of its material inventories, and a
 serious deterioration in both productive capacity
 and international credit rating. Nevertheless, Al-
 lende will not necessarily get his comeuppance in
 the March congressional elections. Many Chileans
 are still better off now than before his election,
 and Allende should be able to stave off severe
 belt-tightening for another two months or so.
 Moreover, the election coincides with the peak of
 the harvest season. Food will be relatively plenti-
 ful, and the annual  summer slowdown should
 permit some easing of distribution problems.
 Since coming to power, Allende has used
 economic levers to alter Chile's power structure in
 an attempt to make his socialist revolution ir-
 reversible.  His populist policies, while causing
 massive government deficits, excessive consumer
 demand, and soaring inflation, have also markedly
 eroded the opposition's economic base. Govern-
 ment ownership and control, already widespread
 in the pre-Allende period, has about doubled in
 the past two years and now accounts or at least
 one half of national output.
 Allende's actions have encountered little ef-
 fective resistance except when they have threat-
 ened to cut deeply into middle-class interests. The
 month-long strike that nearly paralyzed the econ-
 omy in October was triggered by independent
 truckers and small retail merchants, who were
 later joined by professionals and larger entre-
 preneurs. Although violence flared intermittently,
 Allende was supported by the military, and the
 subsequent entry of the military into key cabinet
 posts, opposed by Allende's more radical coali-
 tion partners, may lessen turmoil in the months
 just ahead.
 Allende has been able to boost popular sup-
 port by granting huge wage increases to public
 employees and fostering even larger hikes in the
 private sector. With controlled prices, the average
 Chilean enjoyed an increase of some 25 percent in
 real income in 1971. Last year, wage increases
 and bonuses were outpaced by increasing prices.
 The shortages common in recent months have,
 however, hit hardest at the living standards of the
 upper and middle classes. Low-income people
 with extra money in their pockets for the first
 time probably have not yet begun to worry much
 about the lack of things to buy and have been
 delighted with the leveling of Chile's old elite.
 Sobering realities are, however, coming
 closer to home. Prices began to spiral in August,
 raising the inflation rate for the year to more than
 150 percent, and shortages of essential consumer
 goods are widespread. Production in almost every
 sector of the economy is stagnant or declining.
 Private farm output has been hurt by expropria-
 tions, and illegal seizures of farmland have created
 fear and frustration throughout the shrinking
 private sector. The lack of competent technicians
 and managers has seriously hurt output on the
 more than 50 percent of Chile's farmland now
 controlled  by the government. Poor weather,
 shortages of seed, fertilizer, and credit have com-
 pounded the problem. Because the farms taken
 over had provided much of Chile's marketed out-
 put, foodstuff deliveries to urban  areas have
 dropped sharply.
 Production from the long-established large
 copper mines has declined largely because their
 nationalization triggered an exodus of skilled per-
 sonnel, both foreign and local. In addition to
 inept  management,  featherbedding,  and  poor
 labor discipline, the mining industry in recent
 months has been afflicted with machinery break-
 downs and supply bottlenecks.
 Allende has already gone much farther than
 expected in liquidating Chile's assets to satisfy
 consumers at home. He probably can maintain
 imports until the election by running net foreign
 reserves further into the red and by permitting
 commercial arrears to increase. Some emergency
 assistance will be forthcoming from Communist

 countries. The Soviets adopted a surprisingly hard
 attitude during Allende's recent visit to Moscow,
 perhaps in part because it now appears that sup-
 port to Santiago cost them $103 million in hard
 currency in 1972-about twice the amount re-
 portedly agreed upon earlier in the year. The
 meager $26 million in foodstuffs now offered by
 Moscow contrasts sharply with the $300-500 mil-
 lion Allende was seeking.
 Communist assistance is not likely to stave
 off import cutbacks for very long. These cutbacks
 will mainly be in foodstuffs and industrial raw
 materials. A continuation of economically reck-
 less budget and wage policies in the face of con-
 tracting resources would make runaway inflation,
 rationing, or some combination of the two in-
 evitable.
 I he heating up of the campaign for the
 legislative elections on 4 March has placed the
 three military officers serving in the cabinet in a
 few awkward positions. General Prats, the interior
 minister, is under special challenge. Both the op-
 position and government parties have been loud
 in their praise of what they see as the "true" role
 of the armed forces, but they differ greatly on
 what this role should be. The political parties are
 in this way forcing the military into defining
 more clearly its position vis-a-vis the government,
 an unwelcome task for the officers involved.'
 The Christian Democrats took off the gloves
 during parliamentary moves to impeach the Com-
 munist minister of finance, Orlando Millas, on
 charges that he had violated the terms tnat settled
 the October protest strike. The Christian Demo-
 crats' decision to join the National party in this
 venture was prompted by both opportunism and
 the desire to see Prats squirming when forced to
 defend his Communist colleague. The general
 took up the challenge, declaring the charges
 "lacked  constitutional  or legal grounds" and
 vigorously defending Millas. The general, unac-
 customed to having his word doubted, had to sit
 through a wide-ranging attack on his performance
 as interior minister by Christian Democratic presi-
 dent Fuentealba during a special senate session.
 Prats considered that most of the points raised
 were irrelevant and remarked icily that he must
 have come to the wrong session. Another Chris-
 tian Democratic senator's needling of Prats was
 dismissed , by the general as "unacceptable in-
 s;olence."
 Earlier, a National Party newspaper was sus-
 pended for three days after comparing General
 "rats to "General Insa" (a brand of tire, the
 implication being that both were full of air). So
 far opposition criticism has only angered Prats; it
 may, however, have reinforced the opinion of
 many military officers that Congress is an un-
 necessary body made up of irresponsible poli-
 ticians. Such rough handling could reduce Prats'
 reputed desire to try his luck in presidential poli-
 fics after retirement2
 To make the point once again that Congress
 can harass, but not force substantive changes,
 President Allende had Millas switch posts with the
 minister of economy after the lower house ap-
 proved the impeachment motion on 28 Decem-
 ber. Millas had just completed drawing up the
 1973 budget, and his forced departure from the
 Finance Ministry will provide Allende with an-
 other argument that the administration's poor
 economic showing can be blamed on opposition
 obstructionism.!

 undoubtedly closely monitored if not determined
 by Prats, seem most favorable to officers per-
 sonally loyal to the army commander himself. In
 elaborating on how he sees the military role in
 ciovernment, Prats has stuck to the doctrine that
 the military is non-partisan but not always neutral
 on particular political issues. The general has told
 the Congress he will not allow the country to be
 thrust again into the chaos of the October shut-
 clown. While this dictum applies to all political
 forces, the practical effect is to inhibit the op-
 position.

 INDIA: WINTER OF DISCONTENT
 The failure of two successive monsoons to
 bring enough rain has dealt India an economic
 blow of major proportions. The government's
 emergency  response-the  importation  of food
 grain, the initiation of large-scale relief efforts,
 the distribution of food, and the coordination of
 the  efforts  of the central  and state gov-
 ernments-has generally been well received. There
 is real danger, however, that once the immediate
 emergency is over, nascent popular discontent
 with Prime Minister Gandhi's failure to find a way
 __ijout of the nation's long-term economic morass
 will gather enough momentum to pose a threat to
 her present, near-total control of the body politic.)
 Political  oratory throughout the six-week
 winter session of parliament, which ended last
 month, reflected rising popular disenchantment.
 The government was scored by members of her
 own Congress Party, among others, for failure to
 control inflation, to stem student violence, and to
 eliminate corruption in both the central and state
 governments.  Unable to  offer satisfactory ex-
 planations or to unveil a credible remedial pro-
 gram, the government fell back on rhetoric, and
 malevolent "outside forces," including the CIA,
 were offered as scapegoats. 1

 'J While Mrs. Gandhi still manages easily to elect her
 people to the party's powerful Working Com-
 mittee, the continued intra-party rivalry makes
 the  Congress  a  less  effective and  innovative
 policy-making organization. )
 l-u iPolitics-not  economics-has  always     been
 Mrs. Gandhi's long suit, and in 1972 she devoted
 herself to reshaping the Congress Party. In state
 elections last March she saw to it that, wherever
 possible,  only  politicians  loyal  to her  were
 allowed to run on the party ticket. This resulted
 in the election of officers loyal to her, but in
 many  instances  with  little  personal political
 strength. It produced weak state officials who
 bucked all major, and many minor, problems
 back to the already over-worked prime minister.
 Mrs. Gandhi found herself embroiled in messy
 and politically damaging local situations, such as
 the recent squabbles between groups in the states
 of Andhra Pradesh and Assam. As a result, there
 has been a lack of authoritative direction on
 national  issues  and  factionalism  between
 moderates and radicals within the C
 n     P  t
 On the national level, the political opposi-
 tion, until recently cowed by two massive Con-
 gress victories at the polls, is stirring. Even the
 pro-Moscow Communist Party of India, which
 received Congress help during the last election,
 has begun to criticize the Gandhi government on
 bread-and-butter  issues.  The  Congress,  at  its
 I(j plenary meeting late last month, managed only a
 call for implementation of previously approved
 policies and a vow to end further pie-in-the-sky
 promises, such as Mrs. Gandhi's earlier campaign
 pledge to "eliminate poverty." Mrs. Gandhi can
 count on a substantial measure of goodwill and
 tolerance from among the Indian people, but she
 has yet to offer them the kind of economic
 11 leadership they demand-a situation which, if un-
 corrected, can only hurt her and the     gress
 Party. F_                      rl   25X1

 Prime Minister Mintoff delayed at least tem-
 porarily his threatened termination of the base
 agreement with Britain by "freezing" the situa-
 tion while trying to find a face-saving way out of
 his current difficulties. The time for action is
 short, however, and the parties involved may be
 heading for a showdown this weekend.
 In a series of meetings in the last two weeks
 with various allied representatives, Mintoff has
 several times shifted both his deadlines and his
 demands. The one unchanging-and  key-con-
 dition is that any new agreement provide for the
 equivalent of a ten percent surcharge as com-
 pensation for losses caused when the pound
 sterling was floated. Details, he has implied, can
 he worked out later. Mintoff also wants a guar-
 antee against any further weakening in sterling.
 He has rejected the regular British payment of 3.5
 million pounds due on 1 January because the ten
 percent surcharge was not included.
 Although many Maltese accept the demand
 for compensation as legitimate, they nonetheless
 hope to avoid termination of the base agreement.
 Mintoff has backed down a bit this week, sug-
 gesting that he is under pressure from his cabinet
 and party to avoid a complete break. Public con-
 c_ern  doubtless stems from the fact that
 Mintoff-by his own admission-has failed to
 come up with an alternative to British and allied
 money or another way of gainfully employing the
 nearly 6,000 workers whose jobs grow out of the
 3ritish presence on the island. On 4 January,
 Mintoff flew unexpectedly to Libya-the country
 ire has implied will be his "safety net" should the
 UK withdraw. He may want to determine what
 conditions Libya would impose on any aid to
 Malta.
 few weeks has been erratic. He has responded to
 Prime Minister Heath's notes rejecting Maltese
 demands  with angry outbursts, often  hurling
 bitter invective at one or more of the allied
 ambassadors. At the same time, his formal re-
 sponses to Heath have been polite and even con-
 ciliatory. Moreover, his addresses both to the
 Maltese legislature and to the public have been
 i..alm and give the people little reason to fear that
 he cannot successfully resolve his differences with
 London. Mild support from an influential Cath-
 olic Church newspaper, as well as the unwill-
 ingness of the opposition Nationalist Party to
 challenge the prime minister, has contributed to
 the seemingly optimistic outlook of the average
 Maltese citizen.
 The Italians have taken the lead in trying to
 persuade the alli accommodate
 Mintoff.
 Thelafese
 leader has thus far insisted that any additional
 payment be in cash, since he interprets grant aid
 as "charity."
 M i ntoff's  inflated  perception of  Malta's
 value may have led him to believe that his de-
 mands will be met. If he is operating under such a
 premise-as seems likely-he may shortly find
 himself locked into a public posture from which
 it will be impossible politically to retreat. In such
 a situation, he may allow the British to depart
 from Malta, knowing full well that the withdrawal
 will cause long-term damage to the island's al-
 As was the case during the last period of

 spectrum. To o
 Planning for the New Year
 (The Communists may be planning d neW
 round of attacks in South Vietnam to coincide,
 more or less, with the renewed Paris negotiations.
 Reports to this effect are coming in from around
 the country. Some indicate the attacks will be in
 retaliation for the heavy bombing of North Viet-
 nam; others suggest that the Communists hope to
 increase anti-war pressure in the US. So far the
 fighting countrywide is still light, though there
 has been some increase in the action in the central
 highlands and northern Quang Tri Province.
 Except for northern Military Region 1, the
 Communists do not now have either the strength
 or the field positions for attacks of the magnitude
 of their offensive this past spring. Most of the
 enemy's main combat units in fact have reported
 recurrent logistics and morale problems over the
 past several weeks, and these will probably take
 some time to straighten out. Much of the current
 rhetoric about increased fighting may indeed be
 aimed at bolstering troop morale, which has
 flagged in many front-line outfits since the prom-
 ised October cease-fire failed to materialize. The
 Communists appear to believe that claims of their
 own combat readiness offset the adverse effects
 of allied military action, such as the recent bomb-
 ing in North Vietnam and South Vietnamese
 advances in Quang Tri Province.
 New Controversy in Saigon
 President Thieu's emergency powers expired
 last week, but before they did he issued a series of
 decrees dealing with defense, finance, and com-
 merce. Many of the measures were technical in
 nature, but one-a decree stiffening the require-
 ments for legal political parties-has stirred up
 Saigon political circles. The measure is designed in
 part to force greater unity on the heretofore
 highly  factionalized  non-Communist  political

 membership requirements; new parties must com-
 ply within a year after they begin operating. To
 maintain legal status they will also have to win at
 least 20 percent of the vote in elections for the
 Senate, as well as 20 percent of the seats at stake
 in Lower House elections.
 Only a few of the country's 26 current legal
 parties have any hope of meeting the new criteria.
 Many smaller parties will thus be forced either to
 go underground or to seek alliances with stronger
 parties.
 Some independent and opposition political
 figures are charging that Thieu's primary objective
 is to force everyone to join his Democracy Party,
 but the administration appears unworried by the
 clamor. One of the President's key political opera-
 tives has told US Embassy officers that he expects
 shrill protests, but believes that after a period of
 agonizing, most significant political elements will
 either join the Democracy Party or merge into
 one or two opposition parties. Thieu would like
 to consolidate anti-Communist forces in time to
 face a political struggle with the Communists.

 fully predictable fashion, and the line on the
 cutback  in  the bombing and  Le Duc Tho's
 departure for Paris produced no surprises. When
 the US stepped up its air attacks, Hanoi con-
 derr,ned the bombing, vilified President Nixon,
 and asserted its determination to persevere. On
 the substance of the negotiations it marked time.
 Public pronouncements did little except reiterate
 Hanoi's position that basic changes in the agree-
 ment of 20 October were not to be considered
 and that the US must sign that agreement.
 Le Duc Tho is headed for Paris, and Hanoi is
 advancing the ritualistic propaganda claim that it
 has forced an end to the bombing above the 20th
 parallel and has compelled the US to return to the
 negotiating table. Pronouncements on the nego-
 tiations themselves are fairly free of polemics, but
 continue to avoid any detail on the talks. Radio
 Hanoi, for instance, in a commentary marking
 Tho's departure for Paris, simply praised the
 Communists' negotiating record in general terms
 and said that further progress in the talks was up
 to Washington.

 Peking's Rhetoric Heats Up
 The Chinese said nothing officially in the
 days following announcement of a resumption of
 the talks and the reduction in the bombing, but
 Peking clearly welcomed the moves. In the wake
 of the resumed bombing and the impasse at the
 talks, Peking had signaled a growing concern that
 the bombing might imperil a settlement. The first
 Chinese  reaction was restrained  and  low-key,
 apparently because of Peking's overriding interest
 in avoiding damage to Sino-American relations.
 The Chinese avoided really harsh criticism of the
 Nixon administration, and more importantly, did
 not directly link Vietnam with Sino-American ties
 even on 21 December when they protested bomb
 damage to a Chinese ship in Haiphong harbor.
 By the end of December, however, height-
 ened Chinese concern about the course of events
 in Indochina coincided with the visit to Peking of
 the Viet Cong's Madame Binh, and the combina-
 tion produced the strongest Chinese language on
 the war in over a year. In response to an Ameri-
 can journalist's question, Chou En-lai explicitly
 linked the bombing to Sino-American relations.
 Later, Mao himself received Madame Binh at his
 residence-an  extraordinary  gesture,  since  his
 appearances in previous months had been limited
 to infrequent meetings with visiting heads of state
 and government. The Chinese also staged a rally
 for Madame Binh attended by much of the top
 leadership and some 10,000 persons. The rally
 was not large by Chinese standards, but it was the
 first such demonstration on Vietnam in Peking in
 13 months. Chinese rhetoric at the rally and at
 two receptions for Madame Binh produced harsh
 formulations not heard in Peking for some time.
 While Chinese statements during this period,
 especially the joint communique at the end of
 Madame Binh's visit, edged Peking closer to the
 Vietnamese Communists on some key issues, the
 statements also implied that there was no change
 in Peking's basic view of the situation in Indo-
 china, and that the Chinese still strongly favor an
 early  negotiated  settlement.  In effect, Peking
 embellished the Viet Cong's prestige, strength-
 ened its standing with Hanoi, and registered its
 concern over the war.
 Temperate Reaction From Moscow
 Soviet media have handled the de-escalation
 of the bombing and the resumption of the talks in
 a routine fashion, but the bombing raids in
 December did generate a temporary increase in
 Moscow's attention to Vietnam. Soviet leaders
 condemned the bombing and demanded that the
 US immediately sign the cease-fire agreement.
 The language was pro forma, the minimum the
 Soviets felt they could get away with.
 The two-week visit of Truong Chinh, the
 second-ranking man  in  the North Vietnamese
 hierarchy, was handled in very low-keyed fashion.
 Chinh spent a few days touring the Soviet coun-
 tryside after attending the anniversary celebra-
 tions and departed on 30 December after only
 one publicized meeting with politburo member
 Suslov. It is unusual that Chinh did not meet with
 either Brezhnev or Kosygin.
 To the general observation by Brezhnev on
 21 December that the prospects for US-Soviet
 relations could be endangered by developments in
 Vietnam, Moscow added an indirect warning that
 one specific consequence might be a delay in the
 party chief's visit to the US. In the London
 Evening News of 29 December, Soviet newsman
 Victor Louis, a sometime unofficial spokesman
 for the Kremlin, stated flatly that a visit to the
 US by party leader Brezhnev "was out of the
 questio   until a Vietnam agreement had been
 signed.

 CHINA: TROUBLES AT HOME
 I [The end of the year in China is a time for
 proclaiming past successes and projecting future
 ;goals, and this week the regime's three major
 publications dutifully produced a year-end assess-
 ment in the form of a joint editorial. While it
 devoted more attention than usual to internal
 political affairs, once again the language was
 vague and the tone subdued. To add to Peking's
 problems, the decline in the 1972 harvest was the
 sharpest in over a decade. J'
 /Much of the political strain in China today
 can be traced to Peking's almost paranoid preoc-
 cupation with the campaign to denounce former
 Defense Minister Lin Piao. Designated at one time
 as Mao Tse-tung's official heir, Lin fell in Sep-
 tember 1971 and has subsequently been accused
 in not-so-secret party documents of a variety of
 sins including a conspiracy to assassinate Chair-
 man Mao. Most of China's provincial adminis-
 trators are military professionals, and many evi-
 dently fear that they may still somehow be
 implicated in Lin's alleged coup plot.
 "step-by-step" consolidation of the trade unions,
 the youth league, and other mass organizations. 1
 !Although the New Year editorial was equally
 vague about last year's economic performance,
 earlier official reports admitted a four-percent
 decline in grain production. Output of the most
 ,"important industrial crops-cotton and oil seeds-
 was also down, and the regime is being forced to
 make economic adjustments on a scale not
 required since the early 1960s. So far, these
 adjustments have been  limited to moderate
 increases in imports of grain, cotton and vegetable
 oil, accelerated inter-regional transfers of grain,
 and introduction of programs to save and con-
 serve grain. Ration levels apparently are being
 maintained in most areas, although consumption
 is reportedly down in rural areas where food
 crops were poor!
 ' 'The New Year's editorial this year provided
 scant consolation for these administrators. It
 declared that the campaign against Lin and his
 supporters was the primary task facing the nation
 in the new year. It said, however, the approach
 should be one of "criticism first and rectification
 of work style later," a formulation that suggests
 some elements in the regime wish to temporize on
 a confrontation with local administrators, The
 editorial did retain many of the regime's harsh
 admonitions directed at these local leaders,
 including one sharp criticism directed specifically
 against army men who hold civilian positions.
 This ambivalent language could be another indica-
 tion of a lack of unanimity in Peking.

 KOREA: SLOWER PACE THIS YEAR
 The two Koreas entered 1973 with newly
 reorganized governments ostensibly committed to
 unification, but with old antagonisms and
 suspicions that dim the prospect. In fact, the
 year-old, North-South dialogue may _be slowing
 down after the meetings late last year.,;
 !It is the South Koreans who have put the
 brakes on what had appeared to be rather rapid
 progress. After publicly rejecting persistent North
 Korean requests for a mutual reduction in arms
 and an end to Seoul's anti-Communist legislation'
 the South Koreans have privately ruled out for
 the present a summit or the expanded political
 contacts Pyongyang has been urging. In addition,
 President Pak has instructed his principal nego-
 tiator to adopt a very gradual approach even to
 less sensitiye issues, such as economic and cultural
 exchanges.'
 :Seoul's caution reflects President Pak's con-
 cern that if the talks move too rapidly, some of
 South Korea's domestic or international positions
 may be placed in jeopardy. In particular, Pak
 seems anxious to avoid any agreement which
 would undercut the rationale for a continuation
 of extensive US military assistance. Pak's attitude
 may be influenced by a belief that he can afford
 to limit the scope and pace of the talks now that
 the constitutional changes, which he claimed were
 made necessary by the negotiations, have given
 him a mandate for six more years.T
 SDespite this lack of enthusiasm in Seoul,
 neither side wants to see a breakdown in the talks
 at this point, and both have implied that progress
 in the negotiations can still be made,; In public
 `'statements in the past several weeks, President
 Pak has underscored his willingness to move
 ahead on issues which will contribute to national
 :unifications North Korean spokesman Pak Song-
 chol has pointed out that the dialogue is making
 "definite progress" and has suggested that
 Pyongyang believes further advances can be made
 in time?
 /Although  neither capital anticipates any
 major developments, both are sufficiently flexible
 to allow limited progress on economic, cultural,
 and perhaps humanitarian exchanges. Action on
 even these matters is certain to be slow. The next
 significant high-level meeting will probably not
 occur until February at the earliest.

 BOMBING YIELDS POLITICAL FALL-OUT
 Some  Nordic leaders, particularly of the
 center-left, are trying to turn pro-Hanoi sentiment
 over the bombing of North Vietnam into domes-
 tic political gains.-j
 In Sweden, where Prime Minister Palme
 compared the bombing to Nazi atrocities, Wash-
 ington's strong reaction came as a surprise. The
 US Embassy in Stockholm has been without an
 ambassador since last August, and the Swedes
 were informed that the deputy chief of mission
 would not return to his post from home leave. It
 was also suggested that the new ambassador slated
 to replace Hubert de Besche ought not to come to
 Washington as scheduled.
 Palme countered by spearheading a drive for
 signatures on a petition calling for cessation of
 the bombing and a quick peace settlement. He
 declared that he had no intention of recalling the
 Swedish ambassador or delaying the departure of
 the ambassador-designate. The other political par-
 ties-some of which had been less willing to criti-
 cize the US in the past-found it politic to follow
 Palme's lead. Even the Swedish Trade Union Con-
 federation, which criticized Palme lass: fall for his
 flagging economic policies, sided with him and
 supported the now aborted Nordic Trade Union
 proposal for an all-European boycott of US goods
 and shipping.
 Palme's Social Democrats face a serious chal-
 lenge in elections next September. Recent popu-
 larity                                                                     polls  showed  them  trailing the three
 bourgeois opposition parties. Seemingly unable to
 reduce inflation and high taxes, the government
 will attempt to divert popular attention from
 those domestic issues upon which it is vulnerable
 for as long as possible
 y ;'.Denmark's government, also run by Social
 Democrats, reacted strongly at first, but re-
 sponded with "unspeakable relief" to the news of
 reduced bombing. Nevertheless, the cabinet pro-
 posed on 2 January that parliament allocate
 $725,000 in "extraordinary aid" to the Red Cross
 for use in North Vietnam. While numerous NATO
 countries have donated humanitarian aid to both
 North and South Vietnam through the Interna-
 tional Red Cross, Denmark, along with France, is
 among the first to channel government funds
 solely to Hanoi. This may strengthen the Danish
 leftists, who also advocate defense cults.
 fl/  ;The furor over the bombing in Finland is
 stibsiding, but the government, always seeking
 ways to placate Moscow, seized the excuse to
 recognize Hanoi. Helsinki may hope this will help
 assuage  Soviet  displeasure over  an  eventual
 Finnish tie with the European Communities.
 Leftists in Iceland condemned the bombing
 at a pro-Hanoi rally on 31 December. One Com-
 munist minister reiterated his party's call for the
 withdrawal  of the American-manned Icelandic
 Defense Force, which he termed an "occupation
 force."  The mini-coalition  in Norway, which
 would like to hold together until elections in the
 fall, kept its initial protest mild, though it did join
 ;tan all-party declaration, similar to the one in
 Sweden, calling for a halt in the bombing and an
 end to the war.

 EC FACES TRADE ISSUES
 S,! )Trade policy and preparations for a series of
 multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices
 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
 (GATT) will be high on the agenda of the newly
 enlarged European Community this year. At issue
 in some of these talks will be how much com-
 pensation is due the GATT partners of the EC as
 a consequence both of the inclusion of new mem-
 bers in the EC customs union and of the establish-
 ment of free-trade agreements with those EFTA
 states who have not joined the community. Per-
 haps before the end of 1973 a more far-reaching
 r0and of talks is scheduled to begin and the US
 GATT with the relevant statistical information on
 the EC-EFTA arrangements. There is also uneasi-
 Hpess in the community over both these earlier sets
 of negotiations, however, due to concern that in
 them the EC will in effect be called upon to make
 concessions that could be used for bargaining
 purposes in the later, broader talks-)
 /EC preparations for the general trade lib-
 eralization round are still in an early stage. At the
 working level, the Commission has established a
 special committee to study the issues, but con-
 sultations with the member states have not yet
 hopes that they will result in action to lower      begun. The GATT preparatory committee for the
 tariff walls still further, start eliminating non-c imultilateral trade negotiations will hold its first
 tariff  barriers,  and  reduce  agricultural  pro-  meeting at the end of January in an attempt to

 ,,The community's overall attitude on these-
 3-issues is aggressively defensive, in part reflecting a
 feeling that, taken together, the upcoming nego-
 tiations could have the effect-if not the intent-
 of undoing the enlarged EC. The French, par-
 ticularly defensive, argue that the EC's remaining
 tariff protection contributes to its cohesiveness,
 that the common agricultural policy is funda-
 mental to EC unity, and that there is a need for
 strong regional blocs like the EC, if there are ever
 to be negotiations between "equals.'"]
 /' french views will probably be somewhat
 tempered by Britain, West Germany, and other
 members with strong interests in trade outside of
 Europe. Initially, however, the normal slowness
 of community procedures, complicated by prob-
 lems of reorganizing work in the new EC Commis-
 sion, is likely to create delays that will serve Paris'
 recalcitrance.:'
 /The community's initial  position on the
 GATT negotiations over the consequences of EC
 enlargement is simply that no compensation to
 third countries is required. In the case of Britain,
 for example, the EC argues that the increased
 protection for agricultural products will be more
 ', than offset by lower tariffs on industrial items. A
 vast  community  work load has been  largely
 responsible for the EC's tardiness in providing
 precede the actual negotiations. There seems little
 doubt that the EC as a whole will be wary of
 these preparatory exercises, at least until it is
 clearer what authority the US negotiators will get
 from Congress. In addition, the EC will not be
 very forthcoming on such grinding bilateral issues
 as  US citrus exports.
 PORTUGAL: HOLDING ON
 New administrative statutes, which became
 effective on 1 January, attest Lisbon's determina-
 tion to retain strong control of its overseas ter-
 ritories. The statutes will do little to help Portugal
 meet pressures for a dialogue with independent
 black African states on the future of its African
 provinces.)
 LThe statutes amplify the "Organic Law for
 the Overseas" enacted last April to implement a
 1971 constitutional amendment which promised
 autonomy in provincial affairs. The subsequent
 organic law provided for only limited changes,
 and the  enabling  statutes  indicate  that  the
 changes are in fact window dressing.

 Although texts of the statutes for the seven
 overseas territories may not be identical, the
 statute for Mozambique is probably typical. It
 spells out the duties and powers of the governor
 general and the provincial government, conferring
 on  them somewhat more prestige than they
 formerly had. Lisbon's ultimate veto power and
 political control remain essentially unchanged.
 The governor general has been given the rank-but
 not the title-of a cabinet minister and will hence.
 forth report to the government in Lisbon rather
 than to the overseas minister alone. The pro..
 vincial legislative and advisory organs have been
 expanded and renamed, but the governor general
 retains virtually unlimited legislative authority.
 He may, if he wishes, delegate some authority to
 these bodies.'
 Elections to the new legislative bodies are to
 be held by 31 March. As in the past, some reD-
 CYPRUS: FIVE MORE YEARS
 President Makarios has announced that he
 will seek re-election on 18 February. Under the
 constitution, the archbishop faces an electorate
 made up entirely of Greek Cypriots; Turkish
 Cypriots simultaneously elect the vice president.
 Makarios' election to another five-year term is
 .assured, and there is even a possibility that no-
 body else will file by 8 February, the official
 deadline. This would give him the presidency
 without the formality of balloting:
 The archbishop's enemies will, nevertheless,
 try to discomfit him, since they cannot defeat
 him. They may attempt, for example, to force
 balloting by putting up a relatively unknown
 opponent and then urge large numbers of absten-
 tions. They would hope thereby to demonstrate
 Makarios' dependence on the island's substantial
 pro-Communist vote ilThere is also a chance that
 resentatives will be directly elected. The rest will
 be chosen by various corporative, special interest
 groups, or the governor. New election regulations
 are expected to increase participation by African
 voters although they will remain a minority:'',
 The new statutes are unlikely to satisfy the
 provincial administrators who prefer diminished
 control from Lisbon. Neither will the statutes
 appease foreign critics of Portugal's determination
 to retain its overseas possessions. Furthermore,
 the failure to provide for any real autonomy in
 the future will complicate any effort by Lisbon to
 comply with the UN Security Council resolution
 of last November. The resolution calls upon
 Portugal  to negotiate with the  "parties con-
 cerned" with a view to ending the present armed
 confrontation and granting the territories the
 right  to  self  determination  and  independ-
 supporters of General Grivas, who see Makarios as
 an obstacle to union with Greece, will create
 disturbances.  There have already been 'minor
 shooting and bombing incidents. Security forces
 can probably cope with the Grivasites, but there
 is a danger that pro-Makarios forces will reply in
 kind, building up to a level of violence that would
 be worrisome on Cyprus.[
 A race for vice president was averted in the
 l urkish community when the incumbent, Fazil
 Kucuk, announced he would not stand for re-
 election,  leaving  Rauf Denktash as the only
 candidate. Denktash has been for some time the
 real leader of the Turkish community. He is also

 communal talks, which are now largely dormant

 EGYPT: A BAD START
 President Sadat's  concern  with  domestic
 problems in his speech to the nation on 28 De-
 cember was appropriately prophetic, preceding by
 two days a fresh outbreak: of student unrest. In
 his speech, Sadat warned against further religious
 feuding and stressed the extent of the freedom
 allowed students in Egypt, vowing not to permit:
 the  polarization  of  the  nation's  youth. But
 Sadat's tolerance of "real  democracy" in his
 speech  was not meant to imply tolerance of
 student agitation; shortly thereafter the Cairc
 press announced that a number of students and
 other malcontents had been arrested:
 The arrests led quickly to renewed demon-
 strations. Protests against the arrests began at
 Cairo University on 30 December, and spread to
 other campuses in the capital and to Alexandria
 on 1 January. Demonstrators in the capital on 2
 and 3 January attempted unsuccessfully to break
 through  cordons  of  police  surrounding  the
 campuses, in order to carry their protest to the
 center of Cairo. Reports of up to 120 new arrests
 have circulated in Cairo S.
 The  government  initially  attempted   to
 placate the protesters by  promising speedy dis-
 position of the cases of those arrested and by
 giving assurances that student rights would be
 protected. This was not enough to defuse the
 situation, however, compelling Sadat to suspend
 all university classes on 3 January, a week before
 the mid-year academic break. The closing of the
 schools will  probably  help restore order, but
 further protests are likely before the students are
 dispersedJ
 Anti-regime sentiment among the students
 has never been far below the surface. Unhappiness
 over the government's failure to deal forcefully
 with preparations for "the battle" is endemic and
 the contradiction between promises of greater
 freedom  and  the student arrests fed already ,
 serious doubts about the credibility of the Sadat
 regime.
 The Egyptian President addressed another
 troublesome domestic issue in his speech when he
 returned  to the subject of "the battle" with
 Israel. Trying to answer recent domestic criticism
 that the nation was not prepared for war, Sadat
 announced that he had ordered the cabinet to
 prepare for the "outbreak of fighting." He further
 decreed the establishment of committees for "war
 affairs" in every province and one at the national
 level that he himself would supervise. Additional
 efforts to enlist the aid of Syria, Libya, and the
 other Arab states in "the battle" were promised.
 On the diplomatic front, Sadat pledged an "inter-
 national move" that would remind the rest of the
 world of the responsibilities it bore for Egypt's
 current uncomfortable situation.
 %Sadat has, of course, spoken in these terms
 before; this time, at least, he did not set himself
 any potentially  embarrassing  deadline.
 RHODESIA: SMITH AND THE GUERRILLAS
 The sharp increase in counter-guerrilla opera-
 tions during December reflects in part Prime Min-
 ister Smith's fear that recent terrorist raids could
 be forerunners of serious insurgency. Smith may
 also be seizing the opportunity to dispel com-
 placency among his white constituents and rally
 flagging support for his attempts to gain inter-
 national acceptance for his rebel regime.,
 The  publicizing  of  heightened  terrorism
 began in early December when security authori-
 ties reported skirmishes with a guerrilla band near
 Rhodesia's northeastern border with Mozambique
 and discovery of a sizable arms cache,: Shortly
 before Christmas, guerrillas reportedly raided the
 homes of two white farmers in the frontier zone
 and placed land mines which injured members of
 two  security  patrols.  Announced  counter-
 measures included "a massive counter-terrorist
 sweep," extension of compulsory military service
 for white youths from 9 to 12 months, and can-
 cellation of Christmas leave for all police and
 army personnel

 '+'' The government has stressed that the pre-
 Christmas raids were the first concerted attacks
 on whites since early 1970, that the guerrillas had
 "sophisticated" weapons of Communist origin,
 and that captured raiders have admitted that they
 intended to subvert black Rhodesians.
 Although Mozambican guerrillas have greatly
 extended the infiltration routes available to their
 Rhodesian counterparts, the Rhodesian nation-
 alist  organizations  in  Zambia  have  not  sig-

 through Mozambique because a frontier corridor
 had been opened by Mozambican guerrillas. Al-
 though  spokesmen  in Salisbury assert that
 Rhodesian and Portuguese security forces work
 together smoothly, Rhodesian officials have im-
 plied deepening doubts of Portuguese capabilities
 for suppressing the Front for the Liberation of
 Mozambique. Rhodesian pessimism apparently re-
 flects the fact that Portuguese 'authorities do not
 regard the border with Rhodesia as a high-priority
 area.
 e  uer-
 rilla band that tangled with    o esian patrols in
 late November reportedly was one of four that
 had  been  independently  dispatched      by the
 Zimbabwe African National Union, the smaller of
 the two. Presumably, the raiders were hoping that
 a few hit-and-run strikes would yield enough
 publicity to attract more international support
 Smith  probably  is stressing the terrorist
 menace to help hold white Rhodesians to his
 strategy for gaining Britain's recognition and end-
 ing economic sanctions. Steadfastness, he tells
 them, will eventually regain Britain's concurrence
 in the settlement negotiated in November 1971,
 which London rejected after the Pearce com-
 mission concluded that most black Rhodesians
 were opposed. Steadfastness, Smith hopes, will
 induce "responsible" black spokesmen to approve
 the 1971 accord-or a slightly modified version-
 which in turn will bring the British around. Ap-
 parently Smith also believes that stressing the
 grim alternative of mounting terrorism will induce
 the right wingers in the ruling Rhodesian Front
 Party to swallow whatever concessions must be
 made to win over enough black spokesmen.
 Focusing on terrorism could, nevertheless,
 stir up countercurrents of repression and resist-
 ance. For instance, last fall Smith's government
 sponsored  legislation  that  requires   black
 Rhodesians to carry identity cards and tightens
 restrictions on their physical mobility. The new
 laws were denounced by moderate black leaders,

 ISRAEL-SYRIA: STILL SPARRING
 The Israeli-Syrian border area heated up as
 the New Year approached, after about five weeks
 of inactivity. In the last week of December Israeli
 aircraft twice bombed army and fedayeen bases in
 Syria in reprisal for shellings, mining operations,
 and attempted ambushes in the Golan Heights.
 On 2 January, a Syrian MIG-21, which was trying
 to intercept an Israeli air reconnaissance flight,
 crashed when the pilot ejected after being out-
 maneuvered and evidently before any shots were
 fired.
 ;-The incidents from the Syrian side-SOME,
 fedayeen-inspired and one involving Syrian Army
 artillery-have been minor, and none of them
 produced  any  Israeli  casualties.  Indeed,  Da-
 mascus' actions appear almost perfunctory. Al-
 though Damascus pays lip service to "throwing
 the Israeli occupier out" and permits the feda-
 yeen to lob an occasional shell, it is unlikely that
 the Syrians intend to push the Israelis to the
 point where they respond on a major scale!
 Meanwhile, the frustration of the fedayeen
 at their failure to mount a credible military threat
 against the Israelis is forcing the guerrillas more
 and more into terrorism. Their latest spectacular,
 the 19-hour occupation of the Israeli Embassy in
 Bangkok by four Black September terrorists, was
 less than a rousing success. Although the guerrillas
 did grab the headlines momentarily, they failed to
 secure the release of fellow fedayeen held in
 Israel, their avowed purpose. The Egyptian am-
 bassador in Bangkok interceded to persuade the
 guerrillas to turn over their six Israeli hostages in
 return for safe passage to Cairo
 BANGLADESH: DACCA INTIMIDATED
 'The government, with an eye on the current
 election campaign, has been reluctant to move
 against young leftists who have been attacking US
 government  installations. During the past two
 weeks, mobs of students and other youths, many
 of them affiliated with leftist opposition parties,
 have seriously damaged USIS centers in three
 district capitals and have been demonstrating at
 the USIS building in Dacca, part of which they
 have occupied. They have been protesting the
 resumption of US bombing in Vietnam; they are
 also trying to embarrass the ruling Awami League
 as campaigning for the parliamentary elections in
 March picks up steam.`
 The government response has been erratic.
 Only on 1 January, after demonstrators report-
 edly injured nearly 60 policemen at the USIS
 building in Dacca, did the police act resolutely,

 wise, the government has made little effort to
 block or apprehend the marauding youths. The
 government has been unresponsive to official US
 requests for better protection and has indicated
 that it is reluctant to issue any public: expression
 Of regret for the damage already done. In fact,
 many Awami League leaders even are publicly
 claiming that American and Chinese "agents" are
 somehow responsible for stepped-up agitation
 against the government by student groups and
 opposition parties following the New Year's Day
 shootings.

 trained and ill equipped, they probably have the
 capacity, with the assistance of paramilitary units,

 THE YEMENS: UNITY CLAIMS VICTIM
 The uncertain prospect of uniting the two
 Yemens has resulted in the downfall of the man
 who started it all. Under fire from moderates at
 home since he signed the unity agreement with
 Yemen (Aden) in October, Muhsin al-Ayni sub-
 mitted his resignation as prime minister of Yemen
 (Sana) on 15 December; two weeks later he was
 replaced by Abdallah al-Hajri, a member of the
 three-man ruling Republican Council. Al-Hajri has
 opposed many of al-Ayni's policies and looks
 with skepticism on the possibilities for unity with
 Aden under its current leftist regime.,
 Named as al-Hajri's deputy in the cabinet
 shuffle was Muhammad Ahmad Numan, son of a
 past prime minister and himself a former ambas-
 sador to France. Numan will also serve as foreign
 minister, taking over that portfolio from al-Ayni.
 Two leaders of the Adeni exile community in
 Sana also assumed cabinet posts, joining a third
 exile leader held over from the previous cabinet.
 The  presence  of  these  Adenis  is  probably
 intended  to  give  an  aura  of  unity already
 Dominican Republic
 MILITARY SHAKE-UP
 President Balaguer, aiming to prevent key
 military  subordinates from   developing inde-
 pendent power bases, has once again shaken up
 the top levels of the securiity services. The most
 prominent figures involved are Brigadier General
 Neit Nivar and his archenemy Major General
 Enrique Perez y Perez.(
 Nivar was removed on 25 December as chief
 of national police and is yet to be reassigned.
 Perez y Perez was transferred from the largely
 ceremonial  position  of secretary of state of
 interior and police to the more powerful post of,
 army chief of staff. The new police chief is Brig-
 adier  General Jose Cruz Brea, a colorless Perez y
 achieved, in the event the Sana-Aden talks break
 down.'
 Al
 -Ayni  has  long had  powerful  enemies
 among conservative elements who distrust his
 leftist inclinations. He has never had a power base
 which would enable him to deal effectively with
 these oponents, and his recent dealings with
 Aden, culminating in the unity agreement, gave
 them all the ammunition they needed. Saudi
 Arabia's conservative government also sought al-
 Ayni's removal.
 'Although the new cabinet is already being
 criticized as a tool of the Saudis, moderates in
 Nana are probably satisfied with the new regime
 and particularly with al-Hajri; they will probably
 feel reassured that their interests will be better
 protected  against Aden's leftist machinations.
 Pouring salt on al-Ayni's wounds, the government
 appointed him "adviser on unity affairs" in an
 effort to ensure that, should the talks falter, he
 would be around to take the blame, but al-Ayni
 Perez supporter who formerly headed the armed
 forces intelligence section.
 ~Nivar reportedly was angered by his removal,
 but  Balaguer has since announced that Nivar
 would receive "an appropriate high position" in
 the government. On 29 December, the Dominican
 Senate in "emergency session" created the new
 cabinet post of secretary of state of the pres-
 idency. The incumbent would be directly answer-
 able to Balaguer. This makeshift position looks
 like a good, safe spot in which to neutralize the
 politically ambitious Nivar.

 ARGENTINA: VIOLENT POLITICS
 Terrorism and politically inspired violence
 have   risen  rapidly  and  maneuvering for the
 coming elections has intensified since Juan Peron
 departed for Madrid in mid-December. President
 Lanusse has assured the nation, however, that
 ""nothing and nobody can stop the process of
 constitutional normalization."'
 The Christmas holidays are normally quiet in
 Argentina, but during the Christmas week there
 were two assassination attempts (one successful),
 a  kidnaping,  and several  minor attacks.   The
 attempted  assassination  of  a  Peronist  union
 official stemmed directly from the conflict in the
 Peronist  movement  over    which  faction  will
 dominate  the   election slates. The slaying of
 Admiral Berisso, on the other hand, appears to
 have been motivated by his alleged involvement in
 the massacre of imprisoned terrorists last August
 The kidnaping of Vicenzo Russo, an executive of
 an Argentine subsidiary of ITT, has also been
 attributed to terrorists who asked and received
 more than $500,000 for his release.
 This upsurge in terrorist activity is probably
 designed in part to stampede the military into a
 in the midst of this surge in violence, Argen-
 tine politicians have been scrambling to meet the
 2 January deadline for nominating candidates for
 all national, provincial, and local posts to be con-
 tested in the March elections. Presidential tickets
 now seem set with nine parties or coalitions of-
 fering candidates. Of the nine, only four seem
 capable of pulling the 15 percent: of the vote
 necessary to participate in the realignment of
 slates for the two-way runoff that seems certain
 to be needed on 8 April.'
 The Radical Civic Union seems certain to
 make it into the second round with Ricardo
 Balbin as its candidate. The Peronists, too, are
 assured of going at least that far despite the mass
 disenchantment with a ticket headed by Hector
 Campora.  Former  welfare  minister  Francisco
 Manrique also seems to stand a good chance of
 pulling at least 15 percent of the vote despite
 President Lanusse's efforts to drain off his sup-
 port with the last-minute nomination of air force
 General   Ezequiel Martinez.  The  naming   of
 Leopoldo Bravo, a political leader in San Juan
 province, as Martinez' running mate indicates that
 Lanusse will continue to try to undercut his
 former welfare minister, who is dependent on the
 provincial vote. At the moment, Martinez appears
 the weakest of the four candidates given a chance
 of making it into the runoff, but Lanusse may
 still be able to channel enough funds and support

 failure  to begin  meaningful  consideration  of
 measures against terrorism, the legal committee of
 the  International Civil  Aviation  Organization
 (ICAO) will meet next week in Montreal to seek
 progress on the specific problem of hijacking. The

 already on the books./

 hijackers, with the.suspension of international air
 service being the ultimate sanction. Canada, Italy,
 the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, and the
 United Kingdom have joined the US in'asking the
 legal committee to discuss the draft, although
 some of these countries are not in total agreement
 with it.%

 proposal from the outset-have come up with an
 ingenious diversion.  They  suggest  that those
 provisions of The Hague Convention obligating a
 state either to extradite a hijacker or to prosecute
 him in its own courts be added as an amendment
 to the Chicago Convention of 1944, the basic
 document  governing  ICAO.  Any  member of
 ICAO which violated the new amendment could
 be expelled from the organization, a step that
 would represent "sanctions" of a sort. Paris fears
 that stronger provisions would oblige it to take
 action against Arab states it has been  courting.
 The Arab states violently oppose the strong sanc-
 tions the US has in mind and have hinted that the
 French idea might be more palatable. The Soviet
 Union is against the US proposal on grounds that 25X6
 international sanctions can be imposed only by
 the Security Council. The Soviets might also find
 the French idea appealing,)

 Less than two weeks after independence, the
 new Republic of the Congo was faced with a
 cluster of serious problems-its army had mu-
 tinied, its European functionaries were leaving,
 and its richest province was on the brink of seces-
 sion. On 11 July 1960, three days before the
 central government broke diplomatic relations
 with Brussels, the leader of that province-then
 called Katanga-proclaimed its independence and
 called for "close economic community" with Bel-
 gium. Under Moise Tshombe's direction the seces-
 sion lasted 30 months., until UN military opera-
 tions forced the breakaway regime to surrender.
 Now, almost ten years after the end of that
 secession,  the  province  (renamed  Shaba, the
 Swahili word for copper, in January 1972) has
 lived down its past and is well on the way to
 being fully integrated into the Republic of Zaire.
 The authority of the central government is un-
 challenged-although sometimes resented-and is
 slowly making itself felt in even the remotest
 areas of the region. Domestic and foreign invest-
 ment in Shaba's important mining industry has
 been rising steadily since 1969. The economic
 boom has been lessened somewhat, however, by a
 slump in world prices for copper, which provides
 the vast bulk of Shaba's (and Zaire's) exports.

 Moise Tsho nbe, 11 July 1960
 The territory known as Shaba has always
 been a special case. Its vast mineral wealth earned
 it the status of a semi-autonomous enclave within
 the Belgian Congo.?Through a complex system of
 holding companies and affiliates, private Belgian
 economic interests managed for years to keep
 administrative and political control of the area
 from falling into the hands of either Brussels or
 the colonial government at Leopoldville. In 1933,
 however, administrative control passed from the
 special provincial vice governor to the bureauc-
 racy in Leopoldville. The move provoked a vio-
 lent reaction from the area's Europeans who
 regarded Leopoldville as the symbol of admin-
 istrative  "megalomania"  and  financial                                                                       irre-
 sponsibility.
 Belgian and  Congolese  officials  assumed
 that, after independence, the new Congolese Gov-
 ernment  would take control of                                                                        the  Katanga
 mining industry, crucial to the Congo's economic
 survival. Moise Tshombe and  his powerful
 Katanga Confederation Party had close ties with
 the Belgian economic community and resisted
 such a take-over. Katangans-both native and
 European-distrusted Prime Minister  Patrice
 Lumumba and his government and saw ample
 evidence of its inability to maintain order. Taking
 advantage of the mutiny of the Congo Army, the
 breakdown of central authority, and the outbreak
 of local disorders, Tshombe on 11 July 1960
 raised the flag of secession. Belgium quickly sent
 in troops, ostensibly to protect European lives,
 but primarily to restore order and ensure the
 continuation of economic and administrative ac-
 tivities.                                                                 The  Congolese Government, in turn,

 the arrival of a UN peace-keeping force, it con-
 tinued to give political and material support to
 the Tshombe regime.
 With support from the United Kingdom and
 the   Republic of South Africa as well, the
 Tshombe government was able to maintain politi-
 cal control and, above all, continue mining opera-
 tions. Although the provincial government was
 "Africanized," Belgian technical assistance re-
 mained at a high level. Belgian personnel in
 Katanga remained at their posts, in sharp contrast
 to the mass exodus that took place throughout
 the rest of the Congo. With mineral production
 and sources of revenue thus intact, the Tshombe
 government was able to support extensive tech-
 nical and administrative staffs plus a large army
 led by foreign mercenaries and Belgian advisers.
 While things were fairly settled in the mining
 belt, unrest flared elsewhere in Katanga. For
 example, the Tshombe regime was unable to sup-
 press a large-scale revolt by the Baluba in North
 Katanga. In response, mercenary-led Katangan
 gendarmes carried out a reign of terror from
 which the area has not fully recovered. In the
 South, Tshombe carried out a ruthless and sys-
 tematic purge of all political opposition.
 ...to Integration
 We are ready to proclaim before the world that the
 Katanga secession is ended.
 Moise Tshombe, 14 January 1963
 The Tshombe government finally collapsed
 in January 1963, following a series of highly
 successful military operations by the central gov-
 ernment and the UN. Faced with an imminent
 march on Elizabethville, the provincial capital,
 Tshombe struck his colors and shortly thereafter
 went into temporary exile in Spain. A smooth
 reintegration of the province into the republic
 was held back by mutual suspicion and bitterness
 between Leopoldville and Katanga. The central
 government, under the leadership of Prime Min-
 ister Cyrille Adoula, feared that Tshombe would
 be able to rally his supporters and make a new bid
 for power.
 Special Report
 Even the return of Tshombe in the summer
 of 1964 for a brief sojourn as prime minister at
 President Kasavubu's request did little to lift the
 pressure against Katanga. Tshombe, realizing that
 his presence in Leopoldville provoked fears of a
 "Katangan take-over" among old-line Congolese
 politicians, bent over backwards not to show any
 favoritism toward his home province. He called
 for national  unity and stated repeatedly that
 secession was a thing of the past. Tshombe not-
 withstanding,                                                                          Congolese officials,  bureaucrats,
 and the army were more intent on revenge than
 rehabilitation. With the exception of the southern
 mining belt, the province was virtually ignored.
 Katangans were treated as pariahs; local politi-
 cians were jailed or kept under preventive deten-
 tion. Central government officials and military
 personnel assigned to Katanga were given free rein
 to run the province, and the government closed
 its eyes to their excesses.
 President Mobutu's seizure of power in No-
 vember 1965 did little at first to change the
 situation. Then a gradual shift in the central gov-
 ernment's attitude toward Katanga began. The
 turning point came in 1967 when Mobutu com-
 aleted his nationalization of the Belgian copper
 mines, and Katangans refused, to the evident sur-
 prise and delight of the central government, to
 support an abortive invasion by foreign mer-
 cenaries from Angola.
 Moreover, in 1967 President Mobutu estab-
 lished a countrywide official political party, the
 Popular Movement of the Revolution. This act
 brought to an end his two-year moratorium on
 political activity which he regarded as having been
 at the heart of the Congo's instability. The party,
 besides  being  designed  to  bolster  Mobutu's
 authority, served also to absorb former political
 leaders, including those from Katanga, who were
 considered to be ready for rehabilitation. Katanga
 got its fair share of appointments to the party's
 political bureau and regional organizations.

 its first major opportunity to reach rural Congo-
 lese, many of whom had only minimal contact
 with the government since the collapse of the
 Belgian  administrative system  in  1960.  In
 Katanga, as well as other regions of the country,
 party officials stumped the countryside seeking to
 instill a degree of political consciousness in a
 heretofore largely apathetic population. Although
 Mobutu and the party-approved regional slate for
 the national legislature ran unopposed, a heavy
 voter turnout pointed to a new-found party
 ability to mobilize people, if nothing else.
 Since then, the party has concentrated on
 swallowing up the village and tribal structures
 that provided governmental services during the
 secession and its aftermath, and on transferring
 regional and tribal alliances to the central govern-
 ment. Success has been uneven, because tribal
 loyalties are strong and the central government is
 viewed with deep suspicion. Nevertheless, the gov-
 ernment has enjoyed a measure of success in
 enlisting the support of tribal chiefs, even those
 who once supported the secession. The govern-
 ment has even managed to line up the brothers of
 Moise Tshombe and well-known associates like
 Godefroid Munongo, minister of interior and
 security chief of the secessionist regime. The
 latter was appointed to a government job by
 Mobutu in 1971.
 The tendency toward regionalism, a major
 problem throughout the country's history, has
 been weakened now that all important govern-
 mental posts throughout the country, and par-
 ticularly in the province, are Mobutu appointees.
 They are not natives of the region in which they
 serve and owe their primary loyalty to Mobutu
 and the central government. The capital keeps a
 watch for signs of corruption and mismanage-
 ment, though the watch is not always kept with
 even-handed  dedication. The heavy influx of
 civilian and military personnel from the central
 government, while useful for Mobutu, has also
 increased the chances for political clashes. In
 early 1972, for example, a three-way political
 feud developed among the provincial governor,
 the mayor of the capital city, and the area army
 commander. The feud gave rise to a tangled snarl
 Special Report
 of accusations and counter-accusations and even-
 tually resulted in the dismissal of the mayor on
 grounds  of  mismanagement  and  corruption.
 Despite the charges, the real reason was that the
 mayor came out second best in a personality clash
 with the governor.
 The governor's victory was not very long
 lived. Shortly after the mayor's dismissal, the
 governor himself, regarded by Zairian and foreign
 observers alike as one of the country's best ad-
 ministrators, was recalled to Kinshasa for "grave
 failures" in the performance of his duties. In
 September 1972 he was sentenced to a one-year
 prison term for "anti-revolutionary acts," specifi-
 cally for spreading "malicious rumors" about
 Guinean President Sekou Toure at a time when
 Mobutu was trying to improve Zairian-Guinean
 relations. The new governor, taking his cue from
 the fate of his predecessor, is keeping his head
 down.
 As a result of this sequence of events, many
 provincial leaders have been left with the uneasy
 feeling that the central government, dependent
 upon a president who often seems capricious and
 intemperate, may not be as stable as it appears. It
 certainly makes the central government more dif-
 ficult to deal with. Local politicians, for example,
 were dumbfounded when Mobutu decided to
 change the name of the region in order to "Afri-
 canize" it, even though the old name, Katanga, is
 as African as the new one. Then, Mobutu's at-
 tacks early this year on the Catholic Church,
 which inter alia provides the bulk of the prov-
 ince's social services outside the mining belt, and
 party propaganda that attempts virtually to deify
 him add to the uneasiness of local officials. The
 feeling is general, but so far has evoked little more
 than resigned shrugs; it is not at this time likely to
 be translated into active opposition.
 Another source of uncertainty is the convic-
 tion around that Kinshasa does not keep as tight a
 rein on the local army as it does on civilian
 officials. This is particularly true along Lake
 Tanganyika where survivors of the late 1964
 Simba revolt carry on a low scale but irritating
 insurgency that is little more than banditry. The

 unrest fostered by these dissident groups has been
 increased rather than abated by the abuses of
 ill-disciplined Zairian troops sent in to suppress
 the bandit rebels. In November 1972, army corn-
 mander General Bumba recalled the sector's army
 commander and his staff and the commander of
 the lake guard to answer charges of exceeding
 their authority and mistreating civilians in the
 area of Kalemie. The sector commander's prede-
 cessor had been relieved of duty on similar
 charges five months earlier. Lack of discipline and
 a general contempt for civilians have long char-
 acterized the ranks of the army, however, and will
 not be eradicated by isolated disciplinary actions
 like this.
 Economic Progress
 The economic heart of Shaba is the mining
 belt. The belt provides about 80 percent of
 Zaire's exports and generates 45 percent of the

 Special Report
 central government's revenues? primarily from
 copper. At the time of independence, mining in
 the belt accounted for 75 percent of Zaire's entire
 mineral production. An extensive and well-de-
 veloped rail  and road network supported the
 mining operations, which employed one third of
 the province's 1.6 million people. Shaba also had
 the largest population of European technicians
 and  administrators  of  any  province,  around
 30,000. The industry was valued at $236 million.
 Since 1967 President Mobutu has sought to
 internationalize and diversify mining operations,
 not only as a- means of finding additional capital
 but also to offset the pervasive Belgian presence
 throughout the industry. The government hopes
 that by 1976 domestic and foreign investment in
 mining and related activities will reach $1 billion.
 The state-owned Gecamines (La Generale
 des Carrieres et des Mines du Zaire), established in
 1967  to  replace  the  Belgian-owned  Union
 Miniere, is in the midst of a five-year development
 program designed to increase copper production,
 which reached 406,000 tons in 1971, by at least
 five percent a year. The program calls for an
 investment of $100 million to be jointly financed
 by Gecamines, the Export-Import Bank, and the
 European Investment Bank.
 The largest single foreign source of new in-
 vestment has been and is Japan. In 1967 President
 Mobutu awarded a copper concession to a Japa-
 nese consortium led by the Nippon Mining Com-
 pany.  Operating  through its Zairian affiliate,
 Sodimiza (Societe de Developpernent Industriel et
 Minier du Zaire) the consortium hopes to produce
 about 50,000 tons of copper per year from two
 sites and is expected to begin work at a third site
 in the near future. Total Japanese investment is
 likely to reach $200 million by 1975. At present,
 Sodimiza  employs  about  300 Japanese tech-
 nicians and administrators, although this number
 is expected to decrease gradually as African tech-
 nicians are trained.
 An international consortium, led by Stand-
 ard Oil of Indiana and including British, French,
 and Japanese interests, was awarded a concession

 by Gecamines in 1970 and hopes to be producing
 at least 150,000 tons of copper a year by 1976.
 By that time its total investment is expected to
 approach $300 million.
 Thus, the once-dominant Belgian presence
 has been drastically reduced. Brussels no longer
 participates directly in copper mining operations.
 Through a highly complex system of interlocking
 directorates and subsidiaries, Brussels does op-
 erate a number of small affiliates, such as a
 manganese mining operation near the Angolan
 border. Apart from these affiliates, Belgium no
 longer invests in the mining industry, although it
 continues to handle the international transporta-
 tion and refining of ore from Gecamines. The
 30,000 Belgian technicians and administrators
 who once made Shaba their private preserve have
 been cut to about 1,600.
 Development of the mining industry has
 spurred development in related areas. Top pri-
 ority is being given to the Inga-Shaba power
 project designed to meet the increasing power
 needs of Shaba's industrial growth. The govern-
 ment is studying bids for construction of a
 1,000-mile-long transmission line between the
 Inga Dam near the mouth of the Congo River and
 the Shaba copperbelt. The line is expected to be
 completed by 1976 at a cost of $300 million.
 General Electric, Westinghouse, and an Anglo-
 Belgian firm  have expressed interest in the
 project. In addition, the government plans to
 spend about $100 million expanding and mod-
 ernizing the rail system that serves the mining
 areas. Japan has proposed construction of a rail
 line from Port Francqui to Kinshasa at an esti-
 mated cost of $400 million. Completion of the
 project would provide a direct rail link between
 Shaba and the port of Matadi on the Congo River.
 Not surprisingly, the rest of Shaba has been
 virtually orphaned by the central government.
 Kinshasa prefers to allocate the province's share
 of national resources to the mining belt. Agricul-
 tural production is rising very slowly. The wide-
 spread agricultural network that existed in north-
 ern Shaba was largely destroyed during the dis-
 orders of the secession and has not been restored.
 Special Report
 Most of the area remains tied to self-supporting
 agriculture and barter economies. Transportation
 and communications facilities are slipping down-
 hill since the rate of repair does not keep pace
 with the rate of decay. At present, the only bright
 spots outside the mining belt are a number of
 sizable cotton plantations in northern Shaba, and
 cattle ranching, which has been growing con-
 tinuously since 1967.
 In the longer term, Shaba is likely to be
 caught between over-development of its mining
 industry and under-development of its other re-
 sources. Although copper production was ex-
 pected to be up slightly last year, revenues were
 down sharply because of a decline in copper
 prices. Prospects for a resurgence in the world
 market do not appear good at the present time
 and this colors the economic outlook in Zaire.
 Zaire supplies only about six percent of the
 world's copper and will face stiff competition as
 it tries to increase that percentage.
 Already, the government is finding it dif-
 ficult to attract foreign investors to set up indus-
 trial plants that will draw on the Inga-Shaba
 project. Since there is a world surplus in those
 minerals like aluminum that Zaire would like to
 exploit and since prices for these minerals are
 low, potential investors have been reluctant to set
 up shop in Shaba. The mining industry is steadily
 becoming less and less profitable, but the govern-
 ment is doing little to develop alternate sources of
 income like agriculture and fishing.
 Although the banditry and related arms
 smuggling in the Lake Tanganyika area, combined
 with the government's failure to maintain military
 discipline, has fostered instability in that area, it
 is more of a fragmented nuisance than a cohesive
 threat, and is not likely to spread beyond its
 present limits.
 In spite of all these difficulties, there is a
 sense of confidence in the future of the mining
 belt, both in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. Kin-

 motivated by a belief that the province had to be

 been replaced by a desire to send capable and
