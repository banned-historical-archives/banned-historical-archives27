1. ZHUKOV REPLACED AS SOVIET DEFENSE MINISTER 
There has been no official statement from 
the Soviet Union on the replacement of 
Marshal Georgy Zhukov by .MarshalRodion 
Malinovsky as USSR minister of defense 
other than the 26 October' radio announce-
ment of the shift late Saturday evening, Mos-
cow time,, followed by a brief item pub-
lished on the back page of Pravda on Sunday 
morning. Whether Zhukov has been demoted 
or whether he relinquished the defense post 
in order to assume broader political responsi-
bilities is not yet clear. The longer the delay 
in clarifying Zhukov's position, the greater 
is the tendency to speculate that the change 
'amounts to a demotion for him. 
Western Communist correspondents in Mos-
cow state that a central committee meeting will convene within 
the next few days, possibly on 28 October, to discuss Zhukov's 
status. 
Zhukov reportedly hurried to a meeting 
with party leaders immediately after he arrived back in Mos-
cow from his state visit to Yugoslavia and Albania. Khrushchev, 
Bulganin, and Mikoyan, :who are normally very punctual, ar-
rived nearly an hour late at the Iranian embassy, after having 
had the Iranian ambassador twice change the hour of his recep-
tion. It may have been at this party meeting that Zhukov first 
learned of the decision to replace him as defense minister. 
American correspondents, whose attempts 
to report speculation concerning Zhukov's status were cut off 
by Soviet censors on the 26th, are now permitted to hint at 
a possible demotion.

American service attaches noted an extra-
ordinary number of security and militia personnel and one 
armed MVD patrol at the Iranian reception on the 26th, and 
report that a large number of military officers entered and 
left the Kremlin on the nights of 22, 23, and 24 October. 
Policy differences may have figured prom-
inently in the decision to relieve Zhukov of the defense post. 
General military policy-=for example, the question of economic 
priorities as they affect the Soviet military establishment, and 
perhaps particularly Khrushchev's policy with regard to the 
Middle East situation--may have been an area of serious dis-
agreement. There have been confirmed reports of recent 
differences over long-range economic planning in high echelons 
of the party and government. 
Ambassador Thompson points out that in re-
cent weeks the military press has been carrying a conspicuous 
number of references to the leading role of the party in military 
affairs, and he considers it possible that Zhukov has overreached 
himself in .attempting to establish the independence of the mili-
tary. 
The above evidence, while suggestive of 
Zhukov's demotion, is still not conclusive, and must be weighed 
against the evidence cited in the CIA intelligence memorandum 
of 26 October supporting the view -That the Kremlin would be 
hesitant to demote Zhukov on the eve of the 40th anniversary 
celebration.

2. POSSIBLE EARLY LAUNCHENG OF SOVIET ICBM TEST 
VEHICLE OR EARTH SATELLITE 
Operational activity of an as yet unde-
termined nature resumed on 25 October 
on the Tyura Tam-Klyuchi guided-mis-
sile test range. This activity marks the 
first date since the 3-4 October period, when the Soviet satel-
lite was launched, that activities have been noted involving the 
local Tyura Tam network, the Klyuchi complex, � 
Evidence does not allow assessment as 
to whether the activity on 25 October was a valid countdown  
or only practice;  
October is not available. 
Complete data as to activity on 26 
The first firing at Tyura Tam on 21 
August was preceded by prarticA fltraci r 
an extended period of time  
Assuming that the reported activity is 
valid, however,  from the pattern of the cur-
rent operation, that the activity on 25 October probably was 
practice and could Indicate preparation for the early launching 
of either an ICBM test vehicle or an earth satellite.

3. USSR REPORTEDLY SENDS ARABS "DOCUMENTARY 
EVIDENCE" OF TURKISH PLANS 
Comment on: 
The Soviet embassy in Washington 
is reportedly sending Arab embassies 
and UN delegations "documentary photo-
stats" purportedl showin the Turkish 
e same me, an 
1.%ypt.14.11 news 4.1101JuLLA.,11 trom New York asserted the USSR 
told Arab delegations that it had received accurate informa-
tion that the United States on 21 October sent 300 saboteurs 
to join the Turkish forces on the Syrian border. 
Since mid-October, Soviet spokesmen 
have claimed to possess documentary proof of a US-Turkish 
plan for an attack. Khrushchev told the Syrian ambassador 
in Moscow on 16 October that he had "irrefutable documentary 
evidence" and the TASS statement of 18 October declared that 
"not only the existence of such a plan, but even its concrete 
content has been learned authentically." In his letter to the 
president of the UN General Assembly on 16 October, Gromyko 
referred to "verified data in hand" and strongly reiterated his 
charges to a private meeting of selected Asian UN delegations 
on 20 October. 
Moscow may believe that a dramatic 
move such as publication of _alleged "documeiltary evidence" 
is now necessary to maintain the momentum of its campaign 
against the United States and Turkey in view of widespread 
suspicion of Soviet motives in the General Assembly, the 
Saudi mediation offer, and Ambassador -Lodge's challenge 
Qn22Otber that Gromyko cannot prove his charges.

4, EGYPTIAN COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO VISIT USSR 
Comment on: 
General Abd�al-Hakim Amir, minister 
of defense and commander in chief of 
the Egyptian army, will visit the USSR  
from 1-19 November 
 Amir's recently announced trip, delayed since last summer 
when the Soviet invitation was first received, will include 12 
days devoted to military "visits" and 5 days for "general con-
versations." 
Amir will 
� submit requests for an as yet undetermined quantity of military 
items, including night fighters, radar, and possibly artillery. 
discussions will also be held on the training of 
high-ranking staff officers and pilots. 
Amies projected absence from his post 
as head of the Egyptian-Syrian joint command during the present 
Syrian crisis suggests that Egypt does not expect hostilities on 
the Syrian-Turkish border.

5,. AGGRESSIVE EAST GERMAN ACTIONS CHALLENGE 
STATUS OF WEST BERLIN 
Comment on: 
A new, harder East German policy is de-
veloping which appears designed to strength-
en East Germany's claim to sovereignty and 
to erode away the quadripartite status of Ber-
lin. The regime, apparently with Soviet backing, has taken a 
number of steps in recent weeks aimed at forcing Bonn and the 
Western powers to recognize East German rather than Soviet 
authority over the territory of the German Democratic Republic. 
Probably as a consequence of Khrushchev's strong endorsement 
of the Ulbricht regime last August, the government has recently 
shown markedly greater assurance, both in its tougher domestic 
policies and its more aggressive attitude toward West Germany 
and West Berlin. 
Strong actions affecting access to Berlin taken 
by the regime include: increased controls over interzonal road 
and rail traffic, including confiscation of parcel post and freight 
shipments; generally more stringent controls on Berlin intersec-
tor traffic in violation of four power agreements; the disruption 
of plans for a church coriference scheduled for both parts of Ber-
lin on 26 and 27 October; and threats to assume control over the 
Berlin air corridors used by allied aircraft. 
The East German government reportedly de-
cided not to go through with a plan to seal the Berlin sector 
borders for two weeks beginning at dawn on 26 October, because 
of the disruption of interzonal trade, which is very important 
to the East German economy. 
While most measures to date have affected 
primarily German interests, the US mission in Berlin con-
siders it likely thatiAlliedinterests will be increasingly affected 
if the trend continues, whether or not the Russians add direct 
harassmentS, of their own to those of the East German regime.

6, EAST GERMANY REDUCES ECONOMIC GOALS 
Comment on: 
oals of the East German Five-Year 
Economic Plan (1956-60) for industrial 
production have been reduced from a 
planned increase of 55 percent in output 
by 1960 to 34 percent, according to a 17 
October speech by Party Secretary Walter Ulbricht which 
has just been released. 
Since the inception of the Five-Year Plan 
in 1956, East German industrial production has fallen behind 
plan, largely because the goals for investment, labor pro-
ductivity, and raw materials output were set too high. The 
revised production goals appear to be feasible, but the in-
ternal resources of the East German economy are not ade-
quate for the planned investments, which have been only 
slightly reduced. The Soviet Union will continue to assist 
East Germany, which has received a total of $785, 000, 000 
in credits since 1953.

7. MAO TSE-TUNG'S VISIT TO MOSCOW 
Comment on: 
Peiping's announcement that Mao Tse-
tung will visit Moscow early next month 
in connection with the Soviet anniversary 
celebrations on 7 November paves the 
way for a Communist "summit" confer-
ence among Khrushchev, Mao, Tito, and Gomulka, who rep-
resent the four principal points of view on relations among 
"socialist" states. 
Now that Mao's presence is assured, Tito 
and Gomulka are almost certain to be there. Both Tito and 
Gomulka regard Mao as sympathetic to certain features of 
their individual positions on "different roads to socialism," 
and will look to Mao for some support in their contentions 
with Khrushchev. On the other hand, Khrushchev can count 
on Mao's support for the central issue of "socialist" solidari-
ty against the West. 
Last January and February, Chou En-lai 
visited Moscow and Warsaw with the aim of preventing fur-
ther deterioration in Soviet-Polish relations. Since then, 
Moscow's relations with both Warsaw and Belgrade have im-
proved considerably, in line with Peiping's advice to avoid 
invective and work out problems quietly and gradually. Mao 
will encourage the Communist leaders to continue this course, 
Mao may follow his visit to Moscow with a 
tour of the East European satellites, and there have been re-
ports he will also go to Belgrade.

8. BURMA SET FOR LONG DELAY IN REACHING BORDER 
ACCORD WITH PEIPING 
Comment on: 
Burmese officials appear resigned, in the 
light of Chief Justice Myint Theints recent 
unsuccessful mission to Peiping, to a pro-
tracted period of negotiations before a de-
finitive border settlement with Communist China can be achieved. 
The Burmese are deeply disappointed over 
their failure to nail down a definitive border settlement, In 
the absence of new Chinese incursions into territory claimed 
by Burma, however, Rangoon is in a poor position to take 
drastic steps, such as a renewed press campaign, in an ef-
fort to incline China toward early settlement.

9. SITUATION IN LAOS 
Comment on: 
Laotian Prime Minister Souvanna 
Phouma's efforts toward a quick set-
tlement with the Pathet Lao hit a snag 
on 25 October when the council of 
ministers--the cabinet plus Crown Prince Savang�de-
cided the communique proposed by Souvanna and Pallet 
chief Souphannouvong required major revision to safe-
guard the government's interests. The council also dis-
avowed the political agreement signed on 22 October by 
government and Pathet Lao negotiators which had been 
described by the American ambassador as a "sell-out" 
to the Communists. 
The councils revision of the communi-
qu�ightens loop-holes the Pathets would probably have 
exploited to evade their commitments regarding restora-
tion of the government's authority in the disputed prov-
inces. It also serves to reduce the effectiveness of the 
communiqu�s a propaganda vehicle in the Pathetgl 
neutrality campaign. 
The crown prince believes the revised 
communiqu�ill be unacceptable to the Pathets. They 
may, however, consider that the original draft was so 
favorable that they have latitude in which to negotiate 
further. It seems unlikely that they will react to this set-
back by breaking off negotiations. 
In any event, the Pathets can be expected 
to launch an intense propaganda campaign portraying the 
United States as the only obstacle to the unification of Laos. 
In addition, Souvanna may react by threatening to resign, 
charging that America has frustrated his efforts, and thus 
raise the prospect of another prolonged government crisis 
if a settlement is not quickly achieved.

10. INDONESIAN COMMUNISTS REPORTEDLY DEMAND 
MILITARY CONQUEST OF NETHERLANDS NEW GUINEA 
Comment on: 
Indonesian Communist Party leaders 
are urging their followers to demand 
the conquest of Netherlands New Guinea 
by force of arms if the UN d 
the question in Indonesiatsa favnr  
stallations. 
:ne tone ot speeches 
akiD�fch residents and in-
This report fits into a pattern of official 
government policy aimed at stimulating a powerful popular 
reaction if Indonesia's demands are not approved by the UN. 
Foreign Minister Subandrio, who has just returned from 
New York, has stated publicly that if Indonesia's claim to 
West Irian fails at the UN, "other ways and means must be 
found." In addition the government has proclaimed a "West 
Irian week" and has delegated its preparation to the Youth-
Military Cooperative Body, a quasi-official organization 
which has branches all over Java and includes Communists 
at every level. 
The official program to emphasize the 
West Irian issue has probably been adopted largely at the 
direction of President Sukarno with the full support of the 
Communists. The emphasis on armed force is unlikely 
to result in an invasion of New Guinea, but it may stimu-
late attacks against the Dutch and pnihh st other

11, MANAHAN'S CHANCES FOR WINNING PHILIPPINE 
PRESIDENCY SEEN GROWING 
The American embassy's latest survey 
of the Philippine political campaign in-
dicates that although President Garcia 
  may hold a lead in the race for the presi-
dency, his lead is small and appears to be diminishing. The 
presidential candidates of the Liberal and Progressive par-
ties, Jose Yulo and Manuel Manahan, are, in the embassy's 
judgment, running neck-and-neck. Manahan's popularity, 
in particular, continues to rise and should this popularity 
be converted into votes on 12 November, he may run ahead 
of Yulo and conceivably could win the necessary plurality. 
Although Garcia and Yulo are supported 
by long-established party machines--traditionally the decid-
ing factor in Philippine elections--the embassy believes that 
voters will exercise morejinctependence.of judgment this year 
than ever before. The increased price of rice and other basic 
commodities as well as chronic socio-economic pressures are 
probably playing a major role in electing a "new order" to power. 
Manahan may also be able to play on the continuing popular de-
sire for a "clean new force" which manifested itself in the 1953 
election of the late Ramon Magsaysay. 
Liberal party candidate Yulo reportedly has 
the support of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the Philippines. 
Unless this support involves instructions to parish priests, how-
ever, the embassy believes the parish-level clergy and popular 
Catholic action groups will back Manahan.

120 HEALTH MAY FORCE OUSTER OF TOP SOUTH KOREAN 
LIBERAL PARTY LEADER 
Yi Ki-pung, the leader of the ruling 
Liberal party in South Korea, may 
soon be forced to retire from active 
politics because of his rapidly failing 
health. Yi has been observed to have great difficulty in 
walking or even in standing for more than ten minutes at 
a time. Many of his associates reportedly are urging 
him to relinquish leadership of the party. 
Yi's retirement would almost certainly 
lead to the fragmentation and possibly the disintegration 
of the large but poorly disciplined Liberal party. Many 
party members were recruited by Yi from the opposition 
Democratic party of Vice President Chang Myon and from 
independent circles. Subsequent maneuvering by the var-
ious factions for political advantage could precipitate po-
litical instability which even President Rhee may have 
difficulty in containing.

13, EARLY WEST GERMAN-POLISH INFORMAL TRADE 
TALKS REPORTED 
Comment  on: 
Informal trade talks between West Ger-
man and Polish officials will begin on  
29 October in West Berlin 
Bonn has indicated many times that a 
"first step" in improving relations with Poland would be 
the establishment of a West German trade mission in War-
saw. The government has been strongly criticized by both 
the political opposition and the independent press on the 
groundsthat its diplomatic, break with Yugoslavia creates ob-
stacles to a rapprochement with Poland. An official gov-
ernment periodical recently stated that the break with 
Belgrade did not mean that Bonn would never establish rela-
tions with countries which had recognized East Germany 
"under different circumstances." 
Members of the Polish delegation are 
emphasizing the nonofficial status of the meeting. In re-
cent weeks, the Polish leaders have insisted that the re-
sumption of full diplomatic relations must accompany any 
exchange of trade missions.

14� THE SITUATION IN GUATEMALA 
Comment on: 
Constitutional government was tenuously 
restored to Guatemala late on 26 October, 
but Communists may benefit from the bitter 
divisions among anti-Communist political 
and military forces which were revealed in 
the violent disturbances last week. 
The military junta resigned on 26 October 
and the congress installed Guillermo Flores 
Avendano as interim president until a perma-
nent president can be elected and inaugurated. Flores is the 
constitutional successor to Luis Arturo Gonzalez, the president 
ousted by the junta on 24 October after two days of rioting over 
the disputed, and now annulled, presidential election of 20 Octo-
ber. His installation was the result of an agreement between 
the beleaguered junta and Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes, whose fol-
lowers had nearly succeeded by mob action in forcing the junta 
to relinquish power directly to him. A new presidential election 
is promised for the "near future" and Ydigoras seems confident 
of winning it. He has been assured that, this time, the election 
will be really free. 
The army, formerly a decisive power in 
Guatemala, is now weakened by internal factionalism. The 26 
October "solution" to the political dilemma probably does not  
have the support of more than a bare majority of officers, 
Guatemalan Communists are "delighted" 
with last week's events. They exercise influence in the leftist 
Revolutionary party (PR) and in various labor and student 
groups which were active in the mob action. The PR, which 
has been promised the right to participate in the new election, 
is confident. Many observers believe it might win, especially 
if given time to organize.
