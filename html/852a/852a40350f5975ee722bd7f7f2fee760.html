 ORDER OF BUSINESS-ORDER FOR RECESS UNTIL
 10 A.M. TOMORROW
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, I yield
 myself 1 minute on the bill.
 I yield myself the time to ask the ma-
 jority leader to lay to
 the s child am labor
 down
 amendment and make it the pending
 business.  I am not prepared to debate
 it tonight.  I should like the majority
 leader to give us his wishes.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.      Mr. President, in
 response to the question of the distin-
 guished senior Senator from New York,
 there will be no more votes tonight, be-
 cause I think we are all pretty tired.
 However, I ask unanimous consent
 that when the Senate completes its busi-
 ness today, it stand in recess until 10
 o'clock tomorrow morning.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 BYRD of Virginia in the chair).  Is there
 objection?  The Chair hears none, and
 it is so ordered.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  For the Informa-
 tion of the Senate, there will be no
 morning hour, and at 10 o'clock, at the
 conclusion of the prayer and the reading
 of the Journal, we will go directly on the
 bill and the Javits amendment, which I
 understand will be the pending business
 at that time.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I call up
 my amendment No. 759 and ask unani-
 mous consent that debate on it may be
 suspended until tomorrow.
 The   PRESIDING   OFFICER.  Is
 there objection to the request of the
 Senator from New York?  The Chair
 hears none, and it is so ordered. The
 amendment will be stated.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the reading of
 the amendment may be dispensed with
 but that it be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The amendment (No. 759) is as fol-
 lows:-
 On page 43, strike out lines 14 through 17
 and insert in lieu thereof the following:

 Although  the  struggle  in  Vietnam  has
 paralleled the life of the United Nations, that
 body has been neither willing nor seemingly
 able to influence the course of events there.
 From 1945-54 the Vietnamese struggle cen-
 tered on the issue of colonialism and the
 political  question  of  self-determination.
 After the defeat of French military forces at
 Dienbienphu,    the  cease-fire  and  Geneva
 Accords of 1954 ended colonialism and di-
 vided Vietnam into North and South with
 provisions for subsequent elections.    Such
 elections were not held in either South Viet-
 nam or in North Vietnam.
 Since 1954 the struggle, often brutal and
 cruel in character, has found its focus in
 South Vietnam between forces vying for con-
 trol of South Vietnam.  Each side has re-
 ceived and is receiving external assistance.
 More recently the conflict has been brought
 into North Vietnam, especially through air-
 bombing.

 ably housing starts and automobile sales,
 have fallen off badly.
 I think it is generally realized that
 high interest rates cannot really regu-
 late the economy.  Reliance upon high
 and higher interest rates to curb inflation
 has brought imbalances and inequities.
 Everyone is waiting for the President,
 with the power and prestige of the Office
 of President, backed up as he is by the
 wealth of talent in the Council of Eco-
 nomic Advisers, the Treasury Depart-
 ment, various agencies with credit and
 debt management functions to provide
 the leadership that is needed and neces-
 sary to bring down usurious interest
 rates.  The acuteness of the need for
 such Presidential leadership is "illus-
 trated by the fact that Johnson interest
 rates are now higher than Hoover rates,
 higher now that at any time in 45 years.

 no right to examine the problem, or that
 United Nations action would be Inappropri-
 ate, or that the "Purposes and Principles" of
 the United Nations Charter set forth merely
 general principles rather than more substan-
 tive obligations.
 Technicians can while away weeks, months
 and years on the meaning of the same words
 in different contexts or on thediffering legal
 interpretations of similar actions as employed
 by varying agencies of the United Nations.
 In the meantime men, women and chil-
 dren are being killed in a war which hope-
 fully could be terminated through a collec-
 tive will to act on the part of member nations
 of the United Nations.
 It would be difficult to find phrases more
 descriptive of the United Nations purposes
 than "to maintain international peace" and
 "self-determination of peoples."  The entire
 universe is now aware that Vietnam consti-
 tutes a continuing threat to world order-
 the kind of threat which may lead to univer-
 sal conflagration.  The principals in the Viet-
 namese struggle readily concede that the
 basic question at issue is that of the right of
 the people of South Vietnam to determine
 their own fate.
 In such situation there should exist an
 avenue of appeal to some supreme interna-
 tional authority, as far removed as possible
 from political passions, which can function
 in a mediatory or conciliatory capacity.  The
 United Nations must serve such purpose
 until a better framework is created.
 What has become of the promise of San
 Francisco in 1945 which began:
 "We the peoples of the United Nations
 determined to save succeeding generations
 from the scourge of war, which twice in our
 lifetime has brought untold sorrow to man-
 kind ... ?"
 On June 30, 1936 Haile Selassie made a
 memorable address before the Assembly of
 the League  of Nations pleading for the
 League's intervention, which was not forth-
 coming.  The  League  subsequently  failed
 and World War II followed shortly thereafter.
 The last words of Haile Selassie's fervent
 pleas ever since have haunted mankind:
 "Representatives of the world . What
 answer am r to take back to my people?"
 Wars, and their scope and force have pro-
 gressed trigonometrically  since that time.
 In the event of nuclear holocaust no man on
 earth can be safe.

 I have no doubt that if further names
 come before the Senate for its advice and
 consent with respect to confirmation, the
 hearings in the Committee on Foreign
 Relations will be sufficiently extensive

 with respect to one of the nominations
 now pending before the Committee on
 Foreign Relations, that there will be ex-
 tensive debate on the floor of the Senate
 with respect to whether the individual-
 who is gentleman of great ability and

 on restafflng the rapidly emptying top eche-
 lon of the State Department, but gave no
 hint as to his choices.
 The President announced at his news con-
 ference that he had "tentatively selected" a
 successor to Thomas C. Mann, who :resigned
 in April as Under Secretary for Economic Af-
 fairs, the department's third-ranking post.
 [Question 16, Page 18.1
 Mr. Johnson said that he would probably
 not disclose his choice until after U. Alexis
 Johnson, who ranks fourth in the department
 as Deputy Under Secretary for Political Af-
 fairs, was confirmed by the Senate as Am-
 bassador to Japan.
 Saying  that  "there  will  be  several  an-
 nouncements there" the President appeared
 to  indicate  that he would announce the
 Deputy Under Secretary's successor at the
 same time.
 The President said that there would be one
 or two other vacancies to be filled "below the
 Secretary of State."  He thus foreshadowed
 the impending resignation of Under Secre-
 tary George W. Ball, and gave substance to
 reports that William J. Crockett, Deputy Un-
 der Secretary for Administration, was plan-
 ning to leave the department.
 The President also announced the nomina-
 tion of John S. Hayes, a broadcasting execu-
 tive, as Ambassador to Switzerland.  One or
 two other ambassadorial appointments will
 be announced, he said, as soon as the coun-
 tries to which the prospective ambassadors
 are destined have accepted them.
 Mr. Johnson's disclosure that he had a
 candidate to fill one of the State Depart-
 ment's under secretaryships sharpened spec-
 ulation here as to what the department's
 complexion would be once he had completed
 its most extensive reshuffling in many years.
 Mr. Johnson's reference to changes below
 the secretary level made it clear that he in-
 tended, to keep Dean Rusk where he is.  The
 changes involve the three top policy posts
 under Mr. Rusk, and, If Mr. Crockett leaves,
 the top administrative post as well.
 It is considered virtually certain that Alexis
 Johnsen, who coordinates state operations in
 Vietnam and other critical areas with those
 of agencies such as the Defense Department
 and the Central Intelligence Agency, will be
 succeede-1 by a career Foreign Service officer.
 It is believed likely that a career officer will
 also fill the second under secretaryship--that
 formerly held by Mr. Mann.
 25, 1966
 Although speculatidn has ranged widely,
 the men most commonly mentioned for the
 two jobs-with no clear estimate of which
 man would get which job-are Lucius D.
 Battle, now Ambassador to the United. Arab
 Republic, and Douglas MacArthur 2d, who is
 Assistant Secretary for Congressional Rela-
 tions.
 Two other names mentioned frequently,
 but somewhat less insistently, are those of
 William P. Bundy, Assistant Secretary for
 Far Eastern Affairs, and Ridgway B. Knight,
 Ambassador to Belgium..
 The most important choice, however, and
 one about which there is little informed
 speculating, is that of a successor to Under
 Secretary Ball.
 There has been something of a tradition of
 choosing an Under Secretary whose views
 and style complement, if they do not con-
 tradict, those of the secretary.
 Mr. Ball, for example, has argued for a more
 flexible policy on Vietnam than that advo-
 cated by Mr. Rusk and he was an advocate of
 close European cooperation, a subject that
 Mr. Rusk tends to leave alone.
 Clark Clifford, a foreign policy adviser to
 Presidents Truman, Kennedy and Johnson,
 was reportedly a strong choice for the post.
 His health is not good, however, and his
 appointment is now being discounted.
 Observers here suggest that the President
 is looking for a candidate who will bring, If
 not actually a fresh approach, at least some-
 thing of a fresh image. to the department.
 They suggest further that he should have
 somewhat more appeal to liberals in  the
 Senate and elsewhere than the battle-worn
 figure of Mr. Rusk does.

 FERENCE REPORT
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, I was un-
 fortunately detained off the floor yester-
 day at the time the Senate adopted and
 thus cleared for the President the con-
 ference report on appropriations for the
 Department of Agriculture.  If I could
 have been present, I would have liked
 to have made the following comment.
 While overall the legislation as sent to
 the President has much to commend it,
 I am disappointed that cut from the bill
 was the amendment which I sponsored
 to provide an additional $2.5 million for
 school lunches in needy areas.
 Mr. President, what disturbs me about
 this situation is that while we have been
 responsible in providing funds for the
 school lunch program as a whole-and
 this means lunches in suburbia and in
 the well-to-do neighborhoods as well as
 in the low-income areas-we are short-
 changing the schools in the poor areas
 where a high percentage of the children
 need the free or low-cost lunch.  The
 able Senator from South Dakota [Mr.
 MCGOVERN]  inserted in the RECORD a
 most compelling example of the need and
 value of this effort when the amendment
 was  being considered-RECORD      page
 15118.  He reported on the Annunciation
 Grade School of Denver, Colo.
 Our sense of values is open to ques-
 tion if we are not able to see the need
 for additional expenditure in low-income
 neighborhoods. The hearings being con-
 ducted by the Senator from Connecticut
 [Mr. RIBICOFF]  have made a real con-
 tribution in given us an idea of the scope
 of the problems we face In our urban

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD --APPENDIX        August 25, 1966
 "You can compare Marx with a doctor who
 prescribes a cure for a disease he doesn't
 understand," one Greek official told me.  "He
 wrote his book in the early days of the indus-
 trial revolution.  He did not know what was
 wrong and why. He prescribed a blindfold
 cure. It was all nonsense."
 The economics of the much ballyhooed
 tourist boom in Bulgaria and Romania was
 explained to me by an expert in Greek tour-
 ism which has become a fine art in this
 country.
 The Greeks figure that in order to make
 money a hotel must be busy eight months
 a year.
 On the Communist Black Sea coast the
 weather dictates a season of three to three
 and a half months.  This means that they
 are operating at a loss.  There is no remedy.
 But the Reds continue to build hotels and
 the more they build the more they lose.
 In their anguish to get hard currencies,
 both Romania and Bulgaria are offering bar-
 gain prices for tourists from Western Europe.
 For $200 or $250 one can get from Paris
 to Mamaia or Varna and back and spend
 three weeks at a Black Sea resort.  This im-
 plies a very heavy loss, to their economies.
 "It wouldn't be so bad," said one woman
 who spent a few days at a Bulgarian resort,
 "but the life there is so boring.   There is
 nothing to do after one comes back from the
 beach-nowhere to go, nothing to see, noth-
 ing to buy that one wants or can use, no
 natives to talk to because they are kept away
 from foreigners.
 "That is no vacation."
 In economic terms this means that the
 losses Incurred to the Communist economies
 by Government "give away" tourist programs,
 cannot be compensated in other ways.
 From the Greek frontier to Sophia, the
 capital of Bulgaria there are 100 miles of bad
 road.
 "You can't even get a cup of coffee on that
 road and there are only two gas stations,"
 said the woman.
 Doesn't this cut-rate Communist tourism
 compete with Greece's own business?
 "Not really," said the Athens officials.  "We
 cater to a different type of tourist, people
 who enjoy comfort, good food, good roads,
 good hotels, good sport."
 The Greeks provide accommodations for
 the less well-heeled  tourists.   There are
 hotels and  camps on the mainland and
 around the islands.   Many artists, students,
 etc. come here to work, study or relax.
 "Don't forget, people don't come to Greece
 only for the bathing. There are many things
 to see of great historical and archeological
 value.
 "This is a year-round tourist land."
 Can the Communists continue to operate
 Indefinitely at a loss in the face of this Greek
 competition?
 "Of course not," laughed the Athens of-
 flcial.  "You cannot spend yourself rich."

 DumiTRU DANIELOPOL COMMENTS-GREEKS
 TRADE ON BARTER BASIS
 ATHENS,             GREECE.-"East-West trade a la
 Grec" operates differently from that of other
 Western countries, especially Britain.
 The Greeks exchange goods with their Red
 neighbors under clearing agreements, strictly
 on a barter basis.  They grant no credits.
 And they are not likely to be caught with
 large credit balances if the Communists de-
 fault in their payments.
 With  their economies  teetering danger-
 ously, East European satellites are anxious
 to get long term credits from the West.
 "All Communist governments know that
 their economies have failed," said a British
 expert on Eastern Europe recently.   "They
 are trying hard to bring remedies.  Will they
 be successful?  No one knows."
 Yet Britain continues to export to Eastern
 Europe on long credit terms.
 "We don't do that," said Xenofon Zolotas,
 governor of the Bank of Greece.  "We work
 strictly on a barter basis.  If we don't find
 anything to buy, we stop selling."
 "We buy meat and other anima]: products
 from Romania and Bulgaria," said another
 government official.  "We need high protein
 foods.  They want to sell us tractors.  Every
 one of the Communist countries produces
 tractors which they cannot sell."
 In their haste for Stalinist-type industrial-
 ization. the Communist satelliies are over-
 industrialized-at least in terms of their in-
 ternal market.  They have pauperized the
 majority of the population, especially the
 peasants.
 "Their economies are out of balance," ex-
 plained the London expert.
 The Greeks refuse the Communist tractors
 because they prefer Western manufactures.
 "They are of a better quality and design,"
 one  official said.   "The  Communists  offer
 theirs at bargain prices, but we still don't
 want them."
 "Below cost price?"
 "Of course; they would sell them at a loss.
 They need Western currency desperately."
 The Romanians wanted to buy wheat from
 Greece some time ago, but the Greeks re-
 fused to sell.
 "'We want dollars for our wheat;, but the
 Romanians had none," he explained.
 When  brain-washed  Communists  go  to
 Greece and see the prosperity and activity
 in this non-Communist land they gasp with
 surprise.
 Red diplomats have complained that the
 Greek workers who came to help in the em-
 bassies--plumbers,   carpenters,   painters-
 were "exploiting" them. Their prices were
 too high, the diplomats said.
 The Greek government ordered an inquiry.
 They found that the workers were charging
 strictly Greek prices,
 The Communists gasped.   They couldn't
 believe Greek workers were so well paid.
 Greek wages are between two and three
 times higher than those paid in Commu-
 nist countries.
 "The standard of living in the 'workers
 paradise' is appalling," said a Greek mer-
 chant.
 While meat and other protein foods are
 rationed in the satellite countries, their Red
 governments export them to Greece, Spain
 and other countries.
 "Is there a remedy?" I asked.
 "Not under Marxist ideology," was the an-
 swer.

 Monday, August 22, 1966
 Mr. QUILLEN.                                      Mr. Speaker, it seems
 that we are finding no limit to our In-
 genu.ity when it comes to buying now and
 paying later.
 This administration has set a fine ex-
 ample in how this can be done, and as
 the following editorial from the :Bristol,
 Tenn., Herald Courier indicates, new
 credit schemes appear endless.
 This is really not a laughing matter.
 It is time we got down to serious deliber-
 ations and reversed this trend before it
 runs over us.
 A GLORIOUS AGE WITHOUT MONEY
 One of the glaring deficiencies in the Great
 Society is that there are still a few things--
 not many, of course, but a few-that you
 have to pay cash for.
 It is a pleasure to report that this economic
 oversight is now being corrected.
 In the near future it will be possible to
 walk up to your friendly vending machine
 and buy such necessities as candy, sand-
 wiches, coffee, desserts and other delicacies
 without spending a cent of real money.
 You will merely present a permanent credit
 card which the vending machine registers by
 means of an electronic device.
 The company which plans to introduce this
 further step toward total on-the-cuff. living
 concedes that use of the wonder machines
 may be limited at first to Institutions and
 industrial plants, for the very practical rea-
 son that it will cost a lot of-forgive the
 expression-cash to install them.
 An elaborate electronic memory unit and
 a computer will be needed to enable the
 vending machine to sell stuff on tick.
 This paraphernalia will cost about $2,000
 in addition to the price of the vending ma-
 chines, which itself isn't peanuts.
 With this break-through in the currency
 curtain, it will undoubtedly be only a matter
 of time until such other irritating cash items
 as public phone  calls,  toll fares, parking
 meters and similar hangovers from medieval
 living will be eliminated and we can enjoy
 a glorious age in which we can charge every-
 thing now and pay later.
 The ultimate Utopia will come, of course,
 when some supergenius figures out a way to
 charge now and never pay later.
 Then society will really be great!
 And We Wish Shriver a Happy Future,
 Too
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ALBERT H. QUIE
 OF MINNESOTA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 24, 1966
 Mr. QUIE. Mr. Speaker, under leave
 to extend my remarks in the RECORD, I
 include the following exchange of cor-
 respondence between Mr. Sargent Shri-
 ver and Mr. Leonard Inskip.  I surely
 appreciated the humor of Mr. Inskip.
 Mr. Shriver gave evidence of the ridic-
 ulous confusion that still exists in the
 Office of Economic Opportunity. In just
 a small way it demonstrates that any-
 time you center all authority in Wash-
 ington you create opportunities for gross
 mistakes as well as the ones which are
 small and humorous.
 The letters follow:
 AND WE WISH SHRIVER A HAPPY FUTURE, Too
 (EDrroR's  NOTE.-The  letter immediately
 below was received this week under the let-
 terhead of the Office of Economic Opportu-
 nity (i.e., the headquarters command of the
 poverty war).  The writer of the second let-
 ter-the addressee of the first-who became
 associate  editor of the Tribune editorial/
 opinion page Aug. 1, is a graduate of Middle-
 bury College in Vermont.)
 AUGUST  1, 1966.
 Mr. LEONARD INSKIP,
 Editorial Pages, Minneapolis Tribune,
 Minneapolis, Minn.
 DEAR MR. INSKIP: I am happy to learn that
 you are one of some 20,000 students in Amer-
 lea who have been selected to participate in
 the exciting pre-college program known as
 Upward Bound.  .
 You will meet new responsibilities  and
 challenges as an Upward Bound student. We
 hope you will also find new pleasures and
 excitement in the pursuit of learning.

 The House met at 12 o'clock noon.    The Chair hears none, and
 The Chaplain, Rev. Edward G. Latch,  ordered.
 D.D., offered the following prayer:       . There was no objection.
 I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge
 and my fortress: my God, in Him will I
 trust.-Psalm 91: 2.
 Eternal God, our Father,. who art the
 Creator of the world and the everlasting
 sustainer of our spirits, without whom no
 one 3s wise, no one is good-we pause in
 Thy presence - to invoke Thy blessing
 upon us and to offer unto Thee the devo-
 tion of our hearts.
 Bless us as we meet this day and may
 we be given wisdom to make sound de-
 cisions, strength to walk in the way of
 justice and freedom for all, and good will
 to motivate all we say and do.
 Bless Thou our country and make us
 now and always a people mindful of Thy
 favor, eager to do Thy will, willing to
 obey Thy commandments, and ready to
 live in Thy spirit of love.
 Bless our Armed Forces at home and
 abroad.  Strengthen their families and
 all their loved ones-separated from one
 another as they are; and, as some jour-
 ney through the valley of the shadow of
 death, let them feel Thy strengthening
 presence and Thy comforting spirit.
 May we as the leaders of this free land
 match this devotion by a deep dedication
 of our own spirits to the welfare of our
 beloved country, in the Master's name we
 pray.  Amen.

 THE LATE HONORABLE WADE
 HAMPTON KITCHENS
 (Mr. MILLS asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1
 minute.)
 duty to announce to the House the pass-
 ing on Monday last of one of our es-
 teemed former colleagues.
 Wade Hampton Kitchens, attorney,
 statesman, and veteran of three wars,
 passed away August 22 at the age of.
 87.
 Wade Hampton Kitchens was a Mem-
 ber of the House during the 75th and
 76th Congresses, from 1936 to 1940, and
 was a member of the Arkansas General
 Assembly for two terms.
 Mr. Kitchens was a veteran of three
 wars-the Spanish American War, the
 Philippine Insurrection, and World War
 I.  He was a member of the bar of the
 States of Arkansas, Tennessee, and Okla-
 homa, as well as a member of the Phil-
 ippine bar.  With the exception of the
 period of his military service, he prac-
 ticed law in Magnolia, Ark., from 1909
 until 2 years ago when illness forced
 him to retire.
 Mr. Kitchens was born in Nevada
 County, the oldest of 12 children of
 James Monroe and Margarette Sherrill
 Kitchens.  He attended the University
 of  Arkansas,  Southwestern  Academy
 in Magnolia, and received his law degree
 from Cumberland University.  He had
 taught school in Columbia County.
 Following the Philippine Insurrection,
 Mr. Kitchens practiced law in Lingayen,
 Pangasanin Province, Philippine Islands,
 for 7 years. Then, he his wife, nee Lillie
 Dempsey of Waldo, and his son, Wade
 Hampton Kitchens, Jr., returned to the
 United States in 1909.
 He volunteered in the 2d Arkansas Na-
 tional Guard as an enlisted man during
 World War I.  He helped to organize a
 company of 162 men and was elected
 their captain. He was commissioned by
 Governor Brough as captain of K Com-
 pany, 3d Arkansas National Guard, and
 by President Woodrow Wilson in August
 1917 as captain of K Company, 154th
 Infantry, and served throughout World
 War I for 2 years, 1 year in this country
 and 1 year in Europe.  In 1917 he was
 selected from among over 1,500 officers
 and sent to Washington to a conference
 attended by the Honorable Newton D.
 Baker, Secretary of War; the Honorable
 Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant
 Secretary of the Navy, and others.  This
 conference was concerning the insurance
 of soldiers' allotments and allowances to
 their dependents while at war.
 Wade Kitchens was a member of the
 Central Baptist Church.  He is survived
 by one daughter, Mrs. Gladys Pickens of
 Magnolia, five grandchildren, and six
 brothers and sisters.
 Military services were held for him at
 4 p.m. Tuesday, at Lewis Funeral Home,
 Magnolia, by American Legion Post No.
 3, of which he was a member.  Inter-
 ment was in Columbia Cemetery near his
 birthplace.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE          August 25, 1966
 I am sure that all Members who had
 the privilege of knowing Wade Kitchens
 join me in extending condolences and
 deepest sympathy to his surviving family.
 TRIBUTE TO WADE KITCHENS, SR.
 (Mr. GATHINGS asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. GATHINGS.  Mr. Speaker, it was
 with regret that I learned of the passing
 of Wade Kitchens, Sr. I served with him
 in the 76th Congress, which was my first
 term here.  Wade Kitchens offered me
 kindly advice and assisted me greatly in
 my work as a new Member of the House.
 I needed his counsel and he was ever
 ready to offer it.
 He was a lawyer and a soldier of re-
 nown. He was admitted to the bar after
 his graduation from Cumberland Law
 School, Lebannon, Tenn., in the State of
 Tennessee, and later in the States of
 Arkansas and Oklahoma, and finally in
 the Philippine Islands where he prac-
 ticed for 7 years. He served for 2 years
 in the Spanish-American War and saw
 service in the Philippine insurrection.
 He enlisted in the U.S. Army when
 trouble broke out in Europe, and was
 commissioned a captain of infantry by
 President Woodrow Wilson. His service
 during World War I consisted of 1 year
 in the United States and 1 year in the
 European theater.
 Wade Kitchens served the Seventh
 District of the State of Arkansas in the
 House of Representatives with honor and
 distinction.  The district at that time
 consisted of the counties of Ashley, Brad-
 ley, Calhoun, Chicot, Clark, Columbia,
 Hempstead, Lafayette,  Nevada,  Oua-
 chita, and Union.
 He worked for flood control improve'
 ments on the Ouachita River and for the
 betterment of agriculture. He interested
 himself in legislation with respect to the
 natural resources of his native State,
 including most especially problems hav-
 ing to do with the production and re-
 fining of oil and natural gas. He was a
 dedicated and devoted public servant.
 He possessed a pleasing personality and a
 sense of humor which endeared him to
 his colleagues.
 Mrs. Gathings joins me in extending
 sympathy to his daughter, Mrs. Gladys
 Pickens of Magnolia, Ark., and to his
 grandchildren.
 GENERAL LEAVE TO EXTEND
 Mr. MILLS.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
 imous consent that all Members desiring
 to do so may extend their remarks at this
 point in the RECORD on the subject of the
 passing of Wade Kitchens, Sr.
 The SPEAKER.  Is there objection
 to the request of the gentleman from
 Arkansas?
 There was no objection.
 INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF EX-
 PLORATION  EXPENDITURES  IN
 THE CASE OF MINING
 Mr. MILLS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
 mous consent to take from the Speaker's
 table the bill H.R. 4665 relating to the
 income tax treatment of exploration ex-
 penditures in the case of mining, with
 the Senate amendments thereto, dis-
 agree to the Senate amendments, and
 request a conference with the Senate.
 The SPEAKER. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from Ar-
 kansas? The Chair hears none and ap-
 points the following conferees: Messrs.
 MILLS, KING of California, BOGGS, KEOGH,
 BYRNES of Wisconsin, and UTT.
 PERSONAL EXPLANATION
 (Mr. HANSEN of Iowa asked and was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute.)
 Mr. HANSEN of Iowa.  Mr. Speaker,
 yesterday, August 24, 1966, the House of
 Representatives considered and acted
 upon the conference report on H.R.
 14596, making appropriations for the
 Department of Agriculture and related
 agencies for the fiscal year ending
 June 30, 1967, and for other purposes.
 Due to a conflicting commitment, I
 was not present during the consideration
 and action upon the conference report.
 Had I been present, I would have voted
 ..yea.'
 A PLEA TO THE PROFIT TAKERS
 (Mr. RONCALIO asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute, and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. RONCALIO.  Mr. Speaker, when
 we of this 89th Congress passed the GI
 bill, It was our hope that a great oppor-
 tunity could be provided for veterans who
 now serve their country so unselfishly
 in these difficult days.  However, Mr.
 Speaker, we are finding from many cold
 war GI returnees in the Rocky Mountain
 States the development of a pattern that
 is most disturbing.  Home vendors in
 these difficult times because of the tight
 money policies, because of climbing in-
 terest rates, are apparently placing one
 price on a house to an ordinary buyer
 and a second price on the house when a
 cold war veteran tries to buy it on GI
 financing.
 Sellers attempt to justify this double
 standard by saying that a high dividend
 must be paid by the seller; also stating
 that without larger downpayments the
 overall price must be increased some-
 what. Mr. Speaker, while this, of course,
 is brought on in part by the unreasonably
 high rates these days, all of it does re-
 mind me of Abraham Lincoln's tearful
 observations upon the men taking too
 high and too fat a profit during the Civil
 War:
 Where the carcass is, there will the eagles
 be gathered!
 CORRECTION OF ROLLCALL VOTE
 Mr. DAVIS of Georgia.  Mr. Speaker,
 I ask unanimous consent that the per-
 manent RECORD and Journal be corrected
 to show that I did not vote "yea" and
 rollcall No. 234 on August 22, 1966.
 I was out of the city and did not vote
 on the motion to recommit H.R. 16340,
 though the RECORD reports that I voted
 for the motion.
 The SPEAKER.  Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from Geor-
 gia?
 There was no-objection.
 THE PLANES ARE IN THE AIR
 (Mr. STAGGERS asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. STAGGERS.  Mr. Speaker, after
 6 weeks of idleness, five major airlines
 are once more in operation; their planes
 are in the air; passengers, air freight,
 and mail are speeding to their respective
 destinations; wages are accruing to the
 credit of thousands of employees; reve-
 nues are flowing Into the coffers of the
 various companies.  Nobody lost this
 strike; nobody was penalized; nobody
 was coerced; nobody was victimized; no-
 body lost face. The good old American
 system of free enterprise, free bargain-
 ing, and settlement of differences by ne-
 gotiation has once again been vindicated.
 It works. Without passing judgment on
 the merits or demerits of the terms of
 settlement, it is fair to say that every-
 body concerned gained stature during
 the struggle.
 Almost at the start, the House Com-
 merce Committee was thrust into the
 vortex of the storm. Mr. Speaker, I want
 to pay tribute to the courage and deter-
 mination of the members of this com-
 mittee. They were buffeted by the winds
 of advice and demand from every quar-
 ter of the economic and political environ-
 ment.  The pressure kept up without
 intermission for days.  But they took
 no counsel of hysteria, or panic, or ex-
 asperation.
 On the contrary, they pressed on with
 unwavering steadiness and irresistible
 patience toward a settlement. Through-
 out the negotiations, they comported
 themselves, to a man, in the finest tradi-
 tions of responsible American statesman-
 ship. I am proud to be a member of this
 committee.  Its courage and judgment
 have been tried in the hot fires of con-
 tention, and proved to be the real mettle.
 CORRECTION OF VOTE
 Mr. HALPERN.  Mr. Speaker, On roll-
 call No. 238 I am recorded as voting
 "nay."          I was present and voted "yea."
 I ask unanimous consent that the per-
 manent RECORD and Journal be corrected
 accordingly.
 The SPEAKER. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from New
 WHEN   WILL   SECRETARY   OF
 DEFENSE   ROBERT   STRANGE
 McNAMARA  DEVOTE  HIS FULL
 ATTENTION    TO  THE   WAR  IN
 VIETNAM?
 (Mr. GROSS asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, when will

 But even if there is to be a long and siz-
 able war rather than a phase one struggle,
 only such a Government could make South
 Vietnam an effective partner in waging and
 winning it. And if there is, after all, a nego-
 tiated settlement, only such a government
 could absorb the disciplined cadres of the
 Vietcong, whether as a recognized political
 body or as unreconciled revolutionaries.
 A GOOD TURNOUT NEEDED
 In the shorter run, the Sept. 11 elections
 also could prove important in themselves if,
 in the face of what is expected to be a deter-
 mined Vietcong effort to disrupt and stifle
 the voting, there is a sizable turnout-say,
 something like half of those eligible.
 That would indicate that the Vietcong do
 not control as much of the populace as many
 believe.  And it would suggest that a large
 number of South Vietnamese believe enough
 in a future for their country to take a hand
 in shaping it-despite terrorism on the one
 AN ALL-ASIAN PEACE CONFERENCE:
 AN IDEA WORTH FOSTERING
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, the idea
 of an all-Asia Peace Conference to bring
 about a negotiated settlement of the
 Vietnam conflict is an idea worth fos-
 tering-despite the fact that Hanoi and
 Peking have initially rejected it.  The
 initiator of this idea, Charles Percy, of
 Illinois, is to be commended. The value
 of this initiative is demonstrated by the
 fact that many persons intimately con-
 cerned with foreign affairs have risen to
 support it.  Most notable among them
 are: Thanat ?Khoman, Thailand's For-
 eign Minister, ex-President Eisenhower
 and former Vice President Nixon, a num-
 ber of Senators and Congressmen from
 both parties, and as recently as yester-
 day, President Johnson.
 Though there may be little likelihood
 in the foreseeable future for a nego-
 tiated settlement in Vietnam, this does
 not relieve us of the responsibility of
 seeking peace by all possible means.
 Even though Peking, Hanoi, and the Na-
 tional Liberation Front refuse to talk
 about anything but total South Viet-
 namese and U.S. concessions, our uncon-
 ditional offer of peace talks must stand.
 Only by doing so, can we convince the
 world that our intentions are honorable.
 I have always maintained that the best
 way to solve regional problems is by the
 regional approach, and I have argued
 that regionalism represents the most
 vital kind of reality in contemporary in-
 ternational affairs.  For, regionalism is
 the most productive and acceptable way
 for nations with common problems and
 objectives to join their resources and
 energies into a common effort.
 Beginnings of regionalism are already
 apparent in Asia.  Three such groupings
 are  of  particular  importance.  First,
 there is the Asian Bank, a project which
 has been enthusiastically received by
 Asian and Western countries alike. The
 Asian Bank with an initial capitalization
 of $200 million for the first year will be
 an ongoing operation as of January 1967.
 Its full acceptance by Asians indicates
 that it will be only a first step in.the di-
 rection of greater economic cooperation.
 A second Asian grouping, one that is
 being revitalized, is the Association of
 Southeast Asia, composed of Thailand,
 Malaysia, and the Philippines.  This
 small grouping intends to extend its co-
 operation to all enterprises-political,
 economic,  military,  and technical.
 There has been much talk of late about
 the possibility of Indonesia joining this
 group.  If this occurs, it could be the
 beginning of a solid and lasting nucleus
 for wider Asia cooperation.
 The third, a newly organized Asia and
 Pacific Council-composed . of  South
 Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Japan,
 Australia, New Zealand, Republic of
 China, Malaysia, South Vietnam and
 Laos as an observer-may well be the pre-
 cise   instrument   and                                                      organization
 through which to implement the idea of
 an all-Asian peace conference for Viet-
 nam. If ASPAC's first meeting in Seoul,
 Korea, is any indication of what this
 do, it may develop into a regional orga-
 nization capable of dealing with regional
 security matters without direct U.S. par-
 ticipation.  It may if nurtured, instead
 of being pushed into any rigid ideological
 framework, be the means of bringing
 peace to Vietnam.
 FAIR LABOR STANDARDS AMEND-
 MENTS OF 1966
 The Senate resumed the consideration
 of the bill (H.R. 13712) to amend the Fair
 Labor Standards Act of 1938 to extend its
 protection to additional employees, to
 raise the minimum wage, and for other
 purposes.
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Mr. President, I
 suggest the absence of a quorum.
 The   PRESIDING  OFFICER.  On
 whose time?
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the time not
 be charged to either side.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection., it is so ordered, and the clerk
 will call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, I ask unanimous consent that the
 order for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection., it is so ordered.

 "Therefore, I am today introducing a bill
 to establish a National Commission on Pub-
 lic Management.  My bill is cosponsored by
 Senators DOMINICK, ALLOTT, BENNETT, CASE,
 FANNIN, JAVITS, KUCHEL, MORTON and TOWER.
 A companion measure is being introduced
 today in the other body by Representative
 Moasz of Massachusetts and more than 40 of
 his colleagues.
 "This Commission would bring to bear on
 the management of public business the very
 best minds in private industry, government,
 labor and education.  Its mandate is to an-
 swer two fundamental questions: can new
 management technology aid us in solving
 public problems?     What is the best way to
 do the job?
 "This bill proposes that a National Com-
 mission be appointed by the President in
 order to study and recommend the manner
 in which modern systems analysis and man-
 agement techniques may be utilized to re-
 solve national and community problems in
 the non-defense sector.
 "The Commission would be composed of a
 Chairman, Vice Chairman and eleven other
 members, who shall be experienced in the
 subject matter to be studied by the Com-
 mission,  and shall include representatives
 from government, business, labor and edu-
 cation.           In addition,  the  Commission may
 appoint an Executive Director and any other
 staff personnel required.
 "The Commission would have an active
 life of approximately two and one half years.
 At the end of one year it would provide the
 President and the Congress with a prelimi-
 nary report including a precise description of
 the problems, a preliminary analysis of the
 applicability of these new management tech-
 niques to a wide spectrum of public prob-
 lems, and a detailed plan for continuing
 study leading up to the final report.  Then,
 18 months later, the Commission would sub-
 mit its final report, containing explicit plans,
 including case examples, for applying par-
 ticular management technology to specific
 public problems.  This report would also
 contain  recommendations  for  legislation,
 Federal executive action, and State and local
 governmental action needed to facilitate the
 application of these techniques.
 The Commission would study and investi-
 gate the following major areas:
 "1. Definition of those social and economic
 problems to which the application of the
 'systems approach' appears to hold promise.
 "2. Analysis of the many modern manage-
 ment techniques currently being used in the
 aerospace field to determine those which are
 best suited for application in the non-defense
 sector  and  what  modifications  may  be
 required.
 "3. An assessment of the proper relation-
 ship between governmental and private in-
 vestment in these areas, including the degree
 of public involvement 'and the best proce-
 dures for government support and funding.
 "4. An assessment of the optimum orga-
 nizational relationships among several levels
 of governmental authorities,
 "5, The role of small business and orga-
 nized labor in the application of these new
 management techniques.
 "6. An assessment of potential contribu-
 tions of the universities toward resolving
 public management problems.
 "The tasks of management in both public
 and private enterprise have become more
 complex due to the very nature of the prob-
 lems inherent in a dynamic society such as
 ours, and due, of course, to advances in
 science and technology.  The problems of
 managing even the largest Federal programs
 of a generation ago were small compared to
 those of today.  All levels of government-
 Federal, State and local-are finding it in-
 creasingly difficult to solve their complex
 management problems on a piecemeal basis,
 to a large extent because they lack the man-
 agement techniques and skills that have been
 applied so successfully in private industry.
 "Although there are studies in process
 dealing with the use of systems analysis in
 several non-defense areas, the questions of
 where and how the systems approach is most
 applicable and the problems as to how these
 can best be applied are still largely un-
 answered.  Those   questions   require   the
 attention of a Commission, appointed by the
 President, to include the best minds in the
 field of modern management technology.
 "Some of our distinguished colleagues have
 recently introduced legislation which would
 authorize the expenditure of public funds,
 either directly by Executive Departments or
 through grants to the States, for contracts
 with  universities  or  other  organizations
 which would attempt to apply the systems
 analysis approach to public problems.     We
 fully support our colleagues on the basic
 issue of stimulating governmental support
 for such endeavors, but we also believe that
 a national commission is required first to
 provide the overall analysis and informed
 recommendations  needed  by  all  govern-
 mental authorities who may have reason to
 use the systems approach in the future.
 "The significance of the proposal goes far
 beyond the mere application of systems man-
 agement and the new technology.  The Com-
 mission would be the first step in a major
 new political departure.  What is envisioned
 is the application by private industry of
 these new  problem solving  techniques to
 public policy problems.   By utilizing the vital
 skills of private industry, under contract to
 the government, it is possible at the same
 time  to  solve  these  increasingly  complex
 problems and to attack informatively the
 great problems presented by the constant
 burgeoning of the Federal Government in its
 multifarious aspects."
 RIGHTS, LEADERS AND MARCHES
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.  Mr.
 President, I ask unanimous consent to
 insert in the RECORD an editorial, en-
 titled "Rights, Leaders and Marches,"
 which appeared in the August 23 edition
 of the Washington Daily News.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD
 as follows:
 RIGHTS, LEADERS AND MARCHES
 A half-dozen leaders of rival civil rights
 organizations appeared Sunday on a national
 TV show.                   The experience was not especially
 instructive,  nor  necessarily  constructive.
 Most of these men dealt with tactics, rather
 than goals.
 Their views ranged all the way from the
 realistic appraisal by Roy Wilkins of the
 NAACP, who thinks progress is at work, even
 if  not  fast  enough or broad enough,  to
 Stokeley Carmichael of SNICK, as it is called,
 who would burn down the granary to get at
 the wheat.     Or James Meredith, who talked
 of Negro vigilantes.
 Martin Luther  King,  leading  the   daily
 demonstrations in Chicago, said a court in-
 junction to limit the demonstrations was
 "unjust, unconstitutional and immoral." He
 implied he might obey it only temporarily.
 The court restricted the demonstrations
 to one at a time, to daylight hours, to 500
 marchers and required the demonstrators to
 give 24-hour notice.
 In the circumstances, this was a judicious
 limitation.  Dr. King says the only purpose
 of demonstrations is to "bring issues out
 into the open," and with the public atten-
 tion he gets one parade can do as much as a
 dozen.
 But  the     Chicago  marches  have  been
 marked by fierce violence.  There is no logic
 or excuse in this, but it puts a heavy load on
 police. The court limitation is in protection
 of the marchers.
 Moreover, these marches in business streets
 disrupt traffic, hampering the normal opera-
 tions of those who live in the areas.  These
 people at least deserve reasonable notice of
 the disruption.  Rights are for all, not just
 some, which is the principle Dr. King is try-
 ing to prove.
 These leaders could help their cause by
 more resort to persuasion, education, per-
 sistence and devotion to goal rather than
 tactic; by being less abrasive, less menacing.
 They have made their point: excesses could
 blunt It.
 ACTUAL FIGURES ON NEGRO-
 WHITE ECONOMIC LEVELS
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.  Mr.
 President, I ask unanimous consent to
 insert in the RECORD a column by Bruce
 Biossat,  entitled "Actual Figures on
 Negro-White Economic Levels," which
 appeared in the August 19 edition of the
 Washingotn Daily News.
 There being no objection, the column
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 ACTUAL FIGURES ON NEGRO-WHITE ECONOMIC
 LEVELS
 (By Bruce Biossat)
 Stokely Carmichael of the Student Non-
 Violent Co-ordinating Committee seems to
 be suggesting, in recent public utterances,
 that most whites are comparatively well off
 and nearly all Negroes are poor.
 This generalization, if he intends his com-
 ment                                                                                                                             to be that, represents a vast and mis-
 leading  over-simplification of white-Negro
 economic status today.
 It obscures the fact that in the last two
 decades Negroes have made substantial-if
 still greatly insufficient-economic progress.
 It also conceals the fact that millions of
 whites are very poor.
 PERCENTAGES
 Some social analysts consider a $6000-a-
 year family income the entry point into the
 steadily swelling American middle class.  By
 that measure, about a fourth of the nation's
 5 million Negro families today fall into the
 middle class category.
 In 1940 the figure was only 10 per cent.
 Even as recently as 1950 it was just 16 per
 cent.
 There can be no joy over the fact that this
 clear  progress still leaves 75  per cent of
 Negro families below middle class levels and
 36 per cent of the total below the $3000-a-
 year family income plane-in abject pover-
 ty. Yet, tho it cannot be a consolation, it is
 instructive to note that 40 per cent of the
 country's 45 million white families are like-
 wise below middle class income levels, and
 more than 14 per cent of white families be-
 low the $3000 family income mark.
 ACTUAL NUMBERS
 These percentages, for whites, are much
 lower, but the numbers are high.         Some
 3,750,000 Negro families fall short of middle
 class.  So do about  18,250,000 white fam-
 ilies.                                                                                                                                     Perhaps  6.5 million  white  families
 classify as very poor.
 Furthermore, with all the racial ferment
 in U.S. cities, the notion has taken hold that
 core-city  slums  today are   almost  totally
 occupied by impoverished Negroes.     Housing
 studies show, however, that of 9 million U.S.
 households living in squalor, some 6 million
 are white.   The Negro total is 2.3 million,
 with Puerto Ricans and Mexicans accounting
 for the rest.
 Charges that Negroes are slipping farther
 and farther behind in the income race with
 whites do not seem to be supported by gov-
 ernment income figures.
 In 1947 the U.S. Negro family was earning
 51 per cent as much as the typical white
 family.  A decade and a half later, the per-
 centage had risen to 53 per cent.  That is

 not much "catching up," but neither is it
 slipping back.
 WOMEN'S GAINS
 Income gains for Negro women workers
 account for the modest advance, since male
 Negro workers have held steady at around 55
 to,57 per cent of white male workers' income.
 What. holds                the Negroes' income down
 is the sharp pay differential between Negro
 and White workers doing the same jobs.
 Moreover, the proportionately older white
 population has many more people in their
 middle-range peak earning years than does
 the young Negro population.
 And, of course, the far higher Negro unem-
 ployment rate, especially among teen-agers,
 severely aggravates this situation.
 Catching up obviously depends partly on
 finding millions more jobs for Negroes and
 partly on their elevation into more skilled
 and professional jobs-at pay levels com-
 mensurate with whites.
 Nevertheless, median family income for
 all Americans, white and Negro, rose roughly
 45 per cent from 1947 to 1963 and is still
 climbing.  The Negroes' substantial, share in
 this advance explains why more and more of
 them continue, slowly but surely, to move
 into the American middle class.  They are
 far from income parity with whites, but
 they are on a persistently rising income
 curve.
 AN OPEN LETTER TO NEIGHBORS
 IN SOUTHEAST'S 11TH PRECINCT
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Pres-
 ident, I ask unanimous consent to insert
 in the RECORD a letter written by a resi-
 dent of Southeast Washington and ad-
 dressed to his neighbors in the commu-
 nity.  The letter appeared in the August
 18 edition of the Washington Daily
 News.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD
 as follows:
 AN  OPEN  LETTER TO NEIGHBORS  IN SOUTII-
 EAST'S 11TH PRECINCT
 (The following letter was written by a
 resident  of  southeast  Washington,  Ken
 Smith, of 2422 Elvans Road se, addresed to
 his neighbors in the community.)
 I'm Poor,     I'm not working, even.  I'm
 Negro.   I'm  a  high  school  drop  out.  I
 drink, I smoke and gamble, and I'm a product
 of a broken home ... but I'm not a rebel.
 I love you and my country and community.
 I love life.  I've seen police brutality first
 hand; but on a larger scale I've seen citizen
 brutality.
 "Coming events cast their shadows before"
 is one of the truest sayings in the world.
 And anyone can say "I told you so" after
 things get out of hand.
 But I have a solution to our community
 problem.  It is this:
 First remember, regardless of who you are,
 if you look for trouble you'll find it.  Second,
 each and every one of you, white and colored,
 stop and think, "What am I as an individual
 doing for my community, not what is my
 community doing for me?"  Are you guilty Of
 hanging on corners, creating a nuisance to
 passers-by with rough language and horse-
 play?  Do you hang outside of the liquor
 stores waiting for a sponsor to get your head
 bad on cheap wine and beer?
 Do you hang on your front steps looking
 as unkempt and slovenly as you can?  Do
 you really give a damn where your children
 are, or only when they are arrested? Do
 you pull as many as five false alarms on a
 given week-end night?  Do you harass the
 paper boys who are trying to lift them-
 selves by their bootstraps, and take their
 pennies?
 Did you, in spite, break into the new
 apartment building and tear things apart,
 breaking windows, fixtures, and such?  How     There being no objection, the article
 many windows did you break at ' Moten  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 School, Birney School?  How many rides did as follows'
 You steal on the D.C. Transit buses?   How
 THE BALLOT Box BATTLEFIELD
 many muggings, party crashings, gangs, rapes
 and :rumbles were you in on?                                      (By Tom Wicker)
 Did you come home drunk last Friday and
 curse the neighbors, God and your own
 family?
 What did you do about the dirty apartment
 fronts on Morris Road and other places? Did
 you get up and stick the kids on the front
 porch looking as lost as can be while you
 caught another nap?
 Well, most of us are guilty of some of these
 things and the solution lies with the indi-
 vidual.                                                     He presents his ideas to a group and
 if his ideas are not right then the group's
 ideas won't be right if they adopt his.
 Don't demand until you are ready to offer.
 Don't take until you are ready to give.
 You are not born free socially, or economi-
 cally.                                                     You are born free spiritually and it be-
 hooves each and every one of you to put forth
 the effort to be free socially and economically.
 Youth is no excuse any more than age or
 educational ignorance because we all know
 what hurts us and if it hurts us it hurts
 others also.
 So get off the street corners and stoops, get
 into the churches, Y's, community centers
 and the like.  Hold your heads up, look all
 men in the eye and say I am as good as you
 because I act it.
 Just like the rioter's way of living leads to
 early death  and  destruction,  so does the
 rioter's way of asking for help lead to death
 of ideals and incentive and programs.
 Don't let Chicago and Watts and Detroit
 and Philadelphia be your guideline or ex-
 ample.  "To thine own self be true."
 Remember this: orderly dissent is legal, it
 is soul-searching, and it is productive.  But
 remember that "united we stand divided we
 fall" means united in decency and purpose

 VIETNAM: SOME UNVARNISHED
 PACTS
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, in. an ar-
 ticle which was published in the New
 York Times on August 24, Tom Wicker
 makes an important contribution to
 shedding light on some of the unpleas-
 ant, but nevertheless very real facts
 about Vietnam.  Mr. Wicker's article
 takes almost precisely the position and
 analysis on Vietnam which I myself
 have been making for over a month.
 There is little likelihood of a Vietnam
 settlement in the foreseeable future by
 either a peace conference or a series of
 decisive military victories.  Even when
 our military force becomes predominant
 in South Vietnam, when the Communists
 discover that it is not militarily feasible
 for them to operate in large units, it is
 likely that they will revert to stage one,
 or the guerrilla stage of Mao Tse-tung's
 theory of guerrilla war.  This, in turn,
 points up the real challenges of its in-
 surgency warfare, the real limitations of
 force as the only solution to defeating
 guerrillas.
 The main role of force should be to
 provide a shield of confidence behind
 which the equally real war against social
 and economic_ deprivation can go for-
 ward. It is at the ballot box, through the
 process of legitimizing government, and
 through the worth of the daily lives of
 the people that a guerrilla war Is won
 or lost.
 I ask unanimous consent to have Mr.
 Wicker's article printed in the RECORD.
 WASHINGTON,  August  23.-Reports  from
 South Vietnam now indicate somewhat fewer
 combat incidents involving large North Viet-
 namese units and somewhat more guerrilla
 and terrorist attacks than might have been
 expected.
 On its face, this could suggest that North
 Vietnam and the Vietcong, discouraged at
 the American force and firepower in the
 field against them, are reverting to the so-
 called "phase one" of a war of national lib-
 eration-terror,  assassination,  intimidation
 and political infiltration,  waged by small
 bands in the countryside.
 THE ADMINISTRATION
 This is not accepted here. Administration
 officials-particularly the military-are in-
 clined to think instead that the "spoiling
 tactics" of American troops have been suc-
 cessful enough to keep the opposition's main
 force units off balance and unable to develop
 anything like a general offensive.
 Thus, guerrilla incidents make more of a
 splash than they might otherwise.  In addi-
 tion, the forthcoming South  Vietnamese
 elections probably have provoked increased
 terrorism as the insurgents seek to disrupt
 the campaign and render the voting as mean-
 ingless as possible.
 Finally, infiltration from the north con-
 tinues at a high level, which would hardly
 be the case if there were any Intention in
 Hanoi to pull back its main force units.
 Nevertheless, a growing number of Amer-
 ican officials no longer expect to see the Viet-
 namese war liquidated over a green baize
 conference table, or in some climactic series
 of military confrontations.
 HITTING THE SUPPLY LINES
 Their view is that powerful and mobile
 American                              forces  are  demonstrating  their
 ability to cope with large North Vietnamese
 battle units and that Hanoi eventually will
 recognize that it has little chance to win
 a clash of armies.  Moreover, to the extent
 that the American bombing in the north
 affects the Communist ability to fight in the
 south, it is the big main force units whose
 supply and replacement channels are hardest
 hit.
 Since it is virtually a unanimous belief
 within the Administration that Hanoi never-
 theless shows no indication of either giving
 up that struggle or seeking a negotiated
 settlement, the conclusion of many officials
 is that logic probably will dictate an ulti-
 mate lapse into phase one.
 Such a reversion to hit-and-run guerrilla
 tactics,  with  small,  mainly  native  bands
 ravaging the countryside and terrorizing the
 people, would limit the big American units
 to their lowest level of effectiveness.
 It would make American bombing In the
 north even more meaningless militarily than
 many believe it already is.  And If such a
 development suggested to the American peo-
 ple that the war was subsiding to manage-
 able levels, it might produce far more potent
 pressures on President Johnson to "bring
 the boys home."
 If that is to be the war's future, all the
 more importance must be attached to the
 development of  a stable,  popular,  broad-
 based                                                                                                                                         government  in  South      Vietnam-a
 process that could have its beginning in the
 elections Sept. 11, when an assembly to write
 a constitution will be chosen.
 This is because a new phase one struggle
 obviously would return much of the burden
 of the war to South Vietnam-and only an
 able and respected government, dealing fairly
 and effectively with its people, is likely to
 cope with a determined insurgency that has
 some support in the populace.

 McNamara devote his full attention to
 the wax in Vietnam?
 Task this question because of his latest
 venture  into  the so-called  war on
 poverty. Apparently, since the Johnson
 administration's designated antipoverty
 agency has botched the job, the latest
 ploy is to divert taxpayer dollars sup-
 posedly going for the defense of our
 Nation into a military poverty war,
 where, in true McNamara style, the ex-
 penditures and the results can be classi-
 field as secret.
 Mr. Speaker, this Nation is involved
 in a real war. We are spending billions
 and billions of dollars supposedly in an
 effort to win it,  McNamara has said he
 is  pleased  that  the  war  is  called
 McNamara's war.
 When is he going to stop trying to run
 other operations of the Government and
 climbing mountains, and do the job he
 was hired to do?   Our fighting men in
 Vietnam deserve at least a full-time
 Secretary of Defense, even if he and the
 ning war.
 DEFENSE SECRETARY McNAMARA
 AND THE WAR IN VIETNAM
 (Mr. WAGGONNER asked and was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute, to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. ? WAGGONNER.  Mr.  Speaker
 the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. GROSS]
 has brought to the attention of the House
 a matter about which I have previously
 obtained a special order for this after-
 noon during which I propose to discuss
 the dangerous proposal of the Secretary
 of Defense to train additional personnel
 who do not presently qualify for physical
 or various other reasons to serve in the
 Armed Forces. The proposal raises many
 questions which should be resolved be-
 fore implementation.  We must proceed
 with caution and not allow the military
 to depart or stray from their purpose.
 traveler should pay a higher proportion-
 ate share of the cost of developing com-
 mercial aircraft which will permit him
 to travel at higher speeds and at greater
 luxury.
 Mr. Speaker, I believe that one way or
 another we should proceed with the de-
 velopment of the best kind of com-
 mercial aircraft.  However, public sup-
 port for this program can only be as-
 sured if there is an increased contribu-
 tion by the regular air traveler who will
 enjoy most of the special benefits.
 The  proposed commercial  aviation
 trust fund is patterned after the high-
 way trust fund under which the Inter-
 state Highway System is currently being
 developed. The user tax principle has
 worked admirably to develop an inter-
 state system which is the finest in the
 world. There is no reason why it should
 not work equally as well in bringing
 about necessary improvements in com-
 mercial air travel.

 to assist those directly, immediately, and
 adversely affected by imbalances in a
 factor of production.
 Mr. Speaker, I commend this bill to
 the House for consideration on the part
 of all Members.  From the legislative
 standpoint, my subcommittee will com-
 mence extended, in-depth hearings next
 Week.
 PERSONAL ANNOUNCEMENT
 Mr. HELSTOSKI.   Mr. Speaker, on
 rollcall No. 237, a quorum call taken
 earlier today, I am recorded as not an-
 swering to my name.
 I would have been in the Chamber and
 responding when my name was called,
 but I was at the White House attending
 a bill-signing ceremony.
 The legislation which became law to-
 day relates to the transportation, sale,
 and handling of animals which will be
 used in labroatory experimentation.  I
 have been keenly interested in this legis-
 lation and have introduced a bill to regu-
 late the abuses in this field.  I am
 pleased that it has been signed and is
 now the law of the land.
 Mr. Speaker, I wish that the Journal
 and permanent RECORD  could be cor-
 rected accordingly.
 MPORTATION OF FOREIGN GOODS
 FROM LOW-WAGE AREAS CAUSES
 INJURY TO AMERICAN EMPLOY-
 MENT
 (Mr. DENT asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. DENT.  Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I
 introduced a bill to amend the Fair
 Labor Standards Act of 1938 with respect
 to injury caused American employment
 by the importation of foreign goods from
 low-wage areas. This legislation will be
 a basis for hearings my Labor Subcom-
 mittee has scheduled, beginning next
 week, into this area.
 The intent of the original minimum
 wage legislation is clearly outlined in
 section 2 of the act.  My bill does not
 depart from this intent but, in fact, am-
 plifies it.  The framers then recognized
 the threat of severe wage disparities in
 market competition. They further rec-
 ognized the power of Congress to ap-
 propriately regulate the flow of com-
 merce among the States and with foreign
 nations. The sum and substance of the
 intent was, and has been, to protect the
 economic health, efficiency, and general
 well-being of workers.  This has been
 effectively  carried  out in commerce
 among the States, but severely neglected
 in commerce between our Nation and
 others.
 To provide a partial remedy for this
 situation, my bill asserts the responsibil-
 ity of the Secretary of Labor to recog-
 nize the suffering of workers and com-
 munities because of wage imbalances. It
 likewise provides a vehicle for workers,
 and, any other interested party, to bring
 Federal attention to resulting unemploy-
 ment and community hardship.  Once
 this attention is focused, and there in-
 deed exists a problem, the bill empowers
 the President to take whatever action he
 deems appropriate to alleviate it. This
 action is in addition to any other cus-
 toms treatment provided by law. We do
 not, therefore, infringe upon the estab-
 lished practices of trade or the authority
 of certain bodies to regulate that trade.
 We only provide an additional safeguard
 BILL TO INCREASE TRANSPORTA-
 TION TAX 5 PERCENT
 (Mr. VANIK asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute  and  to revise  and  extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. VANIK.  Mr. Speaker, I have to-
 day introduced legislation to establish
 a  commercial aviation development
 trust fund to pay for a portion of the
 costs involved in developing new com-
 mercial aircraft such as the supersonic
 transport, the cost of which is estimated
 to run in excess of $4 billion.  The legis-
 lation would create the trust fund by in-
 creasing the Federal tax on commercial
 air travel from 5 percent to 10 percent.
 This would raise approximately $140
 million per year.  It Is contemplated
 that the trust fund would bear a portion
 of the cost of developing the supersonic
 transport with the remaining cost paid
 out of the Federal Treasury.
 There is no justification for requir-
 ing the general taxpaying public to as-
 sume the total burden of developing
 supersonic transport planes which only
 a small portion of the public can be ex-
 pected to use.  Certainly the regular air

 The President's budget including the
 request for defense appropriations was
 presented to Congress on January 24 of
 this year. Authorization was considered
 by the House and by the Senate of that
 portion of the bill:which requires author-
 ization. Finally,-the authorization con-
 ference report was adopted on July 12.
 The Committee on Appropriations mar-
 shaled its forces and sought to bring the
 bill to the House as soon as there was au-

 I The original budget estimates were submitted in local currency amounts which were equivalent to $11,975,000.  The original amounts were subsequently reduced to
 $7,348,000 at the request of the Department of Defense.
 The conference amount is below the
 figures in either the House or the Senate
 versions of the bill.  But to be utterly
 frank-and we must-the conference
 amount is above the President's budget
 in the sum of $403 million. This results
 in large measure from the fact that the
 House has approved certain projects
 which were not contained in the budget
 but which were authorized, mind you, in
 the authorization legislation.
 Some of the measures not included in
 the budget and included in the confer-
 ence agreement are as follows:
 Retaining  separate  Army  Na-
 tional Guard and Army Re-
 serve organizations ---------- $67,044,000
 Retain all 25 Air National Guard
 heavy aircraft units --------- 4,300,000

 tion helicopters ------------ 19, 900, 000

 ond ------------------------ 150,500,000
 Provisions for production capa-
 bility for the F-12 intercep-
 tor aircraft ----------------  55, 000, 000
 Procurelnerit   of  aeromedical
 transport aircraft ------------ $16,000,000
 Augmentation    of  Deep  Sub-
 merge program ------------   2, 500, 000
 Additional  funding  for  Ad-
 vanced Manned Strategic Air-

 For the manned orbital laboratory-
 and this House has been strong in sup-
 porting space programs in both NASA
 and the Department of Defense--there
 is an addition above the budget of $50
 million.  The figures generally in the bill
 for space programs of a military nature
 total about $1.7 billion.
 For research and development in the
 field of antisubmarine warfare there is
 $7.5 million above the budget.
 So these are the areas in which we are
 above the budget.
 I think we can say that with respect to
 the major provisions in the bill there is
 considerable unanimity.  It is true that
 in the House version of the bill about
 $569 million was included above the bud-
 get for the pay of about 108,000 men who
 had not been budgeted for and who were
 actually on board at the beginning of the
 fiscal year, on July 1.
 We felt that we should appropriate for
 the pay of these men.  We appropriate
 for the pay of people in various govern-
 signed the authorization legislation on
 July 13.            -
 So, following enactment of authoriza-
 tion on July 13 we brought this bill to the
 floor on July 19 for consideration.  It
 passed the House on July 20.  It went
 to the other body and it. passed the other
 body on August 18.
 The conference met on August 23,
 and here we are, on August 25, con-
 sidering the conference report. In other
 words, it would have been impossible for
 the House of Representatives to have
 considered this legislation in the first in-
 stance prior to July 13, and it was con-
 sidered on July 19.
 I should like to speak briefly about
 what is actually in the conference report.
 The report is below the House version by
 $548 million and it is below the Senate
 version by $122 million.  The compari-
 sons by title and by department are as
 follows:
 ment agencies for the full 12 months; so
 we felt a budget estimate should have
 been submitted for this $569 million, but
 failing to secure a budget estimate for
 these funds, the House put the money in
 the bill.
 The other body decided to omit the
 funds and await a budget estimate.  It
 is. true that we have sufficient money in
 the bill for the pay of all of our military
 personnel for a major portion of the
 year, but not for the whole year.
 It is true that next February or March
 we can, in a supplemental bill, provide
 the necessary money for the pay of these
 additional men who were on board at the
 beginning of this fiscal year above the
 number estimated in the budget.
 It is true, in my judgment, that there
 will be additional men called into the
 service and that we will likewise have to
 provide funds for them.
 It is generally estimated that a supple-
 mental will be required next year for the
 pay of personnel and for the continua-
 tion of the war in Vietnam-unless it
 should unexpectedly end-in the sum of
 $5 to $15 billion.  Nobody knows the
 exact figure, but it is going to be a tre-
 mendous figure.
 While the tabulation of this bill shows
 that it is $790 million below the Defense

 amendment.
 SECTION  612
 Section 612 is a provision which would
 require notification in advance of any
 contracts awarded for advance planning,
 construction, design and architectural
 services costing $50,000 or more.  The
 principal was accepted during the con-
 ference although the cost figure was
 -raised to $150,000.  This would insure
 that in any building the cost of which
 exceeds $2,250,000, Congress would have
 prior notification before architectural
 and engineering contracts were awarded.
 SECTION 613
 Section 613 of the bill relates to base
 closures, and is probably the most impor-
 tant provision in this year's bill. As you
 recall, it requires the Secretary of De-
 fense to make base closure announce-
 ments prior to the expiration of 30 con-
 tinuous days of session of the Congress
 before congressional adjournment.
 I am most pleased to say that the Sen-
 ate conferees accepted the House ver-
 sion. I think this is a significant feature,
 and returns to the Congress certain pow-
 ers which belong in the Congress.
 SECTION 614
 The conferees added a section to the
 bill directing the Secretary of Defense to
 make a further study concerning the de-
 sirability of transferring the Defense
 Language Institute from the Washing-
 ton, D.C., area to the lands formerly con-
 stituting Biggs Air Force Base, Tex., and
 also directed him to make a study of the
 demolition of the four existing piers at
 the Boston Navy Shipyard and the con-
 struction of three new piers and related
 facilities at such shipyard.
 The Secretary will be required to re-
 port to the Committees on Armed Serv-
 ices of the Senate and House of Repre-
 sentatives not later than 6 months after

 and the schools we need, and in those
 things that develop and restore our coun-
 try-we would end up a richer country.
 Mr. Speaker, the answer to the Wash-
 ington Post article,  "After Vietnam,
 What?" is that if we will only bring that
 war to a successful end we will be equally
 or more prosperous and In the long run
 our country will be a hundred times
 richer if we only were to put forth the
 extra effort now going to support the
 war, on the things we need at home.
 Mr. Speaker, we must give to our men
 in service what it takes to win.
 Prosperity or the threat of. depression
 has no place in the consideration of
 Vietnam.
 OPPOSITION TO FIREARMS BILL
 (Mr. OLSEN of Montana asked and
 was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute and to revise and ex-
 tend his remarks.)
 Mr. OLSE'N of Montana. Mr. Speaker,
 for most of the legislative measures
 which come before the Congress, the sup-
 port or opposition from the State of Mon-
 tana is readily apparent.   Montanans
 take pride in participating in the deci-
 sions of their Congressmen and as their
 representative, I am well instructed.
 But, Mr. Speaker, at no time during
 my tenure as a Congressman from the
 western district of Montana have I re-
 ceived such an outright command from
 the citizens of Montana as I have in their
 opposition to the proposed firearms con-
 trol legislation.
 For nearly 6 years I have strongly and
 repeatedly expressed my opposition to
 any Federal gun control laws.  I have
 made my position widely known, both to
 my good constituents, and to my col-
 leagues in the Congress.
 The advocates of the proposed gun
 control bill are undoubtedly sincere in
 their endeavor.  Their efforts to study
 the causes of criminal behavior in the
 United States deserves the broadest ap-
 plause and acclaim. But I do not believe
 that the underlying rational of the bill
 is valid.  I do not believe that the ease
 with which firearms can be acquired is a
 significant factor in the prevalence of
 lawlessness and violent crime in the
 United States.   Experience has shown
 that criminals can, and do, and will, ob-
 tain firearms regardless of restrictions.
 The proposed bill attacks the firearm
 and the legitimate user of the firearms
 rather than the criminal user of the fire-
 arm.   Essentially,  the  proposed bill
 misses the target of its purpose. In ad-
 dition, it imposes unnecessary and bur-
 densome restrictions upon the manufac-
 turer, dealer and legitimate user of fire-
 arms without necessarily achieving con-
 trol of crime.
 Mr. Speaker, this piece of legislation
 brings to mind the spectre of the alco-
 holic prohibition laws which this Nation
 adopted in the early part of the century.
 These measures were ill-conceived and
 impossible to. administer.  Because the
 laws could not be administered effec-
 tively, the legislation adopted was grad-
 ually more and more severe, and the
 police powers of the Federal Government
 No. 142-20
 had to be more and more expanded.
 Finally, in a fit of exasperation, Congress
 threw up its hands and repealed the pro-
 hibition laws outright.
 Mr. Speaker, I have a genuine fear
 that this is to be the fate of any gun
 legislation which the Congress would
 pass.  It is my prediction that if this
 proposed gun law is enacted, there will
 be more severe laws to follow, and again
 the police powers of the Federal Govern-
 ment will be expanded to administer the
 legislation.
 Twenty million legitimate sportsmen
 would be penalized, while illegal gun traf-
 fic among criminals would flourish.
 There is a firm and deep-rooted tradi-
 tion in our history which commands that
 every American should have the right to
 keep and bear arms. This concept is ex-
 pressed in innumerable places, the most
 noteworthy being the U.S. Constitution
 itself. It is, indeed, a stalwart principle
 in annals of the American civilization,
 and we should not tear it down in a blind
 attempt to strike out at crime in our
 country.
 THE 1966 CAPTIVE NATIONS WEEK
 POINTS TO A SPECIAL COMMIT-
 TEE ON THE CAPTIVE NATIONS
 (Mr. DULSKI asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. DULSKI.  Mr. Speaker, over the
 -past month a heavy volume of evidence
 has appeared to justify the description of
 the 1966 Captive Nations Week observ-
 ance as a new high point in this annual
 event.  In so many respects the recent
 week has surpassed all previous observ-
 ances, extending back to 1959 when Con-
 gress passed the Captive Nations Week
 resolution.  Beyond question of doubt,
 this is a good and solid omen of things
 to come as concern the captive nations in
 Central-South Europe, the Soviet Union,
 Asia, and Cuba, Congress' intent to up-
 hold the issue in the basic interests of
 our national security and that of the
 free world, and the future development
 of U.S. foreign policy.
 Millions of Americans have shown in
 this most recent successful observance of
 Captive Nations Week that they are not
 being fooled by the superficial and non-
 essential changes taking place in the Red
 Empire.  The totalitarian Red regimes
 from Moscow down are solidifying and
 consolidating their power, not losing hold
 of it over the suppressed captive nations.
 The 1966 observance also demonstrated
 that large segments of our population
 are not being fooled by the deceptive Red
 strategy of "peaceful coexistence." They
 are very much aware that the Russian-
 inspired cold war is being waged more
 intensively than ever in the underde-
 veloped areas of the world toward the
 objective of extending the Red Empire
 further through Communist takeovers.
 The heavy Russian support of totalitar-
 ian Hanoi, with missiles, technicians, and
 a whole variety of arms used to cut down
 our own soldiers and planes, was high-
 lighted, during the event and advanced as
 19813
 a firm basis for the creation of a Special
 Committee on the Captive Nations.
 Such a committee now would focus
 world attention on the Red Empire and
 its deep involvement in the aggression
 against South Vietnam. With the situa-
 tion becoming more involved in Vietnam,
 the extent of Soviet Russian, and other
 empire aid, to the totalitarian Hanoi re-
 gime must be publicly examined and
 properly assessed. A Special House Com-
 mittee on the Captive Nations would be a
 most effective means to develop all the
 implications of this study and to deter-
 mine required legislation in this new,
 evolving context.
 Mr. Speaker, as a further indication of
 the scope and variety of the 1966 Captive
 Nations Week observance, I request that
 the following selected items be appended
 to my remarks:
 First. The  proclamation  of  Mayor
 Sedita of the city of Buffalo, N.Y.
 Second. The Buffalo Courier Express
 account on July 18, "Parade Honors Cap-
 tive Nations" and the Buffalo Evening
 News accounts of the same day, "Give
 Meaning  to  Heritage  of  Freedom,
 Paraders Urged" and "Marchers Parade
 `Freedopi' Flags of Captive Nations."
 Third. The July 18 report in the COG
 of the Rotary Club of Buffalo titled
 "Freedom Fighter" and the same publi-
 cation's report of July 25 on the Viet-
 namese Ambassador's address.
 Fourth. A press release issued by the
 Buffalo Captive Nations Committee.
 Fifth. The presentation of His Excel-
 lency Dr. Vu Van Thai, at the Rotary
 Club Captive Nations event.
 Sixth. The address of Dr. Nestor Pro-
 cyk on Captive Nations Week.
 Seventh. The article "Buffalo Kiwanis
 Observes `Captive Nations Week" in the
 Link publication.
 Eighth. The texts of the American
 Security Council broadcast network dur-
 ing the entire period of Captive Nations
 Week, featuring among others the Hon-
 orable DANIEL J. FLOOD of Pennsylvania,
 and Dr. Lev E. Dobriansky of George-
 town University and chairman of the Na-
 tional Captive Nations Committee.
 Ninth. A published letter by the ex-
 ecutive  director  of  that  committee,
 which conducts the annual observance,
 Mr. Donald L. Miller:
 PROCLAMATION
 Whereas, the aggressive and overtly hostile
 policies of Russian and Chinese Communists
 have led to subjugation and enslavement of
 a large number of once free and independent
 nations; and
 Whereas, ample proof exists that these un-
 willing captives are desiring liberty and inde-
 pendence from their captors, and have proven
 time and time again their dissatisfaction
 with their fate; and
 Whereas, the powerful deterrent these na-
 tions constitute with their passive as well as
 active resistance by checking and hampering
 the grandiose ambitions of the Communist
 imperialists have been recognized by many
 experts; and
 Whereas, the United States is committed
 to defend freedom and peace with justice all
 over the world because by such stand the
 preservation of our own hard won freedom is
 being guaranteed; and
 Whereas, the freedom aspiring peoples of
 the Captive Nations know that the United

 "We bear a responsibility to understand
 and defend our heritage of freedom under
 the law.
 "Every time you demonstrate respect for
 the law and encourage good citizenship you
 give meaning and substance to our American
 heritage," he asserted.
 The observance in front of City Hall, fol-
 lowing a parade, marked the_ beginning of
 the eighth Captive Nations Week, as pro-
 claimed by Congress in 1969.
 Judge Marshall said the hope of all free-
 dom-loving people is that the human rights
 and dignity of people of Iron Curtain coun-
 tries will be restored.
 Dr. Nestor Procyk, chairman of the local
 observance, said the captive nations "did not
 wish to be occupied and ruled by Russia."
 "This observance is to remind you that all
 the people of these nations are enslaved by
 terror," he said.
 Dr. Procyk said besides giving moral sup-
 port to the captive nations, the observance
 is a time to announce support of America's
 stand in Viet Nam.
 In endorsing the bombing of North Viet
 Nam, Dr. Procyk said the "best strategy is to
 strike the enemy on his own territory.
 "However, we must remember that our
 main enemy is not in Viet Nam but in
 Moscow."
 A proclamation issued by Mayor Sedita
 called for the citizens of Buffalo to observe
 the week "with appropriate prayers for the
 deliverance of the oppressed and subjugated
 nations the world over."
 MARCHERS PARADE "FREEDOM" FLAGS OF
 CAPTIVE NATIONS
 About 400 representatives of eight nations
 held captive by Russia marched eight blocks
 to City Hall Sunday in the name of freedom.
 The  marchers-many  dressed  in  native
 costumes--carried signs and banners remind-
 ing American citizens of the sufferings of
 their people behind the Iron Curtain..
 "Sir, why does that flag have a hole cut in
 the center?" a woman spectator on the cor-
 ner of Genesee and Franklin Sts., asked a
 Hungarian flagbearer.
 "In 1956 the Freedom Fighters cut out the
 symbol of the hammer and. sickle on the
 Hungarian flag to protest their enslavement
 to Russia," he informed her.
 Several of the Captive Nations groups also
 carried signs supporting the United States'
 involvement in Viet Nam.
 Each country had a story to tell:
 Albania and Bulgaria, small Balkan coun-
 tries which fell to Russia after World War II;
 Croatia, "fiercely nationalistic people, who
 have waged strong resistance to Tito's brand
 of socialism, "
 Estonia,  "independent  until  invaded by
 Soviet tanks in an annexation that shook
 too conscience of the world."
 Hungary, whose revolution "sparked pub-
 lic opinion to discussions but too little ac-
 tions."
 Latvia,  "unwilling  satellite;"  Lithuania,
 formed after World War I, lost in World
 War 11; Ukraine, has "sad distinction of being
 the first to be overrun by Communist Rus-
 sian occupants."

 FREEDOM FIGHTER
 The Mayor's Citizens Committee to ob-
 serve Captive Nations Week, under the chair-
 manship of Dr. Nestor Procyk, has invited an
 outstanding Freedom Fighter, Dr. Vu Van
 Thai, Vietnamese Ambassador to the United
 States, to give his views on captive nations.
 This program will be sponsored by the Rotary
 Club of Buffalo at its regular meeting at
 12:00 Noon on Thursday, July 21, in the
 Golden Ballroom of the Statler Hilton Hotel.
 Dr. Vu was born,in Hanlo in 1919.  He re-
 ceived his high school education in Viet-
 Nam and further education was completed
 in France, with an M.S. degree from the
 Sorbonne, Paris.  In 1954. Dr. Vu returned
 to Viet-Nam after the Geneva Agreement
 to join the Vietnamese administration.  Re-
 signed from the Government Service in 1961
 and joined the United Nations Secretariat.
 After the fall of President Diem, Dr. Vu re-
 turned to Viet-Nam and was appointed .rim-
 bassador of Viet-Nam to the. U.S., but de-
 clined the appointment after the military
 coup of General Khanh.  Reappointed Am-
 bassador of Viet-Nam, Dr. Vu Van That pre-
 sented his letters of credence to President
 Lyndon B. Johnson on December 16, 1965.

 Now, therefore, I, Frank A. Sedita, Mayor
 of the City of Buffalo, do hereby proclaim
 July 17-24, 1966 as "Captive Nations Week"
 and call upon the citizens of Buffalo to join
 with their fellow citizens in observing this

 PARADE HONORS CAPTIVE NATIONS
 County Judge Frederick M. Marshall told
 an audience in Niagara Sq. Sunday after-
 noon, following a parade inaugurating Cap-
 tive Nations Week, that "there is no greater
 privilege than American citizenship."
 The parade featured costumed groups from
 eight nations which have fallen under the
 yoke of the Soviet Union.  Police estimated
 1,500 persons viewed the parade which began
 at Main and Tupper and proceeded south
 In  Main  St. to Genesee St., and west in
 Judge Marshall noted, "With the privilege
 of citizenship, however, comes the equal re-
 sponsibility to understand and defend free-
 dom under our laws."
 "Every time you or I show respect for the
 law and practice good citizenship we give
 further meaning to the American way of
 life," Judge Marshall added.
 The crowd broke into applause when he
 said "It is your desire, and that of Americans
 everywhere, that your loved ones in the Com-
 munist countries may be able to taste free-
 dom and liberty."
 TIME TO REFLECT
 Judge Marshall called the day, "a time
 for reflection, thanksgiving and a rededi-
 cation to the principles of democracy."
 Dr. Nestor Procyk, assistant director of the
 West Seneca State School and chairman of
 the Citizens Committee to Observe Captive
 Nations Week, said "This celebration con-
 tributes to a better understanding of the
 needs of the people behind the Iron Curtain."
 H. Buswell Roberts, senior deputy corpora-
 tion counsel for Buffalo, served as master of
 ceremonies and introduced Judge Marshall.
 Captive Nations week will also be observed
 at noon Wednesday when John R. Pillion,
 former representative of the 39th Congres-
 sional District, will receive the Citizens Com-
 mittee to Observe Captive Nations Week
 Freedom Award at a luncheon in the Ter-
 race Room of the Hotel Statler Hilton.

 "We have become so accustomed to free-

 County Judge Frederick M. Marshall.
 President Bill presided at this distinctive
 meeting observing "Captive Nations Week".
 Earl Sidler, II, Senior Minister of Delaware

 All sang the fourth stanza of our National
 Anthem and Les Erlenbach played the Na-

 President Bill welcomed the visitors to our
 meeting and reminded us of the Sunshine
 Day activities this afternoon at Cradle Beach
 Camp, and the dinner at Spooner Smith's
 Woodbrook Farm in Derby.
 Roster Chairman Rog Davis gave No. 2
 copy of our new Roster to President Bill.
 Since the  1966-67  Roster  is  dedicated to
 Fenton M. Parke, the No. 1 copy had pre-
 viously been presented to him in the hospital.
 Jim Maxson served as Sergeant-at-Arms
 and welcomed   the  most    distant  traveler,
 Alberto Berra DiBerra,  San Paulo, Brazil,
 who spoke briefly in Italian.
 Among the distinguished guests at the
 head table was Mayor Frank A. Sedita who
 spoke briefly and presented our speaker with
 a Bison statuette, symbolic of the City of
 Buffalo.
 Next President Bill called on Dr. Nestor
 Procyk, Chairman of the Citizens' Commit-
 tee to observe Captive Nations Week, who
 introduced our speaker, His Excellency, Dr.
 Vu Van Thai, Ambassador to the United
 States from the Republic of Viet Nam.
 Ambassador Thai stated that in the past
 25 years, since World War II, Viet Nam has
 had a constant struggle with colonialism and
 then communism.  Viet Nam came very close
 to becoming a captive nation, until a few
 years ago.
 The was in Viet Nam is the only open
 confrontation with communism in South-
 east Asia.  Burma, The Philippines, and
 Laos have had and still have problems with
 communist guerrilla warfare.  The conflict
 in Viet Nam is having a considerable effect
 on communist policy in  other  Southeast
 Asian countries.
 A serious contradiction in the communist
 world between nationalism and international
 communism has developed with the use of
 communist   China   as  a   challenge of
 Russia.  This contradiction has been ac-
 celerated by the Viet Nam struggle.
 Ambassador Thai quoted a statement from
 an official of Singapore that South Viet-
 namese are dying, not only for their country
 but also so that the Viet Nam conflict will'
 not be repeated elsewhere.
 PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY BUFFALO CAPTIVE
 NATIONS  COMMITTEE
 Ever since the enactment of Public Law
 86-90 in 1959, popularly known as Captive
 Nations Week, Buffalo has been in the fore-
 front in complying with the provisions of this
 important law.   This year, as in previous
 years, the week of July 17-24 was marked by
 activities to promulgate the ideas written
 into law by giving moral support to the peo-
 ples held in Russian or Chinese captivity.
 The Week's program started Sunday, July
 17, 66 with a parade and motorcade which
 proceeded to the City Hall.  The official civic
 opening of the Captive Nations Week was

 Church and the Communist State of Yugo-
 slavia.
 Two other interesting examples are Hun-
 gary and Czechoslovakia.  Hungary has, of
 course, dominantly a Catholic people, but it
 also has  large  Calvinist  and  Lutheran
 Churches. Czechoslovakia has reported now
 quite a revival of religion. For example, it is
 now the fashion in Czechoslovakia for a
 large number of young people to have their-
 marriages celebrated in church.                           This is a
 very interesting development which indicates
 that religion has not lost its vitality and its
 potential, although it has been-particularly
 the Catholic part of religion in Czechoslo-
 vakia-has been severely persecuted.  At one
 time, for example, there were 1500 priests,
 at least, in jail.  Quite a few, no doubt, have
 been liquidated.    There is now a freeing of a
 good many of these priests.
 The Communist aim is to knock out re-
 ligion and strangle it, but the tactics and
 the way of handling depends upon circum-
 stances.

 CONGRESSIONAL         PROPOSAL  FOR  CAPTIVE  NA-
 TIONS-DR.  JUDD                                    INTERVIEW  WITH     REP.
 DANIEL J. FLOOD (D-PA.)
 Dr. JUDD. My guest today is my good friend,
 the Hon. DANIEL J. FLOOD, Democratic Con-
 gressman from Pennsylvania.                                  Congressman
 FLOOD is the author of a proposal designed
 to demonstrate more clearly America's un-
 wavering support of the peoples of Captive
 Nations oppressed by Communism.      Con-
 gressman FLOOD, please explain some of the
 details of your plan to our listeners.
 Representative FLOOD. As you know, and
 as I am glad to tell your audience, the pur-
 pose for the Captive Nations Resolution in
 the House is to bring to the attention of
 the nation-and always sponsored by the
 President, whoever he might be, or whatever
 party-and this is entirely a resolution of
 both parties.  Members of both parties have
 presented this resolution.
 The idea is to establish a special committee
 on this question of the Captive Nations be-
 Cause we created the phrase; they had been
 "satellite" nations. Now these people are not
 "satellites.". These are "captive" peoples.
 And that is the point of distinction.  We
 are trying to point out the importance of
 establishing, in the House especially, this
 special committee and the purpose is to point
 out the pure, naked imperialism and the
 colonialism of Soviet Russia.  The Com-
 munists make a point of pointing the finger
 at democracy, especially the United States,
 and saying we are colonial and we are impe-
 rial.                As a matter of fact, this is not true, and
 the captive nations are held captive by the
 Soviet.  There are many of them; I shall not
 enumerate them now.
 The purpose of the special committee, as
 you know, and you were one of the sponsors,
 is to bring to the attention not only of the
 House and the country and the world the
 fact that this naked condition of imperialism
 and colonialism really exists only today in
 the world in the Soviet Union. And we want
 to send a bridge across the oceans and the
 seas and the hemispheres to all of these cap-
 tive peoples, not only now in the Soviet in
 Europe and Central Europe, but in the Far
 East and in the Southeast or wherever they
 might be in the world.
 We believe that the existing established
 committees do not have the time and cannot
 give the proper attention to a sub-committee
 existence for this purpose; and we feel that
 only by the creation by the House-we would
 even agree a-joint committee would be bet-
 ter-but for our purpose, the House itself,
 a special committee on the captive nations
 to put a rifle on this target and expose im-
 perialism and colonialism where it really ex-
 ists-in Soviet Communist Russia:
 Dr. JUDD. Thank you, Congressman FLOOD,
 for speaking on this important proposal dur-
 ing this week which our nation annually ob-
 serves as Captive Nations Week.
 ON THE WARSAW PACT
 Sir: The writer of your July 8 editorial,
 "Disarray in the Warsaw Pact," has a fine
 command of the adjective and the adverb,
 but a rather faulty memory of recent history.
 The Soviets proposed an "all-Europe secu-
 rity plan" as long ago as Aug. 11, 1955 for the
 then-stated purpose of liquidating the NATO
 and Warsaw pacts.
 In usual Soviet fashion, propagandists kept
 this issue alive for several years.  On May 27,
 1958, Moscow announced the USSR would
 "pull Its troops out of Romania" and reduce
 troops in Hungary to get NATO powers to
 join with her in a 25-year non-aggression
 pact.
 When your editorial suggests it would be
 great if the Kremlin agrees with Mr. Ceau-
 sescu of Romania, the impression is given
 that the new proposal for abolishing NATO
 and Warsaw pacts is made against the oppo-
 sition of Moscow.  Not at all so.
 You may be interested, and your editorial
 writer may also be intrigued, by a Columbia-
 Harvard Research Group report to the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee February 14,
 1960. It stated, in part:
 "The objective of Soviet policy toward the
 advanced industrial countries now and in the
 near future appears to be not a social trans-
 formation of these countries, but a modifica.
 'tion of their national policies.  That is to
 say-and a number of distinguished American
 observers have gone astray an this point-it
 is not a question, in any short-range projec-
 tion, of trying to communize the countries
 of Western Europe, but rather of seeking to
 bring about changes in the policies of their
 `bourgeoise' governments.  In the first in-
 stance, this means changes that will have
 the effect of weakening the Western alliance;
 later, it may be hoped to encourage these
 governments to orient their policies more
 favorably toward the Soviet Union to make
 their industrial output available to the Soviet
 economic complex.  In the short-term situa-
 tion, the direction of the flow of industrial
 output of Western Europe is a major factor
 in the world power balance."
 It would seem that the Soviets have made
 considerable progress toward implementing
 this above-stated policy while we have suf-
 fered from not having any stateable, long or
 short term policy of a similar scope toward
 the Soviet Union or the Communist bloc.
 DONALD L. MILLER,
 Executive  Director,  National  Captive
 Nations Committee.
 Enrroa's  NoTE.-The  editorial  was not
 meant to give the impression cited by Mr.
 Miller.  Its main point was that Romania's
 position in the Warsaw Pact seemed to be
 having the wholesome effect of blocking the
 Kremlin's efforts to impose on the alliance
 a rigid, Soviet-dominated political, economic
 and military integration fit only for truly
 captive nations.
 LEGISLATION TO HELP VIN THE
 ECONOMIC  BATTLE  IN  SOUTH
 VIETNAM
 (Mr. BENNETT asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 .Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Speaker, we are
 at this moment engaged in one of the
 most difficult and perilous missions a free
 nation has ever set upon. The conflict in
 South Vietnam, is costing the American
 people $33 million a day in military aid,
 and an untold amount of priceless life
 and property.  It is appalling to us all,
 I am sure, to witness the thousands of
 persons who are losing their lives and
 billions of dollars which are being ex-
 pended in the machinations of war, when
 these resources could be much better
 spent in the forward progress of man-
 kind.  Yet we stand committed to our
 belief in the right of self-determination
 for the brave people of South Vietnam.
 In the pressures of our military activity,
 much of the attention of the world and
 the press has been on our military op-
 erations.  But I submit to you that we
 are fighting a three-faced battle: a mili-
 tary war, a political war, and an eco-
 nomic war.                   -
 In order to be successful in bringing
 independence and freedom to South
 Vietnam, we must win all three -battles.
 The military battle, although long and
 difficult, will ultimately result in victory.
 The political battle, tremendously com-
 plicated, is slowly being resolved.  But
 the firm basis upon which sovereign and
 independent nations stand must ulti-
 mately be economic. Today I am intro-
 ducing legislation which is vitally needed
 to help win the economic battle in South
 Vietnam.
 My bill will provide tremendous in-
 centives for private enterprise in the
 United States to furnish Its know-how
 and technical ability in the production of
 industrial-type management and job op-
 portunities in South Vietnam. The great
 system of American private enterprise
 has served as an inspiring example for
 many underdeveloped countries of the
 world. It must assist the development of
 a strong, free, and private enterprise sys-
 tem in South Vietnam. I think Ameri-
 can business will enthusiastically lend
 its know-how to help win the economic
 war in South Vietnam and to provide a
 locally owned business base for job and
 management opportunities there.  This
 bill will provide for a guarantee of 100
 percent for any American private -in-
 vestor or business concern against in-
 ability to convert money into U.S. dollars,
 expropriation, and loss due to war. In
 addition, my legislation calls for a 90-
 percent guarantee against any com-
 mercial loss in the investment.
 American businessmen have recog-
 nized the opportunity in South Vietnam
 and have made direct private investment
 to a total of over $5 million, exclusive of
 construction.  Recent private studies
 Indicate that companies moving into
 South Vietnam have average profits of
 20 to 30 percent on their investments.
 Last December, a seven-man mission. of
 U.S.  businessmen  sponsored  by  the
 Agency for International Development,
 reported favorably on the profit pros-
 pects for a wide range of small or medium
 industries and told of a rising number of
 inquiries. But while the response on the
 part of the private enterprise system has
 been sympathetic and encouraging, it
 has nowhere matched the overwhelming
 need for this type of economic activity.
 My bill would also provide for grants
 for surveys of investment by private en-
 terprise.  The surveys would be financed
 by the U.S. Government to encourage
 private investors to look into the vast
 opportunities open for business and in-

 introduction he carefully reviewed the spirit
 of public service that has characterized John
 Pillion.
 In his address, John Pillion paused to pay
 tribute to Kiwanis and to congratulate Inter-
 national on its objects and objectives.  He
 then proceeded to outline certain interna-
 tional problems that face the free world, and
 cited great challenges in a situation where
 some one-third of the world is "captive" and
 another one-third is "uncommitted." At the
 conclusion of his address he was greeted by a
 standing ovation.

 DR. JUDD INTERVIEW WITH DR. LEV DOBRIAN-
 SKY,  "THE  ORIGIN  OF  CAPTIVE  NATIONS
 WEEK"
 ANNOUNCER. This is the American Security
 Council Washington Report.  Speaking from
 Washington, here is our editor, Dr. Walter
 H. Judd.
 Dr. JUDD. Each July, during this week,
 America re-declares its support for the na-
 tions and peoples of the world who have
 fallen under the yoke of Communist tyranny.
 On the recommendations of the Congress of
 these United States, the President proclaims
 this to be Captive Nations Week. The author
 of this annual movement to pay tribute to
 the world's oppressed is my good friend, Dr.
 Lev Dobriansky, Professor of Economics at
 Georgetown University here in Washington.
 I have asked Dr. Dobriansky to tell us more
 about the significance of. Captive Nations
 Week.
 Dr. DoBRIANSITY. The significance of Cap-
 tive Nations Week has ben consistently re-
 flected since 1959, when the resolution was
 first passed. 'Last year, for example, the top
 Russian ideologist, Mikhail Suslov, had this
 to say concerning Captive Nations Week:
 "Especially  disgusting  is  the  villainous
 demagogy of the Imperialistic chieftains of
 the United States.  Each year they organize
 the so-called Captive Nations Week, hypo-
 critically pretending to be defenders of na-
 tions that have escaped from their yoke."
 Dr, DoSIANSKY. The Captive Nations Reso-
 lution and the Week concentrate on the close
 to 1 billion people from the Danube over to
 the Pacific and, also, in Asia and in Cuba. It
 is a deep thorn in the side of the Moscow
 chieftains because it brings up one of the
 greatest weaknesses and vulnerabilities with-
 in the U.S.S.R. itself.
 There has never been a monolithic struc-
 ture within the Soviet Union itself and this
 resolution concentrates not only on. the areas
 that most Americans are familiar with-the
 captive.areas of Central Europe, Asia and now
 Cuba, but also those within the U.S.S.R.
 During the Captive Nations Week observ-
 ance of last year, and again this year, we have
 supported the President's policy concerning
 Red aggression in Vietnam.  We raise the
 question: What about the 17 million captive
 people in North Vietnam?   When will we
 allow the South Vietnamese to point their
 strategy  toward  the liberation  of  their
 brethren in captive North Vietnam?    This
 and numerous other issues will be discussed
 in the course of this week. Americans should
 become more familiar with all of these captive
 nations and share this observance with us
 this week.
 Dr. JUDD. Thank you, Dr. Lev Dobrlansky,
 the man who conceived the idea of Captive
 Nations Week in which Americans may dem-
 onstrate their continued support for those
 millions of people who yearn for freedom
 from the cruel tyranny of Communism under
 which they are still compelled to live.

 DR. JUDD INTERVIEW WITH MARIA MIHAJLOV,
 "PLAN  FOR  FREE  PRESS  IN  YUGOSLAVIA"
 Dr. JUDD. My guest today is Miss Maria
 Mihajlov (MEE-HI-LOV), who is the sister
 of Mih:ajlo Mihajlov and a citizen of Yugo-
 slavia.                                                                 Last  year,   Mr.  Mihajlov  demon-
 strated                                                           a rare spirit        of independence   by
 writing "Moscow Summer," an essay com-
 menting  unfavorably   on   conditions                                                                   in
 Russia. For this he was jailed by the Tito
 government and then released on a sus-
 pended sentence.                                                                  Today, he is again tempt-
 ing fate by proposing to publish an inde-
 pendent opposition magazine in Yugoslavia.
 His sister, Maria, is a student in the United
 States.  While here, she is acting as the voice
 of Mr. Mihajlov in this country.  Her pur-
 pose is to make known to the American peo-
 ple the nature of her brother's project and
 the crucial importance of its outcome.
 Miss Mihajlov, would you please tell us
 about your brother's project?
 Miss MIHAJLOV. My brother's project is to
 publish an independent magazine in opposi-
 tion to one-party system rule in Yugoslavia.
 The purpose of this magazine would be, as
 he puts it, to oppose the one party system as
 a matter of principle, and to take an anti-
 Marxist and anti-totalitarian position and
 to promote Democratic Socialism which is
 entirely in keeping with the constitution and
 existing laws.
 Dr. JUDD. Miss Mihajlov, what do you think
 this project may accomplish?
 Miss MIHAJLOv. The magazine will serve as
 a nucleus for future non-Communist Social-
 istic legal opposition.  This will serve as the
 first breakthrough which my brother and I
 hope and believe will stimulate opposition in
 other iron curtain countries.  This is a test
 of the Yugoslav constitution.  If the Yugo-
 Slav government denies my brother his legal
 right, this at least, will reveal to the world
 that the liberalization is nothing but talk.
 Dr. JUDD. How do you believe that we in
 the West can influence the decision of the
 Yugoslav government?
 Miss  MIHAJLOV. My  brother  needs the
 greatest possible publicity for his project, in
 the free world. It is not money-it is moral
 support that he needs.
 Dr. JUDD. Why do you believe such pressure
 will have any effect on the Yugoslav govern-
 ment?
 MISS MIHAJLOV. My brother feels that Tito
 Is increasingly in the need of economic help
 from the West and simply cannot afford to
 ignore public opinion of the free world.
 Dr. JUDD. Miss Mihajlov, what are  your
 own future plans?
 Miss MIHAJLOV. Well, when I get my M.A.
 degree, I will go back to Yugoslavia.  I didn't
 break any laws of my country.  I love my
 people and I want to serve my country.
 Dr. JUDD. Thank you, Miss Maria Mihajlov.

 ANOTHER LOOK BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN-
 DR. JUDD  INTERVIEW  WITH  MISS  MONICA
 FLIDR
 Dr. JUno. My guest today Miss Monica
 Flidr of Czechoslovakia-has been before our
 microphone previously to tell of her recent
 escape from Communist domination of her
 homeland.  Today-in this week of America's
 19817
 solemn reiteration of our support for the peo-
 ples of all nations captive under Commu-
 nism-I would like to ask you, Miss Flidr,
 what most irritates the citizens of commu-
 nist-run countries?
 Miss FLIoR. In  my  frank  opinion,  I
 wouldn't start with academic freedoms.  It is
 irritating, but mostly daily life contains of
 small and mostly economic things, so I would
 say that from economic point of view, it
 would be that, well, unavailability of items
 of daily use whether it's food or dresses or
 electric appliances.  On the other hand, drop
 in level of all services, and on the other hand,
 from psychological point of view, continuing
 strain of vast propaganda in our newspapers
 where you can find out that everything works
 out marvelously and that everybody has rea-
 sons only to satisfaction but not to com-
 plaints.
 And I would like to add here that, espe-
 cially in families with children, there is great
 dissatisfaction with school propaganda and
 indoctrination, because children hear some-
 thing entirely different in their families and
 something entirely different in the school and
 they become hypocrites and it irritates par-
 ents and children, both of them.
 Dr. June. Miss Flidr, in terms of what the
 United States and the Free World generally
 might presently do to help, what would be of
 greatest help to the peoples of Captive Na-
 tions?
 Miss FLIeR. What I would say that perhaps
 would be the best thing would be if people
 in captive nations would see that especially
 United States are accepting responsibilities
 and obligations towards the countries fight-
 ing against Communism, let's say as in Viet
 Nam, this would give us hope and this would
 psychologically help very much in idea of
 revolt, in my opinion.  I know how disap-
 pointed we were after Hungary in 1956, and I
 know how glad people were when United
 States helped in Viet Nam.

 RELIGION IN THE SATELLITES-DR. JUDD INTER-
 VIEWS WITH DR. CHARLES W. LOWRY, PRESI-
 DENT, FOUNDATION FOR  RELIGIOUS ACTION
 Dr. June, My guest today is Dr. Charles W.
 Lowry, President of the Foundation for Re-
 ligious Action in the Social and Civil Order
 and the author of the internationally known
 book "Communism and Christ."  Dr. Lowry
 Is one of the nation's foremost authorities
 on the relationship between Communism and
 religion.  Dr. Lowry, as we honor and re-
 member the captive nations this week, will
 you tell us something about the status of
 religion   in  the  East  European  captive
 nations?
 Dr. Loway. Yes, the model or the classical
 example and the model for emulation, of
 course, is always the Soviet Union. But the
 satellites present a variety of circumstances
 that make for quite a. few differences.
 For example, Poland, which we are very
 much aware of at the moment in the news-
 Poland has 95%  Catholics.  Now this gives
 the Catholics a great advantage.  Also, there
 is an identification of the religious and the
 national that is almost unprecedented any-
 where else in the world, I think, In Poland.
 This is probably the reason for the stepping
 up of resistance to religion and attempt to
 check it and to herd it and harrass it at the
 present time, when we are having the 1,000th
 anniversary of Poland and when religion is
 very prominent, as it is very prominent in
 the feelings of the people, and religion has
 never suffered as much in Poland as in the
 other  satellites  in  the  other  Communist
 countries.
 Yugoslavia is very much in the public eye
 at the present time because of a most im-
 portant recent happening, namely the forg-
 ing of a new Concordat between the Catholic

 ability that is necessary for the creation
 of a sound economic system.  Since we
 do not wish to assume colonial obliga-

 disposition of all projects initiated under
 this act to the Government of South Viet-

 vestors after a 15-year period and at the
 cost of the value of the investment.
 Thus, the private enterprise system of
 America, which has developed this Na-
 tion into the wealthiest country on the
 face of the earth, will lend a helping
 hand to a brave people so that they might
 improve their economy and win the third

 SPECIAL POWERS FOR THE PRESI-
 DENT TO CURB INFLATION
 (Mr. SWEENEY asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. SWEENEY.  Mr. Speaker, I wish
 to draw the attention of the House to a
 bill that I have introduced today to au-
 thorize the President to invoke tem-
 porary emergency price, wage, and rent
 ceilings whenever the United States has
 declared against a foreign nation or
 whenever the Congress by concurrent
 resolution shall find and declare that
 grave national emergencies exist, and
 that the exercise of such authority is
 necessary in the interest of national se-
 curity for economic stability.
 Mr. Speaker, the emergency in Viet-
 nam and our increased commitments
 throughout the world make it essential
 that the President be possessed of power
 that was formerly his during World War
 II and the Korean conflict, when on the
 advice of his economic advisers, he as
 Chief Executive of the land determines
 that runaway inflation is a national
 problem.
 Mr. Speaker, I believe that it is essen-
 tial that attention be drawn to the fact
 that today the President is without im-
 mediate remedy to control inflationary
 price  and  wage  increases.  During
 periods of great national tension result-
 ing from the spiralling cost of living,
 great responsibility for the continuance
 of a healthy American economy falls
 upon the shoulders of the President. As
 the Nation has noted, our President has
 not shirked these responsibilities, but has
 repeatedly appealed for restraints and
 the initiation of many voluntary efforts
 to curb rising costs.
 Mr. Speaker, I note with some degree
 of satisfaction the fact that the Presi-
 dent has requested of the Congress legis-
 lative action to control rising interest
 rates.  While I deem such action on the
 part of the President as very meritorious
 and helpful, I cannot help but to feel
 that the request should have been en-
 larged so as to include the granting of
 power to the executive department to
 deal with the matter of cost relating to
 prices and wages as well.
 I wish to make it abundantly clear
 that while I applaud President John-
 son's efforts to secure a voluntary com-
 pliance at 3.2, I do not share his opti-
 mism insofar as the long-range merit of
 the voluntary guideline program, and I
 believe that it is high time that the
 NICKEL SHORTAGE-A NATIONAL
 PROBLEM.,
 (Mr. MONAGAN asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. MONAGAN.  Mr. Speaker, there
 are certain industries located within the
 Fifth Congressional District of Con-
 necticut, which I represent, that are de-
 pendent for their business life upon a
 plentiful supply of nickel ore.  At the
 present time     worldwide
 nickel is theatening the operations and
 the jobs in these industries.  I am cer-
 tain that such an impact is not limited
 to my district.  In fact, the shortage of
 nickel may rightfully be considered a
 national problem.
 In an effort to alleviate some of the
 difficulties caused by the tight supply of
 nickel, I introduced yesterday legislation
 (H.R. 17254) authorizing the disposal of
 surplus nickel from the national stock-
 pile. This bill authorizes the disposal of
 approximately 24.5 million pounds of
 nickel from the national stockpile estab-
 lished pursuant to the Strategic and
 Critical Materials Stockpiling Act-50
 U.S.C. 98-98h.  It has been determined
 by the office of Emergency Planning that
 this quantity is not required to meet
 stockpile needs.
 In the last session of Congress Public
 Law 89-323 was enacted .and authorized
 the release of 260 million pounds of ex-
 cess nickel from the national stockpile.
 However, due to the temporary shortage
 of this vital metal, most of the amount
 released has been used up. In fact, I am
 informed by the General Services Ad-
 ministration that there is approximately
 1 month's supply left from this authori-
 zation or 3 months' supply with selective
 allocation.
 The approximately 24.5 million pounds
 covered by my bill would provide suffi-
 cient material to fill urgent industry re-
 quirements. It is hoped that the nickel
 supply situation will be materially im-
 poved by the time this additional Gov-

 THE JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY AND
 THE PRESIDENT'S CLUB
 (Mr. CAMERON asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. CAMERON. Mr. Speaker, yester-
 day I was greatly disturbed to read in a
 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400100005-2
 822
 And less than 5 months ago he and his
 brother and their wives spent $12,000 for
 membership in the President's Club.
 Although the Democratic National
 Committee may have laughed all the
 way to the bank at the time, I am sure
 it now realizes that all it got for its
 money was a king-sized headache.
 There is only one type of aspirin that
 can cure the pain-returning the $12,000
 to the Martins with a "thanks but no
 thanks" note attached.
 I would rather see the national com-
 mittee clad in rags as it walks to the
 -bank to deposit sincerely donated nickels
 and dimes than see it decked out in a tux
 and lugging baskets of greenbacks which
 come from insincere and extremist re-
 sources--both left and right.
 Mr. Speaker, as proud members of the
 President's party we cannot permit a
 lazy, greedy, and irresponsible national
 committee to tarnish our reputations or,
 more importantly, the Chief Executive's.
 He carries the weight of the world. on his
 shoulders and the hopes of millions of
 Americans and freedom-loving peoples
 in his heart.  We cannot, we dare not,
 allow the national committee by its in-
 credible indiscretion to add to the Presi-
 dent's awesome burden.
 The Democratic National Committee
 can begin to lighten his load this very
 day by returning the $12,000 to the
 Martins.
 The altar of greed has no place in the
 temple of our party.
 Lei; us begin to dismantle it now,.
 syndicated column in the Washington
 Post that a prominent southern Califor-
 nia member of the John Birch Society
 was also a member of the President's
 Club.
 Blame for this deplorable development
 must rest with the Democratic, National
 Committee for as the major political and
 intelligence arm of the party it has per-
 mitted dollars to replace discretion as
 its major concern.
 This latest incident is but another il-
 lustration that the National Committee
 has failed to keep its house in order for
 many months.
 Many Members have long complained
 of fouled-up mailing lists.
 Party leaders in the States have com-
 plained of the committee's casual in-
 difference to their particular political
 problems.
 We have become accustomed to hear-
 ing reports that the committee's serv-
 ices are being withheld from Members
 who dare deviate on certain issues from
 .the position taken by the administra-
 tion.
 Only a few days ago my office called
 the committee to inquire about a packet
 of position papers prepared by Repub-
 lica4n national headquarters.  Although
 the press several days earlier had given
 prominent play to the existence of these
 papers, personnel in the committee's re-
 search, library, and public affairs sec-
 tions were completely unaware of them.
 In view of this abysmal record I was
 not surprised, although  greatly  dis-
 turbed, to read that the John Birch So-
 ciety has infiltrated the prestigious Presi-
 dent's Club.
 The club has recently come under
 heavy fire from the opposition pUXty.
 Their attack has been grossly unfair, in
 my judgment, for the focus has been on
 alleged "influence peddling" rather than
 on lack of discretion. This latest devel-
 opment makes it patently obvious that
 the national committee is making no at-
 tempt to correlate fat Government con-
 tracts with fat contributions.
 All the DNC is concerned with is seeing
 that the checks they receive are properly
 signed and do not bounce.
 Those who purchase membership in
 the President's Club with the notion that
 their share of Government business will
 increase are in for a sad awakening.
 They are giving undeserved credence
 to the GOP's propaganda campaign and
 undeserved credit to the national com-
 mittee's ability-even if it were willing-
 to tie contributions to contracts.
 Mr. Speaker, examine for a moment
 the background of. Birch Member J.
 Edward Martin, of Los Angeles,  For
 several years he has been a chapter
 leader in a JBS cell. The society's own
 publicity proclaims that he was host and
 major sponsor of at least three testimo-
 nial dinners for Birch founder and dic-
 tator Robert Welch.
 (Mr. HORTON asked and. was given

 and local cooperation that the-greatest edu-
 cational development can be achieved with
 federal help.
 Under the principle of State and local re-
 sponsibility, the American educational sys-
 tem has grown so that it compares favorably
 with that of any other country of the world.
 In 1960, school enrollments constituted 23.2
 percent of total population In the United
 States, compared to 11.1 percent In Europe
 and 14.24 percent in the Soviet Union..  In
 this country, total revenues for public schools
 have grown by 376 percent since 1950 and
 classroom construction has proceeded at a
 rate that will provide 653,000 classrooms in
 the decade 1962 to 1972.
 At the time the Elementary and Secondary
 Education Act of 1965 was being considered,
 we were concerned that this poorly-drafted
 legislation would too often impede rather
 than help the education effort in this coun-
 try.  We were concerned that it would de-
 prive the State agencies and local school au-
 thorities of any real power to shape educa-
 tional programs to meet local needs.  Cen-
 tralization of power was a theme that ran
 throughout the entire bill. Now, one year
 and a number of serious defects later, this
 Congress is being asked to broaden and ex-
 pand the original Act.  In an almost casual
 .manner, authorizations in excess of $4.8 bil-
 lion have been requested.           Unfortunately,
 there has been no meaningful attempt to
 sort out the vast and confusing tangle of
 federal programs.  Moreover, obvious defects
 have been either glossed over or totally ig-
 nored by the Democratic majority on the
 committee.
 For example, under the present Act, the
 distribution of funds within a State is es-
 tablished by a set formula.  As a result, State
 education agencies have been unable tochan-
 nel money to the areas of greatest need.  In
 the past, distribution on the basis of need
 has been the traditional administrative de-
 vice for the allocation of federal funds. Such
