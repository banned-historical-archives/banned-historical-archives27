. . 
Act which, after amendment, passed the 
Senate, 2 to 1, and became law in Septem-
ber 1940. In 1941 he answered Stimson's 
call for help, went to Washington and was 
in the War Secretary's office to write the 
declaration of war against Japan after the 
dastardly attack on Pearl Harbor. Citizen 
Clark had done it again. 
Yet he would probably say that vital 
though survival is, nothing he did in the two 
World Warsis as important as his efforts for 
world peace. He began to turn over thoughts 
about limited world government as long ago 
as the 1920's. In 1939, spurred by the pre-
carious state of global affairs, he wrote out 
his developing ideas in "A Federation of Free 
Peoples." With the Second World War sub-
stantially won by July 1944, Clark quit 
Was-hington and went back to Dublin to work 
on winning the peace. Secretary Stimson 
encouraged him to raise his sights so as to 
devise a world constitution for the postwar 
era. 
The result was that he produced an outline 
for a world government to maintain peace 
which the Indiana Law Review published 
that same year with the significant title, "A 
New World Order?The American Lawyer's 
Role." In October 1945, he assembled the 
meeting known as the Dublin conference. At 
Clark's inspiration and with Supreme Court 
Justice Owen J. Roberts as chairman, a group 
of 40 distinguished citizens met in sight of 
old Monadnock to think together about the 
means for preventing the holocaust that 
could destroy civilization. Out of their de-
liberations came the Dublin declaration look-
ing to the formation of a world federal gov-
ernment. 
The essence of the Clark position on world 
peace is that as long a,s the nuclear arms 
race continues, the world lives with a loaded 
gun at its head. This, he submits, is not only 
dangerous to the point of foolhardiness but 
Intolerable. And so he is for world law, 
legislated by a world body and enforced by a 
world administration, with a world police 
force to keep international order. Any dis-
putes would be adjudicated or mediated by 
world-courts and related tribunals. This 
comprehensive peacekeeping machinery 
would be supported by an adequate world 
revenue system. 
The United Nations is good so far as it 
goes, Mit as is evident from the Clark plan, 
it `does not go far enough. And so Citizen 
Clark undertook to work out a detailed revi-
sion of the United Nations Charter with a 
view to provoking "the worldwide discussions 
which must precede the adoption of uni-
versal and complete disarmament and the 
establishment of truly effective institutions 
for the prevention of war." 
In the formulation of his plan's many 
details, he enlisted the help of Prof. Louis B. 
Sohn of the Harvard University Law School, 
whose field is international law. Their book, 
"World Peace Through World Law," was pub-
lished by the Harvard University Press in 
March 1958. The first edition was soon ex-
hausted and a revised edition came out in 
1960. It has been translated in whole or in 
part into at least a dozen languages, among 
them Chinese and Russian, and serves as a 
basis for genuine world peace and disarma-
ment talks wherever they are held. Then in 
order to propose an alternative method he 
and Professor Sohn published in 1962 a draft 
treaty establishing a World Disarmament and 
World Development Organization within the 
framework of the United Nations. The pur-
pose was to create a compact but inclusive 
treaty text on which statesmen might start 
to work in any sincere effort at drawing the 
teeth of war. 
In recent months Grenville Clark has been 
studying the probable effect of disarmament 
on the world's populati One of 
the fruits in this vocative 
article which he contributed in February

His encouraging expectations can be told 
from these hopeful words: '"The release, 
through complete disarmament, of 'vast re-
sources to raise living standards in the 'have-
not' areas of the world: could bring about 
effective population control 'within a few 
decades." Those who strive for peace and 
those who strive for population control 
should, he wrote, "strike bands in a united 
effort for the preservation and welfare of 
mankind." 
HOW do fellAw lawyers appraise the career 
of Grenville dellark? Judging by the widely 
criculated ex.pbange of letters in 1949 on the 
testis of "Freedom Lit.yrafiarti" between him, 
as a Harvard fellow, and Harvard law grad-
uate Frank B. Ober, of Baltimore. there are 
those who find fault vrithparts of it?to say 
the least. But then Pere are countless oth-
ers who regard the patient, far-seeing Than 
with the square, strong -jaw as among the 
? glories not only of their profession but of 
all America. 
On presenting Grenville Clark with the 
American Bar Aseociation's highest award, 
its gold medal for "cotispicuotui service- to 
the use of American jurisprudence," Presi-
dent Rose Malone spokefor many lawyers, 
on August- 27, 1959, at Miami Beach, when 
he said, quoting the citation: " 
"Through his dedication to the discharge 
of the public responsibility of the bar dur-
ing a long and distinguished Professional ca-
reer, he has rallied many others to that noble 
concept. He has helped keep freedom's flag 
flying, and by his example Rai ever reminded 
his fellow lawyers of their duty to uphold 
liberty and to expand support for the rule of 
law." , 
Yet more than gold medals and citatiOns - 
he must cherlah the words of Secretary SU/n-
eon from a handwritten letter" sent afar 
World War * 
"You certainly should record ymir work. 
At almost every critical period in our his-
tory which / can remember, it was your saga-
city which diagnosed and pushed forward the 
best remedy, and you have not had a quarter 
of the recognition for it Which you should 
have had." 
Among those in high place who have com-
mended Grenville Clark's work is President 
Kennedy. Praising hirti as a man alert: in 
both war and peace, to vital needs, the 
President has well said that "his example 
Is one for which we can all he grateful.? 
But let Grenville Clark speak for himself. 
His words come to us from the "spotlighted 
rostrum of the bar convention where he has 
received the gold medal, from the study in 
the Harvard Taw library -Where' be is hardat 
work, from the old farmhouse on -the moun-
tain slope In New Hampshire where be takes 
comfort from the serenity of the lake that 
greeted the pioneers two ceialuries ago. Be 
says to us: - 
"I hope that we may constantly recall the 
words of Lincoln: 'As our Case is new, so 
must we think anew and act anew. Por 
Wish that our thinking "Shall not be crip-
pled by timidity or undue regard for tradi-
tion, but shall be as imaginative and creative 
as the problem is vast and new: I further 
wish that we may resist any temptation to 
avoid the hardest problems. 
"I earnestly hope that we may have the 
insight to perceive the uselessness of talking 
about any -effective rule of law In world af-
fairs unless in addition' to world tribunals 
we are prepared to accept world legislative 
and., executive agencies equipped with fule-
guate authority to make the judgments of 
'thea tribunals surely enforcible. 
"In particular I hope that we will realize 
that nothing less will suffice than universal 
and complete, rather than partial. national 
filstrrnarnent, together with an adequate 
world police force. On no easier terms than 
these, I believe, can a world rule of law, how-
ever strialy limited to the prevention of wa& 
become a reality. 
"This problem of world peace under law 
Is indeed hard. But it is not insoluble and 
the goal is worth the effort. There is a tide 
IA the affairs of men. It brings us now a 
supreme opportunity and also imposes an 
Urgent duty. /f we can rise to that duty we 
shall fairly earn the gratitude of all man-
kind." 
And so going west out of Dublin watch for 
that turnoff to the left into the woods. It

vention also left no room for doubt that 
the participants in that Democratic con-
vention in Oregon are very concerned 
about the course of action that the 
United States Is following in the foreign 
policy in southeast Asia. 
In MY judgment this is the most 
sensible action that has been taken by 
any party convention yet on this critical 
international conflict. 
The resolution states in full: 
We urge that the United States oak the 
United Nations to take responsibility for 
the settlement of the conflict In Vietnam and 
that the 'United States declare its readiness 
to contribute troops and military support 
under United Nations command upon the as-
sumption of this responsibility by the United 
Nations. 
There is no doubt as to the position 
of these Democrats in support of having 
other nations who are members of the 
Milted Nations proceed to carry out 
their responsibilities, along with the 
United States, in applying the rule of 
law, rather than American unilateral 
military action in Southeast Asia in an 
attempt to settle this dispute. 
? The American people everywhere, not 
Just in Oregon, are beginning to awaken 
to the -fact that what Is happening in 
Southeast Asia is not the exclusive busi-
ness of the U.S. Department of Defense 
or of the US. Government as a whole. 
They are beginning to appreciate that it 
is a threat to international peace of 
exactly the kind the United Nations was 
created to handle. 
Even the Secretary General of the 
U.N.. U Thant, is coining to appreciate 
the same thing. At long last, he has 
called for, a new 14-nation conference 
on Southeast Asia, with the possibility 
that the United Nations could play a 
role in enforcing its decision. I would 
that the U.S. Ambassador to the United 
Nations, Mr. Adlai Stevenson, would give 
July 9 
to Mr. U Thant the help and coopera-
tion that is needed, rather than follow 
the course of action that Mr. Stevenson 
has been following in recent months in 
regard to the war in southeast Asia. 
The United States opposes any new 
agreement on Southeast Asia until the 
existing agreements are lived up to. But 
since, we are not living up to them any 
more than North Vietnam or China, this 
is only a semantic objection and not a 
real one. It stands to our historic dis-
credit. 
The official position of the United 
States only raises the question of why the 
United Nations should not be brought in 
to enforce the existing agreement. If we 
really want it enforced, why do we try 
to keep the U.N. out? The American 
concern about living up to existing agree-
ments will not be believable even to our 
own people until we seek an interna-
tional, not a unilateral, enforcement of 
them. Until we demonstrate in good 
faith?and the United States in south-
east Asia is not demonstrating good faith, 
but bad faith?the United States in 
southeast Asia is not living up to its obli-
gations under even the Geneva accord of 
1962, and we did not even sign the 
Geneva accord of 1954. The United 
States is riot demonstrating good faith 
in southeast Asia until it demonstrates a 
willingness to sit down at a 14-nation 
conference table, as Mr. U Thant now, 
at long last?but better than never?has 
finally proposed in the press today. 
I am proud that the Oregon Demo-
cratic convention has raised its voice in 
behalf of the rule of law in world affairs. 
As the war continues, as it becomes more 
widely discussed in this country, and as 
more information about it trickles down 
to the American people, there will be 
more voices raised along the same line. 
More people in the country are speak-
ing out through the various media of 
public information than there were 90 
days ago. I ask unanimous consent to 
have certain communications that I have 
received in support of the position I have 
taken on this issue and certain newspa-
per articles printed in the RECORD at the 
close of my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(See exhibit 1.) 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, great 
concern is being demonstrated among 
our allies over our military course of ac-
tion in southeast Asia. We are begin-
ning to hear rumblings of fear and doubt 
in respect to the U.S. policy in southeast 
Asia among the people of many lands. 
In today's press, our potential enemy, 
Russia, is making disquieting statements 
about her concern over what she alleges 
to be U.S. aggression in southeast Asia. 
She is beginning to make noises to the 
effect that she does not propose to ignore 
her commitments made with other coun-
tries to see to it that aggression is not 
carried out in southeast Asia or else-
where. 
Certainly, I agree that she ought to be 
the last to be discussing it. When one 
looks at the blood of aggression on the 
hands of Soviet Russia, it becomes a bit 
paradoxical to read her pratings today. 
But, nevertheless, we have placed our-

selves, I respectfully submit, in a posi-
tion so that Russia can carry on that 
kind of propaganda against the United 
States. In this instance, the United 
States is wrong. Russia is going to take 
advantage of every Mistake we make. 
She is beginning to indicate that she is 
not going to walk out on Red China. 
There are stirrings, rumblings, and prop-
aganda announcements coming out of 
Peiping itself. 
Red China is showing an intention not 
to be bluffed by the United States, not 
to submit to the United States as we 
continue our policy of making war, and 
not peace, in southeast Asia. 
In my judgment, the war clouds are 
becoming more black and ugly over Asia. 
They are becoming so black they have 
caused even Pakistan to endorse a 14-
nation conference according to today's 
press reports. Pakistan is one of the 
SEATO members that has refused to join 
American forces in Vietnam, despite the 
vast aid we furnish to Pakistan. I am 
More concerned than ever before that if 
we continue our unilateral military 
course of action in Asia, the probabilities 
are that there will be a full-scale war in 
Asia, and the United States will live to 
regret that we took the course of action 
that brought about the beginning of that 
war, rather than resorting, as we should, 
under treaty commitments, to existing 
procedures of the rule of law or at least 
an attempt to settle the dispute by peace-
ful procedures, rather than by American 
military might.

Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Senator for the State of Oregon, Senate of 
the United States of America, Washing-
ton, D.C. - 
Dzeks, : I have read in our newspapers 
recently your sane and balanced views on 
World affairs Particularly with regard to 
events in southeast Asia, a part of the world 
that is of great concern to those of us that 
live in the South Pacific region. 
Your??oininents as reported today (June 
25, 1964) on the question of the course in-
dicated by the United States in this vital 
area are listened to and understood by peo-
ple from many walks of life here. To those 
of us that look with great concern at the 
march toward a conflagration in southeast 
Asia, your voice is an indication of wiser 
cotmcils that rise above the constant bar-
rage of talk of war that flows in an endless 
stream from so many U.S. spokesmen and 
various journals. 
Please accept my thanks for your courage 
and humanity in speaking out on these is-
sues which keep alive the faith that so Many 
people like myself still endeavor to retain 
in the American democratic tradition of the 
past, despite so many 'blows against a re-
tention of that faith during recent years. 
Whilst persons like yourself in positions of 
responsibility in your country still speak out 
on matters that they consider against the 
interests of peace, independence, and com-
mon humanity, we know that the best tradi-
tions of American demoeracy still 'retain 
some hold in these dangerous times. 
Please accept my assurance based' On my 
own experience that your words' are not 
lost on millions of ordinary people outside 
the United States, we can well see what 
No. 136 8 
would be the inevitable result of the policies 
you speak out against as a true American. 
Thank you.

Mr. F. S. BALDWIN.

SENATOR FEARS BIG WAR 
WAskawarox.?Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Democrat, of Oregon, said in the U.S. Senate 
yesterday that the United States was head-
ing for a major war in Asia. 
He said he had just come from a briefing 
on the military situation in South Vietnam 
held by the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Mc-
Namara, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
"If the United States continues following 
the course indicated by this briefing," he 
said, "we are headed for a major war in 
Asia, in which thousands of American boys 
will die. 
"We will be hated for 500 years and we 
will be known as the Nation that was chiefly 
responsible for scuttling the United Nations. 
"The greatest threat to the peace of the 
world is the United States." 
Senator MORSE said the situation in South 
Vietnam should be put before the United 
Nations.

the greatness of our ideals to look upon most 
of our actions in Asia with anything but a 
feeling of hopeless horror. The fu,,ure of our

upon you?and the others of your persua-

WHO LS FIGHTING THZ VIETNAM WAR? 
/n spite of propaganda to the contrary, it 
is obvious that the United States is fighting 
in the Vietnam war, and using some modern 
techniques in doing so. Several times Gen-
eral Hester had pointed this out in his ar-
ticles in the Churchman, in which he has 
quoted many authorities. Life magazine de-
serves credit for printing the letters of Capt. 
Edwin Shank. 27, to his wife, in its issue of 
May 8. The captain was killed in Vietnam 
2 days after his last letter, dated March 22. 
In a letter of December 4, 1963. written 
following one of their night attacks, we 
read: "After the first two bombs, we spotted 
the bad guys shooting at us. So Frank di-
rected me in and I burned them with na-
palm." Please note the "I." In a letter of 
January 4, of this year. Shank wrote: "Na-
palm Is gasoline which is jellied into a mass 
about the consistency of honey. When you 
drop it, it ignites and spreads fire about 
200 to 300 feet. With charcoal in it, the char-
coal is thrown another 200 feet, like a burn-
ing baseball, and does further damage to 
Vietcong houses." On January 7 he wrote: 
"I don't know what the United States is do-
ing. They tell you people that we are Just 
in training situations. But we're at war.

Pilots fight this war. We?me and my

elates that 'millions of Americans are be-

?.:WI-IAT KIND OF FREEDOM? 
(By Hugh B. Hester) 
The American people have 'been shown two 
pictures in their, daily newspapers- recently 
Which depict the situation in the world bet-
ter than many thousands of words. One 
shows the bloody, cruel, and utterly insane 
war the U.S. Government is waging against 
'defenseless, innocent, and poor men, wi3men 
and children?in this instance, halfway 
around the world. It is of _a Cambodian 
lather holding in his arms his badly burned 
? napalm-bombed child. The other. picture 
*Showt the abysmal poverty of the -"have-
mote in Latin America. 
To state, as did the late John Foster Dulles 
and many others, that the presence of Com-
munists among the people of Vietnam, Laos, 
? and Cambodia pose a threat to the interests 
of the mighty United States is fantastic; to 
. claim that the U.S. Government is not re-
sponsible for the war in this area is false; 
and to call this a defense of freedom is lit-
erally obscene. This is coldbloodeci, 'sense-
less murder, worthy only of the heirs of 
Hitler'i Nazi Germany, her concentration 
camps and crematories. 
? The picture of a village in northern Brazil 
illustrates more Clearly than anything else 
possible the reasons for discontent and tur-
moil in this continent south of Us. The 
recent Coup d'etat in Brazil which deposed 
President Joao G,oillart will not solve this 
, 
problem of poverty. The continued use of 
U.S. funds for the arming of the feudal forces 
? 
in Latin America 7;7'111 not eolVe this problem 
either. The causes of instability in this Vital 
area can only be achieved -through the 
?-eradication of the worst features, of poverty.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have Just written 
to President Johnson, congratulating him 
on passage of civil liberties legislation, and 
protesting foreign policy in Vietnam and ex-
pressing thorough agreement with positions 
taken by you and Senator GRUENING. 
It is alarming to me that so few people 
In key positions seem aware of the dangers 
of escalating war in southeast Asia and the 
importance for the country that we extricate 
ourselves, before we bog down deeper and 
precipitate major catastrophe. 
We seem to be trying to control the life 
and politics of these people against their 
will. We just can't indefinitely play God to 
the whole world?and get away with it.

more effectively. At least I can also write to

growing willingness in the Pentagon and the 
State Department to go to war with Red

your views heard.

Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR: I am enclosing a copy of a 
letter which I sent to President Johnson. 
This will serve to convey my views on the 
war in southeast Asia. I wish to add to that 
an expression of gratitude for your many 
forthright statements in opposition to that 
war. It is reassuring to know that there 
are a few men in Congress who dare to ask, 
"Where are the emperor's clothes?" 
Very truly yours, 
Mrs. /DA G. KLINGSBERG. 
"DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: POT several -months 
I read with a growing feeling of ease and re-
assurance your many statements in favor of 
finding peaceful solutions for the world's 
problems. Recent developments in southeast 
Asia, however, point in the direction not of 
peace but of war. American lives continue 
to be lost; Laos is bombed; a military man 
serves as our ambassador to South Vietnam; 
talk increases of expanding the war. These 
things are most alarming.

Hon. WAYNE MORSE, 
The U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
MY DEAR SENATOR: Since I feel that your 
position concerning the war in southeastAsia 
and its inevitable consequences is correct 
and commendable, I would like to pledge my 
support to you in your efforts to encourage 
a more sane policy there. Until the U.S. 
Government recognizes the necessity of work-
ing within the U.N. and adhering to interna-
tional law, it will continually jeopardize the 
peace of the world, as it has during the past 
few years. It is surprising that this Nation 
which began with a struggle for its own in-
dependence from a colonialist power should 
now be falling into the same errors as its 
earlier opponents. 
Sincerely yours, 
Mrs. KATHERINE HARAMUNDANIS. 
MILLERS FALLS, MASS., 
,f_uly 4, 1964. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I would like to quote 
part of a book review from the New York 
Times which was partially reproduced in an 
article by A. J. Muste in Liberation. It was 
written by Prof. George Kateb of Amherst 
College: 
"There is already evidence of a new stat-
ism which makes of international relations 
a Renaissance game; which spends incon-
ceivably large sums of money on redundant 
or artificial projects; which so encloses our 
leaders in their struggle with the enemy 
that one day they could have more in com-
mon with their counterparts in the enemy 
_country than with their own people; which 
can speculate on thermonuclear casualties 
in the scores of millions and still speak about 
the survival or victory of the Nation." 
Brief as it is this statement clearly in-
dicates the present trend of U.S. policy in 
southeast Asia. Vietnam and Laos have now 
become the focal points in a struggle against 
Communist aggressors while they should 
really be treated as signs and alarms of the 
increasingly complex political, economic, 
and social situation which exists in south-
east Asia. 
I applaud and wholeheartedly support 
your opposition to our Government's war-
hawk attitude. To be certain, peacekeeping, 
and not warmongering, is the central task 
for the United States in southeast Asia. 
For the first time in our Nation's short 
-history, when and if the administration 
calls for more overt action, there will be 
opposition from representative officials like 
you and some of your colleagues. 
"I have already written a letter to President 
Johnson voicing my opposition to the pres-
ent trend of military and political affairs in 
southwest Asia, but I urge you to keep the 
voices of opposition strong and creative 
enough to offer an alternative of peaceful 
conciliation in Vietnam and Laos. 
" 'The President made an unfortunate choice 
in appointing General Taylor to the am-
bassadorial post in Vietnam. I sincerely 
hope that this trend of action can be coun-

The situation will become infinitely worse 
as soon as the war is expanded as it doubt-
less Will be if it should long be continued. 
Sooner or later, China would be drawn in. 
There is reason to believe that Senator MORSE 
Is right in charging that important figures 
in the State Department and the Pentagon 
want to fight China now while she is rela-
tively weak. This, among the other dis-
astrous consequences, would take Russia off 
the hook, We could weaken China for her 
while she could still profess loyalty to the 
Communist cauie and even render some 
service to it. To the nonwhite world we 
should be made to appear as racial imper-
ialists. There Is no better way to a third 
world war as the eventual end of our policy. 
In any case its costs would be catastrophic. 
We must negotiate. Any solution of the 
problem must be political, involving the 14 
nations which made the Geneva agreement 
On. independence and neutrality. It should 
also involve the United Nations and most 
certainly Communist China, It Is not to 
deny that It will be difficult to deal with 
China to say that we have made it im-
possible to deal constructively with her so 
long as we insist that Chiang represents the 
country out of which he was ingloriously 
driven. 
One of the more rational spokesmen for 
the State Department in a recent debate with 
me in Detroit argued, first, that we could not 
deal with the Chinese Communists because 
of the nature of their communism, and, sec-
ond, that we did not need to recognize Chi-
nese Communist government and were in 
fact dealing with It without giving it rec-
ognition. It may be that Peiping will prove 
so Intransigent that the end will be war 
no matter what Washington does. I don't 
believe this, partly because of China's pres-
ent relative moderation in southeast Asia. 
But the United States has no right to fulfill 
its own prophecies of Chinese intransigence 
by its absurb policy of nonrecognition and 
the exclusion of the real China from the 
U.N. Peace. all too probably the world's 
peace, depends upon political solution of 
southeast Asian problems in terms of ne-
gotiation and neutralization.

DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I have just 
heard the halting and not very credible or 
creditable speech of your recent Ambassador 
to Saigon before the National Press Club. 
It was evasive, when not actually menda-
Clous, on Vietnam. 
It was a rather disgraceful performance. 
But, in its being so, it unfortunately 
echoes the position of our Government on 
the civil war in South Vietnam?for it is a 
- civil war, and not an international conflict 
(except insofar as we are making it so), 
which our Government represents it as and 
is apparently trying to escalate it to. 
I see the role of the NLF as indistinguish-
able from the forces that fought to get rid 
of the French?to get rid of all foreign power 
and make Vietnam self-governing. 
This, by the same logic, means getting rid 
of all puppet dictators like Diem and Kanh, 
who continue under different forms the op-
pressive aims of a colonial power. 
We have seen to it that we succeeded 
France as the colonial power in southeast 
Asia, and have acted rather more rapaciously 
than the French, more murderously. 
Our aim there is immoral because it is to 
prevent the self-determination of a people. 
And, as could be expected with an im-
moral aim, our methods are equally immoral, 
what with defoliation, napalm, and torture 
and terrorism directed toward the ordinary 
citizenry, to say nothing of death. 
As a reflection of this immoral aim of ours, 
the NFL has the allegiance of 70 percent of 
the area, 50 percent of the population, has 
Its own government, issues its own postage 
stamps, collects taxes from U.S. Government 
contractors in Saigon itself, can have its 
military forces operate within 5 miles of 
Saigon, can have its agents operate freely 
within Saigon, and has the secret sympathy 
of,a large number of foreigners. 
/n addition to the immorality of our aims 
and methods in South Vietnam?or as a 
consequence of it?we are threatening to run 
the risk of a world war in the course of 
which we as a nation, as well as many others, 
would most likely be wiped out. 
Sir, are you really unaware of these things?

'U.S. OPPONENT OF TTETNAIA *AR 
(By George Bain) 
WassoNtrrow.?In the U.S. Senate it has 
become almost a daily occurrence that Sena-
tor WAYNE Mostar, of Oregon, rises in his 
place to denounce what he calls McNamara's 
war in Vietnam. 
He says that the United States cahnot 
legally justify its presence there, that it is 
following a policy which is likely to lead to 
a long drawn out and costly war with China, 
and that if the fighting in Vietnam endangers 
the peace of the world?as he thinks it 
doss?The place to take the issue is to the 
United Nations. 
?- He says that the United States has acted 
not only unwisely but improperly. and points 
out that South Vietnam as well as North 
Vietnam luso been accused b`y the Interns-
tinnal Cantrol Commission, of violating the 
1964 Geneva accords?South Vietnam by re-
ceiving U.S. military assistance. 
He has made public answers given him by 
experts appearing before the Senate foreign 
relations committee, of which he is a mem-
ber, to the effect that very few North Viet-
namese, or Chinese, or other foreigners have 
been found among the Vietcong taken prison-
er in the lighting in South Vietnam. 
The foreigners in South Vietnam today, he 
has_said. are Americans. 
He looks Upon the war in South Vietnam 
At civil war, in which each side has its 
baclanse traTalde, rather than as an angres-
? iSve war waged from North Vietnam. He 
believes. however, that North Vietnam, with 
China beyond it, has been the greater of-
fender against the Geneva accords, and that 
the case could be proved in the United Na-
tions. although to do SO might be to expose 
the mistakes of the United States. 
In a recent speech he said: "Peace Is snore 
important than US. face. Peace is more 
important than a temporary Ices of US. 
prestige, if we lose prestige by seeking to 
right a mistaken course of action, I believe 
the opposite would be true." 
In his long campaign, Senator Moises has 
had several associates?most notably Sena-
tor Eamon Gatorameo, of Alaska. They are 
both Democrats. Both from time to time 
have criticized the U.S. press for the scant 
attention it has paid their other-side-of-the-
case argument at a time when Vietnam and 
Laos rarely have been off the front pages. 
Not all the attention that has been paid 
them has been favorable. 
The Washington Star in an editorial this 
week said: 
must be that Senator WAYNE Ithasx 
stands on his head when he looks at the 
international situation. ? ? ? The latest of 
(his) attacks accuses President Johnson of 
carrying out an illegal and immoral Asian 
policy "making the United States the world's 
leading threat to world peace." This is an 
outrageously irrespov?sible statement. It does 
violence to the realities, and It certainly 
lends more than a little aid and comfort to 
the Communist enemy in southeast Asia." 
Whether or not the conclusion complained 
of by the Star editorialist was warranted, the 
Senator's attack on the legality and morality 
of the U.S. policy can hardly be called ir-
responsible. Both are open to question. 
-The losing war which ?ranee waged to 
maintain its Indochina colonies?a war sub-
stantially assisted by the Unitde States at the 
end?was brought to an end with the sign-
ing of the Geneva accords in July 1934. What 
had been Indochina was divided in four?
Cambodia, Laos, and North and South Viet-
nam_ 
The United States did not sign. Senator 
Moasz says: "It is my view that we did not 
sign the Geneva agreements because we did 
not intend to go along. We have not gone 
along. Therefore we stand here today In this 
ugly, Shocking posture of the United States 
before the eyes of the world, engaging in 
MeNtunium's war in South Vietnam." 
It is part of his thesis that, after en-
couraging Prance not to give up the fight, 
then sounding out Britain particularly to see 
if a joint venture could not be launched to 
keep up the war against the Communist 
Viet Minh. that John Poster-Dulles, the then 
Secretary of State, reluctantly accepted the 
work of the Geneva conference and with 
reservations. 
"Why did not our representatives sign that 
treaty?" Senator &loess asks. "Why did not 
South Vietnam sign it? I think the answer 
is that their refusal to sign it was based on 
the fact that the United States had already 
decided to step into South Vietnam at least, 
and carry on where Prance had left off?to 
keep South Vietnam as a Western protector-
ate and toehold in Asia." 
Whether or not that, was the intention, 
the fact is that while withholdirg its sig-
nature from the accords the United States 
issued an indepindent statement to the 
effect that it would observe them. 
But as early as January 1955, Mr. Dulles 
was referring to the Geneva agreements as a 
major setback. And even before that, in 
September 1954, he had pasted together the 
Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as a 
response to the new situation in southeast 
Asia. 
Its members were Australia. Prance. New 
Zealand. Pakistan. the Philippines, Thailand, 
Britain, and the United States. A prot000l 
to the treaty extended to Cambodia. Laos, 
and South Vietnam the protection of clause 
4, Which says, among other things, that 
an attack upon one will be regarded as an 
attack upon all. 
If is upon this shaky foundation that U.S. 
involvement in the fighting in South Viet-
nam rests. Ostensibly, the United States is 
there?and has been since 1955?at the re-
quest of South Vietnam to assist it in its 
defense against aggression from North Viet-
nam. 
What Senator Mosaic says is this: "Today 
South Vietnam does not run the war against 
the ,guerrillas. She does not make her own 
foreign policy or military policy. The United 
States does. The US. Air Force is fighting 
in South Vietnam. Its planes and men are 
providing the air support and air transporta-
tion' for the Government ground forces, 
Americans numbering at least 15,000 are 
fighting with the ground forces. When they 
are -shot at, they shoot back." 
Tt.S. participation on this order is not in 
keeping with the Geneva accords, article 16 
of which says: "With effect from the date of 
entry into force of the present agreement, 
the introduction into Vietnam of any troop 
reinforcements and additional military per-
sonnel is prohibited." 
It was in 1957 that the International Con-
trol Commission, composed of Indian, Polish, 
and Canadian members, complained of viola-
tions by South Vietnam involving U.S. troops. 
The most serious incident involved the in-
troduction of 290 U.S. military personnel into 
the country even after the Commission had 
said that their entry should be held up by 
pending further study by the Commission. 
There were complaints of North Vietnamese 
violations then and have been since. Sena-
tor Moser accepts that assistance has been 
given the Vietcong in the training of men 
and the equipping of them?although much 
of the Vietcong equipment is American-
made, having been captured?but that what 
North Vietnam may have done does not war-
rant the United States matching it. 
LEBANON, OREG., 
June 21, 1964. 
Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Washington, D.C. 
SENATOR Moans: We are deeply concerned 
over the recent decision of the Government 
in risking total all-out, hopeless, war in 
southeast Asia. Another stalemate like 
Korea is all that can be hoped for, in Viet-
nam. land Of political indecision and Com-
munist bounded. Various reports over news-
casts, from time to time, have made known 
your fight against this contemplated action. 
Keep it up. by all means. The peace of our 
Nation and the lives of the young men are 
at stake. And if you who represent us do 
not cry out against this foolhardy thing, who 
can, 
We are writing each of our Congressmen 
from Oregon. to begin at once, in earnest 
to decry this thing that is sweeping our 
Nation toward another hopeless conflict. 
(Which the Communist world gleefully an-
ticipate. etc.) 
Also we have written the editor of the 
Oregonian, to urge the readers, to beseech 
the President and Congressmen by tele-
gram and letter to protest against the pro-
posed, further intervention in such a hope-
less, far-off war. Also, di a ask the editor 
to contact other editors of the Nation for 
such an effort, that the voice of the people 
might be heard in protest against such fool-
hardiness. Only the united voice of the 
people can hope to stem the tide, from all 
indications of the rash action being taken by 
those in authority. And concern is all but 
smothered out, by the complacency and 
harangue over the political issues (and can-
didates) of the day, etc. 
Therefore, continue to stand strong and 
sure for those things which are right and 
true regardless of men's words and actions.

You have stood, time after 'eine, for the 
right, in the face of great opposition, and 
many of us have cheered behind the scenes, 
and now we want you to know we are behind 
your efforts by word and by prayer, and 
when our life's work is finished the only 
thing that will really count for time and 
eternity, is "Have we obeyed and striven to 
? do those things, that God hath put into our 
hand to do, for His glory and men's good." 
As we obey His voice to our hearts day by day, 
? "The steps of a good man are ordered of the 
Lord," Psalms 3'7: 23 (if that man will hear 
and heed). How can they be, if he won't? 
We can move by word and deed in the will 
and way of the Almighty, and what better 
way is there to move? None, I daresay. God 
sayS,-Psalm 119: 105: "His word is a lamp 
unto our feet and a light unto our path." 
Hilt what if we ignore God's lamp and light 
uuto men? We do walk in darkness without 
-X% help, His guidance, His presence along 
? the way. Row well I know, I have walked 
both paths. And again, "As many as are led 
by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of 
God," Roman 8: 14. But if those who bear 
' His name (regardless of church affiliation) 
neither listen nor pay heed when that Spirit 
of the Almighty ("God is a spirit" John 4: 24) 
strives to urge and prompt the spirit (or 
heart of men) to lead and direct their steps, 
their words, their actions, in the best way, 
for their good and God's glory, they do not 
walk in all the privileges of "sons." 
May God bless and direct you day by day, 
? is my prayer. 
We plan to send the following telegram 
to the President, concerning the Vietnam 
? issue: 
"Mr. PanSIDENT: Do the leaders of this Na-
tion seek another Korea? How foolhardy. 
,"Mr. and Mrs. OTIS BEARD." 
These words of encouragement to stand 
firm and strong, in and with Gods help and 
guidance, are from the heart of some friends 
of the home State. 
God bless you, 
Mr. and MTS. OTIS BEARD.

DRAR SENATOR MORSE: Mrs. Deming and 
heard what you had to say on the Vietnam 
situation the other morning and were greatly 
Impressed by what you had to say on the 
subject. Your vigorous and forthright ap-
proach to this highly dangerous situation is 
encouraging. We hope your views prevail 
with the administration. We have written 
to President Johnson to this effect. 
You have plenty of fire and the courage 
of your convictions. Power to you.

'DEAR SENATOR MORSE: 
you on TV "Issues" very 
'former resident of Oregon 
The following article of mine appeared in 
the Plain Dealer of Cleveland on June I, 
1964: 
"The rightwing coup in Laos was prob-
ably promoted by the Central Intelligence 
Agency, in line with their past policies.

Detroit, Mich. 
DEAR Juno: Edwin A. Lahey, in his June 25 
headline story in the Free Press said, "At 
first it seemed like a political story. Henry 
Cabot Lodge was coming home from Sai-
gon ? ? but this is a war story." 
And war story it apparently Is?may God 
help and forgive us. 
Further in his news article, Lahey said, 
"Administration leaders for many weeks have 
been getting the public ready for the news 
that the only way he can avert disaster in 
southeast Asia is with a allow of force that 
the Communist Chinese will respect. 
"This theory, if taken to its next logical 
step would escalate the southeast Asia war 
to a point where the Chinese themselves 
will have to decide whether they want to 
take on the United States in another 
Korean-type action." 
Now. what is unsaid but follows as in-
evitably as death follows war, is that the 
escalated war to avert what they call dis-
aster in Vietnam will bring heartbreaking 
disaster to thousands and thousands of 
American homes through lost, killed, and 
maimed American sons. What 'about that 
disaster? It's great to talk abont saving 
Vietnamese but someone neglects to tell us 
that In the saving we sacrifice thousands 
of our own sons. fighting a war far a people 
who don't seem willing to light their own 
and in a country so far away the average 
American doesn't know where to look for 
it on the map. 
The people of the country never wanted 
any one of the last three wars we have had 
and they don't want this one. Then who 
does? 
RISER.

1964. 
It seems Mr. Johnson, Mr. McNamara, and 
Mr. Rusk are credited officially with the 
decision and behind it all is the soporific 
reason "to save face." and "give freedom to 
the Vietnamese". Poppycock. 
If it costs the life of your son or mine it 
Is not worth it. If the Vietnamese want 
aoramprtism let 'em have it. If they don't 
want it, let them fight against it. It looks 
like in all these situations a majority want 
what they get and we are siding with a mi-
marity. I'm sure that if a majority of any 
nation didn't want communism, they will 
eventually rebel and overthrow it just as did 
enjoyt d hearing our small rebellious colonies with England. 
much. I am a The principles are the same today, only the 
tools of war have changed. If we could and 
did do it with England, Vietnam can do it 
with communism if the majority want to 
desperately enough. If they don't, to hell 
with it?don't send my son to do it for them. 
I'm positive 99 percent of all American par-
ents and perhaps an equal percentage of 
eligible draftees feel we have too many sol-

DEAR SENATOR: I have just read in a Cana-

speeJa that the greatest threat to peace with 
the resulting possibility of bringing about a 
third world war in the world is the United 
States. 
I agree with you 100 percent. I note that 
none of the 'U.S. newspapers I read are 
reporting truthfully this fact to the peo-
ple. They aren't telling the people how this 
could be prevented.

Hon. WAYNE MORSE,

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: This continues my 
expression of appreciation and thanks for 
your efforts to have the Vietnam situation 
handled by a United Nations deliberation 
and possible presence of some kind. I wrote 
you longhand on the 26th, on hearing part 
of the interview by NBC with Senator 
CHURCH to follow up your presentation the 
day before. 
--After reading the various insertions and 
speeches in CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for the 
23d, the 25th, and 26th, I decided that a 
letter to NBC to include suggestion that 
-'"Eriore views be given how to get the United 
Nations into the scene might be in order. 
I enclose copy of my letter to let your office 
know that at least one person is asking for 
more TV appearances to get this U.N. idea 
out in the open. 
I do think that it is alarming to read, as 
you pointed out in your remarks, page 14301 
in RECORD of the 230, that after Senator 
CHURCH'S convincing speech on the United 
Nations, his views that It should be used 
in Vietnam situation, then that a series of

United Nations but then went on to hold

feat to a decision being made by the admin-

The tone of the NBC interview in asking 
about possihie use of U.N. was perhaps sin-

last week the views ofT two Senators on what 
moat of us agree la ii'topic of highest con-
cern to the peace ot -the world?our policy 
In Asia. Senator Motes on Thursday, the 
26th of June an4 Secnator Cireacir on the 
next day, Friday, the 26th combined to bring 
before your vast audience some of the issues 
and the concerti folieT each hold for efforts 
before the "United Notions to bring about 
peaceful solutions. 
This kind of attention to issues of the day 
Which has been heightened, It seems to me. 
In recent weeks, is good for the viewer's ad-
vantage in watching the "Today" show. 
I trust that the steeniingly critical note in 
tome remarks in tDe course of interview with 
Senator Citinicst, charged to Senator Molise 
(per his entry in the Coricnizseumeat, RECORD, 
page 14714, of 'Tune 26) will be corrected in 
some subsequent-statement. I had taped 
most of Senator Wise's interview and on 
playing it back / could not detect any basis 
for criticism of 'President Johnson as a "war-
monger". Yet in lisabing to the interview 
With Senator Cuoilettrhave the impression 
that some such fro'plfeation was unhappily 
leaven. We are all "aware' that Senator Moms 
in his entries in the vaird,ossIONAL RECORD 
has confined himself to views and opinions; 
similarly Senator-Mir:facia in Vs address on 
the United Nations On June 22, 1964, gave 
truch a detailed exialys 'debts views in reas-
oning for More Visa Of 11.N. peacekeeping 
machinery of the '0*.N. (especially column 2 
of page 14290, June 23) that many viewers 
might wish more- eitanded time on TV by 
these two Senetois who to the reader might 
teem gond choicei 'for more explanations to 
American audience 0 the possible advan-
tages of use of the United Nations. 
We hope that "TocaY" show will continue 
to try to give its 'citile attention to the ef-
fees toward use Of United Nations for peace-
keeping authority and influence.

DEAR WENATOR MORSE: Congratulations On 
your Magnificent TO talk of June 28. 
Would that other respected and influential 
Government officials would have the cour-
age to bring' the true state of affairs to the 
people. Neither do most of our newspapers 
live up to their obligation to inform the 
public by printing any background news 
such as, the why and how of happenings. 
For several years such magazines as the New 
Republic, Christian Century, Progressive, 
and even 'Newsweek have said that we have 
no business to be in Vietnani and that 
we were in violation of the 1964 Geneva 
agreement. But since a very small seg-
MeUt of the people- read these magazines 
they were voices crying in the wilderness, 
I'm afraid. Bo; am hopeful that your TV 
Interview, was seen by a great part of 
"thoughtful Americans and that it will in-
spire and encourage other like minded per-
sons to protest our present foreign policy. 
I am writing about this to the President and 
the State Department. As i registered Re-
publican (who finds it more ffiffcult each 
election to find a worthwhile Republican to 
vote for) / want to say that I am thankful 
that you and others such as Senators HUM-
POLBRIGHT, and liiismarreLe have the 
mental honesty and the courage to criticize 
our Government's actions when necessary 
and the wisdom to present : alternative ac-
tions.

I admire you so because you're triofriiirtspo-

ture on the line and speak out regardless of 
vote (not many Senators dare do this). I'm 
not from Oregon but you would make a great

DEAR SENATOR Monet: Listened to your in-

was extremely pleased and enlightened by 
your analysis of the problem and with your 
solution. As you may well imagine such 
a philosophy as yours Is very unpopular in 
the Shreveport area, and, for that matter 
throughout most of the South. but that's just 
the object of my card. For the first time to-
night I've heard an intelligent discussion of 
the situation and a well-thought-out and 
far-reaching plan for the eventual easing of 
tension and a return of the Government to 
the hands of the South Vietnamese. I know 
you'll continue to speak your mind on this 
vital issue and I just couldn't let this op-
portunity pass without adding what small 
encouragement I can. 
Very truly yours.

DEAR SENATOR Mows: This one American 
who agrees with you, and wholly. As you 
said Sunday, we usually assume a superior 
position that allows us the use of the prin-
ciple of any vile, dishonest, corrupt, or atro-
cious means are permitted us so long as we 
can attain our ends. Few know that the 
opponents of Vietnam. and others, are na-
tives, not aliens, lighting for what they think 
best. Yew have any 'foresight at all and so 
cannot see the Ill feelings, hopes for ven-
-geance, retaliation, etc., in store for us. We 
would fight like mad, hate, if anyone put his 
foot into our business. No one knows or 
sees that the Communist nations change 
their policies faster through experience than 
war.

with supplies to do their fighting with, but 
not our boys. Our boys belong here at home 
with their families and parents. 
I beIleve Tohnson will not remain Presi-

He should be made to lay It before the Unit-

July 9 
the "Today" show will rouse up millions and 
millions of Americans. When Judgment Day 
mine how will our President justfy his 
sending our boys to their deaths and Harry 
Truman for the war in Korea. How can he 
jtuafy for the many he sent to die in Korea. 
But at least he as you said turned it over to 
the 11.141'. Today our President told of send-
ing 500 more guerrilla fighters. But he 
should know as you and I know a guerrilla 
war they are experts at that type of fighting 
over there. This type of warfare is extremely 
difficult to win and even if it was won where 
wohld it leave us if Johnson pushes us into 
full scale war. If he is prepared to face our 
people, the parents of our men and explain 
to them why he made us face the loss of per-
haps 50,000 to 100,000 of our young men plus 
the enormous east to our Nation not only 
In lives but money. It would also mean a 
loss of face for us before the rest of the world, 
then how do we know Red China may not 
feel there Is nothing to lose in even a more 
direct challenge to America? We Americans 
may soon find we are faced or must make a 
drastic decision on Vietnam, and we better 
get used to it or toughen our thinking. Our 
efforts to train and aid them has brought no 
decisive results.

Senator WAYNE MORSE. 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR: We heard your TV interview 
Sunday. and agree with you wholeheartedly. 
In fact, President Johnson has just lost my 
vote, because I certainly would not vote for 
GOLDWATER, and because President Johnson 
Is talking war. Because both President 
Johnson anud ex-President Kennedy are not 
stopping this Government interference into 
the States. Governor Scranton will get my 
vote. 
The colored race should be given an edu-
cation. You can only force education, reli-
gion, etc.. just so far. They can be given 
the opportunities to learn, and should have 
them?but let them go from there. I am not 
with the Council of Churches, and many of 
our ministers are not, either. You cannot 
force me to like my neighbor. I must want 
to. You cannot make a student do anything 
but obey the laws of the school, but cannot 
force them to go to a library to learn more. 
There must be a line drawn. 
Our Government, our schools, and our 
churches must have laws. But they must 
only go so far. The people revolt?a natural 
thing. 
One the other hand, the Negroes must be 
made to understand, and should be made 
to understand (instead of giving into them) 
that the white race came up to where we are 
by hard work?by education?nothing has 
been given to us except our heritage from our 
ancestors: Now, they want it handed to them. 
Let them make it?instead of all this 
hullaballoo that is going on, dangerous as it 
may become?start working. Our working 
Negroes are not in this line of march. 
I blame the white people for what they are 
doing too. All of this force is no good?it will 
explode some place. I think what may hap-
pen down here is the fact that some busi-
nesses will be forced to close. We have some 
eating establishments that have hostesses?
they will seat the colored, to be sure when it 
Is law, If It is law?but where they want them 
to be seated. Education?both church and

_ 
Or its pitch dark anyway and your face?
do you still have a face??is fiat down in the 
mud. 
Nothing's fine when you hear a sharp, hard 
"ping"?a single shot?and you feel the man 
next to you in a jeep or helicopter suddenly 
strain his body against yours. A moment 
ago he was your friend. Now he is dead. 
He is lost, to everyone who loved him, and 
to the world. He will never see morning 
again, write a letter or sing a song. He has 
no hope and any hope of this world in him 
is gone forever. 
It's easy to discuss the problem of war?
in South Vietnam, Laos, anywhere. But this 
is different and it is the essence of war. 
One man. Men in their prime, dying one by 
one. 
General Eisenhower once said in a letter to 
Ernie Pyle: "/ get so eternally tired of the 
general lack of understanding of what the 
frontline soldier endures?the acceptance of 
unendurable conditions?that  I become com-
Pletely inarticulate." 
Or listen to Ernie Pyle himself. 
We were in Italy. An infantry column was 
coming out of battle. All ranks were 50 feet 
apart, for disPersal. So were Ernie and I. 
The wounded were lying with the dead be-
cause the Germans had shot our litter 
bearers when they stood up and walked over 
to get them. That night this is what Ernie 
wrote: 
"The line moves on but it never ends. All 
afternoon men kept coining around the hill 
and vanishing eventually over the horizon. 
There is agony in your heart. The sag of 
their bodies speaks their inhuman exhaus-
tion. They're Just guys from Brooklyn and 
Main Street, but you wouldn't remember 
them if you saw them. Their world can 
rieVer be known to you." 
Each day in South Vietnam armed Amer-
leans die quietly, tragically, unknowingly, 
obediently. 
Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, who personally 
takes over in South Vietnam now, recently 
admitted to the Armed Forces subcommit-
? tee that we control nothing there. 
Fine? As at the Bay of Pigs and the give-
away of Laos, the United States is defeated 
again.' But not a noisy debacle, mind you, 
nothing noisily noticeable. General Taylor's 
task is to see that the collapse stops short of 
that. 
On June 24 able Washington insider James 
Reston wrote in the New York Times: "This 
administration is not prepared to accept any 
spectacular defeat in South Vietnam, par-
ticularly in an election year." 
In short, Americans are just to die quietly, 
tragically, unknowingly, obediently?while 
nobody rocks the political boat until No-
vember. 
sn t there anything?anything, anything, 
anything?that can bring conscience into 
politics?

Senator THOMAS KUCHEL, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR KUCHEL : Senator WAYNE 
MORSE, of Oregon, is reported in today's news-
papers as saying that there is no justifica-
tion for the U.S. course in Vietnam, and that 
the only way a major war can be averted is 
for the American people to stop it. 
I agree with Senator MORSE. I agree also 
when he says that the greatest threat to the 
peace of the world is the United States. 
-U.S. military action in any part of Asia is 
inexcusable. We have here on our own con-
tinent problems of greater magnitude when 
.it comes to matters of social justice and 
_malignant behavior. 
I am requesting that you support Senator 
MORSE and oppose escalation of U.S. military 
action in Asia. The situation in South Viet- _ 
nam?and other areas of southeast Asia?
shoUld indeed be put before the United Na-
tions. 
Very truly yours, 
L. A. LAUER. 
SEATTLE, WASH., 
June 30, 1964. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have followed your 
speeches in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD with 
great interest and heartily agree with you 
and your colleagues who are opposed to the 
dangerous American adventure in South Viet-
nam and now in Laos. 
It is appalling that the adminisiration is 
supporting a government that does not have 
the backing of its people and steadily moving 
toward a potential world war. 
Even worse is the virtual blackout in our 
press of views such as yours. If more Ameri-
cans have access to the facts as raised by you 
there would be more opposition. 
I would appreciate receiving copies of your 
speeches so that I could inform others. 
Your courage is commendable. 
Sincerely, 
LYLE MERCER.

what you said a couple of mornings ago over 
the TV program, "Today," relative to Viet-
nam, and relative to the United States func-
tioning through the United Nations. 
Thank you for speaking for many fellow 
citizens, among whom I am one. 
God sustain you, in your forthright words, 
and your forthright deeds. 
Sincerely and respectfully,

HOU. WAYNE MORSE, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D .0 . 
DEAR Sm: Someone should tell you, I think, 
that your views as expressed on the "Issues 
and Answers" program on TV Sunday, June 
28, were very much appreciated. 
As you suggested?if we keep on moving 
down the blind alley that we are in now 
there may not be much to boast about after 
the smoke clears away. 
While to be sure I don't want Russia arm-
ing Cuba against us as they were doing at 
the time of the "missile crisis" it sure still 
beats the ham out of me to figure out how we 
could justify the bellowing we did at that 
time when we just stop to consider that we 
had men and military supplies in many 
areas of the Far East for years before Russia 
slipped into our hemisphere. 
As you said Sunday, war and especially 
nuclear war is unthinkable as a sensible 
means of settling disputes. Let pride be 
damned if it must but there is just no sense 
in saving face at the reckless expense of a 
ruined future for millions of people includ-
ing ourselves quite likely. My mother had 
four sons and one daughter and ended up 
with five of us in the armed services at one 
time or another and I'm telling you that if 
I feel any more secure today than I did be-
fore the first one of us went, it is simply 
because I've learned not to let the state of 
international affairs worry me so much as it 
once did. All our armed might, mighty as 
it is, has merely, so far as I'm concerned, 
made our problems greater instead of our 
world safer. 
Incidentally, wouldn't that BARRY GOLD-
WATER be a reckless reuben in case he should 
get charge of things in an emergency? I 
really believe he stands out as a freedom 
? smasher. 
Mr, MORSE, I hope I haven't been too dis-
tasteful for your digestion and may God

Dear SENATOR From's; I heartily agree with 
you in regard to our present policy in Viet

I have asked the HOIable hdlat E. Steven-
son Why the United States is going it alone 
in South Vietoarn, why a UN. force Isn't 
there, but have not had a satisfactory reply. 
Also, what has happened to SEATO? 
/ am extremely worried that the war in 
Vietnam may lead to World War HI. God 
'forbid, 
How can ths United States glibly talk peace 
while spending enormous amounts of money 
for arms and interfering in civil wars? 
I object having my tax dollars (I'm ea and 
would like to aentiretire) handed out to 
South Vietnam nr any other country where 
we have no right to be. My heart aches for 
the poor Vietnamese Who have endured un-
told suffering for so Many years. How heart-
less can we get? 
I am proud of you, Senator MORSE, and 
agree with your statement to the Senate 
"that this country will go down in history 
as the nation claiefly responsible for scuttling 
the United 'Nations"- It appears our faith 
In the TIN. is badly shaken. 
Do you sUppOss that one of these days 
before it's too late that others in Washington 
Will come to their sew' es/ Or, are they en-
joying the cold war and interfering in the 
self determination of,nther peoples? 
Thank you for your cOurage. My hope 
and prayer is that soon others will join you 
in protesting the continuation of the war 
in Vietnam. Its ant Men who are losing 
their lives needlessly.

I fear a "prevention" war toward Red

could lead to war with a nation such as Red 
China. We felt we were entering on her

in such situations. Our leaders make the

Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR Mons: I had the good for-
tune of being present in the Senate gallery 
on June 29 when you made your speech 
criticizing the U.S. foreign policy of military 
intervention in southeast Asia. I applaud 
both your stand against the United States 
policy in Vietnam and your suggestion for 
the establishment in troubled areas of a 
peace force under the direction of the 
United Nations. 
A specific issue which I as a professional 
botanist am concerned about Is the we by 
the United States of chemical defoliants on 
the Vietnam flora. Use of chemical defoli-
ants is a form of CBE warfare which we (the 
United States) categorically deny using. I 
suppose it is argued that economic, crops are 
not sprayed and therefore the people are not 
affected. Nevertheless severe damage to the 
local flora will quickly lead to an imbalance 
in both plant and animal communities and 
eventually will have a direet affect on the 
inhabitants. The ultimate magnitude of the 
destruction of such a defoliation program 
cannot be Imagined. 
The responsibility that you show by mak-
ing public the important lame of the mili-
tary situation In southeast Asia is greatly 
needed. I can only hope that other ears 
were tuned to your speech.

MORSE HITS OUR ASIA PUPPET SHOW 
WasmnoTon.?Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Democrat, of Oregon, charged again yester-
day that the United States is an outlaw 
nation fighting a unilateral war in southeast 
Asia. 
_ The Senator called South Vietnam this 
puppet of ours. 
MORSE said it may be true that Red China 
and North Vietnam are violating the Geneva 
accords on Laos, but that two wrongs do not 
make a right. 
He charged the 'United States is pursuing 
a course of action outside the charter of 
the United Nations. 
Speaking on a television program, MORSE 
said that a peacekeeping operation sup-
ported by 'U.S. SEATO allies ought to take 
the place of unilateral U.S. action until 
such time as the United Nations can move in 
with its own force. 
He rejected the notion that in the time it 
takes to set up such operations the Commu-
nists can move in. He said it would not take 
as much time as most people claim. 
MORSE said he had faith in President John-
son, "But I think he's being ill advised." 
MoasE, a Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee member, said Mr. Johnson doesn't 
want war, but American policies in South 
Vietnam and Laos are escalating the fight-
ing against Communist forces while Red 
China has 200,000 troops poised on its borders

which I sent to the President and to Senator 
KUCHEL last evening: 
"I do not believe that either honor or com-
monsense are served by U.S. military involve-
ment in southeast Asia. Threats against 
China may deter temporarily but they will in-
crease enmity. This is the road to war, now 
or in our children's time. It may put the 
human race in jeopardy. Real responsibility 
to mankind requires that we act through the 
U.N. and set our own house in order." 
Is it not strange that we are willing to risk 
a nuclear war to defend the freedom of Asian 
peasants who want nothing so much as to be 
let alone, yet we cannot defend the right of 
many of our own citizens to vote, or the lives 
of our idealistic young people who are willing 
to sacrifice so much for freedom here?

DEAR MR. MORSE: Your comments On OUT 
Far East policy made on TV this past Sunday 
were indeed refreshing and swelled me with 
pride. Thank goodness for an alternative 
position?regardless of right or wrong. The 
inipiiitant thing is that your views, in con-
trast to a general policy of escalated war or 
one of "let's get it over with now," provides 
a real choice between peace and war. I 
salute you for speaking out as you did. Also 
it was indeed a pleasure to listen to a politico 
who said substantially what he believed rath-

patronizing speech one has become so ac-
customed to hearing.

aware Of t e ,qmsa,brablwashing broadcasts 
that are being put out-this week to sell the 
radio audience on theidea that all we seek 
in the Vietnam ,and Laetian-arga Is peace and 
liberty ? ? that if war 'Should come in 
spite of our peaceful bombhik and strafings 
and general forcefiff interference in the af-
fairs of these unfOrtithate People, It will be 
because the Chinese people want to pick 
a fight with us. 
Not only this btit deliberate intent exists 
to pin the label of communism on anyone 
Who feels that we should get out of that area 
Qui turn the problem over to the U.N. 
I am satisfied that this is not just CBS but 
is a Government (State Department) broad-
cast worked put vilth CBS in the best style 
of Adolph Hitler who proclaimed his peace-
ful Intentions as he Moved into Czecho-
slovakia, and Austria-in the days when he 
was telling the world that be didn't seek 
war ? * didn't want war, was hellbent 
on peace, even if he had to put people into 
stockades and shoot their official leadership 
to achieve it. /t seems to me that it is news 
When a Senator from the great State of Ore-
On, a Member of the governing party, breaks 
'With the President and the military on a 
major question of foreign policy. If so, It 
Is a reflection on our so-called free press that 
there is little or no publicity given to your 
effort to save not just our good name, but the 
lives Of many, many fine young Americans. 
Why are not the newspapers and the radio 
and facilities that claim to give us the 
whole truth and nothing but the truth bury-
ing yaw efforts and doing everything in 
their power to paralyze the Intelligence and 
commonsense and. Christian feelings of the 
Nation?

and sufficient reason to support the State

ment anyhow, when we go to war without 
congressional approval or debate?

Dzsa Ma. Moasz: Just heard you on TV 
and we were with you on the Vietnam situ-
ation and the U.N., etc. You were line. 
Now for some questions and answers, 
please. 
Politics in both parties are going full blast 
now, viz the "war on poverty" and unem-
ployment, and more economy. Seems of 
much concern to our Government and the 
President at this time. While at the same 
time the House passed an outrageous pay 
rates to Cabinet officers. Supreme Court Jus-
tices, district justices, House Doorkeeper, 
postmasters, Federal civil service. Federal 
civil service employees also enjoy fringe 
benefits, vacation pay (generous), sick leave, 
retirement benefits, and provided maximum 
job security; also a great percentage of Dis-
trict of Columbia Federal workers are colored. 
last but not least the House voted them-
ithes and the Senate it nice raise also again, 
since last yearr. Where is our dollar? "An 
indefensible raid upon the Treasury," so 
states the Human Events?a weekly Wash-
ington report. "Our Government debt is 
sky high." 
Where do the retired and "over" age 
(limit) come in these days? Some living on 
very small pension or social security. Going 
back to 1959, what have the House and 
Senate given our retired personnel and &II-
cere, especially the military? 
Too many of World Wars land II,had hard 
and brilliant careers in Army, Navy, and 
other services, with disabilities, unable to 
work out a full life, small penir_ons only. 
Why shouldn't these retired, capable men 
and women deserve some raises also? Last 
year they were the forgotten ones and again 
this year. So far the one or two raises since 
1958 have been pitifully small. This year 
again, nothing for the retired military man. 
eine of our living heroes, Sergeant York, has 
existed on $OO (and less at first) for many 
years, knit not even a plaque in methory of 
his heroin-Tn. 
My hue-band was in both wars?in its worst 
places?and when he retired with a pen-
sion ?not enough in return for his service?
he was not allowed dual occupation. Where 
Senators, for instance, reach ripe old age and 
stilt in service with a good salary even in 
retirement. 
How about the Senators and the law-
making honorable bodies making the laws 
instead of allowing the honorable Supreme 
Cowl to reign supreme?and get back to 
the Constitution of our country. 
Thank you for listening. 
Very truly and respectfully yours, 
SUSAN P. JONES. 
OTEGO, N.Y., 
June 29,1964. 
DEAR SENATOR Monsr: It was very gratif y-
ing to see and hear you on TV the other day. 
It's about time that someone got on the floor 
and told the truth about South Vietnam and 
the whole Asian question. Are we the police 
department for the whole world, I thought 
we had the U.N. for these trouble spots. 
I agree with you, this administration is 
beta on escalating the war or wars in Asia 
and It looks to me and to others, that a 
behtiaci-the-door deal has been made. The 
Russians are pulling out of Cuba; for what 
reason? Is it a deal in which we are to clip 
Red China's wings, to save the Russians the 
job, I wonder? 
Any way, it certainly would be the height 
of folly for this country to start to tangle 
with Red China. Our boys would just be put 
down the drain, sacrificed for nothing, as no 
matter what manpower we put in Asia it 
would be swallowed up and nothing accom-
plished. 
Was no lesson learned from Prance's dismal 
record in Indochina? The same man that 
heat the French is now doing it to us, / say 
Asia for the Asiatics, keep our boys and our 
tax money to home. I hope you get up in the 
Senate and howl good and loud; maybe it will 
penetrate up to high what we want. It took 
Senator KEATING to expose the Cuban fiasco; 
you can do the same with the Asian one. 
Another thing, these Negroes should be 
gotten off the streets with their fake pas-
sive demonstrations. It's all bunk. They are 
not too interested in civil rights; when they 
finally get them by law, they will not use 
them to advantage. Their big interest and 
major aim is intermarriage; they want to be 
white, that's their major aim. I ought to 
know how they think. I've lived with them 
for a time. If demonstrations are not 
stopped, there will be much bloodshed, I am 
sure. 
Good luck to you on Vietnam. 
A. G. HARWOOD. 
ST. PAUL, MINN.,

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I support your point 
of view on the situation in Vietnam. 
I think that talk of expanding that war is 
insanity. 
I share the opinion of the French Foreign 
Minister that this war is primarily an in-
ternal political war. 
It appears to me that we are again backing 
a strong man against the will of the local 
people. 
Information seems to be coming out now 
that the CIA is behind much of our foreign 
problems. Even going so far as to override 
Presidential decisions. 
I think the CIA should be curtailed at 
once. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK B. SCHWARTZ.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I believe your stand 
on the South Vietnam question is absolutely 
correct. The United States is guilty of break-
ing International law just as the Communists 
are. It appears that we are just as desperate 
to gain control of this piece of property for 
the sake of prestige as they are to set up 
another Communist country. Being 17 years

old it scares me to think that I might have 
to serve my cotititry in an undeclared and il-
legal war. 
The answer, Of course, is the United Na-
tions. It was created to handle this type of 
situation. If the United States has no faith 
in its power to settle this dispute, the U.N. 
is doomed. You must continue to fight. We 
can't continue to turn our backs to the truth 
much longer. I know you have been criti-
cized on your stand. Well, keep in mind that 
there must always be men like you around 
to blast some sense into Uncle Sam?keep it 
up. I am now going to write Senator 
DOUGLAS on this matter, I think he can be 
one of your helpers.

ing ourselves from that nation. I inclose an

I agree with your views wholeheartedly. It 
Is a dreadful mistake for us to be escalating 
the war in Vietnam as we surely are doing 
and seem to be about to continue doing. It 
can only lead to a real major war. NATO 
and SEATO are our only hope and we must 
call upon these in as forceful a way as can 
be managed and now. I have just written 
to President Johnson to express these same 
views. I hope a lot of other people do the 
same, so he can realize the people are not 
supporting this dangerous new policy. 
Thank you for speaking out.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: After hearing your 
Interview on television, I am hastening to 
write you and applaud you from the bottom 
of my heart. What you had to say was so 
true, so logical and to the point. Ton seem 
to be one of the very few brave souls left. 
Our treatment of South Vietnam and Cuba 
has been a, disgrace and has lost us respect 
and friends. 
I do hope that President Johnson, whom 
I believe, as you do, really wants peace and 
the welfare of mankind in general, will take 
your advice rather than that of the military 
and others who have selfish interests in 
keeping animosities alive. 
-I lost all respect and confidence in Adlai 
Stevenson when he lied about our part in 
the Cuban affair. I have never been so dis-
illusioned in a man as I have in him. He has 
no stamina or principle left. 
How I wish that there were more men like 
you among our politicians. We could then 
look forward to a brighter and safer future 
for these United States. 
God bless you. 
Yours sincerely,

I have felt strongly for some time. In the

moral reasons for not wanting a war. My

is no solution as well we know. My older son

living happily in Kellogg, Idaho. I have a

to do to help to make this a better world at

be taking in Vietnam. We believe that our 
national interests will be better served by 
going to the conference table as soon as 
possible. To extend military action will not 
make us friends. Napalm bombs and de-

seem to increase our opponents.

stand you have taken on U.S. policy on South 
Vietnam. I agree completely with your be-
lief that American troops should be with-
drawn from Vietnam?on legal grounds, their 
presence violates the 1954 Geneva accord; 
on moral ground, the United States has no 
right to force the regime of our serpentine 
satrap Khanh down the throats of the Viet-
namese people. and on military grounds, 
as a U.S. Arm veteran, I feel pretty sure 
that our military program is hopeless. 
Your courage?and foresight?on this is-
sue are commendable, and your speeches and 
statement' are in the finest tradition of 
American politics. Just as we (rightly) 
criticize the police state that the Russians 
have imposed on the East Germans. we must

what you have correctly called "a threat to

in Asia. Por although I take four of them,

of war. Can't even get a "letter to the editor

this insanity. 
The warmongers and industrial-military

have gained control of this country. I 
understand every nation but this wishes to 
arbitrate or negotiate neutralism in south-
east Asia. But they prefer countless thou-
sands of our youth be slaughtered and muti-
lated defending another corrupt military 
dictatorship in Asia. How many thousands 
were killed and maimed to produce the dic-
tatorship in Korea with recent riots against 
Its corruption? Were hundreds of thousands 
of the flower of French youth slaughtered 
before they were driven out? I would appre-
ciate as an American citizen your answering 
me the above and the following questions: 
1. Has Congress given up its sole power 
to declare war, thus making this country a 
military dictatorship? 
2. What is the authority of this country 
for establishing protectorates in Asia backed 
with military occupation and the power of 
one man to send the country to war? 
3. Is the enclosed statement, that appeared 
in a San Francisco newspaper true? 
4. In the "aid to South Vietnam bill" will 
you include free passage to the frontlines 
for these warmongers so anxious to defend 
corrupt military dictatorships to relieve them 
of sitting comfortably in front of their TV 
seta listening to the news of hundreds of 
thousands of our youth and sons being 
butchered, to keep their prestige and 
Interests? 
6. Is the foreign policy of this country to 
encourage, aid and abet, and protect military 
dictatorships throughout the world even at 
the cost of thousands of our youth killed? 
Are they afraid to use nuclear weapons as 
they might get hurt themselves? No wonder 
we have to go it alone. 
The world will love this country when It 
Invades Asia. and you can count on me to 
expose the butchers from the top down. 
Hundreds I've talked with feel the same.

Is It moral to slaughter peasants for a 
corrupt dictatorship engaged in a brutal and 
hopeless civil war? 
Do U.S. security interests, as defined by 
the cold warriors, have a priority over the 
rights of self-determination of the southeast 
Asian peoples? Do the former, in fact con-
flict with the latter? 
Perhaps a partial answer to these ques-
tions lies in the conduct of U.S. foreign 
policy in Laos in 1958. From 1955 to 1957 
In accordance with the Geneva agreement, 
the neutralist government under Souvanna 
Phouma had stabilized itself and demobilized 
most of the Pathet Lao armies. In 1958 
elections were held and resulted in a aub-
at:tattlel popular victory for the Puthet Lao 
and other leftist forces. The United States 
thel eupon suppressed the democratic elec-
tions by supporting, politically and mili-
tarily, a rightwing coup.

Senator WAYNE MORSE,

Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SineaTos Moasz: I would like to com-
mend you for your realistic position concern-
ing our involvement in South Vietnam's 
civil war. I have discussed this issue with 
many religious, educational, business, and 
civil leaders in my community and they. in 
July 9 
the great majority, completely support your 
position. 
I realize that President Johnson must be 
careful how he handles this controversial 
Issue, this being an election year. I am sure 
that our President would like to wash his 
hands of this mess, as much as any of us, 
providing It wouldn't hurt him politically. 
However, I sincerely believe that if you 
could persuade President Johnson to be hon-
est with qur citizens and to make known to 
the public the true facts that you have been 
courageously revealing about our involve-
ment in this war, the great majority of our 
citizens will support your position. 
The failure of President Johnson to reveal 
these realities will encourage our cold war 
politicians to utilize this issue to: their polit-
ical advantage. I hope that you can per-
suade President Johnson to see this danger. 
I would appreciate any material you have 
on this issue so that I can help support your 
stand. 
Very sincerely, 
LEON SHAPIRO.

Draft SENATOR: I scan the newspapers and 
I am extremely dissatisfied with information 
about the U.S. policy in the Indochina area 
of east Asia. 
Today I read Edwin Lahey's article on 
your speeches on this subject. I am deeply 
alarmed about our policy in this area. I feel 
our policy violates the United Nations Char-
ter. Also as a practical matter I believe 
President Johnson is trying to prove he is 
tougher than Mao Tse-tung with the fate 
of mankind in balance. Mao is probably the 
toughest, shrewdest opponent he has faced. 
Will you please send me all your speeches 
you have made on this subject this year and 
any other material you can send. Please 
reply. This is my third letter / have written 
to you without response. 
Yours sincerely 
Lours FLuse.

It is very heartening and encouraging to 
hear a Democrat dare to criticize the Presi-
dent's policies in Asia. I thought you were 
magnificent and couldn't help but laugh at 
the way you said everything you wanted to 
say, instead of being interviewed and led 
into answering the questions Ray Scherer 
and Nancy had evidently prepared to ask 
you. /t does my heart good every time a real 
redblooded American patriot stands up and 
speaks the truth fearlessly. You are right 
about the people not being behind "Mc-
Namara's War." I have felt ever since he 
was appointed that he was a ruthless, opin-
ionated pip squeak and that we have con-
sistently lost face and ground since he was 
put in 'Charge of our defense. / also agree 
that General Taylor should never have been 
put in Henry Cabot Lodge's place. It is

DEAR MR. Moms: Congratulations upon 
your analysis d expressed convictions on 
the Vietnam situation. I saw you on the 
"Today" show June 25 and I thoroughly con-
cur with your views that the United States 
should make a desperate effort to have the 
United Nations handle the situation rather 
than try to deal with it militarily on a uni-
lateral basis. 
I am president of the Head of the Lakes 
'Chapter of the Association for the United 
Nations and am greatly concerned for peace 
and feel the U.N. is our best hope for keep-
ing the peace. For years T have talked and 
preached more solid support of the U.N. on 
the part of the United States. 
How do your fellow Senators stack up on 
this issue? Do you have much support 
there? 
Would it be possible to have a copy of your 
presentation of June 25, or another address 
In which you have dealt with this subject? 
May your tribe increase and rapidly. 
Cordially yours,

realistic views on the different political 
Issues pertaining to the foreign policy of our 
great country. 
During World War n I was in Greece. We 
suffered under the German-Italian-Bulgar-

war against the Communists. I have a bitter 
personal experience of war. 
I could not help to write to you and ex-
press my admiration for your healthy and

I will appreciate it very much if you send

I would much appreciate it if you will be 
good enough to mail me copies of some of

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have been doing 
my best to follow American policy and action 
in southeast Asia. Frgm what little I have 
been able to find in the newspapers (New 
York Times and Washington Post) about 
your position, I support it fully. Please keep 
up your good work. We appear to be at the 
brink with no room within the present policy 
to turn to new means to resolve our conflicts. 
It is very disappointing to read today's Post 
and see them all but ,declare war on China 
and North Vietnam. 
Since I have found it so difficult to find 
your Senate speeches reported with any de-
tail in the press. I would like to know if you 
could send me copies of your major speeches 
on Laos and South Vietnam for the last few 
months? If it is available, I would appreci-
ate earlier speeches too. 
Please continue your efforts and please 
keep reporting your views to the American

DEAR SIR: Your interview this morning on

straightforward. It gave facts which needed 
to be brought to the attention of the Ameri-
can people long before this. I hope it is not 
too late. 
I am sure that my friends and neighbors 
who did not hear and see you this a.m. would 
very much appreciate having a copy of this

Sena/0/ WAYNE MORSE, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: For months, I and 
many of my acquaintances and friends have 
followed the lonely battle that you and 
others, though much too few, in the Senate 
have been waging against the brutal and 
dangerous policy of the United States in 
Vietnam. Your courage and your honesty 
are among the brightest spots in the morass 
that our Congress seems to be sinking in. 
As I write, I almost feel that I am writing 
to someone I am close to personally, and a 
typewriter, is a most inadequate instrument 
to convey my admiration for you through. 
I hope it is important to you to know that 
there are individuals like myself, and many 
others, who share with you an intense re-
Vulsion against our policies in Vietnam. This 
is an issue that I believe must be carried 
to the American people, one which, I be-
lieve, might be able to prick their collective 
conscience if the facts were known. With 
this in mind, I would like to ask you to send 
me as much of your materials on the Viet-
15677 
nameSe situation as you can: speeches, in-
serts into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, arti-
cles, fact sheets, etc. To the extent that I 
can, I will use these materials to publicize 
the issues and your own activities. I am 
chairman of a campus organization called 
Voice on the University of Michigan cam-
pus, which is a chapter of Students for a 
Democratic Society, a growing national stu-
dent organization which is very concerned 
about American policy throughout the un-
derdeveloped world. We believe that Vietnam 
may be all too typical of a pattern which 
may be developing. 
You may be interested to know that this 
letter was immediately prompted by the ap-
pointment of General Taylor to replace Mr. 
Lodge as Ambassador to Vietnam, a move 
which I feel bodes further ill ,to that be-
leaguered country and to the Americans 
who, I fear, in increasing numbers, may be 
sent there to fight and perhaps to die. It 
was also prompted by an article I read in the 
Cleveland Press yesterday in which you were 
quoted as saying that the United States "Is 
heading for a war in Asia and will be hated 
by a majority of mankind for the next 600 
years." I am ashamed to have to say that 
I fear you are right. Any help I may be to 
help you in your battle against this sense-
less war is at your disposal. 
Looking forward to hear from you and 
receive your materials, I am, 
Sincerely yours, 
RICHARD F. MAGIDOFF. 
P.5.?If you might be interested in more 
information about Students for a Democratic 
Society, and particularly our activities re-
garding Vietnam, please Let me know.

zens, men and women, are protesting. The 
methods used by our leaders are more cruel 
than murder because there is no way they 
can be put on trial. The pretenses expressed 
in the cause of freedom are either a figment 
of imagination or the perpetration of evil 
for the purpose of gain. I cannot believe 
that they can succeed against forces for the 
preservation of mankind. 
I am deeply grateful to you for your brav-
ery and enlightenment in the face of blind-
ness and mistaken ideas promoted by both

Larrnms ro rue Eerroa, 
Los Angeles, Calif.: 
The /AS. Government would have the 
American people believe we are fighting for 
"freedom" in South Vietnam, when actually 
we are intervening in a civil war. I agree 
with Senator WAYNE McRae that the United 
States has violated the U.N. Charter, making 
us an outlaw Nation. Are we fighting for 
American freedom 10,000 miles from home? 
Are we protecting the people of South Viet-
? nam by consistently supporting a succession 
of corrupt, repressive, dictator regimes that 
have never had the support of the people? 
Reliable sources tell us that the Saigon gov-
ernment has the allegiance of no more than 
30 percent of the people. We are not being 
told the truth about Vietnam. By labeling 
the Vietcong Communist we overlook the 
fact that the Vietcong, or properly called the 
National Liberation Front, is a coalition of 
many groups, peasants, certain Buddhist 
sects. the Cambodian minority and ethnic 
tribes, students, intellectuals, several politi-
cal parties including the Communists. The 
NLP has the support of 70 percent of the 
Vietnamese people. The $10 million that 
General Khanh boasts about came out of 
our pockets. We continue this immorality 
by giving Khanh $1.5 million additional daily 
to bight a war that even military experts say 
can't be won. If the United States is a moral 
Nation, we should be negotiating a peaceful 
settlement, instead of sending more Ameri-
cans to be killed, instead of rattling our 
sabers at China and the whole of southeast 
Asia, instead of threatening to carry the war 
Into North Vietnam and risking the possibil-
ity of a full-fledged nuclear war.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I VMS appalled the

express displeasure at the appointment of 
General Taylor as Ambassador to South Viet-

Though I am not one of your constitutents, 
I take the liberty of writing to you because 
you represent my point of view in this mat-
ter?and to you rather than Senator AIKEN 
beGRILS0 I met you once when you were visit-
ing here in my community of Highland Park 
a few years ago. 
It seems to me that the appointment of 
General Taylor infers a hardening of our 
pursuit of a military solution for the prob-
lems of southeast Asia?and further limits 
our freedom to choose some other method 
which could more nearly serve our true na-
tional interests in this area. 
I understand that you have made some

went there to get a lot of Americans killed in

to us. Johnson, Stevenson, Rusk and Mc-

DEAR Srs.: Thanks for your fight to get this 
country out of southeast Asia where it had 
no business being in violation of the final 
declaration of the Geneva Conference to 
which the United States was supposed to be 
In accord. 
The United States insists it is a Christian, 
law-abiding nation but after reading of our 
atrocities in Laos and South Vietnam I 
would like to know upon what we base that 
claim. 
Insist upon that war being taken to the 
United Nations, where it belongs, and where 
this Government is preventing it from being 
settled. 
Thanks again for your efforts, however fu-
tile, since I fear you are up against great 
odds.

DEAR Szeraroa no-DD: You and your con-
freres should do something right soon about 
getting this situation under control and our 
people pulled out of that rat trap. 
Once the gerieral public wakes up to the 
fact this Vietnam-Laos fiasco is another 
Korea in the making?which is exactly what 
it is?one LBJ and some few Members of the 
present Congress Might well find themselves 
looking for other work come November 3. 
The great altruists, Who never get into 
combat, say we can't back out of Vietnam 
because we will lose face. 
Well, the French pulled out after com-
mitting some 400,000 men over a period of 
years, and is Mr, DeGaulle's face red? 
Hardly. He is laughing at us. 
After all, what is this word 'lace"? Is it 
not a gentle metaphor for "raw power"?or 
the lack of same? 
President Johnson tella us there is no 
Country on this globe we could not com-
pletely annihRate 8 Or 80 times over in a 
matter of hours?and they all know It. 
So I do not' thini we need be too much 
Concerted about our "face." 
But the Congress- had better get desper-
ately concerned about cox:limiting the lives 
Of our children and our grandchildren?and 
at once. 
If this situation has not been cleared be-
fore November there Is likely to be such a 
good of protest votes against all now in 
Office--excepting those who stand with Sen-
ator Moasn?as could. quite possibly swing 
the election. 
Dont forget Senator, the women now vote 
and every mother in this benighted country 
Is violently opposed to any more Koreas. 
With them this matter carries an in-
finitely greater priority than all the sound, 
fury, and blather the integrationista can 
atir up. My wife has told me. 
You have built' up some little prestige in 
Washington, Senator, and deservedly so. 
There will never come a better time for 
you to exert it. 
Most sincerely, 
HORACE D. &mono.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: This letter is to ex-
press my deep appreciation of your criticism 
of our present policy in South Vietnam. I 
was shocked when I saw the headlines in the 
paper saying that the President was con-
sidering the risk of all-out war in South 
Vietnam "in the interests of peace." / con-
sidered the statement wholly irresponsible 
and extremely dangerous. But I felt corn-
pletely frustrated because t could not see 
anything that I could do to stem this drift 
toward war with China, except to write a 
letter to the President which I have done. 
Your statement gave me' a ray of hope 
that sanity would prevail. I live in a uni-
versity town and I can say that none a my 
friends favor the policies we are now follow-
ing. I feel certain that the majority Of the 
people of the United States are with you. 
I also want to express my appreciation of 
your support of the public ownership of the 
Pacific Northwest-Pacific Southwest extra 
high-voltage intertie and of your support of 
the acreage limitation provision of the Rec-
lamation Act.

in Vietnam. I know that you are very busy 
with your work in the Senate, but I feel that 
if you could perhaps make your views more 
available to more people; to talk on tele-
vision, to somehow reach the people, and let 
everyone know that there is another road 
to settle the Vietnam situation, namely 
through the U.N. and not by the way Mr. 
McNamara and, unfortunately, President 
Johnson are doing by involving us deeper 
and deeper in this war.

fight. I've never _known ,ona_soldicr_ in a

a dozen other reasons combined; but oh, no, 
not that one. Along with hunger, fear is a 
universal emotion. It has nothing to do with 
bravery. Anybody with any sense is afraid. 
Fine? -Nothing's fine when you're getting 
shot at. 
NOTHING'S FINE IN COMBAT 
Nothing's fine when you start to count the 
missing and the dead, arid you do not know 
how it could happen that one of them is not 
you. 
Nothing's fine when the road blows up and 
your eyes go blind because something 
smashed them closed. You're afraid to open

Or it's pitch dark anyway and your face?

ping?a single shot?and you feel the man 
next to you in a jeep or helicopter suddenly 
strain his body against? yours. A moment 
ago he was your friend. Now he is dead. 
He is lost, to everyone who loved him, and 
to the world. He will never sLci morning 
again, write a letter, or sing a 'song. He has 
no hope and any hope of this world in him 
Is` gone forever. 
It's easy to discuss the problem of war?
in South Vietnam, Laos, anywhere. But this 
'IS different and it is the essence of war. 
One man. Men in their prime, dying one by 
one. 
WHAT IKE TOLD ERNIE PYLE 
General Eisenhower once said in a letter 
to Ernie Pyle: "I get so eternally tired of the 
general lack' of understanding of what the 
frontline soldier endures?the acceptance of 
unendurable conditions?that I become com-
pletely inarticulate." Or listen to Ernie Pyle 
himself. 
We were in Italy. An infantry column 
was coming out of battle. All ranks were 
fip feet apart; for dispersal. So were Ernie 
and I. The wounded were lying With the dead 
because the Germans had shot our litter 
bearers when they -stood up and Walked over 
to get them. That night this is what Ernie 
wrote: 
"The line moves on but it never ends. All 
afternoon men kept coming around the hill 
and vanishing eventually' over the horizon. 
There is agony in your heart " *. The sag 
of their bodies speaks their in human ex-
haustion * * '0. They're just guys from 
Brooklyn and Main Street, but you wouldn't 
'remember them if you saw them * * *. Their 
world can never be known to you." 
Each day in South Vietnam armed Ameri-
cans die quietly, tragically, unknowingly, 
obediently. 
THE tr.s.DEFEA'rss AGAIN 
? Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, who personally 
takes over in South Vietnam now, recently 
admitted to the Armed Forces Subcommittee 
that we control nothing there. "We corn-
=and nothing," he agreed. Fine? As at the 
Bay of Pigs and the giveaway at Laos, the 
United States is defeated again. But not a 
noisy debacle, mind you, nothing noisily no-
ticeable. General Taylor's task is to see that 
the collapse stops short of that. 
On June 24 able Washington insider James 
Reston wrote in the New York Times: "This 
administration is not prepared to accept any 
spectacular defeat in South Vietnam, partic-
ularly in an election year." 
In short, Americans are just to die quietly, 
tragically, unknowingly, obediently?while 
-hobo sr rocks the political boat until Novem-
ber. 
Isn't there anything?anything, anything, 
anything?that can bring conscience into 
politics?

the whole question. 
As I just wrote to Senator Ciabinnwo, Red 
China is a problem but it will be better

Mainland =ma but face to face with the. 
whole world. We must "solve" the problem 
with clean hands. The days of 1898 must 
not be repeated in another area of the world.

to have hegemony over northern and the 
United States to hive hegemony over the

AN OPEN' LL:TrEa TO THE H.S. DEPARTMENT or

WAR ni VIETNAM 
The United States Is a foreign party to a 
civil war in Vietnam. Fifteen thousand U.S. 
uniformed personnel have been committed 
to the battle. Casualties include American 
soldiers. 
Acceleration of the American war effort in 
South Vietnam invites increased aid by China 
to the Communist Vietnamese. Stepping up 
the war effort risks the use by either side of 
nuclear arms. Nuclear war offers no victory. 
What is the alternative? 
Negotiation is urged by Senator Wayne 
Morse, Senator Ernest Gruening, Columnist 
Walter Lippmann, and others. Recognizing 
it takes both sides to make peace, we urge 
Our Government to initiate a conference of 
nations to guarantee a neutral Vietnam. We 
support U.S. efforts to insure enforcement of 
agreements. The United Nations can assist 
direct negotiation. Inspection teams must 
be free to operate wherever needed. They 
can be backed by frontier patrols. 
The best guarantee of enforcement is the 
mutual advantage of the agreement. The 
goal is a Vietnam whose independence is 
guaranteed and respected.

The HONORABLE WAYNE MORSE, 
V.S. Senator from Oregon,

Dram Sinveroe MORSE: Enclosed is reprint 
of three-quarter page advertisement-state-
ment which appeased in the Cleveland Plain 
D-Wer the day the U.S. State Department 
had a foreign policy briefing session here. 
It made a stir, as you will note from the 
report to the ad sponsors, also enclosed. 
From Mr. Sullivan and Secretary Dean 
Rusk I gather it is U.S. policy to continue 
fighting until South Vietnam is established 
by defeating the guerilla forces, then offer 
to negotiate on the premise there is to be 
a separate South Vietnam, 
July 9 
Since Ho Chi-Minh has been fighting for 
18 years or more for a united Vietnam there 
is an obvious deadlock. I see no justifica-
tion for continuing a war, with resulting loss 
of American and Vietnamese life, which 
would have ended years ago but for Ameri-
can intervention. 
The support of the ad sponsors of yourself 
is Self-evident. We hope in some small 
measure to show Americans that our policy 
should be negotiation now on the ground 
rules for determination of the political 
future of Vietnam?not what it must be. 
Sincerely.

DEAR SENA'POR: I have just listened to an 
interview with you by the press over Voice of 
America?Philippines United States Armed 
Forces Radio. 
I wanted to write and express my complete 
agreement with you and to urge you to ex-
tend every influence possible to influence the 
American foreign policy in Vietnam along the 
peace-oriented lines drawn out in this inter-

I say this as a registered Democrat and nor-

MY DEAR SENATOR MORSE: It WEIS my good

speech. I wish that every adult American 
could have heard it. 
This is being dictated immediately after 
I heard your speech. It will not get typed 
for several days, owing to circumstances that 
I am unable to change, but the sentiments 
will not change in the meantime. 
With very best wishes, I am

Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
U.S. Senate,

DEAR Ma. Maass: Each day people are being 
killed in Vietnam, and when people are killed 
there should be a very compelling justifica-
tion for it. I can see none in this case. It 
Is obvious where the sympathies of the Viet-
namese people lie. They are not interested 
in dying for an oligarchy possibly created 
and certianly maintained by an alien power. 
The right of a people to self-determination 
is meaningless if we feel free to abrogate 
it 'Whenever they disagree with our idea of 
what is best for them. 
The United States places a high value on 
liberty and life at home. It is ironic that 
we should be so callous abroad. We should 
admit our mistakes instead of compounding 
them, and attempt to negotiate toward a 
neutral Vietnamese Government that enjoys 
the support and reflects the will of its peo-
ple. A powerful nation saving face is not 
worth the life of a single human being. The 
spectacle would be ridiculous if it were not 
also cruel. 
If, as I suspect, the President is indeed 
postponing a decision on this until after the 
election?thus allowing the slaughter to con-
tinue at its present pace?I would find it 
diflicult to vote for one so calculatingly cold-
blooded.

DEAR ASENATOR MORSE: I am sending this 
letter to you to offer my sincere thanks for 
your courageous and forthright television 
presentation of the Vietnam issue yesterday 
afternoon. Our war in Vietnam is an ex-
ample of how "tragically blind and inept 
American statesmanship which in recent 
years has brought us to this pass, has been. 
The French were bold enough to pull out of 
this deadly quagmire, only for us with more 
remote interests to step in. 
You have done a public service to spot-
light our disregard of SEATO commitments 
and our bypassing of U.N. in this dread 
emergency. Your appeal for honesty and 
legality in dealing with this problem, and 
your castigation of hypocritical and mislead-
ing doubletalk with reference thereto, offer 
us the best that has yet happened. 
Again I thank you for your leadership in 
coming to grips with this situation.

DEAR Sim: It is gratifying to learn of your 
recent pronouncements regarding the 'U.S. 
involvement in southeast Asia. All of the 
controversy on this issue that is allowed to 
. appear in the press centers over whether we 
should step up the war or simply continue it 
at its present pace, and it is indeed rare to 
hear expressed the view that we have no 
business there altogether?a view which, we 
believe, has considerable support among a 
large segment of the American people, but 
which up till recently has lacked a spokes-
man. 
There are all too few public figures today 
willing to speak out on unpopular issues, 
and we are always thrilled to see you often 
fighting off the entire Senate?your one-man 
filibuster against the communications satel-
lite bill, on which your colleagues were for 
once quite ready to vote for cloture, is a 
worthy argument in favor of unlimited de-
bate, despite the fact that the procedure is 
generally used for far less worthy causes. 
Keep up the good work. Only with envy

ure to hear and see you on television on 
Sunday, June 29, at 1:30 to 2 on ABC news

I agree with you in your belief that two 
wrongs do not make a right and that war 
solves no problems but creates them, also 
that the United States ought to pursue a 
policy of peace and not a brink of war 
policy. As a professor of philosophy I found 
your arguments to be both consistent and 
cogent.

basis of conduct in the Far East is something 
that the uninformed and ill-informed alike 
may understand. How can President Johnson 
be made to see the light and the danger of his 
policy? With the recent revelations of the 
CIA and Pentagon more enlightenment may 
come. How far are these men going because 
of their idea prosperity depends upon the 
vast heavy industry deals? To have such 
courage as yours expressed comes only by 
one in a decades but with your spiritual de-
velopment, you know that you will be the

Johnson's speech about being willing to go

EXPERTS ARE WORRIED: WESTERN EUROPE 
SUFFER/NG ACUTE ATTACK OF PROSPERITY 
- (By Carl Hartman) 
BONN, GERMANY.?Western Europe is suf-
fering from an acute attack of prosperity. 
People are earning a lot more money than 
they used to, and they're not having to work 
so hard to get it. So they're spending it 
with an abandon that has the experts wor-
ried. 
Unemployment has just about disappeared 
except in Italy. Even in Italy there are many 
places where labor is short, in part because 
high pay in other countries has drained away 
skilled hands. 
MILLION GO TO GERMANY 
Almost a million foreign workers have come 
to West Germany, and many thousands to 
Switzerland and France. They come not 
only from Italy and Spain, but from Turkey 
and Greece and even a few from Yugoslavia. 
In Wolfsburg, home of the Volkswagen, 
5,000 young Italian workmen are living three 
to a room in rows of neat wooden barracks. 
A good deal of the money they get is sent 
home?and helps bid up the prices of Italian 
goods.

15686 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
In West Germany and Prance. thousands 
of good sobs go begging for want of appli-
cants. 
Xlie experts call this overemployrnent and 
say it results in excess demand. The ordi-
nary European finds such terms hard to un-
derstand. Vo him things look pretty good: 
Wages high, jobs easy to get, plenty of goods 
in the shops. 
The businessman never has had so many 
customers, with so much money in their 
pockets. 
EAEMERE DO LESS WELL 
Farmers are doing less well than the rest 
of the population despite hefty Government 
subsidies. Wages are so good and farm 
prospects so relatively bleak that large num-
bers of farmers have found industrial Jobe. 
But they, are not moving to town fast 
enough to satisfy the need of factories for 
labor. That's one reason industrial wages 
keep going up. 
High wages mean high prices?especially 
in Italy where the law says price increases 
must bring wage increases as well. The re-
suit is that the Italian economy is getting 
as hot and breathless as a puppy chasing its 
tail on a summer afternoon in Capri. 
It's Italy, the experts say, where inflation 
Is at its worst, although there has also been 
a wage explosion recently in Holland. 
Sand To UNDERSTAND 
From the human viewpoint it's easy to 
understand. Italy has long been a poor 
country, with the average workman earning 
only half as much as his counterpart in 
France or Britain, and only a fifth what the 
average American makes. Unemployment 
Is traditionally high and families are large. 
Between 1958 and 1063, national income in 
the European Common Market countries 
rose by half, and in Italy it increased by 
nearly two-thirds. A lot of the money went 
into food, but more and more into TV sets 
and refrigerators. 
In 1980, only 1 Italian in 25 had a car. 
In 1960 it was I in 13. 
The result, say economists, is that not 
enough is being saved for investment in new 
plant to increase production in years to 
came. This they find highly dangerous. 
=ALT IttrNS TRADE sEricrr 
They are worried that the Italians are buy-
ing so ranch goods_ abroad that they are not 
able to export enough to pay for them. Re-
cently the United States had to come to the 
rescue and advanced a billion dollars to help 
the Italians out of this particular hole. 
France and, to a leseerextent, Holland and 
Belgium have also been hit by this kind of 
inflation. Up to now, West Germany has 
been able to avoid it. Wages here have gone 
up but production has kept in step and 
prices have held steady. 
They have held so steady, in fact, that 
West German firms are filling their books 
with Pleach, and Italian orders. Such trad-
ing is ravored by the gradual disappearance 
of the tariff wall between Common Market 
canaries, The big and growing demand for 
German goods tends to raise prices at home. 
Inflation can be catching. 
CSIERTIN RAISES BOTTOM 
? West German labor unions are coming up 
this fall with some wage demands to meet 
the price rises. if they get them, stable 
prices will be seriously threatend in West 
Germany, too. 
? The experts say they have a remedy, hard 
and unspectacular but effective. It's called 
holding the line, and the West Germans have 
shown its effectiveness up to now on a na-
tional scale. The calculation is that every 
year roughly 5 percent more goods are pro-
duced, so a 5-percent increase in wages and 
Government spending is also permissible. 
But no more. 
In principle there is agreenient on this by 
the governments of the Common Market 
countries: Prance, Italy, West Germany. Hol-
land. Belgium, and Luxembourg. It's often 
a long way between principle and practice. 
Practice in this case might mean strikes and 
unemployment. it would certainly mean the 
postponement of badly wanted schools. 
houses, and roads. 
The agreement was made in April. The 
governments are due to report in July how 
well they are keeping their promise.

we fear another belated public admission

clear that the administration means this 
further final warning to impress outsiders 
with the threat of interdiction by American 
bombers. It may still be bluff?directed, per-
haps, as much to Messrs. Goldwater and 
Nixon as to Mao Tse-tung and Ho Chi Minh. 
Even so, the domestic device of trying to out-
bid GOLDWATER'S lunacy is self-defeating. 
The truth is that American policy in Laos 
and South Vietnam' is now in a disastrous 
situation. In Laos Communist control ex-
tends over four-fifths of the country; in 
South Vietnam the military situation is on 
paper a shade less disastrous, but all the 
evidence suggests that, outside one or two 
anti-Communist fortresses, most of the suf-
fering population would prefer to settle for 
the hardships of a regimented peace under 
the Vietcong than prolong the misery of 
_ war and corruption under General Klianh. 
If this is true, what would be the end of 
aggressive American air intervention? The 
bombing of Hanoi and the Vietcong supply 
lines would greatly increase the prospect of 
a direct United States-China confrontation?
and it would be imprudent to suppose that 
the Russians could remain indifferent to 
that. It would also harden non-Communist 
opinion in the whole of Asia against the 
United States. Moreover it would almost 
certainly be ineffectual. The Pathet Lao 
and the Vietcong are guerrilla fighters and 
they will go on fighting, -hampered but not 
suppressed by interrupted supply lines, until 
either the Chinese call them off or the popu-
lations of Laos and South Vietnam find an 
alternative which inspires their resistance. 
The intervention of American bombers in 
this situation could do nothing to change it 
fundamentally, and any effect it had would 
be at a heavy?even unacceptable?political 
price. 
There are in fact only two serious options 
open to President Johnson. He can, if this 
Is what he wishes, claim the Indochinese 
Peninsula as vital to American security and 
send in troops to conquer it. Such an opera-
tion might be successful in the end and at a 
cost. But it would be a lengthy, difficult 
campaign and it would have to finish with a 
long-term American occupation. To almost 
the whole of world opinion outside the 
United States, it would seem both senseless 
and immoral and it would command little or 
no support from any of America's major al-
? lies, including Britain. 
Moreover, when the full cost in men and 
material was understood by the American 
public, the war weariness which led to the 
end even of the Korean war would be aggra-
vated by a sense of shame and exasperation 
at the futility of an operation which failed 
to distir4uish between vital interests?In-
dia, for instance, or Berlin?and mere po-
litical prestige. If the President is not pre-
pared to recommend this, the alternative re-
mains a settlement by negotiation?a settle-
ment which must include the Chinese and 
which must in the long run involve? the 
abandonment of 10 years of disastrous Amer-
ican policy. Unpalatable? Certainly. nut, 
? as President Kennedy bravely told his peo-
ple a year ago, not even they can expect an 
American solution to every world problem?
and the alternative (as the French found to 
their cost) would be worse. 
The Johnson administration now faces a 
test of statemanship. Clearly negotiation 
with the Chinese and the North Vietnamese 
Is impracticable before the election. But, 
short of an all-out war, it must come soon. 
The President's best course now would be to 
follow the advice which Secreta,0 McNamara 
Is believed to be offering?to concentrate on 
defending what is left of Saigon-controlled 
Vietnam and the line of the Mekong River, 
meeting Communist attacks with no more 
than equivalent force. That situation would 
be militarily and politically uncomfortable, 
but, in the short term, not impossible. It is 
the only course which leaves the door open 
for serious negotiation later, to end what 
Walter Lippmann has bluntly called a cruel 
and nasty war that has no visible end. The 
alternatives are escalation or humiliation.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Until I heard you on 
"Issues and Answers" yesterday I was in 
complete despair and I cried out to myself, 
Isn't there one voice to be heard? 
Re Taylor as Ambassador to Vietnam: I 
came to Washington in May to lobby with 
W.I.L. on Vietnam. We got to important peo-
ple in State Department. I'll come again if

[From the Washington Post] 
NEUTRAL INDOCHINA STILL A BUEFER?ASIA 
SCHOLAR ARGUES THAT PEIPING ONLY WANTS 
A QUIET BORDER 
(NOTE.?TWO weeks ago in this section, 
Prof. Wesley R. Fishel, of Michigan State 
University, wrote that the United States 
could neither withdraw from former Indo-
china nor allow it to be neutralized. Our 
only choice, he argued, was to "stay and 
fight." Here is a differing opinion on what 
our policy should be, written by an associate 
professor of sociology and a staff member of 
the Institute of War and Peace Studies at 
Columbia University. Arnital Etzioni is also 
the author of "Winning Without War," re-
cently published by Doubleday.) 
(By Amitai Etzioni) 
In the last few weeks, the United States 
has again escalated the war in southeast 
Asia by strafing pro-Communist positions in 
Laos with rockets which hit, among other 
targets, a Chinese mission. 
Like previous escalations, this one did not 
bring us an inch closer to winning the war; 
guerrilla wars are never won from the air. 
Like previous escalations, it involved us more 
deeply in a war that continually costs more 
lives and resources. This involvement, in 
effect, has given Communist China the option 
to decide if and when to turn this war into 
a Korean-type confrontation. 
If tomorrow, China were to match our 
thousands of "advisers," our mass supply of 
modern weapons and our aerial bombard-
ments, we would either have to retreat open-
ly under fire (which is quite inconceivable), 
engage in a large-scale conventional war 
(which the Democrats swore never to get en-
tangled in again after Korea) or use nuclear 
weapons, which would at least push China 
back into the arms of the Soviet Union and 
probably instigate a world war. 
A DULLES LEGACY 
The alternative is not preventive surrender 
but genuine neutralization. In examining 
neutralization, we have not yet freed our-
selves from the Dulles tradition that sees in 
neutrality the immoral position of noncom-
mitment in the struggle between the forces 
of light and darkness as well as an invitation 
to the Communists to try to fill the resulting 
vacuum. That neutarlization is supported 
by De Gaulle (and the U.S.S.R.) is viewed 
,by many in the Capital as sufficient evidence 
in itself that this idea does not warrant care-
ful consideration. 
The critical question is not whether the 
area can be neutralized but whether neutral-
ization can be made to stick and not be a 
thin cover for an American retreat and a 
Communist takeover. In principle, neutral-
ization can be made to work only if it is in 
the interest of all the big powers concerned. 
It is my central contention that this is the 
case in southeast Asia now. 
The key to our mistrust of a neutralist 
solutiOn for southeast Asia is our expecta-
tion that it will result in Chinese domination 
of the region. China is depicted by our 
propaganda as a major aggressive, expan-
sionist power ready to engulf first the Indo-
chinese peninsula, then Malaysia and In-
donesia, and soon all of Asia. 
PEIPING OVERRATED 
A busy team of learned State Department 
staff members and consultants provides an 
endless flood of quotations from Chinese 
writings and speeches to this effect. But we 
should learn to distinguish between pro-
nouncements and policy. 
In reality, China is neither a major nor an 
aggressive power, and neutralization of the 
area would be in line with its present foreign 
policy. China's bellicose threats seek to cover 
up a quite cautious foreign policy in order 
to gain favor in the international Communist 
movement without incurring the risk of a 
major war. 
China has talked about liberating Taiwan 
for half a generation but has done nothing 
about it. China has criticized Khrushchev 
for retreating from Cuba but itself did not 
try to move into next door Hong Kong, full 
of pro-Chinese Communists. It -has not 
launched an attack on Quemoy and Matsu, 
3 miles from its mainland shore. 
Far from being the aggressive nation we 
tend to describe, it has improved its rela-
tions with Japan, Pakistan, and Ceylon, in-
creased its trade with Britain and Canada 
and won the recognition of more than 50 
countries. 
In general, Communist China's pOlicy at 
this stage seems to be to support weak neu-
tral governments on its borders. Cambodia 
has been such a weak neutral country for a 
decade and a half; Burma readily qualifies 
for the same characterization; Nepal is not 
exactly a formidable opponent or a Western 
ally. Yet these countries are as free as 
Pakistan or Thailand. 
Even when India's defenses collapsed, 
China did not take the risks involved in 
marching deeper into the country but lim-
ited itself to holding a border zone that has 
been in dispute for years, and over which 
even Nationalist China recognizes mainland 
China's claim. Once India was shown to be 
weak, it was left alone. 
None of these neutral countries has been. 
annexed because China itself is weak. Her 
agriculture is in a mess; her industrializa-
tion is floundering; a succession of admin-
istrative crises and food shortages have left 
the country with a low morale; the Chinese 
Army is poorly equipped; China has found it 
difficult to obtain gasoline to fly its airplanes 
since the Soviet Union cut off the supply; it 
has no nuclear weapons or modern systems 
of delivery. 
For at least the next decade, China will 
have to focus on building up its industrial 
base. Whether that goal can be reached in 
less than 20 years and whether China will be 
as Stalinist and bellicose after that period 
as it is now are open questions. For the 
next 10 years, however, China is to be ex-
pected to prefer weak neutral countries on 
Its borders over the risks of a fuller con-
frontation with the United States as a result 
of a violation of a neutrality pact. 
To be successful, neutralization must be 
backed by power. We must make clear from 
the onset that neutralization will win our 
support only if China and Russia will com-
mit themselves to refrain from armed inter-
vention in the neutralized area, and that any 
violation of these commitments will bring 
our return with a vengeance, with whatever 
force required. 
We are now committed to protect the peo-
ple of the area from external aggression and 
to assure their right of self-determination; 
we can fulfill this commitment Under neu-
tralization by setting up remote deterrence 
forces; i.e., by holding forces in a state of

readiness outside a given territory to deter 
the Intrusion Of the staler side and If neces-
sary to counter it. 
The zone to be?neutraitted has yet to be 
determined. /deay, all of southeast Asia 
should be included. North Vietnam was a 
C'hinese rased for hundreds of years, and its 
leaders still fear and resent Chinese over-
lordship. Given an opportunity, Ho Chi 
Minh might well prefer to act like Yugo-
slavia, at least like Rumania. 
But it might be too late for the inclusion 
of North Vietnam; the younger generation 
of pro-Chinese leaders might be too deeply 
entrenched for this plan. Nor is China likely 
to let go of North Vietnam. 
It would be more realistic to neutralize 
an area Where China would be unwilling to 
Wept the Asks involved in continued or re-
newed conttiet with the United States: South 
Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos south and west 
of the 1962 neutrailzkion line (which the 
pro-Communist forces have not yet crossed). 
Such a zone would obviously meet with the 
approval of France and have the active sup-
port of Russia; the U.S.S.R. seeks to contain 
Chinese Whip= In Asia:. 
neutral zone established in line with the 
interests of all concerned might still be 
eroded and a major war triggered if either 
side, while peeking to adhere to its com-
Mittnent, felt that the other side had violated 
the pact. That is what happened with the 
1054 and 1061-62 neutralization accords. 
Not only were they not backed by power. 
but an utterly ineffectual international ma-
chinery ?was set up to supervise their im-
plementation. A fair-sized United Nations 
observer force patioling the borders of the 
area would go a long way toward doing that 
job. 
By Trifacing violations more visible to world 
public opinion, they would become leas 
tempting. (No US. force could deter a 
major power intending openly to violate the 
neutrality pact; that would be the task of 
the "remote deterrezine" forces.) Such a 
U.N. force would be Much more likely to 
gain Soviet financial support than the peace-
keeping activities in the Congo or Gaza 
Strip. 
After a short period of pacification, free 
elections should be held in the neutralized 
territories under U.N. supervision. There 
seems to be no reason why Cambodia would 
not retain its =41 government nor why 
Death Laos, shorn of he Communiats in the 
north, would not continue to be governed 
by the present Vientiane coalition of right-
lets and neutralists. 
The fate of the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment is lees easy to predict. The present 
Government has practically no popular basis 
and suffers the onus Of being the puppet of 
a !reign power. At worst, free elections 
would lead to a nationalist pro-Communist 
government. 
As long as South Vietnam was prevented 
by the neutrality pact from joining any mili-
tary bloc or being annexed by North Viet-
nam, however, It would still be a buffer state 
in the way of future Chinese expansion. And 
there is the possibility that with the return 
of a saner life in Soalth.Vietntun, viable polit-
ical alternatives to the National Liberation 
Front would emerge. 
This Is not a sanguine picture. Surely we 
would prefer to leave South Vietnam with 
a democratic government committed to eco-
nomic development and social progress. 
BM there Is no way of establishing such a 
government; surely our massive economic 
aid to a government by generals and our es-
calation of:the war have not brought such a 
government closer. 
The alternative in., southeast Asia is not 
between figuriehing democracy and commu-
nism but between trying neutralization and 
escalating a war in which no military vic-
tory seems possible; which devastates the 
countryside, makes American support of re-
pugnant regimes seem necessary and leaves 
China with the option to Involve us in an-
other Korean-type war.

DEAR am: It is so heartening to hear a 
sane voice in Government circles as regards 
our treacherous, suicidal and unmoral posi-
tion in southeast Asia?but also how sad 
and frustrating that you have so few allies 
for your patriotic, just position. 
We are beginning to wonder why our Gov-

so many thousands of miles from home when 
they can't seem to manage to protect a few 
hundred civil rights workers who are down 
in Mississippi to uphold the Constitution of

Mr. Mouse, your voice must be heard out-

you on the television program "Issues and

your sane and courageous position on Laos 
and Vietnam. As a young person who would 
like to live long enough to marry and have 
children (I am presently a student at Har-
vard College) , I have been most concerned 
by the provocative foreign policy presently 
advocated by both political parties in this 
area. I feel as you do that it is extremely 
unifortunate that nowadays politicians must 
prove their opposition to communism by 
exhibiting a willingness to engage in an all-
out war which would be disastrous for all 
humanity, and I agree that the matter at 
southeast Asia would best be hancned by the 
United Nations. 
July 9 
I wonder if you are in accord with Senator 
Funeenairr's suggestion that our Cuba policy 
also be reassessed. It has always seemed 
Ironic to me that our Government tolerate 
the many rightwing dictatorships in Latin 
America and the rest of the world, and yet be 
so maniacally militant in its policy toward 
Castro. Granted, the man is a dictator; but 
isn't he preferable to men like Batista or 
Somoza or Duvalier or that stanch ally of 
ours, Franco? Perhaps here again our wisest 
course of action might be to further freedom 
through economic aid, unilateral reconcilia-
tion, and arbitration through the U.N. 
Thanking you again (I wish you, and not 
my cousin Levraurr, were the senior Senator 
from Massachusetts), and looking forward to

DEAR SENATOR KENNEDY: Concerning the 
involvement in Vietnam, I hope you will 
support the position taken by Senators 
AIXEN, MORSE, PELL, GRUENING, and BART-
Larr on the matter. 
We seem to be in Vietnam for emotional 
reasons, not for the defense of the United 
States. Defense of the country seems to me 
to be the only constitutional reason for or-
dering our forces into action, unless the ac-
tion is called for by our United Nations 
treaties. In the Vietnam matter there has 
been no U.N. action, and there has been no 
declaration of war by our Congress. This is 
another Korea-like trap. 
Indeed our security is endangered by our 
presence in Vietnam. There Is no visible 
military advantage there which we do not 
have anyway from our naval position. 
What we seem to be getting is a progres-
sive military socialization of the American 
economy In the guise of battling communism 
in the far reaches of the world. Does this 
make sense? 
Let's settle the Vietnam adventure before 
war and ruin overtakes us.

about the Johnson administration's having

This similarity of view must have been

Senator MORSE' is also quite right in ad-

LAGUNA BEACH, CALIF.,

Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
SIR: I agree with you heartily in your 
summation as to the involvement abroad 
into which our country's foreign policy is 
leading us, vis-a-vis southeast Asia. The 
foolhardiness of our unilateral intervention 
there could but bring about a contest of 
Wills between China and ourselves, a test 
which jeopardizes the whole world. It 
shapes up almost as though we are engaged 
in "'Red-baiting," hoping to lure Red China 
to move as it did finally in Korea (we dis-
believed clearly stated warnings then), to 
the end that Nationalist forces on Formosa 
may be unleashed to assault the mainland, 
and all that hardware the military have had 
around unused for so long, may be thrown 
at the Chinese?which as you have said, will 
only beget us the hatred of the Asiatic 
peoples, if not the world. Would we allow 
Chinese intervention. in Mexico or Central 
America? 
It was bad enough noting in a recent copy 
of Life magazine, torture shots of Vietcong 
by their captors, the Vietnamese, wherein we 
Americans are indirectly implicated. Though 
the Vietnamese officer administering the 
"treatment" is quoted as only "doing his 
duty," I believe that was the defense re-
peated by German war criminals and for 
which the German people as a whole were 
indicted. The hate reflected in the captive's 
eyes perhaps is indicative of what we can 
expect when they have license to do the 
same (not that they are not using methods 
of terror, but that's their guilt, not ours). 
Could it be possible that there are 
"vested interests" there in South Viet-
nam of which we have no knowledge, for 
which our otherwise uncalled for unilateral 
action was devised to protect? Could it be 
possible that the loss of King Ranch prop-
erties in Cuba is what has whipped uP such 
agitation in relation to that island under-
going social change?while almost complete 
disregard exists in another dictatorship 
every bit as ruthless in Haiti where the 
Murchison brothers apparently have consid-
erable property? 
Again and again, the issue of property 
seems to be what we are called upon to 
defend as against human rights, i.e., the 
4esperate search of peoples throughout the 
world to change the existing status quo, 
and in great many cases to the end that

Our pretentious to the "defense of free-

The British seem to have learned their

Re request for additional list of liberals. 
Senator WAYNE MORSE, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Last Sunday, June 
'28, I heard your discussion over the radio on 
"Issues and Answers," and I appreciate so 
deeply your courageous stand against the 
U.S. Involvement in Vietnam, where as you 
have often said, "We have no business to be." 
It takes real courage and lots of it to 
. speak out against a Government policy or 
procedure that has been made popular by 
such powerful groups as the political orga-
nization that is backing GatDwarza includ-
ing the John Birchers, American Legion. the 
Pentagon, and others. 
All of we liberals throughout our Nation 
should stand squarely behind you, Senator 
Moasz, and let you know that we are with you 
and the others, Senators Cutracti- ?BuzauNo, 
DI.IN JOHNSTON, JAMES EaU3TLAND, and Mika 
MANSFIELD. The action our Government has 
embarked on is a form of imperialism that in 
some Ways is almost as bad politically, eco-
nornicany, and humanitarianly as was pro-
cedure used by England, France, Spain, Por-
tugal, the Dutch, and others during the pe-
riod that they were building their empires. 
It is our duty as liberals to band together 
and try in every way possible to stop this 
aggressive action before the United States 
gets so deeply involved that It can't atop 
short of bringing on another major war. 
Senator Moue, there surely must be other 
liberal Senators and Representatives that be-
lieve as you do and if they receive the right 
kind of encouragement might join in with 
you, and won't you please appoint someone 
*in your office to make a list of all who believe 
as you do whose names I do not have, so that 
I may also write them, and If any are up for 
reelection I will try to send a contribution 
to help on their campaign expenses. 
Most sincerely yours,

DEAR ent: It would be enlightening to 
know what factual basis the Times has for 
stating that Senator Moasz's "dangerous dis-
tortions go far beyond competent criticism" 
when he opposes administration policies in 
South Vietnam (July 1). 
There seems to be considerable evidence 
to justify Senator Moasz's description of 
Major General Ehanh, head of the Govern-
ment, as a "tinhorn tyrant." 
General Khanh recently arrested nine top 
political opponents who asked for the release 
of two prisoners. He banned a newspaper, 
"Tien" (Progress) because it spoke of the 
general's regime as the so-called democratic 
got/eminent. Another newspaper was banned 
for criticizing the failure of the Government 
adequately to protect the America/a aircraft 
ferry that had been bombed by the Vietcong. 
The general has already closed down more 
than 20 journals. 
I salute Senator Mosses integrity and 
courage In joining the unpopular minority 
Who are trying' to let the American people 
know how dangerous and self-defeating our 
policies are in southeast Asia. 
Sincerely yours,

spotted and dispersed, and I hope there will 
be a growing sentiment to back your warn-

Re the shocking and brutal war in Vietnam. 
Eorrost, 
Life Magazine, 
New York, N.Y. 
SIR: The shocking photographs shown in 
the June 12. 1964, issue of Life, are "ipso 
facto" proof of guilt as well as positive 
Identification of the guilty. 
These shocking offenses against the body of 
prostrate and shackled prisoners are against 
all canon laws pertaining to treatment of 
human beings. 
Crimes against humanity must not go un-
punished. The guilty should be ttela for in-
ternational war crimes trials, regardless of 
national origin, color, or race. 
To date of beginning of World War II, 
beating a prisoner with a cane, "the tortur-
ing went on intermittently for nearly 3 
hours." "A captive turns to avoid choking 
on water poured into his nose," by these 
minions of the devil, would have called for a 
court-martial and a prison sentence or, 
possible summary execution of the guilty. 
Senator WAYNE Mouse (Oregon) has stated, 
"that the American program in Vietnam, 
violates one international commitment 
after another. Why are American soldiers 
there? 
Let the preacher from the pulpit preach 
and let all the Christian people in Christen-
dom rise up as one nation and put a stop to 
this shocking and brutal war. 
As a veteran of World War I, I recall with 
sorrow the mockery of the slogan on 1017-18. 
"To make the world safe for democracy" and 
"this is the war that is to end all wars." 
Yours for world peace and not for World 
War III.

DEAR SIR: I am writing to offer whatever 
encouragement I can in your effort to deflect 
the insane warmongers of U.S. policy in 
southeast Asia. From the material made 
available by most of our daily newspapers 
(even here in New York) it is extremely dif-
ficult to form a rational estimate of current 
happenings; the few accurate reports on 
your speeches in such journals as the Na-

note of sanity in our present circumstances. 
If our country ever gets out of its present 
position of being the leader of all the most 
reactionary forces in the world, much of the 
thanks will be owed to you. Please accept 
the gratitude of one citizen. I hope that we 
are not too alone in this struggle.

DEAR M. Wurrea: Your May 4 issue which 
I just read (forwarded from Honolulu) says 
"we have been deceived"?about Vietnam, 
etc. 
have a theory of deception even worse 
than yours, viz: No military strategist in his 
right mind would undertake to maintain a 
landing by conventional tactics on a coast 
8,000 miles away from his base, with 700 
million potential enemies in the hinterland 
and the coastal inhabitants indifferent or 
even hostile. 
Therefore, since Pentagon strategists have 
done this, and have gradually increased our 
forces in Vietnam from a few advisers to 
now 18,000, and are now pressing for more; 
and since I don't believe they are entirely 
crazy, / deduce that they have had in mind 
from the beginning the possibility of using 
nuclear weapons either on Hanoi or Peiping 
or both whenever the necessity arose. They 
would figure this might be a good chance 
for some practice. By the use of nuclear 
weapons they might maintain an otherwise 
untenable position. 
Furthermore, I suspect that the buildup 
for peace which has been going on ever since 
last Christmas, has been to prepare the 
American public for the bad news that we 
now must undertake another oriental war, 
this time even worse than Korea. 
The administration can now point to its 
peaceful record?"you see, we have used every 
means to cultivate world peace and diminish 
friction?now regretfully we are forced into 
war."

"DEAR EDITOR: Senator wssun saoasz, of 
Oregon, deserves the praise and support of 
the American people for his courageous con-
demnation of "McNamara's War" in south-
east Asia. It is tragic that only a handful 
of our Congressmen realize what complica-
tions would grow out of expanding that war. 
Not only would there be the certainty of 
Chinese participation but the very nature 
of the terrain would impel us to use tactics 
that would arouse the condemnation of most 
Afro-Asians and perhaps the world. 
"It would not be expedient for us to meet 
the enemy man to man in the jungle; we 
would make extended use of air power, 
napalm, poison sprays and atomic weapons. 
These indiscriminately directed as they are 
: not only against people but to the destruc-
tion of vegetation and the soil itself, would 
incite the flaming hatred of most Asian peo-
- pies. They feel what We seem sometimes to 
forget?that life itself is sustained by the 
"Good Earth." They know that, to date, 
such weapons have been used only against 
Asiatics. We, without our great wealth and 
atomic might would be regarded as the great 
. bully endeavoring by superior size and 
weight to subdue the brave but poorly 
equipped underdog. 
"Moreover, what could we do with those 
parts of east Asia we might subdue? We 
have not ,been able to produce commendable 
results in South Korea where, in 12 years, 
though our country has expended billions 
of dollars, the government is honeycombed 
with corruption, millions are unemployed 
and hungry, and tens of thousands of stu-
dents are demonstrating in opposition the 
trend to put Japan back into control of 
South Korean business and affairs. True, it 
would ease Or load if Japan could manage 
South Korea; but to Asiatic peoples it looks 
like we are for turning the clocks back. 
Could we do any better in Southeast Asia?

us oUt,of there.

DEAR SENATOR MORSE: In the National 
Guardian I have read your statement regard-
ing the South Asian war. I admire you for 
trying to raise the issue involved for the 
opposition to this war. This war as I see it 
is a Pentagon war used solely for the purpose 
of testing weapons and war gadgets. That is 
all, except for a church grail). 
A recent letter from a soldier in this area 
wrote a letter and published in the Philadel-
phia Bulletin?in long, long?that testing of 
war gadgets is essential true?the main pur-
pose. This next door neighbor to a fellow 
who defends the other side is on the spot of 
getting his scholarship revoked by the flag 
wavers. 
The GeFEDR/1 military in 1914 was the 
strongest and best. Look where it led Ger-
many. During the World War II the German 
military was the strongest in the world. 
Look at the result. Now the U.S. military 
is the strongest. If this military sustains its 
Asian policy it too can bring this country to 
a brink of disaster. 
You deserve much credit for speaking out 
as you do against a fatal policy than can 
only lead to discredit. 
Cordially,

OREGON DEMOCRATIC CONVEN-
TION UNANIMOUSLY REJECTS 
SECRETARY 'UDALL'S PROPOSED 
ELECTRIC POWER INTERTIE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH PRIVATE 
UTILITIES 
The Honorable WAYNE MORSE, 
The U.S. Senate, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR MORSE: It was with deep 
gratification that my wife and I read of your 
sane approach toward a solution to the un-
declared war we are waging in South Viet-
nam. 
It was particularly refreshing when so 
many elected officials are actually leading 
mass hysteria for war with any government 
with whom the United States differs politi-
cally. 
Your lone voice must take the same kind 
of personal integrity and courage as must 
have faced Abraham Lincoln when as a 
U.S. Senator, he alone opposed the then 
"popular" war against our neighbor, Mexico. 
I urge you to continue your fine effort 
toward awakening America toward the dart-
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, while 
the Democratic convention in Oregon 
last week almost unanimously, with only 
one dissenting vote in support of the 
administration policy, called for a sub-
mission of the jurisdiction of the war 
in South Vietnam to the United Nations, 
they unanimously rejected Secretary 
Udall's present proposal for an intertie 
arrangement in connection with the so-
called electric power intertie arrange-
ment with private utilities on the Pacific 
coast. 
Let me make very clear, Mr. Presi-
dent, that the Oregon Democratic con-
vention does not object to the sale of 
power into California, and other West-
ern States from the Bormeville system; 
nor does it, of course, object to the sale 
of Canadian power, after the Canadian 
treaty is implemented. Other States 
are entitled to their share of the power, 
too. 
The senior Senator from Oregon has 
never taken the position that the Pacific 
Northwest has a monopoly on, or mo-
nopoly ownership of the power that is 
developed from dams that have been 
built with the money of all the taxpay-
ers of the country. 
But we do have a Federal power policy. 
That Federal power policy is a sound 
policy. Our Federal power policy gives 
certain rights, benefits, and protections 
to so-called public power preference 
users. 
The Democratic Party convention last 
Saturday wanted to know the specific 
details of the protection that Secretary 
Udall proposes as a guarantee in carry-
ing out the long existing Federal power 
policy. They wanted to be certain of 
protections such as those enacted into 
law, for example, when the Bonneville 
Act was adopted in the first place. 
I am in accord with the critics at that 
convention who hold that the agreement 
as tentatively proposed by the Secretary 
of the Interior does not contain those 
guarantees and protections. That is 
why the Oregon convention went on rec-
ord rejecting the agreement in its pres-
ent form as submitted by the Depart-
ment of the Interior to the appropriate 
committees of the Congress. 
Last Thursday I spoke on this subject 
on the floor of the Senate after testify-
ing before the Senate committee. I 
stand on every word that I said last 
Thursday. I made my plea then that the 
proposed intertie agreement be made 
more specific.

15692 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE July 9 
The convention also went on record 
as opposing any agreement on the west 
coast intertie arrangement unless there 
Is written into the agreement the con-
struction of a Federal line from Hoover 
Dam into Nevada. Arizona, and the 
other areas to be served by that line. 
As the convention pointed out, and as 
some of us in our testimony last week 
also pointed out, that line is assential 
if we are to have a public power yard-
stick cheet against the private utilities. 
Such a check is needed if we are to pro-
tect the consumers who will buy the 
power. 
We will find an insistence limn the 
maintenance of such, a check from the 
Industrial power consumers. There is 
no group more Insistent that such a 
yardstick check be maintained than in-
dustry itself, because industry knows 
what happens to its power rates if a 
private utility is given control of dams 
built by the taxpayers' money. If we 
gife them control of the transmission 
lines, we might as well give the power 
at bus bar. 
I stress again that I am highly de-
sirous of working out a satisfactory 
arrangement or agreement that will pro-
tect the legitimate--and I underline the 
Word "legitimate"?Interests of the Pub-
lic utilities, the legitimate interests of 
the public power group, the legitimate 
interests of the public power preference 
users, and, most of all, the legitimate 
interests of the taxpayer. 
I am satisfied that the interest of the 
taxpayer will not be protected under the 
Udall agreement as offered in its present 
form. That is why the two Senators 
from Oregon have already served notice 
that we shall oppose the intertie agree-
ment in its present form. I am hoping 
that in the weeks and months ahead we 
can work out with the Secretary of the 
Interior and with all parties concerned 
a satisfactory adjustment of the differ-
ences. - 
One provision, for instance, that must 
be deleted is that which would permit 
an escape from the assurance that an 
all-Federal transmission line will be built 
from The Danes to Hoover Dam. I refer 
to the sentence on page 25 of the Secre-
tary's report which indicates that it 
Might in the future be possible to build 
that line through contracts with private 
utilities. 
Under no circumstances, if we look at 
the agreement in its entirety, would any 
such proposal be acceptable or satisfac-
tory to the Senators from Oregon. 
In light of the discussion, the debate, 
and the resolution adopted by the Demo-
cratic Party convention in Oregon last 
July 4, the present administration would 
be well advised to note now that it is 
headed for the type of an all-out fight on 
the power issue in my State, such as past 
administrations, both Democratic and 
Republican, have experienced in the last 
25 years. It will come if there is any 
attempt to underwrite an agreement, 
such as the, one proposed, which would 
not give preference, in effect, to the pub-
lic preference users under existing law, 
but would, rather, in effect give prefer-
ence to the private utilities. 
Now is the time to avoid such a con-
troversy. Now is the time to insist that 
the Secretary of the Interior offer an 
agreement that cannot possibly be used, 
or have language in it that can possibly 
be used, as a device to circumvent or 
evade a great power policy that has 
served the best interests of the people 
of this country for a long time. 
I would have the administration care-
fully reflect before it puts a stamp of 
approval on the present proposal of the 
Secretary of the Interior. I would recall 
to the memory of the Johnson adminis-
tration, for that period of meditation 
and reflection, the names of some of our 
great conservationists and great bipar-
tisan developers of our natural resources. 
I would have the Johnson administra-
tion recall the contribution of Pinchot, 
of Hiram Johnson, of Charles McNary, 
of Norris, of La Follette, of Brookhart, 
of Wheeler, of Clarence Dill, and many 
others. 
Those Republican and Democratic 
conservationists are cataloged by some 
as progressive liberals, and they truly 
were. They were the great progressive 
liberals of a bygone day who wrote into 
the statute books of our country a set 
of laws that give to the consumers of our 
country the protection that they need 
against the hijacking and exploiting 
policies of the private utilities of this 
country. These practices would no doubt 
appear if we should permit the private 
utilities ever to go unchecked. 
Many of us are concerned about the 
proposed Udall agreement on the Inter-
tie because, although we have the same 
objective in mind, we do not believe that 
the machinery or the principles set up 
in the proposed agreement will accom-
plish that fine objective. 
I plead with the administration that 
they not rush this project, but that we 
take our time on it. They are not going 
to persuade me with the argument that 
If we do not get something done very 
quickly, Bonneville rates may have to be 
raised. I do not intend to sell out the 
Interests of the people of my State for 
any mess of pottage. r want a sound pro-
gram. I do not intend to be rushed into 
this. The proposed agreement, in my 
judgment, needs much reconsideration 
and redrafting. 
This is not the first time that I have 
found myself in this position. Not so 
many years ago there were those in MY 
State and throughout the Pacific North-
west who wanted me to swallow another 
partnership program. Under that pro-
gram the Eisenhower administration 
sought to have the taxpayers pay for the 
nonreimbursable costs of a great mul-
tiple-purpose dam and then turn the 
power generation facilities over to the 
power utilities at the damsite. They 
called it a partnership. It was a fine 
partnership. My colleague at the time, 
Dick Neuberger--I paraphrase him, but 
I think the paraphrase is close to the 
original?said on the floor of the Senate 
one afternoon?
What is proposed is that the Federal tax-
payers supply a cow. from which the private 
utilities can take the milk. 
That is just about what the partner-
ship program amounted to. Instead of 
surrendering to it under 11 the 
that was being exercised by Democrats, 
and Republicans alike, those of us who 
said we were not going to agree appeared 
before and appealed to the Appropria-
tions Committees of the Senate and the 
House over a period of several years, ask-
ing for appropriations to proceed to build 
public dams, not partnership dams. We 
succeeded in getting the money. 
One of the greatest thrills I have had 
In my service in the Senate was to give 
the dedication speech not so many weeks 
ago at the great Cougar Dam in my State. 
It is a multipurpose dam, a dam belong-
ing to the taxpayers of the United States. 
But the Eisenhower administration, in 
the beginning of that fight, would not 
recommend a dime in its annual budget 
estimates for Cougar Dam?or, for that 
matter, the Green Peter Dam, which will 
be dedicated within a couple of years. 
The message was given to me time and 
time again that if I would just go along, 
we would get the money, so that the dam 
could be built. Many Democrats in my 
State were persuaded to "put the heat 
on." The mail was voluminous. Many 
of the Democrats who wrote to me asked 
me to surrender to the Eisenhower ad-
ministration's demand for a partnership 
program. 
I told them: 
You say that now, but the time will come 
when you will applaud if we win this fight. 
If we lose this light. you will pay through 
the nose with higher power rates for years 
to come. 
We won both fights. Now we have one 
dam completed and another on its way. 
The same thing was attempted in con-
nection with one of the greatest of all 
our western dams, now under construc-
tion, the John Day Darn on the Colum-
bia. We fought that battle, and we won. 
I want my President to know now that 
we are going to scrutinize with the 
greatest of care the Udall intertie agree-
ment. I want to say to some of my col-
leagues from the Pacific Northwest who 
are on the other side, "You had better 
scrutinize it, too. You had better go 
over the proposal with a fine tooth 
combWe.'w'ould like to sit down with the ad-
ministration to work out a settlement 
that will protect the consumers and pro-
tect this country's power policy. If we 
cannot arrive at such a negotiated set-
tlement of this matter, we are ready to 
light. The people in our part of the 
country are ready to fight. 
Members of the Democratic Party as-
sembled at Coos Bay, Oreg., served clear 
notice on this administration that we are 
ready to fight to protect the legitimate 
power rights of the people of the West. 
When we protect those people, we pro-
tect the power rights of the people of the 
country and the taxpayers as well. 
I thought I should make these com-
ments today because I have been advised 
that an attempt will be made to rush 
this matter through. I sincerely hope 
that, on reflection, the administration 
will decide to consider further before it 
acts
