 INDOCHINA
 The 4-11 June visit of Le Duan and Pham Van Dong to China was
 "a complete success," according to the joint communique.  The
 Chinese may have particular reason to be pleased by the timing
 and results of the visit shortly before Brezhnev's trip to the
 United States.  Notable among the results was the signing of
 a new aid agreement and of a communique citing both sides'
 misgivings about Soviet-U.S. detente.  The Chinese used the
 occasion to raise their commitment to the PRG as the "sole
 authentic representative" of the South Vietnamese people.
 After maintaining almost total silence on the Kissinger-Le Duc
 Tho Paris talks, Hanoi media or. 13 June carried the announcement
 that agreement had been reached on communiques to be signed by
 the United States and the DRV and by the four parties to the
 Vietnamese agreements, respectively.
 Standard Vietnamese communist rhetoric regarding the peace
 agreement and long-range goals were reaffirmed by PRG President
 Huynh Tan Phat in his report to a recent Council of Ministers
 meeting.  The Liberation Radio announcement on the 8th that
 Phat had chaired the Council meeting on 6-7 June in an
 unidentified "liberated area" supplied the first explanation of
 Phat's absence from ceremonies in Quang Tri on the 6 June PRG
 anniversary.  Phat's report to the Council of Ministers called
 the PRG the sole authentic representative of South Vietnam.
 This description is consistent with the stress on the PRG's
 international prestige during the anniversary ceremonies in
 Quang Tri, marked by the attendance of newly named ambassadors
 to the PRG.
 LE DUAN VISIT TO PRC A "COMPLETE SUCCESS," YIELDS NEW AID
 Stealing a march on Brezhnev's visit to the United States later
 in the month, the Chinese hosted Hanoi's Le Duan and Pham Van
 Dong to a week-long summit visit beginning on the 4th that
 produced a new aid agreement and a communique which reflected a
 common attitude vis-a-vis the superpowers.  With the two sides
 taking divergent approaches to the Vietnam question, the
 Chinese made a point of defining their new aid commitments in
 terms that made clear their interest in encouraging a peaceful
 situation.  The DRV leaders returned hume on the 11th after a

 few days in the northwest rounding out what was recorded in
 the Joint communique as an "official friendly visit" crowned
 with "complete success."*
 The visitors were accorded :he standard treatment for high-level
 friends, including a meeting with Mae on thy, second day for
 what NCNA called "an extremely cordial and friendly conversation."
 In addition to the usual ')anquets, tfere was a rally on the 7th
 carried live over radio i~,ad televisicn,  Though Le Duan and Dong
 were given joint billing as leaders of the delegation, the party
 chief delivered all of the principal &peer_hes.  As the main host,
 Chou En-lai spoke at the welcoming and reciprocal banquets in
 Peking, but it was left to top military leader Yeh Chien-ying,
 who addressed the rally, to deliver the most comprehensive state-
 ment of Chinese policy.  All of the active Peking-based Politburo
 members attended the rally, including Chiang Ching and the
 recently rehabili.tatcd Teng Hsiao-ping.
 SINO-VIETNAMESE       According to the communique  released on the
 SOLIDARITY            12th, the two sides held talks on "the
 further strengthening" of their friendly
 relations and cooperation, "the new situation" in Vietnam, and
 other questions of common interest.  A similar formulation in
 the communique on Dong's November 1971 visit, without the
 reference to a. "new" situation, had included a reference to
 "U.S. imperialist aggression."  The two sides lavished the
 expected praise on each other, with the communique saying the
 talks "fully manifested the ever-deepening great friendship and
 militant unity" and affirming that thee:, relations, based on
 Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, "will not be
 destroyed by any force on earth."  The communique calls the new
 aid agreement "a mcs.. vivid expression of the militant unity" of
 the two sides, and Peking pledges its "unshakable determination
 to continue to perform its internationalise u_'tv" in aiding the
 Vietnamese in their struggle to safeguard peace, build socialism
 in the North, achieve independence and democracy in the South,
 and proceed toward peaceful reunification,
 *  A 5 June meeting between the DRV ambassador in Moscow and
 Soviet Deputy Premier V.N. Novikov, who handles aid mattei3,
 raises the possibility that Soviet-DRV talks on aid may be in the
 offing.  Minimal Soviet coverage of the Sino-Vietnamese summit
 included a TASS report on the delegation's return to Hanoi that
 singled Tut Le Duan's expression of gratitude for Soviet aid and
 his call for cohesion within the communist camp in his Peking
 speeches.

 The communique's assessment of the international situation
 reflects Peking's success in finding common ground with their
 allies concerning Moscow's detente policy.  In passages
 clearly reflecting Chinese draftsmanship, the current document
 replaces a section in the November 1971 communique assailing
 "U.S. imperialism" with one calling for resistance by "small
 and medium-sized countries" and members of the Third World
 against the hegemony of unspecified "imperialists."  In
 offsetting an acknowledgment of "some easing" of international
 tensions with a warning that the imperialists are resorting
 to "more cunning and deceptive means" toward their expansionist
 goals, the communique associates the North Vietnamese with
 Peking's characteristic expressions of concern over the effects
 of Soviet-Western detente.  Yeh Chien-ying had forcefully
 pressed this line in his rally speech, but the more blatantly
 anti-Soviet overtones were muted in the joint communique.
 AID ACCORD     Both NCNA and VNA reported that an agreement
 on the PRC's "gratuitous economic and military
 assistance" to Vietnam in 1974 was signed on 8 June.  NCNA's
 repor'- of last year's signing of the annual agreement, on
 26 November, had noted as usual that a specific protocol on
 the supply of "military equipment and materials" had been
 signed in addition to the aid pact, but none was mentioned
 this year.  By signing the annual agreement now the two sides
 were able to produce a concrete result  of the summit as well
 as to take into account the new situation in Vietnam after
 U.S. withdrawal.
 VNA did not specify the purpose of the aid; but NCNA said
 that the purpose of the agreement "is, after the end of the war
 in Vietnam, to heal the wounds of war Lhe.re, rehabilitate and
 develop its national economy and strengthen its national defense
 capability, and to further strengthen the militant friendship
 and unity" between the Chinese and Vietnamese.  Prior to the
 Sino-U.S. rapprochement in April 1971, Peking had said that the
 aid was for the purpose of defeating the United States.  But
 Peking did not indicate the purpose of the annual or supplementary
 aid grants in 1971 and 1972.
 A 12 June NHAN DAN editorial hailing the "brilliant success" of
 the visit linked the aid agreement with the standard set of
 Vietnamese goals in the north and south, including "advancing
 toward peaceful national unification."  A day earlier VNA released
 a message from the departing delegation to the Chinese noting "with

 great satisfactian the resolve" of tha PRC "to continue your
 support and assistance" in the new stage of the struggle
 until "our complete victory."
 1NDO::HINA SITUATION     The two sides used the Joint communique
 to put on record their positions on
 various aspects of an Indochina settlement, a task made
 difficult by the divergent approaches reflected in their
 speeches during the course of the visit.  As in the November
 1971 communique on Dong's visit, each side stated its views on
 the current Vietnam situation, with the Vietnamese charging
 the United States and Saigon with having "incessantly,
 systematically, and grossly" violated the Paris accord while
 the Chinese avoided accusing any party of wrongdoing.  Where
 the November 1971 communique included a lengthy passage
 registering the two sides' "unanimous" views on a Vietnam
 settlement, the current document has them merely demanding that
 Saigon and the United States "thoroughly respect and strictly
 implement" all the provisions of the Paris accord.  In naming
 Saigon first, the communique used the language preferred by
 Peking.  On  he other hand, DRV statements during the visit
 placed the main onus on the United Stares, consistently listing
 it first.
 The Chinese did, however, make one notable move toward their
 Vietnamese allies' position by recognizing the PRG as "the
 only authentic representative" of the South Vietnamese people.
 This represents a concession to the Vietnamese communists that
 the Chinese had persistently avoided in the past and serves
 to enhance Peking's political support for the PRG at a time when
 the latter is seeking to embellish its trappings as a legitimate
 government.*  Peking also expressed support in the communique
 for the PRG's 25 April six-point proposal for a settlement in
 South Vietnam.
 *  It is noteworthy that Peking's comment marking the 6 June
 anniversary of the PRG's founding--including the usual leaders'
 message, PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial, and high-level speech at a
 PRG reception--failed to echo Vietnamese references to the PRG
 as the only authentic representative of South Vietnam.  The
 12 June NI-IAN DAN editorial or. the DRV delegation's visit made
 a point of citing the new Chinese formulation appearing in the
 communique.

 On Laos, the communique hails the Vientiane agreement,
 supports the "correct stand" of the Lao Patriotic Front,
 and expresses "the hope that progress will soon be achieved"
 in the ongoing consultations among the Lao parties.  The
 two sides also hail "the huge victories" won by Sihanouk's
 front and acclaim his visit to Cambodia as "an event of
 great historic significance."  Declaring that "the wanton
 bombing" of Cambodia by the United States cannot preserve
 "the traitorous Lon Nol clique," the communique expresses
 support for Sihanouk's five-point declaration and for the
 "just stand" takr.n by his front on a Cambodian settlement.
 Without elaboration, it calls for the Cambodian question to
 be settled by the Cambodian people themselves "free from
 foreign interference."  During the delegation's visit Sihanouk's
 prime minister, Penn Nouth, had been prominently reported as
 present at various ceremonies, and he met with Le Duan and
 Dong on the 5th and feted them on the 6th.
 SINO-VIETNAMESE     The cracks in the show of solidarity staged
 DIVERGENCES         by the two sides were clearly evident in
 the course of the visit., reflecting their
 divergent interests and priorities.  As to be expected, these
 differences derived essentially from Peking's moves in the
 big-power arena and the consequent strains in. the Peking-Hanoi.
 relationship.
 4  United States:  The repeated anti-U.S. attacks that punctuated
 the November 1971 communique are largely absent from the new
 joint document, but during the visit the Vietnamese indulged in
 outbursts against U.S. policy that contrasted with Peking's
 treatment of the United States.  Thus, Le Duan in his rally speech
 on the 7th cast.gatc:d the "extremely atrocious war of aggression
 waged by U.S. imperialism, the international gendarme," over the
 past decade and warned that Washington was attempting not only to
 impose neocolonialism in Vietnam but to oppose "the national
 liberation revolution and the socialist revolution."
 Apart from Chou's brief reference to U.S. bombing in Cambodia in
 his banquet speech on the 4th, Chinese spokesmen avoided critical
 comment or, current U.S. policy.  In his wide-ranging rally
 speech elaborating Peking's line on global upheaval and conflict,
 Yeh Chien-ying justified Peking's diplomatic moves, implicitly
 including the developing relationship with Washington, by
 advocating the development of friendly relations with various
 countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.

 During the visit the Vietnamese offered several reminders of
 the Taiwan issue, but the Chinese avoided rising to the bait.
 As in November 1971, the Vietamese side expressed support in
 the communique for liberation of Taiwan,- but the Chinese this
 time, unlike the previous occasion, failed to acknowledge
 that support.
 +  Indochina:  Having impugned Washington's current motives in
 Vietnam in his opening speech on the 4th, Lr2 Duan sharpened
 his point even further in his rally address by tracing "the
 deep root and the immediate cause" of violations of the Paris
 agreement to a U.S. "policy of neocolonialism it South Vietnam
 and of permanent partition of Vietnam."  He harshly denounced
 Saigon as a "militarist and fascist clique," and for good
 measure  he added a charge that the United States is "supporting
 the Lao rightists and conniving with them" in violating the
 Vientiane accord.
 Reflecting Peking's more rela:ced posture on implementation of
 the Vietnam agreement, the Chinese speakers failed to challenge
 U.S. intentions and were less harsh than their guests in
 criticizing Saigon.  Citing the endorsement of the Vietnam
 agreement by the Pari'  international conference, Yeh stressed
 that thorough implementation is "a very serious matter," but
 he also observed that "historical experience ar.d the facts
 after the ending of the war in Vietnam have shown that it is
 no easy task to turn an agreement into reality."  In contrast
 to Peking's more detached view, Le Duan on the 4th insisted
 that Hanoi's goals, including reunification, are "closely
 interrelated objectives of paramount importance to be achieved
 at all costs, even through a hard and complex struggle."
 The Chinese used their strongest language to warn against
 unspecified outside involvement in Indochina, with Chou asserting
 on the 4th that "no interference in Indochina under whatever
 pretext and in whatever form will be tolerated."  Chou's warning,
 with overtones as least as much anti-Soviet as anti-U.S., was
 underscored  by a remark by Mao to the guests, later repeated by
 Chou:  "Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people, not to the
 reactionaries in Viet.?.am and still leis to imperialism."
 +  Communist Unity:  Yeh's discourse on "imperialism and
 hegemonism" in his rally speech represented the most forceful
 statement of Peking's anti-Soviet line during the visit.  Though
 the substance of his warning against Moscow's detente policy

 concern not to offend the Soviets was reflected in VNA's
 censorship of Yeh's speech.  While carrying the text of all
 the other major speeches during the visit, VNA reduced Yeh's
 discussion of the international situation to an innocuous brief
 paraphrase.
 For their part, the North Vietnamese took the occasion of the
 visit to renew their appeals for international communist unity.
 In his opening bpeech on the 4th Le Duan offered a toast to
 "the tightening of the solidarity" among the communist countries,
 and he amplified this call in his rally speech.  In a passage
 acknowledging aid not only from China but also from the Soviet
 Union and other countries, he pledged that the Vietnamese "will
 endeavor to do everything in our power to contribute in a worthy
 manner to the stre.igthening of the solidarity" among the
 fraternal countries.
 The North Vietnamese have used these summit meetings to pursue
 their role as brokers for communist unity.  This was particularly
 evident in the fall of 1969, after the opening of the Sino-Soviet
 border talks, when Dong's visits to Peking and Moscow were
 marked by invocations of the appeal in Ho's testament for
 restoration of communist unity.  Le Duan had made a similar
 pitch during Podgornyy's visit to Hanoi in October 1971, as had
 Dong during his trip to Peking the following month.
 In his rally speech Le Duan made a wistful historical reference
 that reflected Hanoi's concern over unity.  He recalled that
 after the Chinese revolution Vietnam was linked with the PRC
 "and thereby with the whole socialist camp, thus adding new
 strength to us in our patriotic war."  As a result, he said,
 "we won the great victory of the battle of Dien Bien Phu which
 is of historical significance."  The historical implication
 might be that lack of unity in the communist camp makes a
 decisive new Dien Bien Phu less likely.

 PRG PRESIDENT PHAT ADDRESSES BIANNUAL COUNCIL MEETING
 The timing of the PRG Council of Ministers meeting to coincide
 with the 6 June anniversary of the founding of the government
 follows the pattern set last year when, for the first time,
 sessions were held biannually in January and June.*  There was
 no commemorative gathering held expressly to mark the PRG
 anniversary in 1972; the June Council meeting was said to have
 been held on the occasion of the anniversary, as is also the
 case this year despite the holding of the separate anniversary
 celebrations.
 The locus of the Council meeting was, as usual, described only
 as being in a "liberated area."  But it can be assumed that
 this area was not in Quang Tri, since Phat and other officials
 did not participate in the anniversary celebrations in that
 northernmost province of South Vietnam.  Quang Tri has obvious
 geographic advantages as the site of anniversary ceremonies ii
 view of the presence of envoys from the USSR, China, and other
 foreign countries.  It is not clear why the Council meeting was
 not postponed until after the anniversary to allow President Phat
 to join other leaders in Quang Tri anniversary ceremonies and in
 welcoming arriving diplomats.  However, the inability of other
 PRG officials to travel to the Quang Tri. celebrations may have
 made the holding of another meeting at PRG administrative: head-
 quarters at the time of the anniversary unavoidable.  Vietnamese
 communist media have not raised the question of a PRG capital,
 but the fact that lower-level foreign diplomatic officers as
 well as ambassadors were in Quang Tri suggests that facilities
 for a permanent diplomatic presence will be established somewhere
 in the South.
 POLITICAL REPORT     Unlike the five previous Council of
 Ministers meetings, the 6 June session did
 not release a communique.  As usual, Phat delivered the major
 political report; following the precedent set last January, it
 and the military report were made. public, while the substance of
 other reports was not revealed.  Covering predictable ground,
 Phat's report lauded the history of the Vietnamese struggle and
 the "victory" of the Paris agreement and expounded on the "role,
 prestige, and authority" of the PRG as "the sole genuine
 representative" of the South Vietnamese people.
 *  PRG Council of Ministers meeting since the government was
 established in 1969 are discussed in the TRENDS of 24 January
 1973, 14 June and 2 February 1972, 24 February 1971, and

 Phat's major points were generally identical to those made by
 Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho in his 5 June speech at the PRG
 anniversary meeting in Quang Tri.  Ater calling the United
 States the "main cause" of continuing problems in South
 Vietnam and Indochina and reaffirming long-standing goal3,
 Phat issued the cryptic warning that "our patience has its
 limits."  He added that Saigon military operations would be
 "punished" and that "no brutal force, no preasure, no
 perfidious maneuvers can makes the South Vietnamese people
 depart from their just path of struggle and their lofty goals."
 While professing the usL.al determination and optimism regarding
 eventual complete victory, Phat also voiced the standard word
 of caution about difficulties to be overcome.   Stressing the
 importance of unity with other elements in South Vietnam, he
 reaffirmed the view stressed at the January Council meeting
 that "national concord is the fundamental and foremost policy"
 of the NFLSV and PRG.
 Both Phat and Tho appealed for foreign assistance--communist
 as well as noncommunist- -for the South Vietnamese people and
 the PRG to heal the wounds of war and rebuild the country.
 The question of postwar reconstruction aid has rarely f-een
 raised in PRG media, a'.though Tho, in an interview carried by
 LPA on 3 Juno, noted that the NFLSV and PRG "encourage
 Vietnamese overseas to invest their capital in order to rebuild
 the country, and foreigners to invest capital and techniques to
 contribute to the restoration and building of the economy in
 South Vietnam .  .  .  ."  The question of U.S. aid to South
 Vietnam was touched on in a 12 April Liberation Radio report oa
 a meeting two days earlier between U.S. Senator Brooke and Hoang
 Anh Tuan--then deputy head of the PRG delegation to the JMC.
 Tuan expressed the view that the question of U.S. aid must be
 brought up with the government formed after general elections
 and that "in the absence of such a government, U.S. contributions
 must be channeled through the two present administrations in
 the South--the PRG and the Saigon administration."
 MILITARY REP RT     The report to the Council on military
 matters claimed that the PRG has exercised
 self-restraint and set forth reasonable proposals for a
 cease-fire and the achievement of rational concord, and it
 added--echoing the warnings by Tho and Phat--that "this good
 will is also limited." The report was given by Lt. Gen. Tran
 Van Tra, who was said to represent the PLAF Command and to be
 authorized by the PRG Defense Ministry.

 This is the first time Tra has assumed the role of spokesman
 on the South Vietnamese military situation; he has not been
 identified in a new position since he was replaced on 12 May,
 by Hoang Anh Tuan, as head of the PRG delegation to the Joint
 Military Commission (JMC).  At the January Council meeting
 the military report was similarly read by a representative of
 the PLAF Command and Defense Ministry, one Le Chan, rather
 than by the more logical spokesman--Defense Minister Tran Nam
 Trung.
 U.S.-DRV TALKS IGNORED, PRG PROPOSALS FOR SETTLEMENT REPEATED
 Alt: ',ugh Hanoi media had announced the 6 June resumption of the
 talks in Paris between Kissinger and Le Duc Tho which had begun
 in May, they failed to mention the talks a,;sin recessed on
 9 June and resumed on the 12th.  Consi::aent with this silence,
 Vietnamese communist reports of PRG Fot.:Ign Minister Nguyen Thi
 Binh's 6 June press conference in Quang Tri ignored her remarks
 on the Paris meetings.  The French CP organ L'HUMANITE reported
 on the 9th that Binh had "emphasized" that the talks took place
 at Kissinger's request.  She also reportedly expressed approval
 of the meetings but warned that the struggle to implement the
 Paris agreement will require "much patience and energy" even if
 world opinion and "domestic difficulties such as the Watergate
 affair" cause the United States to reaffirm the validity of the
 agreement and accept its own and Saigon's responsibility for
 implementing it.*
 Issues that were presumably on t' a agenda of the U.S.-DRV talks
 in Paris, however, have been given publicity in Vietnamese
 communist media in the course of their efforts to press the PRG's
 six-point proposal advanced on 25 April.  Nguyen Huu Tho in
 his 5 June PRG anniversary speech, for example, reaffirmed the
 PRG's adherence to the six points and specifically demanded an
 end to the fighting, the release of all civilian prisoners, a
 guarantee of democratic liberties, and the establishment of the
 k -Hanoi media have continued to carry accounts of Western press
 reports on Watergate developments but have generally avoided
 comment.  For example, the army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN from
 15 through 30 May carried a 15-part series on Watergate from
 Western news reports, with only the final installment offering
 the, independent comment that President Nixon is supported by
 "powerful capitalists" who will not let him be "overthrown."

 National Council of National Reconciliation and Concord.  His
 omission of the final two points--on general elections and
 the reduction of armed forces--reflected the communists'
 cousis;:ent position that these questions can only be settled
 after full implementation of the first four points.*
 A 13 June NHAN DAN article, which repeated the standard clairr
 that the Thieu regime is seeking a military victory rather
 than a settlement under the Pariq agreement, denounced Saigon
 allegations that communist forces are preparing to launch a
 new military offensive designated "operation elephant tail
 and mouse head."  Judging from the brief VNA summary, however,
 NHAN DAN did not acknowledge reports that such an operation
 might begin if the communists fail to achieve their aims in
 the Paris talks.
 SI' IANOUK CITES DR's . PRC SUPPORT; MiOSCOW REPORTS PRINCES TOUR
 Prince Sihanouk and his front seem to have assumed a more relaxed
 posture after earlier having given vent to strident outbursts
 against a "Munich-style conference" in which outside powers would
 exert pressure for a compromise settlement in Cambodia.  The
 stream of attacks on a cease-fife agreement issued by Sihanouk
 on his foreign tour and by the resistance leaders have trickled
 to an infrequent statement on the settlement issue.  This change
 coincides with the Sino-Vietnamese summit in Peking and may
 reflect assurances to the FUNK that its allies are not seeking a
 deal at the expense of its objectives of overthrowing the Lon Nol
 regime.
 In a speech in Tirana on 8 June, Sihanouk derided Washington for
 declaring that the United States and the DRV "will sooner..' the
 armed resistance of the Khmer people" and enable the Phnom Penh
 "treacherous clique" to survive indefinitely.   Asserting that
 this "shameless political maneuver" has been exposed by the DRV
 leaders themselves, he disclosed that Le Dunn and Pham Van Dong
 had assured his prime minister, Penn Nouth, in Peking on the 5th
 that the DRV would never discuss the Cambodian question in place
 of the FUNK and that the United States should talk directly with
 Sihanouk's government.  Later in the speech Sihanouk quoted Chou
 En-lai's 4 June warning that no outside interference in Indochina
 will be tolerated as well as Chou's endorsement of Sihanouk's
 five-point declaration.

 reporting the DRV leaders' meeti:-g with Penn Nouth, Hanoi
 mcola supplied no substance of the conversation.  But a
 9 June NHAN DAN article repeated earlier denials that a
 Cambodian settlement was being negotiated between the DRV
 and the United States.
 MOSCOW     The Soviets have further complicated the murky
 Cambodian story by beginning to report for the first
 time on Sihanouk's foreign tour.  Soviet references to Sihanouk
 since his overthrow and exile in Peking have been rare, and
 he had not been mentioned in monitored Soviet media since before
 the signing of the Vietnam agreement.  However, brief TASS reports
 on the 8th and 10th noted his stays in Algeria and Yugoslavia.
 The reports maintained Moscow's avoidance of references to
 Sihanouk's government, but TASS quoted him as saying to Tito
 that Cambodia needs the support of other countries sad recognition
 of the FUNK.  As to be expected, Moscow did not report his visit
 to Albania, where he pointedly thanked "our beloved Albanian
 brothers" for their support "while some allegedly anti-imperialist
 countries, and indeed not unimportant, feign not to understand us."
 Moscow's decision to report on Sihanouk's travels and his appeal
 for support suggests that the Soviets may find it opportune to
 cultivate the FUNK at this time.  A Soviet commentary on the
 7th raised the possibility of a negotiated settlement in Cambodia
 in observing that "there are objective conditions for restoring
 peace and settling the military conflict by political means,"
 which would conform with "the basic national interests of the
 Cambodians."  The commentary noted vaguely that there are
 unspecified "healthy forces" in Cambodia "capable of carrying
 out the will of the people and of keeping agreements on the
 basis of respect for their legitimate rights and aspirations."

 USSR-JAPAN
 MOSCOW POSTPONES TANAKA VISIT, TOUGHENS LINE ON JAPAN
 An unusually candid article on Soviet-Japanese economic cooperation
 published in LITERARY GAZETTE on 6 June--the same day the Soviet
 Union informed Foreign Minister Ohira that Prime Minister Tanaka's
 projected visit to Moscow in August* would be "inconven!_ent" at
 that time--sugges:,s that Moscow is using the summit as a lever to
 pry out better terms for Soviet-Japanese economic and technical
 cooperation as well as to increase its bargaining position on the
 sensitive territorial question which still inhibits Soviet-Japanese
 relations.  The article reveals that some hardening on the terms
 for trade and closer economic ties with Japan may be in  he
 offing in the wake of Brezhnev's recent meeting with Chancellor
 Brandt in Bonn which opened the prospect of USSR-FRG agreements
 on economic and technical exchanges and as Moscow reevaluates
 Japanese-Chinese relations.
 FOCUS ON CREDITS     Departing from the tone of previous Soviet
 comment on joint economic cooperation with
 Japan, the lengthy article, jointly written by D. Petrov and
 V. Syrkomskiy, played down the specter of Japan as an industrial
 giant by placing heavy stress on Japan's reliance on raw materials
 for its survival.   After noting that "there are almost no minerals
 in Japan," the article argued that "the tremendous interest which
 Japan is displaying in the possibility of acquiring raw materials
 from the boundless resources of Siberia is understandable."
 Sharpening the image of the USSR as a pote-itial economic partner
 in meeting Japan's "acute" need for raw materials, the article
 became unusually specific in outlining the terms of future Soviet-
 Japan economic cooperation:
 Our position is perfectly clear.  We say:  You need raw
 material?  By all means, we are ready to accelerate the
 development of the appropriate deposits to satisfy your
 requirements.  Give us credits and we will buy equipment
 and mechanisms from you and pay for them in raw materials.
 *  The Soviet Ambassador to Japan asked on the 6th that Tanaka's
 trip be postponed to some time between mid-September and mid-
 October.  KYOPO on 9 June reported Tanaka's announcement that he
 would visit the USSR after 20 September.  At this writing, Mcscow
 media have not yet confirmed a September meeting.

 After highlighting statements by several Japanese '-'isinessmen
 favoring government support for "large bank credits" to the
 Soviet Union as a means of overcoming Jaran's "energy crisis,"
 the article linked future economic coopet.tion between Moscow
 and Tokyo to still unresolved political problems.  "It would
 be wrong to turn a blind eye," the article cautioned, "to the
 fact that there are also forces in present-day Japan which are
 trying to put obstacles in the path of the development of
 good-neighborly relations.  Ultraright elements, for example;
 are still dragging out the so-called territorial question."
 In keeping with the shift in Moscow's line on the status of
 the four northern islands which dates back to Brezhnev's letter
 to Tanaka last March, the article avoided claiming that the
 territorial issue was "settled,"  It did, nevertheless, firmly
 argue that "the highway leading to the establishment of relations
 of true good-neighborliness and friendship consists not of
 creating artificial barriers under false pretexts but of seeking
 mutually acceptable resolutions."
 THE CHINESE DIMENSION     Bringing in the Chinese factor, Petrov
 and Syrkomskiy then pointed to the
 recently concluded month-long visit to Japan of a Chinese
 delegation led by Liao Cheng-chih, head of the China-Japan
 Friendship Association, as evidence that "the Maoist leadership
 is trying to use Chinese-Japanese contacts to hinder the
 development of good--urighborly relations between Japan and the
 Soviet Union."  Liao's delegation was specifically charged with
 having made "slanderous attacks on the Soviet Union" in trying
 to "persuade Japanese business circles not to embark on broad
 economic cooperation with "ur country, threatening to regard
 it as an 'unfriendly act' against China."  Displaying an unusual
 degree of confidence regarding the still budding relationship
 between Peking and Tokyo, however, the article introduced a
 new theme in Moscow's line on the Sino-Japanese rapprochement.
 It argued that "the initial boom linked to the establishment of
 diplomatic relations last fall has clearly slumped."  Developing
 this argument, the article claimed that "the representatives
 of business circles and political leaders who put all their
 money on China are proving to be in an increasingly embarassing
 position."  As illustration, the article cited recent Japanese
 press reports that Chinese toy pandas--a "fashionable symbol"
 of the establishment of relations with China several months ago--
 are now "piled up on the toy counters" in Japanese stores looking
 "sadly at the indifferent passersby as though they knew that the
 man who invested all his capital in the manufacture of pandas,
 committed suicide when the dust began to settle on thousands of
 the toys in storehouses."

 Linking this specter of public disenchantment with Peking Lo Tanaka's
 forthcoming visit to Moscow, Petrov and Syrkomskiy pointed to an
 unidentified article in the JAPAN TIMES as having contained "a
 warning for tlose who have not lost hope of using relations
 hetween the USSR and the PRC as the subjects of a shady diplomatic
 game" and for having pointed out that one of the tasks of Prime
 Minister Tanaka's trip to Moscow must be the "liquidation of any
 suspicion whatever regarding Japan's intention to make a deal with
 Peking against the intetests of the Soviet Union."  The JAPAN TIMES
 article was also said to have called for a statement that Japan
 not only "has not the slightest desire to be dragged into disputes
 between the USSR and China," but that it is also "not in any way
 interested in us.Lag in any form contradictions between them. PAZ it;
 own interests."
 As If to underscore the significance of Brezhnev's recent trip to
 Eon: and the possible emergence of West Germany as an economic
 riv.31 of Japan in trade with Moscow, Petrov and Syrkomskiy reported
 that the JAPAN TIMES had noted that this "unprecedented meeting"
 signals "colossal progress" in z-il,.!11ons between the two cou':.ies
 as we,.1 as "the start of a new e-.a" in Europe.  Turning to "Tanaka's
 decision to visit Moscow this year," Petrov and Syrkomskiy advised

 process of the relaxation of international tension io increasingly

 USSR - LIBYA
 LITERARY GAZETTE ASSAILS AL-QADMDHAFI FOR ANTICOMMUNISM
 Moscow's irritation wiLn Libyan President al-Qadhdhafi has been
 displayed most recently Is a LITERARY GAZETTE article of 6 June
 which to.-)k issue with his "wild assertions" about communism.
 Soviet-Libyan press friction erupted over a year ago when PRAVDA
 in Mich 1972 objected to an "overtly provocative article" in
 the Libyan army paper which coincided with the official visit
 to Moscow of a Libyan Government delegation headed by then
 Economy Minister Jallud.  Since then Moscow has periodically
 responded to Libyan positions:  NFW TIMES last September "regretted"
 al-Qadhdhaf is Maoist,-oriented phraseology and found Libya
 "in particular need of accurate orientation"; LITERA.'.Y GAZETTE
 in October deplored a Libyans press article "blaspheming"
 an-Nasir and in November assailed a Libyan paper for its
 "dubious role as 'exposer of communism."'  And this January
 LITERARY GAZETTE dismissed as "'Fanciful imagination" assertions
 by al--Qadhdhafi that the USSR had twice requt,P~ted 0;-L and naval
 bases in Libya.
 Now Borisov, in the 6 June LITERARY GAZETTE, further demonstrated
 Soviet sensitivity to al-Qadhdhafi's "accusations against
 communism" as rejecting nationalism, advocating atheism, and
 other "absurd ideas."  In his ar?ti.cle--broadcast in installments
 In Moscow's Arabic service--Borisov derided the Libyan leader's
 "third theory" concept of an alternative to capitalism and
 communism and scoffed at his new ideology of "true socialism"
 based on justice and Islam.  While he made no mention of the
 Egyptian-Lib;'an merger scheduled for Se!i)tember, Borisov
 pointedly contrasted al-Qadhdhafi's "anticommunism and anti-Sovietism"
 with the Egyptian "official" position and quoted an-Nasir and
 as-Sadat on the merits of Soviet-Arab friendship.
 Borisov also ignored al-Qadhdhafi's "popular revolution," launched
 in a 15 April speech and brushed off by Moscow in a domestic
 servi,:e broadcast five days later which had tersely noted that
 the first steps included "mass arrests of ;.ibyan Communist Party
 members."  A week later, NEW TIMES had observed that while reports
 were confusing, "the aim appears to be 'revolutionization' of
 Libya" on the basis of Islam.*
 *  The Czechoslovak CTK in a Tripoli-datelined report on 11 June
 remarked that Libya's cultural revolution was aimed not against
 :-reign oil companies but against "progressiv_ forces in the
 country under dogmatic slogans" of Islam and nationalism, and
 added that Egypt "is not expected to approve such a policy after
 the planned merger."

 Taking another swipe at al-Qadlidhafi's "anticommunism," a Moscow
 br^adcast in Arabic on 11 June pegged to the anniversary of the
 evacuation of Wheelus base lectured on the importance of the
 USSR's great support and aid to the Arab countries and recalled
 that the Soviet stand was "appropriately appreciated" in the
 joint communique on Jallud's March 1972 visit to Moscow.
 Against this background, the commentary found it "extremely
 odd, to say the least," that voices were being raised in Libya
 trying to cast doubts on Soviet policy.
 In a further display of pique, Moscow all but ignored al-Qadhdhafi's
 anniversary speech on the 11th:  In two one-sentence dispatches
 from Tri.poli, TASS that day attributed to the Libyan Revolution

 nationalize the American oil company Bunker Hunt.  Reporting

 on Bunker Hunt as motivated by the United States' "all-out support."

 EUROPE
 WARSAW ARMY PAPER URGES FRENCH ATTENDANCE AT VIENNA TAUCS
 Broaching a subject rarely discussed in Soviet bloc media, the
 Polish army daily ZOLNIERZ WOLNOSCI on 5 June provided a
 generally favorable review of French positions on MBFR,
 suggesting that eventual French participation could be
 anticipated on the basis of France's expressed interests.
 Picking and choosing among French statements to support this
 interpretation, the Polish paper highlighted arguments that
 seemed to suggest a parallel between French and Soviet bloc
 positions.  In this context it revealed some insights into
 Soviet bloc attitudes, mainly a strong Polish interest in
 seeing France join the talks.  It also aired an idea on force
 reductions that has not previously been advanced in Soviet bloc
 media--the idea of substituting offsetting for parallel force
 reductions, which would have the effect of maintaining a balance
 between the offensive and defensive forces of the opposing sides
 while overall force levels were being reduced.
 The argument advanced by ZOLNIERZ WOLNOSCI is consistent both
 with the general Soviet position that the talks should be open
 to "other European states" and with Soviet statements on France
 in particular.  Moscow media discussed the possibility of a
 French role in MBFR in mid-January following the Ponp.Ldou-hrezhnev
 talks in Minsk. Writing about the talks in SOVIET RUSSIA on the
 18th, TASS Director General Zamyatin took approving note of
 evidence suggesting that Pompidou was receptive to Brezhnev's
 "appeal" for French participation.  MoE.:ow has been reticent,
 however, about discussing Fresh positions in detail and about
 offering advice to the French as to what their policy toward
 the talks should be.
 ZOLNIERZ WOLNOSCI showed no such reticence.   It went into
 considerable detail in discussing French argume.rics against
 MBFR, suggesting that Poland shared French attitudes to some
 extent.  It made this particularly clear with respect to the
 impact of force reductions on the military baalance in West
 Europe.  Noting with approval French cuncerni, on this score,
 it observed that only West Germany was in a position to profit
 from the withdrawal of American troops from the continent.
 Obviously expressi.Lg its own concerns as well as sympathy for
 the French position, it asserted that "a ftnher increase in the

 It went on to suggest, however, that France should not allow
 itself to be dissuaded by these considerations from contributing
 it-9 share to the cause of European oecurity and disarmament.
 It broadly implied that French objections to participation were
 based in part on a false premise--that the conditions governing
 force reductions would be those heretofore set forth in NATO
 documents.  The future conference, it asserted, "will have little
 in common" with this concept, and its results "will not harm the
 security interests of any side."

 FORCE REDUCTIONS      for France's participation in the talks,
 ZOLNIERZ WOLNOSCI noted France's objections
 to the "asymmetrical" force reduction schemes advanced by NATO.
 Praising the French attitude, the paper referred to studies
 being undertaken in France regarding alternative methods for
 bringing about force cuts.  It drew particular attention to a
 model that would focus on "offensive-defensive types of weapons,"
 saying the Quai d'Orsay regarded this model as among the "most
 logical."  Apparently implying its own interest in the idea, it
 went on to explain how the model would work:  Warsaw Pact tanks,
 it said, could be balanced off against NATO antitank weapons,
 and proportional reductions could be arranged accordingly.

 POLITICAL ECONOMISTS RESIST PRESSURES FOR REFORM
 Despite a December 1971 Central. Committee decree criticizing
 the Institute of Economics for concentrating on abstract
 doctrinal matters rather than on practical economic concerns,
 the predominantly conservative school of political economists
 has continued to resist pressure to reform its ways. Since the
 adoption of the decree, the conservatives have opposed attempts
 to revise the training of political economists to include
 modern economic concepts and methods.  At the same time, a
 recent PRAVDA article, apparently reflecting official impatience,
 attacked several political economists by name for obstructing
 the application of modern methods in the Soviet economy.
 The recalcitrant attitude toward innovation prevailing among
 political econ-imi,_;ts was displayed at a recent Moscow State
 University conference on training instructors in this field,
 reported in KOMSONOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 27 May.  According to the
 report, by liberal economist Gennadiy Lisichkin., proposals were
 made at the conference to broaden the educatiorrl curriculum to
 include instruction in computers, mathematics, and production
 technology in addition to the traditional doctrinal courses.
 However, Leningrad State University dean V.A. Peshekhonov
 objected to the proposals on grounds that they would distract:
 students from study of "Marxist-Leninist knowledge of the
 regularities of economic development."  In a similar earlier
 attempt to alter the dogmatic orientation of training, reported
 by Yugoslav reporter Risto Bajalski in the 10 April Yugoslav
 paper POLITIKA, a prominent textbook on political economy was
 attacked for containing ultraconservative formulations contrary
 to the regime's   ;onomic reform.  The text's author, Nikolay
 Tsagolov, head of Moscow State University's political economy
 department, responded by attacking its critics as symp.Athetic t:,
 "market socialism" and by refusing to alter his book.
 The continued sniping by conservatives at modern economic methods
 prompt?d a 4 June PRAVDA article by I. Solovyev.  Citing Brezhnev's
 endorsement of mathematical-economic models, systems analysis,
 and other modern methods, Solovyev assailed articles by Yuriy
 Belik for opposing new methods of planning, by Yakov Kronrod for
 endeavoring to .discredit modern methods of systems analysis, and
 by Adolf Kats for attacking the works of leading Soviet mathematical

 economists.  Although the PRAVDA article fell short of offering
 a blanket endorsement of the ui.verEe contributions of the new
 economics, it served as a warning to political economists that
 the methods of ideological abuse and character assassination
 employed in past disputes were no longer suited to the times.
 ECONOMISTS RESUME DEBATE OVER FUTURE OF KOLK'IOZ SYSTEM
 Although the idea of converting kolkhozes into sovkhozes was
 vigorously repudiated after Khrushchev's fall, the initiation
 of work on a long-range plan for 1.976-1990 has reopened the
 dispute over the future of the kolkhoz system.  The controversy
 erupted last December at one of a series of meetings conducted
 by the Institute of Economics as part of its contribution to
 the long-range plan.  The debate at the December meeting arose
 over an article prepared for publication in QUESTIONS OF
 ECONOMICS by Yakov Kronrod, head of the institute's sector for
 general problems of the political economy of socialism.  The
 article, which later appeared in the February issue of the
 journal, argued that kolkhozes were incompatible with socialism
 and would be taken over by the state even before the advent of
 communism.
 Although the deputy director of the institute, Viktor Cherkovets,
 agreed with Kronrod, the head of its economic history sector,
 Ivan Gladkov, took strong exception to Kronrod's assertion that
 the kolkhozes are "not an obligatory element of the socialist
 system" and should be tf.rminated.  Gladkov continued the debate
 in the April QUESTIONS OF ECONOMICS, upholding the socialist
 credentials of kolkhozes and complaining that Kronrod's thesis
 simply amounted to "turning kolkhozes into sovkhozes."  "The
 task for the future," he argued, "is to strengthen the kolkhoz
 system in every way."

 RED STAR'S NEW THEORETICAL SERIES TAKES IDEOLOGICAL TURN
 The second installment of RED STAR's new series on military
 theoretical questions has brought into sharper focus the issue
 rf party-military relations tentatively raised by Lt. Gen.
 I. Zavyalov in the first article on 17 April.*      Without
 directly contesting the claim advanced by Zavyalov, that the
 military's co-authorship of military doctrine gives it a
 strong influence in the formulation of military policy, the
 second article conveys a sharply different impression of
 the dynamics of the party-military relationship in this
 sphere.  It implies that the party, through its correct
 interpretation and application of Marxist-Leninist philosophy,
 informs and guides all creative intellectual activities in
 the Soviet Union, including military thought.  Published on
 17 May, the article is authored by Maj. Gen. A. Milovidov, a
 long-time faculty member of the Lenin Military-Political Academy.
 The issue at the heart of Milovidov'.sarticle is the question
 of the autonomy of military thought.  The Soviet military has
 consistently claimed extensive rights in this regard, apparently
 acting on the belief that a certain independence from party
 interference is a necessary condition both for the effective
 performance of its institutional functions and for the
 succesuful assertion of its interests in the policymaking
 process.  Accordingly, it has cultivated the notion that
 military affairs fall under a special. discipline of thought,
 military science, and that the findings of this science are
 a necessary ingredient in the formulation of military policy.
 Soviet military spokesmen have advanced this view repeatedly.
 Perhaps the best known exposition of the viewpoint was the
 late Marshal Zakharov's 4 February 1965 article iu RED STAR
 attacking Khrushchev for his "subjectivism" and "hare-brained"
 scheming.  Zakharov reserved his strongest indignation for
 Khrushchev's practice of rejecting the advice of military
 professionals--a practice which disregarded the fact, the
 marshal emphasized, that this advice was "based on a profound
 study of military affairs and the laws. of armed conflict."
 *  Zavyalov's article is discussed in the TRENDS of 2 May 1973,
 pages 2-3.

 13 JUNE 1973
 While Milovidov's article avoids any direct challenge of this
 military viewpoint and specifically disavows any intention of
 raising one, it does so indirectly by attacking historical
 views easily identifiable with traditional military biases.
 Purporting to see in the history of Soviet military thought
 recurrent instances of an overly narrow, technical approach
 to the analysis of war, Milovidov contrasts this approach
 with the one assertedly upheld by the party--a broad
 philosophical approach, in which war is viewed not simply
 as the art of armed conflict but as a social and political
 phenomenon.  He implies that it was only due to timely
 interventions by the party that Soviet military thought was
 saved from serious methodological errors.
 i
 Milovidov refers in this connection to an unidentified
 "discussion," clearly the 1965-66 debate involving Talenskiy,
 Rybkin, and Grudinin over the question of whether the
 destructiveness of nuclear weapons repealed the Leninist
 axiom that war is an extension of policy.*  Criticizing
 the affirmative position that had been taken on this issue--
 by Rybkin, among others--Milovidov asserts that it stemmed
 from a tendency to "absolutize" the technical aspects of war.
 He goes on to suggest that this was the same tendency that
 had led Trotskiy and his adherents to define the military
 profession as the "trade of war."
 By placing his argument in the context of these historical
 errors, Milovidov clearly raises a signal of polemical intent.
 Yet he refrains from extending his criticisms beyond the
 historical incidents mentioned, in keeping with his disavowal
 of any intention of challenging the military position on the
 autonomy of military thought.  Indeed, he goes so far as to
 acknowledge that "military s-ience has its own inner logic."
 A final assessment of Milovidov's intent can only be given
 by his colleagues, and subsequent articles in the series may
 shed some light on their verdict.  In the meantime, it can be
 said that Milovidov has redressed the military bias introduced
 into the new RED STAR series by Zavyalov by balancing it with
 a strong assertion of the party's guiding role in military
 thought.

 COLLEGE ENROLLMENT UNDERWAY. SCHOCLS TIGHTEN STANDARDS
 college enrollment for the autumn term finally seems well underway
 with Fukien, Liaoning, and Ki ngsi joining Hunan and Kwangsi in
 announcing that the enrollment program is in progress.  cost
 qualifications for students are similar to those adopted lust year,
 when Kwangsi, for example, noted that 70 percent of those admitted
 met senior middle school graduate standards and that policies had
 been adopted to enroll a certain number of women, minority groups,
 and children of nonworking people.  The broadcasts this year all
 specify that students to be enrolled must have at least the equiv-
 alent of a junior middle school cultural level, be about 20 years
 old, be unmarried and in good health, and have at least two year,
 of practical experience.  These students will obviously be drawn
 from recent graduates with good school and political records.
 The Kiangsi announcement on 10 June, however, differentiated these
 students from the workers, peasants, and revolu':ionary cadres to be
 admitted, detailing how the schools may meet pt.ublems caused by
 bringing in students with low cultural levels.  :.ike some schemes
 aired in previous years, the Kiangsi plan calls for segregating
 unqualified worker-students into special "preparatory" classes
 instead of mixing them in with the educated youths.  Thus the Maoist
 ideal of open education is squared with the need for better substan-
 tive college training.  The workers will not be required to meet
 standards required of regular students.  Admissions will be "as
 flexible as possible," though workers must have at least eight
 years of practical experience.  A "small number" of workers will
 be admitted to general courses, but for them there is an age limit
 of 30 and their college study must be arranged se that they can
 "apply what they have studied after graduation."
 Unlike in previous stages of educational reform, the Kiangsi plan
 explicitly provides authority for removing unsuccessful students
 "if within three months after admission a student is found to be
 lacking proper qualifications or to have violated the enrollment
 procedures."  The plan also offer; considerable discretion to the
 schools.  Each student admitted must pass a written admissions
 examination given by the school even though he must have already
 been examined and approved by party committees at the regional and
 municipal levels.

 The Kiangsi enrollment plan takes note of the problems produced
 by the need to allow for admission of a representative numuer of
 students sent down to the ccuntryside.  While each county is to
 be considered a unit for testing and selection, with applicants
 selected in general according to county quotas, the broadcast
 specifies that "more students should be selected from the areas
 where large numbers of e:ucated young people are concentrated."
 .he current guidelines, especially the detailed account offered
 by Kiangsi, indicate that, PRC educational authorities are making
 serious efforts to deal %rith complaints over policies devised
 during the cultural revolution.  All cultural revolution effects
 have not been removed, however; approval of the masses, two years
 of labor, and a good political record are still prerequisites
 for any student seeking admission.  The only consolatiizn offered
 thooe who do n'at meet riaquirementn are that they "happily remain
 at their own posts" where cney -;at; also make contributions.
 PRC MEDIA NOTE AGRICULTURAL PROBLEMS. URGE GREATER EFFORTS
 Recent broadcasts have expressed concern about harvest prospects
 in view of a second straight year of poor weather, but there are
 no signs that a change in China's current moderate agricultural
 policies is contemplated.  All economic sectors have been advioed
 to give first priority to rapid development of agriculture.  A
 Canton broadcast of a 10 June SOUTHERN DAILY editorial warned that
 funds must not be diverted from agriculture and that industry
 must concentrate on thi_gs which produce "rapid results" in agricul-
 ture this year when "the weather in Kwangtung is abnormal and the
 flood season arrived early."  Industry was told to nave on electricity
 in order to insure power for draining land, and factories were told
 to organize emergency teams of mechanics for the crash repair of
 farm machinery.  While broadcasts earlier this spring suggested that
 some small fertilizer plants might be closed because of their
 excessive use of coal, the editorial stated that "coal, electricity,
 and material" for the plants nust be assured.  In stressing
 agriculture the editorial made the rare admission that "for a
 certain time less material and finance might be available for
 developing heavy industry," though in the long run its development
 will be "more rapid."
 There is evidence of sensitivity about publicizing the adverse
 natural conditions endangering this ;ear's harvest.  NCNA on 30
 May went so far as to halt publication of a report it had disseminated
 which called the drought in Hopei "even more serious than the one
 last year," replacing it with an article cn 1 June removing that

 ,Judgment while stressing the hard work bni:ig done to overcome
 natural disasters.   An Anhwei broitdcatit on 10 ,;une tried to put
 nn optimistic gloss in the situation, stating Lunt "in various
 localities" output of rapeseed and summer grain is greater than
 last yenr.   In general the provincial med&n have warned against over
 optimism while encouraging Lite peasants with exhortations that
 hard work can overcome natural disasters.  A Chekiang broadcast
 on 7 June linked a forecast of "excessive rains in June" with it
 call Lo increase efforts on "the dangerously threatened projects"
 so that: they will withstand the flooding enfely.  A HUNAN DALLY
 editorial on 9 June stated that early crops are "growing comparatively
 well," but warned that rain and floods in some areas coupled with
 pests and plant diseat,es hav. Introduced "certain unfavorable
 factors."  The editorial, like a few others earlier, warned also
 against "sabotage by the class enemies."
 While flooding seems to be i problem in southern China and drought
 serious in the north, a turn in the weather  ot'ld still result in
 a relatively good crop.  Last year's crop shortfall and the gloomy
 prospects this year have not convinced the Chinese leadership
 that any radical change in agricultural policy is needed.  Most
 cadres are probably quite conscious of the difference btttween the
 relatively mild difficulties r-sulting from the current period
 of bad weather during a period of economic moderation and the
 anguish of the Great Leap when weather problems were exacerbate,]
 by radical agricultural experimentation.  A 9 June Hupeh broadcast
 even suggested that more retreats from the old commune ideal will
 be allowed those production teams that desire them.  The broadcast
 praised a production team which as part of its policy of awarding
 remuneration according to labor had split up the labor force into
 six work ",roups.  Individual work points are assessed not by the
 larger team but by the small work groups according to the quality
 and quantity of work done, thus bringing individual initiative
 even more in line with wages paid.

 PRAGUE CEMA SESSION:  The final communique on the 27th CEMA

 call for organizational ties between (;:MA and the Common
 Markel, issuing instead u general appeal. for expanded economic

 on the desirability of cooperation between the two economic

 The Prague gathering ratifieu the 16 May 1973 cooperation
 agreement between CEMA and Finland as  2 prototy,.e for economic
 cooperation between states with differing social systems,
 based on "equality and noninterference."  As at the 26th CEMA
 meeting  in Moscow last July, the mall preoccupation at Prague
 was with implementation of the long-range CEMA integration
 program 7dupted two years ago in Bucharest.
 The Soviet and East European representation at the Prague
 gathering, as at last year's Moscow meeting, was at the heads-
 of-government level ~cxciept for the GDR's First Deputy Premier
 Sindermann; Premier Stoph wAs absent for reasons of health,
 according to TAN.IUG.  Cuba, accepted to CEMA membership last
 July, was represusnced by Deputy Premier Rodriguez; Yugoslavia,

 sharply downgraded NATO estimates of the threat currently posed

 has been that the speech revealed "contradictions" between the
 European countti,!!s' interests and U.S. demands for greater West
 European sharing of the burden on the U.S. balance of payments.
 A Prague radio commentary on the 10th declared that Schlesinger

 comtncitnry," broadcast In German on the lath.   Concentrating on
 the issue of burden-sharing,  thin commentary also referred
 to a st111-unfinished Defense Department study on NATO and
 Warsaw Peet capabtlttlen described In detnil by Michael Getler
 In the Washington POST on the 7th.   Without specifically
 mentioning Get.ler's nrticLe, the commenti.tor said the study
 questioned the "reast..,ableness" of many U.S. military concepts
 and doctrines regarding deterrence policy.   In a possible
 allusion to tho uubstar.ce of Schlesinger's remarks, It
 added that tho rer;ulta of the Pentngr-i study challenged the
 "official line of the West European hierarchy of NATO" on
 defense policy.  A similnr observation appeared in a Budapest
 radio commentary on the 10th which said U.S. and West European
 views on European security clashed at Brussels, with the former
 believing. "on the basis of secret and not so iecret data and
 reports," that the forces of both East and West can be reduced
 in central Europe.
 RADIO FREE EUROPE FUNDING:   There has been limited East European
 reaction--but no monitored Soviet reference--to the 7 May
 Presidential statement endorsing the recommendations of the
 Presidential Study Commission on international Radio Broadcasting
 (the Eisenhower commission), which concluded that U.S. funding
 of Radio F'rie Europe and Radio Liberty should continue.
 C:,echoslovak and Bulgarian media have strongly c.ritici.zed the
 Administration's decision to ask Congress for additional
 funding to extend the life of the two "ldeologicsl" radios.
 While noting that the commission's recommendations allow for a
 possible termination of the radios' ac;.ivities if future
 political conditions are suitable, Sofia's RABOTNICHESKO DELO
 on 9 May asserted that the "clear" issue was one of continued
 'ttdeological subversion" efforts against the USSR and the other
 socialist states.  Bratislava's PRAVDA on 11 May described
 the output of the radio as interference in the domestic affairs
 of the socialist countries.  Echoing a theme of past East
 European comment on RFE and Radio Liberty, Prague radio on
 25 May urged the FRG to remove from its territory the radio
 stations. which "propagate opinions alien to the strivings of the
 West German Government."  The comment observed that Congress will
 not necessarily approve the Administration's recommendations.
