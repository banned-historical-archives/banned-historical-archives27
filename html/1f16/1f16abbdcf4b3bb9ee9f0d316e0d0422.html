 Soviet Asset     WORLD MARXIST REVIEW
 Not Unilateral
 An effective method of
 encouraging expressions
 of appreciation for what the United
 States is doing in Vietnam and in
 other world trouble spots is the
 "Letter to the editor" of local news-
 papers signed by citizens of the
 foreign country.
 An excellent example of this is
 the letter (see attached reproduction)
 in the 25 April L'AURORE of Paris
 signed by a certain Monsieur Hummel
 urging Frenchmen to send cards to the
 American Embassy to show that demon-
 strations of antipathy toward the
 United States actually come from only
 a minority of Frenchmen.  (The Embassy
 subsequently reported that it had
 received, as a result of this private
 initiative, a flood of mail supporting
 U.S. policy in Vietnam and saying
 "Merci" to Americans for their
 assistance in World Wars I and II.)
 O b
 For the second time in five
 months, the Rumanian edition (March
 1967) of WORLD MARXIST REVIEW (PROB-
 LEMS OF PEACE AND SOCIALISM) omitted
 the lead article contained in the Eng-
 lish, Russian and other language
 editions.   The article in question,
 attributed to Gus Hall, American
 Communist leader, was entitled "The
 Foe Does not Succumb to Slogans".
 The Rumanians objected to it because
 of remarks it contained which were
 highly critical of the Chinese Commun-
 ist Party leaders (specifically naming
 Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao).   In Novem-
 ber 1966, the Rumanians also omitted
 the lead article in their edition.
 Entitled "October and Progress", it
 dealt with the differences between
 the more industrially developed
 countries of the Soviet Bloc such as
 East Germany and Czechoslovakia,
 and the essentially agrarian countries,
 which certainly included Rumania.
 That article also contained oblique
 remarks intended to be critical of
 Red China, such as a reference to
 the "nihilistic theories of Bakunin".
 Another article dealing with South
 and Southeast Asia was also omitted
 from the November Rumanian edition,
 apparently because of critical remarks
 concerning India, Ceylon, and other
 countries with which the Rumanians
 would like to maintain cordial rela-
 tions.  As WMR is the authoritative
 Soviet international review -- though
 published in Prague, it is Soviet-
 supported, and its editor is a high
 CPSU official -- these instances of
 Rumanian censorship are undoubtedly
 highly displeasing to the Soviet

 Rights Commission at its last session,
 on the "Elimination of All Forms of
 Religious Intolerance."  Nations
 which ratify the Convention would be
 committed to give individuals freedom
 to believe or not to believe, to
 change their belief, to manifest it
 to acts of worship, and to teach it
 to their children without threat of
 civil sanctions.   These nations would
 also be obligated to adopt immediate
 and effective measures to combat
 ^eligious prejudice.
 Quite obviously nations of the
 Communist Bloc will be reluctant to
 append their signatures to such a
 document, or if they do it certainly
 will be with a considerable amount of
 mental reservation.   During the next
 few months, therefore, assets should
 he encouraged to play up evidence of
 religious persecution and exploitation
 in Communist countries in an effort to
 throw as much light as possible on this
 unsavory aspect of life under Communism
 before the world community of nations
 votes on the issue.   Suitable back-
 ground material for this is carried
 regularly in PRESS COMMENT, and the
 latest in the series of BPG items in
 the series on "Communism vs. Religion"
 On 22 May a clandestine :radio
 broadcast was heard-in Denmark call-
 ing for donations for the Viet Cong
 and urging that demonstrations be
 held to protest against the visit of
 Secretary of State Rusk t:o Copenhagen
 15-16 June.   The broadcast also de-
 nounced Denmark's Socialist Govern-
 ment as "a faithful lackey of the
 capitalists."   (See BPG :[.tem #1043
 of 1.8 July 1966 for details of how
 the Communists were courting the
 Danish Social Democrats last year
 in the obvious ' l:iope , not since real--
 ized., of infiltrating the Government
 via the "popular front" strategy.)
 Sourcesquoted.by AP on the follow-
 ing day said the clandestine station
 is run by "extreme leftists" who say
 they w`_11 soon have a transmitter
 strong enough to reach all of Denmark.
 Danish authorities said, they would
 attempt to trace the transmitter and
 if it is located on Danish soil they
 will close it down since the law for-
 bids all radio stations except Govern-
 ment owned ones
 While the possibility exists that
 local activists of the Danish C.P. are
 operating a portable transmitter either
 inside the country or from a ship
 anchored offshore., there is also reason
 to believe that transmitters located
 in East Germany might be used for this

 the Communist clandestine radio "net-
 work" operates from transmitters
 in East Germany and elsewhere.)
 Assets may speculate on either loca-
 tion, but in any case should make
 the point that this is just one more
 piece of evidence that the Communists
 continually flaunt all types of
 international agreements (in this
 respect international broadcasting
 regulations) in their campaign to
 denigrate the United States and all
 Free World nations which support
 its policies in Vietnam.
 Professional   Communist and Free
 Meeting Con-   World Journalists
 verted Into    Debate in Europe_
 ideological
 Forum          A five-day so-called
 "international con-
 ference of European journalists" end-
 ed in the Italian resort of Lignano
 on 16 May. TASS reports that it was
 attended by some 120 delegates from
 Italy, France, West Germany, the
 Soviet Union, Bulgaria, East Ger-
 many, Poland, Rumania, Czechoslovakia,
 "and other countries".  Representatives
 of the Communist-front International
 Organization of Journalists, head-
 quartered in Prague, and its Free
 World counterpart, the Brussels-based
 International Federation of Journal-
 ists, met for the first time to dis-
 cuss such purely professional matters
 as salaries, social insurance, medical
 services, and information gathering.
 As to be expected in any such
 forum, however, the Communist dele-
 gates seized the opportunity to ex-
 pound their own political ideology
 and, as TASS put it, the professional
 discussions went beyond their "narrow
 framework and developed into a wide
 conversation about the future of
 Europe, European security, and Europ-
 ean unity."  The ensuing debates be-
 tween East and West representatives
 were marked, according to the TASS
 report, by a "spirit of mutual toler-
 ance" and highlighted by the remarks
 of the head of the Soviet delegation,
 IZVESTIYA Editor in Chief, L. N.
 Tolkunov, who said:
 "No one will deny that we have
 fundamental ideological differences,
 but the fact that they did not be-
 come a stumbling block in our contacts
 testifies to the high sense of res-
 ponsibility for the destinies of
 European and universal peace as shown
 in Lignano.  This proves that the
 all-European political barometer can
 indicate fair weather with more con-
 fidence and with less fluctuations
 and zigzags."
 In view of the fact that the
 conference set up working commissions
 to maintain contacts with journalists'
 organizations in various European
 countries the advice given in BPG
 Item #1126 of 22 May on the Inter-
 national Organization of Journalists
 becomes all the more timely, espec-
 ially since European media comment
 on the situation in Vietnam gets
 such worldwide play.   The TASS report
 notes that (unspecified) "major
 racial problems" were surfaced during
 the Lignano debates, but we can con-
 fidently predict that every Communist
 wile  -- or to use Comrade Tolkunov's
 word, "zigzag" -- will be employed
 henceforth to overcome these problems
 and infiltrate as many sectors of
 public opinion molding as possible.

 AVANTI (with translation) contain-
 ing some further details on the Lignano
 session, which apparently passed re:_a-
 tively unnoticed in the West European
 press.   Note that the Rome newspaper
 version, says the meeting heard a speech
 by Italian Minister of Tourism and
 Entertainment Corona on "the close
 correlation between tourism and the
 press."  A short news item in the 1E6
 May issue of Milan's CORRIERE DELLA
 SERA reported that the Lignano
 meeting had been organized by the
 Italian Press Federation and local
 enterprises in the overnight lodging
 business.   Selected assets might
 speculate that the tourism angle is
 not mentioned in the TASS report,
 perhaps among other reasons because
 of Communist sensitivities concerning
 their own tourists who have fled to the
 Free World while on foreign tours.
 Egypt       Use of Poison Gas Verified
 Bombs       by Red Cross Yemen-is
 With Gas    The International Committee
 of the Red Cross in Geneva
 issued on 2 June a press release,
 reporting that its delegates in Yemen
 had gone on 15 and 16 May to a vil-
 lage in northern Yemen, and had found
 there evidence indicating the use
 of asphyxiating poison bombing.
 Many inhabitants of the village had
 died of asphyxiation, and the Red
 Cross team had itself been delayed
 in reaching the site by an air attack
 (apparently not involving use of gas).
 There have been reports of use of
 poison gas in Yemen for some time,
 but this is the most authoritative
 and impartial. report to appear so
 far.   The Red Cross did not name the
 culprit government, but other reports
 make it clear that the Egyptian
 government bears the blame in this
 situation.   (For text of Red Cross:
 statement and other coverage, see
 PRESS COMMENT, 5 and 6 June 1967.)
 The report of the Red Cross did.
 not receive as much attention as it
 otherwise might have, due to its
 appearance just before the outbreak
 of Near Eastern Arab-Israeli hostili-
 ties, though West German and U.S.
 sales of gas masks to Isra.el were
 widely linked with this report.
 Where the situation permits and
 assets have not previously played
 the Red Cross and other reports, we
 recommend play on this subject.
 Egypt signed (in 1928) the
 Geneva protocol!- of 17 June 1925
 against the use of poison and asphyx-
 iating gases.   It also voted in
 November 1966 for a Hungarian-
 originated UN resolution outlawing
 the use of poison gas.   In the case
 of Yemen, unlike the use of gas in
 World War I,those attacked are inno-
 cent civilians, including women and
 children, not soldiers.

 1135 FE.                ASIAN REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   Europe's sensationally successful Common Market has put
 a new luster on the concept of'regional organizations.   Other brands of
 regional organizations -'political  military, etc. - have their parts
 to play at various stages of regional development, but eventually seem
 to be surpassed in impact and viability by effective economic organizations.
 Asia has no equivalent to the Common Market, nor indeed has it Europe's
 post-war remains of a developed industrial base and communications
 system.  However, despite Asia's diversity of races, culture, languages
 and economic development - a variety greater than that of any other
 continent - there are indications that Asia is able and even willing to
 work at regional cooperation.   In reviewing progress made along these
 lines in 1966, the conservative and influential TOKYO SHIMBUN told its
 1,600,000 daily readers that "1966 has been a year when awareness and
 confidence in Asia for the Asians germinated" citing as evidence the
 establishment of the 32-member billion-dollar Asian Development Bank',
 Japan's hosting of a regional economic conference, economic construc-
 tion in South Korea and Taiwan, etc.

 Quality and. Effectiveness
 Although military commentators usually term Soviet military equipment
 good, some of them are raising serious questions about the suitability of
 such equipment for Middle Eastern conditions.  For example it has been
 widely publicized that the Israelis modified their old World War II tanks
 by widening the tracks, raising the suspension, and increasing the fire-
 power by replacing the 9O-mm guns with 105-mm guns.  There is no indication
 that the Soviets made extensive modifications of their all-climate tanks
 in order to adapt them for desert warfare
 Analogous information tends to bear out the possibility that the
 Soviets were negligent in this regard.  For example, a recent article from
 Informations d'Outre-Mer (Paris, May 24, 1967) states:
 The motors with which the Soviet trucks of the Algerian Army are
 equipped are too fragile and consume too much fuel; moreover, it is
 difficult to use them in the Sahara.  For this reason, they will be

 Earlier, the Egyptians, when building the Aswan High Dam, found they
 had to replace large amounts of Soviet construction equipment (including
 caterpillar-type tractors) with British and American equipment.  Furthermore,
 there have been persistent reports that the Soviets have sent tractors and
 trucks to equatorial Africa with elaborate enclosures and heating facilities
 for the cabs.
 The age of the tanks supplied by the USSR is considered by some to
 have been a factor of possible significance in the poor performance of the
 UAR's tanks.  About half of them were Soviet World War II models, and thus
 manufactured between 1942 and 1917.  Considering the Soviets' generally
 poor record on the maintenance of all kinds of equipment, and the fact that
 the maintenance manuals for Soviet tanks were in English, it is not hard to
 understand that the Arabs would find it difficult to keep the tanks in
 operating condition.
 The matter of inadequate Soviet instruction in the use of equipment
 may have been a major factor in the inability of the Arabs to use the Soviet
 equipment effectively.  Publication of the manuals in English, a language
 foreign to Russian instructors and Arab trainees alike, undoubtedly resulted
 in inadequate understanding.  This is illustrated by the Soviet S.AM which
 was captured on the Sinai.  Besides instructions in Russian, the missiles
 had written on them in English, these words:  "By operating with plunger the
 drive should be engaged to reduction gear.  It is not allowed to operate
 with plunger at accelerated gear."'  Would any two people interpret these
 instructions the same way?  Not only were the manuals unclear, but frequently
 they were non-existent.  Often the equipment had to be repacked and kept
 in crates for months while the Arabs awaited the arrival of the manuals.
 Doctrinal and Tactical Training
 Very likely, the Soviets' military training of the Arabs will be found
 upon investigation to have been woefully inadequate and even misleading.
 By virtue of the differences in terrain between the USSR and the Middle
 East, the Soviet instructors probably had an inadequate'grasp of desert
 warfare.  But the Soviets' major short--.comings probably arose from a tend-
 ency to refer to their own military experience when instructing the Arabs.
 For example, the Egyptians dug pits for their T--54 Soviet tanks and
 were using them as stationary artillery to cover the town of Gaza in the
 early stages of the conflict.  Later, in the Sinai, the UAR troops again
 dug their tanks in in a vain effort to protect them against air bombardment.
 This tactic deprived the UAR tanks of mobility, the cardinal principle of
 tank warfare, while the Israeli tanks could freely manuever.  This tactic
 is similar to that used by Soviet tank forces in World War II, as shown in
 Soviet films of the war.  It is possible that the Soviet training officers
 prepared the Arab military for today's war by teaching them the successful
 tactics of yesterday's war.
 Furthermore, it has been pointed out that the conduct of the UAR mili-
 tary effort reflected Soviet tactical doctrine, which necessitates central

 direction.  This doctrine is considered ineffective against any foe which
 relies on the use of initiative.  Moreover, the UAR's situation may have
 been aggravated by communications which were inadequate to the desert con-
 ditions.
 A major oversight in the Soviets' preparation of the UAR may have been
 in the arrangement of the radar network.  Soviet tactics in antiaircraft
 warfare are focused -- almost exclusively -- on defense against assaults
 over land approaches.  This may explain the disastrous gap which the UAR
 left in its radar defense against an air assault from the direction of the
 Mediterranean.

 Soviet Trade and Aid
 In 1954 the USSR launched a trade and aid program in the developing
 countries* with the announced or evident intention of providing material
 needed for its own economy, expanding and increasing its influence world-
 wide, and reducing non-Communist influence in the developing countries.
 While the USSR's program embraces some 45 countries, it has concentrated
 on Asia and the Middle East, and about two thirds of its exports to develop-
 ing countries have gone to India, the UAR, Indonesia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The Communist countries, in gaining access to the markets of the
 developing countries, have used a classic commercial approach.   They offer-
 ed goods at lower prices and on more favorable terms (deferment of first
 payment; more years to pay; low interest rates).   They offered to trade
 industrial products for what would otherwise be surplus raw materials
 unsalable at an acceptable price in Western markets.   Furthermore, the
 Soviets dangled industrialization and economic independence in front of
 the leaders of the developing countries.
 Through 1966 the total amount of Communist credits and grants to
 developing countries was about $9 billion, of which the USSR accounted
 for roughly four fifths.   However, only about $3 billion, or one third,
 of the total amount has been put into effect; the balance remains to be
 drawn.    This large discrepancy actually between offers and drawings results
 mainly from typically prolonged construction schedules on foreign aid
 projects.
 The composition of the USSR's trade with developing countries is
 similar to that of other industrialized (or, in Soviet terms, "imperialist")
 countries.- even if the intent differs.  About 85% of its imports are
 comprised of raw materials and food.  The USSR's shipments of machinery
 and equipment and manufactured goods have made up about two-thirds of its
 exports to developing countries.
 The military part of the Soviet program is much less publicized
 in the recipient countries than is economic aid.   Nevertheless, the
 monetary value of military aid actually rendered is 12 to 2 times as
 much as the economic aid.   The emphasis on military aid to certain
 countries is much more pronounced; for example, in the UAR military aid
 had amounted to almost 3 times as much as economic aid, and in Syria to
 more than 4 times as much.  Almost half of the Communist military aid
 is provided to developing countries as outright grants or with discounts
 from the list price of the military hardware.
 *Developing countries  also called less developed, underdeveloped or emerging
 countries) include: All African countries except the Republic of South Africa;
 all Asian countries except Japan; most Latin American countries; Middle East-
 ern countries, including Cyprus, Greece, Syria, Turkey and the UAR.  Designa-
 tion as a developing country is based on a number of factors, including: per-
 sonal consumption per capita; per capita national product (gross national pro-
 duct, national income); share of labor force in agriculture.

 Benefits to the USSR:  The Kremlin's continued expanson since 1964 of
 aid agreements with developing countries clearly indicates that the
 Brezh.nev-Kosygin regime views the trade and aid program as a satisfac-
 tory means of obtaining raw materials and foodstuff useful to the
 Soviet economy and, more significantly, of pursuing Soviet foreign policy
 objectives.   Using economic means, the Soviet leaders evidently hope to
 continue to exploit the USSR's recently acquired or increased. presence
 in the developing countries by:
 --propagandizing its contributions of technology, skilled manpower,
 and materials;
 --gaining influence over economic planning and administration;
 --working to introduce Soviet methods and ideas to replace Western-
 inspired traditions;
 --increasing the developing countries' dependence on the USSR for
 credit, new machinery and equipment, spare parts, and technicians
 to operate new plants.
 Through military aid the Soviet leaders will undoubtedly continue to
 try to enhance the USSR's position as a supplier of arms and a trainer
 of the armed forces of developing countries.   The lure of low Soviet prices
 and quick delivery of military equipment is often irres:istable.  The
 acceptance of weapons results in the need to send trainees to the USSR
 and to receive military instructors from the USSR; furthermore, ammunition
 and spare parts need to be supplied on a continuing basis.   Thus, the
 acceptance of Soviet military aid is often a first step towards dependence
 on the USSR.
 The Soviet leaders have varied their approach to target countries.
 To gain a foothold in some countries (Eqypt, Iraq, Syria, Yemen) military
 aid was offered first.  More frequently, however, the initial agreement
 with a developing country is based on economic assistance.   The use of
 either approach has often been followed by the other, as indicated by the
 fact that about half the developing countries receiving economic aid
 from the USSR also receive military aid.   In combination, economic and
 military aid is a potent tool to increase the dependence of a. developing
 country on the USSR and other Bloc countries.
 The ultimate benefits the USSR hopes to derive from its aid program
 are political.   Support for Soviet policies in the UN by developing;
 countries, for example, has risen sharply since the launching of the
 Soviets' aid program in the mid-50's.  More important, the Soviets have
 thereby acquired greater contact and communication with leaders of the
 developing countries and have also built up their influence with large
 numbers of potential leaders who are now middle-rung officials or military
 officers.

 Drawbacks for the USSR:  Although the trade and aid program has so far
 absorbed only a very small share (according to one estimate .1%) of
 the Soviet economy's gross national product, it will require increasingly
 advanced industrial and military equipment during the next several years.
 Thus, instead of involving industrial equipment that is generally obsolescent
 or surplus to the USSR's needs, the Soviet export program will  -have to
 compete with domestic industrial programs for the relatively scarce tech-
 nologically-advanced equipment produced by the USSR.   Similarly, future
 shipments of military hardware will consist far less of surplus or discarded
 goods and more of the equipment being currently manufactured for the
 Soviet armed forces.
 A far more threatening drawback of the program, from the Kremlin's
 standpoint, is the possible adverse affect of unsatisfactory performance
 of Soviet aid commitments.   On the economic side, the Soviets' record is
 spotty and is marred by long delays in carrying out construction projects,
 the poor quality of industrial equipment and consumer goods, failure to
 supply enough spare parts of the needed sorts, and the glaring errors in
 the planning of industrial development.   The quality of Soviet military
 aid, for many years unassessed, now appears to be deficient to some ex-
 tent with respect to equipment and to be woefully low with respect to
 training in military tactics, use of weapons, and maintenance of equipment.
 (See attachment for details).
 On balance, the Soviet leaders probably view their trade and aid
 program as a commitment they couldn't avoid even if its costs should begin
 to outweigh the foreseeable benefits.   For a withdrawal in the face of
 adverse developments would compound their problem.
 Attractiveness to developing countries:   Soviet offers of trade and aid
 are hard for leaders of developing countries to resist.   The kind of
 goods offered--industrial and transport equipment, industrial materials
 such as steel and petroleum--in exchange for surplus raw material and
 food which can't be absorbed in Free World markets, appears to represent
 a clear-cut gain for the developing countries.   The deferment of initial
 payments and the stretch-out of the repayment of credits at 22 percent
 interest has added to the attractiveness of Soviet aid offers, especially
 prior to 1966.   Furthermore, Soviet prices usually seem to be low.   Finally,
 Soviet aid seems to offer leaders of developing countries a means of
 countering the economic influence of their traditional trading partners
 (usually the former colonial power).
 Military aid is usually even more attractively presented than economic
 aid.   Very little, if any, down payment is demanded.   The price of the
 equipment is reduced by almost half by means of discounts and outright
 grants.   The equipment can usually be shipped soon after ordered because
 of the large portion of Soviet merchant ships specializing almost exclusively
 in arms shipments.   Finally, comprehensive instruction is offered in the
 use of the military equipment, and in military doctrine.   Thus, leaders of
 developing countries have painted for them a picture of rapid development
 of a powerful military force with modern weapons and led by well-trained
 officers.

 Detractions of Soviet aid:   Soviet performance has tarnished the apparent
 attractiveness of Soviet economic arid. First, -the quality of Soviet
 goods usually does not meet what the Soviets term "world standards."
 This is particularly true of machinery and equipment used. in-production
 lines.   The machinery itself is usually outmoded, and thus the products
 of the machinery are also outmoded and cannot be sold at world market
 prices.   Second, the real cost of Soviet goods is nowhere near as low as
 the price tags indicate, when the poor quality is taken into account.
 Furthermore, Soviet-built plants are more expensive than their estimated
 cost because of the added expenses* incurred by the exceptionally long
 duration of construction.  (See below).  Third, the reliability of the USSR
 is open to serious question.  As a trading partner the USSR has not been
 dependable, in that it has attached post-agreement political conditions
 to its aid ( in spite of pretenses to the contrary) and. in that it has not
 been able to sustain its deliveries of commodities (for example, Soviet
 wheat was not available in the amount required. by developing countries
 after the poor Soviet harvests of 1963 and .1965).   The USSR, faced with
 budget problems at home, has trimmed some of the attractive features of
 its aid program; for example, in 1966 the Kremlin extended almost a
 billion dollars in aid, over 40% of which was in the form of commercial
 credits.   The significnace of this lies in the change from state credits
 (12 years at 21-2% interest) to commercial credits (5 to 10 years at up
 to 4% interest).  At the same time the Soviets increased their requirements
 of hard currency for down payments.   Developing countries have also mis-
 takenly relied on Soviet economic advice and, as a result, have committed
 themselves to courses of industrial. development not in keeping with their
 own economic realities.   The Soviets seem to have recognized their mis-
 takes in this regard, inasmuch as they now subject new projects to pro-
 tracted scrutiny before approving them; yet the Soviets still give no in-
 dication that they grasp the proven methods for establishing economic
 feasibility of industrial programs.
 Some of the most serious deficiencies in the Kremlin's aid program
 show up in the performance and quality of industrial construction projects.
 The time actually required for construction has exceeded the contracted
 duration by an average of more than a third, and has in some cases stretched
 out to double the contracted duration.  Furthermore, Soviet aid projects
 have taken much longer than comparable U.S. aid projects.   For example:   a
 Soviet aid fertilizer plant in Indonesia took 3 years longer than a U.S.
 aid project of the same kind in the same country; a Soviet aid oil refinery
 in India took 40 months to build, or 26 months longer than the construction
 of an oil refinery of almost the same capacity built under the U.S. aid
 program in South Korea.   The poor quality of Soviet construction has been
 transmitted to developing countries through the aid program; this is largely
 attributable to inferior designs of the structures and. inept supervision
 of construction.  Equally serious is the general backwardness of the
 industrial facilities the Soviets have provided.   For example, the !Soviets
 admit to themselves that their pharmaceutical industry lags far behind
 that industry in the West, yet the Soviets are building pharmaceutical
 -;The cost of Soviet "experts" sometimes amounts to up to a quarter of aid
 spendipg on a project.

 plants for developing countries under their aid program.   Similarly,
 Soviet fish canneries are obsolete by Western standards; still, the
 Soviets are sponsoring the construction of such plants under their aid
 program.
 Parenthetically, it should be borne in mind that showcase Soviet
 aid projects are of high quality.   For example, the Aswan High Dam on the
 Nile is a credit to Soviet engineering, even though the Egyptians found
 they had to replace Soviet heavy construction equipment with British and
 U.S. equipment.  Also, the Bhilai steel mill in India is one of the most
 modern in the world, so modern in fact that at the time of its construction
 the Bhilai plant had the very best of Soviet equipment, such as no single
 Soviet plant could equal..  The use of such modern equipment at Bhilai
 appears extravagant, however, when it is considered that it cost more and
 took almost twice as long to build Bhilai with a capacity of 1 million
 tons as the expansion of India's privately owned Tata steel mill with a
 capacity increase of up to 2 million tons.
 Until recently, Soviet military aid has been held in high regard
 by most developing countries.   Such a regard is considerably clouded,
 however, by preliminary assessments of the value of such aid to the UAR
 recently.   The Soviet-supplied equipment was not effective.   For example,
 almost half of the UAR's tanks were manufactured in the USSR between the
 middle of World War II and 1947.   There is no indication that the Soviets
 modified the tanks adequately for the particular rigors of desert warfare.
 The Soviet-supplied radar and anti-aircraft weapons, including expensive
 surface-to-air missiles (SAM's), failed to prevent the Israeli air force
 from making devastating attacks.   Also ineffective, apparently, was the
 Soviets' training of UAR officers in military doctrine and tactics.   It
 is reported, for example, that UAR tanks were dug in and used as stationary
 artillery; this violates the cardinal principle of modern armored warfare
 that mobility should be maximized.   This tactic used by the UAR's armored
 units is identical to the one used by Soviet forces in World War II, as
 portrayed in Soviet films of the war.   It is thus indicated that Soviet
 training officers may have tried to prepare the Arab military for today's
 war by teaching them the successful tactics of yesterday's war.
 Some conclusions concerning Soviet aid:   On the economic aid side, it is
 cltear that leaders of the developing countries were mistaken when they
 expected Soviet aid to benefit them substantially.   In the final analysis,
 the economic balance sheet may even show that the developing countries
 have had to pay a high price in terms of their own products and hard
 currency in exchange for goods and plants which they can't employ effectively.
 On the military aid side it may dawn on these same leaders ( as it un-
 doubtedly occurred tra the LIAR's Nassar) that the net result of Soviet aid
 has been their own false sense of confidence.

 Havana, 4 March--An exhaustive anti-imperialist sociological survey
 is being conducted in 27 Latin''American countries by the national commit-
 tees participating in the First Latin American Solidarity Organization
 (LASO) conference.  Jesus Maza Peruvian representative to LASO told the
 Cuban press:   "Above all, the questionnaire aims to ascertain the degree
 of awareness of the people's liberation struggle against imperialist
 domination."   He added that the questionnaire deals with six fundamental
 points and has been sent to outstanding figures, historians, researchers,
 sociologists, and progressive organizations on the American Continent.
 About 1,000 persons are working in Cuba on this survey with the partici-
 pation of organizations and institutes of the Revolutionary Government
 and under the guidance of the Communist Party.  Maza added that this
 LASO project is directed toward finding out the real situation in each
 country and measuring the extent of enemy infiltration of Latin American
 society.   He said that the data produced by this survey will contribute
 valuably to the first LASO conference "because there we will pool all
 experiences of the revolutionary struggle within the American Continent."

 Havana,Cuba
 2 June 1967
 The anti-imperialist delegations of the 27 Latin American nations attending
 the First Tricontinental Conference founded, on 16 January 1966, in Havana,
 Cuba, the Latin American Solidarity Organization (LASO).  Its aims, according
 to the constitution of the organization., are to ur+ite, coordinate, and give impetus
 to the struggle against North American imperialism by all the exploited peoples
 of Latin America.
 AALAPSO-..the Afro-Asian-Latin American Peoples Solidarity Organization--was created
 by the First Tricontinental Conference, while LSO was created by a special
 and exclusive meeting of the Latin American delegations participating in its
 debates.  They are two distinct organizations, utterly independent of each other.
 .There is no organic or functional subordination between them. .Sven though they'
 ,were born almost at the same time and place and established headquarters in the
 same country, they could have been born on distinct occasions and places, and
 could have established distinct headquarters.
 The international climate created by American imperialism's global strategy as
 well as that of other colonialist powers for the forceful domination of all the
 underdeveloped nations of the world, and the need of the underdeveloped, colonialized,
 and dependent nations to help each other effectively, to coordinate their efforts
 in the national, liberation struggle, to shore up the liberated nations, and to
 give a united reply to imperialist aggression and to defeat its aims, made the
 creation of the two organizations necessary and possible.  AALAPSO aims to unite,
 coordinate, and press forward the struggle against colonialism and imperialism in
 the sphere of three continents; LASO, in the sphere of a single continent--Latin
 America.  Hence, relations between the two are those of fraternal support and
 cooperation.
 On 16 January an organizing committee was designated including Brazil, Cuba,
 Colombia, Guyana, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  Its basic
 tasks are the orientation of the work of the new organization in cooperation
 'with the national committees of each nation and the organization of the first
 Latin American Peoples Solidarity Conference.
 The internal structure of the organizing committee is not based on permanent
 secretariats but rather on work groups whose life is only as long as necessary
 to complete assigned tasks; once completed, new groups are immediately staffed
 to implement new tasks.  Only the General Secretariat, ,a post filled by the
 representative of the Cuban national committee, Haydee Santamaria, and the work
 group for the LASO bulletin, are permanent.  The organizing committee holds
 weekly meetings to.approve, disapprove, or amend what is resolved by the work
 groups.  Unanimous resolution is the ever present aim, but if unanimity is
 impossible, a resolution may pass with a two-thirds majority.  So far, however,
 it has not been necessary to apply this rule for substantive resolutions.
 Among many other tasks, the organizing committee has accomplished the following:
 Early this year it revised the makeup of the national committees of the large
 majority of nations that comprise the organization, and consulted with them on the
 ;date of the conference, the criteria to be followed in constituting and revamping the
 national committees, agenda topics, and other proposals that they could make.  On
 this basis, the month of July 1967 was selected as the date for the first Latin
 ,American Peoples Solidarity Conference.  The draft agenda and rules for the--
 .conference, have already been prepared.

 cultural realities in the countries of the continent, a research which must be done
 by the national committees, within the limits of their potential, with the objective
 of contributing sufficient information to the conference for evaluation.  The
 national committees represent the most active anti-imperialist sectors with the
 deepest roots among the people in each of the Latin American countries.  They
 consist of one or more truly anti-imperialist, representative, unitarian organizationa
 accepting the general. declaration of the First Tricontinental Conference and the
 bases on which Laso was formed.  The starting point for the formation of each
 national committee was established by the international preparatory committee of
 the First Trioontinental Conference.  This in principle is the, way the national
 .committee of any one* country is formed by the organizatiots that were invited to
 ,participate in it.  However, some important organizations were not invited to the
 First Tricontinental Conference, and perhaps some others which did not meet entry
 requirements were invited.  It also happens that some political forces which were
 taken into account have disappeared and others may go the same route.  Some
 organizations--and there may be more in the future--merged, and new anti-imperialist
 movements with popular support have risen.  These realities have determined the
 dynamic character of the composition of the national committees.  No organization
 may belong in perpetuity to the national committee if it loses the qualities which
 .made possible its admission.  On the other hand, organizations acquiring those
 qualities must be admitted.   The national committees must always represent the most
 active anti-imperialist sectors, and those with the most profound and extensive roots
 among the people in each of the Latin American countries.
 The dynamic character of the national committees is also a characteristic of LASO
 and is its contribution to the international revolutionary institutions.  The first
 review of the national committees was carried out in accordance with this basic
 criterion.  Today their composition is determined by the results of that work
 and no longer only by the decisions of the international preparatory committee of
 the First Trioontinental Conference.  Every anti-imperialist organization aspiring
 to become part of the national committee of its country presents entry applications
 simultaneously to the pertinent national committee and to the LASO organizing
 committee.  In its application it indicates that it fulfills the requirements for
 admission.  Once it is received, the national committee sends its favorable or
 ,unfavorable decision, based on confirmation of entry requirements, to the organizing
 committee.  If the favorable decision on the new applicant is unanimous, the
 organizing committee, after also confirming the fulfillment of entry requirements,
 recognizes the integration of the new organization into the national committee.  If
 there is an objection, it makes a decision by itself.  In like manner, this
 procedure is followed when an organization is expelled which has lost the necessary
 qualities for belonging to a national committee.  This request must come from the
 organizations making up the national committee or from the  organizing committee
 itself.
 Rational committees consist basically of anti-imperialist political organizations
 since they are organizations which perform,'and will perform, political functions.
 However, in certain cases, mass organizations may belong to them when, in addition
 to fulfilling entry requirements, they bring in essential sectors of the population,
 contribute toward attracting new political forces to the national committee, and help
 to develop and consolidate the unifying work of the organizations that make it up.
 The fact that basically political organizations make up the national committees
 does not mean any restrictions  ri their work.  When they hold meetings, demonstrations,
 conferences, roundtables, when  hey publish something, and so forth, they act in the
 same manner as any regular political organization.  They take advantage of the
 influence each of them has in mass organizations to promote their work.  Campaigns
 of solidarity are convoked directly by the national committee, separately by each of

 the organizati  s in it, or by mass organization in whicu they have influence.  Like-
 w:i..^.e, they create committees of solidarity or other forms of organization to achieve
 their objectives, all in accordance with the existing situation of the anti-imperialist
 organizations in each country.
 ,The difference between the national committee and the organizations through which :.t
 performs its work is the some as that between the political organizations and'the
 mass organizations.  Organizationally the national committee is also flexible.  It
 functions, whenever possible, on the basis of periodic meetings of the delegates of
 the va -Lous organizations which make it up, but also when the situation of clandestine-
 ness or repression prevents organic functioning, it functions on the basis of contacts
 >or liaison with the memb:r organizations.
 The agreement on the foundatiot:.c?i LASO was adopted by the national committees of the
 following countries:   Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Chile,
 Ecuador, El Salvador, Guadaloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, French Guiana, Haiti, Honduras,
 Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico,
 ,Dominican Republic, Trinidad-Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  Surinam joined later.
 LASO and the national committees that make it up carry out, and must carry out in
 the future, an intensive campaign for the unity of anti-imperialist movements in
 .each"of our countries. They must prevent sectarianism from causing the havoc that is,
 known in Latin America and the proliferation of division among anti-imperialist
 organizations.
 With their practical activity they must instill the conviction that only the most
 determined unity will make the anti-imperialist movement in each country strong.  They
 must also demonstrate by their policy that only by uniting, coordinating, giving
 impetus to the anti-imperialist struggle in all Latin American countries, and giving
 each other support and solidarity, particularly to the people engaged in armed
 struggle, can an effective reply be made to the continental strategy of domination by
 .North American imperialism.  By knowing each other, helping each other, coordinating,
 and giving impetus to the scattered efforts in the anti-imperialist struggle, our
 people will find the path to victory.
 If the Latin American Solidarity Organization and the national committees that make
 it up advance in the fulfillment of these tasks, the future of our struggle.is a
 future of joint struggle and solidarity, a future of success for our present efforts.

 ALLEGED CONNECTION WITH "CONSPIRACY"
 Assets of Sheikh Habanakah and 45 Merchants Are
 Seized Under Order Of The Military   Governor

 Is "Opiate of People", Disagrees  With Official
 Line Atheistic Article W..s of CIA Making, Notes
 That W -iter of Article In Army W.:ekly "Sincere"
 The Syrian Government has declared the First and Second fe
 cretaries of the Saudi Embas&y in Damascus persona non grata
 and asked them to leave the country within 24 hours. They were
 accused of playing a role in the right-wing "?lot" which the Sy-
 rian Regime said it has crushed.  This was announced today by the
 state-run Damascus press.
 The Syrian newspapers, furthermore, reported that assets of
 Sheikh Hassan Habanakah, head of the Syrian League of Ulema
 now under arrest for anti-regime sermons and activity, and 45
 prominent merchants in Damascus have been seized by the state.
 The seizure was by order issued by the Syrian "Military Gov-
 ernor." t , proclamation by the Military Governor earlier char-
 ged the US, Jordanian and Saudi rulers of being behind L. plot
 against the.Syrian revolutionary regime. A Syrian army offic-
 er who has returned to e-'mman from Jordan, where he had def-
 ected last September, claimed in a radio and television inter-
 view that Habanakah was' agent in Damascus of Lt-Col. I-elim
 Hf.toum, the escaped Syrian officer said to be plotting a come-
 back to Syria from Jordan.  E.heikh Habanakah had earlier been
 accused of working for the Saudis, and sponsoring, inside Syria,
 King Feisal' s alleged bid to create an Islamic alliance.
 Sheikh Habanakah is now posed by the Lyrian regime as the sy-
 mbol of "reaction" in Syria. According to press reports from
 the Syrian capital,Habanakah was arrested last Friday after he

 delivered a sermon at the mosque of his quarter, Al Midan, in Damascus, in which he denounced the
 Baathist regime as "Godless."
 Although shops in other Damascus souks were forced open by the "Workers Militia", of the Fe-
 deration of Labour, shops at Al Midan remained closed yesterday.  Khalid Al Jundi, President of
 the Federation of Labour, declared in an interview with three foreign correspondents last   night
 that he had sent a warning to merchants and residents of the Al Midan quarter that if shops and wort
 shops did not open by 9 a.m. today men of the Workers Militia would reopen them by force.
 Workers Militia and N~_.tionLl Guardsmen had already reopened shuttered shops in the central
 town souks Sunday and yesterday, using sledge hammers to break padlocks, according to press re-
 ports this morning.
 "Opiate Of the People." Khalid Al Jundi, who, with his bderation of L...bour and Workers r
 tia, is symbol of the extremist faction of a regime already considered extreme by Arab standards,
 made rather interesting remarks in his interview with the three forei gn correspondents last night.
 He declared that he disc ;reed with the "belief" by some of the B. ath party leaders that the US Q nt-
 ral Intelligence Agency (CIA) was behind the atheistic article which had appeared in the military
 weekly, AL JAISH AL SHAABI --the article which had triggered off the current crisis in Syria.
 Jundi said that he rather thought the author had been sincere but that  the article had been publish-
 ed without any clearance with the Governmert.
 The author and editor of the magazine had been arxested and will be referred to trial.  The pro-
 clamation by the Military Governor Sunday night (see our bulletin yesterday) accused CIA of being
 behind the article.                                                       '
 Jundi, in the interview, indicated that he himself was an atheist.  He said that he adhered to
 Marxist doctrine that religion "is the opiate of the people."
 Jundi'  statements were an example of extremism that characterizes the present regime in Sy-
 ria, --although the other Baath leaders now in power may be milder.            In fact, Jundi, in the inter-
 view, said that he disagreed with the government "mildness" in dealing with the "counter-revolut-
 ionaries." He said that some blood-letting -"makes good revolutionary medicine", adding that he
 kind of hopes the strikers at Al Midan today would not respond to his call to open their shops, so
 strict measures could be applied against them.  He said that they must be shown that the revolution
 will brook no interference.
 No Neutralism.  Jundi declared that "neutralism" in the world struggle between socialism and
 capitalism meant a partial victory for reaction. Socialist Syria, he said, must be completely wed-
 !ded to the socialist       camp.  He said that the Ba. th Party doctrine of neutralism had been written
 by the right-wing leaders and founders of the Party, Michel Aflak and Salah Bitar, who were oust-
 ::ed in the mii(QIYlroomd FoPR?fease 12N0%0'8127 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060002-1

 Executions. Yesterday, the weekly AL ISHTIRAKI, which speaks for Jundi's F.:deration of La-
 bour, demanded in an editorial that reactionaries in Syria should be treated in the same manner
 Egypt had treated leaders of the Moslem Brotherhood, when they plotted against the regime of Pre-
 sident Nasser in 1965.
 Since three of the Brotherhood leaders were executed after a court found them guilty of conspi-
 racy against the regime, Beirut's independent right-wing AL JA RIDA , reproducing excerpts from
 A L ISHTIRA KI' s article, concluded that several right-wing Syrian leaders may be headed for exe-
 cution.  In fact, the pager's D~mascus correspondent reported that the Syrian authorities have pre-
 pared a list of persons who will be referred to trial and executed.
 Press Reports.  Newspapers here today continued to lead with Syrian developments, End carried
 various reports about what is allegedly happening there.  According to AL NAHi R, the Syriac Ca-
 thrlic and Greek Catholic bishops in D,:.mascus were released after questioning by the authorities,
 afWthat more than ten CLtholic clergymen in Damascus have been placed under house arrest. Also,
 there were reports that a number of Greek Orthodox clergymen were arrested in Hama after they ha
 tried to march in a demonstration with Moslem Ulema under Hama Is Mufti, ;,heikh Mohammed Al Ha-
 med.
 Both AL NAHAR and AL HAYAT reported that about 129 civil servants have been arrested for
 signing a note protesting against the atheistic article in AL JAISH AL SHAABI. The movement, AL
 NA HA R said, had spread to the northern town of Aleppo. The paper said that Aleppo citizens ment-
 ioned that the real reason for the call for strike in the city was not only because of the article in
 question but also due to the general discontent which had spread among merchants and businessmen
 because of the regime's' policies.
 AIL, HAYA T said that clashes took place between the demonstrators in Damascus and security
 men,and that Damascenes Sunday and t.aturday night heard explosions, which were said to have takes
 place near the head office of the Ruling Bath Party. AL HA YA T said that tanks and other military
 vF' `cles were sent to Damascus to try to keep order, and that Syrian leaders had been holding con-
 sc..rt meetings at the Baath Party headquarters.
 At its  meeting yest erday, the Syrian Council of Ministers, under Premier Dr Youssef Zayyen,
 .discussed whatt SANA , the Syrian official news agency, called "the conspiracies being prepared by
 imperialism and its agents in the area". The Council, the agency added, also discussed the "firm
 stand taken by the revolution to -crush the plot and liquidate the remnants of reaction."
 FIVE ESCAPE FROM JORDAN N. Meanwhile, A L NA HA R reported in a private dispatch from A m-
 man, that five Syrian army officers, who had defected to Jordan with Lt-Col. Hatoum, tried to es-
 cape to Syria last .`unday --but that only three made it.  The escapees exchanged fire with the Jor-
 danian border guards.  One was hit, and another captured.  The other three managed to cross into
 Syrian territory. [The three presumably include Hardan Al Zu'bi, the officer who appeared on Sy-
 rian television Sunday night to tell about H&.toum's alleged conspiracy against the Syrian regime --
