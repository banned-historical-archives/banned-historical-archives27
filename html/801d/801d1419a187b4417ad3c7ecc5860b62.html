 THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION OF
 THE LAO DONG PARTY OF VIET NAM
 1. INTRODUCTION
 1.   There is insufficient reliable information on hand to give a detailed
 picture o-f the actual organization of the Lao Dong or Labor Party, the Com-
 munist Party of Viet Nam.  What is contained herein is primarily the struc-
 ture of the Party as it is given in the Statutes.
 Z.   The Statutes of the Lao Dong Party, which were framed in 1951
 during the anti-French war in Indochina, are not absolutely comprehen-
 sive on organizational matters, and were probably so designed inten-
 tionally, to permit flexibility and growth. of the organization within the
 Communist framework which places all authority in the Party Center.
 The differences between the theoretical and actual state of organization
 of the Party are undoubtedly based upon the several "elastic clauses"
 of the Statutes, and are also due to the historical developments since
 the Statutes were written.  The actual general outlines and organiza-
 tional principles of the Lao Dong Party are fairly similar to those of
 other Communist parties, particularly the Chfinese Communist Party.
 Some portions of the Statutes, notably those concerning the duties of the
 Central Committee, and the organization of the basic party unit, greatly
 resemble parts of the constitutions and statib?s of other Communist parties,
 and are couched in typical Communist phrases.
 U.  PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIZATION
 3.   The Statutes of the Lao Dong Party provide for a pyramidal
 party structure based on the principle of "democratic centralism. "   This
 principle in the Lao Dong Party Statutes -- as in the regulations of other
 parties -- calls for a highly centralized and authoritarian structure, in
 which in actuality, the "democratic" aspects inevitably deteriorate to
 little more than mock congresses and elections.
 4.   The Lao Dong Party Statutes stipulate that the greatest execu-
 tive and administrative power at each echelon of party organization, above
 the party's basic organizational unit, is supposed to be exercised by a
 representative body composed of representatives elected by the party's
 -1-

 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 next lower echelon.  This body in turn theoretically elects a party com-
 mittee for that particular echelon, to wield the power at that echelon be-
 tween the regular sessions of the body which elected it.  The Statutes also
 state that all decisions and activities of party authorities at a particular
 organizational level, with the exception of the highest level, are to be
 subject to the directives and approval of party authorities at the next higher
 level.  Furthermore, the Lao Dong Party Statutes employ standard Com-
 munist terminology to. describe organizational components, such as "Cen-
 tral Committee", "Political Bureau, " and "basic party unit".  The organiza-
 tional framework described by the party Statutes is clearly modelled after
 that of other Communist parties and are not based upon indigenous politi-
 cal institutions.
 Comparison with the Party's defunct predecessor:
 chinese Communist Party
 The Indo-
 5.                             The organizational structure of the forerunner of the Lao Dong
 Party, the Indochinese Communist Party (IGP) is unknown.              Comparison
 between the two, and the determining of differences .if..any between the two
 is impossible.  However, French sources report that the framework of
 the Lao Dong Party differs from that created by the Statutes of the old
 Indochinese Communist Party in only two significant respects- -namely,
 that the Statutes of the older Warty made no: provision for a "Politburo"
 or a party Control Committee.  The powers which now seem to be pos-
 sessed by the "Politburo" of the Lao Dong Party apparently were exer-
 cised in the Indochinese Communist Party by a "Permanent Committee
 for Current Affairs" which was elected by the Central Committee.
 Power centers in the Party
 6.   Since the establishment of the Lao Dong Party in 1951, the actual
 party organization has become more authoritarian and personalized than
 the nominal structure specified in the Statutes..  The "representative
 bodies" at the various party echelons hav met very infrequently, and
 the preponderance of governing power within the Party has devolved into
 a hierarchy of party committees, headed by the Central Committee, the
 Politburo, and the Secretariat (whose existence is assumed but not
 certain).  The party committees at all party echelons generally have con-
 trolled the organization. and activities of the next lower echelon, for the
 higher echelon has the statutory responsibility of approving the selection
 of members of the party committee at the next lower echelon.  In practice,
 authority nominally residing in the party committee has sometimes become

 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 concentrated in smaller bodies or in individual leaders.  For example,
 -some large basic party units have been. headed, according to reports, by
 individuals instead of by committees as prescribed by the party Statutes.
 TlrStatutes require basic party units having more than nine members to
 have an elected party committee to administer the policy and programs of
 the  arty and unit.  Only small basic party units have the statutory right
 to omit the party committee and to elect only a secretary to head the unit.
 7.   Despite the highly centralized natiLre of the formal party struc-
 ture it probably has not as yet become as monolithic as desired by the
 top party, leaders, who openly desire to create an organization in Viet
 Nam with the monolithic characteristics of Communist parties in other
 countries.  Several instances of independent action by some local party
 leaders have occurred in the past years.  These incidents were probably
 caused by widespread guerrilla warfare and the inadequate communication
 facilities which prevented tight application of party discipline by the Center.
 Even before the beginning of large scale warfare in Indochina in 1946, .the
 Communist apparatus in South Viet Nam clearly enjoyed greater administra-
 tive autonomy than did the Communist structure in other regions of Viet
 Nam, and as recently as 19541 southernCommunist leaders' clearly voiced
 objections to the Geneva settlement showed a failure to quickly transmit
 the party line from the Party Center.  Whether any autonomy continues to
 exist among party organizations in the South is a vital question.
 8.   Although there is some evidence that the party chain of command
 in North Viet Nam is. not as yet as centralized as the .party leaders desire
 and proper party organizations would require, no inference should be made
 from this data that there is a lack of party unity.  It is true that there are
 visible party cliques of those leaders who were.associated with the Com-
 munist Party of China and those nurtured by the Communist Party of France,
 and potential sources for friction could derive from decisions on economic
 development or how to gain control of South Viet Nam.  However, such
 present divisions or future disputes should not be given too much weight.
 M.   TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE PARTY
 9.   Party structure has been constructed primarily upon a territorial
 basis, following the governmental administrative breakdown.
 10.  The actual structure of the Lao Dong Party is unknown.  The
 Statti.tes' indicate that the party is organized in a typical Communist manner,
 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 with the hierarchy developing in a pyramidal manner based upon the
 basic party organizational unit ("chi bo") which may be in. a village,
 industrial enterprise, neighborhood, or regiment.  The successive
 higher levels of party organization are-  the "district", "town:, and
 "precinct" (within a city); the "provincial" and "city" (special munici-
 pality) echelon; the "regional" or "zonal" (also 'referred to as "inter-
 zonal") level; and finally, the "central" or "national" level.  In ad-
 dition there may be party organizational units which are constituted
 outside of the regular organizational pattern, e. g. the Thai-Meo
 Autonomous Region, or South Viet Nam.  The specific relationship
 of such units to the regular party command is unknown.
 11.  The number or the location of the various organizational
 echelons of the party is unknown because of uncertainty as to the
 geographic subdivisions of the country.  There is confusion on the
 number of administrative organs for geographical units below the
 national level.  According to late reports the Communists have
 divided all of Viet Nam into ten "Zones" or "interzones" to indicate
 different administrative areas. 1
 1    The following is the list  of '"zones" and "interzones", based on the
 assumption that the two terms are interchangeable, with their general
 geographic locations:
 1.            Viet Bac Interzone; most of northeenViet Nam, from north
 of Hanoi to the China border.
 2. Interzone IV; most of the southern "Tonkin", and northern
 ""Annarn",. to the 17th parallel.
 3. Interzone III; the "Tonkin" Delta area on the northern bank
 of the Red River, less Hanoi and Haiphong,
 4. Red River - Left Bank.; the "Tonkin" Delta area on the southern
 bank of the Red River.
 5. Interzone V; most of "Annam" south of the 17th Parallel.
 6. Hanoi Special Zone; the city of Hanoi and the immediate environs.
 7. Haiphong Special Zone; the city of Haiphong and the immediate environs.
 8. Thai-Meo Autonomous Zone; Northwestern Viet Nam bordering on
 China and Laos.
 9. Hong Gay-Quang Yen Special Zone also called Hong-Quang Special Zone;
 a small area northeast of Haiphong.

 IV.   ORGANIZATION ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL
 12.  Very little reliable information is available concerning the actual
 composition and functions of the individual party echelons.  The important
 party offices are now located in Hanoi.  Before the armistice in Indochina
 in 1954, several major party agencies reportedly had headquarters in the
 town of Thai Nguyen, approximately 60 miles north of Hanoi.
 13.  As is found in the Statutes of other Communist parties, the
 Statutes of the Lao Dong Party name as the most important party bodies
 the National Party Congress, the National Party Conference, the Cen-
 tral Committee, the Political Bureau, and the office of the Secretary-
 General.                           A :French study, dated 1951, also names these bodies as the
 most influential bodies of the party.  In practice, the National Party
 Congress does not have the influence or power ascribed to it by the
 Statutes of the Lao Dong Party, and should not be included with the
 other named bodies as a body having real political power.
 National Party Congress
 14.   The actual role of the National Party Congress in the Lao Dong
 Party is much less. influential than its statutory powers.  Although the
 party Statutes call the National Party Congress "the highest directing
 organ of the party", it actually does little more than approve the policies
 formulated by the Central Committee or the Politburo.  Primarily, it
 provides a "democratic" facade to the policy making organs of the Party..
 15.  The National Party Congress is composed of representatives
 "'elected" by the regional or zonal party congresses, as well as a num-
 ber of members -- not exceeding one-half -- of the Central Committee,
 10. Nambo Interzone; all of "Cochin China".
 Some observers include the "Red River-Left Bank" as one of the zones
 in Interzone III.  These same observers do not believe that the Hanoi,
 Haiphong, and Hong Gay-Quang Yen Special Zones, and the Thai-Meo
 Autonomous Zone have a status equal to the other interzones,  Interzone
 IV and V, and the Viet Bac and Nambo Interzones are recognized and
 agreed upon by all observers.

 and a number of "official representatives" ""elected" by the Central Committee.
 In order to be a valid session, the National Party Congress must have, by
 statute, at least one half of the total party membership represented; and "more
 than one half the number of the regional, zonal and other party organizations
 subordinate to the Central Committee" must be represented.  Theoretically,
 the National Party Congress is empowered to elect regular and alternate
 members of the Central Committee, to approve all reports of that organ,
 and to make ultimate decisions on the policies and programs of the Party,
 as well as to make amendments to the party Statutes.  The National Party
 Congress has met only once, in November 1953, since the change in the party
 name in 1951.
 16.  By statute, the Central Committee retains a degree of control over
 the National Party Congress.  In addition to the "election" of a number of
 representatives, the Central Committee is empowered to postpone the
 meeting of the National Party Congress.  The Central Committee also
 determines the total number of representatives, and the method of
 election, to the National Party Congress, although the National Party
 Congress may be required to give nominal approval to such appointments
 when and if it meets,  Such has been the practice in many parties.
 National Party Conference
 17.  Another national representative body is provided for in the Statutes
 of the.rty.  Called, the "National Party Conference",' it is to be convoked
 by the Central Committee between sessions of the National Party Congress
 1    In addition to the single known session of the National Party Congress in
 November 1953, at least two. "National Congresses of Cadres" have been held
 by the Party, in April and July 1954.  The term "National Congress of Cadres"
 (translated from the French) is not used by other Communist parties.  However,
 the Lao Dong Party Statutes do state that a "cadre conference" may be con-
 voked by party committees ((presumably on all levels including the Central
 Committee) "when a general decision is needed either to. seek an opinion on
 fixedmatters or to collect dues and on general experience".  This suggests
 that the "National Congress of Cadres" is identical to the National Party
 Conference, a party meeting which exists in other parties and for which pro-
 vision is made in. the Lao Dong Party Statutes.  In China, the National Party
 Conference of the Chinese Communist Party has met several times since 1945,
 but the meeting  of the National Party Congress. of the Chinese Communist
 Party scheduled for late 1956 is the first such meeting since 1945.

 in order to debate and decide matters of party policy.  Its functions are
 somewhat restricted in comparison to the National Party Congress.  Con-
 trol of the National Party Conference is tightly held by the Central Com-
 mittee, for it determines the total number of representatives participa-
 ting, and under statutory requirement, is required to approve all decisions
 of the National Party Conference.  This last item points up in particular
 the difference between the National Party Congress and the National Party
 Conference in theory and in fact.  As stated in the Statutes, the National
 Party Congress "examines and approves all reports of the previous Central
 Committee", whereas "all decisions of the National Party Conference must
 be approved by the Central. Committee".  In the practice of other Communist
 parties, the National Party Conference (being smaller and composed primarily
 of senior cadres) is easier to. control than the National Party Congress.
 Central Committee
 18.  The Central Committee (CC) of the Lao Dong Party is theoretically
 a very influential party body.  According to the party Statutes, the CC is
 the "organ of highest authority" in the Party between sessions of the National
 Party Congress.  The actual powers, however, seem to reside more in the
 spheres of ratifying plans, issuing broad policy directives, sand formal. liaison
 with the formal government structure and with other non-party centers of
 power vai:n::theregime, rather than in the executive direction of. day-to-day
 party affairs.  The party Statutes invest the CC with several important powers
 including ratification of the decisions of the National Party Conference, super-
 vision of "all activities of the party within the national domain", enforcement.;
 of the party stattltes and policies, and the election of the Secretariat, the
 Secretary-General, the- Politburo, the Central Control Committee, and the
 members of the party's central departments.  Nevertheless, no reliable
 information is available concerning the actual extent to which the Central
 Committee exercises its statutory powers.  Probably, the Central Com-
 mittee exercises its powers in a nominal manner only, by receiving and
 perfunctorily approving    periodic reports from the other policy organs of
 the Party.  Such is the practice in many Communist parties.  Although the -
 Central Committee is a national party organ. and all directives for the Party
 are issued in its name, the actual power it exercises is limited.  It is
 primarily a "rubber stamp" group, since it does not have the real ability
 to discuss and question party policy and practice with any hope of modifica-
 tion, or change.  Although Ho Chi Minh, Truong Chinh, and the several

 and authority of the Central Committee is diluted by the probable inclusion of
 aged long-time party members and other party members given Central Com-
 mittee membership as a reward for their services.  This pattern of Central
 Committee composition is in the Chinese Communist Party pattern.
 19. Party Statutes decree the holding of ordinary meetings of the
 Central Committee once every six months.  Party pronouncements have
 claimed that there have been eight meetings of the CC since the formal
 establishment of the Party in March 1951. However, these meetings have
 not been held at the required six-month intervals.  Apparently, however,
 the CC of the Lao Dong Party has met more often than the Central Com-
 mittees of many other Communist parties in Asia, including the Indochinese
 Communist Party.  The Central Committee of the latter organization re-
 portedly convened only eight times in .the eleven-year period from 1930 to
 May 1941.
 20.  The Central Committee consists of 25 to 30 members of whom
 17 to 19 are probably regular members, with the remaining number  being
 alternate members.' The membership of a Central Committee usually repre-
 sents a diversity of talents and backgrounds, and includes some party leaders
 who evidently serve in a planning capacity, and some party leaders who are
 employed mainly in an operational role.  It is probably composed of both
 military men and civilians.2
 21.  In the past, detailed national programs for North Viet Nam have
 been issued in the name of the Central Committee of the Lao Dong Party,
 and have presaged action by the government machinery.  The Agrarian
 Reform Movement, and the formation of the Thai-Meo Autonomous , Legion
 are examples.  In these instances, party announcements apparentlypre-
 ceded action by the Government of North Viet Nam,
 1    The actual size and membership of the Central Committee is unknown.
 The figure given is based on what has been accepted by several other intel-
 ligence services as to its size.
 2    Leading army officers are often included on the various party committees,
 up to and including the Central Committee. This is the usual pattern for Com-
 munist parties in an "armed struggle" status.  Under Communist doctrine,
 military activities are dictated by political purposes as well as by military

 Political Bureau (Politburo)
 22.  The "Politburo" appears to be the most powerful office within
 the Lao Dong Party, if such power reckons in both policy formulation
 and direction of party activities.  However, practically no information
 about any organizational aspect of the "Politburo" is available.   Occasional
 radio broadcasts from North Viet Nam during 1955 identified a prominent
 party leader as being a member of the "Politburo. "  The party Statutes
 merely state that the "Politburo" holds the highest power in the Lao Dong
 Party between sessions of the Central Committee, and that the "Politburo",
 together with the Central Committee, has the authority to regulate party
 affairs.  The Central Committee possesses the statutory power to elect
 to and fill vacancies on the Politburo.  However, the Politburo itself, as
 the source of power, can, in fact, fill its own vacancies and have those
 appointments approved as a matter of course by the Central Committee.
 Official American sources in Saigon conjectured in 1951 that the "Politburo"
 had nine members, although a French study in that year claimed that there
 were only six members of that body.      The American sources in question
 mentioned the following names as possibly being members of the "Polit-
 buro", Ho Chi Minh, Truong Chinh, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap,
 Le Duan, Le Duc Tho, Hoang Quoc Viet, Nguyen Chi Thanh, and Nguyen
 Luong Bang.  The French study omitted the names of Ho Chi Minh and
 Nguyen Luong Bang from this list and stated that either Le Duan or Le
 Duc Tho -- but not both men -- were possibly members of the "Politburo".
 23.  Presumably the Politburo is composed in the Communist pattern,
 of the leading figures off' the Party, and in size is between the Central
 Committee and the Secretariat.  Although there have been- several esti-
 mates as to the size and composition of the Politburo, Hoang Quoc Viet
 has been the sole member of the body who has been officially acknowl-
 edged as such.  It is probable that several of the following, if not all, are
 on the Politburo:  Ho Chi Minh, Truong Chinh, Ton Duc Thang, PhamVan
 Dong, and Vo Nguyen Giap.
 requirements. Consequently, a military personage in the l rty must be
 cognizant of the political policies of the Party.  A notable examples is
 Chu Teh, who is the senior military man in China, next to MaoTse-tung,
 and has always been a member of the highest party organs.  Mao Tse-tung
 and Ho Chi-minh th-emselves are examples which illustrate how the same
 individual dictates military and party policies in, a resistance period.

 24. The Secretariat of the Lao Dong Partyl is provided for in the
 Statutes of the Lao Dong Party, and is theoretically responsible for the
 as m nistration of party matters.  As stated in the -Statutes, the Secretariat
 is charged with the responsibility for "everyday work according to the
 decisions of the Central Committee and the Politburo".  Presumably
 Truong Chinh, Secretary-General of the Party since its founding, heads
 the Secretariat.
 25.  The Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party assigns similar
 working functions to its Secretariat, stating that it "attends to the daily
 work of the Central Committee, according to the decisions of the Polit-
 buro".                           The composition of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist
 Party indicates that it has a high-level policy function, being composed
 of the five most influential members of the Party; Mao Tse-tung, Liu
 Shao-chi, Chou En-lai, Chu Teh, and Chen Yun
 26.  In the Lao Dong Party of Viet Nam, the existence of the Sec-
 retariat, its composition and its methods of functioning, have never
 been verified.
 V.   DEPARTMENTS OF. THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
 27.  There are undoubtedly other national organs in the Lao Dong
 Party which function under the Central Committee of the Party.  The
 Statutes of the party provides the Central Committee with "the authority
 to'organize subsidiary auxiliary groups such as a Propaganda Committee,
 and Economic and Financial Committee, etc. "  These Committees are in
 addition to the other central party organs elected by the Central Committee;
 the Politburo, the Secretariat, the Secretary General, and the Central
 Control Committee, and (in what may have been a temporary wartime
 provision) "Central Administrations to supervise distant regions".
 l    This office has on occasion been incorrectly translated, from the
 French "secretaire particulier", as "private secretary".

 28. Organs of the Central Committee of thellarty appear to
 be organized on two different bases; organs like the Political Bureau
 which are concerned with overall party policy matters; and the
 second type like the Propaganda Committee which are organized on
 a more functional basis.  The functional groups, and they are only
 assumed to exist, are probably headed by senior specialist cadres
 and are undoubtedly responsible for the planning, implementation
 and administration of party policies and party programs as formu-
 lated and developed by the party's policy organs.  If they do exist,
 the functional type of central party groups, although organized by
 the Central Committee of the Party, are probably subordinate and
 directly responsible to the Secretary-General and the Secretariat
 of the Party.  Similar functional type bodies are probably organized
 on the lesser party levels, and function within their particular
 jurisdictions in a manner similar to the central organs.  It is
 not known if any of the functional type central organs of the Party
 do actually exist.  On the lesser levels them: have been reparts that
 some of the party's administrative jurisdictions have organized
 such bodies as the "Propaganda Committee!', "Finance Committee",
 etc.
 A Comparison with the Communist Parties of China
 and Indonesia
 29.       Two other major Communist parties of the area, the
 Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Communist Party of Indo-
 nesia (PKI) do not have exactly the same central departments of the
 functional type.  In the Chinese Communist Party, these central
 bodies are:  Organization Department; Propaganda Department; United
 Front Work Department; Central Control Committee; Rural Work De-
 partment; Marx-Lenin Institute; the Editorial and Translation Bureau
 of the Works of Marx, Lenin, Engels, and Stalin; and possibly the
 Social Affairs Department.  In Indonesia, the central departments
 are:  Organization Department; Agit/Prop Department; Youth De-
 partment; Women's Department; Labor Department; Peasants De-
 partment; Peace Department; Department of Parliamentary Repre-
 sentation; Department of National Economy; and the Department of
 Science and Culture.  As can be seen, only two departments, the
 "Organization Department!" and the "Propaganda Department" (called
 the "Agit/Prop Department" in the PKI) appear in the two parties.

 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 30.  The differences in the number and functions of the central de-
 partnnerts in the two partiesaie due to their different situations.  The PKI
 is legal, overt, and a party seeking power.  The Chinese . C ommunist
 Party is a Party which has held national political power for seven years.
 31.  Formal party regulations militate against direct liaison of a
 Central Committee department with its counterpart on a lower level.
 As a logical feature of the basic principle of centralized control of the
 party organization, the proper channel of communication between two
 such specialized organs, at least on paper, is through the party secre-
 tary, or the party committee, is responsible for party activities on each
 level..  They appoint the members of the various functional committees
 and are solely responsible for their work.
 Propaganda Committee
 32.       The functions of a "Propaganda Committee" if it exists, are
 implied in its title.  Such a committee on the national level would be
 responsible for the selection of appropriate propaganda themes, and
 media to be employed, the organization and direction of party schools
 and training courses for the indoctrination and training of party mem-
 bers and cadres. The work of this type of a committee at all lower
 party levels would be the responsibility of the individual party committee
 with the overall direction and guidance emanating from the central
 department.
 33.  Almost no information is available about the Committee on
 Economic and Financial Affairs.  A French study of 1951 surmised that
 this committee supervised the establishment and maintenance of a
 financial system within the Party and of safeguarding Party funds, and
 conducts inspections of governmental projects affecting party finances,
 such as agrarian reform, creation of cooperatives, and tax collections.
 "Committee. of Party Affairs"
 34.       The organ which French sources term the "Committee of Party
 Affairs" appears identical with what is usually called the "Organization
 Department" in Communist parties.  In. North Viet Nam, this committee
 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 was reported to have primary administrative jurisdiction over all matters
 of party organization and administration.  It also reportedly supervises the
 establishment of, and changes in, all organizational components of the
 'arty, maintains dossiers on all. party members, transmits the party"line"
 throughout all party echelons, and checks on the holding of sessions of
 criticism and self-criticism by all party units.  In North Viet Nam in 1951.
 similar party organs were reported active at the national, interzone, zone,
 and provincial levels.
 Central Militar  Committee
 35,    The Central Military Committee of the Party was a very important
 body in 1951, according to French sources, and it may exist today although
 the Chinese experience suggests its functions may become governmentalized
 now that the Party is in power.  In 1951, the Central Military Committee
 advised the Central Committee of the Lao Dong Party on military strategy
 and other military matters.  Members of the Central Military Committee
 were appointed by the Central Committee.  In that year the Central Mili-
 tary Committee was said to have been headed by Vo Nguyen Giap, the
 commanding general, of the "Vietnam Peoples Army.
 Central Control. Committee
 36.    The control committe-es-at the variou-s party levels are deemed
 to be of sufficient importance to have a. chapter of the party Statutes as-
 signed to them.  According to these Statutes, the Central Control Com-
 mittee is appointed by the Central Committee; and members of the control
 committees on the lower party echelons are elected by the local party
 committees, and must be approved by the next higher party committee.
 37a  In 1951, the Central Control Committee was reported to be
 vested with major responsibility for observing the deportment of party
 members, for administering punishments for breaches of party dis'cim
 pline, and for hearing appeals from punished party members.  This is
 in accord with practice in other parties; the control committees are
 charged with insuring the orthodoxy and loyalty of party members
 Other reported functions of control committees at the various echelons
 included investigations of the work methods -- and presumably also
 of the efficiency m? of party members, of aiding party committees in
 establishing controls over subordinate party units, and to maintain an
 audit of party funds.  It may also have responsibility for some clandes-
 tine functions.

 38. In view of their responsibilities and functions, the line of command
 for the various echelons of the control committees is unclear, although dir-
 ection is assumed to be tightly held at the national level.  It is likely that
 the control committees forma line of command parallel to but independent
 of the regular party command structure, terminating in the Central Con-
 trol Committee.  The Central Control Committee in most Communist
 parties is responsible -- on paper at least -- to the Central Committee
 and is more important than other departments of the CC.
 Other reported committees
 39.  In addition to the above party organs, the French have also
 reported, in their 1952 study of the Lao Dong Party, that there were in
 existence in 1951 a "Committee on Current Affairs" and a number of
 what the French called "technical committees".  The functions and
 responsibilities of these groups as described by the French, indicate
 that they were at least in, part, similar to or identical with some of the
 Lao Dong Party central organs described above.
 VI.  PARTY ORGANIZATIONS BELOW THE NATIONAL LEVEL
 Zonal Level
 40.                      At -p-r- sent, there is an absence of specific details on the
 organization of the Party on the level. of the "regions" or "zone".  To
 judge by the Statutes and scattered intelligence reports, the party
 organization on these lower levels bears a general resemblance to
 the party organization on the central level.  The Statutes of the Lao
 Dong Party provide that the highest authority of the "region" or "zone"
 is held by the "Zonal Party Congress.-, which is composed of "elected"
 representatives of lesser party elements.     The Zonal Party Congresses
 are required by party statute to meet each eighteen. months, but like
 all of the various party congresses, from the lowest level to the
 national level, they have met less frequently than ostensibly required.
 In general, the Zonal. Party Congress, like the other party congresses
 on the various levels, possesses little actual power in the affairs of
 the Party.
 41.  One of the principal functions of the Zonal Party Congress is
 to elect a Zonal Party Committee which for the particular area resembles
 the Central Committee.  By party statute, the Zonal. Party Committee is
 "the organ of highest authority" between sessions of the Zonal Party Congress.
 Approved For Release : CI -     8-00915R000400450005-3
 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 The Zonal Party Congress also elects the delegation to the National
 Party Congress as required.  A "Secretary" and a "Standing Committee"
 are in turn elected by the Zonal Party Committee to administer the
 party activities for the particular area.  Although the Statutes assign
 major party responsibilities to the Zonal Party Congress, it is actually
 the Secretary who is the leading party power figure for a particular area.
 42.  On the lower party levels, from the basic party unit to the
 provincial party unit, the Party Statutes outline an organizational pat-
 tern similar in most respects to w at exists on the Zonal level..  The
 representative body -- the "congress"    of all elements of the party
 organizations above the basic party unit theoretically holds the highest
 authority for the particular echelon.  Each representative body "elects"
 the party committee for the particular party unit.  The party committee
 in turn "elects" a "Secretary" and a "Standing Committee'.' to administer
 the party affairs of the unit.
 43.  The size of the party committee on all levels is, according
 to the Statutes, determined by the "congress" of the particular echelon
 "in accor an.ce with the general decisions of the higher echelon".  The
 size of the party committee on different echelons may vary, as may
 the size of the party committees within the same level.  Normally,
 the party committee would include the leading party cadre of the area.
 44.  Largely because of sweeping changes in administrative
 boundaries in Viet Nam on both sides of the l.7th Parallel since the
 1956 Geneva Conference, information is not available about the
 exact number of provincial and municipal headquarters within the
 party structure.  It seems likely, nevertheless, that there are
 approximately 40 to 80 provincial units and three to five municipal
 apparatuses of the party.  There traditionally have been about 67
 provinces in all of Viet Nam but the party evidently does not have
 headquarters in some mountainous provinces, and. has apparently
 1    The number of provincial and special municipal units is- derived
 from an estimate of the number of such governmental administrative
 units.  The exact number of provincial, and municipal apparatuses organized
 by either the party or the government is unknown.  Within the Lao Dong
 party the special municipal .. units may have status equivalent to that
 of a province.

 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 consolidated several others for purposes of administration.  The
 governmental decree of April 1955 which formally established the
 "Thai-Meo Autonomous Area" out of two previously-existing prov-
 inces and portions of two other provinces in northwestern 'Viet Nam
 did not provide for a provincial organizational scheme within tls
 "Autonomous Area", and, presumably, party organization parallels
 governmental organization in this instance.  The party probably
 grants special municipality status to Hanoi, Haiphong and Saigon-
 Cholon.
 45.  Party organization at the provincial and municipal level
 is particularly significant from an operational viewpoint.  To judge
 from fragmentary reports a large number of party cadres seem to
 be employed on this level.1  Also many documents supposedly captured
 during the Indochinese war are detailed operational documents for this
 level.  Many members of the various provincial and municipal party
 committees concurrently with their party positions, hold active positions
 in non-party organizations, such as the formal Government of North
 Viet Nam, or the mass organizations such as the key Fatherland Front.
 For example, the Secretary of the party committee in Kien An Province
 in North Viet Nam in 1954 was also reported to be simultaneously serving
 as the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Lien Viet Front for
 the province.  This interlocking of party position and governmental or
 mass organization within a facade of "democracy" is more sharply
 shown in, China. In that country the provincial party chairman is, in
 the great majority of cases, the chairman of either the provincial
 government or its "people's congress".
 Lower Party Levels
 46.  The statutory provisions for party organizations at the level
 of the province, city, town or city preci.rct, closely resemble each other,
 The Statutes state that the various party committees are to. be elected
 1    The concentration of party cadres on the lower party levels is pre-
 sumably the practical application of the well-known Communist principle
 of maintaining close contact with the "masses", for the party knows that
 the work of the Party is done at the "grass roots".  For example, the
 party cadre has been instructed to take the lead in implementing govern-
 mental programs, e.g. agrarian "reform''.

 directly by the party congress of that level., convened at varying
 statutory intervals.  Once again, the party committee of the province,
 city, town or city precinct theoretically exercises the greatest execu-
 tive and administrative powers in the particular territorial jurisdiction.
 Some districts appear to have fairly elaborately organized party struc-
 tures.  For example, a district in Kien An Province in 1954 had a
 secretary, a six-man party committee, a secretariat, and functional
 committees for Party Affairs, and for Propaganda and Training.
 VII. BASIC PARTY ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS
 47. The organization -of a basic party organizational unit evidently
 depends on its size.  According to the Party Statutes, units of less than,
 nine regular members are;supposed to be headed only by a "secretary"
 and possibly a "deputy secretary", while larger units are theoretically
 directed by a party committee of three to seven members, as well as
 a secretary and deputy secretary.  The full unit membership is supposed
 to elect a party committee and/or secretary.  From reports it appears
 that the majority of basic party units have party committees.
 48. A basic party unit can be organized, according to the Statutes,
 in any locality where a minimum of three party members are sufficiently
 close to each other to hold meetings, such as in. a commercial enter-
 prise, school, or village, and where the necessary approval of higher
 party authorities is obtained.  In some areas where party members are
 numerous, the basic party unit may be divided into sub-units and placed
 under the direction of a sub-unit leader.  In such cases, the sub-unit
 and the sub-unit leader remains responsible to the basic party organiza-
 tional unit.  Each basic party unit is supposed to hold plenary sessions
 once a month to hear reports on the progress of its party missions, to
 deliberate on directives from higher party levels, to fix new goals and
 to allocate new tasks, and to decide on the admission of new members.
 Party Statutes decree that the membership of basic party units in a
 commercial enterprise should not exceed seventy members, while in
 a town, or city precinct, the total membership of a basic party unit
 should not exceed fifty.  There is no xeliable evidence about the total
 number of basic party units and it is undoubtedly constantly changing.
 It has been repeatedly stated, and recently reemphasized, that the
 basic party units in rural areas are the backbone of the Lao Dong Party
 in Viet Nam, a position similar to that taken by the Chinese Communist
 Party and the Communist Party of Indonesia.

 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3
 49.   The basic party units are vested by the party Statutes with
 the following responsibilities:
 a) execution of instructions of higher party authorities;
 b) attempts to popularize policies and programs of the
 party and the formal governments;
 c) direction of the populace in the fulfillment of these
 policies and programs;
 d) assignment of tasks to members, and supervision of
 their works;
 e) education and indoctrination of members;
 f) recruitment of new members;
 g)
 enforcement of party discipline and administering
 punishment for breaches of discipline;
 h) collection of party dues and fees; and
 i) sending regular reports on the current situation to
 higher party authorities.
 One intelligence report in 1954 stated that all party units in Bao Lieu
 Province were under orders to hold collective study sessions once every
 two weeks, and to carry on frequent sessions of criticisms and self-
 criticism.  This is a Communist method for the training and indoctrina-
 tion of party members.
 VIII,  QTHER ORGANIZ iTIONAL ELEMENTS
 50. Another organizational element of the Lao Dong Party is the
 party "fraction" in "mass" organizations.  An organized group of party
 members, the fraction is present in labor unions, elements of the
 North Vietnamese' Army, organs of the Government of North Viet Nam,
 and in "mass" organizations.  The fraction is utilized to propagate and
 enforce the party program and party decisions, and   to increase the
 strength and influence of the party" within the particular organization.
 Fra-coons may be organized at any echelon of the "mass" organization
 by the party committee for- that echelon.

 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000400450005-3.
 51. For strictly party administrative purposes., the members of
 the. fraction remain responsible to a regularly constituted basic party
 unit; but for activities within the "mass" organization, the fraction
 is directed and supervised by the party committee that formed it.
 Fractions may maintain liaison with, other party fractions at higher,
 lower, or equal levels,  to exchange opinions, experiences and special
 material".
 "Committees of Cadres"
 52, There also seems to be some components of the Lao Dong
 Party which do not have a clearly defined party status.  Some pre-1954
 intelligence reports have noted the existence of "Committees of Cadres"
 which apparently have been few in number, but which according to reports
 have served as party committees for party units in Cambodia and Laos.
 It may be that these "Committees of Cadres" have referred to meetings
 of a local version of the National Party Conference, or to a party com-
 mittee directing party activities in these two neighboring countries.
 11
 Autonomous:. sections
 53. A Lao Dong Party document and some intelligence reports refer
 to what appears to be a special category of basic party units, the "autono-
 mous section".  These small units, consisting of three to five highly
 trained and reliable party members, seem to have tenuous contact with
 the regular party hierarchy.  In past years, before 1954, "autonomous
 sections" were reportedly used most often in remote and "enemy occupied"
 regions..
 54.  The exact nature and functions of an "autonomous section" are
 unknown.   It seems logical that it was a wartime innovation used by the
 Lao .bong Party when communications between widely dispersed units
 and higher party echelons were difficult.  There are provisions in the
 Statutes of the Lao Dong Party for the organizing of party units in
 zT       ttemporarily occupied by the enemy". In such cases, when "the
 party cannot carry out its activities openly", the Central Committee of
 the party determines "the methods and system of organization" of the
 party units.

 L
 DIAGRAMS OF THE LAO DONG PARTY OF VIET NAM
 1.  The purpose of this section of the paper is to outline the
 national organization of the Lao Dong Party of North Viet Nam.  As
 the reorganization of the now defunct Indochinese Communist Party,
 the Lao. Dong Party is the political party in Viet Nam which .repre-
 sents the Communist movement in that country, it is the Party in,
 power in the Government of North Viet Nam in. which the final and
 absolute power of the country resides.  As in other Communist coun-
 tries, the Government of North. Viet Nam exists as a facade for the
 Lao Dong Party, through which the Communist program is implemented
 and through which the centralized Communist party extends and con-
 solidates its control over the country and the inhabitants.
 2.   This paper is limited to the identification. of the organs of
 the Party that exists on the national level; it is in the national echelon
 that the party power resides, as a result of the centralized power
 structure of Communist parties.  The Statutes of the Lao Dong Party
 confirms this seat of power, under the Communist doctrine of
 "Democratic Centralism".
 3.   Information on the "national"(also called "central") organs of
 the Lao Dong Party is fragmentary and scanty.  Much of the available
 information on the subject cannot be accepted as being definitive or
 completely reliable;
 4.   A diagram of the party's. highest organizational level can
 be drawn on the basis of., material in the 1951 Statutes of the Lao Dong
 Party, but the result is a very elementary, and undoubtedly incomplete,
 diagram. of...what actually exists at the present.  French intelligence
 -sources in 1951 indicated a wider organization on the national level,
 with several central organs in addition to those specified in the party's
 Statutes:  Confirmatory evidence, or information. on the source or
 access to such information is not available, preventing substantive
 evaluation of the French report.  In addition, much of the French ver-
 sion of the structure of the central echelon of the Lao Dong Party is

 5. The above does not necessarily imply that the accuracy or
 authenticity of the French information is in question.  It is recognized
 that due to the history of the Communist movement in Viet Nam, the
 organization of the Lao Dong Party may have developed a bit different
 from what developed in Communist parties in other countries.  The Lao
 Dong Party is still in the process of formalizing its organizational structure
 in the country, particularly since coming to power in North Viet Nam in 1954.
 However, differences due to local requirements do not usually result in
 such marked differences in the organizational pattern of Communist parties
 as the French suggest.  Rather, the organization of a Communist party is
 quite stylized, with the form depending on the status of the Communist move.-
 ment in the particular country.
 6.   In Figure 1 of this paper, the structural diagram of the organs
 of a "model Communist party" is presented.  As shown, the diagram is
 one of basic design, and is presented as the form "to which most partied
 aspire and to which they revert whenever political conditions permit them
 to do so".  As a pattern of organization, it provides a skeleton which may
 be quickly elaborated to take over all the necessary supervision of govern-
 ment whenever the opportunity arises.
 7.   For comparison with the "model Communist party'", Figure 2
 presents the central organs of the Lao Dong Party, and includes only
 those organs specifically described in the Statutes of the Lao Dong Party.
 Several of these national bodies have never been acknowledged as being
 in existence in the Communist press  and radio; only the Central Com-
 mittee, the Political Bureau, and the Secretary-General have ever been
 officially identified as functioning bodies.  The diagram also includes
 those offices which are only provisionally provided for in the Statutes,
 which can be formed upon the initiative of the Central Committee
 8.   Following these two diagrams are Figures 3a and. 3h provided
 by French Intelligence sources.  However as stated earlier, there is no
 confirmation for some of the elements included by the French, and as
 will be noted, there are a number of differences, both major and minor,
 between this diagram and the preceding two diagrams.
 9.   Figure. 4 of the Chinese Communist Party is presented as an
 example of the organization of a Communist Party in the Far East.  Figure
 5, another diagram of the Chinese Communist Party, is enclosed in certain
 copies only.  These have been selected for comparison due to the possibility

 That the Lao Dong Party may ultimately take the form of the Chinese
 Communist Party.  This is not a definitive conclusion, but is an opinion
 based upon a number of similarities existing between the two parties and
 their domestic and international positions.  For example, the Vietnamese
 Communists currently follow the Chinese ideological principle that the
 revolutionary base is composed of four classes; -the peasants, the pro-
 letariat, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie.  Also, both
 parties emphasi.-,ze the importance of organizing the peasants. In both
 countries a large proletariat class is absent. In each country power
 was achieved by similar guerrilla military techniques.  In addition, the
 geographic proximity of the two Communist countries and the training
 in China of a number of leading Vietnamese Communist, makes it
 worthwhile to examine the Chinese Communist Party structure and
 organization as a possible example for the Lao Dong Party.
