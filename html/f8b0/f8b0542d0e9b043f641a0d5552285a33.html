 The Fourth National People's Congress
 February 21, 1975
 The Fourth National People's Congress (NPC), held in Peking between January
 13 and 17, provides China with an approved government structure, a state constitu-
 tion, and a government leadership succession, at least at the highest level. The long
 delay in convening the Congress- it was to have been soon after the Ninth Party
 Congress in April   1969 and the initial secrecy connected with it suggest that
 leadership differences have yet to be ironed out. The congress was preceded by the

 second plenum of the "Tenth Central Committee, held January 8 to 10, which passed
 recommendations to the congress on the composition of the leadership and the final
 wording of the documents.
 Chairman Mao Tse-twig did not attend the plenum or the congress; his absence
 may have been related to differences with the dominant forces in Peking over how
 hard to push the campaign against the military. The communique issued at the
 conclusion of the congress makes relatively little mention of Mao personally. The
 guiding role of "Mao Tse-tung Thought" was written into the new constitution,
 however, and the chairman of the party was designated commander of the armed
 forces. One provision of the constitution was included at Mao's behest, so he
 obviously had a hand in drafting and approving the document. Whatever the reason
 for Mao's absence, his health remains reasonably good, and he remains all active
 political force.
 The congress endorsed and codified the moderate policies of'recent years. The
 new list of government leaders is headed by Premier Chou En-lai and composed
 predominantly of order-minded civilian bureaucrats. The policy statements approved
 by the congress stress moderation and continuity, and the constitution embodies the
 essentials of current pragmatic economic policies.
 The leaders of the ultraleftist forces, Mao's wife Chiang Ching and Yao
 Wen-yuan, did not gain government posts. Indeed, with the exc' ptions of the new
 minister of culture and the lowest ranking vice premier, it is difficult to identify any
 doctrinaire leftists in the State Council. The constitution and the reports adopted by
 the congress do, however, include some language and provisions that apparently are
 a sop to leftist ideals.
 The revised government structure has fewer ministries, which should improve
 centralized control. The post of state chairman has been abolished as part of an
 effort to increase party control over the government. Chow's report on the work of
 government also underscores the prerogatives of central management and gives
 special emphasis to comprehensive economic planning.
 In all, the congress appears to have set the stage for a period in which stress will
 be placed on pragmatic economic development goals rather than ideological debates
 or open political struggle. The age and poor health of several of the top party and
 government leaders, however, creates uncertainty as to the durability of the current
 leadership arrangements. As each of China's aging leaders passes from the scene,
 some readjustment of the distribution of political power will result. This process
 could eventually affect the pragmatic basis of economic modernization policies.

 The State Council, which includes the premier, vice premiers, and
 government ministers, is a smaller and more streamlined body than before
 the Cultural Revolution. There are now 12 instead of 15 vice premiers and
 29 ministries instead of'40. Furthermore, three of the current ministers head
 commissions, which normally rank below ministries in the government
 hierarchy. Staff offices under the State Council, which were in existence
 before the Cultural Revolution to oversee the workings of several ministries,
 have probably been re-established in some form, but this cannot be directly
 confirmed.
 Chou En-lai remains premier. There had been speculation that he might
 give up the post in favor of Teng Hsiao-ping, who has been running the daily
 affairs of government since Chou's hospitalization. Instead, Teng is the
 top-ranking vice premier. Since the Central Committee plenum preceding the
 congress named Teng a party vice chairman and a member of the Politburo's
 Standing Committee, he appears to be in a strong position to succeed Chou.
 The next-ranking vice premier, Chang Chun-chiao, who is in his early sixties,
 is now the logical successor to Teng, who is 70.
 Only one of the vice premiers is a military man, whereas there were
 four prior to the Cultural Revolution. Several vice premiers have consider-
 able experience in economic planning and administration. Among vice
 premiers are two persons who are more likely to be symbols than powers in
 their own right--Chen Yung-kuei of the national agricultural model Tachai
 Production Brigade, and Wu Kuei-hsien, the first woman vice premier. The
 background of one vice premier, Sun Chien, is hazy. He is a worker from
 Tientsin, apparently in his mid-thirties, whose actual role may be minimal.
 I-Ie appears to have leftist credentials and is the lowest ranking vice premier.
 Three ministers active in recent years were replaced; all had military
 backgrounds. A number of the present ministers also have had military
 careers, but they are almost certainly no longer on active duty. In all, the
 military did  not conic off well. In contrast to past practice, the defense
 minister is not a vice premier. Another military man who was a vice premier
 before the congress, Nieh Jung-then, was dropped. Moreover, Li Te-sheng,
 commander of the Shenyang Military Region, lost his party vice chair-
 manship and Politburo Standing Committer ranking at the plenum which
 preceded the congress. Li remains a full member of the Politburo.
 The new minister of defense, Yeh Chien-ying, is a close ally of Chou
 En-lai. Yeli apparently held this post on a de facto basis since the Lin Piao
 affair in September 1971.

 tion. The document specifically
 economic policies:
 The minister of public security is
 Flua Kuo-feng. By gaining this politi-
 cally sensitive post, Hua continues to
 improve his stature and becomes a man
 to watch. Hua first gained prominence
 during the Cultural Revolution but was
 brought to Peking only after the fall of
 Lin Piao; he was accused in posters last
 spring of "suppressing the masses." The
 power of the public security force has
 been expanded to include police func-
 tions. The Supreme People's Procurate,
 which formerly exercised police powers,
 has apparently been abolished.
 The new state constitution is a
 simplified document of 30 articles, as
 opposed to 106 in the 1954 constitu-
 codifies the fundamentals of moderate
 ? in agriculture, the production team, the lowest of the three
 organizational levels within the commune, remains the basic ac-
 counting unit, as has been the case since the failure of the Great Leap
 Forward.
 ? Private plots and individual, non-collective labor are retained.
 ? Citing agriculture as the economic "base" and industry the "lead-
 ing factor," the constitution maintains the economic priorities that
 have prevailed since the Great Leap.
 Compromise is evident in several articles. The right to criticize officials
 and policies through public debate and wall posters, the retention of revolu-
 tionary committees as permanent government bodies, and prohibitions
 against arbitrary arrest and retaliation against those who lodge complaints all
 appear to be sops to the political left. Citizens also are guaranteed the
 freedom to strike-a provision included at Mao's behest.
 Article 15 places the armed forces, including the militia, under the
 command of the party chairman rather than the now abolished head of state.
 The new provision is consistent with attempts to enhance party authority
 over the military.

 The constitution in general asserts party supremacy over the govern-
 ment apparatus as a whole. Unlike the former constitution, the new charter
 states specifically that the NPC is under the leadership of the party and
 performs its duties "on the proposal" of the party Central Committee.
 A number of ministries and commissions have been abolished, and their
 functions apparently havt- been transferred to other ministries. Two sensitive
 commissions dealing with science and technology, for example, have been
 dropped, although important work in these areas is undoubtedly being
 carried out in the Chinese Academy of Sciences and possibly in other
 organizations the Chinese have chosen not to reveal.
 In several cases, various ministries were amalgamated. The former
 ministries of education and of higher education have apparently been merged
 into a single ministry of Education. The choice of minister seems to reflect
 Peking's intention to put education, a politically sensitive area that has often
 been a hotbed of leftist political agitation, under the control of moderate
 elements. Chou Jung-hsin, the new minister, has long experience in impor-
 tant State Council positions and in the field of higher education. Signifi-
 cantly, he was the first of the new ministers to appear publicly with Chou
 En-tai, thus signaling the premier's interest in improving the spotty perfor-
 mance of China's educational institutions.
 Concern over economic difficulties in the past year was reflected in the
 establishment of separate ministries for coal and railways. Both ministries
 had been subordinated to other bodies. The coal and railway industries have
 experienced major problems recently, in part because of disruptions caused
 by ~:hc anti-Confucius campaign.
 Chcu En-tai's Report
 Premier Chou left the hospital to deliver a long report on the work of
 the government. He made some verbal bows to the political left, but the
 report was basically a firm statement of moderate policies, with emphasis on
 discipline and the prerogatives of the central authorities. Economic priorities
 were spelled out clearly and authoritatively for the first time in many years.
 The order of priorities-agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry-
 suggests that current policies will be largely continued and that the military's
 apparent bid for a larger share of the budget has been rebuffed. The speech
 also strongly endorsed the central government's role in overseeing economic
 planning.

 Chou praised both Chairman Mao and the Cultural Revolution-state-
 ments that could hardly be avoided. He reiterated that criticism of Lin and
 Confucius was the primary task. Chou noted that the class struggle not only
 would continue but would become acute at times-an apparent reference to
 the leadership struggle of the past year which did not rule out future clashes.
 His emphasis, however, was on unity. While stating that hard blows should
 be dealt to the handful of class enemies, Chou pointedly remarked that such
 criticism must be carried out with "accuracy." This appears to be a slap at
 those who raised charges against various leaders last spring.
 Chang Chun-chiao's Report
 Shanghai party boss Chang Chun-chiao gave the report on revision of
 the state constitution on behalf of the party Central Committee. This
 assignment is another indication that Chang is acting as party secretary
 general, although he has never been identified in that post.
 Youthful  p arty vice chairman
 Wang Hung-wen, who had presented the
 report on revision of the party constitu-
 tion on behalf of the party at the Tenth
 Party Congress in August 1973, did not
 gain a government post. While Wang was
 seated on the rostrum in the Great Hall
 of the People next to Chou En-lai and
 with other party vice chairmen, his pub-
 lic role was limited to observing the
 actions of a congress dominated by men
 who were active in the Chinese revolu-
 tion before he was born.
 Chang Chun-chiao
 Chang's speech noted that the task
 of revising the constitution had taken
 nearly five years. His remarks were
 closely tied to the provisions of the
 draft, but he did provide a hint that
 there may be friction ahead. Chang
 noted that while state enterprises have
 the form of socialist ownership, in some
 cases leadership is not in the hands of
 real Marxists and the worker masses.
 The implication of this phrase is not
 clear, but it may mean that new politi-
 cal attacks may develop as the incipient
 "New  Leap"  economic campaign
 gathers steam.

 Chou on Foreign Policy
 Chou En-tai's report on the work of the government, which contains
 almost all NPC pronouncements on foreign affairs, reaffirms in clear teruls
 established Chinese foreign policy lines and themes. Like his speech to the
 Tenth Party Congress in August 1973-Chou's last comprehensive statement
 of Chinese foreign policy-his report to the NPC artfully constructs a
 practical and ideological foundation for a relatively pragmatic policy. The
 report indicates that China's foreign policy has changed very little since the
 Tenth Congress.
 Chou used the formulation "Mao's revolutionary line in foreign affairs"
 to characterize Peking's policy. This formulation refers specifically to
 China's rapprochement with the US, to which Chou gave a positive assess-
 ment. I-Ie said Lhat "owing to joint efforts of both sides... relations have
 improved to some extent," despite continued existence of "fundamental
 differences." The premier had also used the formulation "improved to some
 extent" during the Tenth Congress, indicating that, in Peking's view, Sino-US
 relations have remained at least on track during the intervening 17 months.
 His acknowledgement that efforts
 by the US as well as China have contri-
 buted to improved relations appears in
 particular to be a positive element. At
 the 1973 congress, Chou did not use
 this formulation, which is seldom em-
 ployed by Chinese spokesmen. Peking
 has used the terns "fundamental differ-
 ences" in Most authoritative statements
 relating to Sino-US relations since
 Chou's speech at the Nixon banquet in
 February 1972.
 The premier said in his report that
 Sino-US relations will continue to im-
 prove as long as the principles of the
 Shanghai communique are carried out
 "in earnest." This first use of "in ear-
 nest" in an authoritative Chinese state-
 ment seems to imply that Peking ex-
 pects closer attention to the terms in
 the cor:nmunique for normalized rela-
 tions. Chou, however, seemed to mini-
 mize Taiwan as a serious source of irrita-
 tion. lie mentioned Taiwan separately

 from the US and only briefly, using a standard formulation which is shorter
 and less vigorous than the language in his report to the Tenth Party Congress.
 In contrast to the party congress speech, Chou did not other the NPC
 any justification for China's US policy. In 1973, Chou had implicitly argued
 that Peking's opening to Washington was a "necessary compromise" between
 ideologically disparate countries-like the Brest-Litovsk treaty engineered by
 Lenin with Germany in 1918. Chou had also claimed in 1973 that the US was
 strategically on the decline--by implication, less threatening toChina than the
 USSR, whose policies were expansionist. The absence of any rationale at the
 NPC suggests that the present course in Sino-US relations may now be under
 less criticism within China.
 Chou came down hard on the USSR and, as he had 17 months before,
 held out only the barest hope for amelioration in Sino-Soviet relations.
 Chou's treatment of the USSR was briefer than in 1973, and rather than
 castigate individual Soviet leaders and policies, as he did then, he emphasized
 outstanding substantive issues in state relations. Chou gave his remarks on
 this issue a veneer of' flexibility, but he did not indicate that Peking had
 altered its terms for reconciliation. He added that Moscow, far from helping
 to ease the way toward more normal state relations, had taken steps to
 worsen the situation-including promoting subversion against China and
 provoking skirmishing along the frontier. As in 1973, the premier virtually
 closed the door to reconciliation on the party level.
 The premier clearly implied that, of the external dangers to Chinese
 security, Peking remains primarily concerned about the threat posed by the
 USSR. lie hinted strongly, however, that China believes a Soviet attack is
 less likely now than at the time of the Tenth Party Congress. In his 1973
 report, Chou had specifically warned that China should remain particularly
 vigilant against a surprise Soviet attack, adding that China would "certainly"
 counterattack. Such admonitions were absent from Chou's report to the
 NPC and, although his formulations leave no doubt that Chou had Moscow
 in mind, he did not explicitly name the USSR as China's greatest external
 threat.
 Chow's report in 1973 contained the first authoritative Chinese claim
 that the Soviet threat was focused on Europe and that Europe had become
 the main arena for "super power contention." His remarks to the NPC on
 US-Soviet contention, while not as lengthy as his 1973 treatment of the
 subject, depicted competition between the US and the USSR as having
 reached new levels of intensity, thereby making a world war more likely and

 imminent than at the time of, the Tenth Party Congress. Chou's handling of
 the war theme was the most authoritative treatment of a subject which has
 been standard fare in Chinese propaganda for months. In private, however,
 Chinese officials remain much less serious about the likelihood of war,
 Suggesting that this line May have greater implications for Chinese domestic
 rather than foreign policy.
 On a related theme, Chou equivocated when he weighed the likelihood
 of war or revolution, Saying the "factors" for both war and revolution "are
 increasing." By contrast, in 1973 lie had quoted Mao's statement of may
 1970 that revolution was the main international trend. In fact, Chou's
 speech at the NPC appears to be the first authoritative Chinese statement to
 modify this line, which has been quoted extensively for almost five years. It
 is too early to say if the new formulation will now be standard.
 Chou's remarks to the NPC on the so-called Second World-developed
 countries of some stature but lacking the power of the US and USSR-re-
 flected an evolution in Chinese policy since his report to the Tenth Party
 Congress. At that time, the premier in vague terms had invited Second World
 states to join China in a broad front aimed against the "hegemonism" of the
 super powers. In his report to the NPC, however, Chou more clearly signaled
 the high priority Peking places on good relations with Europe and Japan.
 Chou explicitly pledged Chinese support to Second World nations who
 oppose "super power control, threats, and bullying." He added that China
 supports European unity and is prepared to work with Tokyo for stronger
 Sino-Japanese relations.
 Chow's speech dealt rather sparsely with the Third World, and his
 remarks on this subject were largely pro forma, reflecting its relatively low
 priority. He described the developing countries as the "main force" strug-
 gling against super power hegemony, but he refrained from repeating recent
 press themes which have played hard the idea of Third World economic
 strength.
 The premier's report reaffirmed China's relatively active trade policy,
 which he did not address in his 1973 speech but which had come under sonic
 fire in 1974. He made a brief bow toward the goal of self-reliance in
 modernizing the economy, but he clearly supported the continued acquisi-
 tion of capital equipment and technology from abroad. Indeed, the ambi-
 tious economic goals he sketched for China by the end of the century could
 not be reached without foreign technology. Chou said this liberal trade
 policy in the past had strengthened China, enabling it to withstand Soviet
 pressure and "imperialist encirclement."

 C'hina's aging leadership has now filled most of the gaps left by the
 Cultural Revolution in the party, government, and military hierarchies.
 Successors to Mao and ('hou have in effect been designated, although in both
 cases there is some question as to their staying power. The man who ranks
 behind Mao and Chou in the party, Wang Ilung-wen, is young, relatively
 inexperienced, and resented by at least some older leaders. Teng I-Isiao-ping,
 Chop's logical successor, is 70 and may succumb to the same enormous
 pressures of running the government that eventually took its toll on Chou.
 Moreover, Teng can probably never fully live down his purge in 1967.
 Chang Chun-chino is next in line to Teng lisiao-ping in the government
 succession, but the party succession beyond Wang Ilung-wen is cloudy. Teng
 and Chang also rank high on the party side, and either could end up in the
 top party job should Wang falter. Chang's increased stature is bolstered by
 his recent acquisition of another post-head of the army's political commissar
 system. Behind Teng and Chang conk several Politburo members whose age,
 experience, and rank give them a real chance for party leadership over the
 intermediate term.
 On the military side, Defense Minister Yell. Chien-ying and several other
 leaders of the Military Affairs Commission-the party's instrument for over-
 seeing the military establishment-are
 also very old. Politburo member Chen
 I-Isi-lien, who commands the prestigious
 Peking Military Region and is the only
 vice p crnier who also is a soldier, re-
 mains a prime candidate for military
 leadership. However, he is almost cer-
 tainly a politically contentious figure.
 The Peking Military Region command is
 a traditional hot seat, and Chen's future
 is by no means assured.
 In sum, significant progress on suc-
 cession has been made, but an ironclad
 succession arrangement that will stand
 up has by no means been made. More-
 over, a great deal of power has been
 concentrated in the hands of a relatively
 few leaders who hold ranking posts in
 the party, army, and government. This
 will probably increase central control
 for now, but it could cause difficulties
 over the longer run. When one of the
 top leaders dies-or if one is purged-the
 !'4,2   -0 regime will again be confronted with the
 'reng Hsiao-ping
 difficult task of tilling several important
 vacancies.
