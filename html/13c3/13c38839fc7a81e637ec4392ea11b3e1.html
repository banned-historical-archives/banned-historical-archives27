his most trusted aides al-
legedly were deep In the nar-
cotics traffic and that be had 
refused to extradite the no-
torious, French-born heroin 
kingpin, Auguste Ricord, to 
the U.S. to face drug charges. 
Our column, widely quoted 
throughout Latin America, up-
set Stroessner. He sent word 
to us through his Ambassador 
to Washington, Dr. Roque 
Avilla, that he was surprised 
at the allegations and asked 
for the names of those behind 
Paraguay's drug trade. 
Culprits Named 
We supplied Avilla with 
names and details implicating 
a dozen of Stroessner's closest 
associates, including his 
trusted chief of investigative 
police, Pastor Coronel. 
We also continued to raise 
questions about Ricord, known 
in narcotics circles as "El 
Commandante," whom Stroes-
sner had-ensconced in a color-
ful, comfortable jail cell with 
a private bath and a nearby 
telephone where he could keep 
in touch with his drug lhisi-
ness. 
At one point, a State De-
partment offical called us to 
warn that if we wrote about 
Ricord, it could upset the deli-
cate negotiations and prevent 
his return to the U.S. 
We contended that public-
ity would abet not prevent 
Ricord's extradition and that, 
in any case, the public was en-
titled to know what was hap-
pening. So we went ahead 
with our stories. Other news-
men also wrote about the 
"Paraguayan Connection," as 
Ricord was labeled. 
The final result: Ricord was 
extradited to the U.S., where 
he was convicted. He now faces 
a long prison term. Ambassa-
dor Ylitalo was sacked, and 
Paraguay appears to be trying 
to stem the dope traffic. 
Belatedly, the General Ac-
counting Office, in a report on 
world drug trafficking, ha S giv-
en the press the credit for this 
turnabout. 
"The American Embassy," 
states the GAO study, "has 
reported that the Government 
of Paraguay's concern about 
illicit international trafficking 
has increased recently because 
of unfavorable press reports 
about Paraguay's role as a 
smuggling center. 
"Publicity regarding U.S. ef-
forts to extradite (Ricord) has 
also increased the Government 
of Paraguay's concern . . . 
The fear of adverse publicity 
. . has caused Paraguay to 
take some steps to control 
narcotics." 
The embassy messages giving 
credit to the press and the 
GAO report praising the ef-
fects of publ city, ironically, 
are all heavil classified. In-
deed, every copy of the secret 
GAO report has been number-
ed to restrict its circulation 
and to prevem any publicity.

Usable Copters Consigned to Scrap 
By Jack Anderson 
Hundreds of helicopters, 
most of them perfectly air-
worthy, have been consigned 
to the scrap heap at Davis-
Monthan All Force Base in 
Tucson; Ariz., while law en-
forcement agencies around 
the country are paying 
through the nose for new po-
lice helicopters. 
The police units, with few 
exceptions, haven't been able 
to cut through the red tape to 
acquire surplus, military chop-
pers. This is forcing them to 
buy new helicopters for $60,-
000 to $100,000 apiece when 
they could refurbish an old 
battle chopper for a few 
thousand' dollars. 
There is evidence, more-
over that-the Federal Aviation 
Administration is cooperating 
with the big aircraft manu-
facturers to keep the bargain 
surplus helicopters out of po-
lice hands. Here's how they 
work it: 
The FAA won't issue ? cer-
tificates of airivorthiness for 
the surplus choppers unless 
the manufacturers issue new 
data? plates. Bell Helicopter, 
for example, explains that it 
cannot determine without a 
total factory overhaul whether 
a chopper still meets Bell' 
specifications. 
Bell won't risk damage 
claims, therefore, by issuing 
a data plate. Without this, the 
FAA won't certify the air-
craft. And insurance com-
panies won't grant reasonable 
liability rates without FAA 
certification. 
0? 
Rep. Ogden Reid (D-N. V.) drug firm of Merck, Sharp ilatagt46,,T4e4,iompr-
has suggested in a private let- ?and Dohme to become deputy thea.vlia.v.LLS,..114-11igetweshiatd-
ter to FAA Administrator director of the Bureau of 
John Shaffer that there is a ? Drugs. She acknowledged to 
simple solution. "I have us that she set to work in her 
checked with the services in-
volved and have been as-
sured," he wrote, "that the 
log history of each helicopter 
is readily available and that 
either the manufacturer or 
the FAA could easily deter-
mine whether the craft is air-
worthy from this and some 
personal inspection . . 
Reid suggests suspiciously 
that FAA's refusal to issue the 
certificates is based on a 
technicality which seems de-
signed to protect the market 
for new helicopters rather 
than the public interest." 
Conflict of Interest 
An unpublished study ex-
poses the cozy relationship 
between the Food and Drug 
Administration and the busi-
nesses it is supposed to over-
see. 
Such commercial giants as 
Swift and Company; Smith, 
Kline and French; and Libby, 
McNeil and Libby have been 
able to place top executives 
in watchdog posts inside the 
agency. 
The study, by the Center for 
Science in the Public Interest, 
reveals that some 22 of the 
FDA's top 54 officials have 
held key positions in FDA-
regulated Industries or 
front organizations which 
cater to theie Industrie. 
A typical case: Or. Marion 
Finkel came from the large;

censes. Three of the Merck JA441.1,iguai.4.11,-,Y.:4.4261434-0.-. 
drugs were subsequently ap-
proved. 
Dr. Ogden Johnson, head of 
FDA's Division of Nutrition, 
came from A. E. Staly Manu-
facturing Co., an Illinois soy 
product producer, which is 
actively researching new soy 
food. At the FDA laboratories 
under Johnson's control the 
FDA currently conducts tests 
on the nutritional value of 
soy meal and soy protein. 
Other FDA officials intend 
to return to the drug and food 
industries when they leave the 
government. Typical is Dr. Vir-
gil Wodicka who formerl 
worked for Hunt-Wesson, Lib-
by and Ralston Purina, but is 
now FDA's director of the 
Bureau of Foods. He has mad 
no bones about his plans to 
return to the industry whe 
his government service is com-
pleted. Even the most nobl 
of men might avoid doing bat-
tle with a corporation whic 
holds the purse strings to his 
later employment. Others mor 
inclined to go to the well with 
big business might even be s 
duced by what FDA insiders 
call "the deferred bribe."

Europe Is Angry Over Money Crisis 
By Jack Anderson 
President Nixon's failure to 
intervene directly to check the 
International monetary crisis 
last week has caused bitter-
ness and anger in the chancer-
ies of Western Europe. 
The secret diplomatic dis-
patches and intelligence re-
ports from Europe indicate 
that feelings against the U.S. 
haven't run so high since the 
end of World War II. The 
President's handling of the 
monetary mess, in the opinion 
of most European leaders, 
threatens to plunge the world 
into a disastrous trade war. 
The result, they fear, could 
be a world depression.

The cause of the crisis was a 
sudden flood of dollars into 
the exchanges market. This 
forced European countries, 
particularly West Germany, to 
buy up dollars in order to 
keep their own currency sta-
ble. Twice now, these govern-
ments have been caught with 
their vaults full of dollars 
when President Nixon has de-
valued the dollar, thus stick-
ing them with huge losses. 
The problem, somewhat over-
simplified, is this: The dol-
lar has been the backbone of 
the world monetary system 
for the past quarter century 
Western Europe has depended 
upon the U.S. to bolster the 
dollar. But Washington took 
no firm action to halt the re-
cent run on the dollar. The 
President's economic czar, 
Treasury Secretary George 
Shultz, came to a Paris mone-
tary conference without in-
structions. He merely listen-
ed, with seeming detachment. 
Brandt thought his attitude 
was senseless, but France's 
President Georges Pompidou 
considered it suspicious.

He suspects they have been 
selling dollars for European 
currencies, which have be-
come more valuable as the 
dollar has weakened. Now he 
expects the American conglom-
erates to use this money to 
begin a new wave of invest-
ments in Europe. 
The diplomatic repercus-
sions have been so serious 
?that the President's foreign 
policy czar, Henry Ki,ssiuge? r,d 
is staffing up for a crash stUdY 
of the monetary crisis. Ile 
wants to have a voice in set-
ting monetary policy, with a 
view to its impact upon U.S.-
European relations. 
Washington Whirl 
Tax Dodge Award?Georgia 
Pacific, the giant lumber and 
paper goods corporation, has 
been selected for us by Fred 
Harris' Tax Action Campaign 
as Tax Avoider of the .Week. 
Georgia Pacific has been ex-
traordinarily successful at 
chopping down its tax base. 
According to Harris, the tax 
laws, as they apply to most 
businesses, would have taken 
48 per cent of Georgia Pacif-
ic's 1971 taxable profit of 
$117,600,000. These timber 
wolves, however, paid an 'ef-
fective tax rate of only 11.3 
per cent, through a long list of 
special tax exemptions. Most 
startling: profits from tree 
sales are treated as capital 
gains rather than ordinary in-
come. Manufacturers of recy-
cled paper, deprived of similar 
advantages, can't compete 
with Georgia 'Pacific's timber 
cutting cost cutting. Thus, the 
government's largess to Geor-
gia Pacific makes all the talk 
about ecology as valuable as 
sawdust. Tax Action Cam-
paign will confront the most 
flagrant tax evaders each 
week with leafletting and pub-
lic demonstrations. 
Presidential Goof??Many 
troubled diplomats at the 
State Department, familiar 
with the full details of the 
shooting Of Ambassador Cleo 
Noel and deputy George 
Moore in I- hartoum, believe 
they might have been saved if 
President Nixon had kept his 
mouth shut. Shortly after he 
issued his lough statement 
that "we wii I not pay black-
mail," the two men were exe-
cuted by the Black September 
terrorists. Pi eviously the kid-
nappers had ihown signs of re-
lenting. Tho.:e who privately 
criticize the President agree 
with his stahd against black-
mail. They simply felt it was 
unnecessary t anatagonize 
the kidnaper ; by proclaiming 
It to the worbi before every ef-
fort had beer made to negoti-
ate their reit ase. Deputy Un-
der Secretary William Macom-
ber, who recently negotiated 
the release 09 another kidnap-
ped Ambassador, Clinton

preted within the CIA. as in 
attempt to make_Aho_latallt-
genoe analyses conform with 
thP President's  _thinking. 
The President's displeasure 
with the CIA has been no se-
cret inside the agency. In 1971, 
he issued a detailed "decision 
memorandum," complaining 
about inadequate intelligence 
and calling for? changes. He 
gave his national security ad-
viser, Henry A. Kissinger, new 
power to evaluate intelligence 
and instructed then CIA direc-
tor Richard Helms to make 
the estimating-analyzing op-
eration more responsive to 
White House needs. 
Some of the reforms the 
President sought, to be sure, 
were intended to reduce run-
away costs and to increase effi-
ciency. But the cool, compe-
tent Helms was reluctant to 
adopt changes that might 
make the CIA less professional 
and more political. 
He believed there should be 
a diversity, not conformity, of 
intelligence activities. He 
thought diverse views should 
be funneled to the White 
House as a check upon the 
rival intelligence services. If 
the ,President should receive 
only an intelligence consensus 
and this should turn out to be 
wrong, Helms feared, it could 
be disastrous for the nation. 
CIA's 'Liberal' Taint 
But the conservatives around 
Mr. Nixon persuaded him that 
the CIA had a liberal taint 
and that the Office of National 
Estimates, in particular, took 
a dovish view of the Vietnam 
war. 
It's true the CIA warned in 
1966-67 that Communist 
strength was almost double 
what the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
estimated. Sure enough the 
Communists struck with unex-
pected power during the 1988 
Tet holidays. 
It's true the CIA claimed 
that the bombing of North 
Vietnam had not disrupted the 
flow of supplies down the in-
filtration routes into the 
south. Sure enough, the Com-
munists launched an unex-
pected, powerful offensive in 
March, 1972. 
It's true the CIA warned 
that the mining of Haiphong 
harbor and the renewed bomb-
ing of the north wouldn't keep 
the North Vietnamese forces 
from getting all the supplies 
they needed. This estimate, 
too, was subsequently veri-
fied. 
Of -course, the CIA wasn't 
always right. It badly under-
estimated the flow of Commu-
nist supplies through the Cam-
bodian port of SihanoukVille 
and, therefore, discounted the 
need for invading Cambodia. 
The CIA also upset the 
White House by disputing 
then Defense Secretary Mel-
vin Laird's statement to Con-
gress in 1969 that the Soviets 
had succeeded in installing 
multiple warheads on the 
giant SS-9 missile, each war-
head capable of hitting an in-
dependent target. The White 
House wanted Congress to be-
lieve Laird and to vote for 
more defense funds.

gence agents were used to par-
achute American supplies to 
the Khampas' mountain biv-
ouacs. The bright orange sup-
ply parachutes were converted 
into shirts by the Khampas 
and quickly became a "Red 
Badge of Courage" in Tibetan 
refugee restaurants in Khat-
mandu. 
But now the Tibetan refu-
gees, when they gather in the 
restaurants for marijuana 
stew and cakes, are forlorn. 
The American aid is drying 
up, and the Khampas have to 
depend on the penurious In-
dian intelligence services for 
supplies. This has so weak-
ened them that the Nepal gov-
ernment, branding them 
"bandits," has been able to 
move them from the border 
areas. Now when the tribes-
men feel war-like, they prey 
on peasants instead of Chinese 
soldiers.

do this simply by filling out

But a spot check by IRS dis-

This would seem to confirm

Instead of becoming part of a

Mr. Wise, the former Wash-

co-author of "The Invisible 
Government," a 1964 book 
about the Central Intelligence 
Agency, wrote that the Tibetan

Colorado Springs.

Tibetan trainees were loaded 
aboard a bus at the Army 
camp for a 130-mile trip to a 
nearby airfield in Colorado 
Springs, where a large Air 
Force jet was waiting to 
quietly fly them out of the 
country before dawn. 
"But coming down the moun-
tain," Mr. Wise wrote, "the 
bus skidded off the road in the 
snow. As a result of the delay 
caused by the accident, it was 
daylight when the Tibetans ar-
rived at the field." 
Once there, the book went 
on, overzealous military secur-
ity officials herded the air-
port's employes around at gun-
point, but not until at least 
one of them saw the Tibetans 
board the jet. 
Qonl,plaints to the local 
, sheriff were made about the, 
manhandling of the civilians,, 
and a few newspaper articles 
describing the bizarre encoun-
ter were published in Colorado 
Springs and Denver. But, Mr. 
Wise wrote, the full implica-
tions of the incident did not 
become public. 
When a reporter for The 
New York Times subsequently 
began a routine inquiry, based, 
on a brief news-agency dis-
patch about the incident, the 
book said, the office of Robert 
S. McNamara, who was then 
Secretary of ;','`'Defense, tele-
phoned the Washington Bureau 
of The Times and asked that 
the story not be used because 
of "national security" reasons. 
The Times acquiesced, Mr. 
Wise wrote, in line with the 
general newspaper practice in 
those years of not challenging 
the Government's definition of 
"national security."

A Sense of Deja Vu at CI 
Watergate Disclosures Raise Questions 
"We were not involved because it seemEd 
to me that was a clear violation of what our 
charter was." 
Richard M. Helms, Pah. 7, 1973 
"Dick Helms was most cooperative and 
helpful." 
Tom Charles Huston, July 1970 
By Laurence Stern 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
In the vernacular of courtroom melo-
drama, someone was dissembling. 
It was either Richard M. Helms, the re-
spected formed director of the Central In-
telligence Agency, or was it Tom Charles 
Huston, the White House architect of the 
controversial 1970 domestic intelligence 
plan. 
The conflict was rooted in an appear-
ance by Helms before a closed? session of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
last February 7. 
Helms was being questioned by Sen. 
Clifford P. Case (R-N.J.). It had come to 
his attention, said Case, that in 1969 or 
1970 the White House asked that all the 
national intelligence agencies pool resources 
to learn all they could about the anti-war, 
- 
iovement, ? , ? 
"Do you know anything," he asked Helms, 
about any activity on the part of the CIA 
in that connection? Was it asked to be 
ivolved?" 
Replied Helms: "I don't recall whether 
e were asked but we were, not involved 
ecause it seemed to me that was a clear 
?lotion of what our charter was," 
"What would you do in a case like that? 
uppose you were?" Case persisted. 
"I would simply go to explain to the 
resident this didn't seem to be advisable," 
id Helms. 
"That would end it?" 
"Well I think so, normally," Helms con-
luded. 
Case's prescient question was posed near-
y four months before the public leak of

tions.

efmthe,iirater." 
Time and time again since 
its inception 26 years ago, 
the CIA has been cling/it 
with its cloak and dagger 
showing in the wrong places 
at the wrong time. 
Six years ago she agency 
was rocked by its last Major 
:."--elligence scandal?the 
Aosure that it had been 
etly funding and infil-
.ng student associations, 
,ersities, labor unions, 
rch groups and diverse 
tr private organizations. 
ens, perhaps hundreds of 
millions of dollars in public 
funds were distributed with-
out public accounting to in-
fluence the views and activi-
ties of supposedly independ-
ent organizations in the 
United States and abroad. 
The money was circulated 
through a network of tax-ex-
empt foundations operated, 
in many cases, by an influ-
ential elite of bankers, law-
yers and industralists who 
provided a massive and re-
spectable cover. 
If ? ever there were 
grounds, for a wholesale con-
gressional review of the 
CIA's role in the public and 
private business of the conn-
try, the 1967 episode would 
seem to have provided the 
occasion. 
"I'm not at all happy 
about what the CIA has 
been doing," said then Vice 
President Hubert H. Hum-
phrey, "and I'm sure that 
out of this very singularly 
disagreeable situation will 
come a reformation of that 
agency." 
23,1414,11:41441....g. ed b si-
eay. 
President Johnson ap-
pointed a, study commission, 
headed by then Under Sec-
retary of State Nicholas 
DeB. Katzenbach, which re-
ported back speedily that 
the CIA had been following 
the orders of the National 
Security Council in carrying 
out the covert financing 
scheme. 
The Katzenbach panel 
called for a modest reform. 
It proposed a prohibition on 
CIA funding to educational, 
philanthropic and cultural 
organizations such as the 
ones the agency had been 
secretly funding. But it also 
suggested a loophole under 
which such grants could be 
made to serve "overriding 
national security interests." 
Helms was one of the three 
panel members. 
Less than a year after the 
secret tiinding scandal 
broke, a group of Old Boys 
met in January, 1968 under 
the auspices of the presti-
gious Council on Foreign 
Relations to take stock of 
the agency's somewhat bat-
tered public position. The 
elite panel included the late 
t. Allen Dulles, 
e rnational financier C. 
Dmiglas Dillon and two for-
le.ar heads of the agency's 
P,ans (familiarly known as 
"r.irty tricks") Division. 
while the public rhetoric 
promised reform and tighter 
safeguards on 'CIA opera-
tions, the focus of the off-
the-record discussion at the 
council's New York offices 
w.is altogether different:. 
This was the private diagno-
sF presented to the group 
ti.1 Richard M. Bissell Jr., 
who was the CIA's chief of 
c, vert operations during the 
y of Pigs debacle: 
-On disclosure of private 
Aitutional support of late 
it is very clear that we 
should have had greater 
corapartmenting of opera-
tit -ns. If the agency is to be 
ef eetive, it will have to 
mike use of private institu-
tions on an expanding scale, 
th nagh these relations 
Which have been `blown' 
ea inot be resurrected. 
'We need to operate un-
dr deeper cover, with in-
: crotsed attention to the use 
of 'cut outs' (agency fronts) 
rite CIA interface with 
various private groups, in-
cluding business and stu-
dent groups must be reme-
died." 
3issell's comments were 
never intended for public 
co isumption. But a record 
of the discussion was found 
in an university official's of-
fice during a 1968 student; 
rad in Cambridge, Mass. 
The issue, as privately de-

The most serious lessor of 
the recent disclosures is 
that the agency and the 
White House national secu-
rity managers have not been 
cured of the penchant for 
entanglement in domestic 
affairs. 
And Congress, in defer-
ence to the agency's mys-
tique of national security un-
touchability, has been reluc-
tant to press hard questions. 
One, such question might 
be the role of the CIA's Do-

which was created nearly 10 
years ago and which has 
been publicly mentioned in

One of these -directives, 
NSCID 7, empowered the 
agency to question persons 
within the United States 
and to interview American 
travelers to and from Com-
munist countries, Wise and 
Rosi wrote. It also estab-
lished the basis for the CIA 
front groups and fund con-
duits which were "blown" in 
the 1907 disclosures. 
The prevailing tone of 
Congressional oversight of 
the intelligence community 
was expressed during a 1971 
debate by Sen. John C. 
Stennis (D-Miss.), the senior 
congressional . overseer of 
CIA activities. 
"As has been said, spying 
Is spying," Stennis said. 
"You have to make up your 
mind that you are going to 
have an intelligence agency 
and protect it as such, and 
shut your eyes some and 
take what is coming." 
In recent weeks the 
agency has been subject to 
heavier congressional scru-
tiny than ever in its history 
as a result of the Watergate 
disclosures. Five commit-
tees, four in the Senate and_ 
one in the House, have been 
looking at various aspects of 
agency operations as they 
related to Watergate, ITT, 
Ellsberg and the 1970 intelli-
gence plan. 
But a searching and sys-
tematic examination of how 
the CIA functions and how 
deeply its operations in-
trude into the internal af-
fairs of the United States 
does not seem likely to 
emerge from this spate of 
overlaping investigations.

Grain Companies Rake In Subsidies 
By Jack Anderson 
and Les Whitten 
A handful of giant grain 
companies reaped $333 million 
in federal subsidy payments at 
the same time that they were 
making windfall profits from 
sales in the Russian wheat 
deal. 
The massive sales profits 
grabbed off by the wheat bar-
ons have already been 
documented: the traders 
bought cheap on the basis of 
private information, then sold 
dear when the magnitude of 
the deal drained wheat sup-
plies. Their shenanigans 
helped drive up the prices of 
meat, dairy and bakery goods. 
Now, the Senate Investiga-
tions Subcommittee under 
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) 
has documented how the grain 
merchants chiseled the tax-
payers through subsidies. 
A secret staff memo meant 
for Jackson's eyes only asserts 
that "the expert 'subsidy pro-
gram cost American taxpayers 
$333 million in agricultural 
subsidies in connection with 
the Russian grain deal." Much 
of the gouging was accom-
plished through dubious paper 
transactions. 
Under the export subsidy 
system, the government pays 
the .U.S. seller the difference 
between the high price he 
could get in the U.S. market 
and the lower price he would 
get from the foreign buyer. 
For example, if the seller 
could get $3 a bushel in the 
U.S., but only $2.75 in Europe, 
the government pays the U.S. 
seller 25 cents a bushel. The 
government promotes such 
deals to improve our balance 
of trades and bolster the dol-
lar. 
At the time of the Russian 
wheat deal late last summer, 
subsidies had soared to 47 
cents a bushel ? the differ-
ence between the U.S. price of 
$2.10 and the foreign price of 
$1.63. The Jackson memo de-
tails how the grain companies 
used this situation to collect 
massive amounts in subsidies 
by clever manipulation. 
"For example, we have in 
formation that one compan, 
(Cargill) sold wheat to its 
wholly-owned South American 
affiliate (Tradex-Panama). The 
company collected the subsidy 
when it showed proof of ship-
ment to its affiliate. 
"The affiliate then sold the 
wheat to another affiliate in 
Geneva which thereupon 
made a final sale for $2.20 (a 
bushel) or 10 cents above the 
American price." 
In other words, Cargill sold 
wheat to its affiliate in order 
to cash in on the high subsidy. 
Then . Cargill made a profit a sma a

wheat. The profit was re- -Tne nook also discloses CIA

"This practice was repeated 
numerous times as (The De-

blindly maintained unneces-
sary subsidies which pushed 
up the price of wheat and ulti-
mately the retail cost of food 
to the American taxpayer." 
Footnote: A Cargill spokes-
man conceded to oar associate

tions with affiliates' occurred, 
and that subsidies were col-

Spooky Censors ? So far, 
the Central Intelligence 
Agency has successfully 
blocked publication of a CIA 
expose by ex-agent Victor 
Marchetti. Now, State Depart-
ment censors are trying to get 
a copy of the manuscript from 
its co-author, John Marks, for-
merly a State Department em-
ployee.
