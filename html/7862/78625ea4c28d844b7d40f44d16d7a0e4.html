 T IDET "CF AM A LIT TO YE LIB RATED" :
 MOADCAST TO DALAI LAMA:
 A call to the Tibetan people and the Dalai Lemn to achieve peaceful
 liberation was broodcnst by IIsi Joe Chin T so, Tibetan pntr iol and. V ice-
 Chai.rmen of the _Chinghni Provincial People's Government, over the radio
 station at S fining.  He said that Tibet would have regional autonomy after
 its liberation.
 He first pointed out that Tibet was certain to be liberated., since it
 was part of the territory of the People's republic of Chinn and the People's
 Liberot ion Army was strong enough to f:ulf.?il. the . task of. iaUGr of ion.

 they think:that Tibet: was too remote from
 S in io ng,' Ch.inghni;'and S ilceng Province s,
 which hod,nlrencly been liberated.
 GeogroiLicn1 cliff icult ies could not
 st;'op the PLA f rota marching- thew.  No more
 proof of this was needed. than the famous
 tong March, he said.  In Hainan Eland,
 where the Kuomintang exurted every effort
 to hold. on, less than a month was needed
 to l ibex. et e  it  ent i ely.
 He also called on them to harbour no
 more illusions about getting help from
 .r..
 British and American im~~crinli:sts.  The destruct ion .of the Kuomintang could
 serve as e lesson of the futility of such. not ions.
 They could be nssured that the Central People's Government, under the
 lencl.ership of the Communist Party, was absolutely considerate of the. interests
 and tredit ions of all component nationalities of the People's Le-public of
 China and respected their frce.dom of religion.
 Temples and monasteries in Chinghn i and Sinkiang and S ikeng had all been
 thoroughly well treated since the liberation.  Tibet would. have regional
 autonomy after its liberation, according to the common programme of the
 People's Political Consultative Conference.
 The message ended with a call. to Tibetans to secure 'peaceful libernt ion
 and to send e plenipotentiary delegate  as  soon as possible to conduct peace
 talks in Peking, in order to save  the Tibetan people from unnecessary losses.

 Altogcther 36,300,000 people hove signed their, macs to the` pence,
 appeal in ; ulgurio, Hungary, Uumnnio on'd Germany, not including Czechoslovakia
 and Poland. whcre stot ist ics have not yet been released.  In Korea, 3,970,000
 people had signed by May 7.  Despite suppression nod rest Trot ion by react iona y
 governments in cnpit aliit countries, the pence s ignot uro drive hn-s.. also st art e d
 there.  In Zest Germany, occupied by: the American authorities, 90,' to 100,   of
 the adults linve.signed the 1 rice opted.  The drive is also being onrVica out
 in Joopsn, which is under the control of lvlacAr'thur.
 The significance of the pence movement lies in the fact that pence-loving
 people of the world are now organising and mobilising the people of the world
 to continue-,to fight ngn inst the imperialist bloc, and to prevent the outbreak
 of another world war.  By the boycott of the people of the world. and the
 further organ isnt ion and unity of the world's peace-loving .~ople, war in-
 st igators.would be eliminated and a new world war avoided.
 The pence appeal demands unconditional prohibition on the use of atomic
 weapons.  It is not because atomic weapons form the decisive factor in war,
 but because the American imperialists are employing the atomic weapons as
 a threat for large-sonic slaughter of mankind.  Such a threat has aroused
 the hatred and. indignat ion of the people of the world.  And now a drive is
 in progress to recruit nil pence-loving people to fight against the imperialist
 warmongers and. to prevent another world war.
 At present, the  irno_oer inl ist bloc is met with serious daily-increasing
 difficulties in the course of preparing for a' new war.   Not long ago, Dean
 1lcheson, the U.S. Secretory of State, who went to West Europe for the Foreign
 Ministers' C,nference, increased further aid to European countries looking
 for  industrial expansion under America's og ressivc plan and the American
 "total diplomacy" in order to intensify their preparot ions for war.  But
 reports from various sources show defeat of.the imerican imperialists.
 Conferences of the some nature were held in Bangkok, Cairo, .The Hague,
 Paris and. Tokyo.  Acheson has started. an all-out offensive in total diplomacy,
 and has also time and again reaffirmed the boycott of the Soviet Unions
 r';mer'icon aircraft invaded the territorial air of the Soviet Union.  13idoult,
 obey tog the order of the American imperialists, proposed a Supreme Council
 for the Atlantic.  All these were  clone before the opening of the London
 Conference, which was aimed to form    a new alliance based on the Atlnnt is
 Pact in order to unify American direction in economic, political and, military
 plans.
 But the U.S. Government has been faced with  icnt difficulty in adopting
 Bidault's blueprint.  [,est Germany's position in the new war remains unclari
 f ied.  In military matters, divisions and conflicts between the U.S. and
 Britain have become obvious lately.
 Similar things have also hnp; gene d in regard. to A Sinn j?r oblems.  The
 Ministers' Conference did not mention anything about the Japanese Peace
 question.   This shows a serious deadlock exists among the Ministers.  However,
 it does  not  mean that the London mooting was neglected by peace-loving people.
 The eonferenc  further revealed the  i?fperialists'  intensions for a long-
 term occupation of West Germany and Japan.   The Conference has also further
 en1ainq cl the  motive  of the A,nglo-American imperialists in.,reor,,anising the
 Atlantic alliance    nd in broadening their ag lessive plans.
 At present, under the direct control of the 1merican imperialists the
 various reactionary governments are employing every barbarous means to  suppress
 the people and are carrying out Fascist and nnti-Communist measures against
 the strength of the people.  anti-Communist legislation was proposed in
 Australir-, and South Africa on April 27 and May 5 respectively.  Under the
 direction of the American impcrinlists t}ie  puppet governments in host Germany
 and Japan have also suggested. measures to ban the Communist Parties supported
 by the people.  ,
 Under the direct ion of the American imperialists, Latin Amcr icon Govern
 !ncnts, including Brazil, Part guay and Peru, have long prohibited the not ivit Ies
 of the Communist Party, and Panama and other countries have recently declared
 the Communist Party.. illegal.

 The anti-Communist tide of the world react ion ary bloc' headed by the

 been fully shown because :)f its fear of the expansion cif the forces for

 of Hongkong depends entirely on the materials and mara)ovrer of the Chinese
 people.
 "Now Groat Britain has abruptly decided to subject our people entering
 or leaving Hongkong to the same control as other nationals.  Tnis unreason-
 able measure, as the Vice-Minister of Ppreigna Affairs, Chan ; Han-fu, has
 stated in his protest, is an unfriendly act towards the People's Republic
 of China and her people.
 "The 70 planes of the CNAC and the CATC novr in Hongkong are the State
 property of the People's Republic of Ctsina.  Our Government has time and
 again notified the British Government that no interference, d~mnage, sabotage
 or c;.,ans 'erence by anybody under under any pretext woulcl be tolerated.
 "Since the British Government declared its desire to establish diplo:.
 matic relations with our country, it should respect our.State property as
 much a as it possibly can,  But as a result of its failure to give proper pro-
 tection, many planes suffered sabotage at the hands of bandits.  Now it has
 unreasonably detained all the planes.  TtAs is .a highly unfriendly attitude
 to adopt towards the People's Republic of China.
 "Vie are convinced that unless there is an immediate change in the actions
 and attitude of Great Britain, the only consequence can be to arouse the anger
 of the Chinese people.  In such a case Sino-British relations would be unable
 to proceed on the, right track, and diplomatic talks now going on between the
 two countries would not achieve any good result. , The responsibility will rest

 .'LABOUR iMQ' RETURNS FROM MAY DAY IN MOSCOW:
 "My visit to the Soviet Union has greatly heightened my confidence in
 the successful reconstruction of our motherland," said Chao Kuo-yuy on his
 return to Peking from the Soviet Union as one of the trade union May Day
 delegation.
 A 26-year-old lathe worker, Chao -Kuo-yu is a famous Chinese 'labour
 hero.' vrhoso record-broakinc 'Stakhanovito' work in a Mukden engineering
 factory served tol. start the now record movement in Manchuria.  In his three
 weeks' stay, apart from attending the May Day rally in Moscow, he visited
 six factories, went to Lent ngrad,, and spoke to numerous workers including
 some famous Soviet Stakhanovites.
 "I was particularly impressed," he said,,"by the groat whoe-producing
 :Factory I  saw,  which had boon totally demolished by German Fascist,  There
 it.was completely restored and working full blast.  On seeing the photographs
 of the demolished factory as it was just a few years ago, I realised what
 Kard-won achievement this - and other great works in the Soviet Union -
 represents of the diligent ,labour of Soviet workers.  Nothing can be won
 easily."
 ''We talked for hours," he said, describing his meeting imLeningrad
 with G.M. Dubinin, a lathe-worker like himself and well-known throughout
 the Soviet Union.  They exchanged experiences and Dubinin brought along
 other workers, too, to tell him of their work,  Dubinin was extremely inter-
 ested in the development of China, asked many questions about production
 and difficulties that were encounteredv and presented Chao with  many book-
 :Lets showing the great achievements of the Stakhanovites in the Soviet Union.
 "I was very interested in socialist emulation in the Soviet Union,
 and asked him Lou Soviet Trade Union Committees direct emulation.  And in
 turn I told him about our new record movement in North-East China.  I ex-
 plained that we are meeting many$.fficulties, but we  are confident we
 can by our exertions overcome them."
 They left firna friends.  "In China,, vre have often talked about our
 older brothers of the Soviet Union," said Chao.  "Now we nave personally
 experienced how dear they are to us."
 ''My impression  of Moscow is that city is full of vigour and vitality.
 i7hen work finishes in the evening, the whole city becomes buoyant.  Every-
 thing is well-ordered.  You can but stand amazed at the wonderful things
 working people can achieve, once they become masters of their destiny.  The
 Soviet Union clearly.poiits out the future prospect for China.'He was greatly impressed by the expression: of world working-class solid-
 arity in the great May Day rally, with portraits of working-class leaders of
 -rari ous countries carried by gigantic waves of marchers, and was particularly
 moved by the -onrmth of friendship shown toward new China and the numerous
 portraits of Chairman Moo Tee-turig carried in the procession.
 "In placards held aloft by Soviet workers of various factories showing
 the figures of -vcrfulf ilmont of pn uotion p3ana, T saw a, prnotioal expression
 of the growing strength of that bulwark of peace, the Soviet Union.  And this
 feeling was further tiuinhtened when I saw the powerful Soviet armed forces
 under review, on May Day. "
 $uuintng up his impressions, Chao Kuo-yu said, "Leningrad suffered
 most cruel devastation at the hands of the Fascists.  But now it has
 been turned by the workers into a beautiful city.  Inspired by their
 example, I fool certain our motherland will surely and swiftly follow
 along the road opened out by the Soviet Union,"
 And he added with great confidence,  ""With the powerful Soviet
 Union., led by the groat Stalin, and with all peace-loving people in the
 whole world, we are certain to blast the schemes of ,the war  instiga-
 vors.  On May Day, the working class of the world, led by the Soviet
 Union, demonstrated that they are really a powerful force defending
 world peace."                       (NCNA Peking Morse English 2130-hrs 22 May)

 NATIONALIST CRITICISM OF AGENDA
 FOR BAGUIO CON?"EREN'CE:
 In Taipch today, Foreign Minister George Yeah issued an official
 statement on the Baguio Conference.  The release said:-
 "A joint statement was issued by President Chiang Khi-suek Aand
 President Quirino on July 11, 1949 after their conference at Baguio,
 in which it was. stated that, because of the lack of close cooperation
 in the :past, the Far. Eastern countries were now facing threats of
 Communism, and these countries should form an alliance immediately
 to assist each other in bolstering Communist threats.
 HIlowevor, the joint statement of President Quirino and Foreign
 Minister Romulo, released this morning, is inaccurate.  The forth
 coming conference is to implement the joint statement of President
 Chiang and President nui_rino with the aim of stopping the spread
 of Communism.
 "On April 21, President Chiang I ai-shek sent a letter to Pre-
 sident Quirino to reaffirm the support of the Chinese Government
 for the forthcoming conference and state his complete understanding
 of the aims of the meeting.
 "But today's statement by President Qui.rino and Foreign Minister
 Romulo snows the impossibility. of uniting the Asian nations and coun-
 tries in the fight against international Communism, and the Chinese
 Government has no intention of participating in a conference of this
 sort.  The Chinese Government will release a statement to clarify
 its stand."                      (Taipeh Radio Voice Kuo-yu 2130-hrs 22 May)
 SIX COUNTRIES TO ATTEND:
 President Quirino told the Press today that India, Pakistani
 Ceylon, Siam, Indonesia and Australia would attend the Baguio Con-
 ference.  He announced tha names of the six Philippine delegates,
 led by Foreign Minister Romulo.     They include two Opposition party
 members, The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both
 Houses and members of both Government parties.
 President Quirino will return to Baguio tomorrow to prepare for

 AMERICAN PLANS TO ENSL111E INDIA:
 Not lone ago the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development,
 which is under American con-crol, granted India another loan.  The purpose
 of this loan, like the previous one, is to shackle the Indian economy to
 the American monopolists still more tightly.
 By lending their dollars at an enslaving rate of .interest, the imper-
 ialist sharks are striving to turn India into an appendage supplying agri-
 cultural produce and raw materials, and into a market for shop-worn 2ooas.
 American plans for enslaving India are disguised by hypocritical talk about
 aid to under-developed areas.
 The real aims of this American policy have been exposed in the Indian
 Press.  Thus the newspaper Searchlight -wrote that this aim is a smokescreen
 for preparations to convert South-East Asia into a theatre of military
 operations, regardless of whether the people want this or not.  American
 policy is aimed at preserving the colonial regime in India, at subjugating
 the country to the interests of the American monopolists.    -
 This is borne out by the fact that the loans granted to India are used
 primarily on measures facilitating exports of raw materials from the country,
 and on India's conversion into a military vantage ground.  The loans are
 granted on shackling terms and a canditinn.of unceremonious interference in
 the country's internal affairs.
 .     The Indian newspaper, Bharat Joti, recently wrote that American investors
 of capital demand from the Indian Government the same...rights as those enjoyed
 by Indian capitalists.  Like their British colleagues, the American imper-
 ialists are trying to fill their pockets by exploiting the Indian working
 people.
 At the end of last year, Indian and American industrialists met for a
 conference at Delhi.  The demands whicr_ the American monopolists formulated
 at that conference give a clear idea of the true aims of American so-called
 "aid" to India.
 These demands have been discussed by the British Daily Worker.  What
 they boil dawn to is permission to take profits out of India freely, guaran-
 tees against any form of nationalisation, and the preservation of so-called
 nternai stgbili-ty.  The last requirement means suppression of trade unions
 and other organisations and a further increase in the terror and policy of
 reprisals.
 It is perfectly clear that should all these requirements be fulfilled,
 the American monopolists would have unlimited-oI-)portuni ties for interfering
 not only in Indian economic affairs, but  in the administration of the country
 as well.  In short, this would lead to India's conversion into a colony not
 only of the British, but of the American monopolists as well.
 Under pressure from their senior partners, the Marshallised British
 colonialists are forced to move out and make room for American capital in
 India.  This is illustrated by the f :>11 wing facts.  Before the war the U.S.
 accounted for )nly 601 of India's imports.  In ' the year 1948 the figure
 reached 2i4..61.
 The penetration of American capital into India is increasing colonial
 exploitation in the country.  The American monopolists want to use India,with
 its enormous po?ulation of millions, and its vast natural wealth, for their
 aggressive aims of achieving world domination.  They are out to turn India
 into a base for suppressing the national liberation movements of the peoples
 of Asia.  All this spells fresh misery for the people of India.
 In conducting this ^,olicy, entirely against the interests of the people,
 the British and American imperialists share a common language with the Indian
 reactionaries.  It is an open secret, for instance, that at the Colpmbo' confer-
 ence of A reign Ministers it was decided that the countries of the British Empire
 would give Burma a loan of ?7,500,000 for suppressing the people's movement.
 It is also common knowledge that battalions of Gurkhas from India and Paki-
 stan are taking part in suppressing the movement in Malaya.  To ,)lease the Bri-
 tish and American imperialists,; the Indian Government has concluded an agreement
 with the Mabaraoaa of Nepal to recruit Gurkhas for suppressing democratic move-
 ments, both in India and abroad.  (Moscow Radio Voice English 2015-hrs 22 May)

 The  commentary on Peking
 Radio last night was the For-
 eign. Office statement on dip-
 lomatic relations between Bri-
 tain and China, as it appears
 on this page.  -  Editor..
 On January 6, 1950, the British
 Government presented a Note to Foreign
 Minister Chou En-lai, expressing a desire
 to establish diplomatic relations with
 the People's Republic of Cnina on a basis
 of equality, mutual benefit and mutual
 respect for territory and sovereignty.
 The British Government on the same
 day also announced its. withdrawal of re-
 cognition from,., the remnant reactionary
 clique of the Chinese Kuomintang.
 On January 9, Foreign Minister Chou
 En-lai replied to this Note, expressing
 willingness to establisti diplomatic rela-
 tions between Cnina and Great Britain.
 And furthermore, on January 28, he accepted Mr. Hutchison, Charge
 d'Affaires ad Interim, as nominee of the British Government for, the purpose
 of coming to Peking as its representative to conduct negotiations on preli-
 minary and procedural questions concert-ling es,tablisrvnent of, diplomatic
 relations.
 After Representative Hutchison arrived at Peking, negotiations on
 establishment of diplomatic relations formally began on March 2.  During
 the course of the ne=gotiations, the Central People's Government verbally
 mentioned to the British representative that a "question which was most
 important and which must first. be settled was the relationship between the
 British Government and the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuo-
 mintan.
 The Central Peoplo-'. Government considered that the action of the
 British representatives in m.hstaining from voting in regard to..the right
 of Chinese representatives on the United Nations, and the -:uestion of what
 actually vra:. the attitude of the British Government to,.-rards various organisa-
 tions of .iris remnant reactionary clique of the Kuomintang and the national
 properties and assets of China in Great Britain, Hong,,g ong and territories
 subject to Great Britain, as all pertaining to the question of relationship
 between the British Goverment and the remnant reactionary clique of the
 Chinese Kuomintang.  Therefore, the Central People's Government wished the
 British Goverment to clarify its position with re gaiTl to these two questions.
 The British Government on March 17, through a verbal reply by Represent-
 ative Hutchison,   made some explanations with regard to the attitude of
 the British Government on the above two questions. . The Central People's
 Government considered that this explanation was not satisfactory.
 In actuality, the Th iti sh Government has for five months consistently
 abstained on the question of the right of Chinese representation In all the
 subsidiary orgia-,isations of the United. Nations.
 Also, -,' i th regard to planes no:isr at iionggkon r, -i,rhich are directly in the
 possession and protection of tiro airlines (China National Aviction~Coxpor-
 ation and the Central Air Transport Corporation of 'trio Civil Aeronautics
 Bureau of China), the British authorities at Hongkong not only have obstructed
 in many ways their flight to Com a, but have also failed to assume their real
 responsibility in protectin, the Manes, to the extc;nt ti .it seven of them nave
 met with destruction.
 All such facts sufficiently indicate; that the British Government has not
 been able to demonstrate by its real actions that it has actually severed

 completely its relationship with the remnant reactionary clique of the
 Chinese Ku.Qmintangg, and also -that it has not paid sufficient respect to the
 rights of national properties and assets of the Central People's Government
 aad its right to manage its properties and assets.
 Therefore, the Central People's Government, on May 8, gave a special
 Note to Representative Hutchison for transmission to the British Government,
 asking it to clarify further its position with regard to the following two
 questions - the right of Chinese representation on the United Nations and
 the rights of Chinese national_ properties and assets.
 But on the clay following tt e. notification, _that_i: s on May 9, the British
 Government even ?ordered.,the Hongkong Court tc detain the 10 planes of the
 CNAC and CATC, vrni ch were on Hongk.ong's Kaitak airfield.   Ttiis action not
 only proved that the British Government-did not respect the rights of national
 properties and assets of the Central People's Government, and its right to
 manage its properties and 'assets, i)ut also rclare ented i n actuality an
 extremely unfriendly attitude towards the People's Republic of China.
 The British Government, on the one hand, expressed a desire to establish
 diplomatic relations bet-men China and Great Britain.  On the other hand,
 after expressing this desire, again and again it demonstrated that it had not
 in reality completely severed its relationship with the remnant reactionary
 clique of the Chinese Kuomintang.
 The Central Pe:~~le's Government of the People's Reoublic of China consi-
 clers that it is c,om;?letely necessary to ask the British Government to clarify
 further again its position with regard to the central question of these in-
 . rcnaistencies 'between declaration and action,

 EXPORTS FROM SOUTH CHINA RISE
 WILE IMPORTS PALL:
 South China exports exceeded imports by three times in inril.  The declared
 value of goods approved for export was 86  of the total exports from January to
 the end of March, and was unusually high in any single month, even for the last
 tun years.  In giving those estimates, the Nanfany Daily of Canton cites the
 general price stability as the principal cause.
 The bulk of the exports were vegetables and
 34.81    The rest liras made up of
 te.; and fabrics.
 Total imports in April -.sere 37.3'' of the January figures.  Chief items
 imported were gasoline, rubber and rubber g ods, and soap which made  up 34-17'
 of  too total.   Foods and medicine -sore 17.24. - and cotton and cotton goods, 15.9
 The rest ;-rerc chemicals,clyootuffs,,  trucks and gunny sacks.
 Confidence in the people's currency resulted from general improvements
 after the nation's  economy and finance came under unified control in ?arch.  The
 rate of forei r'n exchange was maintained at a cnnatan  level, resulting in too
 foreign exchange proceeds of exporters bcin~ channelled either through Government
 banks or banks dosign ited by Govorronent.  The official exchange rate was hi grior
 than the blacknarket rate ter.oughout the month.
 On the other hand, the steady decline in prices contributed to a decrease
 in the volume of imports.   Formerly, imported goods mere hoarded by speculators,

 TOO MUCH Sl'.JCE GIVT+ T TO COT\TFr,:L;TTCE NE'33 ?N D1,ILY /pE,:S:
 It has been found that newspapers devote to much space to publication
 of conference news and act ivit ics of organisst ions.
 1lecordinl to investigations made, publication of confer ' ncc news in
 t ebruary occupied about l+0 ' of the space  in the various newspapers, while
 in L pr it only a slight modif icat inn was made.     1 or example in the Honan
 Daily Nevis, the Nanf an  Daily News, the S inhua La ily News  of Chungking
 and the Tsinan Pe   cis Daily conference news alone occupied about 20 to
 30,   of newspaper space.
 Hence, it has been decided that newspapers should devote less space
 to publication of conference news.
 But there are some important confereneesvihieh deserve attention,  For
 example, the news of the first llepresentativec Conference in Munchenghsien
 published by the Iiopci   ily News on 11pril 3,which carried important news of
 the plans made by the farmers in producing for the country, the rood results
 achieved, their activities and li.velihoocd, and the history of their past
 are worth while publishing.
 hat really should be  omitted arc unimportant ryews items such as the
 places at which certain conferences arc scheduled to be held, the ntunber
 and names of the people present at these conferences, the subjects discussed.
 These defects are often found in the Tsinan People's Dail,y,and the
 Honan Daily News, whose reports on the first Stucent's Representative
 Conference in Sh of ung and the f i_ st People's Representative Conference
 in Honan, respectively, did not carry important facts from the conferences.
 Vdhat was published in these -,apers were those unimportant news items anent ioned
 above.
 Newspapers should take note of the f olloviing point  while reporting
 on conference news:-  Do not report on all conference news, but select those
 items which hove a direct connect i )n with the people, and have a direct
 bearing on the people's livelihood.

 The Soviet Peace Committee has issued a statement expressing its great
 indignation  at. the French Government's persecution of the Academician,
 Professor Jol iot-Curie, Nobel Prize winner and Chairman of the Paris Committee
 of the k;'orld. Peace Congress.
 During the many yssrs he has devoted to science, Joliot-Curie, a great
 humanitarian and. courageous fighter for universal pence, has repeatedly
 declared that the use of atonic energy for peacetime purposes opened up
 brilliant vistas to mankind.  1.'c are deeply convinced, he said, that the
 peaceful use of atomic energy will. be of decisive significance in raising
 the well-be ing of mankind.
 Then the warmongers began using the discoveries of nuclear physics for
 their cruel plans of fomenting a new war, Joliot-Curie, as a true progressive
 scientist of our clay, understood that he must fight in the ranks of those
 who wanted the achievements of science to be used for purposes of peace, not
 for the selfish interests of beasts of prey, not for unleashing war.
