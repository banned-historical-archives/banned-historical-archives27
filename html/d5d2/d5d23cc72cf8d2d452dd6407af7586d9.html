 ISLAM IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 I.  The Moslem Peoples of China
 Although the contrary view may be widely held, China is
 not a nation inhabited by a single people speaking a single
 language,.  While 90 to 95 per cent of the total population
 are Han Chinese (i.e., Chinese proper), the remainder com-
 prise an intricate mosaic of races, languages, cultures and
 religions.  The Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-shek
 fostered the theory-that China was inhabited by a single
 Chunghua (Chinese) nation; but the Communists, led by Chen
 15o-ta, a leading Communist theoretician, have realistically
 admitted China's character as a multinational state.  Various
 Chinese Communist sources have noted the existence of over
 60 minority nationalities, ranging from 1,000 Olunchuns to
 more than six million Chuangs, while the Academica Sinica
 has recorded 34 languages for research purposes.
 The present regime recognizes ten Moslem nationalities:
 Hui, 1~ Uighur, Kazakh, Kirghiz, Tajik, Tatar, Uzbek, Tunghsiang,
 Paoan, ./ and Sala (or Salar), each with its own culture, his-
 tory, traditions, and language. /                                Official Communist sources
 indicate that they number approximately ten million, distributed
 as follows:
 Hui
 3,559,350
 Tunghsiang
 140, 00.0
 Uighur
 3,64o,125
 Salar
 30,000
 Kazakh
 470,000
 Uzbek
 13,000
 Kirghiz
 80,000
 Tatar
 6,000
 Tajik
 15,000
 Paoan
 k,ooo
 It is impossible to say how accurate these figures are since
 no reliable census of Moslems has ever been taken.         Almost
 every writer on the subject has his own idea as to China's
 Moslem population and very seldom do their figures agree, vary-
 ing from less than 10 million to as high as 50 million.  The
 latter figure is that generally cited by Moslem writers.2/ and
 by Moslem Chinese themselves, although Chinese Moslem spokes-
 men today dutifully echo the 10 million figure officially
 recognized by the regime.  In between are such estimates as.

 15 million by Forman, 9 18 million by Bodde,    and 23 mil-
 lion by Lindbeck.
 Roughly half of China's Moslems are located in the five
 northwestern provinces of Sinkiang, Kansu, Chinghai, Ninghsia
 and Shensi, where they comprise about half of the total popu-
 lation.  The greatest concentration is in Sinkiang where al-
 most 94 per cent of the people are Moslem, with the Uighurs
 alone accounting for 74 per cent of the whole.  The remainder
 are scattered throughout the land, with every province with-
 out exception having its Moslem colony, either small or
 large. In Yunnan Province, in southwest China, is the second
 largest concentration, where they account for about 25 per
 cent of the total population of the province. /  Peking, the
 capital, counts more than 70,000, served by 49 mosques; Mukden,
 in Manchuria, with 40,000 Moslems and eight large mosques, is
 virtually a Moslem city; in Shanghai are to be found 120,000
 believers with 14 cathedral mosques.  Similarly, every other
 large city has its own colony.  That in Canton, numbering
 2,500, is said to be the oldest in China, dating back to Arab
 contacts with Tang China In the seventh century.
 As was mentioned above, the Uighurs are concentrated in
 Sinkiang, where they form a majority.  The Kazakhs and Tatars
 are found chiefly in the Ashan, Ili, Tacheng, Urumchi and Hami
 areas of that province, with other Kazakh groups being located
 in Minho hsien of Chinghai.  The Kirghiz and Uzbeks inhabit
 various hsien in Sinkiang, while the Tajiks are chiefly in the
 Puli, Soche,Wand Pucheh hsien of the Pamir plateau in Sinkiang.
 The Tunghsiangs and Salars are chiefly to be found in the
 K:ansu-Chinghai border area, while the Paoans live in areas
 near Tibet.  The Hui comprise the greater majority of Moslems
 elsewhere in China.
 The 10 nationalities mentioned above represent several
 racial strains.  The Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kirghiz, Uzbeks and
 'Tatars are of Turkish stock akin to the people=s of Soviet Cen-
 tral Asia, and speak related Turkic dialects,  The Tajiks are
 Iranian and are related to the people of Sovie't Tadzhikistan.
 The Salars are descendants of lnunigrants from :Samarkand, while
 the Paoans are Tibetans.  The Hui are essentially Chinese by
 race but, in many cases, with a considerable admixture of
 other racial strains:   Turkish, Arab and Mongolian.  In north-
 vest China, it might be noted, Moslems who are Chinese by
 language and culture, as well as by race, are-known as Tunganoj

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 and between them and other Moslems as well as Han Chinese
 there is a latent antipathy which has, in the past, fre-
 quently flared into open conflict.
 Aside from their common faith, Chinats Moslems are solidi-
 fied by occupational factors, for they have monopolized jade
 work and the fur trade, animal husbandry, horse-dealing and
 butchering.  They provide most carters, muleteers, and
 cameleers, and are said to be the best restauranteurs and
 inn-keepers in China.  In matters of dress, lO-  manners and
 customs, Moslems--especially the Hui--are frequently indis-
 tinguishable from other Chinese; often the avoidance of pork--
 a favorite food with Han Chinese--is the only major difference
 between them and the Han peoples.
 Isolated from the main body of Islam for many centuries
 the Chinese Moslems have developed along their own lines, quite
 untouched by influences affecting the rest of Islam, and have
 become quite lax in matters of religious observances.  The
 Five Pillars of the Faith are still recognized and.observed
 but not always in a manner that would be regarded as orthodox
 by other Moslems.  This isolation has also served to make
 them immune to any attraction by the Pan-Islam concept, which
 for them has no meaning.  As elsewhere in the Moslem World
 there is no cleric hierarchy.  Each mosque is independent,
 and the Moslems are in reality only a collection of separate
 congregations bound together by a common creed.  The idea of
 a caliph is meaningless to the Chinese Moslem; to him the
 highest earthly spiritual authority is his own ahung. 2,11
 In matters of faith, Chinese Moslems are all Sunnites,
 with some Sufi influences, who follow the Hanafi school of
 law.  But while all are Sunnites, they are divided into a num-
 ber of sects which differ as to how prescribed Sunni rituals
 should be practiced.  The "Old Sect" is the most conservative
 and, at the same time, most lax in dietary and moral habits.
 The "New Sect," already several hundred years old, tends to
 be more mystical and more ritualistic, opposing such things
 as opium smoking and wine drinking which the Old Sect is in-
 clined to overlook.  Other differences can be adduced.   In
 general, the New Sect insists on a return to traditional
 Islamic ways, while the Old Sect prefers the modified customs
 and forms which have developed in China during the centuries
 of isolation.  Thus, the New Sect insists that a chapter of
 the Koran be recited only once instead of three times as held
 by the Old Sect; that at prayer clasped hands should be raised

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 once instead of twice; that after meals there is no need to
 raise clasped hands in greeting; and that in singing the
 praises of Allah the voice should be low instead of high.
 The New Sect does not allow any substitutefor an shun  in
 preaching while the Old Sect does.  Finally, the two groups
 disagree on the proper basis for calculating the ritual fast-
 ing period, the New Sect adhering strictly to-the Arab method,
 the Old Sect following the Chinese lunar calendar.
 A third main group, known as the Modern Sect, was founded
 about 80 years ago by a reformer who declat'ed himself to be
 Christ returned to earth to prepare for the return of Mohammed.
 It is the most liberal of the three.  In education it stresses
 religious ethics rather than the traditional memorizing of
 the Koran, and in the interpretation of the Koran maintains
 that the spirit rather than the letter should be observed.
 In personal habits it advocates modernism,' such as the wearing
 of European clothes.
 In the northwest area there also are many small sects, for
 example, the "Brand New Sect" and a number of Sufi orders such
 as the Che-ho-yeh (Jariyah). 12
 II.  Communist Policies
 A.   Minority Policy
 Under the Kuomintang regime the Moslems as well as other
 non-Han peoples were frequently oppressed End persecuted as
 a result of the KMT policy of Sinofication.  The Communist
 regime has been less harsh in this respect, for it has pursued
 a deliberate policy of recognizing the existence and seeking
 the support of the many minority groups.  The Moslems have
 profited thereby since the Reds treat them, not only as a
 religious minority but also as minority nationalities..  Thus
 they have escaped the harsh treatment accorded to Christians,
 whom the regime is apparently determined to reduce to impotence
 if not eradicate completely.  Even the Buddhists, except in
 Tibet and adjacent areas, have been subjected to pressures
 which the Moslems have thus far escaped.
 The Communist Chinese policy toward minorities is based
 on the early Russian nationalities policy (before it was cor-
 rupted and perverted by Great Russian chauvinism) and on
 Stalints two sets of theses on the nationality problem as
 Approvea    Release
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 accepted by the X and XII Congresses of the CPSU in 1921 and
 1923.  The Common Program of the Chinese Peoplets Political
 Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which guided the policies
 of the CCP until the promulgation of a constitution in 1954,
 explicitly declares that all minorities are to be free to
 develop their own national languages, customs, religions
 and traditions, and states in Article 51 that:
 Regional autonomy shall be exercised in areas where
 national minorities are concentrated and various kinds
 of autonomy organizations shall be set up according to
 the size of the respective populations and regions.
 In places where different nationalities live together
 and in the autonomous areas of the national minorities,
 the different nationalities shall each have an appropriate
 number of representatives in the local organs of poli-
 tical power.
 During the period in which the Communists were winning
 China from the Nationalist regime, they were careful to respect
 the rights of minorities.  Upon entering areas inhabited by
 Moslems, Communist soldiers received special instructions to
 respect Moslem beliefs and customs, to avoid molestation of
 mosques and priests, and to avoid disturbing religious beliefs.
 Care also was taken to avoid feeding pork to Moslem units,
 while arrangements were made for Moslem soldiers to observe
 their religious obligations without hindrance.
 The new Constitution of the Chinese People's Republic, ap-
 proved for promulgation on 14 June 1954, repeats the essential
 features of the Common Program.   Sections 2 and 3 of Article
 3 guarantee equal treatment to all nationalities, prohibit
 race discrimination, racial oppression, and activities that
 would destroy the friendly unity among them, and assure them
 the right to develop their own language and to preserve or
 reform their own customs and religion.   Section 4 of the same
 article provides that national minorities are to have regional
 autonomy in areas where they are predominant.  It is made clear,
 however, that these areas are inseparable parts of China and
 that the first loyalty of every citizen is to the People's
 Republic.
 The minorities policy is carried out by the Nationalities
 Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress, 14  which
 works closely with the CCP and the People's Revolutionary Military

 Council.  The Commission holds periodic conferences of repre-
 sentatives from various national areas to consider their
 problems, but its most important task is to train Red cadres
 from minority groups, whose duty it is to insure party con-
 trol in their areas. 25   Within the State Council, or cabi-
 net, there is also a Religious Affairs Bureau headed by Ho
 Cheng-hsiang.  No information as to its mission is available,
 but it presumably handles. government policy toward religious
 groups, which would include Islamic as well as Christian,
 !Buddhist and others.
 The policy directed by the above groups have fostered, as
 in the Soviet Union, the creation of individual alphabets (for
 those languages previously without one), the publication of
 !books in national languages, and the organization of dance
 and art groups and other cultural activities. Medical care
 and communications in minority areas have been improved, and
 schools--primary, secondary, and advanced--established.   In
 !Peking there is now a Central Institute for Nationalities,
 while eight subordinate Institutes for Nationalities have been
 establ.ished throughout the country.
 !B.  Benefits to Moslems
 In the wooing of minority groups, the Moslems apparently
 have been. especially favored.  Mosques have been exempted from
 real estate taxes, while those of historical importance have
 been repaired at government expense.  On 6 ,December 1950, the
 government issued a special order remitting the slaughter tax
 on cows and sheep killed by Moslems in connection with the
 celebration of the birthday of the Prophet and'?'the festivals
 of Shakar Bairam.(Id al-Fitr) and Qorban Bairam (Id al-Adha).
 ,During these same festivals state-owned stores and cooperative
 !trading agencies gave special discounts to Moslems on such
 items as beef, mutton, rice, flour, tea, sugar and cloth. This
 favoritism apparently was not confined to festivals since
 Moslems in Peking reportedly were given adequate supplies of
 beef and mutton in the winter of 1953 even thotLgh there was a
 general meat shortage.
 By government order, no Moslem student, worker or state
 employee is forced to work on a, Moslem religious holiday.
 !During the 1955 Bairams, Moslems were given a three-day holi
 !day.  At every state banquet and representative assembly there
 ,are special tables with Moslem food.  The same convenience is

 also provided at many railway stations.
 In the cultural field the Moslems have also made gains.
 In Peking an Institute of Islamic Theology has been established
 and also an Institute for Hui People which has more than one
 thousand students.  The students at the Central Institute for
 Nationalities as well as at the subordinate regional insti-
 tutes are largely Moslem.  Moslems are also free to enter
 any other school.  Mosques reportedly have been allowed to
 retain their religious schools.  The Nationalities Publishing
 House is issuing a steady stream of publications in Moslem
 minority languages, although most of them are translations
 of Communist texts.  Sinkiang has eight newspapers and three
 periodicals in Uighur and five newspapers in Kazakh.  Both
 languages are now being used for radio broadcasts, and Uighur
 for the Sinkiang telegraphic service as well as on currency.
 C.  Disadvantages to Moslems
 All this is not to say that the Moslems are free or that
 their customs and beliefs have not been affected by the Com-
 munist regime.  Take marriage for example.  The new marriage
 law of 1 May 1950 provides for marriage "based on free choice
 of partners, on monogamy, on equal rights for both sexes" and
 prohibits "polygamy, concubinage, child betrothal, interference
 with the remarriage of widows, and the exaction of money or
 gifts in connection with marriage."  These provisions strike
 at many facets of Moslem marriage practices.  Moslems in China
 as elsewhere practiced polygamy.  Parents also arranged mar-
 riages, now forbidden, and betrothed their children, which is
 now forbidden. 16   The institution of bride-price or of
 dowery was likewise observed.  The Koran also lays down certain
 restrictions as regards remarriage, which presumably can no
 longer be enforced among Moslem societies.
 A more fundamental tenet of Islamic society everywhere--
 that no Moslem, particularly no Moslem girl, should marry out-
 side the faith--is also apparently under attack.  The govern-
 ment reportedly was encouraging Red cadres, in early 1954, to
 marry Moslems and, if such marriages were opposed by parents,
 to. cite the provisions of the marriage law.  Between January
 and July 1954, 40 such marriages are said to have occurred in
 the Harbin area alone.  This would appear to be part of the
 Communist policy to disrupt the traditional family relation-
 ship and might well, were it pushed far and long enough, result
 in the absorption of the Moslem minorities.

 Although, as already noted, Moslem dietary laws appear
 to be tolerated and even abetted, the following incident
 reportedly occurred.  The Peking regime deoreed that animals
 should be electrocuted before being slaughtered.  This pro-
 cedure makes the meat unclean according to-the rules pre-
 scribed by the Koran, and in February 195+. Moslems in Peking,
 Mukden and Harbin protested against the ruling in vain.  It
 is probable that the decree had little effect in the heavily
 Moslem areas of northwest China, where many of the Moslems
 are animal raisers and therefore probably slaughter their
 own meat.  However, as those areas become industrialized and
 modernized, more and more Moslems may be forced to eat meat
 which according to their religions precepts is unclean.
 Refugees who have escaped from Sinkiang and various under-
 ground reports from China indicate that the Communists have
 closed down many mosques and seized them for use as museums,
 stores or barracks.  Religious courts also:are reported to
 have been abolished.  It is difficult jo eQtaluate these reports
 on the state of Islam in China, for Moslem;''.. spokesmen such as
 Burhan and Mohammed Makien continually are' stressing the free,
 dom with which Moslems practice their faith, and in this they
 are supported by many Moslems from other countries who have
 visited Red China in recent years.
 The explanation may well lie in the existence of different
 sets of circumstances in Sinkiang and in the rest of China
 were foreigners are allowed to travel.  Very few Westerners
 have seen Sinkiang since the Communist take-over, but reports
 have filtered out that the province today is controlled by
 the Soviets rather than the Chinese Communists and that the
 garrison troops, for example, belong to tho Red Army rather
 than to the Chinese Communist Army.   If this is true, it may
 well be that the Soviets are applying in Sinkiang the same
 type of campaign they applied in the Moslem areas of the
 Soviet Union, where the Moslem clergy has been largely elimin
 ated and the majority of mosques closed.
 Although the Chinese Communists deprecate religion, they
 have not announced an avowed campaign against religion as
 such or launched any organized drive to persuade Moslems to
 abandon their faith. IV  There is, however, evidence that the
 Peking regime is attempting to control the-content of mosque
 sermons.   In 1953 the regime assigned a Moslem (presumably a
 reliable Communist) secretary to each mosgiie in Peking to
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 observe and report on all activities.  Each week, before the
 Friday sermon, the secretary gave the chief priest a copy
 of the weekts important news, received from his superiors,
 which the priest was expected to incorporate into his sermon.
 The sermon itself had to be prepared in advance and submitted
 to the secretary for approval who was frequently asked by the
 chief priest to prepare it.  Available information does not
 indicate whether this system is still in effect or whether
 it is peculiar to the Peking area.
 The Communists also are making plans to control future
 Moslem clerics.  Those graduated by the new Institute of Is-
 lamic Theology will be well indoctrinated.   In early 1953 the
 regime ordered each mosque in Peking to select and send one
 student to a course of study at the Peking Moslem College,
 who, after graduation, would return to the original mosque
 to preach.  Two principal qualifications for selection were
 listed:   clear-mindedness and progressiveness; but nothing
 was said about proficiency in Arabic, which any qualified
 Moslem cleric must have..  From early 1953 to July 1954, the
 government reportedly sent 60 Moslems, in groups of 20, to
 the USSR for training.
 III. Moslem Resistance
 From the Yenan days the CCP has made strenuous efforts
 to attract the support of Chinats Moslems. 18    Success con-
 sistently eluded the Communists.   Since ach eving power in
 1949, the Reds have made considerable concessions to that
 same end, and there are indications that complete success has
 still not been attained.  Their parallel attempts to impose
 control and Communist discipline on people whose faith and
 discipline is already strong has created difficulties not
 encountered elsewhere.
 Islamic exclusiveness based on claims of absolute religious
 truth and social values, buttressed by prohibition against
 marriage outside the faith, aloofness from religious and social
 activities of others, a self-segregated pattern of social life,
 and a well-developed solidarity and communal self-sufficiency
 makes friendly cooperation between Moslems and Chinese possible
 only on Moslem terms.  Yet such aloofness is detrimental to
 China's national unity and modernization.  In order to carry
 through national programs of reform, education and reconstruction
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 and to meet external ideological and military threats, the
 activities of all groups in China need to be and are being
 collectivized and brought under national control.
 Although the Communists may have won political and mili-
 tary control over Chinats Moslem areas,, they have still to
 solve the problem of defining the status of Chinats Moslems
 and reconciling their aspirations and interests with their
 own demands.  The Communists refuse torecognize the unique
 role of religion, which serves China's-Moslems not only as
 a basis for communal life, but also as the critical differ-
 entiating factor between the Chinese-speaking Moslems and
 other Chinese and as the primary unifying force among the
 culturally and racially diverse peoples in China who are ad-
 herents to Islam.  For ideological reasons the Communists
 are unable to offer the Moslems real religious freedom.  They
 are willing to respect certain forms of religious beliefs
 and habits of individuals and groups, but they cannot accept
 a religiously ordered society without forgetting the establish-
 ment of their own political and economic system.  This. they
 are unwilling to do.  It is cultural diversity, not Islam, which
 the Communists are willing to champion.
 The Communists have not been able to solve the problem of
 the status of China's Moslems because the primary aim of
 their policies has been to promote their own power.  Communist
 policies. to win the voluntary support of the Moslems are inade-
 quate because they are designed not to advance the interests
 of the Moslems but to use the Moslems.  Only if Communists
 were willing to frame a, broader program to safeguard religious
 unity and the racial diversity of the Moslems, could they suc-
 ceed in reconciling Moslem interests arid those of the CCP.
 Minority autonomy provides no solution  for such autonomy,
 if it is to be real and meaningful, is"only possible after
 the Moslems have become loyal and participating members of
 the national state.
 Although committed to respecting the autonomy of Moslem
 groups (as national minorities rather than as Moslems as such),
 the Communists still consider them as integral parts of Chi-
 nese society and therefore subject to the laws of the .new
 regime.  While there is no available d4ta relative to this.
 particular point, the elimination of so-called people's enemies
 probably has proceeded apace in Moslem Mareas as in other parts
 of China.  Among the more than 20 million Chinese said to have
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 been subjected to hsiao mieh, i.e., liquidation, there have
 undoubtedly been a proportionate number of Moslems.  Forced
 delivery of crops and livestock, execution of landlords and
 rich peasants, and other aspects of Communist terror have
 been applied to them as to Han Chinese.  Sinkiang and other
 areas of northwest China have witnessed mass public trials
 and executions just as have the large cities and areas of
 Eastern China.
 There are indications that. the blood-letting has perhaps
 been even greater among Moslems.  The land reform class
 struggle has lagged behind in Moslem areas.  The Communists
 made some provision for Moslem sentiments in this regard,
 but the concession made was not sufficient to prevent Moslem
 peasants from opposing other aspects of the program and from
 refusing to join in the persecution and condemnation of fel-
 low Moslems who fell into the Communist classification of
 "rich" peasants.  The Moslem areas also have been involved
 in reports of revolt and.resistance.  The largest open rebel-
 lion yet admitted by the Reds since they seized power was
 staged by more than 20,000 Moslems in Kansu Province between
 April and July 1952, where the rebels killed over 3,000 party
 cadres, civilians and military officers before being put
 down. 20
 The same area was also the scene of a serious revolt in
 1950.  On 28 March of'that year, a congress of 1,000 Kazakh
 leaders at Barkol proclaimed an autonomous Kazakh government
 with Janim Khan as governor and Osman Batur as military com-
 mander.  In mid-April, Communist forces swept down on Barkol
 and more than 12,600 of the 15,000 assembled Kazakhs were
 killed, captured, or dispersed.  Janim Khan was captured
 shortly thereafter and taken to Urumchi where he was publicly
 executed in February 1951.  Osman Batur met the same fate two
 months later. 21
 As a result of these incidents and of general dislike of
 the Communist regime, thousands of Kazakhs, as well as other
 Moslem tribesmen, have attempted to escape from Sinkiang to
 India, over the fearsome mountain barriers.  Of one group of
 22,000, only 3,000 reached safety in Kashmir.  Those who
 have reached the outside world tell of thousands of others
 who have died in the attempt from cold and hunger or at the
 hands of Communist soldiers.  They also tell of other thousands
 who would make the attempt if opportunity presented itself.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 Reports of these refugees and of their leaders such as
 Mohammed Amin Bughra, former Deputy Governor of Sinkiang,
 and Yusuf Isa Aliptakin, although perhaps-somewhat colored
 and exaggerated, make it quite clear that the Red reign of
 terror has not bypassed the Moslem areas. 22   The specific
 oppressive measures are probably neither more stringent nor
 more lenient than for the rest of China; it is only that
 Moslem resistance is greater and more tenacious.
 IV.  Regional Autonomy
 The Chinese Communists have resolutely pushed the autonomy
 program outlined in the Common Program and in the Constitution,
 so that today the administrative boundaries of the country
 present a complex array of autonomous regions (ch'u), districts
 p(chou) and counties (hsien) mingled with regular a   nistra-
 tTve-units.-  As of 19 5~,hina had 22 provinces, three autono-
 mous regions (Inner Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Tibet), and the
 centrally administered.cities of Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai.
 The provinces and autonomous regions, in turn, were divided
 into 25 autonomous chou, 2,100 hsien or equivalent units,
 about 50 autonomous hsien, and about 170 cities under provin-
 cial jurisdiction.
 Among the autonomous areas are many inhabited by Moslem
 peoples; for example, Tunghsiang and Paoan'areas.in Kansu;
 Hui areas in Kansu, Chinghai and Suiyan; Kazakh and Kirghiz
 areas in Sinkiang; as well as a number of others in addition
 to those with mixed populations.  The autonomy 'accorded, how-
 ever, would seem to be more apparent than real, for most
 minority group officials have empty title s' and no power.
 The official Communist organ People's Daily admitted on 9 Sep-
 tember 1953 that it was common.pce for minorities not to
 be consulted by governmental organs dealing with their affairs
 and that often governors at a higher level ignored the autono-
 mous areas under them.
 Toward the end of 1949 the Peking regime inaugurated a
 system of regional governments, apparently designed to bind
 provincial governments closer to Peking and to aid in over-
 coming the handicaps which China's vast size, imperfect com-
 munications and general backwardness placed in the way of
 centralized administration,  Five regional areas were created
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 including that of Northwest China which embraced the five
 provinces of Sinkiang, Kansu, Chinghai, Ninghsia and Shensi.
 Under the previous system of regular provincial governments
 Moslems could rightfully expect to exercise control in
 Sinkiang, perhaps also in Kansu and/or Chinghai.  But within
 the area encompassed in the new regional government they
 represented something less than half the total population
 and were therefore condemned to function within that area
 and its centralized government as a permanent minority.
 The situation improved in June 1954 when the regional
 administrative areas were abolished.  On 1 O-ctobe.r 1954, the
 province of Sinkiang was proclaimed the Sinkiang Uighur Autono-
 mous Region, with Uighurs serving as chairman and a majority
 of the members of the Region's People's Council.  As an autono-
 mous region, it has the same status as a province but with
 additional powers.  It can, for example, with the approval of
 the State Council in Peking, set up governmental bodies through
 which local autonomy can be exercised including the administra-
 tion of its own finances and public security forces.  Autonomy
 for non-Uighur peoples is assured by five autonomous chou and
 six autonomous hsien within the Region's borders.
 It is extremely doubtful that the province's new status
 has materially helped its inhabitants.  The political,leaders
 are still subject to Communist orders--Saifudin, chairman of
 the Peoplets Council is a CCP member--and if Peking is not
 exercising firm control there, it appears that the Soviets
 are,
 V.  Moslem Participation in Government
 Moslems have not been conspicuous by their presence at the
 highest levels of government in Communist China.  The most
 influential Moslem is perhaps Saifudin, formerly vice-chairman
 of the Sinkiang provincial government, who today is chairman
 of the People's Council of the Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous
 Region, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Na-
 tional People's Congress, and one of the two Moslem members of
 the State Council.  Sharing honors with Saifudin is Burhan,
 who today is chairman of the China Islamic Association and
 who in the past has served as chairman of the Sinkiang pro-
 vincial government and as vice-chairman of the Nationalities
 Affairs Commission of the CPPCC.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 The second Moslem member of the State Council is Liu
 Ke-ping, who also holds the posts of chairman of the Nation-
 alities Affairs Commission of the National-People's Congress
 and of chairman of the China Hui Cultural 4ssociation.  Other
 prominent Moslems are Sheikh Nur Mohammed  Ta Pu-sheng), a
 vice-chairman of the China Islamic Association, who previously
 was a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC and served
 as a member of the Chinese delegation attending the Bandung
 Conference in April 1954; and Mohammed Maiden (Ma Chien), a
 professor of Arabic at Peking University and a graduate of
 Cairo's al-Azhar University.  He is a leading committee member
 of the China Islamic Association and also served as a member
 of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC.
 At the inception of the Communist regime, Moslems were
 represented in the CPPCC both in the "democratic religious
 circles" category (one delegate) and in the "minority nation-
 alities" group (four delegates).  The CPPCC's Nationalities
 Affairs Commission had three vice-chairmen of whom two were
 Moslem (a Hui and a Ui hur), and 22 ordinary members of whom
 18 were non-Chinese     Available information does not indicate
 the number of Moslems among those 18.)  When the First National
 People's Congress met in 1954, its membersincluded 41 Mos-
 lems.  Of the 85 members of its Nationalities Affairs Com-
 'mission, 16 were Moslems.
 On the local level in predominantly Moslem areas, the
 Islamic contingents are much greater; and in autonomous Mos-
 lem regions Moslems presumably constitute the greater majority
 of government officials.  Nevertheless, in~Communist China,
 as in the Soviet Union, there are few Moslems with national
 reputations or national responsibilities.
 VI.  Cultural Organizations
 Communist China is a country of organizations--numerous,
 large and varied.  The Communist leaders have found it exped-
 ient to accomplish their ends and to change the face and so-
 cial structure of China by working through an endless variety
 of "mass organizations."  Such groups as the New Democratic
 Youth, All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, All-China
 Students' Federation, Sino-Soviet Friendshi'  Association,
 All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Al-China Federation
 of Trade Unions, and countless others number their members
 in the millions.  The cooperative and peasants= associations
 reportedly have over 150 million members.
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 These mass organizations today command much of the leisure
 time of the Chinese citizen.  While there are no available
 figures on the breakdown of their memberships, these organi-
 zations probably include many Moslems.  Branches in an area
 like Sinkiang, for example, where virtually the entire popu-
 lation is Moslem, would have primarily Moslem members.
 The major purely Moslem organization is the China Islamic
 Association, 23  formally inaugurated on 9 May 1953.  The
 groundwork for the organization was laid at a Preparatory
 Conference in Peking on 27-31 July 1952, which had been called
 at the initiative of eight prominent Moslems, including
 Saifudin and Mohammed Makien.  This conference was attended
 by 53 delegates from all parts of the country and represented
 the various Moslem nationalities..  A k0-man preparatory com-
 mittee was elected, headed by Burhan, with the task of getting
 the new organization into operation.
 The China Islamic Association'is a lay organization designed
 "to help the people's government to implement the policy of
 religious belief as laid down in the Common Program," and
 "to develop love for the Motherland ... and participate in
 the movement for the defense of world peace.'  In practice
 the association serves as an agency for handling the racial,
 religious, cultural and political relations of Moslems with
 the Communist regime, and as a convenient propaganda instru-
 ment for improving Chinese relations with countries of the
 Moslem world.
 A second national Moslem organization is the China Hui
 Cultural Association, 24F  established on 14 May 1953, with
 the task of promoting the culture of the Hui people.  The May
 1953 conference which inaugurated the association, in a mes-
 sage addressed to Mao Tse-tung, expressed its mission in
 these words:   "The China Hui Cultural Association will assist
 the People's Government in the study and development of the
 culture and education of the Hui people through strengthening
 patriotic education and mobilizing the Hui people to acquire
 scientific knowledge, production know-how, and advanced pro-
 duction experiences so as more effectively to contribute
 themselves in the large-scale economic construction of the
 Fatherland, which has already begun."
 Both associations seem largely to serve political rather
 than cultural purposes, especially as regards China's rela-
 tions with countries of the Moslem World.  In its first two
 15

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 years of existence, the China Islamic Association was host
 to. leaders from the Near and Middle East and Africa on 15
 different occasions.  When foreign Moslem dignitaries are
 invited to China these guests, whether religious leaders,
 journalists, government leaders, labor leaders or business-
 men, are feted and guided by leaders of the two groups.
 Chinese cultural missions to Moslem countries are led by,
 or include as members, leaders of these groups; for example,
 the current Chinese delegation in the Middle East is headed
 by Burhan.
 Among China's numerous organizations are a number of
 "friendship associations."  Here, too, Moelem leaders are
 used when a Moslem country is concerned.  Burhan was a founder
 and currently serves as chairman of the China-Indonesia
 Friendship Association, while its. vice-chairmen include Ma
 Yu-huai, one of Burhants colleagues in the China Islamic As-
 sociation.  Liu Ke-ping and Ma Sung-ting,"chairman and vice-
 chairman respectively of the China Hui Cultural Association,
 fill the same posts in the China-Pakistan Friendship Associ-
 ation.
 .Another example of the propaganda use of these organiza-
 tions to curry favor among Moslems abroad'is the action of
 the second plenary committee meeting of the China Islamic
 Association in November 1955, attended byryl8k imams, mullahs
 and other leaders of the 10 Moslem nationalities, in adopting
 a resolution supporting independence for the Moslem peoples
 of North Africa.
 The leaders of the two associations a'e used to inform
 the Moslem World how free China is and hoif much religious
 , eking frequently
 freedom is accorded Moslems there.  Radio P
 broadcasts statements to this effect attrbuted to Chinese
 Moslem leaders, and the good relations which China enjoys
 with Moslem countries.  The diplomatic recognition recently
 extended by Egypt suggests that these propaganda efforts have
 not been entirely unsuccessful.
 Along strictly religious and cultural lines the two asso-
 ciations also have been active to a degree.  The China Islamic
 Association, for example, is charged with organizing the
 annual hajj to Mecca which in 1955 was led by Sheikh Nur
 Mohammed.    he association also was instr4mental in the estab-
 lishment in Peking of the Institute of Islamic Theology, and
 has. also arranged for the printing of a Chinese translation
 16
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 of the Koran.  In its first two years, the association held
 22 meetings of ?imams and other Moslems to discuss religious
 questions and to celebrate, with due publicity abroad, Mos-
 lem festivals.  Other activities include the translation of
 the new constitution into Arabic, the making of a documentary
 film on Moslem life in Peking, and the publication of a book
 depicting Moslem life in China.
 There is no available information regarding the specific
 activities of the China Hui Cultural Association.

 COMMUNIST DOCTRINE ON RELIG10N
 Summary:
 Recent events in Eastern Europe demonstrate clearly
 that the existence of a Communist state is incompatible
 with anything approaching religious freedom. Commu-
 nists cannot and will not tolerate an unsubmissive reli-
 gious sect. Communism may preach that religion is a
 "private affair" for non-Communists, a matter for the
 Individual alone to decide, but the fact remains that
 Communism is, virtually by definition, pledged to the
 propagation of atheism andto the&destruction first, of
 organized religion, and, ultimately, of religion itself.i
 Atheism is propagated actively wherever Communists
 are In power. Communists conceal or deny the funda-
 mental irreconciliability between religion and Commu-
 nism only when such a denial is essential for tactical
 purposes -- when, for example, it would otherwise be
 impossible to gain mass support for Communist aims
 in a predominantly Catholic country. For the Commu-
 nist there is no real contradictioh between Marxist ad-
 vocacy of atheism and the Party policy of catering at a
 particular moment to religious believers in some states.
 The first is the goal, the second merely a means to that
 end. Communists have only one goal as far as religion
 is concerned and that is its complete eradication.
 I. Communist Doctrine on Religion.
 The working philosophy of Communism Is the Marxist-Leninist interpretation of
 .materialism. Marxism not only incorporates the hostility of materialism toward religion --
 in line with its search for a purely material explanation of all natural phenomena -- but ex-
 tends that hostility to the point of active combat with religious beliefs. Marxism's avowed
 intention is the eradication of all religions.
 Communists do not attempt to conceal this intention from the Inner circles of the
 Party. In fact, the official program of the Soviet Communist Party specifically outliner the
 methods by which the eradication of religion is to be achieved. Communist literature is
 replete with attacks on religion and with support of atheism.   The following are typical e> -
 amples of this anti-religious position.

 Regardless of the date of origin, these quotations are still cited in contemporary
 Soviet sources to justify and explain the Party's stand on the religious question. Their
 contemporary usage also shows once again that there has been no fundamental change in
 the Communist viewpoint on religion since the days of Lenin.
 "Dialectical materialism, the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism and
 the theoretical foundation of the Communist Party, is Incompatible with re-
 ligion.....The world outlook of the Party Is based on scientific data, whereas
 religion contradicts science. As the Party bases its activity on scientific
 foundations, it is bound to oppose religion. (Molodol Bolshevik - Young Bol-
 shevik - No. 5-6, 1946, p. 58.) For the conception of the world from a reli-
 gious point of view Is incorrect..... It Is a mutilated understanding of the world
 and of the mutual relationships of men. (Yaroslavsky, Chief of League of Mili-
 tant Atheists, Religion in USSR, Moscow. 1939.) The world outlook (of commu-
 nism) Is irreconcilable to any   d of superstition, religion or idealism. (On
 Soviet Socialist Society - Gospolitizdat, Moscow, 1948, p. 400.)
 "But while (Marxism as materialism Is absolutely atheistic and resolutely
 ,postile to all religion...it goes farther than earlier materialist schools] by
 applying the materialist philosophy to the field of history, to the field of-social
 sciences. 1 We must combat religion;-{ that is the rudiment of all materialism,
 and consequently of Marxism... .But Marxism goes further. It says: We must
 know how to combat religion, and in order to do so we must explain the source
 of faith and religion among the masses materialistically. The fight against-n
 religion must not be confi ned to abstract ideological preaching or reduced to
 such preaching. The fight must be linked up with the concrete practical work -
 of the class movement, which aims at eliminating the social roots of religion.
 (Lenin, "Attitude of Workers Party Toward Religion", 1909. Selected Works,
 Int'l Publishers, New York, 1943, vol. XI, p. 666.)
 "(For) religion?is the opium of the people. Religion is a kind of spiritual
 gin in which the slaves of capital drown their human shape and their claims to
 any decent human life. (Lenin, "Socialism and Religion," 1905, Selected Works,
 vol. XI, p. 658.) Religion is a bandage over the eyes of men, preventing them
 from seeing the world as it actually is. (Yaroslavsky, op.cit) There is no
 -place or job for God in the universe. (Radio Moscow, June 11, 1948) `Every re-
 ligious idea, every idea of god, even flirting with the Idea of god is unutterable
 } vileness... .of the most dangerous kind, "contagion" of the most abominable
 kind.' Millions of sins, filthy deeds, acts of violence and physical contagions....
 are far less dangerous than the subtle , spiritual ideas of a gad decked out in
 the smartest "ideological" costumes. (Lenin, "Letter to Go~ky," 1913, Selected
 Works, vol. XI, p. 675-6761) It is not religion that creates man, but man who
 creates religion.... religion Is the groan of the down-trodden creature... .It is the

 "Why do we not declare in our programme that we are atheists? Why
 do we not refuse Christians and those who believe In God admission to our
 Party ?.... (Because) unity in the revolutionary struggle of the-oppressed class
 for the creation of paradise on earth is more important to us than unity of
 opinion among the proletarians about a paradise in heaven. That is why we do

 not and must not forbid proletarians who still cherish certain relics of the old
 superstitions to approach our Party. (Lenin, "Socialism and Religion," 190b,

 introduce an explicit avowal of atheism, in the sense of declaring war on re-

 declaration of war was the best means of reviving Interest in,religion.... Engels

 "The Communist Party is guided by the conviction that only the realization
 of conscious and systematic social and economic activity of the masses will lead
 to the disappearance of religious prejudices. The aim of the party Is finally to
 destroy the ties between the exploiting classes and the organi4ation of religious
 propaganda, at the same time helping the toiling masses actually to liberate their
 minds from religious superstitions and organizing on a wide scale scientific-
 educational and anti-religious propaganda. It is however necgssary carefully to
 avoid offending thereligious susceptibilities of believers which leads only to the
 strengthening of religious fanaticism. (Program of Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union - First adopted at the VIII Congress of the Party, March 18-23, 1919 - still

 III. Communists on Religion after Seizure of Power.
 A. The Party
 Once the Communist organization seizes political power and control of the state,   i
 religious manifestations on the part of Party members are no longer tolerated as before.
 The campaign to eliminate believers from the Party ranks becomes more open and more in-
 tense. Intra-Party propaganda increasingly stresses the atheistic aspects of Marxist phi-
 losophy; at the same time both direct and indirect pressure are exerted on those Party
 members who cling to old dogmas or rituals. Communists who continue their observance
 of religious rites despite these measures are eventually purged from the Party ranks and
 only convinced atheists accepted as candidates for membership.
 B. The Public
 For the general public, the fiction of Marxist compatibility with religion is dropped  I
 only after the Party has consolidated its hold on the political apparatus and can safely with-
 stand widespread opposition to its policies. Religious organizations are thus deprived of
 their properties, the clergy are often put on the state payroll (in spite of Communist

 championing of the separation of church and state) and are prohibited all educational ac-
 tivity. The nation's school system is completely secularized and religious instruction to
 the young curtailed. Eventually, propagation of religion among school children becomes a
 criminal offense, as in the USSR. At the same time, the state gears~its entire educational
 I
 and informational apparatus to the dissemination of a materialist philosophy and the athe-
 ism expressive of that philosophy.
 Wherever possible, the Communist regime avoids open assaults on the clergy of
 any church, preferring to undermine clerical influence gradually through atheistic educa-
 tion of the young. If the clergy accept a Communist-dictated modus'vivendi between church
 and state, the authorities permit It relative freedom of ritual, but atrogation of the right to
 give religious instruction is generally the price of that limited freedom. The eventual dis-
 integration of the rite is assured by its inability to propagate itself.
 The refusal of strongly organized religious sect to capitulate to state demands spot-
 lights the doctrinal issue and focuses attention on religion, a situation the Communist state
 prefers to avoid. If church opposition assumes a definitive enough character, the general
 public Is forced to recognize the basic irreconcilability between Marxist dogma and religious
 tenets, and to choose between the two. Communist authorities must"then resort to active
 repression to eliminate the power of the church hierarchy and to divorce the public from its
 religious inclinations.
 In the long run, the avowed goal of Communism is the eradication of religion. Any
 temporary modus vivendi concluded between church and state in a Communist controlled
 state only works to the advantage of the Communists by allowing them time to undermine.

 A. The Party
 "It is not to be tolerated that even the smallest manifestation of
 religiousness should be observed among Communists. (Zarya Vostoka -
 Dawn of the East - January 27-28, 1949.)
 "There is no room in the ranks of the Party for 'Communists'....
 who hinder the thorough development of anti-religious propaganda... .A
 young man cannot be a member of the Young Communist League unless
 he is free of religious convictions. (Komsomolska   Pravda - Young Com-
 munist Truth - October 18, 1947.) For us Communists, and Young Commu-
 nists, religion never was and never will be a 'private matter'. The high
 status of Communist and Young Communist can be applied only to one who Is
 not only completely free from religious prejudice, but who also considers it
 as his most important duty to educate Soviet people and Soviet youth in the
 real spirit of scientific Marxist-Leninist views. (Molodoi Bolshevik - Young
 Bolshevik - May 1948.)
 "For a Komsomol It is impossible and inadmissible to believe in God
 and to observe religious rituals.  (Komsomolskaya Pravda - Young Commu-
 nist Truth - October 18, 1947.)
 "Religion should be declared a private affair... .But the meaning of
 these words must be precisely defined so as to leave no room for misunder-
 standing. We demand that religion should be a private affair as far as the
 state is concerned, but under no circumstances can we regard religion as a
 private affair as far as our own Party is concerned. (Lenin, "Socialism and
 Religion", Selected Works, vol. XI, p. 659-660.)
 "In the course of 1948, forty-nine persons were excluded from the
 Party (Communist Party of Georgia) for the observance of religious rites.
 Characteristically, among them are persons with middle and even higher
 education. Thus, for example, a teacher of the Aspindza Raion seven-year
 school.., .and her husband, an inspector of the Statistical Administration of
 Georgia,....both with a higher education, baptised four of their children.
 Both were expelled from the Party. Also excluded from the Party was a
 kolkhoz member of the Engels' Kolkhoz in Sachkere Raion who had a middle
 education.... who in September of last year arranged a funeral to which he
 invited a priest and at the same time, on that very day, baptised two of his
 children. The facts again and again remind us of the necessity of strengthen-
 ing the anti-religious propaganda among the population. (Zarya Vostoka -
 Dawn of the East - January 28, 1949.)
 "A person cannot act correctly, cannot act in an organized manner as
 a Communist, as a Leninist, if his brain is poisoned by religion. (Yaroslav-
 sky, o  cit.)  Although the Party demands religion be considered a private
 matter as as the state is concerned, it does not regard the fight against
 the opium of the people, the fight against religious superstition, etc., as a
 private matter. (Lenin, "Attitude of Workers' Party toward Religion," 1909,

 survivals of religiousness must be carried out by the school teachers in
 the process of teaching the foundations of the. sciences.... the basic task of

 before parents who are believers as to the extreme harmfuln`ss....and inad-
 missibility of imposing religious influence on children .... Par6nts who are
 religious believers in the great majority of cases realize that they have no
 right and that it is not in their Interest to maim their childrer- morally and
 to place them in a dual situation by bringing them up at home on religious
 prejudices which are in radical contradiction with the true scientific instruc-
 tion and education of the school. (Naro  oye Obrazovaniye - Popular Educa-
 tion - "Some Aspects of Education,Apr  1949.1

 viewpoint has been a vital part of the activities of educational and cultural
 organizations in Soviet Russia from the first days of the Soviet regime.

 social system.
 "Religion--Distorted, fantastic reflection in people's minds of the
 natural and social forces ruling over them;  'one type of spiritual
 oppression inflicted everywhere on the popular mases who are
 oppressed by eternal work for others, by want and loneliness" (Lenin,
 Vol. 10, p.65).  The basic characteristics of all'religion are a
 be1Pf in supernatural powers, which supposedly rule the world, and
 sub.aission to them.  Religion has elements in comzion with philosophical
 rea:.ism and contains gnosiologicel roots:  theories and hypotheees
 separated from nature, personification and sublimdtion of the forces of
 nature.  Philosophical idealism is the form and mdthod of the defense
 of religion.
 "Religious beliefs and the rites and inatituirions (church and others)
 corresponding to them are not eternal.  They arise and exist only
 under certain historical conditions.  Over a very'long period of
 human history; people did not know any religion.  The appearance of
 religious beliefs in primitive society became pos4ible with the
 dev'  pment cf :,:nought and articulate sp.cech.  Religion arose as a
 ref. x of the i-.ipotence of primitive man before natural phenomena
 ,-which threatened him and which he did not understand.  This impotence
 gave rise in the heads of primitive men to the thought of the
 existence in the surrounding world of special, evpernatural beings
 capable of bestowing blessings or of delivering misfortune on people.
 Having personified objects of nature and giving t.em supernatural powers,
 the savage tried to influence them with incantations, magic, and
 cer:monial rites.  Elements of magic are containea in all modern
 re?.:gions.  In a class society the roots of religious beliefs are
 pri:Berily class roots./ The helplessness of people before the

 evitably breeds belief in miracles, in a better life beyond the grave.
 'The social oppression of the toiling masses, their seemingly complete

 and hourly a thousand times more horrible Sufi' .~rizigs, a thousand times
 more savage tortures on the rank and file of the yrorking people than any
 kind of unusual event like ' r,. earth cake, etc.-'this is the most
 basic present-day root of re:Ligion.t (Lenin, Vol 15, pp. 374-375).  In

 "As one of the elements of the superstructure, religion plays
 an active role in strengthening the economic base which gave rise
 to it, in strengthening the system founded on the enslavement and
 exploitation of man by man.  Religion has always played a reactionary
 role, has fortified people's impotence before nature, has served
 as a weapon for oppressing the toilers, and in the present day
 in all 'bourgeois countries religion is the weapon of the imperialist
 bourgeoisie in the struggle against the camp of democracy and
 socialism., Propagating submissiveness, humility, rejection of
 the struggle to remake the world., to struggle for docialism, all
 in the name of being rewarded after death, 'in the other world t')
 religion helps to strengthen the rule of the bourgeoisie.y'Eeligion
 is the opium of the people,--such is Marx' definition.  Insisting
 that everything in nature and society occurs according to the
 wi,Ul. of the gods, rejecting the objective lava of phenomena, denying
 maw s ability to get to know the surrounding world, religion prevents
 people from knowing the laws of nature and society and from using
 them in the interest of society.  Religion has been and is the
 ~irreaoncilable enemy of progress and science.
 "Socialism destroys the material roots which nourish religious
 beliefs.  Together with the disappearance of the social system which
 is based on the exploitation of man by men, the conditions which
 breed religion disappear also.  However, one oannot overcome religious
 prejudices in the consciousness of people at one stroke.  In its
 development consciousness lags behind the development of the
 material conditions of the life of people.  Therefore, in the con-
 sciousness of backward people, religious prejudices remain as
 survivals of the eafitalist past even after the destruction of
 er;pitalism.  They can be and are actually overcome gradually, in the
 proce esof the active participation of the broad masses in the practical
 construction of a communist society, in the. process of communist
 education.  In the USSR and countries of people's democracies there
 is genuine freedom of conscience.  In the USSR the church was
 rseparated from the state, and the school from the church, as far back
 .  That is
 That
 as 1918.  Each citizen can be a believer or a non-belie8er the       isd
 as
 a matter of his own conscience.   The Communist Party,
 of the toilers which is fighting for their liberation from all
 oppression, cannot be neutral towards religion, because religion
 is a form of spiritual oppression.  l'u all its activity the
 : Communist Party helps the toilers to free themselves from rex.ig cus
 tsuperatitions and to master the scientific world-outlook.  Of great
 importance in overcoming religious superstitions are the propagation
 of the Marxist-Leninist world-outlook, cultural-educational work,
 and extensive propaganda of natural-scientific and social-political
 knowledge.  A profound illumination of questions of religion and
 of the attitude of the proletarian party to it is given in such
 articles by Lenin as Socialism and Religion. The Attitude of the

 Coimtinist Party Ceihtral Committee Decree, "On Errors in Conducting
 Scientific-Atheist Propaganda Among The Public."
 "In conformity with its program, the Communist Party is con-
 ducting scientific-educational propaganda of the materialist world
 outlook, directed toward constant raising of the consciousness of
 the toiling masses and toward their gradual liberation from religious
 convictions.  In this the Party has always considered it necessary to
 avoid offending the feelings of believers in any way.
 "The Party Central Committee is in possession of facts which
 testify that of late gross errors have been committed in scientific-
 atheist propaganda among the public in many localities.
 "Instead of the development of systematic and painstaking work
 to -prsad knowledge of natural sciences and an ideological struggle
 against            some central and local newspapers and also the
 st3temey_4-s o= some lecturers and speakers have contained insulting
 at?t=:cks 'zpon_ the clergy and believers who perform religious rites.
 Cases oc=r when, in the press or in statements by propagandists,
 some ministers of religious cults and believers are depicted without
 justification as people unworthy of political trust.  In a number of
 arias th-re have been cases of administrative interference by local
 organizations and individuals in the activity of religious associations

 no event to permit future offending Of the feelings of believers or
 clergymen or administrative interference in the activity of the
 church.    It must be born in mind that actions insulting the church,
 clergy and citizens who are believers are incompatible with the
 policy of the Party and state in the conducting o t scientific-atheist
 propaganda and are contrary to the U.S.S.R. constitution, which grants
 freedom of conscience to Soviet citizens.
 "As a result of profound changes in the social-economic conditions
 of life, the liquidation of exploiter classes and the victory of
 socialism in the U.S.S.R., as a result of the sucgessful development
 of  science and the general rise in the level of culture in the country,
 the majority of the population of the Soviet Union has long been freed
 of religious survivals; the consciousness of the '.for}ring people has
 grown immeasurably.  At the same time, one cannot! but take into account
 the fact that there are also many citizens who, while actively parti-
 ci.pating in the life of the country and honorably fulfilling their
 ci.-duty to the motherland. are still under the :influence of various
 ki:..Is of religious beliefs.  The Party has always demanded and will
 c:'aLInue to demand a considerate, mindful attitude toward these
 bellievers.  All the more is it stupid and harmful to cast political
 do,.ot on Soviet citizens because of their religious convictions.  Pro-
 fcraad, patient, skillfully arranged scientific-atheist propaganda
 among believers will help them in the long run tofreo themselves
 fro:a religious delusions.  On the other hand, administrative
 measures of any hind and insulting attacks on
 b-lie:vers and clergy can only do harm, can only lead to strengthening
 an! oven intensifying their religious convictions.;;
 "In conducting scientific-atheist propaganda, account should be
 ta'ten of the fact that it is impossible to identify the position of
 the church in the land of socialism with the position of the church
 in an exploiter society.  In bourgeois society the church is a support
 and instrument of the ruling classes, who use it for the purpose of
 enslaving the working people.  This does not preclude the possibility
 that individual clergymen even in a capitalist society may and do go
 over to the point of view of the working people on a number of im-
 portant questions of politics.  However, for behavior contrary to the
 interests of the exploiter classes those clergymen are generally
 subjected to persecutions of all kinds from the church and government
 circles of capitalist countries.
 "In Tsarist Russia the church faithfully served the autocracy,
 the land-lords and capitalists, justified the cruel e:cploitation of
 the mass:.s and supported the exploiters in the struggle against the
 working people.  It is also known that immediately after the victory
 of the October socialist revolution, during the years of the Civil
 War and later, many religious organizations and groups of the clergy
 remained hostile to the Soviet regime.  Because ofthis, individual
 ministers of cults were prosecuted by the state not for their religious
 but for to eir antigoc?ornment activity, directed against the interests
 of the Soviet people and for the benefit of internal counterrevolution
 and international imperialism.  It is natural, therefore, that the
 Soviet people's struggle against the enemies of the socialist state
 44

 should have included a struggle against those reactionary representa-
 tives of the church who were engaged in activity hostile to the
 Soviet people.  At the present time, as a result of the triumph of
 Socialism and liquidation of the exploiter classes in the U.S.S.R.,
 the social roots of religion have been undermined and the base on
 which the church relied has been destroyed.  The majority of clergy-
 men, as the facts testify, now take a loyal stand with respect to
 the Soviet regime.  Therefore, the struggle agaihst.religitsne beliefs
 should be regarded now as an ideological struggle of the scientific,
 materialist world outlook against an antiscientific, religious world
 outlook.
 "Rectification of mistakes committed in antireligious propaganda
 must not load to a relaxation of scientific.-atheist propaganda, which
 is an integral part of the communist education of the working people
 and has as its aim the dissemination of scientific, materialist knowl-
 edge among the masses and the liberation of believers from the influ-
 ence of religious beliefs.
 "W'"ri:ae, in relation to the state, religion is a private matter,
 an.f the::  or' the church is separated from the state, the Communist
 Par,;y, vhich bases itself on the only correct, scientific world out-
 look--M..:,:?xis.?n,-Leninism--and its theoretical foundation, dialectical
 materialism, cannot adopt an apathetic neutral attitude toward
 religion, an ideology which has nothing in common with science.
 "Ou.' party has always considered and considers it its indispens-
 able duty to promote the development of natural, technical and social
 sciences by all opportunities and means.  Only on the basis of modern,
 progressive science is it possible to make thorough and full use of
 the riche of nature in the interests of all mankind.  Only on the
 basis of science is it possible to achieve a fresh and considerable
 advance in development of industry and agriculture, to ensure higher
 lab .r pfi~oductivity and thereby substantially promote the Prosperity
 cultu.i?al level of the people.  Proceeding from this, the Com-
 m; ': st Fizty ed:acates Soviet people in a scientific world outlook
 an,.,.', wago3 a s r' ggle of ideas against religious ideology as an anti-
 sc. entifio ideology.  The fundamental opposition of science and
 religion is obvious, '-rhereas science relies on facts, scientific
 experiment and conclusions strictly checl.ed and confirmed by life,
 any religion bases it3elf only on Biblical and other traditions, on
 fantastic fabrications.  Modern scientific discoveries in the natural
 and social sciences convincingly refute religious dogmas.  Science
 cannot be reconciled with fabricated religious concepts about the
 life of nature and man, hence it is incompatible with religion.
 Science helps mankind to delve more and more deeply into the objective
 laws of the development of nature and society, helps to place the
 forces of nature at the service of man; science helps to increase
 man's awareness and raise his culture; but religion clouds man's
 consciousness, condemning him to passivity in the face of the forces
 of nature and. fettering his creative activeness and initiative.

 The Soviet View on Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam
 "BVDDHISM--one of the three most widespread religions (together with
 Christianity and Islam)
 "Origin and Doctrines.  Buddhist religious literature attributes
 the creation of Buddhism to the Bu4dha Sakya-Muni, who supposedly
 appeared in the 6-5th centuries B.C. in the figure of the Indian prince
 Gautama.  Reactionary bourgeois science repeats this version.  An
 analysis of Buddhist literature and aroheological materials of the 2nd-
 lot centuries B.C. bears irrefutable evidence to the fact that the
 myth of the buddha Sakya-Muni was created by the Buddhist church
 comparatively late in order to propagate Buddhism more .successfully.
 The earliest biography of Sakya-Muni was written in the lot century
 A.D., and the most popular narrative about him, the 'Lalita-vistare,'
 was written in the 2nd-4th centuries A.D.
 "Buddhism, like all other religions, was not created by any
 special person, but originated in the conditions of social life.  In the
 6.h-51;h centuries B.C* in India, especially in its northern part, the
 p."oc.eas of the development of slaveholding relations and the
 formation of large slaveholding states was intensified.  This
 period is characterized by the appearance of various religious
 teachings on the equality of all people.  The appearance of these
 teachings was a reflection of the dissatisfaction of the downtrodden
 and persecuted freeholders and lower classes of the slaveholding cities.
 Early Buddhism, equalizing all people in 'suffering" and,in the right
 to "salvation", was one of these teachings.  As a result of its
 characteristic propagation of passivity and reconciliation with
 reality, the ruling class did not look upon Buddhism as a dangerous
 doctrine and not only did not subject it to persecution but,
 on the contrary, supported it.  Moreover, the slaveholding
 aristocracy soon adopted Buddhism for its own ides.:-:,gical weapon,
 i.nasmc.ch as Brahmanism--a religion which half arisen in the epoch
 of the disintegration of the primitive-communal system and which
 sanctified tribal  divisions--could not serve as a satisfactory
 ideological basis for the large slaveholding states which had
 been formed.  In addition, the slaveholding aristocracy perceived
 in Buddhism an anti-priest tendency which was.useful to it,
 inasmuch as Brahmanism propounded the privileged status of priests
 within the slaveholding aristocracy.  With the growth of slaveholding
 and the formation of large states, the slaveholding aristocracy as
 a whole came out against special privileges for one of its component
 groups.  In the 3rd century B.C., Asoka, the king of Magadha of the
 Mourys dynasty which had united the larger part of India, adopted
 Buddhism and zealously forwarded its propagation in India and
 beyond its borders.  The teachings of humility and submissiveness
 became the main elements'in Buddhism.  In those parts of India
 where the process of the development of slaveholding relations
 proceeded with less intensity, the basic mass of the population
 continued to adhere to the old, communal religious views.
 "L der the patronage of the Maurys kings 'tie first Buddhist
 councils were called  at which representatives of various small sects
 and tendencies tried to establish agreement on problems of dogma and

 organization.  Buddhist monasteries began appearing from the 2nd
 to the 1st centuries B.C.  The :Buddhist cult was further developed;
 Buddhist temples were built, etc. ...
 "Early Buddhism was called Hinayana (,small chariot' or 'narrow
 path' of salvation). In the lst century A. D. in the northwestern
 part of India a new form of Buddhism arose--the Mahayana ('large
 chariot') 'wide path' of salvation), in the dogma and cult of
 which a large place is occupied by Boddhisatvas--deities which
 render help in 'sllvation.'  Buddhist worship included ancient
 popular invocations of numerous gods and spirits; in order to
 intensify emotional influences Buddhist ritual makes extensive
 use of the graphic arts, music, luxuriant trappings, ritual
 dances, etc.
 "The ideologists of the exploiting classes tried to touch up
 Buddhism and declared it to be an 'atheistic' religion or a
 'purely philosophical' system.  In the epoch of imperialism bourgeois
 obscurontists, trying to place Buddhism at the service of a refined
 f:.deism, not only supported the positions of Buddhism in the
 c~;'.ontal and dependent countries of the Orient, but propagated it
 J--: Europe and America.  Only Soviet science was able correctly
 to expose the roots, the historical path, and the reactionary
 essence of Buddhism, to show its real role in exploiting the
 toiling masses.  'All rr.:.igion is contradictory to science' .
 (I.V. Stalin, Works, Vol. 10, pp 132-133).  Thet,:Oealietic world-
 view of Buddhism is the darkest kind of mysticism.  Materialist
 teachings in ancient India developed in the struggle against the
 idealistic mysticism of Buddhism.  The idealistic mysticism of
 Buddhism teo^hes that the visible world is the manifestation of
 a st,?eam of non-material, rystical 'particles'--of Unknowable
 'dharmaa,'  Certain 'combinations' of 'dharmas' generate indivirloal
 consciousness.  The outer world is declaredlD be merely an illusion
 of this consciousness.  On the basis of the ancient Indian animistic
 ideas of the transmigration of souls, Buddhism propounded the
 doctrine of the reincarnation of living beings, affizming that
 the death of a living being is a manifestation of the disintegration
 of a certain 'combination of 'dharmas,' after which a new
 'combination' of 'dharmas' is formed.  New 'combinations' of
 'dharmas' are predetermined by 'karma'--the sum of Aall 'sins'
 and 'virtues' in the previous cycle of inv:arnotionb.  A preponderance
 of 'virtues' over 'sins' guarantees a better reincarnation.  The
 ideal,, according to the teaching of Buddhism, is'the attainment
 of 'nirvana' (literally, 'extinction')--the complete cessation
 of the process of reincarnation and liberation, therefore, from
 suffering, which, according to Buddhism, makes up the essence of life.
 Moreover, proponents of Buddhism are no different from proponents
 of Christianity, who '...proclaim all the villainies of the oppressors
 against the oppressed either as just punishment for:-the original and
 other sins or as trials which God in his great wisdom grants his
 atoning people.'  (K.Marx) see K. Marx and F. Engels, Works, Vol.5, p 173),
 Buddhism declared that the enslavement of the toilers was the result
 of their sins and 'errors' in former incarnations,and in this way,
 like all religions in a class society, trying to reconcile the
 toilers and oypressad to pofieitty And to their lack of tights., to
 instill in them the slave psychology of patience and submissiveness

 in the name of a future illusory nirvanp.  Buddhist dogma on re-
 incarnation, which maintains that today's mighty ruler can be a
 slave or an animal in his next incarnation, and that a slave can
 be a rajah in his next incarnation, is designed to turn the
 oppressed away from the struggle against the exploiters, to defend
 the interests of the ruling classes, to suppress the class protest
 of the toilers.
 "Hypocritically propagating non-resic1,an?_te to va.oJ.ence, Buddhism',
 as the ideological weapon of the oppressors, became G e defender of
 the violence of the exploiters to..ar.ds the oppressed,  The Buddhist
 pantheon consists of a tremendous collection of gods--'huddhos and
 boddhisatvas.  According to Buddhist concepts,, the principle gods--
 buddhas--are surrounded by an assemblage of less important gods-
 assistants, among whom are terrible, furious guards who exterminate
 heretics and atheists.'  Some Buddhist orders and sects place in
 the center of their worship the buddho Sakya-Muni; others give
 preference to the future buddho Moit_eyo, gigantic depictions
 of which ore erected in temples.  Still others =de the buddha
 1 aita'Da, the leader of paradise, the main god.  The complete
 t~nkr?iptcy of the thesis of bourgeois scholars of the tottheismc
 o." Buddhism is beyond question.
 "Diffusion of Buddhism Outside India.  The coex?stence of Buddhism
 and Brahmanism in India gradually brought the-na closer and closer
 together and promoted the formulation of a new ideo.i ~,gical system--
 the religion of Hinduism, which was more applic'9ble to the feudal-
 ism which was developing in India with its pecLi arities (the

 "HINDUISM--the name of a religious system embracing a complex of the
 most varied beliefs of the majority of the population of present-day
 India, beginning with religions with complex theological doctrines
 and ending with primitive beliefs inherited from aA'primitive-
 communal system (animism, totemism, fetishism, etc.).
 "The religious system of India was developed in the period of the
 early Indian middle ages as a most important element of the feudal
 ideological superstructure, designed to protect and strengthen the
 feudal base.  A characteristic of the feudal society in India was
 the presence of significant remnants of slavery and of a primitive-
 communal system, andal.c.o of the historically developed caste
 divisions.  Because of this, various and num erous religious beliefs
 continued to exist in India in the early middle ages.  The priests--
 BrahrAns--tried to reduce this great variety of beliefs to a
 unified system.  They made as the basis of this system the most
 important doctrines of the ancient religion6--Brahmanismu and Buddhism--
 of the slaveholding society, which had served the exploiting classes
 as a weapon for the spiritual oppression of the toiling masses.  These
 most :important dogmas were dharma, karma, and ahimse.
 "Dharma (literally, 'law') is the rule of life ' and? conduct of every
 Indian, i.e.., of the followers of the religion of Hinduism.
 According to t1  b-,aching of Hinduism., each caste has its own special
 dharma.  For toilers, the main element in the dogma of dharma
 is the instruction to be content with their actual lot, the
 improvement of which during their lifetime was decl4 red to be
 impossible in principle.  Another basic doctrine of',Hinduism
 was the dogma of karma, formulated, as was the case- with dhar:aa,
 in Brahmanism and Buddhism.  This doctrine rests up:n the anii.stie
 conception, which goes back into for antiquity, of the animation
 of the entire world surrounding man and of the transmigration of
 souls.  According to the teaching of karma aft er a man dies his
 soul is reborn in a lower or hi,;her social status depending upon
 the degree to which he si.tbmitted to the demands of his prescribed
 dharma, i.e., on the unquestioning falfillmont of the obligations
 of his caste.
 "Hinduism also included the doctrine of ahimea ('rejection
 of evils) which had been worked out in the religions of Buddhism
 and Jainism.  The exploiting classes tried to instil this dogma
 .into the consciousness of the exploited in order to-convince them
 ,of the sin of all forms of struggle for their emancipation,,
 "All these doctrines of Hinduism were utilized by the feudal
 lords to hold the popular masses in a state of obedience and
 submissiveness to the exploiters to reconcile them to want and to
 the deprivation of their rights.  Social inequality was explained
 as 'eteranl lave' established by the gods and according to t.hich
 each man, from the point of view of the dogma of dhsrma, merely
 reaps the fruits in his present life of the ''sine' or 'virtues'
 of his former existences.

 "Heading the pantheon tf the gods of Hinduism was the trinity
 of the gods t Brahmanism (trimurti).  Bfabma is the god-creator;
 Vishnu, the god-preserver (the personification of eternally alive
 nature, his cult is-closely linked with the, ancient sun cult);
 and Shiva,, the god-destroyer and builder (the personification
 of the alteration-of life and death, his cult goes back to the
 most ancient cults of the gods of fertility).  The image of
 Brahma did not have any roots in popular beliefs and was always
 only an artifical creation of Brahman theology, and he was never,
 therefore, widely revered.  In its attempt to embrace the entire
 variety of religious beliefs existing in India in the period
 of the formation of feudal society, Hinduism recognized these
 beliefs as forms of the worship of Vishnu or Shiva; the deities
 of these religious beliefs were recognized as embodiments of
 Vishnu or Shiva or as their symbols....
 "As a result, Hinduism absorbed the various tribal religions
 as well as the earlier religious ideologies of ancient clavebolding
 Indian society.  In India Buddhism was compeltely dissolved in
 Hinduism, and Buddha merged with the image of Vishnu as one of
 the letter's incarnations.
 "The vedas and other holy books of Brahmanism remained as
 such in H:izi1ism; the language of the ^ult remained Sanscrit,
 and the Brahmans remained as the sole guardians and interpreters
 of religious laws.  This guaranteed for the Brahmans the highest
 place in the caste structure of Hindu feudal society.
 "Inspite of the complexity of Hindu theology, Hinduism
 is in essence extremely primitive.  Inherent in it is idol-
 worship--worship of certain animals (especial-1y the cow), de'fication
 of certain rivers (especially the Ganges), plants (the lotus,
 for example), mountains, etc.  Hinduism is characteristic for
 its 'vulgar cult of nature, the degrading nature of which is
 particularly striking in the fact that man, this master of
 nature, reverentially falls on his knees before the monkey
 Hanuman and the cow Sabala.'   (K, Marx, see the collection of
 K. Marx and F. Engels, On England, 1952, p 341).  The basis
 of the cult of all the religions of Hinduism are sacrifices to the
 gods, ancestor worship, and pilgrimages to holy places.  Much
 attention is given to the formal aspects of the ritual, which
 strengthens the influence of the professional priesthood all
 the more.
 "The anti-feudal movement in the Indian middle ages often
 adopted variova forms of religious sectarianism.  The best known
 of the sects which came out against the class-caste system was
 the sect of the Sikhs, which developed in the beginning of the
 16th century and which led the peasant were in the Punjab in
 the second half of the 37th and the first half of lthe 18th
 centuries.  Sikhism later lost its anti-feudal direction and
 become one of the religions of India.  In the middle ages in
 certain sections of India there took place the conversion of
 Indians to Islam, as a result of measures of force and persuasion
 carried out by the Moslem rulers and feudal aristocrats who
 had some out from countries of Central Asia and the Near East.

 Incidents of religious conflict between Hindus and Moslems took
 place in the middle ages, mainly anong the feudal aristocracy.
 But the feudal lords--Hindu and Moslem alike--quickly forgot
 their religious differences when it became necessary to unite
 to suppress the resistance of the peasants and artisans professing
 various religions.
 "The English colonizers, conquering India in the 18th and 19th
 centuries, tried to utilize the Hindu priesthood as one of the
 supports of their rule in the country.  Hindu priests had various
 privileges.  The English colonizers supported the caste oppression,
 sanctified by Hinduism, which doomed millions of Hindu Indians
 of the so-called untouchable castes to a semi-slave existence.
 With the growth of the national-liberation movement and class
 warfare in India, English imperialism utilized to a greater and
 greater extent the religious and caste divisions of the population
 of India to keep the popular masses disunited, playing off Indian
 Hindus against Indian Moslems through all kinds of provocations.
 In 19C9 the English colonial rulers introduced a system of
 elections to so-called legislative organs of British India,
 built on the foundations of religious curiae.  The_ extreme sharpening
 of class contradictions in the last quarter of the 19th century
 intensified the attempts of Indian landowners and bourgeoisie
 to utilize Hinduism to defend their class positions.  In this
 period a multiftae of religious-political organizations grew up.
 Regardless of whether they advocated a position ofcfficial
 Hinduism or whether they came out as reformist organizations,
 their aim was one and the same--to subordinate the Indian toilers,
 who had been awakened to active political struggle, to the
 influence of bourgeois national-reformism; to divide the popular
 masses and prevent the growth of their class self-''consciousn ss;
 and to guide the popular movement into a channel which would
 not endanger the exploiting classes.  The English authorities
 gave special protection to the most reactionary of these organizations
 ('Hindu Mahasabha', and others).  Individual attempts (e.g., Tilak)
 to use Hinduism in the .,1ruggle againot the English failed and
 only prevented the creation of a unified anti-imperialist front
 in the country.
 "The leadership of the party of the liberal landowners and big
 capitalists--the National Ccc ress Party, which, form the very moment
 of its creation (1885) declared that it represented the interests of
 all Indians regardless of their rel;g;iouo affiliations--was made up,
 in ren lity, mostly of Hindus and set itself off from the Moslems.
 At the some time, the official ideology of the party, Gandhism, borrowed
 the religious-mysticial aspects of its teaching from Hinduism.  All
 this enabled the English imperialists to inflame religious conflicts

 India, Buddhism strr;c.l,a bargain with the local religions,
 accepting the local gods into its own pantheon and augmenting its

 priesthood emerged,. for the most part, as agents ofJapanese
 imperialism.  The Buddhist church actively aided the aggression
 of Japanese imperialism against the USSR.  Japanese Buddhist
 missionaries went to China, Thailand, Burma and other countries
 of East Asia in large numbers, entrusted with the task of uniting
 all Buddhists under the domination of imperialist Japan.  The
 slogan of Pan-Buddhism served as a cover for the aggression of
 Japanese imperialism.  Japanese :imperialism tried to weaken
 the resistance of the peoples of Asia against theirraggressioa
 through the Buddhist doctrine of passivity.
 Since the end of the second world war the A4erican-
 English imperialists have been making extensive use of the
 reactionary leading elements of the Buddhist ::hurcb in their
 aggressive pr+liey in East Asia.  The mystical iacn i.sm of Buddhism
 is being utilized by Anglo-American philosophical servants of
 imperialism for the struggle against materialism, in order to
 'buttress' and provide a 'basis' for idealism and ideolcgical
 obscurantism of all kinds.  In Japan, Buddhism, like Shintoisra,
 is a support of reaction and Japanese militarism, which is being
 revived with the help of1he United States of America.  In China,
 Buddhism, along with Confucianism, served as an ideological support
 of the now-shattered reactionary Kuomintang clique.  The reactionary
 leadership of the Buddhist church in Lhasa is being used for
 aggressive ends by the English and American imperialists-, who
 are trying to tear Tibet away from China and convert it into
 their own colon'-, into an arsenal for the struggle against the
 Chinese People's Republic.  The Tibetan people, including broad
 strata of the lamahood and the patriotic sector of the higher
 priesthood, are ocming out against the forces of imperialism
 and reaction which are trying to separate Tibet from China.
 Considerable strata of the Buddhist priesthood in ,countries of Asia,
 inspite of the plots of the reactionary leadership, are taking
 an ever-increasing role in the struggle for peace, supporting
 the world movement of peace partisans.
 "In the course of the national-liberation struggle of the
 peoples of the East for peace, freedom and democracy, Buddhism is
 more and more losing its influence among the 'toiling people. The
 advanced, progressive ideas which-em being increasingly assimilated
 by the toiling mosses are counteracting the reactionary ideas of
 Buddhism, as well as of other religions."

 Islam--A religion which arose in the beginning of the 7th century in
 Arabia and later spread in the Year and Middle East, North Africa,
 and Southwest Europe as a result of Arab conquests,  At the present
 time, Islam is widespread in countries of the Near and Middle East,
 in North Africa, Southeast Asia, and, to some extent, in countries
 of the Far East.  Islam, like the other religions, has always played
 a reactionary role, being a weapon in the hands of the exploiting
 classes for the spiritual oppression of the toilers, and it has been
 utilized by the foreign imperialists to enslave the peoples of the
 East.
 Origin of Islam
 The rise of Islam was called forth by formation of a class society
 among the Arabs.  In the 6th century Arabia, whose popalation consisted
 of nomad-herdsmen (Bedouins), settled farmers, merchants, and craftsmen,
 experienced a process of decay of its tribal-communal system.  The
 economic and social contradictions characteristic of the stage of the
 decay of tribal-communal relations reached its highest development in
 t.:.^ c; ty of Mecca....The development of the inequality of wealth among
 the people of Mecca led to the strengthening of the power and influence
 of the local native aristocracy.  This aristocracy engaged in a large-
 scale caravan trade (especially, slave trade) with neighboring countries,
 kept the people of Mecca and the neighboring Bedouin tribes in a state
 of continuous financial indebtedness, owned slaves, and-possessed
 livestock and land in the oases.  In addition, the Meccan native aris-
 tocracy usurped the priestly functions in the Meccan temple of Kabah.
 The tribes of Western Arabia, which were economically dependent on
 Mecca made an annual pilgrimage--hajj--to the temple of Kabah F_ --A
 tradrd with the Mecdans during the hajj.  Soviet scholars are r...,t united
 in taeir views on the question of the nature of the production relations
 which developed in Western Arabia.  Some investigators think that in
 Mecca, Medina and other areas the sixth century saw the development of
 a slaves-owning system in the decayed tribal-commmunal system,  a;,hers
 believe that the process of the formation of a feudal society already
 took place in this period,
 In connection with the formation of a class society in Arabia,
 there developed among the local tribes an economic and social crisis,
 a reflection of which was the rise of Islam, which was called upon to
 justify social and economic inequality and the system of exploitation
 which was taking form.  The tribal aristocracy was attempting to solve
 the crisis by seizing new territories, and in order to do this it was
 necessary to unite all the Arab tribes.  Islam, with its strict mono-
 theism, expressed this attempt at unification.  The process of
 fashioning a new ideology in the form of Islam was accelerated by the
 decline of the Meccan transit trade as a result of the establishment
 of the rule of the Ethiopians and Persians in South Arabia,  This
 decline, in K. Marx's words, gave the impetus to the rise of Islam
 (V.K. Marx and F. Engels, Wes, Vol. 21, page 488).  As a result of

 the decline of the Meccan transit trade, the pressure rf the Meccan
 merchants and money-lenders on the Bedouin tribes was intensified.
 The development of Islam was greatly influenced by the primitive
 religious concepts of the Arab tribes, and also by Christianity, Judaism,
 and Zoroastrianism.  The basic monument of early I3la.-n is the Kcran,
 which expounds the bases of the dogma, worship, and law of early Islam.
 The history of early Islam is usually divided into the Mecca and Medina
 periods, in conformity with the same division of the suras (chapters)
 of the Koran.  In the Mecca: chapters Allah (the Moslem god) foretells
 the early approach of the "end of the world", "of the day of judgement",
 and threatens with the tortures of hell the obstinate ones who do not
 recognize his all-powerful authority.  He promises 1 those who are sub-
 missive and patient sensual pleas'zres in a paradise after death.  In
 the Meccan chapters slavery and material inequality are presented as
 phenomena established by the same all-powerful Allah, and which, there-
 fore, are not subject to any change.                      The point of view advanced by
 certain apologists of Islam concerning the "crmmunism" of early Islam
 and alleging that Mohammed, who is considered the fgander of Islam, was
 a revolutionary and a great social reformer, is anattempt to conceal
 the real essence of Islam.  The Koran, which dilig;ntly and consi-,tently
 Ct:~fe-,m:s and justifies slavery (it is considered to have been established
 '...-y .llah), exploitation, the material and social inequality of people,
 id the best refutation of this kind of falsification.
 In Mecca the spread of Islam was very limited,  The Kureishite
 aristocracy was hostile to the new religion, fearing that its success
 would lead to the liquidation of the cult of Kabha  to which the trade
 between the Meccans and the Aran tribes was tied.  According to Arab
 tradition, in 622 Mohammed and his small group of followers resettled
 in Medina.  In this agricultural oasis Islam quickly spread am-gig two
 Arqb tribes.  Three so-called Jewish tribes (probably Arabs wh  pro-
 .fs :,,e3 Judaism) were driven out of Medina and partially ex;,:= '.=atcd,
 while their lands and dwellings were transferred to the Moslems.  The
 Medina Moslems, headed by Mohammed, conducted an nmcd struggle against
 the I4ecans.  This struggle ended in a compromise in 630.  An agreement
 was concluded whereby the Meccans adapted Islam and occupied a
 Ajjent place in the Moslem crinnnuzity, while the followers of Moha:ri cd
 recognized Mecca as a holy city and the temple of xabha as the prin-
 cipal sanctuary, to which pilgrimages were ordered.'  The followers of
 Mohammed also retained the cult of the ancient fetish of the "black
 rock", which was in the Kabha.  The Moslem community was decisively
 formed in the Median period and was the nucleus of the Arab state.
 This community, uniting people on the basis of their adherence to the
 new religion, was radically different from earlier, existing tribal
 organizations, in which people were united mainly by signs of blood
 relationship.  The Medina suras regulated property and social relations
 in the conditions of the already established class society.  In these
 suras special attention is devoted to the maintenance of private prop-
 erty and the defense of the rights of property-holders.  "Islam", wrote
 F. Engels, "is a religion adapted for the inhabitEtnts of the East,
 especially for the Arabs, that is, for the townspeople engaged in trade
 and commerce, on the one hand, and for the nomad-Bedouins, on the other."
 (K. Marx and F. Engels, Work g, Vol. 16, part 2, page 410).

 Each Moslem, the  Koran teaches, must profess his belief in the
 one god-Allah and recognize Mohammed as "Allah''s envoy".  The Koran
 depicts people as weak-willed "slaves of Allah", required to be sub-
 missive and patient, to submit to Allah, to his "envoy", and to all
 those in power.  The rites which each Mussulman is required to per-
 form are directed mainly towards inculcating the believers wi;.h a
 feeling of helplessness before Allah and with dependence on him.
 According ti the Koran's instructions, every Moslem must pray, observe
 the fast during the entire ninth month of the Moslem lunar year--the
 Ramadan, perform a pilgrimage to Mecca, and pay a state tax-nn the
 harve,~t, on an increase in livestock, and on;;commercial profit.  In
 every way possible the Koran recommends and approves of a jehad, a
 "holy war", against "infidels"--non-moslems,,the aim of which is to
 spread Islam.
 Islam in the Period of Feudalism.  In the 7th - Cth centuries the
 Arabs conquered Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia. Transcaucasia,
 the Middle East, Egypt, North Africa, The Ibr. ian Feninstla, and
 Northern India.  Under the banner of a "holyllwar" the Arab usurpers
 spr~,a.rl Islam among the enslaved peoples in several conquered coo:-.tries
 'Dy fire and sword. In the conquered lands a''vast state was formed--
 the Caliphate, in which Islam became the predominant religion.  .Zn
 this state all those who did not adopt Islam were required to pay a
 heavy sr-called head tax.  In the Caliphate,',.tho Arab-conquerors were
 strongly influenced by the subjugated peoples, who lived under a feudal
 system.  Thus, in the feudal Caliphate Islam became one of the "world
 religions".  "The great historical turning-points," wrote F. Erecls,
 "were accompanied by changes in religion only to the extent that one
 speaks of three world religions existing up to the present day--
 Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam."  (F. Engels, Ludwig Feue_?hach and
 rind of Classical German Phioso h   1951, p.-27   In the (a Lipha e
 under t~ a conditions of developed feudal relations, Islam in i.ts
 initial form, as expressed in the Koran, no longer satisfied the
 social-political interests of the ruling classes.  Therefore, to
 augment the Koran there arose the Moslem "holy tradition," tr,e Sunna
 which was composed of a great number of hadiths, i.e. stories, `,he
 subject of which were actions and judgments :attributed to MohL,Lied.
 The Sunna, which, like the Koran too, justified the class systc.i and
 exploitation, sanctioned all the innovations which appeared in the
 doctrines, cult, and ceremonies of Islam as a result of its development
 under the conditions of an early feuds: society, including everything
 the Moslems borroied from the religious beliefs, laws and customs of
 the subjugated peoples.  On the basis of the Koran and the Sunna the
 Shariah was formulated also--a collection of feudal Moslem laws which
 regulated all aspects of the life of a Moslem through a variety of
 minute instructions.  In the first century and a half in the existence
 of Islam, the Moslem spiritual lfaders considered only the Koran and
 the Sunna as the source of faith and behavior in life.  Accepted as
 an absolute tenet was the doctrine of predestination, according to
 which all acts of all men arc predetermined by Allah.
 A characteristic feature of the history of Islam is the struggle
 among various tendencies and sects.  Already in the first century of
 its existence Islam broke down into two main trends--Sunnism and
 57
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 Shi'ism.    They arose through the internicine struggle among the
 successors and followers of Mohammed.  Sunnism is the main, "orthodox"
 current of Islam, the adherents of which build their teaching on the
 Koran and Sunna and recognize as their spiritual leader the Caliph,
 who at first was considered Mohammed's deputy, and later as Allah's
 deputy on earth.  Shi'ism developed mainly in Persia.  The Sta'ites
 gave a special interpretation to the Koran, had their own holy tradi-
 tion in lieu of the Sunna, did not recognize the Sunnite Caliphs, to
 whom they opposed their own dynasty of the 12 Imams, whom they con-
 sidered the direct descendants of Mohammed.  The last representative
 of this dynasty, "the hidden Imam", is considered the unseen leader
 of the Shiites, who await his second advent.
 There arose both in Sunnism and Shi'ism a variety of sects which
 were an expression of the feeble protest of the toiling masses against
 class oppression and feudal exploitation.  They were sometimes the
 expression of the struggle of various groupings of the ruling class.
 The earliest large sect of the Sunnite faith were the YJlawarijites,
 who led the anti-feudal. movement of the peasant and plebian masses in
 the Caliphate in the ?th and 8th centuries.  The Ismailis, a Shiite
 sect w':iich arose in the 8th century, derived support from the peasant
 a::t1 -fsudal movement, but the feudal lords seized the leadership of
 t.rie sect.  Anti-feudal strivings were expressed with particular
 emphasis in the movement of the Carmathians, which began in the 9th
 century.
 Towards the beginning of the 9th century, when, as a result of
 the deepening of class contradictions in the Caliphate, more refined
 methods of influencing the toiling masses were required, a rationalist
 tendency appeared in Islam.  Its first representatives were the
 Mutazil_tes.  The 9th--10th centuries saw the beginnings of an u.-.,thodox
 Mosa,_:m -theology, the Kalat, the founder of which is considered -) be
 AUhari (874-935).  This theologian and his students, trying to rG.on-
 cile the doctrine of predestination and free will, attempted to per-
 suade the believers that all of man's actions are predetermined by
 Allah, but since man is able to "acquire" his actions, he is respon-
 sible for them before Allah.
 In the 10th - 11th centuries, in the process of the further
 develcpment of Islam, there arose and received universal recognition
 the cult of the "holy ones", monasticism, mysticism.  The cult of the
 "holy ones" was expressed in visits to their graves, in prayers and
 religious ceremonies at their graves, and in bringing gifts, which in
 actuality profited the spiritual leaders.  As in the days before the
 advent of Islam, stones, trees, springs and wells associated with the
 names of the "holy ones" became objects of worship.
 The intensification of feudal exploitation in this period, the
 suppression of anti-feudal uprisings, and inter-feudal l?aars, the.onus
 of which fell on the shoulders of the popular masses, created favorable
 conditions for the diffusion of mysticism in Islam and of the asceti-
 cism associated with it.  The spokesmen of the mystical-ascetic trend

 in Islam -Sufiism--were the dervishes (Moslem monks), who united into
 frattrnities in the 11th century, later organizing Sufist orders.  At
 first Sufiism was characterized by opposition to "orthodox" Islam.
 The spiritual leaders accused the Sufis of infidelity and declared
 them heretics.  The authorities persecuted them.  Therefore, Sufi
 teachings became very popular among the popular masses, and the Sufis
 were respected and considered authorities.  But Sufiism with its
 doctrine of renunciation of the world, of abstention and non-resistance,
 could easily be utilized as a means of stifling the class struggle.
 Therefore, the medieval Moslem theologian Ghazali used his authority
 to legalize the mystical and ascetic concepts of Sufiism and intro-
 duced them into the system of "orthodox" Islam.
 With the strengthening of the Osman empire, which in the 16th
 cnntury included thb Arab lands, the leading position among the Moslems
 passed from the Arabs to the Turks.  The Turkish sultans, who later
 took on the title of caliph, and also the Persian shahs used Islam
 to justify their predatory policy and to sanctify the exploitation of
 the oppresscd peoples.  "With particular cruelty the Persian and Turkish
 copressors used Islam in their wars against the peoples of the Cat asus,
 e-ainic- the Slavic peoples, against Russia.  The seizure of Trans-
 c_:uc,- +a, of Georgian and Armenian lands, the mass destruction of
 h  torical monuments and cultural treasures, the extermination and
 enslavement of thousands of women, old people, and children--all these
 bestialities the Turkish and Persian invaders covered with the flag
 of the struggle for religion."  (M.D. Bagirov, On the Questicn cf the
 Movement of Muridism and Shamil, 1950, p.6)  .
 Islam in the Period of Capitalism.  As a result of the penetration
 of European capital into Islamic lands, of the colonial enslazar.-.1t of
 these countries and the beginnings there of capitalist relatior.?-., there
 ero;:;, various Islamic Currents and trends, the adherents of :.,hi :h tried
 to adapt Islam to the new social-economics conditions in order to keep
 it as a weapon of class oppression.  The founders and adherents of
 these tendencies were the bourgeoisie, the liberal landowners, and the
 bourgeois-landowner intelligentsia.,
 The struggle. of the popular masses in the countries of the Past
 against the European colonizers, which was conducted under the slogan
 of Islam and led by the feudal lords and Moslem spiritual leaders,
 ended in the defeat of the popular masses and the victory of the fcudal-
 clerical leaders, who came to terms with the co3.unizers.
 Islam was utilized by the foreign colonizers, first of all by the
 English, for the enslavement of the peoples of the East and for the
 struggle against the national-liberation movement of these peoples.
 The English colonizers used Islam not only to organize mass fratricidal
 wars among the oppressed colonial peoples, but also the struggle against
 their competitors, especially Russia.  England, together with sultan
 Turkey, made especially extensive use of Muridism,--the most reaction-
 ary and militant tendency in Islam, which carried religious intolerance,
 expressed in the idea of "jihad", a "holy war" against "infidels", to

 extreme limits.  Under the slogan of jihad predatary wars of the
 Anglo-Turkish agent Shamil were undertaken agains  Russia in the
 19th century.
 From the second half of the 19th century "Panislamism" became
 widespread in the countries of the East.  Panislam'ism is a reactionary,
 religious-political teaching, propounding the unification of peoples
 who profess Islam for the struggle against "the attack of the Christian
 West".  Panislamism, as Lenin characterized it, att-inpted "to unite
 the liberation movement against European and Amer can.impc.rialism
 with.the vested interests of the Khans, landlords,, Mullahs, ital."
 (Wor o  .th ed., vol. 31, p. 127.)
 The main goal of Panislamism was to replace class contradictions
 with a religious community and to preserve feudalrelations.
 Islam in Modern Times.  After the victory of the Great October Socialist
 Revolution in Russia, in the period of foreign intervention and civil
 war, Islam utilized the internal counter-revolution and fo:,oif:n impe-
 .alists to struggle against the Soviet state.  Thu;:, for example, in
 11.9 =.n the North Caucasus on the initiative of the English imperialists
 a.  o l:irate" was established, at the head of which was placed a Sheikh
 w~io announced his intention to rule according to the directives of
 the Shariah.  In Turkestan the Moslem spiritual leaders, who were
 foreign agents, demanded that the country be ruled according to the
 Sha:iat, and under the guise of defending Islam and the Sharia they
 organized attacks against Soviet rule.  During the period of the
 building of socialism in the USSR, the remnants of the exploiting
 classes tried to use Islam for the struggle against socialism.  The
 Moslem spiritual leaders, as agents of these classes, ^onductec a
 struggle against the Soviet laws on the family and manr..age, ag=:ast
 the, 7iberation of women, for retaining the yashnal and the  rai   ah.
 They committed terrorist acts.  The Kcran and Sha~iah were used with
 special vigor in the Islamic areas of the USSR for the struggle against
 industrialization and collectivization.  In the U4SR, as a result. of
 the victory of socialism and the liquidation of the exploiting cl,,.sses,
 the social roots of Islam, as of all other religidns, have been d.?~-a-
 troyed.  In USSR Islam exists only as a remnant of one of the fo:,ns of
 .he ideology of exploiting society.  Moslems (as well as adherents of
 other religions) in the USSR are granted freedom to perform religious
 worship and religious ceremonies.
 In countries of the East (in Turkey, the Arab countries, Iran,
 Afghanistan, Pakistani Indonesia), where Islam is a.state religion, it
 continues to be one of the weapons in the hands'o# local reaction and
 foreign imperialism.  American-English impcrialists utilize Islam to

 and against the movement of the peace partisans i? countries where

 U.S.S.R. iu separated from the state, and the school from the church.
 Freedom of religious worship and freedom of antireligious propaganda
 is recognized for all citizens.'  This article in our Constitution
 is cons!stently and strictly enforced.
 "However, many of our organizations which have the duty of
 working among the masses, including. the trade unions, have drawn
 incorrect conclusions from this article of our Constitution.  They
 have taken freedom of conscience to mean merely the freedom to worship
 and have forgotten their own direct duty  to spread scienti..ic atheist
 propaganda. ...
 "The heads of many trade union organizations have began to turn
 a : lisJ eye to the fact that trade union members are prac*.:I.-Ing
 religious ceremonies--marrying in church, christening the i'^ ;;hildren
 and celebrating feast days.  No one explains the harm of religion to
 the workers and employees, particularly the young ones; no one explains
 that religious beliefs demean man and spiritually cripple him.  Yet
 it is well known that as soon as the struggle against bourgeois
 ideology slackens or, worse, is utterly neglected, the representatives
 of hostile ideology extend their activity.
 "The trade union; and ti sir cultural insti',!.tion- have tr-r,,-:.dous
 fact"..itie^, for conducting m '_itant scientific a`Lheis?t propa-It
 is their duty to help the Communist Party constCX?.bly aid ac--.:.vely to
 build up a scientific, atheistic outlook in Soviet peoule.  For this
 purpose all means of mass enlightenment-lectures, ta''.ks, e.g ba i on
 with visual demonstrat.ons, films, and libraries--mu,t be used. .,."
 "Develop Extensive Scientific Atheist Propaganda", Trud, 4 Aujust
 1954.
 "4-. 'Fear created gods', Vladimir I1ayich Lenin said, quoting an
 old philosopher, in one of his articles.  The Soviet system freed the
 workers from blind helplessness before the menacing forces of nature.
 With the abolition of exploiter classes, the roots which nourish
 religion disappeared in our country.  But religious beliefs, though
 shattered and undermined by life, still make themselves felt.  To this
 day these beliefs still poison the minds of part of the youth and
 hinder its active participation in building communism,
 "Yet among many Young Communist League ilxtiv members there are
 incorrect, un-Marxist views that religion is a personal matter, that
 one cannot fight against religious beliefs; in the course of building
 communism religious ideology, they say, will fade and vanish of itself.

 to bring the light of authentic knowledge to the masses of young

 Lectures, reports, discussions, books and popular science films, telling
 how the world was built, how life came into existence on earth, where
 religious beliefs came from and to whose advantage they are, must
 occupy a constant and prominent place in Y.C.L. work.  It is the
 honorable duty of the young intelligentsia to be tireless propagandists
 of science and active fighters against ignorance and. darkness.  ...
 "The practicing of religious rites and the celebration of
 religious holidays are accompanied by many days o' drunkenness, absen-

 propaganda in the course of logic were not dealt with.  Strange as it
 may seem, the new programme even takes a certain-step backwards in this
 respect compared with the draft program for 1953.  In the latter, there
 was a particular point on the topic 'Basic stages of the development

 "The Central Committee of the CPSU in its resolutions has poihted
 out that scientific-atheistic propaganda must be carried out system-
 atically and not in outbursts.  Fulfilling these instructions of the
 Party Central-Committee, the ccmmanders and political officials of
 the Navy have achieved certain successes in disseminating a knowledge
 of natural sciences among the personnel of ships and units.  However,
 of late scientific-atheistic propaganda in the Navy has visibly weakened.
 In particular, unforgivably few lectures on natural-science themes are
 being read by the propaganda lecturers of the Political Administration
 of the Black Sea Fleet.  For a prolonged period they have been
 delivering only a single lecture on the subject 'Religion   The Enemy
 cf Science and Progress'.  Only now, after a great lapse of time, has
 a lecture been prepared on the harmfulness of religious prejudices and
 superstitions.  This is clearly inadequate. ...

 to the cultural-education institutions of the -Navy.  They must be

 unfortunately, be said of the Officers' House, where the head is Comrade
 Afanasyev.  Here scientific-atheistic propaganda is neglected.  Things
 are no better either in certain other Officers' Houses and sailors'
 clubs.  Such a situation cannot be tolerated.  Cultural-educati.c,nal
 institutions have an obligation to help commanders, political c ficials,
 har?~;y and Komsomol organisations to bring up the personnel of ;aaips

 Summary of 19 October 14~j "               `'' '''   15   u .. 4.ryij*, 10c-tuner of

 F I% effects of religious survivals in the USSR:
 The Communist Party teaches us that the position of the church in the
 USSR should not be compared with the position of the church in an
 exploiters' society.
 In a bourgeois society, the church is the bulwark-and the tool of
 ruling classes who use its services to enslave the working people.  In
 our country, as a result of the liquidation of the exploiting classes,
 the old basis on which the church stood was destroyed,.
 The majority of the clergy in our country are loyal to the Soviet regime,
 This does not mean, however, that religious beliefs have ceased to be
 reactionary and that atheistic propaganda is not necessary.  The
 Communist Party, which stands upon the only correct world outlook--?
 MM.rxism-Leninism--cannot remain neutral in its attitude toward religion,
 a:. ideology which has nothing in common with science.
 Persistent study of the laws of the development of society and nature
 convinces Soviet people that the fate of human race is decided by real
 conditions of the real development of society and nature and not by the
 will of supernatural, nonexistent forces.  The complete liquidation of
 the exploiting classes, the cultural revolution, And the systcmatic
 propagation of the scientific world outlook have resulted in the fact
 that the great majority of 0oviet people have become corscious buu.=.lders
 of communism and have broken away from religion.
 Socialist ideology predominates in the USSR and the new sccialist
 economy has created in our country conditions which do not support reli-
 gious beliefs, but, on the contrary, lead to the gradual dying o;.~t of
 these beliefs in the consciouoness of the working people.
 However, a certain number of our people are still' attracted by the
 religious beliefs.  As far as their nature is concerned, the religious
 beliefs and organizations, remnants of the old world and of the
 exploiters' superstructure, are the most (conservative?) elements of
 this superstructure which are still able to survive the conditions
 which brought them into being.
 While it was possible,, during the progress of the Revolution, to destroy
 the existing state administration, to prohibit propaganda of reactionary
 views, and to close down reactionary press organs, it was impossible to
 use the same means to destroy religious beliefs amcng the people, to
 close religious establishments and to prohibit religious services.
 It would be naive to think that religious beliefs will die a natural
 death.  Such views are anti-Marxist and anti-Party; religious beliefs
 are long-lived, an enormous force, and can become even stronger.
 64

 The great war conducted by the Soviet Union against the aggressors, the
 difficulties connected with this war, anxiety about fate of members of
 families, and other factors contributed to the strengthening of reli-
 gious beliefs among the most backward part of the Soviet people.  The
 weakness of scientific-atheistic propaganda during and after the war
 also contributed to the strengthening of religious beliefs. Simulta-
 neously, churchmen and members of varicus sects intensified their
 propaganda.
 There are other rcasons for the survival of religious beliefs in our
 country.  Such survivals result from the action of the general sociolo-
 gical law manifested in the fact that the development of human con-
 scioushess lags behind social development and economic conditions of
 life.
 The vitality of the remnants of religious beliefs also can be explained
 by the existence of the imperialist camp which is interested in the
 survival of these beliefs and which is striving to revive and support
 them.
 The unsatisfactory general standard of cultural development of a certain
 ::,.cover of our people must also be blamed.  A certain number of older
 believers are contaminating the younger generation with their religious
 prejudices.  The force of a bad tradition, of a bad habit, is a terrifib
 force,
 The main rcason, however,, for the survival of religious beliefs is the
 weakening of scientific antireligious propaganda and intensification of
 religious propaganda by churchmen and members of religious sects.
 In recent years church propagandists have devoted special atter.I.Lon to
 attracting young men and women to the church.
 What is the harm of religious prejudices under the conditions of the
 construction of communism?
 These prejudices are harmful because religion teaches humility and
 submission to a powerful god, poisons the consciousness of the Soviet
 people with lack of confidence in their own abilities, and kills their
 energy and joy in life.  By promising a better future in another world,
 religion distracts the attention of Soviet people from the construction
 of communism.
 All religions, without exception, reject science and replace it with
 blind faith,  Religion kills the best human qualities, such as
 inquisitiveness, boldness, and courage, qualities particularly needed
 by the Soviet people who are marching toward communism.
 The religious and national intolerance preached by religion is
 particularly harmful because-it undermines the order established in
 our multinational state.

 The unmasking of religious ethics which inflict much harm on Soviet
 society today is a most urgent necessity in the interest of dommunist
 construction and in the interests of friendship among people of all
 countries.     Work, which plays the decisive role ihthe progressive
 development of the human society, is proclaimed by-'religion as the
 curso of mankind.
 Religion appeals to believerst  Love your enemies And bless those who
 curso you.  It is enough to remind you of the sufferings of our people
 during the war against the fascist invaders to prove the harmfulness
 of this teaching.  Not love for fascist cannibals 'out hatred of them
 helped us to defeat our enemies and defend our freedom and country.
 Religion teaches that a wife should fear her husband.  It develops a
 feeling of weakness among.women.  Communist ethics reject such a con-
 temptible attitude toward women,                       On the contrary,nthe Soviet regime
 has freed women, granted them full rights in political, social, and
 economic life.
 Facts prove that religious people arc also superstitious.  The most
 h?Lghly developed superstition is manifested in fortune-telling, which
 i- nothing but deceit and trickery.
 Observance of religious rites and holidays is one of the most harmful
 remnants of the past.  Let us consider baptism of children and church
 marriage.  The baptism ceremony is based on old beliefs of protecting
 a child against evil spirits by submerging it in water.  Church marriage
 is also based on various marriage ceremonies of the pro--Christian era.
 Both ceremonies reflect the beliefs of primitive people who, by various
 magic gestures, tried to protect a child or a youn  couple.  The porr-
 formanco of these rites of savages in our time is the fruit of i,:c;k-
 wardness and lack of culture among certain people.
 The origin of the majority of Christian holidays is the same.
 Christians believe that Easter is a holiday marking the resurrec;tion
 of Christ.  Science, however, has proved that Christ never existed and
 that the origin of this holiday can be clearly traced to the pre-
 Christian era.
 Religious holidays often inflict harm on our national economy and on
 believers.  Very often, as a result of these holidays, established
 periods for various types of farm work are violated and this results
 in losses of yield.
 Many church-goers in our country do not go to church because they are
 believers but because they are following an old tradition.  Despite
 this, Soviet society must conduct the struggle against religious super-
 stitions which distract people from the struggle for the flourishing
 of our country and for higher cultural standards for our peoplo.
 It should be remembered that our constitution not pnly guarantees
 freedom of conscience, but also freedom of antireligious propaganda.
 The fact that religious organizations in our country are not acting
 66
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 as a politically hostile force and that they are taking part in the
 struggle for peace should not result in the conclusion that we should
 abandon the struggle against religious ideology.  Everyone who is of
 a different opinion forgets that despite the changed position of the
 church toward the socialist state, religious ideology has not lost
 its reactionary character and continues to be an obstacle on the road
 to the construction of communism.
 The Nov. 10, 1954 decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU on tho
 conducting of scientific-atheistic propaganda among the population
 stresses the need for this propaganda.  This propaganda, however, should
 not offend religious beliefs and members of the clergy.  It should
 always be remembered that offending actions against the clergy or direct
 interference by administrative organs in the work of religious
 organizations only lead to the strengthening of religious prejudices.
 The best means of struggle against religion is scientific ideological
 propaganda.

 1.  Central Government Minority Policies
 The Chinese Communist regime has taken determined steps to deal with
 discontent among the minority nationalities.  The Moslems were finally
 permitted to set up their Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Region under rigid
 Chinese controls.     An attempt is being made to bring Tibet, Sinkiang, Tsin-
 ghai, and Inner Mongolia under control by resettling Chinese  peasants in
 these areas and strengthening local Chinese garrison forces.
 Minority nationality cadres are encouraged to work for  the regime.
 They are strongly urged to study Chinese in addition to socialism.  Cadres
 among Chuang people, who have just been given a written language, are de-
 voting their time to studying Chinese.  Government and party organs, es-
 pecially the latter, continue to claim industrial and agricultural achieve-
 ments in the minority areas as a result of  the "correct party policy on
 minorities."
 In the course of attacking rightist Ma Chen-vu., it was revealed that
 there had been repeated outbreaks among the Moslems during the past few
 years.  Evidently, the Chinese Communists had inherited the Moslem troubles
 which had plagued the Manchu and Kuomingtang regimes for the past centuries.
 Little news comes out of Tibet, but it reflects a tense situation there.
 The Hu-ho-hao-t'e Nei-men -ku Jih-pao reported on 17 June 1958 that
 the first session of the second people's congress of the Inner Mongolia
 Autonomous Region had recently been concluded.  In addition to receiving
 a lengthy political report delivered by Ulanfu, chairman of the region,
 the session passed resolutions accepting the report, the financial report
 for 1957, the budget for 1958, the 60-article Five Year Plan for socialist
 construction, the judicial report, the 1956-1957 agricultural and livestock
 development program, and report of the bills committee.
 Commenting on the political report, the session noted the achievements
 of the rectification and antirightist campaigns and the early fulfillment
 of the nation's First Five-Year Plan.  It then called on the masses to over-
 come their superstition and conservatism in order to promote the big leap
 forward in production.  The session also noted that the 1957 financial re-
 port showed a surplus and expressed the hope that it will do so again in
 1958.
 Editorially commenting on the work of the session, the newspaper of
 the same date pointed out that, although outstanding results have been
 achieved by the region in economic, social, and cultural progress, still
 many cadres are conservative while the  broad masses  are  backward and

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 superstitious.   It urged both cadres and broad masses to study and improve
 their ideology in order to comprehend the main line fully and to utilize
 it in the struggle for a big leap forward for the red flag in 1959.
 Reporting on industrial progress, the Hsin-hue News Agency  said on
 31 October that some 1,640 factories have been organized in the Daghur,
 Evenki, and Orunchun banners (ch'i) to produce fertilizer, milk products,
 woolens, and hydroelectric power.  It said the Orunchun people have been
 able to change from their nomadic life to socialism without  having to
 undergo the tortuous development of the intermediate stages.
 Industrial progress in other minority areas was reported in an item
 appearing in the 24 September issue of the Lhasa Tibet Jih-pao.  It is re-
 ported that to promote the construction of Tibet tl'e Tibet Military Region
 has formally organized an army construction coi and headquarters with Fu
 T'ing-hsiu as commander and Ch'iao Chia-ch'ien  as  political  cotmissar.
 This organization is now surveying the construction of a hydroelectric power
 plant at Na-chin, in the eastern. suburbs of Lhasa. Ch'iao Chia-ch'ien
 called on the members of the staff to overcome superstition, improve their
 techniques, introduce innovations, and promote racial solidarity to assure
 the success of the project.
 The 28 July 1958 issue of the Urumchi SinkiangJih- ao carried a di-
 rective of the Sinkiang party committee on the big leap forward in agti-
 cultural and livestock production in 1959.  Point 1 of the directive called
 for the following targets:  new land to be developed, 8 million mou; land
 to be placed under cultivation, 88.9 million mou; and land to be seeded,
 35.9 million mou.  Grain production is fixed at a total of 12-13.2 billion
 chin, with a per unit production of 500-550 chin aid a per-capita produc-
 tion of 2,000-2,200 chin.  Cotton production is fixed at 3.6-4.5 billion
 chin, with a per unit production of 120-150 chin and a per-capita  produc-
 tion of 30-40 chin.                   The target for afforestation is 50 million mou.  The
 target for livestock production is an over-all increase to 28,610,000 head,
 with a net increase of 15-17 percent in large animals and a 150 percent
 increase in hogs.
 Point 2 of the directive called for the realisation of these targets by
 expanding irrigation works, increased application  of  fertilizer,  deep-
 plowing, innovations in farm implements, purebred seed selection, proper
 planting of winter wheat, development of virgin land, a greater effort for
 a big leap forward in livestock production, a vast afforestation program,
 and the intensive training of technical cadres.
 Point 3 called on cadres to utilize their experiences in summer grow-
 ing and those of Ye An-ying in the course of the third and fourth stages
 of the rectification movement to promote production.  The directive urged
 cadres to take positive steps in leading the  peasants by bold  action.
 70
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 Concluding, it pointed out that, as an over-all condition to achieving
 success in the implementation of the directive, all cadres must initiate
 a socialist education movement at the time of the autumn harvest in all
 agriculture and livestock areas in order to promote the main line of the
 party.
 Revealing some of the problems arising from the implementation of
 this directive, another item in the same issue of the Sinkiang Jih-pao
 reported that cadres have completed the first stage of the studies on the
 main line and have taken final examinations in preparation for initiating
 studies on the second stage.  However, the item pointed out, the examina-
 tions revealed serious shortcomings among the cadres.  It urged the party
 to strengthen its leadership in order to overcome these weaknesses.
 The 2 July issue of this paper carried  an agitprop  item  entitled
 "Strengthen and Develop the People's Collective Ownership System of Social-
 ism and the Dictatorship endthe International Solidarity of the Proletariat,"
 which warned against the "machinations" of US "imperialists"     and  Chiang
 Kai-shek, and called for strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.,
 It also called for the solidarity of the proletariat and the expansion of
 international Communism.  It said that the socialist camp under the leader-
 ship of the Soviet Union is growing stronger daily while the                             imperialist
 camp is growing weaker as the result of unemployment and falling production.
 Concluding, the item called on the masses to oppose imperialism, war, and
 the enslavement of people by struggling for world peace, national libera-
 tion, democracy, freedom, and socialism.
 The 31 August issue of the Tibet Jih-pao reported that fast progress
 is being made in the cultural development of minority nationality areas.
 In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, it said, a vast movement is under
 way to expand the school network in order to fulfill the historic task of
 wiping out illiteracy.  In the Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Region, 54+6 in-
 termediate agricultural schools were established during the  previous 2
 months in 60 cities and hsiens.  In 17 hsiens, everyone has an elementary
 school education.  In the Liu-chou, Nan-ning, and Pai-se areas of  the
 Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region, over 390,000 children are enrolled in
 school for the first time.  Many minority schools  are  expanding  their
 Chinese-language courses.  All classes in the Yen-pien Korean Autonomous
 Chou have Chinese classes, and Chinese is used for instruction in some of
 the junior and senior middle school courses.  Over 130,000 children of the
 Chuang, Yao, Mao, and T'ung nationalities are now studying  Chinese in
 elementary schools, the paper reported.
 On 17 May, the Hsin-hua News Agency reported that in Szechwan Province
 there are 295 schools in the Yi and Tibetan areas.  Some of the Yi school
 children belong to slaves who gained their freedom with the  liberation.
 Nomads in Szechwan now have mobile schools.

 The agency report added that the Miao-Tung autonomous area in south-
 eastern Kweichow Province organized 82 middle schools  and  651 primary
 schools in April and May 1958.  These schools include courses in agricul-
 ture, animal husbandry, industry, sanitation, and sericulture.  The area's
 cooperatives have allotted 2,600 hectares of farm land 1,800 oxen,  and
 some farm implements to the schools for field operations; 93 percent of
 the school-age children are now in school.
 In Inner Mongolia, the report said, 90 percent  of  the  school-age
 children are getting a primary school education in half the region's hsiens
 and cities.  The total enrollment in primary schools has reached32 million.
 Issue No 34 of the Min-tzu HHuaa- ao (Nationalities Pictorial) Minzu
 Huabao), published in October 1958 in Peiping, reported that there is now
 one national and ten local national minority publishing houses.  In 1957,
 over 1,763 minority nationality publications in various languages  were
 published; this is 283.9 percent above the figure for 1952.  The total run
 was 1,461 copies, or 221 percent above 1952.  Between 1952 and 1957, over
 61.2 million copies of 6,700 kinds of publications in over 10 languages
 were published.  In addition to those on Marxism-IJeninism and the works
 of Mao Tse-tung, there were numerous scientific, sociological, and  cul-
 tural publications.  These publications are promoting the big leap forward
 and the cultural revolution by overcoming superstitious beliefs among the
 minorities, the source said.
 A 12 October news release of the Hsin-hua News Agency  reported that
 while addressing a meeting to mark the second anniversary of the founding
 of the Tibet branch of  the Chinese Buddhist Association,    Gen Chang
 Ching-vu said, "The question of religious beliefs and social reform are
 two different things and cannot be mixed up.  Still more impermissible is
 for religious circles to use religion as a pretext for opposing social re-
 form.  The existence of a system of exploitation is the  main reason for
 Tibet's poverty and backwardness.  The people's livelihood can be improved
 only through reforms, developing production, and building socialism  by
 joint efforts."  Present at this meeting was the Dalai lama.
 The 8 August issue of the Sinkia   Jih-pao reported that a group of
 Moslems from Sinkiang had returned after a pilgrimage to Mecca.  In their
 travels, they visited Mongolia, the Soviet Union,: Czechoslovakia, Switzer-
 land, and Greece.  The Urumchi ;party committee held a reception for the
 returning pilgrims.
 Outwardly, the Chinese Coma nist regime continues to display a liberal
 attitude toward religion and the minorities.  How@ver, in the implementation
 of party policies and lines which conflict with this attitude, the regime
 will not hesitate to take stern measures to satisfy its demands.

 2.  Minority Reaction to Central Government Policies
 While the Chinese Communist regime is attempting to wean the minori-
 ties away from their traditional mores, the established leadership of each
 nationality group is resisting the change, since it will endanger their
 paramountcy.  The party therefore is attempting to drive a  wedge between
 the leadership and the masses in the minority areas.  The leadership is
 accused of stressing the  "peculiarities"  of the area in order to secure
 special privileges or exemptions.
 However, the party is now finding itself in  an   awkward position.
 While denying that "peculiarities" exist, it "acceded" to the wish of the
 upper strata in Tibet and delayed social reforms there for 6 years because
 the people there were "not ready.."  Yet the party attacked Chiang Kai-shek
 for saying, "Everyone in China is Chinese," when it decided that autonomous
 minority areas were necessary because of the special needs of  the  people
 living there.
 Such illogical reasoning makes it difficult to enforce   party  direc-
 tives.  When minority  leaders  are refused  special privileges, they can
 claim racial discrimination.  Therefore, the minority reaction of central
 government policies is far from satisfactory.
 The Hsin-hua News Agency reported on 30 April that in the course of
 the rectification campaign national minority cadres thoroughly criticized
 local nationalism and took positive steps to strengthen racial solidarity.
 In the Yen-pien Korean Autonomous Chou, Chinese  and  Korean cadres  are
 learning each other's language in order to improve their  relations. Over
 2,000 of these cadres are learning the proletarian viewpoint  of working
 alongside the peasants in cooperatives in actual production or administra-
 tive activities.  The working style of the national minority cadres has
 greatly improved after developing closer relationships with local masses
 as a result of the rectification movement.
 After thoroughly studying Chairman I+ao Tse-tung's speech "On Dealing
 With Contradictions Within the Ranks of the People," 160 Tibetan cadres
 of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee took concrete steps
 to improve their work by holding public criticisms of their erroneous ide-
 ology, the news agency said.
 The 14 July issue of the Sinkiang Jih-pao reported that commercial
 and industrial circles in Urumehi had met recently to discuss the struggle
 against local nationalism.  Addressing the gatherings, Hsin Ian-t'ing
 pointed out that China has surpassed the US in grain production, and, in
 this. atomic age, he said, it is best for businessmen to "ride the east
 wind" and reform themselves.  He added that there is no doubting the suc-
 cess of socialism and therefore businessmen should not get  involved in

 capitalistic plots.  Nast businessmen are neither supporting the leftist
 Marxist interpretation of nationalism nor the bourgeois rightist interpre-
 tation.                        This is erroneous, he said; all businessmen mast immediately swing
 to the left; otherwise, they will be drifting to the right.  It is impossi-
 ble to remain neutral.  People who attempt to rationalize or become  emo-
 tional on the subject of local nationalism  are  1jound  to make mistakes.
 They must be firm in the struggle against local nationalism.
 The 9 August issue of the Sinkiang Jih-.ao reported that party commit-
 tees in Karasu, Aksu, and Khotan had recently held meetings to combat local
 nationalism.  Minority leaders who are demanding a national independent re-
 public were attacked for promoting separatism.   They were charged with op-
 posing Chinese cadres and Sinkiang production and` construction army units.
 Wu-mai-erh A-pu-te-la Yu-fu, commissioner of the `Aksu  special district,
 utilized his position to employ counterrevolutionary elements and conduct
 local nationalist activities.
 Another news item in the same issue featured.:the theme "strengthen
 national solidarity with the Chinese at the core" by Qiting achievements
 of the minority nationalities in Sinkiang under the guidance of the Chi-
 nese.  In the previous 4 months, the item said, the minority nationals
 made brilliant achievements in industry, agriculture, and livestock graz-
 ing.
 Lumping attacks against local nationalism ijth  parochialism, the
 K'un-ming Yunnan Jih-pao editorially commented on 31 July 1958 "Yunnan
 Province has the characteristics-of a border province where many minority
 people live and production  techniques are deficient. However, the pur-
 pose of acknowledging  these characteristics is to implement the policies
 and directives of the party Central Committee more fully in order to reach
 the fundamental common goal -- socialism and Communism.  Some good cadres
 may believe the biased and blind theory of 'local:peculiarities' but they
 can be corrected by persuasion and criticism.  Pa~ochialists, however, use
 the'local peculiarity theory'to oppose the party Central Committee.  On
 the argument that certain areas of nationalities are different from others,
 certain individuals oppose the party line in hopes of creating an indepen-
 dent kingdom."
 Continuing, the editorial pointed out that parochialists utilize this
 theory to evade the party's organizational procedure by  appointing local
 cadres to key positions in the party and government.  This  is  a  serious
 intraparty contradiction, since the major party line is not the localiza-
 tion, but the communization of cadres.  Only cadres with a complete under-
 standing of Communism can implement the party line and struggle  for the
 masses.  Striking at the heart of the question of.' parochialism, the edi-
 torial said, "One point must be emphatically pointed  out.  Local cadres
 generally mean members of the party who were underground at the time  of
 the liberation.  Most of these cadres were intellectuals who have not been
 74
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 completely reformed.  On the other hand, nonlocal cadres are  worker and
 peasant as well as veteran intellectual cadres with sound indoctrination.
 Therefore, the question of local and outside nonlocal cadres is metamor-
 phosed.into intellectual versus worker-peasant cadres....  Parochialists
 try to place local intellectual cadres who are still not properly reformed
 on the same level with nonlocal cadres.  This plot is easily exposed."
 Continuing its chastizing, the editorial said, "In fact, intellectual
 cadres, whose only claim is that they speak the local dialect, are really
 not, 'localo at all....  Cadres without Communist ideology and having no
 feeling in common with the workers and peasants are not Communist cadres,
 even if they are 100 percent local people."
 To further implement the party policy of national solidarity, a Hsin-
 hue News Agency dispatch dated 13 May said that Headquarters of the Chinese
 People's Liberation Army in Ch?eng-tug Szechwan Province,  had  recently
 called a meeting of ranking members of minority nationalities in the armed
 forces.  Over 204 ielegates from the Tibetan, Yi, Chiang, Miao, and Li-hsu
 nationalities attended the meeting.  Pledging to improve their work in self-
 defense and agricultural production, the delegates  will take  important
 roles in protecting the democratic transformation program, maintaining pub-
 lic peace, and safeguarding production.  Of these delegates, 1+0 percent
 were slaves before the liberation, the dispatch said.
 The 5 July issue of the Sinkiang Jih- ao reported that, despite the good
 record of many cadres who were transferred to Fou-k'ang Hsien, Sinkiang,
 to engage in production, some have never ceased complaining. A cadre who
 was transferred to a cooperative did nothing all day but harp on self-pity.
 He packed up his belongings twice and left for his old office.  Another
 wanted to give up the revolution and go to Urumchi to sell milk.  A young
 cadre complained that there was no future in the rural areas and said that
 he was wasting the best years of his life there.  A large number of cadres
 mistakenly devoted all their attention to manual labor and ignored politi-
 cal training.  They reasoned that since they were transferred for manual
 training, they had better stick to it and earn more work points.  Thereere
 even some whothi*they are above everybody else and fail  to follow orders,
 obey regulations, or work regularly.  Finally, some failed to adjust to
 rural living conditions.  Chinese cadres refused to live with minority na-
 tionals.  In view of this situation, the party committee took firm action.
 It ordered transferred cadres to observe discipline, hold regular politi-
 cal meetings, make confessions, and sign a pledge, the paper said.
 The 10 September 1958, No 9, issue of the Peiping periodical Chun -
 kuo Mu-szu-lin  (Chinese Moslem) carried several letters from its readers
 on the question of intermarriage of Moslems and Chinese.  These letters
 commented on an article in an earlier issue of the periodical and generally
 approved this type of marriage.  In most cases1it was a matter of a Moslem
 woman marrying a Chinese man.  The more forceful Moslems called for "edu-
 cating" the Moslem community to favor .su?wh  marriages, since  the Moslem
 75

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-62646R000400370001-3
 community should not  consider  itself  apart from the masses of China.
 Praising the leadership of the party, younger Moslems point out that pres-
 ent conditions are different from the old days.  Now contract marriages
 are no longer the custom.  The letters state that;, although Moslem prac-
 tices should be respected in mixed marriages, still  the Moslems involved
 should not rigidly insist on their observance by hon-Moslems.  They pointed
 out that, with the socialist construction of new China, new opportunities
 are being opened for everyone and Moslems should take advantage of them.
 An article in the same issue carried a critique of an earlier article
 in the periodical on Moslem history.  The critique took exception to the
 statement, "Moslems the world over are one family*"  It said that this ide-
 ology is a remnant from the feudalistic exploiting class  and  that  such
 thinking is in direct contradiction to the solida'ity of the proletariat.
 The 12 July issue of the Sinkiang Jih-pao reported that a minority
 work conference had been held in Peiping recentlyyto review the work  of
 teams engaged in a compilation of the histories o' various minority nation-
 alities.  The meeting brought out serious local nationalism among the work-
 ers engaged in writing the history of peoples in Sinkiang.  Insteadar work-
 ing closely with  local party  committees,  the investigators  repeated
 reactionary statements on nationalities by such bourgeois specialists as
 Fei Hsiao-t'ung, Wu Tse-lin, Huang Hsien-fan, Tsem Chia-vu, Li Yu-i, Yang
 K'un, and Yang Ch'eng-chih.  Instead of adopting the principles of Marxism-
 Leninism in their investigation work, they used tle subjective minority
 nationality point of view.   In this respect the Sinkiang  team committed
 the serious error of acting diametrically opposite to the instructions of the
 central government and the Sinkiang party committee.  The conference de-
 cided to complete a brief history of the minorities in 3 years and compre-
 hensive history in 4-7 years.  In the course of tYe conference, the dele-
 gates heard reports by Wang Feng,  deputy  chief  of                     the  united  front
 department and of the nationalities committee. of the party Central Commit-
 tee, and Hsieh Fu-min, deputy chairman of the nationalities committee of
 the All-China People's Congress.
 3.  The Moslem Movem?,nt;in the Northwest
 Moslem separatist movements in Shensi, Kansu  and Sinkiang provinces
 reached their height in 186+ when Yakub Beg and others were virtual masters
 of Kashgar and the Tarim Basin.  It was not until the star of Tso Tsung-
 t'ang rose over the northwest that the Moslems in'Shensi were pacified in
 1870 and in Khotan, in Sinkiang Province, in 1878.  General Tso Tsung-t'ang's
 military feats were equaled only by the Chinese generals of the Han and
 T'ang dynasties who brought these Moslem territories under Chinese rule.
 Although the Chinese Communists met with little resistance in their
 occupation of the northwest and the far .Nest, Moslem resistance to Communism
 is still strong in these.areas.  This resistance even extends across the
 western Chinese border into Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union.  With the as-
 cendency of the Middle East, the homeland of Islam, Moslem unrest noses a
 serious threat to international Communism.                 76
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 Despite their gains with the more backward  minorities, the  Chinese
 Communists are apparently unable to find a solution for the Moslem question.
 The Ho-fei Anhwei Jih-pao of 29 June denounced Moslem rightists for charg-
 ing that the party nationality policy was designed  to deceive the people
 of the nation and that a people's democratic dictatorship was a dictator-
 ship over good people.
 The newspaper said that the ideology of the Moslems was, "all Moslems
 belong to one family," "Moslems must fight for their  religion, not their
 country," and "Moslems should unite and organize their own government."
 The Moslem movement was very much in the public eye in 1958.  Prepara-
 tions for the Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Region  have been under way  for
 years.  The region was finally organized in October 1958 under circumstances
 far from pleasant.  During the year,  unmitigated attacks were  leveled at
 Moslem rightists.  The China Association for the Promotion of Moslem Culture
 was disbanded.  Ma Chen-vu,, a powerful Moslem leader, was openly accused of
 misdeeds when he attended the Kansu People's Congress.  He was charged with
 organizing Moslem uprisings in the northwest since 1952.
 Issue No 34+ of the Min-tzu Hua-pao, published in October 1958, carried
 an article by Han Tao-jen, deputy secretary-general of the  Ningsia  party
 work committee, on the establishment of the Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Re-
 gion.  Praising the solidarity of the Moslems with the other nationalities
 in China, he said that the Moslems will make great economic and cultural
 progress with the establishment of a region especially for Moslems.  He said
 that in this 17,800-square-kilometer area there are 2 million   people, of
 whom 33 percent are Moslem.  Arable land in this area amounts to 7 mou and
 7 fen per person.  The area is rich in shale and petroleum.  A large field
 is now being worked &t Wu-chuang.  In contrast to the old Kuomingtang days,
 the areais being rapidly developed through the united efforts of the Moslem
 and Chinese people so that its inhabitants will enjoy a  bright future, the
 article said.
 On 16 October, the Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao reported  that  the  first
 plenary session of the party committee of the Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Re-
 gion was held in Yin-ch'tsn on 12 October.  Speakers at this session said
 that they were eager to study the works cf Chairman Mao and the General Line
 and policy of the party.  They pledged to participate enthusiastically in
 the manual labor program and to strengthen their ideology by remolding it.
 The 25 October issue reported that the first people's congress of the
 Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Region met on 24 October to select a slate of of-
 ficers for the regional government.  Among the delegates was Lin. Pao-chu, a
 member of the party politburo, who represented the party Central Committee
 and Chairman Mao. The main address was given by Liu K' o-p' ing, chairman of the
 preparatory committee for the Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Region.  His address
 traced the progress of the Moslems in the area under party  leadership and

 urged both cadres and the broad. masses to study Marxism-t ninism and the
 works of Mao Tse-tung in order to liberate their minds.  Pointing out that
 95 percent of the peasant households now  belong  to  people'?  communes,
 he urged early fulfillment of 1959 grain production targets.  Concluding,
 he praised the party's religious policy which permits no interference with
 each person's beliefs.
 The 24 October issue of the newspaper reported that in welcoming Lin
 Po-ch'u, Liu K'o-p'ing, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Ningsia
 Moslem Autonomous Region, said, "From the beginning of preparations for the
 establishment of the region, the central authorities have given due consid-
 eration to all Moslems.  The neighboring provinces and  autonomous regions
 have also given warm support.  China is making  agiant and all-round big
 leap forward in socialist construction.  Our various nationalities are con-
 tinuously developing their friendship and solidarity along  the  victories
 scored in the socialist cause. This meeting, is another vivid expression
 of the close unity among the various nationalities of China."
 On 27 October the newspaper reported that while addressing the second
 session of the congress Lin Po-ch'u reviewed the historical exploitation of
 the Moslems by their rulers and  Chinese,officials. Expressing the desire
 of the party to give full recognition to all  Moslems, he said, "After the
 liberation, the Communist Party abolished the system of racial oppression
 by introducing racial  equality. The party guarantees equality to Moslems
 who live in small numbers among other nationalities throughout the country.
 It has established four Moslem chous, nine autonomous hsiens, and several
 mixed Moslem minority hsiens.  The party has led the Moslems in implementing
 the democratic and socialist revolutions, improving living standards, and
 developing the economy, in addition to training &large number of Moslem
 cadres.  There has been a basic change in the Moslem society."
 Continuing,- he said, "In the spring of 1956, the party Central Commit-
 tee proposed the establishment of an aultonomcus Moslem region at the provin-
 cial level to meet the long-standing desire of the Moslems.  The establish-
 ment of the Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Region supplies this need and is a
 triumph of the party's nationalities policy.  The party's basic policy for
 the settlement of the nationality question is to provide regional autonomy
 for the various nationalities.  The work of the past few years has resulted
 in regional autonomy for 35 nationalities totaling 25 million people.  This
 is about 90 percent of the minority population living in compact areas."
 Concluding, he reviewed the tasks of the newly  organized region.  He
 called on all nationalities in the region to unite in the struggle to im-
 plement the party's General Line for socialist construction, to carry out
 the socialist revolution thoroughly, and to strengthen the people's communes.
 The region was called on to take positive steps to promote the cultural and
 technological revolutions and to accelerate the development of an over-all
 big leap forward in socialist construction in order to bring about  a basic
 change in the appearance of the region in the shoitest possible time.

 He closed his address with the following words:  "Many people's com-
 manes have been established in the region.  They are the basic unit of a
 socialist society and will also be the basic unit for the Conmiunist society
 in China.  Many people's communes in the region have both Moslem and Chi-
 nese members.  Such multinational communes are the basis for unity and co-
 operation among the minorities."
 On 28 October the newspaper reported that Wang Feng had recently told
 the people's congress of the Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Region that the in-
 terests of socialism and Communism should be taken into consideration in
 everything, that factors unfavorable for national unity should be overcome,
 and that vigilance should be.sharpened against undermining of national unity
 by imperialists and counterrevolutionaries.  "The  mass  line is the funda-
 mental political  and  organizational  line of the                           party," he continued.
 "The construction targets set for 1959 would be still higher, and to fulfill
 them, the masses should be widely mobilized."
 On 24+ October the newspaper gave the following data on  the region.
 The Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Region is located in the northeastern sector
 of Kansu Province.  It includes 12 hsiens and shihs and covers a total of
 77,800 square kilometers.  It has a population of 2 million people of sev-
 eral nationalities, but the Moslems predominate; they constitute two thirds
 of the people.  This former arid grazing area is rapidly being transformed
 into a highly productive agricultural area as well as an industrial center.
 An editorial in the 10 September 1958 issue of the Peiping periodical
 Chung-kuo Mu-szu-lin make strong attacks against Ma Chen-wu.  It said that
 his crimes were laiT bare by the fifth session of the first Kansu people's
 congress in May 1958 when he was accused of oppressing Chinese and Moslems
 in Hsi-chi, Ku-yuan, Hai-yuan, Chin-chih, Chang-chia-ch'uan, and Wu-chung.
 He not only utilized his religious position to inflame the populace against
 the regime, but also sold so-called religious medical cures to poison and
 kill the people.  Despite numerous warnings, he continued his crimes.  He
 even presented himself as the earthly representative of Allah.
 Reports appearing in the 7-17 May 1958  issues of the Ian-chou Kansu
 Jih-pao on the fifth session of the first Kansu Provincial People's Con-
 gress which opened on 6 May cited numerous speeches of the deputies attack-
 ing local nationalism among the Moslems in the area.  In her attacks, deputy
 Li Iei said, "In the Ningsia Moslem Autonomous Region, many people are not
 conscious of national solidarity.  Instead, they emphasize the differences
 between minorities in order to demand more privileges and to evade respon-
 sibility.  In their relations with other nationalities,  they  insist on
 special rights.  They  drive out Chinese and  other outside cadres, thus
 obstructing cooperation among the various nationalities. They negate the
 achievements of the party in minority areas, slander the party leadership,
 and attempt to sabotage relations  between the minorities and the party.
 They oppose socialist transformation and do not care for self-improvement."

 Deputy Wang Ting-chieh said, "Isolated cases still occur where the re-
 actionaries do their utmost to retain feudal privileges  and  exploit the
 people.   This obstructs and sabotages the production of the friasses and di-
 rectly affects production expansion as well as the livelihood -and improve-
 ment of the minorities.  We must  resolutely  and  mercilessly  struggle
 against reactionaries.  As for those reactionaries with ulterior motives,
 they must be severely punished."
 Ma Chu-hsuan, a Moslem woman deputy, pointed out that adventures in
 religious circles, taking advantage  of their feudal privileges  and com-
 pletely disregarding the law of the land, have prevented women from par-
 ticipating in socialist construction and interferd with their freedom of
 marriage, thus inhibiting their active participation in socialist construc-
 tion.  The broad  masses  of  women                     demand that this situation be corrected
 immediately.  The Moslem areas must implement the marriage law. This is
 the desire of the Moslem masses, especially the young men and women, she
 said.
 During the people's congress meeting on 9 May, the deputies concen-
 trated their attack on Ma Chen vu, a Moslem political "opportunist."  He
 was accused of openly supporting land reforms, but secretly sabotaging the
 movement.  He was said to have opposed the agriculture  cooperativization
 movement although he owns 2,000 mou of land and thousands of heads of live-
 stock.  It was charged that he hired 110 workers yhom he cruelly exploited.
 Deputy Na Chang-chi said accusingly, "To Ma Chen-vu, killing is second na-
 ture..  He told people that those who have killed will go to heaven.  A man
 tried to argue with him, and he sent people to  cut off one  of  his ears.
 When Ma Chen-wu visited the villages, he would come back loaded with money.
 He fattened himself at. the expense of the working masses.  He lives on hu-
 man flesh and blood."
 Adding to the accusations Wang Tzu-hou said,"On the eve -of the 8 May
 rioting, Ma Chen-wu called a meeting at Ping-liaug.  No one knows what he
 said to the Imams.  When I was at Ch'ang-hua Ch'uin Ku-yuan Hsien, Imam
 Ma Hsi-tsu told me that there was rioting and advised me not to leave."
 Ma Peng-chieh said, "On the eve of the 2 Apxl rioting in 1951, Ma
 Chen'wu sent his henchmen to Tung-shih, Hsi-chi-t'an, anu x[u-yuan to direct
 activities.  He touched off the rioting by slaughtering four  animals  to
 celebrate the Molib Nabawi festival."
 The paper said that Ma Chen-wu spoke in his c'efense before the deputies
 by telling lies and stressing minor matters.  He evaded all responsibility
 as well as the major issues involved in his rightist activities.  However,
 as the deputies exposed the crimes committed by 1  Chen-vu and others, who
 had cruelly oppressed and exploited the masses through the exercise of their
 feudal privileges, there were indications that the, struggle between the two
 roads of capitalism and socialism was still going on.  This  aroused  the

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 vigilance of the deputies, who expressed a strong determination to wipe out
 the ideological influence of all remnant feudal forces by forcefully criti-
 cizing capitalist ideology, the paper said.
 In the closing address before the congress, Chiang Tzu-hsin, secretary
 of the Kansu party committee, said, "As a result of the rectification cam-
 paign and:'the adtirjghttst struggle., the socialist revolution on the political
 and ideological fronts has basically succeeded, and changes more favorable
 to socialism have  occurred in  the    relation  between  classes.   The
 struggle between the two roads, however, is still not completed.  But fol-
 lowing the expansion of the socialist revolution and the                             development of
 socialist construction, the class struggle in China will gradually diminish
 until finally it vanishes altogether.  As for the ideological struggle to
 establish the proletariat and destroy the bourgeoisie, that will take longer.
 Failure to recognize this fact is dangerous."
 The same newspaper reported that rightist activities among the Moslems
 dominated sessions of the Kansu Islamic Association since its first meeting
 on 11 August 1958.  During subsequent  sessions  which  lasted  well  into
 September, such leading Moslems as Ma Shun-t'ein, Ian Hsiu-chai, Chin Tzu-
 ch'ang, Ma Ju-lin, Fu Lien-sheng, Ma Ju-i, Chang Teng-t'ing,Ku Jui-t'ing,
 ?4a tling-te, and Ma Chi-wing were accused of attacking the party and social-
 ism under the guise of promoting religion and safeguarding the interests of
 the minority nationalities.
 The 23 August issue of the Kansu Jih-pao reported that rightists such
 as Ma Shun-t'ien slandered Imams who cooperated with the regime and abused
 minority cadres.  Ma Ju-lin utilized "worship days" to stir up the masses
 and, in addition to threatening to kill party cadres, had managed to stop
 agricultural production for a month.  Ma Shun-t'ien sheltered counterrevo-
 lutionaries in Moslem mosques.  Ma Ju-i said, "The Communist party is sup-
 pressing innocent people and is treating them unjustly."  When a landlord
 was executed during the land reforms, Ian Hsiu-chai said, "The Communists
 behave like bandits.  They take people's property and injure them."  La
 Shih-ming said, "If the Communist Party succeeds, the first person it will
 kill is the Imam."  In an attempt to place religion above the state, he
 proposed the establishment of a "Ningsia Islamic Autonomous Chou."
 On 26 August, the newspaper reported that Ma Shun-t'ien and Lan Hsiu-
 chai were accused of swindling the public by levying money for the repair
 of mosques and tombs, but actually dissipating the funds by lewd living.
 They even tried to restore Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Pu-fang to power.  When
 Ma Bang openly revolted, Ma Shun-t'ien supported him by spreading rumors
 that Ma Liang had occupied Tibet, aircraft had arrived from Taiwan, new
 weapons had'arrived,and the Communists would soon be finished.  However, Ma
 Shun-t'ien still denied these accusations and threatened  to  arouse the
 masses if he were accused of being a rightist.

 The newspaper reported on 27 August that Lan Hsiu-chai supported the
 revolt in Ping-liang on 8 May 1952 and defended rightists by saying, "Ma
 Chen-wu is a religious man.  He has nothing to do with politics."
 The newspaper reported on 31 August that Ma Chen-vu was accused of
 plotting to set up a "Moslem Kingdom."  During the Japanese occupation of
 China, he tried to organize an  armed force and found a  "Moslem Kingdom"
 with Japanese support.  The "kingdom" covered Hsi-hai-ku, Ning-hsia, Ching-
 yuan, and Ching-ning.                     Ma Chen-wu cooperated with, Ma Liang, the puppet
 governor of Shantung Province during the Japanese occupation, and worked
 through Baron Ogazawara in Tokyo.  The plot fell through when the Japanese
 were defeated, it was said.
 On 4 September, the newspaper said that Kuo Nan-p'u wrote a confession
 which indicated Ma Chen-wen to be the instigator of the outbreak on 2 April.
 A Hsin-hua News Agency report of 17 October said tat Ma Chen-vu was for-
 merly high in the councils of the party.  He was formerly a member of the
 nationalities affairs committee of the former Nortawest Military  and Po-
 litical Administrative Committee, chairman of the Ku-yuan Moslem Autonomous
 Chou, a member of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political
 Consultative council, and deputy chairman of the Gina Islamic Association.
 Calling for a purge of "black sheep" from Islamic circles,  the news-
 paper editorially commented on 17 October, "Protection of freedom in reli-
 gious belief is one of the basic policies of the party and government.  We
 Communists are out-and-out atheists who believe it no religion.   But real-
 izing that religion is a product of the human society at a certain stage of
 development and that there is a law governing its origin, development, and
 elimination, we consistently stand for freedom of religious belief.  This
 is expressly laid down in the constitution of our country.  Over the past
 9 years since the liberation, we have repeatedly declared that each citizen
 make his own decision as to whether he believes or  does not  believe  in
 religion...the government will not only refrain from interfering   in the
 freedom of religion, but will protect it....
 "Simultaneous with this, we have repeatedly made it clear that reli-
 gious believers must observe state laws and that no person may exploit re-
 ligion for illegal activities.  Freedom in religion and the utilization of
 religion for counterrevolutionary activities are  two different things....
 Any person who exploits religious beliefs for counterrevolutionary activi-
 ties will be resolutely and ruthlessly suppressed by the government.  Ma
 Chen-vu is a heinous reactionary who works under the cloak of religion."
 On 9 November, the pro-Nationalist Yin-tu Jih Tpao (Chinese Journal of
 India) of Calcutta, India, carried extracts from t-e Yin-ch'uan Jih-pao,
 published in Yin-ch'uan, Kansu Province, on the Mslem situation  in that
 area.  The extracts stated that the Peiping State Council had issued orders
 to Hopeh, Shansi, Shensi, and Kansu provinces which instructed each province

 to raise a people's armed division of 10,000-15,000 Chinese to form a "land
 development army."  This force will be settled among the Moslem communities
 in Yin-ch'uan, Wu-chung, Chung-ning, and Ching-t'ai in the  Ningsia Moslem
 Autonomous Region of Kansu Province.  Li Ching-lin, a party secretary, has
 been designated the political commissar of this army.
 )4.  Unrest Among Local Minorities
 Reports of unrest continue to be carried in the press. The Moslems in
 the northwest and the lamas in Inner Mongolia are continuing their resist-
 ance to Chinese political and economic infiltration.
 Ulanfu, the leader of the Mongolians continues to prate the party line,
 but as early as 26 February 1958 Jen-min Jih-pao carried this quotation by
 him:  "The most basic slogan of the  local nationalists is,'Oppose assimi-
 lation-1 They point out that the ratio between the Mongolian  and Chinese
 population in Inner Mongolia is now one to seven."
 On 28 February, the Hsin-hua News Agency released an official report
 submitted to the Nationalities Committee of the All-China People's Congress
 which contained the following comment:
 "The question of accepting or rejecting Chinese cadres and immigrants
 is equated with the question of accepting of rejecting  socialism....  The
 chief reason given for rejecting the Chinese revolves around the so-called
 question of 4assimilation....  Natural assimilation among the nationalities
 will never be rejected because it represents a progressive trend in histori-
 cal development."
 The 30 July issue of the Nei-meng-ku Jih-pao  reported  that Ulanfu,
 chairman and first party secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
 had recently addressed a meeting of lamas of Silingol League (Mang).  He
 called on them to rally around the party and government by promoting sol-
 idarity and following the path to socialism.  Calling on the lamas to be-
 come progressive, Ulanfu pointed out that professional religious workers
 heretofore were handmaidens of the bourgeoisie.  The lamas assisted   the
 ruling clique to exploit the masses of Inner Mongolia.  "Now" said Ulanfu,
 "the bourgeoisie and feudal classes are wiped out, but the lamas still re-
 main.  The lamas must now follow the road to socialism.                         Some of them have
 already joined agricultural and livestock cooperatives.  This is best be-
 cause socialism and capitalism cannot coexist.  In his talk on dealing with
 contradictions within the ranks of the people, Chairman Mao  stated  six
 points to guide the lamas in their socialist reforms.  The government's
 policy on the freedom of religion has not changed."

 Ulanfu.continued by explaining that the lamas must not sabotage social-
 ism because such action constitutes contradictions which are not within the
 ranks of the people, but which are between the "enemy and ourselves."  He
 continued by criticizing lamas who follow the third road.
 "Since China's 600 million people are follo'ing the road to socialism,
 there is no alternative road," he pointed out.  "!The third road does not
 exist.  All lamas must realize that the Mongolians suffered under the
 bourgeois feudalistic regime.  Since the liberation, the masses have greatly
 improved their economic condition and they will appose lamas who seek to
 return to the old ways.  At present 100 percent cif the lamas in the Lu-t'u,
 96 percent in Wang-kai, and 85 percent in Ao-pao't'u temple have joined
 agricultural cooperatives."
 Ulanfu pointed out, "Lamas belonging to the'Hung-hsing agricultural
 cooperative are supposed to work 260 days a year.  They should actually
 work at least 220-240 days.  They may gradually develop the manual labor
 program, but lamas must engage in agriculture.  Otherwise, Inner Mongolia
 will lapse into economic chaos and even the lamas will not be able to
 continue to exist.  To engage in manual labor does not necessarily mean
 working in the livestock industry.  A doctor performing his duties or a
 craftsman engaged in handicraft production is in~luded,in the field of
 manual labor.  Old lamas should receive financial relief from the govern-
 ment and may undertake light duties."
 Concluding, Ulanfu told the lamas that participation in cooperatives
 would not interfere with their ordinary life.  They could still recite
 their scriptures without any restrictions, and property handed over to the
 cooperative would still yield an income at a fixed rate of interest."
 In response to Ulanfu's speech, several leading monks pledged the
 support of all. lamas for the party's leadership.' They said that the party
 is their savior and they will undergo reform in ?irder to embark on the road.
 to socialism.
 An item in the 29 May issue of the Peiping Kuang-ming Jih-pao reported
 that during the past years local nationalism. has' developed among the
 400,000 Moslems in Honan Province.  They have shown hostility to outsiders,
 failed to cooperate with other nationalities, and rejected Chinese cadres
 and peasants.  They attempted to create an all-9pslem area by driving out
 other nationalities.  Moslems refused to join cooperatives with other
 nationalities. They exaggerated national differences and made unreasonable
 demands for special foods and holidays.  They hoarded goods and illegally
 slaughtered draft animals.  They even tried to undermine the solidarity
 of the party by, creating nationality differences', so that members would be
 divided along nationality lines.  They refuse to learn from the Chinese
 and are constantly involved in quarrels with other nationalities.  They
 refuse to give food to Chinese cadres ^:1d even beat them up.  In Yeh-hsien

 Hsien of Ts'ao-chuang Moslem Ch'u, Moslems were so busy illegally slaughter-
 ing cattle and dealing in the black market that work attendance was only 60
 percent.  These shortcomings are being corrected through socialist education.
 On 31 October, the Hsin-hua News Agency reported that delegates to the
 second plenary conference of the China Association for the Promotion of
 Moslem Culture, held from 26 to 29 October 1953 in Yin-ch'uan, had approved
 the dissolution of the association.  In his closing address, Li K'o-p'ing,
 chairman of the association, reviewed the development of the Moslems in
 China and the organization of the association with the comment, "Although
 the China Association for the Promotion of Moslem Culture has now wound
 up its work and organizational functions, all Moslems must further their
 solidarity and devote greater efforts to socialist construction in addition
 to striving for the transition from socialism to Communism."
 In his report to the Tsinghai Provincial People's Congress, which was
 carried in the 4 July issue of the Hsi-ning Tsinghai Jih.-pao, Yuan Jen-yuan
 attacked the dissension created by former governor Sun Tso-pin among the
 various nationalities in Tsinghai.  Sun Tso-pin failed to implement party
 policies and even dropped the party membership designation in publishing lists
 of appointments.  He and his henchmen opposed the rectification movement and
 said that, although the party knows nothing about law, it still tries to rule
 over everything.
 Pointing out that the party observes its policy of freedom in religion,
 Yuan Jen-yuan attacked those who use religion as a cover to carry on
 counterrevolutionary activities.  He praised the arrest of Hsia-jih-chuang,
 To.-erh-chi, Cha-hsia, and others. Utilizing religion as their cloak, these
 culprits worked with "imperialist spies," converted mosques and temples into
 centers for counterrevolutionary activities, circulated all kinds of rumors,
 organized armed rebellion, promoted counterrevolutionary outbreaks, opposed
 socialism, attempted to overthrow the people's regime, violated the con-
 stitution, and endangered national security.  He closed with a warning to
 the minority nationalities in the grazing areas against participation in
 counterrevolutionary activities.
 In the 10 September issue of the Chum-kuo Mu-zsu-lin, Yang Cheng-ying
 wrote an article attacking Ma Chen-vu and other Moslem "turncoats" aho
 instigated riots against the regime.  Ma Chen-vu was accused of hiding Ma
 Chen-hua and other leaders of the 2 April 1956 uprising in a Moslem temple
 in Wu-chung Autonomous Chou.  Ma Chen-wu pointed out that, since the out-
 breaks on 8 May., 2 April, and ~- April have failed, it will be necessary to
 have another outbreak on 1 June [no year givenj.  He printed 1,000 paper
 charms and distributed them to Moslems with the admonition that they must
 wear them while fighting so that they can go to heaven after death.  He
 designated a word as the signal for the uprising and ordered 200,000 chin
 of grain stored in January 1958.'  He used the cover word "charcoal" for
 grain.  On 8 May, he inspected his prey irations and planned to stage an
 uprising at the first opportunity.

 The 16 July-issue of the Sinkiang Jih-pao reported that on 22 June the
 Kasghar intermediate and municipal courts held a joint session to try a
 group of criminals.  Several Uighurs were sentenced to death for murder which
 had taken place during robberies and family quarrels.  The son of a landlord
 was sentenced to prison for evading taxes, violating grain. control regulations,
 and leading an immoral life.
 The 26 July issue carried a report of the recent rectification movement
 conference of the Sinkiang panty committee.  While praising the achievements
 of the movement, the conference pointed out that it lacked depth and breadth.
 It ordered the third stage of the movement ended about the end of July 1958,
 when a review of the first three stages would be'made.  The conference
 called for a determined struggle against rightists exposed in the course of

 Part 2.  POLITICAL
 A.   Central Government Minority Policies
 Through the centuries, unrest among the minority nationalities
 inhabiting China's frontiers has always been of great concern to Chi-
 nese authorities.  Remembering that the Chin Tartars, Mongols, and
 Manchus once ruled China, the authorities adhered to a policy of sup-
 pression to keep the minority nationalities in line.  The Communist
 regime has not succeeded in improving the situation,. The Tibetans
 traditionally remained aloof.  The Outer Mongolians succeeded in
 achieving full independence from China with the upsurge of Soviet in-
 fluence.  The Uighurs in Sinkiang recently openly declared for in-
 dependence.
 The whole question of discontent among the minorities was serious
 enough to receive the attention of Mao Tse-tung.  In his speech, "on
 Dealing With Contradictions Within the Ranks of the People," he suc-
 cinctly pointed out that the people in Tibet were not ready for social-
 ist transformation; therefore, such changes should be delayed for 6
 years or longer.  In July 1957, top government leaders, including Mao
 Tse-tung, Chou En-lai, and Ulaiifu, held a conference in Tsingtao,
 Shantung Province, to discuss minority problems and work out a long-
 range policy for dealing with local nationalism.
 An editorial entitled "Why Is It Necessary to Combat Local Nation-
 alism?" appearing in the 27 June 1958 Peiping Jen-min Jih` was re-
 printed in full in the 29 June Hu-ho-hao-t'e Nei-meng-ku Jihh- ao_to
 lay down the party line for cadres.  The editorial reviewed achieve-
 ments of the party and government in Sinkiang and lashed out at local
 nationalists who are sowing seeds of discord among the nationalities
 as well as between them and the Chinese.  Admitting the existence of
 vestiges of Chinese chauvinism, the editorial had the following to say
 about the activities of local nationalists.
 "The policy of local autonomy for minority nationalities adopted
 by China is based on historical conditions and the current situation
 within the nation.  This policy is fully compatible with the principles
 of Marxism and Leninism and is for the common welfare of all nation-
 alities in the building of socialism"

 The editorial adds, "Local nationalist activities against this policy
 are being carried out by landlord and bourgeois elements.  Pretending
 to uphold the interests of minorities, they have actually done these groups
 great harm.   They call themselves Marxist-Leninists, but they are peddling
 revisionism.  They not only oppose the policies of centralized party
 leadership and national autonomy, but, also the General Line of the party
 during the transitional period in hopes of remaking minority areas in the
 image of the bourgeoisie.
 "Bourgeois rightists, who disguise themselves as nationalists, are
 agents of the landlords and bourgeoisie.  They have the ideology of a
 fast disappearing class.  Some have connections with imperialist ele-
 ments which direct their sectarian activities."
 Concluding, the editorial pointed out that "local nationalism is
 a vestige of the old society.  To overcome this ideological influence,
 it is necessary to initiate a long-term struggle.  Although some people
 engage in sectarian activities, most people in the minority areas are
 willing to follow the leadership of the party to socialism on the basis
 of national solidarity.  Local nationalists must be educated patiently
 on the principle of unity-criticism-unity.  Their--mistakes must be pointed
 out clearly to them.  They can then realize that only national unification
 and racial solidarity can develop the nation's socialist economy and
 culture so that the people of all nationalities can enjoy a bright and
 prosperous future."
 To strengthen the illusion that China is a big., happy, multinational
 family, the government sent a large delegation tothe Afro-Asian writers
 conference in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR.  The Jen-min Jih-pao reported on
 13 October 1958 that members of the delegation included Mao Tun, the
 chief; Tzunung Hadir, a Uighur; ICurban Lai, a Kazakh; and Malchinfu and
 Saiichaoteku, two Mongolians.  In his opening speech to the conference,
 Mao Tun talked about a visit by Chang Chien to Tashkent sometime be-
 tween 100 and 200 B. C., the introduction of Buddkism to China from
 Samarkand, and the travels of Ta Heien and Hsuan ''sang to India.  He
 also said, "We hope that the conference will make more contributions to
 upholding national independence, opposing colonialism, and protecting
 and developing national culture...."
 An important phase of the central government"s minority policy is
 the creation of written languages for the various minorities.  A written
 language would presumably increase the efficiency of the minority cadres.
 Projects for creating written languages were subjected to long discussions
 at all levels.

 The 22 January 1958 Nan-ning Kwangsi Jih-pao reported that the
 63d plenary session of the State Council on 29 November 1957 approved
 the final plan for the written language of the Chuang nationality in
 Kwangsi Province.  The popularization of the written Chuang language
 began in May 1957. After about half a year of study, over 350,000
 students mastered this writing.  A written knowledge will help to
 strengthen the management of cooperatives and thus improve production.
 Completely illiterate Chuang cadres can now record wage points, audit ac-
 counts, read newspapers, and write letters.  This is a case of the
 realization of the nationality policy of the party and a concrete ex-
 ample of the party's solicitude for the cultural improvement of minority
 nationalities, the paper said.
 The 19 April editorial of the Jen-min Jih-pao commented on the
 28 March to 16 April 1958 second conference on Scientific Discussions
 of Linguistic Work Among Minority Nationalities by pointing out that,
 since the first conference in December 1955, the linguistic program for
 minorities had been basically realized.  A. "political principle" the
 editorial said, was resolved with the adoption of a Latin alphabet for
 the romanization of Chinese.
 In his "Current Task of Language Refoxi' Premier Chou En-lai said,
 "While creating or reforming languages for the various nationalities,
 the writing must hereafter be based on the Latin alphabet and must con-
 form to the phonetic system adopted for the Chinese language in the
 pronunciation and use of the Latin alphabet."
 With this ideological point settled, linguistic personnel were
 urged to increase their efforts.  They must plunge into a "3-year
 bitter struggle" to complete written language for multilingual minor-
 ity nationals and to initiate programs for the reform of minority
 languages where necessary.
 Pointing out that personnel engaged in linguistic work must promote
 harmony and not stress racial differences, the editorial attacked the
 "purists" 'who exclude expressions which were introduced from Chinese or
 other languages and are now in common use as a part of the minority
 language.
 "Borrowed expressions do not negate, but enrich, national culture
 and are a development of the national language," the editorial pointed
 out, with an added comment that any attempt to exclude such borrowed
 expressions would be promoting racial differences.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 Laying down the correct line for linguistic work, the editorial
 severely criticized subjectivism among the cadres who keep data to
 themselves by stamping them "scientific-secret" or who stake out a
 "field" and beat off any trespassers.  "Errors in ideology and work,"
 the editorial concluded, "were exposed during the second conference on
 the Scientific Discussions of Linguistic Work Among Minority Nation-
 alities and were corrected in time."
 A Hsin-hau (New China) News Agency dispatch dated 21 June 1958
 said that the Sinkiang committee on minority languages has drafted
 Latin alphabets for the Uighur, Kazakh, Mongolian, Khakha, and Hsi-po
 languages of minorities living in the Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Region.
 The Arabic written script now in use prevents these languages from
 meeting the needs of the development of socialist construction in the
 region.  The adoption of a Latin alphabet will strengthen the nation as
 well as the solidarity of the nationalities.  In the compilation of
 technical terms, due weight will be given to these terms borrowed from
 the Chinese language which are now in common use' among the local nation-
 alities.
 The central government's policy of creating a written language
 was only one of the innovations planned for the national minorities.
 Economic, sociological, and cultural changes are being introduced
 relentlessly. The cadres were naturally confused when faced with the
 resistance of the minority nationals.  Since they are inclined to fol-
 low the hard line, central authorities felt obligated to lay down the
 correct line for them.
 The,3 April 1958 issue of the Peiping Kuan -min  Jih-pao carried
 an article by Wang K'e and Tsui Chien on the correct treatment of
 minority customs which presented an exhaustive analysis of practices
 among the minorities and their impact on socialism.
 The writers warned cadres against such hasty conclusions as all
 minority practices are "good" or "bad," or that certain customs are
 generally observed throughout any one minority area.  Such hasty de-
 cisions, they pointed out, play into the hands Of local nationalists
 who create dissension within the minority group 'under the pretext of
 making concessions to common customs and practices and thus endanger
 the course of socialism adopted by the national-minorities.

 Continuing, the writers attacked such practices as offering oxen
 for sacrifices, not watering fields, accumulating fertilizer, not
 working on *taboo" days, and arranging marriages through matchmakers.
 Citing the case of Kawa nationals who now use monkey instead of human
 heads for sacrifices, they point out that abominable customs can be
 changed.
 Concluding, they said, "If we think the customs and practices of
 the national minorities utterly bad, or even try to compel the minorities
 to change them, we will be guilty of reactionary Chinese chauvinism.
 This is trying to assimilate other nationalities forcibly.  On the other
 hand, 'it is equally erroneous to think that respect for national customs
 and practices means that harmful practices must never be changed.  Cadres
 must assist the minorities in making reforms.  All party members and
 cadres belonging to national minorities must positively take the lead
 and reform bad customs in order to promote the development of socialism
 in monrity areas."
 A Hsin-hua News Agency dispatch dated 30 April 1958 said that since
 the adjournment of the nationality work conference in Tsingtao in July
 1957, meetings have been held in minority areas in Kweichow, Yunnan,
 Tsinghai, Kansu, Honan, Hopeh, and Kirin provinces to study the reports
 of Premier Chou En-lai, Deputy Premier Ulanfu, and others.  The facts
 reveal that local nationalists are ambitious elements who oppose the
 interests of the nationalities to launch criminal activities against
 the party and socialism in order to undermine the solidarity of the
 nationalities in China, the dispatch said..
 Rectification and socialist education campaigns are being conducted
 in minority areas in the light of local conditions, according to the
 dispatch.  In areas where the socialist transformation of the ownership
 of the tools of production is already completed, the masses and cadres
 should hold frank discussions on the two roads of socialism and capital-
 ism, and antirightist struggle, and criticism of local nationalism.
 The dispatch added that in minority areas which have basically
 completed democratic reforms and have begun programs of socialist
 transformation, patriotic education, tailored to local conditions, is
 being initiated.  In minority areas where democratic reforms are still
 not implemented, cadres have initiated socialist propaganda for the
 masses.  Patriotic socialist education began in Tibet in January 1958.
 Exhibitions contrasting past and present living conditions of the
 minorities have clearly demonstrated to the people in minority areas the
 bright prospects of socialism, according to the dispatch.

 On 24 May 1958, the Jen-min Jih-pao reported that, in a speech
 marking the seventh anniversary of the peaceful-liberation of Tibet,
 General Chang Ching-vu pointed out that the central government had
 sent large numbers of Chinese to assist the Tibetans in carrying out
 economic, cultural, and other programs; that both civil and military
 Chinese personnel have energetically carried out the agreement for the
 peaceful liberation of Tibet and that the Chinese have respected the
 religious traditions of the Tibetans.
 Pointing out that Chinese authorities were able to provide a
 working formula for Tibetan officials in Lhasa, Gyangtse, and Chamdo,
 General Chang Ching-vu according to the paper, said that Tibet's return
 to the homeland had wiped out the vestiges of imperialism in Tibet.
 Now, under the peaceful policy of the central government, cordial
 relations are maintained with India, Nepal, and other neighboring states,
 he said.
 Commenting on the armed forces, General Chang Ching-wu said that
 although ranks of the regular army have been conferred on officers of
 the local Tibetan army, it is still necessary to'
 .improve the patriotic
 education of the local Tibetan, troops before they can be reorganized
 as part of the national defense force.
 Concluding, General Chang stressed the necessity for the establish-
 ment of a socialist society in Tibet and the formal organization of the
 Tibet Autonomous Region and warned against local as well as Chinese
 chauvinism and the schismatic plots of imperialists and counterrevo-
 lutionaries.
 An item in the 30 June 1958 issue of the Nevi men -ku Jih- ao said
 that on 27 June 1958,the Inner Mongolia party committee called a meeting
 to map plans for the fourth stage of the rectification movement.  Ad-
 dressing the meeting, Wang Feng, secretary of the party committee, an-
 nounced that the "theory and practice" stage of the movement had come
 to a close.  He urged cadres to study carefully the speeches given before
 the second session of the Eighth Party Congress by Chairman Mao in order
 to overcome subjectivism, dogmatism, and empiricism.  He called on edu-
 cational circles to discuss emphasis on the old and new, on legal circles
 to discuss rightism and the class struggle, and on advanced institutions
 of learning to discuss the need to be "red and skilled."
 As to the fourth stage of the rectification movement, Wang Feng de-
 Glared that this was the last stage of the movement and it should not be
 allowed to slither out like a snake since the movement began with the
 roar of a lion.  Listing the four points for this.: stage of the movement..
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 he said that cadres must study documents an rectification in order to
 strengthen their political stand, promulgate the party's main line, and
 correctly understand Marxism-Leninism.  He also called on the cadres to
 promote frank discussions in order to arrive at a mutual understanding.
 They must write a summation of their self-criticism and submit it for
 review.  Finally, they must work out a plan to be "red and skilled."
 In Inner Mongolia, the Chinese authorities continued to promote
 their policies by.criticizing the errors of local nationalism and of-
 fering rewards of "autonomy."
 On 3 August 1958, the Nei-meng-ku Jih-pao reported that the 0-wen-
 k'o Autonomous Banner was formally established at the first people's
 congress held in Nan-t'un on 30 July 1958.  The congress elected a
 people's council of 19 members, with T'u-meng-pa-ya-erh, an 0-wen-k'o,
 as chairman; and Yu-li-chi and Meng-k'o, Mongolians, and Pi-li-k'o-t'u,
 a Daghur, as deputy chiarmen.
 In addition to passing resolutions attacking Anglo-American
 "aggression" in the Middle East, the congress sent greetings to Chairman
 Mao to report the formal establishment of the banner and to pledge
 national solidarity and full support of socialist construction.
 "Under the guidance of the party and Chairman Mao," the message
 said, "and the brilliant light of the party's General Line, the banner
 will complete the assignments of the revised draft program of the
 development of agriculture and livestock growing in the Inner Mongolia
 Autonomous Region ahead of schedule."
 A similar greeting to Ulanfu, chairman of the Inner Mongolia
 party committee, pointed out that the establishment of the 0-wen-k'o
 Autonomous Banner was "another signal victory of the policies of the
 party and government."

 The 0-wen-k'o nationality includes peoples formerly included in the
 So-lun, Ya-k'u-te, and T'ung-ku-shih groups.  Although a majority are
 concentrated in the six somons of the I-min Ho watershed, these nomads
 are scattered from Sinkiang to Heilungkiang.  The newly organized banner,
 with its capital at Nan-t'un, has 2,457 people of the 0-wen-k'o; 3,697 of
 the Mongolian; 1,869 of the Daghur; 1,265 of the Chinese; and 48 of the
 Moslem, Manchu, Tibetan, and Korean nationalities.
 Editorially commenting on the establishment of the banner, the
 Nei-meng-ku Jih-pao pointed out that during the feudal Manchu days no-
 mads in the Hulunbuir plain were designated "Soluns" although the people
 called themselves "0-wen-k'o."  These people are linlmd to the Ya-k'u-te
 and T'ung-ku-shih people by cultural ties.  During the Manchu, warlord,
 and Japanese imperialist regimes, the nomads were ruthlessly exploited
 the editorial said.  Concluding, the editorial laid down tasks for the
 reform and development of the livestock industry.
 on. 15 August 1958, the Mo-li-ta-wa Daghur Autonomous Banner was
 formerly inaugurated at Ni-erh-chi, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
 the Nei-meng-ku Jih-pao reported 19 August 1958.  After hearing work
 reports and future plans, the meeting elected Pa-t'u-pa-ya-erh, a
 Daghur, to be chairman; Tsui Hsi-hsien, a Chinese; and T'u-jung, an
 O-wen-k'o, to be deputy chairman; and Po-yen, and 0-wen-k'o, to be
 chief of justice of the people's court of the Mo'li-ta-wa Daghur Auto-
 nomous Banner.  The meeting sent greetings to Chairman Mao which said,
 "Since the revolution and under the correct leadership of the party,
 the banner has successfully completed the democratic and socialist
 revolutions, and has achieved outstanding results in the socialist re-
 volution.  Oppression, bias, and distrust have given way to equality,
 solidarity, and mutual cooperation...."
 The Mo-li-ta-wa Daghur Autonomous Banner is located in the northern
 part of Inner Mongolia.  The word "mo-li-ta-wa" in Daghur means "a
 mountain range which looks like a horse."  The banner was formerly known
 as the Mo-li-ta-wa banner.  Of the 63,944 people in the area, 14,929 are
 Daghurs; 46,024, Chinese; and 3,041, 0-wen-k'o Mongolian, Moslem, Korean,
 or Orunchun.
 Speaking at the founding ceremonies, Pa-t'u-pa-ya-erh, chief of the
 Mo-li-ta-wa Daghur Autonomous :Banner, said that in the past 9 years
 oppression and bias against the minorities have changed to mutual trust
 and unity under the brilliant light of the party's nationality policy.  He
 added that the multinational homeland has been able to improve its racial
 solidarity.  However, he said, schismatic bourgeois local nationalist
 have demanded a Daghur chou despite the fact the Daghurs are few in number

 and scattered.  They complain that without an autonomous chou, the Daghurs
 cannot make economic, political, and cultural progress.  They say that
 the economy of the mountain area is getting worse daily.  They are wreck-
 ing national solidarity and party leadership under the guise of promoting
 the rights of nationalities.  This erroneous thinking must be corrected by
 a thorough study of party documents and a rectification drive, he con-
 cluded.
 Echoing these sentiments, Su Ch'ang-te, first party secretary of the
 Mo-li-ta-wa Daghur Autonomous Banner, pointed out that the founding of
 the autonomous banner was a signal victory of the party's nationality pol-
 icy in the struggle against local nationalism.  He noted that, in the
 struggle against the two paths in nationality affairs, attacks against
 Chinese chauvinism were strong while local nationalism was treated lightly.
 Su said that during.the review of nationality affairs in 1952 and 1955,
 only Chinese chauvinism was criticized, with the result that in 1956
 serious errors of local nationalism were committed during promotion of the
 Daghur autonomous banner.  To correct this error, he added, the national-
 ities must treat their problems from the viewpoint dialectical materialism.
 The nationalities must learn from the experiences gained in the struggle
 against rightists and the rectification movement.  To complete the tasks
 assigned to the banner under the nation's agricultural program, cadres and
 broad masses of the banner must study party policies and the experiences
 gained from various campaigns.  They must overcome conservatism.and hold
 frank discussions to deal with contradictions within the ranks of the
 people, Su concluded.
 Editorially commenting on the founding of the banner, the Nei-meng-
 ku Jih-ppao praised the high quality of the Daghur people and their struggle
 against  feudalistic oppression.  It pointed out that the founding of the
 banner settled the question of the Daghur nationality which the party
 decided in 1956 should be a separate group.  Although concentrations of
 Daghurs are scattered over wide areas, the government decided to locate
 the banner in the Mo-li-ta-wa plain.  Now that these people have their own
 territory, they should guard against the errors of local nationalism as
 well as Chinese chauvinism by forever following the leadership of the party,
 the paper said.
 B.   Minority Reaction to Central Government Policies
 Chinese Communist propaganda stresses "achievements" of the govern-
 ment's  minority policy and gives the illusion to people at home and abroad
 not only that is "all well' with the minorities, but also that they are
 thriving and making spectacular socialist progress.

 The Jen-min Jih-pao said on 19 May 1958 that people of the various
 minority nationalities throughout the country have raised their political
 ideological level through the rectification and socialist education cam-
 paigns.                        By-learning to work together with the Chinese as well as with
 each other, the minority nationalities have overcome local nationalism
 and with heightened enthusiasm are actively promoting the big leap for-
 ward in production, the paper said.
 Farmers from the minority areas in Yunnan Province went to Chinese
 areas to learn advanced techniques in fertilizer accumulation, irrigation
 development, and use of modern farm implements, the paper noted.
 The improved level of political ideology of the minority nation-
 alities is leading them on the economic road to Communist prosperity,
 according to this account.  In 1958, agricultural cooperatives in areas
 occupied by various nationalities signed mutual assistance pacts.  Minority
 nationality peasants in the Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region said that
 the party is their mother; the cooperative, their home; and the Chinese,
 their elder brother.  The slogan of these peasants is "learn from the
 Chinese; imitate the Chinese."
 During 1958, according to the 8 May JenminJih-nao, the Chinese
 will make an all-out effort to promote the big leap forward in industry
 among, the minority people of Yunnan Province.  Chinese technicians re-
 cently left K'un-ming for the T'ai, I, Hani-I, and Te-hung T'ai - - Ching-
 po minority areas to build 655. small plants.                   The, government appropriated
 5 million yuan for conservation projects throughout the minority areas.
 Experts from engineering institutes in K'un-wing Will assist the minority
 nationalities in developing mines for nonferrous metal smelters.  Al-
 though minority areas are economically backward, they are rich in minerals.
 An editorial in the 19 October issue entitled "The National Minorities
 Are Advancing at Great Speed" pointed out that "in fact, backwardness will
 not hamper the national minorities in their pursuit of a forward leap in
 construction.  On the contrary, it demands that they carry out their con-
 struction at a greater pace."
 An item in the 29 April issue said that, with the exception of the
 Kawa nationality, the T'ai, Ching-po, Li-su, Han-1, La-hu, and other
 minority peoples live in compact communities along a 2,000-kilometer
 stretch of China's southern border.  There are 20 nationalities in Yunnan
 totaling 5.6 million.  Of this number, 3.8 million live in 8 autonomous
 chous and 11 autonomous hsiens.  In the Hsi-shuang Pan-na T'ai-ching-po
 and Hung-ho Han-i Autonomous Chous, 40 percent of-the households have
 Joined cooperatives.

 "The Yuan-en area of Yuan Chiang in Yunnan Province is occupied by
 the Pai, Ba-ni, Yao, and others totaling 13 nationalities, the 17 July
 1958 K'un-wing Yunnan Jih-pao said.  Although their feudalistic practices
 have not changed over the centuries, they have completed land reforms
 since the liberation and introduced cooperativization.  They have im-
 proved production relations and are promoting the big leap forward in
 agriculture.  They have learned to accumulate and use fertilizer.  They
 have overcome taboos for women.  Women formerly did not thin plants
 because this might kill off the family.  They did not work the soil be-
 cause it might offend the dragon.  They could not use the plow because
 it would harm the menfolk.  Women could not carry fertilizer because it
 smelled offensive to the men, the paper said.
 Other common taboos noted by the paper were against working on one's
 birthday or on the day of birth or death of one's parents and against
 being the first to plant grain, since this meant that person would be
 the first to die.
 But with the promotion of the big leap forward in agricultural pro-
 duction, the people are not only working on former taboo days, but even
 at night, the paper reported.  Women vying with the men are working in
 the fields to increase production.  Small industries and handicrafts now
 dot the villages.  Minority peasants can now produce artificial cotton
 fibers, turpentine, and No 200.cement, as well as mine asbestos, coal,
 and gold.  Transport has been mechanized, and this is a great improvement
 over the back breaking porter method.
 As a result of the great big leap forward movement, according to the
 paper, the minorities have overcome their conservatism and superstitions.
 Under the guidance of the party committee, they held criticism and self-
 criticism meetings to convince people of the benefits of using fertilizer
 and modern farming equipment.  Through such propaganda as blackboard
 newspapers, cartoons, "field schools," and group song-fests, the peasants
 are gaily sweeping white flags from the hills and replacing them with red
 ones, the account noted.
 The 22' August 1958 Hsi-ning Tsinghai Jih-pao said that, as a result
 of the big leap forward and the socialist education movement, minority
 nationalities have wiped away a great many of their taboos which had
 been inhibiting production.  For example, the Miao people in Lei-shan
 Brien, Kweichow Province, formerly refused to build irrigation works
 because they might "interfere with the dragon."  They fought plagues with

 offerings to the spirits.  They had 100 taboo days a year.  In the
 struggle for accumulating fertilizer, the Chuang ]people  in Kwangsi
 Province invaded bats' caves, which they had believed haunted by spirits,
 to collect guano.  Youth groups among the minorities are taking the lead
 in smashing age-old superstitions.
 In the Hsi-shuang Pan-na T'ai minority area of Yunnan Province, the
 paper said, Yu-ai-yang, a young woman, took the lead in breaking the
 national tradition that women must not handle plows.  She succeeded in
 the face of ridicule and was awarded a red flag by the party committee.
 Now the T'ai women are emulating her technique.
 In the Tung, Yao, Miao, and T'u-chia nationality areas in Hunan
 Province, the minorities have changed work-taboo days to high-production
 days, according to the paper.  Instead of offering; cattle as sacrifices
 in cases of sickness, the Miao and Li minorities of Hainan Island now
 organize health centers.  The people of Liang-shan in Szechwan Province
 formerly did not use fertilizer; now they realize the importance of
 spreading fertilizer and are building latrines to accumulate it.
 The November 1958 issue of the Peiping Min-tau T'uan-chieh (Minzu
 Tuanjie, Solidarity of the Nationalities) carried,,a letter written by
 Tien Hsing-ch'eng calling on minority cadres engaged in government work
 to reform themselves.  He said that despite the brilliant achievements
 of the party and government there are still minority cadres who con-
 sider themselves people apart from the masses of the homeland and refuse
 to understand the policies of the party.  In opposing the party, they
 exposed themselves as exploiters.  Citing his native place, Hui-li Hsien
 in Yunnan Province, he said that cadres there did not have the proper
 outlook because they were not reformed.
 Continuing, he pointed out that, although leading minority cadres
 had supported the struggle against Kuomintang reactionaries, worked for
 national solidarity and autonomy, and wiped out local bandits and special
 agents, many cadres from the upper social strata of the minority national-
 ities have retained vestiges of exploitation.  They have failed to im-
 prove their relations with the masses.  This danger to socialism must
 be corrected, he said.  They must undergo positive self-reform.  To
 achieve reform, they must positively participate in manual labor and
 understand its dignity. They must strengthen their ideology and relate
 theory to practice.  They must criticize themselves and confess every-
 thing to the party.                     They must work out a plan fort self-reform and actively
 participate in political movements, he said.

 .Commenting on this letter, the paper's editor pointed out that a
 united front among the upper strata of the minority nationalities is one
 of the long-range policies of the party.  He said that the party had
 striven over the years to unite upper strata of all minority nationalities
 which could be united.  The party will continue this policy of uniting
 minorities who love the party and government and work for socialism.
 However, he continued, with the upsurge of socialism, the need for reform
 among the upper strata of minority nationalities becomes more urgent.
 The upper strata must divest themselves of remnant thoughts of the exploi-
 tation class in order to keep up with socialist development of the home-
 land and the progress of the party.
 Despite its rosy propaganda about the minority areas, the regime
 often finds it necessary to stage "show trials" to make minority leaders
 hew to the party line.  Important personages, some high in the party and
 government, have been publicly humiliated.  Possibly because Sinkiang is
 under the control of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the attack
 against "local nationalists" there has been the strongest.
 Pu-i-na-sheng wrote that under the brilliant leadership of the
 party, the Mongolians in Sinkiang have made rapid progress in cultural
 development, according to the Urumchi Sinkiang Jih-pao of 4 May.  Con-
 tinuing, he said that in the old days a m n had to ride for miles to find
 a person who could write a letter for him.  Now Mongols are enrolled in
 Sinkiang College, Sinkiang Medical College, and institutions of learning
 in China.
 He attacked local nationalists who advocate the organization of
 Uighuristan and Pledged a struggle to the end against local nationalists
 who are creating dissension in the ranks of the people.
 Without the Chinese brothers, he concluded, the minorities of China
 would not be able to develop modern industry and culture.  The Mongolians,
 he said, would welcome more Chinese cadres to Sinkiang for the construc-
 tion of socialism.
 A similar reaction was expressed in the 17 May issue of the Sin
 Jih-pao.   In an article attacking the local nationalist attitude toward
 the reform of intellectuals, Lin Po-min pointed out that such statements
 as "there are no rightists in Sinkiang' and "since Sinkiang is near the
 Soviet Union, its intelligentsia have not been exposed to the influences
 of bourgeois nations" are erroneous.  He said that, opposing the party's
 policy of reform for the intelligentsia, local nationalists claim that
 such reform is in reality labor reform and would injure minority cadres.
 They insist that the intelligentsia in Sinkiang do not need reform.

 Admitting that exposure to the Soviet Union was helpful, Lin Po-
 min pointed out that this was not a decisive factor in revolutionizing
 the intelligentsia of Sinkiang.  Continuing, he said that cases have
 come to light of Chinese who had studied in the soviet Union, yet they
 opposed the Soviet Union and Communism because of remnant bourgeois
 thinking and a lack of a firm political ideology.  Concluding, he called
 on the intelligentsia in Sinkiang, especially the students, to overcome
 remnant bourgeois ideology and to oppose local nationalism by isolating
 elements advocating a "Great Sinkiang" independent of the homeland.
 In support of this stand, an item in the 2 June issue of the Nei-
 meng-ku Jih-pao said that, attacking Te-pu-hein's:criticism of minority
 language work, Tsao-tu-pi-li-k"o denied that Mongolian was being treated
 in such a way that it would soon become archaic because "many people are
 forgetting Mongolian," so that although it has made progress along certain
 lines, it has receded in the over-all picture.  To the contrary, Tsao
 tu-pi-li-k'o said, old works in Mongolian have been dug out of storage
 and popularized because more people can read Mongolian now.  With the
 organization of four universities in Inner Mongolia, more Mongolians now
 can get a higher education.  Concluding, he warned against rightists who
 claim to "defend the rights of minorities" but are actually utilizing
 their love of the nationalities to serve the bourfeoisie.
 The 22 August issue of the Lhasa Tibet Jih_pao reported that party,
 government, and ecclesiastical officials had met recently in Lhasa to
 express their support of the Mao-Khrushchev statement and to attack
 Anglo-American "aggression" in the Middle East.  Bringing the discussion
 closer to home, Ngapho Shape, secretary-general of the Tibet Autonomous
 Region Preparatory Committee', pointed out that "the important spirit of
 the communique of the Mao-Khrushchev talks. is to prevent the Anglo-
 Americans from playing with fire in the Middle Eat and to protect the
 people all over the world who love peace.  The 806 million people of
 China and the Soviet Union love peace, support national independence
 movements in all countries, and firmly oppose the criminal aggressive
 acts of the imperialists.  At present, counterrevolutionary cliques in
 Tibet are stirring up rebellion under the direction of imperialists.
 In consultation. with each other, the Tibet party work committee, the
 Tibet Military Region, and the `abet local government have worked out
 peaceful methods for the solution of this problem.;',  If these methods fail,
 then we are determined to suppress and wipe out all rebels."

 Echoing these sentiments, the newspaper reported on the 23d that
 women's circles in Zhikatse no longer look askance at politics as some-
 thing beyond their ken.  After hearing reports on the Mao-Khrushchev
 communique and Anglo-American "aggression" in the Middle East, they have
 increased their political alertness against the rumormongering and sabo-
 tage activities of counterrevolutionaries, the paper said.
 Similar sentiments were expressed in an item in the 21+ May issue
 of the Jen-min Jih-pao. Marking the seventh anniversary of the "peaceful
 liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini sent felicita-
 tions to Chairman Mao.   Pledging, loyalty to the party and government,
 their messages expressed determination to combat local chauvinism, to
 strengthen Sino-Tibetan relations, and to fully implement the 17-point
 agreement for the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
 Ngapho Shape, secretary-general of the Tibet Autonomous Region
 Preparatory Committee; and Thupten Tendar, director of the civil affairs
 department of the preparatory committee and concurrently secretary-
 general of the local Tibet government, pointed to improvements in the
 status of Tibetans by saying that most of the personnel of the government
 offices are now Tibetans.  Over 5,000 Tibetan cadres were trained in the
 past yearn.
 C.  Unrest Among Local Minorities
 Reports of growing unrest among the local nationalities in the
 Chinese press continue to increase.  Slight mention of dissatisfaction
 among the minorities had appeared along with other criticisms during the
 "Hundred Flowers" period.  Although positive steps were taken subsequently
 to quell any open criticism, the "speaking up" which began as a trickle
 apparently gushed forth with the pent-up fury of a downtrodden people.
 Social reforms had to be "delayed" in Tibet.  Local nationalists in Sink-
 iang wanted to organize a completely independent "Uighur Republic."  Mos-
 lems throughout northern and northwestern China raised their arms as well
 as their voices.
 The 29 March issue of the Tsinan 7h-chung Jih-pao reported that at
 the 21i March 1958 fourth Shantung nationality work conference, cadres
 found growing local nationalism among the minorities in Shantung since
 the socialist transformation in production.  The manifestations of this
 feeling are found in the refusal of the minorities to acknowledge the
 advanced status of the Chinese, the refusal to offer help, and open hos-
 tility to Chinese cadres working in the area, the paper said.  They re-
 fused to belong to the same cooperative as the Chinese who eat pork.  As
 101

 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-0,2646R000400370001-3
 a result, rightists are isolating the minorities by creating dissension
 under the guise of protecting the interests of minorities and their
 religion.  Such actions not only endanger the solidarity of the nation,
 but also the peaceful development of the national minorities, according
 to this account.
 The newspaper added that the conference decied that the solidarity
 of the nationalities must be strengthened by giving every minority nation-
 ality family a thorough socialist education and by organizing them to learn
 advancedexperiences from the Chinese so that the great unity of all. na-
 tionalities will be consolidated around the Chinese.
 The 16 May issue of the Jen-min Jih-pao reported that during the
 previous 5 months Moslem circles in Honan Province staged a vigorous
 struggle against rightists.  During the "contendig" period in 1957,
 Hsieh Hsi-san, Mai Ming-tao, Pai Ch'ing-chang, anc Wan Chin-Jung posed
 hypocritically as defenders of the Moslems in ordgr to attack the party
 and government, the paper noted.  They said that the Moslems of the
 world are one great family and that "religion comes before country."  They
 called Moslem cadres traitors and said that the growing farm cooperative
 system was leaving no future for the Moslems.
 The 29 March issue of the Cheng-chou Honan J,h-pao reported that
 local nationalism problems dominated the recent nationalities work con-
 ference of the United Front Department of the Honan party committee.
 Painting a dreary picture of disunity, Chinese de'egates accused the Mos-
 lems of emphasizing the gap between nationalities, black-marketing, ille-
 gal slaughtering, and violations of the law.  A nqw growth of local na-
 tionalism was reported stemming from the selfishness of petty producers,
 remnants of age-old differences among the nationalities, unsolved problems
 among the minorities, and activities of the rightists in 1957.  Over 30
 Moslem households which were resettled in Tainghai Province came back to
 Honan; then they left again for Tsinghai.
 The conference called on the cadres to urge the minorities to
 strengthen the unity of nationalities, to distinguish right from wrong,
 to solve the problems of resettlement, to find new methods of production,
 to stop black-marketing, to return to the farms, and to accept the leader-
 ship of the party, the paper reported.
 The situation in Tibet is not showing any improvement despite stern
 measures by the Chinese authorities to pacify the local populace.  Ac-
 cording to a dispatch of the Hsin-hua News Agency dated 25 March 1958,
 1 11  2
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 when the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee held a routine
 meeting on 24+ March to discuss current tasks, officials were called on
 to guard against schismatic elements and to improve their political
 consciousness by studying government policies and current events.  The
 meeting also called for intensification of ideological and socialist
 education for the masses.  It pointed out that, since the abolition of
 the corvee, the recruitment and training of Tibet cadres are greatly
 facilitated.
 Reflecting the current situation in Tibet, the 12 November issue
 of Jen-min Jih-pao carried a terse item reporting the initial organi-
 zation of a people's armed unit in Lhasa.  Although the unit includes
 both Tibetans and Chinese, the item reported, most of the men were mem-
 bers of the Tibet Expeditionary Force which entered Tibet 8 years ago.
 The situation in Sinkiang reached such serious, proportions that
 the Sinkiang party committee had to call a plenary session to discuss
 it and to expel members from its "inner circle" for advocating local
 nationalism.  The 14 May issue of the Sinkiang Jih-pao reported that
 on 28 April 1958 the Sinkiang-party committee met in Urumchi to re-
 view the 1+.5 month struggle against local nationalism.  During the
 period, local nationalists in the Urumchi area were exposed and purged
 from the government.  They had not only obstructed the building of
 socialism in Sinkiang, but also gave aid and comfort to the imperialists.
 Calling for a determined struggle against imperialism, the meeting urged
 cadres to first overcome sectionalism and subjectivism among their ranks,
 the paper said.
 The newspaper reported on 4 May 1958 that the editorial staff of
 the monthly Shu-kuang,(Light of Dawn) recently wrote in praise of the
 party's nationality policy.  The journalists said that the party must
 be protected "like one's eyes" and that all nationalities must support
 racial solidarity and the unity of the country.  They also praised. the
 action of the Sinkiang party committee in exposing the rightists in the
 course of the struggle against local nationalism.
 In closing, the writers pledged to carry out the spirit of the
 Sinkiang party conference by initiating a broad struggle against local
 nationalism and dealing powerful blows against its leaders.
 Another item in the same issue said that A Said, mayor of Urumchi,
 was accused of antiparty rightist activities.  He was a loyal servitor
 of the Kuomintang and a supporter of Chiang Kai-shek's statement that
 "there is only one nationality on China," the paper said.  After he
 joined the party, he continued his attacks by calling for an independent
 Uighur Republic.  While mayor of Urumchi, he threatened to move the

 several tens of thousands of Chinese in the city Out of town and bring
 in Uighurs in order to make it a Uighur city.  HeLLfilled government
 positions with minority nationalities in complete disregard of their
 qualifications.  He even used nationality cadres who were rich land-
 lords or counterrevolutionaries.  He-continually plotted to separate
 Sinkiang from the homeland, the item added.
 The item said he accused the Chinese of occupying the best parts
 of Urumchi.  Praising the Kuomintang, he attacked Marxism and the Soviet
 Union.  He said, "There is no truth in the SovietUnion," and "the Soviet
 Union is red imperialism," and called the attackers of the Kuomintang
 "red running dogs."  His record shows that he was''Sheng Shih-tsai's run-
 ning dog in 1938 and graduated from the Kuomintang party school in 1942.
 He acted as a special agent under several aliases, according to the item.
 The item continued:  Abdul-Rizak Kari, deputy director of the Sink-
 iang department of commerce, an enemy of the Chinese, gained admission to
 the party to attack it.    He promoted movements to divide the homeland
 by advocating the organization of a Uighur Republic.  Saying that he
 was holding a position without authority, he delayed the work of his of-
 fice.  Working with Aisa (another rightist) and Said, he plotted to seek
 greater power for the Uighurs by demanding that Uighur be placed above
 the Chinese language.  He plotted to prevent A-t'u Shih from being in-
 cluded in the K'o-tzu-le-su-k'o-erh-k'o-tzu Autonomous Chou and I-1i in
 the Ha-sa-k'o Autonomous Chou.  At a party conference in May 1957, he
 opposed a proposal to transfer Chinese workers and cadres to Sinkiang
 with the statement that no Chinese were needed an4 that the Uighurs in
 Sinkiang could take care of everything.  He said that he would be very
 happy to see the Chinese leave, since, he said, they treated the Uighurs
 like the way the Americans treated Negroes.  He looked on the department
 of commerce as his little "kingdom' and took every opportunity to drive
 Chinese cadres out.  Under the pretext of improving living conditions
 of the local nationalities, he demanded more minority cadres.  He refused
 to give the Chinese credit for the swift progress-of Sinkiang. He not
 only diverted public goods to his private use, but also padded his ac-
 counts.  His morals were so bad that he was arrested in Peiping while
 attending a conference there.
 The 28 June issue of the Nei-meng-ku Jih-pao carried an item on the
 plenary session of the Sinkiang party committee held in April 1958 to
 combat local nationalism.  After hearing comprehensive reports by Wang
 En-mou and Saifudin, the meeting passed a resolution to expel the follow-
 ing ranking party members:  Zainuddin, director of the Sinkiang depart-
 ment of culture and noted writer; Abrahim Turdi, director of the Sinkiang
 department of civil affairs; Abdurahim Aisa, deputy chairman, of the I-li
 Kazakh Autonomous Chou; A Said, mayor of Urumchi; and Abdul-Rizak Kari,
 deputy director of the Sinkiang department of commerce.

 In his report to the committee, Wang En-mou, first secretary of
 the party committee in the Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Region, delivered
 a severe indictment of local nationalism in Sinkiang, the Jen-min Jih-pao
 reported on 27 June 1958.  Citing attacks against local units of the
 Chinese People's Liberation Army as a glaring example of alienating the
 Chinese who are assisting in the construction of Sinkiang, Wang En-mou
 said, "The appointment of minority cadres is a nationality policy of the
 party.  However, it is not the only principle.  The prime principle of
 the party's nationality policy is the communization of cadres.  Some
 local cadres are alienating Chinese cadres by emphasizing the national-
 ization instead of the communization of cadres.  This is erroneous."
 A 4 May 1958 dispatch of the Hsin-hua News Agency from Urumchi said
 that, while addressing a recent Sinkiang party conference, T'seng T'iao
 pointed out that a member of the Communist Party must not promote local
 nationalism.  He summed up the weaknesses of local nationalism as follows.
 "Poorly organized party members are strong in local nationalism.
 They fail to observe party directives and consider local nationalism above
 party and class.  They may even oppose the party.
 "Some members are subjective and are willing to sacrifice the good
 of the party for selfish interests.
 "Some have no confidence in the party, but trust only in themselves
 or blindly in certain personalities.
 "In matters of party policy, some members are taking an independent
 attitude and violating party discipline by failing to carry out directives.
 "Some place individual leadership above collective leadership in
 party affairs.  They freely disobey party directives and pit personal
 responsibility against collective leadership.
 "Some party officials use only cadres of their own nationality.  In
 their efforts to promote local nationalism, they appoint cadres without
 considering their ideological qualifications.
 "Some cadres are proud and sensitive to criticism.  They seek re-
 venge and suppress democracy. .

 As some 80 per cent of the coal deposits
 of the whole Soviet Union are in Eastern
 Siberia, and most of these coals are coke-
 able, the fuel necessary for these huge
 new works is also near the ore deposits.
 On the basis of all these factors it is
 planned to increase the production of pig
 iron to 15-20 million tons in this area,
 within the next fifteen years. The pro-
 duction of coal and electric power is
 planned in proportion.
 According to the present plans the
 Ta}set Combine will be the first important
 steel works here. The quantities of iron
 ore will be mainly supplied by the
 Angara mines but partly also from the
 Irkutsk district, and the fuel from the
 Kuznieck coal mines. The production
 of this new plant together with the steel
 works in Kuznieck (which is partly in
 operation   already),  Karaganda   (in
 construction) and Barnaul (planned) is
 estimated to exceed 20 million tons in
 1972.
 These, however, are not the only plans
 to develop the Eastern Siberian area.
 Final details of other plans have not yet
 been disclosed but it is announced that
 detailed planning is in progress regarding
 new steel works near Krasnoyarsk and
 beyond the Lake Baykal.
 The latter would be partly built in the
 Yakout  Republic  (upper  right-hand
 corner on the map), partly in the Csita
 district, based on the Aldan and Southern
 Yakout ore deposits.
 These heavy investments are supposed
 to transform this part of Siberia into an
 important industrial centre within the
 next twenty-five years.
 2. Political Status of the
 Asians in the U.S.S.R.*
 By Geoffrey Wheeler
 NO country has been louder in its
 condemnation  of  western,  and
 particularly of British, colonialism than
 the Soviet Union. And no country has
 been  more  insistent  on  its   own
 unblemished record as the selfless cham-
 pion of the rights of oppressed and
 exploited peoples.  These charges and
 claims have  gained     a  considerable
 measure   of approval   in      eastern
 countries, and at   least part  of  the
 Soviet contentiorf appears to be supported
 in somewhat unexpected quarters in the
 West. The object of the present article
 is to consider how far Russia's claim to
 freedom from the taint of colonialism can
 be substantiated.
 There is no Russian word for colonial-
 ism, nor does it figure in the 20,000-word
 Dictionary of Foreign Words used in
 Russian, which contains most of the
 other isms in international use.  It may,
 however, be assumed that the Russians
 now regard colonialism as synonymous
 with "kolonizatsiya" which they define
 as "the seizure of a country or region by
 imperialists accompanied by the sub-
 jection, brutal exploitation, and  some-
 times by the annihilation of the local
 population."
 These are in fact the charges which
 the  Soviet Union  persistently brings
 against the West and has in the past
 brought  against  Tsarist  Russia. The
 ? This   article  first appeared  in Political
 Quarterly, London, July, 1Q58.
 English definition of colonialism is in
 principle the same although expressed in
 much milder terms-"the treatment of
 settlements abroad as proprietary domains
 exploited for the benefit of the mother
 country."  In order to decide how far
 these charges are applicable to the Soviet
 Union, it is first necessary to consider
 the nature of the territory and peoples
 involved and the circumstances in which
 they came under first Russian and then
 Soviet control.
 The broad facts and chronology of
 Russia's acquisition of her Asian empire
 are not, generally speaking, in dispute.
 Soviet maps showing the dates and
 extent of successive Russian advances to
 the west of the Urals and across the
 Caucasus differ hardly at all from similar
 maps published in the West during the
 past 60 years.  Very briefly, what hap-
 pened was that the Russians, after having
 been confined for 250 years to their
 European    homeland  by  the  Mongol
 domination, threw off this domination at
 the end of the fifteenth century.
 At the end of the sixteenth century
 they began to spread across Asia. Their
 first expansion was due east along the
 line of least resistance, and the Pacific
 was  reached  by  the  end  of  the
 seventeenth century. Later, in the first
 half of the eighteenth century, Russian
 trading operations began to extend from
 Siberia towards the south. They now
 began to encounter less primitive. and
 107
 Until China emerged as a Communist
 Power, no Communist frontier had been
 felt as abutting aggressively on an Asian
 State.... Nor,  and  this  is  often  over-
 looked, have the Russians spread across
 Asia in the past as traders and adminis-
 trators.
 -The Times, February 5, 1955
 (leading article).
 Exploitation here (in Russia) took the
 most  cruel  and  reactionary  form.   In
 almost all the colonial areas of Tsarist
 Russia   there  was practised  the     direct
 exprypriation of the basic means of pro-
 duction at the disposal of the indigenous
 population, namely, land.
 -Soviet  Encyclopaedia        1938,
 Vol. XXXIII, p. 446
 more warlike peoples, who interfered
 with Russian trade and had to be sub-
 dued or absorbed.
 This process, a familiar one in the
 history of all expanding empires, went
 on until 1881, by which time the Asian
 empire of the Tsars stretched from the
 Urals-to the Pacific, and from the Arctic
 to the frontiers of China, Afghanistan,
 and Persia.
 All this vast area, comprising more
 than half the total area of Asia, was
 under  direct  Russian  administration,
 with the exception of the Central Asian
 Khanates of Khiva and Bukhara, which
 retained  a   semi-independent   status
 analogous to that of the Indian States of
 British India. The Russians had, in fact,
 pace The Times, spread over Asia as
 traders and administrators.
 In some respects the Russian empire
 resembled other empires: it had its origin
 in trading operations which eventually
 involved conquest and annexation; and it
 included peoples who were materially
 under-developed, and whose culture was
 widely different from, although in some
 cases older than, that of the newcomers.
 There were, however, certain important
 differences.
 In the first place it was not an over-
 seas empire but geographically contiguous
 to the Russian homeland. This meant
 that -the Russians, and particularly the
 millions who were permanently settled in
 .the empire, came to regard it as an
 integral   part   of   Russian   territory.
 Secondly, to the Russians the Turkic
 peoples who made up the bulk of the
 population   of   their new  lands     were
 "Tatars," the descendants of those same
 Tartars or Mongols under whose domina-
 tion they had themselves lived for 250',
 years.

 This meant that feelings of superiority
 and inferiority were never so prevalent as
 in other empires. Finally, the native
 population which came under Russian
 domination was far smaller, less hetero-
 geneous and less exposed to cosmopolitan
 influences than the dominated peoples of
 the empires of western countries.
 In all, the native population of the
 Caucasus and the whole of Asiatic Russia
 has never amounted to more than thirty
 million, or rather less than the present
 population of Nigeria; but more than
 half of it is concentrated in Transcaucasia
 and Central Asia.
 A feature of the Russian empire which
 was by no means unique but still deserves
 mention was that, so far as is known, no
 hopes or promises of self-government or
 independence were ever held out to the
 Tsar's subject peoples.
 There do not even appear to have been
 any plans for the eventual "nativisation"
 of the administration. On the other
 hand, there was very little interference
 with  religious  and  other established
 practices, and until 1916 the peoples of
 Central Asia were not subject to any kind
 of compulsory military service.
 It is still not possible to express a
 completely informed and unprejudiced
 opinion  of Tsarist  administration  in
 Asia.  Relatively impartial accounts like
 that of the American Schuyler were
 written before the Russian conquests were
 completed, and full official reports, such
 as those of the Palen Commission pub-
 lished just before the first world war
 in nineteen volumes, are now unob-
 tainable.
 Soviet  reports  must be  regarded  as
 heavily biased as well as inconsistent in a
 number of important respects. There is,
 for instance, a remarkable difference
 between the long articles on Colonies in
 the first and second editions of the Soviet
 Encyclopaedia: the first castigates Tsarist
 Russia at considerable length for cruelly
 exploiting her colonial possessions; but
 the second makes no mention even of
 Russia having or having had any colonial
 possessions.
 In fact, there is no doubt that colonial-
 ism in the sense of the definitions given
 above was practised in the Asian empire
 of the Tsars, although there is no record
 of the annihilation of local populations.
 The liquidation of the Russian empire
 and the grant of self-determination and
 independence to the various nationalities
 formed an important part of the pre-
 and early post-Revolutionary programmes
 of the Communist Party, and the sudden
 inheritance of a large Asian empire
 sparsely inhabited by relatively backward,
 peoples confronted the Soviet regime with'
 a serious embarrassment.
 At first there was some idea of creating
 a kind of loose Muslim federation which
 would eventually, it was hoped, embrace
 the  neighbouring  Muslim  peoples  of.
 Afghanistan,   Persia,   and Turkey.-
 Among the considerations which caused
 this plan to be abandoned was the wide-
 spread conviction already referred to that
 the vast area stretching from the Urals to;
 the Pacific was not so much an empire
 as an integral part of Russia, to which,
 the Russian people had a prescriptive-
 right.
 Another reason was the development.
 among the Asian peoples of nationalist-
 and separatist tendencies; they soon came
 to think of the Revolution, which they-
 welcomed in principle, not so much in
 terms of a class war as of a "colonial''
 revolution" directed against metropolitan-.
 governments  everywhere. Finally,  the
 chaos caused by the civil war in the
 Caucasus and Central Asia confronted'
 the Soviet Government with the purely
 administrative problem of how to restore
 law and order.
 The  "Nationalities"  Policy
 Once the decision had been taken to.
 keep the Russian empire in being, the
 Soviet Government had to devise a way :
 of administering  it  and securing  its?
 frontiers while continuing lip-service to
 the requirements of Communist ideology.
 A solution was found in the "nationali-
 ties" policy, which consisted in labelling
 the' principal races and in demarcating
 republican frontiers on what was osten.
 sibly the broad basis of language.
 This operation was carried out in 1924,
 and the inter-republican frontiers then
 aligned have been subjected since only to
 very  slight  modification.  Today  the
 confines of the Asian part of the Soviet
 Union are precisely the same as those of
 Imperial Russia.
 As    an administrative expedient the
 Soviet plan had something to recommend
 it on ethical as well as on practical and
 material grounds:  in a brief space of
 three years from the Revolution until the
 end of the civil war paramount power
 over the whole of Russia had passed
 from the Tsarist to the Soviet regime.
 The sudden abdication of that power
 would have resulted not only in the loss
 to Russia of such vital resources as the
 Baku oil and the Central Asian cotton,
 but in a state of complete anarchy which
 could hardly have profited the peoples
 concerned.
 The premature termination of colonial
 rule may, in fact, prove to be a worse
 evil than its institution. The basis of the
 Soviet claim, however, is not that their
 action in retaining the status quo was
 justified, but that they have broken away
 from the old colonial system and set up a
 new and enlightened one according to
 which the hitherto subject peoples enjoy
 complete freedom and sovereignty.
 So steady has Soviet insistence on this
 claim been that they have been able to
 persuade  other  Asian  peoples  of  its
 validity. In the West, reaction has
 varied from violent rejection to fulsome
 approval; a dispassionate appraisal of the
 facts is rarely attempted.
 The first matter to be considered is
 that of colonisation, or settlement, as the
 Russians prefer to call it. There are at
 present at least forty million non-Asians
 from the western part of the Soviet Union
 settled in Asia. The great majority of
 these are in Siberia where the native
 population has always been extremely
 small.  But there has also been extensive
 colonisation in the more populous parts
 of Soviet Asia.
 For instance, in Kazakhstan and Soviet
 Central Asia the total of the non-Asian
 population now amounts to between six
 and seven million-that is to say, about
 half the total native population of thirteen
 million. The non-Asian element has very
 greatly increased since -the Revolution;
 according to the Soviet census figures, the
 native population increased by about 5
 per cent between 1926 and 1939 whereas
 the non-Asian settler population increased
 by over 70 per cent.
 The extent of the Russian colonisation
 of Asia does not necessarily call for con-
 demnation, but it is essential. to remember
 it when considering Soviet claims, and
 particularly those relating to industrial
 and agricultural output, literacy, and the
 standard of living.  All these, it is
 asserted, are tar higher in the eastern
 republics of the U.S.S.R. than in most of
 the independent or colonial countries of
 Asia and Africa, and those unaware of
 the facts are encouraged to believe that
 the undoubted material progress achieved
 in Soviet Asia is the work of the Asian
 peoples themselves with some assistance
 from Russian technicians.
 The  proportion  of  non-Asians  to
 Asians naturally varies: it is over 50 per
 cent in Kazakhstan and less than 15 per
 cent in Uzbekistan; but in the Tashkent
 108
 Approved For Release 2001/08/28 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000400370001-3
 oblast (province) of the latter republic,
 probably the most highly industrialised
 area in the whole of Soviet Asia, the
 non-Asian settler population amounts to
 over 30 per cent.
 Once these little known facts about
 population are grasped the essentially
 colonial character of the eastern republics
 becomes  a foregone conclusion. The
 system  of  administration  is  on  the
 standard Soviet model, bearing no trace
 of local tradition. The real rulers of each
 republic are the Communist Party, which
 is geared to Moscow by the fact of either
 the First or Second Secretary of each
 republican Party  being a non-native,
 usually a Russian. The same goes for
 the vital office of Chairman of the Com-
 mittee of State Security and many other
 key posts.
 The peoples of the republics have
 played no part in shaping their own
 economies: they had no say in, and
 indeed opposed, Moscow's decision to
 give  over-riding  importance  to  the
 cultivation of Central Asian cotton to the
 detriment of food crops; nor had they
 any control over the development of such
 industries of Union-wide importance as
 oil and coal or over vast irrigation
 projects, some of which, like the Main
 Turkmen Canal, have been  dropped
 without explanation  after  billions of
 roubles had been invested in them.
 In spite of the fact that all the republics
 adjoin foreign countries, they have no
 direct diplomatic, commercial, or cultural
 relations with any of them. They have
 no national armies, all national military
 formations having been abolished after
 the last serious outbreak of nationalism in
 the 1930s. Finally, and perhaps most
 important,  there  is  the  systematic
 campaign against established tradition in
 religion, language, and the arts.
 The regimentation exercised in the
 matter of language has been particularly
 marked: national languages have had
 the Russian script, a large Russian loan
 vocabulary and various Russian gram-
 matical features grafted on to them; and
 higher  education   and   professional
 advancement is impossible without a
 thorough knowledge of Russian.
 It is significant that whereas in the
 early  years of the  Revolution  great
 emphasis was laid on the need for settlers
 and    others  working in  the eastern
 republics to learn the national languages,
 it has recently been clearly stated by the
 Secretary of the Central Committee of
 under no obligation to learn ]Sazakh and
 that complaints by the Kazakh intelli-
 gentsia of their failure to do so have no
 justification.*
 The Soviet definition of colonisation
 mentions annihilation of populations but
 not mass deportation, which may, how-
 ever, amount to much the same thing.
 Towards the end of the last war the
 entire populations of the Crimean Tatar,
 Kalmyk, and Chechen "Autonomous"
 Soviet  Socialist  Republics,  amounting
 with some smaller communities to nearly
 a million people, were uprooted from
 their homes and deported to other parts
 of the U.S.S.R. For over ten years there
 was no mention of their fate-they were
 simply liquidated as peoples.
 The first edition of the Great Soviet
 Encyclopaedia had  contained  glowing
 descriptions of their achievements, but in
 the second post-war edition they were
 not even mentioned as existing or as
 having ever existed. In 1956, this act,
 reports of which had previously been
 dismissed as imperialist fabrications, was
 for the first time admitted as one of the
 many mistakes of Stalin.  It was des-
 cribed as a crime against humanity and
 rehabilitation was promised.
 "Not  from  Overseas"
 In spite, or perhaps because, of this
 exposure, the Soviet Government has
 continued with  unabated violence its
 charges against the West of "colonialist"
 crimes which pale into insignificance by
 comparison with the Soviet deportations.
 The Russians have good reason to be
 satisfied with their success in convincing
 at least part of the outside world that
 they are not and never have been guilty
 of colonialism. One reason for this is
 that in Middle Eastern eyes, for instance,
 imperialists and colonialists come from
 overseas, whereas the Russians do not.
 The Muslim peoples of Soviet Asia, on
 the other hand, are unfamiliar with the
 phenomenon of overseas imperialism; the
 only imperialists of whom they have any
 first-hand experience are the Russians.
 The attitude of the Asian peoples of
 the U.S.S.R towards the Soviet regime is
 a matter of which it is impossible to
 speak  with  precision.  The  impression
 which the Soviet authorities wish to
 make on the outside world is that these
 peoples are perfectly satisfied with their
 present lot, that they regard themselves
 as fully independent but at the same time
 the Communist Party of Kazakhstan that
 Russians working in the republics are
 109
 look up and defer to the Russian people
 as to an "elder brother."
 Soviet writers are, indeed, at particular
 pains to emphasise the great love which
 the people of Asia have felt for the
 Russians ever  since  they  were first
 brought into contact with them by the
 Russian conquests of the eighteenth and
 nineteenth centuries.  It is true that there
 are few outward signs of discontent in
 the eastern republics and it is probable
 that many of the material achievements
 of the Soviet regime are respected and
 even appreciated.
 Since they have no first hand experi-
 ence of independence and are segregated
 from the outside world, it is more than
 likely that the people of the eastern
 republics believe they are better off both
 materially and politically than the people
 in   neighbouring  Muslim  countries.
 Passive acquiescence and expressions of
 satisfaction and loyalty, even if sincerely
 felt, do not necessarily indicate a state of
 freedom'a.nd independence.
 In fact, however, there are certain
 circumstances which suggest that the
 absence of open opposition to the present
 regime springs more from resignation
 and fear than from real contentment.
 In the early days of the Revolution, one
 of the most important planks in the
 platform of Asian nationalist leaders was
 the removal of Russian settlers whose
 number has in fact been more than
 doubled.
 Again, all the early nationalist leaders
 such  as  Sultan  Galiyev,  Baytursunov,
 Zeki Velidi Toghan, Fayzulla Khodz-
 hayev, and Akmal Ikramov were either
 executed or are living in exile. There
 are no Gandhis, Nehrus, or Nkrumahs
 who, after long struggles against their
 colonialist masters, lived, not only to tell
 the tale, but to lead their peoples after
 independence had been won.
 Finally, during the second world war,
 over 200,000 Soviet Muslims who had
 deserted or had been taken prisoner by
 the Germans were organised to fight the
 Russians, thousands of them losing their
 lives at Stalingrad. The fate of the
 remainder after they were handed back
 under the Yalta Agreement has never
 become known.
 Even at the present time, when all the
 nationalist leaders have disappeared, there
 are constant complaints by the Soviet
 authorities of stubborn adherence to
 traditional customs, of slowness in adopt-
 ing the reforms of national languages,
 and of failure to learn Russian.

 must reach a conclusion something on the following lines.
 Territorially the Asian empire of the Tsars is still in being
 and it retains such established features of colonialism as
 extensive and increasing colonisation, economic exploitation,
 the arbitrary treatment of populations, including their segre-
 gation from the outside world, regimentation of traditional
 culture and the suppression of genuine and spontaneous
 nationalism.
 Soviet Asia is now the only colonial territory in which
 all these features of colonialism are present at the same time.
 Moreover, Soviet Asia is almost the only colonial territory
 from which foreign conquerors and colonisers have not yet
 receded nor shown any signs of receding. On the other hand,
 if Russian colonialism is considered as a whole, and without
 the high-sounding nomenclature by which its existence is now
 partially obscured, its purely material record is seen to be
 ahead of that achieved in many other colonial territories.
 The presence of large numbers of Russian and Ukrainian
 settlers, who are hard-working and to a large extent free
 from colour prejudice, has contributed considerably to the
 development of industry and agriculture and thus to the
 material well-being of the native population. Indeed, it
 would be not unfair to say that the Soviet experiment in

 Central Asia and Transcaucasia is a good
 example of what a deliberate and deter-
 mined policy of colonialism can achieve.
 But it is none the less colonialism and,
 which is worse, it seems to be chronic
 colonialism, for there is no glimmer of
 those hopes of real independence which
 in other parts of Asia and in Africa have
 either come to fruition or have long been
 stirring.
 Sooner or later both the independent
 and the still dependent peoples of Asia
 and Africa will have to face the fact that
 just as their newly won independence is
 emerging or about to emerge from the
 ebbing tide of western colonialism, it will
 be threatened by the rising tide of
 Russian colonialism. That they are far
 from realising this and even imagine
 that the Soviet Union is an ardent and
 disinterested champion of their freedom
 and independence can he seen from many
 of the public utterances of eastern states-
 men.
 Even the statement of Mr. Nkrumah,
 at the Conference of Independent African
 States held in Accra in April, that Africa
 is "the last remaining stronghold of
 colonialism" shows the extent to which
 the truth about Soviet colonialism has
 escaped the Africans. Earlier, he rightly
 spoke of the impact which independent
 African countries were already having on
 international affairs.
 How many of the countries of Africa
 and the Middle East realise that the six
 Muslim republics of the Soviet Union,
 which are described as "fully sovereign
 states," have never had and show no
 prospect of ever having any impact on
 international affairs whatever?
 It had already been shown that one of
 the reasons why eastern and African
 countries ignore the facts of Russian im-
 perialism is that the Russians have always
 been regarded as different from.western
 imperialists because they do not come
 from overseas. Other reasons are to be
 found in the undeniable skill and scope of
 Soviet propaganda and in the dividends
 which the policy of playing off Russia
 against the West seem to offer to eastern
 governments.
 An important contributory cause of the
 rapid spread of Russian influence is the
 West's persistent failure to appreciate the
 potentialities of the Soviet appeal for the
 peoples of  under-developed  countries.
 Even since 1955 when it first became
 apparent that the Soviet Union intended
 to intervene actively in Middle Eastern
 and African affairs, there has been little
 or no attempt in the West to analyse and
 determine the nature of this Soviet appeal
 as it is reflected in the vast mass of Soviet
 literature on every conceivable aspect of
 eastern politics, economics, and culture.
 It is not simply a question of charge
 and counter-charge, of propaganda and
 counter-propaganda; the prime need is
 for understanding, not only of the facts
 of  Russian  colonialism,  but  of  the
 methods which Soviet policy adopts to
 attract the attention and confidence of
 Asian and African peoples.  In eastern
 Europe the Soviet pose as the champion
 of freedom and. independence has been
 exposed because the people have remain-
 ed convinced of the spiritual-if not the
 physical-superiority of western demo-
 cracy over the Soviet system.
 It is largely because of the setback she
 has encountered in eastern Europe that
 Russia is now intensifying her efforts in
 Asia and Africa where most of the
 peoples have no first-hand knowledge of
 Soviet methods.  Yet the West is still far
 from appreciating the danger of the
 Soviet appeal, let alone from matching
 it.
 Reforms in Laos
 By a Correspondent
 R ELATIVELY small,  land-locked
 Laos has recently shown to the
 World that she is no mere pawn in the
 historic chess-game now being played in
 S.E. Asia., but intends to maintain the
 independence she fought for and achieved
 in October, 1953.
 Alarmed by the unexpected successes
 of the left-wing Party, the Neo Lao Hak
 Sat, at the supplementary elections held
 in May of last year, the Nationalist and
 Independent Parties formed a united,
 anti-Communist front-the Rally of the
 Laotian People (RLP).
 With the support of the RLP and
 CDIN (another strong new group com-
 prising  a  more  youthful  element)  a
 Government  was formed which has
 already illustrated that the grave diffi-
 culties  facing  Laos  are  not   being
 ignored and that the country is trying,
 by its own efforts, to find a solution to
 its most pressing problems.
 Declaring its objective to be "to pre-
 serve our newly-won independence and
 unification" and to fight against the
 spread  of  Communist  ideology,  the
 Government has dedicated itself to.clean-
 ing up the internal situation, which was
 rapidly deteriorating as a result of the
 vicious procedures and practices accom-
 panying the distribution of U.S. aid that
 has been pouring in since the establish-
 ment of the sovereign state in 1955.
 In  October,  the new Government,
 despite concentrated left-wing opposition,
 successfully  introduced  devaluation-a
 proverbially difficult task for any govern-
 ment but one essential to the present
 state of the Laotian economy.
 The artificial dollar exchange rate of
 35 kips to the dollar-a third of the
 unofficial exchange rate and for long a
 source of speculation and corruption-
 was raised to 80 kips to the dollar. Free
 convertibility at this rate was introduced
 and. import licences, for long the basis
 of profitable illicit trading, consequently
 abolished. At the same time, the kip
 was made freely convertible into certain
 other currencies at the free market rates
 determined by demand and supply in the
 main financial centres, these rates being
 reflected in Vientiane through the opera-
 tions of the local exchange banks.
 The rate for sterling is now in line
 with the official sterling/dollar rate, and
 the franc'kip rate equivalent to recent
 official market rates for the franc. Thus.
 although the acquisition of currencies
 other  than  dollars  depends  on free
 market  arrangements,  ordinary  trade
 with   Laos  can  be  financed in  any
 currency.
 Far from being in effect part of the
 dollar area, Laos remains, at least as far-
 as the United Kingdom is concerned, in
 the transferable sterling area.
 Although some of the usual adverse
 short-term effects of extensive monetary
 reform are to be expected, these have
 already been overcome to a large extent
 and will in any case be more than
 compensated for in the long-run.  That
 nowadays ever-present bugbear, inflation,
 has largely been avoided by the Lao
 Government's  management  of    public
 finances and the note issue in such a way
 as to maintain balance between monetary
 demand and the supply of goods, and by
 the fact that prices in Laos had for long
 reflected  the unofficial  exchange rate
 before devaluation was introduced.
 The former large-scale diversion of
 imported goods, financed by dollars at a
 cheap rate, to profitable markets outside
 Laos (principally Bangkok) has been
 substantially reduced, although, with the

 money supply necessarily under strict
 control to prevent inflation, some goods
 bought with dollars can still secure better
 prices elsewhere.
 The flight of capital that was feared in
 view of the absence of restrictions on
 kip/dollar exchange transactions has also
 been successfully checked by the con-
 tinuing need for kips to meet current
 expenditure, the difficulty of finding an
 acceptable market for capital assets, and
 the growth of confidence that foreign
 exchange will continue to be available as
 required.
 More Counterpart Funds
 In the long run, with a more realistic
 dollar exchange rate, U.S. aid to Laos
 will generate more counter-part funds,
 which can therefore be directed towards
 the development of the country's economy
 rather than solely to defence expenditure.
 The importation of goods essential to
 the local economy (e.g. petrol and oil,
 building  materials,  chemicals,  aircraft
 engines and transport equipment) is now
 being given every encouragement by both
 the  Lao and U.S. Governments, the
 latter having simplified the necessary
 import   procedures,  and  lowered     the
 deposits required from importers.
 The acquisition of these essential pro-
 ductive goods plus U.S. "project aid"
 will enable Laos to look at last to the
 exploitation of her natural resources. The
 development of mineral resources, light
 industries  and  handicrafts,  irrigation
 systems, and better farming techniques
 will mean an increase in the country's
 productive capacity, whilst the introduc-

 The  problems, both economic and
 political, that face any young, undeveloped

 has placed on vested interests is essential
 to the survival of the country.

 RELIGION IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Harold C. Hinton
 SUMMARY
 Like other Marxist-Leninist parties, the Communist Party of
 China (CPC) is committed to the eventual destrudtion of religion.
 The nature of the CPC's anti-religious policy receives an added
 importance from the fact that the CPC regards its own institutions
 as a model for the rest of the underdeveloped world.
 Between 1949 and 1956 the CPC established a very considerable
 degree of control over the organized religions of,China, with the
 partial exception of Catholicism, by means of manipulation, propa-
 ganda, and terror.  Popular religion suffered somewhat less.  Since
 the middle of 1957, when Communist China's "socialist forward leap"
 began, both organized and popular religion have been subjected to
 intensified and extreme pressure, including a head.ong assault on
 popular religion and "ancestor worshiptl and the creation of a
 "national" Catholic Church partially in schism wi h Rome.
 The Chinese Communists have proclaimed their.regime to be the
 principal example and model for the nonindustriali gd countries of the
 world (the "colonial and semi-colonial countries")    It is very likely,
 therefore, that in any such country which came under Communist control
 the policies and institutions of the Chinese Communists would be
 introduced sooner or later, at least in their esseptials; this has
 happened already in North Vietnam.  Few, if any ofthese policies would
 have more effect on the people of such a country than would religious
 policy.  The present paper examines Chinese Communist religious policy
 with this possibility in mind.

 I.  Religion in Chinese Life
 Religion, in the broadest sense of the term, has tradition-
 ally occupied a very important position in Chinese life, although it
 has been strongly tinged with scepticism among the educated and with
 superstition among the uneducated.  At the base of Chinese religion
 lay popular religion, which contained many superstitious elements but
 also others, such as the ceremonies of respect misleadingly known as
 "ancestor worship," which cannot be dismissed as mere superstition.
 The principal organized religions were the Mahayana School of Buddhism
 (including lamaism in Tibet and Mongolia), Theravada (Hinayana)
 Buddhism among the Chuang (Thai) of South China, Taoism (an indigenous
 mystical cult), Islam, and Christianity.  Confucianism, although not
 strictly a religion, had points of contact with popular religion and
 even with Taoism and Buddhism.  The Chinese tended toward a tolerant,
 pragmatic, and synthetic approach to religion, and many a Chinese held
 and practised -- alternately or simultaneously -- tenets of Confucianism,
 Taoism, Buddhism, and popular religion.
 Although the influence of religion on educated Chinese has tended
 to decrease in recent times, the history of religion in modern China
 have
 has by no means been one of total decline.  On the contrary,
 been movements of intellectual and spiritual renewal among the various
 religions, including popular religion.2  It therefore cannot be assumed
 that religion in China, if left to itself, would have died a natural
 death.
 II.  The Chinese Communist Attitude Toward Religion
 The Chinese Communists, like other Marxist-Leninists, hold the view
 that all religion is objectively false and constitutes the "opium of the
 masses," or in other words the means by which the ruling class lulls
 the exploited classes into accepting their lot.  From this assumption
 it follows that the disappearance of class exploitation -- which Communists
 claim will occur under "socialism" and "communism" (as Communists define
 those terms) -- will lead sooner or later to the disappearance of
 religion.

 The early leaders of the Chinese Communist movement were frank
 in proclaiming their hostility to religion.  The constitution of
 the "Chinese Soviet Republic" (November 7, 1931), for example, in-
 cluded Buddhist monks among the "exploiting and counter-revolutionary
 elements" who were to be denied the right to vote.  A land law passed
 at the same time provided for the confiscation of all land belonging
 to religious institutions.3
 Under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung, who rose to power within
 the party at the end of 1934, the Communist Party of China (CPC)
 adopted for a time a somewhat more moderate tone and policy toward
 religion without modifying its basic attitude.  The latter can be
 discerned, for example, in Mao's scornful allusion of 1927 to Buddhism
 and popular religion:
 The gods and goddesses are indeed pitiful; worshipped
 for hundreds of years, they have not knocked down for
 you  i.e., for the peasants of Hunag7 a single local
 bully or one of the bad gentry."4
 Despite the Chinese Communist claim that all religions were
 tolerated in the areas under the CPC's control,5 Mao and the CPC have
 associated -- in their own minds before 1949 and in public since 1949 --
 Christianity with "imperialism" (i.e., Western influence in China), and
 the other religions of China with "feudalism"    ei.., features of the Chinese scene, such as rural landlordism).c  Ones of
 the principal characteristics of "Maoism" as a revolutionary strategy
 is that it identifies foreign "imperialism" and domestic "feudalism,"
 rather than Chinese capitalism  as the main enemies and targets of the
 Communist revolution in China.  Religion has therefore appeared to
 the CPC as both the prop and the instrument of its principal enemies.

 As Mao Tse-tung pointed out in 1940, any toleration of or collabora-
 tion with religion by CoFnmunists could only be temporary and a matter
 of expediency, and be practised only toward those "religious followers"
 who satisfied the Communists that they were opposed to "imperialism"
 and "feudalism," or in other words that they were prepared to accept a
 degree of Communist leadership.8  In short, "religious followers" were
 asked, and since 1949 have been expected, to collaborate with the CPC
 on its terms, with a view to promoting among other things the eventual
 elimination of religion.
 III.  Chinese Communist Relisious__Polic7
 A.  General
 It is not an easy task to summarize Chinese Communist religious
 policy from 1949 until the beginning of the current anti-religious
 campaign, which will be discussed separately.  The policy has been
 essentially one of combining manipulation through organizational
 techniques, hostile propaganda, and outright terror, andgnot one of

 We cannot abolish religion by administrative Qrders;
 nor can we force people not to believe in it.
 The CPC's organizational approach to religion has been greatly
 simplified by the fact that none of the major religious bodies, except
 for the Catholics, had a tightly knit organization and that none of them
 (except for the Catholic Church's Central Bureau in Shanghai) had an
 effective directing headquarters at the national, or all-China, level.
 This has left the way clear for the CPC to set up such national organi-
 zations, ostensibly in the name of patriotism and national unity.
 Confucianism did not have to be organized in this way, since it had been
 moribund for some time and in any case was not truly a religion.
 Popular religion was too amorphous to be capable of organization.

 The Protestant churches were organized in 1954 under a National
 Committee of Protestant Churches in China for Self-Administration.
 The China Islamic Association was set up in 1953 under the chairman-
 ship of Burhan, a Uighur, so as to embrace Moslems. of all ethnic stocks
 and of all three major schools or sects of Islam ill China (Tradition-
 alists, Reformists, and Modernists).  The China Buddhist Association
 was established in 1953 under the chairmanship of Hsi-jao-Chia-ts-u, a
 Tibetan, over the Chinese Mahayana Buddhists, the lamaists of Tibet
 and Inner Mongolia, and the Theravada Buddhists of South China.  A
 China Taoist Association made its appearance at the end of 1956. The
 supervision of these organizations, and of religion in general, was
 (and is) a function of the CPC Central Committee'sUnited Front Work
 Department, under Li Wei-han, and of the Religious Affairs Bureau of
 the State Council (cabinet), established in 1954 under the chairmanship
 of Ho Ch'eng-hsiang, also a Communist.
 Chinese Communist anti-religious propaganda is accompanied by a
 virtual prohibition against propaganda or proselytization by the
 various religious bodies, under the guise of a guarantee of freedom of
 religion.  In the Chinese Soviet constitution of 1931, which was
 modeled on the Russian constitution of 1924, a guarantee of "true"
 religious freedom was balanced by an insistence that "All Soviet citizens
 shall enjoy the right to engage in anti-religious propaganda.n10  In
 the relatively moderate Common Program of 1949 (Article 5), the latter
 provision was dropped, and a guarantee of religious; freedom was accom-
 panied by one of "freedom of holding processions and demonstrations."
 In the constitution of September 1954 (Articles 87 and 88), these
 guarantees are retained.
 In practice, however, propaganda and proselytization by religious
 bodies are severely restricted.  The CPC's strong objections to such
 activity are the main explanation of its repressive treatment of the
 Legion of Mary, an organization of Catholic laymen devoted to spiritual
 work of this sort, including the recovery of lapsedCatholics.  They
 also explain in part the nearly total control which the CPC has imposed
 on religious schools.  Given the virtual prohibition on proselytization
 (recently described as "religious propaganda in public resorts or areas
 plagued with complications of class relations") and the severe restric-
 tions on religious education, the CPC's guarantee of freedom of worship
 and its prohibition of "anti-religious propaganda in-'churches or
 temples"11 means little.  Presumably the CPC expects organized religion
 to die out gradually for lack of recruits.

 The CPC's anti-religious propaganda has on the whole been fairly
 subtle and indirect.  It has taken the general line that "religious
 followers," like other Chinese, must give up all ties with and affection
 for "imperialism" and "feudalism" and must espouse "socialism."  In
 that case, and only in that case, coexistence between Communists and
 "religious followers" will be possible and the religious freedom of
 the latter respected.  The difficulty with this seemingly reasonable
 position is that for a "religious follower" to accept it means giving
 at least passive support to a program many of whose features -- such
 as atheism, materialism, and police terrorism -- are incompatible with
 the principles of any religion, and with many ethical systems other than
 the Communist.
 The CPC has.not confined itself to organizational manipulation
 and anti-religious propaganda in its efforts to promote the eventual
 elimination of religion.  It has also employed persecution, presumably
 because the other methods seemed inadequate or too slow.  This perse-
 cution has always been masked, with varying degrees of skill, so as to
 make it appear as something else.  Thus adherents of the various religions
 of China have been persecuted from time to time on the ostensible grounds
 that they were "reactionaries" or "counterrevolutionaries," or that they
 were Nationalist or "imperialist" (i.e., American) agents.  Chinese
 "religious followers" and foreign missionaries whom the CPC considered
 dangerous have been accused of upholding "feudalism" (particularly
 the former rural landlord system), of maintaining organizational or
 financial relations with foreign "imperialist" organizations, of espousing
 "local nationalism" (in the case of the national minorities), of opposing
 the "leadership" of the CPC, and similar alleged offenses.  The perse-
 cution has taken various forms, ranging from house arrest followed by
 expulsion from the country (for some foreign missionaries) through
 exclusion from public office to forced labor and execution.
 X    In many cases, Chinese "religious followers" and foreign missionaries
 have been made to "confess" to the charges against them.  These "con-
 fessions," like other similar ones extracted by Communist police from
 their prisoners, have no necessary validity as evidence against the
 accused.  This is because the techniques used axe capable of extracting
 a "confession" to nearly anything from nearly any one, and in some cases
 of producing semipermanent obedience and psychological conformity as well.
 These techniques rely mainly on extreme fatigue, psychological pressure,
 and imprisonment under extremely unpleasant conditions.  In most cases
 these deprive the prisoner of the will to resist, and the threat of their
 repetition is usually enough to prevent the prisoner from repudiating

 his "confession" later.12
 The application of these three forms of pressure -- organiza-
 tional manipulation, propaganda, and persecution -- by the CPC began
 in some Communist-controlled areas (especially North China and Inner
 Mongolia) before 1949, has been extended to China as a whole since
 1949, and seems likely to be a continuing feature-of Chinese Communist
 religious policy in the future.  The exact nature and degree of the
 pressure have of course varied with the time and place, and as exped-
 iency seemed to indicate.  Probably the most interesting variation
 has been a marked ayyarent improvement in the treatment of Buddhism
 and Islam since 1955.  The main reason is that the CPC learned from
 the Bandung Conference how much damage its religious policy, as well
 as some of its other policies, was doing to its standing in non-
 Communist Asia, where it was and is trying to pose as a champion of
 peaceful coexistence.  Since that time the CPC has allowed visits by
 handpicked delegations of Chinese Buddhists and Moslems to other
 Asian and Middle Eastern countries and by foreign Buddhists and
 Moslems to carefully selected and often restored religious showplaces
 in China, and has cited these contacts as fresh evidence for its
 allegedly friendly policy toward religion.  Not only has there been
 no real change in Chinese Communist religious policy and religious
 controls, however, but the CPC has actually intensified its anti-
 religious pressures since about the middle of 1957 (see Section 4,
 below).
 B.  Popular R    io
 Until 1958, popular religion was much more nearly exempt from
 Communist pressures than were the organized religions.  The CPC made no
 serious or systematic atte;apt to interfere with traditional beliefs or
 customs such as "ancestor worship."  Presumably this was because
 popular religion was both too amorphous to constitute a serious obstacle
 to CPC's short run objectives and too deeply rooted in the minds of the
 people to be attacked without careful preparation.  To some extent the
 CPC prepared the way for an eventual assault on popular religion by
 drastically overhauling certain features of traditional Chinese society,
 notably the concept of male supremacy within the family.

 process yet published is Drs. Lawrence E. Hinkle, Jr., and Harold G.

 C.  Taoism
 Taoism has suffered severely under the CPC for two reasons.
 Although moribund as a religion, it was closely associated with a
 number of secret societies, which the CPC was determined to stamp
 out because they constituted centers of political and social power
 independent of and indeed opposed to the CPC.  Secondly, Taoism has
 no offshoots or connections in other Asian countries which might
 have tended to deter the CPC from repressing it.  Consequently,
 Taoist sects and secret societies have been subjected not only to
 organizational controls and hoitile propaganda but to outright
 persecution.  This persecution was especially severe during the
 terrible campaign against "counter-revolutionaries" of 1951-52 and
 during the similar but less intense campaign of 1954-55.
 D.  Buddhism
 As a religion, Buddhism has been somewhat more vigorous in
 modern China than has Taoism; furthermore, it has numerous co-religion-
 ists elsewhere in Asia.  Mainly for these reasons, Buddhism has suffered
 less severely under the CPC than has Taoism.  Nevertheless, it has by
 no means escaped pressure.  Buddhist monks have occasionally been
 executed as "counter-revolutionaries," and a much larger number have
 been forcibly returned to secular life and compelled to take up
 "productive labor."  Land and buildings belonging to Buddhist monasteries,
 except to some extent in Tibet, have been confiscated on a large scale
 in the course of "agrarian reform."  Buddhist monks and laymen, in
 addition to receiving the usual political indoctrination given to
 virtually. every one in Communist China, have been asked to accept the
 idea that Buddhism and Communism are compatible, and indeed that
 Buddhism can find its true expression in Chinese secular life only in
 an environment controlled by the CPC.13
 In Tibet, the expropriation of some monastery lands and efforts
 by the CPC to monopolize the instruction of the youth were among the
 causes of widespread thoughuncoordinated popular revolts which broke
 out in eastern Tibet in 1956 and are still (December 1958) in progress.14

 (May 23, 1951) had provided for complete religious freedom and non-
 interference with the lamaseries (text in supplement to People's China

 These revolts have produced some temporary modifications in the CPC's
 timetable for "reforms" (pointing toward the establishment of
 "socialism") in Tibet, but no fundamental changes in policy.15
 F.  Islam
 The CPC gives the total number of Moslems in Communist China as
 10 million and recognizes ten national minorities among them, the
 most numerous being the 6 million Hui (Chinesespeaking Moslems) and
 3.5 million Uighurs.  These minorities generally live under "autonomous"
 governments which serve as elaborate disguises, and transmission belts
 for a centralized control which is not only Communist but Chinese in
 character.  One indication of this is the fact that in "autonomous"
 areas of importance the First Secretary of the-local CPC apparatus is
 generally a Han (i.e., racial) Chinese rather than a member of the
 local minority.  The division of the various national minorities, in-
 cluding Moslems, among numerous "autonomous" areas helps to prevent
 united action on their part.
 The fact that Moslems are treated as a gro.p of racial minorities,
 as well as a single religious minority, has nevertheless given them a
 status which, at least until recently, has been:, somewhat better than that
 of other religious groups which have no comparable political standing.
 The CPC has discouraged the building of ney mosques, confiscated
 a great deal of land owned by mosques, and severely restricted the
 Islamic education of Moslem youth.  These policies provoked armed revolts
 by Kazakhs in Sinkiang and by Hui in Kansu in 152, which were forcibly
 suppressed.  In 1955 the CPC established an Institute of Islamic Theology
 to monopolize the training of ahuna (ak unh  , or Islamic teachers) and
 see to it that they were given political instruction, including indoc-
 trination in Marxism-Leninism.  Another blow to,Islamic culture was
 the replacement of the Arabic by the Cyrillic alphabet in Sinkiang, in
 1956.

 was formed in October 1956.

 F.   Christianity
 Christianity has occupied a special place in Chinese Communist
 religious policy, because the Christian churches in China have in
 the past been supported, if not controlled, by countries and insti-
 tutions now labelled "imperialist" by the mainland regime.  Further-
 more, the Catholic Church in China formerly had considerable land-
 holdings, so that like the Buddhist monasteries and Moslem mosques it
 could be accused of "feudal" tendencies.  These characteristics con-
 tributed to making Christianity probably the most dangerous, the most
 hostile, and yet the most vulnerable of the major religions from the
 Chinese Communist standpoint.
 The essence of Chinese Communist policy toward the Christian
 churches during the first year or two after 1949 was to offer them
 toleration (as understood by the CPC) on the same basis as other
 religions, provided Chinese Christians proved their "patriotism" by
 cutting their ties with ".feudalism" and above all with "imperialism,"
 and by accepting the "leadership" of the CPC in all but purely religious
 matters.  The CPC insisted that the Christian churches implement what
 it called the "Three Autonomies."  These were "Self-Administration" (an
 end to any degree of control by foreigners, whether within or outside
 China), "Self-Support" (the repudiation of foreign financial aid), and
 "Self Propagation" (the eventual expulsion of foreign missionaries).
 These demands sounded superficially reasonable, and in fact the various
 churches had been moving in these directions for about a generation.
 The difficulty of course was that the "Three Autonomies" were regarded
 by the CPC as merely a first step toward the total elimination of
 Christianity from China.
 The Protestant churches, from a variety of motives, went far toward
 accepting and implementing the "Three Autonomies;" foreign missionaries,
 in particular, began to be progressively withdrawn.  With the launching
 of the "Mate America" campaign after the outbreak of the Korean war,
 however, Communist pressure on the Protestant churches, most of which
 had American connections, sharply increased.  Their schools, colleges,
 and hospitals were seized and converted into state institutions and the
 foreign missionaries expelled or jailed.  The churches themselves were
 brought effectively under Communist control.16

 The Catholics refused to accept the "Three Autonomies," except to
 a very limited degree and mainly in the matter of finances, primarily
 because they implied a repudiation of the spiritual authority of Rome.
 This refusal brought down on their heads a wave df persecution.
 Catholics, including Chinese clergy and laymen as well as foreign
 missionaries, were arrested in large numbers during the campaign
 against "counterrevolutionaries" of 1951-52.  Some were executed, and
 a much larger number were sent to forced labor or placed under house
 arrest.  The CPC tried in particular not only to deprive Chinese
 Catholics of leadership by foreign missionaries, but to discredit the
 latter in the eyes of Chinese Catholic and the Chinese people as a
 whole.  Thus the CPC extracted "confessions" to "counterrevolutionary"
 activity from a number of missionaries, by means already described, and
 lodged fantastic propaganda charges, involving the alleged maltreatment
 and even killi~g of Chinese children, against orphanages conducted by
 Catholic nuns.    This persecution slackened somewhat after 1952, but
 the activitf9s of the Catholic Church in China continued to be severely
 restricted,   and the issue between it and the CP? remained unresolved.
 In 1955 Bishop Kung Pin-mei (Ignatius Kung) of Shanghai was
 arrested on charges of counterrevolutionary activity; he has been held
 in prison ever since without having been formally sentenced.  The CPC
 then manipulated the election of Francis Xavier Chang (Chang Shih-lang),
 a priest of the Shanghai diocese, as acting bishop (vicarius regiminis).
 The Holy See refused to recognize this election and threatened with
 excommunication any Chinese Catholic who collaborated with the CPC to
 the uetriment of his church.  Early in 1956 the CPC intensified its
 pressure on Chinese Catholics to form a "national" Catholic Church, or
 in other words ont with few or no ties with Rome.  The result was the
 formation of a Preparatory Committee for the China Catholic Patriotic
 Association, which committee held a conference in 'eking in July 1956.19

 IV.  The Current Anti-religious Campaign
 A.   General
 By about 1956 the severity of the CPC's dictatorship (including
 of course its oppressive religious policy) and the feverish speed of
 socialization in 1955 had generated a number of serious tensions.
 The CPC's conclusion, as set forth in Mao Tse-tung's speech of
 February 27, 1957, on "contradictions," was that while these tensions
 were serious enough to require remedial action, they were for the
 most part "contradictions within the ranks of the people" rather than
 "antagonisms."  They could therefore be alleviated by permitting
 greater freedom of expression, including even some public criticism
 of the CPC itself.  As it turned out, the CPC had underestimated the
 severity of the tensions, for the criticisms which it finally elicited
 from some non-Communists (in May 1958) were much more forceful than it
 had expected.  Among other things, the CPC's religious policy came in
 for its share of criticism.  A Moslem speaker, for example, complained
 that the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau "was not interested
 in supporting the Islamic religion nor was it giving sufficient financial
 assistance for the upkeep of mosques."20
 In June of 1957 the CPC struck back at its critics in an "anti-
 rightist struggle" which effectively silenced them.  It then launched
 a massive "socialist forward leap" designed to accelerate the "transition
 to socialism" and bring China abreast of Great Britain in total indus-
 trial output by about 1972.  This "forward leap" had several inter-
 related aspects.  On the economic side, it involved an effort to increase
 production by transferring hundreds of thousands of people from the
 cities to the countryside, the establishment of large numbers of small-
 scale local industries, and (since the spring of 1958) the formation of
 agricultural "people's communes."  On the ideological side, there was
 a reversion to Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy, symbolized by such things as
 an attack on Yugoslav "revisionism" and the termination of the official
 birth control campaign (both in May 1958).  Furthermore, the intellec-
 tuals and remaining private businessmen, who had shown themselves in
 May 1957 to be ideologically unreliable, were subjected to intensified
 "ideological remoulding," at the same time that the CPC was trying to
 render itself less dependent on them by establishing small, simple
 industrial installations which would not require many highly skilled

 personnel. Finally, the ideological aspect of the "forward leap"
 also included an intensification of the CPC's pressure on religion.
 Nevertheless, the CPC has continued to take the line that true
 religious freedom is possible only under Communist rule.  The CPC
 remains committed, of course, to the ultimate extinction of religion,
 but it now maintains that the disappearance of class distinctions
 from the Chinese scene will not be enough to bring about the dis-
 appearance of religion.  Religion, it says, has ideological
 ("cognitive") as well as social causes, and the former cannot be elim-
 inated without positive anti-religious propaganda and pressures.21
 The CPC's current anti-religious campaign has been marked by an
 intensification of organizational controls over the various religions,
 especially Protestantism (in which they had previously been slight at
 the provincial level)22 and Catholicism (in which they had been almost
 nonexistent at either the central or provincial levels).  The volume
 of anti-religious propaganda has swelled to even greater proportions
 than usual and has been directed in particular against Catholicism
 and popular religion.  Persecutions and other types of pressure, in-
 cluding denunciations of alleged "rightists" among the various religious
 groups and abolition of some popular religious festivals, have been
 freely employed.
 Two interesting recent features of the anti-religious campaign
 are a visit to the Soviet Union, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and
 Hungary by a delegation representing the Religious Affairs Bureau of
 the State Council and led by Ho Ch'eng-hsiang himself in July 1958,
 presumably to seek advice on how to conduct the_campaign;23 and a ten-
 dency to hold meetings of "religious followers" at which all the organ-
 ized religions are jointly represented.24

 B.   Popular Religion
 Of all aspects of the current anti-religious campaign, the drive
 against popular religion is probably the most complex, the most import-
 ant, and the most novel. On the whole, the CPC had not previously
 launched a frontal assault.on popular religion to the same extent as
 against the organized religions.  This comparative toleration could
 not last, however, both because of the CPC's hostile attitude toward
 all religion and because of the fact that many attitudes and practices
 associated with popular religion are incompatible with the CPC's
 "socialist forward leap," and in particular with the "people's communes."
 The campaign, which began in earnest in. the spring of 1958, alleged-
 ly at the demand of the masses and under the guise of a campaign against
 superstition, has been. directed mainly at two sets of targets, the
 popular deities and the dead.
 On the ground that they are superstitious and extravagant, many local
 cults and festivals have been abolished.  This has been true not only
 among the Han (Chinese) but among the minority peoples, whose undoubted
 backwardness as compared with the Chinese the CPC chooses to attribute
 mainly to superstition.25  Religious holidays have been converted into
 workdays, and religious images have been converted to economic purposes.
 As in dealing with the organized religions, the CPC has made extensive
 use of carefully organized meetings and "debates," at which its own view-
 point is explained and other viewpoints are refuted.26
 Still more important is the CPC's campaign against the dead, or in
 other words against traditional Chinese burial customs and "ancestor
 worship."  Elaborate funerals and mourning have been discouraged; simple,
 non-wooden coffins, and in some casee cremation, have been encouraged; old
 tombs have been obl iter ated, newer ones have been moved to economize
 space; many coffins have been converted into latrines or manure carriers;
 in some cases decomposed bodies have actually been used as fertilizer; and
 "ancestor worship" is being gradually eliminated.27

 These measures, which would be extreme in any country but are
 doubly so in China, are clearly intended to eliminate not only the
 economic but also the ideological importance of popular religion.
 As the People'ss Daily (September 4, 1958) has put it, "Spiritual
 fetters which have bound the people for the past several thousand
 years will become a thing of the past."
 C.  Taoism
 Relatively little information is available onthe fate of
 Taoism during the current anti-religious campaign, but the indications
 are that its status has been essentially no differqnt from that of
 the other religions.  Taoists like other "religious followers' have
 been compelled to hold "socialist study sessions" at which they are
 exhorted to uphold the "leadership" of the CPC and the cause of
 "socialism."28  At the end of 1957 the Shanghai Public Security
 Bureau claimed to have smashed an attempt by remnants of a "reaction-.
 ary Taoist sect" to "revive the sect and resume counter-revolutionary
 activities."29
 D.  Buddhism
 The "anti-rightist struggle" of 1957-58 claimed to have uncovered
 a number of "rightists" among China's Buddhists, the most prominent
 being Liu Ya-hsiu and Chen Ming.-shu, two well known laymen,30  and Pen
 Huan, a Ch'an (Zen) abbot.31  They were accused, in essence, of using
 Buddhism as a cloak for "counter-revolutionary" anti-Communist propa,
 ganda.  Pen Huan acquired the doubtful distinction of being the most
 prominent Buddhist yet arrested by the CPC.  As in most such cases,
 some of the charges against these men dated back several years, so
 that their denunciation at that time rather than earlier was clearly
 done for propaganda effect.  The CPC press has acknowledged the arrest
 of a few other Buddhist monks and the execution of rat least one of

 them.32  Persecution has, of course, been accompanied by intensive
 propaganda; during 1958 the CPC press reported numerous conferences
 and "socialist study meetings" among Buddhists of all schools and
 in various parts of China, for the purpose of upholding the CPC and
 "socialism."33
 In the lamaist areas, including Tibet, the current campaign has
 brought intensified pressure against "superstition" and for support
 of the CPC and the "forward leap."  Lamas are expected to work like
 anyone else, under penalty of not eating.34  In Tibet, the CPC,
 without repudiating its promise of 1956 not to introduce "democratic
 reforms" until after 1962, has made it clear that propaganda in
 favor of the CPC and "socialism" will be carried on continuously
 during the interval.35  Revolts are still in progress among the Gologs
 of Tsinghai and the Khams of Sikang, both of whom are predominantly
 Buddhist.
 E.  Islam
 It has already been pointed out that the CPC's policy toward
 Islam has a very important political aspect in the sense that Moslems
 are treated as distinct racial and political minorities, as well as a
 single religious minority.  Similarly, the CPC's difficulties with its
 Moslems and its current anti-Islamic campaign have strong political
 overtones.  The CPC has repeatedly admitted that Moslems, especially
 those of Sinkiang, are. infected with "local nationalism," or in other
 words that they resent Communism, Chinese control, Chinese immigration,
 and collectivization, and in many cases would like to secede.36  Five
 (nominal) Moslems were expelled from the CPC apparatus in Sinkiang in
 May 1958, on the charge of "local nationalism."37  The establishment
 by the CPC of a Ningsia Hui Autonomous Region in 1957-58 evoked a
 number of Hui revolts in the spring of 1958.  Their alleged leader,

 Ma Chen-wu, was branded a "rightist" and presumably dealt with
 accordingly.-  Shortly after the announcement of this affair, the
 China Association for the Promotion of Islamic Culture (not to be
 confused with the China Islamic Association) met in Yinchuan (Ningsia)
 and dissolved itself.-
 While political considerations bulk largest in the CPC's Moslem
 problem, as reported in the CPC press, there can be no doubt that
 strictly religious grievances are also very important.  Since Moslems,
 virtually alone among the religious groups of China, have a political
 and territorial base, religious discontent tends to assume a political
 appearance.
 F.  Christianity
 Like other public bodies in Communist China, the Protestant
 churches were compelled during the second half of 1957 to uncover
 "rightists" in their midst.  This process began at as meeting of the
 Standing Committee of the National Committee of Protestant Churches
 in China for Self-Administration, held in Peking on November 28-
 December 4, 1957.  A number of "rightists" who had spoken out during
 the preceding spring were criticized, and "In the course of heated
 debate, the rightists were silenced by reasoning, finding themselves
 completely isolated."40  Numerous similar meetings mere held at the
 provincial and local levels during the following spring.  Among the
 "rightists" denounced at these meetings, and in some cases imprisoned
 afterwards, were many of the leaders of Protestantism in China.41
 In the summer of 1958, the CPC prevented the attendance of some Chinese
 Anglican bishops at the Lambeth Conference in Londo.42    Protestantism
 in China seems to be well on the way to total subjugation at the hands
 of party and state.
 The same trend also applies to the Catholic Church.  One of the
 earliest manifestations of the CPC's "anti-rightiststruggle" was a
 renewal of pressure for the formation of a "national" Catholic Church.

 On June 17 - July 13, 1957, the CPC convened a "preparatory meeting"
 attended by 241 bishops, priests, and laymen, at which the Vatican
 was denounced vehemently as usual.43  Then the CPC, ignoring a stern
 warning to Chinese Catholics from the Vatican against collaboration
 with Communism, convened a National Catholic Conference in the second
 half of July from which emerged a Chinese Catholic Patriotic Associa-
 tion pledged to maintain with the Vatican nothing but "purely religious
 ties that do not violate the interests and independence of China."44
 Numerous similar conferences were held at the provincial level
 during the next several months at which provincial Catholic Patriotic
 Associations were established and various Catholic "rightists"
 denounced.  More important still, the CPC undertook in earnest the
 creation of a Chinese Catholic Church formally in schism with Rome.
 This it did, beginning in the second half of 1957, by manipulating the
 election of a total (as of December 1958) of fifteen bishops by the
 clergy of their respective dioceses and their consecration by other
 bishops, without reference to Rome.  In at least one case a bishop
 agreed to perform a consecration only after he had spent a week in
 the hands of the secret police.45  The CPC realizes that these elections
 are valid under Catholic canon law, even though the Vatican has refused
 to recognize the elections and consecrations and has excommunicated
 those bishops who have consecrated or been consecrated without its
 approval.  In other words, the CPC has successfully begun the creation
 of a Chinese Catholic hierarchy whose orders are valid but which is in
 schism with Rome.  These are lengths to which no other Communist regime
 has yet gone in dealing with its Catholic population, with the single
 exception of the forcible russifieation of Uniate Catholics by the
 Soviet government after the Second World War.
 V.  Conclusions
 From this survey of Chinese Communist policy toward popular religion
 and both indigenous and foreign organized religions, it is clear that
 the CPC has used manipulation, propaganda, and terror to achieve an al-
 most total degree of control.  The CPC exercises this control under the
 guise of ensuring "true" religious freedom, but with the actual purpose
 of eliminating religion by destroying both its social and its ideologi-
 cal bases.  Such is the religious aspect of the model which the CPC holds
 up for imitation to the peoples of the "colonial and semi-colonial"
 countries.

 PEIPING ATTNIPTS TO DISCREDIT BUDDHIST AND MUSLIM LEADERS
 By A. J. Roy
 (Observor of East Asian Diplomacy and Politics)
 SUNM RY:  Since early 1958 the Chinese Communists have been
 organizing mass "struggle meetings" where Buddhist and Muslim
 religious leaders are accused of fraud, crimes, and counter-
 revolution.  This article is principally concerned with the
 campaign against Chinese Muslim imams and Tibetan Buddhist
 lamas in Tsinghai province.  Popular opposition to Communist
 control and Peiping's collectivization policy has caused a
 number of armed revolts.  The Communists hope to discredit the
 leaders of the minority peoples, many of whom are religious
 figures.

 PEIPING ATTEMPTS TO DISCREDIT BUDDHIST AND MUSLIM LEADERS
 By A. J. Roy
 (Observer of East Asian Diplomacy and Politics)
 In an attempt to consolidate control over China's restive national
 minorities, Peiping is now attacking their religions leaders and undermining
 their beliefs.  Communist officials organize mass "struggle meetings" at
 which Muslim imams and Buddhist monks belonging to the Tibetan, Thai or
 other minority groups are accused of "oppression and exploitation."
 This campaign has two purposes.  The Comaunhsts wish to reduce the
 influence of the minority peoples' leaders, many of whom are religious fig-
 ures.                   Peiping also wants to destroy the religious beliefs of the minorities
 and persuade them to accept Communist ideology.
 This long-run objective was discussed in,an article in the January
 12, 1959 issue of the Peiping Xt n~g MingDaily, which said that "The most
 basic obstacle which prevents the people of the national minorities from
 mentally accepting Communist thought is idealism - theism."
 During the early years of the regime this problem was approached
 with caution.  The Kuang Mine Dai?y pointed out that "In some places we
 also had many misgivings.  We dared not publicize materialism and atheism
 out of fear that this would come in conflict with religious policy and a-
 rouse the apprehensions of the masses."
 In early 1958, however, the Communists decided to ignore such
 approhon,sion . Chinese Muslim imams and Mongolian lamas first came under
 attack.  Religious leaders of Thai and other Buddhist tribes were also put

 under pressure, and since August 1958 an intensive campaign against Tibetan
 Buddhist lamas has been in progress in Tsinghai province.  Tsinghai, a broad
 arid plateau north. of Tibot proper, has a largo Tibetan population.
 These attacks follow a distinct pattern.  Party officials organize
 large public meetings, often attended by thousands of persons.  Leaders of
 several different religious groups are often attacked at the same meeting.
 Lamas and imams are charged with charlatanism, robbing the people,
 torture, rape, incest, and fraud.  Buddhists and Muslims are told that gods
 and supernatural forces do not exist.  They are urged to "eliminate super-
 stition."
 Religious leaders are.put on platforms and the people are directed
 to hurl accusations at them face to face.  The procedure is similar to that
 used in the mass meetings called during "land reform," when landlords and
 village leaders were also required to face popular accusations staged by
 party workers.
 led and Expert, a Tsinghai party journal, said in its October 1,
 1958 issue that "cempa    of struggle and prosecution were carried out
 with much fanfare.  According to incomplete returns, by oarly September over
 5,770 such meetings were held with over 600,000 people attending."
 There is an immediate political reason for this campaign as well
 as a long-term ideological one.  Tibetans and Chinese Muslims in Tsinghai
 have long been restive under Communist control, but during the past several
 years they have had two specific grievances:  they oppose Peiping's attempts

 PEIPING ATTEMPTS TO DISCREDIT BUDDHIST AND MUSLIM LEADERS
 to organize them into eollootiv? farms, herdsmen's collectives, and communes;
 and they resent the massive immigration of ethnic Chinese organized by the
 Communists.
 According to Red  }d Expert, 50.28 per cent of herdsmen in Tsinghai
 had been enrolled in collectives by the end of August 1958.  These were trans-
 fonaed into communes almost immediately.
 Tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese have been transferred to
 Tsinghai and other border provinces during the past few years.  Most have
 come from Shanghai and other coastal cities where unemployment is a major
 problem.  The official Peiping Pggnle's Daily periodically asks young people
 to emigrate to frontier areas.  There they are establishing state farms and
 communes which encroach on land used by Tibetans and Chinese Muslims for
 grazing and farming.  They are considered outsiders who threaten the way of
 life and the economic well-being-of the minority peoples.
 Opposition to Peiping's policy has for the most part been passive,
 but there have been a number.of armed revolts.  In 1956 the Communists at-
 tempted to form collective fps in the Kantzu district of Szechuan province.
 There, as in Tsinghai, Tibetans constitute a large part of the population.
 The Tibetans, encouraged by their lamas, refused to accept collectivization.
 When the Communists applied force the Tibetans took to the mountains and
 began an uprising which has since spread to Tibet proper.
 The People's Daily reported on October 18  1958 that "several hun-
 dred counter-revolutionaries" led by a Chinese Muslim imam in Nighsia named
 Ma Chen-wu had taken part in two revolts on April 4 and June 1.

 PEIPING ATTEMPTS TO DISCREDIT BUDDHIST AND MUSLIN L ADERS
 Ma was charged with planning to form an "Islamic Democratic Party"
 and a "Chinese Muslim Republic."  He opposed collectivization of the herds
 and was said to have used a mosque as a base for his activities.  His slogan
 was "glory for Islam."
 The Ts.JnghaiDaly of Sining for November 14, 1958 reported the
 mass trial of another imam named Mai Ch'eng-ohtang.  He was termed a "counter-
 revolutionary working under the cloak of religion."                                  He reportedly said that
 "If a Hungarian-type uprising takes place in China, I will certainly join it.,,
 Tibetan opposition to the Communist regime in the Kannan district
 was revealed by the Peiping magazine Nationalities Unit: for January 6, 1959.
 It said that lamas there "publicly sell arms and ammunition, harbor counter-
 revolutionaries and wicked elements and try to overthrow the people's regime.
 From 1955 to February 1958, no less than 40 counter-revolutionaries and
 criminals were found and arrested in the Lapulen monastery alone.  At the
 same time, large numbers of military weapons and counter-revolutionary docu-
 ments including seals and documents of the so-called "Allied Anti-Communist
 Nationalities Army' and the 'Kuomintang Branch for the Lapulen Regions were
 seized from the monastery."
 The lamas were also accused of telling the people that "the Coin
 munist Party will abolish religion," "pastoral tax is robbery under a beauti-
 ful name," and "the policy of the Communist Party is sweet first but bitter
 later."
 Red anlEExpert explicitly linked the Tsinghai uprisings with the
 drive to collectivize herdsmen.  It said that "When the great socialist

 revolution in the pastoral areas of our province was still in its primary
 stage, the die-hards among livestock-owners and counter-revolutionaries in
 religious circles staged an armed revolt against socialism, the people, and
 the Communist Party."
 (It can be presumed that the Communists were also alarmed by the
 possibility that the revolt in Tibet, which began in 1956 and became more
 extensive in 1958 and 1959, would spread to Tsinghai.  The attacks on lamas
 in Tibet has, however, involved the Communists in a contradiction.  In Tsinghai
 they say that "reactionary lamas" should no longer retain their "feudal priv-
 ileges."                       In Tibet proper, however, the official Communist policy is to per-
 mit lamas to preserve their high position in Tibetan life until 1963.)
 Although the campaign against religious leaders of national minor-
 ities has been most intensive in Tsinghai, it has also bemm carried on in
 other areas where non-Chinese nationalities predominate.  The Peiping  uan
 Ming Daily for February 12, 1959 described the activities of a "government
 work team" in Chinghung county, Yunnan province.
 The party functionaries carried on propaganda activities among the
 Hani, Ake, and Pulang minorities.  According to the newspapers,  "law-wdefying
 headmen, landlords and other bad characters manufactured rumors design to
 undermine the work of the team."   Mass meetings were organized at which the
 Communists attempted to discredit the headmen and.ridicule the religious
 beliefs of the people.  The newspaper noted succinctly that "There is now
 less feudal superstition among the masses, and production activities are no
 longer suspended during Buddhist festivals."

 HEIPING ATTEMPTS TO DISCREDIT BUDDHIST AND MUSLIM LEADERS
 These mass meetings +ftaa conclude with a summing-up by a Commu-
 nist official.  The TTsinRha Daily for October 23, 1958 quoted from the
 summing-up delivered at one meeting by the chief of the Communist Party's
 propaganda department for the province.
 He said that "There are no such things as spirits and gods.  All
 this religious nonsense was designed to deceive the people.  The reactionary
 lamas and imams speak good but do evil."
 He concluded by saying that "Elimination of religious superstition,
 bad customs, and taboos from the thoughts of the people is a long-term, dif-
 ficult task."
 It would appear, however, that the Communists expect to substitute
 their own type of superstition.  The TAnin  Aim        declared that "As a re-
 sult of the great debate, the people are spiritually revitalized, and a high
 tide is steadily rising in which feudal and superstitious beliefs are being
 completely destroyed and materialistic, Communist ideas are being established.
 "Ka-ya, a poor herdsman, said: tWe are now thoroughly liberated.
 Feudal superstitions, through which we have been oppressed and exploited
 for several'thousands years, are now being demolished.  We shall never be-
 lieve in gods again.'  He then hung pictures of Marx, Lenin, and Chairman
 Mao in his tent."
