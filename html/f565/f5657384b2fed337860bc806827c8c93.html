				    	Magda  Palacci-I~leier;  time  and  place  of  interview  not  given]
	    	_			 	[Text]     	[Question]    	You  are  going  to  go  to  France  next  February  ax  March.
	    	-				What  do  you  expect  �rom  Frarice  today?											     	-
				     	[Answer]    	France  has  always  looked  on  me  rather  as  a  son,   	since  I  am  French-
				    	educated.    	I  have  always  got  along  with  the  French.    	It  is  true  that  I  have		  	-
				    	not  always  been  docile.    	I   	fought  against  the  protectorate,  but  Ue  Gaulle  un-
				    	derstood  me  very  well.    	I   	fought  against  the  protectorate  and  French  colonial-
				    	ism,  but  not  agai.nst  France.    	But  there  were  Frenchmen  who  confused  everything
				    	and  said,  Sih~no~lc  is  bad,   	Sihanouk  is  anti-French,  because  he  is  fighting
				    	against  the  protectorate  and  French  colonialism.    	I  never  was  abainst  France.
				    	De  Gaulle,   	on  the  other  hand,   	encouraged  me  in  my  nationalism.    	He  had  un-
				    	derstood  me.    	When  De  Gaulle  came  to  power  I  had  alr~ady  finished~fighting
				    	against   	France.    	There  was  no  more  str~iggle  between  us.    	De  Gaulle  never  de-
				    	tested  me  aftcr  the  de  jure  recognition  I  granted  the  provisional  government
				    	of  the  Algerian  Republic  at  a  time  when  A~geria  was  not  independent.    	The
				    	peasants  were  still  struggling  against  French  colonialism  in  Alge~ria.    	At
	    	_				the  Belgrade  conference  in  1960  I  recognized  de  jure  Ben  Khedda's~  provisional
				    	gove~nment.    	De  Gaulle  said,  "I  like  people  tu  be  independent  and  you  want
	    	-				Cambodia  to  be  always  independent.    	I  understand  that  very  well.    	~And  I  under-
	   	-				stand  that  you  are  going  to  encourage  the  Algerians  to  be  independent.    	I,   	too,
				    	wan~  Algeria  to  be  independent,   	since  that  is  the  desire  of  the  Algerian  peo-
				    	ple."

				   	Vietn~~mese.    	The  Vietnamese  are  hungry.    	They  lack  rics,   	food  and  money.

	  	-		 	[Answer]    	~rance  can  do  a  g~eat  deul  diplomatically.    	She  can  make  the  Soviets		   	_
			    	understand  that  they  are  comp:icnting  people's  existence  and  that  can  became				-
	  	-		 	dangerous.    	And  then,   	France  has  on,ly  to  say  that  the  West,  NATO,   	~tc.,are
			   	not  allowing  the  5oviets  to  bring  about  nencolonialism  wi~h  the  Cambodians,
	  	-		 	because  today  the  Soviets  want  to  replace  the  Americnns  in  our  country.  Just
	   	-		 	as  the  Americans  were  neocolonialists  in  197U.    	Now  it  is  the  Soviets,   	in
	   	=		 	complicity  with  the  Vietnamese,  who  are  the  neocolor:ialists.							 	~
			    	[Question]    	Fxom  which  government  do  you  expect  tl~e  mos~?:							     	~
			    	[Answer]    	The  American  government  first,   	France  next,   	and  China,   	of  course.
			    	~3ut  the  latter  can't  do  much  because  it  has  worse  relations  with  Vietnam  and				_
			    	Russia.    	China  is  large,   	she  is  strong,  bui   	for  the  same  reason  she  can't
			    	talk  with  the  Russiar..s,   	she  can't  talk  with  the  Vietnamese  either.    	She  can't		     	-
	   	-		 	attack  them  verbally.    	So  I  would  have  to  speak  to  the  others:    	the  Americans,
	   	'		 	the  ~nglish,   	the  West  Germans,   	France--all  those  who  can  help  us.
			    	[Question]    	You  are  going  to  meet  with  the  American  secretary  of  state,
	   	-			Cyrus  Vance.    	What  is  your  agenda?
	   	_		 	[Answer]    	I  am  going  to  ask  him  the  same  thing  I  asked  France.
	   	_		 	[Question]    	Are  you  hoping  for  an  American  military  intervention?					     	-
			    	[Answer]    	I  am  not  hoping  for  that  much.    	One  doesn't  always  die  for  other
	   	-			people's  beautiful  eyes.    	One  only  di,es  for  oneself.    	The  Americans  made  w4r				=
			    	in  our  country  for  themselves  and  not  for  the  beautiful  eyes  of  Lon  Nol.    	Look		   	_
			    	at  Lon  Nol  today,   	they  are  leavi~:,Q  him  on  the  shelf.    	I  repeat,  the  Vietnam-
			    	ese  are  receptive  to  economic  aid.    	They  want  money.    	Much  money  on  the  part
			    	of  the  Americans.    	The  Americans  riad  promised  them  that  once  the  war  was  over
	   	_			they  would  aid  them  enormously  in  reconstructing  their  country.    	The  Vietnam-		     	-
			    	ese  absolutely  want  to  have  that  money,  the  total  of  which  could  be					  	_
	   	_			$1,000,000,000,   	$2,000,000,000  or  even  $3,000,000,000.    	So  I  would  iike  to
			    	get  $1,000,000,000  for  Vietnam,   	in  the  hope  that  Vietnam  would  then  agree  to
			    	let  go  of  Phnom  Penh.    	I  hope  that  in  that  way  the  Vietnamese  will  let  the
			   	Cambodians  settle  their  affairs  among  themselves.

			    	[AnswerJ    	This  is  a  very  good  thing  for  us  Cambodians.    	The  Americans  have			   	-
			    	been  o~r  adversaries,  but,  they  are  now  our  friends.    	It  is  formidable  to  have		     	_

				    	[Question]    	You  are  allied  with  Commimist  China  but  yau  are  not  communist.
	   	'			 	You  affirm  that  you  do  not  understand  communism,   	so  how  do  you  dafine  your-
				   	self  politically  today?
				    	[Answer]    	I   	aan  in  favor  of  a  leftish  freedom,   	a  socialism  with  an  aspect  that
				   	is  humane  in  some  way.     	I  am  like  Mendes-France.    	Not  communi~m  ~or  me,   	c~m-
				   	munism  is  bad.
				    	I  could  not  live  in  ~hina  as  a  Chinese  citiz~,?   	(and  no  longer  in  luxury  as  an	    	~
				    	invited  guest,   	as  in  the  past).    	For  l  don't  understand  communism  and,   	not
	  	=			 	understanding  it,   	I   	couldn't  be  a  good  communist  ci.tizen.    	Moreuver,  the
				   	Chinese  would  have  no  intere~t  in  making  a  communist  out  of  ine.
	   	_				On  the  o~her  hand,   	as   	I   	am  known  to  be  independent,   	everythinp  I   	say  in  their
				    	favor  will  have  influence  on  the  intei~national   	level.    	But  if  I  became  a
				    	satellite  of  China,  whax  I  would  say  would  no  longer  count.    	So  I  am  useful
	  	_			 	to  them  as  Prince  Sihanouk  and  they  are  useful  to  me  for  Cambodi~.
	   	.			 	[Question]    	How  do  you  see  the  future  of  Southeast  Asia?
				    	[Answer]    	I   	am  not  very  optimistic.    	I  would  like  all  Southeast  Asia--not
	  	=				just  my  Cambodia--to  be  ind~;pend~nt.    	China  respects  us,   	but  Es  far  as  the
				   	Russians  are  concerned,   	that's  another  thing.    	The  Soviet  bloc   	(Romania  a-
				   	side)   	and  Vietnam  are  hegemonists;  they  would  like  to  subjugate  our  South-
				   	east  Asia.
				    	[Question]    	Do  you  expect  military  intervention  by  China?
	  	_			 	[Answer]    	China  will  do  what  she  can  to  help  us.    	I  do  not  want  to  interfere
