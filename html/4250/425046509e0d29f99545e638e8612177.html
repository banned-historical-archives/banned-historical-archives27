 THIS MATERIAL CONTAINS INFORMATION AFFECTING THE NATIONAL
 DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
 ESPIONAGE LAWS, TITLE 18, USC., SECS. 793 AND 794, THE
 TRANSMISSION OR REVELATION OF WHICH IN ANY MANNER TO AN

 1.          Russians increase pressure to prevent West.German
 integra  ono     a Eas ern Affairs    vision of   e    g+ Com-
 m?sane_r s office in Berlin notes that several conspicuous
 articles in the Soviet Zone press are devoted to accusing the
 Western powers of turning interzonal boundaries into
 "international" boundaries, and draws the conclusion that the
 Russians are considering tightening the zonal borders them-
 selves.
 The High Commissioner's office believes that the press
 emphasis on boundaries, on an East German army, and on not
 allowing the "great achievements" under Communist regime to
 be lost, as well as the Pravda phrase that "the German Demo-
 cratic Republic is enter ng t e camp of peace and democracy,"
 are designed to pose a threat to the Germans that their chance
 for a united Germany is slipping away, and also as a preview
 of a program for making a complete Satellite of the 'East Zone
 i,n the event Western military integration is unchecked.
 '(C Berlin 1318, 7 May 52)
 Comment: The press campaign, as well as the recent asser-
 tions MAT-an East German army would be created and Grotewohl's
 allegation that another situation similar to that of Korea was
 being created, fits into the recent pattern of Soviet pressure
 to prevent signing of the contractual agreements.   It may be a
 further indication of the seriousness with which the USSR
 regards the signing of the agreements.

 aluminum works at Braunau, Austria, for ultimate export to
 the Orbit.  The metal is reportedly shipped via Trieste and
 Switzerland to Antwerp, and then, on the basis of fraudulent
 end-use certificates, by unknown routes to Czechoslovakia.
 Comment:   It is uncertain that Austrian-produced aluminum
 in the quantities here reported is regularly diverted to Orbit
 countries, although such diversions have long been suspected.
 The Trieste company of Massimiliano lannitti, as well as his
 Austrian contact, the managing director of the Krasa  Company,
 Gerhard Seelig, was investigated last fall, without conclusive
 results, for alleged transshipments of aluminum through Belgium
 and Switzerland to Satellite purchasers.
 3.         Czechoslovakia presses the Netherlands and Belgium to
 grant  lig a-t r Ig  s o   Czechoslovakia in the past two weeks has
 withdrawn  lane      permission for the Friday flights of KLM out
 of Prague, thus forcing the Netherlands Minister to request
 permission for each flight in advance.   The same procedure is
 understood to have been applied to Sabena, the Belgian airlines.
 Czechoslovakia last week reiterated its demands for the right
 to fly commercial service between Prague and Amsterdam, in-
 cluding eventually fifth freedom rights for transport between
 Berlin and Amsterdam.
 The Netherlands Foreign Office feels that it must reply
 to the Czech note by the end of May and does not see what
 further delaying tactics can be used.  (C The Hague 1177, 7 May
 52)
 Comment: Czechoslovakia has been pressing the Netherlands
 and Bed m `for several months to grant it landing rights in
 order to establish its air route to Western Europe, which was
 cut off on 10 September by a three-power action that denied
 Czechoslovakia the right to overfly Western Germany.   Belgium
 and the Netherlands have indicated that they will eventually
 accede to the Czech request.   France, which is the proposed
 terminal of the Czech air route, recently said that it will
 continue to postpone a final answer to the Czechs, but that
 it does not wish to be the only Western European country to
 refuse.

 authorities in the field of social insurance in the forthcoming
 Communist-sponsored International Conference on Social Security
 and Social Insurance?  The US Embassy in Vienna believes that,
 besides being a propaganda sounding board for attacks against
 the West, the conference may also be used to establish a new,
 Soviet-oriented international organization in competition with
 the International Social Security Association sponsored by the
 International Labor Office.  (C Vienna 1579, 31 Mar 52)
 Comment: The Social Security Conference, planned at the
 Berlin WPTU General Council meeting in November, is expected
 to take place in June in Berlin or Vienna.   The WFTU has sent
 out questionnaires asking for information on the harmful ef-
 fects of the restricted commercial relations between capitalis-
 tic and non-capitalistic countries, the strain of inflation
 upon social security benefits, inadequacies of social security
 systems in capitalistic countries, and unemployment figures.
 This information is expected to be presented to the conference
 in a Handbook of Social Security which will contrast the
 systems in the West and underdeveloped "colonial" areas un-
 favorably with what has allegedly been accomplished in the
 Communist bloc countries.
 5.         Gromyko-Kora conference on Japanese POW's reported:   A
 correspondent an  oscow reported    a    rs<   ora,    a   apanese
 Diet member who attended the Moscow Economic Conference, con-
 fided to him that she had had a four-hour conference with
 Gromyko regarding the question of Japanese prisoners of war.
 Gromyko took the usual Soviet position that there were none
 in the Soviet Union, and that Mrs. Kora's visit to hospitals
 and graves would establish that fact.   Mrs. Kora?s secretary,
 a former Japanese POW from the Soviet Union, is allegedly a
 Communist sympathizer.
 The United States Embassy feels that Soviet propaganda
 will exploit Mrs, Kora?s inspection of the graves to undermine
 the United States position regarding the Soviet refusal to
 return Japanese prisoners of war.  (C FOR AMERICAN EYES ONLY
 Moscow 17?0, 7 May 52)
 Comment:   The reported Gromyko-Kora conference may have
 occurred E lieu of the interview which Mrs. Kora reportedly
 had requested with Stalin.

 Impasse reached in ROK-US economic talks:   During the 6
 May mee s.ng etwe-el~      autTior  zi es and t re US Economic
 Mission, discussion was confined to the question of a realis-
 tic won-dollar conversion rate.   The Mission stated that, in
 determining the tentative sum likely to be received by the ROK
 for UN military expenditures since 1 January 1952, a conver-
 sion rate of 12,000 won to one US dollar was used.   The three
 South Korean cabinet ministers present argued against changing
 the present rate of 6,000 to one, and were quite adamant in
 their stand.   The meeting adjourned without any immediate
 possibility of agreement.
 Finance Minister Paek on 7 May stated that he would
 resign if there were a. change in the present 6,000 to one rate.
 (C Pusan 1079, 7 May; Pusan 1083, 8 May 52)
 Comment:  In order to combat the acute inflation in South
 Korea-Tt eeUS Economic Mission has maintained that first a
 realistic conversion rate must be established.   The open
 market rate is currently 12,000 to 13,000 won per US dollar.
 ROK officials fear that any official change in the exchange
 rate, however, will cause retail prices to rise, as has
 happened in the past.
 11,        North Korean Government seeks solution to Panmunjom talks:
 The Sov~e   "representati.ve" i.n  yongyang  on-2-5-April  called
 a meeting of the top North Korean and Chinese Communist leaders
 to convene on 5 Mav
 25X1 C
 Although the North Koreans thought
 that the conference wou d, deal with new instructions from the
 USSR on the cease-fire talks, some officials believed that no
 significant action would take place at Panmunjom prior to 20
 May.
 The North Koreans planned to press the USSR at this
 meeting for a "decision" on the truce talks, or, failing this,
 to urge that an international conference be called to "settle
 the Korean War." The North Koreans also planned a proposal to
 launch another attack prior to elections in the ROK,although
 it was known that neither the Soviets nor the Chinese favored
 such a course.   It was believed that such a proposal would
 bring about a clarification of the Sino-Soviet position.

 Another proposal contemplated was for a "political con-
 ference" to be held at Kaesong in August 1952..   If this propo-
 sal were raised and agreed upon, the North Korean propaganda
 organ planned to institute a campaign callin  for a "democratic
 conference for the unification of Korea."
 Comment:   While no confirmation of this planned meeting
 or of t is-e North Korean intentions can be obtained, this
 report could very well represent North Korean governmental
 thinking.
 Itmust be pointed out, however, that the North Koreans
 probably are not in a position to urge such policies on the
 USSR, being in the least influential position in the Communist
 triumvirate.In any case they could be expected to abide by
 any decision made by the two senior partners--China and the
 USSR.
 12,     Purge of public security apparatus underway,   The text
 of andaress i~icemFier      by  o  ui-c ing -,Minister of
 Public Security, indicates that a purge of the Chinese Commu-
 nist public security apparatus has been underway for months.
 Lo told A meeting of party cadres in Peiping that "corrup-
 tion andbireaucracy" were widespread in the security apparatus,
 especially in the cities, where the apparatus had absorbed
 many former Nationalist secret police.   Lo concluded that
 "degenerated" and corrupt elements must be purged from security
 bureaus throughout China.
 The Chinese Communist press in January 1952 revealed
 that the Director and Deputy Director of the Administrative
 Office of the Ministry of Public Security, together with
 four-fifths of the office staff, were found to be corrupt.
 Comment:   The campaign against corruption, waste  and
 bureaucracy, launched in late 1951 and now drawing to  i close,
 affected all organs of the Peiping regime.   It was learned
 in February 1952 that the administrative chief of the Public
 Security Ministry had been arrested and shot.
 The text of Lo's address, however, indicates more
 serious corruption in the public security apparatus than
 other Communist sources had revealed.   As the Chinese Communist
 leadership depends directly upon its public security force

 for the maintenance and consolidation of its control, the
 current purge of this apparatus is probably correspondingly
 severe.
 13.          Soviet journal praises Liu Po-cheng and Chen Yi:   The
 Moscow  n   xs    an ua e journal,               carr es~in its
 February 1952 number an article by the3 Counsellor of the
 Soviet Embassy in Peiping which warmly praises the military
 ability and ideological orthodoxy of Generals Liu Po-cheng
 and Chen Yi.   (U New Times, Moscow, Feb 52)
 Comment:    Liu and Chen, commanders respectively of the
 2nd ancU- Fff Field Armies, are the two Chinese Communist gen-
 erals most frequently reported to have fallen from favor in
 the past two years.   This article suggests that both were in
 good standing with Moscow and. Peiping in early 1952
 14.         Western shipping in China trade increases:   In January
 1952, r~-  r miaii st z-eg- ter    merchant ships, aggregating
 .204,000 gross tons, traded with Communist China.   By compari-
 son, the figures for the preceding month were 43 merchant ships
 totaling 188,000 tons.   (C ONI Report 24-C-52, 1 Apr 52)
 15,
 Comment: Vessels carrying British and Panamanian
 registr y mane up the bulk of Western-flag merchant shipping in
 the China trade.   The Panamanian-flag ships are exclusively
 coasters operating in violation of a Panamanian decree against
 calling at Chinese Communist ports.

 shore islands iii                  aa.y
 25X1Ci eporte     a   the Communists intend to invade
 the off-shore islands of Tachen, Matsu, and Chinmen at the
 end of May.   The plan,   submitted by, Chen Yi, Commander of

 It seeks to insure the security of the southeast China coast
 and to learn the reaction of the American Seventh Fleet.   This

 mately 75,000 Nationalist troops on the islands.
 16.          Cambodian Army allegedly passing arms to rebel forces:
 According to t Fe c ie  o   t e Frenc    urete in Indochina, troops
 of the Cambodian Army on two occasions delivered "cases,"
 which he presumed to be ammunition, to the non-Communist rebel
 leader Son Ngoc Thanh.   French military sources also report
 an instance of the "disappearance," and possible delivery to
 Thanh, of ammunition consigned to a Cambodian platoon.   Mean-
 while, a "clouded" military situation has prevented American
 officials from making a scheduled visit to Siemreap, a town
 in central. Cambodia.   (C Saigon 2179, 7 May 52)
 Comment:   With no improvement evident in the Vietnamese
 situation, French authorities are having progressively serious
 problems in Cambodia.
 There are strong indications that the Cambodian Government
 is abetting Thanh's activities as a means.of pressuring the
 French. for political concessions.   The chief of the French
 information service recently characterized Thanh as "not. yet"
 a Communist but saw his path leading "inevitably" in that
 direction.   He added that while the Communists were undertaking
 little military action in Cambodia, they were busily effecting
 a political penetration.
 17.         Communist peace feelers continue in Burma:  Burmese Commu-
 nist propaganda Nas--r-e-newid its ca    upon the Burmese Government
 to enter into "frank discussions" looking towards the establish-
 ment of peace and security.   (C Rangoon 1078, 8 May 52)
 . Comment:  Communist peace feelers in Burma have been re-
 porte  wxt   increasing frequency since the Vienna peace confer-
 ence last November.   These approaches have thus far been
 brushed aside by Burmese officials.   It is not yet clear
 whether they    result from Communist weakness or are merely
 tactical maneuvers.

 Communist World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), Vienna,
 copies of correspondence relative to a proposed merger of the
 AITUC and the leftist United Trade Union Congress (UTUC) of
 India.   (C Vienna Desp  1650, 8 Apr 52)
 Comment-  The AITUC, which reportedly has about 706,000
 members,  s the only Indian labor organization directly
 affiliated with WFTUL   The UTUC is a leftist group of unions,
 with about 300,000 members, which left the AITUC in 1949 because
 of the latter's policy of violence.
 When the Communist Party of India adopted a new line
 emphasizing united front action early in 1950, the AITUC was
 quick to put it into practice on the labor front.  The AITUC
 appealed to the UTUC to join it in united action,particularly
 against the labor bills then pending in Parliament, and met
 with some success.   The two groups also cooperated in January
 1951 in a Calcuttz   dockworkers' strike.   AITUC and UTUC dele-
 gates are now in China where they participated in May Day
 activities.
 There have been recurrent rumors of a merger of AITUC
 and UTUC.  Together they might becomE   a formidable
 opponent to the non-Communist Indian National Traue Union
 Congress  (INTUC) with a membership of 1,434,258.

 Greek Acting Prime Minister says situation intolerable-

 that both the King and he though that the existence of "two
 Prime Ministers" had created an intolerable situation which
 could not continue.       He had hoped that Prime Minister Plastiras
 would go abroad for his health, but Plastiras' apparent opti-
 mism over his recovery might well prevent this "happy solution."
 Venizelos added that if Plastiras remains in Greece, the gov-
 ernment would have to resign.   (S Athens 4722, 3 May 52)
 Comment-   Since he became Acting Prime Minister in early
 March,-_T6T?wing Prime Minister Plastiras' second heart attack,
 minority leader Venizel.os has increased his efforts to gain
 control of the government,   It is unlikely that he would agree,
 however, to new elections under the majority system advocated
 by both Plastiras and opposition leader Papagos unless he were
 convinced that he has no alternative,

 20.    British oil companies pressing hard for Libyan oil
 t 1.   Amer can
 concessionso   T e     yan prime   nxs rr told
 Minister fiat British oil companies, Shell and Anglo-Iranian,
 are pressing him hard for oil concessions,   The Prime
 Minister said he intends to proceed slowly in this matter
 because he wishes to make the best possible arrangements
 for Libya and avoid a dispute over  oil such as has developed
 in Iran.   (C Tripoli 632, 6 May 52)
 Comment:   So far there is no indication of any oil
 deposlts in Libya which would make commercial operations
 profitable, according to the oil company representatives.   It
 is rumored in Tripoli, however, that the British may have
 located oil deposits in eastern. Libya.   In any event, they are
 anxious tosecure the passage of Libyan legislation which would
 enable them to engage in oil exploration.
 The Libyan Prime Minister previously expressed surprise
 at the apparent lac;1 of interest on the part of American com-
 panies; he indicates, trzat,   if concessions are to be granted,
 he preferred to deal with them.

 21.         Split occurs in new West German state's coalition govern-
 ment.        iculties are increasing for t e coalit on govern-
 mend in the newly formed West German state of Da.den-Wuerttem-
 bergo   Eight of the Free Democratic Party's delegates in the
 local legislature are considering bolting in protest against
 their party's merger with the Social Democrats rather than
 with Adenauer's Christian Democrats in forming the state's
 government.   (S Frankfurt Sitrep 16, 7 May 52)
 Comment:   The composition of this state government
 could tireatten Adenauer's majority in the Federal Senate
 and cause a. partial or total defeat of the Chancellor's
 programs,
 This is the first indication of defection within the
 state's coalition government.   A continuation of this trend
 might lead to the formation of a state government friendly
 to Adenauer and to the sending of a more favorable delega-
 tion to the Federal Senate.
 22.         Austrian oil production estimated at 20 percent above
 1951:    espnte  us roman press,"c a i--s    a  crude o   pro-
 fion in Lower Austrian oil fields under Soviet control
 will exceed 1951 production by 50 percent, Mutual Security
 Agency estimates based on daily output in March place crude
 oil production at 2.88 million tons in 1952, or about 20
 percent above last year's total.   In 1951, when production
 exceeded refining capacity, the Soviet oil administration
 exported or consumed 44 percent of Austria's refined petro-
 leum products as well as some 800,000 tons of crude oil.
 (U Vienna 3528, 7 May 52; R Vienna TOMUS A-77 and A-80,
 1S and 17 Mar 52)
 Comment:  While expanding production may lend sub-
 stanc-strian fears of an early exhaustion of re-
 sources, Austrian domestic requirements are now fully met
 by Soviet allocations.   Furthermore, the conversion of
 important plants to fuel oil has permitted savings in
 fuel imports and reduced Austria's dependence on Polish
 coal.   It is, of course, by no means clear that increased
 dependence upon Soviet generosity will be preferable to
 dependence upon Polish exports.

 oor'mm1`ai~r    planning after the European Defense
 Community treaty is signed, the British Air Ministry
 hopes to have a senior observer present when practical
 EDC planning actually begins.   The British observer at
 the Paris conference has stated that his government is
 eager to have its forces on the Continent cooperate as
 closely as possible with EDC force.
 British Defense Minister Alexander will visit Paris
 next week to discuss proposed arrangements for this
 cooperation which have been approved, at the EDC confer-
 ence.   (S Paris 6873, 7 May 52)
 Comment.-  This proposal gives specific form to
 Brits n s heretofore somewhat vague assertions of desire
 for cooperation with the EDC without accepting the
 obligations. of full membership.   Emphasis on air plan-
 ning reflects Britain's efforts to push its first line
 of defense as far east as possible in view of its air
 defense system's growing vulnerability to jet warfare.

 1.         British press release adversely affects Iranian-United
 States relations-.           a  ritss      asst' In  e ran re ease   o
 Th-e-Tr-a-n-Tan press on 5 May purported extracts from a Depart-
 ment of State press conference in Washington on military aid
 to Iran.  The transcript, as released by the British without
 prior notification to the American Embassy, quoted the Wash-
 ington spokesman as saying that the non-payment of Iran?s
 troops was a problem which does not concern the United States.
 Ambassador Henderson reports that the Iranians inter-
 pret the release as evidence that the United States is
 "indifferent if not rather smug" about their difficulties.
 He believes that the release has undermined Iranian goodwill
 towards the United States, and points out that the Iranian
 press has interpreted the release as evidence of American-
 British collusion against Iran.   (S S/S Tehran 4363, 7 May 52)
 Comment-.   The British release inaccurately attributed
 to a   a     epartment spokesman a remark made by a corres-
 pondent during a 29 April press conferences  The British,
 however, apparently consider that the military aid agreement
 has strengthened Mossadeq and have already expressed strong
 resentment over its  conclusion.
 2.         Turks displeased with handling of Tunisian issue-.
 Turkish UN delegate  arper  o      e  mer~can a rga a that
 Turkey?s decision to abstain on the Tunisian item was partly
 caused by its reluctance to antagonize France so soon after
 being accepted in NATO.  He added that he was so concerned
 over his country?s difficult position vis-a-vis NATO and the
 Arab-Asian group that he had almost persuaded Ankara to vote
 against inclusion of the item on the agenda.  Turkey's stand-
 ing with the Arabs, Sarper hinted, was being increasingly
 impaired.,   (S S/S New York 786, 6 May 52)

 .   Comment: Turkey's abstention was influenced by its desire
 to main ain solidarity with the Western powers, particularly
 the United States.  Turkey, apparently, would have preferred
 to have the question dealt with outside the Security Council
 through direct negotiations.:
 Many leading Turks share Sarper's conviction that Turkey
 would be more useful to the West if it did not openly align
 itself with Western policies in the area.
