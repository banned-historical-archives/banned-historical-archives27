 The flurry of news reports from Peking Thursday night
 that the health of Premier Chou En-lai had taken a dra-
 matic turn for the worse has proved to be misleading.
 This speculation. was fueled by press reports that several
 high-ranking Chinese officials were summoned away from
 a banquet hosted by the visiting US congressional dele-
 gation.  Actually, the Chinese leaders in question--two
 Foreign Ministry officials who do not hold high positions
 in the party--had explained in advance that they would
 have to leave the banquet early.
 Last Wednes ay,
 Chou missed Mao's meeting with the visiting Togolese Pres-
 ident, the first time the Premier has failed to attend
 a meeting between Mao and a visiting head of state.  How-
 ever, there is no evidence at present that he has had
 another acute seizure of the sort that idled him earlier
 this summer.
 Chinese media seem anxious not to alarm the populace
 about Chou's condition.   The official party newspaper
 carried the Togolese President's wish for the Premier's
 speedy recovery and a toast to his health.  Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping was careful to say he was hosting the
 Togolese visitor on Chou's behalf, a formulation used
 last spring when Chou first began to cut back on his
 activities, but abandoned over the summer.  In the past
 few days, the media have carried a number of messages
 to foreign governments signed by Chou, an obvious effort
 to convey, the impression that the Premier is still func-
 tioning.

 SOUTH KOREA - JAPAN
 September 7, 1974
 The government-sponsored raid yesterday morning on
 the Japanese embassy in Seoul by a group of South Korean
 youths and a large demonstration there early today--the
 latest features of a continuing anti.-Japanese campaign
 by South Korea--were probably triggered by recent
 statements by Japanese Foreign Minister Kimura which were
 regarded as provocative by the South Koreans.  These inci-
 dents are the most dramatic of a series of developments
 likely to intensify growing strains in relations between
 the two countries.   There is a schedule of events--in
 Japan, in North Korea, and in the US as well--which
 seems likely to keep the tense relationship in the head-
 lines for some time.
 Foreign Minister Kimura's initial response to the
 August 15 attempt to assassinate President Pak was viewed
 in Seoul as unsympathetic.  But over the past week, Kimura
 has become the focus of South Korean anger because of
 other statements which, in Seoul's view, cast doubt on
 Japan's commitment to the security of South Korea and,
 more important, on the continuing primacy of the South
 in Japan's policy toward the two Koreas.
 Seoul is pressing hard for redress from Japan in
 the form of public statements and diplomatic actions,
 including policy expressions from Prime Minister Tanaka
 himself before he leaves, late next week, to visit
 Brazil, Mexico, and Canada and to confer briefly on
 September 21 with President Ford.
 Other events will affect the situation, probably
 adversely.  A Japanese Socialist Party delegation ar-
 rived in Pyongyang on September 5 and can be expected
 to provide, from that platform, loud support for the
 North Korean cause.   There is also an anti-Pak campaign
 under way in Japan which is pointed toward a massive
 leftist rally in Tokyo on September 19.   Problems in
 Japan will be compounded by the expected arrival there
 on October 2 of a high-level North Korean delegation to
 attend a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the
 first time North Korea has participated in the work of
 that body.

 Clerides met yesterday with he Turkish Cypriot
 leader, Rauf Denktash, and the two set up arrangements
 for the relief of prisoners and detainees on both sides.
 Priority would be given to the sick and wounded, as well
 as those under 18 years of age and those over 50.
 The two leaders also agreed to exchange lists of
 missing persons and make every effort to trace them.
 In compliance with the Geneva convention, they agreed
 to forward lists of prisoners and detainees to the In-
 ternational Red Cross.
 According to the US embassy in Nicosia, senior UN
 officials are hopeful that Clerides and Denktash will
 begin to examine political questions after a couple of
 meetings on humanitarian and relief matters.
 If representatives of Greece and Turkey can be
 brought into the talks at that stage, UN officials hope
 that it may be possible within a month to formulate the
 outlines of an overall solution which could then be
 ratified at a reconvened Geneva conference.

 The agreements on humanitarian problems came on the
 heels of a comprehensive survey of conditions on the is-
 land compiled by representatives of the Red Cross.  The
 report concludes that the Turks have failed to meet even
 the minimum requirements of the Geneva convention.
 It notes that the 20-25,000 Greek Cypriots in Turk-
 ish-controlled areas have almost no freedom of movement
 and lack food and medical attention.  Most of the
 35-40,000 Turkish Cypriots in the Greek side of the is-
 land were found to be leading reasonably normal lives.

 ETHIOPIA
 September 7, 1974
 According to press reports, the government radio
 yesterday accused Emperor Haile Selassie of improperly
 diverting public funds for his own purposes and of funnel-
 ing large sums of money to members of the aristocracy.
 Such charges would be the first accusations leveled di-
 rectly against the Em~erpr by the military-controlled radio.
 The broadcasts are probably designed to diminish
 the Emperor's support in rural areas.  Some members of
 the military committee may be apprehensive over the pos-
 sibility of clashes between the Emperor's traditional
 rural supporters and those elements determined to deal
 harshly with him.   It is also  ossible that the charges
 may be designed
 i-n fnrcc?  the Emperor into exile 1n the near future.

 Algeria may be planning to improve its relations with
 Libya in the near future in an effort to capitalize on
 the recent Libyan-Egyptian rift and cause difficulties
 for Cairo.
 Relations between the two neigh hors have
 en especially poor since last January when Libyan Pres-
 ident Qadhafi angered the Algerians by the surprise an-
 nouncement of his ill-fated merger agreement with Tunisia.
 Algerian President Boumediene is unhappy with Egyp-
 tian President Sadat's approach to Middle East peace
 negotiations, especially Egypt's agreement to allow
 Jordan, rather than the Palestinians, to negotiate for
 the return othe West Bank.   Boumediene, who has long
 been a leading supporter of the Palestinians, fears such
 an approach may be part of a move to avoid establishment
 of a Palestinian homeland.
 In a speech last month Boumediene asserted that
 Arab solidarity depended upon an honest agreement to
 help the Palestinians without "backstage tricks," an
 apparent reference to the Egyptian-Jordanian agreement
 last July.   The Algerian President rejected a role for
 Jordan in the current Middle East talks and insisted
 that the Palestinian problem must be resolved by Egypt,
 Syria, the Palestinians, and Israel.
 For his part, Qadhafi would almost certainly welcome
 an Algerian overture for improved bilateral relations.

 Battlefield action has lessened throughout the coun-
 try during the past few days, but substantial fighting
 probably still lies ahead.
 The focus of present Communist attacks is still in
 the northern provinces where North Vietnamese troops
 are threatening government positions south of Hue; some
 outposts on high ground several miles south of the city
 have been lost.  Although this area has been the scene
 of repeated and somewhat inconclusive combat since last
 spring,
 the North Vietnamese may try to rollow
 up their latest successes and make a major push toward
 Hue
 One of the purposes of the Communist attacks may
 have been to force just such a shift of government
 forces.  The government units involved had been on opera-
 tions designed to recover ground lost earlier to the
 enemy in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.  With their logistic
 position substantially improved since the cease-fire,
 the Communists are now apt to attempt such whipsaw ef-
 forts against the government with greater frequency and
 impact.
 North and west of Saigon, a new round of Communist
 attacks is still expected in September.   Government
 positions near Tay Ninh cit   and north of Bien Hoa cit
 are likely targets.
 The Communist strategy in the Tay Ninh area appears
 to be to gain new footholds relatively close to the city
 and along key logistic routes from Saigon.   The Commu-
 nists would then be in a position to harass these routes
 during their next military campaign and to bring sub-
 stantial pressure on the relatively populous areas nearby.

 The weather still is a factor in determining both
 the level and the location of military action in Vietnam.
 Heavy rains are under way in the central highlands and
 will start next month along the northern coast.  On the
 coast, this period initially favors the Communists be-
 cause the cloudy conditions hamper government air opera-
 tions but will not deter ground action until the rains
 increase.   In the southern half of the country, where
 weather conditions will soon begin to favor air opera-
 tions and troop movements, the government's capabilities
 should improve gradually.

 SOUTH KOREA
 President Pak seems determined to counter Pyongyang's
 current naval superiority and achieve an eventual naval
 balance between the two countries.   Thus far, his efforts
 have met with only limited success.
 Seoul has been actively seeking an anti-ship missile
 system for some time.   South Korea's first choice, the US
 Harpoon system, which has a range in excess of 30 nautical
 miles, will not be available until 1977.  Negotiations to
 purchase missiles from both France and Norway apparently
 became snagged when Seoul concluded it would not receive
 the missiles quickly enough.   In July,  a US firm con-
 tracted to supply the shorter range Standard missile as
 an interim system to be installed aboard four South
 Korean patrol boats.  Test firing for the missile is not
 scheduled until next August.

 Latin American governments on both sides of the is-
 sue foresee the early removal of OAS sanctions against
 Cuba, probably at an inter-American foreign ministers
 meeting at Quito on November 11.
 Even governments still hostile to the Castro regime
 have come to believe that a point has been reached where
 holding to the crumbling sanctions policy only furthers
 Castro's goal of destroying the OAS.   Panama's recent
 resumption of relations with Cuba brought to seven the
 number of OAS members that now have diplomatic ties with
 Cuba.   The sort of defiance of the Rio Treaty, under
 which the sanctions were imposed, has heightened con-

 Widespread. Latin sensitivity about outside inter-
 ference in matters of national policy leaves the anti-
 Castro forces in a somewhat awkward position of ob-
 structing sister republics that obviously want to open
 the door to Cuba.
 Governmental changes in Washington, moreover, have
 added to the anxiety.  Many are nervous that the US
 will alter its Cuban policy and leave the few dedicated
 anti-Castro governments diplomatically isolated.
 The sponsors of a review of the sanctions policy
 have been careful to couch their rationale in terms of
 a changed world situation and a spirit of detente.
 They recognize a continuing difference of opinion
 within the OAS regarding the Cuban subversive threat.
 For this reason, as well as to avoid provoking Castro
 by holding his government up to judgment, they hope to
 sidestep any discussion of whether Havana is continuing
 to export revolution.
 Using the coexistence argument, the sponsors are
 confident that they can, in the absence of a strong
 diplomatic counterattack, secure the necessary two-
 thirds vote of the 23 OAS members.   They expect that a

 number of the governments that once constituted a block-
 ing one third plus one  (Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Haiti,
 Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the US) will now de-
 cide to abstain.
 The Castro regime can see no benefit to a reactiva-
 tion of its suspended OAS membership and, despite Castro's
 stated interest in reconciliation with the US, the Cubans
 want no part of the OAS.   They reject it as a tool of
 the US for suppressing Latin America and will continue
 to work toward its destruction.   They would prefer to
 secure further diplomatic recognition in defiance of
 standing OAS sanctions' so as to weaken the organization.
 The debate and disposition of the Cuban case will
 affect the new dialogue between the US and Latin Amer-
 icans--an exchange very much in the testing stage.
 Those governments advocating a new attitude toward Cuba
 would be gratified to see the US yield to their views;
 if the US maintained firm support of the sanctions, they
 would gravely doubt its flexibility on other issues.
 The countries that have supported the sanctions
 along with the US, particularly Brazil and Chile,  are
 more anxious to test US willingness to consult and
 would be slow to forgive a surprise US change of heart.
 A sense of betrayal would color their attitudes toward
 the US for a long while.
 All Latin American governments would be pleased
 to have the OAS rid of the contentious sanctions prob-
 lem so that other pending questions can be grappled
 with.
 A number of political and economic questions re-
 main unanswered:   Is the OAS--particularly an OAS with-
 out Cuba--a useful instrument for inter-American coop-
 eration?  Are informal meetings of foreign ministers a
 more serviceable vehicle for dialogue?  Do the Latin
 Americans need or want a separate council excluding the
 US?

 The foreign ministers of OAS states are set to meet
 in March 1975, and an OAS General Assembly is to follow.
 Next spring, too, a new secretary general of the OAS
 must be elected, a task which will help focus Latin
 American attention on what kind of future they would
 like for the inter-American system.

 British officials remain skeptical that there will
 be much progress when the force reduction talks resume
 in Vienna later this month.  They also continue to advo-
 cate that the West make no concessions before the Soviet
 side does.
 In a conversation with a US embassy official on
 September 4, Sir John Killick, a deputy undersecretary
 in the Foreign Office, stated that he takes a dim view
 of the prospects for progress in Vienna.   Killick, whose
 views are shared by other Foreign Office officials,
 doubts that the Soviets will be more forthcoming in the
 negotiations until there is a "successful" conclusion to
 the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
 Most Western participants at the Vienna talks agree
 that the Soviets have established a connection between
 the two sets of talks, and that Moscow will not offer
 concessions in Vienna until the security and cooperation
 talks in Geneva conclude with a summit-level meeting.
 Earlier this week, Moscow again called for a summit meet-
 ing before the end of this year.
 Killick, like other British officials, suggested
 that the West should hold fast to its present position
 when the talks resume, and advocated that the West offer
 no concessions until the Soviets show a willingness to
 end the impasse in Vienna.  He also made a strong plea
 that the US consult with the other Western participants
 if the US intends to offer new ideas to get the talks
 moving.
 Killick gave the impression that London still wants
 joint US - British - West German talks concerning the
 nuclear aspects of MBFR.   West German officials also de-
 sire another round of trilateral talks.  The British and
 West Germans wish to discuss how and when the West should
 introduce the nuclear element into the talks, the weapons
 and delivery systems to be included, and the concessions
 the West should attempt to get from the East in return
 for offering to remove its nuclear wea ons.

 WEST GERMANY
 Bonn is contending that economic and political fac-
 tors prevent it from single-handedly covering the deficits
 of other EC members for an extended period.   It feels
 strongly that international action is needed to cope with
 payments problems such as those confronting Italy.
 With backing from Bonn, an EC-guaranteed loan to
 assist hard-pressed countries now appears possible, but
 the amount of the loan will fall far short of that needed
 to finance EC member countries' deficits.  Finance
 Minister Apel thus sees no alternative to meeting each
 problem on a case-by-case basis, which means that Bonn
 is not ruling out future bilateral German credits to Italy
 or other EC countries with financial problems as a sup-
 plement to multilateral action.
 To the extent that Bonn is willing to extend credits
 to deficit countries, it will do so partly out of concern
 that problems in other European countries are beginning
 to affect German exports, the only source of recent eco-
 nomic growth.  Fear that Rome would impose further import
 restrictions affecting German goods may have been an
 additional factor in Chancellor Schmidt's favorable deci-
 sion last week to lend Italy $2 billion; the loan is
 secured by a portion of Rome's gold holdings.  Bonn is
 in a strong financial position--$35 billion in reserves
 and an expected $11-billion current account surplus this
 year--to shore up demand for its exports by assisting
 other EC countries' economies.   Finance Minister Apel
 nevertheless doubts that German credits will be adequate
 tcs meet the needs of Italy and possibly other EC members.

 Major oil exporters are, for the first time, playing
 a major role in supplying economic aid to developing states.
 During the first half of 1974, members of the Organization
 of Petroleum Exporting Countries pledged $5.4 billion of
 a total of $13.4 billion in aid committed worldwide to the
 less developed countries.
 Western nations and Japan remain the Third World's
 principal source of bilateral aid, but their new com-
 mitments of $6.1 billion accounted for less than half
 the total.
 Multilateral institutions, largely the World Bank and
 the International Development Association, have added at
 least $2 billion to the $13.4-billion figure.
 Iran provided one half of the oil exporters' total.
 Its commitment of $2.6 billion makes Iran a donor of equal
 rank with the US, although in some cases US aid is provided
 on easier terms. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia extended about
 $1 billion and $700 million, respectively.
 Forty percent of the oil producers'  aid was allocated
 to Egypt and Syria.   Another 35 percent went to India and
 Pakistan.
 The aid'to Egypt and Syria was largely grants for war
 reconstruction and development.   Aid to other states was
 largely for agriculture and industry.   Only a small part,
 possibly as little as 5 percent, was to help the less de-
 veloped countries cope with the high price of petroleum.
 The enormous commitments of the oil producers provide
 opportunities for Western industrial sales of technical
 expertise, equipment, and institutional support.  The size,
 geographic concentration,  and emphasis on project aid of
 the oil exporters will almost certainly cause Western
 donors to re-examine the scope and magnitude of their aid
 programs.

 Mozambique:   An accord giving Mozambique a transi-
 tional government and early independence is scheduled
 to be formally signed early today in Zambia, according
 to press reports.   Samora Machel, head of the Front for
 the Liberation of Mozambique, and Portuguese Foreign
 Minister Soares reportedly worked out the final details
 last night.   The agreement is expected to provide for a
 transitional government to rule until next June, when
 Mozambique will become fully independent.   Portugal is
 to appoint a high commissioner, and a prime minister
 will be named by the rebel front, which will hold two
 thirds of the cabinet posts in the new government.
