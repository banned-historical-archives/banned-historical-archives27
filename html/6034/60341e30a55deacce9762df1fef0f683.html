association (i.e., missile range tracking facilities are reported under "MISSILE RANGES: fly-away airfields at aircraft plants are reported 
under "INDUSTRY: airfield nuclear weapons storage facilities are reported under "AIR: etc.).

THIS OAK REPORT ON MISSION 1207..4 PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE A 
AND B PRIORITY COMIREX TARGETS OBSERVED ON PHOTOGRAPHY. 
TARGETS IN THIS REPORT ARE SEQUENCED ALPHABETICALLY WITHIN THE 
13 TARGET CATEGORIES ESTABLISHED BY COMIREX. A LISTING OF THE 
TARGET CATEGORIES APPEARS ON THE INSIDE FRONT COVER OF THIS 
REPORT. TARGETS ARE FURTHER SEQUENCED BY COUNTRY AND DIVIDED 
INTO TWO SECTIONS SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND OTHER RESULTS. 
THE SIGNIFICANT RESULTS SECTIONS INCLUDE NEW TARGETS' 
PERISHABLE ITEMS, AND TARGETS WHICH REFLECT CHANGE AND/OR ORDER 
OF BATTLE. ALL REMAINING TARGETS ARE INCLUDED IN THE OTHER 
RESULTS SECTION. 
A CUMULATIVE INDEX WILL BE PUBLISHED AT THE CONCLUSION OF EACH 
OAK REPORTING PHASE. AN INDEX WILL BE INCLUDED WITH EACH OAK 
SUPPLEMENT. 
FOR EXPLANATION OF PREFIXES AND CODES USED IN THIS REPORT, SEE 
THE NATIONAL STANDARD MESSAGE FORMAT FOR ELECTRICAL 
TRANSMISSION OF FIRST- AND SECOND-PHASE EXPLOITATION 
(COMIREX-D-31.2/11' 1ST REVISIONS JANUARY 1969 AND 
JUNE 1968, THE SUPPLEMENT TO COMIREX-D-31.2/11). 
THE ORDER OF BATTLE REPORTED IS CONFIRMED UNLESS OTHERWISE 
QUALIFIED AS PROBABLE (PROB) OR POSSIBLE (POSS). 
RECIPIENTS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE INITIAL SCAN OF PHOTOGRAPHY 
IS ACCOMPLISHED IN A SHORT TIME AND PRIOR TO FINAL REFINEMENT 
OF EPHEMERIS DATA. CONSEQUENTLY, FUTURE ANALYSIS MAY RESULT IN 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. MOREOVER, RECIPIENTS ARE CAUTIONED 
THAT THE IDENTIFICATION OF TARGETS IS BASED PRIMARILY ON 
PHOTOGRAPHY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A FINISHED INTELLIGENCE 
JUDGMENT. 
BEGINNING WITH REPORTING FROM MISSION 1207-4 JANUARY 1974 NPIC 
WILL USE THE NUMERICAL NATIONAL IMAGERY INTERPRETABILITY RATING 
SCALE (NIIRS) TO INDICATE THE INTERPRETABILITY OF THE 
PHOTOGRAPHY AND TO INDICATE THE IMAGERY YOU MAY CONSIDER FOR 
REMOVAL FROM THE TALENT KEYHOLE CONTROL SYSTEM, DETAILS OF 
DECOMPARTMENTATION ARE CONTAINED IN USIB-D-4602/31, TCS-013-74r 
DATED 1 FEBRUARY 1974 (SECRET/NO FOREIGN DISSEM-LIMITED
