 `V V hen President Jimmy Carter quietly, but of-
 ficially, opened the closet door on one of the nation's
 most  coveted intelligence collection systems  in  a
 Cape Canaveral speech on 1 October 1978, he pub-
 licly marked the beginning of the end of an era. His
 announcement was part of the preparation for the ex-
 pected battle with the Senate over approval of the
 SALT II agreement. It was anticipated that the battle
 might eventually include the release of photographic
 satellite reconnaissance materials to establish both
 the verifiability of the provisions of the SALT tt treaty
 and the reasonableness of some of the treaty's provi-
 sions. If this had occurred, the president may have
 had in mind a restricted use of these materials by the
 U. S. Senate. However, the House of Representatives
 probably would have insisted upon equal treatment,
 and once the process was started, the president may
 have been forced to go (or would have seen consider-
 able advantage in going) to the general public with
 his supportive evidence.
 The Iranian crisis and the Soviet invasion of Af-
 ghanistan froze the  SALT  approval process in the
 United  States.  The  currently  negotiated  SALT II
 treaty is now more than likely a dead document.
 Whatever the timetable and in whatever manifesta-
 tion arms control negotiations might resume, any
 administration of the future should anticipate a most
 difficult problem in gaining congressional approval
 of a SALT-type treaty.  The pendulum swing away
 from accommodation toward confrontation strongly
 suggests that this will be the case. Another possibil-
 ity is that any SALT approach is dead for many years
 to come, so that no administration will find it pru-
 dent to pursue this path. Instead, increasing tension
 and serious preparations for the use of force may
 cause the current or next administration to present,
 to the American public and the world, hard intelli-
 gence evidence that justifies the action being taken.
 Whatever the basis, attempted accommodation or
 anticipated confrontation, if it happens, the taxpayer
 will have the opportunity to see examples of what has
 been one of the most valuable sources of strategic,
 scientific,  and technical intelligence for  19 years:
 U. S.  satellite intelligence collection systems. The
 degree of success in controlling specific knowledge
 about these systems has. been high. The conviction of
 a former CIA employee, William P. Kampiles, of es-
 pionage in November 1978, when the court found
 him guilty of selling a top secret manual of one of
 the country's operational photo satellite systems, rep-
 resents an important exception to this success. Ac-
 cording  to  news  accounts  which  cited  unnamed
 "U. S. officials," the Soviets first learned that the
 KH-ll spy satellite was photographing their territory
 when they purchased a stolen copy of the satellite's
 manual. On 23 November 1978, The Washington Port
 reported,  "The  KH 1 l  'was  misclassified'  by  the
 Soviets as a nonphotographic satellite, .. so they
 did not bother to try to hide sensitive weapons or
 operations from it when it passed overhead." News
 reports about the spy trial and the KH-t t revealed
 that ICH was an abbreviation of the CIA code name. If
 correct, the selection of "Keyhole" to name a system
 that secretly and silently peeked down from space is
 apt. The code word was probably too suggestive to
 be openly used, so it was abbreviated. There is no
 way for anyone outside of the U. S. and Soviet intel-
 ligence communities to judge the claim that the
 Soviets did not recognize the KH- I t for what it actu-
 ally was.  The Soviets,  however,  with  their large
 land-based optical and electronic systems, will prob-
 ably be able to determine whether the manual they
 purchased for X3,000 is authentic or a U. S. plant in
 an attempt at misinformation.
 A more important point is that the court effec-
 tively ruled to keep the American public from know-
 ing what the Soviets know. Reporters covering the
 trial petitioned U. S. District Court Judge Phil M.
 McNagny to release all evidence submitted to the
 jury. A copy of the manual with certain parts cen-
 sored was admitted into evidence, but Judge Mc-
 Nagny refused to release it to the media. Apparently
 the United States may have decided that it is un-
 avoidable or even worthwhile for the Soviets to know
 about our capability in this field,  but that such
 knowledge is not to be shared with our other enemies
 and the American public. This does not reflect a de-
 sire to keep the American public in the dark. There
 is no practical way of sharing with Americans and
 not with the rest of the world.
 The problem for the government during the trial
 of Kampiles was to be able to make its case well
 enough to get a conviction without being placed in a
 position of revealing intelligence information beyond
 that alleged in the charges against the accused. Press
 interest was high, and reporters pressed for details
 and explanation of testimony.  Compromise of the
 system's technical photographic capability may not
 have been the government's most serious concern. It
 would  be  highly  upsetting  if  the  compromised
 document enabled the Soviets to enter the satellite's
 command and control links in order to insert false
 data, cause the satellite to dump data upon com-
 mand, or to cause system malfunctions.
 As for the material which did reach the press, it
 may have been slightly confusing for the general
 reader. On 23 August  1978,  the headline in The
 Washington Port was "CIA 'Big Bird' Satellite Manual
 .-          Approved For Release 2001/04/02 :CIA-RDP96-007898003000040002-3
 CPYRroved For Release 2001/04/02 :CIA-RDP96-007898003000040002-3
 Was Allegedly Sold to Soviets." The accompanying
 article described Big Bird as no more than five years
 old and reported that a dozen such satellites had been
 placed in orbit. Its photo capability was described as
 being so precise that it could pick out the makes of
 automobiles and even read their license plates. The
 article  presented  additional  details,  "Intelligence
 sources said yesterday that KH-11 was the CIA code
 name for Keyhole-11, which is the Big Bird photo-
 graphic reconnaissance satellite 'The Russians
 know this satellite has been in orbit taking pictures
 for some time,' the source said, 'Getting their hands
 on the manual doesn't stop the satellite and doesn't
 stop the pictures.' "
 Clues that the U. S. Government may have ini-
 tiated  a  misinformation  effort  appeared  in  a  23
 November  1978 Washington Past article. It alleged
 that the KH-ll had looked down on Russia for more
 than a year without the Soviets realizing that it was a
 photo  satellite.  Compare  the following  quotation
 with that which appeared in the 23 August news
 item:
 "The  Soviets have known for years that the
 United States has been sending a number of dif-
 ferent spy satellites over their territory, with those
 known as Samos and Big Bird among the ones it
 identified as picture-taking ones.  But For some
 reason, the  KH11  was not picked out from the
 clutter of U. S. satellites as a new eye in the sky."
 Are KH-11 and Big Bird one and the same? One re-
 port,  apparently  heavily dependent  upon  "official
 sources," said that they are. A second report clearly
 indicates that they are different. The point is not
 earth shaking, but it is instructive about the will-
 ingness of U. S. officials to plant seeds of doubt or
 perhaps deliberately to mislead.
 What new information entered the public domain
 about  U. S.  photo satellites as  the  result  of the
 Kampiles trial? On the matter of system identifica-
 tion, Samos had been in the news officially in the
 early  1960s until it was "disinvented" by security
 fiat around December 1961. At that time, the De-
 partment of Defense stopped identifying the name
 and  mission  of certain  satellites when  they were
 launched. Since all others were identified, the rea-
 sonable assumption was that those about which there
 was no publicity or "no comment" were launches for
 satellites with a national security mission. Big Bird
 was prominently in the news in January 1978 at the
 rime of the crash in Canada of the Soviet Cosmos 954
 satellite. In its issue of 6 February 1978, Tinte maga-
 zine carried a report of Big Bird's capability and a
 color sketch of the satellite. Much earlier, specula-
 tion on the system was published in Philip Klass's
 Secret Sentries in S~iace CNew York: Random House,
 1971;  pages  170-171),  the  most  definitive  book
 available on U. S. photo satellite systems. It cannot
 be discounted that the 1978 news accounts to some
 degree were based upon Klass's 1971 research. In the
 Klass book Big Bird is identified as the first of the
 fourth-generation photo satellites.  Klass identified
 the fifth-generation  satellite by  the code number
 1010, indicating that the U. S. Air Force was going
 to call for industry proposals for the 1010 satellite
 during early 1971. The significant new capability of
 1010, according to Klass, would have been the inte-
 gration of a "real-time"  reconnaissance capability.
 This wauld allow controllers to observe the satellite's
 view as  it overflies  the globe.  Such a capability

 would have required institutional and bureaucratic
 adjustments not only ro manage the system, but to
 exploit it fully. The existence of a bureaucracy for
 that role was indicated in a 1976 report by the Sen-
 ate Select Intelligence Committee:  ". the  Na-
 tional Reconnaissance? Office, an Air Force intelli-
 gence agency only recently disclosed to exist, .
 reportedly operates satellite intelligence programs for
 the entire intelligence community.. ."
 A summary view of the system needed to support
 and exploit photographic intelligence from satellite
 sources mandates that it is not one of those com-
 partments for which only a handful of people are
 cleared. Discounting the thousands of personnel who
 would have knowledge and responsibility about parts
 of the overall system, there remains the potential for
 thousands of others who would be actively involved
 in one phase or another of video production, negative
 handling, and printing of the photographic and other
 sensor material. In the first category are personnel of
 supporting industries-the builders of rockets, mis-
 siles, cameras, film, tape, and electronics.  Few of
 these people need see the final product except to ob-
 serve coverage of a calibrated U. S. target to deter-
 mine sensor performance. It would be in the second
 category of photo analysts, technicians, and intelli-
 gence  estimators,  where  the  largest  number  of
 cleared people would be found.  Alternatively, the
 largest group of clearances could be held by the le-
 gion of civilian and military planners and operators,
 the decision-makers, and their supporting staffs at
 the national level. The number can thus reasonably
 be? expected to be large, and the potential over the
 years for specific leaks to the media is great. Security
 has been good, though, and Congress and the media
 appear to be playing active roles in this regard. This
 does not mean that knowledge about the systems-
 particularly  specific  knowledge  gained  from  the
 systems-has not appeared in the public domain.
 U. S.  Presidents  have. been  the  most  notable
 "leakers." An argument can be made that the presi-
 dent cannot be liable for any security leaks or viola-
 tions, since the whole classification system is his.
 One of the most publicized references to photo satel-
 lite material came from President Lyndon Johnson.
 Speaking off the record to about  100 educators in
 Nashville on 15 March 1967, Johnson said that be-

 cause of satellite reconnaissance, "I know how many
 missiles the enemy has." He claimed that this system
 alone had justified spending ten times what the na-
 tion had already spent on space, X35-$~0 billion up
 to chat time (The IVew York Tinier.  17 Ivfarch 1967).
 President Dwight Eisenhower had also gone public
 on  this  intelligence  capability.  He  and  Premier
 Nikita  Khrushchev  had  a  short  discussion  about
 satellite reconnaissance in Paris  in May  1960. The
 ill-fated summit conference foundered over the issue
 of the downed U-2 aircraft over Russia. Before the
 conference  broke  up,  there  was  one  meeting.
 Eisenhower wrote afterward chat he ordered a stop to
 further U-2 flights over the Soviet Union. Two rea-
 sons were cited. The first was the belief that the
 Soviets could shoot down the high-flying U-2.  "The
 second was that considerable progress was now being
 made in photography of the earth from satellites."
 (Waging Peace:  1956-1961,  [Garden  City,  N.Y.:
 Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1965, page 552.]) The
 president told Khrushchev that he had plans to sub-

 of a U.N. aerial surveillance capability. He commit-

 surveillance, but to contribute to the establishment
 and operation of such international surveillance. Fol-
 lowing  Eisenhower's  statement,  French  President
 Charles de Gaulle observed to the select gathering
 that within recent days a Soviet satellite had passed
 over France,  and that reconnaissance photography
 might  have  been  taken  of the  whole of France.
 Eisenhower wrote that "Khrushchev broke in to say
 he was talking about airplanes, not about satellites.
 He said any nation in the world who wanted to pho-
 tograph the Soviet areas by satellite was completely
 free ro do so."
 This may suggest that the Soviets have held a
 casual attitude on the subject of intelligence satellites
 streaking  over  Mother  Russia.  The  opposite  is  the
 case. Until they. obtained a similar reliable capabil-
 ity, they bitterly opposed the successful U. S. pro-
 grams. The turning point came in September 1963.
 To a large degree, Soviet sensitivities probably ex-
 plain the U. S. refusal to acknowledge our own pro-
 grams from 1961 until the present time. However,
 technical advances concerning space sensors not ex-
 clusively related to the Department of Defense have
 seriously  eroded  the  security  curtain.  The  vast
 amount of imagery available since  1972 from the
 LandSat  system  (before  1975,  this  program  was
 called Earth Resources Technology Satellites,  ERTS)
 available for commercial exploitation has served for
 most  to  dull  the  edge  of  curiosity  about  the
 capabilities of other satellite systems. It also served as
 a  benchmark  from  which  reasonable  assumptions
 about still classified systems have been made.
 Everyone who has written on the subject of intel-
 ligence satellites has addressed the area of capability.
 For the photographic satellite the area of greatest
 interest has been the degree of ground resolution pos-
 sible.  A  news  report  cited  earlier  in  this  article
 claimed that products from Big Bird were so precise
 as to enable the identification of particular makes of
 automobiles. In addition, it was alleged that license
 places could be read. Are we being informed or mis-
 informed? It would take many pages to discuss the
 automobile claim in terms of feet and inches of reso-
 lution.  Remember that there are hundreds of dif-
 ferent car models and many of them are very close in
 size. The license plate claim would be easier to dis-
 cuss in terms of inches of resolution if we could get
 by the fact that automobile plates are conventionally
 displayed so as to provide a top edge view to satellite
 cameras.  The  Director  of  Central  Intelligence,
 Stansfield Turner, was reported  in  the C February
 1978 Newsweek to have told White House aides that
 our photos were so good as to enable the C1A to dis-
 tinguts   etween   uernseys an   ere or s on t e
 range.  Why the CIA would want to identify these
 bovine cousins is a small mystery, but what can we
 learn from the statement? Guernseys are Fawn and
 white  and  slightly  larger  than  Herefords.  The
 Hereford is red and frequently has a white blaze
 mark extending from the white face to accoss the
 withers. From a satellite view the Hereford would be
 more rectangular in form than the more triangular
 shaped Guernsey. They are rarely herded together.
 Perhaps Turner's statement  meant  that  our color
 photography was good enough to have color separa-
 tion for a target the size of a cow. To speculate be-
 yond reason, he may have identified one of our photo
 satellite calibration areas, the precisely fenced hold-
 ing areas of farms engaged in artificial insemination
 operations. Here one would find almost all breeds of
 cattle grazing expectantly side by side. More than
 likely, Turner was adding one mote story to those
 that say something but tell nothing.
 There is a good deal more unsubstantiated but
 clear information on the subject of resolution. On 8
 December  1963, The Washington Port published a
 long feature article on the Samos program. Author
 Howard Simons claimed  that one released photo-
 graph, taken by a U-2 in 1956, demonstrated 4-inch
 resolution of painted stripes in a parking lot.  He
 surmised  that  technological  improvements  up  to
 1963 might permit similar resolution from a satellite
 150 miles overhead.  James A.  Fusca,  writing in
 SpacelAeronautica in June 1964, was quite positive in
 his statements concerning Samos: "Photographs ob-
 tained have a ground resolution of 16-20 in. at al-
 titudes between 100-120 miles, sufficiently good to
 detect the dark shadow of a telegraph pole,  and
 equivalent to the photographs taken by U-2s ar ex-
 treme altitudes." It is the estimate of the previously
 mentioned Philip Klass that Samos-2,  which was
 launched on 31 January 1961, had a ground resolu-
 tion of 20 feet from  its orbit of 300 miles.  He
 further  stated  that  the  "unidentified"  satellite
 launched on 22 December 1961 (possibly Samos-5),
 with half the altitude of the earlier Samos-2, perhaps
 had resolution as good as 5-10 feet. It is Klass's in-
 formed technical opinion that the second generation
 of U. S. satellites, those which sent their imagery to
 earth by radio transmission, could discern objects as
 small as 7 feet in diameter. The United States proba-
 bly orbited  25  of this generation satellite during
 1964 and 1965. Resolution in itself is not an objec-
 tive. It is an expression of some ability to communi-
 cate intelligence via graphic form. It would be mis-
 leading to expect that each subsequent generation of
 reconnaissance satellite provided better ground reso-

 lution.  In fact,  even  though  some  improvements
 were  probably  technically  possible  with  advance-
 ments in camera designs and optics, film and film
 processing, and computer-supported incerpretations,
 other objectives may have competed with the costs of
 obtaining  such  improvements.  While  the  third-
 generation reconnaissance satellites may have had a
 higher resolution camera system, it had other signifi-
 cant new attributes. According to Klass the satellites
 of 1966-1967 were equipped with an infrared scan-
 ner that enabled them to take reconnaissance pictures
 during  night  passes.  The  number  of  satellites
 launched from this generation equipment was fewer
 than previous generations.  The suggestion is that
 they carried a larger film supply and had an im-
 proved data transmission capability to ground sta-
 tions.
 The fourth-generation reconnaissance satellite has
 had more of a public character than any of its prede-
 cessors.  This was the Big Bird, first launched in
 1971, capable of both radio transmission of imagery
 and ejectable film packs. To handle its all-weather
 and nighttime role, Big Bird reportedly is equipped
 with side-looking radar that, from an orbit of 100
 miles, would provide ground resolution of a few feet.
 At least some of the Big Bird satellites essentially
 have a "real-time" reconnaissance capability. By di-
 rect  and  communication  satellite  relay  from  Big
 Bird, ground personnel can see through the zoom-
 type telephoto lens as if they were on board the satel-
 lite. Big Bird's orbiting time has been around 220
 days. Much of its payload weight is propellant used
 to maneuver both in altitude and in orbit. This ma-
 neuverability capability enables it to respond to the
 need for coverage of rapidly developing crisis situa-
 tion. The trade-off cost is total time in orbit.
 Application of "real-time" reconnaissance has been
 reported  in  the  book Satellite Spies  (Indianapolis:
 Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1976) by Sandra Hockman with
 Sybil Wong. The following is attributed to a "highly
 classified person":
 "We used satellite television to monitor the
 Yom Kippur war in October and November 1973.
 We were there day and night. We watched every-
 thing that was happening, especially over the Sy-
 rian front, and we gave the Israelis all the informa-
 tion we could. It helped them. ... [W]e have
 given a few Israelis a general idea of what we have."
 The British and the West Germans know. The
 necessary personnel in NATO know. We are plan-
 ning to build the system into the NATO command
 function.. .. [T]he Soviets learned about it in
 1973. As soon as we started operations."
 The difficulty with this statement is the suggestion
 of continuous coverage. This could be accomplished
 by  a  synchronous  satellite  stationed  over  a geo-
 graphical point, or by a stream of satellites maneu-
 vered to make repeated passes over the same area. So
 far as is known, there is no photo reconnaissance syn-
 chronous satellite capability. The very high altitudes
 associated with synchronous orbit would appear to be
 beyond sensor capability to monitor battlefield ac-
 tion. The records do not show sudden increases in
 classified launches during this crisis. Three explana-
 tions suggest themselves: the report is in error, at
 least as far as the continuity of coverage is concerned;
 an unidentified satellite with a unique capability was
 at work; or the unidentified source defined "continu-
 ous" as repeated orbits over the same ground area,
 i.e., a maneuverable Big Bird-type satellite.
 The term "photographic satellite" should not be
 taken in a literal sense. The point to be made is an
 important one and one that is abundantly docu-
 mented in open literature. All regions of the elec-
 tromagnetic spectrum, from ultraviolet through far
 infrared, have been carefully investigated for intelli-
 gence  potential.  We  associate  photography  with
 cameras, negatives, prints, and slides. Radiometers
 are the instruments used to sense and capture data in
 the nonvisible (to the human eye) electromagnetic
 spectrum. What may be confusing is that, in fact, a
 visible presentation can be made of data received in
 what is labeled the nonvisible spectrum.  Fot ex-
 ample,  an infrared thermal  image certainly com-
 municates intelligence. The whole of Italy with scat-
 tered cloud coverage might be presented. The brain
 and eye are not confused by the presentation, and
 much can be interpreted, but not nearly as much as
 would be possible by a computer using digital tech-
 niques. We have gone through at least two genera-
 tions  of  multispectral  satellite  sensor  systems.
 Analysis and  interpretation of these materials are
 principally by computers. Perhaps one measure of the
 potential of this intelligence is the commercial appli-
 cation already established. Commercial marketing of
 LandSat  products  is  presently  being  done  by  a
 number of companies  including General  Electric,
 Bendix, Earth Satellite Corporation, and iBM, with
 others coming in the field.
 Three years before the first I.andSac satellite was
 .orbited, the 22 June 1970 issue of Aviation Week fr
 Space Technology presented a discussion of the hopeful
 future of such a venture. It was speculated that a
 functional earth resources observation satellite system
 would represent the greatest potential return on a
 dollar investment of any space project. Sixteen poten-
 tial earth survey sensors were identified in a matrix

 that  associated  each  with  objectives  in  the  five
 categories of agriculture, geography, geology, hy-
 drology, and oceanography. From  the beginning of
 this project, the Department of Defense was a sup-
 porter and participant. It would not be surprising if
 a series of military intelligence collection efforts have
 been secretly associated with all of the publicly iden-
 rified  multispectral satellites and some that were
 classified launches. In conjunction with the best of
 our space and ground photographic capabilities, sig-
 nature recognition criteria for all spaceborne sensors
 would have been well established long ago. The sur-
 vey rate of various sensors differs greatly. If, for ex-
 ample, the signature for concrete was reasonably dis-
 tinctive and detectable with a rapid race sensor (a
 sensor capable of viewing large areas of the earth's
 surface at one pass), it could provide and maintain an
 index of man-made structures.  New findings and
 enlargement of previous structures could  then be
 targeted for photo reconnaissance and other types of
 coverage that would reveal adequate details for as-
 sessment .
 The persuasive power of aerial and space photogra-
 phy must be rated high. The best public example
 concerned the use of U-2 photos to support the U. S.
 position during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Con-
 cerned about any possible irresolution on the part of
 our  NATO  allies,  President  Kennedy  dispatched
 senior diplomatic personnel with photo interpreters
 and copies of U-2 photography. The purpose was to
 give foreign heads of state a briefing on the evidence
 before the president went to the American public and
 the world with our facedown of the Soviets over the
 missiles in Cuba.
 Dean Acheson delivered to Charles de Gaulle a let-
 ter from Kennedy and offered to show the photo-
 graphs. "A great government such as yours does not
 act without evidence," responded the French Presi-
 dent.  After he told Acheson, "You may tell your
 President that France will support him," he asked to
 see the photographs.
 Roger Hillsman, who during the Cuban Missile
 Crisis was the Director of the Department of State's
 Bureau of Intelligence and Research, writes that the
 intelligence community objected to the release of U-2
 photography on the grounds that its high-quality
 resolution would reveal too much about our intelli-
 gence capability. The president decided that the pho-
 tography had to be used and authorized its release to
 the general public. A similar argument for release is
 currently in full bloom. It has been reported that a
 White House panel started working in March 1977
 to review the policy that governs what could be re-
 leased in order to achieve more civilian benefits from
 our photo intelligence satellites (The Washington Post,
 13 November 1978). The argument is in progress
 again  with  the  U. S.  intelligence  community,
 perhaps joined by counterparts in allied nations who
 may share at least in part the bounty from these col-
 lection systems. There is serious concern that if the
 decision is reached to release materials from our less
 capable older systems, it will lead to inevitably suc-
 cessful demands for the release of materials from the
 current and best systems.
 Sbots like this one, taken in 1962, gave President Kennedy the
 proof he needed of Soviet missiles on Cuban launch sites. Tbey
 were enough to convince Cbarles de Gaulle, too.
 There are and have been other proposals for releas-
 ing satellite intelligence. In "The International Con-
 trol of Disarmament" (Scientific American,  October
 1974), Alva Myrdal outlined a detailed proposal for
 the creation of a new U.N. agency that would be
 charged with the collection and dissemination of in-
 telligence regarding the compliance of nations with
 disarmament agreements. Mrs. Myrdal assumed that
 such a U.N. agency would have to depend at first
 upon  the  satellite  photography  from  "national
 sources." At the time of writing, this would have to
 have been either or both the United States and the
 Soviet Union. This idea was officially updated during
 the  1978 Special Session of the General Assembly
 Devoted to Disarmament. France presented at this
 session a proposal for the establishment of an  in-
 ternational satellite monitoring agency. The proposal
 acknowledged that consent would be required from
 any nation before it could be monitored for com-

 Hance of a disarmament agreement. A possible ex-
 eption was suggested if the Security Council  in-
 oked Article 34 of the U.N.  Charter which au-
 horizes the Council to investigate disputes or situa-
 ions. that might lead to international friction ar give
 ise to a dispute. Three technical stages were identi-
 fied. The first capability the new agency was to es-
 ablish would be a processing center where materials
 rovided by nations having operational satellite sys-
 ems would be interpreted. During the second stage;
 he agency would establish data-receiving stations
 hat would be directly linked to national observation
 atellites. In the 6na1 stage, the agency would have
 'ts own satellites.
 The attitude of the United States on this proposal
 ay be inferred from a speech given at the  1978
 .N.  Disarmament Session by delegation. member
 aul Newman. Mr. Newman gave details of the U.S.
 erial photographic surveillance provided to Egypt
 nd Israel in the Sinai. He made a general invitation:
 "The United States is prepared to consider re-
 quests for similar monitoring services in situations
 where they might be applicable.  To the extent
 possible U. S. assistance would be provided under
 the auspices of the United Nations or of regional
 organizations but, in any event, only upon the
 joint request of the affected states." (Department of
 State Bulletin Reprint, August 1978)
 If, for whatever reason, the United States and the
 .S.S.R.  are unwilling to share their observation
 atellites with the United Nations, France may offer
 to develop and launch a satellite series in support of
 its~own proposal. President Valery Giscard D'estang
 told the disarmament delegates that France would
 ave a photo satellite capability within five years.
 'estang was too modest about his country's existing
 apability in this field. The report of awell-informed
 iscussion group on problems of international secu-
 ity in outer space concluded that France uses satel-
 ites for reconnaissance, geodetic studies, and other
 ctivities necessary to the development of its land-
 nd sea-based missile nuclear deterrent force.
 One public Soviet response to opening dialogue on
 he possible U.N. use of observation satellite mate-
 ial appeared in an article by Yuri Kolosov in the
 ovember 1978 New Timer:
 ...  if these photos have a sufficiently high
 resolution they can be used to obtain information
 about the defense potential of a country and its
 resources. That is why such photographs should be
 made available to all only with the consent of the
 countries whose territory is probed. Soviet -scien-
 tists hold that photographs with a linear resolution
 of 50 metres or better can be used to obtain in-
 formation the distribution of which could be det-
 rimental to the national interests of states. This
 criterion was proposed for dividing photos taken
 from satellites into two categories: photos that can
 be distributed freely and photos that can be dis-
 tributed only with the consent of the state con-
 cerned. Such an approach is vigorously supported
 by the socialist and developing countries and is
 opposed by the imperialist countries led by the
 United 5tates."
 Apparently the Soviet view is that ground resolution
 of around 160 feet is too poor to be of much value;
 hence it can be tolerated as "legal" for distribution.
 The Soviets do leave the door open for photos with
 better  resolution,  provided  the  involved  country
 gives consent for release.
 Recently, the United States has gone public on the
 general legal standing of satellite photographic re-
 connaissance.  Major General Walter D.  Reed, Air
 Force Judge Advocate General, said in a speech on
 31  October  1978 that the U. S.  position  is that
 under current outer space treaty provisions, the term
 "peaceful" means "non-aggressive" and that space re-
 connaissance from a satellite is anon-aggressive, pas-
 sive function of a satellite. Two different points are
 at issue here. The Soviets are not saying that satellite
 reconnaissance with excellent ground resolution is il-
 legal. They are saying that the use of reconnaissance
 materials is not without some legal sanction and con-
 trol. Their suggestion that 50 meters is the break
 point is obviously arbitrary, but one that may stand
 if it allows the use of the bulk of the U. S. LandSat
 material already collected. On the other hand, the
 United States may insist that this figure be reduced
 to whatever the average linear resolution is expected
 to be for our next generation LandSat system. The
 new LandSat system should generate many millions
 of dollars for companies commercially exploiting its
 materials,  and an unpredictable amount for com-
 panies and countries that then successfully exploit
 the resources identified by LandSat. The Soviets are
 sure to label this as technological imperialism and
 tout themselves as the guardian of the resources of
 underdeveloped nations that would be taken advan-
 tage of by U. S. industry with superior knowledge of
 the location and extent of raw material resources.
 The U. S. military also has adjusted to the new
 reality following Carter's October 1978 confirmation
 of photo satellite operations. The fiscal year  1)80
 Military  Posture statement  from  the  U. S.  Joint
 Chiefs of Staff includes this comment on the subject:
 "The purposes of the US  reconnaissance and
 surveillance program are: to provide strategic early
 warning;  to  monitor  enemy  forces;  to  assess

 maintain a data base for operations planning; to
 conduct ocean surveillance; to monitor compliance
 with strategic arms limitation agreements; and to
 support  crisis  monitoring  and  decisionmaking.
 The US collection effort employs ground-based,
 airborne,  shipboard,  and satellite systems.
 Space technology has contributed importantly, to
 the reconnaissance and surveillance program."
 This document provides some additional specific
 information on satellite reconnaissance systems. In
 the glossary two acronyms are identified:  EORSAT
 (ELINT Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite) and RORSAT
 (Radar Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite). A  RORSAT
 system was identified in Navy testimony released by
 the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Clipper
 Bow project was described as a satellite equipped
 with an active radar that was being designed to pro-
 vide atactical all-weather capability of detecting sur-
 face vessels. The Navy's White Cloud project uses
 clusters of EORSATs.  When Clipper Bow is fully op-
 erational, the EORSATs will allow correlation of sig-
 nal emissions with radar targets obtained from that
 system's radar satellites (see Aviation Week fi Space
 Technology,  l0  May  1.976,  page  21;  12  February
 1977, page ); 19 December 1977, page l8; 10 July
 1)78, page 22; 28 August 1978, page 50).
 In yet another use of satellites, the Navy gained
 favorable publicity during operation Stopgap for its
 radar ocean surveillance. In July 1)78, a news report
 credited the use of information provided by Navy
 ocean surveillance satellites in the tracking and sei-
 zure of 40 oceangoing ships attempting to smuggle
 more than a million pounds of marijuana into the
 United States. For four and a half months, the Navy
 Ocean Surveillance Information Center  (NOSIC)  re-
 layed  its  intelligence  to  the  Drug  Enforcement
 Agency which then passed it on to the Coast Guard
 for enforcement action.
 The point of the real and potential political impact
 of high-altitude and satellite photography has been
 made in the case of the U-2 incident and the Cuban
 Missile Crisis. The impact that such material has al-
 ready had in the SALT negotiations, and will have if
 there are future efforts to get a SALT treaty approved,
 is yet to be revealed. There may be another historical
 example of high political use of such material. A po-
 tential for such use would have been during the 1)72
 Nixon visit to China. The following scenario is, as
 far as  the author knows,  a complete  fabrication.
 There is only one very chin reed upon which to base
 any speculation concerning the possibility of its real
 occurrence. This will be identified later. The action
 opens on 2 June  1971  in the Oval Office of the
 White House during the planning phase of Henry
 Kissinger's 9- t 1 July secret visit to Peking.
 President  Nixon:  "Henry,  we  know  from  our
 Warsaw talks chat the Chinese are ready for more
 public discussions, higher visibility, heads of state
 meeting, But I want. you to make it perfectly clear
 that in no way is the United States going to China
 with  apologies  or humility.  We are the premier
 power in the world, and I want you to be careful to
 point that out in a diplomatic way, of course."
 Kissinger: "I understand, Mr. President. It is a
 bold and imaginative move you are planning."
 Although not used for intelligence, the earth resources
 obserr~atron satellite, LandSat, offers potential for information
 gatherh:g rn the areas of agriculh~re, geography, geology,
 hydrology, and oceanography.

 The facts that could support Act IV are that the
 People's Republic of China launched a photo satellite
 on 26 November 1975 and recovered it on 2 Decem-
 ber, during President Ford's visit.
 As previously noted, the United States has on oc-
 casion used the fruits of its reconnaissance programs
 for political purposes. There is no public evidence
 that Nixon did so in China during his February 1972
 visit. It is speculated that the temptation to do so
 was present. Whether or not it was acted upon is not
 publicly known. What the public does know is that
 a smiling  Vice  Premier Teng Hsiao-ping artfully
 ducked a question on the number of Chinese troops
 committed to the Sino-Vietnamese border war  in
 February 1979, by noting that "as regards the esti-
 mate of the size of forces involved, your satellites
 offer accurate information, and that's about the size
 of it." (The Washington Port, 28 February 1979.)
 Whether or not we have shared any hard photo
 intelligence  with  the  Chinese  about  the  Soviets
 should remain in genuine secrecy. The possibility of
 this must be of serious concern to the Soviet Union,
 and it seems to be in our best interest to avoid reliev-
 ing their tension one way or another. In the mean-
 time, the Chinese are working to achieve their own
 independent capability in this field. The Soviets have
 orbited an impressive number of intelligence-related
 satellites, and we know that they have enjoyed at
 least one striking espionage success in finding out
 about the capability of the KH-tt. This failure not-

 Stares to  protect this technical intelligence system
 appear to have been along-run success.
 There certainly  will be a secret future for Soviet,
 Chinese, U. S., and other countries' military intelli-
 gence satellites. Whether or not some of the U. S.
 materials are released for domestic political purposes,
 the world appears to be on the threshold of a bur-
 geoning use of space-derived sensor material,  The
 United Nations may get into the business of verifica-
 tion  of treaty  provisions.  Equally  important,  the
 United Nations may have a paramount role to play in
 managing  LandSat-type  materials  for  the  general
 benefit of all member nations, but for the specific
 protection of Third and Fourth World nations. The
 United States will have to make a decision on the
 type of role it will play. We have many years' worth
 of collection of worldwide graphics  in our military
 archives and improving capabilities for more of the
 same. Additionally, we lead the world in experience
 and capability with earth resource materials gleaned
 from  our  LandSat  systems.  Plans  have  been  an-
 nounced for advanced LandSat systems, and the ex-
 ploitation of these materials has high commercial
 interest. If it has not already been done, the devel-
 opment of an integrated optics data processor capable
 of satellite  on-board comparison  of sensor output
 with scored reference data should provide capability
 in our reronnaissance satellites to dually accomplish
 military missions and those missions dedicated to
 support the United Nations as well as some commer-
 cial enterprises.
 The incredible capability of these technical intelli-
 gence collection systems has been vital to our na-
 tional security. This view is also probably shared by
 the Soviet Union from its own security perspective.
 More than  17 years ago, Deputy Defense Secretary
 Roswell Gilpatric addressed the ironic consequences
 of  Soviet  secrecy  and  American  openness,  "The
 Soviets are forced to work very hard to keep up with
 what they know we are doing to keep up with what
 we think they are doing." In 1962, that was a rea-
 sonable statement. In 1)80, the Soviet Union should
 be well over the shock of being on the wrong side of
 the "missile gap." Both countries for some time have
 had the technical capability of knowing with reason-
 able accuracy what each other's strategic offensive
 strength actually  is.  We concede that the Soviets
 know what we are doing, and we claim that we know
 what they are doing. Such statements appear to be
 adequate explanations for expected dampening of the
 strategic anus race. Something has not worked our.
 Some of our national security managers who have
 been supported by satellite intelligence systems that

 have provided evidence that the Soviets have not
 been satisfied merely to close the gap of strategic
 weapon systems, are now nervous that in order to
 obtain a SALT treaty, these vital intelligence systems
 to some degree may be compromised.
 I think that there is another equally important
 consideration. If any U'. S. President uses satellite
 photographic materials to make his case on the ver-
 ifiability of a SALT treaty, or to justify potential mili-
 tary action, he will be taking unpredictable risks in
 public response. The same proof that SALT can be
 verified may also be interpreted by a suspicious pub-
 lic that SALT II is many years too late, and that we
 now should not be limiting our strategic options in
 the face of graphic Soviet capabilities. In the case of
 justification of potential military action, what would
 the American public  response be when presented
 with a larger portion of truth of graphic danger to
 the country? One would like to think that Americans
 can take the truth and would thereby be galvanized
 in support of whatever sacrifice is necessary to meet
 the peril. If this occurs, it will be a dangerous mo-
 ment for the world. The Soviets will be placed at a
 critical point  of decision.  If war  is  avoided,  the
 eclipse of their power someday may be measured
 from such a moment. In the United States, one re-
 sponse can be safely predicted. In this case, "One
 picture will provoke more than ten thousand words."
 There will be many, many words. More importantly,
 there should be a quickly developing vision of many
 additional applications of a technical system  now
 primarily serving the national security community.
 That may be considered by a few as an unacceptable
 loss of monopoly over precious technical resources.
 There is, of course, the potential of strong counter-
 weight arguments. But these can reasonably be made
 only when the closet door of satellite photographic
 system capability is further ajar.
 Commander Jones w:u commissioned in 1)50 fol-
 lowing flight training in the Aviation Midship-
 man program.  He made two combat tours  in
 VF-191 flying the F9F-2 Panther (rum the USS
 Prinrernrr (CV-3?). He received his A.B. degree at
 George Washington University in 19C,] and also
 t '`   has an  M.A.  from the University of Maryland
 (1961), and a Ph.D. from American University (1975). A variety
 of intelligence assignments rounded out the latter part of his
 career. These included intelligence officer, Carrier Division  14;
 assistant naval attache, New Delhi, India; Navy Scientific and
 Technical Intelligence Center; and J-2, U. S.  European Com-
 mand.  Since  retirement  he  has  taught  at  the  University  of
 Vi/yoming and Casper College. Currently he is research director
 with R. F. Cross Associates, Ltd., in Alexandria, Virginia.
