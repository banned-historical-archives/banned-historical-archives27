 PAKISTAN: Bhutto Losing Ground
 The political situation in Pakistan is confused and
 changing rapidly,  but Prime Minister Bhutto is clearly losing
 strength and there is a general feeling that his resignation
 is imminent.
 The army apparently is trying to force both pro- and
 anti-government politicians into an agreement. Army leaders
 hope to avoid having to seize power, but unless another solu-
 tion is found soon, they may have no other choice. The security
 situation in the Punjab--Pakistan's most important province--
 continues to deteriorate. Should serious violence break out on
 Friday, the Muslim holy day when demonstrations tend to peak,
 the army's hand might well be forced.
 I             The opposition still shows no inclination to compro-
 mise. One of the few opposition leaders still at large has
 visited key opposition leaders in the past few days. He is pre-
 sumably discussing a political solution.
 Bhutto has little left to bargain with. He can no
 longer count on the support of the military.  Some members of
 his own party--although none of his close associates--have re-
 signed,                           sparking speculation that mass desertions will occur.
 Given Bhutto's growing weakness and the opposition's
 unwillingness to compromise,  the US embassy believes that any
 negotiated solution would, at a minimum,  stri  Bhutto of effec-
 tive power even if it left him in office.

 EGYPT-LIBYA:  Charge and Countercharge
 The flow of invective between Egypt and Libya has
 been accented by officially inspired violence in both countries.
 The Egyptian consulate in Benghazi was sacked Satur-
 day and its workers confined in a nearby hotel, and yesterday
 Libyans demonstrated at the Egyptian embassy in Tripoli fol-
 lowing a government-sponsored rally to denounce Egyptian Presi-
 dent Sadat. Libya has also imposed further restrictions on
 travel by Egyptians, this time on those trying to leave Libya.
 I     I  Egypt has retaliated in kind to almost every incident.
 Egyptians burned the Libyan consulate in Alexandria on Monday.
 The Egyptian ambassador returned to Cairo on April 7. There
 has been no indication so far that Libyan diplomats will be
 ordered out of Egypt or recalled by Tripoli.
 I The media in both countries continue to trade charges.
 In a slight shift in tactics, Cairo dailies on Tuesday argued
 that Egypt should exercise restraint with regard to Libya be-
 cause Libyans themselves were fed up with Qadhafi and would
 soon oust him. Egypt, it was argued, must guard against pro-
 viding Qadhafi with a foreign scapegoat with which to rally
 the people.

 LEBANON-ISRAEL:  Situation Report
 Despite heavy artillery fire between Lebanese Chris-
 tians an                          the Palestinians,  the situation in southern Lebanon
 appeared to be stabilizing yesterday with little,  if any, move-
 ment by the forces of either side.  The US embassy in Beirut
 said that the village of Dayr Mimas may have been occupied by
 the Palestinians on Tuesday but that it was reportedly almost
 empty at the time.  No action was reported in Marj Uyun;  the
 Christians apparently still hold the center of the town.  The
 Israelis,  meanwhile,  have warned the Syrians that Israel will
 act if necessary to protect its interests in southern Lebanon.
 I           In a television interview on Tuesday, Israeli Foreign
 minister Allon listed the principles that he said were the
 basis of present Israeli policy toward southern Lebanon. He
 reiterated Israel's determination that neither Syrian nor pan-
 Arab forces would be allowed to penetrate south of their exist-
 ing positions and asserted that Israel would not permit a re-
 newal of cross-border terrorist activity from southern Lebanon.
 Allon said Israel would not permit the Palestinians to move
 against the Christian villages near the Israeli border and
 would not allow any interference with humanitarian activity
 under the "good fence" policy.
 Allon's statement appeared to be intended specifically
 to remind the Syrians that Israel holds them responsible for
 Palestinian actions. Although he acknowledged that the Syrian
 army was not directly involved in the fighting, he asserted
 that last week's Palestinian-leftist counteroffensive had Syrian
 blessing. Allon's comments also were intended as a warning to
 the Syrians that, despite the current political situation in
 Israel, the Israelis remain sensitive to any effort by Syria to
 strengthen its position in southern Lebanon.

 INTERNATIONAL:  Nonaligned Communique
 I     I The final communique of the nonaligned foreign min-
 isters  meeting in New Delhi, which ended Monday, contains a
 large amount of anti-imperialist rhetoric but is generally
 milder than the document issued after the nonaligned summit in
 Sri Lanka last year. Nevertheless, moderates have expressed
 reservations about several parts of the communique and an ac-
 companying economic statement.  A Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion amendment, which included Puerto Ricans among the colonial
 peoples struggling against foreign domination,  has drawn the
 most objections.
 The tone of the Korean section of the communique was
 more moderate than the language in the Colombo declaration, al-
 though it called for the withdrawal from South Korea of all
 foreign troops, including "all of their military apparatus."
 Nonaligned moderates resisted North Korean efforts to add
 stronger wording critical of South Korea and the US.
 I     I The conference took a strong stand on southern Africa,
 u   i  resisted efforts to name specific countries as collabo-
 rating with South Africa and dropped a Cuban amendment on ra-
 cism that condemned the US, West European countries, and Israel.
 I           There was no mention of the possible expulsion of Is-
 rael trom the UN, and all references to the US in the draft on
 the Middle East submitted by the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion were omitted from the communique. Even some references to
 Zionism were toned down.
 The base at Diego Garcia was mentioned as objection-
 able. T e conference noted recent great-power statements on
 the Indian Ocean zone of peace, but without giving any credit
 to the US.
 The conference adopted a separate resolution empha-
 sizing Its unhappiness at the failure of the conference at Ge-

 SPAIN: Army Accepts Communist Party
 The Spanish army yesterday announced its ac-

 against the party's legalization.

 A West German official has told the US embassy in
 onn    a no decision can be made on West German participation
 in the NATO airborne radar system known as AWACS until after a
 thorough review of the impact of Britain's decision not to
 participate in the program. The British announced in early
 April that they would opt for the British-developed Nimrod
 system rather than participate in AWACS.
 The official, who heads the political department of
 e west German Defense Ministry, indicated that he believes
 participation in AWACS will be considered by the Bundestag
 this year. The NATO allies are scheduled to announce their
 plans for participation in July. The heavy funding required
 by the system could delay actual participation until the early
 1980s.
 I           IThe official said the review would have to include
 a study o   the numbers of aircraft still needed and the impli-
 cations of the dual system. He also said that very close at-
 tention should be given to determining the exact start-up and
 operational costs of AWACS so that precise figures can be pre-
 sented to the Bundestag. The West Germans are unhappy with the
 share of the costs of AWACS they are expected to bear.
 In addition to the cost factor, AWACS could face
 tough sledding in the Bundestag because of the opposition of
 the armed forces, which have good connections with Bundestag
 military committees. The armed services believe AWACS would
 divert funds from their established procurement programs; the
 bulk of such funds have been earmarked for the next several
 years for procurement of tanks and other aircraft.
 I            IBonn's desire that the US choose a West German tank
 gun, rather than a British gun, for the XM-1 main battle tank
 is likely to play a role in the final decision, although the
 US embassy reports that few West German officials are raising
 this issue formally.

 ROMANIA:  Embargoed Electronics
 I            Romania apparently is trying to obtain embargoed
 e ec ron2cs  equipment in its request for earthquake disaster
 relief.  The Romanians have asked for a long list of items,  in-
 cl.uding several embargoed electronics products,  that they say
 are needed to replace capital goods damaged in the earthquake
 last month.  They say they lack foreign exchange to pay for the
 items.
 Included in the request are the following embargoed
 --A complete IBM 370/158 computer center, or an equivalent
 large-scale computer.
 --A Tektronix integrated circuit analyzer, type 7603,  for
 testing integrated circuits.
 --A Tektronix oscilloscope with a digital voltmeter, model
 7904, for checking electronic circuits in a computer for
 malfunctions.
 I        lUS suppliers report that they have never sold Romania
 instruments such as the integrated circuit analyzer and the
 oscilloscope with a digital voltmeter. A recent Romanian re-
 quest for authorization to buy a complete IBM 370/158 computer
 center was turned down by the US government.
 IBM has reported, moreover, that all its computer
 equipment installed in Romania was back in operation within
 four hours after the earthquake. Romania's request suggests
 that it hopes to use the earthquake damage as a cover to obtain
 sophisticated equipment Probably not available from East Euro-
 pean or Soviet sources.

 CHINA-JAPAN:  Long-Term Trade

 materials, and various plants--including power-generating
 facilities--which would be used to expand Chinese oil and coal

 duration of the agreement, annual target levels of Chinese ex-
 ports, and payment terms, remain to be negotiated between the
 Chinese Foreign Trade Ministry and Japanese businesses.
 I             IChina's initiative in proposing the agreement is
 anotner indication of the general consensus within the leader-
 ship to use natural resources to earn foreign exchange. This
 policy came under sharp attack last year by the now-purged
 "gang of four." In an apparent effort to expedite exports of
 oil, coal, and other natural resources, Peking has reportedly
 established a new committee consisting of China's top economic
 officials,  including Minister of Trade Li Chiang.

 SIERRA LEONE:   Parliamentary Elections
 //The government of Sierra Leone has announced
 p bans to   o    a parliamentary election on May 6. Although Presi-
 dent Siaka Stevens is not himself up for re-election--he began
 a new five-year term last May after being re-elected by the
 parliament--he is seeking to ensure his continued control of
 the government through his party,  the All People's Congress,
 and has been campaigning actively.//
 Under Stevens'  leadership,  the All People's Congress
 ousted the Sierra Leone People's Party in a close election in
 1967. During the last parliamentary election, held in May 1973,
 the ruling party used strong-arm tactics to intimidate the op-
 position and won all seats in the house.
 //In January and February of this year,  students
 demonstrated against the government and called for Stevens'  res-
 ignation. These demonstrations turned into riots, resulting in
 the deaths of at least eight students and temporary closings of
 primary and secondary schools in Freetown, the capital.  In an
 attempt to restore order, Stevens promised to hold an election
 within three months.//
 Stevens is aware that his party's past tactics have
 em i  ere  what is left of the opposition.  In an effort to mol-
 lify his opponents,  he recently said he will not oppose partic-
 ipation in the election by the People's Party. He has also said
 that many of the ruling party incumbents in the parliament will
 not be re-elected.
 By taking this tack, Stevens is trying to cultivate
 support from whoever is likely to be elected.  Some of his sup-
 porters resent this because they think Stevens is willing to
 sacrifice their positions for his own benefit.
 I            Although the President is adopting a conciliatory ap-
 proach dust now, it is possible that he will again resort to
 violence and intimidation to ensure his party's dominance.  If
 so, he is likely to use these tactics on nomination day, which
 may be as early as tomorrow.  In any case the opposition cannot
 hope to win control of the parliament.

 force.  In making the announcement at an annual conference of
 the ruling Botswana Democratic Party, Khama noted regretfully
 that the move would require the government to shift resources
 from badly needed-economic development to the purchase of arms
 and the training of an army.
 I       uIn addressing the reasons for creating an army, Khama

 only armed security force in the country, into clearly defined
 military and police units.  Recruiting has been under way for
 some time, and automatic weapons and ammunition are being pur-
 chased from Western sources to supplement military equipment,
 including arms, already received from China.
 I     I This small military force will still be largely un-
 a  e        pe with the security problems that are likely to
 continue along the long border with Rhodesia. Rhodesian security
 forces frequently violate the border trying to stop guerrillas
 on their way into Rhodesia and young refugees on their way out
 to guerrilla training camps in Zambia and Tanzania.
 I Botswana is under pressure from the other front-line
 states to close the border with Rhodesia, which would shut
 down the Rhodesian-run railroad through Botswana to South
 Africa. Khania believes these pressures are too great for him
 to continue his program of peaceful economic development. The
 diversion of scarce financial capital to military development
 will be a setback to Botswana's prospects for economic progress.
 In his announcement this week, Khama strongly reiter-
 ated Botswana's commitment to the democratic process and his
 personal opposition to the one-party systems that are common
 in Africa.
