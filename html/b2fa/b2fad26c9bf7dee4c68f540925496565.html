 and economic assistance in their modernization program. Curbing Soviet
 influence in P'yongyang is another major concern. The new element in
 China's Korean policy is the strengthening of economic ties to South
 Korea, which Beijing sees as both a potential market for Chinese goods and
 a source of technology.
 China's relations with North Korea are strained, and, more important,
 Beijing sees itself losing ground to Moscow. We believe China's expanding
 ties to the West in general, and the United States especially, are the
 principal reasons for the downturn.
 China's dealings with South Korea are expanding
 Trade, largely
 through third parties, now exceeds both Chinese-North Korean trade and
 South Korean-Taiwanese trade. There have been increasing political
 contacts, mostly at international conferences and sporting events, but
 China steadfastly refuses any official or quasiofficial ties, to avoid further
 alienation of the North.
 China wants to regain some of the influence in North Korea-always
 limited in our judgment-it has lost to the Soviet Union, but it is poorly po-
 sitioned to compete now. It cannot match the military assistance Moscow
 can provide, nor can Beijing significantly increase its economic aid, given
 the demands of its own modernization program. We believe that Beijing
 has little choice but to continue to pursue a mix of its present policies:
 ? Reassure the North through high-level visits and propaganda support for
 key North Korean goals, such as a US troop withdrawal and a cohost role
 for the 1988 Olympics, that China is sensitive to its interests. We believe
 Beijing will also stress privately that its good relations with Washington
 make it a more effective lobbyist on P'yongyang's behalf.

 ? Push the North to expand its economic and political contacts with the
 West.
 ? Encourage talks between the North and South and press the United
 States to open a dialogue with the North. Beijing will continue to resist
 quadrapartite talks and push tripartite talks (P'yongyang, Washington,
 and Seoul), in part because this is what the North wants. Beijing also
 fears getting trapped in discussions that would force it to side with the
 North, invest its prestige in a process over which it has limited control
 and might end badly, and inject a new contentious element into its
 relations with Washington.
 Because Beijing has little influence at present in either P'yongyang or
 Seoul, its interests on the Peninsula are hostage to the actions of the key
 players there. Particularly disturbing to the Chinese, we believe, is the
 thought that for now at least they must count on P'yongyang's stubborn in-
 dependence and Moscow's wariness of the North's intentions to curb the
 growth of Soviet influence.
 We believe China sees the United States as holding the key to recapturing
 some of its lost influence in P'yongyang. In our judgment, Beijing believes
 that, if it can get Washington and Tokyo to expand contacts with
 P'yongyang, it can defuse the North's suspicions and offset Soviet material
 assistance.
 China's Korean policy will face major challenges if the North-South talks
 collapse, Soviet-North Korean military cooperation continues to expand,
 or there is serious instability in either the North or the South. In each in-
 stance, Beijing's initial reaction is likely to be a combination of counseling
 restraint with the North and pressing Washington harder to show some
 flexibility toward P'yongyang.

 China's Korean Policy:
 Few Options~-]
 China's key objective on the Korean Peninsula has
 remained relatively constant for many years-to
 avoid a military crisis that would force China to side
 with the North against the United States and Japan,
 to whom the Chinese look for critical strategic and
 economic assistance in their modernization drive.
 A second and closely related concern is to check
 Soviet influence. In our judgment, the Chinese are
 deeply concerned about another "Vietnam" on their
 northeastern frontier: that is, a hostile country that is
 dependent upon and aligned with Moscow. Indeed,
 judging from Chinese actions in East Asia, we think
 the Chinese have long wanted, for power and prestige,
 to be regarded by Washington and Tokyo as a key
 factor in preserving stability on the Peninsula and as a
 bulwark against Soviet penetration.
 The new element in China's Korean policy is an
 outgrowth of its own economic reform program. As
 China has pursued modernization, it has become
 increasingly interested in developing economic ties to
 South Korea. We believe, on the basis of Chinese
 media commentary                 , that Beijing
 sees the South's burgeoning economy as an important
 market for Chinese exports, and as a source of
 technology and investment capital. A secondary goal
 is to influence Seoul's policy toward Taiwan and
 broader regional issues.
 P'yongyang-The Problem
 Sources of Strain
 China's opening to the outside world under Deng
 Xiaoping has left its longstanding alliance with North

 Korea as an anomaly. Aggressive, isolationist, anti-
 US, P'yongyang espouses a world view fundamentally
 at odds with Beijing's domestic and foreign policies.
 Given Beijing's role in brokering North Korean reuni-
 fication initiatives since the late 1970s, we believe
 Beijing probably has tried to contain tensions and
 suspicions by telling P'yongyang that China's opening
 to Washington would further North Korean goals,
 specifically by improving Beijing's ability to lobby on
 We believe, however, that North Korea's doubts
 about China have increased. Specifically, China's
 willingness to establish closer ties to the United
 States, particularly military links, and to quietly
 expand trade and unofficial contacts with Seoul-
 without delivering the dialogue P'yongyang desires
 with the United States-have probably heightened
 North Korean concerns about whether China can be
 counted on to help secure its goals, and about whether
 Beijing might even sacrifice the North's interests in
 the pursuit of its own strategic and economic objec-
 tives. We see P'yongyang's warming relations with
 Moscow, in part, as a manifestation of this concern.
 Given the importance to Beijing of maintaining its
 influence in P'yongyang, the turn to Moscow, in our
 judgment, represents a major setback for China. We
 believe Chinese policymakers miscalculated how
 sharply P'yongyang would react to China's dual-track
 policy. The Chinese probably were caught offguard by
 Moscow's decision to go along with P'yongyang's

 China's Relations With North Korea in
 Historical Perspective
 Since 1979, Beijing's relations with Pyongyang have
 fared inversely to the ups and downs of US-Chinese
 relations. Both sides appeared willing to mute differ-
 ences, especially regarding Beijing's dismantling of
 the Maoist legacy and its break with the orthodox
 socialist development model, during periods of ten-
 sion between Beijing and Washington, but relations
 have tended to sour when US-Chinese relations have
 improved.
 Sino-North Korean ties were especially strained fol-
 lowing the visits of Deng Xiaoping and Hua Guofeng
 to North Korea in 1978 just as the Chinese pro-
 claimed their policy of a united front with the United
 States, Japan, and Western Europe against the Soviet
 Union. Beijing and Pyongyang differed,
 over China's ties to the United
 States and its invasion of Vietnam. Other bilateral
 irritants include Beijing's unwillingness to provide
 greater military aid, to reschedule North Korean
 debt, to provide more oil, and to recognize Kim Il-
 song's son, Kim Chong-il, as the legitimate North
 Korean successor. At the same time, Beijing-which
 was preoccupied with the Vietnam crisis-sought to
 maintain a floor under Sino-North Korean relations,
 in part by pressing Washington to be more flexible
 toward the North and to withdraw its troops from the
 South.
 As US-Chinese relations deteriorated in 1981 over
 policy toward Taiwan, Beijing made new overtures to
 P'yongyang and the two countries moved closer to-
 get her.
 Chinese and North Korean leaders made a series of
 important, high-level visits over the next two years.
 In spring 1982, Deng and then party Chairman Hu
 Yaobang made an unpublicized trip to Pyongyang,
 which Kim 11-song reciprocated with a visit to Beijing
 after the 12th Party Congress in September. Perhaps
 most important, in early June 1983 Kim Chong-il, in
 Beijing, was accorded a full leadership turnout,
 including the entire Secretariat and as many as 14
 members of the Politburo-a sure sign that the
 leadership had decided to remove another impedi-
 ment to better relations by recognizing him as Kim Il-
 song's successor.
 The Chinese invitation of US Secretary of Defense
 Weinberger to Beijing in September 1983 and the
 Chinese decision to work for improved ties to the
 United States initiated another period of tense rela-
 tions. Chinese leaders have continued their efforts to
 broker North Korean "peace initiatives" during this
 period in part to retain some hold over Pyongyang.
 During their meeting in late September, Deng Xiao-
 ping passed along a North Korean proposal to hold
 tripartite talks involving the United States, and
 North and South Korea, with China playing an
 unspecified role on the sidelines. The North Korean
 bombing in Rangoon, which came on the day after
 Pyongyang asked Beijing to pass on its proposal for
 tripartite talks to the United States, both embar-
 rassed and angered the Chinese. China's subsequent
 public condemnation of North Korean "acts of terror-
 ism, " US and South Korean rejection of the terms of
 the North Korean proposal, and Beijing's growing
 indirect trade and political contacts all led to P'yong-
 yang's renewed overtures to the Soviet Union for
 military aid and support.

 Figure 2. The propriety oj'Kim
 Chong-il's succeeding hisfa-
 ther, Kim 11-song, as leader of
 North Korea concerned Beijing
 until June 1983, when virtually
 the entire Chinese leadership
 turned out to greet the younger
 Kim in Beijing.F_~
 North's decision to expand its military relationship
 with the Soviets. The delivery in 1985 of almost a full
 regiment of MIG-23s, the port call by Soviet naval
 vessels this August, and-perhaps most alarming for
 Beijing-P'yongyang's decision to permit Soviet re-
 connaissance aircraft to overfly North Korean air-
 space to collect intelligence against China ' probably
 create fears that P'yongyang might eventually give
 the Soviets regular access to North Korean air and
 naval facilities just as Vietnam has-in exchange
 for increased military and economic assistance.
 P'yongyang's support of Soviet foreign policy posi-
 tions that run counter to Chinese interests has also
 angered Beijing. According to the US Embassy in
 Moscow, Chinese officials there noted with dismay
 North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yongnam's en-
 dorsement of Vietnam's peace proposals during his
 visit to the USSR last May. The North also has
 endorsed Moscow's call for "socialist unity" in the
 face of "imperialist aggression" in East Asia-a call
 Beijing pointedly rejected more than two years ago,
 Equally important,
 the North has often questioned the ideological basis of
 China's modernization program, which reflects just
 how far the two have drifted apart both strategically
 and ideologically. P'yongyang underlined this notion
 last July when Kim 11-song noted that, although
 North Korea wants to build up its economy through
 increased contacts with the outside world, North
 Korea would "never" introduce foreign capital and
 risk becoming a "subjugated" economy like China.
 Although relations are strained, the Chinese have not
 given up on the North Koreans. Indeed, they have
 sought to mollify them in the hope of retaining
 influence in P'yongyang. They repeatedly endorse the
 North's reunification proposal, for example, by pub-
 licly backing its bid to cohost the 1988 Olympics and   25X1
 by calling for the withdrawal of US forces from South
 Korea, and request that the United States cut back or
 suspend the joint US-South Korean Team Spirit
 Exercise. Moreover, by sending Vice Premier Li Peng,
 Zhao Ziyang's probable successor, in October 1985 to
 attend the anniversary of China's entry into the
 Korean war, the Chinese are underscoring the impor-
 tance they attach to developing close ties between
 China's successor generation and the North's.
 Limited Leverage
 As tensions have grown in Sino-North Korean rela-
 tions, Chinese ability to influence decisionmaking in
 P'yongyang-which we believe was always limited-
 has, in our judgment, declined. US Embassy reporting
 from Beijing leads us to believe Beijing's modest
 economic and military aid to P'yongyang is insuffi-
 cient to create the leverage to alter P'yongyang's
 policy direction. Moreover, China does not have the      25X1
 resources-or the inclination, given the North's poor
 record of repayment-to meet once again the North's
 pressing need for credits, investment, and, to a lesser
 extent, oil. Nor can it compete with the Soviets in
 supplying military technology, as a Chinese specialist
 on the Koreas recently acknowledged to US officials.
 Economic Imperative
 If political considerations are driving China's rela-
 tions with the North, economic interest is the force
 behind China's expanding contacts with the South.
 Indirect trade-handled mainly through Hong Kong
 and Japan-grew rapidly in the second half of 1984
 and the first three months of 1985 before Beijing
 clamped down on all trade to slow the hemorrhaging

 The Korean states have predictably irreconcilable
 goals regarding China. Pyongyang wants to inhibit
 South Korean contacts with China and the Soviet
 Union while expanding economic relations with Japan
 and political contacts with the United States. Seoul
 seeks to expand economic relations with Beijing and
 use the 1988 Olympic award to increase at least
 cultural exchanges with the Soviets, while warning
 both Washington and Tokyo to keep their distance
 from Pyongyang.
 Operating within its own triangle, North Korea plays
 Moscow and Beijing off against one another, but
 taking care, in our judgment, to avoid unnecessarily
 or permanently antagonizing either of its giant neigh-
 bors. Regarding China in particular, we believe
 Pyongyang takes seriously shared sacrifices during
 the Korean war, basks in Chinese praise for the
 North Korean system, and relies on Chinese support
 for North Korean security policies.
 North Korea's complex relationship with China is
 reflected in its ambiguous attitude toward improved
 US-Chinese relations. Pyongyang, in our judgment,
 worries that Beijing privately favors retention of US
 troops in South Korea to counter the Soviet military
 buildup in Asia. The North wants Beijing to make
 withdrawal of US forces in South Korea a condition
 for better ties to Washington, just as China has made
 Soviet troops in Afghanistan and along the Sino-
 Soviet border obstacles to improved Sino-Soviet rela-
 At the same time, Pyongyang recognizes that it could
 benefit from the Beijing-Washington relationship,
 and we believe the North continues to press China to
 argue its case. Although probably unhappy with the
 results to date, Pyongyang has not entirely given up
 hope that Sino-US ties can be exploited. Over the last
 year, for instance, the North Koreans have passed a
 series of messages via Chinese foreign ministry offi-
 cials to the US Embassy in Beijing concerning the
 North-South Korean dialogue and Pyongyang's pro-
 posal for tripartite US-North Korean-South Korean
 talks.
 Seoul, of course, hopes to use its expanding economic
 ties to China as a lever for eventual diplomatic
 relations. South Korean expectations in this regard
 seem exaggerated. Seoul lacks Pyongyang's ability
 to play off rival Soviet and Chinese suitors. Beijing
 has consistently turned aside all attempts to establish
 an official or quasi-official political relationship, and
 will continue to do so because of the need to protect
 Beijing's credibility in Pyongyang.
 Seoul, too, probably has mixed feelings about US-
 Chinese ties. Fearing secret deals, the South is
 capable of seeing the worst in normal contacts. At the
 same time, Seoul believes good US-Chinese relations
 reduce North Korean options on the Peninsula.

 in its foreign exchange holdings (see chart). Even so,
 trade between the two had already exceeded $500
 million in August, and some South Korean business-
 men predict it could reach $1 billion in 1985-more
 than double China's trade with North Korea. The
 Chinese no longer try very hard to mask this trade.
 China's English-language newspaper, China Daily,
 for example, published a prominent advertisement for
 Samsung, a South Korean electronics conglomerate,
 last May. Beijing, moreover, now permits South Kore-
 an businessmen to travel in China, to confer directly
 with Chinese officials, and to form joint ventures with
 Chinese firms-although the Chinese still generally
 require the South Koreans to use a subsidiary outside
 of South Korea. The Korean firm Daewoo, for exam-
 has formed a joint venture with a Hong Kong middle-
 man and a Fujian provincial enterprise to build
 refrigerator and television assembly lines in Fuzhou,
 according to the US Consulate in Hong Kong.

 cording to our analysis, the Chinese media continue to
 follow trends in the South Korean economy with great
 interest.
 Political Considerations
 Beijing probably also sees some potential political
 return from its expanding economic contacts. Over
 the longer run, Beijing probably hopes it can under-
 mine Taipei's relations with Seoul by building strong
 trade ties to South Korea-the only country in Asia
 that still recognizes Taiwan. Indeed, Sino-South Ko-
 rean trade through August 1985 already exceeds the
 total value of Taiwan's trade with the South in 1984,
 $475 million (see the chart).
 Translating economic ties into political leverage is
 another matter, but unofficial contacts are increasing.
 Chinese and South Korean citizens now routinely
 attend international conferences and sporting events
 in each other's country. China also has opened direct
 mail and telephone links to Seoul and allowed family
 reunion visits between South Korea and Heilongjiang

 Province, which has a large Korean minority popula-
 tion-something that must displease P'yongyang.
 Crises of one sort or another have propelled the
 relationship forward. The hijacking of a Chinese
 airliner to Seoul in May 1983 produced the first face-
 to-face negotiations between the two countries with-
 out a third country present, and similiar incidents
 since have been resolved in a businesslike manner.
 Limitations
 The obvious interest on both sides notwithstanding,
 we believe Chinese-South Korean political contacts
 probably will not progress much further. The impor-
 tance to Beijing of maintaining what leverage it has
 with the North-particularly when Moscow is gaining
 ground there-effectively gives P'yongyang a veto
 over political ties. Moreover, Beijing's strategic as-
 sessment of the Peninsula is unlikely to change: the
 recognition that tensions there would undercut key
 policies elsewhere makes mollifying P'yongyang high
 on Beijing's list of priorities. Some expansion of South
 Korean-Chinese political contacts may be possible as
 a follow-on to expanded North-South contacts or
 US-North Korean contacts. China has more room to
 maneuver on economic relations, if only because so
 much of the trade goes through third parties.
 Few Options
 With limitations on how far it can go with Seoul and a
 cooling relationship with P'yongyang, Beijing, in our
 judgment, has little choice but to continue to pursue a
 mix of its present policies. Specifically, over the next
 year, we expect China to attempt to regain some of
 the ground it has lost in North Korea by continuing
 to:
 ? Reassure the North. Beijing can be expected to
 expend considerable energy in the form of high-level
 visits attempting to convince P'yongyang of the
 wisdom of its opening to the West and China's
 sensitivity to North Korea's interests. Party General
 Secretary Hu Yaobang consults with senior North
 Korean leaders regularly, and he personally oversees
 China's Korean policy. We believe Beijing has been
 careful to brief the North Koreans on the substance,
 if not the details, of each round of talks with senior
 US officials, and we expect this to continue. The
 Chinese will also continue to call for US troop
 withdrawals and give propaganda support on issues
 of concern to the North.
 ? Push the Open Door. The Chinese keep trying to
 convince P'yongyang of the merits of pursuing an
 open-door policy similar to their own. They take

 mier Kang in 1984, to the model Shenzhen Special

 have given broad and enthusiastic coverage to the
 talks and to other North-South efforts at reconcilia-

 Economic Zone, and encourage them to seek West-
 ern investment. The joint-venture law P'yongyang
 adopted soon after indicates the Chinese may be
 having some success in this area.
 ? Broker Talks. We believe the Chinese are encourag-
 ing P'yongyang to continue-and even expand-its
 talks with Seoul in the hope that talks will keep
 tensions on the Peninsula manageable. Circumstan-
 tial evidence suggests that Chinese leaders urged
 Kim 11-song to reopen the economic and the sus-
 pended Red Cross talks when he visited Beijing in
 November 1984. The Chinese media, moreover,
 The talks present some problems for Beijing. It has
 resisted direct involvement-which South Korea
 and the United States have sought-and pushed
 tripartite discussions (North Korea, the United
 States, and South Korea), almost certainly because
 this is the way the North wants it. Moreover,
 comments by Chinese officials lead us to conclude
 that the Chinese apparently fear that if they joined
 such talks they would become locked into siding
 with the North, invest some of their prestige in a
 process over which they would have limited control
 and that might end badly, and inject a new conten-
 tious element into their relationship with the United
 States.
 ? Limit Ties to the South. Beijing has consistently
 turned a deaf ear to South Korean requests for a
 more official relationship including trade offices,
 and, in our judgment, can be expected to continue
 this course. In particular, all cross-recognition
 schemes are unacceptable to the North and thus to
 Beijing. Contacts at international gatherings will
 continue-Beijing has already stated it will partici-
 pate in the 1986 Asian Games in Seoul and the
 1988 Olympics-and the Hong Kong channel exists
 for private communications on such issues as hijack-
 ings. Trade will probably continue to grow, but most
 will continue to flow indirectly between the two
 countries via Hong Kong and Japan.
 Two other possible options-significantly increasing
 aid to the North or terminating all economic or
 political contacts with the South-are clearly not in
 the cards. Enmeshed in its own modernization pro-
 gram, Beijing cannot afford to significantly increase
 its contribution to P'yongyang, nor can it compete
 with the Soviets in offering sophisticated military
 hardware, such as MIG-23s. We also believe that
 China is unlikely to cut back at a time when it is
 attempting to expand its markets and gain access to

 Secret
 intermediate-level technology. Beijing may also calcu-
 late that a cooling in its relations with Seoul would
 restore relatively little warmth in its relations with
 P'yongyang.
 Hostage to Others
 For now, the Chinese have been largely relegated to
 advising from the sidelines, and indeed, to a larger
 degree, Chinese strategic interests on the Peninsula
 are, in our view, hostage to the actions of the other
 key players. The Chinese appear to have little direct
 influence, for example, over whether the North de-
 cides to continue talks with the South or reverts to a
 more aggressive approach. The North even recently
 used the Soviets, instead of the Chinese, to convey a
 message requesting US participation in tripartite
 talks. Beijing can do little to influence the various
 North-South talks and can only hope that they evolve
 in a way that contributes to more lasting stability on
 the Peninsula-and that the Soviet Union and United
 States do not take steps there that exacerbate tensions
 or further weaken China's ability to play a larger role.
 Particularly disturbing to the Chinese, we believe, is
 the thought that, for now at least, they must count on
 P'yongyang's stubborn independence and Soviet wari-
 ness of the North's intentions to limit the growth of
 Moscow's influence.
 We believe the Chinese see Washington as holding
 the key to their chances of regaining lost ground in
 P'yongyang
 As an inducement to Washington, the Chinese have
 hinted at the possibility of greater official contact
 with Seoul in exchange. Vague quid pro quos aside,
 we expect China to continue pressing the United
 States and Japan to adopt more flexible policies
 toward North Korea and to urge the United States to
 reconsider participating in tripartite talks, especially
 if the North-South talks make progress. Beijing is
 likely to vent some of its frustration and irritation at
 Washington and Tokyo in the process.
 Potential Setbacks
 China's Korean policy could face major setbacks in
 the coming months. Any one of three broad develop-
 ments would tend to underscore Beijing's relative
 inability to shape events on the Peninsula and prompt
 the Chinese to press Washington harder to show more
 flexibility toward the North.
 The North-South Talks Collapse. This would intensi-
 fy Beijing's concern about stability, especially if the
 North appeared intent on reverting to a policy of
 trying to subvert the South. Beijing would have little
 recourse but to urge P'yongyang to display restraint
 and return to the negotiating table. To mollify the
 North, China might curtail trade and other contacts
 with the South temporarily; at a minimum, it proba-
 bly would try harder to mask them. The Chinese
 probably would also blame Washington for failing to
 provide more support and show greater flexibility, and
 press for US concessions to the North and pressure on
 the South.
 Soviet-North Korean Military Cooperation Increases
 Faster Than Expected. Beijing would be deeply dis-
 turbed by such a development-especially if the
 North granted the Soviets some basing rights in
 exchange for more arms. At a minimum, the Chinese
 probably would express their concerns privately to
 P'yongyang, but they are not in a position to compete
 with the Soviets in providing weaponry. They could
 try to curry favor by becoming more cautious in
 handling both trade with the South and military
 relations with the United States. But the Chinese
 could just as easily decide to signal their displeasure
 by becoming less responsive to new requests by the
 North for aid or oil. We suspect that China's recent
 decision to eliminate the North as a middleman for
 arms sales to Iran-a major foreign exchange earner
 for P'yongyang-may have been meant in part as
 such a signal. The Chinese also could decide to do

 even less to mask their contacts with the South to

 Instability in the North or South. If a crisis occurred
 over the succession in P'yongyang, Beijing probably
 could do little to influence the actual outcome and
 probably would be limited to wooing winners in hopes
 of rebuilding China's standing. China might press the
 United States to be more forthcoming-either in
 contacts with the North or by lowering its profile in
 the South, such as in the Team Spirit Exercise-
 arguing that such actions would help the "moderates"
 There is little, on the other hand, that China could do
 in the event of severe political turmoil in South Korea,
 although China probably would urge the North to act
 with restraint
 The Chinese would certainly
 press Washington to exert a stabilizing influence in a
