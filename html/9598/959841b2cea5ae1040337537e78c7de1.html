 INDIANA LAW STUDENTS AID
 CONSUMER LEGISLATION
 Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, a won-
 derful experiment in education is taking
 place which is exciting, imaginative, and
 significant. The participants are the In-
 diana University Law School and the
 President's Committee on Consumer In-
 terests. The beneficiaries may well be
 all Americans.
 Prof. F. Reed Dickerson has arranged
 with the President's Committee on Con-
 sumer Interests to have his seminar in
 legislation at the law school develop a
 position paper for the President's Com-
 mittee on Consumer Interests to submit
 to any National Commission on Product
 Safety that may be established by the
 Congress.
 This project cannot help but be of
 benefit to all concerned. For the stu-
 dents, it will be an opportunity to do
 legal research on a live and current
 problem. For the Commission that may
 3 For the bakery products group and the individualwheat products the farmers

 marketing certificate to processors, This cost equals the value of the domestic n1 arln l-
 ing certificate received by farmers complying fully with tho wheat program,

 be established, it will be a sorely needed
 piece of research in a field that has been
 relatively neglected. For the President's
 Committee on Consumer Interests, it will
 be at the very least a background paper
 for use in developing their own recom-
 mendations.
 The 15 students involved and Profes-
 sor Dickerson are to be congratulated for
 this public service they are rendering. If
 this project is successful, it will encour-
 age students and professors in a wide
 variety of professional schools to work
 with Government agencies on current
 problems.
 I ask unanimous consent that the
 names of the students, a letter from Mrs.
 Esther Peterson, the President's former
 Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs,
 and a statement of mission describing
 the project be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the items
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:'
 FEBRUARY 21, 1967,
 Prof. F. REED DICKERSON,
 School of Law, Indiana University, Bloom-
 ington,Ind.
 DEAR PROFESsoR DIcizER90N: I can't begin
 to tell you how pleased I am that you are
 willing to allow your seminar in legislation
 at the Indiana University Law School to as-
 sist the President's Committee on Consumer
 Interests in a very important and timely
 project.
 As you know, President Johnson has
 called on the Congress to enact legislation
 establisihng a National Commission on Prod-
 uct Safety. We have every expectation that
 such a Commission will be established, and
 that we will be called upon to make recom-
 mendations. The work of your seminar
 could be invaluable to us in preparing our
 recommendations. In any event, I would
 plan to turn over to the Safety Commission
 the document being prepared by your stu-
 dents.
 I am thoroughly convinced that the rela-
 tionship between our Committee and the
 Indiana School of Law cannot but be of mu-
 tual benefit, and I eagerly await your final

 STATEMENT OF MISSION
 The mission of the Seminar in Legislation
 is to develop a position paper for the Pres-
 ident's Committee on Consumer Interests to
 submit to any National Commission on Prod-
 uct Safety, which may be established by
 Senate Joint Resolution 33.
 The focus of the paper will be "house-
 hold products" other than those excepted by
 section 6 of the Resolution. These are de-
 fined very broadly as "products customarily
 produced or distributed for sale through re-
 tail sales agencies or instrumentalities for
 use by a consumer or any member of his
 family." This Includes all consumer prod-
 ucts except those regulated under the Na-
 tional Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act,
 the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act,
 the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, or
 the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Adver-
 tising Act. However, products regulated tin-
 der the Flammable Fabrics Act are included,
 even though that Act is listed In the current
 text of section 6.
 The first objective Is to discover and de-
 fine the areas within which household prod-
 ucts carry unreasonable hazards of physical
 harm, and to develop criteria for determin-
 ing whether such a product or group of prod-
 uc:s Is sufficiently hazardous to warrant leg-
 islative intervention, '['his involves consid-
 ering not only the seriousness of the threat-
 ened injury and Its Incidence, but also the
 degree of consumer vulnerability. Hazards
 that affect only property or convenience need
 not be considered.
 The second objective is to develop criteria
 for selecting the most feasible approaches
 and sanctions In those instances in which
 legislative intervention appears to be called
 for. Feasibility Includes such factors as cost
 and Inconvenience to the industry con-
 cerned, the need to make the product avail-
 ,!ble, and the source of the hazard, that Is,
 whether it results from faulty design or
 faulty construction.
 i'he third objective Is to study in detail
 the more important household products or
 :;r)ups of household products, Presumably,
 these will be products involving serious phys-
 ical hazards of high Incidence and with re-

 we had had a convention of this sort,
 since article 19 states that-
 Consular officers shall not be subject to
 the jurisdiction of the receiving state in
 matters relating to their official activity.
 The same applies to employees of the
 consular establishment, if they are na-
 tionals of the sending state.
 When it comes to great numbers of
 traveling Americans, too, who want help
 and protection, we obviously should not
 fail them.
 There is the argument against rati-
 fication that this convention might in-
 crem..e espionage on the part of the
 Soviet Union In the United States. I
 do not believe this argument valid. In
 the first place, the United States is an
 open society and the Soviet Union is a
 closed one. Accordingly, a Soviet Union
 tourist in the United States can photo-

 CONSULAR CONVENTION WITH THE
 SOVIET UNION
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Chair lays before the Senate the pend-
 ing business, which the clerk will state.
 The LEGISLATIVE CLERK.  A consular
 convention between the United States of
 America and the Union of Soviet So-
 cialist Republics, together with a proto-
 col relating thereto, signed at Moscow on
 June 1, 1964 (Ex, D, 88th Cong., 2d sess.).
 The Senate proceeded to consider the
 convention.
 Mr. PELL. Mr. President, as a Mem-
 ber of this body and one who, as a vice
 consul for six years, has probably had
 the most personal experience as to why
 the Consular Convention should be rati-
 fled, I strongly urge that the Senate take
 favorable action.
 I can well remember being stationed
 behind the Iron Curtain in Bratislava
 and establishing the consulate general
 there,  I recall the frustration I felt
 when an American citizen was arrested,
 held in jail, and brutally maltreated
 u bile I was denied admittance to see
 him. And here I must add the import-
 ance to a prisoner of some friendly out-
 side contact in order to provide at least
 s)me source of inner strength to a man
 who has been beaten and maltreated to
 make him implicate himself and others
 to the effect-In this case utterly false-
 that he was engaging in espionage for
 iris own Government.
 I also well remember, too, when we
 provided sanctuary for a Jewish em-
 ployee during a minor pogrom. Since a
 consulate does not enjoy any kind of
 immunity, we sought to secure this im-
 munity and give sanctuary by putting up
 the sign "Consular Archives" on our door.
 We adopted the same device another time
 when an employee of our consulate gen-
 eral, who had been cruelly beaten In an
 effort to implicate me and others, was
 released to us a sour, spiritless, listless
 physical wreck. When, after a few days,
 It looked as if he was going to be picked
 tip and abused again, we invited him to
 stay within our building. And. again we
 had to use the device of putting up the
 "Consular Archives" sign on our door.
 This would not have been necessary if
 ber of things; for similar activity in the
 Soviet Union an American citizen would
 be arrested. I have myself undergone
 this experience, having been arrested
 three times by Communist officials be-
 hind, the curtain for actions that would
 not have raised an eyebrow in our own
 country. Actually, what is sauce for the
 goose is sauce for the gander and the
 argument that this convention increases
 the opportunity for Soviet espionage in
 the United States can also be taken the
 other way in that it increases such op-
 portunities for the United States in the
 Soviet Union. And, as I have said, it is
 much harder to secure information in a
 closed society like the Soviet Union than
 it is in an open one like ours. I am sure
 we would all agree that our consulates
 provide information to our Government
 just as do those of the Soviet Union to
 their Government.
 In this regard I would imagine that
 the emotions of Gen. Vladimir Yefimo-
 vich Semichastny, Mr. J. Edgar Hoover's
 opposite number in the Soviet Union,
 must be similar to those of Mr. Hoover
 in connection with the ratification of this
 convention.
 From the viewpoint of espionage then
 it is a "wash" transaction, but with the
 edge to the United States, and from the
 general national interest viewpoint-the
 protection of our citizens, and from a
 viewpoint of eroding the Communist
 monolithic structure, the ratification of
 thi,i convention can serve our country
 very well.
 THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENTS ON FOREIGN AND
 DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD at

 domestic matters, excerpts from Presi-

 sage relative to this matter, and a por-

 New York City relevant to this matter.

 OPENING STATEMENT
 Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
 I have been asked to give a statement
 about the consular convention that's pend-

 ing before the United States Senate and r
 should like to say very briefly that I hope
 the Senate will give its advice and consent to
 the proposed convention with the U.S.S.R.
 I feel very strongly that the ratification of
 this treaty is very much in our national in-
 terest.           I feel this way for two principle
 reasons:
 First we need this treaty to protect the
 18,000 American citizens who each year travel
 from this country to the Soviet Union.
 The convention requires immediate notifi-
 cation to us whenever an American citizen is
 arrested in the Soviet Union and it insures
 our right to visit that citizen within four
 days and as soon thereafter as is desirable.
 We think that we need these rights to help
 protect American citizens. These are, rights
 which the Soviet citizens already have who',
 travel in this country because they are guar-
 anteed by our Constitution,
 Second, the convention does not require
 the opening of consulates in this country or
 in the Soviet Union, It does provide that
 should any such consulates be opened, the
 officials would have diplomatic immunity.
 The Secretary of State informs me that
 no negotiations for consulates are under way,
 and that the most that he can envision in
 the foreseeable future is the opening of one
 consulate in each country to be manned by
 from 10 to 15 people. .
 There are presently 452 Soviet officials in
 the United States that have diplomatic im-
 munity. So if an additional consulate were
 opened, and if another 10 were added to the
 452, M. Hoover has assured me that this
 small increment would raise no problems
 which the F, B, I, cannot effectively and effi-
 ciently deal with.
 In short, I think we very much need this
 convention to protect American interests, to
 protect American citizens abroad.  And in
 my judgment, it raises no problems with
 respect to our national security.
 Therefore, I hope very much that the Sen-
 ate in its wisdom, after full debate, will see
 fit to ratify it.

 STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE EXCERPTS,
 JANUARY 10, 1967
 Our relations with the Soviet Union and
 Eastern Europe are also in transition. We
 have avoided both the acts and the rhetoric
 of the cold war. When we have differed with
 the Soviet Union, we have tried to differ
 quietly and with courtesy. Our objective is
 not to continue the cold war, but to end it.
 We have:
 Signed an agreement at the United Nations
 on the peaceful uses of outer space;
 Agreed to open direct air flights with the
 Soviet Union;
 Removed more than four-hundred non-
 stragetic items from export control;
 Determined that the Export-Import Bank
 can allow commercial credits to Poland, Hun-
 gary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, as well
 as Rumania and Yugoslavia;
 Entered into a cultural agreement with the
 Soviet Union for another two years;
 Agreed with Bulgaria and Hungary to up-
 grade our legations to embassies; and
 Started'- discussions with international
 agencies on ways of increasing contacts with
 Eastern European countries.
 EXCERPT FROM SPEECH OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON
 TO THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDITORIAL
 WRITERS IN NEW YORK CITY ON FRIDAY,
 OCTOBER 7, 1966
 HEALING THE WOUND
 IIII, One great goal of a united West is to
 heal the wound in Europe which now cuts
 East from West and brother from brother.
 That division must be healed peacefully.
 It must be healed with the consent of East-
 ern European countries and the Soviet Union.
 This will happen only as- East and West suc-
 ceed in building a surer foundation of mu-
 tual trust.
 Nothing is more important for peace. We
 must improve the East-West environment in
 order to achieve the unification of Germany
 in the context of a larger, peaceful and pros-
 perous Europe.
 Our task is to achieve a reconciliation with
 the East-a shift from the narrow concept of
 coexistence to the broader vision of peaceful
 engagement.
 Americans are prepared to- do their part.
 Under the last four Presidents our policy
 toward the Soviet Union has been the same.
 Where necessary, we shall defend freedom;
 where possible we shall work with the East
 to build a lasting peace.
 MUST INTENSIFY EFFORTS
 We do not intend to let our differences on
 Viet Nam or elsewhere prevent us from ex-
 ploring all opportunities. We want the So-
 viet Union and the nations of Eastern Eu-
 rope to know. that we had our allies shall go
 step by step with them as far as they are
 willing to advance.
 Let us-both Americans and Europeans-
 intensify our efforts.
 We seek healthy economic and cultural re-
 lations with the Communist states.
 I am asking for early congressional ac-
 tion on the U.S,-Soviet Union Consular
 Agreement.
 We intend to press for legislative authority
 to negotiate trade agreements which could
 extend most-favored-nation tariff treatment
 to European Communist states,
 NEW STEPS
 And I am today announcing these new
 steps:
 -We will reduce export controls on East-
 West trade with respect to hundreds of non-
 strategic items;
 -I have today signed a determination
 that will allow .the Export-Import Bank to
 guarantee commercial credits to four addi-
 tional Eastern European countries-Poland,
 Hungary, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, This
 is good business. And it will help us build
 bridges to Eastern Europe.
 -The secretary of state is reviewing the
 possibility of easing the burden of Polish
 debts to the United States through expendi-
 tures of our Polish currency holdings which
 would  be mutually  beneficial  to both
 countries,
 -The Export-Import Bank is prepared to
 finance American exports for the Soviet.
 Italian Flat auto plant.
 -We are negotiating a civil air agreement
 with the Soviet Union. This will facilitate
 tourism in both directions,
 -This summer the American government
 took additional steps to liberalize travel to
 Communist countries in Europe and Asia,
 We intend to liberalize these rules still
 Agreement on a broad policy to this end
 should be sought in existing Atlantic,
 organs.
 The principles which should govern East-
 West relations are now being discussed in
 the North Atlantic Council.
 The OECD can also play an important part
 in trade and contacts with the East. The
 Western nations can there explore ways of
 inviting the Soviet Union and the Eastern
 European countries to cooperate in tasks of
 common interest and common benefit.
 Hand-in-hand with these steps to increase
 East-West ties must go measures to remove
 territorial and border disputes as a source
 of friction in Europe. The Atlantic nations
 oppose the use of force to change existing
 frontiers,
 The maintenance of old enmities is not in
 anyone's interest. Our aim is a true Euro-
 pean reconciliation, We must make this
 clear to the East.
 Further, it is our policy to avoid the
 spread of national nuclear programs-in Eu-
 rope and elsewhere.
 SOVIET TROOP CUTBACKS
 That is why we shall persevere in efforts
 to reach an agreement banning the prolifera-
 tion of nuclear weapons.
 We seek a stable military situation in
 Europe-one in which tensions can be low-
 ered.
 To this end, the United States will con-
 tinue to play its part in effective Western
 deterrence. To weaken that deterrence might
 create temptations and endanger peace.
 The Atlantic allies will continue together
 to study what strength NATO needs, in light
 of changing technology and the current
 threat.
 Reduction of Soviet forces in Central
 Europe would, of course, affect the extent of
 the threat.
 If changing circumstances should lead to a
 gradual and balanced revision in force levels
 on both sides, the revision could-together
 with the other steps that I have mentioned-
 help gradually to shape a new political en-
 vironment.
 A LONG PROCESS
 The building of true peace and reconcilia-
 tion in Europe will be a long process.
 ? The bonds between the United States and
 its Atlantic partners provide the strength
 on which the world's security depends. Our
 interdependence is complete.
 Our goal, in Europe and elsewhere, is a
 just and secure peace. It can most surely
 be achieved by common action. To this end,
 I pledge America's best efforts:
 -to achieve new thrust for the Alliance;
 -to support movement toward Western
 European unity;
 -and to bring about a far-reaching im-
 provement in relations between East and
 West.
 Our object is to end the bitter legacy of
 World War II,
 Success will bring the day closer when we
 have fully secured the peace in Europe, and
 in the world,

 CONSULAR CONVENTION WITH THE
 SOVIET UNION
 The Senate resumed the consideration
 of the Consular Convention between the
 United States of America and the Union
 of Soviet Socialist Republics, together
 with a protocol relating thereto, signed
 at Moscow on June 1, 1964 (Ex. D, 88th
 Cong., 2d sess.).
 Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, the
 Senate is engaged in a discussion over
 whether to give Its "advice and consent"
 that the President enter into a consular
 convention or treaty with the Soviet
 Union,  That is the technical subject
 before us.
 In reality, however, we are debating
 and considering a larger series of related
 proposals going far beyond a document
 which seeks to establish ground rules for
 such consulates as may be established
 in the respective countries by authority
 which resides in sources other than this
 treaty.
 This series of proposals includes many
 aspects of our foreign and commercial
 trade policies with the Soviet Union.
 Among them are an East-West trade bill:
 a civil air agreement for direct air flights
 between the Soviet Union and the United
 States; virtual abolition of export con-
 trols on East-West trade on several hun-
 dreds of so-called nonstrategic itemsf
 extending and guaranteeing credits to
 several East European Communist coun-
 tries; financing American exports for the
 Soviet-Italian Flat auto plant to be con-
 structed in Russia.
 Further treaties are also contemplated
 between the Soviet Union and the United
 States, such as peaceful uses of space
 activities and space mechanisms, the
 nonproliferation of nuclear weapons,
 and disarmament.
 This wider scope of major, radical
 changes in our foreign policy and Inter-
 national relations has been spelled out in
 detail by the President a number of
 times.
 First, perhaps, in this package form,
 where it received its widest publicity,
 was the New York meeting of the Inter-
 rational Conference of Editorial Writers
 in October 1966.
 Then there was reference to It in the
 state of the Union message of the Presi-
 dent.
 The third source was a number of oc-
 casions in news conferences in less
 formal ways when the President referred
 to the process of building bridges be-
 i ween the United States and the U.S.S.R.
 Another source for detailing and out-
 lining the package, as It is sometimes
 called, has been the hearings before the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE        March 13, 1967
 No one has asserted to the contrary,
 on the floor of this Chamber or else-
 where, that we are engaged in a series
 of related subjects which deal with
 fundamental  relations  between  the
 United States and the Soviet Union.
 It is the position of this Senator that
 the Congress, and especially the Senate,
 should not act on this program in a
 fragmentary way. A piecemeal treat-
 ment does not befit a subject of this
 importance.
 This debate, in its overall aspects, is
 nog between proponents and opponents
 of the consular treaty. It is, and should
 be. rather, a debate between those who
 favor building bridges between East and
 West and between the United States and
 the Soviet Union and those who oppose
 building bridges at this time.
 Advocates of the Consular Treaty are
 heard to say and to repeat frequently
 that the reason for their desire to ratify
 it is that they want to end the cold war,
 and no progress can be made toward this
 goal if we persist in a hostile, suspicious,
 adverse posture toward the Soviet Union.
 Hence, It is argued by the proponents
 that if this treaty will result In even a
 small gain in advancing the cause of
 peace, it should be ratified.
 Mr. President, there is no one who
 more fervently or more earnestly wishes
 an end of the cold war than this speaker.
 But to base action on hopes and prayers
 for peace or for termination of the cold
 war without further inquiry Is a case of
 hopeless and harmful wishful thinking,
 It takes action by two great nations to
 bring about an end to the cold war. No
 one knows this better than the President,
 because of his Inability to get the enemy
 in our Vietnam war even to agree to
 sit down and talk about peace, Good-
 ness knows he has tried for a long time,
 and persistently, to bring about that re-
 sult.
 Approval by the Senate of the Con-
 sular Treaty would endow the Soviet
 Union with a new prestige and added
 respectability In the eyes of the world.
 it would cause dismay In the hearts and
 minds of many nations and of many mil-
 lions of people, Including millions of
 Americans.
 Before taking this step, It would be
 most advisable to determine the likeli-
 hood of the Soviet Union's making some
 small effort which could be considered
 effective to bring the cold war to an end,
 or even slow It down a little, or ameli-
 orate it to some degree,
 The record, however, plainly shows
 that the Soviet Union has rejected any
 promise to seek such a goal.
 Mr. President, the President of the
 United States addressed the National
 Conference of Editorial Writers in New
 York City on October 7 of last year.
 There were three principal sections to his
 speech. The third part bore upon the
 subject of strengthening ties with the
 East, "to quicken progress in East-West
 relations."
 It was there that President Johnson
 first set out, in comprehensive fashion,
 his program of bridge-building from the
 United States to Eastern Europe.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that there be printed in the RecoRD
 at this point an excerpt from the Weekly
 Compilation of Presidential Documents
 for October 10, 1966, as found on page
 1426 :hereof.
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 was crdered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 intensity our efforts.

 relations with the Communist states.

 Mr, HRUSKA. The passage referred
 to, Mr. President, includes those related
 subjects which I believe to be a part of
 the entire package of proposals which
 deal with a major and radical change in
 our foreign policy, particularly toward
 the Soviet Union. This speech was the
 President's bid to help end the cold war.
 The gesture is a good one. How was it
 received by the one other nation whose
 cooperation and acceptance of such a
 bid, or even consideration of such a bid,
 is necessary?
 There was quick response: not from
 the Soviet Union government channels,
 Mr. President, but from a higher author-
 ity, the Communist Party which is the
 real ruler of the Soviet Union. The
 formal government channels are only a
 part of the organization through which
 the party rules the nation.
 The New York Times of October 16,
 1966, reported the remarks of Leonid I.

 that closer Soviet-United States cooperation
 was possible despite tensions over the war in
 Vietnam.
 The United States must stop bombing
 North Vietnam and end its "aggression" be-
 fore relations can be improved, the Soviet
 leader declared.
 So, in response to President Johnson's
 list of proposals to improve relations
 with the Soviet Union in connection with
 the cold war, which has existed now for
 some 20 years, there was an outright
 rejection of any possibility of progress in
 that direction without accepting what
 the Soviet Union lays down as a prior
 necessity-the stopping of bombing of
 North Vietnam and the ending of
 aggression by the U.S. forces in that
 land.
 Another portion of the news story
 reads as follows:
 In his rejection of Mr. Johnson's appeal
 for steps to improve relations, Mr. Brezhnev
 said:
 "We have declared many times that if the
 United States wants to develop mutually
 beneficial relations with the Soviet Union-
 in principle, we also would like this-then
 it is necessary to clear major obstacles from
 the path. The piratical bombing attacks
 against a socialist country, the Democratic
 Republic of Vietnam, must be halted and the
 aggression against the Vietnamese people
 stopped."
 Mr. Brezhnev added as a further condi-
 tion:
 "The sovereignty and territorial inviolabil-
 ity of other countries must be respected, not
 just in words but in deeds."
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed at this point in the
 RECORD the text of the article to which I
 have referred, entitled "Soviet Calls
 United States `Deluded' in Hope for New
 Ties Now," written by Raymond H. An-
 derson and published in the New York
 Times of October 16, 1966.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the New York Times, Oct. 16, 1966]
 SOVIET  CALLS  U.S.  DELUDED  IN  HOPE  FOR
 NEW TIES NOW-BREZHNEV REBUFFS JOHN-
 SON'S BID FOR COOPERATION WHILE VIETNAM
 WAR GOES ON-BLOC PARLEY EXPEcTED-
 EAST EUROPE'S LEADERS SAID To PLAN A CO-
 ORDINATION OF HARDER LINE ON CHINA
 (By Raymond H. Anderson)
 Moscow, Oct. 15.-Leonid 1. Brezhnev, the
 Soviet Communist party leader, rebuffed to-
 day as "a strange and persistent delusion"
 the hope expressed by President Johnson
 that closer Soviet-United States cooperation
 was possible despite tensions over the war in
 Vietnam.
 The United States must stop bombing
 North Vietnam and end its "aggression" be-
 fore relations can be improved, the Soviet
 leader declared.
 Mr. Brezhnev's rejection was the first pub-
 lic statement by the Kremlin leadership in
 response to Mr. Johnson's appeal, made in a
 speech in New York eight days ago. Pravda,
 the Communist party newspaper, indicated
 last Sunday that the ending of the bombing
 raids was Moscow's major preliminary condi-
 tion for any favorable responses to the Presi-
 dent's overture.
 The rebuff to President Johnson, made in
 a speech at a Soviet-Polish friendship meet-
 ing, came amid indication of an impending
 gathering of Soviet-bloc leaders here.  Ac-
 cording to East European sources, the meet-
 ing would discuss steps to coordinate harder
 policy against China, which is being de-
 nounced for obstructing Soviet-bloc assist.
 OTHERS DUE IN FEW DAYS
 The two visiting Polish leaders, Vladyslaw
 Gomulka, the party chief, and Premier Josef
 Cyrankiewicz, are delaying their return to
 Warsaw. Tass, the Soviet press agency, re-
 ported that Janos Kadar, the Hungarian
 party chief, was enroute to Moscow with
 Premier Gyula Kal,lai and other Hungarian
 officials.
 The leaders of East Germany, Rumania,
 Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria are said to be
 planning to come to Moscow within a :Pew
 days.
 Besides discussing the problems confront-
 ing the Soviet bloc as a result of China's
 attitudes, the leaders are expected to deal
 with President Johnson's overtures for an
 East-West reconciliation.
 In his rejection of Mr. Johnson's appeal
 for steps to improve relations, Mr. Brezhnev
 said:
 "We have declared many times that if the
 United States wants to develop mutually
 beneficial relations with the Soviet Union-
 in principle, we also would like this-then it
 is necessary to clear major obstacles from
 the path.  The piratical bombing attacks
 against a socialist country, the Democratic
 Republic of Vietnam, must be halted and
 the aggression against the Vietnamese people
 stopped."
 Mr. Brezhnev added as a further condition:
 "The sovereignty and territorial inviolabil-
 ity.of other countries must be respected, not
 just in words, but in deeds."
 Mr. Gomulka also spoke at. the meeting,
 which was held in the Kremlin's Palace of
 Congresses.
 He assailed the United States intervention
 in the Vietnamese war and echoed :Mr.
 Brezhnev's declaration that improved United
 States relations with Eastern Europe were
 impossible while the war continued.
 "An unconditional end of the bombing of
 the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by
 American aircraft must be the primary pre-
 liminary condition for embarking on the
 path of seeking a political solution of the
 Vietnam problem," the Polish leader con-
 tinued.
 Commenting Thursday on the demand for
 an end of the bombing raids, President John-
 son said: "If the aggressor will pause, we will
 pause."
 CHINESE POLICY ASSAILED

 confuse them," Mr. Brezhnev said, "The pol-
 icies clearly are helpful to the imperialists.
 It is not without reason that their propa-
 ganda seizes upon the events taking place in
 China."
 Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, I sub-
 mit that in view of this emphatic and
 almost instantaneous response to the
 "building bridges" speech of the Presi-
 dent in October of 1966, the outlook is
 not very bright for the ratification of
 this treaty in any way to lessen tensions
 between these two nations. In fact, it
 is nonexistent. The idea is rejected.
 I wonder sometimes if those who say
 "We want to end the cold war, and there-
 fore we will do anything'the enemy asks,
 virtually, to gain that end," would in-
 clude the cessation of bombing in North
 Vietnam and the ending of aggression, as
 it is viewed by the Russians and by the
 Vietnamese forces in Vietnam. I wonder
 if there is a parallel there to the ideas
 and wishes of those who say, "We want
 to end the hostilities in Vietnam," and
 who would be willing to do so at the price
 of complying with and abiding by the
 conditions which either the Soviet Union
 or the North Vietnamese would dictate.
 More recent affirmations in this gen-
 eral area are to be found in declarations
 of the Soviet leaders in connection with
 celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
 great October Revolution of 1917.
 What I have said so far has to do with
 the groundwork for any lessening of ten-
 sions and the minimum chance-in fact,
 the nonexisting probability-of such les-
 sening of tensions on the basis of what
 the Soviet Union has declared and what
 it has said.
 However, there is another class of
 arguments and reasons and sources to
 which we can repair if we want to ex-
 amine the matter of deeds on their part.
 They have been mentioned here in the
 Senate Chamber during the course of the
 current debate.
 Among those is the fact that with in-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 we will be given another piece, the Open
 Space Treaty. If we approve this treaty,
 then in the administration's logic, we
 surely could not reject the East-West
 trade legislation.
 [i we accede to this course, we will
 have worked a major change in our for-
 eign policy posture without ever having
 the opportunity to assess the effects of
 the parts in relation to the whole. Com-
 monsense dictates that this is not a
 prudent course to follow in a matter of
 this importance.
 What I am urging is not blind obstruc-
 tionism. All that is asked is that if we
 are to consider a detente with the Com-
 munists. Let us carefully examine all
 facets of the question in a proper per-
 spective.
 The first premise in this dialog. and
 the one on which all others must stand
 or fall, is the belief in some quarters that
 we are dealing with a "new" Communist.
 The administration has asked us to con-
 cede this point as though it were a tru-
 ism.
 Mr. President, the facts argue that this
 point can be legitimately contested.
 [1 is a midwestern belief that if you are
 going to buy a horse, you must look at
 the animal. In seeking information re-
 garding the transaction you "get it from
 the horse's mouth." In dealing with the
 Communists, we might profitably look to
 both their internal writings and their
 actions based on these words.
 This consideration of the changing
 nature of communism Is crucial in deter-
 mining our relations with the whole
 Communist-controlled world. Is it cor-
 rect that we should, as one Kremlinolo-
 gist, former Ambassador George Ken-
 non, asserted recently :
 fiilnk about Russia as simply another
 great power, with its own Interests and con-
 cerns, often necessarily In conflict with our
 own, but not tragically so-a power different
 in many respects, but perhaps no longer In
 essential ones from what Russia would have
 been, had there been no Communist Revolu-
 tion in that country 50 years ago.
 Or is this opinion a product of wishful
 thinking, a widespread weakness of the
 free, open society, often adroitly ex-
 ploited by the Communists themselves?
 Is it. in other words, a false assumption,
 which, ultimately, will lead to a disas-
 trous failure of our foreign policy?
 A glance through the leading United
 States and foreign newspapers over the
 last. 50 years will establish first of all the
 fact that this "evolution of communism"
 theory is nothing new. Every important
 change within the Soviet ruling appara-
 tus was, curiously enough, always accom-
 partied by speculations In the West about
 significant changes in the Communist
 ideological outlook.
 After the disaster of the civil war and
 of the so-called War Communism in 1921,
 Lenin announced the new economic pol-
 icy-NEP-a temporary concession to
 private enterprise of small industry and
 farming, reported in the New York Times
 under a headline: "Lenin Has Thrown
 Communism Overboard." After Lenin's
 death the belief that communism had
 been abandoned had been further con-
 firmed by events resulting from the
 struggle for power between Lenin's suc-
 cessors, Stalin and Trotsky. The NEP
 was continued and even expanded, and
 Stalin called for moderation and collec-
 tive leadership. He even rejected pro-
 posals for Trotsky's expulsion from the
 Party.
 The free world reaction to these events
 was again mirrored in the press. The
 New York Times described the promised
 reforms as the "greatest step away from
 Marxism since the creation of the Bol-
 shevik regime." Great importance was
 at, 'ached to promises as coming from
 Stalin, who is the Communist Party chief
 and successor to the power formerly held
 by Lenin.  The London Daily Express
 called these steps the greatest-
 On the road away from militant Commu-
 isni. By 1927 Stalin adopted Trotsky's agrar-
 ian policy of collectivization, which resulted
 in the loss of 10 million lives by murder and
 famine and "liquidation of well-to-do peas-
 ants (kulaksi as a class.
 After this irreversible trend toward
 liberalization was completed by forcing
 the peasant to accept the collective-farm
 system. new concessions were made in
 the field of civil rights. In 1936 a new
 Constitution was promulgated, described
 by Stalin as "the only thoroughly demo-
 cratic Constitution In the world," which
 guaranteed all immaginable rights of So-
 viet citizens. There was so much talk
 abroad about the new departure from
 Bolshevism that even Stalin complained:
 The fourth group of critics attacking the
 Draft of the new constitution describes It
 as a "swing to the right," as "renunciation
 of the dictatorship of the proletariat," as
 "liquidation of the Bolshevik regime."
 After scornfully mentioning some Pol-
 ish and American newspapers which dis-
 played a particular zeal in this respect,
 Stalin frankly stated:
 I must admit that the Constitutional Draft
 really does leave in force the regime of the
 dictatorship of the working class and also
 leaves unchanged the present position of
 the Communist Party.
 As for the international aspects of
 communism. Stalin, though himself an
 internationalist, has been credited with
 restoring national interest as a primary
 motivation of Soviet policy. The post-
 World War II spread of communism in
 Eastern Europe and Asia shows the
 doubtful value of this illusion of change.
 The greatest wave as yet of specula-
 tions about change, softening of the
 Communists hit the free world after Stal-
 in's death in 1953. A succession of Soviet
 leaders, Malenkov, Khrushchev, and now
 Brezhnev. representing the new collec-
 tive leadership, have been blaming Sta-
 lin's cult of personality for the brutal ex-
 cesses of that period and promising
 internal liberalization and peaceful co-
 existence with the outside world.
 This did not prevent Khrushchev from
 unconstitutionally violating the collective
 farm statute in order to consolidate the
 existing 252,000 collective farms into
 97,000 giant ones, thus strengthening the
 Communist Party control over the peas-
 antry.  This "liberal" reform affected
 millions of peasants by depriving them
 of or reducing their minute private plots,
 until that time their main source of sub-
 sistence.  Neither did his incessant
 preaching of peaceful coexistence stop
 t1Iai 'h 1,J), 1967
 him from crushing the Hungarian revolt,
 provoking the Cuban crisis, and openly
 supporting aggression-wars of national
 liberation-from Vietnam to Angola.
 The religious persecution during the
 collective leadership became even more
 oppressive, according to all available in-
 formation, than under Stalin, although
 it may now be carried out by administra-
 tive coercion and persuasion rather than
 by o;)en burning of churches and killing
 of priests.
 This sketchy survey of the changes
 and evolution of communism clearly
 demonstrates that during the 50 years
 of existence of the Communist system
 every period of tactical relaxation has
 been followed by a new period of repres-
 sion.
 If this were not sufficiently evident
 from the statements of the Communists
 themselves, it has been proven by ex-
 perience. Ever since their first seizure of
 power, the use of intermittent soft poli-
 cies and concessions has been as much a
 deliberate part of the Communists' in-
 ternal policy as the usc of terror and
 repression, and together with the inher-
 ent weakness of their system, has been
 evoking perennial prophesies of their
 gradual evolution or even early demise.
 Just as they have always been voicing
 their intention of abandoning their aims
 of world revolution and renouncing the
 use of violence against the free nations,
 so have they also allegedly been termi-
 nating every form of domestic oppres-
 sion, democratizing their dictatorial re-
 gim(? and even discarding the harsh and
 impractical economic tleories of strict
 Marxist communism. However, each
 Soviet retreat was only introduced to
 insure the ultimate victory of socialism.
 Let us go back to the Consular Treaty.
 Despite the official line of the admini-
 stracion that the main :reason for con-
 cluding the Convention is our concern
 for ;he safety of U.S. citizens travelling
 in the U.S.S.R., some columnists grasped
 better the motives behind the maneuvres
 to induce the Senate to ratify the Con-
 vention.
 R.chard Wilson of the Cowles Publica-
 tion., obviously impressed by certain wit-
 nesses before the Senate Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee, ardent advocates of the
 changed communism theory, grasped the
 real meaning of the convention in his
 column of February 1961, entitled "Con-
 sular Pact Contains Symbolic Import-
 ance." Its ratification by the U.S. Sen-
 ate will amount to sanctioning the ad-
 ministration's assumption of a, basic
 change in the Soviet world outlook, their
 presumed abandonment of world revolu-
 tionary aims and the possibility of West-
 ern accommodation with the Commu-
 nist-controlled States. In Mr. Wilson's
 words:
 The U.S. relationship 0 this change is
 what Is at issue in Senate -atiflcation of the
 Comular Treaty. The issue divides those
 who wish to build bridges to the Soviet
 Union and those who do n)t. If the Senate
 gets across this particular bridge, it will un-
 doubtedly build additional ones in the form
 of expansion of East-West trade relations,
 and ratification of the outer-space treaty.
 A great many Senators are bothered that
 these bridges should be built while in other
 matters we continue to collide head-on with

 peace coexistence between states with
 different social systems, misunderstood
 as to its class struggle implications, also
 has helped In creating the general con-
 fusion.
 A reading of some of the documents
 mentioned, all available in English, will
 easily reveal that whether transition to
 socialism will be violent or nonviolent
 depends on the conditions in each coun-
 try.
 l>perience  confirms  that  the  ruling
 classes never relinquish power voluntarily.
 In tills case the degree of bitterness and the
 forms of class struggle will depend not so
 much on the proletariat as on the resistance
 put up by the reactionary circles to the will
 of the overwhelming majority of the people.
 Since in the eyes of the Communists
 the will of the people in every capitalist
 country is represented by its vanguard,
 the local Communist Party, every resist-
 ance of the ruling classes-the capitalist
 or reactionary circles-to the demands
 of Communists will lead inevitably to
 revolutionary violence and ultimately to
 the most acute form of class struggle,
 the civil war. It is also well to remember
 that the old local civil war is largely a
 thing of the past. In the future every
 civil war unleashed by Communists and
 their sympathizers will become inevi-
 tably an international civil war, in which
 the foreign Communists are bound by
 the principle of proletarian interna-
 tionalism to support the local ones.
 With regard to the split, it has not pre-
 vented both the Soviet and Chinese
 Communists from attending and par-
 ticipating actively in the so-called Tri-
 continental Conference in Havana in
 January 1966, despite clashes between
 the two delegations.
 More than 500 representatives of 79
 Communist Parties and national libera-
 tion movements met to map out a
 coordinated strategy for the under-
 developed world. The meeting issued a
 series of declarations and resolutions
 pledging an intensification of revolu-
 tionary warfare, and established a mill-
 tary  directorate to coordinate the
 various offensives.
 Mr. President, it is difficult to conceive
 uhy this very important and significant
 tricontinental conference in Havana
 has received so little attention in the
 free world. It certainly was a highly
 significant conference.  It made con-
 crete recommendations. These recom-
 mendations are being carried out as rap-
 idly and as effectively as possible; yet,
 we must resort to an analysis of that
 conference such as that which was given
 to the subject by J. Edgar Hoover in
 testifying In the other body not too long
 ago, and also the work done by the In-
 ternal Security Subcommittee of the
 Judiciary Committee of the Senate, of
 which I am a member.
 and Cuba and their satellites to extend their
 power and Influence in the free world, to
 exploit legitimate needs, to create discord and
 sow discontent and strtfe-ln order to seek
 the violent overthrow of governments in this
 hemisphere and to supplant them with Com-
 munist dictatorial regimes, subservient to
 Soviet and Chinese Communist Imperialism.
 It was reported In the press-New
 York Times, February 17, 1965-that at
 least one South American Government
 launched a formal protest against the
 dual position of the Soviet Government:
 calling for armed revolution and yet
 seeking to gain influence with the gov-
 eriuments that are to be overthrown.
 The Uruguayan Government summoned
 the Soviet ambassador In Montevideo to
 the Foreign Ministry to explain the
 statement made by the Soviet delegate,
 Rashidov who said in his lengthy speech
 that,-
 Throughout the course of its history, the
 Soviet Union, following the behest of the
 great Lenin, has been sacredly fulfilling Its
 international duty. giving full-scale support
 to the peoples struggling against colonialism
 and Imperialism for their national and so-
 cial liberation.  The peoples rising In the
 heroic struggle against imperialism, no mat-
 ter what corner of the earth this may take
 place, may be certain that the Soviet people
 will always be on their side.
 From our point of view it is Interest-
 ing to note that he also expressed soli-
 darity with the struggle of the people of
 Puerto Rico.
 The Soviet ambassador's answer is
 available in summary in the two-volume
 Report on the Trccontinental Confer-
 ence prepared by the OAS.
 The Soviet disclaimer, couched in very
 arrogant language, denied the Soviet
 Government's participation In the Con-
 ference and based its denial on the fact
 that the Soviet delegation was composed
 of representatives of Soviet "social-or
 better, public-organizations and not of
 the Soviet Government." This is an old
 game played by the Communists, which
 unfortunately has often not been prop-
 erly understood and countered by the
 non-Communists States.
 We often speak, as did Secretary Rusk
 Mien testifying about the Consular Con-
 vention with the U.S.S.R., about "differ-
 ent systems of law, even of dissimilar
 systems of government."  However, it
 may well be that It is our lack of under-
 standing of the true nature of the Soviet
 state itself, or of any Communist-con-
 trolled state, for that matter, which
 makes it possible for the Soviet Govern-
 ment to use that kind of primitive, trans-
 parent disclaimer, as it did in the case
 of the Uruguayan protest, and many
 times before, as for instance, in counter-
 ing our protests against the Comintern
 activities in the 1930's.
 This lack of understanding of the na-
 ture of the Communist-controlled state
 is caused, first of all, by the fact that
 The Soviet delegate, Sharaf R. Rashi- most political scientists in studying it

 American States put it:                 Even a superficial investigation of the
 'rhis conference was a most blatant and Soviet Constitution of 1936 will discover
 open effort by the USSR, Communist China some formal resemblance between the
 Soviet state machinery and that of a
 Western-type democratic state. There is

 ency There is the Council of Ministers,
 the highest executive and administrative
 organ of the U.S.S.R. state power-ar-
 ticle 64.
 There is a separate Judiciary, with
 "independent judges, subject only to
 Law"-article 12. Chapter X contains
 what; could superficially be defined as a
 bill of rights: "Basic rights and duties of
 citizens."  There, however, the formal
 resemblance ends.
 In order truly to grasp the nature of a
 Communist-controlled state, we must re-
 sort to its analysis from the point of
 view of a theory of staba and law, ours
 as well as the Marxist-Leninist. We be-
 lieve that, to use Burl':e's well-known
 definition:
 A state Is a necessary, natural Institu-
 tion, founded In the social nature of man.
 Marx, Engels, and e specially Lenin,
 proceeding from the class viewpoint, saw
 in every state an organization serving
 the ruling class. Logica;ly, then, the so-
 cialist proletarian state is "only a weap-
 on of the proletariat in the class strug-
 gle. A special cudgel, vier, de plus-" As the
 bourgeois state is believed by the Com-
 murdsts to be a dictatorship of the bour-
 geoi.vie, the proletarian--socialist-state
 must exercise the dictatorship of its rul-
 ing class, that is, the proletariat or work-
 ing class.
 Tne doctrine of the dictatorship of the
 worting class has since been the corner-
 store of Marxist-Leninist state theory
 and practice. Soviet university text-
 books on the theory of state and law,
 elaborating on this doctrine, explain
 tha';-
 The dictatorship of the proletariat con-
 sidered as mechanism appaars as a complex
 syste=m consisting of a sum total of "levers"
 and "transmission belts" tend "the directive
 fora:," which is the [Communist] Party.
 It, is further explained that-
 The Soviets with their executive machinery
 represent such levers and transmission belts;
 also,  labor  unions,  cooperatives  of  all
 kinds, including collective farms, the Com-
 munist  youth  organization  (Komsomol)
 numerous voluntary associations (for sport,
 defense, learning, etc.), which as a whole
 form the mechanism of tae dictatorship of
 the proletariat.
 Thus, the state organs, the govern-
 ment in the broad sense of the word,
 are only transmission belts, or levers,
 used by the Communist Party to exercise
 its guidance, to direct, rule the so-called
 Socialist state. This has been reaffirmed
 as a constitutional principle in article
 126, which states:
 The most active and politically conscious
 in the ranks of the worki.ig class and other
 strata of toilers shall unite in the Com-
 munist Party, which Is the vanguard of the
 toilers In their struggle i.o strengthen and
 dev:lop the socialist system, and the direc-
 tire body of all organizations and societies
 of i:oilers, both public and governmental.
 This gives the Communist Party an
 indisputable monopoly of power and
 control in every Communist-controlled
 stave, together with the monopoly of
 nomination of candidates in an election.

 March 13, 1967        CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 In the light of this analysis, one must
 reach the conclusion that the Soviet
 Communist leadership has a very low
 opinion of our intelligence and our un-
 derstanding of the workings of their so-
 called state, if they seriously disclaim
 any Soviet Government participation in
 the Tricontinental Conference in Ha-
 vana by asserting that the head of the
 Soviet delegation, Sharif R. Rashidov,
 candidate-member of the politburo of
 the central committee of the Commu-
 nist Party of the Soviet Union, which
 places him among the 19 most important
 apparatchiks in the U.S.S.R., repre-
 sented only public-social-organiza-
 tions and not the government.
 The Communist Party itself is not an
 ordinary political party.  It is a party
 of a new type, as the Communists them-
 selves have correctly defined it. - Its
 novelty consists in the unique features
 of its historical mission as a substitute
 for the state and state apparatus and
 in the originality of its internal struc-
 ture. On one hand, it is a close hier-
 archial organization with a regular ap-
 paratus; on the other, it is an open mass
 party with a membership of many mil-
 lions. Therefore, the party elite, the
 apparatchiks, virtually represent a party
 within a party.
 The Communist Party is not simply
 the sole ruling state party; it is not even
 a state within a state. It. is the state,
 but a new type of state, according to the
 Communist doctrine.  Its novelty lies
 in the fact that the hierarchy of official
 state legislative organs is. only the
 executive-administrative machinery for
 carrying out the decisions and instruc-
 tions of a parallel hierarchy of formal
 executive party organs. A modern Com-
 munist state can exist without its official
 state apparatus, but it cannot exist with-
 out its party apparatus. Relationships
 between the party apparatus and the
 state apparatus are riot those of coordi-
 nation but of subordination; this in itself
 eliminates dualism in rule. Lenin des-
 troyed Russia's old state organization in
 order to replace it with his new party
 machine. This machine was the system
 of partocracy, as it has been very aptly
 defined in a recent monograph, "The
 Communist Party Apparatus."
 A Communist Party is a party of a
 new type also because of its international
 class character. The new Program of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union of
 1961 describes it as-
 An inseparable part of the International
 Communist and Working-Class Movement.
 The  tried  and  tested  Marxist-Leninist
 principles of the proletarian internationalism
 will continue to be inviolable principles that
 the Party will follow undeviatingly.  The
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union will
 continue to strengthen the unity of the in-
 ternational Communist movement, to de-
 velop fraternal ties with all the Communist
 and Workers' Parties and to coordinate its
 actions with all the detachments of the
 World Communist Movement for the joint
 struggle against the danger of a new world
 war, for the interests of the working people
 for peace, democracy and socialism,
 There is a school of thought which
 denies, at present, any possibility of re-
 storing the former cohesion of the Inter-
 national Communist Movement.  As
 evidence they list the Sino-Soviet rift,
 the rifts between the U.S.S.R. and the
 European Communist-controlled states,
 frictions due to supposedly increasing
 nationalism in those states, and so forth.
 I am afraid we may be ordering the
 funeral before the patient is dead. It is
 for this reason that this Senator again
 urges the Members of the Senate to insist
 that we be given the opportunity to con-
 sider the entire package, both treaties
 and trade legislation, intact rather than
 on a piecemeal basis.
 Mr. President, by way of summary, I
 should like to suggest again that as
 much as anyone would want to see the
 end of the cold war, as much as anyone
 would want to lessen the thrust and the
 brutality of the cold war, and the hot
 war in which we are engaged in Vietnam,
 ratification of this treay simply cannot
 be based upon the hypothesis or the
 proposition that there is a "new commu-
 nism," or that there is a new partner-
 ship in the process of formation between
 the United States of America and the
 U.S.S.R.
 There is simply nothing to indicate
 that the Iron Curtain is being formed
 into an open door. If anything, there
 is reason after reason to conclude, from
 overt acts as well as from well defined
 and definite statements, and declara-
 tions by Communist leaders, that they
 do not mean to let up for one moment
 in that position and posture which has
 made it necessary for this country to
 have entered into the cold war in the
 first place, and to have continued it since
 that time-about 20 years ago,
 Certainly, there is nothing to indicate
 that they are going to abate one iota in
 their participation in the hot war in Viet-
 nam. And, we are engaged in a hot war
 with the Soviet Union there because they
 are supplying the. armaments, the muni-
 tions, the supplies, and the war materiel
 without which the war would come to
 an early and definite end if delivery of
 those articles of war were suspended or
 ceased by the Soviet Union.
 Mr. President, it is for these reasons
 that I urge two things: One, that the
 Senate not, at this time, advise and con-
 sent to the Consular Treaty before it.
 Two, that the Senate should, as a matter
 of fact, insist upon a discussion of all the
 related subjects in this proposed major
 and radical change in our foreign policy
 before disposing of any of the component
 parts thereof.
 It is only from that overall perspective
 that we will be able to render a decision
 which will be wise, and judicious.
 It is my hope that we will be able to
 sustain the position of a complete, over-
 all discussion when the matter before us
 comes up for final disposition.
 Mr. President, I yield the floor.
 Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. HRUSKA. I yield,
 Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, what
 the Senator says is very significant in
 the whole discussion that we are having
 about the desirability and undesirability
 of ratifying the consular treaty with
 Russia at this time of war. Admittedly
 she has become the arsenal of Hanoi and
 the sole source of military weaponry of
 S 3653
 modern. design which is being used to
 continue the war there and is making it
 more difficult to obtain peace. It cer-
 tainly  is  escalating our American
 casualties.
 It is certainly true also that deeds
 speak louder than words.
 The Senator alluded to the fact that
 in the RECORD of Friday, March 10, I
 placed in the RECORD for public scrutiny
 for the first time a list of the supplies
 now available for shipment to Russia
 in unlimited numbers and without
 license.
 I had this list printed in the RECORD
 because we have heard them described
 as nonstrategic and as peaceful goods.
 The facts are now before the public that
 the weapons are going from Russia to
 Hanoi.
 I thought it would be illuminating to
 note just what kind of American ship-
 ments have been made eligible to the
 Russians by President Johnson's ill-
 advised and unprecedented Executive
 order of October 12, 1966.
 That astonishing but revealing list
 will be found beginning on page S3543 of
 the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for March 10,
 and extending to page 53547.
 I think it is illuminating reading for
 the country, and I think it should be
 must reading for every Senator before he
 votes on the treaty.
 The Senator is aware that it was on
 October 12, 1966, that by Executive order
 President Johnson opened up these ex-
 ports in trade to Russia and other Com-
 munist countries without license and
 without limitation.
 The Senator pointed out that this act of
 appeasement and conciliation apparent-
 ly did not serve very well the purposes
 of amity between the two countries,
 that this had no impact whatso-
 ever on lessening the amount of war
 weapons which are being shipped by Rus-
 sia to Hanoi, and that it has been only
 recently that these tremendously sig-
 nificant helicopters have been supplied
 by Russia to Hanoi.
 The Senator would agree, I am sure,
 with the Senator from South Dakota that
 the helicopter activities of our American
 forces and our South Vietnamese allies
 have been one of the bright spots and
 one of the productive operations of our
 war effort.
 Mr. HRUSKA, Those activities have
 been among the most efficient and effec-
 tive forces in the waging of that war.
 They put us far ahead of the enemy.
 Yet, that "advantage" is being rapidly
 dissipated by the appearance on the
 scene of the Russian-supplied helicop-
 ters.
 Mr. MUNDT. Precisely, and it was
 for that reason that the North Vietnam-
 ese Communists sent out that great
 Macedonian call to their comrades in
 Moscow, "We'must have helicopters."
 They got helicopters, and they got heli-
 copters of the best possible design. They
 got a substantial number of these heli-
 copters and, of course, they got them
 from Russia.
 Mr. HRUSKA. And, very likely, with
 training by Russian helicopter pilots.
 Mr. MUNDT. There is no question
 about that. That would follow the for-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 attempted isolation, the ratification of
 the consular treaty.
 Instead of having some concrete, overt
 action by the Soviet Union along the
 lines I indicate, we have had an outright
 rejection of the treaty as a part of the
 big package, and, in fact, an apparent
 rejection of the entire package. We also
 have a stepping up of the hot war which
 Russia is waging against the United
 States in Vietnam.
 The argument in favor of ratifying the
 consular treaty is, "We want to end the
 cold war, and therefore we ought to
 ratify this treaty." This plea is not ap-
 plicable. There is no indication that a
 letup by the Soviets will take place in the
 cold war because of the ratification of the
 treaty, if the treaty should, unhappily, be
 ratified.
 The principal basis of the proponents'
 arguments-those who favor ratification
 of the treaty-seems to be along this line,
 and it is to this line that I should like
 to devote the greater part of my remarks:
 First, it is said that we are dealing with
 a new communism.
 Second, it is said, as appears in the
 state of the Union message by our Presi-
 dent:
 We are shaping a new future of enlarged
 partnership in nuclear affairs and in eco-
 nomic and technical cooperation in trade
 negotiations, in political consultation and
 in working together with the governments
 and the peoples of eastern Europe and the
 Soivet Union.
 There is a little intervening language
 and, then, continuing-
 Our relations with the Soviet Union and
 Eastern Europe are also in transition.
 We have language such as that re-
 ferred to and language such as that used
 a week ago today in the city of Fulton,
 Mo., at Westminster College by the Vice
 President, who said:
 It is my belief that we stand today upon
 the threshold of a new era in our relations
 with the peoples of Europe-a period of New
 Engagement.
 And I believe that this new period, if we do
 not lose our wits or our nerve, or our pa-
 tience, can see the replacement of the Iron
 Curtain by the Open. Door.
 Here we have these statements and a
 new commitment, a new further part-
 nership with the governments and peo-
 ples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet
 Union; and the statement "Replacement
 of the Iron Curtain by the open door."
 They are all statements to the effect
 that there has occurred a change in the
 attitude, activities, and relationships be-
 tween this country and the Soviet Union.
 Yet, nowhere have we had any assign-
 ment of reasons, any proof, nor any in-
 dication that any of these things have
 occurred. Hopefully they will occur. No
 one will engage in more earnest or fer-
 vent hope that they do occur in due time
 than I and I know that that hope is
 shared by everybody, but we have to be
 realists.
 There is not only a lack of proof, but
 also there is much evidence to the
 contrary.
 Whatever changes they might show,
 their adamant and vigorous attitude
 points toward increasing an escalation
 of the cold and hot wars in which the
 Soviet Union is engaged against us,
 rather than the reverse.
 Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. HRUSKA. I yield.
 Mr. COTTON. The Senator from New
 Hampshire is very deeply impressed with
 all that the distinguished Senator from
 Nebraska has been saying. I think it is
 a masterful, thorough, and analytical
 presentation of things the Senate should
 be thinking about before we vote on this
 momentous question. I wish to ask the
 Senator from Nebraska in regard to the
 statement just made, if he agrees, that
 so far as we have been able to discern,
 there has not been one single overture
 or any act of softening, indicating that
 there is a new attitude toward us on the
 part of the Soviets. Am I correct in that
 statement?
 Mr. HRUSKA. The Senator is cor-
 rect, as far as the study, the reading', and
 the observations of this Senator are con-
 cerned. I have searched in vain for some
 act that could be construed in the light
 in which the Senator referred, and I have
 been unable to find it.
 Mr. COTTON.  Knowing the thor-
 oughness with which the Senator from
 Nebraska undertakes all of his research
 before engaging in as important an ut-
 terance on the floor of the Senate as he
 has made, I am satisfied, that there has
 not been any significant change.
 I wish to ask the following question:
 If there had been any change in the
 attitude of the Soviet Union, or if there
 had been made to our Government di-
 rectly or indirectly secretly or otherwise,
 any promise or offer, or any suggestion
 that there might be a change, and that
 that change of attitude might be effected
 if we ratified this treaty, does not the
 Senator from Nebraska think that every
 Senator, who has the solemn duty to
 vote on this ratification should be in-
 formed of that fact, and not have it
 merely hinted at?
 Mr. HRUSKA. I agree with the Sena-
 tor. If there are any secret communica-
 tions or unpublicized communications
 every member of the Senate should be
 informed of them.
 There have been rumors from time to
 time that they do exist but for high rea-
 sons of state they cannot be disclosed. I
 have never been able to track them down.
 I know that one of our colleagues-I
 shall not undertake to identify him; he
 can speak for himself if he wishes-came
 across rumors that two different kinds
 of some classified reason that has been
 advanced by those in the executive de-
 partment; each was different from the
 other and did not include reference to
 the other.
 If there are such things they should
 be disclosed, and they could be disclosed
 in a discreet manner. We could con-
 sider them as classified, and for reasons
 of national security not disclose them.
 That would be one thing, but to deny that
 information, if any does exist, I think
 we should assume that there are no such
 reasons, and vote accordingly.
 Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield further?
 Mr. HRUSKA, I am happy to yield to
 the Senator from New Hampshire.
 S 3655
 Mr. COTTON. I am sure the Senator
 from Nebraska is just as reluctant as
 the Senator from New Hampshire, and
 others in the Senate who have misgivings
 about this treaty, to stand in the way
 of any real step that might make our re-
 lations with the Communist world better
 in the future, and avert even in some
 small degree the possibility of nuclear
 war. I am sure he is just as reluctant
 as any of us are in that respect. Is that
 correct?
 . Mr. HRUSKA. Yes. I have declared
 that to be so in my statement and I re-
 peat it now.
 Mr. COTTON. If I interpret correct-
 ly what the Senator has just said, if he
 were informed in the strictest confidence
 by the responsible heads of the Govern-
 ment of the United States of any real
 facts that would indicate that ratifica-
 tion of this treaty would hasten peace in
 the future, I know that he, as is true of
 many of the rest of us, would take that
 fully into consideration without divulg-
 ing the facts, if they should not be
 divulged.
 Mr.HRUSKA. There is no question
 about that, as far as my thinking and
 belief are concerned.
 Mr. COTTON. It is my understand-
 ing, as far as the Senator from Nebraska
 is concerned, and as is the case with the
 Senator from New Hampshire, that at
 no time has any responsible person given
 us any information, any real evidence
 that this treaty that we are urging upon
 the Soviet Union, that we are in a sense
 supplicating them to accept, will have
 any more significance than our action in
 paying tribute to the pirates of Tripoli-
 before we rebelled and decided that we
 would not continue to pay tribute-while
 hoping that they would be kinder to us?
 Mr. HRUSKA, 'No such information
 has come to me from any source in the
 executive departments. Other Senators
 will have to make their own disclosures
 as to what may or may not have hap-
 pened to them in this regard.
 Getting back to the oft-repeated as-
 sertions that we are dealing with a new
 communism or are entering into a new
 partnership with the government and
 people of the Soviet Union, and the
 statement that the replacement of the
 Iron Curtain by the open door is immi-
 nent, and that all we have to have is
 patience and the other things that go
 with it, such as forbearance, I do not
 know how much more by way of appease-
 ment, perhaps, or modification we must
 display. On that subject, I wish to ad-
 dress myself to the proposition that there
 has been no change in the stance or in
 the program of the Communist Party.
 Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, will the
 Senator from Nebraska yield for a ques-
 tion?
 Mr. HRUSKA. I am happy to yield.
 Mr. MURPHY. As the Senator said,
 there has been no change. Am I correct
 in believing that in spite of the fact that,
 from time to time, we read in some of the
 press that there has been a thawing of
 the cold war, the Senator means that
 actually, as to basic principles or a
 change of objectives, there has been no
 noticeable change in, let us say, the last
 15 years?

 are thrown in our faces day after day as
 the spontaneous outbursts of the indi-
 vidual beliefs of the great American
 people; But now, when there is a flood-
 and if the Senator has had the same ex-
 perience this Senator has had, perfectly
 overwhelming flood-of personal letters
 from the folks back home, protesting the
 ratification of this treaty, and begging
 us to resist it, we are told that these let-
 ters were all inspired. Now we are told
 that these letters were all the result of
 propaganda by organizations; that they
 do not represent the individual thoughts
 and deep feelings of individuals; and
 that we should disregard them?
 Has the Senator noticed that strange
 contrast of opinion as between when the
 people's feelings are really their own
 feelings-as in this case-and when their
 feelings are not their own, but what
 someone else says they are.
 Mr. HRUSKA. The Senator puts the
 matter in good perspective.
 Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. HRUSKA. I yield to the Senator
 from South Dakota.
 Mr. MUNDT. I think the comments
 on polls introduced by the Senator from
 California and commented upon by sev-
 eral of my colleagues are quite pertinent.
 I might raise the question, Where is
 George Gallup? Where is Louis Harris?
 This subject has been debated and dis-
 cussed for well over a month, perhaps
 2 months. It is one of the most vital
 issues before the country. It is one of
 significant departure from all previous
 American history.  The decision, one
 way or the other, will have an impact on
 the war in Vietnam. What more vital
 subject than this for the poll of the
 people's thinking, Dr. Gallup or Mr.
 Harris? Is this a time for silence?
 I wonder if it is not pertinent to the
 fact that over the weekend the Senator
 from South Dakota had conversations
 with at least two important editors. I
 think it may have been three, but I will
 be conservative and say it was two. They
 very vividly told me they had been im-
 portuned by the State Department to
 write strong editorials in support of the
 treaty, and the editorials were forth-
 coming.
 I wonder what kind of pressures and
 propaganda are behind the desire to
 downgrade and ignore the wishes of the
 people, and not even to reflect them in
 polls such as those operated by Dr. Gal-
 lup and Mr. Harris on a host of other
 issues and then to go further and decry
 those who have opposed the treaty as
 simple automations, being inspired by
 someone else. One of our colleagues has
 even called them crackpots or extrem-
 ists.
 I believe. this is still a representative
 government, with the concept that on
 matters such as this we must get infor-
 S 3657
 I was interested in the very eloquent
 and persuasive remarks by the Senator
 from Wyoming [Mr. HANSEN], who has
 made some exellent points.in his dis-
 course. The question that the Senator
 from Nebraska is presently discussing-
 about what element of change, if any,
 has crept into this whole matter called
 communism, and if there has been
 change, has it been change which we
 should welcome and embrace and en-
 courage, or is it a change which indi-
 cates a greater degree of belligerency
 and greater degree of antipathy by the
 Communists against the best interests
 of the United States-is most pertinent.
 In the matter of East-West wartime
 trade, I think we have a ease in point.
 I recall that Lenin said, back in 1921:
 All it is necessary to do is to bribe capi-
 talism with extra profit, so as to get the
 machines with which to defeat it economi-
 cally.
 That was Lenin's Communist doctrine
 then, and of course it was he who wrote
 the bible of communism. He was the
 master and the architect of the Com-
 munist creed,
 It seems to me the students of com-
 munism overseas have today become the
 masters. Now they have taken that
 Lenin recipe seriously. They have car-
 ried it to the logical degree that all it
 is necessary to do now in time of war
 is to bribe capitalism with extra profits
 to get it to supply the tools to kill its
 own sons fighting for freedom in Hanoi.
 That is a pretty serious extension of this
 Lenin doctrine but it fits it like the hand
 fits the glove.
 If it can be argued, as it probably will,
 that those who come from pastoral rural
 States do not have any great industrial
 machines, do not have any international
 banking houses, and thus perhaps are
 not qualified to talk about the intricies
 of international trade and the rich prof-
 its it is supposed to provide for certain
 people in this country, perhaps they
 will permit me to quote from a maga-
 zine which is seldom read out in the
 grassroots areas of our country, Let me
 present the testimony of a magazine
 published in one of the great financial
 centers of our land-Barron's Business
 and Financial Weekly.

 story was headed, "Dangerous Bridges,"
 with the subheading "Proposals for

 article to the reading of all of my fellow
 Senators. It is true that we do not have
 much chance to read this magazine out
 in the country areas of South Dakota;

 It is these same people who pay taxes.
 It is the people who elect the Repre-

 to Congress. These same people are
 supplying over 500,000 boys in uniform
 today, and they may have to do double
 that composite figure if the war goes on
 too much longer. I do not think it is
 right to downgrade them.
 I invite any Senator who will sit clown
 and read his mail on this issue-not take
 the secondhand reports of his secretary
 or some staff member for it, but sit clown
 and read the letter himself-to then ex-
 press his conviction on the floor that
 these letters are from crackpots and
 extremists. One Senator expressed the
 opinion that such letters were from
 "nuts." Mr. President, these letters are
 not from "nuts." These are not in the
 main letters from inspired sources. It
 is easy to spot inspired letters. We can
 easily recognize the same monotonous
 phrases. The letters we are getting are
 written by individuals who express their
 individual, serious views, as can be noted
 by the handwriting and viewpoints ex-
 pressed. Many come from serious stu-
 dents of American history. I think the
 people have some right to have from
 Senators some expression as to 'their
 overwhelming judgment and desires, and
 that they are not to be kicked aside ar-
 rogantly by Members who say those let-
 ters are coming from crackpots and
 extremists and should be ignored. We
 should not hear, "Oh, I get letters 100 to
 1 in favor of opposing the treaty, but I
 am going to vote for the viewpoint of
 that one because I know his sentiments
 are sincere and genuine, and the rest
 are opinions reflecting some inspired
 viewpoint of other sources or from some
 extremist group."
 I resent that view because to me it
 brushes aside the views of the people,
 which, in our representative form of gov-
 ernment, we should reflect and carefully
 consider. I resent the idea that we
 should swagger around and say that the
 people do not know what they are talk-
 ing about on the simple question of do
 we or do we not want to ratify a con-
 sular treaty with Russia in this time of
 bitter war? There are no top secrets
 involved. If the question involved were
 one about the wisdom of building or not
 building an antiballistic missile system,
 then we might be able to say that we
 must rely on the expert opinions of tech-
 nicians and scientists and specialists in
 nuclear warfare, and say that, wise or
 unwise, our decisions were going to have
 to be determined by the opinions of those
 experts.
 On this issue, however, Mr. President,
 the people are the experts, because they
 are the ones who will lose or  rofit

 S 3658               CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 T'.icre remains the final supreme con-
 sider,;tion for any American businessman
 who may still hanker after elusive profit from
 %e11ing, to the Communists: He must decide,
 in his own private conscience, whether the
 profit is worth the personal risk that some
 day. sooner or later, on some near or distant
 Uatth,fleld, his neighbor's son or his own may
 he struck down by a weapon which his zeal
 for trade put into the enemy's hands.
 Only those with very short memories
 can forget, Mr. President, that we learned
 this lesson-or should have learned it-
 back in 1940 and 1941, when proponents
 of the same line of thinking which urges
 us now to move in the direction of ex-
 panded trade with Russia were prac-
 ticing the fine art of selling scrap iron to
 the Japanese, to help them build their
 war machine, while some of us, the
 present speaker included, were moving
 around the country whenever oppor-
 tunity presented itself, and declaring our
 opposition in the Senate of the United
 States and the House of Representatives.
 I served in the House of Representatives
 at that time.
 What happened?  On Pearl Harbor
 Day, we found that our Pacific Navy was
 virtually destroyed, and more than 3,000
 American casualties had occurred, in an
 infamous surprise attack by the people
 to whom we were selling, for a profit, war
 supplies less significant by far than the
 war supplies we are selling to Russia to-
 day.
 At least it could be said by those ad-
 vocating such policy then, "We are not
 at war with Japan yet. They have not
 killed any American boys yet. You pessi-
 mists who believe there might be a war
 with Japan could be wrong.  In the
 meantime, we are making extra plush,
 war-fed profits in America."
 This administration cannot even use
 that defense today, Mr. President, be-
 cause 3 years after the heavy casual-
 ties began coming in, 3 years after
 the big war had begun in Vietnam, the
 present Commander in Chief, Mr. John-
 son, by a scratch of his pen, on October
 12, 1966, opened up the shipment of iron
 ore and scrap metal again, plus 399 other
 commodities. to the country then and
 now busy at the job of supplying the guns
 to kill American boys.
 It is no wonder, it seems to me, that
 Americans write in, in such vast num-
 bers-Americans who, we hope, will con-
 tinue to support this war effort until we
 are successfully out of it, but Americans
 who form part of the great body politic
 which is becoming growingly discon-
 tented with this whole curious war, which
 goes on and on, is now in Its fifth year,
 and now we hear the same people who
 say, "We would like to do something to
 shorten it," support this pagan formula
 to increase the traffic in blood, which is
 certain to prolong it.
 I thank the Senator for yielding.
 Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, will
 the Senator from Nebraska yield, so that
 I may ask the Senator from South Da-
 kota a question?
 Mfr. HRUSKA. I am happy to yield.
 Mr. THURMOND. I should like to as-
 sociate myself with a remark just made
 by the Senator from South Dakota on the
 point that the people who are writing In,
 opposed to this treaty, are not "extrem-
 fists" or "crackpots," or whatever term
 some of those who espouse this treaty so
 ardently would apply to them. I can say
 that my mall-and I know my people-
 reflects a sentiment very strongly against
 this treaty, and it is coming from some of
 the ablest, finest people in South Caro-
 lina. I believe that is typical of the kind
 of people who are writing about this
 treaty throughout the Nation. I believe
 it is typical of the members of the Re-
 publican Party.
 Last Saturday evening, I had the
 pleasure of speaking to the Young Repub-
 licans of four States-Virginia, West
 Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland-
 and the District of Columbia. When I
 spoke to them for a few minutes on this
 consular treaty, together with other sub-
 jects upon which I spoke, I know that
 the terrific response I received shows
 that the Young Republicans represent-
 ing this area of our country are strongly
 opposed to ratifying this treaty.
 Air. MUNDT. And why not? They
 leave to go to war along with other young
 Americans, to be shot at by the products
 which we help to fabricate by sending
 additional industrial supplies to the ar-
 senal of Hanoi.
 Air. THURMOND. The Senator from
 South Dakota is exactly right.
 I believe that the more people study
 this treaty, the more they will become
 convinced that it is not in the best in-
 terests of this country.
 I have not heard one sound argument
 yet in favor of the treaty. I have given
 nine specific arguments against it.  I
 have not heard one sound argument yet
 to cause me to support the treaty.
 Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, one of
 the distressing developments to the
 Senator from South Dakota is that he
 does not believe in the growing centrall-
 zat.ion of power in the Nation's Capital.
 After it has been concentrated in the
 hands of a few dozen people, those peo-
 ple are presumed to personify the au-
 thority of the people, and they are em-
 powwered to exercise authority over all
 of us.
 One of my reasons for opposing this
 so-called new liberalism is because it
 moves in the direction of placing fewer
 and fewer and fewer top-level officials
 in control of the lives of the remainder
 of us in the country.
 My quarrel is with the new liberals
 who believe in this concentration of
 power.
 The traditional liberals abominated
 both economic monopoly and political
 monopoly in the same breath.  How-
 ever, our new liberals embrace politi-
 cal monopoly.  They abhor economic
 monopoly, as we all do, but they embrace
 political monopoly which is infinitely
 worse.
 The new liberal would tip the pyra-
 mid of American government upside
 down, with the people at the bottom and
 the power structure of government at
 the top.
 In this connection, some of the com-
 ments which I have recently heard made
 on the floor have disturbed me greatly.
 The comments have downgraded and at-
 tacked and ridiculed the statements
 contained In the mail received from con-
 Marc! 1.3, 1967
 scientious people who write in opposi-
 tion to this treaty,
 This reflects the growing sentiment
 among some public official: in this coun-
 try. It frightens me more greatly al-
 most than the consequences of the rati-
 flcatic'n of this treaty. That involves
 the tendency for some people in high
 positions-some of them elected. but
 most of them appointed- to develop an
 arrogant contempt for tte people who
 base their whole philosophy for the solu-
 tion of an economic or social problem on
 the ecncept: "You can't trust the people.
 You can rely only upon the politicians.
 only upon the Government, only upon
 the bureaucrats, only upon the snoopers,
 only upon the administrators, and only
 upon the politicians." I deny that lib-
 eral concept emphatically.
 I think politicians are wonderful peo-
 ple.  [ am proud to call myself a poli-
 tician, but we do not have halos around
 our leads. We do not know the an-
 swers to all of the problems.
 We come from among the people who
 write letters and who vcte to keep us
 here.  However, when we develop the
 attitude, as an elected or appointed pub-
 lic offcial, that people cannot be trusted,
 that people are always wrong, that peo-
 ple hive not any ethics, good judgment or
 sound sense, and cannot run a good bus-
 iness or a good school, that kind of
 "liberalism," concentrate(( in the hands
 of a few people with the right to shove
 everyoody else around, is totally and
 demonstrably wrong.
 It is nevertheless contained in the an-
 swers some people get back home to the
 letters they are writing on the Consular
 Treaty. I know, because, for one reason
 or another, my name has been listed as
 one of those leading the opposition to
 the treaty. I get copies of a lot of let-
 ters received by my colleagues in the
 Senate; and also copies of the Senators'
 replies when they disappoint or provide
 disenchantment to the recipients.
 I know some of the things that have
 been written by Senators to their con-
 stitu(nts. The names of the Senators
 who wrote them could not be dragged
 out of my mouth with a 20-mule team.
 But, I can say this: If any Senator
 from South Dakota ever wrote his con-
 stituents in that manner and manifested
 his contempt for the judgment and
 knowledge of individual citizens, those
 citizens would find some way to get rid
 of him before he served out his term, and
 I think properly so.
 I read the letters and I know what is
 being written.
 I am a little ashamed of the whole ap-
 proach that would try to condemn as an
 ignoramus, a crackpot, or a nut the
 mother of a son in Viet lam who takes
 her pen in hand and says: "I don't think
 it is wise at this time of war to support
 and ratify this Consular Treaty.-
 I think the Senator from South Caro-
 lina s treating with one of the problems
 of our times, the whole question of
 whether we the elite, we the officials, or
 we the officeholders have this right to
 assume such lack of good faith or good
 judgment on the part of the people who
 write- us in such great numbers in op-
 position to this treaty.

 I think the concept is wrong, and that
 the voice of the people in America still
 has a right to be heard, and should on
 occasion be reflected in our public policy.
 Mr. THURMOND. Is it not a fact
 that this war would not be going on now
 if it were not for Russia providing North
 Vietnam with weapons with which to
 fight the war?
 Mr. MUNDT. I think that can be
 factually demonstrated. I have heard
 many military people allude to the fact
 that the war in Vietnam would have been
 over at least 12 months ago if the Rus-
 sians had not supplied the sophisticated
 weapons with which to fight the war,
 and over 95 percent of the petroleum re-
 quired by the Vietnamese Communists to
 continue it.
 I have yet to find a military man who
 will tell me how a country can fight a
 modern war without gasoline, oil, and
 petroleum.
 Those products go to Hanoi almost
 exclusively from Russia.
 If we want to find out how to end the
 war, we must figure out a way to get the
 Russians to quit supplying the materials.
 We cannot do that by kissing them on
 the cheeks and saying: "Go out and kill
 more men."
 Mr. THURMOND. I visited Vietnam
 in December. I made a report after my
 visit in Vietnam where I spent a week,
 another week in that area of the world,
 Thailand, Burma, Japan, and other
 countries.
 I read one brief paragraph from my
 report:
 RUSSIA'S ROLE IN VIETNAM WAR
 The Soviet Union is furnishing North Viet-
 nam anti-aircraft weapons, surface to air
 missiles, jet fighter planes, heavy artillery,
 artillery rockets, machine, guns, rifles, am-
 munition, advanced radar system, ships,
 helicopters,  trucks,  heavy, construction
 equipment, bridge building materials, oil
 mines, and other supplies with which to fight
 the war. Without the aid the Soviets are
 providing, North Vietnam and the Viet Cong
 would be unable to wage the war very long.
 Soviet Russia has it within her power to
 stop the war and bring the combatants to
 the negotiating table without delay.
 Mr. MUNDT. We can also add to
 that list the MM ground-to-ground rock-
 et which has proven so effective in kill-
 ing not only our American troops, but
 also our allies there.
 That weapon is now being employed
 by our enemies in the South Vietnamese
 part of the conflict.
 Mr. THURMOND. I am convinced
 that if we ratify this treaty with Soviet
 Russia now, it will do at least two things,
 aside from other harmful effects.
 It will raise the prestige of the Soviet
 Union throughout the world by mislead-
 ing nations into believing that now the
 great United States, the most powerful
 nation in the world, has tremendous re-
 spect for the Soviet Union and is will-
 ing to enter into agreements with the
 Soviet Union signifying that the United
 States is willing and able to trust the
 Soviets.
 Mr. MUNDT. There is no question
 .bout that.
 Mr. THURMOND. I am convinced
 that if we ratify the treaty, the treaty
 will cause other nations to wonder where
 the United States stands. The countries
 tions, will give up hope. They will feel
 that the last solid country, a country
 which could help to save them some
 day, has gone over to the Soviet side.
 They will wonder whether we have
 gotten together with the Soviets and are
 just going to forget them and leave them
 where they are and do nothing to help
 them in any way, shape, form, or fash-
 ion, to emerge from behind the Iron Cur-
 tain.
 It seems to me that if we ratify the
 treaty, it will have a severe and serious
 psychological effect all across the free
 world.
 Mr. MUNDT.  The Senator brings up
 an interesting point.
 Let us consider the case of an Ameri-
 can businessman who is traveling in Rus-
 sia in the Baltic area, visiting some of the
 cities of the Baltic States.
 Let us assume that he gets into trouble
 in Latvia. He decides to make use of this
 consular arrangement. It seems to me
 that by that very act we will be giving,
 ipso facto, recognition to the fact that
 Latvia and Estonia and Lithuania, those
 three great little brave Baltic Republics,
 have now ceased to exist. And they will
 officially be recognized by us as forever
 part of the Soviet Union, because we will
 have been forced into the position of
 working through our consular officers
 with the Russian Government in that
 connection.
 The contrary side of the coin could also
 be true. Let us say they set up this con-
 sular office in Chicago, and a Latvian in
 this country gets into trouble in the
 United States and we put him in jail.
 Under the Consular Treaty, the Russian
 consular officer would have a right to talk
 to this Latvian citizen in jail, because
 we would have the consular treaty with
 Russia, and Russia claims control over
 Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. By rec-
 ognition of that fact, also, it seems to me,
 ipso facto, we have recognized a status
 of affairs which officially and directly our
 Government has refused to recognize.
 Many of the evolvements in this mat-
 ter, when we think them through, as to
 what will happen at the end of the road,
 give this innocent-sounding treaty much
 more significance than the fact that per-
 haps it can be beneficial on the average
 to nine Americans per year traveling for
 pleasure or profit in Russia.
 Mr. THURMOND. Does it not amount
 to de facto recognition by forcible inclu-
 sion of these nations-Estonia, Latvia,
 and Lithuania-into the Soviet empire?
 Mr. MUNDT. The State Department
 denies that automatically it is de facto
 recognition, and I acquiesce in and ac-
 cept their position. But the operation
 of the treaty will be such that, sooner
 or later, over there or in this country,
 we will have an American in trouble in
 Latvia or Lithuania, or a Lithuanian or
 an Estonian in trouble in this country,
 and the Russians, under the terms of the
 treaty-and they have a right to do so-
 will immediately insist upon being noti-
 fied and insist upon talking to him, as
 through consular officer. So, whether he
 wishes to see the Russian consular officer
 or not, the fact is that we must let the
 Russian representative talk to him. This
 is a de facto recognition at that point
 S 3659
 just as well turn out the light of hope
 that they, will ever again attain that
 status, so far as the United States is
 concerned.
 The Senate, which piously expresses its
 sympathetic attitude toward the captive
 nations by agreeing to a Captive Nations
 Week resolution every year, sympathiz-
 ing with them, can, by this Consular
 Treaty action, condemn them to the sta-
 tus quo so far as we are concerned, be-
 cause it will provide that de facto recog-
 nition and it will destroy their rightful
 and proper and enduring hope that, come
 some happy day, their homelands can
 once again be independent.
 Once you put them under the domina-
 tion of the consular operations, as this
 treaty does-on both sides of the water-
 as set up in the mechanics of treaty, you
 have provided a beautiful device for the
 Russians to express themselves, through
 actions; that they are in charge of the
 Baltic and other captive countries, and
 if we wish to have communication be-
 tween the nationals of those countries
 and this country, Mother Russia and its
 consular officers are the ones to pro-
 vide it,
 If this is not de facto recognition, I
 should like someone from the State De-
 partment to say what it is.
 Mr. THURMOND. We may pass reso-
 lutions in the Senate each year extend-
 ing our sympathy, to the people of the
 captive nations behind the Iron Curtain,
 but are we not, in effect, nullifying and
 counteracting such action when we take
 real action, which counts, by ratifying
 the treaty?
 Mr. MUNDT. At least, the representa-
 tives and the spokesmen in this country
 of the captive nations are unanimously in
 that belief. It seems to me that all the
 rules of logic, all the rules of precedence,
 and all the rules of international proce-
 dure indicate that these representatives
 of the captive nations are demonstrably
 correct; that what we are doing is creat-
 ing a pathway, and when we walk down
 this Consular Treaty pathway and it be-
 gins to function, this is the end of their
 hope of this country doing anything but
 recognizing the status quo and the fact
 that they are, indeed, permanently the
 captives and the satellites of the Soviet
 Union.
 Mr. THURMOND. I ask the Senator
 from South Dakota this question: If the
 Soviet law is so capricious that the U.S.
 consular employees need special immu-
 nity while in the U.S.S.R., is the time yet
 ripe to normalize travel and trade rela-
 tions with the Soviets?
 Mr. MUNDT. This kind of treacher.
 ous line, of argument is encountered in
 connection with what is known as Execu-
 tive Reservation No. 2, on which the Sen-
 ate will vote on Thursday of this week,
 which is being opposed by some of the
 spokesmen for the treaty who say:
 No, this won't help cut down the ship-
 ments of arms to Hanoi, and this won't make
 it more likely that we can work out an agree-
 ment and negotiation by using this diplo-
 matic tool to induce them to stop. All you
 have to do is to simply go along with them
 and say nothing, just go ahead and acquiesce
 and all will be well,
 that those Baltic countries cease to have pointed out, and as the Senator from New

 afternoon, In this instance they have us
 on our knees, crawling to Moscow as
 supplicants, if we ratify the treaty. The
 Russians have not ratified it. They have
 no, even presented it to their ratifying
 body. They want us to come crawling
 to them and say, "Please, would not you
 now ratify the treaty which we have rati-
 fied"" That is a miserable position In
 which to put Uncle Sam. if we are at-
 tempting to negotiate or to curtail the
 shipment of supplies from Moscow to
 Hanoi.
 It certainly follows that it is a capri-
 cious line of reasoning, which says, on
 the one hand, "you can depend upon the
 word of the Russians to move in the
 direction we want them to move": but,
 on the other hand, "they have so many
 curious laws that they maliciously are
 arresting our citizens and we have to
 have a special consular treaty with them
 to protect our American travelers in
 Russia."
 I believe that the welcome news from
 Moscow over the weekend that they have
 agreed to release an American citizen,
 proves the argument that has been made
 on the floor of the Senate and before the
 Committee on Foreign Relations for
 weeks; that if you have a little more
 rugged and determined exercise of diplo-
 macy with Russia on this side of the
 ocean, you can utilize without this
 treaty, through the diplomatic under-
 standings existing between all civilized
 nations, every kind of contact you need
 to induce them to release prisoners or to
 induce us to release prisoners. You do
 not need this unprecedented treaty, with
 all the problems attendant upon it, even
 in peacetime-but, in time of war, this
 treaty can become a signal to the world
 that others had not better tie too closely
 to Uncle Sam because we are also reach-
 ing out with a special arrangement of
 our own with their Communist enemy in
 Moscow.
 Mr. THURMOND. Some people will
 take the position that the Soviet Union
 is evolving into a peaceful country. Yet,
 the treaty that is before the Senate for
 ratification has been violated 20 or more
 times since it was signed. Does that
 sound like the Soviet Union Is evolving?
 If so, what does evolving mean? When
 are they going to live peacefully In the
 world and respect the dignity of a citi-
 zen and of all free people?
 Mr. MUNDT.  When the Senator
 from South Carolina and I began dis-
 cussing this matter and utilizing the time
 generously granted us by the Senator
 from Nebraska, the Senator from Ne-
 braska was in the process of discussing
 whether there was an evolution in the
 Communist approach in Moscow. Per-
 haps I should bow out now and permit
 the Senator from Nebraska to answer
 that question and then to resume with
 the point he was developing when he
 was interrupted by the numerous collo-
 quies.
 'Mr. THURMOND. I thank the distin-
 guished Senator from South Dakota, and
 I thank the able Senator from Nebraska
 for ais kindness in yielding.
 Mr. HRUSKA. I thank the Senator
 from South Dakota and the Senator
 from South Carolina. They have en-
 gaged in splendid colloquy. It has been
 constructive, enlightening, and very
 pertinent to the subject at hand,
 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, let me
 say once more how very appreciative I
 am to the Senator from Nebraska for the
 able presentation he has made this after-
 noon. The Senator from Nebraska has
 placed the consideration of the Consular
 Treaty in its proper context. Certainly,
 this Nation has demonstrated for all the
 world to see that America desires no ex-
 tension of its control, or authority, or
 jurisdiction over the people of any area
 anywhere in the world.
 The United States hopes, rather, for
 an extension of peace, and for an exten-
 sion of the right of peoples everywhere to
 self-?-determination through law and or-
 der.
 I share the hope of most Americans in
 anticipating the time when we can, one
 nation with another, achieve a better un-
 derstanding and a greater accord than
 now exists.
 We cannot overlook the fact that this
 country has made great efforts since the
 end of World War II to bring about the
 sort of condition which will, we hope,
 some day. characterize the world.
 We have contributed more than $125
 billion toward foreign aid and rebuild-
 ing war-torn countries. We have done
 everything we possibly could do to lessen
 war tensions, to bring about better un-
 derstanding, to bring about a better
 detente with the nations of the world.
 and particularly with those behind the
 Iron Curtain. But it seems to me that
 there is an analogy which ought to be
 considered as we discuss the Consular
 Treaty. It is that the Congress of the
 United States we are discussing the wis-
 dom of providing in a bill the control of
 small arms. We recognize, or at least
 there are those who believe, that we want
 to bring about a diminution of lawless-
 ness, murder, and all acts attendant to
 crime in this country, and one of the
 ways to do that Is to limit the supply or
 transshipment of arms.  Yet we turn
 right around in this Consular Treaty and
 seem to think that there is no relation-
 ship between the Consular Treaty and
 the encouragement of businessmen to
 move into Russia, to have new trade with
 Russia, to supply Russia with goods, and
 that Russia will not have greater oppor-
 tunity to devote more effort to the manu-
 facture of war-making materiel. We
 seem to find no relationship between
 that fact and our efforts to supply Rus-
 sia with 400-some-odd so-called non-
 strategic materials In the context of en-
 larging her general economic and hence,
 her warmaking capability.
 I suggest we ought to take into ac-
 count such consideration because, in my
 mind, there is a very real relevance be-
 tween our supplying Russia with any-
 thing today and Russia's being able to
 supply Vietnam with warmaking mate-
 riel.
 Once again I want to record my appre-
 ciation to the distinguished Senator
 from Nebraska for having called to the
 attention of the Senate some very im-
 portant considerations that we ought to
 mull over seriously before we give our
 advise and consent to the implementa-
 tion of this Consular Treaty.
 Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I ask
 March 1.?, 1967
 unanimous consent to have printed in
 the RECORD a letter dated February 28,
 1967, from the Members of Congress for
 Peace Through Law, addressed to the

 Relations, the distinguished Senator

 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD.
