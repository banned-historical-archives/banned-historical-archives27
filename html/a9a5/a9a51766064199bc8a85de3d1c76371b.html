WATERGATE 
A Bipartisan End to Patience 
The House Judiciary Committee 
finally lost patience last week with the 
cavalier and inconclusive White House 
? responses to its six-week-old request for 
? presidential tape recordings. Acting 
with impressive bipartisanship after a 
tense week of backstage maneuvering, 
the committee voted, 33 to 3, to sub-
poena the evidence. 
In a sense the committee's historic 
? action?it was the first resort by the 
House to a subpoena for evidence from 
a President in an impeachment inquiry 
?was more symbolic than practical. Al-
though the committee was on solid legal 
ground in issuing the subpoena, it has 
no effective way to enforce it. If Nixon 
chooses not to honor it fully, the com-
mittee can seek a citation against him 
from the House for contempt of Con-
gress. While ordinary citizens can be fin-
prisoned for such contempt, the only ef-
fective recourse for the House in the case 
of a President apparently would be to 
add such defiance as another article of 
impeachment. For Nixon, however, fail-
ure to comply with the subpoena would 
have far more than symbolic impact; it 
would virtually confirm that there is in-
criminating material in the subpoenaed 
conversations that he is trying to hide. 
The Judiciary Committee and Re-
publican leaders in both chambers of 
Congress had worked frantically to 
avoid this newest constitutional confron-
tation spawned by Watergate. After 
Democrat Peter Rodino, chairman of 
the committee, set Tuesday, April 9, as 
the firm deadline for a definitive White 
House response to its Feb. 25 request 
for 41 tapes, congressional Republicans 
repeatedly implored Nixon's chief Wa-
tergate counsel, James St. Clair, to re-
spond affirmatively and cooperatively. 
If he did not, they warned, the subpoe-
na could not be avoided. 
As the deadline approached on 
Tuesday, Dean Burch, Nixon's newest 
high-level assistant, carried a copy of 
St. Clair's proposed response to Capitol 
Hill. There the Senate's top G.O.P. lead-
ers, including Hugh Scott, Robert Grif-
fin, John Tower, Wallace Bennett, Nor-
ris Cotton and William Brock, read it 
and bluntly told Burch that it was in-
adequate. "It won't fly," snapped one of 
these leaders. "It doesn't go far enough," 
complained Scott. "You've got to get a 
line in there on your intent to cooper-
ate with the committee." In partial ex-
planation, Burch told the Senate Repub-
lican leaders that only one White House 
lawyer, J. Fred Buzhardt, and a secre-
tary had been assigned to review the 
tapes. It took them a full day to tran-
? scribe just one confusing six-minute seg-
ment of conversation on one tape, Burch 
contended. Some of the Senators elig-
gested that if that were true, more man-
power should be assigned to the task. 
Burch relayed the senatorial complaints 
to the White House. 
Insulting Letter. St. Clair then re-
4rafted his letter, which was sent to 
ouse Judiciary ed Committee Counsel 
John Doar. Couch in condescending 
terms, it asked for two more weeks to 
"review" the requested rolarpiptiwod F 
? Clair said he "was pleased" with Doar 
for a letter on April 4 clarifying the ev-
idence sought. St. Clair wrote that this 
"goes a long way toward providing the 
additional specifications we felt were 
lacking in your original request." He 
said, "The additional material furnished 
' will permit the committee to complete 
its inquiry promptly," after this week's 
congressional Faster recess. He did not 
say what that "material" would be. Nix-
on thus was reserving to himself the de, 
cision on what he finally would yield. St. 
Clair also seemed to link any further fur-
nishing of evidence with his request that 
he be permitted to take part in the com-
mittee's impeachment deliberations. 
Democratic members of the com-
mittee considered the letter insulting, 
but most kept silent and let the Repub-
licans complain. "It was offensive to the 
House," protested Edward Hutchinson, 
the committee's ranking Republican. "If 
this is a ruse to prevent us from getting 
what we asked for, I don't want to fall 
for it," added Robert McClory, one of 
Nixon's staunchest backers on the com-
mittee. "The letter," conceded House 
Republican Leader John Rhodes in un-
derstatement, "left a great deal to be 
desired." 
Rhodes and other Republicans 
phoned St. Clair to tell him that a sub-
poena was imminent unless he gave 
more ground. Rodino, for his part, knew 
he had a majority in favor of issuing a 
subpoena. But he did not want the vote 
to be along party lines. He was also 
aware of three continuing sources of Re-
publican dissatisfaction with his han-
dling of the committee so far: 1) he had 
prevented any vote on whether St. Clair 
should represent the President during 
committee proceedings; 2) he had simi-
larly postponed any decision on the pro-
cedures the committee would follow as 
evidence on the President's conduct was 
considered; 3) he had not yet permitted 
a narrowing of the committee's inquiry, 
which included 56 areas of possible Nix-
on misconduct. Republicans were chaf-
ing under this Rodino rule. 
Rodino then moved adroitly to elim-
inate these sources of partisan tension. 
He announced that he would convene 
the committee in the first week after the 
Easter recess to "decide on whether and 
how the issues can be narrowed." He 
and the committee Democrats caucused 
and agreed that St. Clair would be per-
mitted to sit in on the presentation of ev-
idence. Rodino said he would also con-
vene the committee in the second week 
after the recess to "adopt rules to govern 
its procedures during the evidentiary 
hearings." 
A partisan split threatened again, 
however, when St. Clair made a desper-
ate last-minute attempt to arrange a deal 
with the committee. At 9:57 a.m., just 33 
, minutes before the committee was to 
consider the subpoena issue, St. Clair 
telephoned Doar. The review of the 
tapes, he now revealed, could be com-
pleted in "a day or two:: after all, and he 
would then "try" to provide the tapes 
specified in the first I 
if siAncut,77-0 
tieV 
1 
Clair asked: Wouldn't that make a sub-
poena unnek:essary? Replied Dear: "I 
cannot sp,;.ik for the committee." 
When the committee met, Doar re-
lated St. Clair's offer. Massachusetts 
Democrat Harold Donohue neverthe-
less quickly offered a motion to subpoe-
na all of the requested tapes by 
April 25. That is three days after the . 
end of the Easter recess, and it more 
than met St. Clair's original request for 
added time to review. Donohue then 
moved that debate on his motion be lim-
ited to a half-hour (less than a minute 
for each of the 38 members). That set 
off Republican complaints. 
Dilatory. Tactics. With partisan 
passions rising, Dear was asked his opin-
ion on whether St. Clair's belated offer 
was acceptable. "My recommendation," 
he replied in his flat, unemotional man-
ner, "is that the committee issue the sub-
poena for all six items today." Doar's 
patience and fairness in the inquiry so 
far has won respect among Republicans. 
Sonic then backed his view. Republicans 
Hamilton Fish Jr. and Lawrence Ho-
gan complained about the "dilatory tac-
tics" of St. Clair. Republican David 
Dennis nonetheless asked to subpoena 
only the first four items. Republican 
Delbert Latta, a Nixon loyalist, offered 
a motion that the subpoena be perfect-
ed by making the last two items more 
precise, apparently an attempt to delay 
a subpoena vote. 
Too Equivocal. Reacting cannily 
and quickly, Chairman Rodino saw a 
chance to diffuse the emotions. He asked 
Latta if he had any proposed clarifying 
language in writing. Caught short, Lat-
ta said it would require some time to pre-
pare. Rodino suggested that the com-
mittee should recess until afternoon, 
which would also, afford time for more 
extended debate. During the lunch hour, 
Latta searched for the ,proper wording 
for his amendment, finally adopted the 
language of a Doar memo explaining the 
last two items. Rodino gladly accepted 
it, declaring: "I'm not seeking a confron-
tation. I'm seeking evidence." 
? When the committee reconvened, 
Latta introduced his amendment, and 
it carried unanimously. The Republican 
resistance to subpoenaing all six items 
had virtually vanished. Robert McClory 
added a clinching revelation. He told 
the committee that during the lunch 
hour he had called St. Clair and asked 
whether Nixon's lawyer would put his 
latest offer in writing. St. Clair had re-
fused. 1VicClory's patience too thus had 
expired. "I think the offer is entirely too 
equivocal," he said of St. Clair's stand. 
When the roll was called, only three Re- . 
publicans dissented. Among them was 
Hutchinson, who explained later "One, 
the subpoena is unenforceable. Two, 
they offered to turn over voluntarily the 
material, and I think in the end would 
have turned it all over. And three, the 
subpoena is not returnable until after 
Easter, and they offered us some ma-
terial sooner." 
All of the subpoenaed evidence re-
lates to whether Nixon discouraged 
efforts to cover up the true origins of 
the Watergate wiretap-burglary and 
tried to "get the truth out," as he has

? Clair apparently was willing to turn 
over mostof the requested conversations 
covered by. the committee's first four 
requests, including talks among Nixon 
and his firmer aides, H.R. Haldeman, 
John Ehrlich man and John Dean, be-
tween Feb. 20 and March 20, 1973. 
He did hot, however, agree to yield 
most of the requested tapes after March 
21, when all parties agree that Dean 
told Nixon about the hush money and 
other, cover-up activities of the Pres-
ident's associates. Two of the subpoe-
naed items after that date involve Nix-
on's conversations with 1) Ehrlichman 
and Haldeman between April 14 and 
April 17, and 2) then Attorney Gen-
eral Richard Kleindienst and Henry 
Petersen, head of the Justice Depart-
ment's criminal division, between April 
15 and April 18. It was during this pe-
riod that the cover-up was unraveling. 
Opaque Response. The White 
House response to the subpoena was 
opaque and critical. Presidential Press 
Secretary Ronald Ziegler would say only 
that "additional material" would be sup-
plied by the due date of the subpoena 
and that this "will be comprehensive 
and conclusive in terms of the Presi-
dent's actions." The White House had 
not been stalling in delivering evidence, 
he insisted; any delay was due to the Ju-
diciary Committee's slowness in getting 
specific about its requests. 
The impact of the subpoena is still 
far from clear. Certainly, it further erod-
ed Nixon's standing in Congress, where 
the Judiciary Committee's careful ap-
proach to its unwanted and awesome 
duty has been well received. The sub-
poena will hardly help Nixon's stand-
ing in the court of public opinion. A Har-
ris poll showed last week that Nixon 
had gained five points in general approv-
al, to 31%; the poll was taken before his 
huge tax liability was announced. Har-
ris also reported that for the first time a 
plurality of Americans, 43% to 41%, feel 
that the President should be impeached 
and removed from office.

I have just seen the report in your issue

manipulative purposes. The Congress for

as is now well known, from American 
foundations many of which derived their 
funds from the CIA. Tho Congress assem-
bled writers and intellectuals who repre-
sented a wide variety of opinion: liberals, 
socialists, conservatives. Its resolutions?

TIME, APRIL 22, 1974 
Why Those Tapes Were Made 
Out of Mine own mouth will 1 judge 
thee. 
:?Luke 19:22 
One of the continuing ironies of Wa-
tergate is that Richard Nixon has be-
come increasingly entangled in the scan-
dal largely through a needless and 
voluntary creation of his own: his se-
cret system for recording nearly_ all of 
his official conversations. If his clandes-
tine tape recorders had not been silent-
ly capturing his words and those of his 
most intimate aides, he probably would 
not now be in so imminent a danger of 
impeachment. If he is finally forced out 
of office, it may well be largely due to 
those telltale tapes. Nearly forgotten in 
the endless struggles over access to those 
recordings is the question: Why did he 
ever install such a potentially dangerous 
system in the first place? 
Men close to Nixon are now in fair-
ly full agreement on the basic reasons. 
Foremost, according to them, was Nix-
on's awareness of history and his place 
in it. Nixon yearned to write one day a 
definitive work that would be the clas-
sic of presidential memoirs. With thou-
sands of his conversations in the White 
House and the Executive Office Build-
ing available for precise?if selective 
?quotation, he could produce a detailed 
and colorful narrative far beyond the ca-
pability of any of his predecessors. 
"More than most Presidents," recalls 
one of his former assistants, "Nixon 
spent a lot of time poring over what he 
said and did. It was vital to him to have 
an accurate record." Adds another aide: 
"Nixon wants a record of everything." 
? 
The wondrous gadgetry of the sys-
tem, with its tiny hidden m;kes, its voice-
actuated mechanism that required only 
a few spoken words to set x ecorder reels 
twirling in obscure recesses of the 
E.O.B., fascinated the President, his 
aides say. Moreover, what assistant 
could be more efficient than this om-
niscient and faithful monitor? Some 
presidential conversations, especially 
those with world leaders, were too im-
portant to permit misunderstandings. In 
the first 21/2 years of the Nixon pres-
idency, such advisers as Henry Kissin-
ger, H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlich-
man laboriously took notes at important 
meetings. All three soon became much 
too busy for that; the recording system, 
installed in the late spring of 1971, was 
a welcome substitute. 
But a common-sense question in-
trudes: Would Nixon speak in total can-
dor, knowing that his words were being 
preserved on tape? There is every in-
.dication that he did. Some investigators . 
who have heard many of the tapes have 
said that they were appalled by the de-
grading conversation?talk that they 
did not expect to hear at a presidential 
level. "I wish I had not heard it," sighed 
one listener. Part of the offensiveness lies 
in Nixon's well-known private penchant 
for locker room language. What is less 
well known and more bothersome are 
the bitter and sometimes savage epithets 
he aims at individuals who have in some 
way angered or crossed him, and these 
highly personal comments include flecks 
? of anti-Semitism.. 
Nixon's willingness to permit the re-
cording of such language or possibly in-
criminatory matbrial can be explained 
only by the hubris of the presidency, his 
absolute confidence that the tapes be-
longed to him and could never be wrest-
ed from him. The existence of the re-
corders was originally known only to a, 
few Secret Service technicians and three 
trusted aides: Haldeman, Lawrence --
Higby and Alexander Butterfield. It was 
Butterfield who startlingly revealed the 
system in response to a throwaway ques-
tion from a Senate Watergate-commit-
tee staff counsel on July 13. Even then 
the -I:resident must undoubtedly have 
felt that he could still protect the tapes 
with his claims of Executive privilege. 
Indeed, there had been discussions 
among those privy to the system about 
dismantling the recorders as early as six 
months after the Watergate burglary, 
and again when the cover-up began to 
unravel. But nothing was done. "He nev-
er in the world thought he would have 
to give up any of those tapes to any-
body," insists one White House source. 
Again common sense asks why, once 
the Watergate investigation began, Nix-
on did not destroy all of those tapes that 
even he concedes could be interpreted 
differently from the way he prefers? This 
could easily have been done before But-
terfield revealed their existence?or 
even after, up until the time some were 
subpoenaed. Nixon was certainly under 
no legal obligation to keep them before 
they became sought-after evidence. It 
would have been embarrassing, of 
course?but not criminal?to have de-
stroyed them in this interval. 
Some former Nixon associates offer 
a plausible theory to explain why the 
tapes were kept available in the White 
House as the Watergate scandal unfold-
ed and before the public was aware of 
the recording setup. If any member of 
the cover-up conspiracy were to make 
any false accusations about a talk with 
the President, Nixon could contend he 
had taped that conversation because he 
had felt it was especially important. 
Then he could produce the tape and de-
stroy the credibility of the witness. 
There is no clear indication yet of 
how damaging the tapes will prove to 
be for Nixon. Certainly his general re-
luctance to yield them to investigators 
has created widespread suspicion that 
they hurt rather than help his cause. So, 
too, has the report of a group of tech-
nical experts that part of one tape was 
deliberately erased. That conclusion is 
expected to be confirmed and strength-
ened when the panel presents its full sci-
entific analysis, probably this week, to 
Federal Judge John Sirica in Washing-
ton. So far, two other tapes have been de-
clared to be "nonexistent" by the White.. 
House. Never adequately explained has - been the fact that Haldeman checked 
out 22 tapes on April 25, 1973,-returned 
them the same day, then withdrew them 
again on April 26 and kept them until 
May 2. There is, indeed, still much to 
be explained about those fateful tapes 
that have contributed so much. to Rich-
ard Nixon's difficulties and cbuld even 
end his political career.

NIXON'S DILEMMA 
By Oe: aid Johnston 
Star-14 as Staff Writer 
It is gradually being real-
ized in the administration 
and on Capitol Hill that the 
impact of Watergate on for-
eign policy involves a great 
deal more than the survival 
of Richard Nixon's presi-
dency. 
The issue far transcends , 
questions of short-term po-
litical expediency ? for in-' 
stance, the apparent manip-
ulation of events that leads 
the White House to insist 
upon a June summit meet-
ing in Moscow even when it 
is increasingly evident that. 
impeachment proceedings 
in Congress will be ap-
proaching the crisg point' 
about then. 
, More to. the point, it is a 
question of whether the 
Nixon administration can. 
continue to carry out its 
responsibility to conduct a 
foreign policy on behalf of 
the United States under cir-
cumstances such as it finds 
itself in today. 
In the administration it-
. 
self, where a solid chorus of 
official voices for months, 
has insisted that Watergate 
and foreign policy have 
nothing to do with one an-
other, some discords can 
now be heard. 
Several weeks ago, a 
high-ranking official close 
to the ongoing strategic 
? armS negotiations with the 
Soviets was confiding to 
associates his fear that the 
impeachment proceedings 
had infected a new uncer-
tainty into the SALT nego-
tiations. The Soviets, this 
official concluded, are de-
termined to stall on the is-, 
sue until the impeachment' 
question is resolved. 
SECRETARY OF State, 
Henry A. Kissinger is stick-
ing close to the official line 
in public, but his denials 
that foreign policy has been 
affected by Watergate have 
become less sweeping of 
late. The President, Kissin-
ger told 'a group of report-
ers at the White House ?illy 
last week, "does not con-
duct himself as if he were in 
a position of weakness." 
Kissinger was addressing 
reporters in an effort to 
clarify his earlier admis- , 
sion, which he did note- , 
tract, that a comprehencMieor 
!ley Fears-.E.:se 
- detente policies are meeting 
resistance from a disparate 
coalition of conservatives, 
cold warriors, trade protec-
tionists and liberals whci 
abhor Soviet repression of? 
Jews and intellectuals. 
Some are hard-core adver-
saries of Nixon, others 
down-the-line Nixon loyal-
ists. Most deeply distrust 
the role of Kissinger. 
Interpretation 
SALT agreement is unlikely 
this year ? so the net effect 
of his remarks was nega-
tive. 
There is, further, growing 
evidence that Kissinger is 
deeply worried by the im-
pact of the coming impeach-
,ment crisis on the basic pol-
icy issues dividing the Unit--
' ed States and the Soviet 
Union: In addition to SALT, 
these include the controver-
sial trade package, the 
? troop reduction and East-. 
,'West security talks in Eu-
rope and the Middle East. ' 
A congressional, critic of. 
, administration detente poli-
;cies summed it up in a sar--
?donic aphorism recently: 
? "Kissinger's current line is 
to blame Watergate for the 
fact that the Russians are 
' behaving like Russians." 
,. In a more friendly setting, 
the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, Kissinger 
is understood to have ex-
plored the problems at 
length last week. During an 
' extended closed-door brief-
ing, Kissinger reportedly 
gave the committee a som-
? ber account of his recent 
trip to Moscow and im-
'pressed on the members the 
urgency, in his view, of a 
SALT agreement in the next 
two or three years. 
In the discussion, the 
growing weight of impeach-
ment as a factor in U.S.-
Soviet relations was a re-
curring subject, sources 
reported afterwards. One 
source ,close to the commit-
tee remarked that Kissin-
ger's failure in Moscow to 
achieve the "conceptual 
breakthrough" toward a 
SALT agreement, which he 
had forecast earlier, was 
confirmation that the Rus-
sians have decided to mark 
time on arms negotiations. 
until the fate of Nixon's 
presidency is known. 
TO THIS TURMOIL with-
in the administration's own' 
policy-making apparatus 
must be added the growing 
determination of Congress 
to exert its influence on for-
eign affairs, an influence 
that is increasingly weighty, 
as,the executive appears to 
weaken. 
Opposing them are liber-
als and centrists who be-
lieve relaxation of tension 
with the Soviets is a basic 
necessity for survival and 
who fear a renewal of the 
Cold War would be inevita-
ble if the Nixon-Kissinger 
detente policies are torpe-
doed. Their best hope/ ac-
cordingly, is a continuance 
of Kissinger's role as mas-
ter of U.S. foreign policy, no 
matter what happens to 
Nixon., 
These opposing currents 
are still ill-defined and have 
not crystallized into coher-
ent political movements. i 
But t is not too much of an 
oversimplification to say 
that Seh. Henry M. Jack-
son, D-Wash., has clearly 
'emerged as the leader of 
the first group, and that 
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
D-Mass., is moving into a 
position of prominence in 
the second. 
Running through this 
complex tangle ,of political 
notives, national security 
interests and personal am-
bitions are three basic 
themes, layered one upon 
another and in some degree 
influencing every current 
estimate of the nation's re-
lationship with the rest of, 
the world at a time of do-
mestic turbulence and un-
certainty: 
? Nixon's motives. Will a 
president weakened by 
Watergate and facing a So-
viet leadership that senses 
an historic opportunity for 
nuclear dominance, yield 
too much on SALT in order 
to preserve his popular 
image as a peacemaker? 
, Conversely, will Nixon, 
realizing he must rely on a 
nucleus of 34 hard-line con-
servatives to escape convic-
tion in an impeachment 
trial, revert to his Cold War 
persona of the 1950s as a 
man who "stands up to the 
But in Congress, also, Russians" and undercut his

crectLFOreFtelatinistddiM8/08 TICIA-RD P77-00432 RO 0 S1 
? 
? Soviet motives. Are the 
Soviets merely temperizing 
when they stall on SALT 
negotiations, or was the 
apparent bargaining rever-
sal during Kissinger's re-
cent Moscow trip a prelude 
to a new hard-line push' 
against a weakened U.S. 
leadership? 
Despite Pravda editorials 
denouncing Nixon's critics, 
does the Kremlin see the 
Nixon presidency near an 
end and are they preparing 
for President Ford? Will 
they try to do a deal now to 
forestall the emergence of 
Jackson as the Democratic 
candidate in 1976? Will their 
encouragement of Kenne-
dy's still undefined presi-
dential ambitions go beyond 
the current invitation to the 
reluctant Democratic front-
runner to visit Moscow this 
month? 
? Kissinger's motives. 
Under this heading come 
the substantive criticisms of 
administration foreign poli-
cy, especially Kissinger's 
efforts to recast U.S. rela-
tions with allies and adver-
saries alike in terms of 
achievable national inter-
ests rather than ideologies 
and mdralities. The ques-
tions here are posed by both 
Nixon loyalists and Nixon 
opponents, who alike can be 
counted on to use the Presi-
dent's difficulties against 
policies they dislike, aiming 
at Nixon's weakness when 
their real target is Kissin-
ger. 
One of the most cogent 
and, in its way, most sym-
pathetic assessments of 
Nixon's foreign policy ma 
tives came recently from an 
unlikely source: Rep. Les 
Aspin, a liberal Democrat 
from Wisconsin whose 
views on foreign and de-
fense policies are usually 
tinged with the academic-
intellectual' liberal ortho-
doxy Nixonn personally 
abhors. ?' 
ASPIN, URGING on his 
colleagues a sense-of-con-
gress resolution to keep 
Nixon away from summitry 
and out of vital foreign poli-
cy negotiations so long as 
the impeachment issue is 
unresolved, presented this 
analysis: 
"A FAKE CRISIS is bad 
00880008,411 there's some-
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100330008-3 
thing worse ? and that's a 
real one. What happens dur-
ing aniimpeachment trial if 
we really do have a confron-
tation\lwith the Soviet Un-
ion, Old when Mr. Nixon 
announces it to the nation, 
everyone thinks he's just 
playing politics? If this 
happens, there would clear-
ly be a\ temptation for the 
other side to raise the 
stakes, perhaps even to the 
point of creating a genuine 
nuclear showdown." 
Paradoxically, one of 
Nixon's theoretical defend-
ers on this point is Kennedy, 
who is beginning to assert a 
more high-profile image on 
foreign policy questions 
than he has up to now. 
Some political commenta-
tors are already suggesting 
Kennedy is preparing his 
ground for a concerted chal-
lenge to Jackson's presiden-
tial hopes as a harbinger of 
a renewed great-power ri-
valry with th Russians after 
Nixon's detente policies col-
lapse with his shattered 
presidency. 
Accordingly, Kennedy in 
an interview on the eve of 
his current extended trip to 
'Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union brushed' aside 
any suggestion that a well 
negotiated SALT agreement 
would suffer from Nixon's 
own political misfortunes. 
It would be a "catastroph-
ic mistake",for Nixon to try 
to ease the pressure of Wa., 
tergate by negotiating a 
"bad treaty" ? 'it wouldn't 
pass" when submitted to 
Senate ratification, Kenne-
dy warned. 
But, he added, "there 
would be overwhelming 
support for a good treaty, 
even if impeachment pro-
ceedings are well-ad-
vanced. 
Much harder on Nixon is 
Sen. James Buckley, the 
New York conservative who 
was counted a staunch Nix-
on loyalist until his 'unex-
pected call a month ago for 
the President to resign be-
fore an impeachment pro-
ceeding cripples the coun-
try. 
"I STRONGLY recom-
mend against a presidential 
visit to Moscow while im-
peachment proceedings are 
under way, Buckley said 
in a formal statement a 
week ago. Explaining after-
ward, Buckley stressed that 
he was passing no judgment 
on Nixon's possible motiva-
tions under the stress of an \ 
impeachment proceeding, 
such as Aspin sought to put 
forward. 
Rather, he was worried 
about the appearance of a 
weakened President in

RUSSIANS  
IMPEACHMENT MD 
Press Mentions Anti-Nixon 
Moves in Congress for 
First Time in Months 
, 
Shedd to The New Yorlt Timer 
MOSCOW, April 12?The So-
'vie t press, in a new sign of 
uneasiness over President Nix-
on's future, reported today for 
the first time in months on 
Congressional moves for im-
peachment. \ 
' The mere mention of the is-
sue, which had not been raised 
explicitly since November, was 
regarded as an indicator that 
Moscow was taking the pros-
pects of impeachment much 
more seriously than before and 
was concerned about repercus-
sions on Soviet-American rela-
tions. 
The news appeared as Amer--
Can officials disclosed that the 
Soviet leadership had privately 
expressed serious worry in the 
last few days over the pros-
pects for American trade 
credits. ? 
Pessimistic on Tariffs 
Belatedly recognizing Mr. 
Nixon's lack of influence with 
Congress on the trade bill, the 
Soviet leader, Leooid I. Brezh-
nev,, and other high offiicals 
were pictured this week as 
being somewhat reconciled to 
not receiving reduced tariffs. 
But in talks with Secretary 
of Commerce Frederick B. Dent 
earlier this week, the Soviet 
head-to-head neogitatioii 
with the Soviets, and 'how 
this would -seem to U.S. al-
lies in Western urope. 
Buckley's basic assump-
tion ? that the Soviets have 
decided on a harder line as 
a result of Nixon's troubles 
? is widely held among 
those who hold detente poli-
cies suspect, but it is echoed 
also by those who see in the 
administration's foreign 
policies its only claim for 
distinction. 
The recurrent theme 
here is that if the soviets 
are not actually pressing an 
imagined bargaining advan-
tage against a weakened 
president, they are at least 
stalling until the -crisis is 
over. 
? 
'ACCORDINGLY, that 
note of caution underscored 
1/4last week's unusual mes-
sage of confidency to Kis-
singer from a bipartisan 
group of senators ? includ-
ing majority leader Mike 
Mansfield, minority leader 
Hugh Scott, Charles McC, 
Mathias, R-Md., and Walter 
F. Mondale, 137Minn. ? 
leaders were said to have been 
disturbed at the prospect that 
Congress might block further 
credits from the Export-Import 
tank. 
In general, influential Soviet 
circles have lately displayed in 
one way or another increasing 
concern over Mr. Nixon'e 
domestic difficulties and their 
likely impact. on Soviet-Ameri-
can relations. 
Kissinger Statement Worrisome 
Secretary of State Kissinger's 
statement discounting the like-
lihood of a majer agreement on 
strategic arms during President 
Nixon's scheduled June visit is 
.also likely to bother Moscow, 
which has been taking a more 
optimistic line. 
In a move that suggested 
that Moscow was more anxious 
than before to maintain contact 
with the Democratic opposition, 
usually well-informed sources 
said that Senator Edward M. 
Kennedy would probably be re-
ceived by Mr. Brezhnev and 
other high officials here next 
week. 
Nonetheless, some segments 
of the Soviet press, displaying 
obvious sympathy for Mr. Nix-
on, have been quite shrill lately 
In chiding his domestic critics. 
Izvestia, the Government 
newspaper, reported last Friday 
that the President had been re-
quired to pay $432,787 in back 
taxes. It charged that the mat-
ter was being thcploited by 
politicians and publications hos-
tile to the President, who were 
conducting campaigns against 
him. 
Impeachment Hearings Noted 
. Today's report, in the 
foreign-affairs weekly Novoye 
Vremya was the first, however, 
to link "th4 income-tax scan-
dal" to pressures for impeach-
ment?a topic not dealt with 
so :directly in the Soviet press 
since November. 
Without explaining what im-
peachment is, the 'magazine 
reported that the House Judi-
ciary Committee was expected 
to start hearings on April 22 
or 23 to determine whether 
sufficient grounds existed for 
Impeachment. 
It said that the hearings 
would last until mid-June, 
'before the scheduled date of 
Mr. Nixon's visit. 
The magazine concluded by 
quoting Vice President Ford as 
having said at a press confer-
ence that he did not see any 
constitutional basis for im-
peachment of Mr. Nixon. 
Another foreign-policy week-
13r charged that the President's 
/domestic critics were trying to 
cripple his negotiating power 
with the Soviet Union with the 
aim of "putting a mine under 
future Soviet-American nego-
tiations." 
The weekly, Za Rubezhom, 
directed its attack mainly at 
-Representative Les Aspin, a 
Wisconsin Democrat, for hav-
ing proposed legislation that 
would bar. Mr. Nixon from 
reaching agreements that did 
not automatically require Con-
gressional approval.

Nixon's Difficulties 
Likened in Moscow 
To Lincoln Murder 
By. CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 
Special to The New York Times 
MOSCOW, April 15?A Corn-
manist youth newspaper here 
has drawn what appears to be 
a :?veiled parallel between the 
assassination of Abriham Lin-
coln and what it described as 
a press campaign against Pres-
ident Nixon. 
Both the 1865 murder of Lin-
coln and press hostility toward 
Mr. Nixon were designed to 
elijninate political opponents 
from the American scene and 
thhs change the course of his-
tory, the newspaper, Kom-
somolskaya Pravda, seemed to 
suggest yesterday in commem-
orating the 109th anniversary 
or Lincoln's assassination. 
Contending that the ?event 
was reflected in "current po-
litical life in the United States," 
the organ of the Young Com-
munist League said the assas-
sination represented "almost 
the first major act of violent 
interference by reactionaries 
with the- historical course of 
the American people." 
Komsomolskaya Pravda did 
not mention Mr. Nixon by 
name. But in several references 
it 'implied that his domestic 
problems .were similar to those 
that had contributed to Mr. 
Lincoln's death. The most 
prbminent mentioned was hos-
tility of the American press 
toivard President Nixon. 
The controlled Soviet press 
hal generally avoided mention 
of :the Watergate affair in de-
ference to Mr. Nixon's Rapport 
wi h the Kremlin leadership. 
omsovolskaya Pravda ob. 
served that "in the arsenal of 
re,ection, the bullet of the hired 
or fanatical killer is the ex-
treme but not the only means 
of eliminating poltical oppo-
nants from the scene." 
'It said that the American 
press had set the stage for Lin-
coin's assassination by being 
"especially zealous" in attack-
ing him. 
"Again and again reaction-
aries have repeated their des-
perate gamble in the belief that, 
having eliminated a president 
(by whatever means) whose 
policy did not suit them, they 
would be able to turn back 
the course of history," KoM-
sovolskaya Pravda said. 
It recalled that Lincoln, be-
fore he was killed, had tried 
to improve relations between 
the United States and Russia.

Cuts That C.I.A. Sought. in Book Touch on  Official Slips 
By ERIC PACE 
The C.I.A. tried to censor 
from 't a forthcoming book 
about*,the agency slips of the 
tongue\ by the then Vice Presi-
dent Agnew and the then 
CIA. chief, Richard M. Helms, 
that sAmed to betray ignor-
ance of foreign affairs, a New 
York publisher has disclosed. 
The Central Intelligence 
Agency demanded last year 
that 339 passages be cut from 
the book, "The C.I.A. and the 
Cult of 'Intelligence," written 
by Victor Marchetti, a former 
C.I.A. employe, and John 
Marks, a former State Depart-
ment employe. But a Federal 
judge has ruled that the pub-
lisher, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 
can bring it out with only 27 
cuts despite the government's 
contention that publication 
would injure the national de-
fense. 
As disclosed by Knopf, 
though, some of the other, ear-
lier cuts that were demanded 
seem merely embarrassing to 
the agency or to the Adminis-
tration, such as this description 
of a Cabinet-level meeting at-
tended by President Nixon: 
"Vice President Spiro Ag-
new gave an Impassioned 
speech on how the .South Af-
rican, pow that they had re-
cently declared their indepen-
dence, were not about to be 
pushed around, and he went 
on to compare South Africa to 
the United States in its in-
fant days. Finally, the Presi-

dent leaned over to Agnew 
and said gently, 'You mean 
Rhodesia,- don't you, Ted?" 
Another deleted passage 
which referred to Mr. Helms at 
a National Security Council 
meeting in. 1969, went as 'fol-
lows: 
. "His otherwise .flawless per-
formance was marred only by 
his mispronounciation of 'Mala-
gasy' (formerly ? Madagascar) 
when referring, to the young 
republic." 
The C.I.A.'s blue pencil also 
affected disclosures in the book 
that are reported in the current 
issue of Time magazine; and 
were characterized as, "doubt-
less authentic" by an intelli-
gence expert in Washington 
yesterday: 
Time says the book recounts 
tin the ninteen-sixties the agen-
cy helped the Government of 
'President Fernando Belaunde 
Terry of Peru to crush a local 
insurgent movement by build-
ing a jungle military installa-
tion and recruiting an anti-
guerrilla unit. 
The book also reports that 
the agency learned of an air-
plane-hijacking by Brazilian ra-
dicals?but let the hijacking 
take place so as not to betray 
its knowledge Of Brazilian guer-

Trying to Expose the CIA 
The controversy is not a cause 
c?bre of the proportions of the Pen-
tagon papers, but for two years the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency has employed 
its wits, wiles and considerable manpow-
er in an effort to stop publication of large 
chunks of a book called The CIA and 
the Cult of Intelligence. The agency has 
fought so hard because the book's prin-
cipal author, Victor Marchetti, 44, was 
a CIA officer with access to much secret 
material and a zeal to reveal it. Although 
its reliability will be questioned, the book 
is the most detailed expos6 of CIA tac-
tics to date and is bound to pose em-
barrassing questions about the aims and 
activities of American espionage. 
The book is still involved in a legal 
tangle. The CIA is contending that, as 
the result of a contract that every CIA 
employee signs. Marchetti has no right 
to publish any material that the agency 
deems. classified. Nonetheless the bOok 
; will be published this June?in a most 
unusual form. Blank spaces will appear 
where 168 passages have been deleted 
at C/A insistence, and the courts have 
not yet finally resolved whether or not 
the missing material deserves national-
security classification. A larger number

bers of an ethnic group in Viet-
nam, the Nungs, who were 
hired by the C.I.A. and sent on 
forays along the Ho Chi Minh 
trail. The passage says: 
"Since most of the Nungs 
were illiterate and had great 
difficulty in sending back quick, 
accurate reports of what, they 
saw, the C.I.A. technicians de, 
veloped a special kind of radio 
transmitter for their use. 
' "Each transmitter had a set 
'of buttons corresponding to pic-
tures of a tank, a truck, an 
artillery ,piece or some other 
military-related object. ?Whea 
the Nung trail-watcher sawi a 
Vietcong convoy, he , would 
push the appropriate button as 
many times as he counted such 
objects go by him. 
Each push sent a specially 
coded impulse back to a base 
camp which could in this way 
kepi) a running account of sup-
ply movements on the trail. In 
some instances, the signals 
would be recorded by observa-
tion planes that would relay 
the information to attack air 
,craft for immediate bombing 
raids on the trail." 
Several other of the original 
cuts, as reported by Knopf, in-
volved assertions that the C.! A. 
had sent "special operations" 
personnel to Bolivia "to assiSt 
Ilocal forces in dealing With 
the rebel movement." The beok 
also reports that a C.I.A. opera-
tive tried in vain, 'to prevent 
the Bolivian authorities from 
having Ernesto Che, the rebel 
will be included; they will be printed in 
boldface type so that a reader can read-
ily identify those tales, statistics and 
names that the CIA would just as soon 
not have had made public. 
Some of the boldface incidents have 
appeared in print before or were gen-
erally known: the agency's loan of V-26 
bombers and CIA pilots for the uprising 
against Indonesian President Sukarno in 
the late 1950s, the drifting of balloons 
laden with propaganda over mainland 
China during the Cultural Revolution, 
the training of the Dalai Lama's moun-
taineer troops when they were driven 
out of Tibet in 1959 by the Chinese Com-
munists. But often the book adds fresh 
detail. For example, in tine of their pe-
riodic raids on their homeland, the 
hardy Tibetans helped resolve a debate 
that had been going on CIA headquar-
ters in Washington: they captured doc-
uments showing that Mao Tse-tung's 
Great Leap Forward had been a flop. 
Other episodes in the book are set 
down for the first titne, and some of them 
will provide fuel for critics of the agen-
cy and perhaps trigger unpleasant ca-
bles to Henry Kissinger from foreign 
capitals. A likely instance is the book's 
recounting of how in the mid-1960s the 
leader, executed. 
'Another of the cuts involved 
a passage describing agency-
Organized "guerrilla . raids 
against North Vietnam, with 
special emphasis on intrusions 
by sea-borne commando 
groups"?although that at pect 
of the agency's operations had 
been disclosed before.,

passage reports that in1969 the agency 
learned of a scheme by radicals to hi-
jack a Brazilian airliner. The CIA kept 
the news to itself for fear that it would 
expose the agency's penetration of Bra-

to capture him. The plane was hijacked 
on schedule--and Marighella was

contrary to the general impression, the 
CIA devotes about two-thirds of its annu-
al budget of some $750 million to covert 
operations and only 10% to intelligence 
gathering. The $750 million, moreover, 
is merely part of the money spent on the 
CIA. The Pentagon contributes hundreds 
of millions of dollars for technical proj-
ects that do not show up in the CIA bud-
get. The Air Force, for example, funds 
the overhead-reconnaissance program 
?mostly spy satellites?for the entire 
U.S. intelligence community. Though 
the CIA conducted a secret war in Laos 
for more than a decade, the bulk of the 
$500 million spent each year was stip-
plied by the Defense Department. 4a-

Asia and others?which gen-
erate tens of millions of dol-
lars every year by providing 
charter service for Govern-
ment agencies. 
For anyone not privy to 
the CIA'S files, it is difficult 
to judge just how accurate the 
book is. The original manu-
script was censored under the 
guidance of four CIA deputy 
directors. The CIA refuses to 
attest to or deny any portion 
of the book, and the court rec-
ord is mixed on the point. 
During the long court battle. 
one of the deputy directors, 
, William E. Nelson, deposed 
I that he had not deleted any 
material on grounds of inac-
curacy because "untrue [ma-
terial] per se isn't classified." 
Yet another deputy director 
argued the opposite, claiming 
that false material could be 
classified and that there were errors in 
some portions that he censored. Says a 
high-ranking agency official: "Some of 
the book is true, some of it is slightly 
wrong, and a lot of it is totally wrong. 
Marchetti has strung a few facts togeth-
er and done a lot of hypothesizing." 
The authors, to put it mildly, are not 
sympathetic to the CIA. Marchetti, who 
is responsible for most of the book, and 
Co-Author John Marks, 31, a former 
Foreign Service officer, believe that the 
agency should not intervene in other na-
tions' affairs in any circumstances. 
Pointing out the inefficiency of many 
,CIA missions, the authors would restrict _ 
; the agency to intelligence gathering and 
, strip it of all its covert operations. That I 
argument is sure to be aired fully once 
' the book is published; for now, the CIA 
'is arguing that the book is dangerous 
on narrower if no less vital grounds. It 
fears that the book will expose secret op-
erations and covers, jeopardize if not 
eliminate relations with foreign secret 
' services, and encourage other disgrun-
tled employees to spill what they know 
or claim to know about the agency. The 
' conflict is yet another example of the 
public's "right to know" v. the national 
interest; there is no easy answer. 
For most of his 14 years with the 
'CIA, Marchetti was a bright young agent 
on the way up. After serving with U.S. 
Army intelligence in West Germany 
during the early '50s, he returned to 
Penn State to major in Soviet studies. Be-
cause of his background, he was recruit-
ed for the CIA. He spent a year in train-
ing in covert operations, then became 
a 
an intelligence analyst, concentrating 
, largely on Soviet military matters. In 
11968, he was named executive assistant 
, to the agency's deputy director, Admi-
ral Rufus Taylor. If he seemed to be 
something of a Boy Scout to his col-
leagues, it was appropriate that Scouts 
first caused him to have misgivings 
about his employment. 
Sour Belly. While he was working 
with community organizations, he re-
calls, "Eagle Scouts came around with 
their lohg hair telling me they were not 
going to Viet Nam. I had a hard time ar-
guing with them. It seemed to me that 
the world was changing quite a bit, and 
neither the CIA nor the Government was 
changing along with it." 
Disillusioned, he quit the CIA in 
1969, but stayed quiet. "I didn't feel free 
to speak at the time," he says. "I was 
too well trained." Instead, he wrote a 
veiled expos?a novel called The Rope-
Dancer, in which the head of an Amer-
ican intelligence agency turns out to be 
working for the Russians. The book was 
not widely noticed, but the agency com-
municated its displeasure to the author. 
Undeterred, Marchetti decided in the 
spring of 1972 to tell all?or almost all. 
An enterprising literary agent, David 
Obst, who is also the agent for Water-
gate reporters Bob Woodward and Carl 
Bernstein (see THE PRESS) and Daniel-
Ellsberg, held an auction for the rights 
to Marchetti's book. Alfred A. Knopf 
Inc. was the winner. One of the losers 
leaked the outline to the CIA, which con 
sidcred Marchetti to be a turncoat who 
had developed a "sour belly" over U.S. 
intervention in Southeast Asia. 
A month later, two federal agents, 
whom Marchetti dubbed Marshal Dil 
Ion and. Chester, appeared at his door 
with a temporary restraining order for-
bidding him to show the manuscript to 
the publisher until the CIA had exam-
ined it. The agency based its position 
on the contract restricting present or 
past employees from revealing anything 
about agency operations without first 
getting its consent. Marchetti phoned 
the American Civil Liberties Union, 
which went to trial on his behalf. It ar-
gued that the CIA was exercising prior 
restraint?preventing publication?and 
thereby violating the First Amendment. 
But the U.S. District Court Judge Al-
bert V. Bryan Jr. ruled that the First 
Amendment did not apply in the case 
of contractual obligations. Marchetti 
lost on appeal, and the U.S. Supreme 
Court declined to hear the case. 
Almost ready to, abandon his proj-
ect, Marchetti met John Marks, who was

tion, said Ashbrook, "was canceled after the cover 
on the operation was blown by an 'advocacy journal-
ist.' " ? ? 
Media pressures, argued Ashbrook, have had a 
baleful influenee, over our internal security Opera-
tions as well. "The Subversive Activities Control 
' Board, which had the responsibility of holding hear-
ings on and citing Communist fronts, has been 
abolished.... 
"The Internal Security Division or the Depart-

the Criminal Division. Police departments 
throughout the country that hate done -valuable 
work in watching the violence-prone radicals 
have cut hack on their operations and in many 
cases have closed down their intelligence units." 
These cutbacks, charged Ashbrdok, "have often ' 
resulted from journalistic attacks which panicked ! 
timid city fathers. Or as in New York, where (Mayor 
, John] Lindsay used it as an excuse for wholesale I 
destruction of valuable files on violent organizations.: 
"The Army has stopped 'watching civilians. The 
Pentagon brass retreated when their surveillance of! 
; subversives was attacked by the Senate Subcommit-
tee on Constitutional Rights, chaired by Sen. Sam ' 
Ervin, and the hysterical elements in the press." 
Army surveillance, Ashbrook asserted, had proved

'invaluable in gathering critical facts on subversives 
and potential rioters and in keeping police and na-

for the Ervin committee "and a hpro to the press was ? 
John M. 'O'Brien, a former military intelligence 
_agent who alleged that the military had engaged in 
'widespread surveillance of innocent civilian activity 
and. had used illegal methods to accomplish this." 
Yet the first opportunity anyone had to cross-
examine O'Brien, said Ashbrook, suggested that he 
was less than a totally reliable witness. 
After he testified for the defense last November 
in the "Chicago 7" contempt case, Federal Judge 
Edward T. dignoux-concluded that "Mr. O'B-rten's 
testimony was flatly repudiated in all presently sig-
nificant aspects.... The Court rejects as utterly in-
credible the testimony of Mr. O'Brien." 
Just how far the military has retreated in the face 
of media pressure, said Ashbrook, was revealed in 
November 1971 when Rowland A. Morrow. the di-
rector of the Defense Investigation Program Office,

have been active in subverting the military. 
Morrow admitted, said Ashbrook, that we have 
reached the point where d member of the Armed 
Forces who leaves a military post to attend a sub-
versive meeting cannot be observed by military in-
, telligence. ? 
"As you know," said Ashbrook, "the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation has the primary responsibil-
ity in the investigation of subversive activities. In 
the past, this work has been enhanced by the activi-
ties of military intelligence, local police departments 
and congressional committees. Now, even the FBI's! 
responsibility to do this important work is under 
attack. 
"All security conscious people breathed a sigh of 
relief when William Ruckelshaus was forced out of 
the Justice Department. On Sept. 13, 1973, during 
his confirmation hearing to be Deputy Attorney' 
General, Ruckelshaus twice referred to his plan to 
separate intelligence-gathering from the law 
enforcement functions of the FBI.' Translated from 
'government gobbledygook into English, this means 
getting the FBI out of the field of investigating 
subversion." ? 
But* Ashbrook implied that such disastrous 
schemes are frequently promoted by the media. In 
the Ohioan's view, then, the media deserves no small 
share of the blame for the increasing weakness of 
America's internal security apparatus. 
John T. Downey, who spent 21 years in a, 
Chinese prison camp on espionage charges, says 
he is "pretty content-wit my life now" as a stu-
dent at Harvard Law School and he plans to be-
come a small town lawyer. Downey, 43, along '

, AN INTERVIEW WITH VICTOR MARCHETTI 
GORDON PETERSON: A U. S. district court judge has 
handed the Central Intelligence Agency a setback in -:cs battle 
to keep the lid not only on its covert activities, but on what 
its former employees say about the agency. Judge Albert Bryan 
ruled that the CIA exceeded its authority in ordering many deletions 
from a book on the CIA by a former CIA intelligence officer, 
IVictor Marchetti, and former State Department intelligenc..1 officer, 
John Marks. In effect, the judge ruled that the CIA cannot 
declare something classified simply by saying it ought to be 
classified. 
Two years ago, Judge Bryan had ruled that the CIA 
did have a right to censor Marchetti's manuscript. At that 
time, it hadn't even been written. 
I talked to Marchetti at his suburban Virginia home 
today. 
VICTOR MARCHETTI: The book is both a critique of 
the CIA and the U. S. intelligence community. But it also points 
out that the intelligence is a necessary function and that some 
of the things the agency does are worthwhile and should be continued. 
The criticism is that -- focused on what is known 
as the covert action activities. This is propaganda, paramilitary 
activities, disinformation, the penetration of various student 
and cultural groups; the things that are usually described as 
dirty tricks. 
PETERSON: Well, as I recall, the CIA was after you 
to stop publication of this book even before you had any of 
it down on paper. Is that right? 
MARCHETTI: That's correct. About two years ago when 
.they learned that I was going to write this book, I had first 
written a novel called "The Rope Dancer," in which I was critical 
f the agency in a fictional fashion. When I decided to go 
onfiction and they found out about it, they immediately took 
e to court and managed to get a permanent injunction against 
e, so that as of today, anything I write about the CIA or intelligence 
actual, fictional, or otherwise, must first be given to the 
IA for censorship. 
PETERSON: Is that true even in the light of this 
ost recent court decision? 
MARCHETTI: Yes, the injunction has not changed. 
11 that the judge has done -- we won a great victory. But 
hat he has done is he has let the injunction stand while saying 
hat, in this particular instance, the CIA has been unreasonable 
nq arbitrary in its attempt to censor my book. And so he reduced

their request for three hundred ?.roughly three hundred and 
forty deletions down to something like twenty. 
PETERSON: What were some of the things they wanted 
tq" delete? 
MARCHETTI: Well, because we're under -- still under 
,a protective order, I can only generalize about these things. --
But it's references to the CIA's activities in Chile in the.. 
overthrow of the Allende government; references to the CIA's 
relationships with certain leaders of foreign governments; references 
to various activities such as propaganda and disinformation, , 
sponsoring books, for example, that are aimed at exposing, say, 
the KGB, for example, but, in the process of doing that, th.ey're 
also propagandizing the American public. 
And it's a wide variety of matters that they tried 
Ito stop. In essence, whenever I would make a general criticism 
;in the book and then try to support it with specific examples 
ifrom my experience and those of other officers whom I knew, 
!these were the things they tried to take out, the examples. 
PETERSON: Under the heading of national security? 
MARCHETTI: Under the heading of national security. 
PETERSON: I understand that Mr. Colby, the Director 
of the CIA, is suggesting legislation to tighten up security 
in government. 
MARCHETTI: Yes, he is. He has drafted a bill which 
the administration, I assume, is going to shortly submit to 
Congress. There will be, in effect, the same thing as the British 
National Secrets Act that will give the government carte blanche 
on maintaining secrecy, particularly with regard to former personnel. 
But already the FBI has informed its agents that if 
they speak out that they will be prosecuted under the Marchetti 
precedent. So it's getting a little spooky. I mean if they 
can beat me down and pass this new law, you'll have more secrecy 
In government than ever before, and that's bad. 
PETERSON: Marchetti says he'll continue his fight 
for release of the book, which is to be published by Alfred 
A. Knopf under the title, "The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence."

AN INTERVIEW WITH JOHN MARKS  
Washington, D.C. 
- MIKE WATERS: For the last two years the CIA has been 
blocking publication of many sections of a book about intelligence 
activities. It's co-authored by a former CIA agent and former 
State Department employee. 
On Friday Judge Albert Bryan Jr. ruled that only 15 
of the 162 CIA-censored portions of the book should not be published 
on grounds of national security. 
John Marks, one of the co-authors, learned of the 
court's decision today. Judy Miller interviewed him this afternoon 
In our studios. ? 
' JUDY MILLER: Mr. Marks, the CIA seems to have suffered 
a major defeat in their efforts to censor Victor Marchetti 's 
and your book on the CIA. What, in effect, has Judge Albert 
Bryan decided? 
JOHN MARKS: Well, we got word today that Judge Bryan 
has decided that of the 162 items that the CIA demanded be censored 
from our book, that 147 of them would be returned to us. In 
other words, the CIA now is only successful in censoring 15 
items, not 162. And I can say we're very happy about this decision. 
MILLER: What kind of items were censored and what 
reasons were given for their being censored? 
MARKS: Well, the CIA in court didn't give very many 
reasons at all. They essentially said, "We know what the national 
security of the United States is and it is up to us to decide 
,what items contravene or hurt the national security, and we 
say these items are bad and therefore they're bad. 
They were things that discussed, for instance, the 
1CIA's role in Chile in 1970, the CIA's black propaganda efforts 
around the world, the CIA's use of dummy front companies, in 
other words, companies that are supposedly private, but actually 
!belong to CIA. Things of that sort. 
1MILLER: And how many items will now remain censored 
from your book and how will your plublishing company handle the 
'deletion of these items? 
1 MARKS: Well, were not exactly sure on how we're 
igoing to handle them because the decision just came through 
i 
,today.  We were originally planning to publish a book that had 
Iblank spaces spread across its pages. I've just seen the gallye 
'proofs and it's quite impressive. I mean some pages are all 
'white. 
But now with this material returned, I think what

'we're going to do is put it in, but in bold-face type so the 
public can see the kind of material that the CIA did not want, 
ip the book. 
I 1 
Incidentally, I might add that the government still 
114s the option to appeal this, and considering the unprecedented 
ilegal effort that they've gone through in the last two years 
itd block publication of this book, I would be very surprised 
.1-n they didn't appeal. But we're hopeful that the appelate 
coisrts will quickly clear the material because Judge Bryan made 
a decision and under the terms of the laws and the injunction 
he was working under and everything of that sort -- that we 
were working under and that sort -- and I think that it would 
be unlikely that an appelate court is going to overthrow. ' 
MILLER: What kind of evidence did the CIA present 
to the court that the information that you wanted to publish 
was in fact classified? 
MARKS: Their main tactic was to bring in front of 
the court -- and I might add it was a closed courtroom, at the 
insistence of CIA, but they brought in the four deputy directors 
of the agency who said, "We are men who are authorized to classify 
material and we hereby say that this material is classified." 
And they didn't submit much evidence beyond that, 
though they did put various pieces of paper on the record, on 
the secret record, which supposedly showed why the information --
that the information was in fact classified, but the judge carefully 
read through that information and he found only in 15 cases 
I 
did it prove the fact of classification.  
MILLER: Is this a total victory for ?you and Victor 
'Marchetti, or do you feel there's still something that has to 
be done? 
MARKS: Well, in practical terms, it's a very large 
victory for-us, but on First Amendment grounds, we won absolutely

MILLER: How so? 
MARKS: Well, the judge did not address the fact of 
whether or not the CIA had the right to censor our book. All 
he addressed was the question of whether they had properly or 
improperly censored, and he ruled that in the large part they 
improperly censored it. But we feel that under the First Amendment, 
that the government has no right to censor our book and that 
this whole framework of censorship we've been working under 
Is unconstitutional. 
You might remember that the reason the government 
says they have the right to censor is that Marchetti used to 
work for the CIA and I used to work for the State Department, 
land when we joined our respective agencies, we called what are 
!called secrecy agreements in which we signed a piece of p'per 
!saying we would not reveal any information without the permission 
of the governmentAnd the government's position all along 
has been that they are trying to enforce a contract, the contract 
being that secrecy agreement and it has nothing to do with the 
First Amendment. 
Our position is that you can't sign a piece of paper 
that signs away your First Amendment rights.

IA ssiers on 
By Jack Taylor 
The In1liencAencv 
keeps dossiers on American tourists, some of 
whom are asked to act as part-time spies dur-?,,-
? ing trips abroad, The Sunday ;Oklahoman has 
? ?learned, ? ? ? 
There are indications the same files are 
; used for loyalty checks by other government 
: agencies interested in whether a particular in-
dividual can be considered a "team player." 
Such a scenario was indicated in a newly. 
: disclosed Defense Depahment document and-
: confirmed in an interview with a former CIA-. 
officer. 
It has been known for some time that CIA 
agents often interview returning tourists who 
may have picked up useful information while 
;'overseas. 
i? But it has not been generally known that the 
! CIA apparently. approaches tourists in ad-
vance, suggesting they volunteer for specific, 
!t,missions. generally miner in nature. 
! And there has never been an indication that 
, the intelligence agency keeps track of who has 
.or has not cooperated, with such lists used for 
'loyalty checks ; ? . . _?. 
. , A CIA spokesman acknowledged the long-
standing practice of interviewing returning 
! tourists, but refused to discuss whether ad-
vance coritact is made with overseas travel-
ers. 
??- ? 
; The spokesman did admit such a tactic is 
probable, but stressed that any such activity 
on the part of tourists would be strictly volun-
lary.. 
One former CIA official told The Oklahoman. 
; the agency began the program of contacting, 
; tourists in advance of trips abroad in the 
1950s.. 
The agency would ask the tourists to take on 
: specific chores without jeopardizing them-
selves?tasks such as picking up road maps, , 
?taking photographs and so on. 
? Occasionally, some of those tourists would ; 
!. be arrested and kicked out of the country in 
which they were traveling, the tamer agent I 
said. 11 
Ile said the Soviet Union's accusations of es- 'I 
pionage against some participants in the Hel-
sinki Youth Conference in the early 1960s was 
; partially valid ; because they had undertaken 
, certain CIA-suggested chores. ? 
The former CIA agent said, however, he did' 
not know the agency may be keeping track of 
.such assistance for possible loyalty checks. .

The directive had been:

CIA director, readily ac-

, but was less candid on ad-,

J3OURNALIST 'SPIES' 
Your righteously indignant editorial con-
cerning the 40 Central Intelligence Agency 
persons employed in news media capacities 
overseas surprised me. 
It is a reasonable assumption that there 
arc at least 400 trained intelligence agents 
employed ir news capacities inside the 
U.S., and the figure may well be closer to 
4,000. 
It is further reasonable to assume that 
substantial numbers of these men and 
women?if not all?are, or have occasionally 
been employed in intelligence contract work 
while functioning publicly as reporters, edi-
tors and publishers of newspapers or broad-
casting stations. 
The U.S. government has trained thou-
sands of men and women during and since 
World War II for clandestine operations 
in the intelligence branches of the Army, 
Navy, Air Force and State Department and 
Department of Defense in addition to the 
CIA and other intelligence units. Addi-
tional thousands have received other kinds 
of intelligence training, all of it quite 
rigorous. ? 
These men and women may well resign, 
retire or be discharged from formal duties, 
but no one who ever took the oath to serve 
the country and obey the provisions of the 
U.S. secrets act, formally known as Title 
18, ever really leaves that service in the 
; ultimate sense except by death or imprison-
ment or incarceration in a mental hospital. 
, Thus, when some service needs them, 
. they usually respond by serving. . 
And news people are in an ideal situa-
tion to perform useful intelligence and 
counter-intelligence service. 
I think your indignation is misplaced. 
It is possible such government service 
1 might compromise some noble journalistic 
ethic but it seems to me' to be unlikely. 
And in a free country how else could 
your government agencies defend you and 
against similar incursions by foreign gov-
ernments, including the USSR and China, 
who, incidentally, can secure phenomenally 
valuable intelligence about our military, in-
dustrial, economic and social weaknesses 
I and strengths ' by detailed intelligence 
' analysis of daily newspapers and news 
I broadcasts. 
i Any intelligent person who thinks about 
i the true meaning of government intelligence 
i values can find a dozen breaches of good 
1 judgement on someone's part concerning 
i military secrets and ' other useful-to-an-
Ienemy information in any daily newspaper 
of even medium size. 
! We are grateful for the Constitutional 
guarantee of a free press in the U.S., and 
. we should be, but that very freedom allows 
the uncontrolled hazards to our national . 
well being to exist. 
WASHINGTON POST - 
Jack Anderson ? 24 MA R 7974 
No one who loves freedom will suggest 
the hazard should be eliminated, least of 
all me. 
' But le51; us hear no more prattle about 
infiltratiop of news media' by U.S. intelli-
gence personnel. 
I don't: like it either, but I am willing to 
accept it as a compromise price whicli 
must be paid to avoid paying the far morF 
costly price of revoking that constitution/I 
guarantee by imposing censorship. 
At that point, neither you nor anyone 
else could complain about anything at all. 
And like it or not, one of the benefits of 
this legion of "spies" in our midst is the 
kind of investigative reporting that would 
be unavailable to the press without the fre-
quently used surreptitious "old boy" net-
work of those very spies. 
A close examination of the rosters of 
network newsmen and newspaper reporters 
exposing local, state and national political 
co ruption, crime and scandal will reveal 
numerous men and women with close ac-
cess to that "old boy" network. 
Close access solely because they are a 
part of it. 
And if an overtrained machine sometimes 
produces excesses, like Liddy, Hunt and 
Co., perhaps it is unfortunate, but I think 
the record will show most such excesses get 
stopped, many before they become a hazard.

Secret Agent Diplomacy 
The world of diplomacy like the 
moon has its hidden side where intelli-
gence operatives and agents provaca-

We have had access to the latest se-
cret intelligence reports which provide 
fleeting glimpses Into this shadowy, 
subterranean world. 
Behind the cordial handshakes and 
cocktail patties of detente, the reports 
reveal, the power struggle rages on. In 
Africa, for instance, the Chinese are 
conducting guerrilla schools, the Rus-
;sians are training and equipping 
troops, the Arabs are supplying arms 
and the Americans are wheeling and 
dealing. 
American Ambassador Robert Yost 
reports from Burundi that President 
Micombero "siispects the Chinese and 
has great dislike for the Russians." 
Nevertheless, Yost says, Burundi has 
"moved closer to the Arabs and Chi-
nese and, to a much lesser extent, the 
Soviets... 
"A substantial number of Burundi 
military officers are now being 
trained" in Communist and Arab coun-
tries, he asserts. These include "30 in 
the Soviet Union, 60 in Algeria, 10 in 
Egypt, that we are aware of."

, ?Prof. Henry A, Kissinger, on the strategg of 
Otto von Bismarck, Germany's "Iron Chancellor.' 
By Murrey Marder 
Washington Post Staff Writerl 
, 
In six months as Secretary of State, Henry Kis-
singer has been running a frenetic race against 
a domestic clock that can strike at the power, and 
Indeed the life, of the Nixon administration. 
No man below the rank of President ever held 
so much influence over American global power as 
Kissinger now possesses. The Haldemans and the 
Ehrlichrrians are gone; Treasury Secretary George 
P. Shultz is departing, Defense Secretary James 
R. Schlesinger, although an intellectual challenger 
In his own right, is. usually more of an associate 
of Kissinger than an adversary, ',and Schlesinger's 
'international scope is admittedly mailer. 
As the world sees him Kissinger is virtually acting 
president for international affairs. This is an exag-
gerated perception. But in terms of the power he 
commands', there is more truth than falsehood in the 
characterization. 
Unbelievable as it may seem to Kissinger's critics, 
?the man who jocularly concedes his own "megalo-
mania" privately says he is troubled now by the 
'magnitude of his image, for it' really represents 
,presidential weakness. As much as he relishes adula-? 
tion, what preoccupies Kissinger is usable, not il-
lusory, power, and the only tangible power he com-
mands flows from the President. 
There have been very .powerful secretaries of 
state before him; Dean Acheson for Truman, John 
Foster Dulles for Eisenhower. Sometimes they' too, 
eclipsed their masters, but none served a Presided 
simultaneously crippled by a crumbling domestic 
base and a threat of impeachment. 
Exceptional authority has piled up in Kissinger's 
hands through a series of extraordinary coincidences. 
Kissinger moved to State replacing William P. 
Rogers, leaving no foreign policy rival at the White 
House; Kissinger's hat remained there, too. Water-
gate removed almost all the Kissinger second-
guessers and outright antagonists from the Presi-
dent's inner circle, where they had warily guarded 
presidential power and prerogatives. Other power 
centers were vacated; less-dominant personalities 
moved in. 
And, while Kissinger is not. a free agent In the 
literal sense, his clout in the bureaucracy is massive. 
It is an illusion that President Nixon .ever did 
grapple with the details of most foreign-policy is-
sues, many sources report. "Perhaps the whole 
secret of Kissinger's success with the President," 
said one associate, is his ability to anticipate "where 
the ,President will come down on an issue." The 
President, it is said, will frequently tell Kissinger, 
"We have to get this done; work it out, you have my 
support." 
"On a lot of things," one source said, "he [now] can 
make a decision without going to the President. For 
remember, this is the second term of an administra-
tion, and the basic policy is set." 
-This has been invaluable in working with the 
Russians," said another associate. "Henry is able to 
report to the President without constantly seeking 
instructions and holding meetings." When Kissinger 
goes to the President, said another source. "he goes 
with confidence that he will be supported, and he is." 
But not always. Sometimes even 
.Kissinger loses, or is obliged to give 
way to a combination of forces. The 
most potent combination ..is the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, joined by the Secre-
tary of Defense, if they can more 
strongly appeal to a presidential in-
clination. 
. 
Within two weeks of the day Kis-
singer was sworn in; as Secretary of 
State, the Arab-Israeli October war 
crashed over the American-Soviet de-
tente policy that he had done so much 
to create, over his ambition to 
"institutionalize" the concept and style 
of foreign policy identified with him, 
and over the entire pace of activity he 
envisioned in his two-hat role as both 
Secretary of State and presidential na-
tional security adviser. 
Six months later, with more than, 
120,000 intervening mites of air travel, 
and hectic visits to 25 countries?some-
times three or four of them in a single 
day?Kissinger is still picking up the 
pieces and the thread of . his original 
objectives. 
,In between, the shadow of Water-
gate and the threat of impeachment 
has expanded from a poSsible hazard 
for the conduct of American foreign 
policy to an engulfing challenge with-
out precedent in the nation's life. Offi-
cially, all goes on as before; in reality, 
almost nothing is the same. 
? Now the course of East-West de-
tente, the search for peace and stabil-
ity in the Middle.-East and other objec-
tives of U.S. policy have personal, as 
well as national, significance for a 
;President under siege. 
The Nixon administration's foreign-
policy record is itself the ultimate fall-
back defense 'for the survival of Presi-
dent Nixon. And that too has now he-: 
; come a domestic' political issue, as evi-
denced by the eruption. in Congress 
last week of extraordinary demands to 
put tight strings on the President's ne-
gotiating power during the impeach-
ment-consideration process, to prevent 
him from succumbing to any Soviet 
; strong-arm negotiating demands. 
This pattern Inevitably Intensifies 
the pressure on Kissinger. 
"It's going to he a bitch of a time" 
operating through the impeachment 
sequence in Congress, said one high-
ranking foreign policy strategist. "It is 
going to be damn tough to ,have a for-
eign policy if it comes to an indict-
ment"?an impeachment vote by the 
House of Representatives. 
There is a widespread impression in 
official Washington that if President 
Nixon should resign or be impeached, 
Vice President Gerald R. Ford, who 
succeeds him, would be certain to keep 
'Kissinger as his foreign-policy archi-
tect, and therefore there would be no 
particulr obstacle about maintaining 
the continuity of American foreign pol-
icy. 
But many experls (possibly inelud. 
ing Kissinger himself) see this as too 
simplistic an assumption. A change of

Presidents is a fundamental shift, al-
tering internal relationships in the fed-
eral power structure and almost invert; 
ably producing at least an interlude of! 
reconsideration in the policy process,' 
as well as a recalculation by foreign, 
governments. 
There is no immutable plan that pro-
jects U.S. policy on the most complex 
subjects, which are highly susceptible 
to interaction among nations. . 
For all' i its international accomplish-
ments, the Nixon administration so far! 
has penetrated only the outer layers of 
many of the toughest international! 
problems. 
Only the easiest stages of American-, 
Soviet nuclear strategic arms limita-
tion (SALT I) have been accomplished;., 
'ahead is the problem, of SALT II, ; 
achieving permanent control on the ; 
use of offensive nuclear weapons. 
With all of Kissinger's furiously 
paced shuttle diplomacy in the Middle 
East, only a start has been made on f 
Arab-Israeli military disengagement as ; 
a prelude to enormously complex' 
peace negotiations. "Each success,"' 
Kissinger has said, "only buys an ad-' 
mission ticket to a more difficult prob-. 
lem." 
The recent open clash between the; 
United States and its European allies 
over allied consultation exposed the? 
depth of the breach to be repaired In 
Western policy coordination. The oil 
crisis revealed. monumental dangers I 
for international stability in an uncont-
rolled scramble for energy, and the: 
profound economic consequences of 
,tripled or quadrupled oil prices even if 
there is international cooperation. ? 
There is no built-in uniformity of ; 
position even in the present ,adminis-
tration on the most critical world is- . 
sues. 
For example, inside the adininistra-
tion there was not universal dismay 
that the Kissinger mission. to Moscow 
.last Month failed to achieve the de-
sired "conceptual breakthrough" for 
limiting multiple nuclear warheads for. 
SALT II. ? 
As one authoritative source at the, 
Pentagon put it, there was even. 'a lit-
tie mood of relief" at top levels of the . 
Defense Department, especially among i 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Before Kissinger left for Moscow; 
these sources said, Pentagon strate-
gists were determined that the United. 
States should take and hold a "tough 
, enough" position to assure a decidedly 
more favorable outcome for the United 
States in SALT II than the SALT I re- ' 
sults in , 1972, which .made the Joint I 
Chiefs uneasy. 
According to these sources, Presi-
dent Nixon favored the more demand- I 
log Pentagon position over the State " 
Department's preferences, and this, 
was the approach that Kissinger car-
ried to Moscow. He encountered an, 
equally firm Soviet counter-proposal 
on the method of controlling mutliple 
nuclear warheads. ; 
"You could be sorry, of course, that J 
the Russians were so obstinate," said ! 
one Pentagon source, "but it won't be 
disastroui for us if we have to wait ah-
other Year" for an initial SALT Il ac-
cord. 
With the impeachment threat hang-
ing over President Nixon, one Penta-
gun source said, "all of the (official ? 
Washington) pressures, it seems to me, 
are going to be, 'Don't be nushed 'into 
anything, be ,prudent, be cautious.' 
That seems to be-the Same mood on 
the Hill too." 
For Kissinger this presents a multi-
Approved For 
plc dilemma. He already faces, in Con-
gress, powerful demands to extract a 
freer emigration policy from the So-
viet Union as the price of tariff and' 
trade benefits for promised expansion 
of U.S.-Soviet trade. With all his en-
hanced authority, he is obliged to bar-
gain, simultaneously, with the Soviet 
Union, with the Arab-Israeli complex, 
with European and other allies, with 
the Congress, and with the federal bu-
reaucracy-
"No man, not even Henry Kissinger, 
can sustain this pace for three more 
years," a core member of the Kissinger 
apparatus said, troubled, last week. 
Kissinger's specialty' and reputation 
In world affairs is as a "great con-
ceptualizer" of balance of power 
diplomacy. This tends to create the 
impression, as some diplomats put it, 
"that Henry can walk on water." 
The reputation of diplomatic genius 
Is an invaluable asset for him; but it 
also has its great drawbacks when he 
missteps, orfails. With the world spot-
light on Kissinger, one aide said rue-
luny, "If he belches, it becomes an 
International incident." 
Kissinger has achieved a remarkable 
honeymoon relationship with the Con-
gress; with the expenditure of great 
time, effort and blandishments, Even 
so, he has not taken into camp and 
bent to his will such a prime chal-
lenger on SALT and Soviet trade-emi-
gration, terms es Sen. Henry M. Jack-
son (D-Wash.). 
The "co-opting of Congress" by Kis-
singer is described in this manner by 
one insider: "In manY ways, this is the 
same phenomenon Henry accom-
plished with the press. He is highly ar-
ticulate, he conveys a sense of inti-
macy?and he gets them to do so much 
listening that they have very little 
time for questions." 
Kissinger has overwhelmed the Con-
gress, individually and in groups, with 
private breakfasts, leadership break-
fasts, lunches, invitations to accom-
pany him on trips, appearances in 
closed hearings?but notably, he has 
had only one public hearing in the en-
tire six months. 
Significantly, he has not been a 
pressed for public testimony and tough ' 
' peblic questioning. Most congressmen 
, exult, instead, over their "inside" off-
; the-record access, while Kissinger em-
ploys press conferences, airborne back- , s 
knowledge' that the Kissinger pledge 
"to infuse the Department of State' 
. with a sense/ of participation, Intellec-
tual excitement and mission" remains 
largely illusory. 
! The abnormal demands on his time 
and energy imposed by the unexpected 
blow of the Middle East war, waif Its 
diplomatic requirements for secrecy, 
have largely thwarted these public and 
institutional objectives, many Kissinger 
subordinates maintain. 
' Other Kissinger associates agree?
but only up to a limited point. The nat-
ural, not the aberrational, style of Kis-
singer, they concede, more candidly, is 
essentially secretive: working in snail, 
intimate groups of tested, self-effacing 
loyalists, with the publicly visible re-
sults of the output carefully orches-
trated only by Kissinger himself. 
! As the revelations lumped under the 
! term Watergate show. there was virtu-
}ally a conspiratorial attitude iqside the 
Nixon administration from the outset, 
Jwith the President and his original In-
ner group looking on much. of the out-
side world as enemies?including the 
, federal bureaucracy, inherited from 
Democratic administrations. 
F Kissinger arrived at the White , 
House with his own long-standing anti-
pathy toward bureaucracies, but for 
different reasons. Bureaucracies, to 
him, were grossly overstaffed, slow-
witted, initiative-stifling, press-leaking, 
foot-dragging, responsibility-shirking 
institutions. They needed to be circum-
vented until they could be slashed to 
the bone, drastically reoriented and 
made responsive, to the will of the . 
White House. 
? "The only way secrecy can be kept," 
l'Kissinger wrote in 1968? "is to exclude 
from the making of the decision all 
those who are theoretically charged 
with carrying it out." 
To the brittle, suspicious "Berlin 
Wall" types around the President, how-
ever, Kissinger, the German-Jewish 
professor from Harvard, was himself 
an intruder, and a subject of distrust. , 
The lull story of the rivalry between 
the Kissinger apparat at the White 
House and the Haldeman-Ehrlichman 
pparat has yet to !be revealed. The Im 
pending Watergate trials, and a law-
uit filed by a former Kissinger aide, 
Morton Halperin, over the wiretapping 
f Halperin's telephone during and af-
ter the time he worked on the National 
eeurity Council staff, raise some haz-
ground talks with newsmen, plus pri-
vate individual meetings with coinm-
; 
nists and editors, for his unprecede- 
P 
. dentedly extensive public-relations op-
erations. This mix ,gives Kissinger 
, w 
enormous influence over what is re-
ported or broadcast about him.  X 
j 
, He has a major advantage over his h 
! immediate predecessors, Dean Rusk 
and William P. Roge/s. Rusk had ! fun-
damental differences with Congress 
, over Vietnam policy; he was caught in 
an almost constant adversary relation-
et 
ship. Rogers' appearances before Con-
gress were much easier; but Rogers 
si 
could never convince Congress that he, 
not Kissinger, was in charge of foreign 
policy. 
of 
rds for Kissinger's 'determined at-
empt to disassociate himself corn-' 
letely from the Watergate scandals. 
"I'm told that he [Kissinger] is clean 
?that they can't lay a glove on him," a 
iSsinger? insider hopefully said last 
eek. The ousted presidential advisers 
owever, are at least likely to try to 
ut the onus on Kissinger for stimulat-
ng much of the near-paranoid obses-? 
'on with secrecy at the White House, 
n grounds that he demanded it to 
over his secret negotiations with 
hina, the Soviet Union and North VI-
nam. 
There is no shortage of former Kis-
nger subordinates with caustic mem-
ries of operating under the whiplash 
his work liabits and massive ego. 
The most bitter of them describe Kis-
singer as an arch-manipulator of peo-
ple, a dissembler, a liar on petty is-
sues, a tyrant who succumbs to petu-
lance, bitter scorn, shouting outbursts. 
"No question about it," says a hide 
-
Kissinger has no such problem. And 
yet, he has fallen considerably short of 
his pledge to initiate, with his secre-
taryship, "an open articulation of our 
philosophy, our purposes and our 
actions" in order to restore the Ameri-
can consensus on for

where the action is." ' 
The action Is now ;divided into two 
centers; the State Department and the 
White House. Kissinger spends morn-
ings at the White House with his Na-
tional $ecurity Council hat, then 
leaves; is deputy for the NSC staff, 
Brig. gin. Brent Scowcroft, physically 
In command. Kissinger goes to State to 
put onis secretary hat. 
This 'does not mean that Kissinger:1 
surrenders control of anything. At! 
State, either .he or his extremely able ' 
;chief eicectuive assistant, Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger, are in continual commu-
nication with the NSC operation. I 
With his NSC hat, Kissinger retains; 
Interdepartmental coordinating author-
ity across the web of committees he 
created, with President Nixon's full 
.blessing. Kissinger, of course, chairs, 
almost all the committees. 
He brought his key NSC aides to 
State with him, including Eagleburger; 
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, Kissinger's alter 
'ego; William G. Hyland; Winston Lord, 
Mid other top aides, and the action 
center has shifted to State, but the 
NSC has not withered on the vine. 
One NSC official has a special 
function; young Peter W. Rodman, a 
Kissinger favorite,. is keeper of the se-
cretive record on all major Kissinger 
trips abroad. 
On Aug. 1, 1973, there were 140 peo-
ple on the NSC staff,' 52 of 'them 
classed as substantive officials. On 
April 1, 1974, there were still 114 NSC 
employees, 41 counted as officials, with 
three more about to be added to fill: 
vacancies. 
Insiders are extremely wary about 
discussing hoi, much' time Kissinger 
spends with the Watergate-impeach- ' 
ment harassed President these days. 
After long hesitation, one 'authoritative 
source ,guardedly said, "Maybe some.' 
'what less time face-to-face, but much 
more on the phone?so it probably 
works out to about the same." Others 
doubt that. 
Inevitably, there has been "some re-
sentment" inside the bureaucracy over 
Kissinger's doubled "two-hat" power, a 
senior aide concedes. But "it is 
smoother now," he insists, since. Kis-
singer sorted out the roles more. At 
least one high Defense Department of-
ficial agrees, perhaps in part because, 
as one State source added, "I think he 
[Kissinger] just has been too strong 
[for any one else] to do anything 
about" in any event. 
Now that Kissinger is operating as 
the institutional head of the State De-
partment, at least his selected top offi-
cials share in some of the secrets. The 
"old insiders" are amazed that the se-
cretive Kissinger has widened his priv-
ileged circle as much as he has at 
State; the outsiders take just the oppo-
site view. 
"You are rid of that crazy business," 
said one knowledgeable insider, "where; 
Rogers didn't know, Laird (former De-
fense Secretary Melvin R. Laird) 
didn't know" what Kissinger ? was 
doing; "it was a crazy scheme." Now, 
he said, the system is "much better; 
and stronger." 
This in no way means that Kissinger 
Is now "Mr. Open." On the contrary, 
the essence of his operating style is 
basically unchanged; tightly knit 
groups of loyalists, sometimes deliber-
ately Put in competition with each 
other in rivalry for the boss's approval, 
as he sweats them through redrafting; 
rewriting to produce, in the magical 
Kissinger term,. the proper "conceptual 
approach'; to a problem. 
"His managerial imagination does 
not run below the assistant secretary 
level," said one experienced "country 
director" official at State. But this is 
the way Kissinger wants it, with the 
asSistant secretaries holding responsi-
?bility for running their regional bu-
reaus while the peripatetic Kissinger 
jokes, "Someday! I will visit the State 
Department." ;

Some of, his loyalists maintain that 
the existing pattern is aberrational, be-

the pattern is immutable Kissinger 
style. They, worry that Kissinger has 
entrapped himself in endless, over-per-
sonalized diplomacy, a "Flying Dutch-
man," in effect.

ger by contrast, claims frus-

; One middle-level State official pro-
' tests: ' 
I "The secretary keeps' complaining 
about the lack of creativity . . . You 
can do all the shaking up in the world. 
but unless the man tells you what the 
'architecture is, nobody can see the

not a beach house, but you have to 
know how it translates into flying but-
tresses and crypts. You can't be of use 
to him unless he tells you what the sit-
uation is." 
Kissinger, writing In 1968 about the 
19th Century German chancellor, Bis-
marck, said, "The impact of genius oin 
institutions is bound to be unsettling, 
of course. The bureaucrat will consider 
originality as unsafe, and genius will 
resent the constrictions." However, 
Kissinger added, "Statesmen who 
build lastingly transform the personal 
act of creation into institutions that 
can be maintained by an average 
standard of performance. This, Bis-
marck proved incapable of doing." 
Kissinger is not the unquestioning 
idolator of Bismarck or Metternich or 
Castlereagh many who have skimmed 
through the Kissinger writings tend to 
assume. He was intrigued by their dip-
lomatic prowess, but also by their 
faults and miscalculations. His own to-
tal immodesty tempts him to try to 
surpass their, accomplishments. But in 
his perception, the damnable threat of 
impeachment can confound his loftiest 
aspirations.

FOOD CRISIS' 
U.S. HiI 
By Judith Randal 
Ster?Isiews StalT Writer 
? The Nixon administration has 
been careful never to mention the 
? words "energy crisis" and "food 
crisis" in the same breath. Yet the 
signs are unmistakable that one is 
taking shape from the other and, 
whereas the Arabs have been the 
villains in the first round of the 
scarcity saga, the United States 
very likely is going to be next. 
? Indeed, it has been predicted that 
. unless the United States acknowl-: 
edges what already is happening 
and begins to exert some leader-
ship, people dying of hunger in 
droves in the underdeveloped coun-
tries will be featured on nightly tele-
vision news within as little as a. 
year. 
Consider for example, the 'Plight 
of such places as Bangladesh, Ne-
pal, India and Pakistan. For years, 
these countries have depended on 
Japan to supply them with fertiliz-
er. But now that Japan ? which, of 
course, has no oil of its own ? is 
having to pay more to import it, it 
has stopped making this energy-in-
tensive product for export and so 
has none to sell. In addition, fuel for 
running irrigation pumps is perilous-
ly scarce. The result is that India 
alone may ' be short ,10 million 
pounds of food this year, even if the 
weather holds up. 
? 
IN A paperback entitled "Agenda 
for Action: 1974," the Overseas 
Development Council points out that 
almost a billion people a quarter 
of ail those on the globe. ? live in 
the "fourth world" countries which, 
like India, are the poorest of the 
poor. It would be bad enough if fuel 
and fertilizer were their only agri-
cultural problems. But, as the ODC 
report makes clear, the land in 
many of these nations has been so 
ravaged by growing numbers of 
people and livestock that it has be-
come progressively, more unsuitable 
.for growing food. 
Until World War II, most nations 
were food exporters and so were in

The ,Watergate- Summit 
*Watergate, after a considerable lag, now has begun.' 
to impinge increasingly on President Nixon's ability to 
conduct the nation's foreign policy. 1; 
The White House chief of staff, Alexander Haig, drew 
4 contrary conclusion from the 'President's Paris visit 
last weekend. "A viable Presidency is a cornerstone of 
world security," Mr. Haig said, drawing the questionable 
conclusion that theApptiktfOCItin0FlikUtkPaellitlaWilne/08

'a position to pitch in. But now only 
Australia, Canada and the United 
States have crop surpluses, and the 
margins are perilously slim ? the 
more so because little or no idle ag-
ricultural acreage remains. 
According to calculations based 
on government figures; the world 
grain reserve is down to' the point 
where it could vanish in a mere 27 
days. And if Canada and the United 
States, which share the same cli-
mate, were to have a season of bad 
weather, even this cushion would 
disappear. 
ALL THIS would make it sound as 
if a scenario of mass starvation 
were inevitable. However, the Unit-
ed States is the major power least 
harmed by the energy crisis, and in' 
the long run stands .to benefit in 
trading relations with the newly 
wealthy Arabs because of the re-
bounding strength of the dollar. 
Food ? particularly protein ? 
has, like energy, become the object' 
of a seller's market and the United 
States holds all the cards. Clearly, 
we can, if we have the will, do some-
thing about making it more availa-
ble to all. Among the options: 
* Diet ? The 'average per capita 
grain consumption in the United 
States and Canada is nearly a ton a 
year, most of which is consumed 
indirectly as meat, milk and eggs. 
, The result' is that it takes almost 
five times as much land, Water and 
fertilizer to feed an average North 
American as it does an average 
Colombian, Nigerian or Indian. 
Although many of the industrial-

'grain could therefore be diverted to ?

made a commitment to curb their 
.appetites for animal protein. particu-
larly. beef. Such a commitment, 
? 
moreover; could' pay dividends in 
public health. Evidence increasing-
ly points to excessive intake of ani-
mal products as a major risk factor 
in heart disease and some of the 
more common forms of cancer as. 
well. 
? Research ? The fourth world 
must become more, nearly self-suf-. 
ficient with regard to food. But if 
this is to come about, more must be 
learned about how to increase the 
productivity of soybeans and other. 
vital plant crops when adverse fac-
tors such as aridity are taken into 
account. Scientists at the Depart?
ment of Agriculture could provide 
the leadership. But tinder the stew-
ardship of the Nixon administration, 
such expenditures have dropped. 
International political coopera-
'tion ? Except for the military vari-
ety, foreign aid has never been pop-
ular with Americans, many of whom 
regare it.as a giveaway. However, 
people might feel differently if they 
realized that we spend less than 3. 
tenths of 1 percent of our gross na-
tional product on overseas aid ? 
less by far than we spend on alcohol 
and tobacco, and less proportionate-
ly than all but two of the other 15 
nations which extend a helping hand 
to the under-developed world.. 
The Food for Peace program has 
been cut, and in recent months the 
Nixon administration ? fearing the 
political repercussions of a price 
rise for bread here at home ? has 
stopped making wheat available to 
voluntary groups such os World 
Church Service. Nor has Congress 
behaved well. In January, for in-
stance, the House voted down sup-
port for a vital aspect of the World 
Bank.' 
What it all means is that the 
peace the President is so proud of 
having achieved is threatened by 
our selfishness, whether intentional 
or not. If in a few years the world is 
again at war because so many have 
unjustly gone hungry, who will be to 
blame but ourselves? 
demonstrated bY Mr: Nixon's reception in Paris. But Mr. 
Haig:s judgment was piemature. Mr. Nixon's diplomatic 
conferences and street appearances have come under 
bitter criticism in France as unseemly at a time of memo-
rial services for the late President Pompidou. The charge 
is made that this activity was designed to counter Water-
gate by providing evidence of the President's continued 
influence abroad. 
Even more important is the acknowledgement by 
S. eatAaRtnippattoliktkoottioggyots_adviser that

Watergate played a negative role during Mr. Kissinger's 
recent talks ? and many diplomatic disappointments?
in Moscow. State Department Counselor Helmut Sonnen-
fellt indicated that Soviet leaders, as a result of Water-
g4, hesitate to enter into new agreemeicts? with the 
Nixon Administration. They "are biding their time and 
checking their bidding a bit," he said, concerned whether 
the l President can carry, out agreements that require 
Congressional approval. 
Congressional resistance on trade agreements made 
by Mr. Nixon two years ago was mentioned by Mr.. 
P^nnenfeldt as a specific example. But a second strategic 
arms limitation treaty (SALT H) would also require 
Congressional approval. Mr. Kissinger's biggest disap-
pointment was his inability to' make an agreed "con-
ceptual breakthrough" with the Russians on SALT II.? 
Soviet Communist party, Secretary Brezhnev and Mr. 
Nixon both seem determined to ? maintain the d?nte 
atmosphere and to proceed with -Mr. Nixon's Moscow 
visit this summer. But that does not assure the conchi--
sion of important agreements. 
The danger in regard to SALT is not, as some suppose, 
WASHINGTON POST.

that a weakened Nixon will sacrifice American interests 
to obtain a Moscow agreement as a counter to Watergate. 
The real danger is that a reasoniible SALT H agreement 
will be attacked even more violently than the reasonable 
SALT 'I agreement. Mr. Brezhnev pr Mr. Nixon, or both, 
-might prefer to delay a SALT h agreement rather than 
have it repudiated by the United States Senate. 
The American national interest, however, lies in 
achieving a SALT II agreement this year. Otherwise, the 
approaching Soviet deployment of newly-developed 
MIRV multiple warhead missiles could take the arms 
race past another critical point of no return. If that 
deployment pattern is not limited in advance by mutual 
agreement, a further American buildup and a new spiral 
in the arms race will be hard to avoid. 
All this points to a need for the Congress to proceed 
with all deliberate speed in resolving the Watergate de-
bate. That would be so even if Mr. Nixon were not plan-
ning a Moscow trip this summer. But the prospect of that 
voyage and the need for anew SALT pact make it more 
desirable than ever that the national political crisis be 
resolved before many more months have gone by. 
Labor's Ties Abroa 
By Selig S. Harrison 
Washington Post Staff Writer. 
American ties with Western Europe ' 
and Canada, already frayed in the dip-
lomatic and economic arenas, are rap-
idly wearing thin in the labor field 
after , three decades of postwar co-
operation. ? 
? East-West detente has Spurred the 
formation -of a new European Trade, 
Union Confederation stressing the 
1 common bonds of all European unions 
rather than the ideological struggle 
between Communist and non-Com-
munist labor groups. The European 
group is on the verge of admitting the 
Communist-dominated Italian CGIL 
labor federation later this month des- 11 
pite the bitter protests of. AFL-CIO, 11 
leaders. 
In Canada, rising nationalism has II 
provoked mounting demands for the ;1 
secession of the Canadian affiliates of 1 
American-based unions. Canadian local 
union presidents of the International 
Paperworkers have just voted to set 
? up a separate Canadian group, and a 
'referendum of the 52,000 Canadian 
' members of the Paperworkers now ? 
under way is expected to give formal 
, approval for the break by April 30. 
By far the greatest concern of the 
AFL-CIO is focused on Western Eu-
rope, where American labor has chan-
neled millions of dollars since World' 
War II to build up anti-Communists 
labor forces, especially in France and 
'Italy. 
AFL-CIO leaders have lobbied intense-
ly and unsuccessfully 'to block the 
soft-line trend reflected in the, forma-
tion of the European Trade Union 
Confederation as an alternative to the 
oribund anti-Communist Interna-
tional Confederation of Free Trade 
Unions. 
'? At its inception, the ETUC voted to 
omit the word "free" from its name, 
a decision 'acidly dismissed by AFL-
CIO President George lVleany, who 
observed that "they took the word 
'free' out on the argument that put-
earince 777177p 
? 
ting it in there would in some way 
interfere with what they call 'de-
tente.'" 
In January, leaders of ETUC mem-
ber unions joined in a Geneva meeting 
with Soviet labor chief Alexander 
Shelepin and representatives of the 
Communist bloc's WFTU. Early last 
month, the ETUC executive committee 
on April 10 looking to the admission 
authorized a key round of negotiations 
'tif the Italian CGIL at the May Copen-
hagen convention of the European fed-
eration. 
"The Geneva meeting and 
the ETUC decision represent 
a complete reversal of the

When and if all other bonds fail, 
Britain and the United States will still 
have in common their labor move-

in both countries are so similar in 
their parochialism, their isolationism

There is nothing new about it, ex-
cept at the moment the labor leader-
ship in the United States as well as 
England is doing its utmost to resist 
the claims of the 20th century. British 
labor is doing all it can to fight off the 
economic advantages of the Common 
Market; American labor simultane-
ously is doing all it can to oppose de-
tente with Russia and the expansion of 
International trade. 
The best thing about the Industrial 
Revolution is that its high productivity 
has immeasurably improved the work-
er's standard of living. Yet the Anglo-
American unions keep right on resists-. 
Ing new efforts to increase productiv-
ity. It Ls the same with foreign trade. 
Prosperity and high employment in-
variably are marked by flourishing 
free trade. Conversely, the depressions 
and recessions have usually coincided 
with inhibited trade and limited mar-
kets, distinguished by high tariffs, quo. 
' however, it might be thought Mr. 
s 
It wouldn't be so bad if it affected 
only the unions, bid in the United 
States and England the power et labor 
can and does influence the cotirse of 
foreign policy. In Britain, for instance, 
the new Labor government of Prime 
Minister Harold Wilson is obliged to 
renegotiate England's place in the Eu-
ropean Economic Community, which 
, means further obitaeles to European 
Economic Community, which means' 
further obstacles to European unity 
and all it promises. 
In the United States, the AFL-CIO 
opposition to a long-overdue new deal 
with Russia and the Third World could 
wreck the nation's hopes for an era of 
coexistence, disarmament and peace. It 
Is one tif the great ironies of our tithe 
that the most celebrated of all anti-
Communists, Richard Nixon, should be 
accused of being soft on communism 
by the head of American labor, George 
yeany, president of the AFL-CIO. 
As a result of Watergate, Mr. Nix-
on's public standing is so low these 
days that he is a vulnerable target for 
Mr. Meany's assaults on his foreign 
trade bill, regardless of the legisla-
tion's merits. 
? Among other things, the bill would

' the point of making it impossible to do so where rea-

infiltrate in the '60s were more vociferous than danger-
ous to the civil order. Double agents are not ordinarily 
invited to join the bomb throwers and kidnappers and 
the Hearst case is no exception. The FBI never learned 
i 
of the Symbionese until after a crime had occurred. In-
:deed no one had heard of them until last November 
:when they suddenly took credit for shooting Mareus 
Foster with cyanide bullets. Even today the names of 
only seven members are known, and of these, four are 
conjectures. The FBI has a good record for investiga-
? tion. It has handled 10 major kidnapping cases since 
, the Hearst case on February 4, and all 10 have been 
"solved." It probably knows where Patricia Hearst is 
being held too, and waits only for permission to act.

But the bureau cannot be expected to keep tabs on and 
prevent crimes by groups whose very existence is 
deadly secret. - 
Realizing how difficult it is for the government to 
stop kidnappings, many businessmen are beginning 
to act on their own. Pinkerton's protective service re-
ports a surge in demand for armed bodyguards since 
February. The Burns International 'Investigation Bu-
reau in the last few weeks has run out of stock of a 
pamphlet called "Security Handbook for Businessmen 
Overseas." (It is hurriedly reprinting its boOk ivith the 
new title, "Executive Protection Handbook.") Fred 
Rayne, director of Burns' headquarters in Miami, says 
that today mo3t inquiries about his work come from 
people who want protection inside the United States, 
whereas only a few weeks ago the demand was for 
protection abroad. Rayne speaks complacently about 
the epidemic: "Everybody's a potential target nowa-
days. I think the new thing won't be to go for million-
aires, who are too welIprotected. Robbing banks.is too 
hard now with numbered money and cameras. I think. 
they'll go for small guys, it's much easier just to pick 
up the victim at the door." For $500 Burns will provide 
a day-long seminar for 25 executives, complete with 
handbooks, on 'how to guard against kidnapping and 
terrorism. Included in the fee is a specially tailored 
"emergency program" designed to give the group a 
systemized response to threat. With offices all Over the 
world, the agency screens and trains domestic servants 
anywhere and provides year-round advice (minimum 
fee $2000) on keeping your office free of bugs, bombs

alert'system to keep watch on all the family. 
Lifting the Turkish Opium Ban 
? The streets of America have become 
'safer since opium growing was out-
lawed in the distant hills of Turkey. 
'But by early summer, barring a politi-
cal miracle, the Turkish government 
will tell thd impoverished opium farm-
ers in the remote Afyon region that 
they can once again plant their tradi-
tional money crop: the opium poppy 
which gives Afyon its name. 
Thin expected Turkish action would 
have an inevitable impact on the U.S. 
;-ime rate. For out of the new opium 
hast would come an illegal flood of 
heroin into this country. As more her-
oin became available, hundreds of 
? thousands of young people would try it 
,,and become addicted. Most of them 
would be forced to turn to crime to 
? 'support their habit. 
The effect on U.S. cities, narcotics 
officials tell us, would be measured in 
robbery, violence andAtilinlbadymap 
_words like "disastrous" and 
"catastrophic" to describe the conse-
quences. 
Yet the pressure to lift the opium 
ban is coming, in part, from a few U.S. 
pharmaceutical firms looking for 
, cheap morphine. They are in strange 
company, ranging from opium growers 
and international smugglers td Mafia 
mobsters and corrupt Turkish legisla-
tors?all eager to revive the heroin 
?traffic. 
. Before 1972, when opium growing 
:was banned iii Turkey in exchange for 
$35.7 million compensation from the 
American taxpayers, huge opium ship-
ments were diverted to France for re-
fining into heroin and then were smug-
gled into the United States.

duced the flow into this country until 
? only the hard-core addicts could obtain 
heroin. Suddenly, it became almost un-
available to the young drug 
"thippers," who like to live danger-
Jusly. 
The House report, authored by Nar-
cotics Subcommittee Chairman Lester 
Wolff (D-N.Y.), describes what hap-
pened after the Turkish connection 
was cut off. "Heroin addiction," it 
states, "(was) reduced from bekween 
500,000 and 700,000 to about 200,000 ac-
tive addicts ... 
"The price of one milligram of her-
oin in New York City was 44 cents in 
1972; by mid-1973, (it) had risen to 
$1.52. The street level purity of her-

the mountainous Golden Triangle of 
Burma, Thailand and Laos began to 
feel out the United States on an ex-

Turkey., One group offered to sell 400

The congressmen met a 70-year-old

those hills every year until 1972," they 
relate. "He had, at the government's 
suggestion, grown sunflowers as a sub-

Money can't buy 
Turkey's decision to reject further 
American anti-opium compensation 
and resume poppy-growing has cast a 
heavy shadow over the corresponding 
"honourable bribery" being offered 
by the United States to opium growers 
in the Golden Triangle where Thailand, 
Burma and Laos meet. The Americans, 
financing a similar campaign there, 
have already paid $7m to reward Thai 
tribesmen who agree to discard the 
opium petals for maize and vegetables 
with guaranteed markets. Thailand's 
King Bhumibol himself has intervened 
to encourage this Mafia-Rotarian switch 
from opium-growing.

was imposed with haste and without , 
'adequate consideration." 
But perhaps Wolff' s most disturbing 
discovery was the role of some U.S. 
pharmaceutical firms in the backstage 
campaign to lift the opium ban. He 
found the firms were quietly but ac-
tively lobbying with the Turkish gov-
ernment, Geneva narcotics conference 
and even the U.S. Congress. Ih short, 
these pharmaceutical firms are more 
interested in reducing the price they 
have to pay for opium than in prevent-
lug drug addiction and street crime. 
The secret report concludes, 
gloomily: "An apparently insolula-
problem faces the United States and 
Turkey concerning the opium ban. 
Each has taken a course which, when 
fulfilled, will probably result in a fron-
tal collision with the other." 
The report urges that the channels 
be kept open with Turkey and that the 
crop diversification program be pur-
sued. "Raising the level of understand. 
ing in Turkey about the international 
drug problem is a vital basis for any 
future cooperation," states the study.

opium each year and no one has been 
quite sure how much it would cost

opium prices have been soaring and 
this year's harvest in south-east Asia 
will double the local poppy-growers'

American press coverage 
and comment on the recent 
Moscow talks of Dr Kissinger, 
the United States Secretary of 
State, are sharply censured by 
Mr Boris Strelnikov, the Wash-

Insisting that much was

role of mass Information media 
consists of sup-porting the posi-

hindering the strengthening of 
mutual understanding and deve-

"However certain organs of 
the American bourgeois press 
and especially the influential 
New York Times and Washing-

publish irresponsible informa-
tion. They do their utmost to 
present matters as though 
Kissinger's Moscow mission 
failed completely because of 
Kremlin obduracy." 
He darkly suggests that The 
New York Times, Washington 
Post and other newspapers may 
be involved in a plot, sponsored 
by the military-industrial com-
plex and Zionist lobby, to dis-
rupt the American-Soviet dia-
logue. 
Mr Strelnikov's advice to 
the American media on the need 
to support the positive might 
well he heeded by the Soviet 
press, including his own news-

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
9 April 1974 
'U.S. press 
?threatens 
detente'. 
Pray 
. By Leo Gruliow :-
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Scienoe Monitor 
- ? Moscow 
The Russians are annoyed by cur-
rent talk in the West 'about the need 
for strength- in the -face of Soviet 
military power and by Western calls ' 
for tough bargaining with Moscow ' 
over nuclear arms limitation. 
Apparently what has stirred things 
up in Moscow is the comment in the 
Western, ? and particularly the 
American ? press after Secretary of 
State Henry A. Kissinger's failure to 
bring about a much-hoped-for break-
through in strategic arms control 
, when in Moscow last month and the 
speculation after Defense Secretary 
1 James Schlesinger's earlier adjust-
ment in basic U.S. nuclear strategy. 
While Pravda decries the American 
!public discussion of defense needs and 
strategy, Soviet military spokesmen, 
in internal pronouncements, never 
cease to proclaim essentially the 
!same doctrine as held by the Penta-
gon ? that ultimately peace rests on 
their own country's strength. 
I Soviet strategy, however, is not 
!subject to public discussion. When a 
istrategy review brings debate in 
America and, as in this instance, an 
. outcry for a stronger force or tough 
!bargaining with Moscow, the Soviet 
press reacts sensitively to all the talk. 
The sensitivity now appears com-
pounded by Mr. Kissinger's failure to 
I achieve a fresh accord on nuclear. 
1 arms. Evidently Moscow feels that 
Western concern over this setback 
plays into the hands of what it calls a 
coalition of U.S. military-industry 
? spokesmen, right-wingers, and Zion-
ists. 
To allay concerrf, all Soviet media 
have been presenting a bold front of? 
optimism about prospects for a fur-
ther arms limitation agreement by 
24 
the time of ,Mr. Nixon's expected 
summer visit to Moscow. 
Specifically "Moscow is critical of 
Western press comment on two 
counts: , ? 
? Although Secretary of State Kis-
singer's Kremlin visit failed to bring a 
hoped-for breakthrough on a strategic 
arms agreement, the soviet media 
have repeatedly complained that the 
Western press reported the situations 
with undue pessimism. Pravda even 
charged that the pessimism was de-
liberate "political sabotage" of de-
tente. 
? In the first major military corn-
mentary following Dr. Kissinger's 
visit, Pravda said Sunday that the 
American public discussion of a re-
vised nuclear strategy "cast a 
' shadow" on the Breztutev-Nixon 1973 
pledge to prevent nuclear warfare. 
'Detente spirit' cited 
A review of nuclear strategy would 
seem to be an internal matter for the 
Pentagon planners, the Pravda com-
mentator admitted, but he implied 
that all the hubbub about the strategy 
review ran counter to the spirit of 
detente and could build up momen-
tum for a new arma race. 
' Two months ago U.S. Defense Sec-
retary Schlesinger announced plans 
tot shift emphasis from the earlier 
Inuclear strategy of retaliation against 
an enemy's urban centers to one of 
targeting part of the missile ,etrike 
force on Soviet missile bases. 
, The Pentagon's strategy, Pravda 
said, also contemplated the use of 
tactical nuclear weapons in Europe so 
as not to leave U.S. allies at a 
disadvantage in converktional war-
fare. This would mean "mini-nu-
clear" war, the Moscow paper de-
clared. 
Pravda confessed that all of the 
hypothetical strategy could be Ig-
nored because there was a long way 
! between belligerent plans and actual 
warfare. I3ut what troubled the Soviet 
I commentaor was the thought that 
military declarations and policy deci-
sions might be used for psychological 
pressure on the Soviet' Union. Mr. 
Schlesinger, the writer said, had 
talked of this. ' 
Even more than psychological pres-
Sure, the commentator feared that 
advocates of an arms race might 
utilize the strategy review, if linked to 
moves to improve weapons and in-
crease their range, to build up mili-
tary power.

Jets for Russia 
Boping's turn 
It is Boeing's turn to go to Russia next: 
month to talk about the 20 wide-bodied. 
jets that Aeroflot wants to buy from; 
the west, and the factory that the 
Russians intend to build to turn out their 
own versions thereafter. These talks, 
have been going on for more than three I 
years. Nobody any longer doubts the 1 
Russians' serious intent. Although 1 
they have a huge military freighter in ; 
production, they have nothing approach-
ing a wide-bodied civil aircraft. Even more I 
important, there is no Russian engine. 
This is the first difficulty. When ; 
Boeing at one stage suggested pro-
viding an American airframe for a 
Soviet-built engine, the Russians' 
embarrassment was obvious. The gap 
is going to be filled by the Rolls-Royce 
RB211, which the Russians intend to buy 
and later to build under licence as they 
did the first Rolls-Royce jets immedi-
ately after the war. So why not buy 
Lockheed's Tristar to go with it? After 
all, the Tristar is wide-bodied and the! 
only aircraft using the R8211. Because, 
apparently, the Russians have mis-
givings about Lockheed's financial ! 
stability and about the company's 
announcement that it is not going to ; 
make any major developments to the r 
Tristar. Lockheed teams have been to I 
Moscow and may yet pull the deal off, ; 
but many in the company think their ; 
Moscow trips are a waste of time. 
McDonnell Douglas has a suitable 
? 
family of wide-bodied DC lOs of all 
sizes and ranges, either developed or 
under development; but it is owned by ; 
a man not particularly interested in 
Russian business. That leaves Boeing 
as the other serious contender with a 
family of wide-bodied jets on offer 
to the airlines. But only the 747 is 
actually in production, so the Russians 
would be taking a chance on the rest. . 
Technical problems apart, money 
could be a difficulty. Up to $500m is at 
stake, and there could be political 
trouble in Washington when the ques-
tion arises of providing such credit to 
Russia. One alternative would be to raise 
the funds in London. Preliminary sound-
ings suggest this would be possible, 
but at a price the Russians might not 
like. The cost might, however, be 
concealed elsewhere in ;the accounts. 1 
This is what happened during Germany's 1 
negotiations with Russia over the Kursk ; 
steel complex. 
WASHINGTON POST 
16 April 1974 
Victor Zorza 
soviets 
Prefer 
Ford 
Could, the Kremlin be considering 
whether to dump Mr. Nixon in favor of 
Vice President Ford? 
In a remarkable interview with John 
Osborne of The New Republic, which 
Ford now says he intended should re-
main off the record, the Vice President 
has described ? the administration he 
might form if Mr. Nixon should step 
down. If he became President, Ford 
? might drop Secretary/of Defense 
James Schlesinger?the man Moscow 
regards as 'the Nixon administration's 
evil spirit responsible for blocking fur-
ther progress on detente. 
The Kremlin is obviously reassessing' 
its attitude to the Nixon 'administra-
tion. The June summit in Moscow 
still on, but Foreign Minister Gromy-
ko's attitude in Washington last week 
made it clear that no real SALT agree-
? ment will be forthcoming. 
? The Kremlin's study of the ,options 
'would presumably begin by asking 
whether Mr. Nixon's survival in office 
would still be to its advantage. Even if 
he survies, his position would be seri-
osuly weakened. He would no longer 
be able to conclude major agreements , 
'on arms reduction, trade, and the-like, 
which have made his adminigtration so 
attractive to Moscow. But Ford, as a 
new ,President, could start all over 
again?and Ford has said that he 
would keep Kissinger. That would be 
worth a lot to Moscow. 
Mr. Nixon has had to default on his: 
ptilitical debts to the Kremlin, but 
Ford would be able to repay some of 
'them. Most important of all, Ford 
would be ? a natural candidate for re-
election in 1976, and this would make 
him more susceptible to subtle pres-
sures and bargaining offers from a 
Kremlin which now knows how to play 
the American election game. 
It was,Mr. Nixon who taught the 
Kremlin ow to play the game, by in-
tertwining his last election campaign 
to a President who is also a candidate: 
The television coverage, the promise 
of a generation of peace confirmed by, 
an affectionate send-off from Moscow, 
an agreement to limit arms. There 
was, of course, also the new structure 
, of peace. But Mr. Nixon got some 
votes; and Moscow got the American 
grain which averted possible food riots 
And thay have saved Brezhnev. 
On this count alone, it would clearly 
be in Moscow's interest that the man 
in the White House 'in 1976 should be 
running for re-election. But it would be 
doubly st) if Sen. henry Jackson (D. 
Wash.) gets the Democratic nomina-
tion. The Soviet press Is creating the 
'impression that Jackson and Schle-
; singer have already enough power be-
Itween them to bring the cold war back, 
? even if Nixon remains in the White 
House. Moscow 'press coverage of Jack 
son suggests that the Kremlin ?sees 
him as the most likely?and most dan-' 
gerous?Democratic candidate in the 
next election: It implies that Jackson 
as President would not only bring back 
; the cold war but even a hot war. The 
, Kremlin regards him as so great a 
,threat that it cannot simply sit back in 
,the hope that perhaps Sen. Edward 
Kennedy (D-Mass.)?whom it recently 
invited to Moscow In another anti. 
Jackson move?will get., the nomina 
tion. 
; One way to keep Jackson out is to 
help get ,Ford in now, , and to 
strengthen him .for the election cam-
paign by tacit electoral bargains of the 
kind the Kremlin made with Mr. Nixon 
in .1972: The longer Mr. Nixon stays 
now, the more likely Jackson is to get. 
'In later. 
But can the Kremlin seriously be-
lieve that it could influence the Ameri-
can electoral process, with all its 
vagaries? All we know is that it has 
tried to do so in the past. It does not, 
need anyone to put ideas in its head. 
Khrushchev used to boast that he 
.had helped John F. Kennedy win the 
Presidency, in a very close election, by 
timing the release of the U.S. airmen 
then held captive in the Soviet Union 
in a way designed to favor Kennedy. 
Brezhnev helped Mr. Nixon. He will do 
anything to keep out Jackson. 
So long as the Kremlin thought that 
Mr. Nixon could pay his debts, it con-
ducted itself in a way designed to help 
him against his critics. To reverse its 
conduct would require no change of 
principle, only a change in its estimate 
of whether Mr. Nixon can pay his 
debts?and t is now clear that he can-
not. 
The Krettilin knows that by refusing 
to cooperate with Mr. Nixon on Salt, 
the Mideast, and the like, it is depriv-
ing him of his last line of defense?the 
argument that he should be allowed to 
remain in office to complete the struc-
ture of peace. Moscow cannot, by it-
self, dump Nixon, but it can add mate-
rially to the pressure on defenses that 
are growing weaker all the time. The 
Soviet press continues to be kind to 
.Mr. Nixon, but deeds are more impor-
tant than words. 
Moscow's motives In refusing to co-
operate with Mr. Nixon may be mixed, 
but if its uncooperative attitude per-
sists, it will be clear that the Kremlin 
has indeed decided to dump Nixon and 
to help install Ford, in the expectation 
that it can gain more this way.

Most Austrians seem to take 
it for granted that the Ameri-
cans arranged the interview 
with Mr. Sejna for some politi-
cal purpose. 
Werner Stanzl, a former 
Austrian television correspond-
ent and now a staff writer for 
the Vienna-based Profit maga-
zine, said he suspected that 
ex-General Sejna brought out 
plans involving Austria when 
he defected. 
Mr. Stanzl said he tried to 
obtain an interview for three 
or four years. He tried through

Johnson. Mr. Stanzl described 
his host as definitely an Amer-

and mannerisms?but he spoke 
perfect German.

Mr. Johnson drove around in

and Mr. Stanzl subsequently

Inside the house Mr. Stant 
and his cameraman were

their stay, Mr. Stanzl said, he

Military sources in West 
Germany and Austria insist 
,that all the reports of extraor-
dinary military activity in the 
East bloc were completely un-
founded. 
The American Embassy here 
disclaimed any prior knowl-
edge of the Sejna interview 
and could shed no light on the 
subsequent scare stories. 
The reaction of the Austrian 
government was also curious. 
Mr. Stanzl said that upon 
this return to Vienna after in-
terviewing Mr. Sejna, he went 
directly to Gen. Karl Luetgen-
dorf, the Austrian defense min-
ister, for confirmation of what 
he had learned. 
Mr. Stanzl said the minister 
told him that the Austrianstov-
ernment had long ago been 
informed Of the Polarka Plan 
and that what the Czech defec-
tor had told Mr. Stanzl was 
authentic. 
General Luetgendorf, how-
ever, said he cibuld not publicly 
confirm the plan before getting 
the approval of Chancellor 
Bruno Kreisky. It is not clear 
whether Mr. Kreisky ever 
gave the official green light to 
his defense minister, but it has 
been confirmed that Rudolf 
Kirschschlaeger, the foreign 
minister, gave his approval. 
Subsequently, General Luet-
gendorf gave an interview to 
Profit as well as to ORF, the 
Austrian television station, in 
which he confirmed the au-
thenticity of the Polarka Plan 
and said it should be taken 
seriously and was "not to be 
belittled."

This decision was of some 
importance since ORF had re-
fused to broadcast the Sejna 
interview unless some authori-

go on television and speak on 
the subject. 
Profit, with a circulation of 
only 200,000, is not widely read

picking "European" scabs. 
If carried too far this would be 
unwise. About the only clear-cut indica-

Whatever happens to President 
Nixon as 'the Watergate procedures

gives Frenchmen concern; Chancellor 
Willy Brandt is depressed following a 
popularity slump; and Britain's Harold 
Wilson is fighting to surmount a tidal 
wave of problems. 
Amid these developments, the Com-
mon Market is being forced to face the 
fact that transnational economic and ? 
commercial projects worked out among 
European nations are simply not 
producing expected results. Thus the 
Anglo-French supersonic plane, Con-

New. doubts are developing about 
the future of the swing-wing multirole 
combat aircraft (MRCA), which Brit-

build six years ago. And, generally 
speaking, there is increasing realiza-

of European manufacturers, they may 
be wiser to limit their .enterprises to 
less ambitious dreams. 
All this provided an unhappy back-

Although it is unlikely that Britain 
will actually pull out (for political rea-'

talk of "perfidious Albion" prodded on, 
by an Uncle Sam who, fearful of 
"European" competition, wants to 
break up the Common Market (as de , 
Gaulle always predicted in the past). 
Such talk, in which France?never.

concepts?has been taking a tactless 
lead, comes at an exceedingly bad 
time for all the countries concerned,

BY RAY ALAN 
Questions 
for the CIA 
THE WATERGATE serial seems to 
have reached its penultimate install-
ment, but addicts should not despair. 
Another fascinating American mys-
tery is at present looking for a pro-
ducer. Its theme is the CIA's sup-
posed ignorance of Egyptian and 
Syrian preparations to attack Israel 
last fall. 
People who know about such 
things believe that at least two Eu-
ropean intelligence services deduced 
or guessed that an attack was com-
ing and informed their governments 
?weeks in advance. Economic offi-
cials of the European Community 
warned members confidentially in 
July to expect a Mideast oil crisis 
by Christmas. Britain's Department 
of Trade and industry was told by 
the Prime Minister's office early in 
August to be prepared for a fuel 
, shortage provoked by military action 
; in the Near East. Coupons for gaso-
linc rationing were issued to British 
i post offices before the end of the 
month, and oil imports were stepped 
up. By mid-October, when the fight-
ing was at its peak, the immediate 
I problem in Britain, France and some 
other Common Market countries was 
not to obtain petroleum but to find 
; storage capacity for the stuff. 
C 
; onsequently, it seems inconceiv-
able that the CIA was left out in 
; the cold, or that it failed to tell the 
; White House what European serv-
ices, if not its own agents, were an-
ticipating. Yet, if Washington knew, 
; why did it not alert Tel Aviv? Pre:, 
isumably; Israel would then have 
; taken countermeasures, the war 
; would have been much shorter, 
; many lives would have been saved, 
and there would probably have been ; 
no oil embargo. For it was Egypt's 
initial military success, and Presi-
Anwar 
dent 
el-Sadat'AplOGIVS8eFlor 
prestige, that persuaded Saudi Ara-
bia and other Arab producers to join 
the victory parade and decree oil 
cuts. 
One British view is that the White 
House did know what was coming 
but wished to shake Israeli compla-
cency and allow Sadat a tactical 
success that would give him suffi-
cent self-confidence to open peace 
talks with Israel and accept Ameri-
can assistance in exploring for oil 
and realizing his ambition to make 
Egypt a major refining and petro-
chemicals center. Whether or not 
this was the case, Sadat has in fact 
;told his ministers that Cairo must 
attract U.S. capital and lcnowhow. 
His economic advisers would like 
U.S. petroleum experts to prospect 
the Libyan border zone north and 
south of the Siwa oasis (where five 
years of Soviet exploration failed to 
find oil) and the northern fringes of 
the Nile delta. 
Other Arab governments are 
aware of this and are annoyed?the 
nominally "Left-wing" juntas of 
Syria and Iraq for ideological rea-
sons, the Saudis because they are 
eager to acquire oil-based industries 
and suspect Sadat of cutting in on, 
the relatively close relationship they 
have had with Washington in recent 
years. Some Saudis even accuse Sa-
dat and American oilmen of want-
ing to keep Saudi Arabia underde-
veloped, a mere exporter of energy 
to Western and Egyptian industry. I 
Though the Saudi oil minister, Sheik 
Ahmed Yamani, does not go quite 
so far, he adopted an anti-Americani 
posture during his recent talks with 
European governments, warning!' 
them not to join 'the 'United States 
in a defensive grouping of consumer I 
nations. The Saudis are now trying, 
hard to attract Japanese and Euro-
pean investment. Their bait: cheaper 
petroleum than that available to in- ' 
dustries established in Egypt. 
Meanwhile, French officials inter-
pret U.S. Mideast policy in cruder, 
more hostile, terms than the British. 
They believe Washington not only 
knew the Egyptian-Syrian attack was 
being prepared but decided to use 
it to reassert American economic in-
fluence in Egypt and provoke the 
oil producers into taking restrictive 
measures harmful to Western Eu-
is convinced that the rapid indus-
trial growth of the European Com-
munity and Japan in the past decade 
has given the U.S. a bad shock, and 
that Washiggton is gateful to the 
Arabs for having halted it. 
Collusion 
Theories 
SOME FRENCH commentators 
have, indeed, attributed the Mideast ' 
war and oil crisis to American-Soviet 
collusion. Contributors to Le Monde 
and other relatively sober papers , 
have written of "a high-level plot be- ' 
tween the Big Two" and "another 
Yalta." The purpose of the plot is al- , 
legedly to wreck the Common Mar-
ket, to strengthen each superpower's 
hold on "its" half of Europe, and to, 
partition the Near East. A second 
school of collusion theorists believes 
that Egypt will henceforth 'lie in 
America's sphere of influence, to-
gether with Israel, Jordan, Leba-
non, and Saudi Arabia; that the CIA 
will have a free hand to sort out 
Libya; and that Kuwait will in due 
course join Iraq. Syria, South -Ye,-
. 
men and Somalia in the USSR's 
shadow. 
This last theory is undoubtedly 
far-fetched. One does not need to 
be a collusion maniac to realize that 
the Soviet Union would..not be sorry 
to have the United States share its , 
Egyptian burden and may soon give 
priority to strategic and economic 
interests east of Suez. NATO offi-
cials take it for granted that when 
the Suez Canal is reopened, the 
Kremlin will double the size of its 
. naval force in the Indian Ocean and 
try to improve on its present Iraqi 
toehold in the Persian Gulf. 
The Soviets are becoming in-
creasingly interested in Arab oil, 
which they need in order to keep 
. 
them own oil exports flowing to Cen-
tral and Western Europe. They im-
ported 12 million tons in 1972 and 
plan to take 25 million tons this ' 
year, mostly from Iraq via a West-
ern-built pipeline across Syria. (Both 
Iraq and Syria arc, by a convenient ' 
coincidence, under the rule of mili-
tary juntas that profess allegiance to? 
, the pro-Soviet Baath party.) Mos-
cow pays for the oil with military 
hardware?a trade that may tempt 
it to stir the Mideast cauldron occa-
sionally.

THE GUARDIAN MANCHESTER 
9 April 1974 
Old myths obstacle to unity of Left 
EACH SUNDAY in recent 
weeks, Echo, the newspaper of 
the Greek armed forces, has 
published articles aimed at 
reviving memories of the coun-
try's hitter civil wars of the 
1940s. It has been dragging 
from the cupboard such skele-
tons as the Communists' "kid-
napping" of 28,000 children 
and their calls for the creation 
of an independent Macedonia. 
Now, it writes, "the aims are 
unaltered, but the tactics have 
changed, become more crafty, 
more treacherous." - 
The Communist Party has 
not been letting these attacks 
go unanswered and each 
Monday its foreign-based radio 
station, The Voice of Truth, has 
been giving the alternative 
view, pointing 'Out, for instance, 
how the "kidnapping" was 
designed to protect the children 
from " re-education " in the 
royalist schools?though it 
was often without the parents' 
consent ? and how the plans 
for an independent -Macedonia 
were severely condemned by 
the party after the two brief 
periods When they were pro-
'This raising of old boys 
reflects the extent to which the 
Greeks remain caught by their' 
past. It Is also iv:fleet:lye of the 
way that today the Communists 
ar the most active of the 
groups opposing the present 
Greek regime, showing their 
strength particularly during the 
student and . worker demon-
strations in November last year. 
Their powers have, however, 
been ',considerably reduced by 
the subsequent mass arrests 
and in particular by the seleing 
of key groups from the various

Left, like other European Lefts, 
et divided. 
The only group to have been 
left in relative peace; -apart 
from a few members being 
deported, is the so-called Com-
munist Party of the Interior ? 
as against the pro-Moscow or 
Exterior Party ? but this is 
less because the security police 
are unaware of its leaders than 
because they know this faction 
at present threatens less imme-
diate danger to the regime. 
There are, however, sug-
gestions that 'the authorities 
may extend to this, group the 
same practice of frequent short-
term arrests as it applies to the. 
other groups. 
Such arrests harm the Left's 
chances of building up 'the 
organisation necessary to take 
advantage of' the resistance 
opportunities which may 
emerge. But they do not affect 
the factors which contribute to 
the Left's appeal. Having 
benefited from the economic 
boom of the 'years 1967-72, 
urban workers are 'suddenly 
coming face to face with mount-
ing unemployment and the 
worst inflation in the OECD 
and are beginning to under-
stan d that the Colonels' 
" economic miracle" benefited 
the rich more than the poor 
with the tax system increasing 
income differences rather than 
reducing them. 
The unions offer little solace 
In this, as their leadership has 
been so purged since the 1967 
.coup that they fall to offer a 
viable channel of protest to 
those calling for social change. 
The 'regime appears to have 
been more concerned about 
further, trouble from the stu-
dents. 
The students have been More 
concerned with political than 
economic problems but they too 
express a growing ditsatisfac-
tion with the opposition to the 
regime by the old political 
Centre. Instead, the wide 
availability of the standard text 
books of the Left and the 30 
Eastern block radio broadcasts 
in Greek each day help to 
direct their opposition to the 
Left. 
"When the regime considers 
every opponent an anarcho-
Communist one can have few 
objections to becoming one," a 
recent visitor to .Athens said. 
The past seven years have 
helped to gain the Left the 
Image of a party of social 
justice among the opponents of 
the Government which it seeks 
and which, in 1958, won it 25 per 
cent of the vote in Greece. But 
memories of the earlier history 
remain and the articles of Echo 
and other pro-regime news-
papers seem designed to pre-
vent them from fading. 
Their results affect the whole 
political spectrum. They cause 
the armed forces to preserve 
the strongest traditions of the 
cold war, and contribute to the 
non-Communist opposition 
leaders avoiding talk of coo-
peration with the Left. They 
played a part in causing the 
Greek Communist Party to split 
In 1968. 
Today members of the Left 
describe the new wave of anti-
Communism as designed to 
make the unity of the opposi-
tion more difficult owing to 
bourgeois sensitiveness to the 
old myths. But even though 
leaders of the Communist Party 
of the Interior accept the need 
for the leadership to respond to 
30 
*hat they describe as the grow-
ing unity of the base, the 
chances of unification seem 
remote. The Interior Party 
insists on the right to examine 
critically by itself international 
problems. It rejects the accusa-
tion that it is anti-Soviet but 
says that it Is no uncondi-
tionally pro-Soviet ? as it 
proved when it criticised the 
Soviet invasion of Czechoslov-
akia. 
More serious problems arise 
on internal matters. The 
Exterior Party refuses to accept 
that there are two parties. It is 
not prepared to adopt such 
flexible tactics as the Interior 
Party to obtain the cooperation 
of the bourgeois parties in 
forming a common front to call 
for the creation of a popularly 
based constituent assembly to 
settle the futttre direction and 
framework for the country. 
It agrees with the Interior 
Party on the need to avoid iso-
lated actions of . resistance 
which separate the party from 
the people, as both consider 
that isolated explosions do. But 
Whereas the Interior Party 
argues In favour of mast; strikes 
as the "decisive weapon" In 
the struggle to force the regime 
to withdraw, the Exterior Party 
believes that TAM extreme 
methods may be necessary. 
It argues with the Interior 
Parity's line that socialism can 
be achieved in Greece through 
the parliamentary system, as 
Allende believed in Chile and 
Togliatti in Italy. 
Until mid-1973 it was far less 
a force than the Interior Party 
but its control of most of the 
Eastern block radios con-
tributed to its gradual build up 
so that now it has become a 
serious factor in Greece's frac-
tured but uncrushed Left.

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 1974 
The Debate Over Diego Garcia 
BY RICHARD J. LEVINE 
WASHINGTON?Diego Garcia is a tiny 
coral 10)and in the middle of the Indian 
Ocean, .lying a thousand miles off the 
southern tip of India and halfway around 
the world from Washington. 
Isolated and uninspiring, the small 
hunk of British real estate would seem an 
, ? 
unlikely candidate for attention in this cri-
sis-oriented capital. 
?But a Pentagon plan to build a naval 
support base on Diego Garcia?unveiled in 
the aftermath of the Middle East war and 
the Arab oil embargo?has begun to gener-
ate a lively though limited foreign policy-
national security debate here. Nixon ad-
ministration officials see the proposed 
base as a logical and effective means of 
protecting America's interests in that part 
of the world, offsetting growing Soviet 
naval power. But some in Congress fear 
the base could lead to a U.S.-Soviet naval 
race in the Indian Ocean, an area that has 
been largely spared superpower rivalry, 
and eventually add billions of dollars to 
Navy shipbuilding budgets without enhanc-
ing U.S. security. 
While U.S. Senators call for Washing-
ton-Moscow talks on naval limitations in 
the Indian Ocean, many of America's 
friends and foes denounce the Diego Gar-
cia plan. In the end, the debate could pro-
vide important clues to how serious Con-
gTess is about playing a larger, more 
forceful role in foreign policy as America 
emerges from its painful decade in Viet-
nam. 
"From our experience in Indochina, we 
know too well the cost of early, easy con-
gressional and State Department acquies-
cence to Pentagon demands," says Sen. 
Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), a leading oppo-
nent of the base plan. "We must profit 
from ?Ur past errors. Our handling of this 
authorization request for Diego Garcia of-
fers such an opportunity." ' 
Narrow Issues 
Unfortunately, much of the debate thus 
far has focused on such relatively narrow 
issues as the comparative number of U.S. 
and Soviet "ship days" in- the Indian 
Ocean and the length of the runway on the 
island. Often lost in the din of detail are 
the basic questions raised by the Pentagon 
plan?whether the U.S. should be involved 
in the project at all; whether, or how, U.S. 
Interests are served by increasing the ; 
Navy's still limited presence in this far-off 
ocean; whether, as one former Pentagon' 
planner put it, "we would be willing to let 
events take their course around the rim of 
the Indian Ocean." 
Specifically, the Defense Department is 
asking Congress for $32.3 million to expand 
an existing communications station on , 
Diego Garcia into a base capable of refuel-
ing and restocking U.S. warships, includ-
ing aircraft carriers, operating in the In-
dian Ocean. The base would be manned by 
about 600 men and would enable the Navy 
to increase its Indian Ocean deployments 
?either routinely or in a crisis?without 
weakening its forces in the Western Pa-
cific. 
Yesterday the Senate Armed Services 
Committee postponed "without prejudice" 
a request for $29 million for Diego Garcia 
construction contained in a supplemental 
budget bill for the Pentagon?a setback 
that is likely to be challenged by adminis-
tration supporters in the full Senate. And 
today the House Is scheduled to vote on a 
proposal to delete the same $29 million 
from a companion measure. 
To justify the U.S. buildup, the Nixon 
administration has stressed the expanding 
operations of the SovietAl ta IrVpnR

r, Ocean (which Navy men expect to acceler-
ate with the reopening of the Suez Canal) 
; and the increasing reliance of the U.S. on 
I Persian Gulf oil that must be transported 
across the Indian Ocean. "Our military 
presence in the Indian Ocean provides 
tangible evidence of our concern for secu-
rity and stability in a region where signifi-
cant U.S. interests are located," declares 
James Noyes, Deputy Defense Secretary. 
for Near Eastern, African and South Asian 
Affairs. 
By Pentagon standards, the Diego Gar-
cia request is a mere pittance, less than 
one-third the price of a modern destroyer. 
Moreover, Defense Department and State 
Department officials have sought to down-
play the potential long-range significance 
of the naval base by referring repeatedly 
to their plans for a "modest support facil-
ity." 
. Still, a number of lawmakers and out-
side experts remain uneasy, fearful that 
congressional approval of the construction 
money could prove a fateful step down an 
unmarked road toward yet another expen-
sive and, conceivably, dangerous security 
commitment. Adding to their concern is 
the small-step-by-small-step pattern of 
.U.S. involvement in the Indian Ocean: first 
a few warships; next a communications 
,station; then a support base. Where, they 
worry, is it leading? 
Despite administration assertions to the 
contrary, U.S. interest in the Indian Ocean 
has been rather limited until recently. 
Only three years ago, Ronald Spiers, then 
director of the State Department's Bureau 
of Politico-Military Affairs, could tell Con-
gress: "The Indian Ocean area, unlike Eu-
rope and Asia, is one which has been only 
on the margins of U.S. attention. Never 
considered of great importance to the cen-
tral balance of power, it has been on the 
edges of great-power rivalry." 
Since 1948, the U.S. presence in this 
part of the world has consisted mainly of 
the Middle East force?a flagship based in 
the Sheikdom of Bahrain and two destroy-
ers that Make periodic port calls. That 
such a modest force was considered ade-
quate testifies to the low strategic impor-
tance Washington attached to the world's 
third largest ocean. 
U.S. interest began building. In the early. 
1960s. One result was the British Indian 
Ocean territory agreement between the 
United Kingdom and the U.S. In 1966, 
under which Washington acquired the 
basic right to build military facilities on 
Diego Garcia. Washington's interest quick-
ened in 1968, with the British announce-
ment of plans to withdraw military forces 
east of Suez and the appearance of the 
first Soviet warships. Since then, the Sovi-
ets have steadily increased their naval 
forces, and current navy estimates rive 
them a four-to-one advantage over the U.S. 
in the Indian Ocean. 
- -access to port facilities. For example, Rus-
sian vessels currently use the expanded 
? Iraqi port of Umm Qasr and the former' 
British base at Aden; meanwhile, the Sovi-
ets are expanding their naval facilities at 
the Somali port of Berbera. "The Soviets 
possess a support system in the (Indian 
Ocean) area that is substantially more ex-
tensive than that of the U.S.," asserts 
, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, Chief of Naval Open 
ations. 
As the Soviet presence increased, the 
, U.S. responded by sending carrier task 
forces into the Indian Ocean twice in 1971, 
in April and again in December, during 
the Indo-Pakistan war. Last October, a 
few months after the Diego Garcia com-
munications station opened and as the 
Mideast ceasefire was taking effect, the 
Defense Department unexpectedly moved 
a task force headed by the carrier Han-
cock into the Indian Ocean. 
On Nov. 30, Defense Secretary James 
Echlesincey, disclosing that the Hancock 
would be replaced by the Oriskany? an-
nounced that in the future the Navy would 
establish a "pattern of regular visits into 
the Indian Ocean and we ,expect that our 
presence there will be more frequent and 
more regular than in the past." Since then, 
major U.S. vessels have been in the ocean 
without letup. 
Why? Administration officials offer a 
variety of explanations?to counterbalance 
Soviet "influence" on states around the In-
dian Ocean; to maintain "continued ac-
cess" to vital Mideast oil supplies; to in-
sure freedom of the seas; simply to dem-
onstrate our "interest" in that Area of the 
world. 
The State Department emphasizes the 
diplomatic value of the Navy. "A military 
presence can support effective diplomacy 
without its ever having to be used," says 
Seymour Weiss, director of State's politi-
co-military affairs bureau. Privately Pen-
tagon officials, not surprisingly, place 
greater weight on the military value of. 
Warships in the Indian Ocean. The increas-
ing U.S. Navy operations, a Navy man 
says, are needed "to show we are a credi-
ble military power in that part of the 
world." 
But critics of the Diego Garcia proposal 
are troubled by these explanations, which, 
they believe, raise more questions than 
they answer. 
Gunboat Diplomacy 
Some critics wonder whether the pres-
ence of larger numbers of U.S. warships in 
the Indian Ocean will, as Naval Chief Zum-
walt claims, help preserve "regimes that 
are friendly to the U.S." in the area. "Gun-
boat diplomacy doesn't really seem to 
work" in this age, argues a government 
analyst. Internal problems and economic 
assistance, he believes, have a much 
greater bearing on the political course fol-
lowed by foreign governments. What is 
clear is that several states in the area?in-
eluding Australia, New Zealand, India, 
Madagascar and Sri Lanka (Ceylon)?
have publicly opposed the Diego Garcia 
support base, arguing that the Indian 
'Ocean should be a "zone of peace." 
Furthermore, there Are some military 
experts who doubt that Soviet ships in the 
Indian Ocean pose a serious threat to 
Western tankers carrying precious Arab 
oil. In the opinion of Gene La Rocque, a re-
tired rear admiral who often criticizes 
Pentagon policies, an attack on, or inter-
ference with, such, shipping "doesn't ap-
pear to be a plausible action on the part of 
the Soviet Union when one takes into ac-
count such important factors as relative

alternative means of exerting influence 
and powr at the disposal of the Soviet' 
Union." 
Other; military analysts have -argued 
that .it lo highly improbable the Soviets 
would aiiack ;Western ships since such a; 
hostile at would likely trigger the out-
break of a major war between the super-
powers, Geoffrey Jukes, an Australian an-
alyst, has written: "It is difficult to envis-! 
age a sititstion, short of world nuclear 
war, in which the Soviet government would! 
be prepared to place the bulk of its mer-' 
chant fleet at risk by engaging to 'inter-
fere with Western shipping in the Indiair 
or -any other ocean." ? 
Much more liekly, critics of the Diego' 
Garcia plan; stress, is a repetition of the re-
cent Arab oil embargo, a political act de-. 
signed to achieve political aims. It is! 
argued that the presence of sizable naval 
forces can, at best, have only a minimal; 
impact in such a situation. 
Finally, there is the unsettling prospect' 
that a base at Diego Garcia, coupled with 
increased naval depolyments in the Indian 
Ocean, will provide the Navy in years to; 
come with new rationales for an "Indian' 
Ocean fleet" and ever-bigger shipbuilding 
budgets, especially for carriers and es-
corts..The Navy, a Pentagon insider notes, 
"has been panting on the edges of the op-
portunity" represented by enlarged Indian 
Ocean commitments. 
A Call for Negotiations 
To prevent a costly U.S.-Soviet naval' 
race, which might not enhance either na-
tion's security, Sen. Pell and Sen. Edward; 
Kennedy (D., Mass.) have jointly intro-
duced a resolution calling for negotiations ? 
between the superpowers on limiting naval 
facilities and warships in the Indian 
Ocean. - 
As in the past, the U.S. remains reluc-
tant to agree in writing to any restrictions ' 
on its use of the high seas. Moreover, U.S.. 
officials say efforts to follow up a Soviet 
hint in 1971 of interest in naval limitation; 
talks failed to produce a response from the ; 
Kremlin. 
Still, in view of the potential long-range ; 
costs and dangers involved in an expanded ' 
naval presence in the Indian Ocean, it ; 
would seem worthwhile to pursue the mat- ; 
ter further. For, as Sen. Kennedy has said, ; 
"It may in time prove necessary and de- ; 
sirable for the U.S. to compete with the Sol ; 
viet Union in military .and naval force in ; 
this distant part of the globe. But before 
that happens we owe it to ourselves, as ; 
well as to all the people of the region, to 
try preventing yet another arms race." 
Mr. Levine, a member of the Jour-
nal's Washington bureau, writes on mili-
tary affairs. 
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
27 March 1974 
Naval rivalry in Indian Ocean 
??? The Middle East October war, 
the oil crisis, and the projected 
reopening of the Suez Canal have 
Combined to focus attention on the 
Indian Ocean as an arena of super-
power naval rivalry. 
And the littoral states, headed 
by India, are increasingly con-
cerned about the actual and poten-
tial buildup of the Soviet and 
American navies in this vital ex-
panse of water. Their concern has 
touched off a wave of protests 
against American plans to convert 
the existing U.S. communications 
station on the British-owned 'In-
dian Ocean island of Diego Garcia 
into a- naval support base able to 
handle long4ange aircraft. 
There are doubts now whether 
the American-British agreement 
on Diego Garcia will ever go 
through, not so much because of 
the outcry of the Indian Ocean 
'states and their friends, but be-
cause of opposition to the agree-
ment in the American Congress 
'and the change of government in 
London. 
Announced just before the Brit-
ish elections last month, the 
agreement had the full support , of 
Edward Heath's ? Conservative 
government. It was the type of 
,arrangement that the Conserva-
tives, with their traditional con-
cept of a global strategy to counter 
Soviet naval expansion, would 
back to the hilt. But the Labour 
Party, despite their desire to culti-
vate friendship with the U.S., has' 
a different approach and is more 
sensitive to the feelings of the 
Indian Ocean countries. The new 
Labour government is now re-
viewing the agreement and the 
whole problem of superpower ri-
valry in the Indian Ocean. 
32 
In the meantime the Labour 
government in Australia, which 
sides with the Indian Ocean coun-
tries, has sought to place the 
matter on the agenda of the Kis-
singer-Brezhnev talks in Moscow 
by sending messages to the super-
powers urging them to limit their 
naval operations in the ocean. 
India and its neighbors say that 
the U.S. by developing the Diego 
Garcia base would be guilty of 
escalating the superpower navies 
already in the ocean. The U.S. 
contends that the base is needed to 
counter the Soviet naval buildup 
which has doubled in the past year 
and is likely to be further in-
creased once the Suez Canal is 
reopened. It says a strong Western 
naval force is essential to protect. 
the vital oil routes from the Per-
sian Gulf, and the trade routes to 
the Far East. 
It is the prospect of the presence 
In their ocean of nuclear subma-
rines and nuclear-armed planes 
that worries the littoral states the 
most. Understandably enough 
they ask: Where will the naval 
race stop? 
They point to the fact that the' 
United Nations General Assembly 
In three resolutions since 1971 has 
declared the Indian Ocean a "zone 
of peace:' and has called on the big 
powers to halt escalation of their 
military presence. there and to 
keep the ocean free from military 
bases and nuclear weapons. The 
UN appeals have been ignored by' 
the superpowers. 
An agreement to keep the war-, 
ships of all nonlittoral states out of ' 
the ocean is hardly realistic. But ? 
an undertaking by the super-
powers to balance their forces 
there ? and place a ceiling on 
them -- would surely be feasible.

paid to India's remarkable

One reason for this over-

Indian protests seriously; 
"Of course, the Indian 
leaders would rather not

'India Is Sinking Pee' per 
Into Crisis and Anguish. 
By BERNARD WEINRAUB 
SpecI41 to The New York Thneg 
NEW DELHI, April I6?India," 
a democracy in anguish, is im-
mersed in a deepening economic 
and political crisis marked by 
agitation, self-questioning and 
drift. 
. Food shortages, corruption, 
radicalism, inflation, indecision ,1 
oil prices, the sluggish bureauc-j position parties, the rising ex-
pectations of tens of millions! 
I in a nation where 200 millionl 
earn less than $40 a year. 1 
But a chorus of opposition 
places the blame squarely upon 
Mrs. Gandhi. They say that 
the 56-year-old Prime Minister, 
in power since 1966, has failed 
to shape a coherent policy, has 
tolerated bungling and corrup-
tion to keep her party in firm 
'power, has surrounded herself 
with "courtiers" and inept ad-
visors and, perhaps most sig-
nificant, has been unable tol 
articulate a realistic vision. 
1 
"The Prime Minister has no 
program, no world view, no: 
grand design," B. G. Vergliese 
a former advisor to Mn 
Gandhi and now editor of Th 
Hindustan Times, said in a re 
cent attack on the Government. 
"Bereft of a frame, she has 
.merely reacted to events and 
failed to shape them." 
, "Not since independence has 
the country faced such a deep 
and all-pervasive crisis as it 
does today," he added. "There 
, are visible signs of disintegra-
tion. The rot has spread so far 
and so deep that it will not be 
: easy to restore credibility to the 
Government." 
I Large-scale violence over food 
shortages and corruption in two 
Indian states?Gujarat, where 
90 people have been killed, and 
Bihar, with 28 deaths?has un-
derlined the discontent. "The 
general feeling is that something 
has gone very wrong some-
where," said Rajni Kothari, a 
prominent political scientist. 
A sense of rot?it is a com-
monly used word these days? 
is pervasive. 
The capital's electricity and 
water supply break down with 
increasing frequency. A busi-
nessman slams down his phone 
and says it is an official of the 
governing Congress party who 
is threatening him again with 
denunciation unless a job, set 
aside for an untouchable, is 
given to the politician's son. 
Wheat, sugar and milk are 
scarce except at rising black-
market prices. 
A member of Parliament asks 
a Cabinet minister about the 
source of the Congress party's 
recent campaign funds, and the 
minister replies that it is no 
one's business. A woman, asked . 
by an airline steward to give up 
. her front-row scat to a govern-
ment official, says: "Why should 
I? They're all corrupt! 
A farmer in Orissa says that 
Prime Minister Millar Gan-
dhi, the dominant figure in the 
nation, concedes that India is 
facing a severe test but at-
tributes the situation to forces 
beyond her control: increased 
oil costs, drought, labor and 
student tensions fueled by op-
racy, the population spiral, 
declining income, and lagging 
production have interlocked, 
creating a sense of gloom and 
cynicism. 
? What makes the crisis espe-
, ially painful to critics as well 
as supporters of the Govern-
ment is that the nation is a 
genuine democracy?a rarity in 
Asia?and its myriad problems 
are in part a result of an open 
system that combines free-
wheeling politics and Govern-
Iment accountability 'with tough 
!economic choices. 
dian Ocean, India is. the 
largest and most powerful, 
country in the area. 
India's protests against, 
foreign powers in the Indi-
an Ocean have risen in in-
tensity only in the last five 
years. 
In 1963 .when the 7th 
.Fleet was reported cruis-
ing the Indian Ocean, New 
Delhi's reaction was mild. 
India was then recover-
ing from wounds inflicted 
by China in the 1962 bor-
der war and was receiving 
American military ass,is-
tance. 
Today, India is one of the 
chief backers of the 1971 
U.N. General Assembly re-
solution declaring the In-' 
dian Ocean a zone of peace. 
The motion passed 60 to 
0, with 55 abstentions. 
The United States, Bri-
tain, France and even the 
Soviet Union abstained. 
None of the great mari-
time powers accepts the 
principle that traffic on 
the high seas should be in-
terfered with in any way. 
In December, 1972. Sec-
retary General Kurt Wald-
heim set up a 15-nation ad 
hoe committee to suggest 
practical steps to promote 
peace in the Indian Ocean.' 
Last November, the U.N. 
Political Committee asked 
Waldheim to prepare a 
"factual statement" re-
garding military presence, 
of the big powers in all its 
world population lives on aspects.

die of the afternoon. There's no 
dynamism, no sense of effort; 
It's flabby." 
The central problem of India; 
?rooted poverty?remains un-
checked and seems to be get- ! 
ting worse. For the third year; 
out of four per capita income 
is expected to drop. Nearly 80 
per cent) of the children are 
malnourished. Consumption of 
food, edible oil and cotton cloth 
has declined. More than 70 per 
cent of the populace are illiter-
ate. The educational system, 
which one critic terms callous-
ly neglected, is turning out men 
and women for the unemploy-
ment rolls at an astonishing 
pace. Over 70 per cent of the 
140,000 doctors remain in the 
cities, and usually in the af-
fluent districts, while 80 per 
cent of the people are in rural 
areas. , 
Inflation is the worst on rec-
ord here, and there has been 
a 50 per cent increase in food 
prices in two years. This has 
jolted virtually all classes in a 
country where food costs may 
amount to 50 to 70 per cent of 
a family budget. 
Coal Output Declines 
Industrial production is ex-
pected to show no growth this 
year. Coal output, providing 70 
per cent of industrial energy, 
is lagging because of sloppy 
management in the nationalized 
industry and railway bottle-
necks. 
In turn, the railroads are 
deteriorating, and a threatened 
strike may cripple the nation. 
Steel production, vital to 
economic development, slipped 
badly last year, and some 
plants are working at 20 to 40 
per cent of capacity. Fertilizer 
plants, key to food production, 
are operating at less than 60 
per cent of capacity, also be-
cause of inept management 
and shortages. 
Food production is the most 
glaring omen. Minimum re-
quirements are 106 million to 
110 million tons of grain a 
year. Last year, mostly be-
cause of drought, production 
fell to 95 million tons, for the 
1973-74 agricultural year, end-
ing in June, the expectation 
Is 103 million to 105 million 
tons, partly because of a Gov-
ernment policy that soured. 
The Government's decision to 
take over the distribution of 
wheat resulted in a booming 
black market, angry resentment 
among farmers and traders and 
a breakdown in supplies. 
"Tampering with food for the 
sake of socialist ideology is 
dangerous unless a government 
knows what it's getting into," 
an economist said. "This Gov-
ernment didn't." Last month 
the Government scrapped the 
take-over. 
Clearly India Is suffering 
from some of the same ills as 
other countries, only more so. 
Oil bills this year may account 
for 50 per cent of export earn-
ing, compared with 20 per cent 
last year. The population of 508 
million is increasing at 13 mil-
lion a year and will probably 
reach a billion in less than 30 
years. 
. The economic torpor seems 
symptomatic of deeper prob-
lem*. Cynicism Is rampant: The 
Government's socialist slogans 
and calls for austerity are 
mocked in view of bribes and 
corruption, luxury construction 
and virtually open illegal con-
tributions by businessmen ,to 
the Congress party. 
Said Mr. Varghese, the edi-
tor: "Radical rhetoric has be-
come an affectation, a game, 
another gimmick, a promise of 
jam tomorrow even while infla-
tion, corruption and economic 
stagnation are taking the bread 
out of people's mouths today." 
The cynicism is breeding 
labor unrest and indiscipline 
among workers, who feel they 
are not sharing the fruits of 
the acquisitiveness and flow 
of money. 
As for ministerial fumbling, 
Mrs. Gandhi's angriest critics 
maintain that she has sur-
rounded herself with non-enti-
ties and "tired yes men." Dis-
gruntled officials in the Gov-
ernment concede privately that 
the caliber of the Cabinet is 
poor and, more significant, 
that Mrs. Gandhi has retained 
men whose performance has 
proved dismal. Two key min-
isters are openly derided: 
Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, the 
Food Minister, and D. P. Dhar, 
the Planning Minister. 
"Of all the poverties facing 
India today it is the poverty of 
the mind that is the most seri-
ous," said G. K. Reddy, a lead-
ing commentator. "The politi-
cians de a feeble and fright-
ened lot, intellectually mediocre. 
They remain bogged down in 
their own inconsistencies as the 
country goes through political 
and moral confusion." 
Her Popularity Soared 
Three years ago Mrs. Gandhi 
toppled the ,old guard in her 
party and won a striking elec-
tion victory. India's triumph 
over Pakistan in the Bangla-
desh war plus Mrs. Gandhi's 
populist slogan, "abolish pover-
ty" and her radical rhetoric 
buoyed her to a level of popu-
larity that seemed to surpass 
that of her father, Jawaharlal 
Nehru. 
"She had tremendous guts 
and determination," a forme; 
senior official, commented. 
? "People thought she could be 
a new Gandhi. But it all some-
how got lost in the process of 
politicking. Gandhi was a rebel 
and a change agent. Mrs. Gan-
dhi only turned out to be a 
rebel." 
"You can't change India 
without paying a heavy social 
price ? breaking up the caste 
and hierarchical system, trying 
to put an end to corruption, 
having the tenacity to identify, 
and meet the problems," the 
official added. "We indulge in 
all the luxuries that a poor so-
ciety can't afford. We resist 
change.' 
What has gone wrong in the 
Jest three years? The impact of 
10-million refugees from Ban-
gladesh, the cost of the war 
with Pakistan and two subse-
quent years of drought have 
severely dislocated an already 
shaky economy. Drought relief, 
deficit financing and raises for 
Government servants have in-
tensified inflation. ? 
Critics of the Government in-
creasingly discuss what they 
term India's self-created diffi-
culties and man-made short-
ages. These include the failure 
to build irrigation facilities and 
fertilizer plants and continuing 
allocations of funds for heavy 
industries, such as steel, that 
are unprofitable and create lit-
tle mass employment; a re-
strictive licensing policy that 
thwarts business growth and 
private investment; wildcat 
strikes; reduced coal production 
and the breakdown of the rail-
ways and power supplies; inept 
and unrealistic planning, pro-
jecting growth figures that 
planners concede are distorted; 
a mood of inertia, perhaps even 
paralysis, in government caused 
by Mrs. Gandhi's highly private 
and intuitive style. 
Nehru's Paths Avoide.I 
The critics say the Govern-
ment is afflicted by factional-
ism, random-shot policies and 
a failure to involve state leaders 
in decisions or endow them 
with autonomy?paths that 
Prime Minister Nehru strenu-
ously shaped. 
"The kind of centralization 
that 'has taken place has para-
lyzed the normal processes of 
Bureaucratic functioning," said 
Mr. Kothari,' a prominent politi-
cal scientist. "Everyone knows 
how vital decisiens on food, 
power, transportation and other 
key policy issues have been de-
layed and the economy brought 
to a near-standstill because top 
politicians, too involved in sort-
ing out day-to-day pressures, 
have not been able to make up 
their minds. The upshot of all 
this is that the mechanism per-
fected by Mr. Nehru is not per-
forming any longer." ? 
Linked to this seems to be a' 
loss of credibility by the Gov-
ernment and the Congress party 
and a gap between tough so-
cialist rhetoric and deeds. 
"The first thing the Govern-
ment needs to do is establish

The most enduring problems 
have been met, by all accounts, 
with only tentative steps. In-

guests arrived the next day 
the agents were gone and 
were not seen again. 
"It's called 'leaving in 
your socks' in the espionage 
business," Le Carre said, 
writing it all down. The CIA 
office stood locked and de-
serted for a while ? and in 
early January the news of 
the agents' departure broke 
in the Bangkok press. Fi-
nally, the Thai landlord 
asked the local Americans 
to come and take away their 
strange machines, according 
.1 to our source, but none of 
the Americans left in town 
had any responsibility for 
? the equipment and no one 
knew what to do. Our 
source thought the machines 
had something to do with 
codes and radios. At last, 
some Americans arrived to 
reclaim the equipment. 
? Some Thai youths broke 
in to steal the air condition-
ers, and today the hous 
stands forlorn and empty. 
Le Carre said that it' h 
were writing a spy story 
about the whole affair he 
,could not possibly' have the 
agent write such a letter on 
his own without authority 
from his bosses in Bangkok. 
That would be too unbelieV-
able. 
More likely the letter had 
been written in Bangkok 
and sent to the agent for 
mailing so that it would 
have a northeastern post-
mark. 
What about the mail boy 
registering the letter? We 
asked. Is it possible that a 
first-rate intelligence service 
like the CIA would make a 
stupid mistake like that? 
"Oh yes, quite possible," 
Le Carre said with some de-
light. "It happens all the 
time. When indoubt about 
something like this assume, 
a screw-up." 
If he were to write a 
novel about ? the spies who 
came in from Sakhon Nak-
hon, Le Carre said he might 
assume two possible scenar-
ios. If the operation were 
in the "clean tricks depart-
ment," Le Carre said, the 
motive might have been to ?. 
"put two imponderable 
forces into collision to see 
how both would . react." 
There was Thailand with a 
new civilian government. A 
fake letter from the insur-
gents might bring a genuine 
response. 
"I would also assume that 
the CIA had the means to 
observe the effect of this 
collision on the rebels, that 
the CIA was engaged here 
in reinfliltrating defectors 
back into the, insurgent 
ranks." 
If the CIA had burned a 
defector into their trousers, 
which. is spy talk for black-
mailing somebody into be-
coming a double agent, per-
haps they had someone high ' 
up in the' rebel ranks? 
"If it were a clean trick it . 
might have been -a genuine 
effort,to bring about concili-" 
ation," Le Carre said. If, on 
e the other hand, it were a 
"dirty trick" the motive 
e might have been to prevent 
, negotiations by "interposing 
the CIA as a bogey between 
the two parties." 
One can always tell a CIA 
house in northeast Thailand 
because, no matter how in-
nocent-looking they are, 
they bristle with air condi-
tioners. They often have big 
electric transformers ? out-
side as well?something to

members of this Administration have shown for repre-
sentatives of the American people, particularly in regard 
to Vietnam. 
It was nothing short of outrageous for Ambassador 
Martin to suggest, even by innuendo, that those who 
favor holding down American military aid to Saigon are 
somehow linked to Hanoi's views or secretly desire 
Hanoi to take over South Vietnam. Secretary Kissinger 
has expressed disbelief that this was what Mr. Martin 
meant._ But a direct denial by the Ambassador that he ,

discover that he has secretly been 
advising the State Department to deny 
Congress an "honest and detailed"

old cold warrior, Sen. Barry Gold-

elusion that Vietnam is a bottomless 
pit for U.S. assistance. "Let's scratch 
It" is his advice. 
Ambassador Martin, on the other 
hand, goes right on talking?almost 
word for word ? as L.B.J. and Mr.

ended more than 14 month ago, Mar-

rather than reducing, military and 
economic support for President Thieu's 
authoritarian government. Echoing 
countless old speeches by Johnson 
and Mr. Nixon, he says victory is just 
around the corner. All that is needed 
is just one ,more big U.S. push. 
"To walk away from it just at this

After getting his hands on the

to congressional inquiries-- about the 
present state of things in Vietnam, 
Sen. Kennedy said, "The cable raises 
the most profound questions about 
; which country and whose interests 
Ambassador Martin is truly represent-
ing." 
!1 Fortunately, Secretary? of State 
Henry Kissinger did not take Martin's 
? advice, but he is not in a position to 
remove the ambassador even* though 
' his usefulness is now largely compro-
mised because, in the final analysis; 
the ambassador has merely been par-

is a little crude and a little out of

sometimes wrong but seldom out of 
date, flinch a bit. 
In the next fiscal year beginning 
July 1, the administration wants to 
spend about $3.5 billion in southeast 
Asia. This figure is more than the 
Administration plans to spend for

of the world combined. 
It represents a boost. of about 65% 
in aid for South Vietnam.

Hanoi's New Strategy in South Vietna 
? ?A Communist document captured by 
government forces in Binh Thuan 
province on South Vietnam's central 
coast six weeks ago points to tragedy 
growing out of the Nixon administra-
tion's bungled campaign in Congress 
for continued aid to Saigon. 
The document spells out unequivo-
cally what the Communist high corn-
mand in Hanoi really wants: "The rev-
olution in South Vietnam can only he 
won by means of armed violence in 
close coordination with the political vi-
olence of the masses." This is not local 
bombast. Rather, the directive is based 
on a -secret resolution setting out a 
muscular strategy for the entire south. 
That sharply contradicts propaganda 
spread in Congress by radical "peace" 
groups that enntinued bloodshed in 
South Vietnam is caused by Saigon.

Once More, 
Defining the 
Commitment 
To Indochina. H 
By LESLIE II. GELB 
WASHINGTON?The scene has a strong sense of dela vu: ' 
two American leaders engaging on the subject of the Ameri-
can commitment to Indochina. 
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, 
has received a letter , from Secretary of State Henry Kis-
singer. It Is a response, dated March 13, 1974, to Mr. Ken-
nedy's queries about American obligations and other matters 
concerning Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Senator reads 
' these words: 
"The U.S. has no bilateral written commitment to the , 
Government of the Republic of Vietnam. However, as a 
signator of the Paris agreement . . . the United States 
committed itself to strengthening the conditions which made 
the cease-fire possible and to the goal of the South Viet-
namese people's right to self-determination. . . . We also 
recognize that we have derived a certain obligation from 
our long and deep involvement. . . . We have thus com-
mitted ourselves very substantially, both politically and 
morally. . ." 
Senator Kennedy Issues a press release welcoming- the 
secretary's candor, but calling it a "disturbing clarification 
of our present policy in Indochina." He says "it shatters 
the hope that we could finally disengage from our direct 
and often mani ulative    
Involvement...".  
Was Mr. Kissinger's letter an enlargement of his or the 
President's other recent statements on this subject? Should But what more co& 0 6.5wnsogitr 
fatigue is a combination of ineptitude 
and lassitude by the Watergate-obessed 
Nixon administration. No effective lob-
bying effort abs been launched. Secre-
tary of Stete Henry Kissinger's letter 
to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy justifying 
the aid on'the basis of private and ver-
bal Paris peace agreements, did not 
help. Far worse was disclosure of an 
outrageous and self-defeating cable-
gram by the usually astute Graham 
Martin, U.S. Ambassador to Saigon, 
urging that Kennedy not be given an 
"honest and detailed answer" about Vi-
etnam aid. 
The major administration effort was 
a plea before a closed-door House Re-
publican caucus March 26 by Vice 
President Ford. Shortly thereafter, 
the adminstration lost a critical test 
for more military aid on the House 
floor by 20 votes. Some Republican 
congressmen. feel the anti-Saigon tide 
on Capitol Hill is so strong that even 
an all-out Nixon adminstration effort 
could not reverse it. 
If so, the last chapter of the tragic 
Vietnam story may be drenched in 
irony. At the cost of so much Ameri-
can blood, treasure and political tur-
moil, the Saigon regime at last has es-
tablished itself politically and militar-
ily, as even Communists documents , 
concede. Having reached this point, 
however, its worst threat now is not 
Hanoi's aggrssive designs but inepti4 
?tude and battle fatigue in Washington. 
n 1974. Field Enterprises, Ino. 
Before the signing of the Paris accords, Mr. Kissinger was 
asked at a press conference how the agreement affected the 
American commitment. He answered that Washington would 
continue to provide economic and military aid as permitted 
by the accords. He added that the "United States expects 
all countries to live up to the provisions of the agreement." 
The Nixon Administration feels it is committed 'to resist 
the forcible overthrow of the Saigon regime. The President 
and Mr. Kissinger have said this repeatedly. This assuiedly ? 
came as no surprise to Senator Kennedy. 
What did seem surprising was that Mr. Kis-singer directly 
linked the present American commitment to the Paris ac-
cords themselves. Is there a basis for this? Here, from their 
known positions, is a hypothetical discussion of thr question. 
Mr. Kissinger apparently would argue that the accords 
carry with them an obligation by the partici to assure 
implementation. But critics would say that the accords are 
like a contract Each party has the right, but not necessarily 
the commitment, to insure compliance. They would add that 
even if the Nixon Administration feels itself bound, the 
United States is not. The accords were not sent to the 
Senate as a treaty for approval. The Administration would? 
answer that actions taken by the executive are binding on 
the nation. 
The critics would respond that there is nothing In the 
accords that binds the Nixon Administration to an open-
ended commitment. The responsibility for control and super-
vision Is supposed to rest with a four-power international 
/ commission which was to work with the great powers, con-
vened in an international conference, to guarantee the 
accords. 
The Nixon Administration would retort that the inter-
national conference did not assume responsibility for guar-
anteeing the agreement and that the international commis-
sion cannot do more than bear witness to violations. Then, 
guaranteeing the accords is an American responsibility. 
But apart from the Paris accords, does the United States 
have some kind of secret arrangement with Saigon? Mr. 
Kissinger's letter said that Washington had "no bilateral 
written commitment" But this does not mean that Wash-
ington has not given Saigon secret assurances.

in Cambodia. 
This is about the same 
level as American support 
in Vietnam in early 1965 be-
fore the United States en-
tered the war with combat 
? forces. 
I Except for dollar imput, 
however, no one is suggest-
ing ? there is a parallel in 
. U.S. involvement here. The 
American determination to 
avoid direct participation in 
any futher Asian conflict is 
well known?and is accept-
' ed?by Khmers here. 
The hope remains that 
America n generosity will 
continue at its present flow, 
or even increase, Cambodian 
officials emphasized. 
Seeing the Lou Nol gov-
ernment through its present 
,peril is also the desire of the 
Ameeican official establish-
ment here?military an ddip-
lomatic ? which is limited 
by congressional edict to no 
more than 200 persons. 
"TVs a moral obligation, as 
I view it, said one Ameri-
can official. 
While Cambodia's civil war 
was triggered by the ouster 
Of Prince Norodom Sihanouk 
In 1379, no evidence was sur-
faced to support claims that 
the. upheaval had American 
backing. The moral obliga-
tion began, the official said, 
when "American forces from 
Vietnam crossed into North 
Vieteamese sanctuaries in 
Cambodia and the war here 
bezarne general." 
American intentions are of 
particular interest in Phe-
nom Penh at the moment be-
..cause of the arrival of the 
new U.S. ambassador, John 
Gunther Dean. Fresh from 
serviez! in Laos, where as No. 
2 diplomat (the Ambasador-
ship was open), Dean is cred-
ited with being a skillful 
middleman negotiator who 
helped bring about the just-
formed coalition government 
in Laos composed of wartime 
enemies. 
So the ,youthful D e a n?
? who like Dr. Henry Kissin-
ger is a German-born, natu-
ralized American?comes to 
his new assignment with the 
laurel of "peacemaker." How-
ever, for the time '\heing it 
seems apparent that he must 
continue current American 
polizy of helping Lon Not 
make war. 
Dean is just settling in, 
and not ready to express 
opinions. But other dip16-
mats contend there still is.. 
a pressing need for Non' 
Nol to demonstrate that the 
rebels cannot impose their 
will militarily?that a nego-
tiated settlement is the only 
solution., , 
Already controlling four- , 
fifths of the countryside and 
about half of Cambodia's 8 
million people, the ? insur-
gents were believed ready to 
deliver knockout punches 
against government-held cit-
,ies and towns during the dry 
season, now within a month 
, of ending. 
While the pressure on em-
battled government f orces 
continues, the resilience of, 
the Lon Nol forces has up-
set the pessimistic predic-
tions of observers made last ! 
'fail. It was in August that 
American bombing in sup-
port of government forces 
ended, at the demand of 
Congress.. and the C a in h o-
Ilan government army was 
hundreds of millions. 
Few legislators have called for a cessation of military 
aid ta Saigon. Editorial writers and students seem to have 
, lost interest in Indochina. 
Former Secretary of Defense Clark M. Clifford Is one of ? 
the few prominent exceptions. He continues to preach that 
the only way to end the on-going war is to dump President 
Nguyen Van Thieu, and that the way to do that is to stop 
supplying the military forces that sustain him. In this way, 
Mr. Clifford has said, a neutralist government would emerge', 
in Saigon which would negotiate a settlement with the-
. 
Vietcong. 
The Administration says that stopping military aid would 
lead to a takeover in the south by the,Vietcong and Hanoi, 
'depriving the people of South Vietnam the free choice over 1: 
which the War was foupla in the first place. 
left to fend entirely by it-
self in combat. 
-However, without Ameri-
can-provided rice and .an 
ever-increasing supply of 
ammunition and replac e-
-ment weapons for govern-
ment forces, Lon Nol's de-
fense of this capital city and 
most of the provincial towns 
would soon collapse. 
Despite congiessional re-
strictions on U.S. activities 
in Cambodia, the American 
diplomats, aid people and 
military men (they wear 
civilian clothes most of' the 
time) are experts in the 
manipulating arts most of 
them practiced in Vietnami 
and particularly in Laos. 
They are bending, Without 
busting, the restraints put 
upon them by legislative act, 
bureaucratic instruction and 
congressional resolution. 
With a crusader's zeal, 
and buoyed by the grit and 
somewhat improved perfor-
mance of Cambodian forces 
in the field, the Americans 
? happily operate in the "gray' 
area" of compliance with 
orders. 
A furor arose in Congress 
recently when Washington 
Post correspondent Eliza-
beth Becker identified by 
name an American officer 
who she said was advising a 
Cambodian unit?a violation 
of congressional declaration.

military attaches in Cam-

job?checking the distribu-
, Hon of U.S. military equip-
ment to government forces 
and seeing how the war is 
going. The difference be-
tween that and "advising" is 
zero. 
It is remarkable that 
there haven't been any offi-
cial Americans killed in the 
field recently. One of these 
days, there could be. Those

Is the congressional cell-, 
ing on U.S. official presence 
in Cambodia really being 
limited to 200 persons? The 
computers say it is. 
From lessons learned in 
Laos, the U.S. establishment 
here knows how to do with-
out Americans. They used 
foreigners such as-Filipinos, 
, Koreans and Thais in some-
slots. The foreigners are 
paid well and also are usual-
ly veterans of Laos and ' 
, Vietnam. The only limit on 
' their number is that the 
, influx makes the Cambod-

"job-stealers" from other 
, parts of Asia. 
With Cambodian refugees 
now ntimbering over 200,000, 
the U.S. aid mission has? 
taken over much of the 
? responsibility and virtually 
,  
all of the funding for their 
relief: But except for Jack 
Williamson from Laos and a 
small staff, the care-and-
feeding has been allocated to 
a half-dozen private relief . 
organizations. In that way, 
. the Americans keep under 
the congressional ceiling. 
Another involvement that 
bends, but does not 'break,', 
restrictions is the use of 
"day-time temporary-assign-

all the money pouring in, 
there are still seething prob-

for a mid-April shift in U.S. 
Cuban policy, with assists 
from the Mexican foreign

secret use of the U.S. Air

The -White House Is expect-

returned to the Soviet capital. 
While in Havana, the Soviet 
,.leader delivered a stern.warn-
with Cuba 
Ing to Castro that his days of 
exporting revolution" must 
be ended. 
That was interpreted by Cu-
ban analysts here as a clear 
prodding to Castro to get on 
with the process of normaliz-
ing ties with the United 
States. The Soviet "gentle , 
shove," as one official here 
called it, may in fact have 
pursuaded Castro to make the 1 
next move. - 
In response to numerous ad-
ministration proddings, Cuba 
floated what appeared to be a 
trial balloon earlier this year 
when Havana's ambassador 
to Mexico implied only the 
embargo prevented the start 
of U.S.-Cuban negotiations. 
"We are not in a holy war 
with the United States," Am-
bassador Fernando L. Lopez 
Muino said. "We would be 
willing to talk to the United 
States, given a single and ir-
revocable condition?that . it 
end the blockade of Cuba." 
It was shortly after this ap-
parent 'Cuban "feeler" that 
Kissinger met for, four hours 
with Rabasa, the Mexican go-
between. In 1964 Mexico was 
the only OAS member to re-
sist U.S. pressure to break re-
lations with Castro's Socialist 
government. 
"The ingredients are most 
intriguing," a high State De-
partment official said when 
asked about the meaning of 
these developments. He dis-
closed only that the auto deal 
had gone to the White House, 
where- Nixon reportedly will 
make the final decision. 
"The atmosphere has been 
created to force a decision," 
the official said. "The Latins

Like the China model, more 
trade would be seen as a step 
toward enventual diplomatic

Cuba was proclaimed by 
President John F. Kennedy on 
Feb. 3, 1962, "in light of the. . 
subversive" activities "pub-
licly proclaimed" by the 
"Sino-Soviet government of 
Cuba." 
Under the Trading-with-
the-Enemy Act, the embargo 
applies to foreign subsidiaries 
of U.S. corporations as well as 
to the parent companies. 
American directors of those

udicial Branch in Retreat 
'fle judicial branch ? from 
theOupreme Court down ? has 
steadily retreated before the 
growing executive power of 
the Government - to a point 
where civilian courts have vir-
tually declared themselves in-
competent to deal with the 
cases of thousands of people 
who have been placed under 
detention for political reasons. 
The military courts, which 
have tried hundreds of civilians 
In closed sessions in recent 
months, appear frequently to 
be violating the rules set forth 
In the military code of justice, 
according to lawyers familiar 
with some ? of these cases. 
It is generally acknowledged, 
however, that deterioration in 
the Chilean court system began 
during the Allende years. Al-
though the country has had one 
of the strongest legal tradi-
tions in Latin America, the 
courts were drawn into the 
political polarization between 
Marxists and anti-Marxists that 
was evident throughout Chilean 
1 Society during Dr. Allende's 
Presidency. 
Judges ordered workers to 
evacuate illegally seized fac-
tories and peasants to return 
Illegally occupied land. But al-
most invariably the Interior 
Ministry refused to authorize 
the police ?force to carry out 
the orders. 
During the final months of 
the leftist Government, Dr. Al-
lende and the Supreme Court 
exchanged acrimonious public 
letters and Government offi-
cials and supporters dismissed 
the court system as reaction-
ary. 
Only weeks before, the coup, 
the President of the Supreme 
,Court, Enrique Urrutia Man-
zano, a crusty, conservative 
septuagenarian, virtually legiti-
mized a future military uprising 
by. expounding the thesis that 
the Allende Government, though 
legally elected, had "lost it 
legality by acting on the margin 
, of the law." 
A few days after the coup 
Justice Urrutia welcomed the 
junta members to the Supreme 
Court chambers and declared 
"This Supreme Court, which 
I have the honor of presiding 
over, receives your visit with 
satisfaction and optimism, and 
appreciates its historical and 
judicial value." 
President Augusto Pinochet 
Ugarte responded by reassert-
ing the junta's intention to pre-
serve the autonomy of the judi-
cial branch?in marked con-
trast to its dissolution of Con-
gress and its disbandment of 
political parties. 
"Dr. Urrutia and the Supreme 
Court ?have set the tone for 
relations between the judicial 
branch and the junta," a Court 
of Appeals Judge said. "There 
,has been an unstated desire 
throughout the court system to 
itry not to clash with the execu-
tive power." 
As recently as a month ago, 
Justice Urrutia asserted that 
human rights were "fully re-
spected in our country," He 
has made similar statements in 
trips abroad to defend the 
junta. 
The Supreme Court has also 
presided over the dismissal of 
at least 15 lower court judges 
appointed during the Allende 
years. Although this number is 
a small 'fraction of the court 
system, a few judges have' as? 
-
serted that the message has 
not gone unheeded among their 
colleagues. 
Most important a number of 
landmark decisions by the, Su-
preme Court have effectively 
handcuffed lower courts in 
dealing with the human rights 
of political prisoners. 
Perhaps the most significant 
decision came last month in a 
case involving. a , 15-year-old 
boy who was arrested and has 
been detained incommunicado 
without formal charges since 
Dec. 19. 
s A Court of Appeals had ap-
proved a motion of habeas 
corpus, ordering the Interior 
Ministry to make known the 
charges against the boy, or 
release him. 
In an appeal to the Supreme 
Court, the Interior Minister, 
Gen. Oscar Bonilla Bradanovic, 
acknowledged that no formal 
charges existed against the boy 
but alleged that he had been 
a member of the Communist 
party since the age of 11 and 
that he was being held "as a 
preventive measure" in "de-
fense of the state." 
The Supreme Court upheld 
the Interior Minister and ruled 
that under the state of siege 
declared by the junta the au-
thorities had the right to detain 
minors for whatever reason and 
for as long they deemed 
necessary. 
The Supreme Court went 
even further in declaring that 
"the motives for the decree of 
arrest are the executive con-
cern of the authorities." 
According' to Judge Ruben 
Galesio of Santiago's Court of 
Appeals, the civilian courts can 
now legally exercise control 
over the executive power only 
by demanding that arrests be 
made on the basis of decrees 
issues by the Minister of Inter-
ior, and by ascertaining that 
detained pesons.are brought be-
fore a military court within 48 
hours, as required by law un-
der the state of siege. 
.Violatimis Acknowledged 
Yet he acknowledged that in 
practice "many areests" were 
made without any sort of de-
cree, or that decrees were 
signed days after a person had 
been detained. Further, he note 
that the authorities rarely 
brought detainees before a 
court within 48 hours. 
"Often we cannot even find 
out who made the arrest and 
where a person is beingheld," 
he said. 
He added that hundreds of 
motions for habeas corpus had 
been ignored by the aiitorities 
and the courts, including a mo-
tion filed in his court last 
mqnth by leading represen-
tatives of the Roman Catholic 
and Protestant churches and 
the Jewish community on behal 
of 131 persons woo were ar-
rested during the months since 
the coup and have not been 
heard from. 
The pervasive feeling of help-
lessness in the face of the au-
thoritarian junta has led law-
yers and judges to justify their 
conduct on the grounds of the 
"lesser evil." 
' Thus thousands of 'workers 
have illegally been dismissed 
'from their jobs for poltical rea-
'sons or unproved charges of 
"extremism," while the labor 
courts accept new decrees by 
the junta arbitrarily expanding 
the grounds for dismissal of 
laborers. 
In the universities, where 
thousands of students and hun-
dreds of professors were sus-
pended under an anti-Marxist 
purge after the coup, law pro-
fessors served as "prosecu-
tors," receiving written or oral 
denunciations of reported ex-
tremists. Tht accused were not 
allowed to face their accusers. 
"If I don't do this, somebody 
worse will," said a professor of 
constitutional law, explaning hi 
decision to act as a prosecetor 
in a science department of the 
University of Chile. "The way 
I see it, it is a choice between 
throwing out some innocent 
Marxists and throwing them all 
out." 
INow that the meting out of 
justice has shifted to the mili-
tary courts, the same feeling 
of acquiescence is evident 
among civilian defense attor-
neys. 
? Lawyers have noted that 
even under the state of siege, 
the Constitution does not per-
mit a military court to try in-
dividuals for alleged crimes 
!committed before the state of 
Isiege was put into effect.
