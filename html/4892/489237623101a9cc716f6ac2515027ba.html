  STATINTL 
Helms, the Shah and the CIA 
THERE IS A CERTAIN irony in the 
fact that Richard Helms will go to Iran 
-as the American ambassador 20 years 
after the agency he now heads organ-
ized and directed the overthrow of the 
regime then in power in Teheran. The 
tale is worth recounting if only be-
cause of the changes in two decades 
which have affected the Central Intel-
ligence Agency as well as American 
foreign policy. 
Helms first went to work at the CIA 
in. 1947 and he came up to his present 
post as director through what is gener-
ally called the "department of dirty 
tricks." However, there is nothing on 
the public record to show that he per-
sonally had a hand in the overthrow of 
the Communist backed and/or mi-
ented regime of Premier Mohammed 
Mossadegh in 1933, an action that re. 
turned the Shah to his throne. 'ne can 
only guess at the wry smile that must 
have come to the Shah's face \ Men he 
first heard that President Ni:-on was 
proposing to send the CIA's top man 
to be the American envoy, 
The Iranian affair, and a similar 
CIA action in Guatemala the following 
year, are looked upon by old hands at

ed States Point Four office with

the agency as high points of a sort in 
the Cold War years. David Wise and 
Thomas 13. Ross have told the Iranian 
ilstory in their hook, "The Invisible Gov-
v ernment," and the CIA boss at the 
time, Allen Dulles, conceded in public ?

re?jrni, under the Shah's command 
and the country was thrown into crisis. 
Mossadegh "connived," as Wise and 
Ross put it, with Turich, Iran's Com-
munist party, to holster his hand. The 
British and Americans decided he had 
to go and picked Gen. Fazollah Zahedi 
to renlace him. The man who stage-
managed the job on the spot was Ker-
mit "Kim" Roosevelt (who also had a 
hand in some fancy goings-on in 
Egypt), grandson of T.R. and seventh 
cousin of P.D.R., and now a Washing-
tonian in private business. 
Roosevelt managed to get to Teheran 
and set up underground headquarters. 
A chief aide was Brig. Gen. H. Norman 
Schwarzkopf, who, as head of the New 
Jersey state police, had become famous 
during the Lindbergh baby kidnaping 
case. Schwarzkopf had reorganized the 
Shah's police force and he and Roose-
velt joined in the 1953 operation. The 
Shah dismissed Mossadegh and named 
Zaheldi as Premier but Mossadegh ar-
rested the officer who braught the had 
news. The Teheran streets filled with 
rioters and a scared Shah fled first to 
Baghdad and then to Rome. Dulles 
flew to Rome to confer with him. Roo. 
sevelt ordered the Shah's backers- into 
the streets, the leftists were arrested 
by the army and the Shah returned in 
triumph. Mossadech went to jail. In 
time a new international oil consor-
tium took over Anglo-Iranian which 
operates to this day,though the Shah 
has squeezed more and more revenue 
from the Westerners. - ? 
In his 1993 book, ''The Craft of Intel-
ligence," published after he left CIA, 
Dulles wrote that, when in both Iran 
and Guatemala it -became clear" that 
a. Communist state was in the making, 
"support from outside was given to 
loyal anti-Communist elements." In a 
1965 NBC television documentary on 
"The Science of Spying" Dulles said: 
"The government of Mossadegh, if you 
recall history, was overthrown by the 
action of the Shah. Now, that we en-
couraged the Shah to take that action 
I will not deny." Miles Copeland, an 
ex-CIA operative in the Middle East. 
wrote in his hook, '"The Caine of 
Nations." that the Iranian derring-do 
was called "Operation Ajax.'' Ile cred-
ited Roosevelt with 'almost single-
'fixity, there were plenty of ot ter suc-
cessful enterprises that fell short of 
changing government regimes. Today 
the CIA. humiliated by the 1961 Bay of 
Pigs fiasco it planned and ran, has 
wi:hdrawn front such large scale af-
fairs as Iran, save for its continuing 
major role in the no longer ''secret 
\car in Laos." The climate of today 
-would not permit the United States to 
'repeat the Iranian operation, or so one 
a slimes with the reservation that 
IdresidentNixon -(who was Vice Presi-
clent at the time of Iran) loves sur-
prises. 
The climate of 1953, however, was 
very different and must he taken into 
account in any judgment. Moscow 
then was fishing in a great many 
troubled waters and among them was 
Iran. It was probably true, as Allen 
Dulles said on that 1965 TV show, that 
"at no time has the CIA engaged in 
any political activity or any intelli-
gence that was not approved at the 
highest level." It was all part of a 
deadly "game of nations." Richard Bis-
sell, who ran the U-2 program and the " 
Bay of Pigs, was asked on that TV 
show about the morality of CIA activi-
ties. "I think," he replied, that "the 
morality of . . . shall we call it for 
short, cold war .. . is So infinitely eas-
ier than the morality of almost any 
kind of hot war that I never encoun-
tered this as a serious problem." 
PERHAPS the philosophy of the 
Cald War years and the CIA role were 
best put by Dulles in a letter that he 
wrote me in 1961. Excerpts from his 
then -forthcoming book had appeared 
?i/ri Harper's and I had suggested to him 
some further revelations he might in-
clude in the book. He wrote about ad-
ditions he was making: -This includes 
more on Iran and Guatemala and the 
problems of policy in action when 
there begins to be evidence that a 
country is slipping and Communist 
take-over is threatened. We can't wait 
for an engraved invitation to come and 
give aid." 
There is a story, too, that Winston 
Churchill was so pleased by the opera-
tion in Iran that he proferred the 
George Cross to Kim Roosevelt. But 
the CIA wouldn't let him accept the 
decoration. So Churchill commented to 
Roosevelt: "I would he proud to have 
served under you" in such an opera-
tion. That remark, Roosevelt is said to

TO LL,Pi 
EDITOR. 
Rasters of the U-2 
In The Post of Nov. 30 there is an ar-
ticle by your Bernard Nossiter, under 
an Oslo dateline, about the Russian 
submarine excursion into the Norwe-
gian fjord. On page A10, column 7, 
there is this paragraph: 
"If an exercise had been scheduled 
for November in the Sognefjord, the 
explanation runs, the Soviet military 
would have been insensitive to the po-
litical authorities, In this view, the s(s.. 
vict military was not trying to sabo-
tage Ifelsinid, any more than the Pen-
tagon masters of the U-2 were out to 
undermine the summit 12 years ago. 
The Soviet military machine, it is sug-
gested, may have simply been pursu-
ing business as usual." 
Mr. Nossiter has his facts wrong. 
'Perhaps he should consult your re-
cently retired Chalmers M. Roberts, 
who could tell him the Pentagon held 
110 "masters of the U-2." In his book, 
"The Nuclear Years" (Praeger, 1970) 
Mr. Roberts discusses the matter, 
starting on page 43. lie makes it clear 
the U-2 flights were ordered by Presi-
dent Eisenhower and were directed by 
the Central Intelligence Agency. They 
also were carried out by a contract? 
(Lockheed) who was paid by CIA. 
Another authority who might per. 
suade Mr. Nossiter is Arthur M. Schle 
singer Jr. In "A Thousand Days" 
(Houghton Mifflin, 1965). Mr. Schlet 
singer writes on page 241 of how Rich. 
ard Bissell, CIA's deputy director for 
operations, "conceived and fought 
through the plan of U-2 flights over 
the Soviet Union." 
Clearly, Mr. Nossiter's commentls 
-
not based on fact. The Defense Deport.;:. 
ment used some of the information ob. STATINTL 
toined by the U-2 and Defense Seem. 
Uzi's, Thomas Gates said so. But to de 
clam, as Mr. Nossiter did, that 
"Pentagon masters of the U-2" insti. 
gated or carried out the flights is in. 
correct.

Although Eisenhower is 
'justly famous for having 
said that we must hold onto 
Indochina because of its raw 
materials, he should be 
equally famous for the 
much more sophisticated no-
tion, emphatically ascribed 
to him in this hook, of want-
ing to assure the freedon of 
American corporations to 
export capital abroad, to 
buy as much of the world as 
possible, as a basic exten-
sion of U.S. foreign policy 
and cold-war strategy. Frus-
trated by the failure to 
'elect Wendell Wilkie to 
head the expansion of Amer-
ican corporate enterprise 
into the ownership of One 
World, the great financiers 
and industrialists who sup-
ported Eisenhower (while 
middling entrpreneurs and 
old-time conservatives de-
nounced him) may have 
thought him quite necessary 
to safeguard the expansion-
ism which has now flowered, 
under three other presi-
dents, into the age of the 
multi-national corporation. 
This brings up that most - 
perplexing of all Eisen-
hower riddles: Eisenhower's 
farewell speech in which he 
warned against the CXCeSP?CS 
of a military-industrial com-
plex which he saw as threat-
ening to become the domi-
nant force in American poli-
ey-making. 
Why was the man who ? 
was prepared to oust gov-
ernments, dispatch Marines, 
talk of massive retaliation, 
overfly the U.S.S.R., and an- ? 
grily rebut anyone tried to ? 
tell him, how to run an 
Army?why was such a man 
so concerned at the end 
about the military he had 
faithfully served and the in-
dustry he had painstakingly 
supported? Parmet isn't 
even curious.. 
Again the clues, if not the 
conclusions, are scattered 
throughout this storehouse 
collection of facts. One is 
the context of the speech. Ei-
senhower spelled out the 
menace to be that of a "sci-
entific-technological elite" 
and not just the MTC ab-
stractly. To him, real busi-
ness meant the big banks, 
the big owners, the vastly 
rich folks whom he enjoyed 
so much as personal friends.

First, there is Eisenhower

Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon, Ei-

? apoplectically and apoca-
lyptically. Eisenhower's New

Parmet meticulously re-
counts?without seeming to 
be impressed?Eisenhower's 
rhetoric! about the New 
Look was seriously compro-
mised by the old look of 
some of his. crucial actions: 
when he landed Marines in 
Lebanon, for instance. 
Also, when Eisenhower 
supported the covert U.S. 
operation that overthrew 
the Guatemalan govern-
ment, he was well into a 
world of old-fashioned, even 
if newly-equipped, coup and 
counter - coup, terror and 
covert warfare. That, as a 
matter of fact, is just the 
. way Eisenhower wanted to 
fight the war in Indochina 
--secretly and discreetly. 
But he did want to fight it. 
On that he was as dedicated 
a hawk as Kennedy, John-
son or Nixon. (If there was a 
difference in style it would 
probably be mostly in con-
trast to Johnson. Eisen-
hower was dead set against 
a big land involvement. The 
Nixon . policy of -ordering 
bombing while talking peace 
probably would have ap-
pealed to him more, and the 
early Kennedy policy of se-
cret raids most o; all?ex-
cept that Eisenhower always 
seemed skeptical of how 
well such secrets could he 
kept. Iris explicit skepticism 
about the U-2 overflights 
was, of course, brilliantly 
justified.) 
Beyond his fervent anti-
communism. there is an-
other aspect to Eisen-
bower that might mark a 
very special (and necessary) 
place for him in our coun-
try's development: his total 
visceral and intellectual 
commitment to the recti-
tude of American corporate 
enterprise?as he under-
stood it from his closest

that the expansion of capi-
talist enterprise around the 
aim, ea-aim on iiastao, 
frOubled bythe fantastic 
support given, say, the bank-
ing system by federal policy. 
But he was troubled by 
the thought that the new, 
scientifically-based weapons 
companies would muscle 
their way into policy-influ-
encing positions. Also, he 
seems to have been disturbed 
by the possibilities of a garri-
son state, totally dominated 
by a defense budget. He was 
never disturbed by the com-
pany-store domination of the 
lives of most ordinary Amer-
icans by the financial elite 
which already does own con-
trol of most the capital and 
industry, as well as control 
of those who make policy. 
Maybe that just seemed tra-
ditional to the General-Pres-
ident. 
At any rate, deep concern 
along these lines may he 
merely academic after all.. 
Thanks to Eisenhower's 
foremost bequest to a grate-
ful nation, Richard Nixon, it 
looks like we are going to 
have both a garrison state 
and a company store any-
way.

For seven (lays in Octo- tekivision appearance that 
".\londay night. Oct. 22. For 
her a frightened world 
the President and Ii is ad vi-
contemplated a specter of sers it had been a much 
nuclear cataclysm. 
The week of high ten-
sion began Monday, Oct. 
22, just 10 Years ago, when 
the youthful President of 
the United States an-
?nounced to a startled na-
tion a direct challenge to 
the Soviet Union in a 
blockage of Soviet vessels. 
? That was the Cuban 
'missile crisis. It is likely to 
be credited by future his-
torians with having ap-
plied , the severe shock 
treatment that jolted the 
two superpowers into a 
.new era and eventually 
produced radically differ-
cot relations between Mos-
tow and .Washington. 
Source of Shock 
Ten years ago the two 
glared at one another 
through nuclear gu n-
sights. Today, in the wake 
of a visit to Moscow by the 
President of the 'United 
States, the Russians are 
buying huge quantities of 
. Amerian grain and eager-
ly inviting U.S. technolog-
ical know-how to help ex-
ploit their resources. The 
, Americans seek return 
benefits from. these con-
tacts. 
And what about the 
- source of the shock treat-
ment.? Kiel Castro's Culla 
no loner is producing cri-
sis headlines, In fact, it 
seems to some students of 
Soviet affairs that the 
Paissians would be grati-
fied if they could find a. 
convenient way of shear-
.g away Fidel's power. 
It was a close thing, 10' 
blockade 
t'ears ago. As President Cuba and chal-
John F. Kennedy himaeif lenge Soviet shires bring-
longer siege. 
Calls For Photos 
Actually, it bad begun 
for the White llou:ze and 
official Washington early 
h September with U.S. in-
telligence reports of sesni-
clous- looking emplace-
ments in Communist-ruled 
Cuba, The President or-
dered photographs of the 
entire island and high-
flying U-2 planes carried 
out the mission. 
What they brought back 
was evidence that some 
sort of military buildup 
was going on. Put not un-
til early October was there 
hard evidence of interme-
diate-range missile bases 
on a hostile island so Close 
to U.S. shores. By Oct. 15, 
analysis confirmed Wash-
ington's worst suspicions, 
and in an atmosphere of 
crisis the President met 
with his chief defense, se-
curity and intelligence ad-
visers to discuss what to 
do about it. 
Should the United States 
it back and wait? That 
would suggest U.S. weak-
ness and irresolution in 
the face of a threat. It. 
would strengthen Premier 
Nikita S. Khrushchev's 
position. 
Should the United States 
bomb the bases? That 
could be bad. too, because 
of the world outcry it 
could cause on moral 
grounds. A. n d Russians 
might be killed. 
Retaliation Feared 
Should the United States 
him the only Soviet milita-
ry aid to Cuba was of a de-
fensive nature. The Pres-
ident now knew better. 
Two days later, having 
agreed with his advisers 
that a blockade should be 
the response, he ordered 
preparations to go for-
ward. He prepared to 
make the announcement 
at 7 p.m. Monday, Oct. 22. 
America's allies around 
the world were filled in. 
The Organization of Amer-
ican States would be call-
ed into session. A letter 
WOlilti be drafted for 
Khrushchey. 
One hour before Mr. 
Kennedy was to go on tele-
vision, Secretary of State 
Dean Rusk summoned the 
Soviet ambassador, Anato-
ly F. Dobrynin. The am-
bassador was his usual ex-
pansive, smiling self on ar-
rival. When he left the 
secretary 25 minutes later 
he was pale and shaken. 
The President went on 
the air. He told Americans 
of a "secret, swift and 
extraordinary buildup? of 
Soviet missiles in Cuba, 
called it a deliberate and 
unacceptable provocation 
and revealed his orders for 
a quarantine of all offen-
sive weapons for Castro.?

pies in sky keep two 
:big powers in balance 
By DONALD R. MORRIS 
Post News Analyst 
, 
All that has 'kept the world from sell-
destructing this last quarter. of a century 
has been the precarious nuclear balance 
between the United Stales and the Soviet 
?Union. ? 
For a few short years America had an 
overwhelming preponderance of power. 
We were certain we would never resort to 
it, but our mere possession of such night-
marish power drove the Russians to dis-
traction. Then they in their turn achieved 
-an edge--and regained a measure of sta.-
bility?and it was our turn to ? taste the 
?fear in the phrase "missile gap." 
A decade ago the balance was regained 
and has since been maintained. The num-
ber of missiles, their megatonnage and 
their guidance systems are largely irrele-
vant; what counts is that neither power 
can launch a preemptive strike with any 
hope of survival, and on this balance 
hangs the peace of the world. 
'Tiger by the tail 
; The balance, however, is far from stat-
ic. Both powers hold a fearsome tiger by 
the tail. Research and development must 
continue lest one side or the other 
achieve a breakthrough in delivery or de-
fense, which might destroy the balance. 
The expense of such a break-
through?indeed the expense of maintain-
ing the current balance?is so hideous 
that both powers would like to avoid it. 
, They are committed to a continuing 
arms race not by the need to achieve a 
breakthrough but only by the imperative 
of not permitting the other to da so. 
Both sides recognize the need for a mu-
tual effort to scale down their arsenals. 
In the past, negotiations over dis-
armament foundered on a single ele-
ment?trust. The issues at stake were so 
overriding that neither the U.S. nor the 
-Soviet -Union could afford to accept the 
other's word that an agreement would be 
adhered to. 
? The recent SALT talks, however, have 
achieved initial and encouraging suc-
cesses, and the key to the progress can 
? be found in an innocuous euphemism the 
treaties employ: "National technical 
.means of verification". The phrase refers 
to a program which supplies an accept-
able substitute for the missing ingredient 
of trust, and on that program rests all 
STATI NTL 
referred to as SAMOS (for "satellit: organization won't:get-apt! past -the fronF 
and missile-observation system"); the 
Soviet satellites are referred to as 
COSMOS, and while neither country will 
discuss their .details, they do, as the re- . 
sult of a 1962 agreement, report each 
launch and its ot?bital characteristic to 
the UN. 
The programs give both countries a 
positive check on the nuclear activities 
of the other. Neither nation can test or 
deploy a major new weapons system 
without timely?and highly detailed?
warning accruing to the other. 
The United States launches four or five 
"search-and-find" SAMOS missiles an-
nually from Vandenburg Air Force Base 
in California. They remain in orbit about 
a month, covering the entire surface of 
the globe twice a day, once at night 
(when infi?a-red photography, sensitive to 
heat emissions, gives almost as much in-
formation as daytime passes) and once 
during the day. 
The photographic results are radioed 
back, and despite the loss in resolution, 
construction work of any description is at 
once apparent when photos taken a few 
days apart are superimposed. 
Each search-and-find satellite is follow-
ed a month or two later by a "close-look" 
satellite, which photographs the specific 
areas of interest its predecessor has 
spotted. These photographs are not 
transmitted electronically. Instead the 
satellite ejects the film capsule itself, 
which is recovered in mid-air by special-
ly equipped planes based in Hawaii. 
- ? 
door) a; 
The first generation of satellite cam-
eras a decade ago were lucky to pick up 
objects six feet across. The third gener-
ation in current use will pick up objects 
less than two feet across, and the resolua, 
tion may ?some day be measured in 
inches. In terms of analysis, this means 
that not only can new missile Sites, or 
changes in old ones, be recorded, but the 
precise technical construction of the mis-
sile can be reconstructed in fair detail as 
well. . . 
The Soviets launch perhaps four times 
as many satellites as America does, par-
tially because theirs do not last as long, 
and also because the Soviets are given to 
"tactical" missions ? sending a satellite 
for a special "look-see" when something 
of interest is going on. 
The U.S. prefers to wait for its regu-
larly scheduled shots, and has sent only 
one tactical satellite aloft ? to check Is-
raeli claims that the Soviets were violat-
ing the truce by installing missile sites 
on the banks of the Sues Canal. Soviet 
photography is good enough to allay 
their fears that the U.S. is installing new 
weapons systems, although the resolu-
tion of their cameras is not nearly as 
good as ours. . 
. High-altitude coverage of the Soviet 
Union started in the early 1950s when bal-
loon - mounted cameras were launched. 
in Europe to drift across Eurasia before 
beim, recovered in the Pacific. .? 
? . From such crude beginnings we ad-
vanced to the U-2 aircraft, which worked 
like a charm until the Soviets finally de-
veloped a missile that could bring it down 
? with disastrous results for American 
idiplomacy. President Eisenhower had ap-
proved the U-2 program only after Pre-
mier Nikita Khrushchcv had rejected his 
. suggestion of "open skies" inspections. 
The gap between the U-2 flights and the 
inception of the SAMOS program was for-
tunately a short one. 
What photos show 
The pictures are analyzed at the Na-
tional Photographic Interpretation Center 
(known as "En-pick" to the intelligence 
community), a little-known joint project 
located in Washington under the aegis of. 
the Central Intelligence Agency. 
The sophisticated interpretation of 
these photographs provides the vast bulk 
of what America knows about the Soviet 
Union, the Eastern bloc countries and the 
People's Republic of China. 
The photos reveal not only major con-
struction ? from transportation nets 
through shipyard activity to all manner 
of missile facilities ? but an astonishing 
wealth of technical detail as well. 
While the U.S. will not talk about the 
SAMOS program any more than the So-
viet Union will discuss the details of 
COSMOS.. the general details of both 
programs are more or less open secrets.

dence that similar ideas form the back-
bone of Leonid I. Brezhnev's policy 
,toward the -United States. ' 
Certainly Mr. Brezhnev has made-
settle impressive moves recently to 
demonstrate his commitment to better 
relations with the United States. He.  
reaived President Nixon here last 
May despite the political difficulties

ways of improving Moscow's image 
in the United .States. The ,goal of the 
effort was expressed the other ? day 
by a Soviet editor, who said, "We don't 
'want you Americans to think of ?us 
as barbarians." That some lessons have 
been learned was evident recently 
when a Soviet court gave Gavriel 
Shapiro, who married an American 
girl in a Jewish religious ceremony, 
an astonishingly lenient sentence on a 
'charge of draft dodging. 
Evert that old bugaboo, the unavail-
ability of matzos to religious Soviet 
Jews for Passover, has been taken care 
of to some extent. On a recent Satur-
day morning a group of Americans 
from the Peterson mission visiting 
Kiev asked to see the synagogue in 
:that city. They were taken there 
promptly and found a congregation of 
over 200 elderly Soviet Jews engaged

various Soviet scientists who fell into 
disfavor after, they asked permission! 
to emigrate to Israel. ? 
There is no mystery about the two 
chief reasons for the main thrust of the: 
Brezhnev line. which is so reminiscent' 
of the drive Nikita S. Khrushchey 
mounted for a similar rapprochement 
during the?Lisenhower Administration 
at the end of the nineteen-fifties. So-
viet sources here freely admit that Mr. 
Khruslachey made a major blunder by 
blowing 'up over .the 1.172 incident in 
May, 1990, and they seem rather praud 
that Mr. Brezhnev made no similar 
error Over the mining of. North Viet-
nam's ports. "We are trying to repair 
the thread that was snapped by Gary 
Powers," one Soviet editor said. 
Very little is said here about the 
Chinese, but the fear and worry over 
future relations -with , Peking is un-
mistakable. Soviet officials know from 
their own life experiences that a large 
country can go from weakness to 
power in one or, two generations. 
But it is economies- that is the main 
motive. Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev 
are now far richer than they were 
'when this correspondent first visited' 
them in 1935. Food of all kinds seems 
abundant, with the strange exception 
of lemons. Most people seem well-
dressed, and mini-skirts and pants 
suits are all the rage among the more 
elegant women here this summer. , 
There are now traffic jams in Moscow, 
a phenomenon that was unthinkable 
three ot four years ago. 
But Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev 
are the main tourist cities. -Except for 
them and a few others, living condi-
tions?though better than earlier?are 
still hard. One need only look at the 
- bedraggled dress of the peasant women 
in the street to sense the gulf between 
? the urban living standards and the 
conditions in the countryside. 
It is for massive American economic 
' and technical aid, above all; that Mos-
cow now wants to improve relations 
with Washington. Despite the emphasis 
in the Soviet press on U.S. unem-
ployment and the poverty of Negroes 
and,Mexican Americans, even sophisti- ? 
cated and well-infortried Soviet sources - 
? speak of -America as though it were a 
will be able to reduce their arms 
budget and end the, futile and ex-
tremely expensive strategic weapons 
race. Only on that hypothesis does the 
Soviet hope for major American in-
vestment make sense, since the 
Russians are realists accustomed to 
calculate. Secretary of Commerce 
Peterson has said Vietnam was never 
mentioned in his economic negotia-
tions here, but it must have been very 
much in his own mind and in the 
mind of Mr.. Brezhnev when the two 
men met. It would seem a reasonable 
bet that when' Henry Kissinger flies 
to Paris these days to negotiate with 
North Vietnam's i.e Due Tho, he has 
Mr. Brezhnev's best wishes and per-

'say the experts, is not so.) The article tells how man

they operate; what they have discovered, things calcu-
lated to win friends and influence enemies all over the

It was written by 'Perry Fellwock, 26, of San Diego, 
.California, a war protester. At twenty, he enlisted in the

The August issue of Ramparts i?-naga-
zinc ? a periodical much. given to at-
tacks on the intelligence community ? 
features an article entitled "U.S. Espion-
age: A Memoir," attributed to "Winslow 
Peck," i? 
The article claims that the N.!ationaI 
Security Agency (NSA) has broken ev-
ery Soviet cede, and can pinpoint; the lo-
cation and type of each Soviet jet and 
Missile submarine. It also claims the 
United States is still making routine 
U-2-type surveillance flights over: the So-
viet Union and China. 
For lagniappe, the author describes 
how in 1957 the NSA monitorqd a live 
TV contact between Soviet - Premier 
Alexei Kosygin and Cosmonaut Viadi-
mir ?Komarov, who had just ,been in-
formed his braking chutes were mal-
functioning and who was facing certain 
death. 
"Peck" also claims that the .electronic 
surveillance ship Liberty, on: which 74 ? 
crewmen died in an Israeli altack dur-
ing the Six-Day War in 1057, overheard 
Gen, Moshe Dayan order his troops on 
to Cairo and Damascus, as a result of 
which then President Lyndon B. Johnson 
brought intense pressure on. Isi'ael to 
halt further troop movements, and on 
Premier Kosygin to call off a :threatened 
Soviet airborne operation .agaiust Israel. 
"Peck" turns out to be one Perry Fel-
lwock, who enlisted in the Ail. Force in 
1966 at the age of 20, was assigned to 
NSA for duty, served in NSA. stations in 
Turkey and Indochina, an& was dis-
charged in November, 1969 ? age 23, 
Ramparts claims ?? he was a "senior 
analyst" with NSA. 
Fellwock claims he then turned down 
a $10,000-a-year job with the. CIA, be-
cause he wanted to "work to end the 
Vietnam war." In April, 1.9'12, he was 
arrested and fined $50 for disturbing the 
peace in San Diego before the 
can party headquarters and the nth 
Naval District headquarters._ 
, In an interview with the New York 
Times, Feliwock said, "1 know the FBI 
knows who I am. I'd like to avoid pub-
licity but I'm willing to go through 
and if I haye to, to jail." 
Fellwock and the Ramparts editorial 
board can sleep quietly. Neither the FBI 
nor anyone 'else is. liable tot bother him.

NSA's "no comment" to the story does 
not conceal official agitation but only 
? yawning boredom. 
To begin with, while 1\15;k does employ 
multitudes of Air Force enlisted men in 
a variety of clerical and technical ca-
pacities, it does not use such youthful 
detailees ?Vith high school -educations 'as 
"analysts," senior or. othemise. 
Ramparts could have acquired a far 
more detailed, and accurate account of 
the structure and activities of NSA from 
an overtly published book, David Kahn's 
superb "The Codebreakets," than they 
got from their ego-tripping source. His 
corridor gossip is flattet,'ing, but ludi-
crously inaccurate. 
Items: NSA is the seat of the major 
cryptanalytic effort of the. U.S. govern-
ment. It regularly reads ti-tat portions of 
the traffic Of foreign nations NV11 tC11 is 
sent in a wide variety of low-level crypto

tection for a short period of time. It 
does not, alas, read the key internal 
traffic of major powers, which these 
days is sent in crypto systems using 
computer-generated keys, ?which are im-
pervious to attack. 
There have been- no U-2-type *over- ' 
flights since the early 90s, when the sat 
ellite reconnaissance programs were de-
veloped. The unmanned SAMOS capsule 
houses equipment so sophisticated that 
? the photographic and electronic take -is 
infinitely superior to that which a con-
ventional overflight could produce. (The 
United States does send planes and ships 
along Soviet and Chinese borders to sniff 
out electronic- developments and defen-
sive techniques and reaction times, but 
these do not deliberately violate foreign 
air or sea space. When it happens by 
accident, the results can be disastrous.). 
And youthful military enlisted men on

to intelligence slated for the executive.

versant with presidential actions based 
on such intelligence.. 
In. short, Ramparts ? .which has 
scored palpable hits in the past is 
attacking with .an empty ?waterpistol. 
And Fellwock, having ? secured ample 
amounts of the publicity he is so ar-
dently avoiding, can sink back into the 
obscurity from which he emerged.

A former Air Forte sergeant, who 
was discharged from the service in 1969,

? fined its electronic intelligence tech-
niques to the point where it can break 
`Soviet _codes, listen to and understand

systems and keep track of virtually 
'? ever); Soviet jet or plane or missile-
carrying submarine around the world. 
The press quickly discovered the 
identity of the analyst, who signed .his 
/ article. with .the pseudonym of Winslow 
Peck. Peck corroberated many of .his 
? revelations, but found .some experts 
strongly denying that the United States 
-, had broken the sophisticated codes of 
the ? Soviet Union or of other foreign 
powers, 
This whole matter strikes at the 
fundamental ? security of the United 
States as well as of the Soviet Union. 
In the sixties, the U-2 intelligence flights 
were known to the Soviet but Premier 
Khrushchev used it as an excuse to call 
off his summit talks with President 
Eisenhower. Government intelligence 
experts now say there has been no auth-
orized violation of ,Soviet or Chinese 
air space since. 
Peck was employed by the little . 
known National Security Agency. Head-
quartered at Fort Mead, near Baltimore, 
it has about 90,000 employees, mostly 
military. Its -annual budget is about. z1. 
billion. Primarily, it collects World in---

technology, for distribution- through the '

land or on naval vessels or aircraft. 
It is reassuring to know how wide-

But, no matter how comforting, it is 
not information to broadcast to our fes. 
Its value is in its secrecy. Its original 
revelation can only be distressing to

up new relations of co-existence leading

Spy in the Sky? 
It was just 'announced that the gov-
erriment is going to send a U-2 plane up 
bver Chesapeake Bay in the next few 
'days to map the damage caused by trop-
ical storm Agnes. 
Without wishing to seem unnecessar-
ily suspicious, we should just like to 
point out that, by the freakiest of coinci-
dences, the Soviet Embassy has recently 
:purchased a summer residence for its 
ambassador and the embassy staff at 
,Pioneer Point on the Chesapeake's East-
ern Shore. The embassy, according to 
latest reports, is in th.e process of reno-
vating the tennis courts and building a 
basketball court on the grounds of the 
waterfront estate. 
If .you remember, President Eisen-, 
hower was first impressed by the poten-
tial of the original U-2 over a decade ago 
when the spy masters showed him de-
tailed photographs of his favorite green 
at Burning Tree, snapped from 60,000 
feet up. 
If you also remember, Premier 
Khrushchev used the shooting down of 
an operational U-2 as the pretext for 
scuttling summit talks with Ike in 1960. 
We just hope every precaution will be 
taken with the flood-mapping spy plane, 
so that the new era of sweetness and 
light between the United States and the 
Soviet Union will not come crashing 
down in flames just because somebody at 
the CIA wants an aerial eloseup of the 
Russians' new basketball court..

vital tools of American policy. 
? President Nixon, directing war moves 
in Southeast Asia and peace moves with 
.Russia, has at his fingertips a major 
weapon brought to a peak of reliability

The weapon is this: a constant flow of

aeronautics and space technology. 
. In Southeast Asia, these technicians 
depend heavily on reconnaissance plahes 
and pilotless drones for the pictures they 
need. Space satellites are used for back-

Worldwide, however, the important 
business of keeping tabs on the Russian 
and Communist Chinese nuclear-missile 
build-up rests primarily with the space 
satellites. Aircraft give better pictures at 
lower cost. But, since the incident in

that brought them to Mos-
cow at 9 p.m. yesterday. 
The task of publishing the 
agreement and explaining it 
to the world was barely be-
ginning at that point, with a 
signing ceremony set for 11 
.p.m. in the Kremlin. 
. 
At 10:02 p.m. American 
newsmen traveling with the 
President were assembled in 
. the U.S. embassy for an on, 
-the-record briefing by Am-
: ger, both operating under 
heavy strain. ? 
,Smith called it "the fresh-

talked about." In fact it was 
so fresh that no one in the 
room had a copy to show to 
newsmen. That produced tu-
mult. The "landmark" treaty 
that the President and his 
associates hailed was not 
available to quote from be-
cause a frantic operation 
was under way to produce a 
formal version for the 
Kremlin signing ceremony. 
? Criticism already was 
being raised in Congress 
about the still-unseen treaty, 
especially charges that it 
gave lopsided submarine ad-

firmly denied that, and then ?

Smith: "I don't know

perfectly clear that under

This discussion then pro- -

MOSCOW MUSINGS  
Despite Soviet Rigidity, Life Relaxing 
STATINTL 
? By a Star Staff Writer 
MOSCOW ? All the poetry 
of modern Russia seemed to 
be summed up in that little 
dining room across from the 
Kremlin. 
There we sat, connoisseurs 
of past Nixon travels to Rus-
. sial reminiscing about the 1959 
visit of the then vicc president 
? which produced so much ver-
bal fireworks with Nikita S. 
Khrushchev. 
Superficially not much has 
changed in the heart of this 
metropolis. There in that Vie-
,torian-like dining room were 
the same tatty lace curtains, 
the same struggle for service, 
the same blaring music from a 
?combo still living in the 19305. 
Outside, despite Ulu intru-
sion of several new glass sky-
scraper hotels, the splendor of 
the flood-lighted .spires of the 
Kremlin remains supreme'. 
But as the evening wore on, 
the real changes in Moscow 
Shone through. It is 'uasically a 
change in mood. It is relaxa-
tion. It is an unashamed 
? search for the "good life," as 
dfigrmined in best Ameri-
can style ? by more cars, 
better, clothes, larger apart-
ments. 
This poetry of change pene-
trated the dining room. Sud-
denly, in an interval between 
blaring jazz tunes, came the 
haunting strains of the Lara 
theme from the movie Dr. Zhi-
vago. 
The movie ?and the aook by 
Boris Pasternak ? have not

Yet 'in came the Zhivago

The President's announce-

two-day holiday celebrating the 
27th Anniversary of the Arne% 
victory over Nazi Germany. The 
holiday perhaps added to the 
traditional Soviet reluctance to 
respond quickly in public to 
major new foreign policy de-

Joe says when asked that he does 
not like doves?that out of their cages 
they are dirty, mean, and hard to man-
age. 
?Joe sits under the skylight sipping a 
tisane from a huge blue and white china 
cup and the doves in two large, elaborate 
cages pay him no mind. 
? They're in and Joe's out but nobody's 
free. 
Joe i a blue blooded falcon, a rare 
and endangered species. He is a falcon 
by inheritance, a member of the estab-
lishment, a natural-born leader, a cousin 
of leaders, a classmate of leaders, a for-
mer roommate of leaders, and the chosen 
voice of the pedigreed "first-rate men" 
for .thirty years. 
For generations we've all been run by 
the East Coast cousins. The first cousins 
went to Grown and the second cousins 
to St. Paul's. The Irish Catholic fifth 
cousins. were named Kennedy?but that 
was later. First they were coachmen and 
named Pat and Mike. They went to 
Choate. 
? It is difficult to tell the cousins without 
an alumni bulletin. Cousins are not mea-
sured by blood alone, but establishment 
cousins do tend to marry establishment 
cousins and produce geneological cousins. 
. There are several (de 'facto) Jewish 
cousins named Lehmann, Ochs, and Mor-
genthau, but there are no Italian or 
Polish or Bulgarian cousins. Black people 
.are not ready to be cousins though some 
can be classmates. It is customary to 
speak well of the late Frederick Doug-
lass. 
Some cousins chuckle a lot and Joe's 
blood cousin Teddy' Roosevelt grinned 
and shouted "Bully" but most were 
serious faced and did not laugh out loud. 
This was partly because many were from 
New ? England but also because they 
were born to assume the awful responsi-
? bility of running the world.

Running the world. is not easy. Joe

was suggested that he get a job on a

Ogden Reid hired Joe at Joe's grand-
mother's suggestion and sent him to re-

'lough Sf Covert Action 
While the Administration has obtained a tern. 
porary order against publication of a bpok on 
the CIA by a former officer of it, Victor L. 
Marchetti, the public has reason to be thankful 
to the author. He has already provided outside 
of book covers some valuable insights and corn-
Inents on an agency that deliberately hides 
from the public and Congress. 
Without revealing any really hidden secrets, 
the author uses published reporls to note that 
the nation's intelligence budget is 6 billion dol-
lars a year, that the Central Intelligence Agency 
has 18,000 employes, and that 6000 of these 
'are working in clandestine services, as opposed 
to intelligence collection. 
As it is, .however, the CIA is the President's 
baby. ,Congress has proposed various control 
measures, such as a limit on the CIA budget, 
or requirements for clearer information about 
It, or Senator Cooper's present legislation for 
the CIA to give intelligence briefings to Con-
gress as well as the White House. Congress, 
after all, foots the bill, but it does not know 
for what. 
? 
CIA officials occasionally surface frdm se-
crecy', to complain that critics concentrate on 
CIA failures. If so, that is because the public 
only hears about the failures, and they have 
to be, big ones at that. They always seem to 
involve those covert or "paramilitary" opera-
tions, which range from a most qualified suc-
cess in Guatemala to an unmitigated disaster 
at Cuba's Bay of Pigs. Mr. Marchetti says, "I 
don't think we've had a successful paramilitary 
operation yet." 
The clandestine operations are worth review-. 
There was the U-2 spy plane incident that tor-
pedoed President Eisenhower's efforts to im-
prove relations with the Soviet Union. There 
was the CIA's proud armed intervention to 
"save" Guatemala from. leftists, leaving the 
country to, oppression and terrorism. There was 
the financing of Radio Free Europe which, when 
disclosed, stripped that station of every vestige 
of freedom or credibility. And there was the 
Bay of Pigs. 
Then there was the CIA militafy operation to 
save ?the Dominican Republic from a :rebellion 
to return a democratically-elected president. 
There was armed support for the overturn of 
a government in The Congo. Of course, there 
was the CIA's hand in the overthrow of the 
Diem dictatorship in South Vietnam, opening 
the way for another dictatorship more satisfac-
tory to Washington. And there is presently 
war in Laos, which the CIA actively engendered 
without any visible success for the American 
position in Southeast Asia, much less for peace 
and order. ' 
Aside from the fact that so many of these 
clandestine activities were inefficient and in-
effective, even aside from the fact that they 
were bound to' be failures for America's long-
? range pi?ospects and 'reputation even if they did 
succeed, the ability of the CIA to engage in 
paramilitary functions represents a continuing 
ability to start hostilities without the knowledge 
of the people or Congress, and certainly with-
out any declaration of war. 
Author Marchetti is fair enough to say .that,' 
so far various presidents have kept a measure 
of control over such activities. That is no guar-
antee for the future, however, and it is Con-
gress, not the President, that is supposed to 
make decisions on war. Consequently, Mr. Mar-
chetti recommends confining intelligence ac-
tivities to a small and highly professional group, 
and eliminating the covert actions entirely. 
Intelligence simply cannot work well when 
governed by an agency equally interested in 
activities ranging from propaganda to military 
action; that is a conflict of interest. The nation 
does need successful intelligence. It does not 
need a publicly-uncontrolled and unanswerable 
power tct make War

RICHARD WILSON. 
?SCOW Trip L?s ond Present Tens.fons 
It's a fair question why and 
how plans for President Nix-
on's visit to Moscow can go 
forward in the present state of 
tension and confrontation be-
tween the United States and 
the Soviet Union. 
President Eisenhower's pro-
jected trip to Russia was 
called off in May, 1960 under 
essentially less . provocation 
than the direct risk to Soviet 
shipping in Haiphong harbor 
at the present time. 
Although the Russians knew 
of reconnaissance overflights 
of Soviet territory, its leader-
ship exploded in fury when 
Red gunners. succeeded in 
shooting down a U2 spy plane 
and accused Ike of treachery. 
Premier Nikita Krushchev 
-withdrew his invitation to Ei-
senhower to visit Russia in 
June 1960 and U.S.-Soviet rela-
tions fell back into a deep 
freeze. 
The difference between then 
and now, if Nixon's analysis is 
? correct, is profound. We have 
done more than fly over Soviet 
territory (in fact, American 
spy satellites now do so every 
day.) 
We have damaged Russian 
shipping by aerial bombard-
ment. It is surmised we may 
have killed Russians at sur-
face-to-air missile sites in 
North Vietnam. 
It is commonly recognized 
that the war in Vietnam, par-
ticularly in its present stage, 
is a proxy conflict between So-
viet and American arms, with 
the prestige of both countries 
at stake. 
How, then, can we continue 
to talk to the Russians with 
great expectations of new 
trade arrangements, cultural 
exchanges and nuclear arms 
agreements? 
On Nixon's side, the answer 
is to be found in his underlying 
concept of his discussions with 
the Chinese and Russian lead-
erships. 
He sees those discussions as 
transcending present conflicts. 
He deems them to be of an 
historic nature meaning more 
to the next generation than 
this one.. 
Small token advances may 
be made with both Russia and 
China as a result of his visits 
to Peking and Moscow. Cer-
tainly the most will be made 
of any partial agreement on 
nuclear arms. 
But this is only the begin-
ning of what must be a con-
tinuing process extending over 
many years so that the very 
strong China of the future, and 
the very strong Russia and 
America of now and the fu-
ture, will not plunge the world 
into a horrendous conflict 
from which it might never re-
cover. 
Something of the same atti-
tude must be shared in Peking 
and Moscow, it is reasoned, or 
Nixon never would have been 
invited to Peking, nor have 
been received there as he was, 
and his projected trip to Rus-
sia would most certainly be 
" called off. 
Compared to what might 
happen in the future involving 
Russia, China and the United 
States in nuclear ware the 
present conflicts between 
these powers seem minor and, 
in any case, can eventually 
be overcome. 
One would like to think that 
this largeness of mind is as 
universal as Nixon evidently 
hopes it is. He adverted to this 
theme indirectly in China, par-
ticularly at the Great Wall, 
and it now appears to be a per-
thanent part of his political 
psychology which he likes to 
believe originates in the ideal-
ism of Woodrow Wilson. 
Therefore, the President, 
knowing that only Soviet arms 
make the present offensive in 
Vietnam possible, is willing to 
go ahead with the Moscow 
part of his general scheme re-
gardless. And the leaders in 
the Kremlin, with who knows 
what on their minds, are will-
ing to set to one side the 
threats to their shipping? and 
confrontation in the Mediter-
ranean, and the conflict over 
Israel. 
They are willing to suppress" 
their suspicions of Nixon's 
going to Peking and quit harp-
ing on some unknown secret 
deal between Chou En-lai and 
a perfidious American Presi-
dent. 
, Their receiving American 
advance delegations and going 
:ahead with Nixon's planned 
visit displays a mood quite dif-
ferent from their bristling an-
ger over Eisenhower's rela-
tively innocent venture in 1960. 
The United States desires an 
Improvement in relationships 
in certain areas and so does 
the Soviet Union. Those areas 
are limited. The outstanding 
big differences remain. In the-
ory, at least, those differences 
might prove less menacing in 
the future if some preliminary 
agreements can be reached

Mr. Marchetti was on the director's stall of the CIA when 
he resigned from the agency two years ago. Since then, his 
novel The Rope-Dancer has been published by Grosset & 
Dunlap; he is now working on a book-length critical analysis 
of the CIA. 
The Central Intelligence Agency's role in U.S. foreign af-
fairs is, like the organization itself, clouded by secrecy 
and confused by misconceptions, many of them deliberately 
promoted by the CIA with the cooperation of the news 
media. Thus to understand the covert mission of this 
agency and to estimate its value to the political leadership, 
one must brush myths aside and penetrate to the sources 
and circumstances from which the agency draws its au-
thority and support. The CIA is no accidental, romantic 
aberration; it is exactly what those who govern the country 
intend it to be?the clandestine mechanism whereby the 
executive branch influences the internal affairs of other 
nations. 
In conducting such operations, particularly those that 
are inherently risky, the CIA acts at the direction and with 
the approval of the President or his Special Assistant for 
National Security Affairs. Before initiating action in the 
field, the agency almost invariably establishes that its oper-
ational plans accord with the aims of the 'administration 
and, when possible, the sympathies of Congressional lead-
ers. (Sometimes the endorsement or assistance of influen-
tial individuals and institutions outside government is also 
sought.) CIA directors have been remarkably well aware 
of the dangers they court, both personally and for the 
agency, by not gaining specific official sanction for their 
covert operations. They are, accordingly, often more care-
ful than are administrators in other areas of the bureau-
cracy to inform the White House of their activities and to 
: seek Presidential blessing. To take the blame publicly 
for an occasional operational blunder is a small price to 
pay in return for the protection of the Chief Executive and 
the men who control the Congress. 
The U-2 incident of 1960 was viewed by many as an 
outrageous blunder by the CIA, wrecking the Eisenhower-
Khrushchev summit conference in Paris and setting U.S.-
Soviet relations back several years. Within the inner circles 
of the administration, however, the shoot-down was 
shrugged off as just one of those things that happen in the 
chancy business of intelligence. After attempts to deny 
responsibility for the action had failed, the President openly 
defended and even praised the work of the CIA, although 
for obvious political reasons he avoided noting that he had 
authorized the disastrous flight. The U-2 program against 
the USSR was canceled, but work on its follow-on system, 
the A-11 (now the SR-71,) was speeded up. Only the 
launching of the reconnaissance satellites put an end to 
espionage against the Soviet Union by manned aircraft. 
The A-11 development program was completed, neverthe-
less, on the premise that it, as well as the U-2, might be 
useful elsewhere.

$500 million-a-year private war in Laos and pacification/ 
assassination programs in Vietnam. 
The reorganization of the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity late last year in no way altered the CIA's mission as 
the clandestine action arm of American foreign policy. 
Most of the few changes are intended to improve the finan-
cial management of the community, especially in the mili-
tary intelligence services where growth and the technical 
costs of collecting information are almost out of control. 
Other alterations are designed to improve the meshing of 
the community's product with national security planning 
and to provide the White House with greater control 
over operations policy. However, none of that implies a 
reduction of the CIA's role in covert foreign policy action. 
In fact, the extensive review conducted by the White House 
staff in preparation for the reorganization drew heavily on 
advice provided by the CIA and that given by former 
agency officials through such go-betweens as the influential 
Council on Foreign Relations. Earlier in the Nixon Admin-
istration, the Council had responded to a similar request 
by recommending that in the future the CIA should con-
centrate its covert pressure tactics on Latin American, 
African and Asian targets, using more foreign nationals as 
agents and relying more on private U.S. corporations and 
other institutions as covers. Nothing was said about reduc-

Special to The New York Times 
BRATSK, ,U.S.S.R., March 
23 ?Across the vast ex-
panses of Siberia, the pros-
pect of President Nixon's 
visit to the Soviet Union this 
spring stirs little excitement. 
People are more interested in 
knowing- about American 
cars, books, rock groups and 
fashions. 
"I'd like to see New York 
?what are they wearing 
there?" asked a 23-year-old 
factory worker and amateur 
guitarist, decked out in a 
loose - sleeved yellow and 
green paisley sportshirt and a 
purple vest for a jam session 
of the Padun, a local group. 
When a visitor suggested 
that the young combo from 
Bratsk would be pretty much 
in vogue in New York and 
inquired where they had 
found costumes so far from 
the usual Soviet garb, a teen-
age flutist with long red hair 
replied with a laugh, "From 
you ? Americans." He ex-
plained that while the style 
was American, the clothes 
were home-made or ,custom-
made here. 
Questions About Cars 
In Irkutsk, a taxi driver 
wanted to know whether 
it was true that "Americans 
all have cars and they are 
bigger and better than our." 
He was immediately hushed up 
by two technicians who in-
sisted, "As you can see, we 
have everything here. 
At a Russian Orthodox 
Church, a grandmotherly yior-
*strollea up to two

of World War H, suddenly

tor 'up and down, she an-
It? swered herself: "I ' can. sec

In far off Yakutsk, south 
'  
of the Arctic Circle, an ac-
cordionist in a hotel dance 
band stopped at an Ameri-
can's table to ask whether 
American accordions had five 
rows of buttons or just four. 
(Generally, there are six.) 
In Novoisibirsk, a college 
senior wanted to know about 
,the lateskrecv&ved iSi

! The questions and com-
ments of Siberians in random 
conversations reveal aston-
ishing pockets of specialized 
knowledge about aspects of 
American life in the midst of 
ignorance about American so-
ciety in general. 
Capitalist Social Security 
Two industrial workers' 
riding the Trans-Siberian 
Railroad were at first skepti-
cal then sincerely surprised 
to learn that unemployed or 
disabled American workers 
receive social security bene-
fits and that many Ameri-
can college students receive 
scholarships. A 26-year-old 
welder was incredulous that 
a husband alone could sup-
port a middle-class family of 
four. In most Soviet families 
the wife must work, too. 
A young professional wom-
an in Novosibirsk, said that 
some Soviet women were so, 
stirred by the Angela Davis , 
case that they were naming 
babies after her, then asked 
why Miss Davis was being so 
persecuted. The woman later 
acknowledged that she had 
been unaware that Miss 
Davis had been charged with 
complicity in a murder. 
Many Soviet youths listen 
to the Voice of America reg-
ularly and are up-to-date on 
the lives of movie stars and 
rock musicians in America.

In Siberia, much , as in 
middle America, the tendency 
seems to he to regard inter-
national politics as the dis-
tant affair of officials in the 
capital. Publications in Mos-
cow may be gradually mel-
lowing in preparation for the 
Nixon visit, but thousands of 
miles away the people were 
either uninterested or wary 
about having Mr. Nixon visit. 
Some, remembering how 
President Eisenhower's 
planned trip to the Soviet 
Union in 1960 was canceled 
at the last minute because of 
the downing of the American 
U-2 plane piloted by Francis 
Gary Powers, are skeptical 
that Mr. Nixon will actually 
make the trip. 
"We built a special guest 
house for President Eisen-

.recalled over dinner. "Then 
he sent Powers and that fin-
ished it. We still have the 
house. Maybe Nixon will use 
it. But we'll have to see if 
he actually gets here." 
A teacher in Novosibirsk 
voiced a thought echoed by 
many others: "It would have 
been better if Kennedy could 
have come instead of Nixon." 
Memories of Old Days 
- Some of the wariness is 
attributable to Soviet mem-

One of the most unique 
? developments in the history of 
? aerial reconnaissance was the 
Lockheed II-2 reconnaissance' 
airplane. Design work on 
the U-2 was initiated in the 
summer of 1953 at the request 
and with the funding of the 
CentEaLatsligeege..,,,Ageewm 
By the summer of 1954 
construction of the prototype 
? airplane had begun and by 
1955 this first airplane had 
made its first flight. The 
? airplane was given a "U" 
? category designation to 
? maintain its veil of secrecy 
? relative to its real purpose (U 
being a designation given to 
Utility class airplanes). 
The C.I.A. had requested 
the U-2 for the express 
purpose of espionage 
,reconnaissance. They wanted 
an airplane capable of flying 
over forbidden territory at an 
? 
altitude so high it would be 
Immune to conventional 
anti-aircraft defenses. This 
airplane would, of necessity, 
also be capable of carrying a 
highly sophisticated 
lightweight reconnaissance 
package over very long 
ranges. 
? Lockheed Aircraft 
Corporation was chosen as 
main contractor in the U-2 
program for several reasons. 
In the main, they had 
Clarence L. "Kelly" Johnson 
(one of the true greats in the 
world of aeronautical 
engineering) and his design 
team, as head of their 
experimental and advanced 
projects division, and they 
had a super secret facility 
known as the "skunk works" 
? In which a ? airplane stcig s

. by JAY MILLER 
Johnson hhd done some 
outstanding work during his 
years with Lockheed. Some of 
his more famous products 
included the P-38, the P-80, 
and 'ate-F-104. After the U-2, 
came the world's fastest 
jet-propelled aircraft, the 
YF42A and the SR-71. The 
U-2 began its design 
development program at the 
same time as the F-104. As a 
result, the two aircraft 
mutually influenced each 
other, as a comparison of the 
two airplanes will bear out. 
Several crucial factors 
dictated the U-2's many 
unique features. First and 
foremost in importance was 
the airplane's weight which 
needed to be kept at a bare 
minimum. With very ? few 
exceptions every conceivable 
short cut was taken to keep 
the U-2 within certain weight 
restrictions. The landing gear 
was compromised down to a 
bicycle arrangement of a 
single main bogie with a 
smaller bogie in the rear. 
Outrigger wheels under the 
wings, used during taxiing 
and take-off, were jettisoned 
as ? soon as the airplane 
became airborne. The wing 
structure consisted of a single 
main spar with turned-down 
tips serving mainly as skids 
during landing and 
secondarily as "end plates 
which cut down on tip drag. 
Over-all, the wings had the 
amazing aspect ratio (chord 
to span) of 14.3 to 1 
(compered to a more 
conventional 6 to 1). Full span 
flaps filled up some 6 percent 
of the trailing edge span and? 
wing loading was 25 pounds

? The U-2 was virtually a 
powered sailplane. And like a 
STATI NTL 
, sailplane' it "ims a highly 
sophisticated, very efficient, 
and aesthetically appealing 
flying machine. ? 
The U-2, in its initial 
production U-2A variant, 
.entered service with the 
U.S.A.F. during the summer 
of 1956. All U-2's were 
? hand-made and as a result, 
production lots were 
relatively small, only 10 
airplanes per lot being built. 
During its first two years of 
service a total of some 20 
airplanes became operational. 
About 10 of these entered 
service with the C.I.A. under 
.the cover of N.A.S.A. Initial

Observers in Britain, 
6armany, and Japan noted 
etherwise. 
or two years U-2 ! 
reconnaissance missions were 
? flown over Soviet Russia 
beginning in the fall, of 1958. 
The missions did not go 
unnoticed inside .the Soviet 
Union but acknowledgement 
? by U.S. authorities that the 
flights were being made was 
nonexistent. The Soviet 
government demanded a halt 
to the overflights (this being 
kept from the U.S. press) but 
the demands were ignored. It 
was of utmost importance for 
the U.S. security system to 
know of Russia's internal 
workings. 
With very few exceptions, 
the 13-2 overflights remained/ 
one of the best kept secrets of 
the U.S. intelligence system. 
The U-2 was a seemingly 
impregnable reconnaissance 
machine and as long as it 
remained so; it would be used. 
A total of 55 U-2's were built. 
in at least three different 
models. Five of these were 
two-place U-2D's "(for missile 
monitoring), approximately 30 
etAcRopeovo1601R0 
approximately 20 were U-2B's. 
The JJ-2A was the intial 
production variant powered 
by a Pratt and Whiney 
J-57-P-37A jet-engine 
developing 11,200 pounds 
thrust. This version was 
capable of maximum altitudes 
in the vicinity of 70,000 feet. 
When the overflights began in 
,the fall of 1958, a newer, more 
powerful version of the U-2, 
the U-2B, was introduced. 
This version was powered by a 
Pratt and Whitney J-75-213 
jet-engine of 17,000 pounds 
thrust. This engine gave the 
11-2 a maximum operational 
ceiling of 90,000 feet. ? 
The engines used in the 
various 13-2 mOdels were 
special modifications of 
standard production engines. 
The main difference was in 
the compressor section. The 
U-2's engines had special 
broad chord blades in this 
section to make better use of 
the low air density at high 
altitudes. These engines also 
burned special low-volatility 
fuel (MIL-F-25524A). This 
prevented evaporation losses 
at high altitude and added an 
additional 5 per cent to 
the airplane's maximum range 
over standard JP-4. 
With the phenomenal 90,000 
foot altitude capability of the 
U-2B, it was well known that 
nothing the Soviet Union could 
put into the air could possibly 
come close to knocking the 
airplane down during an 
overflight. This was of course, 
barring the possibility of an 
engine failure or other 
malfunction. The original 
U-2A at 70,000 feet was in its 
own right, within this realm 
of immunity. The 13-23 was, 
for all practical purposes, an 
impregnable fortress. 
On May 1, 1960, Francis 
Gary Powers and his U-23 
were shot down near 
Sverdlovsk well inside the 
Soviet Union. Exact details as

and United States Foreign Policy (Random

undertook to arm Europe. The program 
had to surmount an initial obstacle: the 
American populace was not yet ready 
for a new holy crusade, and Truman 
needed large economic and military lar-
gesse from Congress to meet the sup-
posed threat. 
The issue Truman found to get this 
funding was Greece, as the United States 
prepared to move into the areas from 
which Britain was forced to withdraw. 
But to mask their real purpose, Truman 
had to present his intervention as a step 
on behalf of worldwide freedom. Hence 
the Truman Doctrine Was devised, and it 
"defined American policy for the next 
twenty years. Whenever and wherever 
an anti-communist government was 
--threatened, by indigenous insurgents, for-
eign invasion, or even diplomatic pres-
sure .??. . the United States would supply 
political, economic, and most of all mili-
tary aid." For Truman the terms " 'free 
peoples' and 'anti-communise were as-
sumed to be :synonymous." , Once the 
premise was accepted, the enormous inter-
ventions of future administrations were, 
but a step away. 
It was Korea, however, that allowed 
the Truman administration to finally 
achieve the enormous defense budget 
called for in the secret and influential 
National Security Council resolution 68j 
The drafters .of NSC 68 asked for a $35 
billion budget. This task Truman consid-
ered hopeless, calculating.that a reluctant 
Congress would grant at most $17 billion. 
At least, until Korea. The crisis allowed 
Truman to put the recommendations oi 
NSC 68 into effect. Ambrose is emphatic 
on one point: the Korean War, which-
ever side started it, was a boon?political-
fly, economically and socially?to Amer. 
ican imperialism. 
During the past ten years, it has become 
much more widely accepted that the cold 
war Was not a Russian invention. Cold-
war "revisionism" has made its impact. 
The shock of the Pentagon Papers has 
, been eased for many by acquaintance 
with the historical analysis of such schol-
ars as William Appleman Williams, 
Gabriel. Kolko, David Horowitz and 
Walter LaFeber. Yet until now, there has 
been no overall synthetic account that 
tells what each postwar administration 
did and also provides a critical analysis 
of its policies. 
? This task has been realized by Stephen 
E. Ambrose's Rise to Globalism. As the 
title suggests, Ambrose is concerned with 
the :developing globalist conception of 
America's role abroad. He realizes that 
this posture developed from the need to 
avoid a postwar depression by achieving 
new foreign marketsa problem, since 
"much of the proposed?market place was 
closed." Ambrose sees postwar foreign 
policy as formulated particularly to pre-
vent nationalization of American-owned 
property abroad, which meant an effort 
to create "an open door everywhere." 
The globalist shift was not mindless. "Pol-
iticians looked for areas in which Amen-
can influence could dominate; the busi-
nessmen looked for profitable markets 
and new sources of raw materials; the 
military looked for overseas 'bases," and 
/America began a "program of expansion 
that had no inherent limits." This basic 
stance was developed by the administra-
tion of Harry S. Truman; it is in its 
account of these years that Mr. Ambrose's 
book makes its most significant contribu-
tion. 
By 1947; Truman and his advisers 
"saw communist involvement in every at-
tack on the 'status quo anywhere and 
convinced- themselves that Kremlin ilk:Olt/Mgr 
As for the war itself, Ambrose 
corrects major errors in our understand-
ing of it. First, he points out that the 
U.S. authorities knew that North Korea 
was planning 10 invade across the 38th 
Parallel. In fact, the State Department 
had prepared a resolution condemning 
North Korean aggression days before the 
attack. But unlike I. F. Stone, who argued 
in his book that Syngman Rhee started 
the war with covert American support, 
Ambrose writes that the North Korean 
action was "too strong, too well coordi-
nated, and too successful to be a counter-
attack." He believes that the North Ko-
reans simply calculated that they could 
overrun the peninsula before the United 
States could reinforce South Korea. More-
over, American officials had already de-
was at the ppfOlve sQF etleas 
conquer the world." To deal with what 
was regarded as a worldwide threat, they 
may very we ave iou.ted.that America 
. would move in. 
Second, Ambrose presents a major revi 
sion of standard accounts of the Mac 
Arthur-Truman dispute. Truman's as-
sumption that American bombers alone 
would force the North Koreans back was 
quickly shattered. American troops were 
then brought in, supposedly only to re-
store the border at the 38th Parallel. But 
by August, the policy was to reunify 
Korea under the aegis of the South. 
Now. the' policy of-crossing the 38th 
Parallel and unifying Korea was not Mac-
Arthur's. Rather, it was the new policy 
of the Truman administration. The Presi-
dent's advisers argued that China would 
not intervene on Korea's behalf. Quoting 
from instructions issued by the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff to MacArthur, Ambrose 
writes that stepping beyond containment 
"came after full discussion and considera-
tion in the highest levels of, the American 
government. Truman later implied, .and 
millions believed, that MacArthur had 
gone ahead on his own, that it was the 
general in the field, not the government 
at home, that had changed the political 
.objective of the war in the middle of the 
conflict. Such was never the case. Tru-
man, with the full concurrence of the 
State and Defense Departments and' the 
Joint Chiefs, made the decision to liber-
ate North Korea." Much later, after. Mac-
Arthur's February 1951 offensive, Tru-
pan moved away from the objecti-e'of a 
military victory. But that policy :had it-
self arisen from the decision ? to favor 
containment, which actually meant war 
mobilization, a high defense budget, and 
a permanent cold-war footing for the na-
tion. That is the significance of Truman's 
flat rejection of Clement Attlee's plea for 
peace in Asia. 
In contrast to Truman ' and the policy 
of permanent intervention, Dwight D. 
Eisenhower appears in Ambrose's book 
as a President struggling nobly to mini-
mize the effects of the cold war. While 
his administration engaged in the rhetorit 
of liberation, the reality was more often 
a restrained Version of Truman's contain-
ment; Despite John Foster Dulles, Eisen-
hower was more flexible than hi:; prede-
cessor. The Republicans may have rattled 
the saber, but "they also shut down the. 
Korean War, cut corporate taxes, and 
reduced the size of the armed forces. 
? Despite intense- pressure and great temp-
tation,. they entered no wars. They were 
willing to supply material, on a limited ? 
scale, to others . . . but they would not 
commit American boys to the struggle." 
By 1955, the decision to go to the 
summit had undercut the failure of Re-

Force cargo plane finally

approached the Pikes Peak 
country from the west. Wearily, 
it seemed, the aircraft crossed 
the south shoulder of the peak, 
turned left, dropped flaps and 
began the long, gradual descent 
to .Peterson Field which serves 
both as an Air Force base and 
' the municipal airport of Colora-

The landing was uneventful. 
But from that point some strange 
things happened. 
The aircraft, a heavy-bodied 
.C130 powered by four turbo-
prop engines, taxied to a remote 
end of the field rather than to the 
regular ramp. A military bus 
quickly pulled up alongside.

ments in relations between the 
United States and Communist 
China, which portend so much 
for an era of peace, give that 
story a special timeliness. The 
details of this operation are 
reported here for the first time. 
To understand what this hush-
hush operation was all about, it 
is necessary to set the time, 
which was August 1959, and to 
recall the ominous twilight zone 
? neither peace-nor war ? into 
which relations between East 
and West had drifted in that 
period. With an eye toward the 
successful culmination of his 
two-term administration, Pres-
ident Eisenhower announced a 
series of international events 
leading to a super-Summit Con-
ference in Paris during May 
1960. 
The Korean War had settled 
into an uneasy truce six years 
earlier, in 1953. The Berlin Wall

Dulles enjoyed making wisecracks 
about the Victorian and Indian Army 
traditions still surviving in the British 
secret service, but he had a healthy 
respect for its unrivalled experience 
and great professionalism. He knew 
that CIA could learn a lot from the 
? British about operations in the Middle 
'East and Africa, where its stations 
were rapidly expanding. 
After Archibald Roosevelt, one of 
CIA's foremost "Arabists", had re-
stored cordial relations with SIS when 
station head in London, a plan of co-
pperation was devised for Africa, where 
most of the former British colonies had 
gained independence, anti were be-
coming subject to strong Soviet and 
Chinese pressure. Roosevelt was still 
in London when, in 1965, Rhodesia 
made her momentous "Unilateral 
. Declaration of Independence" (UDI), 
which led to the conflict with the 
Britigh Government. 
There is no better instance of the 
strengthening of CIA-SIS collabora-
tion than the hitherto undisclosed 
story of the services CIA rendered 
the British authorities in Rhodesia, 
particularly since about.1968. 
Indeed, in assisting the British SIS

products through the Portuguese ports

Africa to Europe and the Far East 
Merchants and shippers there .had 
made fortunes out of the traffic which 
the Portuguese were bound, by United 
Nations resolutions and agreements 
with Britain, to regard as illegal. 
After the closure of British missions 
in Salisbury all ? information about 
Rhodesian exports dried up at source. 
At this juncture CIA stepped in to 
assist the British. It was not merely a 
labour of love. American tobacco 
syndicates in Virginia, Georgia, 
North and South Carolina, Ten-
nessee and Kentucky greatly in-
creased their production and sales to 
Europe when Rhodesian tobacco 
growers lost most of their trade 
through sanctions. Traditionally, 
Rhodesian tobacco was used for cigar 
and cigarette manufacture in Belgium, 
Holland, Germany and Switzerland. 
When these supplies dried up, Euro-
pean manufacturers turned to Ameri-
can growers. But by and by Rhodesian 
exports began to flow again, by the 
use of false certificates of origin and 
smuggling through the Portuguese 
ports and through Durban in South 
Africa, much' to the displeasure of the

the policy of economic sanctions Americans.

visited the Soviet Union recently as

The three congressmen were Reps. 
James H. Scheuer (D-N.Y.), Earl F. 
Landgrebe (R-Ind.) and Alphonzo 
Bell (R-Calif.). Among them they 
contacted Jews seeking to emigrate 
to Israel as well as a Soviet civil 
rights leader, and distributed reli-
gious material to Soviet citizens. 
Their activities, however laudable 
and well-meaning they might have 
been, placed the U.S. Embassy here 
In an impossible situation. The em-
bassy, according to reliable sources, 
was deeply angered over the behavi-
or of the three visitors. The State 
Department even complained to the 
congressmen's Washington offices 
about it, according to the sources. 
While maintaining .an official 
stance of "no comment," one top dip-
lomat called the distribution of reli-
gious material here "stupid."

he Al-P eimin 
JACK ANDERSON achiev-
ed a Journalistic coup in pub-
lishing the minutes of the se-
cret White House meetings on 
the India-Pakistan crisis. But 
liow much of a hero is the 
man Who leaked the informa-
tion? 
My strong Impression is 
that he accomplished very lit-
tle public good, if anY. On the 
contrary, his actions are al-
most certain to drive the Nix-
on administration deeper than 
ever into secret dealings on a 
restricted basis. 
On the good side of the 
ledger, the leak has now pro-
vided unmistakable informs-, 
tion that the President delib-
erately tilted American pol-
icy in favor of Pakistan and 
against India. But that much 
was known to everybody in 
touch with the State Depart-
ment and White House at the 
time of the crisis. 
Sens. Edmund Muskie, Ed-
ward Kennedy and Frank 
Church, among others, said 
so. Hundreds of us wrote it. 
Indeed, one reason Henry Kis-
singer held his background 
briefing of Dec. 'I was to take 
the edge off the charges the 
White House was biased in 
favor of Pakistan. 
A second and more Impor-
tant gain from the revelation 
has to do with information 
about -the way the govern-
ment works. The secret min-
utes provide detailed, irrefu-
table evidence that daY-to-day 
foreign policy is made in the 
White House as never before. 
. They equally show that top 
officials allowed themselves 
to be treated as mere lackeys 
by the White House. Some of 
them?including such sup-
posed heavyweights as the 
chief of naval operations ? 
said, and apparently regularly 
say, things silly enough to 
issue from the mouth of 
Bertie Wooster. 
? Then there is the matter of 
truth-telling. According to the 
minutes in cpk.ty. odcryt 
son, Hen gs c 
f7 
WIMR. 
meeting of officials on Dec. 
3 that. "he (the President) 
wants to tilt in favor of Paki-
stan." 
On Dec. 7, in a background 
session with reporters subse-
quently released by Sen. Bar-
ry Goldwater, Dr. Kissinger 
said: "There have been some 
comments that the adminis-
tration is anti-Indian. This is 
totally inaccurate." 
Seen thus starkly, Dr. Kis-
singer told a flat lie. My im-
pression is that, taken in the 
larger context, his remarks 
at the secret conference were 
not in such flagrant contra-
diction with his remarks at 
the background briefing. Still, 
he was plainly trying to ma-
nipulate public opinion. 
BUT SO WHAT? Does the 
new evidence do more than 
suspicion that the depart.' 
ments and agencies are full 
of crypto-Democrats out to get 
the administration?is only 
going to be intensified. And 
that deep suspicion is going 
to yield two sets of adverse 
reactions. ? 
For one thing, security will ? 
be tightened. There is apt to 
be an end to th,,- kind of min-
utes that were taken at Dr. 
Kissinger's meetings. They 
will certainly not be spread 
through the bureaucracy any-
more. 
Seco:1ply, the limited access 
which experienced officials 
now have to White House de-
cision-making is going to be 
even further curbed. The 
President and Dr. Kissinger 
are going to keep things to 
themselves more than ever., 
Important decisions which are 
confirm a universal Judg- even now made with too little 
ment? After the U-2 and the /consultation. and with 
Bay of Pigs and the credibil- small an input from the 
ity gap, is there anybody not 
Impossibly naive or ill-inform-
ed who doesn't know that the 
government lies? Is one more 
bit of evidence a noble act? 
Or is it just a pebble added 
to the Alps? 
Set against these gains, 
there is the way the adminis-
tration is apt to react. Maybe 
the President and Dr. Kissin-
ger are going to say to them-
selves: "Golly, we sure erred 
in not telling the truth and 
nothing but the truth. Jack 
Anderson has taught us that 
honesty is the best policy." 
But much more likely, they 
are going to feel that the min-
utes of- the meeting were le-
gitimately classified internal 
working papers, of the govern-
ment. Probably they are going 
to feel that the stuff was leak-
ed not for any large purpose, 
but out of opposition to the 
policy. And almost certainly?
and I say this as an opponent 
of the policy?they will be 
right in this surmise. 
In 
these 
circumstances, the 
they have in the 
world is going to be 
even more sharply limited.

is something else. Whatever

? ? 
CENLEN : SPY OF THE CENTW1Y 
By E. H. Cookridgo. 
Hodder and Stoughton. 424 pages. 
The beauty of spies is in the eye of 
the beholder. Mine are fine, Until 
they get caught. Yours are black-
guards ; or so, at least, governments 
and spy trial judges conventionally 
pretend. In the eyes of most of us 
spies are ?remote outsiders' though 
worth a second glance should you ever 
surely recognise one. And Mr Cook-
ridge. observes in the opening chapter 
aof " Spy Trade " that it is not only 
the richly ornamental spy of'' fiction 
who excites pleasurable , curiosity. 
How it happens that many a " real 
life " spy has been able to turn profit-
-able publicist instead of having to 
? languish in jail ? for as long as his 
.captors had originally intended he 
-should, is amply explained in " Spy 
Trade." - The author discusses over a 
.score of postwar cases of governments 
bartering captive foreign agents 
against their own incarcerated men. 
For in the end, it seems, no govern-
ment is quite so beastly as to disown 
altogether a man who has supplied it 
with valuable intelligence; however dis-
reputable he may have been made to 
look subsequently. 
? A ?delicate matter in'these exchanges 
is the comparative worth of the 
hostages. available. When equally big 
fish are' not at. hand several small fry 
have the good luck to be thrown in 
to balance the scales. Mr Cookridge 
devotes seven of his i chapters to the 
intricate circumstances in which 
/..Moscow exploited the windfall of Mr 
.Gary Powers. and' the U-2 shot down 
Over Siberia to effect the ? release in 
February, 196; of Colonel Rudolf. 
Ivanbvich Abel, the highly competent. 
Soviet spy in the United States, who 
had been sent to prison for. 30 years. 
Among other comparable cases con- .

paratively insignificant west German 
archaeologist, h-au Martina KiSchke. 
The book is aptly illustrated with 4o 
photographs. ??e? ? 
Like the rest Of us, spies tare mostly 
weird birds, variously impelled by 'the 
exigencies not only of mating, feed-
ing 'and drinking (preferably the hard 
stuff) but also by patriotism, religious 
or political '? belief, some personal 
grievance 'against society, or, above all; 
by the desire to be somebody different 
and . important. Even- the fabulously 
competent and studiedly aloof General 
Gehlen displays in his recently pub-
lished autobiography an undignified 
itch to play to the gallery, not merely 
for the lolly. ?that a knowledgeable 
agent (literary) can rake from the 
international market but also for 
personal vindication in the face of 
latter-day disparagement. 
Mr Cookridge, perhaps in deference.. 
to his publishers, calls his other book

in fact Reinhard Gehlen himself

of the west, first the United States,

.Intelligence Service he tapped sources 
, invaluable information from-
Ple rival east German Democratic 
Republic, especially in the days when 
it was expanding much of its " People's 
Police " into- a " People's Army 
tutored by Soviet officers. In March, 
1968, Gehlen was the first to .predict, 
on the strength of contacts in the 
Soviet Union, that Moscow would dis-
place the Dubcek regithe in Prague by 
force. Eventually he came hi for heavy 
public esiticism for high-handed ways

years in America? He dretv a whopping y3O-

Greenglasa for betraying (for ',300) the inform 
secret of the A-Bomb, the lens-trigger. r. a ? 
SBut Abel's harvest was never detailed dur 
his trial, except that it had to do with Snopp 
around "military secrets." When the FBI mud 
n on him he was living in a cheap New York 2 
Street hotel with a lot of radio receiving e u 
\I meat. It did not seem quite elaborate enough for a 
"master s,py." Yet the CIA dhector, Allen Dulles, 
said at the time of Abel's conviction, "I wish we . 
had three or four like him in Moscow." . 
? . The FBI was pretty certain that he was a full 
colonel in the KGB, the Soviet Union's secret 
police, and that during World War 111th might 
have infiltrated circles clOse.to Hitler. Abel was a

the Russians announced that they had never heard

Moscow ?:--- having been swapped for our airborne 
spy, Francis Gary Powers ? he was lauded in ' 
Pravda by none other than the KGB director. And . 
in 1036 the popular Soviet magazine "Young Cora-
munist" had, a big- spread on him. It praised his 
''courage, valor and boundless devotion," and 
even quoted him on his perilous profession: 
- "Intelligence work is not a series of rip 
roaring adventures, a string of? tricks or an en 
tertaining .trip abroad. It is, above' all, arcittous 
painstaking work that calls for an intense effort 
. perseverance, stamina, fortitude, will power 
. serious knowledge, and great mastery." 
- - He may have been building himself up. Spying 
against the U. S. is something like spying el 
-Times Square. As the last citadel of the free press 
.we relieve a spy of most of traditional chores. We

COL. Rudolf Ivanoviel 
Abel, at one time the Soviet 
Union's master spy in this 
'country, reportedly has died 
- of lung cancer in Russia. He 
was 6'8. 
Col. Abel, who posed as a 
:struggling artist in a small 
? studio in Brooklyn in the 
j1950s, was exchanged in 1962 
for American U-2 pilot Fran-
Gary Powers, " 
The Soviet -spy, who 
headed his country's 'espio-
:nage network in the United 
..States for nine years before 
his arrest in a New York 
hotel room in 1957, had been 
sentenced to 30 years in 
prison. 
.Sentencing of the nondes-
cript, bald and slightly built 
Russian followed a dramatic 
,trial in the Brooklyn Fed-
eral District court house 
jUst "across the street from 
his cluttered $35-a-month 
, photographic and art studio. 
? "While he turned out a few 
paintings, his time was 
'spent mostly in finding out 
national defense data of this 
country and inicrolihning it. 
, The microfilm was then hid-
den in hollowed, out coins; 
bolts, pencils and blocks of 
Wood. His studio also con-: 
tamed short-wave receivers 
-capable of picking up radio 
messages from Moscow. 
, ? 'Col. :Abel, who slipped 
. into the United States ille-
, gally from Canada in 1948, 
? Used the name of Emil R. 
Goldfus during his years in 
:this country. He was ex-
posed when an assistant, 
Reino Hayhanen, defected 
and told. American authori-
ties about hirn after being 
ordered back to Moscow. 
The principal charges 
against Col. Abel included 
? conspiracy to transmit at-
comic and military informa-
tion to his country, which he 
- gathered through a system 
of codes; secret drops and 
..couriers. 
. But even during his trial, 
? few specifies were given on

years and eight months of 
his 30-year sentence, when-
he was exchanged for Pow-

down in ,the American U-2 
spy plane over. the Soviet 
Union in 1950. . ." 
The secret and heavily' 
guarded exchange took 
place at " the Glienicke

the 10-year sentence - ha-

WASHING-TON, Nov. C?Some of my 
be-St fri.ends are spies. ? 
I was talking to on the other day 
who was complaining that moot Ameri-
cans seem to -fitinl: t,hat we don't 11?..;;CI 
any undercover agents, altho it is all 
:fight for the other side [sides) to have 
plenty el them. . . . . 
There is a' little bit of truth in what 
itile spy says. Everybody knows that'we 
have the Central Intelligence Agency 
.becaus.e_ it gots blamed for everything 
" that goes wrong in the spy business. 
The spy-in-the-shy case in which Gary 
. POWCTS got shot down in his high-flying 
?. / 1J-2 airplane is perhaps the best known 
' case, but the CIA also tool: the rap for 
the ill-fated invasion of Cuba which was 
to unseat Fidel Castro. 
-But the CIA is not really all that big 
and RS jab gets compounded heel-also 
many, if not most, of the ether govern-
ment. bureaus which do business over-
seas  
- like to .tahe individual his at 
- spying. This includes _the Federal Elu-
rep or Investigation with agents plant-
ed everywhere?from among revolution-
any groups to Barth Day rallies. 
At the last demonstration .against the 
;--iif'-2) 
- ? 
White ITorie policies On Viet Nara, it 
rather small affair as .demonstrations 
go, it WaS noticed by this reporter that 
an awful let of the people mingling with 
. the demonstrators didn't really look the 
part. Investigation disclosed they were 
from the CL1FA)P.:13 Office., Secret Service, 
Internal Revenue Service, United States 
Marshal's Ofilce, or the Bureau of Far.-
- cotics, to name a few., ' 
Not too many years ago, we learned 
of .t?t diplomatic trip to Russia by an 
American [who shall not be named] 
who took along a group loaded with 
more gadgets to detect radiation than 
.they could carry at one time? One of 
the gadgets was shaped like a slightly 
oversim fountain pen. 
, After we gave up the 11-2 flights over 
Russia put not China] the Military de-
veloped cameras for space satellites 
that today are launched in secrecy 
' from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Cal., 
. 
to circle far above foreign nations. The 
, detail from these pictures is amazing-
- and helpful. 
? . - - - 
But this sort of thing is never talked 
about in more' conventional places of 
American government, especially not at 
the State Department. There is a cer-
tath disdain shown toward spies and 
spying at state, a trait shared by diplo-
rests of many Western nations. 
So it was with interest that I listened 
when another spy-told me how Villiam 
Rogers, secretary of state, had played 
a key role .in helping Egypt purge ,its 
nation of CommuniF.4 spies. 
The story the spy told us ,was that 
Rogers had been equipped with a wrist 
watch that could detect electronic 
eavesdropping equipment. This makes 
sense because there are any member of . 
minute .electronic devices that could be 
detected by a watch of this kind.? 
E. is also on public rbcord that East 
Europeans had indeed been e.:pellod 
front Egypt for planting listening de-
vices in a variety of official meeting 
places. 
In any event, Rogers' watch was sup-
posed to have sounded a signal during a 
private meeting with President Amvar 
Sadat that they were under electronic 
surveillance. Sadat, of course, heard 
the buzzing. I asked Rogers the other - 
night if the story was true. ? 
.The secretary grinned and said he 
had heard the same story. 
"But," 'he insisted, "it.: just isn't 
true." it's getting so you can't _even 
trust spies any more.

and others. Remember the clear-cut lies by the 
Executive relating to the shooting down of the U-2 
Eight over Russia in 1969? Remember that first they 
described the pine as haying been a weather plane 
off course. Then Khrushchev revealed that thy not 
only had parts of the plane but they had the pilot 
alive. After which the President himself took respon-
sibility for the U-2 plane and admitted that It had 
been a spy reconnaissance flight. Ile was very much 
criticized for having, admitted this, which demolished 
the. summit conference scheduled right afterward. 
? Most Americans assumed! that Eisenhower had 
.not known of the flight, certainly in detail. I think 
most people believed this on two grounds: that 
there's, a lot that goes on that no President knows 
about In detail and that Eisenhower knew even less 
.than most President:s because he was always on the 
golf course. ? 
? In the Course of doing this.study, I looked into 
the U-2 crisis. quite closely and finally went to the 
.man who was. in charge of the U-2 progm.m. from. 
beginning to end, who had left the CIA at that point.

four or five hours. lie said that for every. flighi of the

NEW YORK, Sept. 8 [Rene 
tersl-a-The remarkable per-
formance of spy'-in-the-sky sat-
ellites and a "tacit understand-
ing" by the governments of the 
-United States . and the Soviet 
Union not to interfere with 
them could be a major factor 
in preserving- the peace, an ex-
pert on the subject has report-
ed. 
There even were two occa-
sions in a one-year. span when 
the information from recon-
naissance satellites saved the 
peace, according to Philip J. 
Klass, an avionics editor of 
the magazine Aviation Week 
and Space Technology. 
Product of Think Tank 
Klass gives the first detailed 
study of the .history and ability 
of reconnaissance satellites in 
the book,. "Secret Sentries in 
Space" [Random House, ? 
p.0.33.? 
According to Klas the first 
concept of .spy-in-the-sky satel-
lites stems from a report by 
the Rand Corp., ?the Air 
Force's think-tank?in 1046. The 
technology to actually build 
the satellites was created when 
Bell Labs invented the transis-
tor in 1048. 
All that was needed were 
rockets big enough to launch 
the satellites and the will to do 
so. During , the Eisenhower 
years many government offi-
cials . believed Space was' a 
"frivolous" diversion and gave 
little- credence to the possibili-

The Spies Above 
/ If a U-2 overflight could once pro-
yoke crisis, as the Francis Gary Powers 
incident did in 1960, the elaborately pre-
cise spy satellite systems of the U.S. 
and Soviet 'Union a decade later have 
created and enforced a de facto "open 
skies" policy between the two super-
powers. Today such satellites slide 
through space like disembodied eyes re-
cording an astonishing variety of in-
formation. Just over a month ago, for 
example, the Pentagon revealed that the 
latest Soviet SS-9 ICI3M ground tubes 
-are exactly 20 ft. in diameter. 
Neither country, naturally, is very 
talkative about its espionage system. But 
in a new book, Secret Sentries in Space 
r (Random House; $7.95), Philip J. Klass, 
senior avionics editor of Aviation Week 
& Space Technology, offers a first, fas-
cinating look at the space hardware that 
has, so far, contributed to global stabil-
ity. By allowing the two major nuclear 
powers to examine one another's military 
installations in exact detail, the satellites 
have considerably diminished the danger 
of war throughmiscalculation. 
Florida Force. During the 1961 Ber-
lin crisis, the "first generation" of Dis-
coverer satellites was aloft, and John 
Kennedy was able to show Soviet For-
eign Minister Andrei Gromyko pho-
tographs indicating exactly how few 
ICBMs the Soviets really had. "I be-
lieve," says Klass, "that after Gromyko 
saw those pictures he persuaded Khru-
shchev to back down." , 
Similarly, Klass writes, "the President

Klass submitted proofs of his book 
to the CIA and the Pentagon; they ob-

ILOVC to stop it. No one else has writ-i 
ten in comparable detail about spy sat-
ellites. Klass describes; for example, the 
nation's latest SAM05,(satellite and mis-
sile. observation system); "the Big Bird," 
launched just two months ago. A giant, 
twelve-ton spacecraft capable of working 
aloft for at least several months, the 
Big Bird combines the capabilities of sev-
eral earlier satellites, It can transmit 
high-quality pictures by radio, and eject 
capsules of exposed film which then

weaponry, spy satellites provide a va-
riety of data for civilian use?in geo-
logical studies, for example, or even 
narcotics control. Color firm pictures of 
the poppy fields of Southeast Asia and 
elsewhere, taken from satellites, have 
been projected at the White House. 
When President Nixon referred recently 
to international control of narcotics, he 
had in mind the U.S. capability to 
point out the exact locations of the 
world's poppy fields. 
In the past 18 months, the Soviets 
have moved one step ahead of the U.S. 
They have devised a killer satellite that 
can track, inspect and blow up another 
satellite aloft. The situation is not un-
like that in the James Bond epic You 
Only Live Twice. The U.S. is still de-
veloping such a destroyer, and the pos-
sibilities are ominous. Should one side 
decide to knock out the other's spies, 
Klass concludes, "it will turn space into 
a battleground, precipitate a still more 
costly arms race and return the world 
to the perilous days of the .late 1950s."

of a diplomatic officer, he attempted. 
to cover his efforts to gain informa-

to comMunicate reports by radio to'

The Nixon administrati on. 
has -ordered a -halt to the cis-
patching of special CIA-sup-.1 
Etiorted teams of .Laotian:' 
tribesmen into China on re-. 
eonnaissance patrols' from. 
bases in northern Laos, ac-
cording to well informed dip-
lomatic sources. 
These patrols-L-which some.: 
times range 200 'miles inside 
China's Yunnan Province on. 
road-watching, telephone-tap-
ping missions----have been 
going on for a number of? 
years, and their existence wasi 
known to the Peking regime. I 
Nevertheless, in a recent ac-
tion designed to avoid any pos-
sible incident which could! 
sour 
U.S. relations with Pe-
king before President Nixon's: 
forthcoming trip to the 
Chinese mainland. the forays 
have been halted, according to . 
official sources here. . 
,Some sources also suggest: 
that the intelligence value of 
these- operations may also 
have decreased somewhat. 
Although no Americans go 
on these patrols, the Laotian 
bill tribesmen who carry them 
out are recruited, trained and 
equipped by the CIA, and the 
staging area for the patrols is 
a CIA outpost in northern 
Laos. 
The Laotians are native to 
the border region, and the in-
telligence-gathering operation 
.took advantage of the -normal 
movements back and forth of 
those bill people. ? 
While the White House, CIA 
and the U.S. embassy in Vien-i 
Cane have never commented: 
on or confirmed these activi-I

tliation?the patrols have been: ?

STATI NTL 
Inlate 1970 'and early this.: 
year, articles by Michael Mor-
? row of Dispatch News Service} 
InIernational described the re-1 
connaissance operations in 
considerable detail. ? 
As recently as June 27, Ar-
nold Abrams of The Philadel-
phia Bulletin reported that 
the raids were still being car-
ried out despite the onset Of 
Ping Pong Diplomacy. 
The order to 'stop these pa-
trols, according to informed 
sources, came 1,?ery recently. 
Presidential aide Henry Kis-
nger's secret trip to Peking 
was made July 9 to II. 
In another move relating to 
the forthcoming Nixon visit, a 
press report last week, citing 
administrative sources, said 
the United States had sus-
pended- flights over Commu-
nist China by high-flying SR-
71 spy planes and unmanned 
reconnaissance drones. This. 
concession was also depicted 
as a move designed to avoid 
any incident which could in-
terfere with the President's 
journey, 
. However, well placed de-
fense and intelligence, , offi-
cials, asked about the reported 
suspension, said privately that 
to the best of their knowledge 
there had never been any SR-
71 flights Over the Chinese 
mainland. 
Officials say there was a 
suspension of the unmanned 
drone flights some months 
ago, partly for diplomatic rea-
sons and partly because of 
technical problems and the 
vulnerability of these drones 
4to Communist gunners. At 
least two of the drones were 
shot down since late in 1969, 
one over the mainland and 
one over Hainan Island. 
There have been flights of 
the older-vintage 13-2 spy 
plane over mainland China 
carried out by the Nationalist 
Chinese, but officials hint that 
these flights, too, have not 
been scheduled for about a 
year. 
The United States for some 
time has relied On satellites 
for photographic coverage of 
goings-on inside China. The 
SR-71s based in Asia, sources 
say, are' used primarily for 
flights over North E.orea. .

is different, as. any UN diplomat can explain at

Ehrushchev the sledgehammer he necded to break 
up a summit conference in Paris attended by 
himself, President Eisenhower, ChEtrles De Gaulle 
and Harold Mac:million. 
Khrushchev's dressing down of Eisenhower at 
the Elysee Palace was the most humiliating mo-
ment ill the President's life. The Soviet Premier's 
news cenference. the following-. day in Paris 
sounded for a time like a declaration of war. 
The scheduled Eisenhower trip to the Soviet - 
-Union -- returning Khrushchev's U.S. visit to the: 
year before -- was 3:evoked. It had promised to be 
the high point of his life as Chief Executive. It was 
planned for him to make half a dozen major 
speeches to the Soviet people. They had been 
written for him and, in the opinion of one of the. 
" writers, Dr. Kevin McCann, could have brought 
about:a fine relationship between the world's two 
great powers. Dr. McCann is also sure that the 
speeches, which had to be junked, would have 
eliminated all chance of the subsequent eyeball-to-
eyeball confrontation and threat of thermonuclear 
war during the Cuban missilie crisis of 1992. 
So, this time well play it cozier. President 
Nixon does not want a fly (or a flier) in his oolong.

President Nixon has much better liaison with the

sion . of SR71 and drone reconnaissance flights over 
mainland China. - ? 
This is prudent insurance against' an incident which 
? E might disrupt' the President's plan to visit Peking 
sornelime before next May. The Chinese resent the

just as we would if we were in their place. Most impor-
tant intelligence information can be gained from recon-
naissance satellites anyway. 
Perhaps we can never know the true impact on 
Russian-U.S. relations of the U2. flight over .Soviet 
Russia on May 1, 1960. This reconnaissance plane pilot-
eel by Francis Cary Powers was shot down approxi-
mately 1,200 miles within the Soviet Union. Premier 
Nikita. S. Khruslichev refused to participate in the Paris 
sumrnit conference scheduled for May 16 unless Presi-

It has been evident forseme. time 
that our Government was seeking tci 
detach itself from a China policy con-

One week after the announcement of President 
Nixon's trip to the People's Republic of China, the PeMng: 
government issued a "serious warning" about the 41,\lth' 
military aerial intrusion. 
. Now the White IIonse has announced that there will be. 
no rrwe flights over China by the SR-71 spy plans. It 
seeks to avoid an unpleasant incident. 
? However, U.S. reeionnaisance satellites will continue 
to conduct military operations over China, as will "pri-
vate'' SR-71s on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency, 
and American U-2s flown by Chiang 12:al-Shell airmen. 
? The ceremonial pause. in U.S. SR-71 spy flights over 
China do not prove Nil.,:bn's peaceful intentions. 
- The flights prove that China is an "enemy" target, 
that U.S. imperialiS.in is an enemy of People's China, event. 
as it is an enemy of the entire socialist world and the 
national liberation ? movements. The Chinese leaders' 
hostility to the Soviet Union is not enmity to "revision-
ism,". as they assert, but enmity to-the wofld's first social?

WASHINGTON, July 
Administration officials said to-
day that the United States had 
suspended flights over Commu-
nist China by manned SR-7l. 
spy 'planes and unmanned le-
connaissance drones to avoid 
any incident that might inter-
fere with President Nixon's 
:forthcoming visit to Peking. 
But,' it was reported, Ameri-
can reconnaissance satellites 
:will continue missions over Chi-
na. Such missions are consid-
ered relatively unprovocalive 
since they are well above the 
.airspace of China, 
In 1930, it was recalled, a 
planned conference between 
.presicint Dwight D. Eisen-
hower and Premier Nikita S. 
Kruschev was called, off by the 
Soviet Union after an Ameri-
can U-2 spy plane had been. 
shot down over Soviet: ter-
ritory. 
U-2 planes are flown oyer 
the Chinese mainland by Chi-
nese Nationalists from Taiwan, 
an official informant said "the 
mainland Chinese have good 
enough radar to distinguish be-
tween art overflight by the kind 
of aircraft we possess and. the 
kind flown by the Chinese Na-
tionalists"

,as much more compelling than 
continued intelligence from an 
occasional SR-71 or drone mis-
sion. Some sources also noted 
that the, suspension conceivably 
might be lifted after President 
Nixon's visit to China, although 
a similar suspension of flights 
-over the Soviet 111111011, 
tUted after the 1960 U-2 .in-
Cident, remains in effect. 
..,,White House officials, in re-
porting July, 16 on Henry 'A. 
Kissinger's- conversations in 
Peking with Premier Chou En-
lai the Nixon visit, ex-
pressed confidence that neither 
nation, "will knowingly do 
something that would under-
mine the prospects of something 
that it took so long to prepare 
and that it took such painful 
decisions to reach,"

?Although officials were. re-
luctant 'to discuss the specifics 
of American intelligence-gather-
ing activities in relation to 
China, the following details 
have been pieced together from 
well-infprmed .sourees: 
The bulk of photographic re-
connaissance is done by spy 
satellites operating at altitudes 
of about 100 miles. Photos 
taken from that altitude would 
;allow aaalysts to determine, 
(say, the type of aircraft sitting 
on a- field- but not to read its 
wing markings or discern de-
tails or armament. 
If a new type of aircraft was? 
spotted by a satellite, intel-
ligence- officials could call 
an SR-71 mission to get clearer,:

carried by the Sit-71, which, 
flies at an altitude, of about 
50,000 feet, reportedly can cap-
ture small details. - 
According to time imformants, 
a handful of SR-71, operated by 
the Air Force, normally fly from 
Okinawa. There are additional 
SR-7)'s in the Far East, they 
say, flown by civilian' pilots 
under contract to the Central 
-Intelligence Agency. 
Because of its 'high altitude 
and 'great speed?more than 
2,000 miles an hour?the SR-71 
is ? not believed vulnerable 
either to Chinese surface-to-air 
missiles or interceptor aircraft. 
,It can provide photographic 
coverage of about 611,000 square 
miles in an hour. 
The U-2, by contrast, has a

The drone, the Ryan Firebee, 
is also used for some recon-
naissance missions. Typically a 
C-I 30 "mother -ship" carries 
two drones to a point outside 
the defenses of mainland China, 
where It launches -them. They 
fly a predetermined course and 
return to a safe point over 
water where they are parachut-
ed down and recovered.. 
Peking has publicly protested 
nearly 500 incursions of its air 
space by United States aircraft. 
The United States also uses 
SR-71's and drones over North 
Vietnam and North Korea. Be-
sides cameras, the SR-71's also 
carry equipment to monitor 
and record radar and% radio 
transmissions.

MIDDLE: EAST 
Flybys and Superspies 
Israel celebrated the 23rd birthday of 
its potent air force last ..yveek with flow-
ery words and impressive flybys. The 
words came from the ?air force com-
mander, General Mordechai Hod: "We 
breathe the air of the summit of Mt. Her-
moo, our wings trace the tranquil waters 
of Mirfatz Worn? [Sharm el Sheikh] 
and the reaches of Sinai, and our jets em-
brace the skies of Jerusalem, which has 
become a united whole." Then at Hod's 
order came phalanxes of Phantoms, Sky-
hawks, Mirages, Mysteres and Ouragans, 
of Sikorsky helicopters and Noratlas, 
Dakota and Stratoeruiser transports, and 
even of gnatlike Cessnas. 
The only disappointing aspect of the 
display for Israelis was that it did not in-
clude more of the swift, dangerous U.S.-
die East power balance differently. from 
the Israelis, partly. because it considers 
the Phantoms a useful lever for mov-
ing Israel into 'a Suez Canal agreement. 
The Phantom decision is still, so to 
speak, up in the air, but Jerusalem 
hopes for some progress when Assistant 
Secretary of State Joseph J Sisco makes 
a scheduled visit this week. "We don't ex-
pect Sisco to come flying over in a flo-
tilla of Phantoms," says a government 
official. "But we do hope that he will 
come ?vith words. of encouragement." 
Arab Buildup. On the eve of Sisco's 
trip, pro-israel politicians in the U.S. 
have been spreading alarmist reports 
about a significant buildup Of Arab air-
powe,r. The Egyptians, according to 
Washington estimates, have received 100 
lvtlGs since last September, in addition 
to 80 MI-8 troop-carrying helicopters. 
Syria has got 30 HiGs, five Sukhoi-7 
fighter-bombers and 22 helicopters. All

proximately 85 Phantoms and lost nine 
?in sorties over Sinai or in accidents. 
Last year it requested another 4.0 or so 
to keep its military power on a par 
with that of the Arabs. 
The Administration has postponed a 
decision, partly because it secs the Mid-
