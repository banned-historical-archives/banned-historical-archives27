 U. S.  C*AB INET CHANGES
 FIRST COMNIST MEDIA REPORTS SPARSE, LACKING IN CO'1'1ENT
 Initial communist media reaction to the high-level cabinet and other
 personnel changes announced by President Ford on 3 November has been
 sparse and scattered to date. The Soviet media thus far have confined
 themselves to selective reportorial treatment implying that the changes
 mean a continuation of the U.S. detente policy.  East European media
 have been more forthcoming, with the East Germaas in particular stating
 directly what Moscow has only implied-that the removal of Defense
 Secretary Schlesinger was a step based on an Administration desire to
 preserve the momentum for detente and disarmament negotiations.  Peking
 media have not yet acknowledged the U.S. cabinet changes.  Other
 communist media treatment has only begun to appear.
 MOSCOW     Moscow has reported briefly the high-level personnel shifts
 in the U.S. Administration announced by President Ford on
 3 November, but it has not yet commented on these events.  There can
 be little doubt, however, that Moscow will assess the shifts positively,
 interpreting them as an indication that the Ford Administration intends
 to continue to pursue good relations with the Soviet Union.
 Moscow's initial report on the changes was a TASS English dispatch on
 3 November citing U.S. press reports thaw the President was planning
 cabinet changes :_nd that Defense Secretary Schlesinger and CIA Director
 Colby were among those slated for replacemer.':.  Another TASS English
 report ou the 3d announced Vice President Rockefeller's letter to the
 President asking not to be considered as a candidate for the 1976
 elections.  Moscow revealed the news to its domestic audience on the
 4th, in a commentary by Aleksandr Druzhinin reporting selectively o'..
 U.S. media comment on the President's press conference.
 While avoiding any single explanation for the U.S. leadership shifts,
 Druzhinin gave. prominence to interpretations that identified Schlesinger
 as the key figure in the changas.  The former defense secretary's
 reputed disagreement with Kissinger over SALT, as well as other
 unspecified disagreements over the defense budget and questions of
 intelligence collection, were identified as causes of his resignation.
 Druzhinin went on to imply by other citations and by his reporting
 of the President's positive statements on detente and SALT that the
 main issue precipitating the government shakeup was the issue of
 detente.
 This interpretation fits the general picture of the Washington
 political scene that Moscow has been projecting in its comment for
 some time.  The latest issue of USA journal, for example, carried an
 article by chief editor V.M..Berezhkov which interpreted Schlesinger's

 5.93Q-2
 reported comments about the possible use by the United States of
 nuclear weapons to prevent a battlefield defeat as reflecting a
 "struggle about detente underway in U.S. ruling circles."
 Schlesinger has been identified by Moscow as a spokesman of the
 conser'rative forces within the Administration, his published remarks
 on nuclear doctrine and the "Soviet threat" usually being cited as
 evidence.  In addition, some Soviet writers have implied that the
 tornier secretary has held a deep-seated hostility toward the Soviet
 Union.
 EAST EUROPE     Initial comment by Moscow's East European allies
 and Yugoslavia on the high-?lavel personnel changes
 announced by President Ford on 3 November cautiousl, approved the
 shifts as a success for the Ford-Kissinger detente policies and a
 defeat for ousted Secretary Schlesinger's tough defense policies and
 the so-called military-industrial complex.  At the same time, East
 European commentators warned that the struggle bet.;:7een "realistic"
 and hardline philosophies in U.S. foreign policy was far from over
 and that the deeper implications of the changes would emerge only
 with the passage of time.  Only passing attention has been given to
 the replacement of CIA Director Colby,, the event being treated as
 a predictable outgrowth of the current Congressional investigations
 of the Agency.  There was little initial comment on the designated
 new Defense and CIA chiefs, Rumsfeld and Bush.  The meager comment
 devoted to Vice President Rockefeller's withdrawal as Mr. Ford's
 1976 running mate routinely assessed the move as strengthening the
 President's support from c..nservatives in the coming election.
 The East Ber$.in radio, which has carried the largest volume of comment
 so far, declared in a WLshington-datelined Kaeubler dispatch on the 3d
 that President Ford had to make a choice between "two diametrically
 opposed poles of foreign policy planning" and dismiss Schlesinger in
 order to avoid jeopardizing the signing of a SALT II agreement with
 the Soviet Union.  The commentary also viewed Schlesinger's replr.cement
 as reflecting President Ford's desire to keep intact "Nixon's system"
 of concentrating foreign policy direction in the White House.
 A Prague television commentary on the 3d noted that in his appearance
 on U.S. television on the 2d, the "well-known hawk" and Presidential
 candidate, Senator Jackson, "was attempting to keep Schlesinger in
 a post which is very important for the military-political relationship."
 Curiously, and erroneously, the Prague radio claimed that President
 Ford at his news conference "had confirmed that the differences of
 opinion" between Kissinger and Schlesinger had caused the latter's
 removal.
 There were mixed views about the implications of the shakeup for
 Secretary Kissinger.  The Budapest radio on the 3d surmised that the

 President had taken "a swipe at Kissinger" by relieving him of his
 National Security Council post,--a move that had "long been
 demanded by hardliners opposed to Kissinger's method of negotiations."
 And the Warsaw radio the same day speculated that alleged Congressional
 distrust of Secretary Kissinger might induce the President to remove
 him also in order to improve Mr. Ford's relations with Congress.
 In the only substantial comment on the removal of CIA Director Colby,
 the Budapest radio on the 3d remarked that his departure would be
 welcomed by those who had considered him "too talkative" before the
 Congressional investigating committees.  The commentary added that
 Colby had, however, never been brought to account for "his real
 sins"--administration of t::e Phoenix program, which had "resulted in
 the murder of 40,000 Vietnamese."  Belgrade's TANJUG the same day
 attributed the CIA leadership change to the recent revelations about
 alleged domestic spying and plots to assassinate foreign leaders, and
 to intelligence "failures" in Vietnam, the Middle East, Cyprus and
 Portugal.  The TANJUG commentary noted approvingly that the U.S.
 Government personnel changes were intended by President Ford and
 Secretary Kissinger to convince the Soviet Union that they were
 "resolute and sincere" about continuing a policy of detente.
 Romanian broadcast  media so far have only reported the U.S. changes
 without comment.
 CUBA     Havana domestic service on 3 November promptly reported the
 shakeup in the U.S. executive branch, attributing the changes
 to "serious disagreements within the Administration" and, indirectly,
 to Congressional criticism of the intelligence community.  The report
 noted that "although it praises their ominous international activities,"
 the U.S. Congress disapproved of the intelligence agencies' spying
 in the United States.  While Havana merely reported the "firing" of
 Defense Secretary Schlesinger and CIA Director Colby, the broadcast
 emphasized Secretary Kissinger's removal from his post as national
 security adviser, noting that "from that position, Kissinger controlled
 all subversive activities" carried out by the CIA, NSA and armed forces.
 VIETNAM     Initial comment on the U.S. leadership changes in North
 and South Vietnamese communist media has for the most
 part comprised replays of Western news accounts.  Focusing mainly
 on the change in Secretary of State Kissinger's role, the Vietnamese
 broadcasts have devoted comparatively little attention to the dismissals
 of Defense Secretary Schlesinger and CIA Director Colby and to Vice
 President Rockafeller's decision not to run in 1976.  While not
 directly attacking Kissinger, a 3 November Hanoi radio broadcast
 pointedly cited speculation that President Ford's moves were meant
 to curtail Kissinger's power.  And, in an apparent attempt to discredit
 Kissinger's management of the National Security Council (NSC), the same

 and the Middle East and from the recently revealed CIA activities.

 commentaries of the 5th--have dismissed the changes as political
 maneuverings which will have little effect on U.S. policies.

 U,S,-SOVIET TRADE
 MOSCOW MENTION OF GRAIN PURCHASE CONFINED TO AMERICAN AUDIENCE
 A 3 November Moscow broadcast in English to North America carries
 the only known Soviet mention to date of the longterm U.S.-Soviet
 agreement on purchases of U.S. grain which was signed on 20 October.
 Moscow media intended for the Soviet audiefce not only have ignored
 the agreement but have completely avoided any mention of the subject
 of grain imports.  The broadcast reference came in a commentary on
 recent developments in Soviet-American trade by Yevgeniy Shershnev,
 deputy director of the USA Institute and a specialist in foreign
 trade.  He argued that the recently signed agreement on "annual
 Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat and corn over a five-year period"
 would benefit both the United States and the USSR.  He declared that
 it would guarantee American farmers a market, stabilize employment
 for transport workers, and help the United States with its economic
 problems by ensuring a billion dollars export income every year.
 In acknowledging that the agreement "is also profitable to the
 Soviet Union," Shershnev alluded to crop failures only in the most
 general way, evading the admission that current Soviet crop failures
 were a key factor in prompting the agreement.  Thus he said that the
 deal would not only help overcome the "adverse effects that unfavorable
 climatic conditions have on crops in certain years," but, more
 importantly, it would permit considerable savings through directly
 importing grain to the Soviet Far East rather than expensively
 shipping it by rail from European Russia.   In this manner, Shershnev
 said, longterm import agreements with the United States "or other
 specific countries" provide broad prospects for "a mutually
 advantageous international division of labor."
 While decrying the failure to implement the 1972 U.S.-Soviet trade
 agreement because the United States "has not fulfilled its commitments,"
 Shershnev professed optimism concerning future Soviet-American
 economic ties and concluded that "in the final analysis commonsense
 will prevail and obstacles which today still hamper these ties from
 developing will be eliminated."
 Shershnev had authored a substantial article on U.S.-Soviet trade in the
 27 September issue of RURAL LIFE.  In it he favorably reviewed recent
 U.S.-Soviet trade agreements and discussed Soviet imports of such
 items as U.S. equipment and consumer goods.  Although he stressed the
 advantages for both countries of "longterm agreements on stable
 exchanges of some types of agricultural products," he nowhere mentioned
 Soviet imports of grain, nor did he give any indication that a longterm
 agreement on this subject was being contemplated at the time.

 PEKING SEES MOSCOW WEAKNESS, GUILE BEHIND U.S. GRAIN DEAL
 Peking has broken its silence on the U.S.-Soviet five-year grain
 pact and oil purchase agreement with a spate of comment predictably
 gloating over Moscow's agricultural shortcomings and the implica-
 tions for Brezhnev's position, but warning that the Soviets may
 exploit such deals to their own strategic advantage.  China's
 reaction came in signed articles in PEOPLE'S DAILY on 31 October
 and 2 November and an NCNA commentary on the 31st.  Peking radio
 broadcast the comment widely to foreign, including Russian, audiences.
 Prominent PEOPLE'S DAILY commentator Jen Ku-ping asserted on
 2 November that the Soviet agreement to purchase U.S. grain had
 underlined the "bankruptcy" of the agricultural policy of the
 "Khrushchev-Brezhnev clique," claiming that Moscow's agricultural
 failures stem from the Soviet "restoration of capitalism" and
 Moscow's allegedly distorted economic development policies that
 give first priority to "wild armaments expansion and war prepara-
 tions."  Jen played up Moscow's official silence on the U.S. deal
 as an indication of the Brezhnev regime's wariness about the
 internal implications of admitting agricultural failures.
 In the same vein, NCNA on the 31st devoted the bulk of its anti-
 Soviet diatribe to mocking the Soviet need to purchase grain as
 evidence of Brezhnev's "important personal contribution" to Soviet
 agriculture.  It noted that in this case Brezhnev has "kept mum,"
 despite his usual practice of "lauding to the skies" even minor
 U.S.-Soviet agreements, because the Soviet leader was aware that
 Khrushchev's downfall had been prompted by his own agricultural
 "mess."
 Jen Ku-ping depicted the United States as using the grain deal as
 "a mans of influencing the Soviet revisionists, thereby keeping
 the momentum of the latter's rivalry with it within bounds."  But
 he and the PEOPLE'S DAILY commentary on the 31st intimated that
 Moscow might turn the deal to its own economic and strategic
 advantage.  Thus, Jen Ku-ping observed that Moscow was using its
 current crop failure as "a convenient smokescreen" for building
 up a "strategic reserve of grain" that would put Moscow in a better
 position in any future conflict with the West.
 PEOPLE'S DAILY on the 31st warned that while the USSR has shown its
 economic w,iakness and dependence on Western grain and leans, "the
 Soviet revisionists are also cunning and crafty."  Specifically
 recalling the 1972 "great grain robbery," when it said the USSR
 "fattened" itself on U.S. grain purchased with "American government
 subsidies," the article declared that the current Soviet purchases

 Moscow of using Western economic loans to woo countries such as
 Turkey away from the NATO orbit with the lure of Soviet economic
 assistance.  It also claimed that Moscow was,employing grain
 purchases to stave off Soviet domestic hunger while continuing
 rapid militarization of the Soviet economy, thereby enhancing
 Moscow's "military threat" to the West.
 BACKGROUND     NCNA reports on Soviet purchases of U.S. grain
 earlier this year included 18 September and
 9 October dispatches on the course of the U.S.-Soviet negotiations
 in Moscow for a long-term grain contract.  The reports had been
 confined largely to criticism of the Soviet agricultural "failure"
 and denunciations of Moscow's alleged efforts to gain economic
 profit at the West's expense.  NCNA had depicted the Ford Adminis-
 tration as using the Soviet agricultural difficulties "to press"
 the USSR to agree to a long-term contract so as to sell off
 surplus U.S. grain while avoiding the "serious disruptions" and
 a "politically disastrous rise in domestic food prices" caused
 by past Soviet purchases.

 USSR - VIETNAM
 LE DUAN VISIT TO MOSCOW SUGGESTS STRENGTHENED RELATIONS
 An improvement in Soviet-Vietnam relations in both tone and substance
 is suggested in the publicity surrounding the 27-31 October visit to
 the USSR by Vietnam Workers Party (VWP) First Secretary Le Duan.  The
 visit was marked by unusually warm Soviet praise for the Vietnamese,
 and was capped by a joint declaration which broke new ground in
 putting Hanoi on record as supporting Moscow's policies of detente.
 The warming trend in Soviet-DRV relations raises the question of whether.
 Hanoi will be able to continue its balancing act between its two giant
 communist allies.  Some doubt as to the state of PRC-DRV relations was
 raised during Le Duan's visit to Peking at the end of September.
 Chinese comment was notably restrained, and the visit ended summarily
 without the usual reciprocal Vietnamese banquet and a joint communique.
 On the other hand, it is possible that Le Duan will stop over in
 Peking en route home. The first secretary is currently vacationing in
 the Soviet Union and will go from there to Poland, continuing a tour
 of East European countries that began in early October.*
 SOVIET-VIETNAMESE     The protocol of the Le Duan visit to Moscow
 RELATIONS             closely paralleled that during his previous
 visit in July 1973, with General Secretary
 Brezhnev acting as host and the top echelon of CPSU leaders joining
 in talks and turning out for Le Duan's arrival and for a luncheon on
 28 October and a Kremlin reception on the 30th.  However, the warm
 tone of the current Soviet reception for the VWP first secretary
 surpassed that reflected in 1973, at a time when Soviet-Vietnamese
 relations were still exacerbated by the impact on Soviet detente
 policies of the continuing hostilities in Vietnam after the signing of
 the January 1973 Paris peace agreement.
 Brezhnev set the tone for Le Duan's current visit in his 28 October
 banquet speech, praising the "prestige" and "consistent internationalist
 policy" of the VWP and lauding Le Duan personally as an "outstanding
 figure in the world communist movement."  In the past, Moscow as well
 as Hanoi have reserved such praise only for the late Ho Chi Minh.
 The final joint declaration, signed by Brezhnev and Le Duan on
 30 October, most clearly illustrates the improvement of Soviet-DRV

 relations since 1973.  The current Brezhnev-Le Duan talks were said
 to have taken place in a "warm atmosphere of fraternal solidarity,
 mutual understanding, and mutual respect"--a more positive description
 than in 1973, when talks were said to have passed in "an atmosphere
 of cordiality and comradely mutual understanding."  More important,
 this time the two sides were said to hold "completely identical
 views on the matters brought to discussion"--a claim not made in 1973.
 The key substantive difference between the two declarations was
 Vietnam's current willingness to endorse' explicitly the Soviet policy
 of detente.  Both the 1973 and 1975 declarations c.ctained Vietnamese
 approval for Soviet policies of strengthening peace ar.' security,
 peaceful coexistence, and support for the popular struggles for
 independence and social progress; however, the current document
 goes on to affirm the final goal of making "the course of detente
 irreversible."  Lingering Vietnamese misgivings about detente seemed
 reflected in a 1 November NHAN DAN editorial on the visit, however,
 which omitted the allusion to detente from an otherwise complete
 citation of the Vietnamese declaration of support for Soviet foreign
 policy.
 In line with the more forthcoming Vietnamese endorsement of Soviet
 diplomacy, the Vietnamese section of the declaration also went further
 than the 1973 document in paying tribute to Moscow's international
 position.  Thus, the Vietnamese side asserted that the Soviet Union
 is "playing a specially important role" in the common struggle of
 nations for peace, independence, democracy, and socialism.   By
 contrast, in 1973 the statement had merely acknowledged Soviet
 activities "with other fraternal socialist countries."
 The Soviet side was similarly more forthcoming this time in appraising
 the stature of the VWP.  While the 1973 statement had merely noted that
 the Vietnamese struggle was led by the party, the 1975 declaration lauds
 the "glorious" VWP for its "skillful" leadership.  The current document
 also contains a gratuitous reference to the VWP as a "Marxist-Leninist
 party" and maintains that:  "The prestige of the VWP--architect o_`.
 all the victories of the Vietnamese people--has increased markedly."
 In this same vein, the brief 1973 statement of satisfaction with the
 "continuous fruitful development of Soviet-Vietnamese friendship and
 fraternal cooperation" was expanded considerably in the current
 declarr.tion and underlined with references to the "unshakeable"
 character of the ties.  Amplifying the suggestion in the 1973 statement
 that the parties expand their ties and consultations, the current
 declaration specifically provides for broadening the exchange of
 experience by "arranging for contacts between leaders of the two
 countries, for mutual visits by missions of party cadres, and by

 promoting contacts between party ot'gans."*  It further states that
 the two sides would "encourage visits of official delegations and
 statesmen and appoint special envoys to regular meetings to
 exchange views on matters related to relations between the two
 sides as well as on international problems of mutual concern."
 Also, the declaration commits Vietnam to economic, scientific, and
 technical cooperation in the "framework of multilateral cooperation
 of the socialist countries"--a formulation not previously agreed to
 by Hanoi which could presage some Viet.aamese association with CEMA.
 ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS     The economic assistance package concluded by
 the Vietnamese in Moscow, also signed on the
 30th and described in the joint declaration, included an agreement
 on Soviet assistance, including long-term loans, to Vietnam during
 1976-1980, and a protocol on the coordination of the Soviet and
 Vietnamese five-year plans.  Specifically, the agreement provided for
 assistance in examining the technical and economic aspects of the
 construction of an unspecified number of "major national economic
 projects," and loans on a "most-favored.-nation" basis to enable
 Vietnam to promote industrialization, agriculture production, and
 welfare over the next five years.  Soviet and VieL:uamese media also
 reported that an agreement on "goods exchange and payments" for
 1976-1980 and a protocol on trade and payments for next year was
 signed on 31 October.
 Reports on Soviet-DRV ec.-)nomic agreements for 1974 and 1975 had
 not similarly specified that Soviet assistance to Vietnam would
 take the fora cf loans.  During Le Duan's July 1973 visit to Moscow,
 Brezhnev had announced that the Soviet Union had decided to waive
 repayment for all assistance given during the previous war years.

 sides had confirmed an agreement--also mentioned in 1973--on an
 official friendship visit to the D RV by a Soviet party-government
 delegation.

 MIDDLE  EAST
 MOSCOW EVINCES CONCERN OVER CURRENT CRISIS IN LEBANON
 Soviet ;acdia have given civil. strife in Lebanon over the past two
 months regular reportage and comment, most of which has emphasized
 concern for the heavy toll in lives and property and urged a
 peacef.u.l. solution to the factional  fighting.  Moscow's treatment
 of the recent crisis has laid the blame on "Lebanese react i ern"
 while backing "progressive" forces, ,just as was done with previous
 outbreaks of fighting earlier this year.      In recent weeks Soviet
 commentators have begun to express support for domestic reform:;
 to solve the crisis, especially reform of Lebanon's political
 system, which has involved power-sharing arrangements between the
 Christian and Moslem communities based on a 40-year-old and now
 inaccurate census favoring the Christians.
 Moscow's recent comment has been consistent with Soviet reaction
 to prev'i.ous outbreaks of fighting last April, May, and .June-.July.*
 Thus, Moscow has denounced "Lebanese reaction" and the predominantly
 Chr'_Grian "rightist forces" led by Pierre Jumayyil's Kata'ib
 (Phalangist) Party for allegedly fomenting and sustaining the
 conflict.   Predictably, Soviet comment has supported the "progressive
 and national patriotic forces"--chiefly Moslems in Kamal Junhl.att's
 leftist Progressive Socialist Party, the Lebanese Communist Party,
 and the Ba'th Party, with the support of Palestinian fedayeen
 groups.   In persistently urging a peaceful resolution to the conflict,
 Moscow has commended efforts by Prime Minister Karami, "the national
 dialog committee," Syrian and Palestinian mediators, and others to
 negotiate an end to the fighting.
 Soviet comment raising the issue of external interference in
 Lebanon's problems predictably has condemned Israel for allegedly
 seeking to heighten and exploit the crisis, while avoiding direct
 charges of U.S. or Arab state involvement.  A major. PRAVDA commentary
 on 3 October warned directly that events in Lebanon had provided "no
 grounds for interference ii. Lebanese affairs by other states,
 particularly Israel."  While making no direct claim:. of U.S.

 strife in Lebanon in May 1973, involving units of the Lebanese
 army and the Palestinian fedayeen, see the TRENDS of 9 May 1973,
 page 16, and 16 May, page 20.  At that time, Moscow essentially
 maintained an even-handed approach toward both sides and urged
 a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

 involvement on its own authority, Moscow has insinuated U.S.
 interference by replaying occasional Arab accusations and by
 suggesting U.S. support for Israel.]. plans to capitalize on the
 conflict by attacking Palestinian fedayeen-positions.
 CAUSES OF      Soviet analyses of the underlying causes of Lebanon's
 CONFLICT       crisis have stressed three major points, recently
 exemplified by PRAVDA's editor for Asian and African
 countries, Pavel Demchenko, in a 3 October PRAVDA article and again
 on Moscow radio's 2 November roundtable program.  Demchenko
 listed the preconditions for a major conflict as (1) the development
 of acute social and economic divisions--"a gulf formed between a
 handful of parasitic rich and hundreds of thousands of deprived
 paupers"; (2) the maintenance of a special political system
 involving procise power-sharing arrangements between Christians and
 Moslems--"the ratio  has not changed since 1943  [when the arrange-
 ments were established in the un,aritten "national pact" as Lebanon
 prepared for national independence], although the balance between
 the religious communities has, of cou.?se, changed since then" in
 favor of the Moslems; and (3) the influence of some 300,000
 Palestinian refugees, constantly in conflict with Israel in southern
 Lebanon as well as with Lebanese "haute bourgeoisie and rightist
 parties" who allegedly want to expel the Palestinian groups from
 Lebanon.
 A similar explanation was provided by IZVESTIYA's foreign affairs
 editor, Albert Grigoryants, on the 12 October roundtable.   Relying
 heavily on an analysis by LE MONDE's Mideast specialist, Eric Rouleau,
 Grigoryants emphasized an increase in recent years in Lebanon's
 "social polarization" which has been "aggravated by religious and
 ethnic stratifications."  He developed the point that the Christians
 were formerly in the majority and therefore "the ruling Christian
 elite holds key state posts and wields great economic power," whereas
 Moslems now make up "some 65 percent" of the population.
 CRITICISM OF            Soviet comment on recent fighting has zeroed
 RIGHTISTS, ISRAEL       in consistently on Lebanese "rightist forces"
 and condemned them for provoking the conflict,
 resisting efforts by Prime Minister Karami and others to end the
 fighting, and failing to honor cease-fires.  The comment has also
 accused  Israel  of seeking to aggravate and exploit the crisis by
 conspiring with the Phalangists against the Palestinians.  As in past
 comment, the most common Soviet charge has been that Israel wants
 to destroy the Palestinian fedayeen groups and has exploited the
 development of Lebanon's civil strife to intensify its air and sea
 raids against Palestinian targets in Lebanon.   In September, PRAVDA
 on the 14th, IZVESTIYA on the 17th, and RED STAR on the 27th, all
 asserted that Israel's military actions against Palestinian targets

 had regularly increased in proportion to the fluctuating domestic
 conflict in Lebanon between the Phalangists and progressives.
 Additionally, some Soviet comment has charged that a conspiracy has
 existed between Israel and the Phalangists against the Palestinians.
 A. lengthy article by L. Medvedko in the 3 October issue of NEW
 TIMES, for example, alleged that a "pincers operation" was being
 waged by Israeli and Phalangist forces.  Similarly, the deputy
 director of Moscow's Institute of World Economy and International
 Relations, Ye. Primakov, alleged on Moscow radio's 24 October
 "international situation" program that the Phalangists and Israel had
 arranged "two plans," one to provoke civil war and Lebanese army
 intervention against the Palestinians, the other to wage a "so-
 called pincers operation" to trap the Palestinian fedayeen
 between invading Israeli forces and the Phalangists.  An "unofficial"
 Radio Peace and Progress broadcast in Arabic on 3 November repeated
 Primakov's remarks, accusing Israel additionally of beginning to
 prepare to intervene with military units in southern Lebanon.*
 U.S. ROLE     Typical of the effort by Soviet media to exploit Arab
 and Palestinian accusations of U.S. involvement in the
 Lebanese crisis was a TASS 30 October report citing a message to
 Libyan leader al-Qadhdhafi from PLO head Yasir 'Arafat which charged
 that "there is no doubt that the United States is behind the events
 in Lebanon" and. that the crisis fits U.S. Mideast policy goals,"to
 split the Arab revolutionary movement, to support reactionary
 forces, and to strengthen its influence in the region,"  Additionally,
 Moscow has made thinly-veiled hilts of U.S. involvement through such
 expressions as "Israel and those who support her" and "Zionism and
 imperialism."  More recently, however, a K. Geyvandov PRAVDA dispatch
 on 3 November cited the Israeli newspaper DAVAR as having lamented that
 "the Western countries which formerly supported the Christian community
 in Lebanon have now abandoned it" and as being displeased that the
 United States considered events in Lebanon to be "an internal affair."
 tOSCOW SUPPORT FOR     In accord with previous Soviet comment this
 PROGRESSIVES, PLO      year on Lebanon, Moscow has consistently
 referred favorably to Lebanese "progressive
 forces," often citing their positions on issues and stressing that
 they have worked for a negotiated end to the fighting.  In the same
 *  Charges that Is:-ael was preparing to implement contingency plans
 to invade and occupy southern Lebanon "up to the T.Itani river" have
 appeared occasionally in Soviet comment during t:he past year.  A
 9 January IZVESTIYA article by L. Koryavin, for example, asserted
 that "there is now a grave danger Israel may at any moment occupy a
 considerable part" of southernLebanon and alleged there was a "long-
 sta.lding" Israeli contingency plan for such an invasion.

 vein, Moscow has praised major Palestinian groups in Lebanon for
 their political maturity in refusing to be drawn into major
 fighting and for seeking to remain outside the conflict altogether.
 Ye. Primakev, for example, in remarks on Moscow radio's 24 October
 "international situation" program, stressed that Israeli and
 Phalangist schemes against the Palestinians had not succeeded
 largely due to "the sober attitude of the Palestinians, who refuse
 to interfere in the domestic affairs of Lebanon and even attempt
 to reconcile" the two sides and "bring about peace."  Soviet
 comment has also praised the "positive" and "responsible" role
 of the PLO in cooperating with Prime Minister Karami  in trying
 to restore order and arrange cease-fires.  2LO head Yasir 'Arafat
 has been occasionally singled out and praised for his efforts
 to mediate between the fighting factions.
 SOLUTION TO     Throughout the crisis Moscow has consistently urged
 THE CRISIS      a negotiated solution tc the conflict, favorably
 reporting !rime Minister Karami's efforts to arrange
 cease-fires, and expressing cautious optimism about a return to
 domestic security and peace during each of the numerous short-lived
 cease-fires.  As to the specifics of reforms that might lead to a
 solution, however, Moscow has largely.limited itself to generalities
 that fall within the programs urged by Lebanese progressives--
 evidently reflecting awareness that the predominantly Christian
 "rightists" want little or no change, and the predominantly Moslem
 "progressives" seek substantial reforms.  Most Soviet cor.iment favoring
 reforms has expressed its support by citing Lebanese sources, as in a
 4 November TASS dispatch from Beirut by A. Urasov, which said that
 Beirut newspapers were urging an end to the conflict and "a political
 settlement on the basis of political, economic, and social reforms."
 Similarly, an earlier reference to the issue of reforms was a
 23 September PRAVDA dispatch by K. Geyvandov which cited Beirut's
 AS-SAFIR as saying that "wide-ranging democratic reforms of a
 political and socio-economic character" would provide a solution
 to the conflict, noting that such reforms were being proposed by
 Lebanese progressives.
 Much Soviet comment has implied the need for reforms in discussion
 of the Christian-Moslem population ratio.   By noting that the ratio
 has changed over the years in favor of the Moslems, the comment has
 implied that the 1943 "national pact" should be revised.   Soviet
 commentators have not always been consistent with each other in
 discussing the present  ratio--estimates have ranged from "roughly
 equal" to "a slight Moslem majority" to "65 perc.mnt are now Moslems."

 Moscow has infrequently advocated the need for Lebanese domestic
 reforms in original comment.  Thus, a 25 October SOVETSKAYA
 ROSSIYA article by V. Nikolayev, entitled "Lebanon's Difficult
 Days," concluded that "the time has come to think seriously about
 ,he problems facing the country and to try to approach from
 constructive positions the resolution, above all, of tasks of
 socio-political reorganization."
 While expressing support for domestic reforms, Moscow has opposed
 rumored plans for the partition of Lebanon along religious
 community or other lir. s.  Much of the opposition, as typified
 in remarks by-'P. Demchenko on the 2 November roundtable program,
 has been expressed as support for the Lebanese progressives' call
 for "preservation of the country as a united state."  Additionally,
 some comment, as in a 25 October IZVESTIYA article by L. Koryavin,
 has attributed the notion of partition to "certain circles which
 are kindling the internal contradictions in Lebanon" and to
 "enemies of the Arab nation" who desire "to weaken resistance to
 imperialist intrigues."

 SOVIET-FRENCH                       RELATIONS
 MOSCOW DEFENSIVE IN CONr1ENT ON DISCARD VISIT
 While Soviet comment has routinely stressed the importance and
 success of French President Giscard d'Estaing's 14-18 October
 visit to the Soviet Union, it has nonetheless provided evidence
 to support Western press speculation that Soviet behavior during
 the visit was cool.  Not only has there been no party-government
 statement endorsing the results of the visit--a feature of all
 previous French-Soviet summits--but a major PRAVDA editorial
 article on 26 October has assessed the visit in lukewarm terms
 while going out of its way to stress the Soviet Union's unfailing
 commitment to Marxism-Leninism, at best an inappropriate reassu.:ance
 given the nature of the occasion.  Moreover, the editorial article
 format--the -nosc authoritative form of editorial statement--suggests
 that Moscow regards the issue as unusually sensitive, since all
 previous French-Soviet summits have rated straight editorials only.
 IDEOLOGY AND DETENTE     In its defense of ideology, PRAVDA asserted
 that the Soviet Union, despite its purr-uit
 of peaceful coexistence with France and the other capitalist cotn-
 tries, "invariably and inviolably maintains position; of Marxism-
 Leninism and proletarian solidarity with the workers and liberation
 movements of the peoples."  A similar statement was made by Brea::hnev
 at the 14 October Sinner speech welcoming Giscard.  The French
 President had suggested a few minutes earlier that detente should
 be extended to the field of ideological rivalry, but Brezhnev
 replied that "relaxation of international tension by no means
 eliminates the struggle of ideas."
 Moscow also seemed to go out of its way to curry favor with the
 French communists by reporting in PRAVDA during the French
 President's visit a French Communist Party communique which was
 critical of Giscard's domestic and foreign policies.  The communique
 also criticized the Giscard government for allegedly trying to
 get Moscow to put pressure on the PCF to modify its policy.
 In the same vein, the PRAVDA editorial article quoted L'HUMANITE
 as criticizing the French Government for giving only verbal support
 to Soviet proposals or. prohibiting the development of new types
 of nuclear weapons and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.
 L'HUMANITE had rebuked the French Government for not making any
 positive moves in this direction "without further delay."  PRAVDA
 appeared to be expressing Moscow's concern and annoyance over
 reports that France might station some of its tactical Pluton
 nuclear missiles in West Germany.

 BILATERAL RELi.TIONS     Soviet irritation with Giscard over what
 the Kremlin sees as France's declining
 independence and indications of renewed interest in NATO also
 surfaced during the visit. In his 14 October speech Brezhnev
 reminded Giscard that "the strength of France's po!icy lies in
 its independence" and "an independent France" can make a sub-
 stantial contribution to the strengthening of international peace.
 Referring to the two counries' mutually expressed interest in the
 "materialization of detente," the editorial article cautioned that
 it could not be forgotten that NATO is continuing to accumulate
 weapons "despite and in defiance of detente."
 Insufficient progress in trade and economic cooperation between
 the two countries was alluded to on a number of occasions by the
 Soviet media and PRAVDA conveyed Moscow's disappointment with
 France in this regard.  It said that even though trade and economic
 relations are developing "favorably on the whole" there is still
 "much unused potential" in this sphere.

 PEKING RESTRAINED IN DENYING CHINESE CROSSED INDIAN BORDER
 A 3 November PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement used
 relatively restrained language in denying charges made in a 1 November
 statement by the Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman, who claimed that
 Chinese troops had violated Indian territory in a 20 October clash
 which killed four Indian soldiers.  The Chinese statement avoided the
 harsh invective against the Indian government and its China policy
 that have characterized Chinese statements on the border since the
 1962 Sino-Indian war.  China did not comment on the border incident
 until after the Indian statement made it public.
 According to the Chinese statement, Indian soldiers crossed into
 Chinese territory on 20 October despite repeated warnings from
 "Chinese civilian checkpost personnel" and opened fire on the Chinese
 side, causing the latter to "fire back in self-defense."  The statement
 said that the incident took place at the Tulung.Pass (located cn the
 eastern Sino-Indian border near Bhutan), as the Indian troops crossed
 "the line of actual control of November 7, 1959"--a phrase used by
 Peking in the past to refer to the so-called McMahon line which
 delineates the eastern part of the Sino-Indian frontier.
 Peking's statement noted that a Chinese protest on the incident had
 been delivered to the Indian Embassy in Peking on 22 October, that the
 Indian Embassy had agreed on the 25th to accept China's offer of the
 22d to collect the bodies of the four dead soldiers, and that an Indian
 representative at Tulung had accepted the bodies and captured Indian
 weapons and ammunition from the Chinese side on the 2F,th and had
 signed "a receipt."
 BACKGROUND     Though accusing the Indian side of spreadiu,; "slander"
 about the clash, the Chinese statement was far milder
 than China's last official protest over an armed border clash, in 1967.
 At that time a series of Chinese Foreign Ministry statements in
 September and October had scathingly labeled the Indians "aggressors,"
 denounced the "reactionary Indian government" for its alleged hypocrisy
 in calling for a peaceful border settlement and normalization of
 relations with China, and accused New Delhi of working closely with the
 United States and the USSR to foster anti-China opinion in the world.
 In contrast to Peking's usual stress in the past on China's military
 preparedness in the face of further Indian "provocations," this
 current statement concluded by giving unusual emphasis to Peking's
 repeated measures to maintain the border status quo, avoid armed
 conflict, and "preserve peace" pending a final settlement of the
 frontier issue.

 MOSCOW TREATMENT     Since 1 November TASS has favorably replayed
 reports of the Indian protest.  On 3 November
 TASS carried Indian press comment condemning the Chinese action as
 an affront to India's expressed desire for normal Sino-Chinese
 relations and as the latest evidence of "the great power, hegemonistic
 policy of the Chinese leaders" in South Asia.  A 3 November Moscow
 radio commentary in English to South Asia--the first monitored
 Soviet comment on the border clash--similarly blasted the Chinese
 response as "another important link" in Peking's "chain of anti-
 Indian actions," which Moscow said included interference in the
 Kashmir and Sikkim issues and support for subversion and insurrection
 in northeastern India.

 PYONGYANG OBSCURES UN VOTES ON CONFLICTING RESOLUTIONS
 The North Korean media have obscured the fact that on 29 October
 the UN General Assembly's First Committee, in an unprecedented
 move, adopted two opposing draft resolutions on the Korean
 question, both of which will now be referred to the UN General
 Assembly.  Pyongyang acknowledged only the passage of the pro-
 Pyongyang draft, by a 51-38 vote, which it described as an
 "overwhelming majority" and a "great victory" for the DPRK.
 Pyongyang has failed to acknowledge that the U.S.-sponsored draft
 also passed the First Committee, by a 59-51 vote, and that the
 General Assembly now must deal with the conflicting draft
 resolutions.   By contrast, both Peking and Moscow media have
 acknowledged that the two resolutions will now be considered by
 the UNGA.
 North Korean media hzve sought to make it appear that the
 Assembly actually had already adopted the pro-Pyongyang draft,
 and have called on the United States to implement that resolution--
 which calls for dissolution of the TTN Command, withdrawal from
 South Korea of foreign troops under the UN flag, and conclusion
 of a peace treaty between the "real parties"* to the Korean
 armistice agreement.
 DPRK GOVERNMENT      DPRK comment on the UN debate thus far
 STATEMENT ISSUED   suggests that Pyongyang considers the Fist
 C'.im'ittee passage of the pro-DPRK draft an
 important propaganda victory no matter what the General Assembly
 might finally do.  A 31 October DPRK Government statement hailing
 the vote called it a "telling blow" at the United States and a
 "turning point" in the history of the United Nations, representing
 a breakdown of the U.S. "hand-raising machine" which in the past
 had passed "illegal" resolutions on the Korean question.  Asserting
 that this is the first time the United Nations 1.tad adopted a
 "fair resolution" on the Korean issue, the government statement
 argued that Washington was under an "coligation" to implement that
 Pyongyang-backed resolution because the basis for the U.S. troop
 presence in South Korea--UN sanction--has now been undercut.  A
 31 October NODONG SINMUN editorial on the First Committee's vote
 made a similar case.
 *  In a 17 August 1975 DPRK Foreign Ministry memorand;:.m; Pyongyang
 specified that "real parties" means the DPRK and the United States.
 That memorandum is discussed in the TRENDS of 20 August 1975,

 OTHER COMMENT     Pyongyang has claimed over the past year that,
 Washington's protests notwithstanding, U.S.
 troops are in South Korea under UN auspices and not, as the United
 States claims, under the terms of the 1953 U.S.-ROK defense treaty.
 Pyongyang contends that passage of the resolution calling for
 withdrawal of foreign troops under the UN flag has removed any
 alleged legal basis for the presence of U.S. troops in the South.
 The 31 October government statement made no reference to the U.S.
 claim linking U.S. troops in South Korea to the defense treaty,
 but the NODONG SINMUN editorial stated, in standard Pyongyang
 terms, that the United States could not justify its troops'
 presence with "such rubbish" as the defense treaty, which had
 been "cooked up illegally."
 Glossing over the passage of the U.S.-sponsored draft resolution,
 the government statement claimed that the success of the Pyongyang-
 backed draft had rendered the U.S. proposal "meaningless and
 useless."  The NODONG SINMUN editorial went even further, claiming
 not only that the current U.S. draft has been "buried" as a "piece
 of scrap paper," but also that all the United Nations' past
 "illegal" resolutions justifying the U.S. troop presence in
 South Korea are now "null and void."
 The only known North Korean acknowledgement--carried by the Peking
 media--that the U.S.-sponsored draft resolution on Korea had also
 been passed by the First Committee, in a UN speech on the 29th
 by DPRK delegate Yi Chong-mok which called that adoption "unjusti-
 fiable" and claimed that the Korean delegation would never recognize
 it, was excised from the 1 November Pyongyang KCNA version of Yi's
 speech.  This passage was, however, reported by Peking's NCNA in
 a 30 October dispatch.
 Neither the government statement nor the available KCNA summary
 of the NODONG SINMUN editorial included detailed objections to th=
 U.S. resolution that Pyongyang had previously set forth in an
 11 August government statement and 17 August foreign ministry
 memorandum.*  The summarized editorial noted only that the U.S.
 draft would create "obstacles" to settlement of the Korean question,
 declaring that because the pro-Pyongyang draft had been passed, the
 United States "must accept the unanimous demand of the majority
 of the world's countries" and implement the DPRK resolution.
 * The 11 August government statement is discussed in the TRENDS
 of 13 August 1975, pages 1-2.

 PEKING HANDLING        As last year, Peking issued an authoritative
 OF UN RESOLUTIONS     PEOPLE'S DAILY Con.entator's article oa
 2 November following the First Committee's
 vote.   Commentator endorsed the 31 Octoh-r DPRK Government statement
 and claimed that implementation of the pro-Pyongyang draft would
 improve the situation on the Korean peninsula.  However, Commentator
 did not suggest that the United States was now actually obligated
 to implement the resolution.  Less harsh in its portrayal of the
 U.S. presence in Korea than a 21 October speech by PRC UN delegate
 Huang Hua, the Commentator article did not renew charges that the
 U.S. presence was a threat to the North's security or that U.S.
 troops had carried out "armed provocations" against the DPRK.  It
 did charge that the "long stay" of U.S. "aggressor troopd'in the
 South was the basic cause of tension in Korea, and that the UN
 Command is a "U.S. tool of aggression."
 Arguing against the U.S. draft resolution, Commentator called the
 U.S. proposal for "alternative arrangements" to the UN Command
 an "obstacle" and said that the U.S. draft would "deepen the
 division" and "sharpen tension" in Korea.   Commentator did not
 repeat the claim--included in Huang Hua's 21 October speech and
 PRC Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua's 26 September address to the
 General Assembly--that the U.S. draft was "absolutely unacceptable."
 A 31 October NCNA report on the UN Korean debate claimed that
 before it took place, the United States amended its draft resolution
 "for fear that its cloven hoof would be revealed" and that it
 "played tricks" in order to have its draft adopted.  Describing
 the debate as "hotter" than at the previous two General Assembly
 sessions, NCNA noted that the U.S. draft was adopted after "pains-
 taking efforts."  NCNA also added to Peking's polemics against
 the Soviet Union's stand on the Korean question, charging that the
 Soviet UN representative had attempted to justify and provide "cover"
 for U.S. "aggression" against Korea.  NCNA reiterated its recent
 charges that Moscow's altered rendering of the DPRK slogan for
 "independent and peaceful" reunification as "peaceful and
 democratic" reunification showed Moscow's perfidy.   It claimed
 that the Seoul government also backs "democratic" but not "inde-
 pendent" reunification, and that,thus the Soviet representative
 saw "eye-to-eye" with the "puppet clique."
 MOSCOW TREATMENT     Moscow has noted the results of the UN voting
 OF KOREAN ISSUE     in several TASS reports and commented
 authoritatively on it in a 5 November PRAVDA
 article devoted to the October Revolution anniversary, so far
 available only in an abreviated TASS version.  A Moscow radio
 broadcast to Korea on the 4th claimed that as a result of the vote
 in the First Committee the United States had "lost its token right

 to station troops in South Korea under the guise of the UN flag."
 The commentary also contained Moscow's first c'irect response to
 recent Peking attacks on the Soviet stand ou:;orea, charging that
 the PRC UN representative had attempted to "obsLure" the Soviet
 position, and that such an attempt by Peking "only serves the
 purpose of dividing the ranks of people who expect to Gee the
 peaceful unification of Korea."
 Moscow's last substantial media comment on the UN Korean debate
 was a 24 October IZVESTIYA commentary.   IZVESTIYA noted that
 withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and cessation of
 military confrontation on the peninsula would accord with the
 interests of the peoples of "both Korean states."  The commentary
 went on to cite Soviet UN delegate Malik's remarks that adoption
 of the pro-DPRK, Soviet-cosponsored resolution by the General
 Assembly would promote "normalization" of the situation in Korea
 and create favorable conditions for reunification, but offered
 no other support for the resolution.  IZVESTIYA offered support
 for the DPRK's "big, constructive program," which it described
 as a propusal for a confederation of the "two states," and the
 setting up of the North-South Coordination Committee that has
 "embarked on a dialog in which points of contacts are being sought."
 This upbeat assessment of the North-South dialog contrasts with
 Pyongyang's current line, which is that the dialog is on the
 "brink of runture" due to the Pak regime's "sabotage."  IZVESTIYA
 did not mention the U.S. draft resolution on Korea.

 CAMBODIA-THAILAND
 IENG SARY BANGKOK VISIT RESTORES DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
 The 28 October-1 November visit to Thailand by Cambodian Deputy
 Prime Minister Ieng Sary has been capped by the announcement that
 diplomatic relations have been restored.   The announcement came In
 the 31 October communique on the visit--th_ first to a noncommunist
 Southeast Asian country by a leader of tny_ new Cambodian regime.
 Cambodian pronouncements during the visit avoided contentious issues
 in 'T'hai-Cambodian relations, unlike Vietnam and Laos, which have
 continued harsh criticism of Bangkok politics.*
 The joint communique cited "traditional links and similarities"
 between the Thai and Cambodian peoples,  the two nations' "deep
 sense of neightLrliness" arising from their geographical proximity,
 and the "common aspirations" of the two nations to maintain peaceful
 relations as  he basij for normalizing relations.   However, the
 communique aid not state when relations would be fully normalized,
 noting that an exchange of ambassadors would occur only "at a date
 convenient to both countries depending on the conditions prevailing."
 It included pledges to respect each other's territorial integrity,
 to resolve issues retween them without resort to force, and to
 prohibit "the use of its t r..:ritory by any third country in any form."
 The communique also noted that "the political, economic and social
 system" of each country is "solely the affair of the people of that
 country" and that "external interference will not be tolerated."
 The communique stated that the two sides discussed economic and trade
 cooperation, but added that "the *:rins and the modality of trade"
 between the two countries would be discussed at a later date.  Bangkok
 radio broadcasts on 1 November reported that Thai Foreign Minister
 Chatchai had stated that temporary liaison offices would be established
 by each side--the Thai office in Aranyaprathet, and the Cambodian
 office in Poipet--to handle immigration and trade affairs until
 permanent embassies are opened in Bangkok and Phnom Penh, and that
 rail links between Aranyaprathet and Poipet will be reopened.

 PORTUGAL
 MOSCOW CITES RIGHTIST DANGERS. SEES GOVERNMENT IN COMMAND
 Soviet coverage of Po-:tugucse developments continues to stress the
 need for "unity of progressive forces" and vigilance against a
 possible move by reactionaries.   Generally, the Soviet reaction
 to re'-urrent rumors of a planned "rightist coup" has been less
 strident and vocal than last summer--some observers portraying
 the Portuguese army as alert and last summer's "counterrevolutionary
 drive" as halted.  However, some Moscow commentators, referring
 to the imminent 11 November date when Portugal is scheduled to
 grant independence to her lastmajor colony, Angola, have suggested
 there are right:wing plans to thwart the revolutionary process in
 Portugal while at the same time preventing the transfer of power
 to the Soviet-backed Popular Movement for the Liberation of
 Angola (MPLA), which maintains control of Luanda.
 TASS correspondent Mikhail Artyushenkov or. 1 November reported the
 arrest of two fugitive rightwing leaders in northern Portugal
 (TASS called the two "a group of counterrevolutionaries"), tying
 this event to rumors of a forthcoming coup.   Artyushenkov noted
 that "counterrevolutionaries are trying to coordinate their actions
 in Portugal and Angola," and, in keeping with Moscow's tendency
 to equate actions against the MPLA as threats against the whole of
 Angola, he scored former members of Salazar's secret police who
 were said to have arrived secretly in Luanda "to organize subversive
 activities against the MPLA."  Drawing on Portuguese sources with
 similar views, TASS on 29 October implied that all Portuguese
 progressives favored the MPLA and reported that Admiral Rosa Coutinho
 had "demanded",that "all power in Angola be handed over to  the
 MPLA" on 11 November.  PRAVDA on the 27th also quoted PCP'leader
 Alvaro Cunhal's r'ference to the MPLA as "the genuine, legitimate
 representative of the Angolan people" and cited the PCP's charge
 that "imperialist forces" were attempting to prevent Portugal's
 transfer of power to the MPLA.
 While such Soviet coverage reflects concern about the plans of
 "rightist forces" in Lisbon and Luanda, Moscow's reaction is generally
 low-key and, occasionally, optimistic.  Thus, a long article by
 PRAVDA's Lisbon correspondent B. Kotov on 25 October stressed PCP
 confidence that "revolutionary forces are taking the initiative" and
 indicated that last summer's "real danger of an abrupt shift to
 the right" was now on the wane.  Another Kotov dispatch, published
 in PRAVDA the following day, reported that the Portuguese army
 was in a state of readiness because of reports of "planned sabotage

 by extreme rightwing groups," and that, as a result of such
 measures, "the situation in the country today is absolutely
 calm."  Moscow's handling of the coup rumors accords with
 the usually cautious treatment given the government of Prime
 Minister. Azevedo, whom Moscow does not criticize directly and,
 on infrequent occasions, portrays favorably.  A 23 October
 KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA dispatch by correspondents Khuzemi and
 Artyushenkov, for example, noted that Azevedo's government had
 "adopted a number of important measures" and that "the attacks
 of counterrevolution have been halted."
 CEAUSESCU ENDORSES MODERATE TACTICS BY "DEMOCRATIC" PARTIES
 During a 28-31 October visit to Portugal, Romanian leader Ceausescu
 cautioned local political forces that failure to subordinate their
 differences endangers Portugal's national independence.  Although
 Ceausescu's criticism of traditional Western political concepts
 accords with standard Soviet doctrine, his stress on the importance
 of unity and independence seems to have reference to Romania as
 well as Portugal.
 Ceausescu's allusions to foreign interference in Portugal's domestic
 affairs appeared to be directed primarily toward dangers from the
 right, as in a 29 October toast to Premier Azevedo when he asserted
 that "everything that is undertaken must prevent a return  to  the
 past."  Similarly, in stressing the need for political unity, he
 twice raisec: :he Spector of Portugal repeating the Chilean experience.
 Ceausescu combined his expressed fears of the right with unusually
 frank ..riticism of Western concepts of government.  Thus, in his
 toast to Azevedo he disparaged Western-style democracy for allegedly
 promoting economic inequalities and rejected political pluralism
 as "not essential" because "you can have a single party and a very
 good democracy."
 Ceausescu allowed, however, that for the foreseeable future Portugal
 must be represented by a broad spectrum of "progressive and democratic
 forces."  Thus, in his 29 October toast, he asserted that "there is
 no other way for Portugal but cooperation among Communists, Socialists
 and other political forces, :'.n close connection with the army" in border
 to promote the unity of various forces including "that part of the
 bourgeoisie which wants to serve the fatherland."  This is a position
 that might be disputed by militant communists, but it is one that
 is shared by the more moderate.

 His apparent effort to equate the dangers facing both Portugal
 and Romania was particularly evident during a press conference
 on the final day of his visit in which he asserted that it is
 both "natural and necessary" that Portugal develop its relations
 with the socialist countries, adding that it is also expected
 that Lisbon will continue to develop its relations with the
 developing and developed capitalist states.  He went on to explain
 that Portugal's increased ties with the socialist bloc cannot
 be interpreted as "counter" or "harmful" to the other Western
 countries or the United States since the "development of any
 independent state" can only promote international peace and
 understanding.  Thus, he pointedly referred to Romania's "very
 sound relations" with all western countries--including the United
 States--as well as all developing and socialist countries, a
 situation which he described as "not detrimental to anyone."

 USSR
 SUSLOV ASSOCIATE ATTACKS RUSSOPHILE IN KOWUNIST ARTICLE
 An article in the September issue of KOMMUNIST, No. 14, assailing
 well-known Russophile writer Oleg Mikhaylov for writing a 1974
 book extolling pre-revolutionary traditions constitutes the most
 serious attack on the Russophile movement in recent years.  Its
 author is the venerable ultraconp.rvative ideologist V.P. Stepanov,
 who is a member of KOMMUNIST's aditorial board and has been
 associated with Suslov.
 The Russophile movement, which burgeoned during the 1960's,
 represents a strongly conservative trend which has disturbed
 orthodox communist conservatives by overstressing the traditional
 nationalistic Russian values at the expense of new communist
 lnternationalistic and proletarian values.  The trend was censured
 by Agitprop in the late 1960's, but remains strong among conser-
 vative communists, making it difficult for ideologists like
 Stepanov and Suslov to move against it decisively.  The last
 serious attack on Russophilism, made by a Suslov subordinate in
 late 1972, backfired and resulted in the dismissal of the critic.
 Since then, attacks have been relatively rare; hence such an
 attack in the leading party journal by a prominent conservative
 ideologist is all the more striking.
 Mikhaylov's book, "Faithfulness," calls on the younger generation
 to be faithful to the "traditions of the classics," to patriotism
 and "the national pride of the Russian people," according to
 Stepanov.  Pointing out that national traditions included  not
 only progressive but also conservative and even reactionary
 components, Stepanov insisted that "when we speak of the Motherland,
 we alwa""s rightly stress our Soviet socialist Motherland." He
 censured Mikhaylov for lauding the humanism of Tolstoy, Dostoyevskiy
 and Bunin.  Stepanov conceded that Russians are rightly proud of
 these great writers but argued that their ideas cannot be accepted
 by communists.
 The 70-year old Stepanov rose under Stalin and has long been a
 spokesman for hardline views.  He appears to have had ties with
 Suslov for many years.  He became chief editor of the Central
 Committee's cultural paper CULTURE AND LIFE in 1949, after
 ideological supervisor Zhdanov had died and young Central Committee
 Secretary Suslov had taken over supervision of ideology.  He later
 was deputy head of Agitprop, deputy chief editor of PF'AVDA, and
 from 1962-65 chief editor of KOMMUNIST.  In the latter post, he
 created a stir with his 17 May 1965 PRAVDA article attacking

 Khrushchev's pragmatism and defending the importance of ideology.
 He apparently fell into disfavor in late 1965 and was demoted
 merely to membership of the board of KOMMUNIST and was not reelected
 a Central Committee candidate member in 1966.        Although he has
 never been publicly identified as an assistant to Suslov, his tie
 to Suslov was revealed when he edited the collection of Suslov
 speeches published in 1972.  All the collections of speeches of
 Brezhnev and Kosygin published in recent years have been edited
 by men publicly identified as their assistants.
 The main high-level attack on Russophiles in recent years was a
 late 1972 LITERARY GAZETTE article by A.N. Yakovlev, a first
 deputy head of Agitprop and, thus, a subordinate of Suslov.
 According to rumors circulating in Moscow at the time, the article
 had been endorsed for publication by Suslov himself.  Despite such
 high-level backing, there reportedly was a sharp behind-the-scenes
 reaction, resulting in Yakovlev's dismissal and appointment as
 ambassador to Canada in early 1973.
 ADDENDUM
 The article on the October 1975 CPSU slogans carried in the TRENDS
 of 16 October 1975, page 23, failed to note that a traditional
 appeal for "further strengthening of our motherland's economic
 and defense might" was dropped from its usual place in a slogan
 addressed to the Soviet workers. These words had appeared in the
 same slogan in each of the semi-annual lists since October 1972.
 Prior to that, Soviet practice regarding the use of the formula
 has varied, and there have been several periods when the appeal
 was not used at all.

 NOTES
 PRC PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP:          A 29 October Canton report on a local
 meeting on learning from the model Tachai brigade in agriculture
 revealed that CCP Politburo member West Kuo-ching has been transferred
 from his pest as party chief in Kwargsl to become first secretary of
 the Kwangtung provincial party committee and chairman of the revolutionary
 committee there.  Wei headed a lengthy list of Kwangtung leaders at the
 meeting including Canton Military Region commander Hsu Shih-yu, and
 Wei delivered the major address at the rally, stressing the need for
 local party committees "to do a good job of all current work with
 autumn harvesting, winter cultivation and agricultural capital
 construction."  Wei replaces Chao Tzu-yang, Lwangtung's party chief
 prior to the cultural revolution, who was reLnstated in his old job
 in 1974.  Chao last apTtared in Peking on 19 October, when he and
 several other provincial leaders attended the closing session of the
 national conference on learning from Tachai.  Chao had appeared
 regularly in Kwangtung during the past several months, and there is no
 evidence that he is under political attack.  Wei's move to Kwangtung,
 which has created a vacancy in Kwangsi, may be part of a larger transfer
 plan designed to fight provincialism and strengthen central party
 control.  The last transfer of a provincial party boss took place in
 December 1973, as part of Peking's massive rotation of all military
 region commanders who were also provincial party chiefs, a device used
 to strip military leaders of their civil posts and put more provincial
 party committees under the direct control of civilian leaders.
 PEKING ON USSR-ANGOLA:  A 5 November Peking PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator
 article has authoritatively lambasted recent Soviet messages on
 the Angolan issue.  The Tiessages have not been publicized by the
 Soviet media, but according to African reports they were addressed
 to Zaire officials and the head of the Organization of African Unity
 (OAU).  The Commentator article attacked Moscow for allegedly
 planning to recognize Angolan independence under "a single libera-
 tion movement."  Commentator called the messages "an ominous
 indication" of Moscow's "further intervention and aggression in
 Angola," a "wanton slander, threat, and intimidation" against Zaire,
 and a "threat" to the entire OAU.  Commentator "strongly condemned"
 the USSR in the name of the Chinese people, and "resolutely backed"
 the OAU position, supported by Zaire, calling for unity among the
 three Angolan liberation groups.  Peking's last authoritative comment
 on Angola, another PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article on 19 September,
 had attacked Soviet interference in Angolan affairs but had not
 specifically condemned the Soviet Union in tha name of the Chinese
 people.  Peking has attacked Soviet "interference" in the OAU
 before--most recently in a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on the conclusion
 of the 12th OAU summit conference--but not in reference to Angola.

 Like previous authoritative comment, Commentator did not specify
 which Angolan group the Soviet Union supports exclusively, and
 it repeated Peking's standard line that the "Angolan problem"
 should be solved by Angolans themselves "through consultations"
 and under the guidance of the OAU.  A:Peking in Arabic broadcast
 at 1630 GMT on 2 November briefly reported that "the Chinese
 Government issued a statement" on 31 October calling for an end to
 the fighting among the three competing Angolan liberation groups,
 a halt to foreign interference, and the withdrawal of "mercenaries"
 fighting there.  Inexplicably, this Chinese statement is not
 known to have been carried in other monitored Chinese media.
