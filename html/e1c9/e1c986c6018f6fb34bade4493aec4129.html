 d nothing to the United States.  Why
 itn
 can't we learn from the teachings of our'
 distinguished  colleague  Senator WAYNE
 MORSE, of Oregon? We should realize by now
 that one-way deals with foreign countries
 cannot possibly win the gratitude or pro-
 mote the political stability               out, ththe ose caver-
 tries.  As Mr. Flaherty points
 age, Canadian will only view this tariff deal in
 terms of a $50 million loss in tariff revenues.
 He will still have to pay a high price for
 his automobile while the American automo-
 tive "giants" will accrue larger profits at
 Canadian expense.  And how can Canada, a
 country with a chronic balance-of-payments
 problem, afford this added drain on their
 dollar reserves?  I tell you we have had
 enough of these one-sided errors in our for-
 eign aid policy.
 And finally, how can our Government rec-
 oncile itself to the fact that it imposes strict
 "voluntary" restrictions on the fight of capi-
 tal to foreign countries and then turns
 around  and  enacts  legislation which  en-
 courages this flight.                  I am sure that I can-

 The Government stands to gain
 more than it loses. ? More business' will lift

 The main reason for the Canada-United
 States auto trade deal on both sides escapes
 notice in the current Canadian political de-
 bate.                                                          It has not escaped notice in the de-
 bates in the Senate at Washington.  There it
 is recognized that the United States is buy-
 ing protection against Canadian restrictions
 on American trade.
 Canada has a tough balance-of-payments
 problem, aggravated by the fact that Cana-
 dians pay out about $70 million for imported
 cars and parts.. Canada is the second biggest
 car market in the world.  Countries that use
 fewer cars, such as Britain, France, and Ger-
 many, see that their own people use home-
 made cars. Canada could do the same.
 The Canadian Government had to reduce.
 its balance-of-payments deficit.   It could
 have imposed restrictions, forcing Canadians
 to use more Canadian cars by higher tariffs
 or Import quotas.  This would have raised
 prices and restricted the range of choice of
 Canadian car users.   It would also have
 closed out a big market for American cars
 and parts,

 projects, public buildings, highways, refor-
 estation, dams, sewers, hospitals, audito-
 riums, national parks, harbors, histories, art
 projects, most. of which were built, made
 payrolls possible, and are being enjoyed
 today.
 There was no time then, as there is now,
 to attack poverty at its roots. `There was
 little or no work for those who wanted work
 and had the training, skill's, and experience
 to perform it.  We had to make jobs and
 do it fast.
 Today's war on poverty is attacking pov-
 erty where it starts.  We are recognizing that
 America's great system of free public edu-
 cation is the most important ingredient in
 her enormous economic growth and power.
 So our 1965 war on poverty is geared to wipe
 out Inherited poverty, by making sure that
 each child has a real educational oppor-
 and by helping those who missed out
 tunity
 ,
 on education to make up the deficiency.
 The new war on poverty is aimed to in-
 spire us all with the will to work and the
 ability to perform useful work.
 Whether it be Head 'Start, the Job Corps,
 Volunteers  in Service to America, or  the
 other valuable programs, they are all aimed
 at helping the individual help himself, not
 at being a mere dole.
 This kind of  battle takes longer.                  The
 fruit of the Head Start program won't begin
 to ripen for 15 or more years.

 let you know that we are proud of you all
 and grateful for all you are doing for the
 United States.  We follow Vietnam develop-

 seen which shows that we Americans can
 beat the Vietcong at their own game.  If this
 dirty war is ever to end, I'm sure it will be
 more beca,14se of actions like yours, than by
 air strikes or naval bombardment.
 I  attend  the  University  of Oregon  in

 that after reading or hearing stories about
 college student and faculty protests against
 American in Vietnam you might appreciate
 hearing some praise for a change.
 Thanks again for what you're doing and
 good luck.

 DEAR MR. AND MRS. O'BRIEN:_ We of the 2d
 Battalion, 7th Marines, are deeply apprecia-
 tive of your letter of August 11.
 I took the liberty of having the letter re-
 produced and distributed to all our outlying
 detachments. We have a few more than 1,500
 men here and we are scattered in outposts
 over 92 million square meters of hills and
 valleys.  Morale is exceptionally high-our
 casualties have been light and mail service is
 regular.
 The reception your letter received was en-
 thusiastic throughout the entire command.
 Comments ranged from, "How about that?"
 to "I told you most college guys were smart.
 Only a few are the beatnik types."
 We are all of the firm conviction out here
 that our job is a necessary one.  While the
 student and faculty protests are irksome and
 somewhat undermine the positive results we
 achieve in the field, we sometimes rationalize
 such behavior with the  question, "Where
 else in the world could they do it except in
 the United States?"
 Needless to say, it makes us all particularly
 proud when someone like you exercises his
 right of free speech in a positive manner:
 Your letter has more than compensated
 for what we've read, and 1,500 U.S. Marines
 send their thanks.
 Most sincerely,
 LEON N. UTTER,
 Lieutenant Colonel, USMC (for the
 men of 2d Battalion, 7th Marines).
 THE ROLE OF TAX POLICY IN THE
 GREAT SOCIETY
 Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed in
 the RECORD an address entitled "The
 Role of Tax Policy in the Great Society,"
 delivered by the Honorable Stanley S.
 Surrey, Assistant Secretary of the Treas-
 ury, at the Financial Analysts Federation
 Conference.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the REC-
 ORD, as follows:
 THE ROLE OF TAX POLICY IN THE
 GREAT SOCIETY
 (Remarks by the Honorable Stanley S. Sur-
 rey, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury,
 at the Financial Analysts Federation Con-
 ference, Washington Hilton Hotel, Wash-
 ington, D.C., Tuesday, October 5, 1965)
 Under President Johnson's leadership, this
 Nation has begun the challenging task of
 building a Great Society.
 Substantial  progress has  been  achieved
 and a sound foundation for the structure
 is being laid.
 The Great Society will rest upon two ma-
 jor supports-national consensus and eco-
 nomic prosperity.
 As the Congress finishes a session which
 is outstanding in our history for its achieve-
 ments and as our economy continues strong
 in  a recordbreaking expansion,  these  two
 supports appear sound indeed.
 Prospects  for  future achievements are
 bright.
 The goals are many, but some stand out.
 Clearly, we must do all in our power to:
 Give the 35 million people who now suffer
 the despair of poverty the opportunity to
 earn a decent life for themselves and it better
 life for their children.
 Give all our children full opportunity to
 educate and equip themselves to take a con-
 structive  part  in  carrying  this  society
 forward.
 Give all Americans the opportunity to ful-
 fill their own best hope of achievement, that
 we may fulfill the promise offered when this
 land was born.
 Make our countryside and our cities more
 beautiful, healthier, safer, and better places
 in which to live and work.
 Meet our commitments, written and un-
 written, throughout the world to those peo-
 ple who look to us in their need for release
 from ignorance, misery, and hunger.
 I would like to conisder what role tax
 policy has to play in achieving the goals of
 this Great Society.
 GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY
 Certainly the Great Society will involve
 Federal expenditures and our tax system
 must raise the funds to meet those expendi-
 tures.                                                                In an earlier day this could mark the
 end of my talk.  But today's knowledge has
 brought us deeper insights.
 The accomplishment of the Great Society
 will require an ever-growing economic base-
 a base adequate to meet the demands which
 that society will place on Federal expendi-
 tures, State and local government expendi-
 tures, and private expenditures.
 In our war on poverty, in our efforts to
 foster education, equal opportunity, health
 and natural beauty, and in our campaign to
 improve urban life, economic prosperity is
 not only essential-it is the most powerful
 weapon we have.
 Government  policies  must  therefore  be
 directed both to achieving              an economic
 growth that matches our potential and to
 enabling us to keep that potential constantly
 expanding.  We must achieve full employ-
 ment and then go on to provide an adequate
 rate of economic growth at full employment.
 The use of fiscal policy in meeting these
 demands is today, as a result of the accom-
 plishments of these last 5 years, far more
 broad and flexible than most had supposed.
 The success of the tax reduction involved
 in the Revenue Act of 1964 has marked the
 turning point.  This tax reduction, though
 it came in a period of deficits, brought the
 larger GNP and larger revenue base that the
 administration and many economists fore-
 saw.  Recognition of this success of the 1964
 act tax reduction was a large factor in the
 speed with which the Excise Tax Reduction
 Act-involving a further $4 billion staged
 reduction-was  enacted  this  year  by  the
 Congress.
 27061
 If We did not have the investment credit
 of 1962, the depreciation reform of 1962-
 which was liberalized early this year-the
 1964 and 1965 individual and corporate in-
 come  tax reductions,  and  the  excise tax
 reduction of 1965, next year the Federal tax
 burden  would  be more  than $20  billion
 heavier than it will now be.
 . That is the reduction in tax liabilities
 measured at a constant income level.  But
 there was no corresponding reduction   in
 actual revenue receipts. As President John-
 son said recently:
 "I am happy to report that even with
 such massive tax reduction, we anticipate
 that Federal revenues for the 5-year period,
 fiscal 1961 to 1966, will have increased by
 over $18 billion-almost twice the increase
 over the previous 5 years when there were
 no tax cuts at all."
 All this has permitted us, I believe-Gov-
 ernment economists and business analysts
 alike-an increasing objectivity in assessing
 the role of Federal budget policy in our
 financial system.  We are no longer ham-
 pered by such rigidities that a budget deficit
 is  always  bad-we  cannot  automatically
 identify the villain by seeing if he writes
 in red ink.
 For we are now aware that adding a group
 of expenditures that differ widely in their
 form-loans, grants, current expenses, capi-
 tal items-and then achieving a zero bal-
 ance when these are subtracted from rev-
 enues in itself can guarantee nothing as to
 the direction the economy will move.  And.
 we are also aware of such things as fiscal
 drag and the power of our revenue system
 yearly to increase its take from the private
 sector of the economy-at present by about
 $7 billion annually-and of the need each
 year to offset that fiscal drag.  That doesn't
 mean that tax reduction is always desirable
 and must occur every year or that it is al-
 ways preferable  to increased expenditures
 and is never to yield to debt retirement.
 Each year will require its own decisions.
 They will depend on our expenditure require-
 ments-in terms of domestic needs and for-
 eign obligations-and on the economic out-
 look-in  terms  of the need  to maximize
 employment and avoid inflation.
 We have balanced these things well in
 moving toward an interim goal of 4 percent
 unemployment.
 This course is not an easy one to pilot.
 Like hidden shoals, we will encounter un-
 expected  developments.  At  times  these
 developments will require rapid temporary
 adjustments in our fiscal policy-such as.
 quick tax cuts.
 It would be beneficial, now that the effects.
 of tax reduction on the economy are better
 understood, to reach a consensus on the
 form that a temporary tax change should
 take so that we thereby would be able, with
 that consensus in hand, to achieve a speedy
 enactment if a temporary reduction were
 ever needed.  An appropriate congressional
 hearing held now for this purpose, before
 the need ever arises, would be useful in
 reaching such consensus.
 I have talked so far in aggregate terms,
 and in these terms tax reduction has mainly
 meant a broad attack on inadequate private
 expenditures and investment incentives.  In
 the Revenue Act of 1964, and in the recent
 Excise Tax Reduction Act, we provided a'
 substantial stimulus to consumer demand
 which serves, of course, to provide the mar-
 ket to induce and support our remarkable
 increase in business investment.  We have
 also reduced corporate tax rates, and pro-
 vided the special measures of an investment
 credit and the depreciation guidelines.  To-
 gether these business  tax measures have
 meant an increased cash flow and consider-
 'ably higher after-tax rates of return.
 In the Treasury we have begun an inten-
 sive study of the investment experience in

 the past few years to isolate if we can the
 impact of depreciation reform and the -in-
 vestment credit.  We are trying to learn
 more about our depreciation system., the
 guidelines and the reserve ratio test through
 a complex computer study of the effects of
 varying depreciation rates and lives against
 the manifold patterns of asset holdings,
 replacements  and  retirements  that  our
 businesses present.
 At the same time, through trips abroad by
 our experts, we are bringing up-to-date our
 knowledge of the handling of depreciation
 under the tax systems of other countries, so
 that we can consider the comparative posi-
 tion of the U.S. approach.
 Finally, in the area of business taxation
 we are aware of the need for more research
 regarding the appropriate relationship be-
 tween the corporate tax and the individual
 income tax. But a look at the recent foreign
 changes illustrates the complexities involved
 in. this relationship, and the need to define
 the goals before coming to any conclusion
 about whether a change is either necessary
 or appropriate.
 The U.S. approach is basically that of a
 corporate tax separated from the individual
 tax, with no adjustment (apart from the
 $100 dividend exclusion) for the possibility
 that corporate profits may be taxed at two
 levels, once as profits to the corporation and
 once as dividends to individuals.  I call this
 a possibility in view of the considerable un-
 certainty about whether the corporate tax is
 shifted.
 However, many economists have favored
 tile so-called British approach, under which
 the two taxes are integrated through the
 shareholder getting a credit at his level for
 the corporate tax, and with his dividend
 grossed up to reflect corporate profits before
 the corporate tax.  Some would even go
 further and apply this credit and grossed-
 up inclusion in shareholder income auto-
 matically, without the need for a actual
 distribution by the corporation.  But the
 British this year abandoned their approach
 in favor' of the U.S. approach, though with
 a lower corporate rate, probably 40 percent.
 Meanwhile the French, who previously had
 the U.S. approach, shifted this year halfway
 to the former British approach, by giving
 the shareholder on the gross-up approach a
 credit for one-half of the corporate tax.
 Both the British and the French did not
 follow the German technique, which grants
 the corporation a much lower corporate rate
 (IS percent as against 51 percent) on the
 corporate profits that are distributed to the
 shareholders.
 The Canadians, who now use a very rough
 version of the former British approach-they
 give the shareholder a credit of 20 percent
 of the dividend without any grossing up of
 the dividend-are, through their Royal Com-
 mission, studying whether they should con-
 sider a change.
 The key to all these different approaches-
 bewildering as they are in their variety and
 susceptibility to change-is probably that
 the changes are designed to achieve different
 goals.
 The British desire to encourage more cor-
 porate investment and hope their change will
 achieve that by favoring the retention of
 corporate profits over their distribution. The
 French appear to desire a greater share-
 holder participation by,their investors, and
 hence have focused on inducements to the
 distribution of dividends--a factor which
 underlies the German approach though with
 a different technique.
 Here in the United States we have stressed
 corporate investment  witness the invest-
 ment credit-and hence adequate corporate
 cash flow and after-tax rate of return.  We
 have recognized that we already possess
 through bur developed capital markets and
 other institutional factors strong forces In
 the direction of shareholder participation.
 Hence our present needs exert a strong pres-
 sure for retention of the status quo in the
 structure of corporate taxation-still leaving
 room for rate reduction at an appropriate
 time.
 The British have also recognized the re-
 lationship between these corporate patterns
 and the capital gains tax.  Thus, along with
 their move to strengthen corporate reten-
 tion of profits they have adopted a capital
 gains tax on the American model, but with
 inclusion of one-half of the gain, a maximum
 30-percent rate, a 1-year holding period for
 long-term gains (3 years in the case of real
 estate), taxation at death of unrealized ap-
 preciation in value, and with corporate gains
 subject to tax at regular rates.
 ELIMINATION OF POVERTY
 Probably the most important goal of the
 Groat Society is the elimination of poverty.
 This is an extraordinarily complex problem
 and we are only now beginning to learn
 about it as we grapple with it.  It is an area
 where the human needs are so compelling
 that they demand the best we have to offer
 in both innovation and ingenuity in devis-
 ing measures-both Government and pri-
 vate-to meet them.
 Our tax system must make a maximum
 contribution to this effort.
 The 1964 act lessened the tax burden in
 this area-with its reduction of the starting
 rate from 20 to 14 percent and with the
 adoption  of the  minimum  standard  de-
 duction, so that a single individual became
 taxable at $900 instead of $668, a married
 couple at $1,600 instead of $1,333, and a
 married couple with two children at $3,000
 instead of $2,667. Moreover, the Excise Tax
 Reduction Act of 1965, by eliminating many
 Federal excise taxes, further reduced the
 burden of Federal taxes on this group.
 Looking at our system as it now stands,
 the, poor pay primarily, as Federal taxes, the
 excises on alcohol and tobacco and the in-
 come tax where poverty levels may be above
 the present dividing line between taxable
 and nontaxable income.  They also pay the
 gasoline tax, which is a user charge asso-
 ciated with the highway trust fund, and the
 social. security and medicare payroll taxes,
 which involve a saving for pensions and
 medical care.  In looking at the tax struc-
 ture, it is clear that the income tax impact
 deserves our first attention, and the Presi-
 dent has said that any future Income tax
 reduction should cover those who live in
 the shadow of poverty.  This suggests at`
 least a change which raises to a higher level
 of income the dividing line between taxable
 and nontaxable Income.
 This  Nation  cannot. . afford  to  continue
 indefinitely to tax people who cannot afford
 to pay.
 As incomes increased in past years for
 the population as a whole, the nature of
 our tax structure over those years-relatively
 fixed rates and exemption levels-increased
 the tax burden on lower income taxpayers,
 as they moved from a nontaxable status to
 a taxable status, from the lowest bracket rate
 to a higher rate.
 Even our massive income tax reduction in
 the last 2 years has only set this process
 back about 5 years.
 And even with such reduction, over the
 past 15 years an examination of effective
 tax rates (the percentage of overall income
 actually paid In tax) shows:
 A family earDID. gg half the national aver-
 age income  ($2,200 in 1950, $4,000 today)
 went from an effective tax rate of zero to
 almost 4 perent;
 A family earning the national average in-
 come went from an effective tax rate of 61/Z
 to 9 percent;
 A family earning double the national aver-
 age income stayed roughly the same;
 Higher income families either held their
 own or realized reductions, often' ubsta2i-
 tial, in their effective tax rates as in,*eased
 incomes were offset by increased deductions
 or a greater proportion of capital gains.
 Indeed, the spread of effective tax rates is
 greatest for higher income taxpayers, varying
 from zero to around 66 percent. Correspond-
 ingly, the average effective rate for very
 high income taxpayers is much lower than
 is generally realized.  For instance, all tax-
 payers who in 1962 reported adjusted gross
 incomes of more than $1 million would-at
 present tax table rates-pay an average effec-
 tive rate of only 26 percent of their overall
 income  (including capital gain income in
 full).  Furthermore, only 9 percent of those
 taxpayers would have effective rates of over
 50 percent on overall income under present
 tax table rates.
 All     this  reinforces  President  Johnson's
 view that the next tax reduction should focus
 on the lower income groups.
 We are constantly gaining more knowledge
 of the weapons with which to carry out our
 war on poverty.     Some of the approaches are
 associated with the sheer alleviation of des-
 titution, through providing funds directly.
 Others involve programs of income mainte-
 nance to counteract the forces which can
 undercut a person's income.  Others look to
 programs of education, relocation, training
 and the like to help people raise themselves
 and their children out of poverty, and to
 provide employment for those who are em-
 ployable.  As we gain this 'knowledge we
 will be in a better position to judge the
 contribution which a tax system can make
 in this effort.
 TAX EQUITY AND TAX SIMPLIFICATION
 A nation that seeks improvement in its
 society is likely to insist on the improvement
 of that aspect of Government which exerts a
 widespread and significant effect on that so-
 ciety-the Federal tax system itself.  The
 tax activity of the past few years has in-
 creased  public  interest  in  obtaining the
 fairest and simplest tax system possible.
 Tax equity is a complex matter. Two per-
 sons may have the same amount of income-
 wages, net business income, net investment
 income, capital gains--but the income tax on
 one may be far higher than on the other.
 The variance comes about because the in-
 come tax has differing treatments for various
 types of income and for various types of
 family expenditures, primarily those involv-
 ing personal expenses.  Thus, for example,
 on the income side, capital gains are taxed
 at lower rates; on the expenditure side, de-
 ductions are allowed for charitable contribu-
 tions, personal interest, State and local taxes,
 medical expenses, and so on.
 The difficulty in all this lies in deciding
 which differences in income source and ex-
 penditures should be significant for income
 tax purposes.  While economists may, as a
 whole, agree that the significant differences
 are few, the Congress has taken a much
 broader approach. It has shaped our present
 income tax structure by giving recognition
 to a wide variety of these differences.  And
 yet there is constant change.  Thus, in re-
 cent years Congress has said that moving ex-
 penses involve an expenditure difference to
 be recognized under the income tax, and has
 increased the effect given to child-care ex-
 penses.  But through restrictions on deduc-
 tions  for  certain  State  and  local  taxes,
 casualty losses and entertainment expenses,
 the significance of these expenditures was
 lessened. Through elimination of the divi-
 dend credit,,the significance of receiving cur-
 rent  investment   income  from  stocks    as
 against  employment  income  was almost
 eliminated. Through Inclusion of certain
 group term life insurance, the significance
 of this difference in the composition of em-
 ployment  Income  was  lessened,          Through
 the adoption of averaging, the significance

 AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE
 AIDS IN GOOD INVESTMENT
 Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, the
 American Enterprise Institute of Wash-
 ington, D.C., has just published its hand-
 book for the current national intercol-
 legiate debates entitled "Crime and Law
 Enforcement."
 Most of us in the Senate share a great
 concern that the crime problem has be-
 come one of our Nation's most serious
 and pressing domestic concerns. I have
 already expressed my deep belief 'that the
 .alarming rapid rise in crime demands
 that we mobilize all the Nation's re-
 sources to combat this scourge on every
 front. It is, therefore, timely and appro-
 priate that the sponsors of the national
 intercollegiate debates have selected as
 the topic to be argued by the young men
 and women of our universities and col-
 leges this year the proposition, "Re-
 solved: That Law Enforcement Agencies
 Should Be Given Greater Freedom in the
 Investigation and Prosecution of Crime."
 The AEI debate handbook is designed
 to serve as a guide to start the student's
 research but, more importantly, it is in-
 tended to stimulate the individual to
 explore and consider all the varied impli-
 cations connected with the critical ques-
 tion of crime and law enforcement. Such
 encouragement of thoughtful consid-
 eration of today's major public policy
 issues by our young people does much
 to create an informed and interested
 generation, essential for the future wel-
 fare of our Nation.
 The handbook is another example of
 AEI's public service of the same high
 quality as the legislative analyses series
 which AEI offers to all Members of Con-
 gress to assist us in our study of impor-
 tant legislative issues.
 Over the years I have found the AEI
 legislative analyses to be concise, scrupu-
 lously balanced and factual analyses of
 the significant legislative measures pend-
 ing before us. I know that the analyses
 have been of immeasurable assistance to
 me in my deliberations.  I commend
 AEI on the high standards of scholar-
 ship and objectivity which it has achieved
 in this most worthwhile public service.
 Mr. ALLOTT.  Mr. President, I am
 pleased that Senator HRUsKA has spoken
 of the American Enterprise Institute.
 The publications of this unusual organi-
 zation have been of considerable as-
 sistance to me.  I have found their an-
 alyses to be objective and reliable, which
 is no small achievement when analyzing
 proposed legislation that is almost always
 controversial.
 Last month, AEI sponsored a seminar
 on the balance of payments.  Sixteen
 eminent international economists from
 the United States, England, Switzerland,
 Peru, Brazil, and Canada gave diverse
 opinions on proposals to solve our intri-
 cate, perplexing payments problem.                 The
 Institute will publish the proceedings of
 this seminar.  When this book is issued,
 I am sure we will find another valuable
 contribution from the academic world
 toward the solution of another difficult
 public problem
 27Q39
 But currently Marshal Lin is the most
 discussed,  read,  and  debated individual
 among the Pentagon's top echelon, by the
 State Department's policy planners, and in
 most foreign chancelleries.
 Marshal Lin is vice chairman of the cen-
 tral committee of the Chinese Communist
 Party, vice premier of Communist China,
 and the Minister of National Defense.
 Ile has suddenly grabbed the Washington
 spotlight because some weeks ago, on the
 20th anniversary of the defeat of Japan, he
 delivered an  18,000-word manifesto which
 the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Cyrus R.
 Vance, says is "no ordinary commemorative
 article."
 In fact, Mr. Vance and his colleagues in
 the Pentagon, not to mention some in the
 State Department, in the White House and
 along Embassy Row, consider Marshal Lin's
 political document just about the most im-
 portant thing to come out of Peiping since
 mainland China's  Communist Party boss,
 Mao Tse-tung, advanced his famous thesis:
 "Political power grows out of the barrel of
 a gun."
 thanks to the American Enterprise Insti-
 tute.  AEI has been of considerable as-
 sistance to me and my staff during my
 time in Congress.  Their analyses of
 some of the important legislation we
 have discussed this session have been
 thorough,  factual, and  nonpartisan.
 Their research is a very real contribu-
 tion to good government.
 As a member of the Joint Committee
 on the Organization of the Congress, I
 appreciate the fact that AEI is sponsor-
 ing a task force of 13 political scientists
 who are putting their minds and experi-
 INTENTIONS PROBED
 This Lin Piao document not  only tells
 what Peiping's intentions are in Asia, in Viet-
 nam, toward the United States, but what
 its intentions are on the question of the
 whole expansion of world communism.  It
 is Peiping's "Mein Kampf."  It is Peiping's
 blueprint  for  world  domination  for a
 thousand years.
 The Lin Piao manifesto should, say Mr.
 Vance and others, be "must" reading for all
 those who wonder what the United States
 is doing in Vietnam, who appear to have
 never given any thought to what Peiping
 is doing in Vietnam, what its ambitions are
 in south Asia, in Africa, and Latin America.
 The Pentagon thinks seriously enough of
 Marshal Lin's pontifications to have had its
 No. 2 man, Deputy Secretary Vance, discuss
 it at length the other night before the cream
 of  the  country's  industrial  and military
 leaders.
 In speaking of the Russian revolution and
 the Chinese Communist revolution, Marshal
 Lin says:  "The Russian revolution  began
 with armed uprisings in the cities, and then
 spread to the countryside; while the Chi-
 nese                                                                                                                                      revolution  won  nationwide  victory
 through the encirclement of the cities from
 the rural areas, and the final capture of
 the cities." And then he goes on to assert:
 "The rural areas of the world today are Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America.  The cities of the
 world  are  North  America  and  Western
 Europe."
 His thesis, then, is that just as commu-
 nism in China succeeded by capturing the
 countryside, and then encircling and defeat-
 ing                                                                                                                                 the  cities,   so  the  global Communist
 movement will ultimately succeed first by
 capturing Asia, Africa, and Latin America
 thereby encircling North America and West-
 ern Europe-and then by finally and deci-
 sively defeating the United States and its
 Western allies.
 And where is this to pegin, asks Marshal
 Lin rhetorically?
 It has already begun, he says, in Vietnam.
 Vietnam, he says, is the "focus" of the revo-
 lutionary  movement  against  the  United
 States.   "The seizure of power by armed
 force, the settlement of the issue by war,
 is the central task and the highest form of
 revolution," he continues.
 And he falls back on another famous Mao
 Tse-tung thesis to urge on the Vietcong:
 "The imperialists and all reactionaries are
 paper tigers."
 FIGHTING IN VIETNAM
 Marshal Lin, therefore, does not deplore
 the fighting in Vietnam-he welcomes it.
 What the Communist world needs, he makes
 clear, is more of these "wars of national
 liberation"-"people's wars launched In dif-
 ferent parts of the world."

 which Congress might be strengthened

 men and women from the academic world
 to our society have been of great worth,
 in the past, and I am sure that this
 study will be most helpful to the Orga-
 nization Committee. .
 Mr. MONTOYA.  The American En-
 terprise Institute inaugurated this ses-
 sion a new publication that I find an
 excellent timesaver. It is the new press
 summary.  I am sure there is not a
 Senator present who has the time to

 would like in order to keep informed on
 varied opinions.
 I have found the AEI press summary
 to be an essential timesaver by provid-
 ing meaningful excerpts from the daily
 press.  This publication has permitted
 me and my staff to keep abreast of the
 thoughts and opinions of our leading
 journalists on the most important stories
 of the day.
 The format of the press summary pro-

 SOUTH VIETNAM-WHY WE ARE
 THERE
 Mr.  SYMINGTON.  Mr. President;
 many people in my State write about
 South Vietnam. The net of their inter-
 est is more explanation as to why we
 are there.
 Nowhere have I seen those reasons
 presented more logically than in a recent
 address by Deputy Secretary of Defense
 Cyrus Vance at the annual dinner of the
 National Security Industrial Association.
 I would hope that all people who are
 interested in preventing a general war,
 and who look forward to a more peace-
 ful world, would read this short address.
 In that connection, I ask unanimous
 consent to have inserted at this point
 in the RECORD an article by Neal Stan-
 ford in the Christian Science Monitor,
 "U.S.  Intrigued,  Peiping  Manifesto
 Studied."
 I also ask that the full text of the ad-
 dress of Secretary Vance be inserted at
 this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 and address were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:

 Finally, we agree with Mao that just as
 there are cities and countryside within na-
 tions, so the world at large-in its current
 uneven rate of technological advance--can
 be viewed as a series of industrialized centers,
 surrounded by a less-developed countryside.
 But we disagree that the historical process
 suggests that the global countryside will
 storm these centers, and put them to the
 torch of Communist insurgency.
 On the contrary, we believe that the his-
 torical process will be precisely the reverse;
 that the industrialized centers-the fortu-
 nate nations of the world-will increasingly
 seek to bring to the countryside-to  the
 poorer nations of the world-the very assist-
 ance and skill that will help these nations
 to close the poverty gap.  And the rich na-
 tions will do this by measures that will share
 talents and resources-by measures that will
 increase the self-confidence and self-reliance
 of  the  poorer  nations   to  achieve  their
 own self-sustaining political and economic
 growth.
 In the United States we issue no global
 manifestos.
 But we do indulge in one dream.         We do
 entertain one grand vision.  We do look to
 one great goal.
 We are dedicated to continuing the dialog
 with the rest of the world that began in an
 obscure hall in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776.
 The men in that hall were revolutionaries.
 The men in that hall did not believe that
 true 'political power can grow out of the
 barrel of a gun.  They believed that true
 political power can grow only out of the
 people  themselves-for  that  is  precisely
 where it is: within each individual human
 being.
 Those  men  did  not    rant  about
 struggle. They said bluntly that all
 are created equal.
 class
 men
 Those men did not theorize about a dic-
 tatorship of the proletariat.  They proposed
 something  far more  explosive  than that.
 They declared that all men had an inalien-
 able right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
 happiness.
 CONGRESS LOSES A HELPING HAND
 Mr. MUND'T.  Mr. President, I note
 from the RECORD of October 20 that Col.
 Ralph E. Vandervort, Jr., will retire from
 the U.S. Army on October 31.
 It is with deep regret that I note this
 action.  For the past 6 years I have con-
 sulted on many occasions with Colonel
 Vandervort on problems dealing with
 the military establishments in South
 Dakota and in my capacity as a member
 of the Defense Department Subcommit-
 tee on Appropriations.  He has always
 been most cooperative and efficient in
 the handling of the problems which I
 have placed in his hands.
 His good services are going to be
 missed by members of the Congress and
 I am sure the Department of Defense is
 going to miss this good emissary which
 represented them on Capitol Hill.  Col-
 onel Vandervort has been a good and
 valued friend and a dedicated public
 servant.  I wish him the best of success
 in his future endeavors.
 THE ADJUTANT GENERAL OF WEST
 VIRGINIA
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.  Mr.
 President, in August 1961, the Senate
 was asked to confirm the appointment
 of the then newly appointed Adjutant
 General of West Virginia, Gene H. Wil-
 liams, in the grade of brigadier general
 as a reserve of the Army.
 Questions were raised within the Sen-
 ate and elsewhere at that time as to the
 qualifications of General Williams for
 the appointment.
 The Senate Armed Services Commit-
 tee, recognizing that the position of
 training of Army National Guard Spe-
 cial Forces units, nationwide.
 Under General Williams' direction, a
 total of 30 armories and armory-related
 structures have been completed, greatly
 increasing the resources available to
 West Virginia Army and Air National
 Guard units in achieving greater readi-
 ness status.
 When President Kennedy found it
 necessary to mobilize forces in response
 to Soviet threats against Berlin, in, 1961,
 one of the major units ordered into Fed-
 eral service was the 150th Armored
 Cavalry Regiment of the West Virginia
 Army National Guard.  The perform-
 ance of this organization throughout its
 year of Federal service reflected credit-
 ably upon the soundness of the support
 and administrative procedures provided
 by General Williams' office during the
 transition period from State to Federal
 status.
 General Williams and his staff suc-
 cessfully administered the return of the
 150th Armored Cavalry from Federal
 to State status, and the necessary re-
 constitution of the regiment following
 discharge of men whose term of service
 had expired. Today, the 150th Armored
 Cavalry has returned to, and exceeded
 the level of readiness that it held at
 the time of its mobilization.
 Most significant of all, General Wil-
 liams recognized early the importance of
 providing extensive and realistic train-
 ing areas for the special forces units
 then being expanded to cope with guer-
 rilla and counterguerrilla warfare.
 Thanks to his initiative, a State special
 forces camp, with access to some 600
 square miles of ideal training areas is
 now nearing completion after 4 years of
 active planning and supervision by Gen-
 eral Williams personally, and his staff.
 As a result of this outstanding work,
 not only the West Virginia Army Na-
 tional Guard, but the Special Forces of
 the entire Active Army, Army National
 Guard and U.S. Army Reserve
 nation-
 ,
 wide, will be provided with a training
 facility ideally suited to the types of
 terrain in which they possibly may be
 employed.
 In the course of this work, General
 Williams has taken the time to com-
 plete successfully the resident course of
 instruction at the U.S. Army Command

 of the State-administred National Guard
 system in West Virginia, but of the

 which he has thereby justified the faith

 covering the efforts of Senators MURPHY

 provided by the Hatch Act.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

 when they threw the MURPHY-PROUTY  po-
 litical activity amendment into the ash can."
 Other Republican conferees said they were
 shocked by what they called undue inter-
 ference by Macy.
 "The  commission believes," Macy wrote,
 "that it would be unwise to extend the gen-
 eral political activity restrictions of the Hatch
 Act to such a sizable group of persons in
 the private sector of community life."
 "OPENS PANDORA'S  BOX"
 Murphy said Macy's letter and the con-
 ferees' action on the amendment "opened a
 Pandora's box of political chicanery."
 "On top of the supersalaries, supergrades,
 and supersalesmanship that have character-
 ized the poverty program," Murphy said, "we
 now see the administration has stepped in to
 add superpressure.
 "I have always understood the function of
 the Civil Service Commission to be that of
 administering the civil service system and not
 of lobbying or parroting the views of Shriver

 PROGRAM  WORKERS--WANTS  EMPLOYERS TO
 FE COVERED BY HATCH ACT
 (By Mary Pakenham)
 WASHINGTON,  September  4.-Senate Re-
 publicans are massing for a last-ditch at-
 tempt to keep politics out of the program
 covered by the administration's new anti-
 poverty bill.  The Chicago Tribune learned
 today.
 House-Senate conferees agreed Thursday
 night on a $1,785,000,000 final version of the
 authorization bill.  It is expected to come
 to a vote in both chambers this week, un-
 less the Senate forces succeed in having it
 sent back into conference.
 The Democratic majority in the conference
 struck from the bill an amendment extend-
 ing the 1939 Hatch Act to cover federally
 paid employees in the Office of Economic Op-
 portunity's community action and domestic
 Peace Corps programs.
 LETTERS FROM MACY
 The Hatch Act, entitled "an act to prevent
 pernicious political activities," forbids parti-
 san political activity on the part of anyone
 on the public payroll.  Tens of thousands of
 community action programs employees and
 a growing number of domestic Peace Corps
 volunteers would have been affected.
 At the time the conference committee was
 considering the amendment it had before it
 a letter from John W. Macy, Jr., chief of
 t]ze Civil Service Commission and President
 Johnson's personal talent scout, urging that
 Congress allow the antipoverty staff to en-
 gage in politics.
 Ever since the so-called war on poverty
 got under way last November, the political
 potential of workers in these categories has
 been a key target for critics.
 DESIGNED FOR POLITICS
 The letter to President Johnson signed by
 1,800 West Virginia State College students
 in support of U.S. policy in Vietnam was a
 demonstration of civic responsibility which
 brings honor to their school and our State.
 This spontaneous and orderly action by
 the majority is in sharp contrast to those
 staged demonstrations by the few students
 in other schools in other States who were
 duped and manipulated by what J. Edgar
 Hoover terms, "trained agents and provoca-
 teurs of the Communist Party."
 To my knowledge, there have been no such
 staged anti-Vietnam. demonstrations at any
 West Virginia school or college.  Our State
 can be proud of that fact, too.
 I believe in the administration's policy in
 South Vietnam.  I have said this over and
 over again.  We must fight to contain com-
 munism on that line in southeast Asia.  For
 if we do not do it there, we will be fighting
 a war on a broader front and nearer home.
 THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC
 OPPORTUNITY
 Mr,  WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr.
 President, despite the enormous public
 relations efforts of the Office of Economic
 Opportunity, I feel that much of the
 press of our Nation has been very help-
 ful in giving the public an accurate re-
 port on the questionable success of this
 program throughout the country.
 If one were to only listen to Office of
 Economic Opportunity Director Sargent
 Shriver you would think the admin-
 istration's entire poverty program was
 Each such worker is in a position to earn
 the gratitude of large numbers of the poor
 and undereducated, dispensing aid under the
 aegis of the party in power.  That, politicians
 agree, is the stuff good precinct workers are
 made of.
 In many cases, community action programs
 have been specifically designed to organize
 residents of given poverty  areas into po-
 litical pressure groups.
 Complaints already have been heard from
 Mississippi and from cities including Syra-
 cuse, N.Y., that antipoverty workers taking
 part in voter registration drives have failed
 to distinguish between the democratic process
 and the Democratic party.

 CAN OUR EARTH FEED ITS PEOPLE?
 Mr. MONDALE.  Mr. President, 17
 years ago, in 1948, a young member of
 the Walters, Okla., Future Farmers of
 America Chapter won his State's FFA
 oratorical contest with a speech entitled
 "Can Our Earth Feed Its People?"  In
 that speech, the young man pointed out:
 The problem of world food production is
 no temporary crisis, but a permanent world
 problem. * * *   The people of  the world
 can no longer afford poor, wasteful, and de-
 structive agricultural practices if they are
 to survive.
 What a great experience it must have
 been for members of the Future Farmers
 of America attending their national con-
 vention in Kansas City, Mo., Friday, Oc-
 tober 15, to hear that same former FFA
 boy, FRED R. HARRIS,  now the distin-
 guished U.S. Senator from Oklahoma,
 deliver another speech of great signif-
 icance for America and American agri-
 culture.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that both speeches by the distin-
 guished Senator from Oklahoma [Mr.
 HARRIS], his FFA speech in 1948, and his
 most recent address to the national FFA
 Convention, be inserted in the RECORD
 at this point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the speeches
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE         October 21, 1965
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 a  great  newpaper  chain-Scripps-
 Howard-has as its masthead on the edi-
 torial page the slogan:
 Give light and the people will find their
 way.
 This is very true.
 Referring to this slogan leads me to
 denounce a present Defense. Department
 policy and that of top officials of the ex-
 ecutive branch of our Government.  In
 changing the policy heretofore followed
 in  reporting  casualties-dead and
 wounded-in our conflict in Vietnam,
 information is being denied the Ameri-
 can people.         I refer to accurate informa-
 tion to which they are entitled.  I de-
 nounce the present policy of reporting
 light losses or moderate losses.  This is
 as misleading as is the statement re-
 garding some Air Force strike or battle
 and then reporting 128 Vietcong dead or
 some other estimate of Vietcong dead.
 Those of us who served in World War II
 recall reports of the number of enemy
 killed in action and know that some of
 those reports were subject to 90-percent
 discount to give them accuracy.  Ameri-
 can people should be accurately informed
 by official statements issued at least once
 a month informing them of the total
 number of American killed, wounded, and
 taken prisoner in that period.
 Of course, I am not advocating that
 at the end of each battle or airstrike we
 report anything other than that losses
 losses were light or moderate.  Giving
 complete detailed information at that
 time might be of aid to the enemy.  '
 The American people are entitled to
 know the extent of the loss of life in the
 fighting in southeast Asia to which we
 are committed and intend to see through
 to ultimate victory or cease fire or armi-
 stice sustaining the integrity and inde-
 pendence of South Vietnam.  Further-
 more, they can take it, as the saying
 goes.  I am not proposing that following
 each battle or airstrike, when some of
 our planes are shot down or casualties
 incurred, that we immediately disclose
 those casualties at the time.  This might
 give information to the enemy which
 would be to our prejudice.
 . Our President and officials in the De-
 fense Department should however issue
 an accurate news release at the end of
 this month, informing the American peo-
 pie fully as to the total killed in action,
 the total wounded in action, and the total
 taken prisoner during the month of Octo-
 ber.  Then, this policy should be fol-
 lowed each month hereafter.
 I urge this.  I ask that an announce-
 ment that such policy will be followed be
 issued from top officials of the executive
 branch of our Government, and without
 delay.
 TYPICAL SMALL BUSINESS ENTER-
 PRISE IN THE EXPLORATION OF
 INNER SPACE
 Mr. - KUCHEL.  Mr. President, the
 dramatic nature of experiments and ex-
 ploration in the limitless realm of out-
 er space has captivated the American
 people to the point where regrettably
 very limited attention has been given
 equally significant efforts to expand
 knowledge of an area in what might be
 termed "inner space."
 In more prosaic fashion, bold and
 imaginative endeavors have been in prog-
 ress during recent years to unravel se-
 crets of an equally important aspect of
 man's environment, the vast expanse of
 undersea regions of the globe on which
 we exist.  By virtue of the fact that much
 of this effort is technological and at-
 tempted primarily through scientific and
 engineering instruments, the element of,
 suspense and fascination with persever-
 ing and often hazardous exposures of hu-
 man beings has been missing.
 Recently three 'teams of venturesome
 individuals dubbed "aquanauts" com-
 pleted unprecedented research off the
 southern  California  coast  with  an
 oceanographic operation centered on Sea
 Lab II. Over a period of a month, dedi-
 cated personnel ascertained the possibil-
 ity of living and working for prolonged
 periods at considerable depth.  The ef-
 fects of submerged environment were
 measured carefully in a variety of novel
 experiments.
 The desire to obtain first-hand per-
 sonnally gained knowledge in the under-
 water realm presents unique problems.
 One of the most perplexing stems from
 limitations of visibility and necessitates
 employment of artificial aids of unique
 character.
 I have been informed that a small en-
 gineering-manufacturing firm in Cali-
 fornia made a contribution of tremen-
 dous value to the success of the Sea Lab
 II undertaking and I believe the Amer-
 ican people would be interested in the
 role played by Birns & Sawyer Cine
 Equipment Co.
 In order to carry on underwater
 photography and to expand the area of
 human observation, artificial illumina-
 tion was essential.  Experience quickly
 demonstrated the inadequacy of most
 common  underwater  lights  generally
 utilized near the surface.  Customary
 equipment proved disappointing at the
 lower levels, extending to a depth of 205
 feet.  Working life of usual lights for
 some reason was extremely limited and
 the process of replacing burned-out
 bulbs was both time consuming and
 costly.
 After many exasperations, unusual
 lighting equipment perfected by Birns
 & Sawyer, a Los Angeles firm, was put to
 use.  The lights lasted a much longer
 time. When bulbs eventually burned
 out, replacement was simple since the
 act could be accomplished inside Sea
 Lab itself in a matter of minutes, in-
 stead of sending a diver down, from the
 surface or raising the equipment to
 topside.
 The experience was a grueling test
 and the performance a most reassuring
 accomplishment.  It is most gratifying
 that a small company with only 47 em-
 ployees contributed so significantly to
 the success of the venturesome under-
 taking. Equally pleasing is the fact that
 the development of the equipment did
 not entail any expenditure of public
 funds as no research or development
 money from Federal sources was spent
 in conceiving and producing the lighting
 apparatus.
 I believe this accomplishment is a no-
 table tribute to the imagination and
 competence of a typical small business
 enterprise and merits an expression of
 gratitude on behalf of mankind.
 ORDER OF BUSINESS
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 suggest the absence of a quorum, with
 the proviso that I do not lose my right
 to the floor.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.                                                                                   The
 clerk will call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to
 call the roll.
 Mr.  MANSFIELD. Mr. President,
 once again I shall have to do a little
 backtracking.  I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the order for the quorum call
 be rescinded.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 PROXMIRE in the chair). Without objec-
 tion, it is so ordered.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that I may re-
 tain the floor, yield 10 minutes to the
 distinguished junior Senator from Ken-
 tucky [Mr. MORTON], and then propose
 another quorum call, which will be a
 "live" quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.                                                                                   The
 Chair  recognizes  the  Senator from
 Kentucky.
 PROMOTION OF SMEAR CAMPAIGN
 BY NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS OF
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 Mr. MORTON. Mr. President, I would
 like to address myself briefly today to a
 matter which involves the good name
 and the integrity of both our great po-
 litical parties.
 As a Republican, I jealously guard, the
 good name of my own party and its lead-
 ers.                                                                                      I believe my friends on the other
 side of the aisle do the same with respect
 to theirs. For that reason, I believe that
 my Democratic colleagues have as much
 interest in the matter I have in mind as
 do I.
 I gave this matter my first public at-
 tention during a speech I delivered in
 Cleveland last week. Th t speech, inci-
 dentally, was given in conhection with a
 series of dinners across the country hon-
 oring a great Republican and a great
 former President, Gen. Dwight David
 Eisenhower.
 At that time I expressed amazement
 that the national headquarters of the
 Democratic Party was using its money
 and its influence to promote a smear
 against some of our most honored cit-
 izens, General Eisenhower among them.
 I cited a three-volume blacklist prepared
 by an organization known as Group Re-
 search, Inc., which professes to maintain
 a vigilant watch over-and I am quot-
 ing-"extremists  of  all  shades  who
 threaten American democracy."
 During those remarks in Cleveland, I
 also drew attention to the fact that this
 list of dangerous extremists who are
 threatening our country carries the name

 proposed plan of development.  Land re-
 quired for administrative sites, campgrounds,
 rights-of-way for access, and other similar
 purposes Is not covered by this provision.  It
 is not the intent of the committee, as the
 language of the bill makes clear, that the
 authority to waive acquisition shall be eser-
 cised in favor of development plans--subdiv-
 isions, for instance-which will not serve the
 needs of the general public or the Govern-
 ment.
 At the subcommittee hearing, concern was
 expressed on behalf of holders of patented
 mining claims within one of the units of
 the proposed national recreation area, that
 language in the bill might be construed as
 indicating that permits for use of national
 forest land adjacent to, or so located as to
 be needed in connection with the operation
 of, the mining claims could no longer be
 issued.  The committee wishes to make clear
 that nothing in the bill is intended to change
 the authority for, or prohibit the issuance of,
 permits to make such use of national forest
 land in the national recreation area, subject
 to reasonable conditions, including those
 that may be appropriate to lessen the ad-
 verse effects of the mining operations on the
 recreational and esthetics values, taking into
 consideration  that  effective  utilization  of
 mineral and other resources of the area may
 properly be made.
 Section 10 of the bill limits the amount
 authorized  to   be  appropriated  for     land
 acquisition and for development of recrea-
 tion facilities to $21,600,000 and $22,700,000,
 respectively.  Nearly 59 percent of the costs
 which are expected to be incurred during
 the first 5 years of the program will be con-
 nected with the Whiskeytown unit, 28 per-
 cent with the Clair Engle-Lewiston unit, and
 15 percent with the Shasta unit.  Should the
 amounts authorized to be appropriated prove
 to be insufficient, whether because of rising
 land prices or for other reasons, the depart-
 ments concerned will have to seek additional
 authorization.  The committee points out
 that a substantial part of the development
 costs of the area might well be incurred
 even If H.R. 797 were not included, since
 the Forest Service and the Department of
 the Interior already have authority to install
 certain recreation facilities at the reservoirs
 covered by the bill.

 In the third section of "The Ombudsman:
 Citizen's Defender," the editor presents some
 current proposals. One of these is sponsored
 by Congressman HENRY S. REUSS, Democrat,
 of Wisconsin, who urges the creation of an
 administrative counsel of the Congress to
 take some of the load of constituent com-
 plaints   from   Congressmen's   shoulders,
 thereby permitting more time to be devoted
 to the consideration of legislation.  The staff
 of an administrative counsel could develop
 an expertise  which  would        enhance the
 efficiency and efficacy of representatives to
 the executive branch.   Besides providing
 more boon and less doggie, the administrative
 counsel might be able to pinpoint trouble-
 spots whose manifestations today are dif-
 fused in the offices of 100 Senators and 435
 Representatives.
 Finally, Professor Rowat has collected 10
 short essays in a concluding section designed
 to "present some of the arguments for and
 against transplanting the institution."
 Ombudsman countries range in popula-
 tion from New Zealand's 2,500,000 inhabi-
 tants to Sweden's 7,500,000.  Would the office
 be able to function if there were 18 million
 potential customers (Canada, California, or
 New York), or4f there were 50 million (Great
 Britain), or 190 million (the United States) ?
 The New Zealand ombudsman has testi-
 fied that with additional staff assistance he
 could handle four times his present work-
 load, which is somewhat in excess of 1,000
 complaints a year.  In Sweden, the civil
 ombudsman, the deputy civil ombudsmaAr
 and the military ombudsman have recently
 combined forces to allow for more rational
 distribution of cases. Though not raised in
 the book under review,  it might also  be
 argued that there is a minimum size-per-
 haps under 500,000-below which a city or
 state has small need for  an ombudsman,
 due to the accessibility of its political lead-
 ers.
 Must the population in question be homo-
 geneous, as are those in Scandinavia and
 New Zealand?  Would the implementation
 of an ombudsman office keep us from attack-
 ing more serious problems of public admin-
 istration?
 To resolve these doubts, "the best test is
 a practical trial, preferably as a limited and
 reversible  experiment,"  according  to Prof.
 Fritz Morstein Marx' essay.  In this vein,
 but independently of the Rowat study, Prof.
 G. V. V. Nicholls has secured the coopera-
 tion of the government of Nova Scotia in
 permitting the law students  at Dalhousie
 University  to serve  as unofficial  ombuds-
 men-a form of legal aid in the administra-
 tive sphere.
 Further scholarly research might also be
 useful.  For example, legislators sometimes
 argue that they are already functioning as
 ombudsmen.  Yet no systematic investiga-
 tion has ever been made of complaint-han-
 dling procedures, or of the number and kind
 of grievances which enter an elected official's
 office, whether in the executive or legisla-
 tive branch.              A study in this domain is be-
 ing carried out by the Institute of Govern-
 mental Studies on the Berkeley campus of
 the University of California.  Such inquiry
 is valuable whether or not an ombudsman
 office is instituted,  because it permits an
 appraisal of the adequacy of existing com-
 plaint machinery.
 The   trouble   with       the lawmaker{ as-
 ombudsman approach  is that some legis-
 lators are more able, more interested, and
 more influential than others.  At the State
 level, many citizens are not aware of this
 avenue of complaint. In my opinion, the
 availability  of  elected  officials  as  buffers
 between citizen and bureaucracy ought to
 be widely publicized, particularly if poli-
 ticians insist upon a monopoly.
 Throughout     the  Western  World,     legis-
 latures have been declining in importance
 vis-a-vis the executive. The underlying rea-
 son may be found in the vast complexity of
 modern life, which provides the experts of
 the executive branch with an automatic fait
 accompli.  Even as to grievances, lawmakers
 reply greatly on executive agencies for the
 evaluation of complaints which legislators
 receive.  To restore the balance, legislatures
 need to create tightly knit highly qualified
 counterparts of administrative mammoths.
 Praiseworthy efforts in this direction may
 be seen in Congress Joint Economic Com-
 mittee, in Federal and State comptrollers
 general, and more generally in the profes-
 sionalization of staff assistance for Congress-
 men and State legislators, their committees
 and reference libraries.  There has, however,
 been little professionalization of the com-
 plaint handling function.
 The Rowat book, then, is timely and pro-
 vocative.   But if the ombudsman idea is
 going to be more than words, it will have to
 burst the confines of academic speculation
 and be tested in one or more of our 50 State
 "laboratories."  Success in Scandinavia and
 New Zealand would seem to justify the ex-
 periment: the ombudsman has served as a
 homeopathic cure for some of the common
 ailments of bureaucracy-slowness, rudeness,
 obtuseness and error-and proved to be a
 prompt, inexpensive and flexible means of
 helping to keep administration prompt, in-
 expensive and flexible.

 FIGHTING
 (Mr. OTTINGER (at the request of
 Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON)  was granted
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. OTTINGER.  Mr. Speaker, last
 weekend we witnessed a shocking spec-
 tacle as the antidraft movement reached
 a new peak with demonstrations all over
 the country.  These latest demonstra-
 tions are shocking not only because many
 of the demonstrators are violating a new
 Federal law by destroying their draft
 cards, but also because the demanstra-
 tors-supposedly  well-informed,  well-
 educated college students-are demon-
 strating incredible ignorance about the
 situation in Vietnam.
 I want to make it clear that I firmly
 believe in the right of assembly. I be-
 lieve in the right of free speech. I be-
 lieve in the right of assembly. But I also
 believe in the law, and those who are
 breaking and perverting it by destroying
 draft cards and seeking to undermine
 the Selective Service Act are a disgrace
 to this great Nation and should be pun-
 ished to the fullest extent of the law.
 The tragedy of -these demonstrations
 against U.S. policy in Vietnam is that
 they are having an effect directly con-
 trary to that which apparently is de-
 sired. The demonstrators, most of them
 misguided and uninformed youths, are
 not promoting peace but postponing it.
 They are not convincing President John-
 son and the Congress that we should ter-
 minate our commitment in Vietnam.
 But they are misleading the Communist
 leaders in southeast Asia into believing
 that the antiwar demonstrations will
 eventually force the administration into
 pulling out of Vietnam.
 Mr. Speaker, I suggest in all serious-
 ness that if these young demonstrators
 really want the fighting in Vietnam to
 end, they should take their placards and
 signs to the Communist capitals, for
 there lies the ultimate responsibility for
 the continued bloodshed.  The demon-
 strators must awake from their naivete.
 They must realize that not only are they
 playing right into the hands of the Com-
 munists, but are in many cases actually
 being led and controlled by Communists.
 Back in January, I was gravely con-
 cerned over the situation in Vietnam and
 the lack of any clear definition of our
 policy in southeast Asia.  I was among
 the first to call upon President Johnson
 to enunciate our goals and aspirations
 in that strife-torn corner of the globe,
 and to take the initiative in seeking an
 honorable, peaceful settlement of the
 conflict.  Beginning with his speech at
 Johns Hopkins University, the President
 has done just that, but all our overtures
 have fallen on deaf ears in Hanoi and
 Peiping.   Let there be no doubt who is
 prolonging the fighting in Vietnam.  If
 our young demonstrators do have doubts,
 they would do better to spend their time
 in the classrooms and libraries getting
 the facts, rather than creating the illu-
 sion that they can force our Government
 to end its commitment in Vietnam and
 permit another Communist puppet state
 to be born.
 This is not to say that our policy in
 southeast Asia should not be subject to
 full and open discussion.  Certainly, no
 phase of our foreign policy is sacrosanct
 and beyond question.  But we are now
 colximitted to spare no effort in seeking
 a just peace and the antidraft and get-
 out-of-Vietnam movements are having
 no effect other than to hinder those
 efforts.  By their lack of responsibility
 and disrespect for the law, the demon-
 strators are putting this country in a dis-
 graceful and dangerous position.
 We cannot escalate the military con-
 flict, as the radical right would have us
 do, to the point where a world war and
 nuclear holocaust would be likely, but
 neither can we abandon the people of
 South Vietnam and the freedom-loving
 countries of the world who rely an our
 strength to protect them from Commu-
 nist domination, as the radical left and
 the antidraft demonstrators advocate.

 His plan provides for no direct access to
 the ombudsman by citizens, as in the Scan-
 dinavian countries.  All matters would have
 to come through the offices of Congressmen
 and Senators.  The answers would go back
 to the inquiring citizens-by the same route.
 REuss said his office spends about half its
 time serving these needs of constituents.
 An ombudsman, he argues, "would let the
 Congressman concentrate on central issues
 in domestic and foreign policy, and he could
 vote more wisely."

 AN AMERICAN OMBUDSMAN
 (By Richard Spong)
 An idea which has been kicking around the
 U.S. Congress without much attention for
 the past several years is certain to be given
 another and more studious look when Brit-
 ain's Parliament approves legislation estab-
 lishing the new office of Parliamentary Com-
 missioner for Administration. , This Is the
 British version of the Scandinavian Ombuds-
 man, who is charged with investigating and
 pressing citizens' complaints against the gov-
 ernment and public officials.
 Several measures to create an American
 Ombudsman have been introduced in recent
 sessions of Congress.  Senator  CLAIBORNE
 PELL, Democrat of Rhode Island and Repre-
 sentative HENRY S. REuss, Democrat of Wis-
 consin are sponsors of measures (S. 984, H.R.
 4273) pigeonholed in committees at present
 that would establish what they call an ad-
 ministrative counsel of the Congress.
 This individual, in the language of Rep-
 resentative REuss, "shall review the case of
 any person who alleges that he believes that
 he has been subjected to any improper pen-
 alty, or that he has been denied any right
 or benefit to which he is, entitled under the
 laws * * * or that the determination or award
 of any such right or benefit has been * * *
 unreasonably delayed."
 The Ombudsman has proved a successful
 device for democratic government in Sweden,
 where it was established in 1809. Since then
 it has spread to other countries, to Finland
 in 1919, Japan In 1948, Denmark in 1955, and
 Norway and New Zealand in 1962.
 Now the British Labor Government, in a
 white paper of October 12, proposes the estib-
 lishment of a Parliamentary Commissioner
 for Administration who would be an Om-
 budsman with a special British complexion.
 He would be entirely independent of the gov-
 ernment, but-and the point is important-
 the  public -would  make  its  complaints
 through Members of Parliament.  "In Brit-
 ain," the white paper explains, "Parliament
 is the place for ventilating the grievances of
 the citizen-by history, tradition, and past
 and present practice." It's also good politics

 stituents.                             -
 Most British papers welcomed the Ombuds-
 man proposal.  The Times reasoned sedately:
 "The development  of the  French Conseil
 d'Etat and the Scandinavian Ombudsman
 shows that such institutions are capable of
 becoming not merely valuable means of re-
 dress but a positive influence, making for
 competent and fair administration---an as-
 sistance not an impediment to officialdom."
 But the Daily Express sees the proposal
 as just another Labor gimmick, arguing:
 "Parliament, the press, and the judiciary are
 well able to look after the rightful interests
 of the public.  If the Ombudsman emerged
 as a serious rival for the protection of the
 public interest there might be a danger that
 the  traditional  safeguards  of  the  people
 would be undermined."
 In a welfare state the British Ombudsman
 will have plenty of complaints, though na-
 tionalized industry is to be off limits for
 him-along with local government, judicial
 proceedings, and military and foreign affairs.
 A  congressional  Administrative  Counsel
 would be equally busy.
 An American Ombudsman would lighten
 the "casework" load of Senators and Rep-
 resentatives                                                                                            and  still-by  handling only
 complaints funneled through Capitol Hill-
 leave the flow of political power undisturbed.
 Representative .REuss, in testimony before
 the Joint Committee on the Organization of
 Congress some time ago (May 11, 1965) so-
 berly observed: "I do not believe that Mem-
 bers of Congress, who want to be reelected,
 would consent to remove themselves entirely
 from dealing with constituents' problems."
 In a radio broadcast on October 14,
 1965, David Brinkley argued for an
 American ombudsman, albeit one whose
 role would be somewhat different from
 what I have envisioned.  The script of
 his broadcast follows:
 The British and four other countries have,
 or will have, somebody in the Government
 citizens can write to and get answers.  We
 could use one here.  Back in a moment.
 Sweden has had for 150 years a public
 official called an ombudsman.  His job is to
 accept complaints from the citizens about
 their dealings with the government, investi-
 gate, see if they have any substance, and if
 they do, take some action.  Now the British
 are adopting the idea.  Finland, Denmark,
 and New Zealand already have, and it is occa-
 sionally recommended that the United States
 try it.  If we did, the results surely would be
 interesting, because it appears that you can
 scratch any American and find somebody
 with a complaint, a question, a suggestion,
 or a criticism he wants to take up with the
 Government.  And if we were to have an
 ombudsman, all of these would immediately
 fall into his lap.
 Where they fall now are in the White
 House mailroom and on the desks of Con-
 gressmen, Government officials, newspaper
 and broadcast reporters.  Most of them are
 in two categories: Questions and complaints
 about  social  security  payments,  generally
 from those who think they ought to be get-
 ting more  and  questions                                                                                     and     complaints
 about  veterans' benefits,  generally    from
 those who think they ought to be getting
 more.  Plus the other Government welfare
 programs where people think they have had
 a bad deal.  And with all the new welfare
 plans now going into effect-medical care
 and the others-this kind of complaint is
 bound to increase.  Complaints sent to the
 White House are routinely referred to the
 agencies involved: Social Security, Veterans'
 Administration, the Health and Welfare De-
 partment.   And, eventually, they will an-
 swer.  But the agency answering the com-
 plaint is the same agency being complained
 about, so it is unlikely the answer will say
 anything the writer has not already heard.
 Complaints to Congress get roughly the same
 treatment.  All   congressional  offices are
 understaffed for this kind of thing.  They
 have neither the people nor the time to make -
 personal investigations of complaints about
 veterans and social security payments.  So
 they ask the agencies involved for the an-
 swers, pass them along in their own replies,
 and that's about all they can do.
 In addition, there are always those who
 want their poems printed in the   CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD or broadcast on the Voice of
 America, those with  plans for saving the
 world, paying off the debt, and other good
 ideas that, regrettably, appear unworkable.
 If there were a Federal Government ombuds-
 man, a sort of national Mister Fixit, all this
 would go to him.  He would have to have the
 power to force the right answers out of the
 bureaucrats, keep a tabulated record of the
 complaints  so  ha  could  detect  unusual
 centers of bungling and incompetence in the
 Federal Establishment and help repair them
 and so perform a service both to the public
 and to the Government. The bigger the Gov-
 ernment gets, and it grows every day, the
 more complaints there will be and the less
 chance of getting adequate  answers.   So,
 sometime,. we  may come to it, somebody
 to write to in the Government who can and
 will do something.  As for the poems and
 the plans for saving the world, he could just
 send them back with a polite note.
 In addition, I include a very thought-
 ful review of a new book on the ombuds-
 man edited by Prof. Donald C. Rowat of
 the University of Toronto and entitled,
 "The Ombudsman: Citizen's Defender,"
 University of Toronto, 1965.  The re-
 viewer Prof. Stanley V. Anderson of the
 University of California at Santa Bar-
 bara is one of the leading experts on the
 ombudsman. He is a professor of politi-
 cal science and a lawyer.

 COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT
 (By Stanley V. Anderson)
 The ombudsman is an independent com-
 missioner appointed  by the legislature to
 investigate citizens' complaints of bureau-
 cratic abuse.  He has the power to compel
 testimony, the duty to form an opinion, and
 the right to publish his views.  He does not
 have power to change an administrative de-
 cision nor to punish civil servants other than
 by reprimand.
 As a result of ombudsmanic inquiries, the
 administration may choose to alter a previ-
 ous position or to subject an employee to
 disciplinary proceedings.  The former is com-
 mon, the latter rare.   In either case, the
 authorities act because they are persuaded
 by the reasonableness of the ombudsman's
 views, and not because they are bound by
 his  judgments. Equally  important,  an
 agency may revise a troublesome regulation
 or the legislature may amend an unworkable
 law, pursuant to the ombudsman's sugges-
 tion.
 Sweden provided for a Justitieombudsm.an
 (JO)--literally, an "agent for justice"--in
 the constitution of 1809.  Finland, for cen-
 turies a part of the Swedish kingdom, fol-
 lowed suit in 1919 after breaking ties with
 Russia.  In the decade from 1952 to 1962, the
 institution was 'adopted in Denmark, Nor-
 way, New Zealand, and West Germany--in
 the last, for military affairs only.  More re-
 cently, proposals have been put forward in
 Australia, Canada, England, Holland, and Ire-
 land.   This  year,  ombudsman  bills  were
 dropped in the legislative hoppers of Cali-
 fornia, Connecticut, Illinois, and New York.
 Another was introduced in the New York City
 Council.  Gov. Edmund G. Brown accorded
 the California bill emergency status before
 it was defeated in the senate committee on
 government efficiency; the measure is under
 interim study awaiting reintroduction by
 by Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Unruh.
 The literature on Ombudsmen is extensive,
 but  scattered  and  repetitive.   Professor
 Rowat,  chairman  of  political  science  at
 Carleton University in Ottawa, has provided
 a benchmark by putting 28 articles between
 two covers. Nearly half of the text explicates
 existing Ombudsman systems.      Next, a few
 related institutions are described, such as
 the Army Inspectorate-General and the erst-
 while  Philippine  Presidential                                                                                                                                              Complaints
 and Action Committee (PCAC).     The demise
 of the latter suggests that the effectiveness
 of an Ombudsman is limited to marginal
 defects in  administration,  and "does  not
 meet the [more basic] need for a rationaliza-
 tion of government power and structure.`"
 With  a  population   three  times  that of
 Sweden, the PCAC received complaints at a
 rate of 30 to 1 over the Swedish total of
 about 2,000'a year.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE         October 21, 1965
 Small  Business  Administration  disaster
 loans-the principal form of Federal assist-
 ance now available to individual disaster vic=
 tims.
 These SBA home and business rebuilding
 loans, which carry an interest charge of only
 3 percent, can now be offered for a term of
 no more than 20 years, and only to borrow-
 ers who can't qualify for private credit.  The
 Senate bill would extend the maximum loan
 term to 30 years and, more important, make
 low-cost SBA credit available to all comers
 in any area the agencry declares to be dis-
 aster stricken.  (Portions of 38 States have
 been  so  designated  within  the  past  18
 months.)
 "This may take some business away from
 private mortgage lenders," concedes one of
 the bill's proponents, "but why should a
 provident man whose home has been washed
 away have to pay 6 percent for rebuilding
 money when his neighbor with a lousy, credit
 rating is only paying 3 percent?"
 The Senate bill's provisions for reimburs-
 ing property owners for their losses would
 make the States handle damage claims and
 require them to put up one-third of the
 funds.  The money would only go out for
 damage categories against which insurance
 can't be obtained "at reasonable rates" and
 total reimbursement would be limited to 75
 percent of the amount of a disaster loss.
 Also, high-risk areas especially vulnerable
 to repeated flooding would be excluded from
 coverage; States would have to adopt "flood-
 plain zoning controls" that would rule out
 such areas.
 NO  WIND PROTECTION
 Thus a man whose $30,000 home is com-
 pletely washed away by a flood could qualify
 for the maximum $15,000 Federal grant, plus
 $7,500 from his State government-provided
 he hadn't built in an area ruled off limits by
 his State's flood-zoning plan.   If, on the
 other hand, his home were destroyed by a
 tornado or by hurricane winds (as contrasted
 with hurricane waters)  there would be no
 Federal-State  reimbursement  because  he
 could  have    obtained  private insurance
 against wind perils. Eligiblity of an earth-
 quake victim would depend on the avail-
 ability and rates for earthquake insurance
 in his locality.
 "We feel we've taken care not to discourage
 sound business practices in any way," says
 Senator  BAYH.   And neither insurers nor
 mortgage lenders have any great quarrel with
 his assertion, though the lenders are far
 from pleased with the bill's broadening of
 SBA loan eligibility standards.
 The insurance industry, for its part, has
 long agonized over its inability to offer flood
 insurance and is glad to have protection
 against the torrent of abuse that invariably
 follows  rejection  of  mass  water  damage
 claims.  There are misgivings, to be sure,
 about just where a Federal intrusion into the
 indemnity field may ultimately lead.    But
 the Bayh bill, at least in the judgment of in-
 surance                industry   envoys  in  Washington,
 poses no imminent threat.
 COULD AID INSURERS LATER
 "It doesn't discourage purchase of any
 form of insurance that's on the market now,
 and by encouraging the States to develop
 flood-zoning systems, it could pave the way
 for making private flood insurance practical,"
 observes one industry man.  Should flood
 zoning ever become refined enough to permit
 accurate scaling of insurance rates accord-
 ing to flood risks, the Bayh bill is designed to
 cede jurisdiction back to the industry, at
 least in lower risk areas.
 But what may be good for insurers and
 money lenders may not represent "sound
 business practice" for Uncle Sam, some flood
 control experts suggest.
 Average flood and tidal damages of around
 $400 million yearly over the past decade, as
 compiled by the U.S. Weather Bureau, could
 soar much higher, the weathermen concede.
 Even the estimated $1.9 billion in damages
 inflicted over the past 12 months-a high
 water mark-could be dwarfed in a few hours,
 it's acknowledged, if a wayward hurricane
 should ever blow into the New York area at
 full tilt.
 Once before, in 1956, Congress authorized
 creation of a flood indemnity fund, built on
 an insurance framework under which persons
 seeking protection would pay 60 percent of
 the premium, Uncle Sam 20 percent and the
 States the balance.  But the Federal Flood
 Indemnification Administration, set up to
 run the program, quickly became mired in
 ratesetting  quarrels.   And  when  it  came
 back to Congress in 1957 for $500 million just
 to get the program going, the House Appro-
 priations Committee balked.  Without any
 funding, the program perished.
 THE WAR IN VIETNAM AND THE
 GENEVA CONVENTION
 Mr.    DODD.  Mr.  President,  not  so
 many months ago, our defeatists and our
 doomsday criers, as well as our enemies,
 were telling us that the war in Vietnam
 could not be won.
 Some of them said we could not pos-
 sibly win, because the French who knew
 southeast Asia so much better than we
 do had not been able to win with an
 army of 500,000 men.
 This is an argument which I have al-
 ways found singularly unimpressive.
 Indeed, on the basis of their entire
 record in Indochina, the French colonial-
 ists should be the last,ones to be held up
 as an example or to be asked for advice
 on how to conduct a counterguerrilla
 war.
 Some said that we could not possibly
 win because we ourselves were un-
 equipped to fight a guerrilla war in the
 jungles of Vietnam.   But their pessi-
 mistic appraisal has been' given the lie
 by the events of recent months in Viet-
 nam.
 And there were those who said that we
 could not possibly win because Hanoi and
 Peiping were prepared to fight for 10
 or 20 years if necessary. They said that
 Communist regimes are infinitely more
 stubborn and persevering than demo-
 cratic governments can ever be, and that
 these regimes are inherently too proud
 to admit defeat.
 this appraisal of Communist staying
 power was proved wrong in the Korean
 war, and it is my conviction that it will
 again be proved wrong in Vietnam.
 Communist pride is a contradiction in
 terms.  The Communists have no pride.
 They are history's supreme opportunists.
 When hard pressed, they have always
 been willing to call a halt to the battle,
 even at the cost of important diplomatic
 concessions.
 In the days after the Bolshevik revolu-
 tion, Lenin lectured some of the more
 stubborn of his party members on the
 need for knowing how to take one step
 back, so that they would at a future date
 be able to take two steps forward. And,
 at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Lenin
 purchased peace with the German Army
 by major territorial and other conces-
 sions.
 So it simply is not true that Commu-
 nists are too proud to back down or to
 compromise.
 When I returned from the Far East
 last May and reported that the war in
 Vietnam was going much better than
 could be gleaned from a reading of the
 press and that there were many reasons
 for being sanguine about the future, I
 was accused by some editors and by some
 of my colleagues of naivete and wishful
 thinking. I know that one Senator said
 on the floor of the Senate later that I did
 not know what I was talking about.
 But today I do not think that anyone
 will challenge the statement that the
 war is going very much better for our
 side.
 Virtually all the accounts from Viet-
 nam are now agreed that the much-
 touted Vietcong monsoon offensive failed
 to make serious headway; that our side
 has, by and large, had the better of the
 Communists in the important engage-
 ments that have taken place since last
 June 1; that morale on the Government
 side has improved tremendously; and
 that there are clear signs that the morale
 of the Vietcong is beginning to crack.
 This is the theme of an article in this
 week's issue of Time magazine, which
 I ask unanimous consent to insert into
 the RECORD at the conclusion of my re-
 marks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 3.)
 Mr. DODD.  I ask unanimous consent
 that an article entitled "Back to Geneva
 1954? An Act of Political Folly" be
 printed at the conclusion of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 2.)
 Mr. DODD.  Mr. President, the Time
 article makes it clear that the vastly
 improved situation in Vietnam could not
 possibly have come about without large
 scale American intervention. But it also
 underscores the fact that it is the South
 Vietnamese Army, and not the American
 forces, that is doing most of the fighting
 and suffering most of the casualties.
 And the South Vietnamese forces are
 now fighting better because, with our
 assistance, they are now confident of the
 final outcome of the struggle.
 Time points out that in the 4 months
 after U.S. combat units went into ac-
 tion, some 3,000 Government soldiers
 were killed compared with 275 Amer-
 icans.  It also points out that, as the
 U.S. buildup has grown larger, Gov-
 ernment losses in action have gone down
 dramatically-from 1,300 in July, to 800
 in August, to 567 in September.
 There are many evidences of declining
 Vietcong morale. Their dead, whom they
 previously used to remove from the bat-
 tlefield even at the risk of their lives,
 are now frequently left on the field of
 battle in large numbers.  Their weap-
 ons, which they previously considered
 far more precious than lives, are now
 frequently left behind by the retreating
 Vietcong.
 But perhaps the most important single
 piece of evidence of the declining Viet-
 cong morale is the fact that during the
 month of September defections from the
 Vietcong to the Government side reached
 the all-time high of 1,654. Against this
 figure, the Vietcong was able to boast of

 ently under consideration we come to
 the point of recognition by the Federal
 Government of its obligation to provide
 some sort of assistance in this, field.
 Once the HHFA has completed the 9-
 month study of flood insurance factors
 and an equivalent study of earthquake
 insurance factors the Congress will be in
 a better position to determine what form
 Federal assistance in this area should
 take.  It may be that the study itself
 once completed will provide sufficient
 data for the insurance industry to use in
 setting up a privately financed program.
 This, however, does not seem likely as the
 insurance industry has for many years
 studied the problem_ and determined
 over and over that privately supported
 flood insurance is financially unfeasible.
 Thus it may be then that what will come
 out of this study will be a proposal for a
 Federal reinsurance or upper, lguar-
 antee which, in the manner pioneed by
 Federal Housing Administration insured
 loans, will encourage reasonable flood in-
 surance schemes to be proposed by pri-
 vate industry.
 Or, it may be that nothing will induce
 the industry to establish flood and earth-
 quake insurance programs at reasonable
 rates. In this case the Federal Govern
 rlaent will have no alternative but'to es-
 tablish its own Federal disaster insurance
 program.  If this becomes necessary all
 that remains is to implement a statute
 which is already on the books, the Fed-
 eral Flood Insurance Act of 1956-Public
 Law 84-1016).  If merited at that time
 Public Law 84-1016 could be, expanded to
 Include earthquake insurance as well.
 Those of us who have worked to assure
 passage of language authorizing and ap-
 propriating money for a flood and earth-
 quake insurance study trust that the
 blousing and Home Finance Agency-
 incorporated now in the newly created
 Department of Housing and Urban :De-
 velopment will bend its efforts toward
 providing for the Congress the most
 thorough-and all-encompassing study of
 the factors involved in earthquake and
 flood insurance. Thus, when the report
 is received, we will be in a position to
 make an intelligent decision as to what
 sort of Federal program is needed in this
 area.
 Surely the massive loss of real and per-
 sonal property which occurs yearly in
 the United States can, in some measure,
 be insured against through some sort of
 federally supported or federally assisted
 program.  The study which H.R. 11539
 authorizes is the first necessary step to-
 ward this goal.
 Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal
 of June 9 and again of October 18 of this
 year discussed proposals being consid
 ered here in the Congress and elsewhere
 In the country for a Federal disaster in-
 surance program.  These articles will, I
 am sure, be of interest to the Senate.
 I ask unanimous consent that they ap-
 pear at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 STATE  AIDS  BELIEVE  ANY  FLOOD  INSURANCE
 REQUIRES FEDERAL AID-COMMSSSIONERS
 LIKELY  To SOUND OUT WASHINGTON AS
 FIRMS ARE RELUCTANT To HANDLE PROBLEM
 NEw YoRx.-Any workable program to in-
 sure property owners against flood damage
 will require large-scale Federal participation.
 That view appeared to be gaining support
 among State insurance regulators at the
 semiannual meeting of the National Associ-
 ation of Insurance Commissioners here, de=
 spite wide misgivings among insurers and
 State officials regarding Federal "encroach-
 ments."
 An NAIC committee on property and cas-
 ualty coverages will meet late today and is
 expected to recommend that the organization
 schedule conferences in Washington to find
 out what kind of Government participation
 might be arranged.  It will act on the basis
 of a report of a subcommittee to which the
 flood insurance question was assigned more
 than a year ago.
 This report includes the findings  of  a
 group of insurance industry representatives
 who were asked last year to explore the ques-
 tion of private concerns' capabilities in the
 field of flood coverage.  That panel indicated
 earlier this week that after extensive studies
 it could make "no recommendations of any
 specific program  for flood  insurance  on
 dwelling buildings."      That report in effect
 tossed the problem back into the State offi-
 cials' laps and left no way out but an indem-
 nification plan based largely on Government
 aid.
 Basically, the view of insurance men is
 that flood damage is not an insurable risk in
 the same sense as fire or hurricane losses, in
 which the premiums paid by many persons
 provide funds to compensate the relatively
 few who have losses.  It is argued that
 hardly anyone would buy flood insurance
 unless he is in a location, such as a river
 valley or the seashore, where damage would
 be probable-a situation inconsistent with
 the insurance principle of risk spreading.
 The insurance industry panel said it had
 considered a mandatory approach, in which
 all dwelling policies would include a charge
 for flood coverage, and a plan in which flood
 coverage would be optional.  It said it found
 neither approach workable "on a feasible
 business basis."

 CONGRESS MULLS A PLAN To AID FUTURE VIC-
 TIMS OF FLOODS, HURRICANES-FEDERAL IN-
 SVRANCE  WOULD  GIVE  PROPERTY  DAMAGE
 COVERAGE. NOT OFFERED BY COMPANIES
 (By Joseph W. Sullivan)
 WASHINGTON.-Protection   for property
 owners against a major hazard that U.S. in-
 surance companies have never been willing
 to cover at any price may soon be made
 available by Uncle Sam, without charge.
 The hazard, which already has inflicted
 damages of well over a billion dollars on
 U.S. homes, farms, and businesses this year,
 is water-water propelled by a flooding river,
 high tide, hurricane or just plain windstorm.
 Because these perils are capable of inun-
 dating entire communities, Insurers blanch
 at the prospect of paying for their havoc.
 Moreover, because insurance against them
 has appeal only in the localities where the
 peril is greatest, there's little way for an
 insurer to apply his golden precept of col-
 lecting premiums from the many to pay the
 claims of a few.
 These same Considerations, however,  are
 serving to spur efforts within the Johnson
 administration and in Congress to come up
 with some alternate form of relief payments
 for the afflicted. For the greater thedestruc-
 26967
 tion, the greater the pressures for the Gov-
 ernment to step in and help out. Galvanized
 by this year's freakish combination of heavy
 winter and spring flooding in many parts of
 the West and Hurricane Betsy's more recent
 devastation of the Louisiana lowlands, con-
 gressional majorities are plainly prepared to
 start the relief funds flowing, though the
 form, size and exact timing of help are still
 in doubt.
 FEDERAL INDEMNITY PAYMENTS
 Creation of a federally subsidized disaster
 insurance program in which property owners
 would pay some premium to get protection, is
 one possibility getting consideration.  Most
 of the attention, though, centers on provid-
 ing unadorned Government indemnity pay-
 ments for home and business losses in desig-
 nated disaster areas.
 "Private property owners have no effective
 way to protect themelves against the worst
 forms of natural calamity, and the Federal
 Government is the only entity with the re-
 sources to step in and fill the void," declares
 an official of the Federal Office of Emergency
 Planning.  The OEP figures to spend close to
 $100 million this year to help clean away
 flood and storm debris, restore public facil-
 ities and                                                                                                                                               services  and provide  emergency
 housing to disaster victims; but under pres-
 ent law it can't do anything about com-
 pensating private losses.
 As a starter in that direction, the House is
 due to approve today a special "Betsy" bill
 providing what amounts to Federal grants
 of up to $1,800 each to uninsured Louisiana,
 Florida, and Mississippi residents whose prop-
 erty was damaged or destroyed by the hurri-
 cane.  The Senate Public Works Committee
 plans to take up the measure tomorrow and
 barring some end-of-session mixup it should
 be enacted by late this week.
 BROADER DISASTER BELIEF
 The Betsy bill does no more than set a
 precedent, however, and despite its $70 mil-

 broader disaster relief legislation that's being
 readied to follow.  Indeed, after ratifying
 the Betsy bill last Wednesday, the House
 Public Works Committee immediately turned
 its attention to a Senate-passed indemnifica-
 tion bill that would set far higher ceilings
 on individual payments for all future disas-
 ters--$22,500 in the case of residential dam-
 ages  and  $75,000  for  business  property.
 Because nobody has a firm idea how much
 this scheme might ultimately cost, the House
 group will probably extend its deliberations
 on the measure into the new session of Con-
 gress that begins In January.  Both congres-

 specialists are agreed, though, that some ver-

 enacted soon.
 "The simple fact that we have to resort to
 special, sectional acts of Congress to provide
 relief to some disaster areas is indication
 enough that present provisions are inade-
 quate," declares Democratic Senator BIRCH
 BAYH, of Indiana, chief sponsor of the Sen-
 ate-passed bill.  Only by pledging prompt

 tells us what really went on.
 On September 29, Mr. Blockley wrote
 me a long letter from which I plan to
 quote extensively in my further remarks.
 But before I do so, I would like to try to
 dispel some of the confusion that unfor-
 tunately exists about the terms of the
 Geneva agreement and about the pur-
 ported violation of the agreement by the
 South Vietnamese Government and by
 the United States.
 THE TERMS OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS
 Insofar as they pertain to Vietnam,
 there were two items of importance in
 the group of documents generally re-
 ferred to as the Geneva Accords, or
 Geneva Agreements.
 The first was an agreement for a mili-
 tary truce signed by the French and the
 Vietminh.  This truce called for the re-
 groupment of the opposing military
 forces on both sides of the 17th parallel,
 provided that people wishing to move
 from one regroupment zone to the other
 might do so, and established a three-
 nation International Control Commis-
 sion to supervise the truce.
 This military agreement also placed
 ceilings and restrictions on the amount
 and type of military forces and equip-
 ment which might be maintained in each
 zone.
 In addition to this truce between the
 French and Vietminh, there was also a
 curious document entitled a "Final Dec-
 laration" of the Geneva Conference.
 This document, signed by no person or no
 nation, called for, among other things,
 the holding of free elections in July 1956
 to establish democratic institutions un-
 der which the country might be unified.
 It should be clear to even the most in-
 experienced lawyer that such unsigned
 declarations bind no one and that uni-
 lateral declarations, such as those issued
 by the United States and the State of
 Vietnam at the Geneva Conference, have
 just as much validity, if not more.  At
 least they were signed by someone.
 At the final session of the Geneva Con-
 ference on Indochina on July 21, 1954,
 the Vietnamese delegate formally pro-
 tested "against the hasty conclusions of
 the armistice agreement by the French
 and Vietminh high commands only," and
 against various provisions of the agree-
 ment.
 He protested particularly "against the
 fact that the French high command was
 pleased to take the right, without a pre-
 liminary agreement of the delegation of
 the State of Vietnam, to set the date of
 further elections."
 He concluded by saying:
 The Government of the state of Vietnam
 wished the conference to take note of the
 fact that itreserves the, full freedom of action
 in order to safeguard the sacred right of the
 Vietnamese people to territorial unity, na-
 tional independence, and freedom.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE         October 21, 1965
 Free elections under such circum-
 stances would have been a travesty of
 the letter as well as the spirit of the final
 declaration of the Geneva Conference.
 I have already made the point that
 the appendix to the Geneva Convention
 calling for national elections in 1956 was
 not legally binding on the government
 of South Vietnam.
 But if one wishes to argue that this
 clause was binding on both sides, then
 it is clear that North Vietnam was from
 the very first in violation of the Geneva
 Accord on this point because its very first
 act was to destroy all those political pre-
 conditions which might have made free
 elections possible.
 COMMUNISM AND DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS
 There is another matter to which the
 current advocates of nationwide elec-
 tions in Vietnam have not, I believe, giv-
 en adequate consideration.
 Their advocacy is generally justified
 on the grounds that a nationwide elec-
 tion is the only democratic and reason-
 able manner of settling the Vietnam
 dispute.
 Most of them would, I believe, be pre-
 pared to concede that Communists, when
 they engage in election campaigns or
 when they seek to win the support of
 the people in a country or an area they
 The united states took the position in
 its declaration that it would support the
 Geneva Agreements and would view with
 concern any attempt to upset them with
 force.
 On the subject of reunification, we
 maintained we would support the prin-
 ciple of free elections under United Na-
 tions supervision.
 The South Vietnamese authorities also
 announced that they would not inter-
 fere with the provisions of the Franco-
 Vietminh truce, but they made it plain
 that they bitterly resented the artificial
 division of their country.
 But putting aside this question of who
 agreed to what at Geneva, and putting
 aside the fact that the final declaration
 is an obscurely worded document, it is
 plain that the documents issuing from
 this conference 10 years ago were quite
 clear on what sort of elections were to
 be held in Vietnam.  They were to be
 free elections. And it has been as plain
 as a pike-staff for the past decade that
 by no stretch of the imagination could
 free elections ever have been held in
 North Vietnam.
 Free elections would only have been
 possible throughout the territory of Viet-
 nam if, over the 2-year period between
 the Geneva Convention and the pf'o-
 posed date of the elections, there had

 pendence, the result of the election must
 be considered binding for all time by all
 countries because, so the argument goes,
 the Vietnamese people will have opted
 for communism..
 In my opinion, any such one-time elec-
 tion is a travesty on democracy and has
 absolutely nothing to do with the process
 of self-determination.
 For my own part, I would be prepared
 to agree to nationwide elections in Viet-
 nam if strong international machinery
 could be set up to assure the Vietnamese
 people of complete political democracy
 for a period of several years after the
 election, with the understanding that
 there would be a second election at the
 end of that time.
 I am convinced that in any such sec-
 ond election the people would turn
 against the Communists in as over-
 whelming numbers as the Hungarian
 people turned against their Communist
 regime.  But I am also convinced that
 no Communist regime would ever or
 could ever agree to such democratic elec-
 tions because the Communists also know
 that such elections would mean the end
 of communism.
 Communist violations of the Geneva
 Convention were not confined to the es-
 tablishment of a totalitarian state.
 and one of this country's leading experts
 on southeast Asia, has pointed out in a
 recent issue of "Vietnam Perspectives":
 As a matter of record the withdrawal of
 the Vietminh forces from the zone of the
 south  was  accompanied  by  considerable
 looting and destruction of public buildings
 and  railroads,  systematic  destruction or
 theft of the files, documents, and especially
 land registries in the upper provinces close
 to the 17th parallel, and kidnaping or murder
 of local officials.  But, by contrast to the
 activity of the irregulars who were left be-
 hind, these were transient woes visited upon
 the Government and the people of South
 Vietnam.
 Professor Trager went on to point out
 that in 1955 the irregular cadres who
 have been left behind in South Vietnam
 were formally organized Into the so-
 called army of liberation and that it
 was at this early date that the Commu-
 nists embarked upon their systematic
 campaign of terror and kidnapping and
 sabotage and military action disguised
 as internal revolt against the Govern-
 ment of South Vietnam.

 do, therefore, is to set the record straight
 in our own minds on the Geneva Con-
 vention, so that we will not again be
 entrapped by a call for a return to the
 Convention or by any formula similar to
 the Geneva Convention.
 And we must also set the record
 straight in our own minds on the sub-
 jeer; of coalition governments with Com-
 munists because I am convinced that
 such a coalition in Vietnam would be an
 invitation to total disaster.
 The administration has advised the
 rulers of Hanoi that we place no precon-
 ditions on the convening of the diplo-
 matic conference to terminate the hos-
 tilities in Vietnam.
 But this does not mean that the ad-
 ministration is prepared to accept any
 conditions posed by the Communists or
 that it will consent to a peace which
 would, within a short period of time, re-
 sult in turning South Vietnam over to
 Communist control.
 President Johnson made this abund-
 antly clear when he warned that there
 was no power on earth that could force
 us from Vietnam or that could compel us
 to abandon the Vietnamese people who
 loot; to us for protection.
 There are details of any agreement
 that cannot be foreseen.  On the other
 hand, I cannot think of any more gen-
 erous proposal for the settlement of the
 Vietnamese conflict than the proposal
 outlined by the administration earlier
 this year.
 This proposal did not call for uncondi-
 tional surrender on the part of North
 Vietnam.
 It did not even call for compensation
 to South Vietnam or for territorial con-
 cessions on the part of the North.
 It asked simply that Hanoi call off its
 war of aggression against the Govern-
 ment of South Vietnam-and, in return
 for this, it offered North Vietnam the
 prospect of participating as a beneficiary
 in the multibillion-dollar Mekong River
 plan.
 Less than this we could not demand.
 More than this we cannot offer, with-
 out gravely compromising the freedom of
 South Vietnam for which so many
 American boys have now given "the last
 full measure of devotion."
 EXHIBIT 1
 SEPTEMBER 29, 1965.
 Senator THOMAS J. DODD,
 Washington, D.C.,
 United States of America.
 DEAR  SENATOR                DODD:    Thank you for in-
 viting me to write and tell you of some of my
 experiences, and views I formed, while I was
 a member of the Canadian delegation to the
 International Control Commissions in Indo-
 china.        A career diplomat in the Canadian
 Foreign Service, I was, in 1957-58, Senior
 Political Adviser to the Canadian Commission
 on the International Commission for Super-
 vision and Control in Vietnam (to give it its
 full name in English).  I also served as legal
 adviser to all three Canadian Commissioners
 (for Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) and also
 was acting leader of the delegation to the
 Vietnam Commission on a number of oc-
 casions.        In the course of this service I had
 several conversations with Ho  Chi-minh,
 Pham Van Dong and General Giap; and with
 Premier  Chou-en-lai  and several of the
 Russian leaders.
 The  study  of  the  Geneva  Agreements
 (1954) I was called on to make in connection
 with the performance of my duties led me
 to the firm conclusion that no legal or moral
 obligations devolved upon the Government
 of South Vietnam from the operation of the
 agreement relating to Vietnam.
 The parties to this agreement were France,
 a  defeated  colonial power endeavoring to
 extricate itself from the consequences of a
 military defeat at the hands of an insurgent
 body,   the  other  party  to  the  agreement,
 which was itself opposed by another very
 large segment of the population.
 By  no norm of international  law with
 which I am familiar could the onerous under-
 takings of a colonial power in favor of one
 segment of the population-of the national
 community-be regarded as devolving upon
 another segment of the community which
 was subsequently successful in wresting its
 own independence from the colonial power.
 As  signatories  of  the  agreement,  both
 France and North Vietnam are in breach of
 the agreement, but it is absurd to talk of
 the United States or South Vietnam, who
 opposed the agreement, as having "broken"
 it.
 In any event the agreement was hardly
 signed before the Communist North Viet-
 namese Government had breached it.  Al-
 though almost a million non-Communists
 managed to get away from North Vietnam
 as the French were surrendering (an extra-
 ordinary mass "voting with the feet" to
 which I have seen little reference recently),
 the agreement provided for exit permits for
 all others who wished to leave.  These were
 denied tens of thousands of persons of whom
 the Commission had knowledge; how many
 millions more there were of whom the Com-
 mission had no knowledge we shall never
 know.   The  Commission  does     know  that
 there was a large-scale revolt in one of the
 Provinces of North  Vietnam,   largely  over
 this matter of the refusal of the North Viet-
 namese authorities to issue the exit permits
 which had been promised the local popula-
 tion, and to which they were entitled under
 the agreement.   Canadians serving on the
 Commission's local  team  saw evidence  of
 suppression of the revolt with their own
 eyes, and received full accounts,  but the
 Commission would not, and could not, do
 anything about it.
 Early attempts by some Canadians and a
 very few Indians to insist that the North
 Vietnamese carry out the terms of the agree-
 ment in respect to certain individuals were
 tantamount to sentences of death for them.
 I have referred in an earlier letter to the
 hours spent by members of the Canadian
 delegation, including myself, in destroying
 thousands of petitions from people in North
 Vietnam who clearly came within the pro-
 tecting clauses of the agreement, so that
 there would be no chance of the petitions
 falling into the hands of the Communist
 authorities.  To give some of the Indians
 their due, I was told by some of them that
 they had done likewise with petitions ad-
 dressed either to their delegation or to the
 Commission Secretariat.
 During Chou En-lai's state visit to Hanoi,
 I was invited, as acting leader of the dele-
 gation at the time, to attend the numerous
 receptions which were  accorded him.   At
 the first of these I was singled out by Ho
 Chi Minh as the only person at the recep-
 tion besides the guest of honor, Chou, with
 whom he conversed.  In the course of the
 evening, I had two long talks with him, and
 two with Chou En-lai.
 Early next morning I was roused by the
 delegation officer of the day who informed
 me a mob had gathered at the delegation
 office building, part of which had forced
 itself into the courtyard of the building,
 despite  the  effort of  armed  Communist
 guards, and unarmed Canadian soldiers, to
 keep them out.  I was driven hurriedly to
 the office building, the crowd (which I esti-
 mated  at  over                                                                                                                                a  thousand  and  growing
 rapidly) letting the car through when the
 orderly officer called out, "C'est M. l'Am-
 bassadeur canadien."
 Going through      a postern in the  main
 gates of the carriage entrance to the build-
 ing courtyard, I found 200 or 300 North Viet-
 namese  milling  around  in there,                                                                                                                                   with  a
 score  or so of anxious Canadian soldiers
 keeping them from going up the staircases
 into the offices themselves.  I went up to a
 half-way landing on  one      of  these stair-
 cases and shouted for silence, then singled
 out an impressive looking Vietnamese matron
 to act as spokesman, demanding to know
 from her what the demonstration was all
 about.  She told me the rumor had quickly
 spread about Hanoi during the preceding
 evening and night that the Canadian dele-
 gation now enjoyed cordial relations with
 the Communist authorities and would now
 be able to insure the issuance of exit per-
 mits to those who had been denied them.
 "So," she added quite simply, "I knew there
 would be thousands coming for them today,
 so I came early for mine,  as have these
 other people."
 In the meantime truckloads of armed po-
 lice and soldiers had been arriving outside,
 and struggles were developing as they tried
 to seize people in the crowd.  Shouting so
 that I could be heard above the commo-
 tion, I managed to arrest these activities, and
 then I addressed the crowd from the outside
 staircase landing.    "Que vous etes fous-
 fous-fous"-"How mad  you are to  come
 here" and going on in French, "The Cana-
 dian delegation can never, never, never help
 you-it does not want to help you. Never
 come near this building again, nor go near
 the Commission building.  And tell every-
 body else so.  Now, run, run, run, and get
 away as fast as you can."
 As I cried out the last words I signalled
 to the Canadian soldiers who swung open
 the great gates, and the crowd in the court-
 yard erupted into the crowd outside, and all
 turned and scattered, bowling over many
 police and soldiers who, miraculously, re-
 frained from opening fire (although we had
 heard rifle fire in Hanoi previous nights).
 The last I saw of the marvelous old Viet-
 namese dame, she had kilted her ground-
 length skirts up to her knees, had nimbly
 dodged  two or  three soldiers  and  police,
 leaped into a pedicab which she must have
 arranged for beforehand, and careened off
 down the street, rounding a corner on two
 wheels  while a policeman who had       been
 pursuing her in another pedicab lay sprawled
 in the street, his pedicab operator, either
 deliberately or accidentally having upset in
 attempting to round the same corner.
 Mercifully, only two or three truckloads
 of prisoners were borne off in the police
 vans.  All efforts in the Commission subse-
 quently to ensure these luckless ones were
 not punished for attempting to exercise their
 rights under the Geneva Agreements went
 without success.
 In view of the Commission's sorry record
 of failure to extend any sort of protection
 to persons entitled to such protection under
 the Geneva Agreements, anyone who sug-
 gests it could do any better in assuring a
 terror free election throughout North and
 South Vietnam must be utterly disingenu-
 ous, incredibly ignorant or downright pro-
 Communist!
 I will but briefly mention the dreadful
 experience of finding North Vietnamese in
 my office and in my residence-the Lord
 knows how they had managed to get in,
 evading both the Vietnamese and Canadian
 guards-who Would then plead with me to
 save them by smuggling them out, breaking
 down and throwing their arms around my
 feet, even threatening me, and whom I in

 In this connection it should be emphasized
 that though neither the United States nor
 the Republic of Vietnam were signatories to
 the Geneva Agreements of 1954, this fact of
 itself did not wholly relieve the two govern-
 ments from observing the provisions of these
 Agreements provided all other parties to them
 abided by them.  There is precedent in inter-
 national law for observing treaties and agree-
 ments which cover a zone or subject of in-
 terests even if a government is not signatory
 to the treaty.  However, any breach of the
 articles of the agreement by any of the con-
 tracting parties automatically suspends or
 destroys the basis for compliance by other
 contracting or related parties.  It certainly
 relieves nonsignatories from any actual or
 implied obligation to observe the provisions
 of the treaty or agreement.
 It is clear that the U.S. representatives at
 Geneva had little confidence in its con-
 clusions;  that  they expected trouble and
 therefore provided legitimate tests by which
 the United States could legally and honor-
 ably determine its course of action.  Any

 THE GAUNTLET TAKEN
 What happens next in the war in Vietnam
 depends in part on the Communists.  Hav-
 ing been halted in midstride, the Vietcong
 can drop back to the small-unit actions and
 the sabotage of phase 2, adding perhaps mas-
 sive terrorism in Saigon to try to bring down
 the government.  It is the kind of war they
 are best at, but "deconcentrating," as U.S.
 strategists call it, would be a political re-
 treat that might well affect the morale of
 their troops and their hold on the peasants.
 Alternatively, they could go into phase 3
 anyway, perhaps even with a mass assault of
 divisional size on U.S. units in the hope of
 discrediting the U.S. presence by a major,
 one-shot victory.  But that might well prove
 suicidal, for the Vietcong have discovered
 that these days a mass assault all too easily
 turns into an avalanche of airborne bullets,
 napalm, and bombs.  Or they might simply
 fade away to lie low, Br'er Rabbit fashion, in
 the hope that sooner or later the United
 States would get weary of waiting and go
 back home.
 That would be the unwisest course of all.
 Poe in deciding to stand in South Vietnam,
 the United States means just that.  "After
 all, we've kept 250,000 men in Western Eu-
 rope for 20 years," observes a general.                  We
 can Wait too."  The United States also means
 much more.  It means to counter' the Red
 revolution with   a  genuine  revolution in
 health, education, welfare, and self-sufficien-
 cy for the Vietnamese that the Communists
 can hardly be expected to understand.  The
 Communists themselves chose South Viet-
 nam as their test case and springboard to the
 conquest of all southeast Asia.  There are
 signs that they are already beginning to
 regret it.  The United States has picked up
 the gauntlet, and it is not only Vietnamese
 nationhood but all of free Asia that stands to
 be ultimately strengthened by the extraor-
 dinary-and still burgeoning-commitment
 of the lives and talent and treasure of Amer-
 ica in Vietnam.

 Government about the great need that exists
 for post vocational high school technical and
 vocational training.
 You know, and I know, that the most suc-
 cessful way to eliminate poverty, misery,
 and disease has been through education.
 American democracy rests on the under-
 standing and effective participation of all
 the people.  This is just as true today as it
 was in the days of our Founding Fathers.
 As  leaders    of  governments  go,  Pueblo
 leaders are indeed silent people.  There is
 little bombast in  a  form  of  government
 which has    been amazingly  sufficient and
 stable these past centuries. However, the
 soft approach should not-be mistaken for
 softness.  Rather it should be interpreted as
 an enduring attitude of peace, one which
 might well be emulated by all of us.
 Perhaps it was this peaceful attitude which
 impressed President Abraham Lincoln and
 prompted him to give belated recognition to
 the  Pueblos.  President  Lincoln  ordered
 ebony silver-crowned canes,   one  for each
 Pueblo, on which were inscribed the year
 "1863"  and  his  name,  "A   Lincoln, Pres.
 U.S.A." ' These canes were transmitted  to
 the Pueblos as symbols of their sovereignty,
 extending continuing authority and commis-
 sion for their popular form of government so
 long satisfactory in serving their  admin-
 istrative needs.
 This great man's faith in your ability to
 unite for the common good is vindicated to-
 day more than ever before.  He would be
 pleased with the preamble to your constitu-
 tion :
 "We, the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico,
 members of the existing all Indian Pueblo
 Council, by virtue of our sovereign rights as
 Pueblo Indians and in accordance with our
 ancient customs and laws, in order to pro-
 mote justice and encourage the common wel-
 fare, to foster the social and economic ad-
 vancement of all the Pueblo Indians, to pre-
 serve and protect our common interests, our
 inherent rights of self-government, and our
 rights guaranteed to us by treaties, laws, and
 the  Federal  Government  of  the  United
 States of America, do ordain and adopt this
 constitution and bylaws for the All-Indian
 Pueblo Council for the common benefit of all
 Pueblo Indians."
 That is a beautiful statement of a demo-
 cratic people.  Again, I congratulate you on
 this historic day, and wish you well in your
 daily efforts to perfect the democratic way
 of life.
 'DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST U.S.
 POLICY IN. VIETNAM
 Mr. PEARSON.  Mr. President, the
 demonstrations across the country pro-
 testing our policy in Vietnam illustrate,
 it seems to me, the price and sometimes
 the tortures of freedom itself.
 The right of public protest, of peti-
 tion, of free speech, of organizing and
 directing marches-assuming no local
 or Federal laws are broken-involves also
 the right to be wrong, to be mistaken, and
 even to be misled. Freedom in our sys-
 tem requires that they be tolerated.
 Last week, over 100,000 students and
 protesters turned out in several cities
 to wave placards and shout slogans.
 Perhaps 100,000 "kooks" and nitwits out
 of nearly 200 million people in this coun-
 try is a tiny minority.  But they can do
 serious harm.  They harm the source
 of freedom by which their actions are to
 be tolerated.  For example:
 They offer an opportunity for Com-
 munist and left wing extremists to in-
 filtrate such movements.
 There is a real danger that Hanoi and
 Peiping will misread these demonstra-
 tions; that they will hope for disunity
 in our Government, believe that it exists
 and thereby prolong the war with mount-
 ing casualties.
 And lastly, these demonstrations choke
 off and,silence demonstrations of many
 honest and conscientious citizens who
 have many serious questions about our
 Vietnam policy.  These responsible peo-
 ple engaged in a responsible debate con-
 cerning the welfare of our country should
 not be associated with such irresponsible
 protests.
 TRIBUTE  TO      THE  LATE  CLAUDE
 SCHECKEL, OFFICIAL REPORTER
 OF DEBATES IN THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES
 Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr. President, Mem-
 bers of the Congress value and appre-
 ciate the very excellent permanent staff
 assistants who perform the very impor-
 tant jobs which provide the coordination
 and continuity for what would other-
 wise be the actions of separate legisla-
 tors.  The House of Representatives and
 Senate were recently saddened by the
 death of one of these valued associates,
 Mr. Claude Scheckel, an official reporter
 of debates for 20 years.
 Mr. Scheckel, who was also the father
 of a former member of my staff, Mrs.
 Jeanne Butler, was born March 25,
 1892, in Alton, Iowa.  In Alton, he grew
 up with two boys who, while they sepa-
 rated in their early adult lives, ended
 together in the House of Representatives
 in later life.  One of these boyhood
 friends was Representative Hoeven, who
 retired from the House last year.  The
 second was the present distinguished
 Chaplain of the House of Representa-
 tives, Dr. Bernard Braskamp. The third
 was Mr. Scheckel, who became an official
 reporter of debates.
 Mr. Scheckel left Alton to attend the
 Kent College of Law in Chicago.  He
 served overseas in World War I and re-
 turned to become an assistant state's
 attorney in Chicago.  It was there also
 that he met and married the lady who
 became  Mrs.   Scheckel.  He  was ap-
 pointed an official reporter of debates in
 the House  by the late and honored
 Speaker Sam Rayburn 20 years ago, and
 served there until his retirement last
 year.  His unfortunate death occurred
 by drowning while he was on a fishing
 trip in Canada.  He was buried at Ar-
 lington Cemetery with military honors.
 Ironically, considering his affection for
 the Speaker, his funeral took place on
 what would have been the 25th anniver-
 sary of Mr. Rayburn's service as Speak-
 er of the House, September 16.
 We regret the passing of Mr. Scheckel,
 and I know Members of the Congress
 join with me in addressing our sympathy
 to his family and our appreciation for
 his good and able service to the Congress
 and to the people of the United States.
 TRIBUTE TO JACK VALENTI
 Mr. DODD.  Mr. President, no one in
 this country is giving more of his time,
 his energy, and his imagination to ad-
 vancing our national purpose, with less
 public recognition, than Mr. Jack Valenti,
 President Johnson's Special Assistant,
 valued adviser, and confidant.
 It has been my personal privilege and
 pleasure to know Jack Valenti and his
 lovely wife and family.
 I have known many good men during
 my public career, but I have admired and
 respected  no man more  than  Jack
 Valenti.
 Our country is very fortunate that
 Jack Valenti is in the White House as
 President Johnson's Special Assistant..
 Therefore, I was pleased to note in the
 Washington Post of October 17, a column
 by the distinguished William S. White
 entitled  "Valenti's  Service."   That
 column gave long-overdue credit to Jack
 Valenti's enormous competence, energy,
 and devotion to public service.
 I ask unanimous consent to have the
 text of Mr. White's column inserted at
 this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 VALENTI'S  SERVICE  BRUSHED  OFF  Too  LONG
 (By William S. White)
 An accumulation of 2 years of fatigue
 from what is surely the most brutally de-
 manding job in the world is not only delay-
 ing-though                                                                                                                                  not      really  threatening-the
 complete   recovery  of  President  Johnson
 from his surgical operation.
 It is also adding to the already heavy bur-
 dens borne by the President's staff people-
 and to none more than to that extraordi-
 narily able man of all work who is Jack
 Valenti.
 Some men are said to be accident prone;
 continuously they suffer the small, tiresome
 mishaps of life.  Valenti might be said' to
 be stereotype-ridden, to be pursued by hos-
 tile cliches,  Though nobody is closer to the
 President or more nearly indispensable to
 him, Jack Valenti seems fated to be con-
 stantly brushed off with the adjective that
 patronizes.
 His admiration for and devotion to the
 President  are  quite  open;  ergo,  he must
 therefore be servile-a kind of valet.
 He is short and compact;  ergo, he's de-
 scribed as little or swarthy, and his natural
 kindliness and courtesy are put down as
 mere efforts by one J. Valenti to ingratiate
 himself.
 He was in prior life an advertising man;,
 ergo, it follows that he must be an insensi-
 tive huckster.  The fact that he is nothing
 of the kind but rather is a skillful and per-
 ceptive writer and editor of much White
 House  prose-indeed,  the  ultimate  editor
 short of the President himself-is not men-
 tioned.
 His undergraduate degree was awarded by
 the University of Houston, which tragically
 has no hallowed halls, no hanging ivy; hence
 it follows that he is not really and truly an
 honest-to-God intellectual.   The fact that
 he made up for his disastrous failure to
 attend  the  right  college   by  earning  a
 master's degree at good old Harvard itself is
 not mentioned.
 Indeed the story of Jack Valenti would
 form an excellent case study chapter in any
 inquest upon one of the phenomena of cur-
 rent politics.  This is the power of snobbery
 within the Democratic Party-precisely the
 kind of snobbery, by the way, so long di-
 rected from within against both Presidents
 Truman and Johnson.
 The self-consciously "in" people make a
 profession of screeching against the evils of
 discrimination, but apply the most juvenile
 prejudices in their estimates of other men.

 PUEBLOS OF NEW MEXICO  SIGN
 NEW CONSTITUTION
 Mr. HARRIS.  Mr. President, the dis-
 tinguished junior Senator from New
 Mexico [Mr. MONTOYA] was out in his
 home State last weekend to speak at a
 uniquely American ceremony.
 I am referring to the program at
 Santo Domingo Pueblo on Saturday, Oc-
 tober 16, 1965, near Albuquerque, in
 which representatives of the self-govern-
 ing Pueblos in New Mexico met to sign
 their all-Pueblo constitution.
 I know of no man in America who has
 more at heart the interests of American
 Indians than does the distinguished
 junior Senator from New Mexico.  Be-
 cause of his great work in that field, we
 recently had him out to Oklahoma for the
 formation of Oklahoma for Indian oppor-
 tunity, and he made a greatspeech there.
 At the Santo Domingo meeting on Oc-
 tober 16, the Pueblos banded together
 in a federation which is akin to the Fed-
 eral system of the United States.  The
 all-Pueblo  constitution  declares that
 each local Pueblo retains its historic
 rights of self-government, and at the
 same time all Pueblo Indians will work
 together on problems common to all of
 them.
 The junior Senator from New Mexico
 [Mr. MONTOYA] captured the spirit of
 this particular occasion very well in his
 speech.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous
 consent that his remarks be printed in
 the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the speech
 of the junior Senator from New Mexico
 [Mr. MONTOYA] was ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 REMARKS SY THE HONORABLE JOSEPH M. MON-
 TOYA AT THE CONSTITUTION SIGNING CERE-
 MONY OF THE ALL-PUEBLO COUNCIL, SANTO
 DOMINGO PUEBLO, N. MEX., OCTOBER 16, 1965
 Chairman  MONTOYA. Ladies and gentle-
 ment, I am honored that you have invited
 me to join with you for this historic occa-
 Bion.
 It is not often that one has the oppor-
 tunity to participate in the signing of a con-
 stitution for a freedom-loving people.  The
 writing and signing of a constitution is one
 of the supreme acts which a democratic peo-
 ple can perform, and when the occasion is
 the signing of a constitution for the first
 Americans, it is a particularly noteworthy
 day.
 In one sense, however, this new statement
 of the democratic way of life is but an ex-
 tension of the long and honored history of
 the Pueblo peoples.  On countless occasions
 in the past, you have banded together for
 the common good, and for common protec-
 tion against the dangers which threatened
 you from without.
 The occasion today represents still another
 manifestation of the united front which the
 Pueblo leaders will present for the common
 good of the Pueblo people.  In this light,
 permit me to touch briefly on certain activ-
 ities involving the Pueblo Indians as these
 activities relate to the Indians t':esnselves
 and to the State of New Mexico and the
 Federal Government.
 Jurisdictional problems, especially in law
 enforcement, have in past years caused some
 feelings of irritation  between  the various
 governmental levels within the State, but
 I must say that vast progress in solving this
 problem has been made.      The Pueblos have
 made great strides in establishing uniform
 codes for traffic control, as well as in civil
 and criminal cases.
 The courts and court proceciuics of the
 Pueblo  of Lague:  might well  be used as
 models for many other jurisdictions, Pueblo
 and State alike.
 The past 20 yc,,rc have reel considerable
 improvement in relationships between the
 Pueblo  and  adjacent  communities.   This
 spirit of- fellowship displayed between the
 law enforcement agencies of the  different
 jurisdictions is highly commendable.
 I think it is worthy of note that in the
 past few years the Federal Government has
 been able to increase its law enforcement
 assistance to you from a staff made up of
 one special officer, to its present strength of
 10 officers.
 Another important sign of progress is the
 development of your road systems.
 Roads are the initial step in the develop-
 ment                                                                                 of  any community.   This was  true
 when the Romans accomplished their monu-
 mental road building projects throughout
 Europe, and it is true today.  The Pueblos
 of New Mexico have contributed to progress
 by giving rights-of-way to the State for the
 building of many of its main arteries.  In
 doing this, the Pueblos have demonstrated
 a great deal of insight. What is good for
 the Pueblos is good for the State, and what
 is good for the State is, likewise, good for
 the Pueblos.
 Reports on range and agriculture land
 development  have  also  been  encouraging.
 Plans for this year include land rehabilita-
 tion and distribution on 335 acres at Isleta
 and 150 acres at Cochiti, to add to the nearly
 5,000 acres which  have  been rehabilitated
 to date at the Pueblos in the middle Rio
 Grande  Valley.   Concrete  ditch  lining  is
 planned, also, at San Ildefonso and Taos.
 It is apparent from reports reaching my
 office that Indian livestock men are becom-
 ing increasingly aware of the importance of
 efficient range  and  herd  management     to
 achieve a more profitable livestock business.
 A major project this year will be emphasis on
 proper range management in order to be
 able to provide much needed range water
 developments.
 Last year, a sheepshearing school for In-
 dian trainees was held at Fort Wingate, un-
 der the sponsorship of the Manpower Devel-
 opment Training Act.  Twenty-six men par-
 ticipated In the training-i2 from Laguna
 and Acoma, 14 from the Navajo peoples.
 Nearly all of the Laguna-Acoma trainees are
 utilizing their training, and several have ob-
 tained Economic Opportunity Act loans to
 purchase shearing equipment.  The trainees
 are shearing approximately 100 head of sheep
 per day at 25 cents per head, each averaging
 $25 per day.
 Recreation developments, too, promise to
 usher In a new economic era for the Pueblos.
 The State of New Mexico and many Federal
 agencies have long recognized the recreation
 resources potential of the State, and have
 emphasized this by giving full support to the
 construction of the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge.
 As you know, this bridge will open lines of
 communication to a potential recreation area
 that will include the Navajo Dam, the San
 Juan diversion, and the Cochiti Dam, as well
 as reservoirs and lakes of lesser size scattered
 throughout the general land area.
 The Indian Pueblos, in preparing their
 10-year programs and overall economic de-
 velopment plans, have taken cognizance of
 the State's emphasis on recreation develop-
 ment. -  They  are  coordinating  recreation
 plans with those of the State.  This can be
 specifically noted on two sizable projects.
 One is the Cochiti Dam, a Corps of En-
 gineers    flood and  sedimentation control
 project that will cost $58 million. The proj-
 ect by congressional authorization provides
 for a permanent pool of 1,200 surface acres,
 with most of the project lying within the
 boundaries of the Cochiti Indian Reserva-
 tion, approximately 50 miles north of Al-
 buquerque.
 The recreation and tourism area will ex-
 tend from the Cochiti Dam to State Highway
 4, via the beautiful Valle Grande area to Los
 Alamos, the Santa Clara Canyon and Puye
 Cliff Dwelling areas on the Santa Clara Res-
 ervation, the Bandelier National Monument,
 and north to the receration areas being de-
 veloped by the San Juan diversion project
 and the Navajo Dam.
 In another instance, the Sandia ski area
 in the Sandia Mountains, approximately 15
 miles northeast of Albuquerque, in 1985 con-
 tracted for a multimillion-dollar tramway
 that will traverse the west side of the Sandia
 Mountains upward to the mountain crest.
 The tramway access from State Highway 422
 is by way of a cooperative Bureau of Indian
 Affairs and State highway road across In-
 dian land.
 The recreation development for all Pueblo
 reservations,  including the  Pueblos  south
 and southwest of Albuquerque, varies in size
 from major development projects such as
 those mentioned to projects that can ex-
 pect no more than 10,000 to 15,000 visita-
 tions each year.  Overall, the improvement
 in economic cohdition of most Pueblos and
 adjacent communities will be  substantial.
 The Pueblos' contribution to developing the
 recreation potential of the State, now a sleep-
 ing giant, is well recognized.
 It is gratifying to note that the Pueblo
 Indians  have shared in  the  funds   made
 available through President Johnson's anti-
 poverty program.  This program has con-
 tributed significantly to the economic ad-
 vancement of the Pueblo Indians.
 So far, five community action programs
 have been approved for our Indian com-
 munities.  These five programs are offering
 literacy instruction, job training, and em-
 ployment counseling.  My office has received
 many  inquiries  about community  action,
 and I am sure that this phase of the war on
 poverty, as well as other related programs,
 has only begun to make itself felt in the
 pueblos.
 I have been informed that many Indian
 people from pueblos have applied to  the
 Farmers Home Administration for loans to
 purchase farm equipment, home improve-
 ments, acquisition of livestock, and to estab-
 lish or supplement a small business opera-
 tion at the reservation community.
 These are only samples of the opportuni-
 ties which exist today for enhancing and
 improving your way of life, and these are
 only samples of the ways in which you have
 made use of your opportunities.
 I could go on and on, but we all know
 what I am talking about.
 But  I do want  to  say  a special  word
 about education, a subject which has been
 close to my heart for many years.
 You  of the pueblos  also recognize  the
 importance of education, as evidenced by the
 number of children you have in school.
 The higher education grants provided for
 Indian children present a unique example
 of acceptance by the Government of a re-
 sponsibility to provide the best in education
 that it possibly can.  This is not merely a
 right of the individual but an obligation of
 the Government.
 I want to take special note of the fact
 that you as officers of your pueblos  have
 long made representations to the Federal
