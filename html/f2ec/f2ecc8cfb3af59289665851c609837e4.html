 surrounding the ouster of Hu Yaobang: What were the causes of his fall?
 What are some of the short-term costs and benefits and potentially more
 serious long-term consequences? And what does this episode say about the
 contradictions within the reform leadership that is trying to modernize
 China? Many of our answers are speculative.
 We have sought to assess information ~

 Key Questions in the Fall of
 China's Hu Yaobang
 Key Judgments We still know relatively little about the events that led to Hu Yaobang's
 Information available dismissal as General Secretary in January 1987. Chinese officials and the
 as of 20 April 1987 Western media have offered a range of explanations from a falling out
 was used in this report.
 between Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and Hu to a conservative attack on
 Deng that forced him to sacrifice Hu.
 We believe that over the last two years Deng gradually lost confidence in his
 protege, Hu Yaobang. In particular, Deng was angered by Hu's repeated
 public gaffes on policy issues, including relations with the United States, and
 apparently had increasing doubts about the abrasive Hu's ability to hold the
 reform coalition together. Indeed, as General Secretary of the party, Hu had
 alienated the old guard with his anticorruption campaign and angered some
 reformers by meddling and by monopolizing patronage. He never did win
 the confidence of the military.
 According to reliable information and press reports, the situation apparently
 became more serious last summer, when longstanding policy differences
 between the two widened, and, most important in our judgment, Hu pressed
 Deng to retire.
 We can only speculate on why Deng advanced his timetable by 10 months. It
 is conceivable that differences over how to respond to the student
 demonstrations in December so angered Deng that he moved immediately.
 We think it more probable, however, that Deng feared Hu would try to
 reverse his ouster by rallying his many supporters before the Congress.
 Conservative leaders undoubtedly lobbied Deng, but we doubt press specula-
 tion that they forced his hand,
 Other Chinese leaders, most notably Deng himself, have bounced back after
 a fall, but we doubt Hu will. He lacks the prestige and widespread respect
 within the party and other important constituencies, especially the military,
 that Deng used to make his own comeback.
 In weighing costs and benefits, we speculate that Deng may have calculated
 that he would gain in the long run by removing the one leader most likely to
 unite the opposition and disrupt the reform camp. By moving when he did,

 Deng may believe he avoided a more bitter showdown at the party congress,
 and that in Zhao he has a man who can repair the damage done to the
 reform program.
 In our judgment, however, Deng has incurred some significant costs. He has:
 ? Shaken the confidence of reform supporters in the party and government,
 especially those identified with Hu, who have worked hard to support
 Deng's policies.
 ? Undercut public faith in the permanence of the reform program, a key to
 its success, and alienated many of the talented people whose cooperation
 and innovative ideas are needed to maintain the program's pace.
 ? Created an opening for conservative opponents of reform to attack both
 the program and its advocates.
 ? Removed an immediate threat to the reform coalition but, paradoxically,
 increased the potential for a power struggle after his death.
 The circumstances of Hu's fall underscore how shallow the roots of reform
 are and illuminate some of the new fissures created by it and the inherent
 contradictions in it-such as the tension between the need for party control
 and the need to decentralize decisionmaking and encourage new ideas. We
 also see a generational cleavage over such basic questions as the pace and
 scope of reform and even divisions among the reformers, with the possibility
 of a split between Hu and Zhao backers. These factors reinforce our belief
 that the party has only a limited capacity to reform itself and devolve power.
 Moreover, when faced with a choice between the risks of a more open policy
 and ensuring control, the party has always opted to assert control
 As we analyze how events may unfold, we start from the basic judgment that
 Deng remains the most powerful figure in China, and that, although the
 conservative forces have gained, Deng, who is still a reformer, is not
 hamstrung by them. The reform camp is under pressure but committed to
 opposing the conservative challenge, and Zhao will, in our judgment, remain
 General Secretary. We believe the following will be important indicators of
 the balance of power in Beijing and the direction of policy:
 ? The choice of premier and other senior personnel appointments. The
 choice of Vice Premier Li Peng, for instance, would suggest conservative
 strength, while the appointment of a party elder like Wan Li could indicate
 an inability to agree on a permanent replacement.

 ? The continuing high visibility of conservative spokesmen and their domi-
 nance of the propaganda apparatus.
 ? The duration and intensity of the current campaign against "bourgeois
 liberalism." Zhao and the reformers are trying hard to restrict and cut
 short this conservative campaign.
 ? The political health of prominent Hu Yaobang associates.
 ? Economic policy pronouncements. The reform camp wants to launch some
 new measures this year but would probably settle for protecting existing
 policies. The struggle for control of this area will probably be one of the
 most intense.
 ? Antiforeign, particularly anti-Western, articles in the press would suggest
 an increase in conservative influence.
 ? A delay in holding the 13th Party Congress would suggest unbridgeable
 differences in the leadership.
 Absolutely critical in all this is Deng's own assessment of the situation and
 the tactics he chooses to pursue. Deng has voiced his support for reform in
 meetings with several foreign leaders since January, and has said that some
 reform goals such as rejuvenation of the bureaucracies will be on the agenda
 in October. However, he has not yet given a clear indication of what tack he
 might take or what specific plans he might have. As the date for the
 Congress draws closer, his goals-and strength-should become clearer.

 Key Questions in the Fall of
 China's Hu Yaobang
 Why Was Hu Ousted?
 We still know little about the heated debates and
 fierce political infighting within the Chinese leader-
 ship that preceded Hu's ouster in January as party
 General Secretary. Deng may have acted hastily, and
 even in anger, but we doubt that he fired his designat-
 ed heir primarily because of the student unrest or
 conservative pressure. Rather
 we believe that the student
 demonstrations crystallized Deng's determination to
 force Hu out because the two were increasingly at
 odds over power and the succession.
 We believe Hu over the past several years had become
 increasingly impatient with the old guard's clinging to
 power. As a result, he sought to create his own power
 base to ensure his succession to Deng and to exert
 greater influence over policy. In the process, we
 suspect Deng gradually lost confidence in Hu, in part
 because Hu antagonized too many other leaders of the
 reform coalition and in part because of his repeated
 gaffes on foreign policy issues.
 for example, both Chen Yun and
 Zhao Ziyang sharply criticized Hu for acting without
 authorization in publicly warning the United States in
 November 1983 that the impending trip of Premier
 Zhao to Washington might be canceled if the US
 administration did not dissociate itself from a US
 Senate resolution calling for self-determination for
 Taiwan.
 Hu made
 many enemies among party conservatives and the
 military old guard, including those close to Deng, by:
 ? Monopolizing party patronage and aggressively pro-
 moting his own proteges, such as Hu Qili, to
 powerful positions and flaunting his power instead
 of coordinating with and building bridges to the
 other leaders.
 ? Making deprecating remarks about the old guard in
 an interview he gave to a Hong Kong journalist in
 1985. Hu even denigrated the importance of the
 military and especially the party's military commis-
 sion, which Deng heads and that contains many of
 Deng's oldest and closest comrades in arms, such as
 Yang Shangkun and Wang Zhen.
 ? Zealously pursuing the anticorruption campaign in
 1986, especially against a number of children of the
 conservative cadre.
 Hu used the campaign to attack his oppo-
 nents-and even Zhao Ziyang-at a Politburo
 meeting early last year.
 ? Stifling the "spiritual pollution" campaign in 1984
 and encouraging the freewheeling debate in the
 media in the summer of 1986 over political reform
 that some intellectuals used to question the value of
 Marxism and to criticize the role of the Chinese
 Communist Party (CPP)-a debate that triggered
 the current conservative-led campaign against
 Western "bourgeois liberalism."
 Signs of friction between Deng and Hu surfaced as
 early as 1983, when they apparently disagreed over
 the need for a harsh crackdown on intellectuals and
 on crime-two separate but linked campaigns. We
 believe Deng's two-tier plan for the succession, which
 surfaced in the winter of 1984/85, indicated second
 thoughts about Hu's abilities.' At the time, we argued
 that one goal of Deng's plan was to institutionalize the
 succession process and to groom younger leaders in
 whom Deng had confidence to carry the reform
 program into the next century, well after he and other
 senior leaders, including Hu and Zhao, had retired or
 ' On the basis of press I            reporting, we believe that
 Deng had developed a succession package. According to the plan,
 Zhao Ziyang would have assumed the presidency from Li Xian-
 nian; Hu Yaobang would have taken over the Military Affairs
 Commission chairmanship from Deng; Li Peng would have become
 premier; and Hu Qili was slated to become party general secretary.

 Reformers and Conservatives in China:
 What the Terms Mean
 We use the terms "reformer" and "conservative"for
 convenience to describe groupings within the Chinese
 leadership. All members of the leadership in fact are
 reformers who came to power after the fall of the
 Gang of Four in 1976 with the aim of dismantling the
 Maoist system and promoting political and economic
 stability. Very quickly, however, differences in ap-
 proach and goals surfaced, and the leaders began to
 separate into two loosely organized camps. There is
 considerable overlap for instance, there are many
 who are "liberal" on economic reforms but "conser-
 vative" when it comes to political affairs. Deng
 Xiaoping is generally thought of as the chief reform-
 ist, but has recently demonstrated a decidedly conser-
 vative bent in ideological matters.
 The group that we call reformers, liberal reformers,
 or progressives generally favors close relations with
 the West, the introduction of market forces into the
 economy, and a sharp reduction in the party's role in
 economic matters and day-to-day governmental ad-
 ministrative decisions. Its members are more relaxed
 about ideological matters and more tolerant of intel-
 lectuals' tendency to test the limits of dissent. They
 are willing to consider extensive revisions of the
 died. But we also speculated that Deng may have been
 trying to ease Hu out by proposing that Hu succeed
 him as chairman of the Military Advisory Commis-
 sion-a move that would have cut Hu off from his
 power base in the party and put him in "charge" of a
 group composed mainly of Deng's cronies. Indeed, we
 suspect Deng feared that the abrasive, tactless, and
 impulsive Hu could not manage the reform program
 and hold together the disparate elements of the
 coalition he had forged. Deng may well have conclud-
 ed that, if Hu succeeded him, the leadership would
 separate into factions and become embroiled in a
 power struggle that might destroy all he had sought to
 build.
 political system for example, real elections for dele-
 gates to the provincial people's congresses ("legisla-
 tures" that have some advisory role but are largely
 rubberstamp bodies).
 Those we lump together as conservatives or tradition-
 alists want to maintain a strong role for central
 planning in the economy, though they are willing to
 experiment with market forces around the margins.
 They recognize the need for Western technology and
 access to our markets, but some believe China should
 improve relations with the Soviet Union-especially
 in trade, so China can obtain some of what it needs
 without using scarce hard currency reserves. They
 believe that dissent should be strictly controlled and
 that intellectuals should look to the party for guid-
 ance. Most favor closer party oversight of economic
 and governmental matters than do the "reformers, "
 and they do not believe an overhaul of the political
 system is necessary or advisable. A common thread
 in their thinking is fear of instability if party control
 is weak.
 Since Hu's dismissal, additional information has sur-
 faced to support this speculation. It now appears that
 Deng and Hu had become increasingly estranged
 until, by early last fall, their relationship reached the
 breaking point. Two recently acquired accounts indi-
 cate that Deng had already decided and gained
 preliminary party approval last November-well be-
 fore the student demonstrations-to replace Hu with
 Zhao as party chief at the 13th Party Congress in
 October 1987. Press reports
 indicate there were heated exchanges last summer at
 the leadership meetings at Beidaihe over political

 again refused to accept Hu. In a slightly different
 account, the Japanese press reported that Hu refused
 to take the job, which suggests he may have been
 angry that Deng had not offered him a more impor-
 tant and influential post in exchange for giving up his
 position as party General Secretary. Other Japanese
 press reports indicate that Hu pressed Deng last
 September to retire and give him the chairmanship of
 the Central Advisory Commission. Deng reportedly
 solicited the support of many of the old guard to turn
 aside Hu's demand.
 Two other events in retrospect point to rising tensions
 between Hu and Deng:
 ? In the fall of 1986 Deng began to signal that he
 would not retire as soon as he had planned, citing
 calls from many within the party for him to stay on.
 In an interview with an American newsman in
 September 1986, Deng said he hoped to retire at the
 13th Party Congress, but probably would not be
 able to do so.
 ? Last fall, Zhao's appointment as the head of the
 "political reform leading group," directed to come
 up with proposals for implementing political reform,
 may have been another sign of Hu's slipping posi-
 Why Did Deng Decide To Remove Hu in
 Mid-January?
 We can only speculate on the reasons. It is possible
 that differences over the student demonstrations may
 have brought the tensions between Hu and Deng to a
 flashpoint. Hu acknowledged he had made mistakes
 in a self-criticism he gave at a leadership meeting on
 the demonstrations in early January, according to
 some press reports, but these accounts also suggest Hu
 adopted a defiant rather than a repentant tone. That
 may have fueled Deng's anger and provoked him to
 demand Hu's immediate resignation.
 We suspec
 that it is more likely that Deng moved because he
 feared that Hu planned to rally his supporters within
 the party between now and the party congress to try to
 reverse Deng's decision to replace him. Hu, in fact,
 has salted the party, including the central party
 organs, with many of his supporters and could well
 have mounted a damaging challenge to Deng's power.
 Press reports claim Hu was pressing Deng to retire,
 and we know that someone in the leadership ordered
 Chinese officials abroad to poll their units on whether
 Deng ought to retire. Hence, Deng may have seen a
 mounting threat and believed he had to take preemp-
 tive action. As it was, the US Embassy in Beijing;
 heard that Deng was unable at a meeting of the
 Politburo in December/January to gain a decisive
 vote against Hu and, therefore, called an extraordi-
 nary "enlarged" Politburo meeting, packed with his
 supporters, to oust Hu and demonstrate his power.
 Could Hu's Conservative Opponents Have Forced
 Deng's Hand?
 One line of speculation in the Western press is that
 conservatives such as Chen Yun and Peng Zhen, or a
 broader cross section of the old guard, forced Deng to
 oust Hu. Given the list of Hu's enemies, it would be
 surprising if they had not been trying to undermine
 him.                                Hu came
 under increasing attack from conservatives in the
 summer and fall of 1986 for encouraging media
 debate on political reforms, which ultimately contrib-
 uted to the demonstrations. We suspect that some
 members of the old guard, including those close to

 Deng who generally support the reform program,
 criticized Hu for lending legitimacy to heretical ideas
 that they feared would undermine the authority of the
 party. Deng probably shared their concern, judging by
 the way he lashed out at the three intellectuals Fang
 Lizhi, Liu Binyan, and Wang Ruowang-he ordered
 them expelled from the party for encouraging the
 students. We believe many other conservatives were
 more concerned about Hu's anticorruption campaign,
 which targeted a number of their children. Opposition
 to Hu from these disparate elements could have
 coalesced in the wake of the student demonstrations,
 compelling Deng to sacrifice Hu to protect himself
 and the reform program.
 We doubt, however, that Deng would have acquiesced
 in Hu's removal if he had not concluded that Hu had
 become a political liability and a threat to his author-
 ity. The reports of differences between Deng and Hu
 since the fall of 1986 and of the decision to name
 Zhao to replace Hu indicate that Deng had already
 made the decision to dump Hu. Although the popular
 perception in China seems to be that the conservatives
 forced Deng's hand, we believe he needed little
 encouragement.
 What Role Did Zhao Ziyang Play in Hu's Downfall?
 We have no evidence that Zhao played a role in
 engineering Hu's ouster, although we believe neither
 Zhao nor his supporters are entirely unhappy to see
 Hu go. We suspect that many of Zhao's supporters
 and perhaps Zhao himself did not hold Hu in high
 regard and probably resented his attempts to meddle
 in economic policy matters. Over the longer run,
 moreover, Zhao stands to gain the most by Hu's
 departure. He appears to have the inside track as
 Deng's eventual successor, if he plays his cards skill-
 fully. Zhao's reputation as an able administrator; his
 moderate, balanced style; and the fact that,
 he has had amicable personal
 relations with the old guard favor him and are
 probably why Deng chose him to replace Hu. He now
 has the unenviable job, however, of trying to repair
 the damage and keep the reform program he strongly
 supports from stalling.

 Secret
 Can Hu Make a Comeback?
 Although Hu has Deng's own history as a model, we
 believe he is more likely to go the way of his
 immediate predecessor Hua Guofeng, who has be-
 come all but invisible since he fell from power in 1981.
 In our opinion, Hu lacks the prestige and the wide-
 spread respect within the party and other important
 constituencies, especially the military, that Deng had
 when he made his comeback. Thus, although many
 party cadre owe their positions to Hu's patronage, we
 believe a good many will soon begin to shift their
 allegiances to other leaders, if they have not already
 done so. Hu Qili, Hu's heir apparent as party chief,
 has already sought to distance himself from Hu
 Yaobang. We believe, moreover, that Zhao is putting
 out lines to Hu's supporters. In late January speech
 Zhao appeared to be making an elliptical appeal that
 Figure 3. Zhao Ziyang concur-
 rently serves as Premier and
 Acting Party General Secre-
 At a minimum, we believe Deng has removed the one
 personnel issue that united conservatives in the party
 and the Army-opposition to Hu's succeeding Deng.
 Although Zhao by virtue of his new position is likely
 to be a target of some conservative criticism, Deng
 may calculate that he is in a better position to divide
 and conquer conservatives on policy and personnel
 issues. If so, we would expect him to begin soon to
 curb the conservative-led antibourgeois liberalization
 campaign. Zhao's efforts to limit the campaign to the
 party and his declaration that reform policies are off
 limits may, in fact, reflect Deng's effort to do just
 they come over to his side.
 What Did Deng Gain by Cashiering Hu?
 From Deng's perspective, he has removed the one
 leader most likely to disrupt his efforts to maintain a
 consensus between reformers and conservatives on an
 overall (albeit gradual) reform course. By removing
 Hu in January, moreover, Deng may have:
 ? Forestalled a much more bitter and potentially
 destabilizing fight at the October party congress.
 ? Avoided a party-wrenching purge of Hu's
 supporters.
 ? Bought time for the reform wing to close ranks and
 work out a new modus vivendi with conservatives
 that allows the Dengists to continue to control the
 reform agenda.
 that.
 Deng may even calculate that he can use the concern
 aroused at home and abroad by dumping Hu to force
 agreement at the top on how to proceed. Deng has
 always stressed the importance of stability and has
 believed the reforms needed to be carried out gradual-
 ly, on an experimental basis. In the wake of the
 student demonstrations, we believe he is telling the
 reformers to avoid the kind of headlong disruptive
 pace Hu Yaobang advocated-a message also de-
 signed to co-opt conservative criticism while telling
 conservatives the reform program will continue. Deng
 has also sought to discourage student and particularly
 worker activism by sending a strong signal that he will
 not tolerate threats to stability and party control.
 What Costs Has Deng Incurred by Firing Hu?
 Whatever Deng's gains in the long term, he will, in
 our judgment, pay a high price in at least the short
 run for cashiering Hu the way he did. The cumulative
 impact of firing Hu, the expulsion of three liberal
 intellectuals from the party, and the subsequent con-
 servative-led campaign against "bourgeois liberalism"
 have, in our judgment, shaken the confidence of
 reform supporters in the party and bureaucracy--
 especially those identified with Hu Yaobang, who
 have worked hard to implement policies Deng sup-
 ports. In the short run, at least, they will be looking
 mainly for ways to protect themselves rather than
 continuing to push reform. Hu Qili, a Hu protege and

 Secret
 secretary, has already begun to take a more conserva-
 tive line in public. And so to a lesser extent has
 another Hu protege, Minister of Culture Wang Meng.
 Even if most of Hu's supporters survive the present
 uncertainty, we wonder whether they will be prepared
 to promote reform as aggressively as they did before
 Hu's fall.
 We have long believed that the success of Deng's
 program depends heavily on convincing all Chinese,
 especially the talented, that the policies will not
 change and that it is safe to be an advocate of reform.
 In our judgment, the purge of the top reformer is a
 major blow to this effort. The initial reaction among
 many intellectuals and students-whose cooperation
 and ideas the reformers need to maintain the momen-
 tum of China's modernization drive-has been in-
 creased cynicism and disillusionment, according to
 the US Embassy in Beijing. Deng and Zhao are likely
 to have greater difficulty tapping the talents of these
 groups, which we believe will be more wary now of
 advocating new approaches to problems for fear of
 becoming the victims of conservative attacks. Several
 accounts also indicate that some party members in
 overseas posts are confused and shocked over Hu's
 resignation and may be looking for ways to avoid
 returning to China.
 Conservatives at all levels of the party, in our view,
 will attempt to take advantage of this opportunity to
 stall or roll back reforms they oppose. We believe
 local party secretaries, who saw their authority erod-
 ing as a result of the factory manager responsibility
 system, probably have already begun to reassert
 themselves. Resistance from lower levels of the party
 was a major obstacle to the implementation of the
 urban reform program even before Hu's fall. In fact,
 it was a key reason Deng himself called last year for
 "political structural reforms" to remove party hacks
 from interfering in day-to-day economic decision
 making. We believe the almost inevitable postpone-
 ment of political reforms will make this resistance just
 that much harder to overcome.
 Foreign firms will probably think even harder about
 investing in China as long as the domestic situation
 remains unclear, and especially as long as the current
 attacks on Western ideas and some reform leaders for
 taking the "capitalist road" continue. New investment
 had already declined sharply in 1986, in part because
 of foreign companies' concern over the profitability of
 operations in China and the lack of adequate legal
 safeguards for their investments.
 Perhaps most serious, we believe, is the damage Deng
 has done to his efforts to institutionalize power, which
 he saw as important for ensuring leadership stability
 and protecting his modernization plans. With his own
 succession plans in tatters, the potential for a power
 struggle after his death is probably much greater.
 Deng and Zhao recognize the harm Hu's ouster has
 caused and are trying to limit the damage. Both men
 have repeatedly stated publicly that China's opening
 to the outside will not change. According to a pro-
 China newspaper in Hong Kong, Zhao also has taken
 steps privately to limit the impact of the current
 antibourgeois liberalism campaign and to reassure
 intellectuals that there will not be a widespread party
 purge. In his public appearances since his purge, Zhao
 has repeatedly voiced his determination to prevent the
 campaign from affecting economic reforms or turning
 into a disruptive political movement like those of the
 past.
 Hu's downfall reminds us that, despite nearly 10 years
 of reforms, important features of Chinese politics-
 especially the nature of power-have not changed
 much under Deng. More important, we believe it
 highlights inherent contradictions within the reform
 leadership-not just between moderate and more
 conservative reform advocates but also among moder-
 ates themselves over such basic issues as the pace and
 scope of reform, the role of the party, and power
 sharing. These contradictions raise questions-many
 of which we cannot answer at present with any
 confidence-about the prospects over the longer term
 for China's reformers in implementing far-reaching
 systemic changes-particularly those that weaken the

 power of the party  and even about the durability of
 some existing reforms. Given the present uncertainty,
 our observations are intended less to answer these
 questions than to stimulate further debate and
 analysis.
 Power
 A principal aim of the reform program has been to
 ensure that there would never be a repetition of the
 chaos of the Cultural Revolution, which many Chi-
 nese leaders blamed on the concentration of power in
 the hands of one man, Mao Zedong. To this end,
 Deng has sought ways to vest power in positions
 rather than in men, to institutionalize collective lead-
 ership, and to regularize the transfer of power. Deng's
 ouster of Hu demonstrates not only how weak the new
 institutional and legal structures created by reform
 are, but also to what a great extent individual power
 depends on personal connections rather than on one's
 official position. Deng, who was nominally Hu's sub-
 ordinate--although no one in or out of China ever
 took that seriously-ousted him by drawing on a
 network of supporters among powerful party elders
 built up over many years.
 That many of these party elders no longer occupy any
 important official position underscores this point. Hu
 spent years building a network of supporters down
 through the party, and his associates dominated all
 the key party organs. This was of little use to him in
 the end because he failed to build strong personal ties
 across the top. The events of December and January
 make it plain that the concentration of authority in
 one man, in this case Deng  and consequently that
 man's ability to do great harm or great good  is likely
 to remain characteristic of the Chinese system for the
 foreseeable future.
 The episode also demonstrates that, although the
 broad political influence of the military has been
 reduced under Deng, its support is still necessary for
 succession arrangements. Many of Deng's confidants
 are military elders; Hu's failure to win their respect
 was a major factor in Deng's loss of confidence in
 him. We do not believe the military can impose its
 choices on the party as a whole, but what happened to
 Hu indicates that it can probably block arrangements
 that it strongly opposes
 Finally, the struggle between Deng and IN highlights
 a major contradiction in Deng's attempt to institute
 succession arrangements. For them to work, we be-
 lieve Deng himself must be willing to step down,
 relinquish power, and allow his successors to assume
 full authority--something neither he nor other party
 elders have been willing to do. When faced with a
 choice in January 1987 between protecting his power
 or upholding a fragile constitution and legal system he
 has helped put in place, Deng chose to protect his
 power, thereby undermining both his succession ar-
 rangements and the very institutions he has sought to
 strengthen.
 We suspect Deng has rationalized his decision to
 dump Hu as necessary to protect the reforms, and he
 may also believe he has become indispensable to the

 reforms. In our opinion, other senior leaders eager to
 retain their power will certainly encourage him to
 believe so because they realize that if Deng retires
 they would be under intense pressure to follow. The
 implication of this may be that Deng may be even
 more reluctant to entrust great power to others and
 will, in turn, have a much more difficult time con-
 structing viable succession arrangements. Indeed, in
 our judgment, any chosen successor-whether it is
 Zhao Ziyang or someone else-will have to labor
 under some of the same burdens Hu did. That is, he is
 likely to be dependent on Deng's support and become
 a target for those opposed to reform and thus a
 potential scapegoat when problems arise. Any succes-
 sor, moreover, will have to accumulate power much
 the way Deng has, by establishing lateral as well as
 vertical networks of support within the party and state
 bureaucracy. Yet he will have to tread carefully lest
 he arouse the suspicion and distrust of Deng and other
 party elders.
 Sharpening Contradictions
 We believe Hu's fall and the conservative offensive
 illuminate the inherent contradictions in the reform
 program and new fissures created by it. The senior
 leaders most responsible for shaping China's reform
 program since 1980-Deng, Chen Yun, Hu Yaobang,
 and Zhao Ziyang-all agreed at the outset on the
 central goal of their modernization drive: to create an
 economically strong and powerful China capable
 sometime in the next century of playing a major role
 in international affairs. They probably also agreed on
 key elements of a basic strategy: to promote science
 and technology; to expand economic ties to the outside
 world, particularly the West; and to attract foreign
 investment and technical expertise. But, as the reform
 program has unfolded and new problems have
 emerged, the thinking, particularly of some of the
 younger reformers, has evolved, creating, in our judg-
 ment, a generational cleavage over such basic ques-
 tions as the pace and scope of the reform program.
 Although Deng and more conservative party elders
 clearly disagree on some key issues, we believe they
 are agreed that the reform program should remain
 firmly grounded in Marxism, and that they are trying
 to create a socialist society with "Chinese characteris-
 tics." They agree that borrowing from capitalist soci-
 eties is permissible but that to "go too far" would be a
 betrayal of all they have fought for during the
 revolution and since, and that the party must retain a
 central role in China's modernization drive-which
 underscores our belief that the party has only a
 limited capacity to reform itself and devolve power.
 Some of the younger reformers-encouraged by both
 Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang-have been much
 more willing to stray from Marxist ideological moor-
 ings, in order to allow greater experimentation and
 even questioning of basic principles in the pursuit of
 effective policies. They seem more willing to entertain
 the possibility of promoting greater pluralism and
 allowing greater dissent than do party elders.
 One issue that Deng and Hu parted company on was
 the issue of how much latitude to give intellectuals to
 express their views and even to criticize the party. We
 believe Hu tended to see such criticism as healthy and
 not as a threat to the party's power. Deng and other
 party elders, however, did not. In our view, it points
 up one of the dilemmas party leaders have always
 faced: how to harness the support of intellectuals
 without relinquishing too much control. Whenever
 faced with a choice between ensuring control and
 giving intellectuals more freedom, the leadership has
 always opted to assert control, which has disillusioned
 and alienated many intellectuals.

 Secret
 Deng and Hu have been closely associated since
 before the founding of the People's Republic of China
 in 1949. During the 1930s both men served together
 in the 8th Route Army, the prestigious army that
 fought in many of the Chinese civil war's most
 famous battles, and they made the Long March
 together. After 1949 both men assumed party posts in
 Sichuan Province. In 1952 Deng and Hu were trans-
 ferred to Beijing-Deng as a vice premier and Hu as
 head of the Chinese Communist Youth League.
 While serving as director of the CYL, Hu aided
 Deng 's efforts to promote economic and political
 ideas more liberal than those of CCP Chairman Mao
 Zedong by appointing Deng s supporters to numerous
 grassroots party posts. During the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, Hu's association with Deng-one of the main
 targets of the movement-was a major reason for his
 being purged. Red Guards accused Hu of following
 Deng 's political line and criticized him harshly be-
 cause of the close personal relationship between the
 two men. Among other things, Hu and Deng were
 chastized for questioning Mao's infallibility-and
 also for establishing a private club so they could play
 bridge.
 As hard as Deng and other reform leaders have
 worked to raise the level of political debate and to
 break the old cycle of relaxation and repression, they
 have had only moderate success. Although memories
 of the Cultural Revolution have exerted a moderating
 influence on factionalism, the circumstances of Hu's
 ouster indicate, in our view, that there is still a strong
 tendency among Chinese politicians to seek revenge
 rather than compromise and conciliation. Moreover,
 as the short-lived spiritual pollution campaign of
 1983-84 and the present conservative-led antibour-
 geois liberalization campaign illustrate, the regime
 has a tendency to launch potentially disruptive cam-
 paigns whenever leadership tensions rise. Each new
 campaign, moreover, takes its toll: fueling ancient
 grudges and generating ill will, raising doubts about
 In 1972 Hu returned to political life as a member of
 the National People's Congress Standing Committee;
 Deng's rehabilitation came the following year. During
 the next four years Deng consolidated his position
 within the national bureaucracy partly through the
 support of newly appointed party officials-many of
 whom had been trained in the CYL under Hu. During
 leadership struggles following Mao's death in 1976,
 the two men were again purged, only to be rehabili-
 tated the following year. In 1978 Hu was elected to
 the Politburo, and Deng regained his posts as vice
 chairman of the CCP and Politburo Standing Com-
 mittee member. Two years later Deng had Hu named
 a member of the Politburo's Standing Committee and
 General Secretary of the CCP.
 Throughout their long association, Deng had ample
 time to assess Hu's personality and politics. Indeed,
 we believe that one reason Deng selected Hu for the
 top party job was precisely because of Hu's activist,
 charge-ahead personality and his lack of fear of the
 old guard. While these traits were useful to Deng, he
 protected Hu's position. Even now that Deng has
 moved against Hu, stories circulate that the two men

 reformers' ability to implement their ideas; quite
 possibly setting very narrow limits for future reform
 that could cause the program to stall and stagnate; or,
 less likely, seriously disrupting and discrediting the
 reform program.
 Hu's downfall, moreover, indicates, in our judgment,
 that tensions and differences are not limited to moder-
 ates and conservatives. There are fissures within the

 Figure 6. Hu makes his first public appearance
 since his downfall at the National People's Con-
 Dengist wing of the reform camp as well. The differ-
 ences that emerged between Deng and Hu over how
 much latitude to give intellectuals and, by extension,
 perhaps, what shape "political structural reform"
 should take, is only the most obvious example. We
 believe that friction also existed between Hu and
 Zhao over priorities and methods of achieving reform
 goals. Differences in temperament and responsibility
 explain some of this friction. Hu was impatient and
 impetuous, prone to act rashly. Zhao is much more
 deliberate and cautious. But competition for power-
 who, in fact, will set the agenda at the top-may also,
 in our view, have played a part. Such tensions may be
 reflected in divisions we are unaware of between Hu's
 and Zhao's supporters in the party and the bureaucra-
 cy. It remains to be seen, therefore, whether the
 moderate reformers will be able to pull together to
 fend off the current conservative challenge or whether
 the strains caused by Hu's downfall will create new
 and deeper fissures within the moderate camp itself.
 As we analyze how events may unfold, we start from
 the following four basic judgments about the political
 situation:
 ? The reform camp is increasingly subject to strains
 and divisions but, as a whole, remains committed to
 resisting a challenge from the conservatives.
 ? Party traditionalists have for the moment gained
 ground and will seek to capitalize on their position
 but are not as united and strong as they appear;
 thus, Deng, although he cannot ignore their influ-
 ence, is not hamstrung by them.
 ? Zhao will remain as General Secretary and a new
 premier will be appointed at, or soon after, the
 October party congress.
 Although we believe the precipitating cause of Hu's
 dismissal was his attack on Deng's personal power,
 the incident has renewed the debate over reform
 policy. Each side has advantages and weaknesses.
 Reformers have a proven record in bettering China's
 economic performance, and most Chinese recognize
 that improvements in their standard of living owe
 much to reform policies. A large and diverse group of
 officials, intellectuals, farmers, and resurgent small
 businessmen owe their positions to reform and will
 resist any drastic rollback. Their long dominance of
 central government and party organs has enabled
 reformers to put many of their supporters in positions
 throughout the bureaucracies. Finally, the fact that
 most of the conservative leaders are well over 70 will
 work in the reformers' favor as the elders pass from
 the scene.
 On the other hand, many reform policies are at odds
 either with the socialist tradition that China has
 developed over the past 38 years or with aspects of
 traditional Chinese customs. Reform demands move-
 ment, whereas conservatives have the easier task of
 obstructing or slowing change. Moreover, although
 the beneficiaries of reform have been more prominent,
 there are losers, as well, whose support the conserva-
 tives can enlist. In this group we include, for example,
 many middle-ranking officials and party cadre who
 resent the diminution of their power, some members
 of the military who distrust the rapid pace of reform,
 workers who do not welcome changes in the system of

 lifetime employment, and farmers who prefer the
 security of a more controlled rural economy-and
 who have not prospered as much as their neighbors
 under reform.
 We see four scenarios possible in the wake of Hu's
 dismissal:
 ? The antibourgeois liberalism campaign will contin-
 ue with ritual pronouncements in the press, but
 reformers will quickly reassert themselves. Howev-
 er, because of economic problems, the reformers will
 proceed cautiously and not initiate any dramatic
 new reforms.
 ? Conservatives will continue to exert influence for
 several months, but reformers will be able to re-
 group by next October's party congress and will
 largely succeed in controlling policy by then.
 We do not know how much Deng may have been
 weakened by recent events, or whether, in fact, re-
 moving Hu's divisive influence will prove a net gain.
 Although he has affirmed his support for reform in     25X1
 general terms, Deng has not yet made clear what his
 next steps will be or what sort of reforms he is willing
 to back. As preparations for the party congress go
 forward, Deng's position-in particular, whether he
 has had to cede significant influence to old-guard
 conservatives-should become clearer. We will be
 looking, for example, for evidence that he is taking a
 personal role in shaping the agenda and personnel
 appointments for the 13th Party Congress.
 Other key indicators of the strength of the traditional-
 ist and reform camps include:
 ? A prolonged period of infighting and policy uncer-
 tainty will lead to paralysis and stagnation.
 ? The conservatives will be able to consolidate their
 gains and restrict both the scope and the speed of
 reform.
 Indicators we expect to see in the next few months
 should enable us to track the struggle over power and
 policy. Probably the most important will be the choice
 of a new premier. The selection of a younger, reform-
 minded premier would be a strong indicator that the
 reform camp is still ascendant. The choice of a more
 conservative candidate such as Li Peng would suggest
 at a minimum that the reformers have had to make
 important compromises. Selection of one of the party
 elders, even a reformist like Wan Li, would probably
 mean a deadlock, with neither side able to impose a
 candidate of its choice from the next generation. If
 Zhao relinquishes the party slot and returns to being
 premier-which we believe unlikely-we would see
 that as a sign of dissatisfaction with Zhao's leader-
 ship. In our opinion, the chances of an orderly and
 lasting succession would be reduced.
 25X1
 ? Continued prominence and control of important
 sectors by old-guard retreads. Many traditionalists 25X1
 who had been relegated to the shelf have been
 brought back. If these leaders remain near the
 center of power, it would suggest conservative
 strength.
 ? The duration and intensity of the campaign against
 bourgeois liberalism. Continued play of conservative
 slogans and resurrection of heavily ideological pro-
 paganda themes such as the call to emulate Lei
 Feng, a mythical model soldier of the 1960s, will be
 a sign that the reformers are on the defensive.
 ? Success in containing the purge of Hu Yaobang's
 supporters, as Zhao has called for, would show
 reform strength.

 ? Economic policy pronouncements-recently a num-
 ber of conservative signals have been sent in eco-
 nomic policy. For example, a recent State Council
 circular called for strengthening control over vege-
 table prices and setting a ceiling on the negotiated
 price of grain. Economic factors are also involved in
 the slowing of reforms, but we believe an absence of
 initiatives or a rollback of previously announced
 policies would also indicate increased traditionalist
 political strength.
 ? Although in this area reformers and conservatives
 are probably closer than in domestic policy, changes
 in foreign policy that reflect anti-Western suspicions
 would reflect diminished reformist influence.
 ? Whether the reformers are able to impose their
 agenda on the 13th Party Congress, or are forced to
 postpone the conclave beyond October, will be per-
 haps the most telling evidence of the political situa-
 tion.

 Hu Yaobang speaks to Communist Youth League

 be announced at the September party meetings, ac-
 cording to information reportedly distributed through
 party channels.
 Probably reflecting criticism of Deng's efforts to
 appoint Hu to the Central Military Commission, a
 June Liaowang article cites the historical analogy of
 Zhuge Liang's appointment of Ma Shu as "military
 consultant," despite Ma's tendency to overstate
 things. The article claims that "the appointment of a
 person who indulged in empty talk and exaggeration
 was an important error committed by Zhuge Liang."
 The Japanese press reports in July that Deng tells a
 visiting Japanese legislator that Zhao and Hu will be
 replaced in September.
 Following party conservative Hu Qiaomu's attack in
 the fall on the "Ma Ding" article-which had cited
 limitations of Marxist theories to deal with modern
 economic problems-Hu Yaobang reportedly defends
 the right of academics to publish controversial views.
 Deng Xiaoping reportedly agrees with Hu, and ex-
 tends the protection to writers.
 During key party meetings in September, reformers-
 including Hu Yaobang's proteges-make gains in the
 Central Committee and the Politburo. No movement
 is reported on the plan to replace Hu and Zhao with
 younger leaders, however. Chen Yun attacks the rural
 reform policies for contributing to a decrease in grain
 production in 1985.
 Beijing announces an anticorruption drive under the
 control of the party Secretariat (led by Hu Yaobang)
 aimed at central party, government, and military
 organs. The drive is to last from six months to one
 year. A leading group to deal with corruption in the
 central departments is established at the "8,000 Ca-
 dres," meeting in January. The group is reportedly
 headed by Qiao Shi-frequently linked to Hu Yao-
 bang.
 Deng Xiaoping tells New Zealand Prime Minister
 David Lange in March that "political structural
 reforms" are needed, kicking off a wide-ranging
 discussion on these reforms. Hu Yaobang and Hu Qili
 take the lead in pushing the political reform agenda.
 Evidence of mounting leadership tension over the
 anticorruption campaign includes the reported state-
 ment by Deng in an April Politburo meeting that
 mismanagement of the campaign amounts to a con-
 spiracy to shake the government.
 Deng decides not to press charges
 against a prominent military leader's daughter to
 avoid provoking countercharges from conservatives.
 Qiao Shi is appointed Vice Premier in April "to give
 better guidance to the country's political and legal
 work."
 According to the Hong Kong press, Hu tells a meeting
 in Sichuan in May that 110 to 120 members of the
 Central Committee should be replaced, implying that
 those over 60 should retire-an indicator of Hu's
 pressuring the party old guard to step aside.
 Zhao Ziyang tells reporters on 1 June that press
 reports of high-level leadership changes are ground-
 less, and that Zhao, Hu Yaobang, and President Li
 Xiannian will hold their positions until their terms
 expire in 1987.
 While visiting the United Kingdom in June, Hu
 Yaobang tells a press conference that he and Zhao
 should start stepping back beginning next year, and
 should be gradually retired "a few years later."
 Propaganda Chief Zhu Houze-a Hu Yaobang prote-
 ge-claims in July that "patience" and "one year of
 study" will be needed on questions of political reform
 and spiritual civilization. Zhu defends the expression

 views expressed in the party journal Red Flag are not
 necessarily those of the central leaders.
 According to a Japanese press report, in September
 Hu Yaobang urges Deng to retire as head of the
 Central Advisory Commission and to appoint Hu to
 the position. Conservatives Deng Liqun and Hu
 Qiaomu support Deng's refusal.
 In a September interview with a US newsman, Deng
 states that, although he hopes to retire in the fall of
 1987, he probably would not be able to.
 According to a Japanese press report, in September
 Hu urges Deng to retire from the Central Advisory
 Commission to allow Hu to assume this position, after   25X1
 stepping down as party head. Several newspaper   25X1
 articles referring to Deng's retirement may be relate-
 to behind-the-scenes maneuvering on this proposal-a
 Guangzhou newspaper carries an article in September
 referring to Deng as "your excellency" and asking
 him to "stay a bit longer." In October, a Shenzhen
 newspaper carries an article in response, calling for
 Deng's retirement.                               25X1
 According to diplomatic sources, a leading group to
 study political structural reform is formed under the
 leadership of Zhao Ziyang in the fall. Although Hu
 Yaobang may be in the group, his failure to head it
 The document of the Sixth Plenum of the 12th
 Central Committee held in September calls for build-
 ing a "spiritual civilization"-a theme championed by
 Hu Yaobang and his supporters. Conservative lan-
 guage in the document, including a reference to the
 problem of "bourgeois liberalization," suggests great-
 er compromise than Hu had hoped for, however.
 Official guidance on propagandizing the document
 reportedly stresses giving it a low-key approach, and,
 contrary to usual practice, no instruction is given to
 propaganda workers on how to interpret the docu-
 ment-further signs of the lack of consensus.
 Deng Xiaoping delivers a speech on the need to
 oppose bourgeois liberalization on 28 September. Hu
 reportedly has a hand in keeping the speech from
 being publicized-it is later released as Central Docu-

 An election held in Hefei, Anhui Province, in late
 November triggers student dissatisfaction with nomi-

 early December. Local grievances, a news blackout,

 climaxing in over 30,000 demonstrators protesting on
 21 December. Smaller protests subsequently break
 out in Beiiine.
 A Hong Kong magazine reports that a late November
 Secretariat meeting approves a decision to replace Hu
 with Zhao as party head at the 13th Party Congress.

 An enlarged meeting of the Central Military Com-
 mission held 11-26 December, attended by some
 7,000 Army cadres down to Army corps commander
 level, fails to accept Hu's appointment as Commission
 Chairman, according to a variety of information. The
 Japanese press reports that Hu was not allowed to
 address the meeting, and his name dropped below
 Deng's in reports of the meeting-signs of low stature.
 Deng Xiaoping convenes a series of Politburo meet-
 ings in January to receive Hu Yaobang's self-criticism
 and resignation. According to Japanese press reports,
 Deng addresses the meetings on four occasions be-
 tween 6 and 16 January, criticizing Hu Yaobang for
 forming a faction, for his economic policies, and for
 Hu's mistakes in handling China's relations with
 Japan. Deng reportedly claims that the Hu Yaobang
 issue cannot be delayed until next fall's party con-
 gress.                       the Politburo voted 11
 to 9 to oust Hu, but Deng wanted a larger majority
 and called an "expanded" meeting packed with his
 Other signs of criticism of Hu include a 14 January
 meeting of conservative journalists that attacks the

 of "constructing spiritual civilization" at the 1985

 A communique of the enlarged Politburo meeting

 Central Document 3 dated 19 January reportedly

 he spoke on foreign affairs questions without authori-
