USSR: Reassessing Collectivization 
A distinct shift over the past month in the official view of Stalin's 
forced collectivization in the 1930s?from carefully balanced 
treatment a year ago to wholesale condemnation?seems 
intended to support General Secretary Gorbachev's initiatives 
to restructure the farm system. 
In a speech to media officials last week, Gorbachev noted that the 
long-awaited Central Committee plenum on agriculture would take 
place "first thing next year" but acknowledged that his program 
to give individual initiative more scope through long-term leasing 
arrangements was meeting strong resistance from officials and 
farmers alike. He blamed the legacy of collectivization in the 1930s. 
"We were in too much of a hurry to change things then, and we are 
still trying to untangle ourselves," he told farmers in Krasnoyarsk 
earlier this month. "We destroyed the peasantry." Gorbachev's 
impromptu remarks seemingly contradict the assessment in his 
anniversary speech in November 1987 that, although injustices had 
be -n committed, the policy of collectivization had proved "correct." 
The shift was reinforced in a Pravda article on 16 September by 
historian Viktor Danilov, who flatly asserted that "no objective factor 
can justify the violence that occurred during collectivization." His 
estimate of the number of victims who died during the famine that 
ensued in many rural areas was reportedly deleted, but the article 
described Western estimates of 3 to 4 million deaths as reasonable. 
This estimate contrasts with the estimate of thousands Gorbachev 
used in his 1987 speech. 
Comment: Gorbachev's efforts to change farms into true 
cooperatives of independent leaseholders are not likely to succeed as 
long as Stalin's model of tightly controlled farms is the ideologically 
approved one. Even farmers whose initiative has not been destroyed 
might hesitate to enter leasing arrangements out of fear of being 
compared to kulaks, wealthy peasants who were dispossessed during 
collectivization. 
Orthodox Communists remain uneasy over the current attacks on 
collectivization. "Second Secretary" Ligachev has recently come out 
strongly in favor of long-term leasing, but in the past he has forcefully 
defended collectivization and may believe Gorbachev is going too far 
in dismantling the existing farm structure.

CHINA-USSR: Chinese Debate Relations With Moscow 
Chinese leaders apparently have been debating the timing and 
extent of further improvements in relations with Moscow, but 
Deng Xiaoping, who almost certainly has the final word on such 
decisions, apparently wants to proceed slowly for now. 
Uncorroborated information indicates a group of senior Foreign 
Ministry officials submitted a proposal this summer recommending 
closer party and governmental ties to the USSR, but as of early 
September there had been no response. The proposal reportedly was 
passed to Deng who, with the support of key military leaders, was 
considered likely to reject it. Other unconfirmed information indicates 
Beijing is waiting for specific Soviet measures on Cambodia and for 
the inauguration of the new US administration before scheduling a 
summit with Moscow 
The US defense attache in Beijing reports China's military leaders 
oppose a rapid rapprochement with Moscow; they have indicated 
new preconditions for Sino-Soviet normalization may be raised. In 
response to a reporter's question, China's Foreign Ministry 
spokesman noted on Thursday that the USSR must withdraw  Il 
its forces from Mongolia as quickly as possible 
Comment: Deng is probably not opposed to a Sino-Soviet summit as 
such, but he almost certainly believes he can win more concessions 
from Moscow by holding out and wants to keep Sino-Soviet relations 
from becoming a US election issue. The spokesman's response on 
Mongolia was uncharacteristically pointed and may sianal Dena's 
effort to slow the normalization process. 
Deng may also hope to manipulate the timing of a summit so that 
it does not enhance General Secretary Gorbachev's international 
stature at his expense. China's military is more reluctant than some 
in the Foreign Ministry to improve relations with Moscow, in part 
because a reduced Soviet threat would almost certainly be followed 
by further cuts in the already spartan level for funds allocated to 
defense.

UK-IRAN: Renewing Diplomatic Ties 
British Foreign Secretary Howe and Iranian Foreign Minister 
Velayati may complete arrangements for renewing diplomatic 
ties this Friday at the UN, but the move apparently is not directly 
connected to the hostage issue.  
London wants to reestablish a fully functioning embassy with a 
minimum of 10 diplomats, according to the US Embassy in London. 
The UK all but cut ties last summer?following the beating of a British 
diplomat by the Revolutionary Guard?and limited the Iranian 
presence in London to one. The Thatcher government is currently 
trying to still press speculation that the renewal of ties involves a deal 
for release of the three British hostages held in Lebanon. 
Comment: Interest in renewing ties is mutual. Tehran is trying to 
expand links to the West and probably hopes the British will press 
Iraq toward conciliation in the UN-sponsored peace talks. Iran 
probably has been encouraged by recent British criticism of Iraq's 
use of chemical weapons against the Kurds. 
London's primary motivation in restoring relations is stronger 
commercial ties. The Foreign Office has worried for some time that 
British firms may be left out of emerging trade opportunities; the 
recent decision by Paris to renew ties and growing Iranian trade 
links to West Germany probably have fueled the Foreign Office's 
eagerness. British officials have been more confident about posting 
diplomats to Iran since a British official received assurances of their 
safety during a recent visit to Tehran. 
Leaders of the Church of England who are attempting to negotiate 
the freedom of Anglican envoy Terry Waite are likely to hope that 
stronger ties will result in the hostages' release, but London seems 
unwilling to link the renewal of diplomatic ties to the hostages' 
release. Tehran probably still believes that its influence with the 
Lebanese Hizballah terrorists holding the British hostages has helped 
encourage London to normalize relations. Prime Minister Thatcher 
reportedly has been less interested than the Foreign Office in 
restoring relations and almost certainly would oppose any dealings 
that might undercut her advocacy of strong counterterrorist 
measures.

PERU: Coup Rumors Abate 
Senior Peruvian military officers are increasingly concerned 
about the deteriorating economy and the perception that 
President Garcia is no longer managing policy, but they 
apparently believe the costs of a coup would still outweigh 
the benefits. 
The longstanding antagonism toward Garcia among senior officers 
began to build earlier this month because of their concern about the 
impact of inflation on salaries and budgets. The US defense attache 
reports the Defense Minister told Garcia on 12 September that 
inflation, which is likely to reach 600 percent by December,  is 
undermining the morale and reliability of the armed forces. 
To head off discontent, Garcia has promised to increase military 
salaries by 50 percent and has committed the government to 
undefined budget increases for each  service, 
Garcia has also confronted 
the Defense Minister with taped telephone conversations between 
military plotters, after which the Minister agreed to tour military bases 
with service chiefs to talk up the proposed  pay increases with fellow 
officers and to discourage further plotting. 
A source of the attache says that, before departing on the trip, the 
military leaders agreed among themselves that a coup would be ill 
advised at this point. They argued that the military does not have 
solutions for Peru's economic difficulties and that the overnment 
should be forced to take the heat for its own failures. 
senior Army officers in 
the military region around Lima assured the Defense Minister last 
week that they oppose a coup. The Minister later emphasized in two 
public statements that the armed forces fully support democracy, and 
the US Embassy says rumors of an imminent coup have faded. 
Comment: Garcia probably has preempted whatever plotting was 
under way and bought himself some time with the military. Dislike of 
him remains widespread in the services, but he has supporters in key 
positions and no leader has yet emerged who seems capable of 
capitalizing on the antipathy toward him. Garcia's declining popularity 
may embolden some officers, but most robabl have no desire to 
inherit the country's economic mess. 
The public reaction to government austerity measures has been 
milder than expected so far, but, if widespread social disorder 
developed, the military would probably reassess its position. If 
Marxist Alfonso Barrantes continues to be the front-runner as the 
1990 election approaches moreover, the odds of a preemptive 
coup will increase.

BURMA: Increasing Troop Presence in Rangoon 
The Burmese Government yesterday increased the number of troops 
in Rangoon to block an anticipated antigovernment protest and 
general strike, according to the US Embassy. Rangoon and Mandalay 
were calm this past weekend, but military searches and fear of 
government brutality have increased. The Burmese chief of police and 
six other senior police officials were sacked after the police chief 
refused to arrest opposition leader and former Prime Minister U Nu, 
Comment: The display of military strength is a reminder of the 
government's willingness to use force to control dissent. The 
dismissal of police officers is probably intended to tell officials at all 
levels to tighten discipline and to carry out government directives. 
Student and opposition leaders, meanwhile, have warned against 
mass protests because of the hopelessness of confronting heavily 
armed troops. Some armed student protesters nevertheless will 
probably try to carry out  sporadic attacks against government forces. 
NICARAGUA: Keeping Lid On Opposition 
The regime is intensifying its harassment of internal opposition 
groups despite their already weakened position and low level of 
activity. Last week, unidentified assailants?probably officially 
sanctioned thugs, according to US Embassy sources?brutally 
attacked Joaquin Mejia, the editor of the opposition Liberal 
Independent Party's newspaper and a member of the National 
Assembly, after he published an article critical of the regime.  
  andinista officials recently warned a leader of 
the opposition umbrella group, Coordinadora, not to hold a protest 
march without permission last Sunday. The group's directors heeded 
the warning but held a 72-hour hunger strike last weekend to protest 
regime repression and an official propaganda  blitz accusing them of 
being controlled by the CIA. 
Comment: The regime's campaign is discouraging all but innocuous 
opposition activity. The harassment of Mejia, who generally has 
worked within the system, suggests the Sandinistas are warning even 
the "loyal opposition" that there are limits to acceptable behavior. 
Allegations that the opposition is in the pay of the US are likely to 
make its leaders think twice about organizing public demonstrations 
and to give the regime additional justification for suppressing dissent.

COLOMBIA: Rebels Counter Peace Bid With Violence 
Rebel leaders have flatly rejected the government's recent peace 
offer and have begun a bold offensive against military installations. 
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest 
faction and leader of the national rebel alliance, last week countered 
President Barco's month-old call for guerrilla demobilization with a 
vague demand for broad popular dialogue, according to the US 
Embassy. FARC and its allies meanwhile launched an unprecedented 
series of strikes on military and police bases, in one case detonatin ? a 
car bomb at a divisional Army headquarters in the northeast 
Comment: The rebels may have delayed responding to Barco's offer 
in order to show that they can mount coordinated actions against the 
military, reportedly a primary objective of the alliance. They probably 
hope to weaken the counterinsurgency campaign by forcing the 
military to divert troops from combat to protecting bases. The rebels 
may also hope to undercut public support for the Barco government 
by calling attention to its inability to protect vital facilities?
particularly in the northeast, where guerrillas have repeatedly 
damaged the major oil pipeline  and other economic targets.

ARAB STATES: Palestine Council Meeting Delayed 
PLO Chairman Arafat has decided to delay convening the Palestine 
National Council for several weeks to get more time to seek a  
moderate consensus within his own ranks. 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
The US Embassy in 2bAl 
Algiers reports the PLO remains divided over the venue of the Council 
and local Palestinians expect a PLO decision this week.  25X1 
Arafat is facing determined internal opposition 2bAl 
to any moderation of the PLO charter. 25X1 
Comment: Arafat is probably considering postponing the conclave 
until after the Israeli election on 1 November and holding it in Tunis 
rather than Algiers to avoid Algerian pressure. He probably believes 
he needs time to gain leverage over those PLO Executive Committee 
hardliners who fear he is inclined to offer excessive concessions to 
open a dialogue with the US. To maintain PLO unity, Arafat will 
probably try to prepare a compromise package, which might include 
the declaration of a Palestine government without defined borders 
or the formation of a small exile government with no independent 
authority. 
SAUDI ARABIA: Bond Market Opened to Public 
Saudi Arabia's surprise move to expand domestic bond sales to 
the general public improves prospects for the government's sluggish 
financing program but risks new tension between the regime and the 
conservative religious establishment. The government is limiting 
publicity, but the US Embassy reports that Riyadh's new scheme 
removes most restrictions on bond sales and legalizes secondary 
trading. Earlier sales to financial institutions produced less than 
40 percent of anticipated revenues because of bankers' concerns 
about the bonds' comparatively low interest rate and about the 
government's prohibition on secondary trading. 
Comment: Falling oil revenues and chronic budget deficits?
$14 billion this year?make the success of the bond program critical. 
Although bond sales almost certainly will increase with the new move, 
the government probably must also pay a higher interest rate on the 
bonds to sell enough of them to meet its revenue goals. The limited 
publicity about the expanded bond program probably will help mollify 
the conservative religious opposition, but that group is dogmatically 
opposed to interest-bearing securities and, at a minimum, will 
question the Islamic integrity of the kingdom's decision.

POLAND: New Premier Designated 
Poland's Communist party will nominate Politburo member 
Mieczyslaw Rakowski as Premier at today's session of the Polish 
parliament, according to Polish media. Rakowski, a close aide to 
party First Secretary Jaruzelski, is now the party's propaganda chief 
and has called Solidarity leader Walesa an enemy of the state. 
Comment: Rakowski's previous hostility toward Solidarity should 
calm party hardliners' fear that the regime will go too far to placate 
Walesa. Rakowski advocates broadening the party's base while 
maintaining its supremacy, however, and is likely to reach out to 
nonparty independents?particularly leading Catholics?in forming 
his government. He is also a political ally of the party's foremost 
reform economist, Wladyslaw Baka, suggesting that his government 
will try to push economic reforms. Many opposition leaders distrust 
Rakowski, however, and he will have difficulty gaining support for his 
new policies from prominent figures close to either Cardinal Glemp or 
Walesa. 
USSR-CHILE: Soviets Urge Nonviolent Tactics 
Soviet disapproval of violent activity by the terrorist affiliate of the 
Chilean Communist  Party (PCCh) is leading to tension between the 
party and Moscow, The Soviets 
reportedly favor more moderate tactics to ensure the victory of 
the "no" campaign against President Pinochet in the 5 October 
plebiscite. Moscow reportedly fears that sustained violence would 
push voters into the "yes" camp. A senior PCCh official said earlier 
this year that the Soviets had been instrumental in influencing his 
party to support a "no" vote in the plebiscite rather than a boycott, 
Comment: The Soviets evidently continue to believe that the "no" 
campaign is the best way to oust Pinochet and to broaden the PCCh's 
political base. If the "no" campaign wins, the Soviets almost certainly 
will press the PCCh to deemphasize violence and to build ties to 
Chile's main democratic parties to improve prospects for playing a 
role in a possible political transition. Moscow would probably 
condone some limited use of violence if Pinochet wins the plebiscite, 
provided that it would not irreparably damage PCCh ties to Chile's 
main democratic parties or provoke severe countermeasures by the 
military.

TAIWAN: Wrangling Over Mainland Policy 
Taiwan's ruling party has expelled a senior legislator for violating the 
official policy of "no contacts, no negotiations, and no compromise" 
with China when he met with senior leaders in Beijing earlier this 
month and called for immediate reunification talks. The party claims 
his expulsion will not affect plans to liberalize Taipei's mainland policy 
further and announced late last week that some mainland residents 
will be allowed to visit aged relatives on Taiwan. Younger party 
members, however, have protested the  expulsion and are calling for 
party workers to stage a mass walkout. 
Comment: Party conservatives?reacting viscerally to anything 
that resembles cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party?
apparently have seized on the legislator's indiscreet behavior to try 
to slow the growth of unofficial ties between Taiwan and China. They 
see the new mainland policy as a security threat and are alarmed at 
the burgeoning indirect trade between Taiwan and China?likely to 
exceed $2 billion this year. President Li Teng-hui and party Secretary 
General Li Huan, however, favor a more flexible policy toward China 
as a means of moderating Beijing's policies toward Taiwan. They may 
try to take advantage of public opinion favoring improved ties to 
China and press ahead with a more relaxed mainland policy during 
next year's legislative election. 
BAHRAIN-QATAR: New Talks on Hawar Islands Dispute 
Bahrain has proposed to Qatar that the two countries settle their 
territorial dispute over the Hawar Islands through direct negotiations 
rather than through the World Court. The US Embassy in Doha 
reports that Bahrain's Crown Prince Hamad Al Khalifa and Qatar's 
Crown Prince Hamad Al Thani have met twice in the past two weeks 
to discuss the issue. The Bahraini Crown Prince reportedly fears 
tensions between Manama and Doha might disrupt the Gulf  
Cooperation Council's summit at Manama in December. 
Comment: Bahrain apparently is trying to maintain contacts with 
Qatar to soften Doha's insistence on bringing the dispute before the 
World Court. Qatar's willingness to discuss a political solution directly 
with Bahrain indicates that tensions have declined between Manama 
and Doha. Fundamental differences over ownership of the islands, 
however are likely to de ay significant progress toward a solution.

Special Analysis 
PANAMA: Noriega's Support Still Formidable 
Recent reporting strongly suggests Defense Chief Noriega has no 
plans for early retirement. 
Noriega is considering running for 
president in May 1989 and has ordered a poll to assess his chances if 
the election were honest. He probably sees the election as a solution 
to the political crisis that will legitimize his  regime and allow the 
military's continued dominance of politics 
Noriega's recent actions regarding the possibility of renewed 
negotiations with the US also appear designed to keep his options 
open. He has sent tentative signals in recent weeks that he remains 
receptive to talks with Washington, but his public statement on 
Monday that the US had made the initial approach appears aimed 
at scuttling negotiations for the time being 
Noriega's traditional supporters are feeling the strain of 15 months of 
political and economic crisis in Panama, but they probably still see 
more risk than reward in breaking with him: 
-- Despite the recent surge in strikes, organized labor?a 
traditional bastion of military support?has shown no interest 
in uniting with the largely middle-class opposition, which it 
sees as too probusiness. 
some officers privately favor 
Noriega's departure, fear of losing their perquisites?or their 
lives?in an attempt to oust him continues to inhibit the 
formation of any dissident group within the military. 
? The regime coalition remains united in spite of evidence of 
growing differences between Actina  President Solis Palma 
and his cabinet 
Noriega is no doubt concerned about the recent labor strife, but, the 
military's takeover of key public services indicates he has not been 
intimidated and is resolved to hang onto power. Noriega is probably 
prepared to use greater force if necessary to quell future labor unrest, 
although he will first try his usual tactics of intimidation and 
negotiation. The recent decision by striking workers to return to work 
without additional government concessions has probably  increased 
his confidence in his ability to retain control. 
As long as Noriega is confident that he still has military support, he is 
not likely to give up power. He may quickly change his mind, however, 
if his tactics  fail to stem labor unrest or begin to cost him support in 
the military.

Mitterrand: Ensuring His Place in History 
With no higher office to run for and without a 
strong domestic policy agenda, Francois 
Mitterrand may try to perfect his place in history 
through lasting accomplishments in arms control 
and other foreign policy areas. The role of 
venerable helmsman suits the French President, 
who prefers dealing with broad concepts rather 
than details. Foreign affairs and defense are his 
constitutional prerogatives, and he can operate 
with greater freedom than in the domestic arena. 
Focusing on international affairs would allow 
Mitterrand to skirt the mire of everyday domestic 
politics, he is 
displeased with much of the Socialist Party for 
criticizing his opening toward the center.

who might succeed him has begun so soon after his

Special Analysis 
FRANCE: Mitterrand Reviewing Arms Control Policy 
President Mitterrand's public support for arms control over the 
past year is designed to increase France's leverage, strengthen 
European cooperation, and encourage progress in arms 
control?particularly on conventional arms?at a time when 
movement seems possible. His main objective is to dispel 
France's reputation as a spoiler on arms control. Because he is 
still refining his agenda on arms control, his visit to Washington 
this week presents an opportunity to influence his views 
Mitterrand believes France's negativism on this issue has reduced 
French influence, and he wants Paris to be a player, particularly on 
NATO SNF modernization and on conventional disarmament. He also 
believes the warming of East-West relations should be exploited to 
produce further progress in arms control. He hopes as well to build on 
an increasingly close relationship with West Germany and to win 
economic and other concessions in exchange for insulating West 
German Chancellor Kohl from Allied pressure to make such difficult 
decisions as accepting the follow-on to the Lance missile. 
Mitterrand nonetheless has vacillated about what his priorities are. 
Before the NATO summit earlier this year, for example, he played 
down the importance of SNF modernization and questioned the 
usefulness of short-range nuclear systems. More recently, however, 
he has toned down these criticisms and concentrated instead on 
conventional force and chemical weapons issues. 
Focusing on Conventional Arms 
The US Embassy in Paris reports Mitterrand is particularly concerned 
about the slow progress of discussions on conventional arms, and he 
has stated repeatedly in recent months that conventional forces 
should come first on the arms control agenda. He reportedly is trying 
to bring French policy on conventional arms control closer to that of 
other West European governments without abandoning France's 
opposition to bloc-to-bloc negotiations. The Embassy says he 
convened a brainstorming session of Foreign and Defense Ministry 
officials earlier this month to ensure that French positions do not 
hamstring negotiable Western proposals. 
Mitterrand believes that the conventional stability talks later this year 
will be political and should not be stymied by "complicated military 
factors," according to the Embassy. It is this attitude that probably 
led the Defense Ministry to brief him on the conventional imbalance in 
Europe.

Defense Minister Chevenement's Visit 
Chevenement will be in Washington at the same time as Mitterrand but is heading a separate 
delegation. He will highlight arms control topics but has other issues on his agenda: 
Arms Development Cooperation. Chevenement lacks the technical expertise former Defense 
Minister Giraud had in this area. Although he has said that French participation with the US in 
codeveloping arms will go forward, he will probably take a hard look at how French industry 
might benefit from such projects and fror'n possible joint development of a follow-on to the 
Lance missile. The French Navy's interest in buying the US-built F-18 fighter is a high-priority 
topic, not only because Chevenement recently postponed trials on a French aircraft carrier, 
but also because the F-18's competitor, a carrier version of Dassault's Rafale, will not be 
available before 1996. The US defense attache reports the only solution to the issue 
Chevenement would accept is one that would preserve Dassault's identity as a French 
company. 
Military Use of Space. The French military has its own communications satellites but will not 
have an imaging system until the early 1990s, when France expects to launch the first Helios 
satellite from its joint program with Italy and Spain. Helios is to have photographic, infrared, 
and electronic intelligence capabilities. The French will probably want the satellite to evaluate 
the performances of Soviet ABM and early warning radars in particular. Paris is looking as 
well for cooperation?most likely with the US and its EC partners?in the fields of optics, 
radar, electronic intelligence, early warning, and surveillance, according to the defense 
attache.

To Secret 
Reassessing Position on Chemical Weapons 
France has long supported the negotiations in Geneva on a chemical 
weapons convention but has hindered progress out of concerns 
about verification and protecting its own program. Paris probably 
still hopes to slow chemical weapons negotiations that Bonn has 
been pushing hard to complete and continues to press its proposal 
permitting parties to maintain a minimum security stockpile during 
a 10-year reduction period. The Embassy recently reported that 
disagreement exists within the Foreign Ministry on this issue 
and that senior officials?including Mitterrand, Defense 
Minister Chevenement, and Foreign Minister Dumas?may agree to 
deemphasize the idea if other interim proposals appear promising. 
Views on NATO SNF Modernization 
French support for, or acquiescence in, a NATO decision next year to 
deploy a follow-on to the short-range Lance missile would be critical 
to winning West German support for the Lance program. Mitterrand 
has long seen NATO SNF modernization as undermining prospects 
for arms control and as furthering a strategy of flexible response, 
which France opposes. He also thinks that playing down the need?
or, at least, the urgency?of SNF modernization will aid Kohl, who 
wants to postpone a decision on the Lance follow-on 
Mitterrand has tried to get the Soviets to agree to major conventional 
cuts by threatening to push for NATO SNF modernization within two 
years if Moscow refuses. One of his aides at the Elysee has also 
hinted that French SNF modernization might not go forward if the 
Soviets are cooperative. Although opposed to SNF negotiations, the 
French are more sensitive than most Allies to West German concerns 
and probably would accept some movement toward NATO-Warsaw 
Pact talks. 
Opportunity for the US 
Mitterrand wants movement in arms control, but his specific goals 
are still in flux. His instinct as he enters his second term is to nourish 
the West German connection and to improve on his reputation as 
a statesman by taking a more flexible view of the military balance. 
His presence in Washington provides the opportunity to discuss the 
necessity and timing of proposed NATO decisions and the attitudes 
of other Allies. According to a press report, France might even make 
a major policy departure and consider including its own short-range 
nuclear forces if the Soviets make significant conventional cuts.

Special Analysis 
INDIA-USSR: Changing Arms Relationship 
Soviet Defense Minister Yazov will probably raise the prospect of 
new weapons deals during his current visit to New Delhi in an 
attempt to solidify the Indo-Soviet arms relationship. Despite 
some recent highly publicized deliveries, the Indians are 
ordering less military hardware from Moscow as they try to 
develop their own defense industry and shop for high-technology 
items in the West. New Delhi will continue to buy from the 
Soviets, however, because Soviet prices are attractive and 
because it wants to maintain close ties to Moscow. 
The US Embassy in New Delhi speculates that Yazov may discuss 
the availability of advanced Soviet weapons, such as the MIG-21U 
Mongol jet trainer, the T-80 tank, and the MI-35 attack helicopter. 
He may also bring up possible technological cooperation on India's 
indigenous Light Combat Aircraft project. The Indians, however, 
appear to favor Western aircraft for their jet trainer and are making 
progress on their own tank and attack helicopter programs with help 
from Western firms. And for its Light Combat Aircraft project, India 
has used Western technology transfer agreements and bought 
Western subsystems that the Soviets usually have been either unable 
or unwilling to match. Yazov must offer highly sophisticated systems 
at most favorable terms to raise much interest in New Delhi. 
Advanced Soviet Weapons 
New Delhi has acquired some of the Soviets' most advanced weapon 
systems over the past year or so as Moscow has sought to protect its 
position as India's major arms supplier: 
? India became the first country to lease a nuclear-powered 
submarine, a Soviet Charlie-l-class. 
? It was the first recipient of Soviet TU-142 long-range 
antisubmarine warfare aircraft. 
? India got the first export of the MI-26 heavy lift helicopter and 
some of the earliest exports of lgla-1M portable surface-to-air 
missiles. 
? India acquired MIG-29s last year after the Soviets agreed to 
provide advanced subsystems they had previously been 
reluctant to export.

the Indians have agreed in 
principle to buy the A-50 Mainstay AWACS from the Soviets. New 
Delhi, however, has turned down offers of coproduction rights on 
the MIG-29 and of Koni-class frigates and additional Kashin-class 
destroyers; India apparently is confident it can fill these daps in its 
force structure with indigenous designs and production. 
No Growth in Arms Purchases 
Despite the deliveries of major items this year, Indian military 
purchases from the USSR appear to have peaked. The two countries 
are not signing enough new purchase agreements to maintain current 
levels of arms deliveries into the 1990s. Moscow's aggressive 
marketing of advanced weaponry at favorable terms, however, may 
slow the general decline in arms purchases. 
The usually attractive terms of Soviet military sales, including 
low prices and interest rates and payments in soft currency and 
manufactured goods, have helped India acquire a massive arsenal 
that gives it a strong advantage over its neighbors. Diplomatic 
reporting indicates, however, that New Delhi is putting an increasing 
premium on sophistication and technology transfer in defense 
purchases so that the investment will pay dividends for India's 
developing industrial and technological base. New Delhi wants to 
move from buying and coproducing arms to designing and building its 
own major weapons systems, and Moscow so far has shown little 
inclination to match the technology  transfers and subsystem sales 
that New Delhi gets from the West. 
Outlook 
The Indo-Soviet arms trade probably will decline, but only slowly. 
New Delhi cannot afford to disregard Moscow's favorable prices and 
terms. The Indians also will preserve access to a reliable supplier that 
can provide advanced items?such as the Mainstay?that India 
cannot produce quickly enough or acquire from the West. The arms 
relationship also gives India access to spare parts for its Soviet 
equipment and a counterweiaht to Pakistan's US and Chinese 
patrons.
