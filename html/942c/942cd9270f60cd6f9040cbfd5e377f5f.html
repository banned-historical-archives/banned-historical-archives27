 How China Makes
 Foreign Policyn                                             25X1
 Decisionmaking in China is-and always has been-highly centralized.
 Since his return to power, Deng Xiaoping has called most of the shots, es-
 pecially in foreign policy. Over the past few years, however, Deng has
 begun delegating more power and responsibility to his handpicked succes-
 sors, party General Secretary Hu Yaobang and Premier Zhao Ziyang. Of
 the two, Hu is the real heir to Deng, with Zhao apparently destined to play
 the role of chief administrator, much like the late Zhou Enlai under Mao.
 Together Hu and Zhao are making the foreign policy apparatus more
 responsive to their wills and are attempting to coordinate and rationalize
 the process. They have a long way to go, however, in remaking what
 remains a complex, overlapping, and fragile decisionmaking structure.
 Key institutions to emerge from their efforts are the new Foreign Affairs
 Small Group administered by Zhao and the reestablished party Secretariat
 under Hu. They are now responsible for formulating policy and making
 most of the important day-to-day decisions, helping Hu and Zhao place
 their stamp on policy and bolstering their image as leaders. Other
 institutions that play a major role include:
 ? The Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decisionmaking body.
 ? The International Liaison Department. Under Hu Yaobang's activist
 leadership, this once moribund party agency plays a major role in areas
 such as relations with North Korea.
 ? The Foreign Affairs Coordination Point. Under the state apparatus, this
 informal group hashes out the details of daily diplomacy and economic
 relations.
 ? Think tanks, especially those led by officials personally close to Deng,
 Hu, and Zhao. They often have direct and substantial influence.
 foreign policy making,
 The military-long cast by some observers as resisting Deng's foreign
 policies-does not appear to wield much influence in this area. Historical-
 ly, some soldier-politicians have been influential, but the military as an
 institution does not-and apparently never has-played a key role in
 Personal relationships still count for as much, if not more, than institutions
 in policymaking. China's tradition of rule by a strongman continues to
 apply, making even major changes in the direction of foreign policy
 relatively easy to initiate and rendering the policy process unpredictable.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/11: CIA-RDP04T00447R000100530001-5
 Indeed, persons with close ties to individual leaders at the top often go out
 of channels and submit uncoordinated proposals that can become policy.
 Similarly, the leadership uses trusted representatives-especially their
 offspring-to perform particularly sensitive missions rather than rely on
 officeholders in the formal chain of command. Foreign policy professionals
 with few exceptions have not entered the narrow circle of the leadership's
 trusted advisers.
 The conservatives in China's leadership who have resisted some of the
 reformist initiatives appear to us more concerned with the domestic social
 effects of foreign policy than with the policy itself. These leaders also have
 a jealous regard for China's sovereignty and are quick to react when they
 believe it is slighted. Politburo Standing Committee members Chen Yun,
 79, and Li Xiannian, 75, stand out in this regard, although their influence
 on foreign policy appears to have declined recently.
 Another senior leader who could prove increasingly troublesome, is the
 independent-minded Peng Zhen, 82, rumored to be responsible for intelli-
 gence and a candidate for membership in the party's Politburo Standing
 Committee. Peng has a record of emotionally tinged anti-US remarks.
 Chinese leaders take their own counsel and rely on a handful of close
 advisers who share their strategic outlook and for the most part do not rep-
 resent institutional interests. Foreign policy professionals, with few excep-
 tions, have not entered the narrow circles of the leadership's trusted
 advisers.

 How China Makes
 Foreign Policy F
 Since the founding of the People's Republic, China's
 leaders have had enormous personal scope in shaping
 foreign policy. In the early years, this reliance on the
 judgment of one or a few individuals was not a great
 handicap because of China's limited international role
 and its acceptance of the Soviet lead in many areas.
 The opening of China to the West since the end of the
 Cultural Revolution, however, has greatly increased
 the importance of the decisions of Beijing's leaders
 and its foreign policy apparatus.
 Deng's twin objectives-economic modernization and
 a smooth succession to party General Secretary Hu
 Yaobang and Premier Zhao Ziyang-have, however,
 prompted him to delegate some of his authority to
 these two men and the bureaucracies they head. But
 the process of creating a foreign policy establishment
 responsive to Hu and Zhao is far from complete. This
 paper looks closely at China's foreign policy institu-
 tions as they are evolving and then discusses the roles
 of the major players
 The Party ...
 The Politburo Standing Committee. This is the apex
 of decisionmaking in China. Three of its six mem-
 bers-Deng, Hu, and Zhao-together make the ma-
 jor decisions in foreign policy, with Deng the domi-
 Deng has gradually shifted responsibility for foreign
 affairs onto the shoulders of Hu and Zhao. Zhao told
 a US scholar last July that he and Hu are on the "first
 line" of decisionmaking. The other four, older Stand-
 ing Committee members, on the "second line," now
 decide "only a few" issues.
 The Politburo. Since the reestablishment of the party
 Secretariat in early 1980, the once-strong role of the
 Politburo has steadily diminished, its functions limit-
 ed largely to approving what the Secretariat submits
 to it. Its 24 full members and three alternate mem-
 bers, often powerful individuals in their own right, are

 collectively quite elderly (average age 75), and no
 effort is under way to make the membership younger.
 Although troublesome Politburo members are treated
 gingerly, the reformist-dominated Secretariat has
 fairly successfully circumvented the group as a whole.
 In recent years, the Politburo has met infrequently
 and usually only in connection with larger gather-
 ings-so-called expanded Politburo meetings-that
 include Secretariat members and a variety of other
 party, state, and Army figures. These large meetings
 appear to dilute the impact of the Politburo delibera-
 tions, effectively packing the meeting in Deng's favor
 The Secretariat. On all issues, this is now the key
 policy formulation body in the Chinese party. We
 believe that the Secretariat shapes and oversees the
 implementation of nearly all major departures in
 foreign policy-such as opening China's cities to
 foreign investment. Its governmental counterpart is
 the State Council. The membership and staff of the

 example, General Political Department head Yu Qiuli

 two organizations overlap,

 The Foreign Affairs Small Group. Li Xiannian pre-
 sides over this group, but in fact it is headed by
 Premier Zhao and is the most important body review-

 of all organizations dealing with foreign affairs:
 The Secretariat is the central coordination mecha-
 nism for all party activities and is the bureaucratic
 power base for General Secretary Hu. Its 11 members
 and alternates include some senior figures, however,

 Standing midway between the party and state, it
 coordinates the activities of all organizations con-
 cerned with foreign policy matters. Zhao identified
 this group as a party organization and outlined its role
 as exchanging views, studying problems, and commu-
 nicating with one another. According to Zhao, "It
 25X1       does not decide what concrete measures are to be
 taken."
 Despite the establishment of the small group, many
 Chinese in the ministries still complain to scholars
 and US Embassy officials about the lack of coordina-
 tion in the Chinese foreign policy establishment.
 Reports and studies on virtually any topic from any
 organization continue to be channeled directly to the
 top leadership through networks of personal relations
 without notification to other elements of the bureau-
 cracies or peer review. As a result, Deng and other
 leaders sometimes issue policy statements that come
 as a surprise to China's diplomats.n

 The International Liaison Department. The ILD has
 a unique role in the policy apparatus: supervising
 China's dealings with foreign Communist parties and
 some Communist-ruled countries. With the decline in
 the international Communist movement and the
 breakup of the Sino-Soviet Bloc in the 1960s, the ILD
 lost its main role and much of its policy influence,
 confining its activities to party intelligence work and
 contacts abroad with less significant parties.

 Under Hu Yaobang's activist leadership and the daily
 oversight of Hu Qili, however, the ILD is making a
 comeback. It is in charge of Beijing's more ecumeni-
 cal approach to foreign parties and now deals not only
 with pro-Soviet parties in Europe but with any party
 China hopes to influence.
 Hu's personal involvement in relations with North
 Korea also has increased the prominence of the ILD.
 According to a US Embassy source, the ILD drafted
 all of the papers prepared for Hu's trip to North
 Korea last May. In November 1984, moreover, an
 "unofficial" visit to China by Kim II-song, the Korean
 party leader, took place under the ILD's aegis. F-1
 Qian Liren, a follower of Hu Yaobang since their
 time together in the Communist Youth League in the
 1950s, heads the ILD.

 experience in the ILD make him one of the better
 informed officials in Hu's circle of trusted associates.
 ...and State
 The State Council. The Council is an unwieldy body
 comprising more than 50 members. It is sometimes
 called upon to place a stamp of bureaucratic approval
 on broad policy measures, such as supporting Deng's
 opening to the outside or Zhao's economic reforms. A
 less cumbersome "inner cabinet" of about 15 State
 Council members meets twice a week. This largely
 technocratic group reportedly works to solve nuts-
 and-bolts questions that need attention by relatively
 senior officials. The Premier takes a strong hand in
 supervising this body
 The Premier's principal foreign affairs aide in State
 Council work is Deputy Secretary General Chen Chu,
 a veteran diplomat. Despite his position, Chen appears
 to exercise little influence.
 According to Premier Zhao, the Minister of Foreign
 Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Economic Rela-
 tions and Trade meet with Ji frequently to discuss
 foreign affairs. Their positions make them among the
 best informed and potentially most influential govern-
 ment officials in the foreign affairs arena. Zhao said,
 "When there are problems they cannot solve, they

 however, that their concurrent positions in the Small
 Group permit issues to go directly there, short-

 The MFA's lack of political clout, moreover, makes it
 just one of a number of bureaucracies clamoring to
 bring their interests to the attention of the leadership.

 We believe the influence of the MFA should not be
 discounted too much. As the chief representative of
 the Chinese Government in dealings with the outside

 form the leadership's agenda.

 bassadors assigned abroad, are held periodically in
 China, usually to receive instructions but sometimes
 to put forth views on policy. We believe that over time
 these are influential.

 The Military. How the People's Liberation Army
 (PLA) formally interacts with the foreign affairs
 community is unclear, apparently by design. Among
 foreign observers and even Chinese officials, there is
 considerable uncertainty about the military's influ-
 ence on foreign policy. Although many have imputed
 to the PLA a variety of views on the basis of very thin
 evidence, we have no hard evidence that the PLA as
 an institution has historically promoted or obstructed
 a particular foreign policy line, even during the era
 when Lin Biao led the military.
 Other individuals within the military are increasingly
 performing sensitive foreign affairs tasks at the behest
 of the leadership. Middle-level officers involved in the
 developing Sino-US military relationship, for exam-
 ple, include a striking number of the offspring of
 senior leaders. In our view, this channel does not
 represent an expression of PLA institutional interest
 in expanding the relationship with the United States
 as much as it does a traditional Chinese inclination to
 use trustworthy officials to oversee sensitive policy
 matters. F-1

 Individual soldier-politicians may take positions on

 to obtain needed equipment quickly, some line officers
 appear willing, for example, to become increasingly
 dependent on arms and technology from abroad, while
 military-related production ministries have vested in-
 terests at home to protect against foreign competition.
 Their respective influence depends, however, on their
 personal prestige and connections at least as much as
 on their institutional affiliation. On balance, we be-

 The Ministry of State Security is headed by a career
 public security official, Ling Yuri. Ling was Deng's
 special assistant for security during his visit to the
 United States in 1979 and presumably is still trusted
 to look after Deng's interests in the Ministry.n

 Bence, with very limited analytical capability.
 Finally, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
 (CASS), established in 1977 as the font of many of the
 reform camp's most important ideas, houses some
 specialized foreign affairs institutes. The head of
 CASS, Ma Hong, is an economist who is not regarded
 as a foreign policy actor.n
 One of the institutes under CASS is the Institute of
 American Studies, a small and ill-funded organization
 according to its director, Li Shenzhi. Li is well
 regarded within top foreign policy circles, according
 to many reports. He was close to Zhou Enlai in the
 1950s and 1960s and traveled to the United States
 with Deng in 1979 and with Zhao in 1984. He also
 helped to author Hu Yaobang's speech to the 12th
 Party Congress in 1982, setting out China's independ-
 ent foreign policy line.' Despite the high regard in
 which he is held, Li has been slow to acquire bureau-
 cratic authority. One CASS official believes Li may
 soon rise to a leading position in the Academy. Li
 seems to be a protege of Huan Xiang.0
 Ad Hoc Groups. The leadership frequently forms
 special study or policy groups to wrestle with issues of
 broad scope or particular sensitivity. These fall into
 two general categories: departmental and ministerial
 representative meetings and senior leadership teams.
 Broadly based representative meetings appear intend-
 ed primarily to build a consensus and overcome
 bureaucratic cleavages on issues. According to the US
 Embassy, for example, a visiting US scholar was told
 that the State Council organized a task force before
 announcing Premier Zhao's agreement to visit the
 United States.n
 In another case, representatives of the Foreign Minis-
 try's desk, the Institutes of International Studies, of
 International Relations, and for Contemporary Inter-
 national Relations prepared an assessment, under the
 direction of Huan Xiang, on the prospects for the
 reelection of President Reagan. The task force con-
 cluded that the President would be reelected and that
 China should prepare to deal with him for another
 five years. Similar ad hoc groups are formed to
 coodinate papers in advance of visits by important
 figures, such as Vice President Bush and Prime
 Minister Thatcher.)
 Ad hoc groups composed of top leaders are not a new
 phenomenon and seem to reflect China's traditional
 reliance on a few powerful individuals.
 Dissent Mechanisms. China's political culture stress-
 es conformity, despite the efforts of the leadership
 occasionally to encourage initiative. When a single
 leader is dominant, as Deng is now, the tendency is to
 avoid challenging his line on issues such as foreign
 policy. When the leader is weak, however, political
 opponents look for issues to exploit as cudgels in their
 battles. Debates can occur completely out of our view,
 but some differences emerge when senior leaders

 make public remarks that are out of step with the
 prevailing line.4 n
 The conditions of comparative stability in China
 today have reduced visible dissent to a minimum.
 Under these conditions, perhaps the safest and most
 commonly used means of publicly debating an issue,
 especially one that has not been finally decided upon
 by the leadership, is the use of allegorical articles in
 China's media. In August 1984, for example, an
 article appeared in Red Flag ostensibly to commemo-
 rate China's National Day, but it went on to dredge
 up unpleasant memories about the stationing of US
 forces in China before 1949. Although the intent of
 such pieces is usually masked, this article seemed
 written to warn the leadership about the potential
 adverse consequences of a military relationship with
 the United States.n
 approval by someone in authority.
 We know very little about the interplay between
 senior leaders and those who express dissent from
 below. Long after specific policy or factional battles
 have been fought, however, information has often
 emerged linking the authors of allegorical articles, for
 example, with top leaders who are struggling with
 their colleagues. Gaining access to the official media
 to publish allegories appears to require at least tacit

 Conclusions and Implications
 for the United States
 The creation of new coordinating mechanisms has
 strengthened the role of the reform group under Deng
 in the foreign policy making process. It has not,
 however, fundamentally altered the system's tendency
 to rely, in an almost chaotic fashion, on individuals
 rather than institutions. By regularizing much of the
 flow of information and policy papers, the Deng group
 has reduced, to a degree, the potential for confusion,
 error, and opposition mischief. It also has helped Hu
 and Zhao to place their stamp on policy, bolstering
 their image as national leaders.n
 Tighter management of the process, we believe, has
 also made implementation of policy toward the Unit-
 ed States more effecti,,--. By including suspected
 skeptics of the relationship in the policy generation
 process and by appointing study groups across bu-
 reaucratic lines, the regime is able to channel and
 control dissenting views within the system.n

 At the same time, the concentration of authority in
 the hands of Deng, Hu, and Zhao gives these lead-
 ers-especially Deng-the authority to stare down
 domestic critics, for example, on the decision to play
 down China's reaction to quiet, unofficial US dealings
 It is too early to tell whether the new institutions
 created by the reformers will last. China's tradition of
 rule by a strongman, combined with a tendency to
 treat foreign policy as his special preserve, still makes
 even major changes in the direction of foreign policy
 relatively easy to initiate. The complex pattern of
 personal relationships that exist throughout the sys-
 tem remains, in our view, more durable and influen-
 tial than the institutions themselves.n

 Appendix
 An Illustration of the
 Decisionmaking Process
 In June 1984, Outlook magazine published a highly    May 1980
 unusual article chronicling China's decision "to fur-
 ther open to the world" 14 coastal cities. We believe
 this decision provoked particularly intense behind-the-
 scenes arguments, because of the major domestic
 implications of the competition and opportunities
 brought by increased contact with the world. Some    August 1980
 officials evidently also believed that special economic
 zones would become "special political zones" for
 foreigners. By detailing the stages of decisionmaking
 and consensus building, the reform leadership appar-
 ently wanted to demonstrate to skeptics that the                            1981-82
 policy was firm, broadly based, and no longer to be
 questioned. At the same time, Hu and Zhao presum-
 ably sought to portray themselves as presiding over a
 smooth governmental process with the blessing of all
 the top leaders.
 The article documented the emergence of the Secre-
 tariat as the central party body to shape the initiatives
 of the leadership. It also demonstrated how inscrip-
 tions on policy documents by top leaders influence
 policy debates. Finally, it showed how the Politburo
 was circumvented and maneuvered into functioning as  1982
 a rubberstamp.
 December 1978            The watershed Third Ple-
 num of the 11th Central
 Committee approved the
 notion of opening to the
 outside world.
 Deng Xiaoping proposed   February 1983
 creating special zones to
 entice foreign capital and
 technology to China.
 "Soon afterwards"        Central Committee and
 State Council sent work
 teams to investigate es-
 tablishing "special zones
 for exports."
 The Central Committee
 and State Council issued
 document establishing
 "special economic
 zones."
 The Standing Committee
 of the National People's
 Congress gave pro forma
 approval of zones.
 Central Committee and
 State Council issued fur-
 ther stipulations and
 regulations.
 Hu Yaobang told the
 Secretariat, "On the ba-
 sis of self-reliance, we
 must widen our field of
 vision from China to the
 world."
 Chen Yun inscribed in-
 structions on a document
 urging the zones be run
 "more successfully."
 Top leaders Hu Yao-
 bang, Ye Jianying, Deng
 Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang,
 Li Xiannian, and others
 conducted personal inves-
 tigations of the zones.
 Hu Yaobang said, while
 touring the Shenzhen
 zone, "Be bold in explor-
 ing and blazing new
 trails."

 January-February 1984        Deng Xiaoping, Wang
 Zhen, and Yang Shang-
 kun inspected the zones.
 Deng wrote an inscrip-
 tion saying, "Our policy
 in establishing special
 economic zones is
 correct."
 24 February 1984         "Leading comrades of
 the central authorities"
 attended a "forum"
 where Deng instructed,
 "We must make clear
 that our guiding ideology
 is to open wide and not to
 restrict."
 "Not long afterwards"    The Secretariat and
 State Council began con-
 crete preparations for a
 forum of coastal city
 leaders.
 26 March-6 April 1984    The Secretariat and
 State Council held a fo-
 rum of coastal city and
 provincial officials to-
 gether with responsible
 and leading officials from
 the special economic
 zones and central organs.
 Deng Xiaoping and Li
 Xiannian attended the
 closing. Zhao Ziyang
 called Deng's proposal to
 open additional cities a
 "major policy."
 30 April 1984            Finally, Hu Yaobang and
 Zhao Ziyang presided
 over a Politburo meeting,
 also attended by "leading
 comrades" of the Secre-
 tariat, the State Council,
 the Central Advisory
 Commission, and "other
 organs" to endorse
 Deng's proposal.
