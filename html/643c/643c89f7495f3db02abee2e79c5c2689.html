 BROADCASTING ADMINISTRATION BUREAU
 Much has been written concerning the Chinese Communist
 propaganda machine and the influence which the product of this
 machine is exerting on the nations of Asia and the underdeveloped
 countries, including the newly independent areas of Africa.  One
 of the most active, expanding and effective components of this propa-
 ganda effort is Radio Peking, beaming newscasts and other programs
 throughout the world in at least 19 foreign languages and 5 Chinese
 dialects for a total of 511 voice program hours weekly in September
 1960, and more than 1280 hours of non-voice press transmissions per
 week.
 Behind this vast broadcasting program is a large, efficient
 Communist Party and governmental organization about which little
 has been made public.
 If there is to be an understanding of the Chinese Communist
 Propaganda program in the broadcasting and news transmission field,
 it is necessary to know the facts concerning its historical development,

 the government and party organs which implement it, the components
 of the broadcasting organization, their functional responsibilities, and
 the key personnel who direct it.
 The purpose of this study is to bring together what is known of
 the background, as well as of the functional and operational structure
 of this organization.  Little is known of the technical aspects of this
 operation because of restrictions which have prevented inspection of
 the broadcasting equipment and facilities by qualified non-Communist
 Western technicians.

 I       STATUS IN PARTY AND GOVERNMENT
 One of the nine permanent departments under the Chinese
 Communist Party's Central Committee is the Propaganda Department,
 which supervises and directs all propaganda activities of the Party and
 controls the propaganda organs found under the Chinese People's
 Government and among the many mass organizations in Communist
 China.  It directs the domestic and foreign propaganda system, and
 propaganda departments, sections and specialists are found in all party
 organs and committees down to the lowest level.  The Propaganda De-
 partment is staffed by dedicated and experienced Party propagandists.
 Specialists in this field are among the members of the Party Secre-
 tariat.                           Little is known of the structure of the Propaganda Department's
 organization at the Peking level other than the names of the Director,
 his deputies and the heads of several departments.  Although not identi-
 fied as to its title or personnel, it is believed that there is a section
 under the Propaganda Department responsible for direction of the use
 of broadcasting facilities for dissemination of propaganda domestically
 and to foreign audiences.
 One of the six staff offices of the State Council of the Chinese
 People's Government is that for Culture and Education.  There are
 several Ministries and special agencies under the cognizance of this
 Staff Office, including the Ministry of Culture, and New China News

 Agency, and the Broadcasting Administration Bureau, each of which
 has its particular role in carrying out the Party propaganda program
 under the administration of the State Council.
 The masses on the China mainland are organized into people's
 organizations, front organizations and psuedo- political parties, all
 under the control and guidance of the United Front Work Department
 of the CCP Central Committee.  Each of these has its propaganda de-
 partment and is used for propaganda purposes by the Party, working
 through the Central Committee's Propaganda Department.
 Although formally a special agency of the Chinese People's
 Government, the Broadcasting Administration Bureau (BAB) is, for
 all practical purposes, one of the tools of the Party's Propaganda De-
 partment, and is controlled through a Party Committee responsible
 for execution of Party policy in all the activities in which the BAB en-
 gages.                        Through its control of the BAB, the Party controls the Central
 People's Broadcasting Station (Radio Peking), all broadcasts in and
 from Communist China, jamming of some foreign broadcasts beamed
 to the China mainland, and expansion and administration of the wired
 broadcasting network.  In addition, the monitoring of foreign broad-
 casts by a division of the BAB, along with the news and other data ac-
 quired by the New China News Agency foreign bureaus, offices and

 II       HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT
 The exact date when the Chinese Communists began using
 morse code radio communications for transmittal for inter-party com-
 munications, military information and for the transmission of news for
 use in the Communist press is not known, but it certainly was no later
 than 1929 when the first Chinese Soviet regime was founded in Kiangsi.
 Neither land line communications nor radio communications were well
 developed at the time in the interior of China, yet the Chinese Commu-
 nists were able to obtain the relatively simple equipment necessary for
 the radio transmission and reception of morse code messages.  It also
 appears likely that these facilities were maintained and operated by
 military communications units under Party control, and used jointly
 by the military, the Party, and the Red China News Agency.
 Over the period of their development until the end of the Long
 March at Yenan in 1935, these communications services were undoubtedly
 expanded and used to channel Party directives, as well as news, to the
 scattered Party organs and military units and the border areas.  A
 formal section to control this activity was probably established at this

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000100090001-7
 time under the Party's Propaganda Department, but data are not
 available to confirm this.
 Although the Chinese Communists proclaim 5 September 1945
 as the founding date of their broadcasting enterprise, this was probably
 the date on which they began their voice broadcasting on a large scale.
 Prior to that date, the broadcasting was largely in morse English and
 numerical code.  On 15 August 1944, the New China News Agency began
 an experimental broadcast of news in English morse code from its station
 at Yenan beamed to San Francisco, using one kilowatt of power.  Each
 of these twice-daily broadcasts identified the station as the "voice of
 Communist China"  and stated "There is no copyright; republication is
 free".
 The following brief paraphrased summary of the first 10 years
 of Communist China's voice broadcasting enterprise is taken from an
 article in the September 1955 issue of the Kuang-po- Ai-hao-che:
 The New China Broadcasting Station began
 operations in Yenan on 5 September 1945.  With
 only 300 watts of power, it broadcast 2 hours a
 day, increasing this to 2 1/2 hours a day by 1946;
 and to 3 hours daily in 1947; adding news coverage
 and a program in English.  Its broadcasting mis-
 sion was stated to be "to publicize policy of the

 Approved For Rele                *AWP78-02646ROO01
 Chinese Communist Party, to report to the
 people on world and domestic developments,
 to introduce life in the liberated areas, and to
 struggle for the victory of the national revolu-
 tion. "  Between 1945 and March 1947, when
 Chinese Nationalist forces drove the Communists
 from their Yenan base, five other broadcast-
 ing stations had been established in Communist-
 held areas.  Driven from Yenan, the central
 New China Broadcasting Station became the
 North Shensi New China Broadcasting Station,
 where it remained until it was moved to Peking
 in March 1949 after that city had fallen to the
 Communists and headquarters of the Party and
 military were transferred there.  By the end of
 1948, the Chinese Communists claimed to have
 15 broadcasting stations in addition to the one in
 North Shensi.  As the Chinese Communists
 swept from province to province in conquest of
 the mainland, the radio stations in the cities
 occupied all fell under the control of the CCP,

 Approved For Release               R6VMM-646ROO01 00090001-7
 both those controlled by the Nationalist govern-
 ment and those which were privately owned.
 On 1 October 1949, date of the formal establishment of the
 Chinese People's Republic, the central station in Peking was renamed
 the Central People's Broadcasting Station, described as "domestically
 speaking, an important tool in conducting political and cultural educa-
 tion among the people; internationally speaking, a weapon to make our
 peaceful foreign policy understood to other countries.... serving the
 nation's socialistic construction and world peace".
 The New China Broadcasting Station up to 1949 had been under
 the direct control and guidance of the Central Committee's Propa-
 ganda Department.  With the formalization of the government in Oc-
 tober 1949, the newly-named Central People's Broadcasting Station
 and all the other stations taken over in the regions, provinces and
 municipalities were brought together under the administrative con-
 trol of the Broadcasting Bureau, a part of the News Administration of
 the Government Administration Council.  Other organs also under the
 News Administration from 1949 until the administration was dissolved
 in August 1952, were the New China News Agency, 'he International
 News Bureau, the News Photographs Bureau, and the Peking School
 of Journalism.  CH'IAO Kuan-hua was director of the International
 News Bureau, with LIU Tsun-ch'i as his deputy.  CH'IAO is one of

 ment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which handles matters con-
 cerning foreign news representatives in Communist China.

 III            BROADCASTING FACILITIES
 The facilities of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau in
 Peking can be roughly broken down into:
 a-The domestic broadcasting stations (the home, minorities
 and Taiwan Services of the Central People's Broadcasting
 Station) ;
 b-The international broadcasting stations (the Central
 People's Broadcasting Station services in Chinese dialects
 and Radio Peking in foreign languages);
 c-The Chinese News Broadcasting Station (the China Press
 Agency service in voice at dictation speed interspersed with
 music and directed to Overseas Chinese and the Chinese
 vernacular press, largely in Southeast Asia);
 d-The television stations;
 e-Those employed in the monitoring of foreign newscasts,
 particularly programs from non-Communist nations.
 In January 1949 the Communists occupied Peking and took over
 the North China Broadcasting Station in that city.  By March, the party
 had begun to use this facility and in October 1949 established this as
 the Central People's Broadcasting Station.  There were 32 privately-
 owned broadcasting stations in China in 1950.  Of these 22 were in

 Shanghai, which by 1953 had been consolidated into 3 State-owned sta-
 tions.  By January 1954, the offices and studios of the Peking station,
 as well as the offices of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau,
 were moved to newly constructed buildings at Fuhsingmen in the western
 sector of Peking on the bank of the Huihung River.  An 11-story building
 with 30 studios was reported to be under construction there in April
 1958, having 170, 000 meters of floor space.
 An interview with two of Japan's leading radio-television ex-
 perts who visited the USSR and Communist China in 1960 (published in
 Asahi of 1 September 1960) quotes them as stating that the BAB, the
 Central People's Broadcasting Station (which controls all domestic
 radio broadcasts), the Peking Broadcasting Station (which is in charge
 of overseas broadcasts), and the Peking Television Station, are all
 located in a 10-story building completed toward the end of 1958.  There
 is a television antenna 150-meters tall atop this building.  Including
 those used for overseas broadcasts, there are 24 radio studios in this
 new building.  These Japanese visitors were told that the building was
 constructed under the guidance of Soviet experts, and they stated it
 was better than any they saw in the USSR in terms of appearance and
 equipment, surpassing even the new television station to be completed
 in Leningrad in December 1960.

 Development of the radio broadcasting and television network,
 of the relay stations, the rebroadcasting posts, and the listening post
 program is provided for in the Party/Government 5-year plan, which
 also include provisions for the production and acquisition of the trans-
 mission and receiving equipment necessary to carry out these plans.
 The BAB operates the Peking Central People's Broadcasting
 Station and directs the regional, provincial and other stations through-
 out the China mainland, as well as the network of rebroadcasting and
 receiving posts.  Being a state-owned enterprise, all those working
 for the BAB are employees of the government.
 By 1955 there was a total of 54 voice broadcasting stations in
 addition to the Peking Central Station, with programs totaling over
 580 hours a day, and about 5, 000 rebroadcasting posts in medium and
 small cities, mines, industrial installations, villages, and cooperatives.
 In addition to relaying programs originating from the Peking central
 station, the 54 stations originated many programs of their own, and
 five of these stations were in areas populated by ethnic minorities and
 originated programs in the languages native to such areas.
 On 16 December 1959 Radio Peking broadcast a news item to
 Vietnam from which the following excerpts are quoted:  "The country
 (Communist China) now has a complete radio industry of its own,

 capable of producing receiving and transmitting equipment for medium
 and short wave use as well as for high power transmission.  The Peking
 television broadcasting station- -China's first--began its casts officially
 in 1958. Its entire equipment had been produced locally in China.  The
 transmission power of the various broadcasting stations throughout
 China is 4. 8 times higher than during the 12 years from 1928 to 1947
 under the KMT sway.  Not only have we highpower transmission equip-
 ment but also a wide receiving system throughout our country.  In the
 national program for agricultural development it was stipulated that
 the broadcasting system in rural areas should be expanded.  By the first
 six months of this year (1959), over 7, 000 relay stations and some tens
 of thousands of receiving posts had been set up throughout the country,
 with people's communes acquiring more than 4, 000, 000 pieces of re-
 ceiving equipment.  There are receivers in the huge rural areas, in
 villages situated some thousands of meters above sea level, in Mon-
 golian huts in live-stock breeding areas, and on fishing boats....

 East Germany in the construction of technical facilities.  While the
 radio and television industry in Communist China is years behind other,
 technically advanced countries in the production of radio transmission
 and receiving equipment, a strenuous and apparently successful effort
 is being made under the series of 5-year plans to produce recorders,
 transformers, microphones, receivers, and other radio instruments
 and equipment.

 IV         DOMESTIC BROADCASTING SERVICES
 There are several types of domestic broadcast services broken
 down as follows:
 a-The home services, broadcast nationwide from Peking on
 short-wave and medium-wave.
 b-Peking broadcasts in appropriate dialects to minority nation-
 alities on short-wave, relayed by regional and local stations in
 the areas where these minorities reside.
 c-Broadcasts from Radio Peking to Taiwan on short-wave, re-
 layed by coastal medium-wave stations.
 d-Broadcasts originated at the regional and local stations through-
 out the China mainland.
 e-Programs picked up from broadcasts by relay stations and
 transmitted to the thousands of receiving posts over an extensive
 wired rediffusion network.
 f-Television programs over 18 stations serving major pop-
 ulated areas.
 Three home (nationwide domestic) broadcasts originate from
 Radio Peking.  These broadcasts are in Mandarin and parts of these
 services are relayed or rebroadcast by regional and municipal sta-
 tions throughout Communist China.  Home broadcasts were initiated
 prior to 1944.

 Approved For Relea                    P78-02646R000100090001-7
 The.regional and municipal broadcast stations also originate
 some programs of their own, the program material being subject to
 the control of the party-supervised editorial committees of each of
 these stations.  There are three services broadcast by the Central
 People's Broadcasting Station in Peking intended to reach only the
 local audience in Peking and its environs.  There are six such local
 broadcasts originating with the station in Shanghai, serving that city
 and its surrounding area.  Regional broadcasts began after the Chinese
 Communist takeover in 1949.
 Radio Peking originates broadcasts to minority nationalities
 on short-wave in Chuang, Korean, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uighur.
 These programs are picked up by stations in the appropriate areas and
 either rebroadcast or rediffused over the wired network.  Programs in
 Tibetan and Mongolian began in 1950; in Korean and Uighur in 1956; and
 in Chuang in 1957.
 In February 1950 special programs of 3 1/2 hours a week for
 Taiwan began as a part of the East China Regional Service out of
 Shanghai.  By September 1950 it had increased to 12 1/4 hours weekly
 of local programs and 7 hours of relayed programs from Peking.  These
 are considered as domestic broadcasts in line with the Chinese Com-
 munist contention that Taiwan is but a part of China "not yet liberated".

 Approved For Re                       78-02646R000100090001-7
 The service direct from Peking to Taiwan began in August 1954 and had
 increased to nearly 119 hours weekly by August 1960.  With the Chinese
 Communist attack on the offshore islands, the Chinese People's Army
 Fukien Front Broadcasting Station began operations in September 1958,
 and as of August 1960 its weekly output directed to Quemoy totaled about
 46 hours of local programs and 13 1/2 hours of Peking relays.
 A-WIRED BROADCASTING
 When the Chinese Communists came to power in 1949 there was
 no radio-diffusion network similar to that in the USSR.  This broad-
 casting or rediffusion system, picking up programs originating from
 the Central People's Broadcasting Station, from the regional and pro-
 vincial stations, and from the many relay stations, was said by the
 mainland press to have numbered 1, 591 wired broadcasting stations
 tied in with 590, 000 loudspeakers scattered throughout Communist
 China in communes, industrial plants, mines, railroad stations and
 trains, schools, and other locations where they reach large audiences.
 No valid figures are available as to the number of radio receiving
 sets privately owned in Communist China, but the network of listening
 posts, bringing the Party propaganda line and directives, as well as
 the tailored domestic and foreign news directed to captive audiences,
 largely obviates the necessity for individual ownership of receivers.

 By September 1955 the BAB claimed to have a network of some
 20, 000 receiving posts with units of the armed forces, and 10, 000 re-
 ceiving posts in rural districts.  Domestic broadcasts from the Peking
 central facility were said to have increased from 7 1/2 hours of pro-
 grams daily in 1949 to 19 hours a day in 1955, of which 30% were of a
 political nature.
 The two Japanese radio-television executives who visited Com-
 munist China in 1960 were quoted in the Tokyo press as stating they
 were told that there are 138 radio broadcasting stations through the
 China mainland, and that six million receiving sets are in use, half of
 them ordinary receivers, the other half closed-circuit (wired) ones.
 Major attention in production of radio receivers seems to have
 been on the very cheap models copied from Japanese and other foreign
 equipment, and the distribution of their receivers among the Chinese
 residing overseas as well as among the peoples of Southeast Asia to
 enable them to listen in on the extensive and expanding short-wave
 voice broadcasts beamed over the Chinese Communist international
 circuits.  There is now no radio license fee in Communist China and,
 since the only registration of receivers is by the Public Security
 Bureaus, no accurate estimate of the number of sets now in private
 hands is possible.  One source reported that there were about 2, 000, 000
 receivers in the entire nation in 1948, that the number may have

 increased to more than 4, 000, 000 by the end of 1957, and that most of
 them were old pre-war Japanese sets or imported from the Soviet bloc
 nations, although their production in mainland plants has notably increased.
 A report on world radio communications issued by UNESCO in
 1956 estimated that there were then 60 large radio stations in Com-
 munist China, 165 low-powered transmitters in operation, and the
 number of receiving sets was estimated at 1, 500, 000.  Another report
 stated that as of the end of 1956 there were 63 major broadcasting facili-
 ties on the China mainland.  Still another report stated that at the end
 of 1957 there were 60 large broadcasting stations and in this report it
 was estimated that there were 1, 500, 000 radio receivers and 1, 300, 000
 wired speakers.  It is believed that the number of broadcasting stations
 decreased from 71 (with 176 transmitters) in November 1952 to 59 in
 1954.  A broadcast over the Fukien provincial station in February 1960
 stated that the wired broadcasting system in one county alone in Fukien
 Province was reaching an estimated 600, 000 cadres, workers, peasants
 and People's Liberation Army personnel with its program of lectures
 on "MAO Tse-tung's thinking."
 A survey made by the Journal of the Federation of Japan Electri-
 cal Communication Industrial Associations in September 1956 said that
 the Communist Chinese regime planned to have 2, 173 broadcasting

 stations and 1, 346, 322 speakers throughout the country by the end of
 1956, with 43, 633 receiving centers, 25, 205 of these in producer's
 cooperatives.
 The National Conference on Rural Postal and Telephone Ser-
 vices held in Peking in December 1955, adopted a 7- to 12-year pro-
 gram to extend wire-line broadcasting facilities to all rural areas,
 envisioning 500, 000 speakers by the end of 1956, and 6, 700, 000 speakers
 by 1962 in rural areas distributing propaganda from 5, 600 central stations.
 A publication of the State Statistical Bureau was issued in Pek-
 ing in September 1959, titled The Great 10 Years -- Statistics on Eco-
 nomic and Cultural Achievements of the People's Republic of China in
 which it was said "In 1958, there were more than 6, 700 wired broad-
 casting stations, compared with 327 in 1952, a 20-fold increase.  Among
 them, rural commune broadcasting stations comprised more than 5, 000
 and a rural broadcasting network was basically established. "
 An article by Sripati Chandrasekhar, Indian social scientist,
 upon his return from a trip to Communist China in February 1959 con-
 tained the following comments:
 "Another thing that no one can escape is the
 ubiquitous wired radio loudspeaker.  The radio blares
 away at you in the bus, in the train, in the trolly, in
 sleepers and dining cars, on street corners, in villages,

 town and cities -- just about everywhere.
 "And what does this radio pour out day and
 night?    It is the most important medium for ap-
 proved news -- news of the nation's progress,
 industrial output, how to make a smelter, how to
 defeat the American imperialists, how to be a
 good Communist, how to be neat, how to de-
 nounce the rightists and a thousand other things,
 interspersed with Chinese opera and marching
 songs.
 "The reason behind the loudspeaker is
 really a simple one.  In a far-flung nation of
 650, 000, 000, where literacy is not widespread
 and where, consequently, the printed word is
 relatively ineffective, the only way to reach
 the citizen is via the radio in the relaying loud-
 speaker that cannot be controlled and cannot even
 be turned off. "
 Two qualified radio television observers who visited Communist
 China early in 1960 reported that television was formally inaugurated

 in Peking in September 1958, after experimental testing beginning the
 previous April.   The Peking Television Station is located in the same
 building with the central broadcasting facilities and Radio Peking.  The
 television station has three studios, one of 600, another of 150 and the
 third of 30 square meters; six cameras and two relay cars.  Some are
 Soviet-made and others are produced in Communist China.     The station
 also has a hall that can seat 1, 200 persons.  Soviet technicians assisted
 in building the station.  These observers were told that the Peking Tele-
 vision Station had video output power of 2. 5 kilowatts and audio output
 power of 5 kilowatts.  There are 18 television stations on the mainland in-
 cluding those in Peking, Tientsin, Shanghai, Canton, Wuhan, Nanking,
 Mukden, Changchun, Harbin, Anshan, and Tsingtao, some of them relay
 stations.  Because of the limited microwave transmission system, films
 are used in most cases for network broadcasts.
 A technician who had worked in Communist China as an advisor re-
 ported that a system of 20 to 30 microwave links, each with a capacity of
 240 to 300 channels and operated on a frequency of 4, 000 megacycles, had
 been built there by the end of 1959.
 The Peking Television Station broadcasts 3 hours daily from 6:30
 to 10 p. m. , plus 3 hours from 9 a. m. to noon on Sundays.  Programs con-
 sist of newsreels, educational programs stressing public morality, des-
 criptions of drama, singing, music, and many newscasts.                                    Half of the

 V       INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING SERVICES
 Although there were possibly some broadcasts beamed to foreign
 listeners prior to 1949, the service did not develop into one of im-
 portance until after the Chinese Communists acquired the facilities of
 Radio Peking in 1949.
 Using high-powered transmitters, Radio Peking's international
 voice broadcast services as of September 1960 included programs total-
 ing more than 510 hours per week, which is a larger volume than any
 other international broadcasting service except for Radio Moscow, the
 British Broadcasting Corporation, and the Voice of America.
 The international services use 19 short-wave transmitters,
 several of which have 120 kilowatts of power.  The first of the more
 powerful transmitters came into operation in January 1956.  One short-
 wave transmitter is shared with the domestic voice broadcast services.
 Three medium-wave transmitters are also used by the international
 voice services.  Two new powerful medium-wave transmitters were
 completed in South China in 1960 .
 The following tabulation indicates the rapid growth of Communist
 China's international voice broadcasting service, which includes news
 and propaganda broadcasts, music and other programs:

 Most of the news programs on these voice broadcasts are taken

 time, prepared by the Party organs or picked up from editorials pub-
 blished in the Party-controlled press, while other items originate
 from government offices such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 International voice broadcasts are presently made in at least
 19 foreign languages, in addition to five Chinese dialects:  Mandarin,
 Cantonese, Amoy, Hakka and Chaochow (Taishan was formerly used
 in some broadcasts to North America but was discontinued).  The most
 commonly used foreign language in September 1960 was English (112
 hours a week), followed by Japanese (31 1/2 hours a week), and Spanish
 (28 hours weekly).  Other languages used are:  French, Arabic, Thai,
 Indonesian, Vietnamese, Korean, Laotian, Burmese, Cambodian,
 Malay, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, German, Portuguese, and Italian.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24 :  A-     8-02646R000100090001-7
 Programs in Arabic to North Africa and the Middle East have increased
 significantly since they began in November 1957.  Those in Spanish to
 South and Central America have more than tripled in volume since they
 were begun in December 1957. Radio Peking began a schedule of seven
 hours of Portuguese language broadcasts directed to the Portuguese
 colonies in Africa in October 1960.
 In May 1955 programs beamed from Radio Peking or via relay
 stations directed to communities of Chinese residing overseas totaled
 11 1/2 hours daily in five Chinese dialects.
 Radio Peking voice broadcasts seem to be received adequately
 in all target areas.  Communist China is not a member of the Interna-
 tional Telecommunications Union, and therefore is not bound by agree-
 ment between members of the body regulating use of short-wave broad-
 cast frequencies.
 Generally speaking, announcers and translators presenting the
 foreign language broadcasts are capable, and have good accent and
 diction.  Most appear to be Chinese who were either born or educated
 in the countries whose languages they use.  However, foreigners re-
 cruited from or by the Communist Parties in their home countries have
 gone to Peking to work in the sections which prepare and present pro-
 grams in their native languages.

 A commonly used device in the Chinese Communist propaganda
 program is to beam back to their native countries, in the native lang-
 uage, broadcasts participated in by foreigners visiting the mainland
 either as individuals or as members of delegations.  Similarly, Chinese
 returning to Peking from visits abroad, particularly outside the Com-
 munist orbit, are used to exploit their trip with speeches beamed back
 to the countries they visited.  Such use is also made of Chinese who have
 resided overseas and know the foreign language, and of others who are
 returning to the mainland either as visitors or to reside there permanently.
 These broadcasts, as well as the answers and comments given on the
 "Listeners Letter Box", a regular feature on the English and Japanese
 language programs and broadcasts in Mandarin to Southeast Asia, are
 heavy with propaganda appeals for recognition of Communist China,
 arguements for the opening or expansion of trade, encouragement of
 cultural exchanges and tirades against "U. S. imperialism and
 colonialism.
 "Listeners Letter Box" is also among the programs beamed
 to Latin America.  On 4 April 1960, ostensibly in reply to questions
 concerning Communist China radio broadcasting service from a listener
 in Columbia, a reply was read in Spanish beamed to Central America,
 Mexico and the Antilles which claimed that whereas in the Central
 Broadcasting Station operated 15 years ago in a cave, it was now in a

 "real palace", one of the most beautiful buildings in Peking; that it was
 part of an organization of powerful transmitters and an extensive net-
 work of receiving stations; that the central station had dozens of studios,
 magnetic recording equipment, four large artistic groups and its own
 orchestra; and that it broadcasts in 26 languages (24 are actually on
 Radio Peking, while taped programs in 2 Russian languages are broad-
 cast on Soviet transmitters).  In this same broadcast Radio Peking told
 of plans to inaugurate programs in Portuguese; claimed that production
 of long, medium and short-wave receivers in Communist China exceeded
 350, 000 per year, and that many letters were received from Latin
 American listeners.
 From the beginning of their broadcasting enterprise in 1945, the
 central broadcasting station has solicited listener response.  An article
 in the Kuang-po Ai-hao-che in September 1955 claimed that letters re-
 ceived from the domestic audience were at an annual rate of 80., 000, and
 those from the foreign listeners in 48 countries were at the rate of 6, 6 00
 People's China magazine for October 1956 claimed that the
 Chinese Communist broadcasting organization had made contact, direct
 or indirect, with opposite numbers in 38 countries, and had joined the
 International Broadcasting Organization (OIR --international communist
 front organization).  The name of this organization has now been changed

 to International Radio and Television Organization (OIRT), and Communist
 China is a member.
 Formal broadcasting agreements have been negotiated between
 the Chinese Communist Government and all 10 countries of the Sino-Soviet
 Bloc whereunder there is an exchange of taped and recorded entertainment
 and "cultural" programs.  These agreements provide for the exchange of
 personnel for training as announcers.  Motion pictures for use on Cuban
 television have been sent from Peking to the Havana bureau of the New
 China News Agency.  Arrangements also have been made with private
 commercial broadcasting stations in Burma, Indonesia and Japan (the
 Japanese Commercial Broadcasting Corporation of Tokyo is an example)
 for the exchange of program material.  Such material is not usually
 blatant propaganda but is more subtle, stressing the cultural and other
 advancements in China and other aspects of "people's diplomacy".
 Mention should also be made of the clandestine services rendered
 to the Communist cause by the Broadcasting Administration Bureau.
 Facilities of the Central People's Broadcasting Station in the Western
 suburbs of Peking are known to have been used beginning in 1952 to broad-
 cast the Radio Free Japan voice programs (with an output of 500 kw)
 beamed to Japan as the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of Japan
 (CPJ).  These programs were discontinued in late 1955.  Radio Free

 VI       PRESS TRANSMISSIONS
 The Red China News Agency had been founded in January 1932
 at the capital of the Chinese Soviet Zone in Kiangsi as a component of
 the Red China Newspaper Agency and probably supplied the news car-
 ried on the morse code broadcasts.  By September 1937, the news agency
 was established as a department of the New China Newspaper Agency
 under the title New China News Agency (NCNA) and by 1939 was made
 a separate organ of the Party.  Also by 1937, the Party had established
 more than 100 newspapers serving the Communist military forces and
 the border regions of North and Central China which received Party
 directives 0and the New China News Agency file, still in morse code?
 At that time equipment of the NCNA is said to have consisted of one
 100-watt transmitter and two 3-tube receiving sets, all old, rebuilt
 equipment.  To obtain news from the Nationalist-held areas of the China
 mainland, the KMT Central News Agency broadcasts were monitored.
 The NCNA also monitored newscasts sourced to the Domei News Agency
 in Tokyo, the French Havas News Agency, and some broadcasts over
 the TASS and Transocean circuits.
 When the News Administration of the State Council was abolished,
 the International News Bureau and News Photographs Bureau apparently
 were placed under the New China News Agency, which, in 1952 was made
 a special agency under the State Council, while the Broadcasting Bureau

 became the Broadcasting Administration Bureau (BAB), another special
 An article in the 25 August 1957 issue of the Peking periodical
 News and Publishing describing the monitoring of foreign newscasts in
 the 1930's said in part:  "Important items received went to the press and
 the remainder was sent to responsible persons of the Party, the military
 and the administration, for reference.  For news distribution, the Agency
 (NCNA) had then a 100-watt transmitter for domestic broadcast at 1, 500
 words a day, containing important foreign and domestic news items for
 the progressive groups, underground Party organs and United Front
 organizations in the country.  The coverage in the main introduced the
 progress of construction and work in the frontier zone.... With the out-
 break of the July 7th incident in 1937.... its interception of foreign news-
 casts broadened to the extent that people of the frontier zone and other
 anti-Japanese bases were kept well informed of the international and
 domestic developments.  Its newscasts rose from 1, 500 words to 4, 000
 to 5, 000 words a day.  By 1939 it had five instead of two 3-tube receiving
 sets and its 100-watt transmitter was replaced with a 500-watt transmitter
 for domestic broadcasts.
 "In 1941, it set up a communication station, linking direct with
 its sub-bureau in the field headquarters of the Eighth Route Army and
 strengthening its reporting on the progress of the war.  At the time of

 the Japanese capitulation (1945), the Agency already was in regular con-
 tact with its sub-bureaus and branches (6 or more).  The Station was
 then using a small 15-watt transceiver and a 15-watt hand-operated
 motor.  The Agency began its English broadcast to foreign countries
 in 1942, twice a day 1 1/2 to 2 hours each.  In 1943, it built up a
 voice broadcast for listeners in the country.  The Agency's reporting,
 dissemination of the Party's measures and politics, transmission of
 the Central Committee's directives, promotion of the exchange of work
 experiences and direction of the nation's work and struggle, gave the
 Agency the role of a national paper....
 "At that time (about 1946 or 1947), it broadcast 8, 000 to 12, 400
 words per day covering domestic and foreign news.  In 1948, it received
 from 30 radio stations broadcasts of foreign news, and established in
 the same year,  its first foreign bureau in Prague....
 "The New China News Agency has 31 sub-bureaus in various
 provinces and the capitals of autonomous regions as well as in Peking,
 Shanghai, Tientsin, and Anshan, in the volunteer army, and on the sea
 fronts.  These bureaus send to the head office about 50, 000 words a
 day.... The Agency has 23 foreign bureaus (1957).... (which) send to the
 head office a wordage of 10, 000 per day.... At the receiving end (Peking
 and Shanghai), the Agency takes down the broadcasts from more than 40
 stations of the 30 foreign news agencies, totaling about 300, 000 words

 code although only morse code was monitored in 1949.   The method of
 foreign transmission, which was only in morse code last year (1956), has
 been improved to include radioteletype and hellschreiber, raising the ef-
 ficiency by one to two-fold.                     The Agency has as large as 50-kilowatt
 transmitters now; before 1949 it had only one-kilowatt transmitters.  Its
 domestic broadcasts are delivered by the copying (hellschreiber) method
 at 6, 000 words per hour, faster by one-fold than the 3, 000 words per hour
 hellschreiber used in 1956, and more than three-fold the 1, 700 words per

 had before 1949, it now has 10-kilowatt transmitters for domestic broad-
 cast. "

 There are three principal domestic newscast services, consisting
 principally of the NCNA file and items from the party-controlled Peking
 press.   A news dictation service is broadcast in a volume of approximately
 36 hours a week, one program in the morning for county level newspapers
 and radio stations, and another program in the afternoon for the county
 level press.  Another service, amounting to 84 1/2 hours a week, is trans-
 mitted in Chinese hellschreiber (facsimile principle which is received in
 characters on tape) to the domestic press.  This service is also beamed on
 one transmitter to Hong Kong and can be received well in Vietnam.  A
 third service in in Chinese numerical code beamed to the provincial level
 press, amounting to approximately 49 hours a week, and includes selected
 items from the Chinese hellschreiber service.   This provided a total of
 169 1/2 hours a week of news in early 1960 intended specifically for use in
 the press and by radio stations.  No statistics are available on the present
 total wordage broadcast on these newscasts.

 News broadcast in voice over the domestic and international chan-
 nels originates from several sources.  Some of the material is in the
 form of Party and government directives originating from Peking.  Most
 of this news is gathered by the NCNA bureaus throughout China and chan-
 neled through the BAB editorial committee in Peking.  Editorials broad-
 cast are selected from the Party's official newspaper in Peking, Jen-min
 Jih Pao (People's Daily),  in addition to the other news items, editorials
 and propaganda from such papers as the Liberation Daily, China Youth
 Daily, the Daily Worker and the Kwangming Daily.
 News from outside China comprises that obtained from NCNA of-
 fices and correspondents abroad, and that acquired through monitoring of
 newscasts originating in other countries, principally from TASS, Reuters,
 Agence France Presse, and news broadcasts from American and Japanese
 stations.   This monitoring is done at Peking and Shanghai, and the items
 to be given domestic distribution by broadcast and newscast for use by the
 domestic press are carefully selected, edited and reshaped to conform with
 Chinese Communist policy and the propaganda line, or to denigrate the
 nations of the free world, particularly the United States.  Official Chinese
 Communist reactions to and comments on such foreign news events or
 policy statements are compiled by the editorial committee on the NCNA
 under supervision of the Foreign Ministry and the Communist Party, and
 often broadcast within hours of the time the news is received in Peking.

 Beginning 20 August 1955 the NCNA main file was transmitted over
 hellschreiber (Chinese numeral code) in addition to morse in Chinese
 numeral code.  All items were first transmitted over hellschreiber and
 repeated in morse.  After 1 January 1956 the NCNA main file was trans-
 mitted only in hellschreiber in Chinese numeral code.  Selected items from
 this file were given on a new service in morse in Chinese numeral code.
 NCNA conducted test transmissions in Chinese script facsimile
 beginning 1 August 1956.   Gradual changover from hellschreiber trans-
 mission (Chinese numeral code) to facsimile transmission (Chinese script)
 began on 22 August 1956.   By 3 September 1956, all hellschreiber trans-
 missions (Chinese numeral code) had been changed over to facsimile trans-
 missions (Chinese script- -handwritten,  simplified Chinese characters
 transmitted at approximately 90 characters per minute).
 NCNA transmitted with directional antennae beginning 27 March
 1957.   By early December 1957,  directional antennae were used extensively
 in transmitting the NCNA main file over facsimile (Chinese script).  NCNA
 tested at 104 characters per minute on 18 and 19 November 1958 as com-
 pared with the old speed of approximately 90 characters per minute.
 Tests were conducted by NCNA with a "new type of characters" on
 9 and 10 March 1960.  Characters used in test transmissions were smaller
 than the characters used in regular transmissions.  The new characters
 appeared to be mechanically printed whereas the characters previously
 used were handwritten.   Use of the new small characters, based on the

 same number of program hours, would increase the volume of wordage by
 up to 50 %.

 Some brief comments should be made concerning incoming foreign
 news other than that obtained from the monitoring of the newscast schedules
 of some of the foreign press services and the voice news broadcasts of the
 principal radio stations of the world.  Between Moscow and Peking there is
 a twinplex teletype system with two channels.  One side is used to tranmit
 the TASS service to Moscow, and the other to send the NCNA news file
 to Peking.  A large volume of traffic passes over this circuit, which
 operates 20 hours daily.  Details are not available as to how the NCNA
 bureaus and correspondents in Europe, particularly those in the Communist
 40

 bloc areas, transmit their file to Peking, but some of it goes via Moscow
 and this twinplex circuit.  Special arrangements may exist for the use of
 circuits for the capitals of these bloc countries in exchange for equal time
 on Peking commercial facilities for transmitting news from Communist
 China by correspondents of these countries stationed in Peking.  Point-
 to-point facilities in Peking and all of these bloc capitals handle by radio
 telegraph circuits much of the news and many of the service messages
 passing to and from Peking.  NCNA leases time on commercial trans-
 mitters in various non-Communist countries in varying degrees.                              In
 Indonesia, for example, NCNA leases whole transmission periods and
 transmits a relatively large amount of news to Peking.  This same pro-
 cedure is followed in some other countries to a lesser degree.  In some
 countries the volume is small and is filed to Peking through the regular
 commercial press facilities used by other news services and publications.
 Detailed data are not available as to the nature of the agreements
 signed between NCNA and the several non-Communist press services,
 (Reuters, Agence France Presse, and ANTARA of Indonesia) through which
 there is an exchange of their press files, but since there is no charge
 for or copyright on the NCNA material, it is presumed that at least a part
 of the international news files of these other services are also available to
 the NCNA without charge.  In view of the fact that all foreign news incoming

 to Communist China passes through Peking and is there screened and edited
 by the NCNA before it is distributed for publication and broadcast, the
 Chinese Communists are able to exercise censorship by omission, and to
 delay, slant or twist this news in such a fashion as they may desire.  Simi-
 larly, because all news exiting from China is either contained in the NCNA
 file or must be filed by foreign correspondents (bloc or non-bloc) to their
 home offices through government controlled facilities in Peking, it is
 possible to exercise complete control over news from the China mainland
 which reaches the outside world.  While dispatches filed by foreign cor-
 respondents (including those from the Communist bloc) are not known to be
 subjected to formal, overt censorship, the activities and dispatches of all
 the foreign press (whether stationed in Peking or only transiting China)
 are closely monitored and controlled by the Information (Intelligence) De-
 partment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which can in effect impose a
 form of censorship by restricting a correspondent's movements, contacts
 and access to news, making his presence in China unproductive, if not
 untenable.

 VII      ORGANIZATION OF THE BROADCASTING ADMINISTRATION
 While under the close political and ideological control of the Central
 Committee's Propaganda Department, the Broadcasting Administration
 Bureau is administratively under the Staff Office for Culture and Educa-
 tion of the State Council.  All the broadcasting as well as the organiza-
 tion for development of techniques and maintenance facilities, are under
 the BAB, the organization of which is described on the attached chart.
 As a wholly-owned organ of the State, the BAB and its activities as
 well as the Central People's Broadcasting Station are financed out of the
 State budget, as is the New China News Agency.  The regional, provincial
 and other voice broadcasting stations, as well as the relay stations and
 wire broadcasting system are probably funded out of the budgets of the
 administrative areas they serve.  All employees of the BAB and the broad-
 casting stations are government employees.  No advertising is carried
 other than for other organs of the state and local government, thus there
 is no revenue from the operations of the broadcasting system.  Funds to
 cover the cost of operations are undoubtedly included within the culture
 and education portions of the Central and local government budgets.
 It has been reported that as of the end of 1957 approximately 3, 000
 persons were employed in the Broadcasting Administration Bureau and the
 Central People's Broadcasting organization, with about 1, 200 employed in

 Approved For                  RMPPRDP78-02646ROO01
 regional and local stations throughout the country. According to this report,
 the BAB did not at that time employ any Soviet or other foreign technicians.
 Chinese Communist Party Committees are to be found within the
 BAB, the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and all the regional, pro-
 vincial and other stations.  These committees provide the party control
 and furnish ideological guidance.  There are also editorial committees in
 the various divisions of the BAB and in the stations originating programs,
 most of the members of which are undoubtedly assigned there by the Pro-
 paganda Departments of the Central and lower level Party Committees.  In
 addition, the Party Committee and editorial committee of the NCNA and
 China Press Agency control the contents of the press files made available
 for newscasts carried on these broadcasting facilities.
 The attached chart shows the organizational structure of the Broad-
 casting Administration Bureau and the key personnel who have been identi-
 fied.                     This chart is based on data from various reports and publications.
 A considerable part of the information is dated in early 1958.  In order to
 make the chart more meaningful, it would be well to briefly describe the
 functions and operations of the various component parts of the BAB.  So
 far as is known, the present organization of the BAB is substantially the
 same as that approved by the State Council in April 1958.

 Guidance and political control of the BAB stems from the Pro-
 paganda Department of the CCP Central Committee.                    Administrative
 control is under the State Council.  The Staff Office for Culture and Educa-
 tion of the State Council is the means of channeling direction to the BAB from
 the State Council.  LU Ting-i, Director of the Propaganda Department of
 the Party, is one of 16 Vice Premiers of the State Council.  HSU Mai-chin,
 one of the five Deputy Directors of the Staff Office, is a propaganda special-
 ist who has concentrated on the broadcasting phase of his specialty, was a
 Deputy Director of the BAB from 1949 to about 1957, and is probably still
 the responsible person in the Staff Office for broadcasting activities.
 Director of the BAB is MEI I, a veteran CCP member with long
 experience in the propaganda and broadcasting field, and believed by some
 to head a broadcasting section of the Propaganda Department of the Central
 Committee, although WEN Chi-tse, former Deputy of BAB,  may hold
 this position.  MEI is also a member of the Board of Directors of the New
 China News Agency.  Deputy Directors of the BAB are CHIN Chao, CHOU
 Hsin, KU Wen-hua, LI Wu, TSO Mo-yeh, TUNG Lin, and WEN Chi-tse.
 Each has an area of specialty in the broadcasting field.  It may be safely
 said that all important posts in the BAB are held by CCP members.
 The 11-member Party Committee of the BAB wields the real power
 in the Bureau and the secretary of this committee (LI P'ing held the post
 in 1958 and was also a member of the Central Editorial Committee)

 maintains direct contact with the Party leaders in the State Council and
 Propaganda Department of the CCP on matters involving policy.  In addi-
 tion, there are Party branches in the divisions and departments.
 The Central Editorial Committee is basically responsible for the
 content of material to be broadcast on the domestic and international ser-
 vices, particularly that of a political nature.  There is probably con-
 siderable interlocking membership on this committee and the Party Com-
 mittee.               Its principal concern is with the material to be broadcast over
 the international circuits.  All scripts of importance are referred to higher
 party organs and to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review in advance of
 broad casting.
 CHOU Hsin-wu is reported to be Deputy Director of the BAB in
 charge of the Administration Bureau, or Secretariat, which is believed-to
 handle the day-to-day administrative work such as personnel and finance.
 LI Wu is reported to be the Deputy Director of the Technical Staff
 of the BAB under which falls the Basic Construction Bureau, responsible
 for building and enlarging stations and studios, and the Radio Wave Con-
 trol Bureau.  A. Research Office (or Institute) for Radio Television ap-
 pears also to be under the Technical Staff.  Radio Peking on 19 January 1960
 said:  "A Radio Broadcast Research Institute has been established to guide
 the study of radio broadcast and television techniques.  Equipment for

 China's first television station, the Peking station, was designed and manu-
 factured by this institute in concert with other departments. "
 To little is known of this institute and its personnel to discuss it
 in any detail, but it was undoubtedly created to conduct technical and scien-
 tific research in the fields of radio and television.  Director of the institute
 was reported in April 1959 to be LIU Yung-yeh who in that month repre-
 sented the BAB at the Asian regional meeting of the International Broad-
 casting Organization in North Korea.  Whether this institute is an inde-
 pendent body or under the Academy of Sciences is not clear.  In May 1959
 announcement was made of the formation of an Institute of Radio Engineer-
 ing and Electronics in Peking under the auspices of the Academy, headed
 by KU Te-huan with MA T.a.-yu as deputy director.  Both of these men had
 been previously identified (1957) as being with the Academy of Science's
 Institute of Electronics, which had a number of department's including ones
 for ultrasonics and microwave study and development.
 Radio Peking on 19 January 1960 stated "The state has also set up a
 modern college, the Peking Broadcasting College, for the training of techni-
 cal cadres to handle radio broadcasts, television editing, reporting, and re-
 lated jobs. "  This college is most likely a part of the general training pro-
 gram under the Administration Bureau.  Whether this is a part of or related
 to the School of Journalism at Peking University is not known.  The School
 of Journalism was reported in early 1958 to have 350 students enrolled be-
 ing trained for jobs with newspapers, news agencies and radio stations.

 The Domestic Broadcasting Division,  is headed by LIU Tsu-yun
 (or LIU Tsu-lun) who is probably a member of the Central Editorial Com-
 mittee.  His deputy is CHIN Chao.  This Division also has its own Editor-
 ial Committee of which CHIN Chao is concurrently the head, to insure
 compliance with the propaganda policies of the Party's Central Committee.
 Members of this Editorial Committee include the director of the BAB,
 some of the deputy directors, and the heads of the departments under this
 division.   There are seven departments under the Domestic Broadcasting
 Division as follows:
 News and Commentaries Department:   Composed entirely of Party and
 Youth League members, this department prepares and edits manuscripts
 of commentaries and news items to be used in propaganda voice broad-
 casts in support of the Party line.  It probably also selects and processes
 the news items from the NCNA file, incoming foreign news, and editor-
 ials from the Party press and other newspapers which are to be trans-
 mitted on the newscasts to the press throughout the China mainland.  This
 department has under it sections called Military Affairs, Industry, Agri-
 culture, Current Affairs, and Political.
 Regional Broadcasting Department:   Maintains contact with the broad-
 casting stations at regional, provincial and lower levels in matters in-
 volving program content, personnel assignment, technical data, and

 organizations having jurisdiction over the local stations on matters involv-
 ing policy.
 Peking (or Capital) Broadcasting Department:   The Peking Central People's
 Broadcasting Station is considered a local station in the network under the
 BAB, but, being located in the capital city, it is administered and directed
 by the Domestic Broadcasting Division of the BAB to ensure coordination
 of policy and for reasons of economy.  Radio Peking on 15 June 1960 named
 WENG Szu-ying as "chief of the broadcasting unit of the Central People's
 Broadcasting Station. "
 Science and Culture Department:  Its function is to develop and supervise
 programs and manuscripts dealing with scientific, technicological and
 cultural subjects.
 Minority Nationalities Department:  Directs the preparation of programs
 and the operations of those facilities used to carry propaganda and news to
 the ethnic minorities who are widely dispersed throughout Communist
 China.

 Communists hold to the concept that Taiwan is a part of one China but
 "not yet liberated",  its programs and news broadcasts are under the
 control of the Foreign Broadcasting Division and are subject to review
 before broadcasting by Foreign Ministry specialists on Taiwan.  This
 department also receives close policy guidance from the United Front and
 Propaganda Departments of the CCP Central Committee.  It may also be
 the department in which the Fukien Front (Quemoy) broadcasts and news-
 casts are prepared and controlled.
 Television Department:   In view of the limited scope of the television
 network, this was set up as a department of the Domestic Broadcasting
 Division, but it is to be anticipated that as the network grows in size, it
 will be converted into a separate division under the Broadcasting Adminis-
 tration Bureau.
 One of the features of the television programs is a so-called "tele-
 vision university" inaugurated by the Peking station in February or March
 1960, and by the Shanghai station on 6 April 1960.  Lectures are given in
 connection with courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry.  An
 NCNA newscast of 7 April 1960 stated that more than 8, 500 workers, pea-
 s ants, government functionaries, and army officers gathered to listen
 to the first Shanghai program.
 According to a Radio Peking broadcast on 3 May 1960:

 Approved For Release                     -02646R000100090001-7
 "A radio and television university with 8, 000 students has now been
 established in Shenyang, covering political theory, Chinese, Russian, and
 agriculture in its broadcasting section and mathematics and physics in its
 television section.  A similar university with 11, 000 students has also been
 set up in Harbin, the big Northeast China industrial center.  Its broad-
 casting section, which includes the study of Chinese and foreign languages,
 is mainly for the training of teachers.  The radio university of the Yenpien
 Korean Autonomous Chou in Northeast China is divided into departments
 for the convenience of the members of the people's communes.  It has
 courses in political theory, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and Chinese
 and specialized courses in agriculture, animal husbandry, and mechanics.
 In addition, the above departments or the division as a whole, most
 likely have functional sections for general affairs, announcing, editing,
 translation, typing and printing of manuscripts, library, music and drama,
 recording, and others.  News used on voice broadcasts is received from
 the New China News Agency and as a result of monitoring the news of
 foreign press agencies and radio stations.  When the NCNA news file is
 received by the BAB,  it is in galley proofs or in hellschreiber on tapes.
 Announcements and directives received from Central Party Headquarters
 or from central government organs, particularly the Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs, are priority items which must be given special attention.  The

 BAB is also reported to have its own small staff or reporters.  After edit-
 ing and preparation of the news file in rough draft, it is checked by the
 section or department head (and if necessary referred by him to higher
 authority), then translated in the required language or dialect, typed in
 finished form, and distributed to the appropriate section for broadcasting.
 Commentaries are sometimes simply editorials picked up from the People's
 Daily, or other official CCP publications.  There is also a small group in
 the News and Commentaries Department which prepares commentaries or
 solicits them from appropriate Party or government organs.
 The BAB suffered to some degree in the early days due to a short-
 age of technical personnel, and up to 1958 from a lack of qualified writers.
 Because both the BAB and NCNA are state-controlled organs, the writing
 talents of their personnel are interchangeable.  A similar situation pre-
 vails fo far as professional musical and dramatic talent is concerned.
 There was a report in 1957 that the name of the Domestic Broad-
 casting Division would be changed to Central Broadcast General Bureau,
 but such action has not been confirmed.
 B-FOREIGN BROADCASTING DIVISION
 Chief of this division is WEN Chi-tse, one of the deputy directors
 of the BAB, with which he has been associated from at least 1952.  WEN
 has been active since then in negotiating broadcasting agreements with

 other members of the Sino-Soviet Bloc and is one of Communist China's
 most active participants in two of the international communist front organ-
 izations, the International Organization of Journalists and the International
 Broadcasting Organization, headquartered in Prague, of which he has been
 a vice chairman since 1955. He may also head the Broadcasting Section
 of the CCP Propaganda Department, and is believed to be director of the
 International Liaison Division.
 The Editorial Committee or Board under the Foreign Broadcasting
 Division, composed largely of the heads of the departments under the divi-
 sion, works in close harmony with the Party's Foreign Section and the
 government Foreign Ministry on matters of radio broadcasting policy and
 draws upon the talents of the area experts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 Senior members of this committee, according to one report, held
 semi-monthly meetings with representatives of the Foreign Ministry, the
 CCP Central Committee's International Liaison Department (Foreign
 Section), the New China News Agency, People's Daily,  and the "Fblitical
 Affairs Study Group" (this is probably the Chinese People's Institute of
 Foreign Affairs--PIFA).  Sessions concerning English language programs
 were said to be headed by HUANG Hua of the Foreign Ministry and director
 of the Research Department of the PIFA.  Programs directed to the Jap-
 anese audience were reportedly under the guidance of LIAO Ch'eng-chih.

 The Editorial Board of this division, believed to be headed by TSOU
 Shao-ch'ing, prepares the manuscripts for material to be used in foreign
 broadcasts.  Source material comes from the Foreign Ministry, the New
 China News Agency, the People's Daily, other press agencies, and official
 releases of the Party and government. While this department reviews the
 news to be used on voice broadcasts, its principal task is to prepare pro-
 grams of a political nature expounding the official Party line.  The organ-
 ization of the Editorial Board is as follows:
 Secretariat Section:   Handles personnel and administrative matters, in-
 cluding those involving foreigners working for the division as area and
 language specialists.
 Data Section:   Keeps a library which includes information for use as
 reference material in preparing programs such as books, magazines and
 newspapers from foreign countries.
 Script and Correspondence Section:  Prepares finished copies of manu-
 scripts for use in broadcasting.
 Domestic Section:  Selects and rewrites domestic news items to suit
 Chinese Communist goals as they apply to specific nations or areas to
 which they are to be broadcast.   This section has a small staff of re-
 porters.  It also writes introductions and announcements for use on en-
 tertainment programs for foreign broadcast.

 News and Commentary Section:   Prepares commentaries on international
 news, analyses of international situations and political essays explaining
 and defining Communist China's foreign policy and reactions to foreign
 policy moves by other nations.  The importance of the wcrk of this section
 necessitates closest coordination with the Politburo through the BAB Party
 Committee, and with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   The staff of this
 section is composed of highly trained Party theorists and propagandists.
 English is reported to be the basic language, in addition to Chinese, used
 in preparing the commentaries and analyses.
 1-FIRST BROADCASTING DEPARTMENT
 This department of the Foreign Broadcasting Division is headed by
 TSO Mo-yeh, who is concurrently a deputy director of the BAB and pro-
 bably a member of the BAB Party Committee.   TSO reportedly was trans-
 ferred to this post from the New China News Agency in 1955, is said to be
 an influential theorist and specialist on international affairs, and to have
 prepared studies on international problems, particularly concerning
 Chinese Communist policy vis-a-vis the United States.
 This department has five sections and four sub-sections.   The
 sections are broken down according to language:  English, Arabic, French,
 and Persian.  The English section, the largest and most active, prepares
 programs targeted at the U. S. , Britain, Canada and other English-speaking
 Approved For Release 1                     2646R000100090001-7
 Approved For Release                  P78-02646R000100090001-7
 areas, including areas where U. S. troops are stationed.  The importance
 of the English section is seen from the fact that the director and two of his
 deputies, CHANG Hua and LI Te-pai, devote their efforts principally
 toward the U. S.  CHANG concentrates on attacking U. S. policies and
 actions.  LI, a former resident and citizen of the U. S. , may be a Cau-
 casion, is reported to have taken the Chinese name when he joined the Com-
 munists in Yenan in 1943, worked for the New China News Agency and as
 a broadcaster, reportedly was in the USSR from 1951 to 1957, and his
 specialty is said to be in editing manuscripts in English to insure ideomatic
 accuracy.   Another deputy head of this department is LI Yeh-shan, who is
 reported to have returned from the USSR in 1957.
 There are four sub-sections, for editing, announcing, compilation of
 data and the filing of letters received from listeners.  In addition to
 Chinese repatriates who were born or lived for a time in the U. S. and
 England, this department also employs non-Chinese as editors, writers
 and announcers.  One of these is the Eurasian wife of an English expatriate,
 who is one of the English newscasters for Radio Peking.  This expatriate
 is an advisor to the English language department for the NCNA, and has been
 in Peking for over 10 years as correspondent for a Communist publication.
 The head of the BAB Arabic Section is a former member of the Central
 Committee of the Communist Party of Jordan who was hired while in

 exile in Syria in 1957 or 1958.   Irene Hoa has been reported to be head of
 the French Section.  One announcer for the French broadcasts was re-
 cruited by the Communist Party of a Western European country for a two
 year tour of duty with Radio Peking. Similar use is made of foreign
 nationals in preparing scripts for programs and acting as announcers.
 It is of interest to note that two Sudanese, one of them an employee
 of the Arabic Section of the Foreign Broadcasting Division of the BAB,
 accompanied the Chinese Communist delegation to the Second Afro-Asian
 Peoples' Conference in Conkary in April 1960 but efforts to have them
 recognized as official Sudanese delegates to the conference were unsuc-
 cessful.
 Chief of the Editing Sub-section is LIN Ta- kuang,  and WEI Lin
 heads the Announcers Sub-section.
 2-SECOND BROADCASTING DEPARTMENT
 This department, of which CHANG Chi-ming is the head, prepares
 and transmits the programs and news directed toward Asian targets.  It
 has five sections and four sub-sections, which are the same as the sub-
 sections described under the First Broadcasting Department, above.                             The
 sections are:     Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Burma-Thailand, Laos-Cambodia,
 and Vietnam.      These sections are staffed by Chinese repatriates from these
 areas and some nationals of these countries residing in Peking.  Most of

 Approved For Relea                    P78-02646R000100090001-7
 the material used on broadcasts to these areas originate in the Central
 Editorial Department, although some programs are prepared by the de-
 partment's own staff.  Daily policy meetings and briefings are held at
 which the heads of the sections and sub-sections meet with the members
 of the Editorial Committee of the Foreign Broadcasting Division and re-
 ceive the party and government instructions as to the official line based
 on current developments.  Particularly close attention is given to the
 operations and activities of this department by the Party's Propaganda
 Department, the Foreign Ministry and the Commission of Overseas
 Chinese Affairs.  Leading Party members who are specialists in each of
 the areas act as advisors.
 The Korean Section directs its attention to South Korea, and many
 of the news items and propaganda statements are picked up and used by
 the North Korean station in Pyongyang, in addition to the NCNA newscasts.
 The Japanese Section, of which FANG Hisuan was the head, also
 handled the programs which were broadcast over the Radio Free Japan
 facilities in China from 1952 to 1955.  This section is the most important of
 the five sections and has the largest staff.  There are five sub-sections
 of the Japanese Section as follows:  Editing, News Translation, Informa-
 tion Editing and Translation, Announcers, and Letters/Correspondence.
 Nationals of the several country sections employed at Radio Peking were

 reported to be mostly members of their respective Communist parties.
 In the Japanese Section these were mostly persons who were stranded in
 China at the end of World War II.  Those used as announcers on the
 former Radio Free Japan could not be used for the Radio Peking Jap-
 anese broadcasts, otherwise they would reveal the fact that Radio Free
 Japan operated from Peking.  These persons are reported to have been
 among the Japanese repatriated in 1957-58 and they were replaced by
 other JCP members who departed Japan for Peking via clandestine chan-
 nels.
 The Vietnamese Section,  headed by YEH Chi-tung was divided
 into two parts, one for South Vietnam, and one for North Vietnam.  Pro-
 grams in Malayan are also believed to be handled in the Second Broad-
 casting Department as well as broadcasts in the several Chinese dialects
 intended for the large audience of Chinese residing overseas in these
 areas (estimated at over 13, 000, 000).
 3-THIRD BROADCASTING DEPARTMENT
 The principal section of this department is the USSR Section.  All
 work in this section is said to be done in Russian and its personnel are
 reportedly to be mostly foreigners.   There may also be a section which
 prepares programs to be presented in other Sino-Soviet Bloc countries
 under the cultural exchange agreements.  Russian is not one of the
 major foreign languages used in Peking's foreign broadcasts, nor are

 programs broadcast in other languages of the Bloc on a regular basis.
 The major function of the USSR Section is believed to be the preparation
 of taped programs in Russian languages, which are sent to the USSR and
 broadcast over Soviet transmitters.  These taped programs are called
 "Govorit Pekin".
 Also under this department are sections which prepare and broad-
 cast programs in Spanish, Turkish, Indian, Portuguese, German, and
 possibly Pakistani and Italian.  YANG Lin-chang has been reported to be
 head of the Spanish Section.  Increasing emphasis has been placed by
 Radio Peking since 1957 in developing the Spanish programs to Central and
 South America, and the Portuguese programs beamed to Brazil and the
 Portuguese colonial areas in Africa.  It has been reported that several
 members of the Brazilian Communist Party were employed by the BAB in
 Peking, preparing the programs in Portuguese which began in April 1960.
 4-OVERSEAS CHINESE BROADCASTING DEPARTMENT
 This department directs its efforts 'toward voice broadcasts in
 the Chinese dialects (Mandarin,  Cantonese, Amoy, Hakka and Ch'achou).
 While intended to reach all Chinese residing overseas in Europe, the
 Near East and the Western Hemisphere, its programs and news broadcasts
 are targeted largely against the vast numbers throughout Southeast Asia,
 Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and the Philippines.  The CCP United Front

 Department, the Commission of Overseas Chinese Affairs, the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs and the CCP Propaganda Department are all involved
 in policy matters with regard to the activities of this department.
 As heretofore mentioned, the programs directed to Taiwan are
 administratively under the Domestic Broadcasting Division, but the policy
 and preparation of these broadcasts are under the supervision of the
 Central Editorial Committee of the BAB.  Whether there is a separate
 Taiwan Broadcasting Department (also preparing the Fukien Front pro-
 grams) or this is a task of the military or of one of the other departments
 under the Foreign Broadcasting Division, is not determined.
 C-INTERNATIONAL LIAISON DEPARTMENT
 This department works in close harmony with the CCP Central
 Committee's International Liaison Department (Foreign Section) and with
 the Foreign Ministry.  Apparently its primary mission is to arrange
 agreements for the exchange of program materials, tapes and manuscripts,
 with government and privately owned radio stations of other countries,
 principally those of the Sino-Soviet Bloc, but also including others such
 as those in Japan and Indonesia.  Although the personnel of this depart-
 ment are not known, it is interesting to note that HSIUNG Fu, Secretary
 General of the CCP Propaganda Department, has been identified in various
 broadcasts in a manner which would indicate that he is also engaged in the
 Approved For Release                  r-to-u2646ROO0100090001-7
 Approved For Release ?91J1MM1RV&T8-02646R00
 work of the CCP International Liaison Department.   This may mean that he
 directs the activities of this department under the BAB.
 Also under the BAB is a department, which, for want of a known
 title, will be called the Special Programs Department.  This unit is pro-
 bably directly under the Central Editorial Department, subject to Foreign
 Ministry supervision   In 1958, it began broadcasting daily programs in-
 tended for reception by Chinese Communist embassies and official in-
 stallations abroad.  Composed of special news and commentaries on Chinese
 Communist reaction to international affairs and situations, this material
 may form the nucleus of the bulletins published by some embassies for dis-
 tribution to selected government offices, publications, Overseas Chinese
 and others in the nations where Communist China has diplomatic installa-
 tions.
 It is probable that the International Liaison (Foreign) Department
 of the CCP Central Committee supervises the participation of representa-
 tives of the Chinese Communist broadcasting enterprise in the Interna-
 tional Broadcasting and Television Organization (OIRT), international Com-
 munist front, with headquarters in Prague,  Czechoslovakia.  WEN Chi-
 tse, director of the BAB Foreign Broadcasting Division, has been a vice
 president of the OIR since 1955, and there is believed to be at least one
 representative of Communist China on the OIR permanent secretariat in
 Prague.   It is also believed that some Chinese from BAB are assigned as

 Approved For Release                   78-02646R000100090001-7
 announcers on Chinese programs broadcast over Radio Moscow.
 D-FOREIGN RADIO MONITORING DIVISION
 This facility under the BAB, staffed by Party and Young Communist
 League members, monitors radio broadcasts on a world-wide basis.  As
 early as 1937 the Chinese Communists were monitoring news broadcasts
 by the Chinese Nationalist Central News Agency, Domei News Agency of
 Tokyo, the French Havas News Agency, and some over the TASS and Trans-
 ocean circuits.  Only limited information is available concerning this ser-
 vice, but in addition to monitoring these news broadcasts, they may be
 tape-recorded, and translated and transcribed where necessary.  The edit-
 ing staff of this division uses this monitored news in preparing bulletins
 covering the international news, issued every two hours.   These news
 briefs are printed in a limited quantity, classified "confidential", and
 distributed to a select group of Party and government leaders, particularly
 in the Central Party headquarters, the Foreign Ministry and New China
 News Agency.   The head of this monitoring facility is a former NCNA
 executive.
 Some visitors to Peking have expressed surprise at the amount of
 current information on world events that is at the fingertips of Chinese Com-
 munist Party and government leaders, and Peking Radio frequently reacts
 to happenings and foreign political actions within a few hours of their

 Approved For Releas                   P78-026468000100090001-7
 occurence.  It is probable that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and possi-
 bly the People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (PIFA), an adjunct of the
 Foreign Ministry, prepare daily political analyses which are given limited
 circulation among the Chinese Communist top echelon.  A former to of-
 ficial of one of the satellite political parties in Communist China stated that
 the PIFA, headed by CH'IAO Kuan-hua, assistant to the Foreign Minister,
 translated foreign publications and prepared a daily international affairs
 digest which was circulated only to high officials in the party and govern-
 ment concerned with foreign affairs and foreign policy.                  The New China
 News Agency issued two daily restricted publications for circulation to de-
 partment heads and above.  One of these, Reference Data was a large
 volume containing news dispatches from news services such as AP, UP,
 Reuters, Agence France Presse,  and others.  For those who did not have
 time to read this volumnous publication, NCNA also put out Reference News,
 which covers only the high points of the day's news.  Both of these publi-
 cations carried only straight news, as much as two days old, and without
 any comment.  Recipients had to sign for copies they received and were
 not permitted to pass them to unauthorized persons.
 Walter A. Cole,  editor of Reuters, who spent 12 days in Communist
 China in January 1958, was probably referring to a combination of these
 four types of summaries and analyses when he wrote as follows in an arti-
 cle in the N. Y. Times 28 February 1958:

 "Superficially, it might seem that the Chinese Com-
 munist leaders must be in a vacuum regarding the day-to-
 day occurrences in the outside world.  These occurrences
 have little or no place in the Chinese press or on the radio.
 But by means of intelligently compiled news digests, based
 in the main on the monitoring of all available radio and news
 sources, and by scrutinizing the world's daily and period-
 ical press, they are among the best informed individuals on
 current affairs that I have met.   The world outside,  as seen
 through these digests, cannot appear other than topsy-turvy
 when compared with the accounts in the Chinese press of
 the always-correct and 'unified' Communist bloc. "
 It must also be presumed that press dispatches filed from Peking
 by correspondents for Reuters, Agence France Presse, the Toronto Globe
 & Mail, ANTARA of Indonesia, and those representing the Yugoslav press
 service, which are transmitted via commercial radio facilities, are copied
 and made available to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so that this Ministry
 may monitor the dispatches as to content, can obtain the reaction of
 foreigners to condition and occurences in Communist China, and can deter-
 mine any reaction or reply that might be called for under particular cir-
 cum stances.

 E-JAMMING OF FOREIGN BROADCASTS
 Little is known of the Chinese Communist facilities for or capabil-
 ities in jamming of foreign broadcasts beamed to the China mainland.          It
 is known that they are equipped to and do interfere with the broadcasts of
 Voice of America and those from Japan and Taiwan.  One Western visitor,
 who was on the China mainland in early 1960, reported that in listening to
 foreign broadcasts he noted that the BBC and VOA English language broad-
 casts apparently were not affected by jamming, but did note that programs
 in Chinese emanating from three foreign stations were jammed.  The re-
 sponsibility for the technical aspects of this operation probably fall under
 the Radio Wave Control Bureau of the BAB Technical Staff.
