 INDOCHINA
 A 13 December NHAN DAN editorial scored President Thieu's
 National Assembly speech of the 12th and discounted optimism
 about the progress of the private DRV-U.S. talks. The
 editorial accused Saigon and Washington of "scheming to
 abolish the fundamental principles" of the accord and called
 upon the United States to choose between signing the agreement
 and using Thieu to "sabotage" it.  Vietnamese communist
 propaganda earlier in the week had avoided any discussion of
 the substance of the negotiations while continuing to censure
 the United States for dragging its feet.
 An editorial in the November issue of the DRV party's theoretical
 journal HOC TAP, broadcast by Hanoi on 10 December, repeated
 the stock call for the United States to sign the agreement while
 underscoring communist resolve to continue the fight as long as
 necessary.  The November HOC TAP also carried an article
 defending the legitimacy of making agreements with enemies thus
 providing theoretical guidance for party member who had been
 warned in NHAN DAN editorials in August of the dangers of
 compromise with "imperialism."
 Soviet support for Vietnam was reaffirmed with the 9 December
 announcement of the conclusion of the annual Soviet-DRV aid
 agreement, signed by Politburo member and Vice Premier Le Thanh
 Nghi in Moscow.  Routine Moscow comment continues to give
 pro fr,:,ba support to the Vietnamese communists on the issue of
 the draft peace agreement and remains circumspect in criticizing
 the United States.
 lanoi announced Le Thanh Nghi's arrival in Paris on 10 December
 to head the North Vietnamese delegation to the French Communist
 Party Congress.  Hanoi has sent delegations at this level to
 previous CPF  congresses; Le Duc Tho led the Hanoi contingent to
 the last congress in February 1970.
 HANOI SCORES THIEU SPEECH. CALLS FOR SIGNING OF AGREEMENT
 The 13 December NHAN DAN editorial, broadcast by Hanoi to botL
 foreign and domestic audiences, dismissed President.Thieu's
 12 December speech to the National Assembly as further evidence
 that the allies are attempting to "abolish the fundamental
 principles" of the draft peace agreement.  In line with this charge,
 the editorial seemed to be trying to counter Western press

 13 DECEMBER 1972
 speculation about progress in the private Paris sessions when
 it opened its attack with the observation that the United
 States "repeatedly tries to make believe peace is around the
 corner."  The editorial scored, as a contrast to such
 optimistic words, stepped-up U.S. military assistance to
 Saigon and the alleged intensification of the war and
 repressive activities in the South--actions which it said
 indicate Washington's intention to sabotage the provisions of
 the agreement.  "The present state of the negotiations between
 Vietnam and the United States," according to the editorial,
 can be assessed by "Judging the concrete actions of the United
 States and puppets in South Vietnam and the U.S.-inspired
 arguments of the Thieu clique."
 The NHAN DAN editorial focused on the question of the rival
 administrations in the South, defending the PRG's position and
 bitterly denouncing the Saigon government as "a creature of U.S.
 neo-colonialism"; it complained that "the sheer existence of
 this dirty administration" is a violation of the South
 Vietnamese people's right to self determination.  Laying stress
 on the communist concession in the accord allowing Thieu's
 government to continue, the editorial maintained that the South
 Vietnamese people and the PRG are "fully entitleed" to raise the
 "legitimate demand" that "this stooge administration" be "abolished
 now."  It added that the PRG's recognition of the Saigon regime
 as one of the three political forces in South Vietnam has
 demonstrated the PRG's "realistic views and its good will in the
 correct settlement of the South Vietnam problem."
 NHAN DAN declared that the United States must choose either to
 abide by and sign the agreement or to continue to use Thieu
 to "sabotage" it.  Warning that "nobody can threaten or fool
 the Vietnamese people" and reiterating Vietnamese determination
 to fight on, the editorial went further than other Hanoi comment
 since the end of October in suggesting that the DRV would
 receive increased assistance for such a fight.  It asserted that
 "the more the U.S. aggressors are perfidious and stubborn, the
 bigger will be the support and assistance of the fraternal
 socialist countries" and others.
 Portions of Thieu's 12 December speech were acknowledged in the
 NHAN DAN editorial when it censured him for praising U.S.
 troops, for urging that a clear distinction bit made between
 North and South Vietnam, and for Advocating the withdrawal of
 North Vietnamese troops "nd the prevention of North Vietnamese
 interference in the South's internal affairs.  The editorial

 did not respond to the proposals in President Thieu's speech
 involving an extended holiday cease-fire and exchange of POW's,
 but an allusion to these suggestions appeared in a QUAN DOI
 NHAN DAN article on the 13th.  The article charged that "even
 though Thieu did speak of a truce, a temporary cease-fire, and
 POW release in his speech, he couli by no means cover up his
 real aim of sabotaging the agreement, intensifying the war,
 and serving his U.S. masters in continuing Vietnamization in
 new forms and realizing their coloni,sli&t dream."
 DRV JOURNAL EXPLAINS LEGITIMACY OF AGREEMENTS WITH ENEMIES
 The November issue of the Vietnamese Workers Party (VWP)
 theoretical journal HOC TAP, as would be expected, reprinted
 the DRV Government's 26 October statement on the draft peace
 agreement along with an editorial routinely scoring.the United
 States for not signing the accord and reaffirming determination
 to fight on as long as necessary.  Broadcast by Hanoi in
 Vietnamese to South Vietnam on 10 December, the editorial
 echoed earlier propaganda in attributing U.S. agreement on the
 ai:cord to allied "defeats" in Vietnam and in charging that
 U.S. refusal to sign reflects Washington's adherence to its
 "evil plan" to make the South a neocolony.
 The same issue of HOC TAP contained an article by alternate
 member of the VWP Central Committee Nguyen Khanh Toan* which
 did not mention the peace agreement but explained at length
 why agreements with an enemy must sometimes be reached-
 Pointing out that the form of struggle must be altered according
 to circumstances and that imperialism cannot be destroyed in a
 single battle but only "step by step," Toan explained:
 Sometimes we must accept a certain agreement
 (thoa hiep) with the enemy which must be
 essentially based on a revolutionary stand,
 that is, aimed at weakening his forces and
 *  Nguyen Khanh Toan is the chairman of the Vietnam Social
 Science Commission, chairman of the Central Commission for
 Teenagers and Children, and vice president of the Vietnam-Soviet
 Friendship Association.  He has contributed numerous articles
 to HOC TAP in the past several years.

 increasing our forces.  Such an agreement is a
 principled one, and It is basically different
 from the unprincipled agreement of opportunism.
 Toan's argument stands in sharp contrast to the line taken
 in NHAN DAN editorials on 17 and 19 August stressing the
 unacceptability of compromise and warning against the effect
 of the Nixon Administration's dealings with.the major
 communist powers.*  Where NHAN DAN expressed acute concern
 that support for Hanoi was being jeopardized by big-power
 relations, the HOC TAP article seems designed to justify a
 compromise Vietnam settlement in the broader interests of
 the international communist movement--in effect making a
 virtue of what had been so sharply deplored last August.
 The contrast between the two lines can be seen in their varying
 treatment of the relation between national and international
 interests in assessing the acceptability of compromise.  The
 17 August NHAN DAN, hinting that Hanoi was under severe pressure
 from its big allies to accept a cease-fire, had argued that it
 may be acceptable to make some accommodation but that "if out
 of the narrow interests of one's nation one tries to help the
 most reactionary forces avert the dangerous blows, that is
 a cruel reconciliation beneficial to the enemy and not
 beneficial to the revolution."  On the other hand, the HOC TAP
 article argued that when it is necessary to reach an agreement,
 communists do not allow "narrow and immediate interests" to
 blur the awareness of "lasting interests" of the entire
 movement and "do not allow national selfishness to control
 and undermine the common interests of the world revolution."
 Toan did echo the August NHAN DAN editorials when he indicated
 at another point that the international revolutionary struggle
 against imperialism must be conducted without compromise, but
 he went on to note that certain situations allowed for
 "flexibility."  His discussion of this point bears striking
 resemblance to Le Duan's discourse on revolutionary methods
 in his lenghty February 1970 article.  Le Duan had similarly
 advocated pushing back the enemy step by step and had explained
 that
 knowing how to win step by step--a manifestation
 of a combination of insistence on ultiuate goals

 and clear-sightedness in viewing concrete movements--
 is an art of dialectic combination of faithfulness
 to principle with flexibility in policies . . . .
 In the saLne article, Le Duan had recalled the Vietnamese
 communist tactic during the 1945-46 period of alternately
 making "temporary compromises" with the Chinese Nati'nalist
 forces and the French in order to divide enemy ranks.  These
 measures were evaluated by Le Duan as "models of Leninist
 strategy on the exploitation of enemy contradictions and on
 principled concessions."
 While presenting a case for compromise settlements, Toan at
 the same time underlined Vietnamese independence and determination
 when he declared that "only our people, the master of their
 country and civilization, deeply cherish them and stand ready
 to sacrifice everything to protect them."  He added that the
 Vietnamese people, "when their independence and freedom are at
 stake, never wait for outsiders to come and liberate them."

 MOSCOW SIGNS AiD ACCORDS WITH DRV. MARKS TIME ON SETTLEMENT
 The Soviets gave a standard reception to the DRV Government's
 economic delegation headed by Le Thanh Nghi, which arrived in
 Moscow on 27 November and departed on 10 December after Nghi
 and Soviet Vice Premier Novikov signed the agreements on
 economic and "defense" aid for 1973.  Kosygin received the group
 on 2 December in line with standard protocol; either he or
 Brezhnev or both have customarily received these delegations.
 Moscow, which had supplied no details of the aid provided for
 in the agreements in recent years, this time catalogued some
 economic reconstruction aid.  Soviet media did not report a
 specific reference to military aid by Novikov which appeared in
 Hanoi's much feller accounts of the speeches by the two vice
 premiers at the signing ceremony.*
 CONTENT OF ACCORDS     TASS reported that the agreements signed
 on 9 December covered "aid without
 compensation" and trade, noting that the aid will include "large
 consignments of goods, equipment, and other property" and
 "necessary assistance" in strengthening the DRV's "defense
 potential."  Neither TASS nor VNA expanded on the nature of the
 defense aid.  But in Soviet media's first elaboration on the
 nature of the economic aid covered in the aid agreements since
 1969, a Moscow rauio report noted that the USSR in 1973 will
 supply equipment "to build tunnels and restore bridges and
 roads" and will export "industrial equipment, machines, oil
 products, consumer goods, and foodstuffs."
 Announcements in Soviet media in September 1967, November 1968,
 and October 1969 had listed some of the types of materiel,
 including military, to be given the DRV as aid.  And in the
 past two years, when Moscow's reports provided no detail,
 Hanoi's had specified some of the materials to be provided by
 Moscow or exchanged in trade.  This time VNA offered no specifics
 in reporting, in standard language, that the agreements covered
 "Soviet non-refund economic and military aid for 1973" and that
 they also provided for "long-term loans" and trade.  But Hanoi's
 *  Kosygin did not, however, attend the signing ceremonies, as he
 had done when agreements were signed at th~? vice premier level in
 1967 and 1970.  There was a precedent for his absence from the
 ceremonies in 1968.  He signed the agreements himself as Phaii Van
 Dong's counterpart in 1969, when the DRV premier headed the
 delegation that negotiated them.  Last year's agreements were signed
 in Hanot during Podgornyy's visit.

 substantial accounts of the speeches by Novikov and Le Thanh
 Nghi quoted the former as mentioning "armaments and military
 equipment" and the latter as stating that Soviet aid "in the
 present urgent situation" would "strengthen the elan and
 confidence" of the Vietnamese armed forces and people.
 Both Moscow's and Hanoi's reports announced the signing of an
 agreement an establishment of a "standing intergovernmental
 Soviet-Vietnamese Commission for Economic and Scientific-
 Technical Cooperation."  This apparently :represents the culmina-
 tion of an agreement reached during Podgornyy's DRV.visit in
 October of last year:  The 7 October 1971 joint communique
 noted that the two sides had agreed to entrust the appropriate
 organizations and services with the task of working out "long-
 term development of economic cooperation and trade, cultural,
 scientific, technical, and other relations."  The communique
 expressed confidence that the setting up of the joint commission
 would contribute to the strengthening of Soviet-l::.; economic
 relations.
 Novikov and Le Thanh Nghi both lauded the "unshakeable solidarity
 and fra ;vernal friendship" of the two parties, and Hanoi's
 accounts quoted Le Thanh Nghi as referring briefly to Chinese
 aid--just as he had acknowledged Soviet assistance in a banquet
 speech while in Peking to sign the PRC-DRV a1d agreement last
 month.  Moscow, while giving the speeches brief and scant
 publicity, seemed defensive in insisting in a foreign-language
 radio commentary on the constancy of Soviet support for the
 Vietnamese.  Broadcast to the Vietnamese among other audiences
 on 10 December, the commentary emphasized Soviet adherence to
 the "principles of proletarian internationalism elaborated by
 Lenin" and underscored Moscow's view of its aid to peoples
 fighting imperialist aggression as a "duty."  The broadcast
 called the new aid accords "eloquent proof" that there is no
 discrepancy between the Soviet Union's words and deeds and
 evidence that Moscow invariably and steadfastly carries out its
 "international duty of proletarian solidarity."
 POLITICAL SETTLEMENT     Moscow has continued to give the
 Vietnamese communists pro forma support
 on the issue of the draft peace agreement and has sustained its
 circumspect treatment of the United States.  According.to VNA's
 account of the speeches at the ceremonies for signing the aid
 accords, Novikov did not mention the peace agreement in
 expressing full support for DRV efforts to "end the war and

 restore peace in Vietnam" and to "reach a correct solution
 conforming to the national aspiration of the Vietnamese people."
 TASS briefly reported these remark,, but it did not report
 Le Thanh Nghi's attack on "thA obdurate double-faced and
 bellicose attitude of  he Nixon Administration."  Speaking at
 a 6 December dinner for the visiting Chilean president, however,
 Podgornyy again reiterated the Soviet call for a "speedy" U.S.
 signing of the peace agreement, and low-level comment--including
 statements by numerous Soviet mass organizations--have echoed
 the demand.
 Moscaw has given scant attention to the 3 December.PRG statement
 which accused the Thieu government of a "campaign of terror"
 and crimes against "patriotic" forces being detained in the
 South.  TASS barely acknowledged the content of the statement
 when it reported that PRG envoys in Hanoi and Moelcow held press
 conferences on 4 and 7 December, respectively, to publicize
 the statement.  Similarly, TASS only briefly. summarized a
 7 December DRV Government statement supporting the PRG statement.
 Consistent with Moscow's reluctance to criticize the.United
 States, the TASS summary omitted the DRV's charge that Saigon's
 terrorist actions were "on U.S. orders," as well as the DRV's
 appeal to socialist countries to "severely condemn the U.S.
 aggressors."  Some routine Soviet press and radio commer.c did
 echo the line in the DRV an. PRG statements, but without
 specifically citing them.
 DRY CONTINUES TO PROTEST ATTACKS ON NORTH. URGES VIGILANCE
 U.S. strikes against North Vietnam continued to draw sta?,uiaro
 protests in daily statements issued by the DRV Foreign Ministry
 spokesman, which sustained the charge that.these "crimes"
 reveal the Nixon Administration's desire to prolong the war
 despite its declarations that peace is "at hand."  The
 statement of the 11th atypically included among such "crimes"
 the direct charge that the United States is continuing to mine
 and blockade various harbors and to drop magnetic bombs over
 rivers.  The last such direct charge of that kind, as distinct
 from the standard demand in the spokesman's statement,, that
 the United States cease its mining and blockade of DRV ports,
 had appeared in a communique of the DRV War Crimes.Commission,
 reported by VNA on 4 December, which listed several major
 waterways that had been mined.  Hanoi reported the downing of
 five more planes during the past week, including a pilotless

 plane over Nam Ha on 11 December, for a total of 4,075 as
 of that day; it also said two more U.S. warships had been set
 afire.
 Intensification of U.S. strikes against the civilian
 population of Nghe An Province was alleged by VNA on 9 December
 in a report on the visit of several foreign newsmen to that
 province between 29 November and 8 December.  Claiming that
 the Journalists viewed the effects of both B-52 saturation
 bombing and the combination of "tactical air raids and naval
 bombardments," VNA said eyewitnesses told them the intensity
 of such raids had increased "markedly" since 26 October.
 Nghe An's exploits in the face of U.S. bombing were praised
 in a NHAN DAN editorial of the 6th, which acclaimed the province's
 achievements in agriculture as well as its military feats during
 "the present destructive war."  Noting that the people of Nghe
 An had attained successes in agricultural production despite
 natural hardships and the intensified bombing, NHAN DAN granted
 that favorable weather conditions may have helped but stressed
 that the chief fa,-,tor was correct leadership, which led in turn
 to improvements in technology, management, and organization.
 Successes in both combat and production tasks were also claimed
 for the provinces of the Fourth Military Region as a whole, in
 an 11 December Hanoi radio report on A recent joint conference
 of the standing committee of the party committee of the region,
 the regional command, and the standing committees of the party
 committees of each of the provinces in the region and the Vinh
 Linh zone.  According to the report, the conference set forth
 a number of local and general military tasks including downing
 aircraft, maintaining communications and transportation, stepping
 up passive air defense, aiding the frontline, increasing vigilance,
 and "making necessary Preparations for organizing forces and
 technical and tactical training in order to defeat every war
 adventure by Nixon, [and] aiding the battlefield with men and
 material under the slogan 'rice and men exceed requirements."'
 AIR DEFENSE      In an apparent effort to sustain civilian concern
 MEASURES          with air defense tasks during a period of
 relative calm in the northern part of the country,
 Hanoi radio has broadcast several items calling for improvement of
 "passive air defense" measures in areas north of the 20th parallel
 and thus currently beyond the range of U.S. strikes.. Typically,
 an English-language broadcast on 7 December reported the "practical

 deeds" being implemented:  continued evacuation of Hanoi;
 improvement of the militia, antiaircraft forces, missile units,
 and "the air force and related services"; and continued
 enlistment of youths in the armed forces.  Other broadcasts
 reported similar activities underway in Haiphong, in the
 province of Ha Bac (northeast of Hanoi), and in the Vinh Linh
 zone.
 The importance of civilian defense measures was highlighted in
 statements made by DRV President Ton Duc Thang during a visit
 to a primary school on the outskirts of Hanoi, reported by
 Hanoi radio on the 8th and by VNA on the 9th.  Declaring that
 children are "the future masters of the heroic Vietnamese
 nation," Thang urged continued vigilance and performance of
 passive air defense tasks as a means of insuring the safety
 and security of teachers and students.  In other brief reports,
 air force, naval, and antiaircraft forces in Hanoi and several
 northern provinces were reported to be intensifying and
 improving training and combat procedures.  And QUAN DOI NHAN DAN,
 in an editorial on the 8th, urged youths in tr.: army to improve
 their scientific and technical knowledge and skills so as to
 better defeat the enemy.
 The 7 December English-language broadcast presented the current
 stress on air defense and related activities in areas north
 of the 20th parallel as a response to "the United States'
 deliberate delay in the signing of the Vietnam peace agreement and
 its step-up of the war in both parts of Viet.nam."  Charges of
 intensification of the bombing both of South Vietnam and of areas
 of the DRV south of the 20th parallel have been leveled in both
 of the recent War Crimes Commission communiques, as well as in
 the 2 December foreign ministry statement that was issued
 specifically to condemn such actions.  The foreign ministry
 statement, in addition, charged that the intensification is
 directly related to the U.S. delay in signing the peace agreement
 and declared that the only course for the Vietnamese people is to
 continue to maintain vigilance, to combine combat and
 production, and to continue the struggle to defeat the U.S.
 "aggressors."

 PATHET LAO PRESENTS DRAFT PEACE AGREEMENT AT VIENTIANE TALKS
 A draft peace agreement presented by the NLHS on 12 December
 in Vientiane, at the ninth session of the peace talks with the
 RLG, appears to bring the NLHS' stand encompassed in its
 17 October peace proposal* into line with the draft U.S.-DRV
 agreement on Vietnam summarized by Hanoi on 26 October.  The U.S.-
 DRV draft agreement on Vietnam includes a call for the
 withdrawal of "all countries" from Laos and Cambodia in order
 to let the peoples of those countries settle their own affairs;
 the NLHS draft agreement provides for the withdrawal of
 "foreign troops" from Lpos, rather than specifying U.S. troops
 as in the October proposal, thereby introducing a formula
 that could be interpreted to include DRV forces.  It also
 spells out a timetable for steps proposed in October on a
 cease-fire, troop withdrawal, and formation of a provisional
 coalition government.
 The draft agreement was presented following the return of NLHS
 delegation head Phoune Sipraseuth to Vientiane after consulta-
 tions with NLHS leaders in Sam Neus and stopovers in Hai  L.
 He had left Vientiane for Sam Neua on 2 December and returned
 on the 10th, stopping off in Hanoi both times.  NLHS Secretary
 General Phoumi Vongvichit, who had been in Vientiane as
 "special adviser" to the Pathet Lao delegation, had stopped
 off in Hanoi en rout, oack to Sam Neua on 11 November; he has
 not returned to the talks.
 A prompt, favorable report on the NLHS draft by the Vientiane
 radio on the 12th said it was viewed by  he RLG side as a
 possible "first step toward further agreements in coming
 sessions" and noted that the RLG delegate to the talks had
 delivered a speech expressing "satisfaction with the new
 attitude of the NLHS delegation,"
 CEASE-FIRE & WITHDRAWAL     In the text carried in Pathet Lao
 media on the 13th, the NLHS draft
 agreement repeats the October proposal's demand that the
 United States stop the bombing and other military activity in
 *  The five-point proposal of 17 October was presented by the
 NLHS at the opening session of the Vientiane talks.  For a
 discussion see the TRENDS of 26 October 1972, pages 11-16.

 Laos, dismantle its bases, and take responsibility for war
 damages.  But it neither refers specifically to a U.S. troop
 withdrawal nor mentions Thai forces.  Its timetable calls for
 implementation of "a cease-fire on the spot throughout Lao
 territory" and stipulates that "all advisers, military
 personnel, and regular and irregular troops of foreign countties
 must be withdrawn from Laos" within 90 days of the signing
 of the agreer c: `.
 Like the 17 October proposal, the draft calls for proscription
 of the entry into Laos of troops or weapons of "arty foreign
 country."  Echoing language in Hanoi's summary of the DRV
 draft agreement on Vietnam, it rotates that replacement of
 damaged weapons and materials will be permitted with the
 concurrence of both sides and at the request of the "coalition
 government," which would also handle their distribution.  It
 stipulates that prisoners, "regardless of nationality," will
 be exchanged after the cease-fire simultaneously with the
 withdrawal of "foreign" troops, where the 17 October NLHS
 proposal had specified withdrawal of U.S. and allied military
 personnel.  As in the October proposal, the draft agreement
 provides for supervision of the cease-fire by a joint committee
 assisted tiv the ICC.
 COALITION GOVERNMENT     The NLHS draft states that the
 "political coalition council" and "new
 provisional coalition government," to be formed within 30 days
 of the signing, would be charged with implementing the agreement,
 holding further discussions, and administering the country
 pending elections for "the National Assembly and the National
 Coalition Government."  Both the council and the provisional
 government are envisaged as tripartite, composed in equal
 proportions of representatives of the RLG, theNLHS, and the
 Patriotic Neutralist Forces plus others of neutralist
 persuasion.
 The 17 October program had described the provisional government
 in similar terms, but it is not clear if the "political
 coalition council" proposed in the draft agreement is.the same
 as the "politicat consultative council" called for in the
 17 October program.  The make-up of the council was not spelled
 out in the October proposal beyond the statement that.it would
 consist of "components largely representative-of all parties
 concerned," including all nationalities, religions, social
 strata, patriotic personalities, and intellectuals.  Neither

 the draft agreement nor the October program spells out the
 division of power in the permanent "National Coalition
 Government."
 The draft agreement says that pending installation of the
 National Assembly and National Coalition Government, each
 side would continue to admin4.eter its own territory and
 Vientiane would be made a neutral zone.  The October proposal
 had merely provided that the parties concerned would "agree
 upon measures to insure security of the premises" of the
 coalition government and the council.

 SALT
 H NVGARIAN NEWSMAN CITES MOSCOW VIEWS ON SALT, MBFR, BASES
 A Hungarian Journalist recently returned from Moscow has cited
 Soviet "American exports" there as indicating that Moscow views
 negotiations on force reductions in Europe as a "supplement" to
 SALT 11,  Istvan Normandy--a military specialist who has in the
 past served as a proxy spokesman for Moscow on Sino-Sovist and
 nuclear issues*--indicated in an article in the 10 December issue
 of the political weekly MAGYARORSZAG that the issue linking SALT
 and force reductions is that of U.S. forward based systems in Europe
 (FBS).  Moscow may see in the multilateral talks on force reduction
 a possib'i vehicle for solving the thorny problem of coping with
 European PBS in the context of bilateral U.S.-Soviet talks on
 longer-range strategic weapons.  The first Soviet comment on
 substantive issues in SALT II, in IZVESTIYA on 5 and 7 December,
 singled out PBS as a problem for the current round just as it
 was for SALT I.  At the same time, Kormendy's discussio. suggests
 some Soviet flexibility on the issue of "balance" in any future
 European force reductions.
 SALT AND MBFR    Normandy emphasized the complexity and inter-
 dependence of the force :eduction talks--"the
 preparations for which will begin on 31 January"--and SALT II,
 foreseeing prolonged negotiations extending over several years
 and "covering the full range from strategic nuclear weapons to
 the troops  stationed in central Europe,"  (Moscow has not yet
 officially responded to the NATO propobQl of 16 November that
 initial talks begin at the end of January.)  The linkage may
 also signal a recognition by Moscow that an eventual accord on
 force reduction could require--as in the SALT I agreements--some
 degree of "asymmetry" in the reductions by each side.  Moscow
 has in the past taken strong issue with Western scenarios for
 mutual and balanced force reductions (MBFR) which have concluded
 that considerations of geographical proximity would require
 proportionately greater reductions of Soviet troops in East
 Europe.
 *  In a 25 July 1971 article in the same journal, Kormendy cited
 Soviet "Chinese experts" on Moscow's assessment of the Chinese
 nuclear capability and Sino-Soviet relations in general.

 ?            Kormendy, stating that "reciprocal reduction methods" (the
 formula used in the joint communique issued at the May U.S.-
 Soviet summit) -can be worked out, asserted that the result would
 be a military balance based on the principle of "equal security."
 Moscow has in the past emphasized that this principle--in its
 view central to the successful SALT I outcome--requires that
 simple numerical force correlations be balanced by other mitigating
 factors such as geography.  In the context of SALT, the 5 December
 IZVESTIYA article, an international review by A. Bovin,
 took issue with the outward simplicity of the Jackson amendment
 ("100 missiles for you and the same for us")  and argued that
 the equal security "principle requires that quantitative
 correlations be weighted with other factors--geographical
 location, the existence of forward based systems and so forth--
 which materially influence the degree of security."
 The Kormendy article did not mention the "parity principle,"
 which the last extended Soviet comment on MBFR said must
 characterize European force reductions.  That article, by
 Yuriy Koetko in the September 1972 issue of MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA
 I MEZHDUNARODNA'A0TNOSHENIYA, had defined parity as the maintenance
 at a lower level of the same general balance which had already
 taken shape.*
 FORWARD BASES    An article in the 7 December IZVESTIYA by
 M. Sagatelyan--the only full-length commentary
 on SALT II to appear in the central press to date--ci.ted an
 article in the GUARDIAN to emphasize that the current talks
 are confronted by the "same old problem:"  the United States
 would like to classify its weapons on European bases and
 Mediterranean warships as more tactical than strategic, whereas
 "the Russians regard missiles capable of hitting their territory
 as strategic and, consequently, a subject for discussion at
 the talks."  Bovin's 5 December IZVESTIYA article also cited
 FBS as important in SALT II.  Moscow continues to ignore the
 MIRV problem in comment relating to SALT II, though the East
 European press has given MIRV equal status with FLS as issues to
 be discussed thare.**

 U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS     In an unusual assessment in bloc media
 of the "political atmosphere in Moscow,"
 Kormendy also reported a new sense of calm prevailing there:  "the
 tons of political discussions has changed in Moscow since the spring."
 He found a belief among Soviet "American experts" that the U.S.
 interest in arms limitations is serious and of a long-term nature.
 "The U.S. inclination to negotiate and come to terms is not
 merely a current policy but a political trend developed on
 the basis of realities in Washington,"  Kormendy said.  He
 concluded that "not even the previously skeptical military
 experts"--apparently but not explicitly referring to those in
 Moscow--doubt any longer that SALT II will eventually produce
 further results.

 CHILE - USSR
 C"UNIQUE ON ALLENDE VISIT IMPLIES LIMITED SOVIET W+II1MENT
 The relatively bland communique issued at the conclusion of Chilean
 President Salvador Allende's 6-' December visit to the Soviet Union
 was notable for its failure to indicate any major new Soviet poli-
 tical or economic commitment to Chile.  Moscow's expression of "under-
 standing"--but not support--of Allende's efforts to "carry out social and
 economic reforms, strengthen the country's economy, its national
 sovereignty and independence, and build socialism" was noteworthy for the
 recognition of a Chilean effort to build socialism* but was weaker
 as a statement of Soviet backing than formulations used following
 previous visits of Chilean leaders to Moscow.  For example, the
 statraaent issued last June following the talks in Moscow between
 Chilean Socialist Party Secretary General Carlos Altamirano and
 Brezhnev and other ranking Soviet officials said the Soviet leaders
 "expressed complete support for the revolutionary changes"
 effected -by the Allende government
 The communique failed to characterize the tone of Allende's talks with
 Brezhnev and other Soviet leaders, although routine-level reports on
 the progress of the talks in Moscow media had said they took place
 "in an atmosphere of friendship and a complete identity of views
 and positions on all questions discussed." Moscow's evident
 caution in embracing the Allende regime would appear to stem
 from wariness about undertaking the kind of costly, open-ended commit-
 ment the USSR has made to Cuba as well as from a reluctance.to
 become too closely associated with a regime whose stability has been
 brought intc question by recurring domestic political and economic
 crises over the past year.
 VAGUE ECONOMIC PROMISES     The communique noted that the USSR
 "has been giving and is prepared to.give
 further politl.cal and a unomic support" to Chile and that both sides
 expressed a da,sire "to further deepen relations of friendship and
 improve mutua:~ly beneficial cooperation."  But in outlining. the
 "concrete measures" envisaged to implement these aims, it made no
 mention of the hard currency credits urgently needed by the.Chileans.
 ?             * Moscow has heretofore scrupulously avoided referring to "building
 socialism" in connection with Chile.  Typically, a 9 December Moscow
 radio talk on Allende's visit referred merely to Chilean workers
 embarking on "the construction of a new life" and to the Chilean
 people's "struggle for independence and progress."

 13 DECEMBER 1972
 Instead, it referred to the kinds of long-term aid for capital
 construction projects that Moscow has already been prcvidin6.
 The failure of the communique to mention any new Soviet hard
 currency credits is particularly noteworthy in light of the extension of
 such credits to Chile early this year.  Moscow has givo:: only negli-
 gible publicity to this credit, probably out of a desire to
 discourage further requests from Chile and  to avoid inviting similar
 requests from other currency-poor !eveloping nations.  A 24
 November Radio Moscow commentary on Soviet-Chilean cooperation,
 however, did acknowledge that the Soviet Union had granted
 Chile "a credit of nearly 100 million dollars for the purchase
 of foodstuffs."
 Reported statements by Chilean officials have been vague on the results
 of the Moscow talks.  AFP on the 8th reported a member of Allende's
 official party in Moscow as stating that the USSR had agreed
 to provide Chile with increased economic aid, but the report
 gave no details.  And an AFP dispatch from Paris on the 9th reported the
 President of the Chilean Central Bank, Alfonso Inostroza, as having
 denied a report that Allende sold 130,000 tons of copper to the
 USSR while in Moscow and as having stressed that Chile was
 interested in selling copper "in the traditional markets,
 especially Europe."  Inostraza was reported to have said that
 expansion of "certain exports" to the USSR and Soviet involve-
 ment in Chilean economic development could help "to create an
 infrastructure for exploiting our petroleum and coal."
 Reports on 12 December from PRENSA LATINA's Santiago correspondent
 to his Havana office and by the LATIN news agency quoted Chilean
 opposition spokesmen as being highly critical of Soviet credit
 offers to Allende.  Allende's opponents reportedly declared that the
 USSR is not helping Chile to solve its acute foreign exchange.
 shortage by providing hard currency needed for the purchase of
 food and spare parts; a leading Christian Democratic legislator
 was quoted as having observed disparagingly that "money is
 being loaned only for machinery sold to us by the USSR."
 INTERNATIONAL ISSUES     For the most part, the sections of t:ie
 Joint communique on international issues
 followed a predictable pattern: The document condemned the U.S.
 "blockade" of Cuba, applauded recent moves toward detente in
 Europe, supported the DRV any the PRG, and endorsed a world
 disarmament conference.

 One area where the communique conspicuously sought to blur Soviet-
 Chilean differences was on the rights of states to not limits
 on their territorial waters, which Chile actively supports--
 maintaining a 200-mile territorial sea limit--and the USSR opposes.*
 The communique, hintir.g at the continuing divergence of views,
 stated that "the two sides exchanged opinions concerning the
 forthcoming UN conference cau maritime law and expressed readiness
 to concert their positions and cooperate with each other in
 achieving the aims of the conference, with due account taken
 of the interests of all states."
 The communique predictably condemned "foreign interference" in
 Chilean internal affairs without specifying that either the
 U.S. Government or U.S. companies were the culprits.  In a veiled
 reference to the Kennecott Copper Company's recent attempts to
 embargo Chilean copper shipments to Western Europe, it denounced
 "foreign monopolies" for trying to deprive Chile of its right
 to use its natural resources as it sees fit, "specifically the
 right to sell its copper freely."
 ALLENDE'S STATEMENTS    Allende's remarks in Moscow conveyed
 strong hints to his Soviet hosts that
 Chile should be considered as deserving of Soviet generosity
 as is Vietnam.  Speaking at a 6 December Kremlin dinner in his
 honor, the Chilean leader effusively lauded Soviet aid to Vietnam
 and went on to cite the description of Chile by Pablo Neruda, Chilean
 Nobel Prize winning poet and communist party luminary, as "a silent
 Vietnam"--a country which, while not experiencing "the roar of
 aircraft and grenade explosions," shared the same feeling of an
 "overt and concealed encirclement of our country."
 Allende touched briefly on Chile's current difficulties, noting
 in the dinner speech that Chile was "implementing a revolutionary
 process.... within the framework of a bourgeois democracy, and it is
 *  Since 1970 the Chinese have supported those Latin American states
 claiming a 200-mile territorial sea limit and have used the issue
 in polemics against Moscow, lambasting "superpower" efforts to
 deprive smaller countries of their ocean resources.  Moscow
 has avoided publicizing the issue; Soviet, media did not carry
 remarks by USSR delegate Roshchin in the UNGA Political
 Committee on S November in which he cited as one of the USSR's
 objections to the Treaty on a Latin American Nuclear-Free Zone the fact
 that it permits states to set their own territorial sea limits.

 not easy."  Here and in other statements, he stressed that Chile
 was the victim of economic "aggression" by "imperialist mono-
 polies."  In an interview on Moscow Radio and TV, Allende

 THAILAND
 TNAM. CP ANNIVERSARY: THAI STRESS, CHINESE MUTE ARMED STRUGGLE
 Observances of the Thai Comuaunist Party's 30th anniversary on
 1 December have reflected both persisting elements and new
 directions in Southeast Asia, most notably the relaxation of
 Sino-U.S. tensions and moves toward new relationships in an
 area that has been dominated by the Indochina conflict and the
 specter of "people's war."  A statement issued by the Thai CP
 and echoed by the fraternal parties in the area elaborated a
 classical Maoist strategy of armed insurgency while reminding
 the Chinese that the Bangkok regime remains hostile to the
 common interests of the Asian communist movement.  The Thai
 communists' Peking mentor, however, chose to balance its patronage
 of loyal client parties with its brcaderinterests in Asian
 detente.  Thus, following its dual-track approach to Southeast
 Asia, Peking failed to publicize its greetings message to the
 Thai CP while leaving it to the PRC-baba3 clandestine "Voice of
 the People of Thailand" (VOPT) to broadcast the message.*  In
 revealing contrast, Hanoi issued not only a greetings message
 but also an editorial in the party organ stressing the link
 between the Vietnamese and Thai armed struggles against the
 United States and its local allies.
 Messages reflecting their mutual ideological affinities were
 sent to the Thai CP by the fraternal Burmese and Malayan parties
 and broadcast by their respective PRC-based radios.  From 6 to 12
 December the VOPT carried fraternal greetings in the following
 order (giving pride of place to th  CCP and other ruling parties)
 Chinese, North Vietnamese, Albanian, Korean, Romanian, Burmese,
 Malayan, and Philippine parties.
 THAI CP STATEMENT     T`+.e Thai party marked its anniversary with
 a major statement on 1 December by the
 party's central committee and a VOPT editorial on the 5th high-
 lighting the key points in the statement, particularly the
 necessity of armed struggle.  The etatewent was three times
 longer than the comparable pronouncement marking the party's 25th

 anniversary in 1967 and seemed to take a harder line concerning
 the attainment of political power in Thailand while adhering to
 longstanding positions on international questions.  Similar to
 the one on the 25th anniversary, this year's statement repeatedly
 excoriated the Bangkok government--"the traitorous Thanom clique"--
 and pledged to drive the United States out of Thailand by means
 of a strategy of armed struggle based on "Marxism-Leninism-
 Mao Tse-tung Thought."  The statement also praised China as a
 "strong bulwark and a reliable ally of all the world revolutionaries,"
 forcefully reaffirmed Thai CP support for the Indochina war effort,
 and assailed "Soviet social imperialism."
 In charting the road to power in Thailand, the statement reflected
 a shift in policy stemming from the party's 10-point policy
 statement of 1968.  Stressing that armed struggle to seize political
 power is the "only correct means," it omitted the line contained in
 the 25th anniversary statement expressing an interest in a coalition
 government.  The current statement elaborated a strategy of rural-
 based armed struggle aimed ultimately at encircling and seizing the
 cities.  It called for a broad united front from below of all
 persons and groups who oppose "U.S. Imperialism and the treacherous
 Thanom clique--our common enemy."  Though ritualistically
 characterizing the present situation in the armed struggle as
 "excellent," the statement reflected a sober awareness of
 complications presented by conditions inside and outside the
 country.  Thus, referring to the regime's suppression drives
 against the insurgents, the statement observed that "the enemy
 remains strong and our side is rather weak," and it acknowledged that
 the communists will be confronted with "an even more complicated,
 canning, and arduous struggle."  In a passage that could be read
 as objecting to Peking's dealings with the Bangkok government,
 the statement insisted that "the dictatorial and fascist Thanom
 clique" is pursuing a policy inimical to the revolutionary
 people in other countries, "including the Chinese people."
 CHINA     The Thai communists could hardly have been reassured
 by Peking's treatment of their anniversary.  Together
 with Peking's failure to publicize the greetings message, the
 content of the message itself reflected an evident effort to
 miniwiza the effect on the recently improved Peking-Bangkok
 relations of Peking's identification with the Thai insurgency.
 In contrast to the greetings on the Thai party's previous
 quinquennial anniversary, in 1967, the CCP message this year
 discreetly skirted sensitive issues posed by the continuing Thai
 insurgency.  The message used generalized language in praising

 the Thai party for making "a great contribution to the liberation
 struggle" in Thailand, and there was a minimal bow to the "militant
 solidarity" of the two parties.  Consistent with Peking's practice
 since the visit cf a Thai tab14 tennis team in September, the
 message sidestepped direct attacks on the Thai government,
 resorting rather to the less provocative formulation of "local
 reactionaries in Thailand."
 This year's message conspicuously avoided associating the Chinese
 with a strategy of people's war in Thailand.  There was no pledge
 of Chinese support for the Thai struggle, no mention of Mao
 thought as the ideological source of the Thai communist movement,
 and no discussion of armed struggle as the means to power.  Also
 absent was any linkage of the Thai at-uggle with the Indochina war,
 an issue that had figured prominently in Peking's treatment of the
 Thai insurgency since its inception in 1965 but has declined in
 importance as Peking has taken a more relaxed line on U.S. intentions
 in the area.
 In i.s own media Peking marked the Thai CP's anniversary only by
 carrying a 2 December NCNA account of a lengthy article broadcast
 by the VOPT on 30 November.  While duly citing passages in praise
 of the achievements of the Thai armed struggle since 1965, the
 NCNA account was measurably more sanitized than a similar NCNA
 replay marking the anniversary last year.  Most notably, there
 was no reference to the Thanom government and little emphasis on
 the role of armed struggle.  In fact, the NCNA account, with its
 statement that the Thai party had "no alternative but to take up
 arms in self-defense" against "external and internal enemies,"
 could be read as leaving open the possibility of a switch to
 peaceful political competition from the exclusive reliance on
 armed struggle insistently propounded in the Thai CP's pronouncements.
 OTHER PARTIES     While Peking has sought to minimize its involvement
 with the Thai insurgency, the North Vietnamese used
 their greetings message and a NHAN DAN editorial to portray the Thai
 armed struggle as an integral part of the broader struggle against
 the United States in Southeast Asia.  The message was replete with
 expressions of North Vietnamese solidarity with the Thai communists
 in a fight against "the same enemy--the U.S. imperialist aggressors."
 Like the message, the editorial underscored mutual assistance and
 support by the two parties and linked their interests by citing
 the Thai government's role in the Indochina conflict.

 The messages from the Burmese and Malayan CPs registered the
 ideological. affinities among the Maoist-lining parties in
 Southeast Asia--and in the process reflected the ideological
 lag increasingly separating these parties, with their invocation
 of a strategy enunciated by Lin Piao in his 1965 tract on
 people's war, and their Peking patron, now embarked on Chouist
 policies of accommodation and negotiation.  Both the Burmese
 and Malayan messages invoked Mao thought and the doctrine of
 people's war, denounced Soviet revisionism, and identified the
 "Thanom-Praphat clique" as the target of armed struggle.  The
 lengthy Burmese message particularly stressed the identity of
 interests between the Thai and Burmese communists, noting that
 "your struggles are our struggles and your victories are our
 victories."  The BCP assured its fraternal neighbors that
 "despite difficulties" it would persist in the fight against
 "the reactionary Ne Win-San Yu military government" in the
 belief that "armed struggle in Burma will assist your struggle,
 a'i the struggles in Thailand helped the revolution in Bursa."

 USSR INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 DEMOGRAPHER VIEWS FARM EFFICIENCY AS KEY TO URBANIZATION
 A polemical article by demographer Viktor Perevedentsev in the
 November NASH SOVREMENNIK (OUR CONTEMPORARY) argues for more, not
 less, migration from rural areas to cities and urges adoption of
 link-type farm labor organization to make up for the losses in
 farm manpower. Complaining that all recent writings have approached
 the subject of migration from the point of view of how to hold
 young people on farms, Perevedeatsev sets out to defend the interests
 of urban areas, arguing that the falling birth rate and increasing
 shortage of urban labor require mea..'.'es to stimulate migration to
 the cities.  Perevedentsev's article reflects a longtime debate not
 only between proponents of industry and agriculture but also between
 those advocating the reorganization of agriculture on the basis of
 material incentive and individual initiative ands those calling for
 greater agricultural investment within the framework of traditional
 institutions and practices.
 Perevedentsev indicates that despite the measures adopted since
 1966 to improve rural income and living conditions, migration to
 cities has accelerated.    He cites data showing that from 1950
 to 1966 the rural population dropped by only 600,000 while during
 only six years from 1966 to 1972 it fell by 4,800,000.  In 1970
 ai'ne, 1,700,00( rural dwellers migrated to cities.  But Perevedentsev
 argues that despite the outcry from those concerned with maintaining
 agricultural production, the agricultural sector has a general
 surplus of labor which is obscured by regional maldistribution on
 the one hand and inefficient organization on the other.
 The author points out that agricultural areas where labor is
 scarce--Siberia, north and central Russia--are losing population
 especially rapidly, while areas with surplus farm labor such as
 Central Asia, the Caucasus, Moldavia, and the west Ukraine are
 actually gaining population.  The problem, in his view, is to
 stimulate migration from the surplus areas.  To this end, he
 deriders the use of administrative restraints such as denying
 interral passports to kolkbozniks in order to prevent their
 migration, and he urges  adoption of measures to ease the
 adjustment of rural migrants to urban life.  At the same time,
 he emphcsizes that "the basis of regulating rural migration
 must be sought in labor and its organization."  Noting that the
 productivity of Soviet farm labor is only 20-25 percent that of

 U.S. f,xm labor, he maintains that adoption of link-typo farm
 labor irganization could raise productivity, retain enough
 skilled young people in the countryside, and also release large
 numbers of surplus farm laborers.
 Perevedentsev's approach to agriculture appears to be similar
 to that of former RSFSR Premier Voronov.  While Politburo
 agricultural supervisor Polyanskiy has pressed for large
 investments to raise rural living standards and retain farm
 labor, Voronov in a 24 November 1970 speech rejected the
 argument that youth was leaving the village mainly because of
 poor living conditions and instead cited poor labor organization
 and lack of job opportunity as more important factors.
 Perevedentsev likewise rejects as "naive" the notion that
 building good clubs and modt.rn well-equipped villages would
 stop the outflow from the countryside.  Like Voronov, he sees
 the new forms of "unregulated" farm labor organization as the
 key to keeping youth interested in farm work and to boosting
 production.
