COMMUNIST SUBVERSION THREAT TO AFRICA - 1 
TRAINING OF  GUERRILLAS AND SABOTEURS 
Africans, often without the knowledge or consent of their own governments, 
are being trained in sabotage, terrorism, and guerrilla warfare in Communist 
countries. Ostensibly, the training is being given to support "national liberation" 
movements. But the Communists, with their usual long-term objectives in mind, 
are using this as a cover to tr6inn arm, and indoctrinate young men for eventual 
subversion against, the new governments of Africa. 
Recent evidence seems to indicate .a three-point programme:-
(a) Guerrilla training, open or secret; in Communist 
States - China, Bulgaria, Cuba and possibly 
Czechoslovakia. and East Germany. 
(b) Communist-aided (money, arms,. instruction) 
guerrilla training in sympathetic or non-aligned 
countries in Africa such as the United Arab 
Republic, Algeria, Congo, Guinea, Ghana and others. 
Komsomol and political training of selected people 
as angents provocateurs to create disunity and the correct 
"revolutionary" atmosphere for guerrilla activity and 
revolt against new Or unstable governments. 
:In this context there is also the risk that even university 
etudents' sent to Communist countries can return home 
subverted. 
(e) 
plan2baasis on Violence 
The Organisation of Afri. n Unity (OAU) and nationalist leaders are keeping a 
close watch on the situation. Communist emphasis on violence as a means of 
bringing about political change could have a strong appeal, especially among 
dissidents in one-party ? States. 
China, the strongest advocate of violent revolution, has ?set the pace, But ? 
warnings have 'been voiced by, among others, Leopoldville's Etoile u Congo. 
On September 18, 1964; it said: "China is stepping up the training of Africans in 
guerrilla tactics and in selaversion. The important men responsible for training 
camps are Chang Chi-yu and Liu Chang-sheng. Of these, the first is head of the

Cultural Commission for Foreign Relations, the second is Secretary-General of the 
Chinese African Friendship Association. Instructors are trained at 'The First 
Branch of the Marxist-Leninist Institute' 'whose teaching staff includes leading 
Chinese Communists such as Teng Hsiao-ping and Chen Po-ta." 
The Communist States are careful to hide this training behind agreed programmes 
of military aid and assistance, instruction, and supply of arms. But these open 
negotiations often provide opportunities for contacts with suitable recruits for 
their "guerrilla academies". China is known. to have trained guerrillas and 
terrorists from the Cameroons, Angola, Guinea, Congo, Kenya, Mozambique, 
Nigeria and Bechuanaland.. Bulgaria has trained recruits from Zambia, Kenya and 
the Cameroons. Cuba, which has set. up guerrilla camps for more than 10,000 
recruits, is reported to be training terrorists from Kenya, Zanzibar, South. Africa, 
Rhodesia, Angola, Guinea, Mali and Ghana.. 
Trainintin Communist States 
The Chinese Communists' experience of guerrilla warfare is readily available, 
openly or in secret, to Africans, especially those engaged in civil war or opposed 
to their own nationalist governments The Peking People's  Daily, in December, 1961 
also claimed that Chinese pamphlets on guerrilla warfare enjoyed a wide 
circulation in Africa. 
Convincing evidence of Africans being trained in military subversion came wiih 
the arrest of six men on their return to the Cameroons from China in 1960., 
Notebooks and other material in their possession gave full details of the 10-week 
courses which they and .three other Cameroon nationals attended at a military. 
academy just outside Peking. The course covered instruction on the manufacture 
of explosives, mines and grenades, their use in sabotage (demolishing bridges, 
railways, and telephone communications), and training in the use of more 
sophisticated military weapons as well as political indoctrination.. 
The six men were to pass on wnat they had learned to the local terrorist 
organisation, Arrnee de Leber, Lion Nationale K.amerounaise (ALNK), the militant 
Left-wing of the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC). When the Cameroons 
became independent in January, 1960, the ANLK continued its subversive 
activities. The Chinese, significantly, chose to support a movement engaged in 
subverting the independent nationalist government, thus proving they are not 
interested in mere "national liberation" and that it is an atmosphere of unrest 
and political agitation which serves the aims of Communism, not peaceful national 
independence. 
Under False Pretexts 
- 
The Cameroon Government .vas unaware at the time that these men were 
training in China. This -V a y17 cc clear by its delegate to the United Nations in 
December, 1961.:

"Information obtained shows that many young Cameroonians, 
Inveigled and led into China under false pretexts, ieceive there 
psychological and military preparations for the ultimate goal 
of being sent back to our national territory, there to engage 
in subversive activities and to serve as the instructors and 
personnel in an eventual effective general rebellion." 
The Chinese, purporting to back "freedom fighters", make an early start in 
selecting those trainee-guerrillas whom they feel may help them in their subsequent 
struggle for power and influence he an emergent country. They are particularly 
active in the Portuguese territories in Africa. In August, 1963, it was reported 
that an unspecified number of men from the African Independence Party of Guinea 
and the Cape Verde Islands (PAIGC) had undertaken a six-month course in guerrilla 
warfare in China. Some 50 members of the Moverrieet,P2kulaiye pour la 
Liberation d/Angola were also on a similar course. in 1963 a representative of the 
Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) who visited Algeria, claimed that 
President Ben Bella had offered military training to Rhodesian Africans. 
Volunteers, who could only be used for guerrilla activity, were to travel at the 
expense of the Chinese Government, Algeria, which has paid tribute to "the 
unceasing material and moral support" given to the FLN by Peking, still maintains 
strong military connections with China. 
The Chinese Embassy in Dar es Salaam is the springboard for political activity 
in the whole of East and Central Africa where Peking obviously hopes to exploit 
any possible discontent and disillusionment which is sometimes felt in new 
countries. 
Two Years in China 
Other reports on guerrilla or irregular military training courses in China 
Inc/tide:-
The former Minister of Education in the Lumumba 
Government, Pierre Mulele, who led the recent 'revolt 
in the Gong Kwilu Province, is reported to have been 
trained in subversion and guerrilla tactics during two 
years in China. According to the Hindustan Times, 
Mulelels faction received 200 tickets, "obviously to and 
from Peking", for the formation of military cadres under 
the supervision of the Chinese War Academy. 
in December, 1964, China was behind plans to grant 
scholarships., including military training, to "revolutionary" 
African students in Indonesia. 
In October, 1964, 10 "agitators", trained in China, had 
arrived in. Rwanda and were at work among refugees. Six

others returned from China to give "military 
training" to refugees. 
Luca Fernandes, a self-styled "general" was trained 
in China, He was one of three infiltrators caught in 
Mozambique. 
Eighteen Kenyans were undergoing a course in 
guerrilla warfare at Wuhan Military Academy, China, 
the East African Standard of Nairobi reported on 
September 5, 1964. 
Seven captured supporters of D:ibo Baka.ry, who attempted 
armed infiltration of Niger, admitted that they had been 
trained in Nanking and Peking. President Diori said that 
the ringleaders were trained in China, 
Nierney, Radio reported in October, 1964, that a 
captured terrorist, who was given intensive "military 
training" in China, was told by instructors that "to 
attack and eliminate all reactionaries" on his return 
would help progress. Another captured terrorist, 
Yarouba Issa, admitted that "all the training we had 
in China was against our will because we had no intention 
of returning to attack our brothers and sisters." 
Le Nier (November Z3, 1964) published a captured 
document which indicated that China-trained terrorists 
were returning with arms and ammunition to Niger. 
The Congolese Central Government announced in 
February, 1962, that "rebels" were being trained in 
China. Rebels were being taught guerrilla tactics by 
Congolese instructors trained in China, according to 
Actualites Africaines October 3, 1964). 
_ 
The first group of members of the Lilo tribe trained 
as guerrillas and saboteurs had returned to Kenya. from 
China, according to reports in December, 1964. 
OATJ Aware of Danger 
The OAU and its member-governments are fully aware of the notential threat 
behind the indoctrination and training of guerrillas by China. Their fears were 
voiced by the Ivory Goastts President Houphouet -Boigny in January, 1965, when he 
said:-

"The dangers threatening Africa to-day are 
those from Communist: China. Should we who 
do not want Africa to remain under foreign 
domination allow it to become Chinese?. ...To 
arrive more rapidly at their (China's) goal, 
they have established training camps for our African 
patriots from which Cotnmunist subversion is 
organised to gnaw at our continent Mt by bit. They 
have formed groups to be used to fight brothers and 
sisters in opposing, camps. This is new in Africa and 
it is a tragedy that worries us." 
Eastern European countries are also taking an increasing interest in training 
guerrillas and politically-indoctrinated. "freedom fighters" from Africa. Angolans 
have been trained in Czechoslovakia and East Germany while other Africans, including 
those from South Africa, have been trained elsewhere in Eastern Europe, including 
Bulgaria, Russian, Czech., and Bulgarian arms have followed them back to Angola 
and the Congo. Chinese anti-aircraft guns, automatic weapons, and ammunition 
have also been found in the Congo, 
Bulgaria, one of the most militant of Communist States,- is known to run 
guerrilla training courses for Africans. In 1963 a full-scale course on subversion 
was attended by some 200 Africans, including 76 Kenyans and 15'Cameroonians. 
Instruction was: in English and covered small-arms training and the use of oxplosives. 
They were told to "lie low" on their return, make friends with the army, and await 
further instructions. 
Bulgarials most notorious graduate was John Chanda, a Zambian, who was 
arrested at Ndola in December, 1964. and fined ?45, or seven month& imprisonment, 
for illegally bringing arms and ammunition into the country. The Bulgarian 
Government had provided Chanda, whom they dubbed "General", with. a certificate 
explaining the origin of the weapons. He claimed, in fact, that they were presents 
from Bulgaria to show my party." 
Three Kenyans left for Bulgaria late in 1961, travelling via Addis Ababa, One, 
Hiram Mwangi, came into prominence in March, 1963, as leader of a group of 
guerrilla trainees. Like Chanda, he appears to have occupied?a?privileged position 
in Bulgaria with comfortable quarters and an official car. The Kenya African 
Democratic Union, then the country's opposition, expressed its disquiet over the 
training of members of the Kikuyu tribe in Bulgaria. Nevertheless, there ? was. a 
dramatic increase in the number of trainees in April; 1964, when more than 100 
Kenyans, including 79 Kikuyu, were flown to Bulgaria.

who promised them "scholarships, '' But these, they were told later, wer6 bnly

for "military training'. Of the.15 who took the course, .3i)$: were arrested on 
their return home. 
Cuba has begun to play an important role in the training of politically-
indoctrinated guerrillas from Africa. The main revolutionary training camp is 
reported to be at Mina del Frio, a village on the slopes of the Sierra Maestra. 
Students call the installation the "Guerrilla Academy". Political and theoretical 
aspects of revolution are taught at a school in Havana. 
According to official estimates, some 100-200 Africans a year are being 
trained. in Cuba. They come from Zanzibar, Kenya, South Africa, Rhodesia, 
Angola, Mali and Ghana. The African contingent is small, compared to those 
from other parts of the world, but according to Cuban revolutionary theory not 
more than a selected nucleus is needed.? (Given money, material, and local 
backing, it is claimed, 20 or 30 commandos can ignite a revolution or cause wide 
disturbances), In Zanzibar, 20 to 30 people trained in Cuba formed the spearhead 
of the armed revolt which overthrew the Sultan and the government in January, 1964, 
They were sent. to Cuba in January, 1962, by Sheikh Abdul Rahman 13abu, 'formerly 
a-New China News .Agency representative in Zanzibar,? who is now Minister of 
Cooperatives and Commerce in the government of Tanzania. 
Trait in Africa, 
? 
3?oliticallyeindoctrinated guerrillas (often in the guise of "freedom fighters") 
are also being trained in Africa, and Algeria is probably the most important centre 
for this. There are many instructors, including Chinese, at camps there, and 
Algeria also has large stocke of arms left over from the seven-year struggle for 
independence. 
The Tlemcen training centre has been instructing Africans from Portuguese 
territories since 1961, and more recently there have been intakes frdm South Africa, 
The Chinese Premier, Chou En-lai, expressed great interest in these centres on 
his visit and offered to make a substantial contribution. 
The ? Congo has provided an almost equally important training centre for 
Angolans, who are being instructed by compatriots schooled in Algeria. The 
Angolan Revolutionary Government in Exile (GRAE) is known to have sought aid 
from China, bet the Congolese are unlikely to welcome this after their own experience 
of Corrxrnunist subversion. 
Tanganyika has shown signs of concern since its Army mutiny in January, 1964. 
Its refugee camps have become nests of unrest and intrigue, and more extremist 
dissidents have been expelled. Some refugees from Mozambique for instance, 
were recently reported to be training in the United Arab Republic. he November, 
1964, the Tanzanian Government was compelled to eransfer refugees from the 
capital, Dar es Salaam, to Mbeya more than 300 rails inland "where they would be 
less able to stir up trouble, and where foreign diplomats would be less able to 
subvert them."

In Portuguese Guinea trained guerrillas received arms fr OM Algeria and 
Communist countries, and employed Czech Communist military instructors. Their 
leader, Ami/car Cabral, is one of the few actually trained abroad. 
Subversion of "Freedom" Grouks 
_ 
The Communists have been quick to exploit and subvert so-called "freedom 
fighters", many of whose efforts are now being di r,C;!ttid 'against their own 
governments The 0.A.U, moreover, supports oiele what it considers' to be 
legitimate "freedom" movements. Meanwhile, the Jetureese.of the Congo's 
Kwilu Province, trained by .Pierre Mulele in Chinese methods of guerrilla 
warfare, are still regarded as a _considerable threa,t to political stability in that 
part of Africa. Similarly, in the Federal Cameroon Republic, terrorists 
supported by Communist countries, are still fighting in the name of the illegal 
and exiled crypto-Cornmunist Union des Populzttione du Cameroun. 
Kenyals Minister for Pan-African Affairs, Mr. Leter Koirkange recently warned 
the House of Representatives that some "freedom fighters" from other States, 
especially those seeking help to tree their countries, were Yspies". Such appeals 
would have to be examined closely. Kenyals own military unrest the abortive 
army mutiny of January, 1964 - was not entirely unexpected. As early as 1962 
there were reports that groups of Kenyans were training in methods of subversion 
and sabotage, as well as guerrilla warfare, in Ghana and the Soviet Union. They 
were to head "action brigades" to take over by force when the country became 
independent. 
Later, it was reported that a guerrilla training camp had been .established in 
Ghana by the Bureau of African Affairs. 
Kenya's Defence Minister, Dr. Njorage Mungai, told Parliament on March 30. 
1965: "Many people have been trained in the armed forces in other countries, and 
the first we know about it is when they get back." Asked why there was a delay 
in accepting three Russian.-trained "fighter pilots" for the Air Force, he replied : 
"Fully trained men are welcome, but they have to go through the proper channels 
if they wish to join the KAP'." 
Wish to Preserve Africa 
Among African leaders who have exposed Communist subversive tactics are 
Presidents Diori of Niger and Yarneogo of Upper Volta. They told a news 
conference on February 2, 1965, that they wished to preserve Africa, at the birth of 
its political independence., from the grip of Communist China. They condemned 
China's attempt to introduce, by force, "ideology, weapons, money, and subversion". 
President Dieri pointed out that young Africans were being trained in China to be 
"leaders of subversion", while the "middle ranks" were being schooled in Algeria 
and at Manko, tear Accra,
