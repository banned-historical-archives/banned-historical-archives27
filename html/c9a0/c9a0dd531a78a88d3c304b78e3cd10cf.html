 SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY DEVELOPMENTS .  .  .  .  +    .  .  .  .  .  .   Page
 On the eve of Secretary Rusk's 16 April talk with
 Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, an authoritative Izvestia artii-
 dle~ stated that new guarantees for Western access  o Ber-
 lin could be negotiated without difficulty if the West
 agreed to a .change~ in the status of West Berlin which would
 terminate the   "occupation regime."   This demonstration of
 Soviet willingness to move ahead in Berlin talks  however
 was overshadowed by Khrushchev's
 maneuvers to
 place the USSR in a strong position to exploit the re-
 sumption of US atmospheric tests.

 .     P     9     ?     i     e     7
 Citing "tremendous difficulties" on the economic front,
 Premier Chou En-lai presented to the National People's Con-
 gress a program of retreat and adjustment that gives prior-
 ity to agricultural recovery rather   than industrial expan-
 sion.                   Chou also advanced a program aimed at                                                                                                            shoring                      up
 popular support for the regime.   Mao Tse-tung and the other
 authors of policies leading to the present crisis are ap-
 parently still powerful enough to deflect criticism from
 themselves.   Chou's remarks on international affairs and
 recent Soviet comments and actions indicate that, while
 both sides wish to muffle the controversy as much as pos-
 sible,  neither has modified its basic positions on issues

 Further trouble along the Israeli-Syrian border seems
 likely.    Israel has categorically rejected the UN Security
 Council's resolution on  9 April condemning Israel's attack
 on Syria, and has attacked the objectivity of General von
 Horn as chief of staff of the UN Truce Supervision Organiza-
 tion.                 Syrian fishing boats are again operating on Lake
 Tiberias, and the Israelis have moved a limited number of
 tanks and heavy equipment toward the border area.   The com-
 position of Syria's new transitional  cabinet, which contains
 only one prominent political figure, represents a considerable
 shift to the left.   This may lead to a gradual improvement
 in relations with Egypt.   The army,  despite continued fac-
 tionali
 sm,  remains the dominant factor in Syria.

 the OAS--including appointment of a new commander in chief

 Plans to restore order in Oran, the worst trouble spot, may
 be difficult to implement even with the, reinforcements

 De Gaulle's desire to allay parliamentary opposition, early
 difficulties with National Assembly opponents of the growth
 of presidential power are in prospect.

 The stalemated talks concerning Congolese unification
 were recessed by Adoula on 16 April.   The central govern-
 ment's attempt to prevent Tshombe's departure for Elisabeth-
 ville on 18 April, despite public UN guarantees of his
 freedom of movement, may further inflame anti-Adoula senti-
 ment in southern Katanga.   UN representative Gardiner has
 informed Tshomb6 that he expects talks to resume no later
 than 24 April and that Tsh.omb6 should come forth with con-
 crete proposals at that time.   However, it may be difficult
 to bring the two together again.

 Renewed demands by top military leaders that President
 Guido take immediate steps to ban the Peronistas from all
 political activity may cause the Chamber of Deputies
 to speed up a decision on the Peronista. electoral victories.
 Elements of the two major political parties are discussing a
 compromise formula calling for the Chamber to seat the 47
 new Peronista deputies on 1 May and for the Peronistas to
 agree to the federal government's taking control of the
 provinces where Peronistas won the governorships.   Action
 on the Peronista question has been delayed by differences
 within most political parties and among the military.  A
 Chamber committee is to pass on the seating of newly elected
 deputies by 26 April.

 A new coalition proposal by Vientiane provides for
 neutralist control of defense and interior in a cabinet
 headed by the King.   This appears designed to shift the
 onus of inflexibility onto Souvanna Phouma.   Vientiane is
 planning to send "friendship missions" to several South-
 east Asian nations to seek diplomatic and financial support.
 Antigovernment units are maintaining pressure on Nam Tha
 as well as in the Saravane-Attopeu area in southern Laos.

 ETHIOPIA - SOMALI REPUBLIC .       .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  16
 Relations between Ethiopia and the Somali Republic,
 already strained because of religious, cultural, and trib-
 al differences, have recently worsened,.                          Government offi-
 cials in both states appear to be attempting to control
 forces in the border areas, but the rise in tension has
 increased the likelihood of fighting between Somali nomads
 and Ethiopian villagers.   An incident might be seized upon
 by an Ethiopian troop  commander as an occasion to strike
 at Somali targets across the border.

 The death of four students following a clash with mil-
 itary police on 12 April has led to demands by the main
 anti-Communist opposition parties, supported by some pro-
 fessional and labor groups, that President Ydigoras resign.
 Ydigoras apparently regards the present threat to his re-
 gime as more serious than that posed by the rioting in mid-
 March; he made a conciliatory speech on 15 April and has
 subsequently sent his family abroad.   The military leaders
 profess loyalty to the President  but their continued sup-
 port is by no means assured.

 The presidential election set for 29 April will be
 the culmination of efforts by the army=-backed reform group
 to give El Salvador a constitutional government committed
 to overdue social and economic reforms.                The government
 candidate, Colonel Julio Rivera,           is unopposed; all opposi-
 tion parties are boycotting the election, charging it will
 be rigged in favor of the widel    opular government party.

 President Arosemena, who has adopted a program of
 moderate social reform, continues under heavy pressure from
 both right and left.   Military leaders, who forced him to
 break diplomatic relations with Cuba on 2 April, still
 threaten to overthrow him unless he rids his government of
 "Communists"--thus far unidentified.   A Communist-front
 group staged an abortive rising on 5-6 April, and the
 Communist party seems to be preparing for guerrilla war-
 fare.

 political maneuvering in the party presidium in prepara-
 tion for a succession struggle.   During Khrushchev's ex-
 tended absences from Moscow, party Secretary Kozlov and
 Deputy Premier Kosygin seem to have the primary "care-
 taker" responsibilities for party and government affairs
 respectively.
 SOVIET ECONOMY IN FIRST QUARTER 1962 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page   21
 Soviet industry in the first three months of 1962
 continued to perform at a high tempo,  with rates of increase
 little changed from a year ago.   A TASS summary of re-
 sults reported that industrial output increased over 9 per-
 cent, well above the pace needed to achieve the objective
 of the Seven-Year Plan (1959-65),   The 5-percent increase
 in industrial productivity, although still below both the
 planned rate for 1962 and the Seven-Year-Plan rate, marks
 some improvement over 1961.   Investment and construction
 data, which during 1961 indicated possible future dif-
 ficulties for the economy, are not included in the first-
 quarter summaries.
 SOVIET BLOC OIL EXPORTS   .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page   22
 The Soviet bloc last year exported to nonbloc coun-
 tries more than 30 million tons of crude oil and petro-
 leum products, a quantity valued at about $500,000,000 and
 constituting a 25-percent increase over 1960.             Exports by
 the bloc in 1961 filled about 3 percent of total nonbloc:
 demand for petroleum.   Prices for bloc petroleum are gener-
 ally lower than world market prices, and the bloc encourages
 barter arrangements.   Present indications are that bloc
 petroleum exports in 1962 may rise another 10 percent.

 Ne Win's military regime, now in its second month, has

 austerity--qualities notably  lacking in Burma under civil-
 ian rule.   Pledged like previous regimes to a neutral for-

 President Kekkonen's success in obtaining a majority
 coalition government further strengthens his already firm
 control over foreign policy and internal affairs in Finland.
 The new cabinet, which controls 112 of the 200 seats in
 parliament, consists of Agrarians, Conservatives,  Liberals,
 representatives of the Swedish People's party, and three
 extraparliamentary  ministers from the Communist-influenced
 Central Confederation of Trade Unions (SAK).   Kekkonen
 wanted SAK participation to counterbalance the Conserva-
 tives and mollify the USSR.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 WEEKLY REVIEW
 SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
 The Soviet leaders last
 week gave further indications
 of their desire to maintain
 contact with the US for further
 exchanges on a Berlin settle-
 ment.  On the eve of Secretary
 Rusk's 16 April talk with Soviet
 Ambassador Dobrynin, an author-
 itative Izvestia article un-
 derseoreT Moscow's view that
 new guarantees for Western
 access to Berlin could be nego-
 tiated  without difficulty if
 the West agreed to a change in
 the status of West Berlin which
 would terminate the "occupation
 regime."  This demonstration of
 willingness to move ahead in
 Berlin talks, however, was over-
 shadowed by Soviet maneuvers
 to place the USSR in a strong
 position to exploit the resump-
 tion of US atmospheric tests.
 The Nuclear Test Issue
 Moscow apparently antic-
 ipates that the weeks immedi-
 ately ahead will be dominated
 by the nuclear testing issue.
 Khrushchev's denunciation
 Jwas followed by a Soviet
 call  or a moratorium on tests
 and acceptance of the "compro-
 mise" control proposals advanced
 by the eight neutral nations at
 Geneva as a basis for further
 negotiations.
 Soviet tactics at Geneva
 have been aimed at portraying
 the bloc delegations as
 closely aligned with the eight
 neutral-nation delegations
 against the US and Britain.
 Soviet chief delegate Zorin
 promptly endorsed India's
 call, for a moratorium on all
 testing for the duration of
 the conference.  He warned that
 US tests would have serious con-
 sequences for the negotiations
 and challenged the US and
 Britain to accept a moratorium.
 Zorin also characterized the
 US-UK joint statement as a
 blatant maneuver to fix
 responsibility on the USSR for
 the impending Western tests and
 charged that the US now is in-
 terested only in justifying
 its tests.  The Soviets are
 attempting to create the im-
 pression that US and British
 rejection of a moratorium is
 a direct rebuff to the eight
 neutrals.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Zorin's acceptance on 19
 April of the eight neutralists'
 "compromise" proposal for a
 control system as a basis for
 further negotiations was a fur-
 ther maneuver to demonstrate
 the USSR's support of neutral-
 ist efforts to break the impasse
 at Geneva.   He coupled this
 with a renewed call for a
 moratorium on testing for the
 duration of the negotiations.
 Moscow clearly hopes these
 moves, which are designed to
 appear as acceptance of the
 principle of international in-
 spection and verification of
 unidentified events in the USSR,
 will blur the issue of Soviet
 rejection of an effective in-
 spection system and maximize
 the political costs to the US
 and Britain of proceeding with
 atmospheric tests.
 Zorin interpreted the neu-
 tralists' proposal, which
 would base an inspection and
 control system on existing
 national detection networks,
 as an endorsement of most of
 the USSR's position.   He
 contended that the provision
 that the nuclear powers could
 "invite" the proposed inter-
 national commission of scien-
 tists to conduct on-site inspec-
 tions does not carry a clear
 obligation to allow such in-
 spections.   He added, however,
 that this does not mean that
 the Soviet Union will necessar-
 ily refuse to permit inspections.
 It is likely that Moscow
 will make further moves prior
 to the resumption of US tests
 to demonstrate its professed
 desire for a test ban agreement
 and the alleged US and British
 opposition to any proposals
 which might delay their test
 series.  The Supreme Soviet
 session which convenes on 23
 April may be used as the forum
 for issuing new appeals for a
 test moratorium while negotia-
 tions proceed on the neutralists'
 proposal.
 Despite these patent ma-
 neuvers to attach sole blame on
 the West for another round of
 nuclear tests by both sides,
 the tactics at Geneva have
 underlined the Soviet leadrs'
 unwillingness to pay the price
 of meaningful concessions to
 forestall US tests.  They ap-
 pear confident that international
 pressures will oblige the US
 to make further modifications
 in its position.  A member of
 the Soviet delegation frankly
 acknowledged to a US official
 that,  in the USSR's view, the
 control provisions worked out
 by bloc and Western scientists
 at Geneva in 1958 are dead; he
 predicted that the US eventually
 would come to accept the So-
 viet stand on a test ban based
 on national detection systems.
 Moscow's negative attitude was
 also reflected in the absence
 of any reference to a test
 bare  in  the  1962  May Day
 slogans.
 bloc delegations may
 w t-h raw from the disarmament
 talks in protest against the re-
 sumption of US atmospheric tests.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 A ranking member of the So-
 viet delegation, however,
 conveyed the impression to a
 US official on 13 April that
 the USSR will not stage a
 calk-out, but he tried to leave
 some doubt about Soviet in-
 tentions.   It is unlikely
 that the bloc could win the
 support of the nonaligned dele-
 gat ions for such a maneuver.
 Sentiment among these delegations
 for a breakoff or an indefinite
 recess after the US resumes
 testing appears to have weak-
 ened.  The Burmese delegate
 recently told Ambassador Dean
 that the eight neutrals did
 not have a concerted plan for
 a walk-out.
 Berlin and Germany
 Moscow probably regards
 the bilateral talks on Berlin
 which resumed in Washington
 on 16 April as a holding opera-
 tion pending developments on
 the nuclear testing front .F_
 the Soviets are prepared
 or a period of recriminations
 on testing which will at least
 temporarily reduce prospects
 for movement toward a Berlin
 settlement.  There are no in-
 dications, however, that this
 agitation will result in any
 immediate hardening of the
 Soviet position on Berlin or
 any sharp intensification of
 harassments of Western access
 to the city.
 Bloc progaganda contains
 no warning that Moscow is in
 any hurry to bring the Berlin
 situation to a head in the near
 future.  The Izvestia article----
 s_Lgned by Polyanov, w o authored
 a series of authoritative com-
 ments on Berlin in January and
 February--left the impression
 that Moscow envisages a series
 of high-level talks; it avoided
 any suggestion that the Soviets
 might break off and sign a
 separate peace treaty with
 Fast Germany.  The article
 sought to convey Moscow's
 readiness to enter serious bar-
 gaining on an international ac-
 CE!ss authority by reaffirming
 the proposal made last month
 by East German party chief UI-
 bricht that an arbitration body
 composed of the guarantor coun-
 tries be established in con-
 nection with a new Berlin agree-
 ment.   This scheme is designed
 to provide a facade of continu-
 ing Soviet responsibility for
 Allied access by stipulating
 that the USSR would act as the
 aribitration body's agent in
 settling any access disputes
 which may arise between East
 Germany and the West.
 Although both Izvestia and 25X1
 the Ulbricht speech called for
 the replacement of Western
 "occupation troops" by UN or
 neutral contingents, an  East
 German deputy foreign minister
 hinted in a recent interview
 with an Indian correspondent
 that token Western forces might
 remain in West Berlin. He added
 that Ulbricht's proposed
 arbitration body was only a
 first step to solve the problem,
 and that further measures to
 meet Western objections "are
 not excluded."
 The East German press has
 described reported US ideas

 on an international access
 authority in which East Germany
 would play a role as an "ap-
 proach to reality" and asserted
 that the US-Soviet talks "have
 not been so negative as the
 Bonn troublemakers had hoped."
 Paul Verner, a high-level East
 German party spokesman, stated
 on 14 April that while the
 situation in West Berlin cannot
 remain unchanged, this problem
 "must be regulated" before the
 conclusion of a separate peace
 treaty.   This was the most
 explicit statement to date by
 an East German official that
 the bloc governments do not
 expect to sign a treaty until
 prior arrangements on the status
 of West Berlin and access to
 the city are negotiated with
 the West.
 In a further reflection of
 the USSR's desire to improve
 the atmosphere in Berlin in
 light of favorable prospects
 for continued East-West talks,
 Marshal Konev has been replaced
 as commander of Soviet forces
 in East Germany by Colonel Gen-
 eral Yakubovsky.   Konev's re-
 call followed by a few days
 the announcement that General
 Clay would return to the US.
 Konev was sent to East Germany
 in August 1961 in a move close-
 ly related to the decision to
 seal the Berlin sector bound-
 aries and reflecting Khrushchev's
 desire to place a close asso-
 ciate in this key position dur-
 ing a period of greatly increased
 tension in Berlin.
 While the USSR maintains
 its suspension of flight activ-
 ity in the Berlin air corridors,
 it is continuing low-key efforts
 to secure advance notification
 from US military authorities
 for the movement of small con-
 voys onythe autobahn to Berlin.
 In the past, the US has given
 prior notification of convoys
 of eight or more vehicles in
 order to facilitate processing
 at the border crossings.   On
 13 April, in the fourth such
 incident during the past week,
 the Soviets objected to the
 movement of a six-vehicle con-
 voy without prior notification,
 but they have not imposed any
 prolonged delays.
 Outer Space
 In a recent conversation
 with a US Embassy officer,
 a Soviet Foreign Ministry
 official emphasized that co-
 operation in outer space
 could serve as a symbol for
 the improvement of US-Soviet
 relations and perhaps as a
 "touchstone" for progress in
 other areas.   He said that in
 order to be consistent with
 the Soviet position at the
 Geneva disarmament conference, 25X1
 Khrushchev had sidestepped
 the President's suggestion
 for an exchange of tracking
 equipment on the grounds that
 this could present an oppor-
 tunity for US access to so-
 viet territory.  The official
 said, however, that this
 should not deter agreement in
 other areas enumerated by
 Khrush ch ev .
 The official also expressed
 interest in an agreement which
 would preclude the use of
 outer space for experiments ob-
 structing or hindering future
 research.   Such an agreement
 could be used by the Soviets
 as the basis for objecting to
 satellites of the Samos type.
 In the recent US-Soviet bilateral
 talks in New York on joint co-
 operation in outer space re-
 search,  the Soviet delegation
 broached but later withdrew a
 call for discussion of a ban
 on reconnaissance satellites.
 A Soviet delegate at the Geneva
 conference recently informed a
 US delegate that a separate
 ban on nuclear wea.aons in outer
 space is not acceptable  if it
 "involves inspection."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Citing "tremendous dif-
 ficulties" provoked by three
 consecutive years of "serious
 natural calamities," Chinese
 Communist Premier Chou En-lai
 presented a program of'retreat
 and adjustment to the dele-
 gates attending the 1962 ses-
 sion of the National People's
 Congress (NPC),from 27 March
 to 16 April.   Peiping's em-
 barrassment and frustration
 over the failure of its "leap
 forward" policies for rapidly
 transforming China into a
 modern first-class power were
 underscored by the repeated
 postponements of the congress
 and by the secrecy which
 cloaked the meeting after it
 convened.   Of the 164 speeches
 made to the congress, only a
 summary of Chou's "state of
 the union" address has been
 published.
 Chou En-lai asserted in
 his report that economic condi-
 tions had "begun to improve,"
 but a ten-point program which
 he laid out indicates that no
 sharp upturn is being pro-
 jected for 1962.   The program
 gives priority to agricultural
 recovery, calls for more con-
 sumar goods, and prescribes
 further cutbacks in construction
 projects.
 Despite Chou's assertion
 that the extremist "leap for-
 ward" programs between 1958
 and 1960 were correct, his
 speech made clear that these
 programs had been abandoned
 completely.   A "free and de-
 tailed" discussion of Chou's
 report went on for almost
 three weeks, after which he
 had to make a second speech to
 answer questions from the
 delegates; clearly,  the details
 of the shift were controversial.
 Chou's speech and the
 other official releases from
 the congress acknowledged the
 existence of problems in all
 sectors of the economy but shed
 no light on the details of the
 problems or the extent of the
 declines in industrial and
 agricultural production.   For
 the first time,  the state plan
 and budget were not presented
 to the congress.   They will in-
 stead be referred for ratifica-
 tion to the elite body of the
 NPC,  its Standing Committee.
 The regime's unwillingness to
 submit these documents to even
 a closed session of the congress
 suggests that the two-year
 blackout on release of econom-
 ic information will continue.
 Political Problems
 In addition to formal-
 izing the broad retreat on the
 economic front, Chou advocated
 a number of measures designed
 to shore up faltering popular
 support for the regime.   He
 said through 1966, and possibly
 longer,  the regime will con-
 tinue to pay capitalists inter-
 est on their confiscated hold-
 ings,  although such payments
 could have ended this year
 under Peiping's original
 schedule.   Intellectuals, most
 of whom Chou asserted now are
 loyal to Peiping,  are also to
 receive more favorable treat-
 ment.   Their status has
 gradually risen since the

 NNO
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 withdrawal of the Soviet tech-
 nicians in 1960, when Peiping
 was suddenly made dependent on
 its own scientific and techni-
 cal personnel.
 Peiping's published ma-
 terial about the congress threw
 little light on the possibility
 of a major purge of individuals
 responsible for the mistaken
 leap forward policies. People's
 Daily on 16 April defended the
 essential correctness of the
 leap forward policies. This sug-
 gests that their authors are
 still influential enough in the
 hierarchy to deflect charges
 that they were responsible for
 the economic debacle.
 Mao Tse-tung, the chief
 author of the leap forward, at-
 tended both the opening and
 closing sessions of the con-
 gress.   Six.full members of the
 politburo were not listed at
 all as attending the congress.
 Most of them, however, had not
 attended the last session of
 the NPC--in 1960--and their
 absence this year is not neces-
 sarily indicative of impending
 loss of positions.   Similarly,
 the absences among lower levels
 of the party hierarchy do not
 warrant firm conclusions of an
 immiment purge.
 International Relations
 The summary of Chou's re-
 marks to the congress indicates
 that he dwelt on the continuing
 need to unify the world's
 people in the struggle against
 "US imperialism."  Reflecting
 a growing sensitivity in-Pei-
 ping; to Chinese Nationalist
 plans regarding the mainland,
 the premier declared that "US
 military provocations and war
 threats," coupled with Chi-
 nese Nationalist "sabotage
 activities," made it necessary
 for the Chinese people to
 "heighten their vigilance"
 and build up the strength of
 their armed forces.  The
 "liberate Taiwan" slogan did
 not appear in the official sum-
 mary, however, and no sense
 of urgency was developed on
 the Chinese Communist goal of
 seizing the island.
 In the key area of Sino-
 Soviet relations, Chou En-
 lai, according to the summary,
 followed the pattern of re-
 cent Chinese propaganda in try-
 ing to call attention to the
 community of Sino-Soviet inter-
 ests without relinquishing
 fundamental Chinese positions
 in the dispute.   Sops to Mosr
 cow included Chou's placing
 of a qualified approval of
 peaceful coexistence ahead of
 support for national liber-
 ation and his pro forma en-
 dorsement of negotiations with
 the West.
 In other passages, how-
 ever,, Chou touched on Chinese
 positions which have long sepa-r
 rated Peiping and Moscow.  These
 included an emphasis on the
 need for constant struggle and
 a rei'.teration that the concept
 --objectionable to the USSR--
 that the "east wind prevails
 over the west wind" is a proper

 guide for Communist strategy.
 Insistence on the correctness
 and continued vitality of the
 leap forward and the commune
 also demonstrated Peiping's
 continued adherence to formu-
 lations that have divided the
 two Communist giants.
 The Sino-Indian border is
 another area in which Peiping
 refuses to modify its views to
 placate Moscow.   Delegates to
 the Congress were instructed
 on the deterioration in Sino-
 Indian relations and given
 copies of last winter's exchange
 of notes between Peiping and
 New Delhi.   Mosocw regards Chi-
 na's stand in this matter as a
 reflection of narrow nationalism.
 Moscow, too, has reaffirmed
 the basic concepts of its for-
 eign policy.   In the same 17
 April issue of Izvestia which
 carried an account oche reso-
 lutions and communique of the
 NPC, a long article appeared
 dealing with the practice of
 "peaceful coexistence and inter-
 national law," attacking Molotov
 and Stalinism,  and defending
 Khrushchev's policy of "peace-
 ful coexistence" between com-
 munism and capitalism.
 In other areas, differences
 between the.two countries con-
 tinue to appear.   At the 14th
 Soviet Komsomol Congress the Chi-
 nese delegate, who was sitting
 on the podium along with the
 speaker, refused to applaud a
 Soviet attack on Albania delivered
 by the head of the Komsomol.
 Furthermore,  Soviet Foreign Min-
 ister Gromyko arrived in Yugo-
 slavia on 16 April to return
 Yugoslav Foreign Minister Popo-
 vic's visit last year.  The
 Chinese continue to express
 their enmity to that country
 and its "revisionist" policies,
 and Gromyko's visit thus was
 made in complete disregard for
 Chinese views.
 At the same time, attempts
 to rnuffle the controversy con-
 tinue.   The Soviet delegation
 which arrived in Peiping on 13
 April to complete negotiations
 on trade "and other economic
 matters" for 1962 is headed
 by Minister of Foreign Trade
 Patolichev and is about the
 same level as last year's dele-
 gation.   The presence in the
 delegation of a vice chair-
 man from the Soviet State Com-
 mittee for Foreign Economic
 Relations and references to
 "other economic matters" sug-
 gest that the sharply cur-
 tailed program of Soviet aid
 to China is being discussed.
 It is unlikely, however,  that
 any significant improvement in
 this program will be negotiated.
 The need for China to build an
 "independent" national economy
 was stressed to the congress
 delegates.
 Recent bloc trade pro-
 nouncements indicate that
 Soviet trade with China this
 year is expected to drop
 to less than $1.1 billion--
 about half the peak year of
 1959.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Border Tension
 Developments since the UN
 Security Council passed its
 resolution on 9 April condemn-
 ing Israel's recent attack on
 Syria appear to portend further
 trouble along the border.   On
 10 April, Israel's Knesset, by
 a 76-3 vote, categorically
 rejected the Security Council
 resolution and reasserted Is-
 rael's right of self-defense
 and its sovereignty over all
 of Lake Tiberias.   in a speech
 introducing the motion, Prime
 Minister Ben-Gurion strongly
 criticized the United States,
 which had cosponsored the UN
 resolution, and General von
 Horn of the UN Truce Super-
 vision Organization (UNTSO) for
 applying a "double standard"
 in judging Israeli and Syrian
 actions.  The Israelis objected
 to Von Horn's "inaccurate state-
 ments" and "distortions" in  his
 report to the Security Council
 on the border clashes.
 Syrian fishing boats are
 again operating on Lake Tiberias,
 and the Israelis claim that Syr-
 ian Army equipment has been
 seen on the lake shore.  The
 Israelis have returned their
 patrol boat to the lake and
 have moved a limited number of
 tanks and heavy equipment to-
 ward the area.   US Embassy of-
 ficials in Tel Aviv are con-
 vinced that Israel  will launch
 any new retaliatory operation
 in greater force because of the
 evident failure of the 16-17
 March raid to intimidate the
 Syrians.
 The Israelis tend to iden-
 tify Syrian shootings with at-
 tempts to thwart implementation
 of their plans to use the waters
 of Lake Tiberias in their Jordan
 River diversion project.   The
 chief question affecting the
 border situation is what the
 new Syrian regime intends to
 do about Israel's scheme.
 Meanwhile, three road
 ambushes within the past week
 in the Negev wasteland of south-
 ern Israel have aggravated  Israe-
 li  sensitivities about border
 conditions.   Isreal apparently
 believes bedouin marauders are
 responsible, and Jordan has in-
 dicated it will cooperate in
 efforts to control its border.
 Syrian Cabinet
 Syria's new transitional
 cabinet, formed on 16 April,
 is headed by a poltical non-
 enity--Bashir al-Azmah, a
 Syrian University Medical School
 professor who served as UAR min-
 ister of health from May 1959
 to August 1960.  Assemption of
 the key Defense Ministry post
 by army Chief of Staff Gen. Zahr
 al-Din, paralleling the practice
 during the Shishakli military
 dictatorship from 1949 to 1954,
 indicates that the army is the
 final arbiter.  The remainder of
 the cabinet for the most part
 is composed of leftist-inclined
 technicians who will administer
 their departments but will show
 little initiative on policy.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Although constituting a consid-
 erable shift to the left, the
 cabinet is anti-UAR.
 Leftist pressure for cab-
 inet representation has been
 recognized by the appointment
 of a majority of socialist-
 minded ministers.   Prominent
 among them is pro-Baathist Ah-
 mad al-Karim, a former army
 colonel, as minister of social
 affairs,  labor, and agrarian
 reform.   This is an office from
 which the Baath's socialistic
 goals may be furthered and its
 grass-roots strength augmented.
 In pre-UAR Syria, Abd al-Karim
 was a member of the Army's Rev-
 olutionary Command Council, which
 in cooperation with other left-
 ist elements and the Communists,
 pushed Syria into a strong pro-
 Soviet posture.   He served for
 a time in the Syrian Region
 cabinet during the UAR era as
 minister of municipal and vil-
 lage affairs.
 Another leftist gain has
 been the appointment of Abd al-
 Halim Qaddur to the influential
 post of minister of interior.
 Qaddur,  a Baathist parliamen-
 tary deputy from 1954 to 1958,
 dropped his party affiliation
 after the union with Egypt and
 became a strong Nasir supporter,
 for which he was rewarded with
 the governorship of Latakia
 Province.   There are indica-
 tions that he may have returned
 to Baathist allegiance.   In any
 case, he can be expected to fol-
 low a leftist line in a ministry
 which exerts considerable influ-
 ence on the day-to-day affairs
 of the country and can rig elec-
 tions.
 Defense Minister Zahr al-
 Din may turn out to be a figure-
 head for the military junta rul-
 ing from behind the scenes.
 Syrian chiefs of staff tradi-
 tionally have not been strong men
 Conservative elements ap-
 pear to be in a minority, hold-
 ing only three posts to the
 socialists' seven.  The only rank-

 and minister of education and
 agriculture.  This is a consid-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The Provisional Algerian
 government (PAG) on 18 April
 again publicly criticized French
 failure to curb terrorism by
 the Secret Army Organization
 (OAS) against Moslems in Algiers
 and Oran, and there are indica-
 tions that Moslem restraint is
 beginning to crack.  The new
 French cabinet's steps to move
 immediately against the OAS--
 including appointment of a new
 commander in chief in Algeria--
 are probably intended to reas-
 sure the PAG.   Plans to restore
 order in Oran, the worst trouble
 spot, may be difficult to imple-
 ment, even with the reinforce-
 ments being sent there.
 Air Force Lieutenant Gen-
 eral Michel Fourquet, the new
 commander in Algeria, seems
 to have been appointed primari-
 ly because of his loyalty to
 De Gaulle, both in implementing
 France's NATO policy and during
 the 1961 military insurrection
 in Algeria, when he was named
 air commander there in place
 of a disloyal officer.   Both
 his relative youth--he is 47--
 and the fact that the bulk of
 French forces in Algeria are
 army units may handicap his
 effectiveness, at least initial-
 ly.
 A French Foreign Ministry
 official told a US Embassy
 representative on 18 April that,
 despite blows sustained by the
 OAS in the first weeks after
 the cease-fire, the situationsin
 Algiers and Oran last week had
 shown considerable deterioration.
 The French official noted that
 the Moslem Force Locale is still
 largely a paper organization,
 and complained that effective
 operation of the mixed armistice
 commission is being delayed by
 "political infighting" among
 the rebels concerning their
 representatives.
 French officials, including
 Minister for Algerian Affairs
 Jox,e and ex-Delegate General
 Morin, have for some time been
 less optimistic about the
 government's chances of putting

 the OAS, particularly in Oran,
 may be adversely affected by
 the obligatory review of Jouhaud's
 sentence, which the superior

 Eventually this will involve a

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The cabinet which France's
 new premier, Georges Pompidou,
 will present for investiture
 soon after parliament reconvenes
 on 24 April is basically similar
 to Debre's in both personnel and
 party representation.   In view
 of the close relationship be-
 tween Pompidou and De Gaulle,
 he President's grand strategy
 will probably be loyally imple-
 mented, but perhaps with more
 flexibility than in the past
 because Pompidou does not have
 Debre's propensity for antagoniz-
 ing people.   Despite De Gaulle's
 desire to allay parliamentary
 opposition, early difficulties
 with National Assembly opponents
 of the growth of presidential
 power are in prospect.
 Approximately two thirds
 of Pompidou's 29-member cabinet
 --mostly holdovers--are from
 the Gaullist Union for the New
 Republic (UNR).   The overall
 orientation is slightly liberal-
 ized, with the rightist UNR as-
 sociate of Debre, Christian de
 la Malene, giving way to the
 "left-wing Gaullist" Gilbert
 Grandval.   The increased "Euro-
 pean" influence of Popular Re-
 publican leaders Pierre Pflimlin
 and Maurice Schumann is somewhat
 offset by the nomination to a
 minor post of the leading UNR
 publicist on European integra-
 tion, Alain Peyrefitte, whose
 ideas on the merits of confedera-
 tion rather than federation seem
 to reflect De Gaulle's own views.
 Gaston Palewski, minister of
 state in charge of scientific
 research--which includes atomic
 energy--opposed a national nu-
 clear weapons program when he
 held a similar position in 1955,
 but he is a faithful Gaullist
 and can be expected to adhere
 to De Gaulle's wishes.
 Pompidou is already under
 fire from the leftist press
 for his Rothschild connections.
 French law permits him to retain
 his business holdings,and this
 will provide a continuing polit-
 ical issue.
 As a confidant of De Gaulle,
 Pompidou has apparently deliber-
 ately refrained from airing his
 views on many subjects.   Most

 observers agree that his eco-

 is considerably more liberal

 The Leopoldville negotia-
 tions between Adoula and Tshombo
 were recessed by the central gov-
 ernment on 16 April. Adoula de-
 parted by riverboat for a "rest"
 tour of the provinces the follow-
 ing day,  and probably will not
 return to Leopoldville before 24
 April. UN representative Gardiner
 has informed Tshomb6 that he ex-
 pects talks to resume no later
 than that date,  and that Tshomb6
 should come forth with concrete
 proposals at that time.
 vincial autonomy, he is prepared
 to drop Katanga's claim to in-
 dependence and to contribute to
 the national treasury. Adoula,
 in turn, came up with a consti-
 tutional formula which, while
 permitting Tshombo to retain
 half of Katanga's mining rev-
 enues, would centralize author-
 ity at Leopoldville to a degree
 unacceptable to Tshombo. Neither
 party has shown a disposition for
 serious bargaining. Gardiner has
 said that fatigue has made Adoula
 "irrational  and irascible."       25X1
 The central government's
 pique at Tshomb6 was dramatized
 by its action on 18 April in
 physically blocking his departure
 from Leopoldville airport.   His
 aircraft finally left for Elisa-
 bethville on the morning of 19
 April, after UN troops removed
 fire trucks which had been placed
 on the runway to prevent his de-
 parture. His freedom of movement
 had earlier been guaranteed by
 the UN Command.
 It is unclear whether Tshombo
 --who charged Adoula with bad
 faith in recessing the talks--
 will seize upon Adoula's action
 and upon the airport incident as
 reasons for breaking off nego-
 tiations. Back in Elisabethville,
 he spoke disparagingly of the
 central government, stating that
 the talks had not been broken off,
 because they had never seriously
 started. The ill-advised attempt
 to detain Tshomb6 reflects the
 central government's sensitivity
 to charges that Adoula is incapa-
 ble of coping with the problem
 of Katanga's secession.
 As of 17 April, Adoula and
 Tshomb6 appeared no closer to
 agreement than when the talks
 began on 18 March. Tshomb6 has
 indicated vaguely that, in re-
 turn for a high degree of pro-
 There is increasing evidence
 that Tshombo's month-long absence
 from Elisabethville,"together with
 the increasing frequency of inci-
 dents involving UN and Katangan
 troops, has increased tension in
 southern Katanga.  A spokesman
 for Tshombe's Elisabethville sup-
 porters has reportedly urged that
 Tshombo return at the first oppor-
 tunity in order to quiet anxiety
 and reassert his leadership. Word
 of rshombe's treatment at the Leo-
 poldville airport may inflame his
 supporters against the central
 government.  There is no assur-
 ance, moreover, that the UN's in-
 tervention on Tshombo's behalf will
 materially alleviate the deep-    25X1
 seated hostility between his sup-
 porters and the UN Command.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Renewed demands by top
 military leaders that Pres-
 ident Guido take immediate steps
 to ban the Peronistas from all
 political activity and offices
 may exert pressure on Argen-
 tina's Chamber of Deputies to
 speed up a decision on the key
 problem of the Peronista elec-
 toral victories.  Action has
 been delayed by divided opinion
 within most political parties
 and among the military, who
 seem increasingly impatient as
 the deadline for decision nears.
 The Chamber has extended its
 special session through 25
 April. A Chamber committee is
 to pass on the seating of newly
 elected deputies by 26 April.
 Elements of the Intransi-
 gent Radical Civic Union  (UCRI)
 and the People's Radical Civic
 Union  (UCIP) have been
 discussing a compromise formula
 which would afford a solution
 within constitutional bounds
 and lessen the chance of vio-
 lence which the Peronistas
 threaten if banned from office
 on 1 May
 The formula calls for the
 192-man Chamber of Deputies
 to seat the 47 new Peronista
 deputies and for the Peronistas
 to agree to the federal govern-
 ment's taking control of the
 nine provinces where neo-Peron-
 istas won the governorships.
 Such federal intervention in
 the provinces is permitted by
 the constitution under the ex-
 isting state of siege, but only
 the Chamber of Deputies can
 rule on its own membership. The
 UCRI and UCRP, which now dom-
 inate congress, do not wish to
 alienate possible future Peron-
 ista support by banning the
 Peronista deputies.   Moreover,
 they consider these deputies
 no real threat because, despite
 electoral losses, the two par-
 ties will still outnumber the
 Peronistas after 1 May--the
 UCRI with 74 seats and the UCRP
 with 56.
 Differences over the Peron-
 ista question have delayed ac-
 tion in the lower house on the
 proposed amendments to the law
 on presidential succession
 which would permit President
 Guido to complete Frondizi's
 term and to postpone elections
 until late 1963.  The Senate,
 which passed the amendments
 by a 35 to 0 vote, could over-
 ride any Chamber modifications
 by a two-thirds  vote and pass
 the bill into law, according
 to UCRI Vice President Lebrero.
 Lebrero's expectation of Cham-
 ber approval after Easter is
 supported by a UCRI position
 paper whose nine points on
 necessary political steps would
 allow room for negotiating the
 compromise formula.  The pro-
 posals include the establish-
 ment of proportional represen-
 tation and measures against
 totalitarianism--laws which
 the armed forces have been de-
 manding.
 The Peronistas have in
 the past suggested a variation
 of the compromise formula.
 They requested federal inter-
 vention in all the provinces
 where elections were held on
 18 March, in order to make it
 appear that such action was not
 directed exclusively at the
 Peronistas.   In the meantime,
 however,  Peronista labor lead-
 ers have put their followers
 on alert for a general strike
 on 2 May.  The armed forces
 have already strengthened se-
 curity measures to deal with
 possible trouble.

 ETHIOPIA - SOMALI REPUBLIC
 Relations between Ethiopia
 and the Somali Republic, always
 strained because of religious,
 cultural, and tribal differences,
 have sunk to a dew low following
 several weeks of vitriolic propa-
 ganda broadcasts.   The rising
 tension has increased the like-
 lihood of fighting between
 Somali nomads and Ethiopian
 villagers which might be used
 by an Ethiopian troop commander
 as an occasion to strike at
 Somali targets across the border.
 Top government officials in
 both states appear to recognize
 the danger and to be trying to
 control forces in the border
 areas.
 The tension stems largely
 from the recent actions of
 Somali Premier Abdirascid.   Faced
 with a parliamentary crisis, the
 premier stirred up nationalist
 support by demanding the union
 of all ethnic Somalis with
 Mogadiscio--particularly those
 in Kenya and Ethiopia.   Having

 INEC   ii     law
 The deaths of four stu-
 dents following a clash on 12
 April with military police has
 led to a renewal of the polit-
 ical crisis that nearly forced
 President Ydigoras' resigna-
 tion during the antigovernment
 rioting in mid-March.   Some
 professional and labor groups
 and the opposition-controlled
 municipal council of Guatemala
 City have joined in the demand,
 issued by the three main anti-
 Communist opposition parties
 on 14 April, that Ydigoras re-
 sign.
 In an address broadcast
 late on 15 April Ydigoras re-
 jected the demand,  but his con-
 ciliatory tone and the conces-
 sions he offered suggest that
 he regards the present threat
 to his regime as more serious
 than last month's crisis.  He
 promised that he will soon
 change his cabinet to assure
 good government during the re-
 maining two years of his term,
 a promise which many Guatemalans
 will probably regard as tacit
 admission of the charges of
 corruption and ineptness which
 have, with considerable justi-
 fication, been leveled against
 his administration.
 Ydigoras also announced
 that he would postpone the visit
 to the United States he had
 planned for late this month
 and early May.   In another
 move possibly suggestive of
 his concern, Ydigoras sent his
 two children and their families
 out of the country on 16 April.
 The present antigovernment
 campaign is spearheaded by a
 loose alliance of the main op-
 position parties:  the moderate
 leftist and anti-Communist Revo-
 lutionary party, the small Chris-
 tian Democratic party, and the
 rightist National Liberation
 Movement.   Their tactics are
 based on the recognition that,
 in the final analysis, the
 armed forces will determine
 whether or not Ydigoras is
 forced to resign.   Opposition
 leaders now appear to believe--
 probably accurately--that the
 armed forces will not weaken
 in their support for the Pres-
 ident until and unless convinced
 that Ydigoras has lost popular
 support.
 However, if these leaders
 encourage radically inclined
 students to engage in further
 demonstrations which might
 spread and provide the military
 with the "proof" of Ydigoras'
 unpopularity, they take the
 chance of unleashing serious
 violence from which the Com-
 munists would benefit.  Com-
 munist and Communist-influenced
 groups are probably trying to
 gain the initiative from the
 anti-Communist parties in the
 antigovernment  struggle. While
 Communist and Communist-in-
 fluenced guerrilla activity has
 subsided since last month, it
 could be resumed at any time.

 The presidential election
 set for 29 April is the cul-
 mination of efforts by an army-
 backed reform group to give El
 Salvador a constitutional gov-
 ernment committed to social
 and economic improvement.   Re-
 forms are urgently needed in
 overpopulated El Salvador, where
 the gulf between rich and poor

 other Latin American country.
 free the election may be--are
 boycotting it on the grounds
 that it will be government
 rigged.
 The reform group,  now led
 by Col.  Julio Rivera, has been
 in power since January 1961,
 when junior army officers
 removed a Communist-influenced
 junta which, with the help of
 ex-President Oscar Osorio, had
 ousted President Lemus in Octo-
 ber 1960.  The Rivera group
 rapidly initiated reforms to
 benefit the peasants and to
 establish government control
 in the complex and powerful
 coffee company and Central
 Bank, both instruments of
 wealthy power.   It also created
 the powerful National Concilia-
 tion party  (PCN) and last De-
 cember held legislative elections
 considered the freest in Salva-
 doran history.                     The PCN candi-
 dates won all 54 seats in the
 assembly, which has revised the
 constitution and installed a
 provisional government.   The
 41-year-old Rivera now is the
 PCN presidential nominee.
 As election day approaches,
 the PCN's overwhelming popular-
 ity has become a liability.
 All the opposition parties--
 convinced that they have no
 chance against Rivera, however
 the
 US a         ac    believes Rivera
 retains strong support among the
 active military forces and the
 peasants, and it seems likely
 that he will take office as
 scheduled on 1 July for a five-
 year term.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 President Arosemena contin-
 ues                 ulider heavy pressure from
 both rightist military men and
 extreme leftists.
 Since December the leaders
 of the armed forces have threat-
 ened to depose Arosemena  unless
 he meets their demands--that he
 break with Cuba and that he ex-
 pel the "Communists" from the
 national government and some
 provincial offices.  They have
 not named specific individuals,
 but apparently include in their
 demand all leftists and even
 some nonleftist officials who
 press strongly for social re-
 forms.  Arosemena on 1 April
 discharged from his cabinet two
 non-Communist leftists as well
 as two conservatives who opposed
 the Alliance for Progress re-
 forms he is pushing.   Their re-
 placements in turn have fired
 a number of leftists, but many
 suspect subordinate officials
 remain in all ministries.
 The seventh congress of
 the Ecuadorean Communist party
 (PCE), early in March,  resolved
 to abandon "peaceful" political
 action and to prepare for "Castro-
 type" guerrilla warfare.   The
 abortive revolt of 5-6 April
 apparently was staged by the
 Communist-front Union of Revo-
 lutionary Youth  (URJE), which
 the PCE has in the past used as
 shock troops in street fighting.
 This rising appeared to be the
 result of URJE impatience rather
 than part of coordinated PCE
 plans, which call for simul-
 taneous outbreaks near several
 key rural crossroads.
 Leaders of both the PCE
 and the URJE disappeared from
 their headquarters in the major
 cities shortly after the an-
 nouncement of the diplomatic
 break with Cuba on 2 April.
 Most of them are still at large
 and have vowed to continue the
 struggle until the Arosemena
 government is replaced by a pro-
 Communist administration.
 Arosemena has prepared a
 comprehensive reform program
 for presentation to congress
 after the elections in June;
 meanwhile, he is pushing ahead
 with certain measures--such as
 the agrarian census--which can
 be accomplished by executive
 action.  However, guerrilla
 tactics by the PCE and URJE
 will. force the military leaders
 to take stronger measures for

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 KHRUSHCHEV AND THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP
 Khrushchev, who was 68
 years old this week, appears to
 be in generally fair health,
 but there are signs that advanc-
 ing age and the rigors of high
 office have begun to slow him
 down.
 The other leaders carry on
 quietly during Khrushchev's ex-
 tended absences from Moscow,
 and as yet there has not been
 any noticeable increase in polit-
 ical maneuvering within the party
 presidium in preparation for a
 succession crisis.   Khrushchev
 himself gives every indication
 of being in full command; spec-
 ulation that he is still involved
 in a fight to maintain his posi-
 tion seems to be unfounded.
 However, there probably continue
 to be disagreements within the
 hierarchy over such questions
 as the proportion of economic
 resources that should be devoted
 to consumer goods and the
 pace and extent of liberaliza-
 tion in the wake of renewed at-
 tacks against Stalin.
 When Khrushchev is away from
 the capital, party secretary
 Kozlov and Deputy Premier Kosygin
 seem to have the primary "care-
 taker" responsibilities for
 party and government affairs,
 respectively.   Kozlov, however,
 does not receive the preferential
 treatment that might be expected
 for someone who has been desig-
 nated first lieutenant and
 eventual successor.

 It is still unclear how
 some of the responsibilities
 at the top are being divided
 since the personnel shifts
 at the party congress in Octo-
 ber.   This is particularly
 true in the ideological and

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SOVIET ECONOMY IN FIRST QUARTER 1962
 Soviet industry continues
 to perform at a high tempo,with
 rates of increase little
 changed from a year ago, ac-
 cording to a TASS summary of
 the first quarter economic re-
 sults.   Industrial output re-
 portedly increased over 9 per-
 cent, well above the pace needed
 to achieve the objective of the
 Seven-Year Plan (1951-65).  The
 5-percent increase in industrial
 productivity, although still be-
 low both the planned rate for
 1962 and the Seven-Year Plan
 rate, marks some improvement
 over 1961.   Investment and con-
 struction data,  which during
 1961 indicated possible future
 difficulties for the economy,
 are not included in the first-
 quarter summaries.
 Of the major industrial
 sectors reported,  only the
 machine-building and metalwork-
 ing industry showed a drop in
 the rate of increase compared
 with a year ago.   The change,
 however, was slight, and the
 sector is advancing at a rate
 well above plan.
 Basic industrial commodi-
 ties cited continued the general
 trend.   Crude steel was the ex-
 ception.   Although the reported
 7.4-percent increase is approx-
 imately adequate in terms of the
 Seven-Year-Plan goal,  it is
 somewhat below the rate of in-
 crease planned for 1962.   While
 there is no reason to believe
 that the lag cannot be made up
 during the remainder of the
 year, the performance of the
 first three months does reflect
 difficulties which the industry
 faces in installing new facil-
 ities and modernizing existing
 plants.   Of 17 open-hearth fur-
 naces to be completed by the
 end of 1961,  only 13 were in
 operation by the first of this
 March.  Planning, technological,
 and equipment-manufacturing dif-
 ficulties will continue to ham-
 per expansion of the industry
 and achievement of the improved
 quality and variety of steel-
 mill. products desired by Soviet
 planners.
 Despite considerable atten-
 tion and effort on the part of
 the Soviet leadership to im-
 prove lagging agriculture--
 seconded in recently announced
 May Day slogans which label
 farming a "shock front" of "all
 the people"--there is nothing
 in the quarterly report which
 as yet suggests priority allo-
 cation of resources to agricul-
 ture.   Agricultural machinery
 was produced in the first quar-
 ter at a rate considerably short
 of the 1962 plan,  although grain-
 combine production, the only
 equipment item specified, was
 approximately on schedule.
 Production of "some 4 million
 tons" of chemical fertilizer
 constituted only modest prog-
 ress.   Eventually both machin-
 ery and fertilizer production
 will have to be increased much
 more rapidly if Khrushchev's
 new program for planting mil-
 lions of acres of beans, peas,
 and corn on land formerly cul-
 tivated in a grass-rotation
 program is to succeed.
 Indications of the future
 of consumer welfare were mixed,
 but in general there has been
 little beyond the slight upward
 trend of recent years.   Output
 of refrigerators and washing
 machines was approximately on
 schedule,; but production of con-
 sumer durables in general is
 still far from meeting demand.
 Cotton fabrics production did
 not increase at all over the

 reflecting the unwillingness of

 the shift of Soviet workers to

 A seeming  hopeful sign
 for the Soviet consumer was the

 1961 in meat production at state

 during the first quarter last
 year was particularly depressed--
 only 87 percent of production
 during the first quarter of 1960.
 However, there are indications--

 tal meat production in 1962
 should increase somewhat above      STAT
 the level at which it has re-
 mained for the past three years.

 tor.   Khrushchev's new crop
 program is intended to bring
 about a rapid improvement here,
 but its success will of course     25X1

 SOVIET BLOC OIL EXPORTS
 The Soviet bloc exported
 more than 30 million tons of
 crude oil and petroleum prod-
 ucts, valued at about $500,000,-
 000, to  nonbloc countries last
 year.  This quantity is a 25-
 percent increase over 1960.
 About 26 million tons--or 85
 percent--of the bloc's total
 1961 oil exports were supplied
 by the USSR, a share similar
 to that provided in 1960.   Ru-
 mania accounted for almost 3
 million tons.
 All the crude oil--more
 than half the total exports--
 originated in the USSR. Soviet
 crude exports in 1961 were 6
 million tons above those in
 1960, reflecting the more rapid
 growth of production relative
 to refining capacity.
 Exports by the bloc in 1961
 filled about 3 percent of total
 nonbloc demand for petroleum.
 More than two thirds of these
 exports went to Western Euro-
 pean countries, which as a group
 met about 9 percent of their
 consumption needs with bloc oil.
 Bloc: oil shipments to Africa,
 Asia, and Latin America are
 growing, largely as a result of
 extensive imports by Egypt,
 Japan, and Cuba.
 Italy imported over 6.6
 million tons of bloc petroleum,
 or about 23 percent of its to-
 tal domestic requirement; more
 than a million tons of this
 petroleum, however, was refined
 for eventual re-export to other
 countries.   Similarly, about

 countries.
 The USSR continues to stim-
 ulate oil sales through barter
 agreements with the developed
 countries.   With the industri-
 alized countries, the USSR ex-
 changes petroleum for capital
 goods.  The Soviet trade agree-
 ment with Italy,  for example,
 provides for the sale of pe-
 troleum in exchange for large-
 diameter pipe and pipeline
 equipment.
 Prices for Soviet petroleum
 are generally lower than world
 market prices.   In several in-
 stances, however,  the USSR,
 after it had gained a market
 in an area, began to raise
 prices to correspond more close-
 ly to existing market prices.
 Under 1962 contracts with im-
 porters in West Germany,  Bel-
 gium, and the Netherlands, the
 prices of gasoline, gas oil,
 and heavy heating fuel were
 about $2.00 a ton over those
 in ].961.   Similarly,  in recent
 negotiations with Swedish im-
 porters, Moscow indicated it
 planned to raise prices.
 Agreements with the chief
 nonbloc importers of Soviet oil
 suggest that bloc petroleum
 exports will rise again this
 year, possibly by as much as
 10 percent to a new peak of
 33 mullion tons.                         25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Ne Win's military regime,
 now in its second month, has
 moved to replace all elective
 bodies by appointed officials
 responsive directly to central
 government orders.   Parliament,
 the state governments,  and most
 municipal administrations have
 been dissolved,  and the inde-
 pendent Judiciary replaced by
 an appointed court whose tenure
 depends on government approval.
 Few national policies have yet
 been changed, but the government
 is emphasizing discipline,  ef-
 ficiency, and austerity--quali-
 ties notably lacking in Burma
 under civilian rule.
 The government itself has
 emerged as largely a one-man
 organization.   With the ex-
 ception of Brigadier Aung Gyi,
 Ne Win's second-in-command,  the
 subordinates in the Union Revo-
 lutionary Council (URC) are weak
 men lacking the willingness to
 challenge his decisions.   Ne
 Win is a narrow nationalist with
 a suspicious conspiratorial out-
 look,  a short temper,  and a
 tendency toward snap decisions.
 These factors give an unpredict-
 able quality to the course of
 future government policies. Ap-
 parently distrusting all foreign
 nongovernmental activities, Ne
 Win has ordered the Asia Founda-
 tion and the Ford Foundation to
 wind up their activities.
 The URC has invited the
 civilian political parties to
 rally to its support, but so
 far only the Communist-dominated
 National United Front has
 complied.  Other parties, fear-
 ful of being too closely identi-
 fied with unpopular authori-
 tarianism, apparently intend
 to remain silent until the
 regime has proven itself.
 In the economic field the
 government, aside from rescind-
 ing U Nu's unpopular order na-
 tionalizing the import trade
 and, by indirection, driving
 down food prices, has taken
 little action.   It is,  like
 all previous regimes in Burma,
 dedicated to the development
 of a socialist system in which
 the private sector is assured
 a role.
 For the future,  the chief
 danger to Western interests in
 Burma is that,  despite its
 pledge to a neutral foreign
 policy, the No Win regime may
 drift unintentionally toward
 closer association with the
 bloc.   Although its members are
 anti.-Communist and fear ulti-
 mate Chinese domination of
 Burma, they also admire Chinese
 discipline.   Moreover,  if their
 only civilian political support
 continues to come from the pro-
 Communist NUF,  they may recip-
 rocate by building it up as
 the country's national party.

 Ahti Karjalainen, 39-year-old
 foreign minister in the previous

 Kekkonen was overwhelmingly

 the January presidential and
 February parliamentary elections.
 He has, however, wanted a ma-
 jority government in order to
 demonstrate clearly--particu-
 larly to Moscow--that his pol-
 icy of good relations with the
 USSR is firmly supported in
 parliament as well as to make
 the cabinet less subject to

 SPECIAL ARTICLES
 With the cessation on 30
 March of scheduled Soviet mil-
 itary transport flights in the
 Berlin air corridors and Control
 Zone,  the USSR ended-- temporar-
 ily, at least--its latest chal-
 lenge to Western air access.
 Soviet use of the corridors,
 beginning on 8 February, was
 a carefully calculated probe
 of the West's determination to
 maintain the sole remaining
 means of access not subject to
 some degree of Communist con-
 trol.  Broadly speaking, the
 USSR was attempting to create
 a situation which would support
 Moscow's ultimate objective of
 changing the postwar status of
 Berlin and gaining at least de
 facto Western recognition of
 the East German regime.
 In seeking to alter the
 existing arrangements in the
 Berlin Air Safety Center (BASC)
 and flight procedures in the
 corridors, Moscow attempted to
 establish its?"right," osten-
 sibly by agreement with the
 East Germans, to use the air-
 ways to Berlin on a basis of
 complete equality with the West
 and to underline its contention
 that all access to the divided
 city is by Communist sufferance.
 In this way, the Soviets hoped
 to supersede the original pur-
 pose of the three  air corridors
 as channels for unrestricted
 Western access and to bring air
 access procedures more into
 line with those governing
 ground access.  The flights
 were staged in such a way as
 to make the corollary demands
 which the Soviet element in
 BASC was making for changes in
 traffic control procedures ap-
 pear reasonable or,   where
 necessary, to force Western
 acquiescence to those demands
 in the interest of "flight
 safety."
 Cautious Approach
 There is no evidence that
 Moscow intended to provoke a
 serious incident.   The flights
 took place during the midwinter
 lull in air passenger travel to
 Berlin, when the three Western
 commercial carriers which op-
 erate in the corridors--Pan Amer-

 BASC "reserved" for three and a
 half hours the following day all
 altitudes in the southern corri-

 flights were designed to mini-
 mize the risk of incidents. They
 were flown at altitudes below
 those favored by Western commer-
 cial carriers, or according to
 "flight plans" filed in BASC by
 the Soviets far enough in advance
 to pre-empt use of certain alti-
 tudes normally used by commer-

 When conflicts in schedul-

 their willingness to guarantee

 the corridors, tended to lessen
 the likelihood of collisions
 between the Soviet transports
 and the faster moving Western
 civil and military aircraft.
 At all timesthe Soviet con-
 trollers in BASC maintained
 telephone contact with their
 headquarters at Karlshorst and
 presumably arranged to exchange
 pertinent flight information
 with the East German traffic
 control center at Schoenefeld
 airfield south of Berlin.
 Later, however, the Soviets
 did seek to monopolize the area
 in which they flew by spacing a
 relatively few low-performance
 transport aircraft at altitudes
 and times which could have posed
 a hazard to Western flights
 between 7,000 and 10,000 feet.
 Flight Patterns
 There seems to have been
 little day-to-day consistency
 to Soviet flights, although
 generally the Soviets seem to
 have flown under optimum weather
 conditions, when visual flight
 rules were in effect; on at least
 two days, unfavorable weather
 probably contributed to cancel-
 lation of their flights at the
 last moment.  They flew four
 transports in the northern cor-
 ridor during the hours of dark-
 ness for the first time on 16
 March, scheduled evening flights
 only twice after that, and
 canceled such flights on 30
 March.
 Training flights by Soviet
 tactical bombers, fighters, and
 transports near and across the
 Berlin air corridors above and
 below the altitudes normally used
 by Western planes are routine.
 Before 8 February, however, Soviet
 flights through the corridors--
 even at those lower altitudes
 which are used rarely and only
 as a matter of convenience by
 Western flights--had not been
 noted for several years.  During
 the period 8-20 February, the
 Soviets seven times "reserved"
 all altitudes up to 7,000 feet
 in the central corridor and
 7,500 feet in the northern cor-
 ridor, and the Soviet control-
 lers at BASC refused to provide
 the Western controllers with
 detailed information on specific
 flights.   It is not clear how
 many transports or other Soviet
 aircraft were active in the
 corridors during this period,
 although there is evidence
 that transports did fly on at
 least two occasions.
 At the same time, non-
 hostile identification passes
 by Soviet fighters against
 Western aircraft--noted occa-
 sionally in the past--increased
 markedly, becoming particularly
 aggressive on 15 February when
 Western pilots reported "near
 misses" and a Soviet fighter
 signaled an Allied transport
 to land in East Germany.
 Late on 15 February, the
 ch:Lef Soviet controller in BASC
 demanded that henceforth all
 civil flight plans be filed 24
 hours in advance and include
 estimated times for crossing
 the East - West German inter-
 zonal border, and that Western
 planes not deviate from the al-
 titudes submitted in their flight
 plans.  To underline these
 demands, which implied that
 Western flights were subject
 to Soviet and/or East German
 authorization, the Soviet BASC
 controllers began that evening
 to refuse to initial southern-
 corridor flight plans which did
 not contain estimated border
 crossing times.  This refusal
 still applies to this corridor,
 for which the US BASC controllers
 area responsible.
 On 16 February, the Soviets,
 perhaps uncertain as to what
 the Western response to their
 new demands would be and mind-
 ful that further "near misses"
 in the corridors could lead to a
 serious incident or the use of
 armed escorts for Western com-
 mericial flights, canceled their
 "reservations" for the day with
 the comment that they had com-
 pleted that phase of their oper-
 ations in the corridors.
 The following day, the So-
 viet Foreign Ministry responded
 to 'Western protests over the
 corridor flights by asserting that

 the corridors.   The note main-
 tained that Soviet corridor
 flights were provided for by
 bilateral Soviet - East German
 agreements and not governed by
 the rules of the Berlin Air
 Safety Center.  The note im-
 plied that the Soviets partic-
 ipated in BASC only as a means
 of preserving flight safety,
 and it seemed to raise the pos-
 sibility that they would with-
 draw from the center if the
 Allies failed to meet their
 demands.
 New Phase
 Soviet corridor operations
 entered a second phase on 19
 February, when the Soviet con-
 trollers in BASC supplied
 "flight information" or "plans"
 for transport flights to take
 place the next day.    Since
 there were no legal grounds
 for V+restern objection to So-
 viet flights for which "plans"
 were filed, the next step was
 for the Soviets to increase
 gradually the number and ex-
 tent of their corridor opera-
 tions to the point where they
 were again pre-emptin  whole
 blocks of airspace.
 Flight Statistics
 The Soviets filed "plans"
 for and carried out military
 transport flights in one or
 more of the three corridors
 for several hours a day on
 27 occasions in six weeks.
 However, it was not until
 12 March, when the Soviets sent
 four transports through the
 southern corridor, that they
 operated in the altitudes re-
 served by usage to Western
 commercial flights, Subsequently
 they flew as many as six trans-
 ports at a time at altitudes
 above 7,000 feet on six days.
