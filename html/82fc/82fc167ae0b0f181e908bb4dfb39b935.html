East Germany: 
Communist party public opinion surveys show open criticism 
among the populace, particularly workers, of Khrushchev's 
use of the U-2 incident to wreck the summit conference. The 
surveys suggest widespread concern among East Germans 
over the breakdown of negotiations, even among intellectuals 
who publicly endorsed Khrushchev's stand. The whole party 
apparatus was mobilized to turn out a mass welcome for 
Ithrushchev in East Berlin and to propagandize his remarks 
throughout the country. (Page 2)

military aid to the Algerians. The leader of the rebel del-
egation, on his departure from Peiping on 20 May, however, 
expressed his thanks for China's "material sifrifices" on 
behalf of the Algerians,  
the 
rebel delegation, which has been touring the Far East, did 
not request Chinese volunteers for Algerian fighting and was 
reluctant to agree to Chinese demands to denounce the US openly 
and to publicly oppose the US-Japanese security treaty. 
 Algerian reluctance on the security treaty 
was overcome. 
IL ASIA-AFRICA 
India-USSR: New :Delhi has announced plans to construct 
two additional government-owned oil refineries during the 
Third Five-Year Plan (1961-66). These would presumably 
be in addition to a previously announced medium-size refin-
ery slated for the Bombay region. The scheduled visits to 
Moscow next month by President Prasad, Finance Minister 
Desai, and Mines and Oil Minister Malaviya are likely to re-
sult in additional assistance to the Indian petroleum industry, 
including an offer to construct the two new refineries. The 
bloc is  already assisting the construction of two other refin-
eries. (Page 4) 
Japan.: Prime Minister Kishi is being attacked by most 
of the press and by leftists for alleged undemocratic and un-
parliamentary methods in securing lower-house approval of 
the US-Japan security treaty. The vote on 20 May, which 
overrode Socialist violence and a boycott, appears to assure 
final ratification by upper-house action prior to President 
Eisenhower's visit on 19 June. More leftist-sponsored dem-
onstrations can be expected, and the two Socialist parties 
have said they will continue to boycott the Diet. Kishi's con-
trol of his party will depend on the extent and depth of adverse 
public reaction, which his party rivals will be alert to exploit.

Cuba: The Castro government on 18 May ordered that each 
refinery in Cuba for the rest of this year must purchase approx-
imately 300,000 tons of Soviet crude oil, now arriving under the 
Cuban-Soviet trade agreement. This affects three large refin-
eries--Esso, Texaco, and Shell--which produce about 95 per-
cent of Cuba's refined petroleum products. Cuban controls on 
US dollar remittances have been tying up the funds of the oil 
companies, and the Castro regime is using this form of pres-
sure to make the companies purchase the Soviet crude for re-
fining. Relations between the Castro regime and the government 
of Venezuela�Cuba's chief source of petroleum--are likely to be 
further alienated by Cuban purchase of competitive Soviet oil.

LATE ITEMS 
A*USSR: The main purpose of Khrushchev's speech in East 
Berlin on 20 May probably was to provide assurances that 
despite the collapse of the summit conference and his clear 
intention to maintain harsh attacks on the United States, the 
USSR:does not plan to abandon its peaceful coexistence line or 
revert to a hard, "Stalinist" posture toward the non-Commu-
nist world. Khrushchev appears anxious to demonstrate that 
his detente policy continues to be valid and justified. Although 
&' the Soviet premier claimed that the breakdown of the Paris 
0 meeting has given the Soviet Union and its allies a "moral right" 
Jr to proceed without further delay with a separate peace treaty 
with East Germany, he stated that the "status quo" with regard 
rr to a German treaty and West Berlin will be maintained until 
another heads-of-government meeting takes place, which he 
"assumes" will be in six to eight months. Khrushchev's rela-
tively moderate line in this speech will displease any critics in 
the Communist world who had opposed his peaceful coexistence 
diplomacy and had interpreted his performance in Paris  as fore-
shadowing abandonment of this line.  'Page 8) 
*Air incident in East Germany: On 20 May, a USAF C-47 
transport en route from Copenhagen to Hamburg with nine per-
sons aboard apparently was forced to land about 15 nautical 
miles northwest of Wismar in the extreme northwest corner of 
East Germany at approximately 1205Z. 
it was forced down by Soviet fighters. No 
fighter activity, however, was noted at that time 
although some Western radar reflections sug-
gest such activity. The transport was tracked for some 25 min-
utes by Soviet radars. No information, including weather condi-
tions, explains why the aircraft had deviated from its intended 
course, the aircraft was 
undamaged and the personnel were turned over to the Soviet com-
mandant in the area.

Peiping Vindicates Its Interpretation of US Motives  
Despite Peiping's major demonstrations of "firm support" 
for the Soviet Union following the summit conference, the Chi-
nese are taking advantage of the conference breakdown to vin-
dicate their views against accommodation with the West. A 
People's Daily editorial of 20 May states that the outcome of 
the conference was no surprise to those who view the interna-
tional situation correctly and are not misled by "certain super-
ficial phenomena." 
The Chinese had maintained all along that there had been 
no real change in the American attitude toward the Communist 
world and that the principal task of the bloc was therefore to 
expose the false nature of American peace gestures. A few days 
before the summit meeting was to convene, Mao Tse-tung had 
implicitly criticized Khrushchev for having "illusions" about 
"US imperialism." 
The 20 May editorial contains some indications that the Chi-
nese may fear that Khrushchev will not maintain, in the long run, 
his present uncompromising attitude toward the West. In this 
connection, the editorial assesses the summit breakdown as 
"helpful" because it "laid bare" the "ferocious" features of "US 
imperialism" and calls, as did the Chinese in the pre-summit 
period, for further exposure of the United States. 
By emphasizing that the Chinese were right and Ithrushchev 
wrong, the editorial suggests the Chinese probably hope to use 
present developments to increase their influence throughout the 
Communist world as the most accurate interpreters of Marxist-
Leninist theory. 
That Moscow now is on the defensive can be seen in Soviet 
Ambassador Chervonenk:o's speech at a rally in Peiping on 20 May. 
"Like other people," he said, "the Soviet people have never de-
ceived themselves with illusions and have always remembered 
the imperialist intrigues." On the contrary, People's Daily  said 
on the same day, events of the past few days prove misguided 
those who had naively thought that imnerialism eculd be dealt with.

�StEeRET 
East German Workers Criticize Khrushchev's Moves to  
Wreck Summit Meeting 
Crash public opinion surveys made by Socialist Unity 
(Communist) party (SED) officials in East Germany from 17 
to 19 May reveal open criticism among the people�par-
ticularly workers--of Khrushchev's 11qP nf the 11-2 inrident 
to wreck the summit meeting.  
 East Germans are greatly concerned 
over developments in Paris and in some cases have public-
ly contrasted with Khrushchev's disruptive moves the attempts 
Of Western leaders to continue the negotiations. 
� SED headquarters in Potsdam District reported that work-
ers in many factories were expressing "indefinite" and "nega-
tive" views, such as: "The airplane should have been the last 
item on the agenda instead of the first"; "Khrushchev shouldn't 
play the spoil sport"; "Everyone must compromise"; and "The 
summit conference needn't be shattered because of this, there-
by killing the hopes of the people." In two cases party members 
had expressed such opinions. 
Similarly, Magdeburg officials reported on 17 May that 
workers in one factory accused Khrushchev of using "sledge-
hammer tactics." Even among intellectuals who have pub-
licly supported Khrushchev's moves, there is obvious concern 
over the breakdown of negotiations. For example, students 
at RostockUniversity said!' "If the summit conference had tak-
en place, at least something would have resulted for Germany." 
The regime's propaganda apparatus has been put into full 
swing to counteract such opinions and give maximum coverage 
for Khrushchev's statements in East Berlin. It is nevertheless 
probable that the already low morale of the East German pop-
ulace has dropped further as a result of the developments in 
Paris. Many East Germans will probably fear that access to 
West Berlin may soon be barred by the regime and attempt to 
flee now. The flow of refugees to West Berlin has already

reached proportions of the 1.958 mass flights as a result of last 
winter's collectivization drive, despite the regime's urgent ef-
forts to stop them. In the week ending 17 May, 3,883 refugees 
reached the city--an increase of 550 above the preceding week 
and more than 2,000 above the comparable week last year. Since 
the East-West German border is practically sealed as a result 
of heightened security precautions, nearly all East German refu-
gees now are using the West Berlin escape hatch.

IL ASIA-AFRICA 
Planned New Indian Refineries May Receive Soviet Assistance  
New Delhi has announced its intention to construct two 
additional oil refineries during the Third Five-Year Plan 
(1961-66). The location and the financing arrangements for 
these new government-owned projects were not made public. 
They would presumably be in addition to a medium-size re-
finery in the Cambay region near Bombay for which plans 
were announced in April. Promising oil strikes were recent-
ly, made in that area by bloc technicians under contract to the 
Indian Government. 
Scheduled visits to Moscow in June by three Indian dele-
gations led by President Prasad, Finance Minister Desai, 
and particularly IC D. Malaviya, Indian minister for mines 
and oil, will afford the Soviet Union an opportunity to expand 
its dominant position in India's oil industry by making further 
offers of assistance. Moscow is likely to offer to aid in the 
construction of the two new refineries and may also propose 
further Indo-Soviet collaboration in the petroleum industry. 
India will receive some Soviet-refined POL products this 
year under terms of the current Indo- Soviet trade agreement. 
Moreover, Moscow has recently offered "unlimited" quanti-
ties of crude oil, at discount and for rupee payment- a pro-
posal which the Indians will be able fully to utilize only when 
they possess their own refineries. In addition, the USSR and 
Rumania are assisting the Indians in construction of two other 
refineries in eastern India for processing Indian crude oil; 
aid thus far committed to these projects amounts to $40,000,-
000, about 5 percent of total bloc aid to India.

Japanese Reaction to Security Treaty Vote  
Most major Japanese newspapers are accusing Prime Min-
ister Kishi of violating democratic and parliamentary principles 
in forcing lower-house approval of the US-Japanese security 
treaty on 20 May. One paper, however, stressed Japan's need 
for such a treaty under present world conditions, and another 
paper criticized the opposition Socialists for their resort to vio-
lence prior to the vote. 
The two Socialist parties are claiming that passage of the 
treaty was illegal and invalid and are now boycotting the Diet 
session. The governing pberal Democrats, although they have 
enough seats to conduct parliamentary business without the So-
cialists, are almost certain to undertake negotiations with them 
in an effort to end the boycott and return to normal procedures. 
A demonstration led by extreme leftist students broke out 
In the vicinity of the Diet soon after the treaty vote, and some 
students forced entry into the grounds of Kishi's official resi-
dence. More leftist-sponsored demonstrations can be expected, 
although previous extremist efforts have failed to attract popu-
lar support. 
The lower-house vote appears to assure final ratification of 
the security pact before President Eisenhower's visit on 19 June. 
The treaty has been referred to the upper house and, even if this 
body fails to vote, approval will be automatic after 30 days. A 
50-day extension of the Diet session assures the necessary time 
period. 
Some Japanese political observers believe that Kishi's chances 
� 
for winning a third term as president of the government party in 
January 1961 have been weakened by the steps taken to obtain ap-
proval of the treaty. They note that several of his party rivals, 
including Ichiro Kono, absented themselves during the vote. While 
Kishi's rivals will be alert to exploit any adverse public reaction, 
his control of the party will depend on th7 extent and depth of such 
popular sentiment.

Struggle for Power Within Saudi Royal Family 
Crown Prince Faysal is expected to leave very soon for 
at least six weeks of medical treatment in Europe, and King 
Saud has taken the first step in his plan to regain  omination 
over the government, he refused 
to accept Faysal's suggestions 'or interim appointments to 
supervise government affairs. The crown prince responded, 
1py reiterating his recom-
menaations in tne iorm iDI a virtual ultimatum to the King. This 
names, as acting prime minister, Prince Musaid Ibn Abd al-
Rahman, who served in that capacity during Faysal's absence 
in Europe from October to December last year, and as presid-
ing officer over the Council of Ministers, Prince Fand Ibn Abd 
al-Aziz, minister of education, who headed the Saudi delega-
tion to recent Arab League meetings. 
The next move is up to King Saud. His personal advisers, 
some of whom are corrupt holdovers from Saud's bungling and 
extravagant rule from 1953 to 1958, are urging him to press for 
a complete showdown. If he does, the outcome is likely to be 
determined by the attitudes of ten or twelve influential senior 
princes. While this group was responsible for easing the King 
out of power in favor of Faysal in March 1958, several of its 
members reportedly have since become unenthusiastic about 
supporting the crown prince. 
The quarrel within the royal family has become so serious 
as to reduce political stability. The way might be opened to or-
ganized plotting by antiroyalist groups not only in the bureaucracy 
and merchant class but also in the army, where disaffection is re-
ported spreading.

III. THE WEST 
American Refineries in Cuba Ordered to Process Soviet 
Crude  Oil 
On 18 May, the Castro regime notified officials of the 
Texaco refinery in Cuba that for the rest of this year each 
refinery in the country must accept approximately 300,000 
tons of Soviet crude al, which has begun to arrive in Cuba 
under the Cuban-Soviet trade agreement signed in February. 
This will affect the three refineries--Texaco, Esso, and 
Shell--which together produce over 95 percent of the petro-
leum products refined in Cuba. These companies have some 
$40,000,000 worth of outstanding requests for dollar remit-
tances which the Cuban National Bank has not yet approved. 
Cuban controls on US dollar remittances have been tying up 
the funds of the refineries, and the Castro regime evidently 
is using this form of pressure in an effort to make the com-
panies accept Soviet crude. Soviet crude is received by 
Cuba under a barter arrangement, and the refineries would 
not be required to pay for it in foreign exchange. 
Official Venezuelan relations with the Castro government, 
which have grown increasingly cool in recent weeks, are like-
ly to be further alienated by Cuban purchases of competitive 
Soviet oil. In 1958, Venezuela exported about 75,000 barrels 
a day of oil and refined products to Cuba, about 8 percent of 
which presumably will now be supplied by the USSR. In a 
front-page editorial, one prominent anti-Castro Venezuelan 
newspaper recently condemned the Soviet-Cuban oil arrange-
ments. Venezuela is also facing a potential loss to the USSR 
of a portion of its market for petroleum in two other Latin 
American nations--Uruguay and Brazil.

SECRET-
LATE ITEM 
Khrushchev's Speech in East Berlin  
IChrushchev used his speech in East Berlin on 20 May as the 
occasion for his first major foreign policy statement since the 
collapse of the summit meeting. His main purpose probably was 
to provide assurances that he does not intend to abandon his peace-
ful coexistence line or revert to a hard, "Stalinist" posture toward 
the non-Communist world. 
Despite his clear intention to mount on all-out propaganda 
campaign to discredit and isolate the United States on the issue 
of "aggressive and provocative actions" toward the USSR, IChru-
shchev apparently hopes to salvage as much of his detente policy 
as possible. He stated that he assumes that another heads-of-
government meeting will take place in six to eight months, and 
declared ublicly what Foreign Minister Gromyko had pledged 
n 17 May to :British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd-z) 
that the USSR will do nothing in the interim that might "aggravate 
the international situation and take us back to the dark time of the 
cold war." 
On the key issue of Berlin, IChrushchev said he had reached 
agreement with East German leaders that, since a summit meet-
ing will be held in six to eight months, no unilateral moves would 
be taken until a further effort can be made to reach agreement with 
the three Western powers on a peace treaty with the two German 
states. Although he claimed that the breakdown of the Paris meet-
ing has given the USSR and its allies a "moral right" to proceed 
without further delay with a separate treaty with East Germany, he 
pledged that the status quo will be maintained until a summit meet-
ing convenes. This commitment, however, was made conditional 
on the Western powers' willingness to avoid "any unilateral steps" 
which would prevent such a meeting in six to eight months. 
� The line Khrushchev took in this speech suggests that he feels 
under the necessity of demonstrating that his detente policy in re-
cent months was right and justified and is still valid. He recalled 
that after returning from his visit to the United States he had pointed

out that President Eisenhower was in a "difficult position" as a 
result of a "hidden" struggle in the United States between the 
"forces of the cold war" and the "advocates of peaceful coexist-
ence." He observed that he had recognized such "alarm signals" 
long before the summit meeting and implied that the U-2 incident 
resulted from the victory of the "cold war forces:'
