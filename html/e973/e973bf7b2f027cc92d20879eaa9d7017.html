MEMORANDUM 
Central Intelligence Agency 
National Foreign Assessment Center 
28 October 1981 
China's International Economic Relations  
In the five years since the death of Mao Zedong China's new 
leaders have moved the country unrelentingly towards greater 
participation in the world's economy. Beijing has dropped its 
ideological aversion to foreign debt, has encouraged foreign 
investment in the domestic economy, established diplomatic 
relations with the United States, joined the International 
Monetary Fund and World Bank, decentralized its trade 
organizations to promote direct foreign contacts at the 
enterprise level, and sent thousands of students abroad for a 
Western education. 
Dealing With Deficits  
In this improved atmosphere China's foreign trade has grown 
rapidly. Since 1977, China has maintained an average annual 
growth rate of nearly 35 percent for exports. This was done by 
diverting marginal amounts of output away from domestic 
consumption and by penetrating established Western markets 
through competitive pricing policies (see Figure 1). In real 
terms exports have increased 20 to 25 percent annually over the 
same period. Despite the rapid increase in trade, China's 
exports still amount to only a small fraction of domestic output 
or of world trade. 
In general, Chinese imports have increased concomitantly 
(see Figure 2). On two occasions, however, the Chinese have 
incurred significant trade deficits--during the winters of 1978-
79 and 1980-81 (see Figure 3). Each time, the Chinese turned to 
foreign sources for balance of payments support. 
China's trade balance, which had been running in surplus 
though the first 3 quarters of 1978, turned into a $400 million 
deficit in the fourth quarter (measured on an f.o.b. basis), then 
plunged to a $700 million deficit in the first quarter of 1979--
the largest quarterly deficit the Chinese had ever experienced.

In addition, the Chinese had contracted to make downpayments of 
approximately $600 million for plants ordered in the second half 
of 1978. Downpayments on the $7 billion in contracts had left 
Beijing dangerously low on foreign exchange. Reserves had fallen 
to about $1.5 billion by the beginning of 1979. 
In early 1979, the Chinese arranged commercial credit lines 
amounting to nearly $10 billion, mostly-with Japanese banks. 
Moreover, in anticipation of making major capital purchases, the 
Chinese had amassed by mid-1979 over $17 billion worth of pledges 
for officially-supported export credits from France ($7.3 
billion), the United Kingdom ($5 billion), Japan ($1.8 billion), 
Canada ($1.7 billion) and Italy ($1.0 billion), with smaller 
amounts from Belgium, Sweden, and Australia. Ironically, the 
Chinese have not used most of these credits. Between May and 
August 1979, LIBOR rates jumped from 10 1/2 percent to 17 
percent, making these funds too expensive for the fiscally 
conservative Chinese. Moreover, the readjustment of the economy 
dictated a massive cutback in capital expenditures, leaving 
little need for these loans. 
China's balance of payments position improved dramatically 
over the next year as a result of excellent export growth. In 
fourth quarter 1980, however, a surge in imports resulted in 
another bout of trade deficits. In November China drew its 
reserve tranche of $280 million from the International Monetary 
Fund, the first drawing since China's entrance into the IMF in 
May 1980. The trade imbalance continued into the first quarter 
of 1981, and by the end of March Beijing had withdrawn a total of 
$1.1 billion, exhausting its first credit tranche at the IMF. 
China also drew heavily on short-term foreign commercial loans 
during this period. By yearend 1980, total debt outstanding may 
have surpassed the $3.4 billion mark  predicted by the Chinese in 
September 1980. 
Plant Contracts--Killed then Revived  
Reacting to a rapidly deteriorating foreign exchange 
situation as well as to a general rethinking of China's 
development strategy, in February 1979 the Ministry of Finance 
sent notice to 20 Japanese firms that contracts they had signed 
with China's National Technical Import Corporation had failed to 
obtain Bank of China approval. As a result, the contracts--
valued at $2.6 billion--were suspended while China reexamined the 
projects and the financial commitments associated with them. 
Although the contracts were reinstated immediately after 
commercial Japanese banks put together a long-promised financial 
package, the Chinese never utilized any of these funds but 
continued to accept delivery of the equipment on a cash payment 
basis. 
Unlike the plant contract suspensions of February 1979, the 
Chinese decision to cancel nearly $2.0 billion worth of contracts

complexes in February 1981 probably was motivated more by 
internal economic considerations than by external financial 
constraints. Domestic investment was badly overextended, partly 
because of the local expenditures needed to construct plants 
purchased overseas. Moreover, it had become apparent that energy 
supplies for the plants would not be available. As in 1979, the 
Chinese told the Japanese that in order to complete the plant 
deals China would need low interest loans. Unlike the earlier 
loans, however, part of the new financing request was to cover 
the local costs of the projects. In effect, the Chinese wanted 
to finance their domestic budget deficits with foreign loans.  
If the plant cancellations were precipitated by perceived 
balance of payments problems, the Chinese reaction was too 
draconian. China's hard-currency reserves were adequate, with 
earnings more than sufficient to make scheduled payments for the 
plants. By the Bank of China's own account, China's foreign 
exchange reserves jumped from $2.5 billion at the end of March to 
$3.8 billion at the end of June. Even after canceling the 
plants, the Chinese continued to accept delivery of equipment, 
paying for each shipment in cash. As a result of excellent 
export growth and a cutback in agricultural imports, China's 
trade balance improved dramatically in second quarter 1981--from 
a $400 million first-quarter deficit to a $1 billion hard-
currency surplus. 
New Directions in Trade Policy  
Traditionally, Chinese exports have been spread over a wide 
range of commodities and markets. Adverse foreign economic 
situations would have minimal impact on China's domestic economic 
plans, because exports of any one commodity accounted  for only a 
small portion of domestic production. 
In 1970 agricultural commodities accounted for more than 
half of China's exports. This proportion fell steadily during 
the decade, and in 1979, less than one-third of total earnings 
came from the agricultural sector (see Figure 4.) China became a

net oil exporter for 
the first time in 1973, and 
by 1979 
extractive exports accounted for nearly 15 percent of total 
revenues. Exports of manufactures--led by textiles, clothing, 
and footwear--have made the greatest gains and now account for 
over half of export revenues. Despite these shifts, China is 
still a net exporter of agricultural goods and 
a net importer of 
manufactures. 
25X1 
Fundamental Chinese attitudes have been changing with 
respect to the role of trade in a planned economy.. Exports no 
Longer are seen purely as a means of paying for imports; they 
also have become a leading force for upgrading China's domestic 
industry. By prodding sleepy domestic industries to compete for 
foreign exchange in Western markets, ?the leadership is attempting 
to improve the quality of goods produced for the domestic market 
as well. The Chinese now recognize that in order to maximize 
their gains from trade, they must specialize along lines of 
comparative advantage in labor-intensive industries. It is no 
longer enough to export domestic surpluses. By diverting 
investment funds from heavy to light industry the Chinese expect 
to reap a larger return on investment, and in much less time. 
Beijing's attitude with respect to the role of imports also 
is changing. Until the policy of "readjustment" was announced in 
December 1978, imports basically were used to overcome 
bottlenecks in the domestic economy and were concentrated in 
industrial supplies and other goods that were critical to the 
needs of the state (see Figure 4). Beijing followed a policy of 
import substitution: Imports of capital goods were aimed at 
eventually eliminating the need for imports of fertilizer, 
chemicals, steel, and nonferrous metals. Under the 
"readjustment" policy, import priorities have shifted toward 
satisfyin! the needs of the people and towards expanding export 
earnings. 
In 1980 China's readjustment policies began to have a major 
impact on the commodity composition of imports, and hence, on the 
direction of trade. Deliveries of complete industrial plants 
continued at a high pace. New orders, however, fell sharply. 
Steel imports also declined. On the other hand, Beijing's 
emphasis on improving the Chinese standard of living, boosting 
export earnings, and channeling investment funds into light 
industry has led to much larger imports of cotton and synthetic 
fibers, fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides, plastics and 
paper products,  as well as increased purchases of grain and 
consumer goods. 
The net result of these changes has been a shift in the 
direction of Chinese purchases (see Figure 5). The United States 
and Hong Kong have been the major beneficiaries, whereas West 
European countries have lost the most. Japan, by virtue of its 
close geographic and cultural proximity as well as its greater 
experience and flexibility in trading with China, so far appears 
to have broken even: Japan's dominant share of China's trade has

Multilateral Ties  
China has substantially expanded its involvement with 
international economic institutions during the past two years. 
Since joining the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World 
Bank in April and May of 1980 respectively, China has tapped both 
organizations as part of its effort to obtain as much subsidized, 
long-term, low-interest money as is available. In June, Beijing 
received a conditional commitment for its first World Bank loan--
$200 million to upgrade its technical education system. Since 
last November, China has made $1.1 billion in drawings from the 
IMF. In a significant departure from its past policy of self-
reliance, in December of 1980 Beijing made its first request for 
international disaster relief assistance through the United 
Nations. A United Nations team that visited the flooded areas of 
Hubei province and the drought-stricken portions of Hebei 
province recommended that China receive approximately $700 
million worth of food, seed, and reclamation aid. However, given 
the meager international response?amounting to less than 2 
percent of the requested funds--and leadership sensitivities 
toward the subject, Beijing may think twice before seeking such 
aid again. Claiming lack of familiarity with the benefits of 
membership, Beijing is still reluctant to join the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). To rectify this situation 
Chinese representatives have attended several GATT meetings and 
have enrolled an official in 'a four-month GATT training course. 
According to one senior Chinese diplomat, China probably will not 
make a decision on GATT membership before late 1982. 
Foreign Investment 25X1 
China remains committed to the policy of opening its economy 
to foreign investment and is currently taking steps to make the 
terms more precise and attractive so as to ease investor 
uncertainty. The equity joint venture program offers China an 
opportunity to obtain considerable foreign technological and 
management expertise without the financial risk associated with 
debt financing. Still, after two years, the program has failed 
to attract many investors, primarily because of Beijing's 
slowness in developing a legal framework. To date, only 23 
equity joint ventures with a total capital value of about $200 
million have been established within China. Many of these are 
with Hong Kong Chinese businessmen. Beijing is still formulating 
detailed regulations to supplement the original 1979 joint 
venture law which most investors considered to be too vague. 
Beijing expects to promulgate these new regulations by the end of 
1981. China also plans to offer over 100 potential joint 
ventures for detailed negotiation with foreign investors at a 
1982 conference to be co-sponsored by the United Nations.

China has established four special economic zones located in 
Fujian Province and near Hong Kong and Macao in Guangdong. 
Beijing offers foreign investors the opportunity to set up joint 
ventures or even wholly foreign-owned and foreign-managed 
enterprises within the zones at concessional land, labor, and tax 
rates. As in other parts of China, compensation trade has become 
an important form of commerce in the zones. Under compensation 
trade, foreign investors typically provide China with a 
combination of equipment, technology, or raw materials. In turn, 
the Chinese either return the finished product to the foreign 
partner after processing or compensate the supplier with either 
cash or barter goods. At present, insufficient infrastructure 
development has combined with problems in labor productivity to 
cause Beijing to take steps to stimulate investor interest in the 
zones. In July, a State Council-sponsored conference on the 
zones proposed the relaxation of visa and duty regulations as 
well as greater investor control over labor matters. Premier 
Zhao Ziyang underscored Beijing's committment to solving the 
zone's problems by making a three-day  inspection tour in August 
to two of the zones. 
Although the new regulations governing equity joint ventures 
and the special economic zones probably will help clarify several 
legal questions, the success of both programs remains somewhat in 
doubt. Even with a more rational legal and commercial structure, 
Beijing must still overcome its inexperience and develop such 
intangibles as credibility and dependability in its relationships 
with foreign entreoeneurs before foreign investment programs will 
mushroom.

MEMORANDUM 
China's Political and Economic Leadership  
In classic Leninist fashion, the Chinese Communist Party 
makes fundamental policy decisions and oversees their 
implementation, whereas the government is charged with carrying 
them out. All authority rests ultimately with the party, and in 
practice senior government officials usuallu hold ranking 
positions in the party as well. 
The ultimate decisionmaking authority rests in the 
Politburo--a body of 24 who meet periodically to discuss issues 
of major importance--and within that body, in the Standing 
Committee, composed of Party Chairman Hu Yaobang and the six vice 
chairmen. Since February 1980, the Politburo has been less 
active, however, and much of its authority has devolved to the 
party Secretariat. The Secretariat, staffed by younger and abler 
men--each of whom is responsible for a particular functional 
area--handles the day-to-day affairs of the Chinese Communist 
Party, making policy recommendations and launching major 
initiatives in problem areas. The Secretariat is formally 
chaired by Hu, but Xi Zhongxun may now be in charge of day-to-day 
matters. 
Associated with the Politburo and the Secretariat are a 
number of research institutes under the Chinese Academies of 
Science (CAS) and Social Sciences (CASS). Although they are 
formally governmental rather than party organs, the CAS and CASS 
conduct basic research on important political and economic 
problems, draft position papers and speeches for senior party 
leaders, and oversee advanced training in the sciences and social

sciences. For particularly sensitive issues, such as the party 
assessment of Mao's place in history or when special expertise is 
required, the CAS or CASS convene ad hoc committees. 
The locus of authority in the government is the State 
Council, headed by Premier Zhao Ziyang and 11 vice-premiers; with 
three exceptions all are concurrently members of the Politburo or 
the Secretariat (see chart). State Council members collectively 
preside over 38 ministries as well as 62 offices, special 
agencies, and commissions that cut across ministerial lines. 
Each State Council member heads one or more of the agencies 
directly subordinate to the council. 
China's senior leaders are united in their rejection of the 
radicalism of the Cultural Revolution and in general favor social 
and institutional reform as well as the opening to the West. 
They differ, however, over the means of attaining these 
objectives. The majority put greater emphasis on the creation of 
a more open society, development of a vigorous if small free 
market, the judicious use of material incentives in the 
workplace, and a pragmatic approach to ideology. Hu, Zhao, de 
facto ruler Deng Xiaoping, and to a lesser extent Chen Yun, 
China's senior economic planner, support these views, whereas 
other more orthodox leaders, including Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian, 
and disgraced former party chairman Hua Guofeng, have 
reservations about a number of these policies. 
These different approaches have been reflected in recent 
discussions of economic policy. Economic policymakers just below 
the senior level of the party have disagreed over the last two 
years on such subjects as the proper mix of investment between 
heavy and light industry, the merits of decentralizing foreign 
trade, the political and economic effects of greater reliance on 
market forces, and the role of whole plant imports and foreign 
loans in building China's economy. Principal figures in these 
debates include: 
-- Bo Yibo, Central Committee member, Vice Premier, and 
Minister in Charge of the State Machine Building 
Industry Commission, presides over the reform of China's 
extensive machine building industry and is the principal 
figure in Sino-US economic relations. 
Gu Mu, Secretariat member, Vice Premier, and Minister in 
Charge of the Foreign Investment Control Commission and 
the Import/Export Commission, is particularly active in 
setting foreign trade policy and is generally associated 
with the more orthodox policymakers. 
-- Yu Qiuli, Politburo and Secretariat member, Vice Premier, 
and Minister in Charge of the State Energy Commission, 
appears to favor a higher priority for heavy industrial 
development.

MEMORANDUM 
China's Banking and Foreign Exchange System 
Like most other economic institutions-in China, the banking 
system is undergoing significant changes. The central government 
is trying to revive the system as.a major instrument for 
coordinating and controlling economic activity. The need for 
overhaul results from damage incurred during the Cultural 
Revolution, when the banking system was relegated to a position 
of little more than cashier(accountant for the Ministry of 
Finance. 
In 1978 the People's Bank of China (PBOC)--China's central 
bank--resumed its position at the apex of a system that includes 
the Agricultural Bank and its credit cooperatives, the Bank of 
China (the foreign banking arm), and the Capital Construction 
Bank. The PBOC reports directly to the State Council, the 
highest executive organ of the Chinese Government. After the 
State Planning Commission establishes the annual economic plan, 
25X1 
25X1 
budgetary authorities and banking officials allocate and 
coordinate the flow of funds required to fulfill the plan. 
Although basic planning is done in terms of goods and services, 
Chinese banking leaders draw up a parallel plan in monetary terms 
to correspond as closely 
as possible to 
the planned flow of real 
goods and services. 
25X1 
The Domestic Banking 
Structure 
The Peoples Bank of China is the country's main operating 
bank, with more than 15,000 branch and subbranch officesand 
330,000 staff and employees throughout the country. As China's 
central bank, it issues currency, sets the interest and foreign 
exchange rates, and formulates and implements nationwide credit 
and cash reserve plans. In addition, the Bank is the major 
source of short- and medium-term credit for state enterprises 
over and above the level anticipated in the enterprise financial

plans. Most Pixed and working capital requirements still are 
satisfied via budgetary grants channeled through the banking 
system, but increasingly funds are being loaned by the banks, at 
different rates of interest, based on creditworthiness. 
The Agricultural Bank is the primary instrument for 
providing modern banking operations in China's huge rural sector 
and was formally reestablished in February 1979. Central 
government efforts to mobilize rural sources of savings and to 
make more credit available to the agricultural sector have 
fluctuated with changes in Beijing's priorities for developing 
agriculture. The Agricultural Bank was established in 1955, 
abolished in 1957, reopened again in 1963, and was abolished 
again some time in the late 1960s or early 1970s. During those 
periods when the Agricultural Bank was out of operation, rural 
banking was supervised by an agricultural department within the 
Peoples Bank. The Agricultural Bank now operates under the 
guidance of the Peoples Bank and is the main channel for state 
investment and credits to agriculture as well as for the 
collection of state revenue in the countryside. The Bank has 
1,300 branches and offices in rural areas and employs 230,000 
workers and staff. The Bank also manages China's 62,000 credit 
cooperatives, which employ an additional 260,000 full-time staff 
members and some 400,000 part-time workers. 
The Capital Construction Bank is a specialized bank for 
managing state investment in capital construction. Unlike the 
Agricultural Bank, which is overseen by the Peoples Bank, the 
Construction Bank operates under the joint guidance of the State 
Capital Construction Commission and the Ministry of Finance. The 
Bank disburses budgetary grants for construction projects, 
provides credits, and maintains the accounts for units involved 
in geological survey, construction, and installation, and for 
enterprises that purvey construction materials. Recent 
discussions of the problems of waste and diversion of funds imply 
that the Construction Bank has inadequately.monitored the uses of 
investment funds. This suggests that the Construction Bank also 
may be brought under the Peoples Bank. 
The Enhanced Role of Banking in the Domestic Economy  
During the past two years, the central government has made 
active use of the banking system to alleviate inflationary 
pressures and may soon employ the system as a major tool for 
encouraging more efficient use of both fixed and working capital. 
China's banking system also regulates the quantity of cash 
available to the economy. The rise of urban and rural incomes 
since early 1979 and the continued inability of the economy to 
satisfy the demand for goods and services have become a major 
concern for the central authorities. The cash balances of 
individuals are controlled, not by regulation, but by social 
pressures and modest interest payments on savings deposits.

Interest rates on the deposits of individuals have been raised 
twice, in April 1979 and again in April 1980. Although sources 
differ on the size and rates of growth of urban and rural 
deposits, the higher interest rates apparently are generating 
significant increases in deposits. Individual deposits appear to 
have risen by about 30 percent during 1979 to approximatel 28 
billion yuan, 20 billion of which represent urban savings. 
Beijing has made similar efforts to tighten control over the 
funds of industrial and commercial enterprises. Since 1950, 
government units, public institutions, and state enterprises have 
been required to deposit their funds--beyond mall cash 
holdings--with the Peoples Bank. In contrast, during the 1950s 
collectively owned units--mainly rural agricultural and 
industrial production units and rural communes--had no such 
requirements. Today, these units must deposit most of their 
funds with of the Peoples Bank or the rural credit cooperative. 
Cash is used only for payment of wages and pensions, state 
purchases of agricultural products, and payments between 
individuals. More than 90 percent of the cash released is for 
paying wages and purchasing farm production and rural 
handicrafts. Bank transfers rather than cash account for the  
vast majority of transactions in the economy. 
Recent moves by the central authorities to have the banks 
check more closely the cash balances of enterprises, improve loan 
collection, and ensure that funds are used for their intended 
purposes suggest a lax enforcement of regulations in recent 
years. Beijing has kept the interest rate paid on deposits by 
state and collective enterprises at 1.9 percent a year since 
1972. To encourage reductions in cash balances, however, the 
government has instituted new penalties for nonpayment or misuse 
of loans. In March 1980 the state placed a 20-percent surcharge 
on the previous interest rate for overdue loans, a 30-percent 
surcharge on loans covering excess inventories, and a 50-percent 
surcharge on loans used to meet excess expenditures for capital 
construction projects. The three surcharges are aimed at 
remedying problems that have long impeded obstacles to more rapid 
and balanced industrial growth: 
-- the limited availability of credit caused by the 
apparently large quantities of funds tied up in loans in 
arrears. 
extremely high inventories of finished but, in many 
cases, unsalable products and larger-than-necessary 
stocks of raw materials and intermediate products held 
by industrial enterprises. 
chronic overruns in the costs of constructing new 
productive capacity.

International Banking Activities  
The Bank of China (BOC) is the specialized foreign exchange 
bank of the PRC. Although it was nominally given independent 
status directly under the State Council in February 1979, the BOC 
continues in fact to refer important business and administrative 
matters to the People's Bank. The Chairman of the Bank of China, 
Bu Ming, also is vice president of the PBOC. BOC has more than 
70 domestic branches and subbranches as well as overseas branches 
in Hong Kong, Singapore, Luxembourg, and London. Overseas posts 
established within the past year include a representative office 
in Tokyo and a branch in New York. A Paris branch reportedly is 
in the offing. The BOC also recently began to consolidate the 
so-called "sister banks"--13 essentially state-owned banks in 
Hong Kong and Macau that are legally classified as private 
companies--into what will be on of the largest banking groups in 
Hong Kong. 
Although all elements within China's banking system have 
undergone major overhauls, the changes adopted by the BOC perhaps 
best illustrate how far Beijing is willing to go to promote 
economic modernization. Before 1978 the Bank took a strictly 
passive role in the international market. Activities of overseas 
branches were limited to accepting remittances, financing trade, 
and on rare occasions arranging credit. Now BOC managers are 
encouraged to engage in any profitable banking practice. Since 
1978 the Bank has helped manage loan syndications and real estate 
purchases and has arranged well over $30 billion in credits. In 
addition, it has cooperated with US and Japanese bankers to set 
up merchant banks in Hong Kong and is well along the way to 
floating bonds in both Japan and Hong Kong. There are even 
rumors that the BOC will soon invest in Western stock markets. 
Domestic responsibilities also have been broadened. Bank of 
China branches nationwide are being encouraged to lend to 
enterprises with export-earning potential. Loans can either be 
in foreign exchange or local currency. Light industry has been 
singled out for special emphasis because of its labor-intensive 
nature and its ability to rapidly generate foreign exchange. In 
Guandong, Fujian, Shanghai, Tianjin and Beijing--areas having 
greatest economic autonomy--BOC branches have authority to 
provide loans of up to $5 million without seeking higher-level 
approval. Branches in other provinces are also gaining authority 
albeit over small amounts of funds. After making loans, the 
banks are expected to follow the progress of the projects and 
assist  in all aspects of management to ensure proper use of the 
funds. 
The speed with which most of the changes were introduced has 
severely taxed the Bank's personnel and, in part at least, has 
been responsible for a less than favorable Western view of 
Chinese capabilities. Foreign bankers over the past two years 
have found their Chinese counterparts generally ignorant of

or i ing enterprises from depositing the foreign exchange 
outside China, the Bank had difficulty attracting deposits. 
Under decentralization, enterprises that could retain a portion 
of their foreign exchange earnings were depositing the bulk of 
their funds in Hong Kong to take advantage of easier  
accessibility and higher interest rates. 
The Changing Foreign Exchange System 
The Bank of China also played a major role in revamping 
China's foreign exchange rate mechanism. Since December 1980 
China has been using a two-tiered exchange rate system with both 
an official (external) rate and an internal rate. Foreigners--
travelers as well as businessmen--continue to observe only one 
exchange rate, officially set at about 1.7 yuan per dollar, when 
purchasing or selling renminbi (RMB). 1/ Domestic enterprises, 
however, now face an internal exchange rate of 2.8 yuan per 
dollar--a de facto depreciation of 46 ntkevbuvar 
sell foreign exchange through the Bank of China. 
Internally, the introduction of a two-tiered system is 
undoubtedly an attempt to make exporting profitable and importing 
more costly while at the same time avoiding the stigma usually 
associated with a currency devaluation. In the past, China's 
foreign trade corporations (FTCs), which handle the bulk of two-
way trade, have generally shown book losses on exports and 
profits on imports. The losses came about because the FTCs were 
required to purchase goods on the domestic market at prices set 
by fiat rather than by production costs or market forces. The 
RMB prices that the FTCs paid for these goods, when converted 
into foreign currency at the official exchange rate, exceeded the 
prices that these goods commanded on the world market. On the 
import side, for analogous reasons, foreign goods generally 
commanded a higher RMB price in the home market than the FTCs 
spent in purchasing (at the official exchange rate) the foreign 
exchange necessary to acquire goods from abroad. 
So long as most trade was handled by organs of the central 
government, the profitability question created no real 
problems. The volume and type of exports, to a large degree, 
1. At present, the renminbi, like all Communist currencies, is 
not convertible on the world market. Foreigners may purchase 
only enough RMB to carry out specific trade or financial 
transactions. The official rate is reportedly tied to a basket 
of currencies and therefore fluctuates moderately over time.

were determined by State plans, which the FTCs were expected to 
carry out regardless of profitability. Losses sustained in 
exporting were offset either by FTC profits from importing or by 
government funds extended through the Bank of China. With 
Beijing now emphasizing profitability as a measure of efficiency, 
however, the standardization of the two-tier exchange rate system 
can be viewed as a means to forestall possible shifts out of 
exports and into imports by profit-seeking domestic traders.

Chinese Investment and Tax Laws  
Following the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, Beijing in 
the late 1970s seriously sought to create a new judicial system 
having a distinct body of legal rules and the agencies to 
administer them. Beijing also has concentrated on rebuilding the 
courts and the formal criminal process. China's judicial 
hierarchy now consists of three types of courts: the Supreme 
People's Court in Beijing, a three-tiered system of local 
people's courts, and special courts. This structure, however, is 
new and untested, and Western businessmen are frequently confused 
and dissatisifed with the 7aps and ambiguities within the Chinese 
legal arena. 
China's Legal Framework  
Beijing has recently established economic tribunals under 
the people's courts in some cities and major towns. These 
tribunals are of special interest to foreign investors and 
traders because they are responsible for handling cases involving 
speculation, profiteering and other (unspecified) economic 
crimes, for adjudicating economic conflicts between enterprises 
(including Chinese and foreign enterprises), and for promoting a 
stable atmosphere for China's economic growth. The orecise scope 
of their jurisdiction, however, is unclear. 
Chinese Perceptions of the Role of Law in Society  
Culture has helped shape the nature of legal institutions 
and government policies in China. China's present legal 
institutions not only reflect strong continuities with 
traditional Chinese views about law but also show the influence 
of Soviet legal theory. A clear, functional separation between 
the legal system and the government bureaucracy does not exist.

Law continues to be a veht.cle for the expression of official 
philosophy guarded by an elite, which in theory governs by virtue 
of noble example and deep wisdom. Encounters with the legal 
system still provoke fear and suspicion among a populace, which 
regards any such experience as a serious breakdown in the social 
order. Local loyalties and personal networks continue to play a 
strong role in identifying and punishing violators of the social 
order. Chinese society never developed a concept of individual 
rights guaranteed by the state. Moreover, contracts are 
commercial documents that are needed only to define the desired 
outcome of a transaction rather than to establish the rights  and 
responsibilities of the contracting parties. 
Beijing's efforts to reorganize China's legal system reflect 
a need to construct more effective legal institutions and to 
establish standards for official behavior. The primary functions 
of the new institutions are to reinforce discipline and maintain 
social order, to control arbitrary actions by officials, and to 
provide guidelines for individual behavior and organizational 
management, particularly in the economic sector. The role of law 
in China's international economic relations is to regulate 
foreign economic activity in China, from direct investments to a 
variety of joint transactions. 
Implications for Foreign Trade, Finance, and Investment  
China's broadening of international economic activity is 
also forcing Beijing to adapt its legal system more to Western 
concepts. The Chinese traditionally preferred loosely drawn 
agreements with disputes settled on an informal basis, whereas 
Westerners insist on tightly drawn, detailed legal documents, 
with the courts as the arbiter of disputes. 
Although trade dealings and plant purchases have accorded 
China some familiarity with Western contract law over the years, 
China's opening to foreign investment presented new problems for 
the PRC legal system. After an initial burst of interest,' 
potential investors immediately grew apprehensive about entering 
into deals where no legal structure spelled out investor rights, 
obligations, and protections. After some delay, China published 
in mid 1979 the Joint Venture Law, which governs participation of 
foreign companies in joint ventures, licensing deals, processing 
operations, and compensation trade. This law also stimulated 
further economic legislation designed to promote and regulate 
foreign trade and investment while protecting China's interests 
and sovereignty. Investors still found the law vague, and 
further interpretive-legislation was required. Among the laws 
adopted since August 1980 to regulate foreign economic activities 
in China were those pertaining to labor management, the 
registration of joint ventures, joint venture taxes, the 
Guangdong special economic zones, and foreign exchange control.

CONFIDENTIAL 
The Chinese are still attempting to define the legal aspects 
of economic relationships. China's traditional preference for 
settling all disputes--including foreign economic matters--by 
compromise remains. Although the regulations on labor management 
provide for a bureau to arbitrate disputes and permit the 
dissatisfied party to sue in the local people's courts, the real 
extent of bureau and court authority is untested. Bilateral 
trade as well as economic and shipping agreements that China has 
concluded with other governments usually include provisions that 
allow the parties involved to determine the course and location 
of any arbitration. The viability of the other regulations will 
be tested as investors attempt to apply them in meeting,  
changing, or canceling contract terms. 
Problems  
The ambiguous and inconsistently applied economic rules, the 
vacillating policies, the inexperienced legal and regulatory 
institutions, and an unfamiliarity with Western commercial and 
legal practices--all these factors have complicated-the 
production and implementation of rules covering foreign economic 
partners and have retarded growth of outside investment in 
China. Although the Chinese have accommodated some foreign 
commercial practices, they have done so in response to the needs 
and demands expressed by prospective outside investors without 
regard for the complexity of the task of creating clear rules 
where none had existed. Moreover, in attempting to clarify some 
points of law through supplemental regulations, the Chinese 
frequently have departed from the intent and meaning of the 
original law. 
Inconsistencies and changes in policies on which the laws 
are based have led to misinterpretations. Although 
decentralization has permitted Chinese negotiators to enter into 
and approve transactions with foreigners without central 
endorsement, the extent and limits of the authority and of the 
regulations governing foreign investments are unclear. 
Differences in the characteristics of Chinese and foreign 
negotiating styles also have created problems. Linguistic and 
cultural differences and the absence of a common background for 
problem solving have produced divergent concepts of proper 
methods of doing business and perceptions of the legal aspects of 
commercial transactions. Because of limited experience in 
complicated commercial transactions, the Chinese have continued 
to apply concepts associated with simpler transactions to more 
complex ones, and disagreements over the definition and validity 
of contracts have been common. Long, confusing, and frequently 
unsuccessful negotiating sessions are the norm. 
Foreigners have expressed concern over matters that remain 
unresolved or untested. These include standards for defining a 
valid contract, guarantees of the rights and responsibilities 
stipulated in contract terms, the question of tax creditability,

China's Energy Outlook  
China's energy output will drop by about 3 percent in 1981 
after a 1-percent decline last year. This decline, following 
three decades of rapid growth, is already beginning to constrain 
Chinese industrial and transport activity. 
The outlook through 1985 is hardly encouraging inasmuch as 
large investments are required in China's coal mines and 
oilfields just to maintain current output rates. New capacity in 
these industries is coming on stream very slowly, and ambitious 
plans to develop hydroelectric and nuclear power are lagging. 
The long lead times associated with new energy resources make a 
resurgence of energy growth rates commensurate with desired 
industrial growth unlikely until the late 1980s. In the last two 
years, energy conservation has lessened the impact of fuel 
shortages, but a rapid shift of the country's industrial output 
mix toward light industry--forcing a sharp decline in energy 
intensive heavy industry--has been the main factor in reducing 
energy demand. With a likely shift toward restoring some growth 
in heavy industry, however, a further decline in energy output 
would prove much more serious. 
Oil Production Decline  
Although down only marginally in 1980, crude oil output is 
currently running at 2.02 million barrels a day, 5 percent below 
last year's rate. Just three years ago, China's leaders expected 
oil output to more than double, producing 4 to 5 million barrels 
a day by 1985. Now they admit that China will do well just to 
maintain a 2-million b/d rate through the mid 1980s.

High-level Chinese officials suggest that the slowdown 
results from an overemphasis on production without sufficient 
attention to the exploration and development of new fields. In 
fact, considerable exploration has taken place, but antiquated 
equipment and outmoded techniques contributed to an apparent 
exaggeration of reserves, especially in the geologically complex 
Huabei (North China) Basin near Beijing. Development efforts 
have often been inappropriate to the geologic environment and in 
some cases have harmed the prospects for sustaining high 
output. Meanwhile, production in some of China's older oil 
fields--most notably Daqing and Shengli, which together produce 
70 percent of China's oil--has leveled off and may soon begin to 
decline. 
Fall in Gas Output  
Natural gas production faces many of the same problems as 
oil, but output has declined even more steeply--10.3 percent--
this year. About half of the gas output comes from fields in 
Sichuan Province where known reserves are reportedly being 
depleted. Much of the rest is produced residually with crude oil 
in the major oilfields. The decline in gas output is affecting 
industrial consumers in Sichuan Province even though supplies to 
almost all nonindustrial consumers have been terminated. 
Fertilizer plants there and in .th- 8; - ? s y appear 
to be particularly hard hit. 
Coal Output Stagnates  
China's coal industry is now under pressure to fill the 
expected energy gap caused by oil shortages. In 1980, however, 
coal production declined by 2.4 percent to 620 million tons, and 
Beijing anticipates a further drop to 600 million tons in 1981. 
Monthly output figures so far indicate that the target will 
barely be met. Production in some of the older mining areas, 
particularly in the Liaoning fields, has leveled off and may be 
declining. Moreover, the central government has deliberately 
retarded the growth of uneconomical small mines, which have 
accounted for much of the increase in China's coal output in 
recent years. Inadequate investment has slowed development of 
large new mines and has prevented the construction of adequate 
rail and port facilities to transport the coal. 
To maximize the return on still inadequate investment 
levels, the Chinese are concentrating on a few areas which 
already have large proven reserves. Eight coalfields or bases 
are earmarked for most of the investment funds allocated to 
developing new mines. These coal bases have rich deposits 
totaling about 120 billion tons and already have some working 
mines and required infrastructure. The Chinese also are focusing 
on rail and port facilites. For instance, four of the five 
railroads which serve coal-rich Shanxi Province are being

upgraded either by electrification or double tracking. These 
efforts probably will permit production to increase slowly, 
perhaps to 650 million tons or more by 1985. 
Electric Power Shortages  
Despite significant progress in developing its electric 
power, China's generating capacity is still embryonic and unable 
to meet the increasing demand from industry and agriculture. 
There have been widespread reports of factories operating at only 
70 to 80 percent capacity because of electricity shortages, and 
many new plants lack sufficient power to start operation. 
Despite improved hydroelectric output, total electric power 
production is up only 1.4 percent this year, far below the rates 
required to support planned modernization. 
In the face of power shortages, the industry is receiving a 
larger share of an admittedly smaller capital investment budget. 
At present about 22,000 megawatts (MW) of new capacity is under 
construction--10,000 MW of hydroelecric and 12,000 MW of thermal--
to add to the country's 60,000 MW capacity. By 1985 about 18,000 
MW should become operational, an annual growth rate of just over 
5 percent. Although this matches most forecasts of industrial 
growth, electric power requirements general_y increase faster 
than industry as a whole. 
To satisfy growing needs in the late 1980s and 1990s, Beijing 
has attempted to draw up a major program of large coal-fired and 
nuclear-powered thermal plants and several exceptionally large 
hydroelectric projects. These plans, however, are only 
preliminary. Because hydro- and nuclear-power projects are 
capital-intensive and require long lead times, their development 
has been postponed in favor of coal-fired thermal plants. 
Outlook for US Involvement  
Beijing's high priority on energy considerations--
particularly in the petroleum, coal, and electric power 
industries--augurs well for American contracts. US energy-
related firms are regarded by the Chinese as having the best 
technolgy and expertise. Moreover, foreign exchange constraints 
are not as binding as in other sectors, partly because oil and 
coal can be important foreign exchange earners. 
Nevertheless, progress in signing contracts has been slow. 
Although this has been discouraging to many firms, Chinese 
slowness should be expected, given the scale of many of the 
energy projects. Because the projects are so large and costly 
and diverge from past policies that discouraged foreign 
involvement, the Chinese bureaucracy is having a difficult time 
making decisions. Major planning mistakes in the past, like 
those associated with the Baoshan steel mill, have made 
decisionmaking even more difficult.

The most promising area for potential cooperation is 
offshore oil exploration and development. If contracts are 
signed and exploration is even moderately successful, oil could 
easily became the strongest commercial link between the United 
States and China. 
Western firms, primarily US, already have spent almost $200 
million on a gratis basis in the South China Sea to complete one 
of the most comprehensive seismic surveys ever done. The surveys 
have identified a considerable number of geological structures 
favorable for oil or gas accumulation. Reserves cannot be proven 
without extensive exploratory drilling, but the Chinese are 
suggesting that the area could produce on the order of one 
million barrels per day by the early 1990s, enough to-offset the 
declines expected at Daqing and Shengli by then. Given the 
nature of oil exploration, it is also possible that the area will 
produce little oil. 
The Chinese Ministry of Petroleum was expected to issue 
invitations to bid by late 1980, but legal and technical problems 
caused a postponement. Beijing now says invitations will be  
extended within a few months.  
  Oil firms are expected to use their own funds 
for exploration, whereas substantial bank or government financing 
probably will be required for development expenses. Under such 
arrangements, the Chinese would provide relatively small amounts 
of capital, but in turn would five 7p a sizable portion of 
ultimate output. 
Despite China's looming oil shortages, Beijing's caution and 
slowness about negotiating with Western firms are understandable. 
Although China would benefit from the technology shared in the 
offshore effort, it would be putting into foreign hands one of 
its most likely sources for maintaining oil self-sufficiency. 
Given the poor record of its own offshore program, Beijing would 
appear to have little choice, but some among China's leadership  
and in its petroleum industry may hold different views. 
US firms also are well positioned to aid in and benefit from 
the development of China's electric power system. To 
successfully modernize, China will have to spend about $100 
billion over the next 20 years on power plants and transmission 
systems. For development on such a scale, China almost certainly 
will attempt to build its own manufacturing capacity and 
incorporate a host of improved and new technologies--possibly 
including nuclear power reactors. Emphasis on acquiring new

manufacturing technology will make equipment sales to China 
difficult, but US firms may benefit from  joint venture and 
licensing agreements. 
The Westinghouse and Combustion Engineering contracts for 
sharing technology to manufacture 300 MW generators--financed in 
part by Eximbank's first loans to China--are an example. These 
units probably will become the standard generator for scores of 
Chinese powerplants over the next 20 years, and this would 
promise the US equipment  suppliers a long-term beneficial 
relationship with China. 
Chinese purchase of a US-built nuclear power plant or a 
licensing agreement to manufacture in China the major parts of 
such plants likewise would inaugurate a long term commercial 
relationship. Questions regarding the economics of the capitalr 
intensive nuclear plants have not been definitively resolved, 
however, in part because the Chinese system is not well equipped 
to handle such issues. Feasibility studies suggest that major 
demand areas like Gwangdong, Liaoning, and Shanghai might support 
nuclear plants. Whether such plants would be built by the 
domestic nuclear machine building industry on its own or would be 
imported from the West (Framatome of France is the strongest 
competitor to US firms) also must be resolved. At present, on 
the basis of a reported postponement of the proposed 
Gwangdong/Hong Kong nuclear power plant and a tentative approval 
to construct a small domestically built plant in the Shanghai 
area, Beijing appears to be favoring a limited program of 
domestic construction. In any case, nuclear power is unlikely to 
make a significant contribution through the end of the century. 
Prospects for large-scale US participation in China's coal 
and hydropower industries are less promising, but US equipment 
supply firms probably will continue to export significant amounts 
of their products. Much of the equipment for coal and hydropower 
development is available domestically or can be imported from 
highly competitive Japanese or West German firms. Even so, 
Chinese purchases of US earthmoving equipment have been 
substantial--$100 million out of total imports of $500 million 
for earthmoving equipment in 1979. Such imports declined sharply 
in 1980, however, due to readjustment cutbacks. Technical 
exchange agreements such as the US-China hydropower protocol 
signed last year improve the prospects for future sales.

Addressed as: 
Mr. Vice Premier 
A longtime special-
ist in economic manage-
ment, Bo Yibo was ap-
pointed a vice premier in 
July 1979, a member of 
the Central Committee of 
the Chinese Communist 
CHINA 
Party in September of that year, and Minister in 
Charge of the newly created State Machine-Building 
Industry Commission in February 1980. The Commis-
sion is charged with strengthening management and 
integrating civilian and defense aspects of the 
machine-building industry. 
A native of Shanxi Province, Bo graduated from 
Guomin Normal School in Taiyuan in 1930. He later 
took courses at Beijing University but did not grad-
uate, probably because he was jailed for participat-
ing in anti-Japanese disturbances. He served as 
China's first Minister of Finance during 1949-53. 
Bo was Chairman of the State Construction Commission 
from 1954 to 1956, when he became Chairman of the 
State Economic Commission and was named a vice pre-
mier. From 1962 to 1966 he concurrently served as 
Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission. Bo 
was purged during the Cultural Revolution (1966-69) 
and did not reappear until 1978. In September 1980 
he led a delegation of the State Machine-Building 
Industry Commission to the United States. 
Bo, 73, is a widower and has several chil-
dren. His wife was a government official who was 
persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. She died 
in 1967.

Addressed as: 
Mr. Chen 
Chen Yun, China's 
elder statesman for eco-
nomic affairs, is respon-
sible for overall long-term economic planning. The 
architect of China's economic programs from 1949 to 
1958, Chen is an advocate of gradual, balanced eco-
nomic growth that stresses agriculture and light 
industry. From July 1979 until his resignation in 
September 1980, he served as a vice premier in addi-
tion to all his other duties. He was also Minister 
in charge of the influential State Financial and 
Economic Commission from July 1979 until March 1981, 
when the Commission was dissolved. 
CHINA 
Active in Chinese Communist Party affairs since 
the 1920s, Chen rose to become the ranking vice pre-
mier by 1954 and a member of the Politburo Standing 
Committee in 1956. In 1958 Mao Zedong launched the 
Great Leap Forward, an ambitious program to produce 
rapid economic growth. Chen criticized Mao's poli-
cies as unrealistic, and his political influence 
began to erode. Denounced during the Cultural Rev-
olution (1966-69), he lost his membership on the 
Politburo and his vice-premiership. After Mao died 
in September 1976, Chen regained much of his former 
stature. 
Chen, who is about 76 years old, is a native of 
Jiangsu Province.

Chinese Communist Party 
Central Committee 
Addressed as: 
Mr. Vice Premier 
An acknowledged 
economic planning spe-
cialist, Yu Qiuli was 
made a vice premier in @ 
1975. He has been a member of the Politburo of the 
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee since 
August 1977 and of the party Secretariat since Feb-
ruary 1980. As Minister in Charge of the State 
Energy Commission--a post created in August 1980--he 
directs China's energy ministries. In September 
1980 he was named to the Committee for the Revision 
of the Constitution. 
CHINA 
Yu is a native of Jiangxi Province. He became 
a member of the Communist Youth League in 1929 and 
of the Communist Party in 1931. He subsequently 
joined the People's Liberation Army, eventually 
rising to the rank of lieutenant general before 
leaving the military in 1958 to become Minister of 
the Petroleum Industry. In that capacity he was in-
volved in the development of the large Daqing oil-
field in Heilongjiang Province in the 1960s. Yu was 
the target of Red Guard criticism during the Cultur-
al Revolution (1966-69), but he emerged from the ex-
perience relatively unscathed. In 1972 he was ap-
pointed Minister in Charge of the State Planning 
Commission--a position that gave him responsibility 
for planning in all sectors of the economy; he was 
removed from that post in August 1980. In late 1979 
he accompanied then party Chairman Hua Guofeng on a 
visit to four West European countries. 
Yu, who is about 67, has only one arm-'-his 
right.

(Phonetic: yooen)

Minister in Charge, State 
Economic Commission; 
Chairman, China Enter-

ciation 
Addressed as: 
Mr. Minister 
Yuan Baohua became 
Minister in Charge of the 
State Economic Commission 
in March 1981, after hav-
ing served since 1978 as 
a vice minister of the 
Commission. As Minister, he is responsible for 
translating long-term economic plans into workable 
programs for improving the industrial and transpor-
tation sectors of the economy. Since 1979 Yuan has 
been chairman of the China Enterprise Management 
Association, an organization composed of scholars, 
experts and managers interested in upgrading the 
quality of economic management practices. 
CHINA 
0 
Involved in economic affairs since 1950, Yuan 
first gained national attention in the Ministry of 
Metallurgy, where he served as a vice minister from 
1959 to 1960. During 1960-63 he was a vice chairman 
of the Economic Commission. In 1963 he was appoint-
ed director of the General Bureau for Allocation of 
Materials. The following year he was promoted to 
Minister when the bureau became the Ministry of Al-
locations. Although Yuan was criticized during the 
Cultural Revolution (1966-69), he apparently was not 
purged because he appeared in public in 1969 and 
1970 as a "leading member" of an unidentified State 
Council office. He served as vice minister of the 
State Planning Commission during 1974-78. 
Yuan, 65, is a native of Henan Province. He 
led an economic delegation to the United States in 
November 1979 and one to Western Europe during May-
June 1980.

ZHAO Ziyang  
(Phonetic: jaow) 
(6392/4793/7122) 
Premier; Vice Chairman, 
Chinese Communist Party 
Addressed as: 
Mr. Premier 
Agriculture special-
ist and administrator 
Zhao Ziyang was named 
Premier in September 
1980, only five months 
after he had been trans-
ferred from his provin-
cial leadership posts to 
become a vice premier. 
In June 1981 he was elected third-ranking vice 
chairman of the Chinese Communist Party after having 
served less than two years on the elite Politburo. 
Zhao's rapid rise has been widely attributed to his 
enthusiastic implementation of CCP Vice Chairman 
Deng Xiaoping's economic reform policies while hold-
ing his provincial posts during 1975-80. 
Until his transfer to Beijing, Zhao had spent 
his entire career in local government. During most 
of the Sino-Japanese war (1937-45) he served as a 
county and prefectural party secretary in east Chi-
na. By 1965 Zhao had risen to CCP first secretary 
of Guangdong Province, but he was purged in 1967 
during the Cultural Revolution. He reappeared in 
north China in 1971 and the next year returned to 
Guangdong, where he was restored to his old post by 
1974. In December 1975 he became first secretary 
and Governor of Sichuan, China's most populous prov-
ince. Zhao was initially elected to the CCP Central 
Committee in 1973. He became an alternate member of 
the Politburo in 1977 and a full member in 1979. 
According to Western press reports, Zhao is 
relaxed, friendly and easy to deal with. While a 
provincial leader, he visited Iran, Romania, Yugo-
slavia and Western Europe. In his current capacity 
he has traveled to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and 
Southeast Asia. Zhao, who is married, is about 62 
years old.

ZHENG Tuobin  
(Phonetic: jung) 
(6774/2148/1755) 
Minister of Foreign Trade 
(since 10 September 1981) 
Addressed as: 
Mr. Minister 
A foreign trade 
expert for more than 25 
years, Zheng Tuobin had 
been a vice minister of 
foreign trade for nearly 
four years before assum-
ing his current post. 
During his career he has 
dealt extensively with 
Western and socialist governments. 
CHINA 
Zheng's career with the Foreign Trade Ministry 
began in about 1953, when he was deputy chief of the 
export section of the First Bureau (socialist coun-
tries). He left the Ministry in 1958 to become a 
commercial counselor at the Embassy in Moscow and 
remained there until 1964. By 1966 he had returned 
to the Ministry as acting director of the First 
Bureau. For the next five years he did not appear 
in public. He reappeared in December 1971 but was 
not identified in a specific post until April 1973. 
From then until December 1977, he was director of 
the Third Bureau, which is responsible for trade 
with Western Europe, the Americas and Oceania. 
Zheng has traveled widely in the course of his offi-
cial duties, but he has not yet been to the United 
States. 
Zheng, 57, is a native of Shaanxi Province. He 
speaks and understands some English.
