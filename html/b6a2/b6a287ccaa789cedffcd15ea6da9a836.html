BOOK I. A BRIEF\HISTORY OF MANCHURIAN TRANSPORTATION 
I. 
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM BEFORE THE 19TH CENTURY 
AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAYS 
Long before the development of modern civilization there were 
land and waterway transportation systems in Manchuria. After the 
opening of the five main highways under the Empire of Po Hai in 
Manchuria the succeeding dynasties of Liao, Chin, Yuan, Ming and 
Ch'ing made continuous efforts to establish a system of communica-
tions for building up military, administrative and economic strength. 
The population in Manchuria was at that time, however, very small, 
and consequently passenger and freight traffic on land or by the 
rivers was light. Although the Manchu Imperial Government lifted 
its ban on Chinese immigration into Manchuria at the end of the 
19th Century the population in Manchuria was at that time less than 
10,000,000. When Ying-k'ou was opened as a port in 1658, the total 
tonnage of imports and exports was less than 100,000. It is sate 
to say that the volume of trade was small in the past several cen-
turies although it is taken for granted that it may have fluctuated 
with changes in political and economic conditions. 
At present we are concerned not so much with transportation 
volume as with the methods of transportation and the organization 
of the transportation system. This would lead us to a full under-
standing of the transportation system in modern Manchuria and would 
provide us with a background knowledge for future planning and policy 
making. The following is a brief description of the land and river 
transportation system in Manchuria before the construction of rail-
ways: 
I. Waterways  
Both the Sungari and the Nonni flow toward Miao-chieh 
(likolaevsk) in Amur Province under Russian control and enter the 
frozen Tatar Strait. These two rivers had no direct contact with 
the provinces south of the Great Wall and those provinces in the 
southern part of Manchuria. Nor did they have economic ties with 
the various areas in the northern part of Manchuria. Besides; the 
south part of the Sungari valley and the Liao Ho is separated by 
mountains which render transportation between the north and the south 
more difficult. Consequently, all sorts of goods sent to Manchuria 
either from China proper or from overseas had to be first transferred 
at Ying-klou. It was from there that goods were transferred to 
sailing boats which sailed up the Liao Ho. At certain Faeces along 
the upper Liao Ho, these goods were transferred to horse carts and 
traveled 150 to 200 kilometers to cities on the Sungari and the 
Nonni Rivers. It was at these cities along the rivers that goods 
were transferred from wagons to sailing boats and sent to various 
places located on the tributaries of the two rivers. This shows 
that the navigation system in Manchuria had been established almost 
exclusively along the meridians. Ying-k'ou was a transfer port 
from where all of the sailing boats sailed northward along the main

Approved For Release 1999/08/25: CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
course of the Liao Ho and its tributary, the East Liao Ho. From 
the East Liao Ho to I-tung Ho by land, and from the I Tung Ho, one 
of the tributaries of the Sungari River, they dispersed in three direc-
tions: one leading eastward to Kirin, another leading northeast to-
ward the lower stream of the Sungari River and its tributaries and 
leading to cities including I-lan and Hu-lan$ and the third leading 
to the northwest as far as Tsitsihar. 
II. Highways  
The striking feature of roads in Manchuria was that they lay 
north and south. There were four main roads leading from the south 
to the north. (See Map 1) 
. 1. The East Trunk Route. This was the earlies in its open-
ing and operation and the safest of all. Mukden and Kirin were linked 
by this road. When it entered Kirin province, it divided into three 
directions. The first road led eastward to Ning-an, the second north-
westward to Fu-yu, and the third northward to A-chlene? (Ah-shih-ho). 
From A-Weng there were two roads, the Right Road and the Left Road. 
That which led to Fu-chin through Pin-hsien-and I-lan is called the 
Right Road; while that which crossed the Sungari River and reached 
Hu-lan is called the Left Road. 
In addition, there was a short cut linking Mukden and A-chleng. 
This road is short in distance and convenient for communication. 
Subsequently a sbuth-north railway was built along this line. 
2. The Central Trunk Route. It started from Rein-min 
located on the lower Liao Ho, traveled along the east bank of that 
river and terminated at Fu-yu in the north. It connected cities and 
towns by land and river transportation. In other words, it reached 
A-chleng in the east, Ch'i-ch'i-ha-erh in the northwest along the 
Nonni River, and Hal-ho in the far north. 
3. The Western Trunk Route. It began at Hsi-feng-klou 
moved onward along the East Hein-an-ling Mountain, penetrated the 
Mongolian Grass Land, crossed the Tao-erh Ho, and then advanced north-
ward along Nonni and terminated at Ch'i-ch'i-ha-erh. 
4. The West Foot Hill Trunk Line. It started from Peiping, 
crossing the Outer Mongolian deserts and terminated at Hailer. 
In summary, it is clear that most trunk routes were built from 
south to north. There were a number of east-west routes. All in 
all, there were roads leading to all directions in Manchuria. These 
roads contributed a good deal toward political and economic develop-
ment and also to trade with China proper and with oversea countries. 
Besides the four routes already mentioned, there was another between 
Peiping and Shen-yang via Lin-yu (Shan-hal-kuan), Chin-hsien and 
Hain-min. It runs from west to east. As far as military affairs, 
administration, and economic development are concerned, it is a 
route of foremost importance. It is the main artery between Inner 
China and Manchuria.

As the modern railway lines have been constantly improved 
with the advance of time, the usefulness of these lines has been 
greatly diminished. They have been reduced from main transportation 
lines to auxiliary ones. 
THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAYS 
Before the nineteenth century the Manchu Government restricted 
Chinese immigrants into Manchuria. Consequently, few Chinese en-
tered the forbidden place beyond the Chinese Great Wall. At the 
end of the nineteenth century when the ban was lifted, a great 
number of Chinese immigrants poured into Manchuria. They discovered 
that the resources there are much richer than those in China proper. 
Subsequently they started to devote themselves to agriculture, live-
stock raising and forestry. Roughly, 130 years ago (1820), Chinese 
immigrants established soybean oil pressing firms in Ying-ktou. 
When Ying-k'ou was opened for foreign trade in 1861, the staple pro-
ducts of Manchuria including tussah silk and soybeans gradually 
received high reputation in the world market and became international 
commodities. Ever since then Manchuria has captured much attention 
from China and the world. ' 
The construction of railways in Manchuria was first started in 
1893 when the British extended the Peking-Hukden Line beyond Shan-
hai-kuan, Five years later, Czarist Ru$sia constructed the Tung-chl-
ing Railway. The completion of the Tung-ch'ing Railway in 1920 
marked a great event in the history of transportation in Manchuria. 
The Peking-Nukden Railway line was extended into Manchuria in 
1894. In comparison with the first American railroad which was 
built from Stockton to Darlington in 1825, the Chinese undertaking 
occurred 71 years later. In comparison with the first Japanese 
railway line built from Tokyo to Yokomaha in 1872, the construction 
of the first railway in Manchuria took place twenty-two years later, 
and the first Chinese railway between Shanghai and Wu-sung was built 
eighteen years later in 1887. 
It has been more than fifty years since the first railway was 
built in Manchuria. Many political changes have taken place since 
then. The railways in Manchuria have made great contributions to 
the progress of trade and to the development of economic resources. 
It becomes necessary for those who want to make a study of the 
modern transportation system in Manchuria to begin with the study 
of the history of railway development in that area. For the sake 
of expediency, we will describe the development of transpo tation 
in Manchuria in three periods. 
I. The First Period: The Rivalry of Great Britain and Czarist 
Russia 
The first period which covers thirteen years was marked by the 
construction of the Peking-Mukden Line in Manchuria by the British, 
by the construction of the Tung-chling Railway by Czarist Russia

and by the founding of the Southern Manchuria Railway Company under 
Japanese control. The outstanding features in this period were the 
completion of the Tung-ch'ing Railway, the penetration into Manchuria 
by the Japanese after the Russo-Japanese War and the rivalries of 
Japan and Russia. 
To expand further and safeguard its military and political 
interests in Manchuria, Czarist Russia intended to put Manchuria 
within its sphere of influence. It planned to build a railway 
which would link Vladivostok, its only base in the Far East with 
the home country in the shortest possible distance. In 1896 by a 
secret agreement with the Manchu Government, the Russian Government 
acquired the right to build the Tung-ch'ing Railway (from Man-chou-li 
to Sul-fen-ho). In 1897 under the pretext that Germany had taken 
possession of Chin-u Wan, the Czarist Government forced the Manchu 
Government to sign a treaty by which it obtained the lease of the 
Liaotung Peninsula to Russia. By virtue of this treaty the Czarist 
Government acquired also the right to build a railway from Harbin to 
Dairen (the southern portion of the Chinese Ch'ang-chlun Railway). 
In 1898 the Russian Government sent a railway construction Corps to 
Harbin to build the Tung-ch'ing Railway and a line from Harbin to 
the west and to the south in the direction of Port Arthur and Dairen 
were built simultaneously. In 1901 2,400 kilometers of railways 
had been completed. All the newly completed railways were put into 
operation in 1903. 
To compete with Russian influences in Manchuria, Great Britain 
concluded a treaty with the Manchu Government to extend her line 
from Shan-hai-kuan to Mukden. Subsequently, there were many disputes 
? 
and conflicts between the Russians and the British regarding their 
rights and privileges in Manchuria. After consultations and compro-
mises between the two powers, Czarist Russia recognized the extension 
of the Peking-Mukden Line beyond Shan-hal-kuan as a right orthe 
British, and thereby allowed them to build the intended line. Thus 
the Peking-Mukden Railway's main line to Hsin-min and a branch line 
to Ying-klou were completed in 1903. 
From the above description it can be seen that at the beginning 
of the railway era in Manchuria the powerful Czarist Russia had been 
building the Chinese Eastern Railway for strategic reasons- while in 
the south the British had endeavoured to extend the Peking:-Mukden 
line for economic purposes. The two powers were opposing each other 
in Manchuria across the Liao Ho. Each of them tried its best to 
strengthen its influence in Manchuria. In 1904 Japan was at war 
with Russia. The Japanese constructed a light railway line from An-
tung to Mukden for military reasons. Later, on the basis of the 
Portsmouth Treaty, the Japanese acquired the rights for the Southern 
Manchuria Line from Ch'ang-ch'un (K'uanech'eng-tzu) to Fort Arthur 
and its branch lines. In 1907r the South Manchuria Railway Company 
was formed by the Japanese. After that Czarist Russia retreated to 
the north of Chtang-ch'un? while Japan began to take Russia's place 
in the south. Railways built at the later part of the first period 
are given in Table 2.

II. The Second Period: The Rivalries of China, Japan the Soria 
triiiaiWthe Russo-Japanese War 
The second period was classified to cover a quarter of a cen-
tury, starting from the formation of the South Manchuria Railway 
Company and ending with the Nukden Incident. There were three 
major events during this period. 
1. Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, posses-
sing respectively the Southern Manchuria Railway and the Chinese 
Eastern Railway became more critical; 
2. The United States showed its intention to share the 
rights of constructing railways in Manchuria; 
3, The Chinese Government started a movement to restore 
sovereignty, in railway construction and planned to build new lines 
to encircle the Southern Manchurian Railway. 
The first and the second events. took plade in the first half 
of this period. It should be pointed out that Japan had used the 
railways as bases to plot aggression which finally led jo the Nukden 
Incident. 
After it took over the control of the Southern Manchuria Rail-
way from Russia according to the Portsmouth treaty, Japan succeeded 
during the battles with Russia in building the An-tung-Mukden Line, 
thereby linking the line with the Peking-Mukden Line. In addition, 
JElpan built two railways: one between Chlang-chlun and Kirin and the 
other between Ssu-pling and T'ao-nan. 
During this period China, Russia, the United States, Britaid" 
and France had constantly made public their respective policies 
toward Manchuria. The U.S. for example: 1. proposed to buy the 
South Manchuria Railway Company; 2. announced the Open Door Policy 
and Equality of Opportunities; 3. proposed the neutralization of 
the Manchurian Railways; 4, asked for the right to build a rail-
way from Chin-chou to Ai-hui (Aigun). 
To counteract the above-mentioned policies and to strengthen 
its economic interests in Manchuria, Japan constructed local rail-
way lines. 
The description given above covers the first half of the second 
period., Thing the second half of the first period, the Chinese 
staitiiasedempaign to restore the rights they had lost. It was an 
anxious moment for the South Manchuria Railway Company. Since the 
conclusion of World War I, the principles of equality of nations 
and self-determination had been very popular. The complete control 
of railways in Manchuria by foreign powers was regarded as a humil-
iation and shame of the Chinese nation. As this kind of feeling 
was widespread in Manchuria, there arose the movement for restoring 
China's sovereignty. At that time the Manchurian Transport Committee 
had drafted plans for building three railways with Chinese capital 
and technique. They were:

3. The South Line: Chao-yang. - Ch'ih-feng - To,41tin 
It was due to the gradual implementation of these plans that 
transportation in Manchuria tas been developed into three networks: 
1. The Japanese South Manchuria Railway Network with Dairen 
AO itS-ceUter. ? 
2,, The Russian Chinese Eastern Railway Network with 
Yladivostok as its center. 
3. The Chinese Four East Railway and the Four West Railway 
Network with the Harbor of Hu-3.0-tao as its center. 
The construction of the Hu-lu-tao Harbor by China made the 
Japanese feel that their interests in Manchuria were threatened. 
Accordingly, Japan changed its policy in Manchuria from moderate 
penetration to aggressive attacks. This was indicated by the Mukden 
Incident. 
The following is an outline of the ManchurLin Railway trans-
portation system before the MUkden Incident,:

III. The Third Period:  (Under_ the Puppet Manchukuo RefilTel 
The Manchukuo regime was founded in March 1932 after the Mukden 
Incident in 1931. Consequently, All the railways formerly owned by 
foreign powers were taken over by the Japanese. With the exception 
Of the South Manchuria Railway, the North Manchuria Railway (formerly 
Chinese Eastern Railway) and some light railways, all the railways in 
Manchuria were nationalized and put under the control of the Ministry 
of Transportation. On 9 February 1933, the Manchukuo regime signed 
a contract with the South Manchuria Railway Company according to 
which the company would control the existing nationalized lines, the 
shipping enterprises along the Sungari River formerly owned by the . 
governMent, and new railway projects. In March 1935 the North Man-
churia Railway, which had been sold to Manchukuo by the Soviet Union, 
was also nationalized and put under the control of the South Manchuria 
Railway Company. Thus, all the railway lines in Manchuria were com-
pletely controlled by the SOuth Manchuria Railway Company. 
The condition of the railways under a single administrative 
system and after the outbreak of the World War 11 will be described 
later. In Short, the third period marks the highest stage of trans-
portation development with transportation facilities equal to modern 
standards. 
Railway transportation plays a very important part in culture, 
economy, industry, government administration, military affairs and 
national defense. It is of particular importance in view of the fact 
that Manchuria is rich in resources. The reason that Manchukuo had 
been'able to develop the resources in Manchuria was simply because it 
had an efficient railway system. Therefore, future Manchurian develop-
ment will depend, in a larger sense, upon the development of trans-
portation. Date on the railways built during the third period are as

BOOK II. TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES IN MANCHURIA 
I. HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION 
6.1221122,...LLievieE211LLHKTAELEmalimiik_ 
Highways are essential to a nation's military affairs, govern-
ment and economic development as the nerve system is to a human 
body. Not only are they closely connected with the living of human 
beings, but they also play a decisive role in shaping the destiny 
of a nation. All the political states which have risen and fallen 
in Manchuria during the past centuries did their best to develop 
highway transportation. Consequently, roads and highways in 
Manchuria have continued to grow since the beginning of the Chinese 
history. In the Yuan, Ming and Ch'ing dynasties there were postal 
station systems and official highways. Means of conveyance included 
horses, oxen, donkeys and wagons for land transportation and boats 
for river transportation. Even now many place names still have 
the names of the postal stations affixed to them. See the Map of 
Manchurian Transportation System Before the Construction of Rail-
ways in Book I. 
However, the highway system in Manchuria is still in a back-
ward stage in comparison with that of other countries. This is due 
to the following factors: 
1. Climate. Manchuria is dominated by a continental cli-
miate: cold in the winter and hot in the summer. The coldest period 
is between November and March during which the rivers, plains, 
mountains and fields are all covered by snow and ice. This creates 
very good roads. Furthermore, the volume of snowfall is comparatively 
small. Only 3 or 4 inches of snow cover the ground. In mountain 
areas the snow may accumulate to one foot deep. But this does not 
hinder transportation. On the contrary, it helps since the snow be-
comes frozen with the sweeping wind. In fact, the ice-frozen 
ground is suitable for sleighs. But in summer during the rainy 
season the roads become muddy, thereby creating difficulties for 
wagons and horses; while in the dry seasons the dust and dirt fly , 
sky-high whenever there is wind, making traveling the more diffi-
cult. Furthermore, the lack of bridges also makes river crossing 
a hazard. Thus transportation conditions are the worst in summer. 
Winter provides Manchuria with frozen natural roads. It is 
estimated that winter brings about 300,000 kilometers of frozen 
roads. Because of the emergence of good roads in the winter time, 
there is no urgent need for mad-made highways. 
2. Agriculture. Most of the cart drivers in Manchuria are 
farmers who utilize their carts for transporting goods in the 
winter time as a means to earn additional income. Since they are 
busy with farming in the summer, and have no time to transport goods, 
there is not a great demand for good roads in that season. More-
over, the low cost of horse-cart transportation in the winter is 
another factor causing merchants to transport goods in the winter 
time.

3. Social Stability. In the summer time the growing vege-
tation serves as a natural hiding place for bandit. Traveling in 
rural regions is dangerous in that season. This accounts for the 
small quantities of goods transported in the summer time. Hence 
there is no need to build good roads in the summer. 
4. Characteristics of the Horses. Horses bred in Manchuria 
are conditioned to cold rather than warm weather. Overwork in the 
summer would shorten their life. Thus, there no need for build-
ing good roads in summer time. 
S. Soils. Valleys of the two great rivers, the Sungari and 
the Liao, are mostly composed of alluvial soil. It is soft. Other 
regions are dominated by mountains and rivers. Therefore, bridge 
construction is very costly. In view of this, the governments in 
Manchuria hesitated to build bridges for fear they might increase 
the tax burden of the people. 
6. Politics. The highways and railways in Manchuria were 
built mainly for military uses. Not until modern times have there 
been highways, railways and ports for industrial uses. Since 
Manchuria had been free from numerous social uprisings and wars, 
and since the industry there was not highly developed, the develop-
ment of roads and railways for military and civilian uses was slow. 
In conclusion, the existence of poor roads and the indifferent 
attitude toward it on the part of the people are attributed to the 
backward culture and industrial development there and also to geo-
graphical and climatic factors. 
Section 2. A Classification of the Moans of Highway Transportation  
In Manchuria
Land transportation in Manchuria consisted miOstly of carts 
before the appearance of automobiles. The following is a descrip-
tion of various transportation means. (Automobile transportation 
will be dealt with in another chapter.) 
A. Passenger Transportation: 
1. Draft Animals. Horses, camels, donkeys and mules 
can be ridden and used for pulling wagons and carts. An ordinary 
horse is capable of traveling 120 kilometers per day. Ona long 
distance journey a cart owner refrains from overusing his horse 
and thus makes traveling average 60 kilometers daily. Camels are 
used for travel in Mongolian deserts. The average distance a camel 
can cover is not more than 40 kilometers. 
2. Sedan Chairs. Sedan chairs are mostly used in offi-
cial business, weddings, funerals, and various ceremonies. An 
ordinary sedan chair is carried on the shoulder by two, four, six 
or eight persons. Sedan chairs are used exclusively by rich and 
influential persons. Very rarely are they used by ordinary people. 
Sedan chair carriers can travel four kilometers a day.

3. The Sedan-Chair Cart. It is also known as "Small-Cart," 
It was the only means of transport in mountain areas before the 
constriction of railways in Manchuria. Besides the cart driver, 
there 4aa room for two persons in the sedan chair. Luggage was 
limited to 100 kilograms. It is pulled by one horse or donkey. 
Express and loni-distance carts required the use of two or three 
animals. The daily traveling mileage of the sedan-chair cart depends 
largely upon the season of the year and road conditions. In the 
Vonter when the roads are favorable for travelling, the daily travel-
ling mileage may be 50 to 60 kilometers. This kind of sedan-chair 
cart was very suitable for urgent travelling. 
Is. Mule Sedan Chair. A sedan chair was hauled by two 
mules travelling 60 kilometers daily. In the past this kind of 
sedan chair was widely used in Mongolia. It has become obsolete. 
5. Camel Wagon. This was a big wagon pulled by two 
camels and once popular in Mongolia. It has enough room for twp 
persons. Few people could afford wagons of this type, except the 
wealthy people. This kind of wagon has been rarely seen recently. 
Its daily mileage was 40 kilometers. 
6. Camel Sedan Chair. This was a kind of sedan ohairiused 
in Mongolia. Two sedan chairs were put on the back of the camel, one 
on each side. Each sedan chair had room for one person. Its daily 
mileage was 40 kilometers. It is very seldom used nowadays. 
7. Cave-Like Wagon. This is a vehiclefor both freight 
and passengers. It resembles a lirge freight wagon and travels at 
similar speed. 
8. Sledges. Sledges in various formslare used in the 
northern part of Manchuria where ice and snow are comparatively 
heavy and in the northeastern foeest region, The native type of 
Sledge is common in Kirin Province and the upper Sungari River. 
The sledge found along the lower Amur River is of the Russian type. 
It is larger than the native type and is composed of two rgmovable 
parts. A sledge is usually pulled by one or two horses. he maximum 
daily travel is 80 kilometers, while the average is 60 kilometers. 
There are not annyheavily. built large sledges in Manchuria. 
9, Russian-Type Carriage. This is drawn by one or two 
horses. The shape of the Russian-type carriage is somewhat like the 
European four-wheel carriage. There are some light carriages of 
the Russian type seen mostly in Harbin. The heavy-type carriage 
can be seen in the cities and towns in Manchuria. A carriage has 
room for two to four persons. 
10. Automobiles. Automobiles of American or European make 
have been very popular in Manchuria, since the cities in Manchuria 
arc modern cities with good roads. In city suburbs driving is more 
comfortable in the winter than in the summer because road conditions 
are better. Automobile,traffic in the large cities like Makden, 
Chlang-chiun, Dairen, Harbin, Chin-chou, Kirin is just as heavy as it 
is in the large cities in the world.

B. Means of Freight Transportation: 
There are several kinds of vehicles for freight transportation 
as follows (see Table 5 for detailed description): 
1. Wagons. In Manchuria, with the exception of Port 
Arthur, Dairen and Mongolia, freight is largely transported by 
wagons. In fact, roads in that area were developed mainly for 
wagons. Names of the wagons vary with their body structure and the 
number of animals in use. With their structure as a basis for clas-
sification there are three types of wagons: the }umber 1, the Number 
2 and the Number 3. On the basis of the number of animals there are 
the 10, the 7 and the 5 animal wagons. A wagon has wooden wheels 
with iron tires and wooden axles. The spokes of the wheel are not 
radial, but made with one vertical and two horizontal wooden bars. 
The wheels are usually fastened to the axle and move with it. 
2. Flor-wheel Wagon. The shape of the flower-wheel -tagon 
resembles the sedan-chair charriage while its body structure is 
similar to that of the wagon. There are fourteen or sixteen spokes 
radiating from the center of the wheel. The axles are made of metal 
or wood. This type of wagon is used mostly along the railways, 
especially in Shenyang and Changchun. 
3. Rubber-Tire Freight Cart. It uses air-filled rubber 
tires or solid rubber tires. It is a vehicle nearest to the modern-
ized means of conveyance. With Shenyang as a center it is used to 
transport goods to the cities in Manchuria. 
4. Improved Freight Cart. In 1938 the Manchukuo regime 
published a new design to standardize freight carts. The new 
design would result in better protection of the roads and in greater 
efficiency. There are radial spokes from the center of the wheel. 
They are clad with iron strips 7.5 millimeters in width. The body 
of the cart is of two kinds: one is made of wooden boards and the 
other made of steel bars. An improved freight car carries one to 
two tons. 
5. ox Cart. This is a cart which is usually pulled by one 
or two oxen. Its body and wheels are similar to those used in the 
wagons, the flower-sheel wagons, and the improved cart. It is 
commonly used by farmers in fen-chi and in Korea. It has a hauling 
capacity of 0.7 to 1.5 tons. In Mongolia there is the wooden, 
bulky and heavily built ox cart. The various types of ox carts 
will be discussed under the heading Wooden Cart. 
6. Sedan Chair. Besides being used for passenger trans-
portation, sedan chairs are also used in freight transportation 
because they are faster than ordinary 'wagons, 
7. The Wooden Cart. This is another name of the ox cart 
used in Mongolia. It includes two kinds: the White Awning and the 
Rolling Wheel.

a. White Awning Cart. This is usually pulled by one 
ox. Its structure is similar to that of the common wagon, although 
its construction is rather crude. All the components are made of 
wood except the wheel spokes which are made of iron. A man can 
drive a team of five or six carts. Here is how it works: one end 
of the rope is tied to the horn of the ox, while the other end of 
the rope is connected with the rear of a cart immediately before the 
ox. In this manner five or six carts may be controlled by one driver. 
The daily haulage of an ox cart is 25 kilometers in the summer time 
and 3 kilometers in the winter. A strongly built cart has a capacity 
of? 500 kilograms, while a small cart has a capacity of 150 kilograms. 
b. The Rolling-Wheel Type. There are two types of 
this cart: the four and the two wheel carts with wheels of varying 
size. The structure of this cart is similar to that of a flower-
wheel wagon, except that it is crude. West of the Hsing-an Mountains 
in the pasture land the nomads usually use horses to pull the carts 
instead of oxen. A horse-drawn cart is much faster than that pulled 
by an ox. The large-wheel carts are practically the only means of 
conveyance for the nomads. For example, the transport of tents, the 
taking up of water from wells and the collection of hay are all done 
by ox carts. The small-wheel carts are exclusively used for trans-
porting travelers. The four-wheel carts are generally common in the 
Hsing-an Mountains, Tsitsihar and Hal-ho. 
8. The Camel Cart. This kind of cart is very popular in 
Hai-la-erh and Man-chou-li. There are two types: the four-wheel 
and the two-wheel types. The four wheel type is more useful than the 
two-wheel type. Loading of the two-wheel cart is difficult because 
the back of the camle is too high and the angle between the base of 
the cart and the camel is too steep. The hauling capacity of a camel 
cart is around 500 kilograms, while its average speed is 50 kilo- . 
meters per day.. In Chin-chou? Hsi-hal-10o% Ch'ih-feng, Lin-hsi and 
Mai-lu? where the terrain is dominated by mountains and rivers, it 
is necessary to use camels as draught animals. Camel haulage depends 
largely on the distance. 'hen the distance is short, (a 20-day 
journey) a camel carried 150 kilograms. but when the distance is long 
(50 or 100 days) it carries usually 206 kilograms 51E7. 
9. Four-Wheel Cart. There are two types of these carts: 
The Japanese type and the Russian type. Carts used in Dairen, Port 
Arthur, Ying-ktou and Liao-yang are of the Japanese type. The two 
front wheels in the Japamese type are smaller than the rear ones. 
It is usually pulled by a he, hauling 1,000 kilograms. The 
Russian type is popular north of Ch'ang-chrun and in Harbin and 
particularly along the Chinese-Russian border. The structure of the 
Russian type' is similar to the Japanese type. The only difference is 
that they are built stronger than the Japanese type. In addition, 
the wheels are removable from the body. The body of the cart may be 
changed according to the goods to be hauled. For example, in trans-
porting goods within a city, a flat-car-type body is used and pulled. 
by one horse. When coal, sand, and farm produce are to be transported 
the cart body is built like a gondola car. When used for hauling 
timber, no body structure is atop the wheels. Thus the haulage of 
a four-wheel cart varies with its body construction. The horse used 
for hauling is usually the tall, Russian breed type.

10. Sledges. Since a sledge is made by very primitive 
methods, it cannot haul as much as wagons can, which is more than 
2,500 kilograms at one time. However, a sledge hauled by one horse 
can carry 500 kilograms of goods and still travel at top speed. A 
sledge drawn by one horse can carry the same amount of goods as a 
wagon hauled by three or four horses, since the speed of a sledge is 
70 to 100 percent faster than the wagon. However, sledges can be 
used in the winter only and in the ice-bound areas north of Kirin. 
U. Truck. Truck transportation is popular mainly in 
cities and towns along the railways. Recently, trucks have also 
been used in the countryside during the winter. When the Manchurian 
economy is prosperous and the roads are improved, truck transportation 
will have a bright future. Amore comprehensive analysis of truck 
transportation will be given in the latter part of the book. 
In short, there is a great variety of means of transportation 
in Manchuria of which the horse wagon is the most popular. Other 
means of conveyance are, used only locally. This conclusion serves 
as a basis upon which we proceed to analyze the transportation 
situation in Manchuria.

1. Number of Freight Carts. The freight cart is a vehicle. 
most frequently used in Manchuria. Because of the lack of statistics 
it is difficult to ascertain the exact number of carts in Manchuria. 
The South Manchuria Railway Company, by using various methods deocrib-
ed"below, estimated that there were 400,000 darts in Manchuria In 
1928.-

2. Another estimate of the number of carts in cultivated 
areas was made. In 1925 and 1926 the area of arable land in Man-
churia was 19,8650000 hsiang (one hsiang equals ten mou or roughly 
two acres.) Assuming there was one cart for every 50 hsiang in an 
area of 19,865,000 hsiang there were 400,000 carts. 
3. One may also estimate the number of carts from the 
population of Manchuria. In 1925 and 1926 the population was 
26,080,000. It was assumed that in large cities every one hundred 
persons had one large freight cart (identical with the conclusion 
reached in the surveys conducted in Dairen ahd other large cities in 
Manchuria) and that in villages every thirty persons has a freight 
cart. In other words we assume that 65 persons have a freight cart. 
Thereforeothe number of carts was 400,000. 
L. The number of carts may also be estimated from the 
number of draught animals. The ratio of carts to draught animals 
varied with provinces.

On the basis of thejOer,Methods listed above it was not diffi-
cult to come to the conelmi9ieHthat the freight carts in Manchuria 
in 1925 or 1926 wasToughly.400,000. .Ten years later in 1936 the 
Manchukuo regime made,S-fisld survey and came up with the number as 
being 434,420. Of this figure 347,841 were horsecarts and 86,579 ox 
carts. At the end oflightweight carts were estimated at 817,340. 
Of this figure 800,000 .were horsecarts. The nuMber of oxcarts, horse-

III Transporting Efficiency of Freight Carts. Transporta-
tion efficiency is estimated on the basis of local capeity, haulage 
arid speed. 
1. The Loading Capacityi This depends upon the season 
of the year, the types of goods transported and the condition- of the 
roads. !"nr ax example, if there are two carts, one carrying soy-
beans, moving along the mountainous roads from Mukden to An-tung, 
while the other moven from Mukden to Tsitsihar on the flat Manchurian 
plain, their load capacities are of course different. 
2. Haulage: The hauling capacity varies with the road 
conditions, the number of horses in use, and the types of goods to 
:be hauled and the skill of the driver.

3. The Traveling Speed: The speed is dependent upon 
the weight of the load, the number of horses used and the conditions 
of the reads. The average speed of horsecarts in Manchuria is four 
:kilometers per hour. In the winter time the speed can be increased 
to five kilometers per hour. 
This is roughly the efficiency of the horsecarts in Manchuria. 
A further analysis of its efficiency under various types of terrain 
is as follows: 
0-ee table 8 on following pagg 
Section 4. Accomplishments of Horsecart Transportation 
What has been said above is a general description of the roads 
in Manchuria and also of the horsecart transportation'. This chapter 
deals with the significance of land transportation in Manchuria with 
special emphasis on the development of natural resources. 
A. Horsecart Transportation As 'a Substitute for Rail 
ways. The transport of goods by horsecarts has been more and more 
popular as the frontier lands were gradually opened. Take, for 
instance, horsecart transportation around Tsitsihar before the con-
struction of the Peking-Mukden Line and the Chinese Eastern Railway. 
At that time horsecarts made full use of the winter roads. They 
transported goods along the Kirin National Highway to Tlao-nan? Hsin-
min T'un and Hu-lan. Goods transported included cereals from Sui-hua? 
Hu-lan, Pa-yen and A-shih-ho and textiles and sundries from Peiping, 
Mukden and Ying-k'ou. Horsecart traffic between Mukden and Peiping, 
between Mukden and Port Arthur, between Mukden and Kirin was as heavy 
as the present day railway traffic. In southern Manchuria there were 
360 kilometers of horsecart roads between Mukden and Lin-chiang; 300 
kilometers between Klai-yuan and Meng-chiang; and 400 kilometers be-
tween Kirin and Yen-chi. In the North Manchuria there were 270 kilo-
meters of roads between Harbin and Klo-shan and 600 kilometers between 
Tsitsihar and Hei-ho. 
Most of the transportation business in Manchuria was operated 
by farmers simply because they could make use of? the draught animals 
in their possession. Furthermore, farming was a profession which gave 
them leisure time for going into the transportation business. Thus 
they could afford to charge a low freight rate. This explains why 
horsecart transportation had become a rival to rail transportation. 
B. Competition Between Horsecarts and Railways in 
Manchuria: In the past, because of the low efficiency of the rail-
ways, the lack of enough freight cars and the high freight rates, 
even long-distance freight transportation was handled by horsecarts. 
Two factors accounted for the horsecart's ability to compete with the 
railways:

1. Low Cost. As mentioned before farmers engaged 
in horsecart transport as a supplementary occupation. Thus it was 
not uncommon that a farmer was satisfied with a fee that merely 
covered the cost of feeding the draught animals. In other words, 
there was a greater elaftivity in formulating the charges. 
2. Safety. Horsecart transport was safe. Mer-
chants who wanted their goads transported needed only to tell the 
transport agencies which in turn contacted the cart drivers and 
made the deals. If the merchants found the drivers suspicious, they 
might ask for references to find some guarantee or sureties. Mean-
while, the traveling armed guard system and the insurance system 
were simple to use but offered good protection on the highways. 
During World War I (1914 to 1920) there existed a serious cm-
petition between the railways and carts in areas south of the Chinese 
Eastern Railway. Before 'World *War I horsecart transport in areas 
along the Chinese Eastern Railway 'had not teen highly developed. 
As soon as the war broke out, all sorts of 'cars of the Chinese East-
ern Railway were used for military transportation, resulting in the 
accumulation of goods at the railway stations. Merchants suffered 
serious losses because of the tie-up. Since they deeply felt the

need for long-distance horsecart transportation, they organized an 
aesbciation? mobilized draught animals and handled freight traffic 
between Ch'ang-ch'un and Harbin and between An-ta, Ch'i-ch'i-ha-erh 
and Chlang-ch'un. The sharp rise in railway freight charges in 1919 
by the Chinese Eastern Railway increased tremendously the de:aand for 
horsecarts. 
Since the autumn of 1920 the Chinese Eastern Railway had very 
slow business because of the competition from horsecarts. In Dec-
ember 1920 about 44,722 metric tons of cereals were transported south-
ward by carts as compared with 18,722 tons by railways. In January 
1921 cereals transported by carts amounted to 73,111 metric tons, 
while those handled by the railways were 20,342 tons. In February 
1921 the carts transported 35,242 metric tons of goods, while the 
railways transported less than 29,610 metric tons. On returning trips, 
the carts carried northward 150 metric tons of goods per day. From , 
these figures listed above, it is obvious that horsecart transportation 
played a dominant role in Manchuria's transportation system. 
The chief reason for the cart owners to charge very low fees in 
comparison with that charged by the railways was that in 1920 and 
1921 there had been serious famines in Shantung Province. A great 
number of refugees migrated to Manchuria which resulted in an execssive 
supply of labor, and therefore in very low wages. Furthermore, it was 
at this critical period that the railways raised their freight schedules 
several times. The suprisingly high freight rate by rail naturally 
encouraged the merchants to employ horsecarts. 
Let's now look into the freight charges in 1919. At that time 
the charge for 30 tons of goods between Harbin and Ch'ang-ch'un by 
rail was 600 to 1,000 yuan while it was Wo to 900 yuan by horse-
cart. In 1920 the railways charged 390 to 530 yuan, while the horse-
carts charged 280 to 430 yuan for the same amount of goods. This 
factor alone obviously led to the rapid growth of horsecart trans-
port trade. But there were additional factors as described below: 
1. At that time the Chinese Eastern Railway lacked 
sufficient freight cars. Merchants had to bribe the railway officials 
with much money to obtain freight quotas. Even then the freight 
took at least a month to reach its destination as compared with eight 
days if horsecarts were ased. 
2. The Chinese Eastern Railway did not exercise good 
care in handling goods. Commodities were often damaged. 
34 The Chinese Eastern Railway lacked waterproof cloths. 
Merchants were required- to furnish them at their own expense., 
4. Shippers were required to go through red tape and 
repair any damaged packages before they were admitted to the railway 
warehouses. 
S. Before agricultural products were admitted to the 
SouthManchuria.Railway Company for safekeeping, there were consider-
able warehouse expenses to be paid.

What has been said above is the main reason that theinerchants 
preferred carts to railways in transporting goods to the south. 
Indeed, horsecart transport trade has made a great contribution to 
Manchuria's transportation system. It was not until the Chinese 
Eastern Railway and the South Manchuria Railway Company lowered 
their freight rates and improved the management of freight traffic 
that horsecart trade began to decline.

All these data prove the strength of the horsecart transport 
trade which enabled it to compete with the railways. 
O. Relation Between Horsecart and Railway Transportation, 
In Manchuria horsecarts were used to transport farm products to rail-
way stations. They carried mainly daily necessities on their return-
trips. This has been so for a long long time. Thus, except for 
huge amounts of goods which must be handled by railways, the trans-
port of small amounts of goods for short distal?es is handled mostly 
by horsecarts. It is clear that the horsecarts supplemented the 
function of railways. 
There are two destinations to which farm products are trans-
ported by horsecarts: one is the railway stations where farmers 
sell direct and the other is the market places in towns and cities. 
The volume of freight destined for the railway stations is usually 
smaller than that destined for the market places since the distance 
between the production area and the stations is much longer. 
Horsecart transport trade is active between September and April 
of the following year. Of these months November to January are the 
most prosperous. After January the business becomes slow. In the 
summer time, because of the road conditions and of the hign cost of 
transportation, very few farm products are transported by horsecarts.

II. WATERWAY TRANSPORTATION 
Section 1. A General estion of the -Transportation in 
Manchuria 
There is a Chinese proverb Which says that "Rivers and streams are 
the womb of civilization." Certainly, there is some truth in it. History 
proves that rivers and streams have been the nursery beds of civilization. 
This applies to China and to any country. On the other hand, modern 
civilization has added much progress to inland river transportation. Take 
the geography of Manchuria as a subject for discussion. Since there are 
rivers running in all directions, Manchuria has been renowned for its 
long history of inland river navigation. For instance, the cities of 
Chiulien-ch'eng and Chi-an along the Ya-lu Ho, Liao-yang and other cities 
along the Fu-tai-tzu Ho are reported to have had inland river navigation 
in the Han Dynasty. Niu-chuang of Hai-chleng Hsien and the city of 
Tung-ching along the MU-tan River are recorded as having had a prosperous 
inland river traffic under the Empire of Po Hai in the Tlang Dynasty. In 
the Sung and Chin dynasties A-ch'eng along the b-shih Ho, Wur].a-chieh and 
Po-tU-na (Fu-yu) along the Sungari River are reported to have been 
prosperous river ports. In the Ming Dynasty there were shipbuilding 
yards in Kirin Province. Hui-ning and Ch'ing-hsing located along the 
Till-men River had been opened as ports as early as the Ming Dynasty. The 
examples listed above are taken from ancient hooks on geography and 
history. 
In the Ch'ing Dynasty, inland river navigation had been best 
developed in the sputhern part of the Liao River Valley. The next would 
be the navigation of the Yalu and the Tlu-men rivers. However, the rivers 
and streams in the southern part of Manchuria are only deep enough for 
small boats. Accordingly, the volume of transportation is limited. Along 
the Amur River in North Manchuria it is recorded that sLnce the first 
appearance of a Russian steamer in 1854 the number of steamers has increased 
yearly. In 1872 there were 10 steamers. The Russian steamers sailed up 
the Sungari purely for expedition or for small-scale trade. In 1898 when 
the Russians made tremendous uses of Sungari navigation for the transporta-
tion of roughly 6500000 metric tons of railway-building materials, for the 
construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the navigation achieved an 
unprecedented prosperity. The railway materials were transported from 
European Russia to Vladivostok by sea. Then, the Russians used the Ussuri 
Railway, built in 1897, to ship the materials to Khabarovsk and Iman. 
From there 18 river steamers, four small steamers, and 60 sampans were 
used for transporting the materials first along the Amur River and then 
along the Sungari River to Harbin. 
Another outstanding event was the completion of the Chinese Eastern 
Railway, the Ussuri Railway and the Amur Railway. Not only did the 
completion of these railways create favorable conditions for the exploita-
tion of the natural resources in areas along the rivers and railways, 
but it also changed the outlook of the navigation of the three rivers, the 
Amur, the Sungari and the Ussuri. In fact, the foundation of modern inland 
river navigation in that area was built with the completion of the railways 
mentioned above.. 
All of the materials used for the building of steamers came from 
Europe to the shipbuilding yards located in Iman, Khabarovsk, 
Blagoveshchensk, Nipuchu, and Harbin. Occasionally there were a few

the Amur Region through the Okhotsk Sea. Sailboats and tugboats in-
creased,in great number. All of the shipbuilding yards located along 
the coast were doing their best to produce boats. 
The Sungari, Amur, and Ussuri rivers are main waterways for inland 
river navigation in :Manchuria. Among the three the Sungari River Rates 
first in importance. at is recalled that in 1858, according to the Aigun 
Treaty, Czarist Russia obtained the rights of navigation along the Sungari 
River. Slibsequentlysnavigation along the three rivers mas controlled 
exclusively by Czarist Russia. All boats sailing on the rivers belonged 
to Russia. There were several dozen boats. Although the Chinese had 
started their navigation as early, as 1907, the number of boats they had 
was so anall that it could hardly coMpare to that owned by Russia. After 
the Russian Revolution in 1917 the rights of navigation became the focus 
of disputes between Russia and China. For the purpose of safeguarding 
the sovereignty of China, the Chinese Government had issued an order in 
-1907 to ban navigation of Russian boats between Sungari, Kirin and Lao-
ehao-kou. In 1924 Chinese restriction was further enlarged to exclude 
:the Russians from all the rivers, including those rivers in the territory 
of the Chinese Eastern Railway. As a result, the Russian ship owners 
competed with each other to sell their ships to the Chinese. In 1926 
then the Chinese Government with great determination took over all the. 
piers, the Sungari navigation came once more under Chinese contra. 
Subsequently, the Chinese Government established the Northeast Navigation 
Bureau for controlling and operating the boats confiscated. The shipping 
agencies also included the Northeast Shipyard, the Kuang-hsin Navigation 
Office, the Sungari and Amur Postal Boat Bureau, the Northeast Commercial 
Navigation School, the Harbin Navigation Bureau and the River Conservation 
Bureau. At that time there were 40 boats under the control of the Chinese 
Government. The total tonnage was 14,308 long tons.-
At the time of the Maden Incident there were more than 120. boats 
sailing along the Sungari River. The tonnage which has been ascertained 
was more than 30,000 tons. This included about 1,500 tons of large 
steamers. ? 
A detailed description of the three river systems, the Liao Ho 
system; the Sungari, Amur and Ussuri river systems; and the Ya-lu Ho 
eystem, will be given in the following sections. Table 12 shows the 
names of the principal rivers in Manchuria.

Section 2. Transportation Along the Liao Hee  
A. The Characteristics of Liao Ho Navigation: The Liao Ho comes 
from the high plateau in western Inner Mongolia, In Manchuria it flows 
in a north-south direction through the south Manchurian plain and enters 
into the Po Hai at Ying-k'oe. Along the banks of the Liao soils are 
fertile end agricultural crops are abundant. The population there is 
heavily concentrated. The main course of the Liao Ho is 1,300 nautical 
miles or roughly 2,500 kilometers. From Ying-k'ou to Cheng-chia-t'un 
493 nautical miles or roughly 900 kilometersare navigable. There are 
numerous large and small sailboats operating between the two ports. From 
Yingkow upstream to Tien-chuang-t'ai there are 35 kilometers navigable 
for steamboats. The tributaries of the Liao, like the Tlai-tzu Ho and 
the Hun Ho, are navigable to some extent, but no prospects of further 
development are expected. The navigation characteristics of the Liao 
River are as follows: 
1. Soils in the area along the upper part of the Liao River are 
composed of sand an mud. The river banks are often washed off or immersed 
in the river. Thus the Liao River forms a snake-like curved line, 
constitution an obstacle to navigation. 
2. Most of the rivers in Manchuria are shallow. This makes 
navigation very difficult? But the Liao Ho is deep enough for navigation. 
Even when a boat is stuck in the sand it will float again when the sand 
is washed away by the current, 
3. The volume of water of the Liao Ho is rather small, but it 
varies greatly with the seasons. This is due to the fact that there are 
forests near the sources of the river. At the time the volume of water 
is contracted, sailing is difficult. This is particularly true in the 
cases of the T'ai-tzu Ho and the Hun Ho. 
4. The water level of the Liao Ho is affected by tides. When-
ever the tide rises, navigation may be extended for 66 miles beyond 
Tiou-tlai-tzu. When the tide reaches its climax, navigation along the 
course of the Liao may be further extended for ten miles. Both the 
Tlai-tzu Ho and the Hun Ho are particularly subject to the influences of 
tides. 
5. At Erh-lang-tung located along the main course of the Liao 
River, a part of the Liao River flows into Shus-i-tzu Ho. Because of the 
resulting decrease in its volume, it is very difficult for a boat to sail 
between Erh-lang-tung and San-cha-ho. To overcome this difficulty, the 
Liao River Engineering Bureau spent a great amount of money in 1928 to 
build a canal linking Erh-tao-ch'iao-tzu of the Shuang-tlai-tzu Ho with 
Chia-hsin-tzu, a place located six miles below San-cha-ho. The length of 
the canal is 14 miles. As the situation exists today, there are two 
routes of different length linking Erh-lang-tung and Chia-hsin-tzu. One 
is the main course of the Liao Ho, 29.1 miles long, while the other is 
through the newly constructed canal, 24 miles long. 
The distance between Erh-lang-tung, where a part of the Liao Ho 
flows into the Shuang-t'ai-tzu Ho, and the mouth of the Liao Ho is 95 
miles, while that between Erh-lang-tung and the month of the Shuang-t'ai-
tzu Ho is 45 miles. Because the river bed of the Shuang-t'ai-tzu Ho is 
at a lower level it takes up most of the waters from the Liao Ho leaving 
little water for the lower parts of the Liao Ho. In view of this, a dam

Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
380 meters long with seven gates was constructed at Erh-tao-ch'iao-tzu 
for the purpose of controlling the water volume of both the Liao and the 
Shuang-ttai-tzU Ho. In addition, on the right bank of the Shuang-tlai-
tzu Ho there is a lock with three gates serving as the passage for boats. 
These gates can be opened and closed to facilitate the movements of 
boats* Under ordinary conditions, the dam is opened four hours daily so 
the water level of the Shuang-ttai-tzu Ho will rise to facilitate the 
passage of sailboats at Pan-shan. When the dam is closed, the water 
level in the Liao Ho increases one meter in dry seasons, and increases 
roughly 3 meters in rainy seasons. 
B. Navigation Along the Liao Ho, Types of Boats and Number of 
Boats. 
1. Navigation Along the Liao River: 
Because of the characteristics mentioned above,' only one 
third of the river is navigable. Its navigable season.lasts eight 
months, from March to December. The water level of the Liao Ho reaches 
a maximum height in July and August of the Chinese calendar* reaches a 
fair height in March and April and declines to a very low point in the 
freezing season. The rise and fall of the water level accordingly affects 
the navigation between certain points along the river. 
2. Types of Boats Sailing on the Liao Ho 
a. Steamers* In the past there was a 23-ton steamer, the 
Jui-hsing, which operated between iing-k'ou and Tien-chuang-ttai. It was 
a passenger boat carrying 10,000 to 30,000 passengers from April to 
NoveMber. 
b. Barges. Barges were used in thetransportation of goods 
between Ying-ktou and Tien-chuang-t'ai and between Tien-chuang-tlai and 
Hopei. Sometimes they sailed to Tientsin or to Shantung. Most of them 
were used by the oil pressing shops and grain dealers. 
c. Sailing Boats. Sailing boats were often used in the 
transportation of goods along the Liao River. The boats are square-
shaped with flat bottoms and sails, Their freight capacity was from 50 
to 105 tan. They usually carried 80-90 tan. Sincetheir draught is 
greater than that of the ox-boat, they sail mostly in waters south of 
the Chu-liu Hoe 
d. Oxe;boats. There is no furndamental difference in 
structure between a sailing boat and an ox-boat. Since its cost of 
construction is lower and its operation easier due to its light draught, 
the ox-boat is. popular in the upper parts of the Liao Ho and its 
tributaries, Its load capacity varies from 30 tan to 90 tan. Ordinarily 
it carries 60-70 tan. 
e. Sampans. These are in most cases used in the neighbor-
hood of Ying-ktoe. The load capacity of a sampan is usually around 1,000 
kilogrems. Sampans are operated by ()are or by sails. 
f. Small Barges. They are used either as ferries or in 
short-distance freight transportation. If a large quantity of goods were 
to be transported, two of them would be tied together with the decks 
covered with wooden boards. They are handy vessels.

3. Number of Boats and Crafts 
As already mentioned above, transportation in Manchuria 
before the construction of railways depended largely on the Liao River. 
Thus the Liao River had made great contributions to the economic develop-
ment in Manchuria. Although there Aere no accurate records concerning 
the number of boats on the Liao Ho, the river traffic was believed to be 
heaviest before the Russo-Japanese War. It is estimated that the number 
of boats on the Liao Ho at that time w as more than ten thousand. Sub-
sequently, the number decreased greatly. In 1909 the Customs Office of 
Ying-klou licensed 4,580 vessels. The number of boats operating in 1923 
is given in Table 15.

C. Effects of Railways on the Navigation of the Liao Ho 
It is true that the Liao Ho has made a great contribution to 
the development of transportation in Manchuria. Since the Peking-
Mukden Line, the South Manchuria Line, the Seu-peing-chieh--Cheng-chia-
ttun Line, the Cheng-chia-tlun--Tung-liao Line, and the Mukderk-Hailang 
Line were completed, the importance of the Liao navigation has been 
greatly reduced. This was due to the fact that the South Manchuria 
Railway Company used Dairen as a center and adopted a low-rate policy 
for competing with the inland shipping along the Liao Ho. In the mean-
time, the prosperity of Iing-klou was greatly affected. Furthermore, 
the failure to dredge the river made navigation along the Liao Ho ex.' 
tremely hazardous. It was full of rocks and sand. Banditry was also 
another obstacle to traveling by boat. Consequently, the namber of 
vessels decreased yearly. Along the tributaries of the Liao Hos:such 
AS the Him Ho and the T'ai-tzu Ho, there were only two or three boats 
eparating at flood seasons only. The prosperity of the old days has 
gone. 
The reasons for the decline of the Liao Ho navigation are 
summarized as follows: 
1. Adverse effects of the railways in Manchuria, inland 
river navigation declined sharply. Inland water navigation with. Ying-
k'ou as its center could hardly compete with railway transportation 
.With the, ort of Dairen as its center. 
2. Lack of dredging. South of the middle course of the 
Liao Ho only light repair work had been done under the direction of the 
Engineering Bureau. North of the middle course no dredging has been 
done. As time passed the sand and mud accumulated at the bottom of the 
river and made navigation very difficult. 
3. Lack of modernized vessels. Most of the boats and 
crafts operating on the -rivers and streams in Manchuria have been 
constantly improved for greater efficiency except those on the Liao Ho. 
Vessels operating on the Liao Ho are almost exclusively sailboats. Their 
capacity is small while their operating expenses are high. Sailing takes 
more time because the boats in use are not propelled by motor. All this 
accounts for the high transportation cost along the Liao Ho. In short, 
shipping facilities in the Liao Ho do not meet modern standards. 
I. Unreliable service and lack of working capital. As an 
established practice, ship operators are liable for the loss of goods 
they transport. However, most of them failed in this because of in-
sufficient capital. Frequent disputes reSulted. Furthermore, the long 
voyages and the lack of working capital on the part of the operators 
created trouble en route. Consequently, most of the merchants mere very 
cautious and seldom used river transportation.

5. Banditry. Social order in the Liao 4o area was bad. 
Bandits and robbers frequently attacked from ambush. Normal life was 
disturbed. Under such circumstances, moral Standards of the local 
populace became lower and lower. All this constitutes a menace to boat 
travel. 
6. Shift of trade routes. Most of the imported goods. are 
discharged at Dairen instead of Ying-k'ou. The result is that business 
in Ying-klou has declined. What makes the situation worse is that few 
daily necessities are transported by ship. Thus many merchants have 
shifted their headquarters from Ying-kiou to Mukden and Dairsa. 
Data in Tables 16 and 17 show the sharp decline in river traffic at 
Cheng-chia-tiun in 1918 after the opening of the Ssu-cheng Railway. ? 
From the figures given in Tables 16 and 17, it can be seen that in 
1914, 70 percent of the crop exports from Cheng-chia-ttun was handled 
through the waterways, while 30 percent was transported by carts. When 
the Ssu-plino-chieh-Cheng-chia-tiun Railway was put into. oration in 
1918, carts were no longer used, while the waterways and the railways 
handled respectively one half of the traffic. In 1919 most of the ex-
ports were handled by the railway administration with 3.5 percent 
handled by boat. In 1914 56 percent of the daily necessities incoming 
to Cheng-chis041Un were transported by boat as compared with 8 percent 
in 1919 after the railway from Ssu-Wing-chieh to Pheng-chia-teun ASO 
opened. 
The advantages and disadvantages of river transportation and of 
railway transportation are as follows.

a Freight charges and other expenses are lower. 
b. No maximum or minimum limits on freight quantity. 
2. Disadvantages 
a. It takes more time than by 
b. Navigation on the Liao Ho is difficult since it has 
not been dredged for a considerable time. 
? c. There are not enough sailboats. Vessels now available 
are small in capacity and thus cannot handle large amounts of freight 
on one voyage. 
d. The operators of the vessels lacked a sense of 
responsibility in offering their services. 
el. Banditry is a threat to boat travel. 
It was due to the facts listed above that river transportation 
could not compete with railways. 
D. Goods Transported Along the Liao Ho 
The transport of goods downstream along the Liao Ho to Ying-ktou 
by okboat or sailboat is known as Ho-tai or "river transportation." The 
so-called Wai-tai or outgoing freight refers to the transport of goods in 
the Tung-h7-krjrand Sane-chiang-ktou areas, while Li-tai refers to the 
river traffic in Hun-hop Tho-yang-ho and south of 71I3tiur-ho. The types, 
of goods transported are given as follows: 
1. Goods transported downstream along the Liao Ho: 
Goods transported downstream to Ting-ktou and localities 
near the railways include kaoliang, soybeans, barley, wheat, sesame. 
They also include soybean oils bean cakes and wine. 
2. Goods transported upstream along the Liao Ho: 
They include mostly the products of the neighborhood of 
YingHktou like salt, reed mats, cooking pans, and crude potteries. The 
amount or goods trancported upstream along the Liao Ho is small.

A. The Characteristics of Navigation Along the Sungari 
The Sungari River, the biggest river in Manchuria, originates 
from the Tlien Ch'ih in the Chlang-pai Shan. It flows along the gorges 
of the Chlang?pai Shan, and traverses the northwest plains of Manchuria* 
After it meets the Nonni River, it flows in a northeast direction, flank?
ing the big town of Harbin. The Sungari River is about 1,927 kilometers 
long. The Sungari River area has been known for its fertile soils and 
rich agricultural, forestry, and mining resources which are vital to the 
improvement and development of the local economy. The principal 
characteristics of the Sungari River are as follows: 
1. The climate in Manchuria is dominantly a continental 
climate. The temperature, the atmospheric pressure, the rainfall, 
snowfall, the direction of the wind, the thawing and freezing of the 
river are all factors which play a decisive role in navigation. During 
a period of six months from November to April, the temperature is 
constantly below zero. The long winter freezes the rivers and streams 
and brings the river traffic to a halt. The navigation season lasts 
only seven months. In the remaining five months ship operators spend 
their time repairing and overhauling their ships. The duration of the 
navigation season along the Sungari River near Harbin is shown in 
Table 19.

2. The Sungari River has a more abundant Supply of water 
since its source is .a. forest region having a greater rainfall and 
situated on a higher plateau. However, the volume of the Sungari is 
subject to great changes because ofrain and snow. 
At the beginning of the navigation season When ice breaks 
and melts, the water level of the Sungari is high. But after the ice has 
melted completely, the water level goes down very rapidly. This is a 
natural phenomenon. The Sungari anda number of Ober rivers and streams 
flow in a northward direction. The rivers begin to thaw from their upper 
courses in the south. However, the increased water volume due to thawing 
of ice and snow is often obstructed by the half-frozen ice in the lower 
cause, resulting in the temporary rise in the water level. If there is 
4 great difference in the temperatures of the upper and of the lower 
courses of the Sungari, the water level will increase greatly during the 
thawing period. On the other hand, if the temperatures in the upper and 
lower courses are about equal, the water level will decrease rapidly and 
navigation is difficult. An icebound river may thaw gradually, or rapidly. 
The gradual melting of be is called by natives "gentle thawing," while 
the rapid melting is called "militant-like thawing." 
Since the increased volume of water gradually flows away 
after the ice melts, the water level of the Sungari becomes very low and 
renders sailing very difficult in late June and in early July. The water - 
level becomes very high in the rainy season of July and August but drops 
to a low mark and even ends navigation in September and October. 
3. The banks of the Sungari are completely composed of sands 
and clay. There are Almost no rocks at all. This is why it is so easy 
for the currents to cause the collapse of the banks. In addition, because 
of erosion and accumulation of sand and mud from its tributaries, there 
are numerous shoals in the Sungari which are dangerouato navigation. 
Among the shoals and sandy bars the Shoal of San-hsin located 315 to 342 
kilometers northeast of Harbin is the biggest. It is 27 kilometers long. 
The water depth there averages 3 or 4 meters. It is only 1.5: meters 
deep in some places. Since dredgings has been done, and buoys have been 
established, danger is minimized so that boats may even be operated at 
night. 
4. The Feng-man Dam in Kirin was built to utilize the rich 
hydro-electric resources of the Sungari. The reservoir demonstrates that 
the water flaw in the lower parts of the Sungari can be kept under control. 
In fact, it has eliminated floods, minimized the possibility of river 
freezing in dozens of miles in the lower parts of the river and facilitated 
the navigation of boats And craft.

B. Survey of Navigation of the Sungari River and Types of Boats 
and Crafts 
1. Navigation. Navigation is possible between the mouth of 
the Sungari. River and Kirin, a distance of 1,332 kilometers. However, 
conditions of navigation vary in different parts of the river. Naviga-
tion in the lower parts (from Harbin down) is the easiest of all. Al-
though the middle course is suitable for navigation between its con-
fluence with the Nonni River and Harbin, night sailing is hazardous 
because of inadequate traffic facilities and the length of time in-
volved. Navigation along the upper parts of the Sungari in the 
Manchurian plain, between Lao-shao-kou on the Chinese Chiang-ch'un 
Railway and the confluence of the Nonni Railway and the Sungari, is most 
difficult* In flood season boats can sail between Kirin and Lao-shao-
kou, but when floods recede, all river traffic comes to an end in the 
upper parts of the Sungari near Kirin. However, navigation is possible 
again in the upper parts beyond Kirin with the help of the Feng-nan Dam. 
The dam facilitates the floating of timber particularly. 
Among the navigation sections mentioned above those between 
Harbin, Lienchiang-ktou, Chia-mu-esu, Fu-chin and Tiung-chiang are most 
suitable for navigation. The river along these port cities varies from 
200 to 300 meters in width. There are very few places where the river 
is narrower than 100 meters* Consequently, when the flow of the Sungari 
is great, there are almost 200 days which are suitable for navigation. 
In a year when the flow is small, boats with a draught of 4 to 5 feet 
can have safe sailing for 150 days. When the flow of the Sungari is ex-
tremely small, there are about 50 days suitable for sailing of boats with 
a draught of 3 feet or less. However, those boats of a draught above 2.5 
feet,07 have to suspend operations for a short time. In the whole 
course there are buoys marking the depth of the river. With the excep-
tion of the shoal located at San-hsing or I-lan, where sailing should be 
conducted with care, there are 20 hours or more per day for navigation. 
In summary, navigation along the lower parts of the Sungari offers great 
prospects for future development. 
2. There are several kinds of boats operating on the Sungari: 
a. Steamboats 
14, Passenger - freight boats. The chief purpose of 
the boat is to transport passengers. The decks are used for passengers; 
below the decks is cargo space. A smaller steamer can carry 200 tons 
While a large one can carry 1,800 tons of goods. The bottom of the ship 
is flat. It is operated by one or two paddle-wheels. 
2. Tugboats. The tugboat is a power boat used for 
pulling freight boats and barges. 
3. Barges. Most of the barges are made of iron. Few 
are made of wood. They have no propellers and must be pulled by tug-
boats. The capacity of a barge ranges from 400 to 1,000 tons. 
b. Sailboats 
1. Wind Boat. When the wind is blowing in the direction 
of travel, canvas is used. Oars are used when sailing against the wind. 
Large boats are capable of carrying 70 tons. Both the stern andthe bow

of the boat are square in form. There are two masts. However, the mind 
boats sailing between Kirin and Harbin are one-mast boats. The storage 
room is built near the centerof the boat. On the two sides and at the 
rear of the -boat there are planks for protection against water, but not 
for the accommodation of goods* 
2. Freight Boat. It is similar to the wind boat in 
structure, but it is larger and has a very flat bottom. It sails mostly 
on the upper parts of the Sungari near Harbin. 
3. Paired. Boats. They are also called the pulling 
boats. Two small boats are tied to each other* At the center there is 
one mast without decks or planks. Their draught is very shallow and 
thus they can sail in shallow waters. However, they are not safe. They 
are good for the transportation of goods over short distances, but un-
suitable for long-distance transportation. 
In summary, the structure of the vessels sailing along 
the Sungari River must meet the following requirements because the? flow 
and the river bed of the Sungari are peculiar. 
1. The bottoms of the vessels must be flat* 
2. The draught must be shallow even when loaded 
with a large amount of goods. Thus, the body of the vessel should be 
wide and spacious. 
3. A vessel must be airtight and waterproof. 
If a boat meets these requirements, there will be 
no danger in its sailing along the Sungarij and it will eliminate the 
,difficulty in the operation of boats, and the unnecessary slowing down 
of speed. 
'0* Data on. Navigation Along the Sungari 
It has been mentioned above that the Sungari has played a 
decisive role in the development of Manchuria. This can be further 
illustrated by its passenger and freight services in the past* 
1* Passenger Transportation 
More and more people moved northward each year. This 
elms that the once desolated northern part of Manchuria has been ex-
ploited at a super speed.

2? Freight Tranaportation 
The total volume of goods transported over rivers and 
streame in North Manchuria was roughly 800,000 metric tons in 1933. A 
breakdown of this figure by rivers is given below: 
Main course of theSungari River 740,000 metric tons 
Upper parts of the Sungari 30,000 metric tone 
Amur River 23,000 metric tons 
Ussuri River 7,000 metric tons 
Total 800,000 metric tons 
We may also have this figure broken down into types of 
goods (in metric tons). 
Agricultural products 400,000 
Coal and mineral products 240,000 
Lumber 70,000 
Miscellaneous 90,000 
Total 800,000 
Most of the agricultural products were transported upstream to 
Harbin. A small part of these products was consumed in the Municipality 
of Harbin, while a large part of than was shipped from there to the 
south by. railroad. Coal, minerals and timber were mostly consumed in 
Harbin (a very limited amount of timber was shipped to the south). The. 
reverse is true of miscellaneous goods. They were shipped downstream 
from Harbin to the valleys of Amur and Ussuri? It is obvious that 80 
percent of the goods (except miscellaneous) transported by waterways 
W8 concentrated at Harbin both from the lower and the upper parts of 
the Sungari. 
The total volume of freight transported by waterways with
Harbin as a center was 610,000 metric tons in the navigable period of 
the Sungari (from April to November) in 1933, vhile the freight tonnage 
handled by railroads in muth, north, and lest Manchuria was 2,53.0,000 
metric tons during the 12-month period (October 1932 to September 1933). 
In other words, ofthe combined volume of freight traffic, or 3,120,000 
metric tons, 20 percent was handled by waterways while 80 percent was 
handled by raLlroads. 
The volume of freight traffic along the Sungari, the Amur, and 
the Ussuri rivers between 1928 and 1935 is as follows:

D. Navigation of the Nonni River 
The Nonni River originates in the southern part of the 
I-la-hu-li Mountains. When it passes the Kan Ho, it turns in a southwest, 
direction toward Chli-chli-ha-erh. From there it turns in a southeast 
direction and meets the main course of the Sungari. The length of the . 
river is 1,170 kilometers. 
From the source of the Nonni to Nen-chteng the current is rapid, 
and the river bed is full of rocks. This makes navigation very difficult. 
This section of the river is used only for floating timber. On the 
middle section from Nen-chieng to Chli-chii-ha-erh there are a number of 
sailboats. River traffic is heavy on the lower parts between Chli-ch'i-
ha-erh and the confluence with the Sungari River because the volume of 
the river in this section is very favorable for navigation. 
Chiang-chliao, Fu-la-erh-chi and La-ha along the Nonni are. 
connected to the Ssu-pling-Chti-chli-ha-erh, the Northern Manchurian, and 
the Chli-chti-ha-erh-Pei-an lines. Thus the Nonni River supplements the 
function of the railroads. For instance, in 1933 when there WAS a record 
'breaking flood in Manchuria, the railroad lines between La-ha and Harbin, 
between Chlang-chlun and Harbin and between Ssu-pling and Chli-ch,i-ha-erh 
were interrupted suddenly. Accordingly? the Nonni River with Chiang-chliao 
as its shipping center was utilized for the transportation of relief goods 
to Harbin. In 1934, a group of vessels carried soybeans from the lower 
part of the Sungari to Chiang-chi:Lao on its upper part. On their return 
trip they were loaded with construction materials for the Harbin-Pei-an 
Railway and miscellaneous goods. The volume of freight transported both 
upstream and downstream was about 70,000 metric tons. 
E. Amur Navigation 
The section of the Amur River from the mouth of the Argun River 
to the mouth of the Ussuri is 1,865 kilometers. This is a aectianwhere

Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
navigation is possible. The shallowest place is above 3 feet, while 
the deepest place is as much as several tens of feet. The width is 
usually mare than 250 meters. The widest place is almost two kilo-
meters. River freezing usually takes place in the last ten days of 
October or in the first ten days of November. The melting is usually 
in progress in the middle of April or in the last ten days of the same 
month. There are five months in a year in which navigation is possible. 
The Amur River is connected with the railway at Ai-hun. Thus 
it supplements the railroads in Manchuria. Its outstanding services to 
Manchuria is timber floating. Boats whose draught is 2 or 3 feet can 
sail from the mouth of the Argun Rivet to a place ,located 860 kilometers 
up river. 
F. ,Ussuri Navigation 
The Ussuri is 900 kilometers long. Its. volume is very great 
and the current is rather slow. It has many tributaries. The width of 
the river in the upper part is from 100 to 200 meters, while it is 
greater in the lower part. It is suitable for navigation. The main 
navigable section is from the mouth of the Ussurito Hu-lin, the length 
of which is 600 kilometers. In addition, the Ussuri is connected with 
the railroad line between Hu-lin and Lin-k'ou.

Section 4. Trans ortation on the Yalu River 
A. The Characteristics of Ya-lu Navigation: 
The Ya-lu Ho eriginates in the ?Wang-psi Shan, and forms the 
boundary between China and Korea. After meeting its tributary, the Hun 
Chiang, it flows past An-tung and Sinuiju, and into the Yellow Sea. The 
length of the river is olo kilometers. Its navigable section is from 
its mouth to a place called Erh-shih-ssu-tao-kou. River traffic ia heavy 
from the mouth of the Hun Chiang to An-tung, 200 kilometers in distance* 
Soils are fertile in the neighborhood of the Hun Chiang. The navigation 
is more thriving in this part than in the main course of the Ya-lu. Ho. 
From the mouth of the Ya-lu Ho to Pa-tao-kou there are some sailing 
vessels. 
The harbor at the mouth of the river is the gate to An.etung. It 
is there that navigation thrives. However, upstream sailing frcm there is 
very difficult. Large steamers cannot sail upstream. Vessels of 2,000 
tons to 2,500 tons can sail upstream to San-tao-lang-tiou. 1,000-ton 
vessels can sail upstream to An-tung Railroad Bridge. 
The Shui-feng Dam WAS built in 1941. This has changed the 
prospects of navigation on the Ya-lu Ho. The increase in thedepth of 
water is very favorable for navigation. Meanwhile, the volume of the 
Ya-lu Ho in its lower parts is also under control. There is a part of 
the river which is not frozen in bitterly cold winter. However, the water . 
level is low in the lower parts of the river and navigation there is 
difficult. Therefore, the building of the Ta-tung harbor is necessary. 
Some special features of the Ya-1u navigation are as follows: 
1. The navigation of the Ya-lu River occupies an extremely 
important position in politics, industry, and economics* It is also 
-known as an international river. 
2. The current in the upper parts of the river is rapid because 
it flows along mountain and valleys and because there are a great number 
of hidden rooks. Time navigation in the upper parts is difficult. 
Accordingly, traffic an the Ya-lu Ho is usually concentrated between the 
mouth of the Hun Chiang and An-tung. The lower parts of the river below 
An-tong are valuable for international traffic, 
3. The Shui-feng dam has made great contributions to the develop-
ment of hydroelectric power. Transportation on both the upper and lower 
courses is greatly benefited by the dam. 
40 In the upper parts of the Ya-lu Ho there are rich forest 
resources. In the middle parts there are the tributaries, the Hun 
Chiang, the Chlang-tien Chiang and the Ai Ho. Since the nineteenth 
century, flocks of immigrants have come to this part from Shantung 
Province and developed a prosperous agricultural economy. This created 
a demand for transportation services and in turn enabled the An-tung 
.Fort to become a prosperous harbor. 
B. Ya-lu Ho Navigation and the Types of Vessels in Use 
A rough picture of the navigation along the Ya-lu Ho may be 
? found in the map attached at the end of this chapter* Vessels sailing on 
the Ya-la Ho are as follows:

1. Dugout Boats. They are good for short distance 
transportation only. They are found mostly on the Korean Bank. 
2. Sailboats. Their draught is very shallow. The body 
of the boat is bulky and heavy but is strongly built. The boats are. 
propelled by wind. Before the introduction of the flat-bottom boats,: 
they were the only vessels used for freight transportation. The weak-
ness of these boats is that they are unfit for upstream sailing. Con:-
sequently, they are rapidly diminishing in number* According to a rigid 
classification, sailboats include large sailboats, small sailboats, 
Ta-chien, Hsiao-chien, Tui-wei, Hsiao-p/o, allsecs, K'o-chien, and 
sampan. 
3. Flat-bottom Boats. They are so named because they have 
flat bottoms. Their draught is not very deep. Their bodies are light 
and good for upstream sailing. They were first used in Korea in 1905. 
Since then the number has increased yearly. 
4. Motor Boats. Their draught is very shallow., and they 
are best for sailing in shallow waters. They are used for transporting 
passengers and mail between An -tung and Chin -hua-chen. The boats are 
made of wood and weigh about 10.46 metric tons. They are driven by 
internal combustion engines. Their speed is 16.36 knots. Their 
passenger capacity is 32 persons. The draught of an empty boat is 10 
centimeters forward and 30 centimeters aft. The length of the boat is 
18.2 meters and its width is 2.11 meters, 
C. Goods Transported on the Ya-lu Ho 
In the past goods transported on the Ya-lu varied with the 
direction of movement. Goods transported upstream were miscellaneous, 
salt, flour, fuel, and other daily necessities. Commodities transported 
downstream w ere mainly soybeans, cereals, and soybean cakes. All of 
them were transported from the districts of Lin -chiang, Chi-an, T'ung -hue, 
Huan -Jen, and Muan-tien. The volume of these goods is listed as follows:

Lumber produced on the upper Ya-lu was floated to the lower 
parts from Erh-shih-ssu-tao-kou. The shapes of the rafts varied. Rafts 
arranged by the Japanese method traveled at a faster speed than that 
arranged according to the Chinese method. To float the raft arranged 
according to the Japanese method takes 15 to 20 days from Chlang-pai or 
Hui-shan Chen to An-tung, while it takes 60 to 80 days by the Chinese 
method. The number of rafts floated at one time varies with the locality.

Five or six rafts are floated from Erh-shih-ssu-tao-kou, ten rafts from 
Shih-san-tao-kou, 20 to 25 fram Lin-chiang, and 30 to 35 from Chi-an and 
?Kao-shan-chen. Rafts are then moved by tugboats when they reach Antung. 
Part of the lumber is transferred to boats after it reaches San-tao-lang,.

III. SEA TRANSPORTATION 
asSiTill_atuaLLAELKEattatit 
The coast line of Manchuria is extremely short. There are the 
commercial ports of Dairen, An-tung, Ying-klou, and Hu-lu-tao, and 
several fishing ports. These ports, although limited in number, have 
played an important role in the economic development of Manchuria. 
The oldest harbor in Maachuria is Chiu-wan located below Lao-tlish 
Shan at Port Arthur. Archaeological research shows that Chiu-wan Was a 
commercial port in the Han Dynasty. It shows also that Port Arthur, 
Dairen, and Ta-,tun&-kou had communication with Shantung Province during 
the Han Dynasty. Kai-pling, Hsi-hai-klou (Chin-chou), and Niu-chuang 
had uninterrupted navigation with Shantung and Hopei provinces in the 
Sung Dynasty. In the Ming and ?tiling Dynasties, Tiao-,yu-tiai (Hsing-
?Wong), Chlang-tzu-klou (Sul-chung), Niang-gaiang-kung, Chin-chow, 
Pi-tzu-wo, Pu-lan-tien, Chuang-hos and Ta-kn-shan were valuable 
commercial ports. The migration of the Chinese people to the north was 
the Major factor for the growth of these ports. 
.The Port of Ying-klou has long been an international port. Since 
its opening as a port its history is divided into two periods. In the 
first period it was under the domination of Britain, while in the other 
period it was under Japanese control. 
The port of Ting-100u was below sea level in the seventeenth 
century. Due to the continued formation of bars at the mouth of the 
Liao Ho, Ying-k1ou gradually rose to sea level. Since 1830 the 
commercial activities in Niu-chuang and Tien-chuang-tai have shifted 
gradually to Ying-klou. In 1858, according to the Tientsin Treaty, 
Ying-klou was opened as an international port. At first the Tientsin 
Treaty stipulated Niu-chuang as an international port. But the 
British Consul at Niu-chuang considered the potentiality of Ying-klon 
to be much greater than that of Niu-chuang. Accordingly, Ying-klou 
was chosen as a commercial port and was opened for trade. 
Since its opening as a port in 1872, Ying-k,ou has developed a 
prosperous daipping industry, When Dairen was opened as a port, and 
, when the Ssu-pling Railway wasopened to traffic, Ying-klou suffered 
a setback. Despite this, it is still a port of great importance. The 
volume of its annual imports and exports amounted to 100,000,000 custom 
taels of silver. 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Dairen was nothing but 
a small village located on the Gulf of Chihli. In 1898 Czarist Russia 
began to build a commercial port there. Before construction was 
completed, war broke out between Russia and Japan. Since Japan won the 
war, it inherited the Russian rights and continued the harbor construc-
tion. Atter years of unceasing efforts under the administration of the

? South Manchuria Railway Company, Dairen has become a world famous harbor 
and played an important role in economics, communications, and national 
defense. After the conclusion of World war II it was occupied by the 
USSR. We have not yet taken it over. 
Let us now discuss the Harbor of An-tung. An-tung was opened as a 
port in March 1907, Before its opening to international trade it had 
only a small scale trade with ports an the upper Ya-lu Ho and on the coast 
of South China. An-tong has been considered a domestic port. 
In addition to the three ports already listed above, there are tome 
small porta including Hai-hai-k"dul Sun-chia-wan (Chin-hsien), 
Sha-hou-so-nan-t'an, Niang-niang-kung (Hsing-chieng), Fd-chou, 
Sungtpentao, P'an-shan, Ta-rtung-k'ou, Pei-ching-tzu, Huang-t'u-klan 
(Feng-chleng-thsien), Ta-ku-shan, Ching-tui-tzu, Chuang-hos etc. They 
are scattered here and there along the Gulf of Chihli and the Yellow Sea. 
Besides these there are some ports worthy of our attention. They are 
Vladivostok in the USSR and the three ports of North Korea. 
The port of Vladivostok has become prosperous since the construction 
of the Ussuri Railway. In fact, after Russia lost Dairen to Japan in the 
Russo-Japanese War, it tried hard to build Vladivostok into a center of 
trade with Manchuria. At that time, almost all goods exported to the 
north were transferred there. Due to the revolution in Russia 
Vladivostok was in turmoil. Consequently, all goods produced in North 
Manchuria were sent southward and exported through Dairen. Business in 
Vladivostok was on the decline. It was not until the Chinese Eastern 
Railway reiterated its policy in support of Vladivostok as a commercial 
port that Vladivostok became prosperous again* 
The port of Vladivostok is located 245 kilometers from the Chinese-
Soviet Bordei. The distance between Vladivostok and Harbin, center of the 
North Manchurian economy, is 794 kilometers. In comparison with the 
distance between Harbin and Dairen, which is 942 kilometers, the distance 
between Harbin and Vladivostok is much shorter. The following is a list 
of the distance between world famous ports and Vladivostok and Dairen.

coast of the Japanese Sea, and they were ports of local importance. 
They had trade mainly with the Yen-chi region. In view of transporta-
tion, the network including the La-ha to Harbin Railway Line, the 
Kirin'to Hui-ning Eine, and the Eastern Lines in North Korea, the Tum. 
MOD to Chia-mu-esu Line, which were completed after the Mukden Incident 
and in view of the plan for building Najin into a modern harbor, the 
three ports listed above will have a closer tie with the commerce of 
Manchuria. 
Section 2. Ying-Mou Harbor  
a. A Brief. Review of the Commercial Activities in Ting-ktou 
is Iodated 13 miles from the mouth of the. Liao River. Its principal 
piers arelocated on the south bank of the Liao River. All of the piers 
are owned by the South Manchuria Railway Company, the Manchukuo Customs 
Office, or private corporations. There are also two or three piers on 
the north bank of the Liao which are connected with the railway stations 
of the Peking to MUkden Railway Line. 
Although the water level is high and the river is wide, the 
depth of the Liao River at its mouth is only 7 to 8 feet because of the 
existence of bars there; Thus the largest ship that can enter the 
harbor is of 7,000 tone. Most Of the vessels entering the harbor.are 
,.Of 2,000 to 3,000 tons. The week point of this harbor is that it is 
frozen in the winter.: Harbor traffic stops from the last ten days of 
November of mid-December to the last ten days of March the next year. 
b. The growth of Ying-eou is a tort . 
Readers may get a general picture of the ocean transportation 
in Manchuria if they take notice of the speed of economic deyelopment 
Lu Manchuria and of the historical development of international trade 
.in that area. Ting-klou was opened as a port in 1858. In the first 
thirty years it was not discovered that Ying-k'ou was valuable as a 
port for international trade. Although there were foreign ships calling 
on this port, trade was conducted on a small scale. Goods were conveyed 
:mostly by small vessels. . This is a latent period. 
When the two powers., Britain and Russia, competed with each 
other in building railroads in Manchuria Ying-k'ou became prosperous 
rapidly. Thus, the years between 1892 and 1901 marked Ying-ksoula 
most rapid growth. Imports and exports transferred at Ying-k'ou at the 
end of the. nineteenth century are given in Table 27 (unit: 10,000 
customs taelis). 
Chief imports were the sundries from Japan, cotton and silk 
articles produced in India or Japan, metals, hemp bags, coal, American 
flour, matches made in Japan and Europe, sugar, tobacco, and a large 
quantity of railway construction material from the US. 
Regarding the goods directly exported, i.e., the native products 
in Manchuria, the volume of export increased yearly following the 
Chinese-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Ninety percent of the 
exports were to Japan. Ninety percent of the exports to Japan consisted 
of soybeans and soybean products. Other exports included castor oil, 
sesame oil, tussah silk, etc.

Trade between China Proper and Manchuria had been in progress 
betore the opening of Ying-k'ou as a port, at Niu-chuang and Tien-
chuang-t'ai. After Manchuria's economy was developed, trade became 
improved. When soybean trade was firmly established between Japan and 
Manchuria, Manchuria's trade with China Proper was somewhat depressed. 
However, Manchuria's trade with China Proper was still equally large 
as its foreign trade in volume or in value. Thus Ting-klou played a , 
decisive role in domestic trade. Since Dairen had been opened as a 
free port and since the Southern Manchurian Railway Corporation pre-
ferred Dairen as a transport center, Ying-leou shifted from a foreign 
trade center to a port of domestic trade.

section 3. Port Authur and Dairen Harbors 
a. A General Description of Dairen and Port Arthur. 
Originallythe Port of Dairen was a small village located near 
the coapt of the Gulf of Chihli. In 1898, an engineer, named Ko-eth-
pei-chi, with the Tung Ch'ing Railway (the Chinese Eastern Railway) 
made a proposal that the port of Dairen should be so built that it might 
accommodate 100 ships of 1,000 tons each He estimated that the Dairen 
harbor -could handle 5,0001000 tons of freight annually. His Proposal 
' was finally accepted by the authorities of the Tung Ch'ing Railway, Ip 
? 1899, 1,000,000 rubles were.appropriated for the first construction 
period. In 1904, when the second period was to start, the Busse-Japanese 
War broke out. Since Czarist Russia was defeated by the Japanese, it 
gave Dairen to Japan as stipulated in the Portsmouth Treaty. Sub-
sequently, the Southern Manchurian Railway Corporation made more com-
prehensive plans for the reconstruction Of the port. '.The Corporation:: 
Was very active in the building And management Of the port.- It has in-
vested more than 100,000,000 yen in harbor development, . 
The port of Dairen is capable of handling 14200,000 tons of 
freight yearly. It is considered one Of eaatern Asia's best ports.. 
It is also the only port in Manchuria which is not frozen in winter. 
East, west, apd north of the port there is a sea wall 3,980 meters 
long. Inside the harbor there is an embankment 5,126 meters long. 
Forty-three steamers of 4,000 tons each can anchor there. The bridges 
in the harbor sea total 1,823 meters. Freight loading and unloading 
platforms. are 3,588 meters long. The Japanese completed the reclamation 
of an area of 3,640,000 square meters for the harbor. The harbor bas 
125,930 meters of roads and 232,172 meters of railroads. It also has 
72 warehouses and 133 open-air storage places capable of accommodating 
1.0250,000 tons of freight. 
In view of the shortage of piers caused by the heavy ocean 
traffic, the South Manchurian Railway Company planned to build its first 
pier at Kan-ching-tzu across the river from Dairen, the purpose of which 
is purely for loading and unloading coal. The project was started in 
September 1926 and completed in October 1930. It was a suspension 
130ridge of the caisson type. Four large boats varying from 7,000-10,000 
tons can be anchored there. On the bridge there are three lanes for 
putomobiles. The Manchukuo Chemical and Industrial Corporation also 
built a bridge at Kan-ching-tzu 125 meters long and 12 meters side for 
transporting 120,000 toms of minerals and 180,000 tons of ammonia sul-
fate annually. The bridge which was completed in September 1934 is also 
known as the Second Pier of Kan-ching-tzu or Manchukuo Chemical Corpor-
etion Bridge. 
The South Manchuria Railway Company built three cement buoys 
on the breakwater near Kan-ching-tzu for the purpose of facilitating the 
transportation of the petroleum of the ManchUkuo Petroleum Corporation. 
Ome 6-inch and one I2-inch pipe were also installed on the breakwater for 
the transportation of petroleum. 
From the standpoint of harbor facilities, Port Arthur is generally 
aoneidered as a supplementary port to Dairen. It was used since August 
1923 by the South Manchuria Railway Company for the transportation of 
f:::;. Its chief exports were coal and salt. Inside the port there are 
ards.

b. Dairen as a Free Port 
When Czarist Russia got the right of leasing the Gulf of 
Dairen, Dairen was opened to all traders as a free port.: Even after 
the Japanese took it over, Dairen remained a free port. As a natter 
of fast, in April 1906 the Japanese Government notified the world that 
effective 1 September 1906 Dairen would be opened as a free port. From 
that time on, both imports and exports. have been exempt, from tax. 
The control of Dairen was Japan's arab step toward the in-
vasion of Manchuria. Before the MUkden Incident, the Japanese used 
Dairen as a center for the exploitation of Manchuria and for the develop-
ment of a transportation system, mainly the Southern Manchurian' Railway. 
Japan's ultimate objective was the complete conquest of Manchuria. Soon 
after Manchukuo came to power, NeJin, amodern port in North Korea, was 
built, World War II broke out, and the ocean routes passed through:awe 
great changes. Consequently, the policy of using Dairen as.a traffic 
center administered by the South Manchuria Railway Company became 
obsolete. 
Section 4. Hulas* Harbor  
In view of the handicap of having only one port, Dairen, 
through which to transport Manchuria's farm products, Eau Shih-chang, 
the governor general of China's Three Eastern Provinces, in 1908: 
invited, a British engineer to conduct a survey of Lien-sham Wan for 
'the building of a modern port at Hu-lu-tao. When the plan was approved, 
civil war broke out in the different parts in China. Capital was lack-
ing. A; 4 result the plan was never executed. In 1929, a technical 
advisor of. the Nationalist Government, Man-ti-erh, reiterated the 
necessity of building a port at Lien-sham Wan. In the meantime, the 
Peking-Mukden Railway Administration also voiced the same opinion. sub-
sequently, the Nationalist Government determined in 1930 to go Ahead 
with the proposal of building HU-lu-tao as a port. The construction 
part of, the project was executed by the Peking-Mad= Railway Admin-
istration and the Holland Harbdr Construction Corporation. The appro-
priation'fOr the project was 6,400,000 us dollars. Construction was 
slated to be completed not later than October. 1935. 
The Port of EU-lu-tao is located on Lienshan, Wan north of the 
Gulf of Chihi. The distance between the port and Lienshan Railway 
Station is 12 kilometers. Eu-lu-tao is considered as the best port 
on Lien-sham Wan because it, is not frozen in winter. However, in the 
coldest season there are floating masses of ice outside the harbor. 
Now we may take a look at the size of the harbor according to 
the approved plan. It has concrete wharves 3,700 feet in length. It 
also has 5,700 feet of breakwater built of concrete and another 7,900 
,feet built of stone. The dredging of the port is 700 square feet in 
area gig. When the port is completed, it will be able to handle 
5,000 metric toms of freight. 
When the project was not yet completed, Manchuria fell into 
the hands of the Japanese. All the existing wharves were built-by the 
South Manchuria Railway Company under the Manchukuo regime. up to the 
time of the MMkden Incident, this is the progress made by the Peking 
HVikden Railway Administration with regard to engineering work:

1. The embankments had not been started; 
2. 600 feet of the 700-foot long and 75-foot wide break-
water were completed; 
3. 600 feet of the 900-foot suspension bridge (75 feet 
wide) were completed; 
4. The excavation plan was one third completed. The rocks 
excavated from Pan-las Han were used for the building of the suspension 
bridge and the filling of the Pei Hai. 
Section 5. Accomplishments  of Harbor Transportation  
Since Manchuria has a highly developed transportation system and 
is rich in resources, a great many Chinese immigrate to that area yearly. 
Trade is brisk. A great portion of the goods is handled through ports 
there. This was particularly true before the operation of railways in 
Manchuria. . 
Around 1931 the Chinese entering or leaving Manchuria were estimated 
at 1,500,000. Freight moving in or out of Manchuria amounted to 10,000,000 
metric tons. Ninety percent of the freight traffic and 65 sereent of the 
passengers used harbor facilities. Other freight and passenger traffic 
utilized railways along Shan-hai-kuan and An-twig. 
Harbor traffic consists of freight and passengers: 
Passenger traffic by sea 
' Before the introduction of railways moat of the Chinese 
people cane to Manchuria by sea from Shantung and Hopeh Provinces. They 
landed on the Liao-tung Peninsula or in the Gulf of Chihli. Then they 
sailed along the Liao River to the hinterland of Manchuria. After the 
railways were put into full operation, some of the passengers entered 
Manchuria from Shan-hai-kuan by the Peking-Maden Line.. Other passengers. 
used the sea route and entered Manchuria via Dairen, Yin-k.ou and An-tung. 
Regarding the number of immigrants, those who landed at Dairen accounted 
for the greatest part of the immigrants through the sea routes. The 
next greatest was those who had landed at Ying-k'ou and Mi-twig. Mare 
immigrantscame to Manchuria by railroad than by the sea routes. Besides) 
there were more than 100,000 people moving in and out the frontiers 
near Yeh-chi, most of whom were Koreans. Few People entered Manchuria 
from Vladivostok or from Lupin because of the immigration red tape in-
volved. 
There has never been an accurate figure of the population 
in Manchuria. Before the introduction of railroads into Manchuria, it 
was estimated that the population of Manchuria was between 11,000l000 
and 12,000)000. However, from 1895 to 1944, or in half a century, the 
population has grown to 47,000,000 due to the natural growth and the 
immtgration from China Proper. Chinese immigrants came mostly by sea. 
Not many of them cane by railroad. Most of them stayed in Manchuria. 
This is considered a contributing factor in the development of Manchuria.

Before the MUkden Incident, the total volume of trade was 
coniposed 80 percent of exports and 20 percent of imports. In terms of 
monetary value, it was composed 6o percent of exports and 4o percent of . 
imports. This shays that Manchuria is a large exporter of ray materials.

The relations between ports and the hinterland may be described 
as follows: 
1. Dairen 
With the exception of western Jehol Province, the valley' 
of the 7a-lu,Ro, Chien...tao, and the border zones between China and the 
USSR in North Manchuria, all the localities are considered the hinter-
land of Dairen. 
2. ling-k'ou 
In some respects Ying-k'ou is similar to Dairen but it is 
. less attractive than Dairen as a seaport. 
3. An-tung Port 
With the valley of the Ya-lu HO as its hinterland. 
4. Ports located in Ebrth Korea. 
With Yen-chi and its neighborhood as their hinterland. 
Vladivostok 
Northern Manchuria as its hinterland. 
6. Ching-huang-tao and Tientsin 
With western Liaoning Province and a part of Jehol 
Province as their hinterland. 
From the above description it can be seen that both Dairen and 
Ting-k'ou have the same hinterland. Before the establishment of rail-
roads and before the completion of Dairen as a port trade in Manchuria 
was mostly carried on in Ying-k'ou. After the South Manchuria Railway 
Company opened Dairen as a.free port in 1909, the center of freight 
traffic shifted there with freight rates for the two ports standardized. 
In 1911 when the An-tung harbor construction project was completed, a 
standard freight rate was also applied there. From then on, goods trans-
ported to Fan-chih-t'un and further north were charged a uniform rate 
regardless of whether they were from Ying-Mou, Dairen, or An-tung. This 
made Dairen very srosperous. TO stimulate business in Ying-Mou, the 
South Manchuzia Railway Company lowered the freight rate there in 
November 1919. Despite this, the volume of trade handled at Ying-k'ou 
could hardly match that at Dairen. 
In freight transportation Ying-k'ou is inferior to Dairen for 
the following reasons: 
1. The freight rate and other expenses are higher; 
2. Shipping insurance is higher. In addition, shippers are 
required to buy fire insurance when the goods arrive on land; 
3. Ying-k'ou is frozen in the winter time during which 
vessels cannot enter;

4. Vessels above 2,000 tons cannot enter Ying-Mou; 
5. Vessels making transit stops there are subject to 
customs inspection; 
6. The price of silver is subject to great fluctuation. 
This has been a handicap to trade. 
Among all the ports in Manchuria (including Vladivostok), 
Dairen is leading in the volume of exports. Next to Dairen are Vladi-
vostok, Ying-ksou and An-tung. Dairen also takes the lead in sharing 
the volume of imports. Next to it are Ying-leoul Vladivostok, and An-
tung. Trade volume handled at other ports lerinsignificant. 
? 3. Freight Traffic by Sea 
The destinations of freight traffic at the ports in 
Manchuria are listed as follows: 
1. Trade originated from Dairen is spread over the 
world with South China, Japan and Europe as its main destinations. 
2. Trade from Ying-k'ou goes mainly to China Proper. 
3. The main trade area for An-tung is Japan. 
4. The main trade area for North Korean ports is Japan. 
5. Vladivostok is a trading port with Japan and 
Europe. The volume of trade with Japan is greater than that with 
Europe. 
Imports and exports from and?to the above-mentioned ' 
ports are given in the following tables.

BOOK III. ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN MANCHURIA  
TRANSPORTATION POLICY OF MANCHUKUO 
Section 1. Brief History of the Ministry of Communication of Manchukuo  
After the Mukden Incident, with the exception of the South 
Manchuria Railway and its affiliated railways which were still in 
operation, other railway lines like the Mukden-Hai-lung, the Kirin. 
Hai-lung, the Chlang-ch'un-Kirin, the Kirin-Tung-hua, the Hu-lun-
Hai-lung, the Chli-chli-ha-erh-Klo-shan, the Tao-nan-Ang-ang-chli, 
the Tlao-nan-So-lun and the Ssu-pling-Tlao-nan were almost forced to 
suspend their operations. In October 1931 the chief executives of 
the lines just mentioned held a conference in Mukden in which it was 
decided that a Temporary Oommunications Committee be established so 
that the functions of railway administrations could be restored. In 
March 1932 Manchukuo was founded. It proclaimed the organic laws of 
the Manchukuo Government and of the State Council under Government 
Orders 1 and 6. Communications Temporary Committee was then dissolved. 
Its function was taken over by the Ministry of Communication. 
The Ministry of Communications was authorized to be in charge 
of the operations of railways, highways, waterways, harbors and ports, 
navigation, aviation postal administration, telephone and telegraphs. 
The chief of the Ministry of Communication was called the Director 
General, On 1 March 1934 the government system was changed to a 
monarchy and the directors general were called Ministers. 
Section 2. Organization of the Manchukuo Ministry of Communications  
A. Organization of the Ministry 
Under the Ministry there were four divisions: the Division 
of General Affairs, the Division of Railways, the Division of Water-
ways and the Division of the Post Office. In 1933, the four divisions 
were reorganized into three divisions: the Division of General Affairs, 
the Division of Roads and. the Division of the Post Office. In subse-
quent years, the administrative structure of the ministry was changed 
many times corresponding to changes in communication policies. In 
1937 the Bureau Of Civil Engineering formerly under the Ministry of, 
Interior was incorporated into the Ministry of Communications. At 
that time the Ministry of Communications comprised the Office of the 
Minister, the Division of Railways, the Division of Waterways and the 
Division of Highways with the General Office of Postal Administration 
being an independent agency directly under the control of the Minister. 
In 1939, the system of one Minister s office, five divisions and one 
independent bureau was adopted. he new system consisted of the 
office of the Minister, the Division of Railways the Division of 
Highways and Roads, the Division of Waterways, die Division of Aviation, 
the Division of City Planning and the General Office of the Postal 
Administration as an independent bureau directly under the Minister. 
Besides, the Central Observatory was also put under the control of 
the Ministry of Communications. In 1943, the Division of Highways as 
Well as the Division of City Planning were abolished and a new division 
named the Divition of Reconstruction was set up.

B. The Ministry of Communications had a number of agencies in 
charge of administration of communications at local level. 
In 1933 navigation was established at Ying-kleu,- An-tung, 
Harbin. These bureaus had branch offices at Hei-ho, Chia-mu-ssu, 
Hu-lu-tao, Kirin and Other localities. 
In 1937 civil engineering offices were established at Tu-meni 
Mu-tan-chiang, Tung-an, Hal-ho, Hailer, Ying-kou, Chin-hsien to be 
in charge of the construction projects of the Ministry. In addition, 
there Was the office of River Conservation and Survey at Ch'ang-chlun, 
and the River Conservation Project Engineering offices established 
at Chang-wu, Ying-leou, and Chin-hsien. 
In 1939 the Bureau of Reconstruction of Ta-tung Port was es-
tablished at An-tung for the construction of the new port. 
Aviation agencies were established at Chlang-ch'un, Hukden, 
Ch'i-chli-ha-erh, Ch'eng-te, Harbin Mu-tan-chiang. In addition to the 
Central Observatory, there were some local observatories. All of 
them were under the control of the Ministry of Communications, and 
were in charge of aviation meteorology and weather forecasting. 
The bureaus, agencies, offices and organizations were all 
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications. At the 
provincial government level, there were the commissions of communi-
cations and the divisions of highways. In the municipalities, there 
were the offices of Communications or the divisions of Communications. 
In the hsien government of ch'i governments, there were the offices 
of civil engineering or the offices of Communications. All these 
agencies at various levels of the government constituted the adminis-
tration of communications. 
Agencies whose function corresponded to those in the Ministry 
of Communications included the subordinate agencies of the South 
Manchuria Railway Company like the bureaus of railways and the 
bureaus of Inland river navigation. All of them were scattered at 
various places. All in all, the organization structure of the 
communication system in Manchuria was highly developed. 
Section 3. A Review of Manchukuo's Trauportation Bala 
A. An Outline of Manchukuo's Transportation Policy 
On 1 March 1933, the Manchukuo regime issued the General Policy 
for Economic Reconstruction. The fourth section of the directive 
dealt with transportation policy which may be summarized as follows: 
1. Railways: 
The chief objective to be attained in the reconstruction of 
railways was the development of the rich resources in Manchuria, the 
strengthening of national defense, and the maintenance of peace and 
order. It was planned that a total mileage of 25,000 kilometers of

Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
railways in Manchuria will be built in the future. In the first ten-
year period, 4,000 kilometers of railway will be built. At the end 
of the first ten-years, the total railway mileage will be 10,000 
kilometers. The major railway lines will be under the control of the 
Manchukuo regime. 
2. Ports and Harbors: 
The administration of ports and harbors is vital to the de-
velopment of natural resources. In addition to the utilization of 
the ports and harbors already built up in Manchuria, the Manchukuo 
Government attempted to use the facilities in the ports and harbors 
of its neighboring counties. l'he first step taken by the government 
was the rebuilding of the two ports Ying-klou and An-tung. When 
there is a need in the future, efforts will be made to rebuild Hu-lu-
tao. lath regard to ocean transportation, initial efforts would be 
made to develop coastal shipping. Transocean navigation will be 
developed by gradual steps. 
3. Inland Rivers: 
Because of the importance of inland river navigation, the 
greatest efforts would be made in the development of inland river 
navigation along the Amur, Sungari, Ya-lu-Ho and Liao Ho-. 
4, Highways: 
It was planned that within ten years 60,000 kilometers of 
highways would be either newly built or repaired, so that automobile 
transportation would be brought to its full development. This 
would not only shorten the distance between cities, but Also bring 
closer cities and villages and thereby facilitate the maintenance of 
social peace and order. 
5. Telecommunications: 
? The government planned to install telecommunication network in 
Manchuria and to expand its telecommunication facilities with over-
seas. Communications facilities including telegraph, wireless, tele-
phone, broadcasting would be put under a centralized administration. 
6. Aviation: 
Great efforts would be made to develop aviation. The Manchukuo 
Aviation Corporation, which was in possession of better facilities 
and techniques, would take up the responsibility in the development 
of aviation. It was decided that within three years, 3,500 kilo-
meters of air lines would be put into operation. It was further 
planned that in the future, aviation lines linking with Europe and 
some important cities in East Asia, would be established. 
7. City Planning: 
It was decided that the old Ch'ang-ch'un would be completely 
reconstructed as a modern city. It would be a city of 250 square 
kilometers for a population of 5000000. In due course, Mukden, Harbin, 
- 124 -

Kirin, and Ch'i-ch'i-ha-erh would he rebuilt modern cities. 
From the description given above, it could be seen that soon 
after the founding of Manchukuo, the government had concrete plans 
for the reconstruction of the transportation system in Manchuria. 
It planned to develop an adequate transportation network for the 
benefit of national defense, social peace and order, political and 
economic development. To ensure greater efficiency through a centra-
lized control system, the Manchukuo Government entrusted the South 
Manchuria Railway Company with the management of all the railways in 
Manchuria. After the latter received such an assignment in February 
1933, it mobilized all its financial, material and human resources 
for administering the railways. 
In 1937 Manchukuo implemented its first Five Year Plan for the 
development of the rich resources in Manchuria. Since it planned to 
develop agriculture, forestry and mining, the need for better trans-
portation was deeply felt. Because of the changes in international 
situation the Manchukuo regime was called upon to implement immediately 
its various plans for resources development in the north, for the 
increase of farm production for improving the living standards of the 
people and for strengthening national defense. The fulfillment of 
these plans would be to a great degree, dependent upon the capacity 
of transportation. Subsequently, efforts were made for reorganizing 
the transportation system. In 1941 when the Pacific War had broken 
out, Manchuria became the supply base of the Japanese military 
activities. Consequently, the transportation policy of the Manchukuo 
regime was reorientated upon as a wartime basis and the transporta-
tion system was put under military control until Manchukuo was re-
turned to China on 15 August 1945.

Section 4. Manchuku0s Policy Toward Rai1way2 
A. Nationalization of Railways 
After the Manchukuo regime was founded, it recognized fully the 
significance of rail transportation in national defense and politi-
cal and economic development and especially in social welfare, culture 
and industrial development. On 9 February 1933, the railway Law, 
Public Order Number 7 was issued in which the policy governing the 
operations of railways was stipulated. 
According to the Law, with the exception of certain railways 
which would be allowed to remain under private ownership because 
they are either local railways or railways for special uses, all 
railways are to be nationalized. In. addition, the gauge of all the 
nationalized railways must be of the same width, 1.435 meters. To 
standardize the operation of the railways already built, the Manchukuo 
Government took over the Mukden-Hai-lung line, the Hu-lan-Hai-lun 
Line, and the railway lines owned by the Chsi-cht-ha-erh - Klo-shan 
Line and all the affiliated enterprises of the railways mentioned. 
In the first year, the Laws on Railway Operations (Mandate 113) was 
promulgated protecting the interests of the owners of the railways 
and the users. 
There were diverse opinions on what should be the best policy 
to govern railway management and what should be the criteria for 
building new lines. After a discussion it was agreed that on economic 
and technical grounds it would be much better to trust the South 
Manchuria Railway Company with the management of the railways since 
the corporation has years of experience in the management of rail-
ways. Thus, on 9 February 1933 the Manchukuo Government signed a 
contract with the South Manchuria Railway .company under which the 
Company was authorized by the Manchukuo regime to manage the national-
ized railways, and the nationalized shipping lines of the Sungari 
River and its subsidiaries. The following is an analysis of the 
terms of the contract. 
1. The properties and income therefrom of the Kirin-
Chlang-ch'un Railway, the Kirin-T'ung-hua Railway, the Ssu-pling-
Tlao-nan Railway, the T'ao-nan-Ang-ang-ch'i Railway, the Ch'i-
chli-haerh-Voshan Railway, the Hu-lan-Hai-lun RaLlway (including 
a part of the shipping line of the Sungari), the Mukden-Hai-lung 
Railway and the Mukden-Shan-hai-kuan Railway (including the Ta-
hu-shan-Tung-liao Line and its affiliated port facilities would be 
used as security for the credit loans of 130,000,000 Japanese yen 
arising from the construction of these railways. Under this agree-
ment the Company would administer these lines. 
2. Debts the Manchukuo Government owed to a third party 
would be paid off upon consultation with the South Manchuria Rail-
way Company, and be charged to the income from the railway operations. 
The loans borrowed from the Sino-British Company for the construction 
of the Shan-hai-kuan-Mukden Line would also be paid off from the 
operating income. However, operating income from the Shan-hai-kuan-
Mukden Line would not be used as a Surety for another new loan before 
the loans owed to the Sino-British Company were settled. 
-130-

Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
After the separation of the Mukden-Shan-hal-kuan Line from the 
Peking-Mukden Railway, the Manchukuo Government paid in 1932 to the 
Sino-British Company, 65,85o pounds to redeem its loan. The balance 
of the loan would be paid annually according to the schedule. 
3. The Manchukuo Government entrusted the South Manchuria Rail-
way Company with the construction of three railway lines: from T'ung-
hua to T'u-men River; from La-ha to Harbin; and from Tai-tung to Hai-
lung. The cost was about 100,000,000 yuan. 
L. To facilitate the construction of the railway between 
T'ung-hua and T'u-men, the Manchukuo Government bought the Wei-ch'ang 
T'u-men Light Railway with a 6,000,000 yen loan from the South Man-
churia Railway Company. 
From the above analysis, it can be seen that the operations of 
the existing railway lines and the construction of new lines were 
controlled exclusively by the South Manchuria Railway Company. On 
1 March 1933, the South Manchuria Railway Company assigned the Mukden 
Railway Administration to operate the trust railway lines2 waterways 
and their subsidiary enterprises. In the meantime, a bureau of rail-
way construction was created for planning and building new lines, 
ports and related enterprises. 
The railways handed over to the South Manchuria Railway Company 
?included seventeen lines operated by nine railway administrations with 
a total length of 2,949.6 kilometers. They were the Mukden-Shan-hai-, 
kuan Line, the Mukden-Hai-lung Line, the Kirin-Hai-lung Line,. the 
Kirin-T'ung-hua Line, the Hu-lan,Hai-lung Line, the Chli-ch'i-ha-erh-
Klo-shan Line, the T'ao-nan-Ang-ang-ch'i Line, the T'ao-nan-So-lun 
Line, the Ssu-p'ing-Tiao-nan Line, and so on. Among them, the 
Mukden-Hai-lung Line, the Hu-lan-Hai-lun Line and the Chli-ch'i-ha-erh-
Klo-shan Line were formerly owned by government and private individuals. 
Under the Railway Law, the Manchukuo Government purchased them by 
issuing a 12,000,000 yen, 6-percent bond. The Manchukuo Government 
also liquidated the financial losses incurred by the railways it pur-
chased. After the purchase, debts owed by the Mukden-Shan-hai-kuan 
line to the Sino-British Company were also transferred to the settle-
ment of South Manchuria Railway Company. 
B. Policy Toward the Railways Under Private Ownership 
Before the founding of Manchukuo and in addition to the South 
Manchuria Railway Company, there were nine railways privately owned. 
They were the Mukden-Hai-lung Line, the Hu-lan-Hai-lung Line, the 
Chli-ch'i-ha-erh-Wo-shan Line, the Kai-feng Line, the Chli-ch'i-ha-erh-
Ang-ang-ch'i Line, the Hsi-hsueh Line, the Wei-ch'ang-Tlu-men Line, 
the Ho-kang Line and the Mu-leng Line. There were also two railway 
lines in Harbin and Mukden which belonged to private owners. Since 
the founding of Manchukuo the Mukden-Hai-lung Line, the Hu-lan-Hai-lun 
Line, the Ch'i-ch'i-ha-erh-K'o-shan Line and the 1ei-ch'ang-T1u-men 
Line were purchased by the government. Thus there were only seven 
lines remaining in private ownership. 
The density of railway lines in Manchuria is small since Man-
churia is a vast area and has rich resources. The existing railway 
- 131 -

Approved For Release 1999/08/25: CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
lines are inadequate to meet the needs. Thus, in addition to taking 
direct control of the main railways the government encouraged private 
citizens to invest in local railways. Subsequently, the Ministry of 
Communications of Manchukuo started its surveys of the regional econ-
omic conditions for the planning of new railways, on the other hand, 
promulgated laws governing privately-owned railways and stipulated 
regulations on subsidies to privately-woned lines. 
In accordance with the regulations governing the subsidies to 
privately-owned railways, the owner of a railway is entitled to a 
government grant for ten years from tha date of registration. The 
amount of the grant is proportional to the paid-in capital collected 
each year. In other words, the subsidies are equal to one fourth of 
the annual paid-in capital before the railway is opened for traffic 
and equal to one sixth of the annual paid-in capital after the rail-
way is put into operation. 
The government also subsidized the new railways by giving them 
a grant to meet the payment of interest. The amount of subsidy 
corresponded to one quarter of the interest of a loan. The grant 
continued for ten years from the date of registration or from the 
date when the loan became effective. However, such a grant applied 
to railways of a 1.435-meter gauge only. 
Despite that the policy of subsidizing privately-owned railways 
was implemented at a time when railway construction materials were 
extremely scarce, those who were enthusiastic in the development of 
local industry made steady efforts. Some of the privately-owned rail-
ways even merged for greater efficiency. Consequently, great suc-
cesses have been made in the construction of railways.

C. The Policy of the Puppet Manchukuo Toward the Specialized 
Railways 
On 1 November 1935, the Ministry of Communications of Manchukuo 
published the Regulations Government the Operations of Specialized 
Railways. The purpose of the regulations was to supervise the opera-
tions of specialized railways owned by public organizations or by 
private citizens. However, the regulations did not apply to 
1. Vehicles drawn by animal or by man; 
2. Specialized railways installed inside a factory or a 
mine of the like which are connected with the main railways. 
Subsequently, on 16 May 1936, Regulation governing the operation 
of specialized railways using human or livestock as motive power. The 
regulation of this type of traction was entrusted to the provincial 
governors in Manchuria. 
The specialized railways in Manchuria operated mainly in forest 
or mining areas. This was particularly true of the railways operating 
in the lumber lands in Northern Manchuria. The mileage of forest rail-
ways in North Manchuria was fairly great. 
These forest railways were built at the same time as the Chinese 
Eastern Railway. They were built in the forest areas in the north for 
transporting railway ties and fuel woods. The rail is of the same 
standard gauge as the Chinese Eastern Railway. Thus railway care in 
one railway can operate also on another line. The length of special-
ized lines varied from several dozens of kilometers to 100. After 
? Manchukuo was founded, it nationalized all the forests. In view of 
the fact that forest resources are indispensable to industrialization, 
the Manchukuo Government made great effort to develop forest railways. 
Thus within a short space of one or two years, several hundreds of 
new railways were built in the forest areas.

D. The Planning of New Railway Networks  
For the purpose of enlarging the railway networks in Manchuria, 
the Manchukuo government assigned a number of workers to make afield 
survey of the projected railways. The purpose of the survey was to 
see whether these railways are: 
1. Helpful to the exploitation of the mining resources; 
2. Helpful to the development of agricultural and forest 
resources; 
3. Valuable in national defense; 
4. Connected with the main railways and oitiee and towns of 
great military and economic importance. 
The investigation was completed in 1942, and the plans for build-
ing new netowrks of railways were drafted. T4ta combined total of the 
mileage of the projected lines was 10,392 kilometers to be undertaken 
in three Five - Year period. 
A. The First Period  
During this period twenty eight lines will be built, 
having a total mileage of 3,033 kilometers. The construction would 
be started from 1945 and expected to be completed in 1949.

Purpose 
This line is designed as an auxiliary line to the 
283 Mukden-An-tung Railroad and to shorten the distance 
between the Industrial city of An-shan and the Port 
of Ta-tung-chiang. 
Ch'eng- Tluan-tzu- 131 This line is designed to establish a connection 
tzu-t'ung shan between Korea and the Liaotnng Peninsula. When the 
Ta-shih-chliao--Ta-tung-chiang line, the An-tung-
T'ung-hua Line, and the T'ung-hua=Ming-,yueh-kou 
Line are completed, it will be possible to operate 
a direct line between Ta-tung-chiang and Tung-pien-
tao in eastern Kirin Province. If a harbor could 
be built at Chuang-hol tbis line would become more

important. 
61 The objective is to develop the rich resources in 
Tung-pien-tao. When the construction of the harbor 
of Ta-tung-chiang is completed, this line as well 
as the Ch'eng-t'uan Line will be very valuable in 
native products trade. 
89 This line is designed for strengthening the rela-
tions between Korea and Manchuria. In additions it 
is valuable in developing the rich resources at 
Saimvaa-chi.

89 This line is designed to connect with the Tien-kuan 
Line and the Ya-pei Line so as to supplement the 
Mukden-An-tung Railway. In addition, it connects 
with the Chang-tang and T'ieh-ling Line to form a 
network. 
89 This line is valuable in the transportation of forest 
resources from Meng-chiang, and valuable also in the 
maintenance of peace and order in that area. 
63 To serve mainly the coal mines in Mao-shan and the 
iron plants in Ch'ing-chin. It is aiso indispensible 
for transporting coal produced in Ho-lung. 
88 To support the rail traffic between Korea and 
Manchuria. 
271 Like the Tun-hua-Tung-ching-ch'eng Line, this line is 
a valuable short mit for the transportation of coal 
fromMu-tan-chiang to Mukden, FU-shun and An-shan. 
139 Like the Ch'ao-yang-chen-Tun-hua line, this line is 
a valuable short cut for transportation of coal from 
Mu-tan-chiang to Mukden, Fu-shun and An-shan. 
121 To link the Jehol area with the port of Hu-lu-tao. 
It is also valuable for the transportation of mineral 
materials and livestock from Jehol and Inner Mongolia. 
57 This line is designed for the transportation of coal 
from Rei-p1iao to An-shan, thereby making connections 
-with the An-shan and F'an-ahan line. By so doing, 
the  distance between An-shan and Fei-ptiao will be 
shortenea.

This line is designed for the exploitation of the 
rich coal deposit of 300,000,000 metric tons found 
at Hsing-lung, Jehol. 
The common objective of these four lines listed on 
the left hand side is to shorten the distance be-
tween Chia-mu-tzu and Ch'ang-chlun. In addition, 
they facilitate the transportation of coal from 
Ho-kang and San-hsing to the south. The facilitate 
also the transport of coal from Ho-kang to Harbin. 
Since these lines pass through a rich farming area, 
they are very contributive to the agricultural 
economy of that region. 
This line is designed for the development of coal 
deposit reportedly amounting to 300,000,000 metric 
tons, in the district of San-hsing. 
Built for defense purposes. Less valuable for 
economic development. 
Valuable for national defense and also for. immigrant 
farmers.

Section 5. Manchukuo Policy Toward Automobile Transportation 
1. Before the Mukden Incident: 
Automobile transportation in Manchuria came into.xistence 
after World War I. In July 1918 the Chinese Government pUblishad the 
Regulation Governing long-distance automobile transportation and the 
Rules Governing the Operations of long-distance automobile tranoporta 
tion. These rules and regulations defined in detail operating terri-
tories and various requirements for operating freight and passenger 
services. Despite the rules and regulations, the roads and bridget 
were in bad shape. In monsoon season rivers and streams are greatly 
swollen and roads are muddy. Vehicular travel is difficult except in 
wintertime when roads are frozen. Moreover, traveling is dangerous, 
because of banditry and social unrest. nut, bus service existed in 
only a few cities. 
It was not until 3.928 when South Manchuria and North Manchuria 
were unified that the political situation in Manchuria became gradually 
stabilized. The stabilization in Manchuria marked the beginning of 
road building. Subsequently, automobile transportation flourished 
daily. Nevertheless, transportation capacity at that time was extremely 
low mainly because of insufficient capital and poor management. It was 
not unusual that there were dozens of companied operating the same bus 
line with each company having only two buses or trucks-. This made it 
very difficult for the government to regulate automobile transportation. 
2. Alter the Maden Incident 
Atter the occupation of Manchuria by the Japanese, the Puppet 
Manchukuo Regime was founded. Using Manchuria as a base for aggres 
sion, Japan gradually expanded its sphere of influence. For the purpose. 
of consolidating the national defense, japan spared no efforts in the 
exploitation of the rich resources in Manchuria. This, first of all 
called for the development of a mode of transportation. Consequently, 
the Manchukuo government, in addition to building railways made a great 
effort to build and overhaul the highway system. In May 1933, Manchukuo 
declared that the automobile transportation enterprise was subject to 
the supervision of the Ministry of communication in its public law 
Number 430. In addition, the Bureau of National Highways was created, 
an agency in charge especially, of building highways. It was planned 
that during a period of ten years 60,000 kilometers of highway would 
be built. In fact, construction began in 1932. 
Highway transportation operated by the government or by pri-
vate citizens. The publicly-owned highways included: 
1. Highways parallel with the railways: 
2. Highways in place of railways: 
3. Highways of political and economic significance. 
With the exception of three types of highways operated by 
government capital, all other highways were operated by private

Since the publicly-owned highways were subsidiaries of the 
nationalized railways system ofManchuria they were run by the South 
Manchuria Railway Company. In order to strengthen highway administra-
tion under a centralized authority, the South Manchuria Railway Company 
established specialized organizations at various levels of the railway 
administration. As a result) great success was achieved in the adminis-
tration of automobile transportation. 
3. A Further Analysis of Manchukuo Policy on AUtomobile Trans-
portation 
In 1937 the Ministry of Communications of Manchukuo issued the 
Regulations Governing the Automobile Transportation Enterprises. All 
automobile transportation firms were owned by the government or by pri-
vate capital.' The following is a summary of the policies dealing with 
automobile transportations 
1. All highways were under government control or under 
private management. 
Highways which served temporarily as substitutes to 
national railways or those which were parallel in the railways or which 
were vital to the execution of a national policy were all operated by 
the government. All the other highways were open to private concerns. 
2. With the exception of special cases, bus lines were 
. operated by one company only. 
3. For a greater efficiency, highway transportation 
industry will be gradually expanded. 
4. Priority on new lines will be given to franchised 
operations to protect their interest against their competitors. 
Priority will also be given to the application from public organiza-
tions for operating highways in their territories. 
5. Pane enterprises operating on fixed lines would be 
supervised by the Ministry of Communications. City or local bus lines 
were licensed by city or local governments. 
In 1937 the Regulation Governing the Expansion of 
Automobile Transportation Lines was issued for expanding bus services 
increasing the nuMber of cars. In 1937 the Outline on Reorganization 
of Automobile Transportation Industry was proclaimed in which private 
ownership of bus lines VW permissible in Fengtien, Kirin and Antung 
Provinces. Bus lines were also jointly operated by Dairen Municipality 
Transportation Association and the local authorities'. in subsequent 
years the privately-owned automobile transportation enterprise was 
greatly enlarged. At that time the mileage of highways reached 30,000 
kilometers in Manchuria. The nutber of automobiles and trucks was above 
24,000. Data related to the operations of automobile transportation 
might be given as follows:

? So far as the automobile transportation in Manchuria was con-
cerned, the most prosperous year was 1941. Because of World .War II 
the policy of communications underwent some changes. Freight traffic 
was given priority over passenger traffic.. The Ministry of Communica-
tions issued regulations governing the operations of bus linea in 
1941.- The purpose of the regulations was to regulate the use of auto-
mobiles under public or private ownership, so that freight transporta-
? tion may achieve a maximum efficiency. In addition, the government 
? encouraged the use of charcoal as a substitute for gasoline so that 
, gasoline might be used for the transport of vital materials. 
I. Policy Toward Automobile Industry. 
As regards the automobile industry in Manchukuo, there Were 
some small-scale .repair shops. As automobile transportation flourished,. 
the. South Manchuria Railway Company and other concerns Jointly founded 
the Tung-ho AutomobileCorporation in Mukden. The chief mission of 
this corporation was to assemble imported automobile parts into cars. 
The corporation manufactured car bodies and accessories. Besides, the 
.corporation maintained repair shops in key cities to keep up a minimum 
nuMber Of ears in use. To strengthen the manufacturing division of 
the corporations it merged with the Manchukuo Automobile Manufacturing 
Corporation. Plans were made to expand the market and produce cars 
suitable for use in theiclimate and topography of Manchuria. Before 
these plans were carried out Manchuria was returned to China.

Section 6. Manchukuo Policy Toward Waterway Transportation 
Is THE ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINE FOR WATERWAY TRANSPORTATION 
The importance of waterway transportation in Manchuria has been 
described above. Under the Manchukuo regime much importance was at-
tached to the waterway transportation. This can be seen from its 
policy on communications included in its economic reconstruction. 
Before the Mukden Incident the administration of waterways was 
in charge of the Harbin Navigation Bureau, the customs offices in 
Ying-k'ou and Antung or local governments. : After Manchukuo came into 
power, all these agencies were either combined or abolished and a cen-
tralized administrative organ was formed. In March 1932 the Ministry 
of Communications established the Division of Navigation which was in 
Charge of the administration of waterways, ports and harbors, the li-
censing of vessels and crews, the erection of signals and buoys and 
other, related matters. Although the name of the division had undergone 
changes a number of times, the sections remained the same. These sec-
tions were those on navigation, on inland rivers, on engineering and 
on investigation. The regular function of the navigation division was 
never interrupted. 
In June 1933, the Manchukuo Government formulated a permanent 
administrative system for strengthening the local navigation adminis-
trative organs. /n July of the same year navigation bureaus were 
established at Ying-k'ou, Antung and Harbin. The Harbin Navigation 
Bureau established a branch at Al-hun, subbranches at Kirin, HU-lin . 
and MU-ho? and assigned representatives to stations at.Fu-chin and I-lan. 
The ling-k'ou Navigation Buredu established branches at Dairen and 
Hu-lu-tao. The Antung Navigation Bureau sent officials to San-tao-lang 
tlou. The territories under the jurisdiction of these Bureaus are 
given in Table 39.

II. SHIPPING ORGANIZATIONS 
. \ 
Before the Mukden Incident shipping service organizations in the - 
Sungari 'included the Northeast Navigation Bureau, The Postal Shipping 
Bureau of the Sungari River and the Amur River, the KUang-hsin (Ship-
ping Company) and the Northeast Shipbuilding Company. These Organiza-
tions still remained in business under- the supervision of the MiniStry.-. 
of Communications after the Manchukuo government was founded. In 
February 1933, the Puppet Manchukuo Government and the South Manchuria 
Railway Company signed a contract according to which all matters valet-
ing?to navigation were transferred to the corporation. Accordingly, _ 
the corporation established in March 19330 the. Harbin Navigation Bureau 
in control of shipping along the Sungari and?the.Ammr. 
The 'public and private shipping companies along the Sungari or-
ganized a joint association in an attempt to eliminate cut-throat corn-.. 
petition, promote and protect their mutual interest. The association 
was approved by the Ministry of Communications, and ail activities 
were under the supervision of the Ministry. Similarly0.-ship owners? 
associations were also established in Ying-keoul An-tung, Kirin_ and 
Harbin. ? In Mnrch.1934.the Manchukuo Government. reformed all the regu-
lations relating to navigation. Under the new regulations, supervision 
Of shipping which belonged previously to the departments of industry 
was transferred to.the navigation bureaus.. Subsequently, inland river? 
navigation became more prosperous day after day, and the local indus,. 
tries were greatly benefitted from the progress in navigation.? . 
In June, 1933 and in July.1934, the Manchukuo Government issued ? 
the Laws Governing the River Navigation and Regulations Governing the - 
Navigation of small veSsels. Under the laws and regulations shipping, 
P.18-boat services and ahip rental in rivers or lakes were subject to - 
government control.

III. ACCOMESISEMENTS IN SHIPPING ADMINISTRATION 
Since it took over the Liao Ho. Engineering Bureau, a bureau of 
international importance, the Ying-k'ou Navigation Bureau was very 
active in dredging and in constructing seawalls: and embankments. It 
manufactured dredges for removing the silt accumulated at the mouth: 
of the river. It also made plans for ice breaking. It rented some ice 
breakers from the MU-la Co., Shanghai. At the end of. February 1936, 
the Bureau spent one month in ice breaking operations. As a result, 
navigation was resumed three weeks before the arrival of the ice-melt-
ing season. Besides/ the Bureau erected at the north cove of Chang-
? hosing Island in Fuchou Wan some third-class lighthouses (visible three 
or four milesaway). This greatly facilitated navigation. 
? Shipping in the Ya-lu Ho was for a long time almost completely 
under the control of the Koreans. In view of the necessity that some 
signals and buoys be established in the lower parts of the Ya-111 Ho 
the An-tung Navigation Bureau consulted with the Koreans and Jointly 
established a technical committee for improving the navigation facili-
ties in the lower part of the Ya-lu, especially those parts below 
Ta-tung-kou. In the meantime, rock excavating, dredging and surveying 
Were undertaken between. An-tung and Linkiang. 
Accomplishments of the Harbin Navigation Bureau included: 
L. The dredging of the bar located at San-haing; 
2. The excavation of rocks in the period of freezing; 
3. The installation of signals and buoys along the Sungari 
R. and rivers on national borders, and 
4. The development of night navigation.

IV. ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN VESSEL REGISTRATION 
When Manchukuo was established in 1932, the Shipping industry in, 
Manchuria with Harbin as a center had 116 steamers with a total of 
49,300 tons, and 134 tugs totaling 61,300 tons. The Manchukuo Govern-
ment ordered that all vessels be registered in order to apply govern-
ment control on navigation. The Manchukuo Government also inspected . 
ships so as to eliminate accidents. In order to implement the policies 
mentioned above, Manchukuo issued the Laws Governing River Navigation, 
Regulations Governing Inland River Shipping and Regulations Governing 
the Qualifications of Ports. 
Besides Manchukuo issued Regulations Governing the issuance of 
Licenses, Regulations Governing Navigation Along Rivers by Small 
Vessels. All Manchukuo vessels had to be legally registered. In 1936 
ships registered under Banchukuo nationality were: /nee Table on

V. REGISTRATION OF CREW MEMBERS ' 
The Chinese authorities in Manchuria had no specific law to 
register and protect crew members. In February 1934 the Ministry of 
Communications issued the Temporary Regulations GoverningAhe Regis-
tration of Crews. After that crews were subject to government regu-
lations. In additiOn to the issuance of licenses to the crews, an 
examination system was established for promoting crew members. Crew 
members were required to take a basic training course. By the and of 
1936 there were 1,068 certified crew members. 
Vessels operating in Ying -klou and Antung hired pilots according 
to their own systems before the Mukden Incident. After Manchukuo was 
founded, the government ordered all the pilots to join the Pilot 
association. Furthermore, it issued the Regulation Governing the 
Inspection of Pilots Along the YA -lu Ho. The Ying-kliu Port also 
introduced a pilot regulation law. It should be mentioned that in 
Antung there were four Japanese pilots and one Chinese, while in 
Ying-ktou there were two Japanese with one alien. 
VI. ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN RIVER CONTROL 
The Ministry of Communications never interrupted its survey of 
the rivers and streams, particularly the Liao Ho, the Sungari and the 
Nonni. The function of the Division of River Control consisted of 
the following: 
1. To facilitate river navigation; 
2. To undertake flood control projects for cities; 
3. To develop hydroelectric facilities and 
4. To undertake irrigation projects for farm lands. 
Before.the Mukden Incident, the agencies in charge of river 
navigation in Manchuria were: 1. The two engineering bureaus lo-
cated respectively in the upper and the lower parts of the Liao Ho 
whose function was to maintain the waters at Ying-klou at a certain 
depth and to facilitate navigation of the Liao Ho. The Northeast 
River Course Bureau/a-function was to keep the navigation routes in 
the Sungari River in good order. These bureaus were not river con-
servation bureaus. River conservation projects were undertaken 
mainly by local autonomous governments. These projects were mainly 
very simple dikes for flood control. Thera was no centralized 
planning in river conservation and, as a result, the achievement 
in river conservation was meager. 
, After Manchukuo was founded, Manchuria was affected by floods 
in 1932 and in 1934. Great damages were inflicted on the local 
populace. Because of the serious floods, the Manchukuo Government 
was forced to create a Second Technical Section under the Division 
of National Roads. This Section was responsible for investigating

Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
the river and for river engineering. In 1937 the Division of National 
Roads was abolished and replaced by the Civil Engineering Bureau under 
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Welfare. In the meantime, a hydro-
electric power reconstruction bureau was created under the jurisdiction 
of the Ministry of Industries. In July of the same year the Bureau of 
Civil Engineering was abolished, while its function was transferred to 
the Division of Navigation of the Ministry of Communications. In July, 
1938, the Division of Navigation was reorganized into the Division of 
Waterways. In 1943 it was reorganized into the Division of River 
. improvement. 
The next topic we are going to discuss is the law governing the 
use of rivers and streams in Manchuria. Right at the beginning of the 
founding of Manchukuo there were no new regulations governing the use 
of rivers and streams. Manchukuo adopted the laws issued by the 
Chinese government in 1930 with some additional stipulations of its 
own. Later, as the various industries concerned with river trans-
portation greatly developed, and the economic significance of the 
rivers increased, the Manchukuo regime felt the need for a permanent 
system of river laws. Finally, in 1939, Manchukuo issued new laws 
governing the use of rivers and on river conservation, containing de-
tailed stipulations. 
- River survey and improvement activities were undertaken step by 
step under the Regulations for River Control, Water Conservation and 
Land Improvement issued in 1937. In the same year, surveying activ-
ities were chiefly conducted on the Liao-Ho System. Surveys of the 
Sungari and other rivers would be conducted on allater date by the 
Division of Waterways. 
In 1941 the Division of Waterways and the Agency of the Liao Ho 
,Survey were reorganized into the River Control and Survey Bureau under 
the Ministry of Communications. The bureau was in charge of the 
survey of all the rivers in Manchuria. In 1942 the survey of the Liao 
Ho was completed and its control plan was drafted. After that, the 
center of river surveying activities was shifted to the Sungari. In 
1945 most of the investigations and surveys of the upper parts of the 
Sungari, above Harbin, and its tributaries were completed leaving the 
control plans unfinished. Surveys of other rivers were only partially 
completed. 
VII. THE QUESTION OF INTERNATIONAL RIVERS 
Rivers which flow along the Chinese Russian borders are the Amur, 
the Ussuri, the Argun and Lake Rsing-kai. During the Manchukuo 
regime, attempts were made by Manchukuo to negotiate with the USSR 
for navigation freedom and safety. At that time, the Harbin Naviga-
tion Bureau was responsible for the negotiations with the Soviets 
concerning technical matters. 
The Ya-lu Ho flows along the Chinese-Korean border. Matters-
related to navigation of that river were dealt with by a .technical 
committee jointly organized by China and Korea.

Section 7.  Manchukuo Policy Toward Aviation 
I. A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AVIATION BEFORE THE MUKDEN INCIDENT 
Aviation in Manchuria has a short history. Before the unification 
of South and North Manchuria the Manchurian regime established a mili-
tary aviation department and military aviation school. Although the 
National Government planned to open a civil airline from Pei-tai-ho to 
Chiang-01112n via Chin-chou and Mukden, it never implemented its plan. 
In April, 1929, the Japanese Aviation Company succeeded in open-
ing an airline from Dairen to Tokyo with Sinuichow as a midway station. 
This line was considered the first airline in the history of Manchur-
ian civilian aviation. 
AVIATION ADMINISTRATION UNDER MANCHUKUO 
In order to develop aviation the Manchukuo Government issued its 
economic reconstruction program in March 1933, in which it declared 
that an airline mileage of 3,500 kilometers would be established. It 
also declared its plans to establish airlines to Europe and Japan. 
In June of the same year it was decided that the Division of Highways 
ot the Ministry of Communications would be in charge of the aviation 
administration temporarily. 
In view of the peculiar nature of air transportation and for 
greater efficiency in management, the Manchukuo regime was in favor 
of the doctrine that civil airlines should be operated privately 
rather than by the government. In September 1932, the Manchuria 
Aviation Corporation, Limited, was formed. It was a special corpor-
ation which received a certain amount of governmental subsidy for 
following the national policy and bringing about a maximum efficiency. 
Since the corporation was directly and indirectly under permanent 
protection and support, it developed rather rapidly. 
As the air transportation industry was growing daily, a division 
of aviation was established under the Ministry of Communications. 
The duties of the division were: 
1. To regulate, promote and supervise air transportation; 
2. To develop aviation techniques, guide and supervise the 
manufacture of aircraft, handle the inspection and registration of 
aircraft, train pilots, and control weather bureaus and astronomical 
observations; 
3. To be in charge of the administration and construction 
of airport facilities and to construct and operate air communications 
and 
4. To develop new airlines. 
Besides, aviation stations were established in Chlang-chlun, 
Mukden, Chli-chti-ha-erh, Chfeng-te, Harbin and Mu-tan-chiag. There 
were agehcies in charge of local matters such as:

The operation of airports and aviation facilities; 
2, Aviation safety; 
3. Air rescue operations and investigation of air 
traffic accidents: 
111 1939 all the weather bureaus and observatories under the 
jUrisdiction of the Central Observatory were transferred to the 
Ministry of Communications. The objective of the transfer was 
to strenghten climatic and astronomical observations and to 
enhance air safety. ? 
III. A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MANCHUKUO AVIATION CORPORATION, 
LIMITED . ? 
. The Manchukuo Aviation Corporation, Limited, was the sole 
organ in Charge of air transportation in Manchuria. IT was 
established on 26 September 1932. The capital of the corporation 
was jointly contributed by the Manchukuo Governments the South 
Manchuria Railway Company, the Mitsubishi Company and the 
Sumitomo Company. It was a limited stock Company with a paid-
in capital of 8,500,000 yen. It was supervised and directed by 
the Manchukuo Government. The scope of the corporation's 
activities included: 
1. Passenger, mail and freight services within the 
borders of Manchukuo and with neighboring countries; 
2. The manufacture and repair of aircraft. 
3. Aviation photography 
4. Matters not elsewhere mentioned and approved by the 
government, including: 
1. The rental of airplanes and other related 
matters 
2. Matters related to aviation, includingt, 
a. Enterprises conductive to the development 
of aviation 
b. Dissemination of aviation information 
The headquarters of the corporation. WAS established at 
Nnkden (then moved to Chtang-chlun) It had a branch office in 
Tokyo. Its services reached MUkden, Chiang=chlun and Harbin 
Where there were branch offices handling passenger traffic.

IV. THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MANCHUKUO IN ITS AVIATION 
. The airlinee which had a regular flight shcedule were 
owned by the Manchukuo Aviation corporation. They grew up 
. extremely fast. In the year of itg extablishment in 1932 
the total mileage of aviation lines was 995 kilometers, 
roughly 18 times the former mileage. The speed with which 
the airline developed was greater than originally planned. 
This wai due to the favorable topographly, climate and air, 
,In fact, these factors had re&uced air traffic accidents 
to a minimum. 
The rapid development of Manchukuo aviation may be 
seen from Table 42.

II. ACCOMPLISHKENT ON TRANSPORTATION UNDER THE CENTRALIZED' 
MANAGEMENT OF THE SOUTH MANCHURIA RAILWAY COMPANy 
Section 1. A General Description of the Operations Under the South 
Manchuria Railway Company 
In February 1933 the ManOhukuo government entrusted the South 
Manchuria Railway Company with the management of all the national 
railways, the formerly government?owned Sungari shipping lines and the 
affiliated enterprises of the two (including the highways). Sub?
sequently? the South Manchuria Railway Company reorganized all the 
transportation systems (particularly the railways). In March 1933 the 
General Railway Administration Was established by the corporation for 
unifying the management of all the national railways. At that time 
.the total Mileage of railways was 2,946.6 kilometers. Under the 
General Railway Administration there were nine railway administrations 
respectively in charge of the business of the railways under their 
management. Each of the railways has its own background and functions 
and hence different organizations and policies. Furthermore, the 
equipment and facilities were obsolete, and inadequate for use. Since 
the establishment of the General Railway Administration all of the ' 
national railways in Manchukuo were unified under a centralized body. 
A thorough reorganization programmes carried out in railways as well 
as other transportation systems for paving the way for defense, 
effective governmental and industrial development. 
In March, 1935, after the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway 
from the Soviet Union, all of the railway lines in Manchuria were 
operated by the South Manchuria Railway Company. In October 1933, 
the General Office of the Railway Administration was changed into the 
General Office of the Railroad Administration. In the meantime, rail?
way lines formerly under the corporation's direct control were put 
under the jurisdiction of the Railway Administration. Since then 
both the corporation's lines and the national lines were exclusively 
controlled by the Railway Administration. As a result of a centralized 
management system, transportation in Manchuria developed rapidly. 
Data on railway operations under the administration of the South 
Manchuria Railway .Company are shown in Table 44. Factors accounted 
for the accomplishment were mainly the following: 
1. The South Manchuria Railway Company had more than twenty 
years of experience in railway operations. It had efficient 
operational structure and well trained and experienced personnel. 
2. The Japanese who worked in the South Manchuria Railway 
Company wereaspirants of Japan's continental policy and they worked
hard. 
3. Social order was relatively stable. Accordingly, the 
demand for transportation services increased daily. Besides this, 
Japan had done its best to supply capital, materials and techniques.

The first period was a period associated with the General Office 
of the Railway Administration. In this period the railway lines known 
as corporation lines were operated by the railway department of the 
South Manchuria 'Railway Company, while the national railways of 
Manchukuo were operated by the Railway Administration. With the 
General Office of the Railway Administration playing a major role, a 
centralized administrative system was established. Accordingly, the 
railway administrations were reorganized along the line of modern 
enterprises. In addition,. new lines were built for strengthening the 
capacity of transportation. In March 1935 when the Chinese Eastern 
Railway waspurchased from the Soviet Union, the capacity of railway 
transportation had been farther strengthened. Enterprises affiliated 
with the railways including inland shipping lines, highways, harbors 
and ports, were put under centralized administration. 
The second period associated with the General Office of the Rail-
way Administration. In this period the national lines and the corpora-
tion lines were all put under the exelusive control of the General 
Office of the Railway-Administration. As part of the First Five-Year 
Economic Plan many new lines were built. In fact, this period is 
considered as the most prosperous period in the history of railways 
in Manchuria. Since the outbreak of the Pacific Mar railway trans-
portation declined. After the return of Manchuria to China the rail-
ways were repeatedly demolished. At present the situation of the 
railways in Manchuria is even far worse than before the Mukden 
Incident. 
The third period associated with wartime control. After the 
Pacific Mar broke out, all the railways in Manchuria, North China, 
Central China and in Korea were put under Japanese control on a war-
time basis. The Japanese established the Bureau of the Continental 
Railways at Chlang-chyun for the control of wartime transportation. 
The Bureau was dissolved when the Chinese took over Manchuria. The 
following is a description of the railway administrative policies in 
different periods. 
1. First Period 
? When Manchukuo entrusted the South Manchuria Railway Company 
with the management of the national lines, the South Manchuria 
Company established the Railway Administration. The purpose of the 
administration was to bring the national lines under a centralized 
authority. However, the national lines were operated independent of 
the railways owned by the corporation. In other words, there were 
two administrative systems for the railways. Under the Railway 
Administration there were nine railway administration i.e. the Kirin-
Chlang-chlun, the Kirin-Tun-hua? the Ssu-ping-Tlao-nan, the T'ao-
nan-Angang-chtil the Tiao-nan,So-lun, the Chli-chli-ha-erh-Klo-shan? 
the Hu.aan-Hal-lun, the Mukden-Hai-lung, and the Mukden-Shan-hai-kuan 
administrations. They controlled seventeen railways with a total mile-
age of 2,949.6 kilometers. In the past a railway in Manchuria, re-
gardless of its being owned by government or by individuals, was 
operated as a personal property for profit. Road maintenance safety 
and road improvement Were reflected. The public interest was for-
gotten. Despite the fact that all the railways were operated by one 
government, each railway administration acted independently of each ? 
other and established no coordination with others for joint use of 
personnel and facilities. Accordingly, the capacity of transportation 
-190-
Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
was low. The railway at that time hardly lived up to a modern means 
of transportation. It was needless to say that the Railway Adtinistra. 
tion was serving the interest of the Japanese, but much attention 
should have been paid to the railways for the welfare of the people. 
Under the nal support of the South Manchuria Railway- Company the 
Railway Administration started its reform of the railway-operations. 
In the meantime, it assigned its own staff to stations of the newly 
built railway lines to assist them in business operations. Further-
more, the railway administration also endeavored to keep the peace 
and order along the railway-regions. It tried to promote industry 
and commerce as a step toward increasing the income-of railway opera-
tions. It had reached its goal although its expenditures on opera-
tions, on expansion and construction of new lines were increasing 
yearly. 
The General Office of the Railway Administration was 
established on the eve of the MUkden Incident. Tension was mounting 
everywhere. Even the Japanese staff in the Railway Administration 
was refrained from drastic reform in order to avoid agitation. The 
Japanese therefore gave preference to the improvement of railway 
facilities and offered better services: to the public. In regard to 
the existing organization and employment system, the Japanese took 
a conservative attitude. The original nine railway administrations 
were so merged that their internal structure was not changed. This 
attitude was evidently-used as a means to calm the Chinese workers. 
They claimed that all railway lines were owned by members of one 
family in order to bring about a friendly atmosphere favorable to 
reform. 
? At the beginning the Railway Administration adopted a policy 
of centralization. However, near the end of the first period all the 
railway administrations were given certain power to make decisions 
at their own discretion. In order to strengthen the railway lined 
for national defense, a supervisory agency was established which was 
in charge giving assistance to the railways. 
During this period, in addition to the railways, enterprises 
affiliated with the railways like the shipping lines in the Sungari 
and the highways were brought under a centralized administration for 
greater efficiency. 
2. Second Period 
From the point of view of railway administration, the first 
period (under the Railway Administration) may be called a preparatory 
period for achieving unification. Since the reorganization of the 
Railway Administration into the Railroad Administration in 1936 and 
the consolidation of both the "Corporation Lines" and the national 
Lines" a centralized control of all railways in Manchuria was 
established. Since this then, not only the lack of coordination in 
the administration of railways had been eliminated, but the waterways, 
highways, airlines were all brought under a centralized administrative 
system with railways as the largest group among them. In short all 
the transportation systems functioned as an organic whole. 
Having achieted unification in transportation systems, 
traffic moved in all directions, thereby bringing about the prosperity-' - 
to cities and towns, ,to industry and agriculture, and Strengthening

national defense. In addition, government measures in relation to 
education, sanitation, prohibition of opium, prevention of pestilence 
and mail service reached all Manchuria. Above all, a great progress 
was made in developing hydroelectric power supply, fuel, electric 
supply, in forest development and in increasing agricultural, in-. 
dustrial and mining production. This on. the other hand, became a 
temptation to Japan which then introduced a series of aggressive 
policies to Manchuria, including the Five-Year Industrial Development 
Plan, the Northern Frontier Development Plan, the Resettlement Policy 
and the Territory Expansion Plan. 
At the end of the second period the mileage of the railways in 
Manchuria was more than 10,000 kilometers, which is greater than that 
included in Manchukuo's Economic Reconstruction Plan. In this period 
the volume of transportation had been greatly augmented. This can be 
seen from Table 44 in the preceeding section. The major administrative 
policies are described below. 
1. All of the railways in Manchuria were controlled by a 
simple administrative organ. With the railways as a center of the 
system all the waterways, highways, harbors and ports, sea routes, Were 
operated as an organic whole. The various types of transportation in-
dustries cooperated with each other in operations and in financial 
matters. In short, they were prepared for meeting the wartime situa-
tion. 
2. To render its support of government's policies of develop-
ing the economy i-11 North Manchuria and of expanding the heavy industry, 
the Railway Administration built new lines and in the meantime 
im-
proved itd services to the public through a set of reasonable rates. 
In 1937 the South Manchuria Railway Company handed over the 
administrative power in the Kwantung Leased Territory to Manchukuo. 
In the meantime it handed over the heavy industry to the Manchurian 
Heavy Industry Development Corporation, Limited. Thus, the South 
Manchuria Railway Company concentrated solely on Manchuria's 
transportation. 
3, For the strengthening of the "Economic Sphere" and in 
addition to the use of Dairen and Ying-klou, Japan operated the 
An-tung, the Korean Line and the three ports newly-built in North 
Korea as trade routes with Japan. In 19370 the North China 
Communication Corporation, limited, was created. Since the creation 
of the corporation trade between North China and Manchuria was 
greatly stimulated through the Shan-hal-kuan and the Ku-peirklou 
railways. 
At that time the Manchurian transportation reached the standards 
established in the world. For instances the Asian Express was safe, 
comfortable, accurate, fast, and its charge was reasonable. The 
distance from Dairen to Harbin is 940 kilometers. The Asian Express 
could cover it within twelve hours. The speed was the greatest in 
Eastern Asia. The reason that the Asian Express could set such a 
record may be seen from the following factors: 
.1. The composition of the oars (Safe and Comfortable) 
1. locomotive (Pacific Type), maximum speed 110 kilo-
meters per hour, average 80 kilometers per hour.

? 3. The Direction of Management in the Third Period 
In December 1941, the Pacific War broke out and Manchuria was 
overcast with war clouds. Following Japan, Manchukuo declared a state 
ofeemergenoy The;;South.Manchuria Railway Company' began to take 
emergency measures. As a first step, it moved its planning and 
management sections to Chlang-chlun so that it might coordinate ite 
activities with those of the Manchukuo Government.. Meanwhile, for the 
purpose of achieving a centralized control over the four major railway 
systems, the Korean Railway, the Manchurian Railway, the North China 
Railway and the Central China Railway, the Chlang-chtun Bureau of the 
Continental Railway Transportation Consultative Conference was created. 
Since the all-important policies in connection with communications and 
transportation were formulated on the basis of the decisions made in 
the consultative conference. 
Daring this period the directions once followed in the second 
period were abolished. Following the progress of war various emergency 
measures were taken. According to the emergency measures, war materials 
and supplies were given preference in transportation. Transport of 
civilian goods was greatly discouraged. 
As the. scope of the war was fUrther enlarged, sea transporta-
tion was interrupted. This had forced Japan to send its war materials 
and supplies through the continental lines. Consequently, the traffic 
in the MUkdenShan-hai-kuan line, the An-tung-Mukden Line, the Ch'ang-
chtun-Tu,men Line and the Tlu-men-Chia-mu-ssu Line increased greatly. 
Since the South Manchuria Railway Company had achieved a centralized 
management system during the first an second periods, its transporta-
tion capacity had been sufficiently strengthened. Accordingly, during 
the third period, in addition to the-transportation of :tremendous 
quantities of war materials, it handled a very large volume of 
civilian goods. In 1943 the volume of transportation reached a record 
high. 
As mentioned above transportation policies in the third 
period were determined by the Continental Railway Transportation Con-
sultative Conference rather than by the South Manchurian Railway 
alone. Thus the third period was identified as the period of the 
Continental Railway Transportation Consultative Conference..

Section 3. Administrative Organization 
Although there had been some changes in the organizational 
structure of the Manchuria railways, the organizational system 
generally followed the pattern of the South Manchuria Railway 
Company with some modification according to local circumstances. The 
middle-of-the-road, departmental system and the divisional system 
were adopted. 
1. During the first period, i.e. the period of the Railway 
Administration, there were two administrative systems. a. The 
Department of Railways under the South Manchuria Railway Company in 
charge of the "Company Lines" with its two agencies in Dairen and 
Mukden; b. The head office of the Railway Administration in charge 
of the national railways of Manchukuo with its headquarters located 
at Mukden and with its agencies located at various places. In 1933, 
at the request of the Governor of Korea for the management of the 
railways located in North Korea, the North Korea Railway Administra-
tion WAS created in Manchuria. These three administrations were under 
the control of the general director of the South Manchuria Railway 
Company. 
In addition, for the purpose of building new railway lines, 
a number of railway construction bureaus were established with branch 
bureaus at various centers. 
In April, 1934, reorganization plans were carried out in the 
railway administrations in Manchuria. The original nine railway 
administrations were abolished, while four railway administrations, 
three agencies and one navigation bureau were established. The four 
railway administrations were the Mukden (later moved to Chin-hsien), 
the Chlang-chlun, the Harbin, and the T'ao-nan (later moved to Ch'i-
chli-ha-erh) railway administrations. The three railway agencies 
were the Chin-hsien, Ssu-p'ing and Mx-men agencies, while the 
navigation bureau was the Harbin Navigation Bureau in charge of the 
navigation facilities of the Amur and the Sungari. 
In March 1935 the Chinese Eastern Railway had been taken 
over from the Soviet Union. At first, the railway was put under the 
management of the Harbin Railway Administration. In October of that 
year the railway administration reorganized and put the western part 
of the Chinese Eastern Railway under the Chti-chli-ha-erh Railway 
Administration. 
After the reorganization, railway administration became more 
efficient. Subsequently, the centralized administrative system was 
changed to a new system under which the local railway administrations 
were given greater power. Sixteen supervisory agencies were estab-
lished and inspectors were assigned to various railways for field 
duties. As a result, the railway operations showed a very satisfactory 
improvement.

Section 4. Railway Transportation Facilities  
When the Railway Administration was first established, it 
knew there were many defects and deficiencies in railway facilities. 
A careful survey discovered that the poor quality of the railway 
facilities was beyond imagination. Not only the rails and ties were 
rotten, but the macadamized layers were too thin for safety. In 
addition, most of the bridges were built of wood, incapable of carrying 
heavy loads or highspeed trains. Consequently, it was *possible to 
achieve accuracy in the operations. In rainy seasons the roadbed was 
often damaged. To make the situation worse, bandits raided the railway 
lines now and then. Many accidents occurred. Indeed the officers and 
workers of the railways were working in an extremely difficult situation. 
The Railway Administration estimated originally that the 
annual railway maintenance expenses would be between 10,000,000 and 
15,000,000 Japanese yen. Actually, it spent 30,000,000 yen yearly. 
The Increase was mainly due to the replacement of the light steel 
tracks with heavy ones, the addition of more sleepers and more maca-
damized layers. As these efforts were being made, the tracts had been 
improved yearly, and the lines within stations had been also augmented. 
Area occupied by the railway stations increased daily, and the signal 
facilities were further strengthened. Even water supplied for loco-
motives were completed within a short time. Accordingly, the capacity 
of rail transportation gradually increased, and the railways in 
Manchuria reached nearer to modern standard. 
Telephone and telegram facilities were poor and insufficient 
in the past. In the first year under the centralized management of 
the Railway Administration, 6,000,000 yen was spent in the installation 
of single and double telephone lines. A network of telephone and 
telegraph exchanges was established with the General Railway Adminis-
tration as its center. The completion of the communication has 
greatly facilitated railway operations, particularly in the transfer 
of cars in railway patrols. 
When the General Railway Administration began to take over 
the management of the national lines, the total mileage of railways 
was 3,000 kilometers with 282 locomotives, 327 passenger cars and 
1,O30 freight cars. As the cars were of different make most of them 
were useless without reparing. The situation was a result of the lack 
of inspection and the shortage of repairing facilities. Although the 
General Railway Administration did its best to repair the oars, they

were far from sufficient in meeting the needs. . This was deeply felt 
in the winter time when the traffic increased tremendously. At that 
time for the purpose of conquering the difficulties arising from the. 
shortage of cars, both staff officers and cars were borrowed from the 
Korean Corporation and the South Manchuria Railway Company. In the 
meantime the Railway Administration ordered a great number ot loco-
motives, freight cars and passenger cars, established newplants for 
producing railway vehicles and introduced an inspection system.

Besides, the necessity for special water supply facilities for 
locomotives is one of the characteristics in the operation of the 
railways in Manchuria. Water supply becomes a critical problem in 
cold weather, especially in alkaline regions and during severe cold 
seasons. The distribution of railway water supply facilities is 
given in Table 52.

Section S. Railway Traffic Regulations 
Since the establishment of the Manchukuo regime in Manchuria, great 
efforts had been made by the government in the maintenance of order and 
peace, in the unification of monetary systems, and in the utilization of 
natural resources. As a result, the railway business was good and the 
railway system gradually became an efficient transportation network under 
centralized management. A description of the business policies of the 
railway administration is given below. 
A. Policy Toward Transportation 
1. Passenger Transportation 
At the time the General Railroad Administration was 
established, there were fewpassenger cars. These cars were not uniform 
in standards and many of them were virtually useless. Thus, in addition, 
to overhauling and repairing old cars, the railway administration ex?
panded the equipment and facilities in the workshops of the various 
railways established a car inspection system and added new cars into 
operation. During the winter season when traffic was heavy, it borrowed 
train engineers and cars from the South Manchuria Railway Company and the 
Korean Railway Administration. 
A reorganization program WAS executed on the nationalized 
railwaya operated by the General Railway Administration* The speed of 
the train was increased. After the Chinese Eastern Railway WAS taken 
over by Manchukuo the wide gauge of that railway was narrowed and the 
Asia Special Express was able to operate between Dairen and Harbin.. The 
amount of time for the express train between Dairen and Harbin was re?
duced by more than eight hours. 
Owing to the great increase of passengers along all the 
railway lines in Manchuria, the existing hotels were far from meeting 
the actual needs. Subsequently, the General Railway Administration 
established one hot spring hotel at Hsingcheng and a number of hotels 
and restaurants in Hutlutao, Kirin, Harbin, Chengteh, Tsitsihar, Kiamusze 
and Mutankiang. In addition, dining cars were attached to all passenger 
trains. 
In 1934 the unstandardized regulations governing the opera-
tions of railways and used by nine railway administrations during the 
period of the Chinese control were abolished and replaced by a system of 
new uniform regulations. Meanwhile, the General Railway Administration 
established through traffic with the South Manchurian Railway System and 
the Korean Railway System. Coordination in handling passenger and freight 
traffic was also worked out by the General Administration with Japanese 
railways, shipping lines and Korean railways. 
2. Freight 
Because the freight transportation policies and practice 
in the railways mere not uniform, freight transportation capacity in 
Manchuria was meager. There was no provision for the protection of the 
shippers. Since there WAS no insurance system, merchants had to guard 
their merchandise en route. Under the new regulations issaed in April 
1934 the railway was responsible for the safe delivery of the freight. 
Freight charges and good classification were standardized. Furthermore, 
-268-
Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
through freight traffic services with adjoining railways were 
introduced. The outstanding features of the new regulations were 
described below. 
a. The railways instead of the owners, mill be responsible 
for the' safety of the goods on the route after the freight contract is 
signed; 
? b. A time limit for the delivery of goods is included in 
freight contracts; 
Ce The adoption of a certificate System under which the 
buyers, of goods may collect the goods and pay the shippers through the 
railway agents; 
d. The certification of merchandiseiwvoice to facilitate 
transaction; 
a. Reduction of freight chargesand fees to a minimum level. 
In addition, railway-facilities were improvedpenere trains were 
run, traffic was expedited and through traffic services were established 
among the railways. 
Formerly, there had been no uniform regulations governing the 
through traffic among the railway lines in Manchuria* The railway staff 
workers were incompetent in operating through traffic. In February 1935 
a centralized system was established for the distribution"of freight 
cars among the railways and the former car lending and borrowing system 
was abolished. As a result, transportation efficiency was improved. 
Freight transportation facilities at the terminals were improved, more 
cars were added and safety measures were taken. For traffic safety, a 
training program was given to the railway workers. 
The South Manchuria Railway Company also included warehousing 
as one of its business operations. In fact, it operated the mixed ware-
house system since December 1919 throughout the railways under its 
control* That warehouse system was then applied to all the railways in 
Manchuria after the South Manchurian Railway Corporation became the only 
administrator of railways in that area. It contributed very much to the 
marketing of agricultural products in Manchuria. 
The so-called mixed warehouse system worked in following 
manner: upon the application for storage space submitted by the owner 
of merchandise, the railway examined the goods and issued accordingly 
a warehouse invoice with which after a certain time had elapsed, the 
owner or the holder of the invoice might draw the same kind and the 
same amount of merchandise from an appointed warehouse, Before the 
goods were collected, the warehouse invoice might be used as a mortgage 
for loan* Such a system oCfered great advantages to both the railways 
and the shippers. It contributed towards the improvement of the quality 
of the farm products (including mainly mybean? soybean cakes, wheat 
and bean oil) and to the increase of their commercial value. 
Formerly, the number of warehouses attached to various stations 
of the railway lines was negligible* As the number of warehouses in-
creased, the warehousing business brought much desirable effect on the 
development of resources and a commercial trade.

B. The Policy Toward Freight Rates 
The cost of transportation was considered as one of the 
important issues in transportation. 
A description of the rate structure after the establishment of 
a centralized control system is given below: 
1. Policy on Railway Rates Under the General Railway 
Administration: 
Any change in railway rates affected the social 
economy. It affected also the financial situation which was critical 
at the early days of the General Railway Administrations. Soon after 
the Genera]. Railway Administration was founded, the old rate was still 
in use. However, a study of the railway rate structure was under way. 
After two years of investigation and in February 1936 a uniform 
passenger freight rate schedule was adopted. 
a. IMPAINatEiltIS 
The basic rates once established dm the four main 
lines were abolished and replaced by rates in proportion to distance. 
The new rates were formulated on the basis of the:oldr?rates in ChangchuD-
Tumen Line. The purpose of choosing those rates as a basis for the new 
.rates was to lighten the burden of traveling in the inland of Manchuria. 
2. Freight Transportation Rate 
When the General Railway Administration took over the 
national lines under its management, there were four seta of freight 
transportation rates, as follows:

In September, 1934, when the La,-fa-Harbin Line was put into opera-
tion, the freight rate of transportation at the Harbin-Pei-an Line was 
lowered to the same level with that of other lines (Chlang-chun-Tlu-men 
Line and Mukden-Shan-hai-kuan Line). The objective of rate reduction 
was to lighten the burden of the Chinese living in the national border 
area. Consequently, there were three freight rate schedules as compared 
with four schedules previously. 
At the end of March, 1935, before the Chinese Eastern Railway Was 
taken over by Manchukuo, it had had three freight rate schedules as 
follows: 
1. A rate schedule for local freight; 
2. A rate schedule for freight connected to the Southern 
Manchuria Railway; 
3. A rate schedule for freight using the Ussuri Railway Line. 
The second rate schedule was the highest: While the third was the 
lowest in comparison. The third schedule was a set of discrimination 
rates in favor of the freight going to or from Vladivostok. After the 
Chinese Eastern Railway was taken by Manchukuo, its freight rate was 
reduced to the same level as the national lines unier the control of 
Manchukuo. The reduction of rates applied also to the transport of 
industrial resources in North Manchuria. Although the General Railway 
Administration suffered a loss of 6,000,000 yuan, because of rate reduc-
tion, yet the beneficial effects on industry were immense. 
The new railway rate structure was determined after two years of 
study on its effect on industrial development and a railway expansion. 
The rate reduction introduced in February 1936 caused the railway to 
lose 4,5000000 yuan annually. The purpose of the revision of the rate 
structure was as follows: 
L. Replacement of the treble local rate system and progress 
reduction of rate for long-distance freight. 
Consistent with the objective of a centralized management 
administrative system, the freight rates which varied with districts . 
(comprising the Chiang-ch'un-Ttu-men Line, the Mukden Shan-hai-kuan 
Line, and other lines) were abolishedvand the minimum rate practiced 
along the Chlang-ch'un-Tlu-men Line was used as a standard rate for all 
the railway lines in Manchuria. In addition, the new rate was regressive 
as to distance as compared with the formerly straightline proportional 
rate. (The Mukden-Shan-hai-kuan Line was excluded from the new system). 
Subsequently, the favorable rate for long-distance freight produced 
excellent results far the exploitation of the hinterland of Manchuria. 
2. Establishment of a special rate for encouraging the 
development of the hinterland of Manchuria. 
Freight originated at or beyond stations located in the 
national border, Hai-lun, Chli-ch'i-ha-erh, Fu-la-erh-chi 
or freight destined to some stations near the sea ports like Ta-hup-Shan, 
Mukden, Tou-men? Shang-san-feng were given an extremely law rate in 
order that the exploitation of hinterland might be facilitated.

3. Revision of old regulations and reclassification of goods. 
Since the revision the rates in Manchukuo achieved a ' 
unified rate structure. However, the "corporation lines" under the 
control of the Southern Manchurian Railway Corporation had not taken the 
same step toward rate reduction for fear of losses.

The freight rate in the railways under the control of the South 
Manchuria Railway Company had been raised in 1919 when the first World 
War just ended. The rise was due to high prices and high wages. 
(Figures are given in Table 72.) The rate schedule was revised in sub?
sequent years on the basis of the metric system. Up to 1936, the rates 
remained unchanged.

In 1936 when Manchukuo standardized the freight rate the South 
Manchuria Railway Company also changed its rate schedule for the 
company lines. To help develop natural resources, the company did its 
best to revise its rate schedule on the basis of the schedule adopted 
by the national lines. The revision (made in February 1936) consisted 
of the following provisions: 
?. A. Ordinary Rate 
1. Classification of Goods. Manchukuo reclassified goods into 
six categories as compared with four previously:

2. Long-distance freight rate was reduced at a greater rate. 
Seven percent reduction, was applied to each 100 kilometers beginning 
from the. second 100 kilometers.

The rate for less-than carload- freight was 1.5 tithes 
of the full carload freight rate. 
it. Changes of the method of ()amputation. The basic unit of 
two kilometers used in rate ccmputation was modified. The basid unit 
for rate computation varied with distance. It was 2 kilometers for 
freight to be transported within 100 kilometers 5 kilometers for the 
distance between 101 and 500 kilometers and 10 kilometers for the 
distance between 501 and 1,000 kilometers. 
5. The revised freight rate schedule consisted of three. 
different rates: the ordinary, the special and the reduced rates. 
It was provided that with the exception of very special cases such as 
the freight arrived from or delivered to overseas, there would be no 
reduction of freight charges in the special rate schedule. 
B. Special Rates 
? The special rates practiced by the South Manchuria Railway 
Company applied to: 
1. Goods arriving at or criginating from ports; 
2. Le:1.1y necessities; 
3. Construction materials 
These three categories of special rates covered a great varietY 
of goods, especially the first category of rates. 
The so-called special rates for goods arriving at an originating 
from Dairen, Port Arthur, Yingkaw and Antung by the railway lines. They . 
were part of the policy for the development of harbors, end were 
practiced soon after the South Manchuria Railway Company was founded. 
In February 1936 when the freight rates were revised agricultural pro-
ducts delivered to the ports in Southern Manchuria and in North Korea 
were also covered by special rates. This was taken as a measure to en,-
courage the transport of agricultural products. 
One point worthy of notice was that in the revision of freight 
rates effective February 1936, a lower rate was applied to the less-than

carload freight above 5,000 kilograms in order that the transport of 
groceries would be faallitated. 
Freight Rate Policy of Manchukuo .During the Period of the 
General Railroad Administration. 
In October 1937 the Puppet Manchukuo abolished the General 
Railway Administration and replaced it with the General Railroad 
Administration, The purpose of the reorganization was to put the 
national lines and the corporation lines formerly under the management 
of the South Manchuria Railway Company under the control of the General 
Railroad Administration. In the same year the Manchukuo regime im-
plemonted its first five-year plan industrial development, the 
Loukouchiao Incident took place. Also in the same year in order to meet 
the new situations the General Railroad Administration adopted a freight 
rate which applied to all railway lines under its control and those 
under the Korean Railway Corporation for developing the national resources 
in North Manchuria, for expanding commerce and industry and for stimulat-
ing the trade relations with foreign countries. The passenger rate was 
also revised in December 1940. 
. As a consequence of the Pacific War, the Manchurian economy 
was greatly weakened. Thus, the freight rate was raised repeatedly in 
the subsequent years. 
Passenger Rates 
The war of emergency put more restiiction on passenger trans-
portation than on freight. transportation. This was because of the fact 
that the decrease of income from freight transportation forced the 
government to raise the passenger rate (passenger rates are listed in 
Table 73 below.) Measures for the unification of passenger rates 
throughout Manchuria were taken in December 1940.

After the revision of the freight rates in 1936 by the General 
Railway Administration, the corporation lines under the management of the 
South Manchuria Railway Company and the national lines under the General 
Railway Administration and the Korean Railway Company have respectively 
their own rate schedules. Since the establishment of the General Rail-
road Administration in Malchuria railway administration was unified. In 
order to meet the new political situation to exploit natural resources 
anclto introduce the five?year industrial development plan, the General 
Office greatly reduced the rates and drastically reformed the structure 
of freight charges in October 1938. The purpose of this revision was 
given below, 
1. To establish a Single Unified Freight Rate 
The company lines formerly under the control of the South 
Manchuria Railway Company, the national lines under the management of the 
Manchukuo regime and the railway lines in Korea adopted a single, unified 
freight rate. A main feature of the uniform rate was that the charges 
decreased proportionally as the mileage increased, 
24 To facilitate Industrial Development 
In order to coordinate with Manchukuo's policies of resource 
development centering on the north, of fostering the heavy industry and 
of expanding foreign trade, the railway administration adopted a freight 
rate which decreased as the distance increased. In addition a very low 
rate applied to some vital materials. As a result, the annual deficit 
arising from the low?rate policy amounted to 20,000,000 yen, About 75 
percent of the freight received a special rate. Freight rates for cereals, 
coal, minerals, lumber and livestock were extremely low, 
A flat rate of 23 yen per ton applied to the transport of 
cereals, Freight rates for the other four categories of goods mentioned 
the last paragraph decreased proportionally as the distance increased. 
This was obviously a measure for facilitating the economic resources in 
the hinterland of Manchuria. The previous rate schedule for goods pro?
duced at the border areas was abolished as the new rates came into effect. 
Readjustment of Loading and Unloading Charges in the Ports 
and Harbors; 
Special rates for loading and unloading goods in Dairen 
and An?tung were abolished except those governing the transportation of 
the evort cereals and the imports, Furthermore, goods transported to 
the three North Korean ports were charged at a minimum rate regardless 
of distance in order to utilize fully the port facilities there, 
In compliance with the policies listed above, the new 
revision provided; 
1. A new classification of freight; 
2. Specially reduced rates for goods receivedfrom or destined 
to Kuantung Province and were transported over 120 kiloMeters in 
distance;

Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
. 3. A 25 percent discount applied to the less-than-carload . 
freight weighing more than 2 tons apiece; 
4. There were four categories of goods in the new revised 
schedule as compared with four for the corporation lines and six for 
the national lines. The basic freight rate used previously by the 
corporation lines was preserved in the revised schedule since it was a 
lower rate. In Order to avoid drastic changes in freight operation, 
the formerly fifth and sixth categories of the Manchukuo 's national 
lines were covered by a special low rate. 
The volume of freight increased greatly in the subsequent 
years as the agriculture, industry and government enterprises rapidly 
developed. The composition of railway freight also showed a great 
change. More than half of the long-distance freight consisted of coal 
and minerals which paid very low freight charges. Thus the income from 
freight operations per ton per mile decreased (see the next section on 
railway transportation accomplishment) despite the increase in freight 
volume. On the other hand, the expenditures of the railways sharply 
increased because of the mar, the high wages and high prices. 
Since the freight rate played an important role in the 
determination of the general prices, Manchukuo strictly opposed to the 
raising of freight rate. Instead, it increased the passenger rate in 
order to compensate the losses from freight operations. This marked 
great change in the railroad operations in Manchuria, for the rail-
road depended now mainly on passenger traffic as a main source of 
revenue rather than on freight traffic as it did in the past. Several 
new provisions were made with regard to freight rate, including: 
1. The maiginal mileage above which a proportional de-
creasing rate would be applied was changed from previously 120 kilo-
meters to now 80 kilometers; 
2. A 15 percent discount applied to the less-than-carload 
freight weighing more than 5 metric tons apiece as compared with 25 
percent and 2 metric tans apiece previously stipulated. 
Another revision an freight rate was made in January 1942 as a 
consequence of rising wages and other costs of operation. The new 
revision included the following changes: 
1. Basic freight rate included the less-than-carload - 
freight rate and the full-carload freight rate. The less-than-carload 
freight rate consisted of the ordinary, the weighed and the discount 
rates. The full-carload freight rate consisted of the ordinary and the 
discount (discount according to types of goods or a straight-line dis-
count rate) rate.

3. The minimum freight weight WAS 50 kilograms and the 
minimum chargewas one yuan. 
Provisions concerning the full-carload freight in the new 
revision included: 
1. A revision of the basic rate (see above table) 
2. Full-carload freight must have a minimum weight of 
21 metric tons as compared with 18 tons previously (except domestic 
:animals and explosives) 
3. The minimum charge for one carload (30 tons) was 80 
The newly revised freight regulation suspenied the following 
freights fram the list of goods applicable for special discount rate: 
1. Merchandises farm tools and exhibit articles originated 
from or delivered at the former Kwantung Leased. Territory. 
2. Cereals, timber and charcoal originated from or 
delivered to An -tungs rice and timber originated from North Korean rail-
ways and merchandise originated from or delivered at Najin. 
Discount rates for the following goods were revised in the new 
regulations Minerals including magnesium, alkali minerals and limestones 
rocks and marble, railroad ties and telephone poles. 
A merchandise to which the ordinary basic freight rate for the 
less-than-carload freight applied was charged in the same rate regard-
less of its grade. Freight rate for valuable goods was twice as much as 
ordinary goods and that for explosives was 5 to lo times as great as that 
for ordinary goods. 
Miscellaneous freight charges including pick-up and delivery 
fees, unloading fees and guard fees were increased in the new regulation. 
In subsequent years as the war situation became worse and sea . 
transportation met with more difficulties, railway traffic increased

tremendously* Because the freight rate was low, railway income de-
clined further. In order to put each operating department of the rail-
way into good shape financially, the South Manchurian Railway Corpora-
tion again revised its passenger and freight rates in January 1945. 
The revision covered the following changes: 
1. The basic freight rate for ]ss-than-carload goods 
was 1 cent per kilogram per 100 kilometers regardless of grades; 
2. Service charge for 2e ss-than-carload goods was 50 
cents per 100 kilograms and 2 yen per ton for full-carload goods (one 
yuan for goods to which the categorical discount rate applied). 
The new revision further lowered the discount rate fox' long-
distance transport of less-than-carload goods. 
Other features of the new regulation included: 
1. Freight charge for less-than-carload daily necessities 
Was 50 percent oft from the ordinary freight rata and 
2. The minimum charge on goods originated from or de-
livered at Dairen was eliminated.

. Development of Passenger Transportation 
After the 41enchekuo regime was founded in 1933, all the 
national railways ih Manchuria were entrusteliwith the South Manchuria 
Company for centralized eontrol. In October of the same year the rail-
way in North Korea were also operated by the compeny. Since then 
through-traffic service was established between Najin and Ch'eng-ch en. 
Through-traffic service for all the railways in Manchuria and 
in North Korean was established in March 1934 soon after the South 
Manchuria Railway Company succeeded in standardizing the traffic regula-
tions. In June 1934 the Eastern Travel Bureau was established for the 
service of travelers. Through-traffic service opened in July 1934 
between MUkden and Peiping. The Asian Express train operated in 
September after a double track was built between Chlang-ch'un and 
Dairen. The Light Express train operated in November 1934 between 
Chlang-chlun and Pusan. Since then traveling was more convenient than 
ever. 
In March 1935 the controversial Chinese-Eastern Railway was 
taken over by Manchukuo. This in effect enabled the railways in 
Manchuria to make contacts with the railways in Europe. In September 
1935 the Asian Express reached Harbin. More railways were Wilt in the 
same year. Transportation in Manchuria grew rapidly. Nair Port was 
opened to traffic also in 1935. 
In October 1936 the national lines of Manchukuo and the corpora-
tion lines of the South Manchuria Railway Company were put under a 
centralized control system. The transportation system in Manchuria 
began to be unified. The Harbin-Lu-p'in Railway charged from a 
previously narrow-gauge to a standard-gauge railway. The wide-gauge 
Harbin-5u-mg-ho Railway was also converted into a standard railroad 
in June 1937, Subsequently, all the railuays in Manchuria were 
standardized and the passenger and freight traffic operated smoothly. 
As the, Manchukuo regime implemented its first five-year in-
dustrial development plan in 1937, it stepped up railway construction. 
Heavy industry began to grow and the passenger traffic in railroads in-
creased greatly owing to the frequent movement of labor. Since peace 
and order was restored in the border area, Japanese and Chinese flocked 
to that area, As a result railroad passenger traffic continued to be 
heavy. At the eve of the Lou-kou-chiiao Incident traffic increased 
very rapidly. 
In 1938 traffic between Manchuria, North china and Japan was 
very heavy. Laborers from North China and members of the Oapenese Young 
Pioneers continued to pour into Manchuria. As a result, railroad 
passenger traffic showed a 30 percent iecease over the pest year. In 
view of the increase in the number of papsengers, the railway authorities 
suepended part cf their discount rates and restricted the issuance of 
free tickets. This probebly did not sclve much of the difficulties in 
traffic operations awing to the heavy volume of military M'affice 
In 1939 more and Rpre laborers migrated into Menchuria from 
North China, Japan and Kerea including members of the Yeung Pioneers as 
a result of the rapid development of railroad and industry. Traffic 
between North China, Japan and Korea was extremely heavy. Short-distance

Approved For Release 1999/08/25 : CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
traffic also increased greatly in Manchuria. The number of railroad 
passengers showed an increase of 50 percent over previous year. In 
order to reduce traffic jams, the issuance of free traveling tickets to 
railway workers and their independents was further restricted. Special 
discount for group traveling was also suspended. Train schedules were 
revised and train speed was reduced so as to increase the capacity of 
the railways. Furthermore, railway workers were trained so that they 
may lead the public to the observing of public spirit in time of 
difficulties. The railway operating mileage in that year amounted to 
10,000 kilometers in October 1939. 
In 1940 the rate of passenger increase was smaller than 
previous year although there wasan absolute increase. In the same 
year the basic freight and passenger rates in the corporation lines 
were adjusted to keep in line with those in the national lines. In 
July 1940 the railway-between Chongjin and San-feng (134 kilometers) 
and the Hui-ning Coal Mining Line (11 kilometers) were returned to the 
Governor of Korea and thereby-relieving the Manchukuo 's responsibilities 
in running them. 
1941 was the last year of Manchukuo 's first five-year in-
dustrial development plan. In June Germany attacked Russia and in 
December the Pacific War broke out. Manchukuo stepped up its efforts 
to improve the capacity of the railroad. It cancelled the pullman cars 
and dining cars. Traveling was indeed greatly restricted as the govern-
ment issued in the preceding year regulations governing foreign ex-
change. The number of immigrants from North China decreased. The 
number of Japanese passengers also decreased since the passengers were 
required to take boats appointed by the government. The sinking of the ? 
Piki Steamer by torpedo in November discouraged traveling further. This 
railroad passenger traffic showed an increase of 6 percent only over the 
preceding year. However, revenue from passenger cars operation stowed 
16 percent increase owing to the increase in passenger rate. 
In 1942 passenger traffic revived despite the fact that freight 
traffic was depressed. In the second half of 1942 the old time schedules 
for passenger trains were restored. More passenger trains were run. 
But the number of operating passenger trains declined again in January 
1943 because the railways were busy in shipping war materials to Japan. 
Railway passenger traffic showed an increase of 27 percent and income 
from passenger operation increased by 38 percent over previous year. 
In 1943 the freight traffic increased tremendously as a result 
of war mobilization and the shifting of ocean transportation to land 
transportation. For three times passenger service was suspended which 
involved a mileage of 114,000 kilometers. Passenger traveling met with 
more difficulties. The number of express train tickets was limited. 
Passenger regulation was tightened. Luggage was restricted. More cars 
were added to each passenger carrying train. Number of passengers in 
that year increased by 24 percent over last year. The index of passenger 
seat utilization rate was 73 percent in the preceding year and was 82 
percent this year. As a result of the two boosts in fare in April 1943 
and in January 19442 income from passenger train operations for the 
fiscal year 1943-1944 increased 42 percent over the preceding year. 
In August 1944 the Manchukuo Government declared the Emergency 
Railway Transportation Regulation for the Decisive Year. The volume of

Approved For Release 1999/08/25: CIA-RDP78-03109A001700010008-3 
war materials transported increased greatly. Owing to the threat of air 
raid in the south, passenger traffic was further limited. Despite this, 
the number of passengers transported in that year amounted to 17,005,000 
and the income from passenger car operations was 60,133,000 yen. Both 
were the highest records in the railway history of Manchuria. 
3. An Analysis Of the Passenger Traffic by Types of Cars. 
From the standpoint of types of passenger Cars, the in-
crease in the number of third-class-car passengers was most conspicuous. 
The next greatest increase was the second-car passengers. The number 
of railway passengers in 1944 was three times of that in 1937. Each 
year more and more people used second-class passenger cars. Thus the 
second-class car passengers constituted only 17 percent of the total 
passengers in 1937, but constituted hp percent in 1944.

The above table shows that the average passenger-kilometers for 
second class cars dropped since 1939. This may be explained in the 
fact that the general economic condition in Manchuria was improved 
since 1939 and short-distance traveling increased. Since 19111 the 
average traveling mileage per passenger had greatly decreased because 
there were many difficulties in traveling and because the discount 
rates for long-distance traveling and for group traveling were 
suspended.

Although the number of passengers increased by 441 percent in 
1944) income from passenger cars increased by 958 percent (income 
from coach tickets increased by 667 percent). The tremendous in. 
crease in the income from passenger car operations was due to the 
fact that passenger tickets had been repeatedly increased. The in.-
crease in the nuMber Of passengers did not correspond to the in-
crease in income because the railways modified their discount rates 
for group traveling and season tickets,

AS all the railway lines were built for the exploitation 
of the natural resources in Manchuria) the income from freight trans-
portation was much greater than that from passenger operations. Take 
for instance in 1937 the income from passenger transportation accounted 
for only 23.4 percent of the total income while that from freight 
transportation constituted 76.6 percent. It is clear that the income 
front the passenger trains was low. However, in the wake of the rise 
of industrial and cultural enterprises) income from the passenger trains 
had. gradually increased. In 1944 the income from freight traneporta-
tion constituted only 43.1 percent while that from passenger trans-
portation constituted 56.9 ,of the total income. 
The increase in the income- from passenger car operations 
was mainly due to the repeated ihcreaae in the prices of passenger 
tickets. It was also due to the low freight rates. In fact- the 
freight rates ? for Manchurian railways were comparatively low) for

? The number of passengers transported at Dairen showed 
yearly increases before 1940. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War 
which gave rise to serious shortage of ships, it decreased beginning. 
1941. It dropped to 5,000 in 1943 and to a negligible amount in 1944. 
, A yearly increase in the number of incoming and outgoing 
passengers via Shan-hai-kuan was recorded before 1940. However, the 
number of passengers dropped 300,000 in 1940 as a result of the 
issuance of new foreign exchange regulations and of the heavy military 
traffic. In 1942 as a result of the naval blockade, Japan utilized 
mainly the railroads including the Korean Railway System, the An-tung-
Mukden Line and the Peiping-Mukden Line to maintain contacts with North 
and Central China. Thus once again in the number of passengers 
transported via Shan-hai-kuan showed .an increase. The number of 
passengers in 1943 MRS 498 percent of that in 1935. 
The number of passengers transported via An-tung was small in 
1941, but large in 1942 and 1944. This proved that Japan was making 
a great effort to utilize land transportation for war purposes. 
The number of incoming and outgoing passengers transported at 
Najin showed rapid increases before 1941. In 3,942 it reduced by 
20 percent over the previous year as a result of the freightening. 
incident in 5. November 1942 in which the Kipi Steamer was sunk by 
torpedoes. However, it picked up again in 1943 with passengers in-
creased by 33 percent over the previous year because Dairen was 
paralyzed and the sea route via:Pusan was menaced by US submarines. 
The number of passengers transported via T'u-men and Shang-san--
feng increased by the year. Traffic of East Manchuria especially 
the Ch'ang-ch'un-tlu-men Railway Area with Japan and Korea was 
becomming vary heavy.

2. Development of Freight Transportation 
The General Railway Administration made every effort to unify its 
administrative system after it was entrusted with the management of 
all the Manchurian railways by Manchukuo in 1933. It ordered its 
Dairen Railway Bureau to build new lines. In September 1933 the Chiang, 
chiun-Tiu-men Railway opened to traffic. In October 191" it vee en- - 
trusted with the management of the North Korean Railway by the Qovernor 
of Korea. The through-traffic train began to operate between Wang-. 
el.:tun and Chongjin in North Korea. Thus Manchuria was linked to 
Japanese Sea via Chongjin, a port opposite Vladievostok. 
In January 1934 the Southern Manchuria Railwaqt introduced the 
mixed storage system for farm products. (mainly soybean Oil and bean 
cake) first to Dairen and then to everywhere in Manchuria. It trans-
ported free cereals for relief famine, In March of the same year it 
standardized the freight regulations in.the national railway lines. 
The through-traffic trains began to operate between the national lines, 
the corporation lines and the North Korean Railway Linerin the middle 
of May. In 1934 the Chao-yang-ch'uan-Mai-shan-tiun and the La-fa-
Harbin railways opened to traffic. The opening of the La-fa-Harbin 
Railway strengthened Harbin as a market center at the north and 
thereby counteracted the obstacles in freight transportation resulting 
from the control of the Chinese Eastern Railway by the USSR. A 
national network of railways was formed. Also in 1934 the Pei-an-
Heirbo Railway built an extension line into the north. 
All the railways in Manchuria fell into the exclusive control of 
the South Manchuria Railway Company after the company took over the 
Chinese Eastern Railway in March 1935. In July 1935 the Tlu-men, 
Mu-tan,chiang Section of the Tiu-men-chia-mu-ssu Railway opened to 
traffic. In November of the same year the Unggi-Najin Line began to 
operate and the port of Najin opened. Consequently, the cities in 
Manchuria were prosperous and industries especially lumber and paper 
industries were growing. The trading post with Japan included then 
not only Dairen and An-tung but included also Najin? Unggi and Chong-
jin in North Korea. In 1935 two more railway lines opened for traffic: 
the Chlang-chlun-T/ao-an Line and the T'ao-an-Ttu-lu-erh Line. Ina. 
dustry in Northwest Manchuria began to develop. The mixed storage 
system applied in that year to farm exports to North Korea and to 
soybean produced in the Sungari River area. 
In February 1936 freight rate was revised. In March through-
traffic trains between Japanese railways and the national railways 
of Manchuria were installed, In May through-traffic trains operated 
between Japanese railways and the Peiping4lukden Line. Through. 
freight services between Manchurian railways and railways in Asia 
and Europe were worked out after the Conference on Through-Freight 
Services held its meetings in Moscow in September 1936, In September 
the Ssu,pting-Pei-feng Section of the $0u-pling-Mei-ho-Wou Line 
opened to traffic. 
In 1937 Manchukuo's first five-year industrial development plan 
began. The South Manchuria Railway Company stepped up its effort to 
build new lines, In July the Tlu,-men-chia-mu-ssu Line fully opened 
to traffic. In September the Mi-shan-HU-lin? the Hsin-li-t?un-I-hsien, 
and the Tiao-an-0-erh-shan railway lines were put into operation.

The Mei-ho-klou-T'ung-hua Section of the Mei-ho-ktou-Ohi-an Line also 
opened to traffic. But soon after the outbreak of the Lo-kio-chtiao 
Incident on 7 July 1937, the railroad freight transportation underwent 
many changes. 
In 1938 the Sino-Japanese War was widespread. The Manchukuo 
regime revised its first five-year industrial development plan and 
took measures to strengthen its defense industry. Freight traffic was 
extremely heavy. In October the railway authorities made an overall 
revision of its freight rate policy and standardized the freight 
schedules throughout all the railways in Manchuria. Features included 
in the newly revised regulation included a sliding discount scale for 
long-distance freight, a categorial schedule providing reduced rates 
for cereals, lumber, coal, minerals and. livestock and a special rate 
for the transport of daily necessities. In addition, throUgh-traffic 
freight was established between Manchuria, Japan and Korea. 
In 1938 the railway traffic was very heavy since Japan poured an 
immense quantity of Military supplies into North China. Shortage of 
cars was deeply felt. The poor port facilities in Dairen and in ports 
in Korea and the shortage of labor had restricted greatly the trans-
portation system. Measures taken to relieve the above-mentioned 
difficulties included: (1) operating the trains at higher speed and 
adding more trains into service, (2) centralizing the distributionof 
cars, (3) increasing the capacity of the freight cars, (4) improving 
the economy in the use of materials, (5) putting more freight cars . 
into operation, (6) improving railway yards and freight yards opera-
tions, -(7) the training of freight train workers, (8) forbidding the 
freight trains to make stopovers at night, (9) loading and unloading 
freight cars day and night, (10) shortening the time consumed in 
customs inspection and (11) increasing the efficiency of the workers. 
In the early-part of 1939 about 200,000 metric tons of goods were 
tied up in Dairen Harbor, In July 1939 the No-men-han Incident 
occurred and military transportation was very heavy. In September 
the World War II broke out. This prevented the export of soybean and 
other farm products to Europe and added more problems to the trans-
portation system. In October the Mei-ho-Wou-Chi-an Line, a railway 
for the development of the natural resources in Tung-pien-tao and for 
making connection with Korea, opened to traffic entirely. In January, 
1940 through-freight services between the Siberian Railway and the 
Manchuria railways were ettablished and the export of soybeans to 
Europe was again possible. 
In addition to the old railways like the one between Dairen and 
Harbin, new lines leading to Chia-mu-ssu? MU-tan-chiang and Najin 
were opened for freight traffic. The railroad freight consisted of 
mainly imported goods and of very little amount of exported goods. 
Since then the heavy traffic condition in the south WAS eased and the 
railways assumed its proper place in freight transportation. 
1940 Asia felt gradually the impact of the war in Europe. In 
order to prepare for the war, Japan tightened its control of industry. 
It reviewed its policy toward the semi-public companies. There was-a 
depression in agriculture and in coal mining industry. Furthermore, 
imports dropped to a very law level because of rigid controls. Rail-
way traffic was rerouted. All this explained the drop in railroad

freight tonnage and in income in 1940. Despite the increase of 
4,420,000 metric tons (or 8 percent) over the previous year, the income 
dropped 18,240,000 (or 6 percent) over the preceding year. This was 
explained by the fact that the composition of the freight was changed: 
it consisted of more lumber and minerals which paid a lower freight 
rate and consisted of less agricultural products which paid previously 
a higher rate. The drop in farm products amounted to 2,000,000 tons 
(or 28 percent) and the increase in lumber amounted to 630,000 tons 
(16 percent) and in minerals 1,920,000 tons (or 28 percent). In view 
of the changes in the composition in railway freight and the changes 
in the direction of freight traffic, a new transportation policy was 
worked out by the Southern Manchuria Railway Company, 
In June 1941 the USSR was attacked by Germany. This had produced 
certain impacts on Manchuria. Seventy percent of the railway freight 
was military goods -which paid very low freight rate. Furthermore, 
there was a sharp increase in long-distance freight. In order to 
prevent railway's freight income from shrinking, the freight rate was 
revised and put into force in January 1942. 
In 1942 Japan and the US were at war. Railway transportation was 
greatly influenced by the war. Furthermore, it was the railways which 
transported the coal, iron, farm products and strategical materials. 
Railway traffic volume increased tremendously since there was a short-
age of ships. Merchandise entering into the trade between Manchuria, 
North China and Korea was also transported practically all by rail. 
The railway freight in 1942 consisted mostly of goods which paid very 
low rate since, it included 50 percent of government supplies and rail-
way materials and 20 percent of minerals. This was undoubtedly very 
unfavorable to the railways with regard to their income. 
In March 1943 Japan convened the first session of the Continental 
Railway Transportation Advisory Conference to determine measures re-
lated to wartime transportation. It laid great emphasis on those 
measures for expediting the movement of military goods once after 
they were shipped to Manchurian ports by Japan. The railways met 
with many difficulties including the traffic jam, the problem of 
utilizing the empty cars on the returning trip and the redistribution 
of cars among the railways. The flood in North Manchuria in that 
year caused some damages to the railways. Despite all the diffi-
culties, the railways were able to handle a very great volume of 
traffic since they had experience for more than ten years in the 
centralized control of the railways. Freight volume in 1943 reached 
84,620,000 metric tons and 2,809,000,000 ton/kilometer, the highest 
record in the history of railway transportation in Manchuria. 
Raw materials and war supplies including coal, iron, minerals 
and foodstuffs which were transported via the An-tung-Su-chia-tlun 
Line and the Mukden-Shan-hai-kuan Line were handled according to the 
plans worked out by the Continental Railway Transportation Advisory 
Conference. Freight volume, particularly along the two railways 
just mentioned, increased tremendously as the war tempo was higher 
and higher. In 1943 the freight along the two railways amounted to 
41500,000 metric tons which condituted 20 percent of the total rail-
way freight throughout the entire Manchuria. 
In 1944 Japan felt the adverse impact of the war. Lumber, 
mineral and other lines of production in Manchuria dropped gradually.

Manchuria's exports to Japan could not longer utilize Dairen and the 
ports in North Korea. Instead, they had to go through An-tung and 
Korea. This worsened the transportation situation. In August the 
railway corporation announced the wartime emergency transportation 
measures to cope with the difficulties. The railway system in 
Manchuria became at that time the Major transportation network for 
Japan. The volume of freight in 1944 amounted to 77,5600000 tons, a 
decrease of 7,060,000 tons over the preceding year but a gain of 
4,000,000 tons over 1941. The income from freight operations amounted 
to 455,6100000 yen, an increase of 22,000,000 yen over the 433,310,000 
ycn in 1943. In January 1945 another revision of the freight rate was 
made. The centralized control of railways in Manchuria ended with the 
reoccupation of Manchuria by China.

The above tables show that in 1943 the freight tonnage was 2.1 
times that in 1937. Railway materials increased 2.4 times; govern-
ment-.controlled materials 5.3 times; and merchandise, 1.8 times* 
The increase in the volume of government-controlled material was re-
markable particularly in 1941 when the Pacific War broke out. In 
the commercial freight category, minerals increased 1.9 times; 
forest products 2.1 times; marine products 2 times. But the volume 
of agricultural products dropped since 1939. It was 78 percent in 
1940 and 89 percent in 1943 as compared with 1937. 
Among the principal commodities, timber increased 1.9 times; 
coal 1.5 times; and iron ore, 5.7 times; limestone, 2.5 times; but 
soybeans decreased to 48 percent of that in 1937. 
With respect to the composition of the annual freight in 19370 
'railway materials accounted for 19 percent; comModities? 71 percent; 
while government-controlled materials constituted 10 percent only. 
In 1943, railway materials accounted for 21 percent; government-
controlled materials 25 percent; and commodities 54 percent. In 
other words, 1943 freight tonnage consisted of 46 percent of freight 
which paid a low rate. It is therefore conceivable that railway 
freight income was low in that year. 
The agricultural products accounted for 16 percent in 1937 and 
accounted for 7 percent only in 1943. The decline in the volume of 
soybean transported was very noticeable. It accounted for 6.6 
percent of the total agricultural freight in 1937 but WAS 1.5 percent 
only in 1943. 
Timber, coal and rocks were the three major items included in 
the railway materials. Their relative importance as railway 
materials is shown in Table 90.

In the table given above the average mileage hauled per ton had 
increaded from 334 kilometers to 354 kilometers between 1937 and 1943) 
i.e. 6 percent. The chief staple product, soybeans, had dropped from 
745 kilometers to 616 kilometers and became 83 percent of its previous 
mileage. On the other hand, the mileage for minerals increased 25 
percent from 242 to 303 kilometers. It was particularly worthy of our 
notice that the mileage for coal had increased from 261 kilometers to 
343 kilometers, an increase of 31 percent. The mileage for forest 
products increased from 257 to 481 kilometers, or an increase of 190 
percent. All this pointed to the fact that the mileage for agri?
cultural products which paid a higher rate dropped while that for 
minerals and forest products which paid a lower rate increased. The 
changes in the composition of the railway freight and their consequence 
had stirred up much discussion on the feasibility of the Manchurian 
railways' freight policy.

2. Income from Freight Transportation l_p_y Types of Goods  
The original purpose of the railways in Manchuria was for the 
development of the rich resources there. Thus the income of railways 
consisted mostly of income from freight operations as we have mentioned 
above. After Manchurian railways were entrusted to the South Man-
churia Railway Company for control, not only the income from freight 
operations increased rapidly, but the composition of freight under-
went great changes. In 1937 the railway freight included commercial 
freight 85 percent, and railway materials and government-controlled 
materials 15 percent. The commercial freight in turn consisted of 
34 percent of agricultural products. In 1938 agricultural and forest 
products still constituted a fairly large portion of the railway 
commercial freight. However, income from agricultural products began 
to decline from then on. This WS largely due to the political 
situation and to the progress of the first five-year industrial 
development plan. 
In 1939 despite the decline of the income from agricultural 
products, the income from forest products and other sources in-
creased greatly, awing to the import of machinery under the first 
five-year industrial development plan. In 1939 a proposal for the 
expansion of the Dairen Harbor was drawn. Because of the changes in 
international situation, ?the volume of government-controlled materials 
showed a great increase. 
In 1940 there was an increase of the freight volume of govern-
ment-controlled materials and railway materials due? to the changes in 
the political situation. Agricultural products particularly soybeans 
declined most rapidly. The volume of coal and general merchandise 
on the other hand went up steadily. In short, during the war period 
railway freight in Manchuria consisted of at least 20 percent of 
government-controlled materials -which paid a low freight rate. The 
volume of agricultural products which constituted previously a larger 
portion of the railway, freight began to decline. This was a matter 
of great concern to the railway administration. 
The combined average of freight income per ton of goods was 4.9 
yuan in 1940, representing a drop of 14 percent from 1937. This was 
mainly due to the fact that the volume of agricultural products 
(which paid a higher freight charge) had declined and that the 
volume of minerals and forest products (which yielded a smaller 
income) had increased. 
The upward trends of the freight income per ton of goods 
occurred since 1941 because of the heavy volume of freight"traffic 
as a result of the political situation. The increase in freight 
income VAS also caused by the rate revision effective January 1942. 
V. VOLUME OF RAILWAY FREIGHT BY RAILWAY LINES 
The volume of railway freight handled by different railway 
lines is given in Table 100.

All the railway lines except the Fu-shun Railway Line gained in 
freight tonnage. TWO lines showed moderate increases in freight 
tonnage from 1937 to 1943: the Chlang-ch'un-Dairen Line increased 
65 percent and the Ch'ang-ch'un-Harbin Line increased 46 percent. 
Other railway lines showed tremendous increases: the An-tung-Mukden 
Line increased to 3.1 times of that in 19370 the MUkden-Shan-hai-kuan 
Line -- 4.4 times, the Chlang-chiun-Ttu-men Line -- 3 times, the 
Tlu-men-Chia-mu-ssu Line -- 4.1 times. The decrease in the freight 
traffic in all the railways was to a greater extent the result of

industrial prosperity in Manchuria. There were other factors which 
accounted for the sudden increase in freight tonnage in specific rail-
way lines. For instance, the sudden rise in freight traffic in the 
Harbin-Sui-feng-ho and the T'u-men4hia-mu-ssu lines was caused by war 
preparation and by Manchukuo's program for the development of the 
north. The increase in freight traffic in the T'u-men-Ch'ang-ch'un 
and the An-tung-Mukden lines was a direct result of the war: during 
that time the sea routes were blocked and these two railway linea 
became the major routes for trade between Manchuria, China Proper, 
Japan and Korea. Some railway lines were newly built for special 
purposes: the Sui-hua-Chia-mu-ssu Line was constructed for the coal 
and timber produced in Ho-kang and the Mei-ho-k'ou-Chli-an Line for 
the coal and minerals produced in Tang-pien-tao. These two lines 
will have a very prospective future.

VII. TRENDS IN IMPORT AND EXPORT FREIGHT 
The volume of railway freight received from or delivered to the 
harbors in Manchuria has been discussed in the chapter on sea trans-
portation. Table 105 gives the freight tonnage imported or exported 
via the principal harbors in Manchuria. The total trade volume for 
entire Manchuria and for Dairen had increased by the year prior to 
1939, but declined rapidly in 1940 and 1941. It showed signs of 
recovery in 1942. Such a trend which was caused by the war was also 
true of other commercial ports in Manchuria except that it was not as 
remarkable as that in Dairen. 
? The volume of export showed declined for all the ports after 1937 
except for Dairen and the two ports in North Korea which recorded an 
increase in exports after 1942. There had been an increase in imports 
before 1939. But the volume of import decreased rapidly after 1939. 
Since the volume of exports was larger than that of import before 19381 
a discrepancy between the volume of coast-bound freight and that of 
hinterland-bound freight was created. Such a discrepancy was 
partially eliminated after 1939. However, the volume of freight 
handled by the harbors decreased remarkably after 1943 as sea trans-
portation was paralyzed by war. War materials exported to Japan were 
mainly transported by railways. Emergency measures were then taken to 
ease the heavy traffic in railway transportation.

Freight Traffic in Frontier Railway Stations 
A description of the freight traffic of Manchuria with China, 
Korea and Japan at the railway terminals near the borders is given 
below. 
? Sea transportation met with extreme difficulties after the Pearl 
Harbor in 1941. The Antung-Mukden and the Mukden-Shan-hai-kuan lines 
became therefore the most indispensable traffic route between 
Manchuria, China Proper and Japan. These two railways handled very 
heavy traffic. Moreover, the trade volume between Manchuria, China 
Proper and Korea increased gradually. In short, the transit freight 
in An-tung and in Shan-san-feng (North Korea) was extremely large. 
In 1943 the freight originated in North China and exported to 
Korea and Japan via Manchuria amounted to 440,000 metric tons and 
that originated from Manchuria and exported to Korea and Japan 
amount0 to 1,750,000 metric tons. About 1,510,000 tons of the 
freight from both sources were transported to Japan via the four. 
North Korean Ports (Pusan, Ma-shan, Li-shui and Ma-pu). 
Table 106 shows 2944 volume of freight exported to Japan and to 
China Proper: the volume of export originated in North China and 
transported to Japan amounted to 1,560,000 metric tons and that 
originated in Manchuria and transported to Japan amounted to 3,610,000 
metric tons. All the freight mentioned here was handled by the 
railways in Manchuria.

The transit freight at the frontier railway stations of An-tung, 
Shan-hai-kuan, Man-p'u and Shang-san-feng is given in Table 107. It 
amounted to 2,400,000 metric tons in 1939 but jumped up to 11,500,000 
metric ton (by 4.8 tines) in 1943. The transit freight in 1939 con-
stituted 13.5 percent of the combined transit freight tonnage of all 
Manchurian railways (84,620,000 metric tons) or 25 percent of the 
combined merchandise tonnage (45,380,000 metric tons) of all railways 
in Manchuria. This indicated the extremely heavy traffic condition 
in the An-tung-Mukden and the Mukden-Shan-hai-kuan lines.

Table 110 indicates that the financial condition of the railways 
WWI generally good before 1939. In 1940 income decreased While ex-
penditure increased. As a result, the net profit for the year 
dropped 36,000,000 yen or 20 percent over the preceding year. How 
ever, the financial condition Showed improvements in subsequent 
years. The net profit in 1943 was 2.4 times of that in 1934. 
Table 111 dhows the receipts from, passenger service and those 
from freight service. The income from freight service increased 
2.6 percent only from 1935 to 1944. The income from freight service 
in 1940 went down by 18,400,000 yen (5.6 percent) over the preceding 
year. On the other hand, the income from passenger service in-
creased in 1944 11.7 times of that in 1935. Each year the income 
from passenger service seemed to increase in the same rate.

Income by Railway Systems 
Table 114 thews the income from railway operations of the 
three railway systems: the national railways, the SMR lines and the 
Korean Railway System. The figures are computed according to the 
following methods: 
(1) The income from passenger operations in the 
aggregate of the receipts from passenger tickets of al the railways 
within a system; 
(2) The income from 
railway system is a product of the 
railway systems and the percentage 
way system among the total freight 
systems. 
freight operations of each 
total freight income of all the 
of freight mileage of each rail-
mileage of all the railway 
(3) The amount of expenses for a railway is equal 
to the total expenses of a railway system times the percentage of 
train mileage among the total train mileage of the entire railway 
system.

As shown by Table 114 the income of the national railway lines 
increased annual1y. Taking 1937 as the base year, the income in 1943 
reached 427. On the other hand, the SMR lines had a greater ex-
penditure everv,year with its income in 1940 being lower than that of 
the preceding year. If we take 1937 as the base year, the income and 
expenditure of the SMR lines were respectively 215 and 314. This 
indicates that the financial position of the SMR lines was much in-
ferior than that of the national lines. Such a phenomenon may be ex.-
plained by the fact that the national lines were mostly railways for 
economic development and they were relatively young, while the SMR 
lines reached their old age and could hardly compete with their 
younger rivals. 
Business Income and Expenditum.hz_aRilny Lines 
A systematic analysis of the profit and loss of each railway 
line in Manchuria began in 1940. The profits and losses of each rail-
way line are shown in Table 115. The table gives a clear picture of 
the financial position of each railway in 1940. Under the centralized 
control system, the railway lines which operated at a loss were in 
fact subsidized by those which operated at a profit. The deficits of 
one railway were compensated for by the surpluses earned in another 
railway and thereby the entire railway-network was kept in operation. 
This is the advantage of a centralized management system which should 
be taken into account in formulating railway administrative policy 
for the future.

Section 8. Automobile Transportation 
Introduction 
Automobile transportation was regarded a subsidiary industry 
to the railways and thus was entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway 
Company for its operations. As a result, the automobile transporta-
tion industry-not only avoided competition with the railways, but 
supplemented the function of the railways by extending its service to 
the border regions in Manchuria and thereby contributing to the 
development of the backward areas and to the maintenance of peace and 
order in Manchuria. Several special features were pertinent to the 
automobile transportation industry in Manchuria: (1) the mileage of 
the highway system was long; (2) as a supplementary industry to the 
railways, the automobile transportation industry must have a greater 
capacity; and (3) the industry was confronted with many difficulties 
in technique and in finance due to the peculiar geographical 
condition of Manchuria and social custom. 
Following the precedent of other countries, Manchukuo 
nationalized those highways which might be competitive to the railways, 
are substitutes for the railways or are valuable to industrial 
development. These highways were entrusted to the South Manchuria 
Railway Company-for operation. In the western world the highway 
transportation industry grew mostly after the completion of railways. 
The competition between the highways and the railroads was damaging 
not only to both transportation systems, but also to society. In 
view of this, the Manchukuo regime put both industries under a 
centralized administration. 
The automobile transportation industry in Manchuria en-
countered many technical difficulties because of poor highway 
conditions. The highways were muddy in the rainy season and too 
dusty in the spring and fall. Automobiles wore out easily. 
Mechanical troubles developed easily in the cold weather. Further-
more, financial difficulties confronted the automobile transportation 
in Manchuria: (1) freight volume was small since the highway area 
was sparsely populated and was economically backward; (2) social order 
VAS poor and much money was needed to maintain traveling safety; 
p) salaries and wages, fuels and other operating expenses were high; 
4) automobile parts were expensive and not always available.

Section 9. Data on River Transportation 
After Manchuria was taken over by the Manchukuo regime, all the 
slipping lines Along the Sungari River were nationalized and put under 
the management of the South Manchuria Railway Company. All the 
privately or publicly-owned shipping lines were supervised by 
Harbin Navigation Bureau. The bureau operated shipping lines on the 
Amur and Sungari Rivers for developing river transportation in the 
border region of Manchuria. Shipping lines newly opened for traffic 
amounted to 3,800 kilometers. Thus vessels can sail from Amur River 
in East Manchuria to Ussuri River and to Hu-lan, from there onward to 
Mu-ling Ho, Ni-shan and to Hsing-klai Lake. They can sail also from 
the Hei Ho in West Manchuria, pass through the Amur River and reach 
Mo-ho and Chi-la-lin. 
Shipping on the Amur, Sungari and Ussuri rivers is impossible 
for six months a year because of freezing. Thus the soybeans produced 
in Fu-chin, Chia-pu-ssu and I-lan and Coal produced in Ho-kang and 
other resources must be transported to the market in six months after 
the river thaws. For this reason, river traffic on the Sungari River 
is very-heavy in the summer. The business operations of the Harbin 
Shipping Bureau are therefore very heavy at that time. During the 
rest of the year, the bureau devoted much of its time in averhapling 
its Ships. In addition, it ran long-distance bus services between 
Harbin, FU-chin and Tung-chiang. The length of the bus line amounted 
to 600 kilometers. This was intended as a substitute for shipping 
services. Despite frequent highway robberies, the bus services had 
not been interrupted. 
In July.1937 the Tfu-men.Chia-mu-ssu Railway Line opened to 
traffic. It was constructed for the development of the economy of 
the frontier regions in Manchuria. It had been predicted before the 
opening of the railway that the railway would adversely affect the 
shipping industry in that area. But on the contrary the river 
traffic increased. This owed mainly to the coordination between 
river transportation and land transportation brought about by 
centralized authority over both transportation systems* 
Shipping Along the Sungari River was prosperous. However, the 
shoal located near I-lan was a great menace to shipping. In the 
period when water level was low, a vessel whose draught was above 2 
meters could not pass the shoal. In ordinary times vessels of larger 
capacity-had Also difficulties in sailing across that area. The 
condition there has been improved since the Ministry of Transporta-
tion of the Manchurkuo regime undertook a series of conservation 
projects there.: 
. In compliance with the policy of Manchukuo, the Southern 
Manchurian Railway Administration organized the Harbin Shipping 
Association for the control of the public shipping agencies and 
thereby-for the prevention of their competition with privately-. 
owned shipping concerns. All the shipping companies under the 
Jurisdiction of the railway administration joined the association* 
Wharves along the Sungari were however under the jurisdiction of the 
Harbin: Navigation Bureau.

? Data on Passenger and Freight Services  
Harbin was the center of the shipping services in the Sungari 
River. As of March 1937 there were in operation 317 ships of total 
120,000 metric tons. During the 200-day period between April and 
November 1937, these ships served 650,000 passengers and carried 
850,000 metric tons of freight.

Section 10. Data on Truck Transportation 
Introduction 
As described above, Manchukuo put the railroads and the 
Shipping lines under a centralized administration for the development 
of an efficient transportation network in Manchuria. To supplement 
railroad and river transportation the Manchukuo regime also regulated 
truck transportation. 
In 1937 the Ministry of Transportation issued the Regulations 
Governing Transportation Companies. In 1943 it appointed the 
International Transportation Company (a subsidiary of the South 
Manchuria Railway Company) to be responsible for the reorganization 
of the truck transportation industry. 
. ht2E/22.tio Transportation Company 
The International Transportation Company was founded in 1923 
with a capital of 3,000,000 yen (later increased to 100,000,000 yen), 
contributed solely-by-the South Manchuria Railway Company. It 
provided previously services to the railroads owned by the railway 
corporation. After the company received the custody?of all the rail-
roads in Manchuria, the company offered services to them. It main-
tained headquarters in Chang-chlun, service centers in principal 
cities, and representatives in the major railway stations for better 
coordination with the railroads. The business scope of the Inter-
national Transportation Company is as follows: 
1. Surface transportation 
(A) Terminal Services: It was appointed as the sole 
transportation agency serving the railroad terminals. As an ordinary 
transportation company it offered pick-up and delivery services to 
passengers and Shippers. 
(B) Freight Transportation: It monopolized the freight 
service within each of the principal cities in Manchuria. In 
addition, it controlled 62 percent of the transportation services in 
95 localities. It had its subsidiaries in Dairen, Chlang-chlun and 
Mukden. 
(C) Transport of Agricultural Products (to terminals): 
It was appointed the sole operator for transporting agricultural 
products to railroad terminals in 1943. Thus it maintained agencies 
in. 301 (or 75 percent) of the 383 trade centers for agricultural 
products. 
2. Shipping 
It operated short-distance shipping services on the in-
land waters in Manchuria. 
3. tabor Services 
. The International Transportation Company offered load-
ing, unloading, packing and other services at the railroad terminals 
and at the wharves. It had about 80,000 porters and service personnel.

Previously the company rented its transportation 
facilities from others* Later on it purchased its own facilities and 
purchased those it rented from others*

CONCLUSION 
We have just completed our review of the history, ,the development 
and the operations of the transportation system in Manchuria. Such a 
review will serve as a valuable reference for formulating our future 
policy dealing with railroad, harbor and industrial development in that 
area. Although this book is about to end$ there is a lot more to be 
said about the subject. 
At the end of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan took over the South 
Manchurian Railway and the privileges attached to the railway accord-
ing to the Portsmouth Treaty. It utilized the Kuantung Army as a main 
force for the invasion of China and built the Kuantung Leased Territory 
into a strategical base. The South Manchuria Railway System was used 
as a pump for taking our blood. Various intrigues were used by 
to execute its aggressive plan. After the Mukden Incident, Japan put 
al the railroads in Manchuria Under the centralized control of the 
South Manchuria Railway Company Which was chartered by the Manchukuo 
regime. Al]. manpower and natural resources were mobilized to develop 
the transportation system under the supervision of the railway 
corporation. By the time Manchuria was returned to China a fairly 
good system of railroads, highways, harbors, and waterways was built. 
Japan built it primarily-for the benefit of its future generations. 
It had little intention to serve the welfare of the Chinese people. 
- After 15 August Japan gave up all its transportation facilities 
in Manchuria which it had built in the past forty years. Japan may 
regret what it had to give up. As to the Chinese, they allowed no 
sign of emotion; they deserved the repossession of What originally 
belonged to them. 
? Despite Japan's defeat inwar? its comprehensive planning, the 
speed with which it pursued its plans, its efficiency in managements, 
and its realistic approach to the solving of difficulties in 
transportation development are valuable lessons to us. We may 
forgive Japan for its motive, but we ought to recognize their 
contribution to the transportation system in Manchuria. If the 
transportation facilities left behind by Japanese were not 
destroyed, we could make very good use of them. The benefit we 
derive from using the facilities constitutes at least a part of the 
compensation for the tremendous sacrifice in life and property given 
by our people in Manchuria in the 8-year war of resistance. 
At present (October 1947) the total mileage of the railroads in 
areas which have been taken over by the Chinese Government are less 
than 1,000 kilometers, a mileage smaller than that around V-J Day 
and still smaller than that existing before the Mukden Incident* 
As to the harbors, all except Hu-lu-tao and Ying-ktou, were unable 
to be used. Highway transportation was interrupted. The scarcity of 
vehicles was serious. Consequently all traffic was crippled and 
economic activities came to a standstill. Military operations were 
adversely affected. Although the government made every effort to 
restore transportation, the situation remained critical. For no 
constructive work is faster than destruction. One feels deeply sorry 
for such a situation,

Nevertheless' recovery will come eventually. The transportation 
system must be restored, for it is the artery of a nation. Moreover, 
the restoration of the transportation is vital to the reoccupation 
and reconstruction of Manchuria. Our task is extremely urgent. 
While our transportation system does not need to be constructed 
after the Japanese or Manchukuo pattern, we need not start an entirely 
new plan. We should make the choice according to merits. .We should 
adopt what is good in the previous plans and discard what is in-
adequate in them. We should utilize fully the existing equipment and 
facilities and expand them in the light of future plans. Our final 
goal is to develop the transportation system so that it may produce ? 
the greatest benefit for national defense, economic and cultural 
development. This is the ultimate objective in the opinion of the 
people not only of Manchuria but also of entire China. 
The territory in Manchuria has not yet been taken over and the 
transportation system is still subject to frequent destruction* 
There is a shortage of transportation equipment and facilities. Thus 
at present every effort should be made to prevent further destruction 
of the transportation system. Next we should concentrate our limited . 
resources on the restoration of those railroads and highways which are. 
of great military and economic value. Over-all restoration and 
further expansion will be attempted with the use of Japanese repara-. 
tions or with aids from our allies. 
Al]. in all, the transportation system is vital to the life of 
a nation. It must not be interrupted for a single day. This woad 
depend upon the teamwork between the military and the transportation 
authorities and between the people and the government. Al]. efforts; 
should be utilized to protect the railroads from further destruction 
and to build new ones that are urgently needed. We must conquer all 
the difficulties in order to pave the way for our long-run trans-
portation construction program. Let us not give ourselves up to 
pessimism and defeatism. Let us march forward and devote our full 
efforts to the development of a better transportation system in 
Manchuria.
