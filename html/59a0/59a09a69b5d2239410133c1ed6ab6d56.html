car stops, you hear the clank of bolts. From this clanging you ascertain 
that there are two gates which are not made of solid iron; although several 
different courtyards lead from the Lubyanka to the inner courtyards of the 
stee, 
Ministry of Security, there are certain gates through which prisoners are 
A 
always brought. They do not consist of solid metal plates but of separate 
steel bars. 111111111ilhe vehicle proceeds. Youodrive into the inner court yard. 
You hear someone approach your driver; a conversation takes place in a low 
tone, which ypu usually do not hear; you know only that a transfer is 
taking place. You, upon receipt, are handed over to the proper prison 
official, who at the same time collects your accompanying papers and goes 
with them to the office under which you are listed and which summoned you 
to the Ministry of Security in Moscow. A certain official, dressed in the 
C z alio/ 
usual uniform of a prison overseer, approaches you and in a low voice asks 
r 
your first and family names, and leads you down the stairs into a basement 
room. This is the so-called reception-detention room. It is very brilliantly 
lit; there, a certain official, clad in a white coat, asks you to undress. 
You undress, take off all your clothes. The stock question is asked whether 
you have any stabbing or cutting objects - this means do you have any knives 
or razors; ordinarily, a prisoner, of course, does not have these, but 
any prisoner, before arriving here, goes through 10 extremely detailed and 
thorough searches. Then they take away all your clothes. You are stripped 
to the skin; sometimes this can be very unpleasant because the reception-
detention room is cold. Your clothes are thoroughly examined especially 
the thick places such as cotton linings, etc.; seams are ripped up with a 
knife. in order that it should be impossible to hide anything in this way 
and that it should be hard and difficult to carry any kind of notes or 
anything on your person. Then, all your things are gathered up and placed 
in a special bag to which a tag is attached, and sent to be disinfected.

You then receive the standard uniform consisting of a neatly-laundered ..gafirr. 
,41141,t; trousers, high shoes, cap, and sometimes an overcoat or something else. 
Then you are sent to the so-called "box". What is the box? The box is a 
small room. "Box" is English for "korobka". It is actually a box made of 
wood. It is of very small dimensions, a small cabinet; sometimes less than 
trlik arr 
a square meter; sometimes an area of a square meter, 401 normal room 
? /9,W, wiYA 
height; the width is sometimes a meter and less) ? tisampassis-affe length *two 
or three meters. The boxes are quite varied. You are seated in this box, 
which sometimes has a bench for sitting, sometimes not; at this time the 
prison doctor appears, a woman from Central Asia, who examines you fairly 
thoroughly and asks what ailments or complaints you have. Then the person 
who commanded your convoy and brought you to the Lubyanka from some other 
city or oblast usually enters the box. He usually asks whether you have 
any complaints about the convoy. This is a routine, meaningless question, 
and whether you say you have or not, your fate and circumstances are not 
altered. 
That's how it was with me. Alter all these formalities, I was taken to 
the baths. This is obligatory. You are washed, and, if you have hair, it 
is cropped close; after this; you are now a fully privileged prisoner, if it 
is possible to use such an expression, and have arrived, so to speak, in 
prison. You really have no rights-except one, it is tru,to obey. 
After my bath, I was put back in the box. This time the overseer 
appeared. People speak there in low tones. If you inadvertently speak 
loudly, then you are told that one must speak softly here, the more softly 
the better. They are afraid that another prisoner might hear you and discover 
from your voice that prisoner so-and-so had arrived here. You are asked in 
a low voice your full name and year of birth. When you have answered all 
this, you are told what is desired of you. I was told in this case at the 
interrogation. This was very rapid and unexpected. 
In the interrogation, as in every prison, you are handled in a standard 
procedure, which is observed in all prisons of the Soviet Union. Namely 
.you are obliged to keep your hands behind your back; to let one's hands

hang loosely is not 41111-eimmissi. The guard on duty who accompanies you holds 
you by the right arm. In the other hand he usually holds the key to the 
box or the cell where you are located. According to the rules of all inter-
Cs/astverny_ye) 
rogation prisons of the Soviet Union, no prisoner is permitted to meet an-
other prisoner. Thus it was that after having spent a total of two and a 
half years in prisons, I never saw a single prisoner. Prisoners with whom 
I had served also said that the too)had never managed to see anyone. 
This is the way you are handled: You are led to a corner and told: 
Stand with your face to the wall. You stand there. Then the guard on 
duty glances around the corner to prevent the possibility of another prisoner 
being brought into your presence. If anyone is being brought there, he gives 
a peculiar signal - i.e. - he strikes his belt-:buckle with the key or makes 
very unpleasant sounds like the croaking of a frog. After this, the one 
coming into your presence is placed in a box. The boxes are distributed 
at specified distances along all corridors and all rooms of both the 
Ministry of State Security and the interior prison. Then you are led past. 
sel 
You are brought to the i = where you had been called. Later I found 
out that the greatest hatred among the prisoners is reserved for the so-called 
prison overseers. They usually wear gray-khaki uniforms, very unpresentable 
V *hoseAS. 
generally, rough military boots and blue sholder Amapa. This signifies 
A 
that they are staff employees of the Ministry of State Security, formerly 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In prison jargon', the prisoners call the 
guards "vertukhai". This is derived from the slang expressionjunpA, 
vertukhatisya", that is, "do not turn around," stand quietly, which they 
often use. The..common criminals call the guards by the still more con-
temptuous nickname of "musor" (rubbish). One might say, for example, that 
when [I did such and such] "the musor fg.g.ged me and I got 5 days in the 
lock-up." This is a common expression. Well, this particular "vertukhai" 
leads you along the corridors. First of all, you reach the so-called 
boundary. This is the boundary between the Ministry of State Security 
and the prison. The internal prison at the Lubyanka, the so-called Lubyanka 2,

where I am located, is, like all prisons, under the administrative authority 
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and not the Ministry of State Security. 
Well, you reach the boundary. The boundary is a large room between two 
stairways; here a clock hangs and here, on a table, lies the so-called 
"iron book". This is an ordinary book, more accurately, a magazine, 
rather large and jacketed in metal. In the Metal are two openings - on 
the left is the larger opening; on the right, the smaller one. Taking 
care of the book while I was there was a woman, who was well known and had 
been doing this work for a very long time, about 50 years old, with an 
unpleasant, tired face. When you are brought there, you are told, "Stand 
with your face to the wall." You stand. She asks: name and surname - 
i.e., first name, patronymic, and surname, and year of birth. She records 
this in the large opening. Then she looks at the clock. This means the 
time that you left the inner prison, i.e., left the authority of the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs and have now come under the authority and territory of 
the Ministry of State Security. After this, in the small opening, you 
place your signature. 
Now you have passed into the Ministry of State Security and the "vertukhai" 
leads you on further. You are placed on an elevator. There are 2 elevators, 
one of which moves in the prison from the top floor down; the other is in 
the Ministry. The elevator in the Ministry is very elaborate, paneled 
with red wood. You are stood against the wall in the elevator: He 
presses the appropkate button and tthe elevator] rises straight to the proper 
floor. He goes out. I was paying my first visit to room 694 on the 6th floOr. 
Now I would like to say a few words concerning what the Ministry of 
State Security represents. The Ministry of State Security, if it may be 
SD expressel4is a government within a government according to its organization. 
The building is a verttable castle. Thus do the Germans call it - Hochburg 
[fortress]. This is really a peculiar building. In the first place, it is

not connected in any way with other buildings. It hag its own electrical 
power supply, its own water supply, its own telephone station, radio station 
and incinerator. This building is the building of the former "Rossiya" 
Insurance Company, which, if I am not mistaken, was four-storied. Sub-
sequently, two stories were added, then, I believe, one more. Later the 
lateral wings were added. The construction of the additions went on during 
the entire period of the Soviet regime and ultimately, after the war, [was 
continued] by German war prisoners. A huge building was built, with its 
facade, in so far as it is possible to speak of a facade, facing so-called 
Marshlevskaya Street (?). This structure is 10 [a] stories high, built 
in modern style. All Muskovites know very well that in the so-called 
Lubyanka,the lights never go out day or night. It is the watchful eye of 
the revolution. It houses the brain of the country which protects the 
power of the rulers from the wrath of the people. It is said that every 
24-hour period from four to six thousand people work in the Ministry of 
State Security. In spite of the vast dimensions of the building, the endless 
number of rooms, halls, etc., there is not enough room. There are four or 
five workers in almost every room. The private offices have only the 
highest workers, and only those who by the nature of the work are totally 
indispensable. Let us say that someone has to hold long conversationsor 
negotiations with someone, during which no one under any circumstances 
must be present. 
And BD I was brought into the office of the official who had summoned 
me; you don't Usually know at the beginning who it was who had summoned 
you. The delivery is carried out in the following manner: The guard 
who has escorted you - the vertukhay - knocks on the door. He is given 
permission to enter. He leads you in, enters with you. In no event does 
he leave you in the corridor. Then the one who had summoned you writes 
out a small note containing your full name and year of birth, signs it,

and hands it over to your escorting official. This means that the official 
has delivered you and is no longer responsible for you. This is done so 
that if anything should happen to you either during an escape attempt or 
anything of the sort, it will be clear later who had the responsibility for 
you at that particular time. 
And so, the interrogation begins, as follows: 
It is necessary to repeat that, as a rule, prisoners are always 
summoned for interrogation at night. At night the ability of the individual 
to resist is reduced, the person is more nervous, and a wori might slip out 
of him that may eventually ruin him or have some extremely valuable 
significance for the organs. Interrogations take place at night. It is 
necessary to say that if the interests of the interrogation or interests of 
the conversation with you require it, the interrogators will not shrink 
from any means. Ordinarily, no one tries to intimidattyou at first. When 
I entered the office, I had a peculiar experience. I expected anything but 
what actually happened. I entered, and fell into an embrace. A certain 
medium-sized man, dressed in a preift rather dissheveled civilian suit, of 
obviously Oriental featuresr-as later turned out, an Azerbaydzhanir-hact 
noe 
simply grabbed me in an embrace, seatedAin 4 sofa, and said, 
don't be alarmed, don't resent us, we have only done 
our duty, but you too have fulfilled your duty, and all this is fine. He 
literally wept and there were tears in his eyes. With my inherent actor's 
mimicry, I too shed a tear and at first did not grasp a thing, but then 
became very frightened because I was now experienced enough to know that the 
better you are treated, the worse your situation is. I was seated on the 
sofa and a conversation was begun on how I had arrived, what complaints I 
had, whether I was sick, why I was so thin,. why life had treated me so poorly, 
how was my mother feeling. He just about asked how the canary in the 
apartment that I used to have was doing. Just then a so-called waitress 
appeared, a young girl, rather pretty, in a white coat, white neckerchief,

carrying a magnificent, so-called ministerial, dinner of pork chops. There 
was also brynza [cheese], I'll have you know, several slices of orange, 
wIS 
coffee and sugar, and sour milk, - everything that I, vhoetarved in my 
tracks, and hardly able to stand on my feet from hunger, ate literally with 
ectasy. Afterwards I started on the second such meal. The interrogator 
1 
was earnesty afraid that I would gorge myself and get sick. 
The conversation continued for several hours. This was a very pleasant. 
conversation, and gave the impression that this was not the Lubyanka or a 
secret police interrogation, but simply a Sunday   After this, he 
dialed the proper telephone number, and in a few minutes the guard appeared 
and said to me, go, rest, sleep, you must spend a few days in the box until 
we have selected your room, everything will be fine, etc, etc, etc. He 
gave me a stack of paper and a pencil in order that I might write any 
statements if I decided to say anything to him. He said to me, "Do not 
worry your life has now taken a different course. 
You will live, in any case, much better than you lived before." I must 
say that he really kept his promise. My life took a different course - this 
was the first half [of the promise], but the second half?that I would live 
much better-was alas, not fulfilled. 
Then I went back the samftway, observing the same formalities. Again 
I reached the iron book, again the time of my return from the Ministry of 
Stite Security to the interior Lubyanka prison was subOlied. I signed, 
passed on, and looked at the woman standing at the boundary as at an old 
acquaintance. After having, so to speak, landed in the box, I saw that v9 
supper had already been brought. The food was very bad. There was an

I stayed in the box approximately two days. I was allowed to rest, and 
afterwards I was suddenly told: get your things together. I knew that this 
meant I was being transferred to another place. And, indeed, I was transferred 
e.4-14 
to a asem,which henceforth was to be my home. This was a room on the 
fifth floor of the interior prison of the Lubyanka, in the so-called 
"nobleman's department". The prison has six floors. The first four floors, 
are considered t#e floors for commoners [sic], the top upper two floors, the 
fifth and sixth, the nobleman's floors, because here usually are kept the 
prisoners who are considered the most important. On the sixth floor are the 
soft rooms. These are so-called rooms with soft [i.e., upholstered] 
furniture and are furnished in comparative luxury. But only the most 
important political prisoners land here. Here were quartered a few captured 
German generals and various persons. Also here, I believe, was the former 
commander of the Russian Liberation Army, General Vlasov. Also here were 
von Paulus and people generally on the highest scale. A common criminal, 
even the most notorious, is, of course, neer under any circumstances found 
there. 
There are 118 cells in Lubyanka. When you enter 
the 5th floor, which is a throughway and is divided from the 6th floor by 
only a steel net, to discourage prisoners from committing suicide and throwing 
themselves into the stairway from the 6th floor and shattering themselves on 
the floor of the fifth floor, you see to your left, upon entering, a door 
and) going down a few steps towards the 5th floor, cell No 118, to the left 
above in a corner. This is the last cell. The cells in the Lubyanka are 
of different sizes. They range from cells that barely hold 2 people to cells 
in which can be placed 5, 6, or 7 people if the occasion warrants, but not 
more. These are the former hotel rooms of the "Rossiya" Insurance Company.

prisoner in Germany. Fairly soon, in approximately a few hours, I saw 
perfectly that I was dealing with a so-called "nasedka" (trusty. He 
asked me a few questions which certainly could not have been casual ones, 
although he was an individual with a sufficient amount of skill and conducted 
himself very precisely. Similar information that he was a "nasedka" was 
later confirmed. He was known pretty well in the prison. What is a 
"nasedka"? A "nasedke is, as a rule, in prison jargon, a prisoner who has 
been in prison for a long timed in some manner enjoys the confidence of the 
authorities, and for the purpose of improving his own material welfare or 
situation. consents to work for the interrogation organs and the prison 
administration. He is planted next to a new inexperienced prisoner, with 
whom he becomes friendly and talks. Usually the secret police arrange it 
twr 
soAhe receives packages, i.e., the most remarkable things, ostensibly from 
relatives, are brought into his cell, such as oranges, fruit, chocolate, and 
various other things. He tells you that relatives sent him those. Usually 
this is simply given to him by the interrogator. He shares this with you. 
Naturally, you are starved, you are very grateful to him for this, you begin 
to confide, to talk, and sometimes the secret police succeed in finding out 
what they could not wring out of you in any interrogation. 
And now, you are in the cell. First of all, there is a window in each 
cell. In winter, this window is closed. Only a small vent is open. In 
summer, the windows are opened. In spite of this, summer in the cell is 
terribly oppressive. The prison, shaped like the letter "e, is in one of 
the courtyards of the Ministry. Around you are high stone buildings heated 
by the sun, and that is whys terrible heat and stuffiness prevail. Persons 
with heattailments often feel ill and sometimes, on particularly hot days, they 
even suffer heart attacks. Naturally, every prisoner would like to know who 
his fellow-sufferers and next-door neighbors are. Everyone wishes somehow to 
communicate. The thought of bribing an overseer or guard or any one else is 
absolutely hopeless. No one has ever claimed that he managed to get, say, a 
guard to pass a note into the next cell. This ii :too dangerous and the

unpleasant consequences to which it exposes the guard are tOo great. 
Instead, prisoners try to communicate by tapping, although this too is 
noted by the prison administration. Tapping is extremely difficult and almost 
impossible. In the first place, they watch for this and in the event that 
you are caught in this deed, the lock-up threatens you - often a cold lock-up. 
For an emaciated, sick, and hungry prisoner, which every prisoner, as a rule 
is, this is a very severe punishment and can sometimes lead to diseases and 
severe complications. Besides this, the walls are arranged in such a way 
that sawdustYspread in the hollow spaces to that you hear absolutely nothing. 
I, who have generally good hearing, by applying my ear when the guard did not 
notice, heard vague speech in the neighboring cell and then, only in one. 
And then I would hear German speech. To make out the words was totally 
impossible. Tapping also was very difficult and very long. You were 
continually watched. A prisoner, according to prison regulations, had a 
number of privileges and duties. He also has privileges and something which 
is forbidden to him. For example, and in the first place: the day begins at 
5:30 AN. A scurrying about is hear: they get you up. You take a so-called 
kadka [bucket] which you use to satisfy your physical needs. In the cells. 
proper, of course, there are no bathrooms nor facilities to take the place of 
a bathroom. You take this bucket and go with it into the lavatory. There 
you wash it, disinfect it, then wash yourself) and in a short while come back. 
The guard goes to the place where you have relieved yourself and washed 
up and looks to see whether you have written anything on the walls. If it 
is noticed that you have, let us say, written your name with a wet finger, 
it is a very serious matter. You do not have the right to do this, and 
it can lead to very serious consequences and penalties. Then you go into the 
cell. After this you are served breakfast. Breakfast consists of a small 
quantity of kasha and coffee. Besides this, you get your ration of bread. 
The prison bread ration is 650 grams of black bread of very moist, foul 
dough, containing, according to exact chemical analysis, no less than 40 
percent water.

You may; first, ask for a sheet of paper in order to write a statement. In 
my time you could write a statement to anyone, from the President of the United 
States and Josef Vissarionovich Stalin down to the "koridornyy," or a 
doctor or anyone you wanted. The question, is however, - what would be the 
result of the written statement? You may write a complaint, you may write a

traveling up and down in the etevator and on the stairs, or going the wrong 
way, you walk no longer than 10-12 minutes. This is all that you are given. 
If I am not mistaken, there are five exercise yards in the Lubyanka. I 
personally know three of them. Two of these are located on the roof of 
the Ministry - not the prison, but the Ministry - a large yard and a small 
yard. They are separated from one another by an impenetrable fence and, 
in addition, are surrounded by a high fence with barbed wire, so that you can 
not see anything that goes on in the street. You see only the topmost 
part of the ministry and the fey floors attached to these exercise yards 
themselves, where some officials work. According to rumors, one of the numerous 
radio stations of the Lubyanka is located here. In the exercise yard you do 
not have the right to stand or talk with prisoners; it is feared that your 
voice will be heard in the neighboring exercise yard. You have to place 
your hands behind your back and walk continuously in a circle. Running 
is not permitted. At a slow or fast pace, as you wish. The guard who has

escorted you remains in the exercise yard with you and watches what you 
are doing. That is the first one [i.e., guard]. In addition, a second 
guard, who stands on a tower, simultaneously watches what is going on in 
both courtyards. Always on call in the prison is such a thing as a special 
operational team. Thus, in.theeevent that you begin to brawl, fight with any-
one, or organize something of the sort, 5 or 6 burly pempous appear, who very 
quickly straighten you out. In extreme cases they will even slip a 
straight-jacket on you. 
Then you have used up the fifteen minutes allotted you; the door is 
opened and the guard says politely: "Enter : And you go downstairs, 
the same way, sit in the elevator, and go to your floor. The elevator, the 
usual elevator, is of ancient construction and divided into 2 sections. The 
rear section which has 2 metal walls, is where you are placed and locked 
in, and it has a small glass window through which the guard observes what 
you are doing. You are packed in very tightly. Two people can be accommodated 
with difficulty. Three can not be accommodated at all and they are taken 
on foot. In the forward section stands the guard, who observes you and 
operates the elevator. Then you have arrived below and you are usually also 
searched. You are searched, it is true, superficially, for the sake of form) 
and after this you are again taken to your cell. The time for dinner arrives. 
Dinner is very scanty and poor. After living in prison without sustenance 
for a year or 2, you contract dystrophy under normal conditions; after 4 or 
5 years [even] the most ieasnned and unexacting organism is threatened with 
serious health disorders and, eventually, possibly even death. 
At about 7 or 8 o'clock you are brought supper. Besides this in your 
cell you have games. For example, you can plan dominoes. You can play 
chess. Of course, games of chance and cards are forbidden. Books are brought 
to you in your cell. There is a fairly wide selection of rather good

books which had been taken from arrested persons or from confiscated libraries. 
They are brought to the Lubyanka, so that, strange as it seems, in the inner 
prison at the Lubyanka you may read quasi-countezr-revolutionary or in any 
event, undesirable - for the Soviet regime - literature, as for example, 
Dostoyeysky's famous novel "The Demons". 
At 10:30 comes retreat. The signal for retreat is given by blinking. 
In the cell the electric lights blink three times briefly. This means that 
you have the right to go to sleep. Your day is ended. The day is ended, 
but the night is begun. The vast majority of the prisoners has hardly had 
time to lie in bed when the cursed tinkling of the lock is heard, the guard 
comes in, asks your name in a low voice, and says, "Get ready for questioning." 
And so, cursing everything and everyone, you dress and are usually gone for 
the whole night. One more night is wasted for you. During the day sleeping 
is forbidden. This is closely watched. You hot only have no right to 
sleep, but even to lean against the wall. You must sit upright with the 
hands down. You can stroll about the cell, you may walk, you may speak 
softly with your cellmate, but you must sit constantly facing the peephole 
so that your face will be visible and, in an extreme case, to turn the 
face sideways. As soon as you close your eyes, you hear the warning shout: 
"No sleeping" or "No drowsing". If you do this 2 or 3 times, the guard 
comes in to your cell, reprimands you, sometimes in a rather rough manner. 
If you fall asleep, you can be punished again and sent to the lock-up, but 
usually this shout, "No sleeping, no drowsing," is so unnerving that even 
if you do not fear the consequences of reprisal,you cannot sleep anyway.

No one is allowed to sleep. Sometimes, it is tees, prisoners, upon the

I wish to say a few words further about the organization of the prison. 
The prison has 6 floors. It has the shape of the letter "111[1' and is enclosed 
in one of the courtyards of the Ministry of State Security. On the first 
floor, as a rule, are confined the women. There the cells are larger. All

the other cells are occupied by men. The first floor, if it may be so 
called, i.e., it is not the first, but the semi-basement, houses technical 
equipment, primarily, steam baths and showers. The batnouse is a small room. 
There are, of course, no bathtubs there. However, there is one tub used 
especially for sick people. You come here to the baths and can wash up. Cut 
into the door is a small glass window, through which the guard watches you 
constantly while you are washing. You can wash for 15-20 minutes. When 
thz 
you come, you go intoAbaths; you come here every week, you take with you 
all the bed-clothes, and you also take your underwear. You turn in your 
pillow case, sheet, undershirt, and drawers. And you receive all clean ones. 
After this, you are given a tiny cake of soap and a clean towel. You turn 
in the old, dirty one. You wash up, and dry yourself after this. If 
necessary, you are given a so-called "tanobrabotka," [hygenic treatment] 
i.e., hair-covered places are shaved. After this, you are returned to 
your cell by the same route. Also located in the semi-basement is the 
so-called "kkeborezka" [bread cutter]. This is a small room outside facing 
the downstairs exercise yard; I have mentioned only the two exercise yards 
on the roof. There is a 3rd exercise yard downstairs, very unpleasant, 
uncomfortable, and small, and much worse than those upstairs. And next to it 
is the room where the spare iron beds are stored. This room is full of 
bedbugs. Thus it is that strange as it seems, despite all measures, the 
bedbugs customarily begin to eat you up miserably when the bed is brought 
in. By means of lighted matches I would busy myself, despite the protests 
of the guard, in driving away these bedbugs, of which, thanks to time, there 
were many, and in crushing them, a deed which almost landed us in the 
lockup because the entire floor was soiled with the stains of these crushed 
bedbugs.

This was a basement cell, painted a blinding white and lit by a very 
strong light. It could have been of three or four hundred candlepower. 
The whole cell was flooded with blinding light, so that it was painful 
even to look at it. In this cell I did not notice a thing except one 
stool, on which sat an elderly person, about 50, evidently German; at 
least, he was dressed in a German military jacket without any dis-
tinctive markings. He had a very thin, emaciated and unhappy face, 
and he looked gloomily and fixedly at the peephole, as if he had been

returned me under receipt to my regular guards(dezhurnyye), who took me 
back to my cell. 
After I had stayed approximately eleven months in prison, one 
night, when I least expected it, a guard appeared and said, "What's 
your name" first to someone else, then to me. I called it out. He 
said: "To the interrogation." I thought that I was again being taken 
for an interrogation, but instead of leading me to the right, he placed 
me in the box at the left. In about five minutes my things, which were 
very few, were brought in. This is usually done in order that no one 
in the cell will notice that a man has been removed from the cell for 
good and whom you will perhaps never meet again. My effects, so to 
speak, were brought to me, and I began the entire procedure. I 
realized that they were sending me either to another cell or to another 
place. As it turned out later, I went through the entire procedure, and 
I was led after its completion, to the door, again through the detention-
reception room and seated in a Black Maria. I knew that I was being 
taken somewhere. I was taken quite a long way, then again some bolt 
resounded, some iron gates were opened, and I entered some place again. 
I went through the same procedure that I had undergone eleven months 
before in the Lubyanka. I was led away and found myself in prison. 
From the description of the prisoners, I realized that I had been 
brought to the so-called Lefortovskaya, a military regimented prison. 
This prison was a much more disorderly place than the inner prison of 
the Ministry of State Security. This was the building of an insurance 
company hotel, and it had not been rebuilt for prison purposes. This 
prison had been erected approximately 100 years ago, in the middle of 
the 19th century. It is built in the shape of a "K" and has three floors.

The floors were continuous so that you could see from the top to the 
very bottom. Along the cells extend metal gangways approximately 75 
centimeters wide. Floors are separated from each other by steel nets, 
so that the prisoners cannot jump and commit suicide. I would like to 
stipulate that the stairways at the Ministry of State Security, even 
those on which prisoners are never taken, as well as all the landing-
stages, were enclosed in wire cages to preclude all possibility of 
suicide. 
Lefortovskaya prison has an evil reputation. It is said that in 
the past, punishments were carried out in its vast cellars. It is 
really extremely somber, particularly the underground rooms. The 
cells are dark, but they have their advantages. In the first place, 
the cells have running water, which is a great convenience for the 
prisoners. On hot, stuffy, summer days you can strip to the waist, bathe, 
and sponge off. This is very important to you. Secondly, a flush toilet 
was provided. You, therefore, did not have to go out anywhere to a bath-
room. Th's was the second advantage. Of the negative features I shall 
mention the fact that located in the rear is an aeronautics institute, 
called, I think the TsAKI, [typographical error for TsAGI(?)7. There 
is a so-called wind tunnel there in which research on model aircraft is 
conducted. This makes a terrible racket and in especially the cells 
facing this direction there is no quiets day or night. The noise is so 
bad that it rattles the windows. The air vents open by themselves, and 
it is very difficult to sleep under this condition, keeping in mind also 
that the blinding light in the cells is usually not turned off during the 
day or night. 
It is interesting that the internal prison in the Lubganka is a 
prison intended for interrogations. Lefortovskaya prison is also a prism 
for crim'_nals under investigation. It is shaped like the letter "K" and 
surrounded by interrogation buildings added later in the shape of the

interior courtyard. Therewere also exercise courts here, far larger 
than those at the Lubyanka. Here you can actually breathe fresh air. 
Unlike the 15-minute walks at the Lubyanka, where there was clearly not 
enough time, here the walks were 15-20 minutes, and sometimes the guard 
would allow 25 minutes--in any case, you got to breathe fresh air a 
little longer. The routine here was exactly the same. You got up at 
0530. However, bedtime was a little earlier, at 2200, which was a 
great relief for the prisoners. Every half-hour of sleep was important. 
For that reason when they wished, to put it mildly, to subject some 
prisoner to the repressive measures of interrogation, then he usually 
would be taken to the Lefortovskaya prison. Thus I was somewhat 
frightened, for physical means of action, for example, beatings, were 
almost never employed at the Lubyanka. Even so, the Ministry resounded 
with cries, wails, and this But if they wished to employ such 
methods, they usually sent you to Lefortovskaya prison, which had a 
very evil reputation. Here there were a larger number of more spacious 
offices and various devices were available. The doors in these offices, 
unlike those in the Lubyanka, were padded and sometimes even double. 
The food in the Lefortovskaya prison was exactly the same as in the 
inner prison. However, it sometimes happened that food was left over, 
and the servers would give seconds on their own initiative, a practice, 
which was, of course, a great help because all the prisoners were 
suffering from dystrophy and starvation. There it is openly declared 
that this is not the ministry, and the work is not conducted so efficiently. 
It is true that here, too, prisoners are watched very strictly so that 
one prisoner mi.ght not meet another. Signaling is done by flags. Because 
of the fact that the entire prison is a passageway, a special guard with 
a red and white flag is stationed in it. When your cell is opened and 
you are taken out, he raises a red flag in the corridor from which your 
cell is visible. This is a signal for the guard not to open the cells

and take anyone elst out. When you are being escorted and the danger 
that you will be seen has passed, he raises a white flag. This operation 
is performed very efficiently. I was there almost an entire year, and 
not once did I meet a single prisoner, and later, when in the camps and 
meeting others who had been there, I did not see a single one who said 
that he at any time and at any place in the corridors, either at the 
Lubyanka of in Lefortov prison, had met any prisoner. 
Also taken to Lefortov Prison, as a rule, were all those prisoners 
who behaved badly during interrogations, i.e.,in some way quarreled with 
the interrogator, refused to answer or talk, or, on thJother hand, 
behaved, as they say, unstab: going on hunger strikes, writing too 
many declarations, brawling with other prisoners or with the guards, 
the personnel, or the interrogator. There are special penal cells for 
such prisoners at Lefortov Prison. These are rooms in the central part 
of the building, without windows or doors, with a cot which is screwed 
to the wall and retracted in the daytime, and only after retreat does 
the prisoner come and lower it with a key. Thus all day you are forced 
to stand or to sit on a stool, which is screwed to the floor. You can 
not read there, because they will not give you books. In the other cells, 
however,books are given. The cellars of Lefortov Prison enjoy a particu-
larly fearsome reputation, because it is said that in both the past and 
present tines executions have taken place there. Once, I managed, by 
accident, to see stretchers being carried out of there on which lay 
several sherts completely soaked with blood. As I learned afterwards, 
in spite of all precautions, suicide attempts still occur in the prisons 
rather frequently. It is amazing that some prisoners, dtspite the 
absence of any objects with which they could inflict some injury to 
themselves, managed nevertheless to commit suicide. I know, for example, 
of one prisoner's dying of heart failure. He committed suicide by hold-
ing his breath until he had a heart stroke.

The fact that I was transferred to Lefortov Prison was s sign that 
I was no longer a privileged, but an especially dangerous and interest-
ing)prisoner. At the same time, however, I expected all kinds of 
punishments for myself. It must be mentioned that at Lefortov Prison 
my interrogations were stricter than at the Lubyanka. I spent many 
unpleasant days ard hours. I was there approximately an entire year. 
One fine day after this I was taken from my cell, went through the 
entire formal procedure, and was escorted to the baths; everything was 
taken away from me, the things which were in storage were collected; 
I had a few trifles there--neckties, belt, everything which had been 
taken away from me and which I was not perm'tted to have in the cell, but 
remained was my personal belongings. All these things were returned to 
mer afterwards, according to my personal folder; a prisoner is always 
accompanied by a folder containing his personal prison file; in it is 
checked his. name and surname, year of birth, citizenshir, etc., etc. 
After this, I was placed in a Black Maria and was driven somewhere. 
No one knew where, of course, When we arrived, one of the prisoners 
who had at one time worked on the road--there were about 15 prisoners 
from different cells riding with me--said that we had arrived at 
Butyrskaya prison. 
Butyrskaya prison is one of the largest prisons i, the Soviet Union. 
In contains an average of at least 20,000 prisoners. It is a whole con-
glomeration of structures and buildings, from the famous Pugachev tower, 
which was built during the reign of Catharine the Great and in which 
the famous Yemel'yan Pugachev sat and awaited his execution, to the 
com'letely modern structures with large and small cells, and there is 
also an interrogation building in Butyrskaya Prison. There is also even 
a build'ng there for common criminals. On the everage there are from 
20,000 to 25,000 prisoners there. It is said that larger than Butyrskaya 
Prison is the famous prison in Kharkov, located, I believe, ol)polodnaya

Cora ./Mountain, and the famous Tashkent Prison, which serves all 
Central Asia and usually contains an average of almost forty or fifty 
thousand prisoners. 
Butyrskaya Prison has a good reputation. Here the regimen is more 
lenient than at Lefortov or the Lubyanka. I landed at once in a large 
cell 
if I am not mistaken, the Special Fourth Interrogation 25X1 
Building, as it is called. There were about seventy people there. This 
was a great delight for me. I immediately made the acquaintance of a 
number of people, including intellectualb. There were even former party 
members. There were also two Germans,here, etc., etc. At once everyone 
began questioning one another, exchanging impressions and discussions 
about interrogators, about *rho had met whom, who had seen whom, and 
several days passed by almost unnoticed. I was beginring to see clearly 
that my case was finally coming to an endnutyrkam I was hardly 
questioned at all. A fey times I was summoned for interrogation and 
brought aga:n to the Ministry. The questions put to me were of a 
technical nature: Do you know such-and-such, such-and-such, and such-
and-such? I, of course, did not know some of them, but the ones about 
which I did know, I tried to say I had forgotten. No one especially 
insisted upon it. This was simply the ending to my case. Also ',here 
in Butyrkam my file concerning the termination of the investigation was 
shown to me. I signed Oft Article 95 of the Constitution of the USSR 
concerning the termination of the investigation. This procedure is as 
follows: The interrogator sumr.ons you to him and says that your case, 
has been closed. It should be specified that I had had many interrogators.) 
about twelve. The ]at of my interrogators was a certain Senior Lieutenant 
Shatle, a Russified Latvian, and he left me my entire file. This file

only operational documents, i. e. denunciations and reports which workers 
of the operational organs of the USSR had made about me prior and even 
subsequent to my arrest,. so that I would not be able to take any action 
against them. This was standard operating procedure for the Ministry 
of State Sectrity. You have the right to read your file for as long as 
you wish. The interrogator has no right to limit your time. You may 
read for one, two, three.days. I devoted comparatively little time to 
reading my case--five or six hours--because there was very little of 
interest therein. It was clear who had arrested me, who had obtained my 
arrest. I found out something. I saw also the testimony of many of my 
comrades. This testimony was valuable in that it now told me who had 
fallen into the hands of the Soviet organs and who had not. I did not 
read the interrogations.:,-Evetyone knows quite well that such interrogatbns 
of prisoners take place in prisons. This is a very long, drawn-out, and 
disorderly account of your testimony. The interrogation is usually 
written up in the. way that the interrogator writes it, and you can either 
sign it or not. As a rule, the interrogator does not put on paper any-
thing which might lighten your position. However, Amp the purpose of the 
interrogation is only to squeeze everything possible out of you in order 
to be able to start further work on the case and in order to give the 
Soviet organs some kind of informatior interecting to them. This has no

chekists Rt the Lubyanka say, "He who is not in prison will be, and he 
who has been in prison will neve forget it." 
The basic system of :11-terrogatiors, speaking of interrogations in 
general, consists in holding the prisoners constantly in a state of 
nervous tension. Even the strongest individuals reach a state after 
which they mist be treated in a psychiatric hospital. The following 
incident shows to what extent people become nervous; In my cell was 
to 
an elderly prisoner, a Jew, and a very nice person,4whom another prisoner 
before leaving our cell said, "You saw that pipe which protrudes from 
the wall down below in the exercise yard." This was a rusty iron pipe 
which came out of the "Khleborezka" tread-cutting room0.27 simply to 
ventilate the room. "Well," he told him, "during the walks, you know, 
the chekists usually shoot their victims through this tube. They carry 
out the so-called silent sentence." We, of course, all laughed. No 
it 
one believedAbecause everyone knew perfectly well that no such sentences 
ever 
are, of course, carried out. However, at the next walk this poor man 
took the matter seriously and kept glancing back at the pipe, while 
begging us--there were four of us at the time--to allow him to walk 
in the first pair. No matter how we tried to convirce him that he was 
in no danger, he, for a period of approximately two weeks, until he was 
removed from our cell, subseouently refused to walk in the rear. 
After I had signer, Article 95, i.e. my case was closed, I returned 
to my former cell, said that oh, before thatlas taken to the

sat a certain Colonel Boyarinov, one of the administrative workers of 
the prosecutor's office. Also located there is the famous military 
prosecutor Kotov, or simply, as the prisoners call him in their slang--
everyone knows hi- very well; many have had contacts with hi m--
"Sin Kot," Lhosest English equivalent:"S.O.B.1.:7? 
It should be mentioned that in the course of the two years that 
my case was being handled, even more than two years until I signed 
Article 95, I had occasion to come into contact with and to be under 
the jurisdiction of three different,&gans of the./ apparatus. First-the 
purely, so to speak, operational,organ. Some time later or even before 
then, I found myself in the hands of counter-intelligence. It should 
be said that employees of the Soviet counter-intelligence, in regard 
to their activity and intelligence capacity, stand head an(' shoulders 
above all other officials. And they are far more clever and better-
educated than the workers of the interrogation apparatus. The workers of 
the operational organs stand a head higher. There is in them neitherlhat 
hit fetil'hi 
haughtiness nor, if such may be said, -wooers of responsibility and 
importance, such as workers of the Soviet intelligence have. These 
people, as is apparent, are accustomed to commanding and afraid of 
almost nothing. They are very well dressed, receive a magnificent 
salary, and in any event, they obviously are people whom the Soviet 
regime has given a vastasount of authority. Concerning the workers of 
the operational section, they stand a head 1-igher and aprarently heve mo 
special liking for their colleagues in the intelligence and counter-
intelligence organs. Later I landed in the hands of the interrogation 
organs, the interrogation apparatus. Interrogators are people who stand 
comparatively very low. They are very coarse, They are very often 
uncultured. They try to extract /Information/ by all sorts of crude 
methods. Actually they are totally unable to conduct a keen, psycho-
logical analysis of the individual who has fallen into their hands.

They lack even a general education. For example, imming once said that 
as a very young man, I hrd gone to spend a vacation in Denmark, the 
interrogator shouted at me threateningly for a long time that I should 
confess what I had dore in Denmark. He could not understand that in 
vv.lasiot 
Europe people with an ordinary passport could, witheut any Su* or 
difficulties, go abroad, let us say, to spend a vacation or for the sake 
of their health, and come back afterwards. 
In a fey weeks I had signed Article 951 if I am not mf'staken, a month 
and a half or two passed by) and I was suddenly removed from the cell with 
my things. I was taken to a cell where there were many different people; 
their personal belongings were also there. They were all speaking. II

I was located in the cell from which I would probablytidummoned for the 
announcement of my sentence. I was very much interested in who would 
sentence me, how, and to what. Then the summoning began. I, true to my 
principle, remained last. But no one came back to the cell. They had 
been summoned and taken away. At last they called me, too. This was to 
a small office in Butyrskaya prison, where I had been once before and where 
papers were filled out in regard to my arrival. Present here war: a man, 
/well-Pressed, stout, chubby, rather unpleasant, about '60, with an 
unattractive bald crown and a certain sly expression on his face. He had 
a yellow, rather crumpled briefcase... He asked me my name, and I, of

of stupid lecture to the effect that "you, together with the rest of you

Germans, milmibmisoboyeiftliMt 4rder to turn us into your slaves." But 
by this time I had long since ceased to be afraid. I declared whether it 
made any difference in the final analysis to be slaves of the Soviet 
regime or the Germansoof Hitler or Stalin? He said to me, "Don't be

know why you are here?" I, of course, knew, I suspected, but feigned 
innocence: "I do not have the honor to know." "Your sentence is being 
announced to you, and thank God you are in a democtatic country. In any 
other country you would be shot." After this, he mare a gesture with 
his hands that I was to rise. I, of course, stood up. He reached for.a 
small leaflet of paper and said: "In accordance with the decision of a 
special committee of the Ministry of State Security if Os USSR, you are 
hereby sentenced to 25 years in a corrective labor camp. You have been 
convicted on the basis of Article 58/4 , which pertains to the promotion 
of world bourgeoisie or collaboration with the world bourgeousie; 8 through 
19, 11--this is an attempt to commit group terror." At the bottom there 
appeared a strange, totally fictitious post script: "and for other 
crimes against the Soviet regime." From a formal point of view, I 
immediately declared my protest. "Please tell me whatilother crimes 
against the Soviet regime' means--that, I perhaps robbed a bank in 
Moscow or something? This immediately brought me three days in the 
lock-up. It is true, the lock-up was very pleasant. I got a nice 
guard, was fed immediately that same day, when I was brought a full 
bowl of Washa; the lock-up was warm. Afterwards I was taken from the 
lock-up very fast. Before the lock-up I spent several hours in the 
box before I was assigned here imrediately after leaving the man who 
had announced my sentence. In this same box were all those sentenced 
to 25 years. 
After the lock-up I was sent to the so-called death cell. The 
death cell, in view of the lack of capital punishment, is used for persons 
who have received over 25 years, i.e., the strictest penalty. This cell 
is fastened with five locks. Three locks are built into the door, and 
two are padlocks. The door has a very menacing and dangerous appearance. 
There were 15 of us there, an intelligent and very restrained group. We 
immediately became acquainted with one anotl-er. The peephole was never

closed; the guard, it was apparent, was watching us, afraid of what we 
might do. No one dropped in on us. Food, i.e. the bread ration, and 
dinner as well, was served through a so-called trough. The food trough 
was a small aperture in the door. 30 centimeters long l,?15-20 centimeters 
high, which was opened from the outside, but could not be opened from 
the inside, and at the same time formed a small shelf. When this 14d, 
the little door is opened, your bread is placer" upon it, the bowls of 
soup are served, and the feeding of the prisoners proceeds. All this 
itwasa 
time, it was apparent that Ow guard who had served and laid down the 
4:4 
bread and thenk moved off to th.16ide. He was afrald that we would do 
something to him through the opening, grab his hand or something else. 
However, nothing of the sort happened, of course. When it was seen 
that we w re a peaceful folk the "starshina" 2;*anior guard(?i7 
came to us. Timidly, he stopped near the door and asked us to move off 
to another corner of the room. We, naturall oved and then began to chat. 
For a half hour a rather peaceful conversation took place as to whether 
it was not possible to open the window in the cell a-little more often 
or go for a walk a little longer, and generally speaking the "starshina" 
saw that there was nothing frightening or dangerous about us despite 
our 25-year sentences, and after that, normal relations were established. 
I had not rema4ned in the cell long, namely about eight days, when 
suddenly together with a few other prisoners, I was taken to the so-
called "vokzal" /;tation/. This station, in prison jargon, is a special 
ce12, from which you go on to the "etap" I went through 
a whole procedure. I was bathed. The op-ortunity is given to rinse one's 
underclothes. Then I went through a sanitation process; this means that 
I was shaved again. Then I again underwent a search, and just as during

this, we were sent with our belongings to another room. Here appeared 
an official with our file and called us by our surname, first name, 
and patronym. Shoes were also issued to some. I, too, tried to get a 
pair of shoes, but because of my large feet, no shoes of my size were 
available. I had there some rather shabby slippers which did not stay 
on my feet. After this, 15 other persons and I were placed in a so-
called Black Maria and driven somewhere. The escorting guards behaved 
very harshly. They were, as it later turned out, Moscow Komsomols. 
They were dressed in splendid sheep-skin coats of high quality, white 
"valenki" ia kind of felt boot/ or more accurately "chesanki" also

with galoshes, or in other words, very splendidly, also fur caps. The 
people were all tall and healthy. In their hands they held Nagant 
revolvers, and after remov'ng us from the Black Maria, they began to 
drive us along the railroad tracks. There were also women among us--
about 70 to 80 individuals in all, who were taken out of several other ph 
prison veh'cles which had arrived. They drove us Very roughly until 
several persons, who had more baggage, and several vomer, fell. They 
shouted, "Get up or we'll shoot." However, an official, who rather 
coarsely.... said) "Where are you chasing them to? Don't you see that 
these people cannot walk?" A rather hostile discussirn with the use of 
unprintaae expressions ensued. After this they moved us on tether 
quietly. We saw a railroad car standing on one of the sidings. This 
one was an ordinary passenger car--in this instance it was even a 
Pullman car--with wire screens on the windows and with separate com-
partments, made into a so-called Stolypin car, i.e. the wall in the 
compartment an Instead of it, there is a wire screen. Here they

crammed into the Stolpin car that it was often simply impossible to 
breathe. Fortunately, there was one experienced individual, a rather 
suspicious lad, who said to me: "You know, Georgiy, let's not climb 
up on top. Let us stay below." I was rather cold, and I wanted to 
climb up on top, where it was the warmest. I did not know that in two cr 
three hours there would be a terrible stuffiness in this same compartment. 
We were all brought here, seated, and locked up. After this we lived 
removea 
in this same car for two more days, somphs4 the so-called travel rations, 
which at all "etaps" always consisted for some reason of salted fish, 
which ,a ate. After this salted fish we would be extremely thirsty, but 
there would not be any water, and the people suffered and were tormented.

I personally, knowing this, simply aussal self-control and did not eat the 
salted fish. 
In the Stolypin car, I traveled northward. At first, we could not 
determine the direction ir which we were going. Later, someone succeeded 
in looking through the grill through the window, and we saw that we were 
traveling due north, if I am not mistaken, along the Yaroslav Railroad. 
I remember passing through a suburb of Moscow which bore the name 
Losinoostrovska. It took us an even 14 days to reach Vorkuta. It was 
very agonizing. It was almost the most agthnizing of all my prison 
t4r 
experiences. The wpm was jam-packed. There were women. Also on 
board were some suspicious characters who called themselves "Banderists," 
but who apparently belongel to the criminal element. There was an average 
of 15 ipersons in each compartment. It was hot and stuffy; we were fed 
herring, and there was nothing to drirk. The train vent very slowly. 
Sometimes it stayed over in stations for an entire 24 hours. We were, 
as it later turned out,) coupled to various freight trains, ususlly empty 
ones en route to Vorkuta for coal.

Finally, after a series of ordeals, after 14 days had passed by, on 
the fifteenth day, namely 1 February 1950, we arrived someplace where 
from the bustle of the convoy personnel, it was evident that we were 
to be unloaded. One man took a look and observed some two-story 
buildings. He said, "They have brought us to Vorkuta." The unloading 
began, a very chaotic, unpleasant, and humiliating procedure. An 
with. dogs 
escort detail/immediately met us. They were the so-called "Krasno-
pogonniki,". wearing red shaalderboards Arasniye pogony, in Rassiarg, 
i.e., troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. We were surrounded 
on all sides by the convoy and for the first time I heard the famous 
formula: "Do not get out of ranks. One step to the right or left is 
considered escape) and the convoy will use guns without warning." And 
the following command: "Forward,marchl" We marched. First of all, 
we arrived rather soon in the so-called transfer camp Cperesyllnyy 
lager', in Russiag in Vorkuta. This was a camp consisting of very 
bad barraCks. The food there was poor. In addition, the common 
criminal or 1Llatnyy" [sig./ element was represented there to con-
Siderable dIree. Just the day before, a horrible knifing had occurred, 
several persons were slain, and others taken to the central hospital 
for operations and treatment. 
There were about 80 of us. At the very outset we were met at the 
gates by some suspicious characters; and when we arrived in the bar-
racks, it turned out that everything valuable in our possession had 
been taken tbnto account. They began to run up to us asking to 
buy various articles in exchange fora ration of bread. Most fof usJ 
were so depressed, so emaciated, and were in such dire physical and 
mental straits that without any resistance we gave up these articles, 
which, of course, had considerable value. Then we were issued cloth-
ing. There were 200-300 below zero 5entigrade7. Each of us was 
issued warm quilted trousers, a warm second-hand sleeveless jacket,

at that time in a serious state of dystrophy, which was quite advanced. 
It was difficult for me to walk. I wrote a request that I be given 
additional nourishment. I was turned down and instead advised to 
take more walks. Walking was very difficult for me, although the camp 
was not large. I walked, strolled, breathed the fresh air, and, gent/

were established. The categories in Vorkuta at this time were the 
following: first of all)Category 1; Category 1 underground and eate-

to work on the surface and those destined to work underground.

so-called light, individual work, which in practice, however, is 
included with the so-called mine surface. I immediately received 
light individual work. Despite this, however, I had towork very hard 
on the surface. Furthermore, there were the incapacitated, i.e., 
those who were considered unfit for work. They were immediately 
assigned to a special brigade for the incapacitated. Those of us 
who were seriously ill, i.e., really gravely ill, were ultimately 
sent to a so-called statSionar [hospital! for medical treatment. 
To get into a statsionar, especially in Vorkuta, the transfer point, 
or anywhere else, is considered paradise. In camp slang the 
statsionar is called "God's Kingdom." If you get-there, that means 
you have entered the Kingdom of God, for truly, when you land in a 
statsionat where you lie down and no one shouts at you, where you 
are treated and fed relatively well, and not driven to work, than 
you have finally attained salvation. As the saying goes, "one month 
in the statsionar is a year of life." 
Outright slave-trading began in this transfer point, i.e., people 
would even say here: "Has anyone come to buy you?" It was an actual 
fact that so-called "buyers" would come from all the mines. Who were 
these buyers? They were the representatives of the civilian staff, 
the mine administration, from the chief of the mine himself down to 
his subordinates, specialists in the various fields of attivity, who, 
having learned that a new contingent was at the transfer point and 
that the "kolesovka" kmedical examinationj had already taken place, 
or even before then, would attempt to determine just which specialists 
they were short of. Let us say, about 40 miners, 20 carpenters, 
several cabinet-makers, etc., are needed. Then they visit the trans-
fer point and select for themselves the 20 miners. Then they say: 
"I need a skilled cabinet-maker or a skilled carpenter, two medical 
assistants, and one doctor, etc."; i.e., a regular slave-trade would

occur. They say that even this transaction cannot get by without some 
drinking and sometimes) briber :6 behind the scenes. For instance, some-
one wishes to take 20 healthy miners, but someone else says, "Boy, 
you're 4 sly one: Look, I come from mine No. 5. which needs 40 [miners]: 
Well, Ivan Ivanovich, let us make some kind of a deal." The matter 
ends with the transfer of several hundred rubles into the hands and 
pockets of the chief of the transfer point or, more accurately, of 
the chief of personnel. Thereupon he gives his kind permission to 
this individual to take, let aa say, 20 miners. 
I spent ten days at the transfer point. No one, of course, bought 
me, because I Iva.= snffering from dystrophy and was almost totally 
incapacitated. However, in some way I got into trouble. I really 
do not know how or who had squealed on met probablp in looking 
through my file, someone for some reason had addessed me as an 
especially irportant criminal. I was relegated to solitary con-
finement, where several hooligans were serving time for fighting. 
From solitary confinement I was sent in a special detail accompanied 
by three escort guars with a dog--this was the procedure of the 
"etap" even for a single prisoner--to the so-called "Capital Pit" 
or Pit No. 1. When I arrived here, I was immediately examined and 
placed in the statsionar [camp hospital] as a person suffering seriously 
from dystrophy and totally unfit for work. I lay in the hospital

exactly four hours. Upon orders of the "operupol':nomochenyy Lopera-

"bur" were several men who had refused to work and several dommon 
criminals. From here we were marched to work in a special column 
with a special escort and were employed in jobs inside the camp. We 
were separated from all the others. 
From the bur I was again, for about a day, put into solitary con-
finement. Upon leaving the bur, I was again examined and it was 
decided to assign me to a llrigade. The system in the camps is as 
follows: all the prisoners are divided into brigades. No prisoner 
could say that he worked outside of any brigade. There are brigades 
of bricklayers, cooks, paperhangers, construction specialists, helpers, 
and finally fire brigades. ..very profession and every person who 
belonged to any particular calling was embraced by an appropriate 
brigade. There are, it is true, professions which are totally 
unnecessary in a camp, for instance, journalists, writers, and in 
general most of t he intelligentsia. In addition, there is usually 
no use even for engineers. There are too many of them. Sometimes 
they have tolAork at a new 3ne of work. If you fail to land a job in 
your own field, say as a bookkeeper, because all the bookkeeper jobs 
are already taken, then you have to go to a brigade to which you are 
rots? 
assigned or in which you wish toyork. True, it is4diffioult to trans-
fer from one brigade to another. Of course, it is always very easy 
to land a job in a brigade where the work is long and arduous. On 
the other hand, it is very difficult to transfer from brigades with 
hard work to one with lighter work. As a dystrophy-sufferer who 
was not even permitted to leave the camp for work, I obtained a job 
at first as ai orderly. This was the person who kept the barracks 
in order. 
Every barracks in Vorkuta has three section4. In this particular 
section the plank beds on:?which the prisoners slept were arranged in 
two rows. Each auch section--the sections are numbered 1, 2, and 3--

workers. The third section, as always, is the aristocratic section. 
Here live the bookkeepers, brigade leaders, and in general all the 
persons who are called the camp aristocracy or, in the camp slang) 
simply loridurki" /literally, "half-wits"/. The authorities sincerely 
believed,apparently, that the work of an orderly was light. Certainly, 
this was not the work of a miner nor the arduous labor of loading and 
stacking logs in the lumber depot, but, just the same, you were kept 
going all day liRA a mouse in a revolving drum. You had to clean, 
sweep, keep the prisoners satisfied, carry water, etc., and perform 
a thousand other duties. For me the work was extremely taxing. 
Soon, howev,r, I landed in the st4sionar. I had developed a severe 
inflammation of the leg blood vessels and was subsequently, as totally 
unfit for work, sent to the hospitaljwhere I was operated upoll. 
Every camp is nothing more than a copy of the Soviet system. It 
is a state within a state. The camp is, so to speak, a miniature 
copy of the Soviet Union, only with far worse living conditions. 
How is the camp organized? In the camp there are two categories of 
individuals who populate_lit, or more accurately, belong to it. There 
Is 
wow, first of all, the civilian labor force-.--civilian employees--and 
then the prisoners. First of all we shall mention the civilian 
employees. These were all employees of the so-called Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, i.e., simply the MVD, because all camps Come under 
the jurisdiction of the MVD. The 14VD has a special organ, called 
GULAG, i.e., Main Administratiion of Camps, which supervises the camps. 
So, all the civilian workers in the camp belong among the so-called 
MVD employees. There are military MVD employees. To this class 
belong all those who wear uniforms and are authorized to wear them. 
One such person, first of all, is the camp commander. Another is his 
deputy. Sometimes there are two deputy commanders of a camp point.

camp ministry of propaganda. It is engaged in the education of all 
camp inmates in the spirit 412 which the Soviet government believes 
all persons sentenced under the political or even criminal articles 
should be educated. The KVCh contains, first of all, a librafy, 
which the camp inmates may use. When I was at the Capital Pit, there 
were a few dozen books in all, there. A library was practically non-
existent. In addition)the KVCh manages. the so-called amateur acti-
vities of the camp inmates themselves, the cultural amateur activities) 
i.e., the camp inmates have the privilege of forming choruses, which 
sing songs, form theatrical troupes, put on shows, organize so-called 
theatrical performances, concerts, and engage in sports in their free 
time. 
So all these things are handled by the KVCh. It should be stipu-
lated that, as a rule, the really hard-working camp inmatesjor as 
they are called in camp slang, 
"rabotyagi," make very little use of 
these cultural facilities and institutions of the Soviet regime. They 
usually have neither the time nor?\energy for this. Athletics, soccer 
games, the organization of shows, and all amateur cultural performances 
are conducted by the so-called nonworking prisoners, who belong in 
the category of what in camp slang are called "pridurki"&reviously

who has been entrusted with almost the most inortant sector of work, 
namely, the feeding of the camp population_ itself. Subordinate to 
these individuals, who aru present in all these agencies, is a number 
of civilian workers, who are not officers, i.e., do not waar uniforms. 
The people working here are simply civilians, sometimes even ex-
prisoners who have served their terms. In this group belong assistants 
of all kinds, secretor*, bookkeepers, assistant bookkeepers, medical 
workers, civilian nurses, civilian doctors, the Oief (male or female) 
of the medical unit--all these people. It should be mentioned that at 
the Capital Pit, at which there were about 4,500 or even 5,000 prisoners, 
there were approximately 500 camp civilian workers. The staffs were 
heavily overmanned. People talked about this condition. They (the 
staffql would often be ieducetbut nothing came of it. It should be 
mentioned, however, that, generally speaking, the quality of work of 
the civilians was not very high. Everything was done by the prisoners. 
The civilians virtually only filled up space, received high salaries, 
and lived quite well. Not one of them, if he had quit worl:ing in the 
camp system, could have oetained such a good job anywhere else. The 
civilians themselves, of course, lived outside of camp. To get into 
the camp, a special pass was required. You possessed a pass. There 
were passes for one-time use and permanent passes, the latter issued 
for a specific period of time, sometimes for even a whole year. In 
passing the guardpost, where there was a check, you displayed your 
pass and then passed inside. You left the pass at the guard post; 
thus, inside the camp itself you were without docutents. This was 
done so that you could not lose it [the pasa7 and some prisoner 
could not appropriate it. When, as a civilian, you left the camp, 
you gave your name,or,,if you did not want anyone to hear it, you 
gave /Only the initial/ let us say, the letter "TO After this

pass?". If it is your pass, you say, "Yes." You take it and then 
leave the confines of the camp; Such was the organization among the 
civilian personnel. All of thenaof course, were strictly subordinate 
to the chief of the camp division D.agok,deleniyq, who was the abso-
lute ruler of the entire camp. The only individual who in practice 
was not subordinate to him, and to whom he himself was in practice 
subordinate, was the operational authorized agent. It should be 
mentioned that sometimes there would also be a special authorized agent 
in the camp, not of the MVD, however, but of the MGB, i.e. Ministry 
of State Security. This person had absolutely nothing to do with the 
prisoners; he watched over_all the,staff-workarofthe NKVD to see

Now I should like to say a few words about the prisoners. Prisoners 
represent the second category of individuals, by far the more numerous. 
How are they classified? These are all those sentenced under the 58th 
or the criminal articles. It is true, there are camps where there are 
almost no prisoners sentenced under the criminal articles. At the 
Capital Pit there were 20 of these. They were unescortea and they 
performed all the jobs for which it was necessary to leave the con-
fines of the camp continuously, for instance, conveying graLt, produce, 
and very many other things into the area. As I have previously men-
tioned, all the prisoners are divided up into brigades. The structure 
is as follows: Heading the brigade is the brigade leader. Just what 
is a brigade leader? He.zis' a reliable individual in a particular field 
of work and capable of leading people during work. Brigade leaders may 
or may not be specialists. The brigade leader does not work but is 
responsible for the volume of work produced by the brigade and for the

proper performance of the brigade. He looks to see that output is 
constantly increased. He is repponsible for this. The brigade leader 
is, so to speak, the low driving belt of the masses, as they say in 
camp slang. He is usually on Door and strained terms with the brigade. 
Then he is a good brigade leader and is recognized as such by the 
authorities. The brigade leader has a deputy. The brigade leader 
writes a report of the work. He specifies what percentage of the 
particular task has been fulfilled. In connection with this report 
a calculation of what (compensationY the brigade has a right to 
expect is made in the accounting office. When I was there, there were 
no wages. Instead, you received an appropriate "kotel" (diet, bill 
of fare, type of meal, cuisine, etc.1, depending upon the work. For 
underground miners there were first, second, and third kotels. The 
first was the worst, the second a little better, and the third the best 
of all for the underground miners. For the surface there were also 
first, second, and third 'cotels. There was also a special kotel "2A" 
for engineers and workers doing special engineering work. It was 
very good and totally inaccessible for the ordinary camp inmate. In 
addition to this, there was a number of hoppital kotels. Thus; the 
mess chief in the camp had to cook food and apportion it among an 
aggregate of almost 20 different kotels. This complicated the book-
keeping of the kitchen incredibly. There was a mass of bookkeepers 
and computers there; this whole matter was terribly comolicated. And 
it terribly complicated the preparation of the food, because the 
specific kotel to which you were assigned depended upon your output. 
If your output fell below a certain percentage, you would get the 
so-called disciplinary kotel. This was 300 grams of bread per day 
and one bowl of soup. If your work is still worse or you refuse to 
work at all, you would land in solitary confinement, where you are 
given 300 grams of bread per day and a hot meal every third day for 
health considerations. It should be stated that the kotel system is 
totally differEnt in different camps. 
Now a few words concerning the organization of the work day:

issued to you for the appropriate kotel. After you turn in your ticket 
for breakfast, a special part is Retached from it. fbe ticket is 
divided into three parts. The breakfast section is detached. After 
this you eat breakfast. You eat very hastily. Capital Pit was ter-
ribly overworked, there were not enough tables, and the dining room 
was very small. Consequently, no sooner had you elbowed your way to 
a seat when you had to bolt down your food. We we4ed in the follow-
ing manner: You sit four persons to a table of the appropriate kotel. 
Your ticket is collected from you and then the waiter immediately 
serves all four of Siou the appropriate meal. You eat up and vacate 
the table at once. After this the next party sits down. After break-
fast you go to the barracks. Here the brigade leader tells what job 
you are going on and whore you are going, if you had not already been 
so informed on the previous day. If you are going outside the camp, 
you assemble at the guard post. If you go to the industrial zone at 
the mine, you go to the guard post which controls the ming. The 
industrial zone of the mine is separated by the guardpost and no one 
without authorization or without a special pass is allowed to pass 
through to the m ne. If you are going into town, you go by way of 
the so-called city guardpost. You go out. The brigade leader calls 
the roll. After this, an escort of guards with dogs stands on the 
other side of the camp. The brigade goes out to work. If the brigade 
goes out separately from the other brigades, you will get your own 
escort, which consists of several men. Again the famous formula is 
uttered: not to break ranks, that a step to the left or right is

considered escape, and that in such an event the escort will use 
weapons without warning. Sometimes [you] are forced to take one another 
by the arm so that no one will escape from the other, or hold your arms 
behind your back. In the winter taking each other by the arm along an 
icy rough road is simply torture. The ranks became uneven and fall, 
the people curse among themselves, and step on one another. It is 
still more difficult, of course, to walk with one's arms behind one's 
back. Everyone knows what it means to walk on a slippery road without 
the opportunity to maintain balance with the arms. You are taken out to 
work and brought to the proper place. Around the objective, if it is, 
for example, a building, is a "forbidden zone," i.e., pickets on which 
is nailed [the notice] "Forbidden Zone" or else simply: "Halt, will 
shoot!" The escort guard begins to walk around. The 'job lasts ten hours. 
At the end of the job the brigade, after being counted all over again 
on the spot in exactly the same manner -- let us say there had been 28 
men, then there must (again] be 28 men -- returns. After taking a 
count, the convoy turns you over to the guards, i.e, the overseers, who, 
as in the prison, wear blue shoulderboards. The overseers conduct a 
search to see that you have not brought any contraband from the city, 
such as alcoholic beverages, money, which at that time it was forbidden 
to have on your person, or anyhing else. After this you enter the zone 
and can go have dinner. Your working day has ended and you may do any-
thing that you please. [You may] visit barracks, although this,tog4is 
somewhat frowned upon, generally speaking; as a rule, you are to stay 
in your own barracks and not visit too many friends. Subsequently, 
in the spring of 1952, all the barracks were locked up by special order. 
The taking [of prisoners] out to the industrial zone and the mine is 
carried out in absolutely the same manner. You are again counted and

admitted into the industrial zone. After this you are lowered into the 
shaft. With another count you are assigned with the appropriate bri-
gades to the pit sections- An inmate of a regimented camp works, as 
a rule, 10 hours. Including arrival and departure time, 12 hours of 
your time are consumed. At the mines it is the same thing. Going out 
to the pits, changing into working clothes, descending, working, and 
ascending, departure, and then washing up, also consumed 12 hours. If 
you are located too far from camp and return very late, then hot food 
is brought to you or it is cooked on the spot, for example, at the 
construction sites. There was no returning for dinner. This state of 
affairs was regarded by all the camp inmates as a true misfortune. 
Now I should like to say a few words about what Vorkuta is like. 
Vorkuta is a city located above the Arctic Circle On the 69th Parallel 
about 110 kilometers from the ArctLc Ocean, more precisely, from the 
so-called Karskiye Voroty, and 40-50 kilometers west of the northern 
Urals. On a clear day and from an elevated location, say, the heaps 
[terakonniki] of the pits, the Ura: Mountains are visible. Vorkuta, 
itself, has a total population of about 180,000-200,000. Of these, 
about 130,000-140,000 are prisoners. There are two camp systems in 
Vorkuta. One is the so-called "Vorkutlag," where there are about 
80,000 or even 90,000 prisoners. This is a system of permanent camps, 
partially serving the mines and partially serving other enterprises, as 
for example, certain plants, a stone quarry, etc. The prisoners in 
Vorkutlag are almost exclusively those who either had no association 
with Article 58, i.e., sentenceaunder the common criminal statutes, or 
were so sentenced but to minimum terms. The other system of Vorkuta 
camps is the so-called "Richlag", i.e., MVD River Camp. This a system 
of regimented camps, of which there are, if I am not mistaken, fifteen,

and in which are confined 4o,000 or 50,000 prisoners. Naturally, it 
is very difficult to ascertain the exact figure, but it is doubtful 
whether the number exceeds 50,000. What is this regimented camp like? 
This is a camp with a stricter regimen. The prisoners in it have far%ove. 
limited privileges. The regimen is far stricter. In the first place, 
from a non-regimented camp, such as Vorkutlag, you have the privilege 
of writing home as often as you please. From a regimented camp you 
can write only every six months. In the second place, in a non-
regimented camp you work eight hours. No one is authorized to make 
you work longer. In a regimented camp you work 10 hours, but in actual 
fact, of course, considerably longer. In addition to this, in a non-
regimented camp you have the privilege of receiving visits from rela-
tives, i.e., meetings are allowed. A wife can visit her husband and a 
husband can visit his wife. In a regimented camp such visits are com-
pletely forbidden. In regard to internal searches, daily routine, and 
a number of other things, conditions in a regimented camp are far more 
vexing, not omitting the fact also that you are searched far more 
frequently. For the slightest infraction you are subjected to far 
more severe punishment. 
I should also like to say a few words concerning relations between 
prisoners and civilians. As a rule, the administrative orders of the 
appropriate Soviet authorities, the camp administration, and the admin-
istration of the "Vorkutugol'" Combine,itself4all are directed toward 
the prevention, if possible, of all contact between civilians and prisoners. 
Of course, this is not fully possible. People work together, siit for 
whole hours in the same room, and under such conditions personal rela-
tions must inevitably be established. The civilians, however, are terri-
fied that they will be suspected of contact with prisoners or possibly

even be punished. For example, a female civilian receives 10 years 
for relations with a male prisoner and she herself becomes a prisoner. 
Exactly the same condition holds true in the case of a male civilian 
and a female prisoner. Civilians are not permitted to talk about any-
thing or maintain any relations with prisoners outside the circle of 
their immediate duties. For example, I knew a German working in the 
bookkeeping office who spoke Russian well. She [sic] was authorized to 
speak to him only on matters pertaining to work. Once she somehow 
began to ask him questions about, for example, life in Berlin and many 
other things. This conversation happened to be overheard by our 
officer, and I know that there were some very unpleasant consequences 
for this civilian woman. Civilian personnel are strictly forbidden, for 
example, to transmit anything for prisoners; even, for example to buy 
articles, but this practice is regarded indulgently. Especially severe 
is [the penalty for] the delivery of newspapers and books without the 
knowledge of the camp administration. Even more severely penalized 
and prosecuted is the transmittal of anything from prisoners to the 
outside, for example, letters to relatives or friends. This is a criminal 
and prosecutable offense. A civilian, if proof has been obtained that 
he, let us say, transmitted a letter or simply dropped it in a mailbox, 
is subject to immediate prosecution and may even be sentenced to a 
term; in any event he will be severely censured and lose his job. It 
should be said that civilians do this very rarely and very reluctantly. 
Why? Because, for one thing, there is a prevalence of so-called trusted 
people among the civilians in the camps. These are not ordinary Soviet 
citizens. The percentage of party and Komsomol members among them is 
very high. In addition to this, any person who has some sort of spot, 
or as they say in camp slang, "khvostik" [literally, "tail"] on his

record as a Soviet person, is never accepted for work in the camps 
and is not allowed to associate with prisoners. Yet, in spite of this 
I must say that I personally know of several instances of completely 
cordial and excellent relations between civilians and prisoners. As 
a rule, the civilians, of course, formally hold themselves very aloof, 
for this is necessitated by cold calculation and, so to speak, the 
tone of all life in the camps and particularly in Vorkuta. In reality,

however, the civilians never feel any genuine animosity 4iker the prisoners. 
This is conditioned by the fact that when they enter a camp, they are 
always told by Soviet propaganda that the camps contain incredible 
murderers, fascists, and beast, not humans. When they arrive there, 
they discover very soon that they [the inmates] are usually a very

there are no brawls. Despite thei opprern!?Tircumstances, a large 
number of them deport themselves with nobility, as decent and honorable 
persons. Well-known for instance, is one such case: a certain 
civilian woman bookkeeper, who was walking out of the camp in Vorkuta 
one day, was stopped tllout a kilometer (,?) from the camp by three

knife-welding drunks, who demanded, "Hand over your money or we will

camp, walking and weeping. By chance she was met right in front of 
the guard post [by someone?], was directed to the administration to 
report this misfortune; it seems that even more had been taken -- 2,200 
rubles -- a huge sum for her. She would have to pay it, might even 
be taken to court, and be fired. He [?] asked her, "What are you 
crying for, madame?" Sobbing she related what had happened. "So what 
are you crying for?", he said. (At that time, the prisoners were paid

money.) "Now," he said, "everything will be all right, do not go 
anywhere; sit down a while in our bookkeeping [office?)." She sat 
down. He ran around to the camps and barracks and each of the 
prisoners contributed three to five rubles. As it turned out, 400 
rubles more were collected. Within two hours, this entire sum was 
brought to her in paper bags, superficially counted again, and she 
departed with several paper bags stuffed with money. Later she said, 
"They gave 400 rubles more." It is true, she was severely scolded for 
this by the administration. A long stubborn search was made for the 
initiators of this collection for the unfortunate bookkeeper. There 
were miners there, who earned well; the three or five rubles in this 
urgent case meant nothing, strictly speaking, to anyone. 
It should be mentioned that just as there existed among the camp 
inmates so-called "stukachi," i.e., a network of agents subordinate 
to the "operupol'nomochennyy," which works and reports on everything 
taking place in the camp, and an agent network of a most diverse 
character, ranging from agentSwho watch to see whether the prisoners 
possess knives or cutting and stabbing implements to those who especially 
catch individuals who, say, are preparing uprisings or escape attempts 
or forming in camp anti-Soviet groups or any affiliates of political 
parties existing on the outside, so, too, among the civilians there 
exist these stukachi, i.e., the same system which exists among the 
prisoners is fully duplicated. However, in Vorkuta there lives a large 
number of people who had previously been prisoners themselves, either 
some place else or right there in Vorkuta, had been released, and 
ordered to reside in Vorkuta itself. These people are particularly 
courteous in their treatment of the prisoners. They regard the latter 
as their own. Despite the fact that they have been freed, they say,

"We are hardly different from you." Everywhere they emphatically try 
to protect the prisoners. If some, let us say, escorting guard is 
driving a column in front of him and is treating it roughly, people 
and I have personally heard this -- will break out into indignant 
shouts, whistles, jeers, etc. Once I was working at the digging of a 
ditch in one of the main streets of Vorkuta when I saw a woman passing 
by. A guard shouted something coarsely to a prisoner and told them 
"[the prisoners] not to climb out of the ditch, sit down, or rest, al-
though he had no right to order this. It was not his concern to super-
vise the work; for that there was a brigade leader. This woman assaulted 
the guard with abusive cursing and deliberately walked through the 
restricted zone past the prisoners. Several times the guard shouted, 
"Halt, or I will shoot," Nevertheless, he decided, of course, not to 
shoot. Such marks of sympathy among freed prisoners are openly visible. 
Among the people belonging to another camp, i.e., the chekists who in-
habit Vorkuta, and the employees of those countless existing institutions 
which service both mine and camp, the attitude is, of course, different. 
It is one of coolness. Hatred, however, especially among the women, is 
totally unknown. I once took part in the repair of a stove belonging 
to the wife of a certain colonel, an important chekist, whose name I 
had heard earlier. She was a very young and intelligent woman. Her 
husband said something rather important to us and then left. As soon 
as he had gone, she opened the door and said, "Has my husband left?" --
"Yes, he has." -- "Ny husband has invited you in to dine on some canned 
meat, but since it would be inconvenient for him to be present and sit 
with you personally, he vent away. So, please," she said, "Sit down and 
eat." Such incidents do occur. 
The entire prisoner population in the camp is, of course, divided 
into a vast number of very diverse individuals and groups, and simply

friends. Finally, there are small groups which pursue very specific 
aims. For example, there exist secret groups which prepare escapes. 
At the Capital Pit such a group among Latvians was revealed to me. 
They were supplied with five pairs of home-made skiis, knapsacks with 
grease, and many other things. The people were clearly planning 
escape. There are groups which conduct, let us say, ideological and 
political activities among themselves, conduct lectures for one another. 
I personally participated in two such groups, simply political and 
self-educational. These were not political parties, but we aimed to 
raise our general level of political education. Also taking part in 
this group were even people who did not really belong to us, i.e., 
camp Communists and those who considered themselves such. Thus, we 
exchanged opinions and held very friendly discussions. Each one gave 
a speech and then stated how this appeared from the Marxist viewpoint 
and how it appeared from a completely different viewpoint. The Com-
munists were very much interested in learning what Western ideology 
pictured them to be and we, on the other hand, were extremely interested 
in learning the thoughts of members of the Communist Party, though .they 
mos convicts who had not yet renounced the ideology of the party. 
Furthermore, it should be mentioned that in all camps there exist 
affiliates of political parties whose members have landed behind wires. 
Among the Ukrainians can be encountered representatives of the Ukrainian 
party known by the name of the Bendera [sic; Bandera?] party. In camp 
they are simply called Benderists [Banderists]. There are also repre-
sentatives of another Ukrainian political faction, the followers of the 
political movement of a certain Melnik. I also encountered a few --
very few, it is true -- monarchist advocates, who now are dying out, 
of course, and followers of Skoropadskiy.

Also represented were political parties among the non-Russian 
groups, for example, the Baltic peoples. I know that among the 
Estonians there were in the camp a large number of political groups, 
not very noticeable, it is true, for Estonian: , generally speaking, 
is a difficult language. The Estonians behave in a very friendly 
manner. There are not many "stukachi" and "seksots" [kinds of in-
formers] among them, but one Estonian, who was very friendly with me 
and, so to speak, trusted me, told me that we [sic] had small meet-
ings of an Estonian quasi-Social Democratic party and said, "Right in 
the next barracks live our political opponents regarding Estonia." 
There are exactly the same political parties among the Latvians and 
Lithuanians. They were especially busy among the Lithuanians for, as 
is quite well known both in the camps and throughout the Soviet Union, 
2 
the Lithuanians are Om people who until the last day never ceased 
their armed warfare against the Soviet regime. 
When I was enroute to Vorkuta, a group of students, some from 
Moscow and some from other cities, was traveling with me. This group 
of students., who had become disillusioned with the Soviet regime --
many of them had been philosophy faculty students engaged in the 
serious study of Marxism -- had arrived at the conclusion that Marxism 
was a false doctrine, which offered nothing to humanity and was ex-
tremely harmful to the Russian people, in particular, Their next step 
was the formation of a small anti-Soviet group. In their opinion, 
there were a great many of these anti-Soviet groups. Well known are 
the alarming reports which reach the Soviet authorities and severely 
distress the Communists that are academic youths of the large centers 
stand at the forefront in the formation of anti-Soviet groups.

Strongly represented among youth in the camps, furthermore, is 
the element of so-called "true Leninists," as they term themselves. 
These are people who did not depart from Marxist-Soviet ideology. They 
merely believe that Marxism had been incorrectly interpreted by Stalin 
but correctly interpreted by Lenin and,therefore, they believe that to 
combat all the defects existing in the present-day Soviet government> 
it is necessary to travel under the banner of Lenin and not to adhere 
to the course so incorrectly taken by Stalin and the entire Communist 
Party, which followed him in slavish stubbornness. 
There are also groups in the camps which have long broken with 
Marxism and believe that Russia should be transformed into a national 
state without Communists. 
There are also small groups which are supposedly7IEF1514112Zed)

order to over,throw Communism, we must fight together with the Russian 
people, because each of us separately could not liberate ourselves from 
the Communists. Liberation from the Communists can be achieved only 
on a general scale throughout the Soviet Union. Some of them picture a 
formation of national, totally independent states following the over-
throw of Communism, believing that it will be necessary to break off 
completely and forever with the Russian people. The first paragraph 
to be inserted iritthe constitution of this nation will read that all 
affiliations with Russia dre forever revoked. Others, on the other

cultural autonomy is fully sufficient, for the general trend of events 
in the world today does not tend toward the creation of tiny destitute 
states with limited economies but, on the contrary, toward the creation 
of federations and federal governments. Such tendencies also exist. 
Of whom are these representatives of the various national groups com-
posed? A great many are former members of the German army who had 
been in the West, Georgians, Armenians, mountain peoples, Azerbaydzhanis, 
and Central Asiatics who had been in the West and had come into contact 
with those of their fellow-countrymen who had long lived in exile and 
had organized several anti-Soviet and national-independent centers to 
fight for national liberation of their people from foreign domination 
or, as sometimes even said, from the domination of the Communist party 
of chekists. I myself have heard such expressions. 
In the camps, there are also various religious groupings. These 
are mainly sectarians. Strangely enough, the majority of them originate 
from the North Caucasus, Southern Ukraine, and Siberia, and fewer, 
strictly speaking, from the European part of Russia proper. The 
sectarians present are extremely diverse. I know as many as ten dif-
ferent sects. In this regard mention should be made, first of all, of 
the so-called "Jehovah's Witnesses." They are very numerous and active. 
Secondly, mention should be made here of the so-called "Seventh-Day 
Adventists." In third place, are the "Evangelical Christians." Then 
Conte the "True-Believing Christians," and the Baptists. In addition, 
there are the so-called "Baptist Adventists," apparently, a very tiny 
religious group, for in one camp I met only three individuals and I 
never heard anything more about them. Also represented in the camps, 
of course, are all the traditional religions, which, strictly speaking, 
should not be related to the so-called sectarian movement. This, of

course, refers primarily to the Moslems, who in general are very 
numerous. I do not say this because the number of Moslems is so large 
but because there are very few non-devout Moslems. They are without 
exception all believers and adhere very firmly to their rituals. 
Mention must also be made ti the principal group of religious 
believers represented in the Soviet Union despite all the losses which 
this group had suffered. I am speaking, in particular, of the [Russian] 
Orthodox Christians. Generally speaking, there are very many believers 
in the camps, although there are not so many priests. The difference 
between the Orthodox and the representatives of the small, tiny sec-
tarian groupings is that the latter are very active, conduct endless 
religious meetings, and preserve secret copies of bibles and various 
religious books. As for the Orthodox, they behave more passively, 
though very firmly. They pray but do not hold special gatherings and 
do not behave as the sectarians do. The number of believers in the 
camps is very great. It should be mentioned that, as a rule, even 
many who are non-devout, when they find themselves in the camp system, 
became so. The sectarians in their propaganda usually lodge the ac-
cusation at the Orthodox that the Orthodox Church has ceased to be a 
church but has been converted into an arm of the State, i.e., they say, 
"How strange it is that, strictly speaking, your patriarch even in 
his   does not say a single word about God, or says very little, but 
always talks mainly about only the authorities and about subordination 
to the State authorities. The Orthodox believers deny this point of 
view but almost all agree that, of course, the official Church, as such, 
has capitulated to the regime, does not think of opposifig:the regime 
in any way, and has long since been transformed, strictly speaking, into 
an organ which, by means of religious authority, trains the people into

obedience to the authorities, passiveness, support of the Soviet regime, 
and into the proper unquestioning attitude toward it. Nothing very 
nice is expressed concerning the patriarch. In general, he is not very 
'net 
well regarded. People say that he isAreally a spiritual leader but 
almost, strictly speaking, an official of the Soviet regime for church 
affairs. People often also speak ill of many other Orthodox leaders, 
who are openly accused of being connected with State Security organs 
and it is derisively said that they are nothing but chekists who, with 
Nagant revolvers in their pockets, have pasted beards on themselves 
for the sake of form. Whereas the official Church of the leaders does 
not enjoy confidence, the low, rank-and-file priests and devout be-
lievers, who hold themselves very steadfast, enjoy great confidence 
and respect. I know of the case of an Orthodox priest who refused to 
go out to work, maintaining that this contradicted his beliefs and 
debased his dignity as a priest; he was held in custody for a long time 
and, according to rumors4not confirmed, it is true, this unfortunate 
was finally- shot. Here and there in the camps an Orthodox service 
is held. In 1955, in a camp where the majority [of the inmates] were 
Germans, I personally attended an Easter service in a separate building 
which contained the so-called "Chinese kitchen," i.e., a kitchen in 
which prisoners had the privilege of cooking things with their own food 
products. Naturally, these things were not allowed to be cooked in the 
big kitchen. Here [in the "Chinese kitchen"] was conducted the entire 
Easter morning service, for which a great many people had come. Because 
space here was comparatively very limited, many were unable to enter 
this tiny building and stood outside. When a guard, a foreman fstarshinal, 
I believe, the chief of the camp regimen, appeared and tried to enter, 
he was simply rather rudely driven away, the door was not opened, and

he was told to leave, that there was freedom of religion, and that 
he had no business here. In general, the Orthodox love and respect their 
Church very much, regard it as a martyr Church, and go far from identify-
ing the true believers and the lower Orthodox clergy with those leaders 
who for one reason or another are, of course, accomplices of the Soviet 
regime itself. 
I should like to say a few more words about Vorkuta. The civilian 
population of Vorkuta is a strange conglomeration. As everyone says, 
this is a city of both erisoners and chekists. Nowhere else and 
hardly anywhere in the USSR will one find such a city where the percentage of 
chekists and, at the same time, ex-prisoners, is so high. People who 
are not former prisoners and/or do not belong to the chekists are, 
strictly speaking, very rare in Vorkuta. This creates a special type 
of relationship. All the ex-prisoners take the part of the not yet 
liberated prisoners, while the chekists, on the other hand, represent a 
special caste. However, Vorkuta is a country still far from being 
mastered by the Soviet regime. Of course, sometime before my arrival I 
wanly 
heard a rumor of the uswitibt of so-called Gen.Belyayev. I was also 
informed of one other mutiny, which took place south of Vorkuta, some-
where on the Pechora, among former Vlasovite soldiers. Unfortunately, 
I no longer know the details. 
I should like to say a few more words concerning relations between 
the administration and prisoners, in particular, about the use of the 
latter as a labor force. As is known, every prisoner, by law and accord-
ing to camp procedure, must perform only such labor as is stipulated by 
his labor category, i.e., labor which is not beyond his strength and 
which will not result in injury to him. That is the way it is officially. 
In reality, the situation is quite different. The camp administration

always tends to give you a higher labor category. Sayiyou have light, 
individual labor; then you are simply given labor Category 2. Several 
times, I personally found myself suddenly and unexpectedly in labor 
Category 2. You do not see your personal papers and do not know what 
is ordered for you at the medical examination. You are examined and 
written about [?] at the medical examination, then are suddenly told, 
"You are transferring to Brigade No 47." "Why, please? That, you 
know, is heavy surface work, unloading at the lumber depot." So, you 
are told that you have Category 2 surface labor. You begin to protest. 
You write a statement, and take it to the medical examination. You are 
told, "Wait a little while, there will be a new medical-exabilination, 
see, one month, two, three will go by, and you work there until you 
make a fuss or are discharged from there." Of course, the tendency is 
always to drive the prisoners to heavy work. In 1950, when I arrived 
in Vorkuta, the so-called Gorey brigade, a brigade for those unfit 
for work, was there. In it at the time were 147 men. Three years 
later, when I left Vorkuta, this brigade, despite  , numbered about 
420 disabled persons. Thus, the camps are constantly being littered --
if it is possible to use such an expression -- with the incapacitated and 
for that reason workers constantly arrive in the camps and the prisoners 
lose their fitness for work. In comparison with the years 1944, 1945, 
1946, and even 1947, when nightmares and mass extinction virtually 
prevailed in the camps -- everyone talked about this and medical help 
was very poorly organized -- in 1948 and in 1948 there began a considerable 
improvement. 
Concern is shown for the health of the prisoners. The concern is 
identical, say, to that shown by a veternarian over the health of a 
work-animal. In Vorkuta there are medical establishments. This is the

so-called "sanchast'" [medical section], headed by the sanchast' chief, 
usually a serviceman of the medical service, sometimes male, sometimes 
female, to whom a number of civilian medical workers is subordinate, 
usually very few. Then came medical workers composed of prisoners. 
The trend, it is true, is always to fill all positions of, let us say, 
doctors allotted to the staff of a given camp -- if I am not mistaken, 
according to the regulations one doctor is required for every 400 camp 
inmates -- by civilian doctors, who receive handsome salaries. Some-
times these positions are not filled by doctors at all, but by "fel'dshers" 
[medical assistants] or even nurses, who by law receive the salary of a 
doctor and attached to whom, filling the position of a fel'dsher, even 
of a hospital orderly [sanitat, in Russian] is a real doctor, who 
performs all their work for them. 
Doctors in the camps constitute a privileged class. They command 
respect, because there is a large number of very fine doctors, but 
primarily because doctors, in general, are in short supply. As a rule, 
there are not enough doctors and for that reason a doctor can take many 
a liberty for which someone else might simply be "written off", i.e., 
sent to common labor. A doctor is permitted many a liberty because, 
in the second place, there are excellent doctors, especially the for-
eigners, and many are better than:the local doctors. [Sense of this 
too 
aentence notAclear.] As is known, almost all the civilian personnel, 
as a rule, also all civilians able to enter the camp and simply free 
people are treated or try to be treated by the camp doctors. I per-
sonally had occasion to meet a large number of very outstanding doctors, 
famous German professors, and several Hungarian and Soviet professors. 
For example, the famous Ukrainian gynecologist, Prof. Khokhlov, was in 
camp.

Vorkuta, when suddenly and unexpectedly, I was taken to an "etap". I 
was thoroughly convinced that I was being taken to Moscow for renewed 
interrogation but, instead, I travelled a short while in another 
direction. Again the Black Maria to Vorkuta and the Stolypin railroad 
car. True, I was noW travelling under better conditions: not so 
many people were taken away from Vorkuta as were brought to Vorkuta. 
I rode four days as far as Kirov, where there was a layover for two 
days [for changing trains]. This afforded an opportunity for resting 
in camp. Then off for Gorkiy, from there to Ruzayevka Station, and 
from there to Pot'ma. 
Potima is the terminal of my journey. In short, I had arrived

in Mordovia, the Mordvinian SSR [sic], *Is the system of regimented 
camps of the so-called Dubrava% camp. This system completely corresponds 
to the river camp in Vorkuta in its organization, structure, and 
traditions. Everything is absolutely the same. The population of 
the Dubravayy camp at the time was also about 35,000-40,000, but the 
line of work was completely different. Whereas in Vorkuta everything 
revolves around the extraction of coal and the mines; in Mordovia 
there are no mines; there the work is forestry, peat mining, or work 
in various manufacturing operations and woodprocessing factories. For 
instance, in the eleventh camp division, where I subsequently was, 
there was a furniture factory. 
Dubravaa camp has borne this name only since World War II. 
Until then this system of camps was called the Temnikovskiye camps. 
Besides this there are in Mordovia two other camp systems, the names 
of which I do not know. And one camp system in which some kind of 
strategic constructions are produced, but there were absolutely no 
foreigners there; virtually only Russians with 25-year sentences

work there. Information is very meager. It is known that some 
type of underground plants requiring a considerable amount of 
pipes is being built there. 
The MVD Dubravsa camp system embraced about 20 different 
camps. They all are located along the railroad siding which 
branches out from the main magistral and from the siding from 
Saransk to Ryazan'. It extends in a northwesterly direction for 
a distance of 60 kilometers. And over these entire 60 kilometers 
this region is considered restricted -- lies the so-called DubravsOr 
camp system. This also is a regimented system, but somewhat different. 
Life in Mordovia is considerably better for the camp inmates than 
In Vorkuta. In the first place, it is a different climate. The 
climate is moderate. Absent is the terrible, severe, ferocious 
Vorkuta winter, which begins in mid-September and stretches out to 
the end of May. In Vorkuta,besides the specific jobs assigned to 
them, the camp inmates are worn out by the so-called "snow struggle," 
i.e., you could work 10 or 12 hours, return to the barracks, and go 
to sleep. During this time a snowstorm would cover your barracks 
with snow. In the morning, whether you wanted to or not, you had 
to get up earlier and shovel away the snow for two hours. In the 
MVD Dubravsa camp, there were somewhat different circumstances. 
In the first place, the work there was easier. In composition, the 
camp inmate contingent was exactly the same as in Vorkuta? i.e., 
mainly Article 58 convicts, although there were also some camps in 
which common criminal prisoners were represented, i.e., those 
sentenced other than under Article 58. For that reason, the 
personal and physical condition of the people inhabiting these 
camps was considerably weaker, i.e., the percentage of sick and 
disabled was considerably higher. It may essentially be said that

in the Dubramacamp there were almost no Category 1 workers, of 
which there were a great many in Vorkuta. Hence a great many 
were incapacitated, both because of unfitness for work and advanced 
age. Here the mood was completely different. It should be said 
that in the Dubravaa camp sentiments were not at all so radical 
as in Vorkuta. This is explained by the fact, as I later learned, 
that within a year after my departure a wave of military (?) 
uprisings had spread all over the northern part of the Soviet Union, 
including Vorkuta. There were no such uprisings in the Dubravaa 
camp. However, when our transport was leaving, many Russian 
prisoners said that they were only waiting for us foreigners to 
leave, and then they would raise a commotion here that would be 
more orderly than in Vorkuta. But these were the words just of 
prisoners who had arrived in the camp from Vorkuta. 
With respect to proportions, the proportion of foreign prisoners 
in the Dubravaa camp was, generally speaking, higher than in Vorkuta. 
In Vorkuta, it should be stated, the foreigners -- I am counting 
both foreigners and inhabitants of the people's democracies, 
but I am not counting those from, say, Lithuania, Latvia, and 
Estonia, which were formally annexed to the Soviet Union --
constituted approximately five percent (of the camp population], no 
more. In the Dubravaa camp the percentage of foreigners was 
higher: about 10-12 percent, and for some time -- for example, 
the 11th camp division, where I was -- it was, generally speaking, 
reserved for foreigners, i.e., 80 percent of its inmates were not 
Soviet citizens, but mainly Germans, Hungarians, Rumanians, Turks, 
Frenchmen, and representatives of a few other minorities, of whom 
there were not very many.

When I was in the Dubravya system I because of the deteriorated 
state of my health, was placed in the ninth camp division, the 
so-called central hospital. Here in Dubravaa people were saying 
rather openly that some camp reforms were being prepared. Such 
talk occurred even before the death of Stalin. When, then, in the 
spring of 1953 Stalin died, everyone unanimously began to say 
that great changes were now to be expected, both in world politics 
and in the Soviet Union, and, of course, first of all in the camp 
system. And, as a matjer of fact, changes were not long in coming. 
First of all, an amnesty was proclaimed, a Supreme Soviet ukase 
pardoning those convicted under the criminal statutes with the 
exception, I believe, of those serving especially long terms and 
those convicted for murder or something similar. The mass of these 
prisoners poured out into freedom. The result, according to 
Information transmitted from the outside, was most undesirable. 
Nowhere in a railroad station is it possible to leave a suitcase; 
In an instant it is stolen. The people were a little disillusioned. 
Later, an amnesty for those sentenced under Article 58 to terms of 
three years or less was proclaimed. This amnesty brought nothing 
but the most profound disillusionment. As everyone knows perfectly 
well, the proportion of people sentenced under Article 58 to terms 
of three years or less cannot be more than one in a thousand. For 
example, during all my eight years [imprisonment], I believe that 
I actually encountered only one such person. Even that was not 
certain. Thds? the result of this was practically nothing. Then 
came silence, though persistent rumors circulated that there was 
to be more leniency in the camps. On the heels of these, indeed, 
came the downfall of Beriya, in June 1953. The following incident 
took place in our camp division: a convoy guard ordered a brigade

going out to work to fall into columns of fours. One place remained 
vacant. Then he said, "Anybody, fill in this place!" One of the 
prisoners turned around to him and said, smilingly that we were 
saving this place especially for Beriya. Holy terror was mirrored 
In the face of this guard, as though some sacrilege had been uttered. 
"All right," the guard said, "rust wait; I'll fix you right now." 
And he ran back to the guard post to report this. Someone came out 
of there and began to shout. Then the prisoners rather maliciously 
said to him, "Pardon us for saying so, commander, sir, but you do 
not listen very carefully to the radio." Just at this time the 
latest news, which came on at 0730, began to be broadcast, and 
the confused guards, in view of the circumstances, went back without 
taking any repressive measures. The majority of camp inmates, 
however, reacted rather skeptically toward the fall of Beriya. They 
simply said, "One fiend has eaten another." In reality, nothing 
good was expected. Everyone was glad that the man who had, without 
question, spilled an ocean of blood had been punished and destroyed, 
but in reality, most of the camp inmates, with their inherent 
skepticism, believed that no substantial changes would or could 
come. However, everyone expected something to happen. Subsequently, 
there came an amnesty for the so-called "maloletki," i.e., individuals 
who had committed their crimes before the age of maturity, age 
twenty-one. Their convictions were set aside and they were allowed 
to return home. This was an amnesty solely for Soviet citizens. 
In the summer of 1953, however, foreigners began to be assembled, 
particularly the Germans. We (fl found out about this. The first 
transports left for the West. I believe that a transport of 1,500 
Germans departed from Dubrava camp. Following these came transports 
of Hungarians, Rumanians, and other nationalities. Liberated most 
of all and on several occasions were the Poles.

It should be said that in Potima the attitude of the population 
was also very good, though not the same as in Vorkuta. Former 
prisoners [in Vorkuta], they considered themselves 50 percent camp 
inmates and simply caused disturbances for the administration, 
guards, and military personnel. The attitude in Pot'ma, and, 
generally speaking, in Mordovia, in the villages located near the 
camps was somewhat different. Here there were very few people who 
had served time in camps, but all around, instead, were a poor 
kolkhoz and sovkhoz population and railroad workers who earned 
very poorly. The camp inmates noted a very good and truly cordial 
attitude toward them on the part of this entire populace. It should 
be mentioned that none of the surrounding population could, of course, 
help the camp inmates, since Mordovia was in general one of the 
poorer autonomous republics of the Soviet Union and the majority of 
the people were hardly any better off than the camp inmates. For 
instance, it was known quite well that at one time bread was not 
portioned out but was left over. Everyone was entitled to receive 
700 grams of bread, yet there was bread left over. Therefore, a 
large tray simply lay in the dining hall, on which was placed 
some sliced-up bread and everyone coming for breakfast, dinner, 
or supper would take as much as he needed. Some even fed horses 
and pigeons there, for which they were prosecuted [?] Thus, it 
Is known that a large number of civilians, such as nurses [?], and 
many others, would simply come with bags and take bread out of the 
camp; they would be very satisfied. Having the personal opportunity 
to obtain material at the furniture factory, the gauze [marlya, in 
Russian] with which sofas were upholstered, simply rags, I frequently 
gave away the rags to free people, including guards, to be used as 
foot cloths. Here, they say, after all, foot cloths don't lie on

the streets, you have to buy them, they cost something. Just the 
same, here they are obtained for nothing. 
The populace was dressed very poorly. Often I was asked by 
many people, since I worked at the time in a laundry, to, say, wash 
their linens for them for nothing. I would ask, "But,why, don't 
you have a laundry?" They would say that they had to wash things 
themselves, for there was no laundry. Besides that, soap costs 
something, and you manage somehow. See, you save another ruble. 
Just as a favor. For this, a civilian would buy fats, which were 
not available in the camp storelfor me. It should be said that he 
could not buy much for me, because the store in the village of Pot'ma 
was really not much better in goods than the camp store, i.e., it 
contained just those things which no one needed: magnificent 
perfumes, eau de cologne, and elastic suspenders; a suit for 1,800 
rubles could be bought, but butter, sugar, fats, and white bread 
were nowhere at all. 
I should like to add a few words concerning relations among 
the nationalities. In camp the situation was generally as follows: 
in camp there is only one enemy -- the Soviet regime. Everyone 
considers himself equally victimized and outcast. This was especially 
so, of course, in the Stalin period. I saw the most unbelievable 
friendly companies, where two Jews, former inmates of German 
concentration camps, were on amiable and intimate terms and ate 
together with two former SS-men and with one Frenchman, who turned 
up by chance in camp. They were bosom friends. In camp the situation 
was such that if there was a necessity to clear up some problem, 
it would always be possible to ask the appropriate expert. For 
example, say you are interested in the situation in German 
concentration camps, haw Jews were treated there by the Germans.

You immediately call an appropriate Jew, who you know had been there, 
and a German, and a discussion ensues. If you do not know how 
guards in the concentration camps treated people, then you call 
some former SS-man who had served as a guard, and, in a completely 
friendly manner, while sipping tea, they sit down together and thrash 
out this matter. There is almost no animosity. They criticize, 
but do not hate, amtanother. For example, almost everyone agreed 
that the policies of, let us say, Germany during the war and 
particularly of Hitler, himself, had been wrong, but no one sees 
an evil design. A man's prestige rises in proportion to the extent 
that he has damaged the Soviet Union. The more he has done this, 
the more authority he enjoys in camp. There is, of course, no 
national antagonism or enmity. The only clash that may occur is in 
personal interests. For example, there were several Afghans there 
who built themselves a musical instrument right in the barracks 
and for hours on end would strum plaintive melodies on it. This, 
of course, acts somewhat upon the nerves. Sometimes a clash would 
occur, for example, if someone wanted to read while others wanted 
to sleep and put out the light. There are these thingsabut national 
discord, as such, does not exist. It must be said that the 
representatives of the various nationalities who have been in camps 
inspired one another with deep respect, and a cultural influence 
was even notable. I, for example, saw with my own eyes many 
Germans studying Russian and learning a great many things of which 
they had previously been unaware. 
1 the same thing 
was true with the Russians and Ukrainians. A cultured person who 
wished to occupy himself in something in camp could always engage 
in anything he wished, even in the study of Chinese. I worked 
together with Koreans and knew a German who studied Korean diligently 
for a year and, I believe, learned it rather well.

general impressions concerning feelings in the 
concentration camps of the Soviet Union. 
In the first place, my feelings and my impressions concerning 
concentration camps of the Soviet Union are purely subjectitre, because 
I was in two Camp systems altogether; specifically, in two systems 
of strictly regimented camps, first in Vorkuta in the so-called 
oSs? 
systemkregimented camps of the river camp, and then in Mordoviya 
near the station of Porma [?] in the system of the strictly regimented 
camps of the so-called Dubravnyy [?] MVD Camp. 
The general impressions and feelings in the camps now can be 
described by one word: disillusionment. After the death of the head 
of the government of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, everyone 
instinctively felt that the entire Soviet nation would be faced with 
very important and) in the present circumstance, perfectly unavoidable, 
a 
reforms. These reforms were to have unvoidably affected the camps, 
A 
especially since rumors had been circulating that within the Soviet 
government there were many who were highly dissatisfied with the 
state of affairs of these vast masses of prisoners. And indeed, the 
first thing that occurred was an amnesty for prisoners, the so-called 
common criminals, that is, persons convicted for [non-political] 
criminal offences. Then followed a reform of amnesty of Article 58; 
namely, of persons sentenced up to three years according to Article 58; 
nothing was given to anyone, since the number of such people was 
quite negigible, perhaps even less, let us say, than one percent, or 
about one person in one thousand [sic], because under Article 58, as 
a rule, a sentence of less than 10 years is never given. Then further 
relaxations ensued. The regimen was eased. Then occurred the release 
from the camp of so-called juveniles; that is, persons convicted under 
Article 58 when they were under 21 years of age; that is, when they

had not yet attained their legal majority. A certain number of people 
fell under this category, but only a portion of them were sent home, 
in spite of the fact that the ukase said that all of them had to be 
sent hame; such was the order of the Soviet government. Many of them 
were sent to the East, to exile in Krasnoyarskiy Kray, and in regard 
to this it was said quite clearly that this was arbitrariness on the 
part of the lower, local4camp administration. Then followed further 
indulgences in the camps, in particular the amnesty or release of invalids; 
that is, disabled persons. Medical examinations, called "kontsovkin 
in the camp language, took place. The intention_of the administration 
was clearly manifested: to limit the number of invalids;. A number 
of totally disabled persons, who obviously, theist if everything had 
proceeded in accordance with the law, had the right to be invalids and 
who could have been sent home, were not recognized as invalids ? The 
case was even more complicated with the invalids than :with the persons 
who had been amnestied previously; and indeed, same invalids were 
not allowed to return home at all. This happened in instances where 
the family or rayon refused to accept the invalids as such. They 
were then sent to so-called invalid homes, which were nothing but 
the very same barracks or building put up  comparatively well. 
A resident of an invalid home has the right to move approximately to 
the rayon of the given village. There they live in common roams; that 
is, so to speak, the same as barracks; they do not have their own rooms, 
but it is, of course, better than in the camp. Generally speaking, 
the invalid home, because of its mild features, represents a golden 
cage. Of course, it does not suit the majority of people, because 
everyone wantsf,to have Axil freedom, or at least to live with his own 
family. The war invalids as such had already been sent to the East,

namely to Krasnoyarskiy Kray or even to the virgin lands, in spite of 
the fact that they had protested in the summer. Here the administration 
of the given camp system was usually the deciding authority, and the 
invalids being released felt quite clearly that they essentially were 
being subjected to arbitrary rule; that is, that anything could be 
done with them. It is perfectly inexplicable why same were sent home 
to their place of residence or to their own family, and othercwere 
sent elsewhere. ladle the initial period of the new government was 
linked with great expectations, and everyone said that things could 
not be worse than they had been under the government of Stalin ? 
especially did spirits rise after the exposure of the Beriya plot ? 
all these reforms, which embraced a very small number of persons and 
which, moreover, were carried out quite disgracefully, even from the 
organizational and bureaucratic point of view -- all these reforms 
led to the greatest disillusionment Tar all the prisoners in the 
camps. All things considered, not more than 10 perr'cent of the camp 
inmates were affected by these reforms of Article 58. It is true that 
a rather large number of people were released from the camps; these 
were people who had been arrested approximately in the period of 1943, 
1944, and 1945; that is, when the Soviet Army advanced after the 
sudden change on the front and after the Stalingrad victory. These 
people, as a rule, had not received more than 10 years, and in about 
'54 and '55 they finished their sentences and went their normal way, 
namely, Krasnoyarskiy Kray, and part of them went to Irkutsk.... 
to eastern Kazakhstan, or finally to the regions of the virgin and 
unfallowed lands. As for the current condition in the camps, in 
regard to the Fall of 1554 
one should note a quite distinct tendency of extremely deep disappointment. 
Morale had distinctly fallen. No one counts on anything anymore. In 
September, 1955, a further reform took lace, namels the amnesty of

prisoners who had collaborated with the German authorities or with 
the allies of so-called Fascist Germany during the [second] world 
war; that is, from 1941 to 1945. The convictions of all of these 
persons were to be revoked with the exception of certain paragraphs 
of Article 58, namely: 58-8, that is, terror. If I am not 
mistaken, it seems to be under both the paragraph of diversion and 
paragraph 13. Strange as it may seem, it is under the sixth paragraph, 
which,isvIthink, the most severe; but in this whole ukase of the 
Supreme Soviet the stipulation is made that the persons who were 
implicated or had personally taken part or done something in respect 
to the abuse and torture of Soviet citizens, are not subject to the 
reform. It is perfectly well-known to everyone however, that in 
regard to every person who had collaborated with the Germans, that is, 
who had worked either in German organs of civil administration, in 
organs of the police administration4or finally with the German Army, 
they usually write in any investigation that he had insulted someone, 
struck someone, or put someone in prison. And this is interpretable: 
ar4 
expressly as torture of Soviet citizens. The people whoAcompletely

Nevertheless there is disillusionment in the camps; everyone sees that

maximum figure cited to me for people in the camps was 42 million 
persons; the minimum, 25 million. I never heard less than the latter 
nor more than the former figures. . 
These figures were cited to me by all camp inmates and prisoners 
of the most diverse views, from people who, despite their confinement, 
still considered themselves supporters of the Communist regime to 
the so-called hardened Fascists, who considered themselves sworn and 
implacable foes of the Soviet regime. 
It is also said that during this period prior to 1955 the number 
of persons arrested under Article 58 fell sharply. The great wave 
of arrests surged throughout the country only after the downfall 
of Beriya and of his, so to speak, supporters. The number of persons . 
executed, was estimated at several hundred, and the number of persons 
arrested, allegedly numbering 5000 to 7000, were placed in special 
camps. Not a single supporter of Beriya, that is, a person arrested 
in connection with the Beriya ease, has been, discovered either in the 
general camps, in the exile settlements, or in the closed prisons. 
They are kept somewhere in special places. These people simply do not 
appear. Moreover, according to certain information, a whole network 
of new camps is springing up, namely in the extreme north of Siberia, 
on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. This conforms fully with the Soviet 
camp system; it is a known fact that from the very inception of the 
Soviet government, the camps have been continuously advancing toward 
the north. While camps were established in Korea, for example, or in 
the Solovkas 25 years ago there are no camps there now. In the last 
15 to 20 years camps have begun to spring up in Vorkuta. Already 
the Vorkuta camp system and the whole northern, central, and southern

of outdated camps. The land has already been conquered, and according 
to unconfirmed rumors, it is true, subsequent new camps are springing 
up in northern Siberia, mainly along the coast of the Arctic Ocean, 
in the Vrangell Islands, in the Novosibirsk Islands, etc. It is 
vigorously stated that not only are prisoners convicted according to 
Article 58, being brought here but also common criminals, that is, the 
so-called camp "blatnyy" element, people who have long been accustomed 
to camps and continue to carry on criminal activities in the camps. 
Question: Of the prisoners wham you have met, do a large percentage 
of those convicted under Article 58 consider themselves enemies of the 
present regime? 
As a rule, almost all of them consider themselves enemies of the 
present regime in some form or another. There are very few people 
convicted under Article 58 who still consider themselves supporters 
of the present regime and who believe that, as they say, a legal 
or organizational error had simply occurred. The number of such 
people is insignificantly small. Usually they are former members of 
the party and many of them are among those who were let us say, unjustly 
arrested by individuals who today have been exposed by the Soviet 
regime, namely Beriya and Abakumov. Did you not haze occasion to 
meet one or two persons convicted in the so-called Leningrad case, 
who later were rehabilitated? Yes, that is quite true. These people, 
as before, remained loyal to the Soviet regime. There are many people, 
it is true, who harbor a grudge and pretend in camp to be Soviet 
patriots, hoping to improve their condition. But insofar as we are 
speaking of genuine feelings, certainly the shortcomings, negative 
qualities, and the essence of the Soviet regime are completely clear 
to them,,

Question: What approximate percentage do the political prisoners 
constitute in the Soviet concentration camps? 
Political ciminals, if the general mass of all prisoners is taken, 
that is, of all those people in the camps, including the strictly 
regimented, the not strictly regimented, and the concentration camps, 
that is, if the total range of all the people is taken, from the most 
severe to the most lenient regimes, then we must estimate an approximate 
percentage of 50 to 60 percent, or, one might say, one-half. 
Approximately 40 percent belong to those convicted under the ordinary 
articles, which, however, may very easily be added in with Article 
58, because in the Soviet Union a violation of the criminal laws is 
also a special type of ant nf ar-essinn against the Soviet government. 
It should be mentioned that the most common criminals wham I met in 
the exile settlements, that is, the clearly criminal element, for 
example, thieves murderers, housebreakers and burglars - all say 
frankly that the Soviet government does not let them alone. "It took 
everything from me; my father was a victim of the collectiviation 
program, and I have no other way or possibility of fighting the Soviet 
regime. They took everything from me, and I am going to take what I 
can from them." That, in general, is the theme of those convicted 
under the ordinary articles. It is true that there are certain others 
among them who say that it makes no difference to us what sort of government 
prevails. Any government will imprison us, and of course we will 
not stop engaging in cripinal offences under any government. 
But those, generally speaking, are in the minority. The majority 
of criminal offenders believe that they fell beneath the wheel of 
criminal elements of the regime and that none of them would have been 
a thief or a criminal, and would not be serving time if the situation 
in the country were not completely abnormal.

QActstiog: Did you meet any in the camps who had been convicted 
preseht 
for active opposition to the emboirimg regime, opposition of a 
political nature? 
Unquestionably. It is, of course, rather difficult to answer 
this question, because first we must agree upon what is meant by 
"active opposition". In the period of the dictatorship of Stalin,Lit 
was enough to have spoken a few words about some person, or simply to 
displease someone or merely to allow oneself some trick against a 
high4p, and one was convicted under Article 58. And this, from the 
point of view of the Soviet regime, was considered active opposition. 
Nevertheless, these people cannotjof course, be considered direct 
convicts; they simply fell under the wheel of the political machine.

But there are other individuals; for example, in the camps there is a 
very numerous element of, first of all, those who collaborated during 
World War II with the German authorities. The majority of these people 
collaborated Completely from the ideological point of view and not at 
all from considerations of personal or material advantages, so much the 
more so since personal and material advantage was very insignificant. 
A large number of people after the end of the war began to oppose the 
Soviet regime ideologically. Strange as it seems, these often were 
people who were Soviet soldiers and officers during World War II, i.e., 
they had quite sincerely defended their homeland, i.e., they considered 
it their primary duty to defeat the external enemy in order that the 
Russian state as suchh e preserved in general, even the red dictatorship 
of Stalin. Then they proceeded to fulfill their next aspirations and 
desires, namely, to achieve domestic reforms and modifications of those 
reforms which the Soviet regime had so generously promised during the 
World War. Strangely enough, I had occag:ion,: to meet people who had 
received the highest orders and awards, Soviet soldiers and officers who 
literally had reached Berlin triumphantly. 
QUESTION: Were there many Soviet army servicemen? 
Very many. The percentage of servicemen during the World War II 
period was extremely high. The number of regular army soldiers and 
officers was, strange as it seems, particularly large. It was these 
regulars, i.e., individuals on whom lay the general burden of World War II, 
who saw that victory had not brought the people liberation or fulfillment 
of their hopes, who believed that these were different times, began to 
protest in one way or another, and sometimes simply resorted to openly 
tactics,

After the war, the Soviet Union was covered with a large number of

regard to conspiratory and revolutionary matters, were not up to par, 
i.e., they were established by inexperienced people and very frequently 
failed. It is absolutely necessary to mention the sharp and deep 
antagonism remaining to this day within the regular army, and among the 
police organs, i.e., the MOB organs, Ministry of State Security, and 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. I know a considerable number of anecdotes, 
for example, of a:.certain lieutenant colonel who was4herrepairing 
machine authorized for the operations of a certain motorized corps and 
despite his high rank as commander of this corps, was literally scolded 
half-jokingly in his office for repairing his own machine. When he 
said, "I beg your pardon, but the order was given and signed by you; I 
cannot help but repair its" Using some strong expressionsjthe other said, 
"Don't you know what to do in such a case? Simply say that no spare 
parts are available and nothing can be repaired. Let it be repaired as 
you wish. Now we must obtain spare parts." 
Such occurences are very frequent. The army is not very fond of 
the police apparatus. This is evident in the entire regular army. 
QUESTION: Did you have instances of personal encounters with leaders of 
the various anti-Soviet organizations created after the war 
in the Soviet Union? 
First, I should like to say a few words about organizations going 
under the all-Russian flag, i.e., of Russian organizations. When I went 
to Vorkuta in 1950, a group of students of Moscow State University imeni 
Lomonosov went with me. This group consisted of young demobilized of-
ficers. There were a few soldiers. They had formed a small counter-
revolutionary group without even a special name, with a very simple 
objective: to overthrow the Soviet regime. They no longer considered 
themselves Marxists. They wanted the conversion of the Soviet Union into 
a national state.

QUESTION: Overthrow it by what means? 
By revolutionary and combat means. This was a purely conspirative 
military group with all the attributes and characteristic features of 
such. Unfortunately it did not have adequate skill in regard to con-
spiracy. Finally, a traitor was found. Everyone received 25 years each 
and departed. 
QUESTION: Was this group large? 
I saw a few of them. As far as I know this group contained a few 
dozen men. Generally, there were a great many such groups. One thing 
in general was evident after the war: this was an ideological recoil 
and departure of Soviet academic youth from under the influence of the 
Communist Party. The rising academic generation has broken away or is 
attempting to break away from Marxism. This is especially strong among 
students of the philosophy faculties. 
QUESTION: And what are their ideological aims? 
These aims, it is necessary to say, are rather hazy. It is very 
difficult to speak of a developed ideology, So much the more so since 
I found them in the exile settlements in very difficult straits. But 
they all had one aspiration: the preservation of the unity of the 
Soviet Union, but on democratic principles, in order that the people 
might really have a genuine opportunity to govern themselves and to take 
some part in the government; transition to a lawful state; andIfinsi% 
the introduction of a number of reforms. Despite all differences, every-
thing narrows down to aim: the liquidation of the kolkhoz system, which 
1"06t 
they consider us the basic evil of the Soviet State; and second to get 
A 
rid, finally, of state capitalism in the economic field, i.e. to give 
an opportunity to private initiative, within limits, of course.

In regard to the concentration camps, they all, naturally, atm at com-
plete liquidation of the latter. They feel that the concentration camps 
may be retained for a certain time only for the strongly pronounced 
criminal element. In the Soviet Union, unfortunately, this element, 
which is in no way reeducatable, is absolutely enormous. There is a 
vast number of professional criminals whom it is simply impossible to 
set free. As for the conviction, as a matter of principle, of all 
political enemies, all these individuals were opposed to it. It must be 
stated, of course, that in the Soviet Union there exist small opposition 
and even revolutionary groups which still have not broken with Marxism. 
These groups are encountered chiefly in student circles. 
QUESTION: Of which cities? 
In Moscow, in Leningrad, and in university towns of Siberia. To 
my personal knowledge, there are less of them in the Ukraine, where 
other groupings prevail. These people have not yet broken with Marxism. 
They believe that the world actually is progressing according to the 
Marxist theory, that the laws of changing formations, which Marx dis-
covered, are unshakable and correct, and that Lenin carried out the 
correct policy, but with his death the predatory lawless Stalin regime 
distorted this line, and therefore, the entire task consisted in return-
ing to the Leninist course. It is true that they have certain doubts. 
They do not picture Marxism at all as it is officially interpreted in 
the Soviet Union. Besides these small groups there are innumerable groups 
which have definitely broken with Marxism. This element is the most 
literate and most intellectual youth, often of the philosophy faculties, 
which simply had formally completed a course in logic, and from the 
point of view of logical construction and preparation, had proceeded to 
a criticism of Marx. It saw that what was written in this allegedly 
not 
unshakable doctrine not only wasebsolutely correct, and was not an unshakable

law, but often contradicted the most common elementary human logic. 
A criticism of Marxism developed in them. It is true their own ideologi-
cal equipment is weak, because it is very difficult in the Soviet Union 
to fashion an ideology. It is impossible to print or write anything or 
to publish a single printed work in which the ideology of a given group 
is set forth. Nevertheless such clandestine works exist, and, as I was 
told, not only political ones. There allegedly exists unprinted in the 
Soviet Union a considerable amount of fictional literature, quite fre-
quently by young authors, which simply cannot be printed because no 
publishing house will accept it. They go into the hands of [word 
illegible].., or simply they are kept hidden. There are a considerable 
number of unpublished poets, for example, who are far more talented 
then the official Soviet luminaries, not excluding Konstantin Simonov and 
others. The same situation prevails with political ideology. Neverthe-
less, the ideological equipment of all of these small groups is rather 
weak. These groups are usually transitory. They are broken up, con-
vitted)and sent away to camps. But in spite of this, it must be said, 
they are not discouraged. The morale of all of them, especially the 
youth, is exceptionally cheerful and optimistic. They all believe that 
they will not be in confinement for long and during interrogations and 
under questioning they act very heroically and far more sta+ly than the 
so-called older generation. 
QUESTION: What is the attitude of both these imprisoned groups and the 
general mass of prisoners toward the idea of revolution and 
forcible overthrow of the present regime? 
Youth and anti-Soviet groupings which do not belong to the category 
of those sailing under the Marxist flag believe that the overthrow of 
the Soviet regime can be accomplished only by means of force. They do 
not believe either in evolution or in gradual change. They know Soviet

reality too well for this. Concerning Leninists, the Leninists often, 
I shall not undertake to state a general... they still believe in the 
possibility of preserving the Soviet regime and in particular in the 
possibility of reforms and evolutionary change. They frequently lay 
emphasis upon certain circles in the top echelon, inume of the Soviet 
government, base themselves sometimes on Marshal Zhukov, sometimes on 
Molotov, some3times on someone else, believing that these people will 
begin from above to effect a change in the Soviet regime in the direction 
necessary for them. As for those groups which have broken with Marxism, 
they generally take a sober view of things and they do not in any event 
count upon any help from above. 
QUESTION: Did you or your friends encounter anti-Soviet literature the:1-e 
in the concentration camps? 
No. 
QUESTION: [How about] lists of any kind, leaflets, proclamations? 
I heard of them, but I did not personally see any. I saw one man 
who told me rather vaguely that -- this was in 1954, approximately one 
year before, that is, about in 19531?he had come across an anti-Soviet 
leaflet. He was at that time still free. He was lying sick in the 
hospital. Exactly what was in the leaflet, he was unable to tell me. 
But doubtlessly such leaflets turn up, although in rather smell numbers. 
However, I cannot say, for the Soviet people are very secretive and very 
disciplined in this regard; so I cannot say anything here. 
QUESTION: What do you know of uprisings in the concentration camps of 
Vorkuta, Nori1's17nd. other places? What do they say about 
this in the camps?

I was suddenly taken to an "etap" [halting-place], and I thought 
I was going to an interrogation in Moscow; but I turned up here in the 
Mordovskaya system of camps of the river camp. Then soon after this 
came the death of Stalin. And after this there was a very misambritUipt. 
atmosphere in the camp. It is necessary to say that during 1951-52 the 
situation in the camps in Vorkuta, as everywhere in general, became 
very much worse. Not only labor camp prisoners, who always wore numbers, 
but also ZIC [7] prisoners, who previously had worn the designation of 
the given camp system) --for example, as a prisoner of the MVD river 
camp in Vorkuta, I wore a letter "R" [in Russian,"Pn] approximately ten 
centimeters in size on my left sleeve -- received numbers. This of 
course strongly embittered and discouraged everybody. They began to 
e 
revert to what had been changed in about 44-45-46, namely, to lock up 
the barracks. Naturally, this was a terrible thing. The barracks were 
overcrowded with people and, as a rule, there is no bathroom in the 
barracks. To satisfy physical needs, a chamber-pot box is installed. 
There was a stench in the camp and ih:general this was a dondition which 
weighed terribly against the everyday life of the prisoners. It was 
forbidden, when the barracks were unlocked, [-to go] from one barracks to 
another, a restriction which, of course, strongly embittered the prisoners. 
All of these things brought about the isiandiftsui atmosphere in the camps. 
Later, of course, the camp administration permitted itself a number of 
other measures, and at this time,,beginning with 1951, wages for labor 
had been introduced, but they started to act very arbitrarily with the 
payments, i.e., they raised the norm so that in essence you earn and 
work but get nothing to show for it. Then, about 1953, as far as I 
know from eye-witnesses, a wave of uprisings broke out in Vorkuta and 
other places throughout the north. Properly speaking, the uprisings 
had not been prepared. The aim was only to demand that the [camp iciiic11411111117621)

the prisoners to live as genuine human beings and that the letter of 
the law be Observed. In view of the protest they at first stopped 
going to work; they formed committees, called in camp jargon, "po-
khoroshemu" ["in a friendly way"], and wanted to talk with the admin-
istration. They began to request that representatives be sent from 
Moscow. The camp authorities at first became frightened; they tried to 
act as always by deception; by persuasion: "go to work," "don't worry", 
"disperse", "surrender the instigators and all the rest of you will be 
satisfied." Having already been tricked many times, the prisoners did 
not believe this. They ceased work and the mines actually stopped. 
Then reprisals began to be applied. A large number of mines were sur-
rounded by troops. Machine guns and mortars were set up; in particular, 
such was the case at Mine 29... They opened fire. The total number 
killed in the northern part of European Russia who perished in the camps 
during this uprising is computed at 1500-2000 men. Approximately two 
or three times as many were wounded. The usual measures for suppression 
were applied beginning with shooting and ending in one camp, if I am not 
mistaken, in Campl6 of the MVD river camp in Vorkuta. The camp was sur-
rounded by a cordon of troops, about two battalions. There was no 
shooting; they suddenly cut the wire and from all sides stormed into the 
camp armed with hard objects and butt-stocks; i.e., they were armed but 
did not shoot, only beat up the prisoners unmercifully. Nearby was 
J-tr" 
located the camping common criminals; those sentenced for criminal [i.e., 
non-political] crimes. They all went to the fence and watched what was 
happening. Then the Article 58 prisoners shouted, 'What is the matter 
with you scoundrels?"T-with stronger expressions ,?"they beat us and you 
watch?" The common criminals broke the fence, overturned it, burst into 
the camp, and attacked the wounded soldiers. Several scores of soldiers

were wounded so that the battle ended not at all successfully for the 
troops, because shooting was apparently forbidden. In other camps as a 
result of such slaughters, very many people were killed. Because of 
the butt-stocks people remained with broken bones and broken skulls. 
After this it is necessary to tell of reprisals. Many people were 
sent to penal camps and other places. Where they are is not precisely 
known. Many were sent to-closed prisons. A small percentage was ex-
ecuted, the so-called instigators. 
QUESTION: Do you know of a repetition of the uprisings and disturbances 
in the camp system in 1954 and 1955? 
Yes, disturbances have been going on since then, flaring up periodically 
in different places. They ended in Vorkuta; later uprisings took place 
in camps of the so-called.., although they were less intensive, and 
generally throughout the entire system of regimented camps and even the 
unregimented ones located along this very Vorkuta-Kirov railroad magistral 
in the so-called Komi ASSR, which is full of camp systems. These up-
risings occurred also in Siberia, in the north. One Lettish physician, 
after his release told about them. These uprisings occurred in the 
North, If I am not mistaken, of the Obskaya Guba [Bay], in the north of 
the Yenisey, even further beyond the Artie Circle than Vorkuta. There 
also was shooting here and many were killed. The authorities effected 
a number of reforms: numerals were abolished, the practice of locking 
the barracks was discontinued, prisoners were permitted outside the 
limits of the camp, a system of so-called "bezkonvoyniki" [unescorted 
prisoners] which had existed earlier in broader form, was instituted; 
their number was increased, and many prisoners were simply granted the 
privilege of living outside the limits of the camp, merely showing up 
to register, if I am not mistaken, at a police station or designated

place; i.e., the authorities exhibited a tendency toward distinctly 
placating the prisoners. Since that time. uprisings in the camps have 
not ended but go on incessantly. The most recent uprisings of which I 
heard were in the summer of 1955, about May and June. I witnessed one 
somewhere in Siberia and another in the northern part of the Komi ASSR. 
On what scale, I cannot say exactly, because the number of people who 
had arrived from outside into the camps where I was, as very large. 
But in any case, uprisings occur uontinuously. 
QUESTION: Please tell us of the hierarchial system which exists in the 
concentration camps. You mentioned prisoners of the Ts. K. 
[Central Committee?). Haw do they differ, and in general, 
how is the administrative system as well as the distribution 
of prisoners according to the articles of the criminal code 
tandjorganized,lin general what is the system of these.... 
? As it is known, the Soviet Union is a nation of camps. The system 
is extremely large. In the first place, there are three [sic] categories 
of camps: regimented camps and unregimented camps. People sentenced 
under Article 58 for longer than a certain term, longer than ten years, 
go?as a rule,to the so-called regimented camps. There the routine is 
more strict. If a certain prisoner had made some slip, then he goes to 
the so-called double-regimented camp. There the routine is still stricter, 
with a large number of other drawbacks for the prisoner. If the prisoner 
in som.sPay here) too... for example, con nit some murder or periodically 
violates camp discipline and especially indulges in acts of violence [word 
illegible] upon prisoners but upon the camp administrative staff, then 
he may land in the so-called penal chain gangs. Such camps exist where 
prisoners go around all day long in shackles and upon whose personnel 
files appears the notation: "in case of slightest infraction, execute."

I personally saw one such prisoner upon whose file this appeared. He 
saw it himself. He succeeded in getting out of it. Camps exist which 
are enveloped in complete silence. People sent to these camps do not 
have the right to correspond; they are simply crossed out of life. 
Materially, they do not live very badly in these camps, I believe. 
However, they do not work. These are small camps containing usually a 
few hundred men, but not more than 500. Where they are located, no one 
knows, for, while people serve time there, hardly anyone ever comes back. 
Then in another direction: from regimented camps it is possible to 
transfer to the unregimented. In a non-regimented camp, discilline is 
considerably more lax. Seeing relatives is permitted, i.e., your wife 
can come to visit you, and you can live with her for a certain period 
of time if you have been fulfilling the norms and are generally on 
good terms with the camp administration in regard to discipline. 
In such camps a special little house is built, the so-called "hotel" 
or "guest house." Of course, there are many other, unprintable, 
names [for it; in the camp. Some of them are not badly laid out, 
with tiny, separate cabins. Others, on the contrary, are very poorly 
laid out, where you and your wife have to live under the eyes of five 
or six other couples, which, of course, is very difficult and very 
unpleasant. Then there are camps with lax regimens. In these camps 
there is a very large percentage of so-called "bezkonvoynyye"

number on their backs, caps, and right knees, which they are never 
allowed to remove. I know of a case of a convict--a certain sick 
convict traveled with me--who was being treated in connection with 
his obviously poor state of health and had arrived with me in the 
Mordovian system of camps of the Dubrava camp. Simply to amuse me, 
he threw his cap with the number on the front, out of the train; 
and in two days the cap was delivered to him in Gorkiy It had 
been found and picked up. His identity was traced through the number, 
and the cap was brought to him; the name of convict so-and-so had 
already been recorded, so that everything was done in order 
the possible escape of prisoners. I 'Would not have believee this, 
but I saw it with my own eyes. 
QUESTION: How were the prisoners classified socially? 
In regard to classes....It must be said that if we take the camp 
system as a state within a state in the Soviet Union, then the pro-
portion of intellectuals in the camp is higher than on the outside. 
It is especially high, of course, in the labor and regimentee camps, 
i.e. in the stricter camps, excluding, of course, the chain-gangs, 
where only criminals land, so it is very high. Thus, the more severe 
the penalty and the stricter the camp, the higher the number of intel-
lectuals. Especially irreconcilable intellectuals, who had actually 
been involved in large scale crimes (political) or actual leaders of 
political parties are not sent to a camp but are kept in closed prisons 
or solitary confinement, if these are Soviet people. It is known, for 
example, that Sulinskiy and many others are in solitary confinement, 
but some are treated with special strictness--this is little known to 
anyone there--they are locked up in psychiatric hospitals. There are 
two of the latter: the psychiatric prison hospital in the city of 
Kazan', and a similar one in Kiev. As far as I know, these are the 
only two in the ertire USSR. Here are sent political offenders who

who had been there; there had not been a single common criminal 
there, only political ones, and among the latter only the importantal*S. 
The mentally-ill political prisoners of minor importance are kept in 
the hospitals which exist in every camp system. The important people 
are confined in Kiev and Kazan', especially Kazan'.The former presi-
dent of the Estonian republic, now probably dead, once was imprisoned 
there. Unfortunately, I have forgotten his name. Several Japanese 
generals, perfectly normal people, were confined there, I know; so 
were some German professors and in general people whom the Soviet 
regime considered important. 
QUESTION: Are these people perfectly normal who are sent special]y to 
the psychiatric hospitals?

If a person mmilmonlbomiimmeemt here, he can be sent simply to hide

very nervous strte; therefore, grounds practically always exist. In 
Moscow there is the so-called Institute imeni Serbskiy, to which all 
prisoners suspected of mental disease were sent for what is called in 
camp jargon, "komisovka," or simply a medical examination. Ordinarily 
the following Solomon's decision is made: "sick, but responsible for 
his own acts," i.e., if necessary, he can be placed in a psychiatric 
hospital as a sick person, but he is to answer for his own actions. I

months, who had been in Kazan', and he related all this to me in detail.

leaves less than two years after his arrival. And it is necessary to 
say that a considerable number of prisoners, who were not mentally ill, 
virtually became so when they landed here. Everyone knows what it means 
for a sane person and what happens to him to be in the company of the 
mentally ill. In 1949 I served time in the Yegimented Lefortovskaya 
prison in Moscow in cell 72 with a certain German Professor Schueleinern. 
He had earlier been inVolved in some kind of Bavarian separatist under-
taking. In addition, he was a half-Jew, and after a long odyssey he 
tht 
crossed over to e Soviet demarcation zone in Poland in 1940. He received 
eight years for illegally crossing the border, and despite the fact that 
he openly announced that he was a half-Jew and that he had been oppressed 
by the Hitler regime and was comfng over as a refugee, he was sent to 
Pechora, and something happene to his nerves. So he was sent to the 
psychiatric hospital in Kazan', where he spent the entire war between 
the Soviet Union and Germany; in 1949 he arrived in Moscow for the 
solution and investigation, i.e. reinvestigation, of certain problems. 
He told me of thfs most dreadful institution in which a large number 
of sane prisoners go out of their minds. In particular, there was a 
tendency there to place the sane ahd insane together. Even this 
professor Schueler [sic] had himself been in a difficult situation. 
He related a case he knew of some individuals who had lost their minds 
in this hospital. In this hospital, it is true, there is one privilege; 
everyone there has the right to say what he thinks. It is possIble 
there, for example, to deliver anti-Soviet ledtures. A man who is 
mentally ill is for that reason not liable to any punishment or 
repressions. True, a definite feature is introduced into the appropriate 
statements, according to which it follows that it is still impossible 
to discharge a certain person. There are occasional instances of persons 
being released from the hospital, but they are very rare. The death rate 
there is comparatively high, despite the fact that material conditions

are not bad. People are kept there whom for some reason it is necessary 
to hide. 
As for the system of closed prisons, rumors came into the camp that 
beginning in 1950 intensive construction of closed prisons took place 
throughout the Soviet Union. A great many of these were put up. The 
following individuals are kept in closed prisons: the most important 
political criminals, ideologically dangerous; leaders of anti-Soviet 
groupinFs and parties are usually kept permanently in central prisons 
right in Moscow, later in the so-called "Big House on the Mokhovayan 
Atreet7, and in others. There they live until they end their earthly 
txistence,fb; to live a long time in a closed prison, even if so-called 
"good conditioneare created for you, is beyond human power. It is much 
harder than the camps. People of minor imrortance are nct kept in 
central prisons; they are sent to closed prisons. Especially veil-
known among closed prisons is (1) the former Aleksandrovskiy central in 
Irkutsk; (2)the Vladimirovskaya prison; (3) the Tambovskaya prison; and 
several others. Also sent to the closed prisons are people who had 
committed serious crimes, i.e. a man commits4camp crime.;, not of a 
mihor category, such as, let us say, absence from work or breach of 
discipline, but he commits a camp murder. At the present time the penalty 
for camp murder, pursuant to the ukaze of 16 January 1953, is supposed 
to be, as for any murder,execution. Rarely, however, do executions for 
the murder of a camp prisoner take place. Sometimes executions are 
reported over the radio as a warning to prisoners, but anyone aware of 
ho,.' many murders are committedAcamps knows that about ten percent, no 
P"4* 
more, are executed; and the remainder are sent for a certainhtime to 
closed prisons. The term is from one to five years. There are three 
categories in the closed prisons: One is kept in solitary confinement 
and is not sent out to work. This is most oppressive and terrible. One 
or two years is t,sually quite enough to break the physical or mental

of those who are kept in a solitary confinement cell but who go out to 
a A1410 
work. The third and final category of prisoners i ose who live in 
common cells and who go out to work. 
Besides closed prisons there also exist prisons for special 
prisoners. For example, in the Soviet Unior there is a large number 
of servicemen not of the Soviet army, for instance, military personnel 
of the American army who had been serving in Germany and were abducted 
from here; also British and French. Almost no one ever sees these 
people anywhere. There are many rumors that they are in the interroga?
tion prison at the Lyubyanka. One has been in a cell with someone; then 
his case has ended, and the man completely disappears. He should have 
landed in a camp, but he goes to another place somewhere. It is suspec?
ted that there are some special prisons for such abducted individuals 
and for unabducted foreigners. 
QUESTION: Did you meet any Russians or Ukrainians from the Soviet Union 
who had been abducted here after the war?  
Personally, I did not mert such people, if my memory does not

right now, frankly speaking, I cannot remember. 
QUESTION: What do you think of the use in the future of concentration 
camps as a kind of base for an armed uprising for revolution? 
The concentration: camps are, of course, the Achilles' heel of the 
Soviet regime. The representatives themselves agree in this. Because, 
of course, this is an attempt to diminish the volume of concentration 
camps, it is determ'ned by two factors: (1) The economic unfeasibility 
of concentration camps; despite the fact that many people believe that 
this is a cheap labor power, 41.11 there is a considerable number of

the moment that a person has been arrested, counting workers of the

uses the million-man army of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. But 
everyone well knows that these troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
receive higher wages that the sol44rpof.the.regular army. In spite 
of this, it is a known fact that in case of war the police troops always 
exhibit very low combat efficiency; because it is one t!'ing to escort, 
guardoand watch prisonersA quite another thing, of course, to go under 
tie enemy machine guns. The Soviet soldier is well aware that where 
wwirkt 
any sort of military action is concerned, the MVD troops NW very weak 
support. In addition to this, many of them fall under the influence of 
the prisoners. Unlike the camp guards, who, as a rule, oppose and hos-
tilely troat the prisoners, the convoy guards merely say: "Behave your-
sel4Sproperly at work, do not try to escape, do not violate what it says 
in our rules, and do what you wish--we are not your enemies." I, was 
often in a position, because of the fact that I worked in a laundry, 
where those poor soldiers, for a package of makhorka or a ruble or any-
thing of small value, sometimes simply brought me something to wash, which, 
let us say, they could not get washed free, for which it was neeessary to 
pay. II of course, always fulfilled these requests and chatted with many 
of them. There was nothing hostile in their attitude toward the prisoners, 
On the contrary, they are all oppressed by their work and then even say

women of the villages is appreciable. One even expressed this in the fol-
lowing humorous sentence: "As long as I serve in the NKVD troops, I cannot 
approach a girl on any kind of a goat." That is exactly the way it was said. 
They were oppressed by their status. They sense their inferiority in 
relation to soldiers of the regular army. So it is perfectly obvious that

the event of serious military activities, it will be necessary to tighten 
up the system in the camps to such an extent and to dispatch such a huge 
number of people to guard them that a great amount of military and labor 
power will be dissipated. If, on the other hand, this is weakened, the. 
fact is clear that chaos will ensue in the camps. In time of war, I 
know this from an informed source, it is possible, of course, to expect 
a great uprising in the camps. In the camps, generally speaking, senti?
ment is very radical, and many inmates say that at the first actual

QUESTION: Does information concerning events in the Soviet Union 
penetrate into the camps? 
Undoubtedly. The vast majority of prisoners are still in 
contact with relatives. It is true, letters are subject to censorship, 
but they are written quite openly. Sometimes in the letters rather free 
remarks at the expense of the regime are permitted. It is true, not at 
the expense of the regime?this is prohibited, it is a legal offense--
but at the expense of individual representatives of the regime. For 
example, any local follower of Beriya not yet arrested is abused. Of 
course, this is not a Beriya follower but simply an ordinary Soviet 
roughneck; but it is insurance. In the camp everyone is very well in-
formed of what goes on all over the Soviet Union. They are informed 
splendidly - -even better than on the outside. 
QUESTION: What was said concerning the dismissal of galenkov? 
The dismissal of Malenkov had been expected for a long time, 
and it was said that this, properly speaking, was an act of Nikita 
Sergeyevich Khrushchev. Between them, it was alleged, were hostile 
feelings. It is true, ideas were vague concerning Who represented what 
course. Some said that this was only personal enmity or a struggle for 
power. Others, however, said that Malenkov stood on a more moderate and 
liberal dotirse. It wee also said that Malenkov was hostile to Kaganovieh, 
that he was an anti:-Semite, and that it this respect he was a great friend 
of Marshal Zhukov and many others. Speaking of the reaction to the dis-
missal of Malenkov, I must say that in the campspeople are seasoned and 
very skeptically disposed. No one believes everything entirely, and they 
say that if anything good is done for us, it is not for the sake of our 
looks or for humanity's sake, but because this is the way of things. The 
Soviet regime does not pardon anything and does not forget anything. Con-
cerning the dismissal of Malenkov, it is said only that this indicates 
first a weakness of the regime, and then that it doubtlessly makes for a 
corresponding impression abroad. This testifies at least that the dicta-
torship is beginning to crack to some degree and that the same thing that 
happened after the death of V. I. Lenin is beginning. It is undoubtedly

the developer of internal party strife. Truthfully speaking, just as little 
was expected from 214Nrim as from N1inthol4 And nothing is expected thtse 
days. Far more is expected from the West. That is, when Dr. Adenauer 
arrived, everyone said that the situation of the Germans would certainly 
improve. And when it was said that the Soviet regime had okiamdr decided 
to release all (lemons, no one believed it. 
Conditions outside the colt), of course, interest everybody, 
because to leave the camp for freedom and to begin a normal life and 
routine is, of vourse, the dream of every camp inmate. Therefore inside 
the camp conditions on the other side of the barbed wire are highly inter-
esting. The vast majority of prisoners are especially interested in the 
situation in the kolkhozes, for a large percentage of the prisoners belong 
to that class of the population which works and which worked in the kolk?
hozes prior to confinement. It should be said that after the death of 
Stalin the new government widely publicized a program for improving the 
situation in the kolkhozes. A whole series of these measures of the Soviet 
regime was drawn up and even begun to be put into operation. In particulars 
there began a period of colonizing and cultivating virgin and reclaimed 
lands. However, in spite of this, the situation in the kolkhozes remained 
absolutely unchanged. Not only does no one whthin the Soviet government 
A 
discuss or think about the liquidation of kolkhozes, but there is even a 
tendency toward the curtailment of private plots. In particular, it was 
established that somehow private plots periodically swelled, just slightly, 
of course, at the expense of the kolkhoz lands. And then extremely stern 
telegrams and circulars were sent from the centers to the local areas to 
see whether these personal plots of kolkhoz workers actually conformed to 
the dimensions which they should have had according to the law. In the 
kolkhozes the conditions, of course, did not change. It should even be 
said, on the contrary, that the situation on the food front, generally 
speaking, became worse. It was established by the Government that the food 
base of the population of the Soviet Union had not yet attained the level

25X1 
to which, properly speaking, it was supposed to correspond. For this reason, 
there was begun a whole series of campaigns for 4. increasing the producti-
vity of kolkhoz production. This was reflected by the fact that--this news 
reached the camp--the kolkhoz members had to work even harder. A large 
number of authorized representatives of all kinds were sent to the kolkhozes. 
There even appeared cartoons in the Soviet periodicals of about 20 authorized 
representatives on a truck who, after having issued a whole mass of all kinds 
of orders, are leaving the kolkhoz, and at the time are singing the well-
known song, "Live Richly, and We Will Leave for Home, for Home." In the 
kolkhozes, the situation did not change. 
As for the situation of the ordinary people in factories and 
plants, it is just the same there as in the past. Employees, and especially 
the workers, are cOnotantly harassed b- all sorts of labor watches: a 
watch in honor of the November holidays, a watch in honor of Artillery Day, 
etc. A plant worker must, in addition, work off a great deal of the timei, 
on a voluntary-compulsory basis. 
MJESTION: Didn't the people begin to act and speak somewhat more freely 
after the war? 
At the beginning, about from 1945 to 1947, the people did speak 
very freely, as, perhaps, never since the birth of the Soviet regime. But 
in 1948 there began [last three words of sentence illegible A wave of 
arrests occurred, and everyone saw that everything was as it had been in 
the past and that it was necessary to hold his tongue. After the death of 
Stalin, people began to talk again. However, today in 1955, the intention 
is evident and the tendency already exists, as it is said in camp jargon,to 
"tighten the screwy." There is no doubt that in recent times the number of 
arrested persons has again been growing. I spoke with some, and they indeed 
said that a wave of arrestsgiord illegible) as before. 
After the death of 
Stalin, people began to speak more freely, but only in a certain plane.

alive. But any criticism, of course, of measures of the government--I

it is written that criticism is suppressed and that it is not permissible 
to criticize. But by criticism is meant only the case wherelbehind the 
scenes appropriate documents are given to a person and he is told, "Here, 
you must criticize this one and that one." 
No one, of course, dares to come out personally with a genuine 
and serious criticism. The question, of course, is of self?criticism. 
They do not criticize but vituperate. That's the way things are. I know, 
for example, that a large number of officers from our camp engaged in the 
camp administration, the chief of the regime Las7 was subjectedlat 
the railroad station of the village of Yavyas near our camp, to harsh 
criticism for maltreatment of prisoners. It was said here that the Beriya 
times had not ended. In general, both prisoners and outsiders bake use 
of the name of Beriya. "Listen you, these are not Beriya times; they are 
over." A prevalent expression is "soon you will get the Order of Beriya." 
This means you will either be executed or be exiled somewhere to serve a 
sentence. Well, that is the situation. 
QUESTION: When you were returning to the Weld., were you able to meet any 
of the free people?

Yes, at the time that our train trateled for six day, we mingled 
with the people. First they told us that we on the outside of the camp were

rushed to drink and chat. The populace was not afraid to chat with us. 
Apparently there were no special injunctions. We came closer and talked. 
As we went along, badly dressed women and children approached out train 
at many stations and begged us to give them a piece of bread, since the majority 
of us were grellg supplied. The militia stood by and said nothing. The 
majority of us were supplied with articles from packages received from 
Germany. I personally was monitor of the car, and therefore all the bread 
for about 50 men was at my disposal. I consulted with my comrades about 
So, 
how mueh could be given. They said: Well, give it all: Milk; each one 
cut.; off several slices for himself. That's the way the bread was distributed,

QUESTION: Did you meet many of these begging women and children? 
Not so very many, but not too few. In any case they were 
everywhere. Poorly dressed. And everywhere the population would run 
up to sell something. 
QUESTION: How were the people dressed? 
The people are dressed rather unpresentably apples and so 
forth 5pparent1y an expression of some sort7 Id, for example, you pay them, 
let us say a ruble, they thank you sincerely. It is evident that a ruble 
has great importance for them. 
QUESTION: What do they bring out to sell on the market? 
They usually bring to the market to sell what grows on their 
private plots, or that which belongs directly in their homes, such as 
fruit. Milk I did not see. They often bring hard?boiled eggs. Milk, I, 
generally speaking, did not see in a single station. But I saw fruits, 
pears, apples, often of rather fine quality. They are usually rather 
expensive. Good apples cost five rubles a ':kilogram. This, of course, is 
very expensive. 
QUESTION: Didn't you have occasion to go into any of the Soviet stores and 
shops? 
Yes, when our train traveled around Moscow. Then I went into a 
small shop. There, generally speaking, everything sells at the usual prices. 
It is true that such articles as, for example, butter, were very qulckly 
snapped up, because customers upon whom no one counted had arrived; that is, 
a trainload of several hundred people, who were rushing to 1r up everything. 
In general, in every store in the Soviet Union, as a rule, there is always 
a shortage of something. For example, if there is butter, there is no 
sugar. If there is sugar, there is no butter, but there is a fat mixture. 
coovomly 
So, from this circumstance it would not happen apparently in a single stimme 
that there would be white bread, butter, fuel oil, fat mixture, and sugar, 
at the samb time. Such a combination occurs very rarely.

In general, the food situation, in spite of all attempts to raise 
the productivity of agriculture, is not improving. All kinds of rumors 
circulate. They say that great transports go into China and other places, 
and that great reserves are being created in case of a military clash. 
QUESTION: How do the Soviet citizens evaluate the present period of smiles, 
the "Geneve Spirit," and the period of coexistence? 
Soviet citizens are skeptical. Those who sympathize with the 
Soviet regime say: "Our leaders are doing a good job and are leading the 
Westerners by the nose." Those who do not sympathize say: "Here, fools, 
what they don't understand in the West is that they are simply being led 
by the nose and deceived." And with some fears they say: "Nevertheless, 
? 
it is clever the way our leaders are conductihg their policies. No one

old, nor the young, believes in honorable intentions. Only a few speak 
of this deception with enthusiasm, so to speak; others speak with indig?
nation or anger, depending on their political leanings. 
QUESTION: Did you have occasion en route west to meet people who wished 
to tell you something in parting? 
When our train stopped on a siding of Byelorussian Station in 
Moscow, I, with all the Germans, of course, rushed to explore Moscow. 
It is true, the leader of our train, a very humane officer, apparently of 
the regular army, who treated us very well, said: "Don't go far. At 
two o'clock the train leaves." But apparently the order had already been 
given or an agreement was reached with the administration of the station 
and with all p&lice precincts that Germans dressed in burshlag, in camp 
jackets, distinguishable from all, could be allowed-everywhere. They let 
us pass onto the platform; the people approached and chatted in German. 
Those who knew Russian spoke. Everyone expressed regret that there was 
no war, but one little old man, perhaps a little drink, declared, "Yes, 
yes, sure, he says, they are going to the West. Soon they will come with

was even a little frightened. 
After this, he disappeared.

QUESTION: What do you know of the possibility of a military clash between 
the Soviet Union and the West? 
When I was arrested and found myself in prison, in the MGB's 
so-called interior prison on Dzerzhinskiy Square or simply the Lyubanka) 
everyone in this sad pli#ht, of course, hoped for war, as a drowning man 
clutchds at a straw. For example, the mall bulbs in the ministry suddenly 
began to be painted blue. This was, of course, interpreted at: "Look, 
look, the war is starting." This was eight years ago. Subsequently, when 
seeing 
we landed in the camps, all the camp inmates, naturally,/the complete 
futility of counting on anything and of hoping for anything, counted upon 
war, especially during the lifetime of Stalin. But everyone said that

They said that great reserves of food and weapons had teen compiled in

bases were being created to which all reliable people would flee in the 
event of an enemy break-through in this area, in order to fight from 
there with the same methods with which they fought the Germans and pre-

compiled. The great constant shortage of fuel in which the kolkhozes 
found themselves was explained by the fact that everywhere througrthe 
country depots of fuel,food, am* grainand medicines were being created, 
according to an entire fixed system. Let us say the capture of some areas 
by enemy armed forces does in no way denote a loss of these areas for the 
Soviet Union. Preparation for war went on constantly. Everyone said that 
if Stalin had not died, there would have been war either by 1953 or by the 
end of l9?4, and that the Soviet Government did not want to give in and 
was going to war directly. At the same time, they spoke of a grandiose 
(word illegibls7 blow at the West. 
Now they say that the new government takes a more sober view 
of things and is of the opinion that the Soviet Union is incapable of 
waging war. It would be too dangerous. The Soviet Union realizes quite 
well that it does not have the sympathy of the great bulk of the people 
and that if war broke out, the Soviet Union would have to wage it against 
a powerful coalition. This will not be against Germany, which with 
several allies was pounced upon by the coalition of world powers. In 
this case, the Soviet Union will be surrounded on all sides by enemies. 
The only salvation for us here is the support of the population. 
QUESTION: What about China? 
The sentiment of the satellites is thonoughly defined. There 
is talk of extremely anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland. When our train 
passed through Poland, it was rather strange. Many Poles waved and 
talked of several things. The Poles were quite courteous to the Germans. 
It is necessary to say that China is not, of course, a war 
power. Secondly, two Chinese worked with me, who spoke simply; I became 
friendly with them. They were very decent people. One of them was a 
very cultured man. They said that in China all whites were disliked, 
and , in particular, the Russians, ahd that even Mao Tse-tung was not 
much of a russophile. He wants to use the Soviet Union and if a world 
revolution is to be achieved wider red banners, let the center of the 
world revolution be in Peking and in no event in Moscow.

QUESTION: What in the minds of the camp inmates was the most detestable 
feature in the Soviet Union? 
The feature most detested by the Soviet population was of course 
the fact that the entire country, speaking figuratively, was being crushed 
by the boots of the police, this terrible, all-knowing police regime, 
distrustful of everyone, evoking thereby the most colLossal hypocrisy, where 
a person was not safe from denunciations even in his own family. There was 
a famous case where a man was subjected to repression and only later did he 
find out that his own wife, who had taken offense at him forrsomething or 
for nothing, had denounced him. In general until very recently, the entire 
i.4m5 
Soviet Union was ruled by the political apparatus. No one gins the risk 
of falling out with the State Security Committee, as it has since been 
called ,following the downfall of Beriya. A large factor is the fact that 
a vast majority of the most well-known women in the Soviet Union, such as 
movie actresses, athletes, etc.) have all married high officials of the 
former Ministry of State Security. In this regard well-informed people 
living in Moscow and moving in these circles, say that not one dared to 
refuse because no one dared to quarrel with, the police apparatus. 
Police domination was the first condition hated by the people; the second, 
of course, was the fact that the people were in a state of subjugation. 
Everyone must do what he is compell4o, always necessarily bad for him. 
But all the time the sword of Damocles of some campaign is hanging over 
you. Expeditions to the virgin lands, transfers to other work--all this 
is done very politely, sometimes even in a civilized manner, frequently 
even with the observation of material interests, but done just the same. 
So go to Chukotha, go to that is, you are not free. One has to be 
clever somehow. 
In the field of economics, everyone sees that the Soviet 
Union lives worse than the West. Much worse. Reports arrived, for 
example, of the striking prosperity of West Germany. Somehow this is 
known. Where there were Germans in camps, where packages arrived, and

were partially placed on sale, at which time it was explained 4w-what a 
chocolate bar really cost in kopeks., everyone was completely astonished 
and said, "How is that?" A country which had fought the entire world for 
six years, totally devastated, transformed by us into a heap of rubble, 
suddenly after only ten years has gone so fa f as to become the richest 
state in Europe? How could this have happened? Why are we in such a 
critical economic plight? 
QUESTION: How do the prisoners regard the limit of existence (f the 
Soviet regimt7? How long do they think this will continue and what 
limiting concessions can the Soviet regime make? 
The prisoners all believe that the limit of existence of the 
Soviet regime will be a great war. That's what all the prisoners believe. 
As for concessions, they all boil down to the fact that concessions will 
be directly proportional to the pressure which will be exerted tomorrow. 
The greater the squeeze, the more they will be inclined to make concessions, 
so that if the West actually starts to exert serious pressure, the Soviet 
regime will make every concession. 
QUESTION: Is it true that in recent times there have begun to be fewer 
informers in concentration camps? And are the prisoners taking measures 
of physical action? 
The camps are always permeated with a so-called subordinate 
network of operupolnomochennyye ?perational authorized agents(?17, or 
so-called camp "Stukachi" of all ranks. Methods of physical action upon 
them always were employed and are employed now in, of course, a lesser 
degree. Execution for camp murder was introduced, but this did not stop 
seksots from being murdered, and does not stop it to this day. Of course, 
this does not occur on the same scale as, for example, 1944-5-6-7-8. As 
for their reduction, that is noticeable only in camps under special con-
ditions. In particular, in the camp where I was, there was a great num-
ber of foreigners who were being repatriated. Here theyg.e. seksoti7

the borders of the Soviet Union within a week. However, "stukach"rdid not 
disappear but still gows on. Particularly interesting, of course, are the 
attitudes of Soviet citizens in the camps and especially the preparations 
for such things as, for example, camp uprisings, escapes, etc. 
QUESTION: You mean people escape from the camps? 
They do. But not many Article 58 prisoners escape. Only those 
convicted for common offenses escape in large number, because they are 
helped by an organization of "blatnyye" [roughly "outlaws:7, embracing 
the entire Soviet Union. They have allies in every city, where they can 
find shelter. To escape without the aid of any orgaiization is almost 
hopeless. For foreigners, of course, this is particularly difficult. 
OUESTION: Please tell us about the religious feelings of the Soviet people 
in concetttration camps. 
In the camps there are very many religious believers, undoubtedly 
as many as on the outside. Besided the Orthodox, there are in the camps 
also representatives of other religious sects, for example, Baptists, so?
called Seventh Day Adventists, True Christians, later Evangelists, and 
many others. There are also Methodists. I even encountered one lone 
Stundist. This is quite rare. These people are very intensive believers 
possessed of the typical traits of small religious groups, sticking close, 
helping one another out, holding themselves aloof from the general mass, 
and steadfastly adhering to their views. It is necessary to say that 
representatives of the Orthodox clergy, and of Soviet citizenship, who 
have been sentenced to camp, adhere to their views with special staunchness. 
There are not too many of these. In general, the clergy as a class of 
society has strongly decreased in number in the Soviet Union. It is 
characteristic, however, for those who who land in prison to behave more

alone with extraordinary steadfastness and heroism. Many from the ranks 
of the representatives of the sects, when a matter comes to a serious 
clash with the camp administration, usually acquiesce at the end. Materially 
they live very well. They help themselves. But I know of several instances 
of perfectly inflexible conduct on the part of the Orthodox clergy; in part-
icular,on the part of one priest whose name I do not know, who did not go 
dad IlWimoto work and was ultimately shot. 
QUESTION: Tell about the attitude of the nonreligious segment of the 
prisoners toward the believers. 
It is of two types. There is no hostile attitude. There is 
no malice or indignation. Nonreligious people as, for example, the 
representatives of the Communists regard them as an undesirable anachronism. 
Oh, they are ignorant people; they don't know anything; they navigate under 
old sails. But there are no bad ones among them. They even make interest-
ing conversation. Indifferent people are treated indifferently. As for 
the basic mass, when a pious man appeared, he was treated with respect 
in camp and became the subject of intensive inquiries. 
QUESTION: From what age groups are the religious-minded composed? 
Believers are from evry group. It is necessary to say that 
there are many religious-minded youths in the camps, but they believe in 
a manner completely different from the older people. Whereas the older 
generation believes more in ritual and dogma--they pray and cross themselves 
considerably and conduct frequent religious services, as for example, Easter 
services. 
I myself attended an Easter service this year, during which the 
doors were locked and no guards were allowed in until it was over; everyone 
went away so as not to cause a scene--the youth believes less dogmatically, 
prays less, but more philosophically and consciously, i.e. the philosophical 
and methodic side of religion interests them more than the ritual side.

QUESTION: What is this KGB--State Security Committee? What is its role? 
What is the structure of its organs? Are there KGB representatives in 
local areas? Is there a low-level network, or is this only a committee 
which regulates the whole system of state security, troops, KGB, etc.? 
The State Secutiry Committee in my opinion is merely a title 
given to the former Ministry of State Security, if I am not mistaken. It 
has simply been revived. Frankly, the people who know say that nothing 
has changed. The Ministry of State Security simply received a new label. 
It has ceased to be a separate ministry. Work in the camps Lord illegible 
the same as on the outside. Absolutely all types of work are available. 
Everything that is done on the outside is also done in the camp, the only 
difference being that in the regimented camps they work longer, usually 
ten hours, while in the nonregimented camps, eight houts, and under one 
pretext or another, it is less well-paid. The prisoners have fewer rights. 
The nature of the work depends on where the camp is located. In Vorkuta 
a vast number of the prisoners work, for example, in mines, because this 
is a coal region. Another part works on the surface. These are types of 
work which [remainder  of sentence illegib127. There is very intensive

of a theological or philosophical nature, and do they abandon or defend 
their own opinions before those with contrary opinions, etc? And also 
tell about those people -- without names -- wham you met and who had 
been here abroad and also about those who landed directly from the Soviet 
Union into prison. 
It is necessary to say that in the camps they speak far more freely 
than they do on the outside. Frankly, they are far less afraid. Say a 
man has 25 years; that is the limit. What more can be done to him? He 
can, for example, be sent away to a closed prison, but if everyone who 
says something is sent away, .soon the entire population of the camps 
would be enclosed in prisons. What is necessary is only to avoid making 
big scenes. For example, it is impossible to assemble a meeting, as 
one abnormal old man did, and to begin to chant the old anthem "God Save 
the Tsar." After this he, of course, disappeared from the camp. But 
generally speaking, groups of people who trust one another gather and 
talk about all subjects. It should be mentioned that, strange as it 
seems, I completed my studies in the camps.for, no matter what you were 
interested in, you were able to learn everything. You could take a 
university course in any field, although in raw form, You could, for 
example, almost acquire a knowledge of engineering as lbng as there was 
the desire. It is very hard and difficult, but with a certain amount of 
tenacity, will-power, and persistence, it is fully possible. Arguments 
on ideological subjects are held very, very intensively. And they are 
held not only by those who belong to the various political groups but 
by absolutely everyone. There are also camp propagandists -- people who 
belong to political groups, no matter which ones, they always try to 
drag the other prisoners into their circle. Thus, purely ideological 
battles frequently took place. In the camp this is very simple. Let 
us say the discussion concerned German concentration camps, then Immediately

it is recalled who among the Germans here had been a concentration 
camp overseer. He is summoned here. Then, let's say, a Jew who had 
been imprisoned in this concentration camp is summoned. And they 
peacefully drink tea on a bUnk and we all listen as they discuss what 
had happened in the camps -- one from the point of view of a prisoner 
doomed to death and the other from the point of view of an overseer. 
They chat quite peacefully, without any malice, for all hatred is mani-
fested, of course, against those who are keeping them in the present camp. 
Strange as it seems, the relations between Germans, former members of 
the Nazi Party, and Jews is generally very good. Arguments are held. 
For example, attempts often occur in the camps to find a middle neutral 
course. Representatives of the various anti-Soviet groups attempt to 
fashion some kind of ideology in the camp. Everyone has plenty of time; 
there is no hurry; they are serving a_verk.long time, they figure that 
if in five or ten years you will be released by some sort of amnesty, 
you will go out more or less politically learned and equipped. Great 
interest is shown in camp to people of intelligence, to the politically 
learned and interested, and to those who know something. No intelligent 
camp inmate can complain that he has no audience. This, of course, is 
somewhat dangerous, because frequently questions are broached which, 
since they are posed by simple people, are completely naive but usually 
very difficult to answer. The politically-minded prisoners do not dis-
continue their work in the camps. On the contrary, they conduct it far 
more intensively and with far less danger than on the outside. There is 
nothing more to lose, and.. audience is far more grateful. Particularly 
heated battles occur between opponents of the regime and those in camp 
who cantinue to support it. I am speaking, of course, of that self-
seeking element which pretends that it is loyal to the Soviet regime in 
order to obtain some nice little position, such as, let's say, that of

bookkeeper, supply clerk, a clerk, etc. I am speaking of those who 
actually defend the Soviet regime sincerely -- there are such persons. 
This was usually a very unfortunate scorned element,pitied by all)of old 
ideological Communists of whom there was a very large percentage in the 
camps -- from the old Lenin guard and so-called Lenin set of the NEP peiod. 
There are a specially large number of them. They had spent their entire 
lives in the struggle for Communism, and,of courssdo not possess the 
mental strength to judge values, to acknowledge that what they had 
struggled for and defended was in the end worth nothing, that all the 
blood spilled and their own crippled lives had really been sacrificed 
for nothing and that the price of their blood was negligible. For that 
reason they cling to their old ideology. But these are tragicomical 
characters; for example, the argument ends on the note that "you are 20 
years behind the times." An ideological strugglesof course, takes place. 
But everyone realizes that this element of old ideological Communists was 
completely harmless. They were an anachronism, a bygone element. Far 
more dangerous are the silent self-seekers who in reality are not Com-
munists but opportunists. They were opportunists both on the outside and 
inside the camps. In general camp life is a complete copy of life on the 
outside, except that everything is far poorer, stricter, and more limited. 
QUESTION: Did you not attempt to test the idea of solidarism among your 
fellow prisoners? 
I spoke to the prisoners on the idea of solidarism, as much as I 
know of it, of course, in approximately the condition it was ten years 
ago. It is necessary to say that it evoked the manifest interest of the 
prisoners. But the fact is that4like anyone not possessed of materials

by myself. Concerning the development and advances which it made during 
my absence, I of course knew nothing. Many are sympathetic to our idea 
and say directly that the idea of this compulsory collectivism should 
really be replaced by the idea of voluntary solidarism. With several 
persons wham I could trust, I endeavoured to set forth briefly the program 
of labor solidarism from the aspect of its practical application. For 
example, the idea of replacing the compulsory kolkhozes which are now 
being simply converted into state agricultural dominions, for the 
process of expanding the kolkhozes, begun during the time of Stalin and 
not halted to this day, goes on continuously. Later the kolkhoz workers 
are deprived of any opportunity to participate in the administration of 
the kolkhozes. Of course, since the time that several secondary schools 
were created for training kolkhoz chairman, i.e., a kolkhoz chairman is 
transformed simply into an academically-educated bureaucrat, he loses 
all ties with the kolkhoz members. I spoke on this subject and also cr 
the fact that a replacement of kolkhozes is contemplated, juridical 
permission to leave the kolkhoz; the kolkhoz simply.... in normal state, 
and beyond this the people themselves must decide voluntarily. He who 
wants to cultivate the land collectively has the right to establish, 
together with those who want this, a type of agricultural cooperative, 
but on fully voluntary principles, and from the view point of benefit 
to the coop member rather than for the benefit of the government alone. 
The idea of dividing up the kolkhoz into, let us say, farmsteads, meets 
with great support. Many say, however, that most kolkhoz youth have 
grown out of the habit of cultivating the land by themselves and that 
it is no longer so simple now. The older generation is still able to 
do so. But the modern kolkhoz youth has become used to considering 
himself a kolkhoz worker, not a landowner. 
And in regard to industry, everyone fully realizes that factories 
and plants belonging to the workers have been converted into nothing

but enormous, state-political enterprises, which are directed by 
bureaucrats, and the lion's share of the profits, which do not, of 
course, fall into the hands of the workers but go in far greater and 
sharper form than in capitalistic states for the benefit of the State, 
that is, in outrageous quantities.. ..into the hands of the dozen in-
dividuals who control the entire country. The idea of the possibility 
of turning over part of the enterprises and plants to interested people 
on a concession basis meets with great interest, especially the authoriza-
tion of private enterprise in order that, for example, every person might 
have the opportunity to establish and personally manage his own private 
business. It is asked, "Well, that's fine, but where will the funds be 
taken from?" When you say that, of course, the State will simply mutually 
allocate the appropriate funds out of State funds and that at least all

must be established in order to reduce prices; and to create that state
