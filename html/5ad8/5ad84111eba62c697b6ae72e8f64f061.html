 VIETNAM
 Ground fighting in South Vietnam continues to be centered
 near the Cambodian border in the western highlands
 and farther south in Communist War Zone "C."   The over-
 all pattern of enemy activity in the past few months
 suggests that the Communist forces are generally on
 the defensive.   They have not attempted to overwhelm a
 strategic allied outpost since last March and Communist
 progaganda is increasingly emphasizing the importance
 of guerrilla warfare.   Premier Ky has reassigned the
 controversial IV Corps commander to the government Min-
 istry of Development and Planning.
 STANDOFF IN PEKING CONTINUES
 A new move may be afoot to bring down Chief of State
 Liu Shao-chi and party general secretary Teng Hsiao-
 ping.   Other developments, however, have suggested
 that Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao were retreating at
 least temporarily in their drive against opponents
 in the party.

 FAR  EAST
 VIETNAM
 US forces continued to en-
 gage North Vietnamese Army  (NVA)
 regulars this week in the central
 highlands and in Communist War
 Zone "C"  in Tay Ninh Province.
 Heavy fighting flared between
 elements of the lst NVA Division
 (formerly the 630th)  and units of
 the ten-battalion US Operation
 PAUL REVERE IV in the western
 highlands of Pleiku and Kontum
 provinces.   On 18-19 November US
 forces reinforced a South Viet-
 namese patrol which had been at-
 tacked about 15 miles west of the
 Plei Djereng Special Forces Camp
 near the Cambodian border, killing
 nearly 175 Communist troops.  Sev-
 eral days later,  in an area near
 the Ia Drang Valley about 35 miles
 southwest of Pleiku city,  a North
 Vietnamese battalion overran the
 field position of a US platoon.
 A reaction force killed over 100
 of the enemy and suffered casual-
 ties of 34 killed and 11 wounded.
 Farther south allied forces
 participating in Operation ATTLE-
 BORO made only light contact with
 elements of the 5,600-man Viet
 Cong 9th Division in the area
 northwest of Tay Ninh city.   As
 the week ended,  four US battalions
 had been withdrawn from Tay Ninh
 Province for reassignment to other
 areas.
 Over-all Enemy Strategy
 The pattern of Communist
 military activity in South Viet-
 nam during the past few months
 suggests that allied spoiling op-
 erations may be forcing a signif-
 icant revision in the enemy's
 strategy.   The Communists are no
 longer seeking to overwhelm stra-
 tegic allied outposts like Plei
 Me,  as they did last fall.   The
 last such attack--on the Special
 Forces camp at A Shau in Thua
 Thien Province--took place in
 March.   Such attacks were partly
 designed to encourage deployment
 of a large allied reaction force
 which would become target for am-
 bush.   The Communists found, how-
 ever,  that the growing allied
 capability to react with over-
 whelming air and ground fire-
 power made such operations too
 costly in terms of casualties.
 Now the enemy main forces
 seem to be generally on the de-
 fensive.   Occasionally when they
 appeared to be mustering for an
 attack,  allied reaction appears
 to have disrupted their plans.
 In the central highlands they
 seem to be engaged to some ex-
 tent in a strategy of maneuver.
 Enemy units continue to move
 around guardedly,  apparently hop-
 ing to draw the allied forces

 into short, localized engagements
 in which the odds are heavily
 with the Communists.   In the past
 several weeks, they have had some
 success.   Several company-sized
 or smaller US elements have been
 hard hit.   In each case, however,
 the Communists have also suffered
 heavy casualties.   Their strategy
 has, nonetheless, been successful
 in cutting the over-all attrition
 rate of their units in the high-
 lands.
 Meanwhile, the enemy has be-
 gun to put a much greater propa-
 ganda emphasis on the guerrilla
 side of the war.   Each day brings
 new admonitions on the value of
 hit-and-run raids and terrorist
 actions as a means of tying down
 friendly forces and sustaining
 the Communist grass-roots position
 in the countryside.   So far,  the
 statistics do not indicate a sig-
 nificant increase in guerrilla-
 type actions throughout South
 Vietnam;  the rate could rise con-
 siderably, however,                            in the coming
 months.
 In the last analysis, the
 Communists are most interested in
 maintaining their hold over large
 portions   of the rural populace.
 They may be hoping to accomplish
 this largely by guerrilla.actions
 while their main forces threaten
 large-scale attacks in order to
 keep the bulk of allied units
 tied up and unable to concentrate
 on pacification.
 Premier Ky Rearranges Military
 And Government Assignments
 The reassignment of the con-
 troversial IV Corps commander,
 General Dang Van Quang, high-
 lighted several changes in the
 South Vietnamese military command
 structure on 19 November.
 Quang will serve as minis-
 ter of development and planning,
 a new cabinet post  dealing mainly
 with long-term postwar planning
 and economic development. General
 Nguyen Van Manh,  a southerner and
 a division commander in II Corps,
 was posted as the new IV Corps
 commander.   Other changes in mil-
 itary assignments included a new
 chief of staff for the Joint Gen-
 eral Staff, a new division com-
 mander to replace General Manh,
 and a reshuffling of several mil-
 itary training commands.   The
 status of Revolutionary Develop-
 ment Minister General Thang and
 II Corps commander General Loc
 were also reviewed, although not
 changed, by the military leader-
 ship.
 There were no immediate re-
 ports of any adverse reaction to
 Quang's reassignment among south-
 ern elements who have been in-
 volved in the north-south regional
 tensions.
 Because of widespread allega-
 tions of corruption in the delta
 area south of Saigon, Quang's re-
 moval as IV Corps commander has
 been rumored for some time.

 As a cabinet minister
 in Saigon,  however, Quang presum-
 ably will continue to have some
 influence in the government, and
 his reassignment rather than out-
 right dismissal bears the charac-
 teristics of a compromise.
 Meanwhile,  Premier Ky finally
 announced his cabinet replacements
 for three of the four southern
 ministers who resigned because of
 "police state" tactics and regional
 discrimination.  Ky's three new
 ministers are all southerners, but
 without much prestige or proven
 ability,  and his selection of a
 military officer as youth minister
 reflects his failure to find a
 willing southern civilian.   In ad-
 dition, Ky was unable to find a
 suitable replacement for Economy
 Minister Thanh,  and he now plans
 to direct economic affairs through
 a council system rather than
 through an individual minister.
 Without consistent policy enforce-
 ment by Ky, this important minis-
 try may well suffer from a lack
 of direction and responsibility.
 Hanoi Expands East Europe Contacts
 Hanoi is continuing to shore
 up its improved relations with
 Eastern European Communists.
 Three separate politburo members
 are heading delegations to Euro-
 pean party congresses--Hoang Van
 Hoan and Nguyen Duy Trinh have
 led delegations to Albania and to
 Bulgaria,  and Le Duc Tho will
 head a delegation at the Hungarian
 Congress beginning 28 November.
 Several years ago when the East
 Europeans were giving less support
 to Hanoi, a single DRV delegation
 attended four Eastern European
 party congresses held at about the
 same time.
 Hanoi is undoubtedly using
 these visits to make certain it is
 getting its views on the war
 across to the East Europeans. The
 politburo visits may mark a new
 bid for greater East European po-
 litical support.

 STANDOFF IN PEKING CONTINUES
 An authoritative-looking
 Red Guard pamphlet displayed on
 23 November in Peking demanding
 the dismissal of chief of state
 Liu Shao-chi and party general
 secretary Teng Hsiao-ping sug-
 gests a move to bring them down
 in disgrace.   Other recent de- however, suggested
 Mao and Lin were retreating at
 least temporarily in their drive
 against opponents in the party.
 An attempt to discredit the
 guards for their harassment of
 party officials seems to have been
 under way.   Numerous wall posters
 have been appearing in Peking
 charging that Guards have killed
 and even tortured to death party
 officials in Peking and other
 cities.   On 20 November the Peking
 city party committee--itself the
 target of recent guard attacks--
 posted notices warning that Red
 Guards who set up kangaroo courts
 and tortured officials would be
 severely punished.
 Peking issued a directive on
 16 November ordering all Red
 Guards visiting Peking to go home
 by 20 November, and reportedly
 ordered all trains carrying Red
 Guards to turn around and return
 them to their place of origin.
 There had been reliable indica-
 tions as of 10 November that an
 eighth rally for Red Guards in
 the series that started in Au-
 gust would be held in Peking in
 the last ten days of the month.
 This apparently has been canceled.
 Lin Piao's position may have
 weakened temporarily.   Press at-
 tention to him has dropped off
 and he missed the last Red Guard
 rally held on 11 November, pos-
 sibly because of illness.   He has
 a long history of frail health,
 probably the aftermath of tuber-
 culosis.   If he has been forced
 to reduce his activities,  this
 might give his opponents an op-
 portunity to improve their posi-
 tion at his expense.
 The positions of two leaders
 identified with a relatively mod-
 erate line in Peking--Premier Chou
 En-lai and economic planner Li
 Fu-chun--have been enhanced since
 about 10 November.   The only au-
 thoritative regime pronouncement
 on the cultural revolution issued
 since early November is a People's
 Dail   editorial on 10 November
 aimed at protecting the economy
 from the excesses of cultural revo-
 lution.   This is a moderate line
 that has been taken by Chou, but
 not by Lin Piao.
 On 16 November, the same day
 the Red Guards were ordered home,
 Peking revealed that Li Fu-chun,
 whose career has been closely as-
 sociated with Chou's,  is now a
 member of the elite standing com-
 mittee of the politburo.

 LAOTIAN POLITICAL SITUATION STILL UNSETTLED
 The political situation in
 Laos continues unsettled even
 though the status of the contro-
 versial neutralist General Kong
 Le seems to have been resolved.
 Premier Souvanna has accepted
 Kong Le's resignation as commander
 of the neutralist forces and the
 general is scheduled to go abroad
 indefinitely.   The question of
 integrating his former forces into
 the Royal Laotian Army (FAR), how-
 ever,  is still in the discussion
 stage.
 FAR generals, meeting in
 Luang Prabang between 16 and 18
 November,  agreed that a trium-
 virate of neutralist colonels
 should command these forces under
 the supervision of the FAR General

 given no indication of his inten-
 tions.                                   I
 Any move toward integration
 will give Souvanna a good excuse
 to close out the military mission
 the French have maintained in
 the neutralist camp. His generals
 have been urging this, or at
 least a reduction in its size,
 on grounds that it has exceeded
 its advisory function and is
 meddling in purely internal Lao-
 tian affairs.   One French officer
 has already been asked to leave.
 Souvanna still expects to
 hold elections for the national
 assembly on 1 January as sched-
 uled,  although some rightist
 military officers would like more
 time in which to build support
 for candidates amenable to their
 influence.

 SOVIET PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO AUSTRIA
 Soviet President Podgorny
 made no substantive concessions
 during his visit to Austria last
 week but left his hosts hopeful
 about a more compromising Soviet
 attitude toward their problems
 in the future.   He reiterated
 the USSR's opposition to Aus-
 trian association with the EEC but
 opened the prospect of greater
 trade with the USSR.   He avoided
 any threats.   The final joint
 communique made no mention of
 the EEC question.
 Podgorny avoided any commit-
 ment on a reinterpretation of
 the 1955 State Treaty which Vienna
 has long sought in order to ac-
 quire defensive missiles, but
 said the Soviets are considering
 the problem at the expert level.
 The Soviet President is re-
 ported to have complimented Aus-
 tria on its participation in the
 East-West "group of nine" along
 with Belgium,  Denmark,  Sweden,
 Finland, Bulgaria, Hungary,  Ru-
 mania,  and Yugoslavia.   The group
 co-sponsored a UN resolution last
 December on improving East-West
 relations in Europe and is plan-
 ning further initiatives in this
 field.
 Both Chancellor Klaus and
 President Jonas accepted invita-
 tions to visit the USSR,  and may
 go next year.
 BULGARIAN PARTY CONGRESS CONSOLIDATES ZHIVKOV REGIME
 Bulgaria's ninth party con-
 gress, which ended on 19 Novem-
 ber, brought first secretary Todor
 Zhivkov to his strongest position
 since he assumed power in 1954.
 In addition to installing many of
 Zhivkov's supporters in the par-
 ty's highest organs and removing
 some of his opponents,  the con-
 gress enlarged these bodies,  con-
 tinuing the trend started by
 Zhivkov to add skilled and tech-
 nically qualified personnel to
 the hierarchy to promote economic
 reform.
 Zhivkov's strength was dem-
 onstrated by the removal of his
 rival, politburo member and party
 secretary Mitko Grigorov.   Ironi-
 cally the conservative Grigorov,
 as party ideologue, has been
 forced to take the blame for the
 rapid penetration of "Western
 bourgeois influence," especially
 among the youth,  as charged in
 the Bulgarian press.   However,
 his undisguised ambition for
 power probably was the major fac-
 tor contributing to his downfall.
 Membership in the politburo
 increased from 11 to 18 and a
 secretariat  was  formally consti-
 tuted for the first time.   Stanko
 Todorov,  an energetic supporter

 of economic reform, was elected
 party secretary and re-elected
 to the politburo; he now appears,
 at only 46, to be the number two
 man in the hierarchy.   The ele-
 vation of Ivan Popov, chairman
 of the State Committee for Sci-
 ence and Technical Progress,  to
 the politburo without prior mem-
 bership on the central committee
 is a striking example of the re-
 gime's desire to revitalize the
 leadership.
 Speakers at the congress
 paid the traditional homage to
 the USSR and gave no indication
 that Sofia's alliance with Mos-
 cow is eroding. Zhiokov committed
 Bulgaria  to  complete  support
 of the Soviet Union's anti-Chinese
 crusade.  The regime probably is
 using this issue to help isolate
 the dogmatic faction within the
 party.
 As expected,  the congress
 hailed Bulgaria's foreign policy
 initiatives in the Balkans,  and
 again called for greater cooper-
 ation among all Balkan countries.
 The congress also adopted the
 ambitious goals of the 196670
 economic plan.
 The ouster of the dogmatic
 Grigorov may open the door to
 greater cultural freedom with
 emphasis, however, on Bulgaria's
 national. heritage and warnings
 against "bourgeois influences."
 The Bulgarian people will also
 be pleased by the regime's ef-
 forts to raise the standard of
 living,  increase salaries,  and
 allow greater public voice in the
 central government's legislation.

 REACTIONS TO BRITAIN'S COMMON MARKET BID
 Prime Minister Wilson's an-
 nouncement of a serious new UK
 bid for membership in the Euro-
 pean Economic Community has met
 a cautious response.   While there
 is probably an even greater de-
 sire on the part of France's-EEC
 partners now than in 1961 and 1962
 to see Britain in the community,
 they are wary of "spoiling moves"
 by De Gaulle and uncertain of
 their ability to deal with them.
 Moreover,  they feel that if they
 are to confront him on the issue,
 London must make clear its firm
 support for the EEC treaty and
 de-emphasize "safeguards for Brit-
 ish interests."
 Political conditions in the
 EEC countries are not especially
 favorable to Britain's cause.
 A new government in Bonn may be
 reluctant to face a showdown
 with De Gaulle over Britain's en-
 try.   The Dutch have only an in-
 terim government,  and Italy is
 not likely to take the lead.   The
 parliamentary elections in France
 next March are a further element
 of uncertainty.
 The French Foreign Ministry
 is downgrading the "sincerity"
 of Wilson's approach and empha-
 sizing Britain's possible reser-
 vations on the EEC's agricultural
 policy and difficulties with ster-
 ling's international role. ~~
 Wilson evidently hopes in
 bilateral talks with each of the
 Five to reach agreement on the
 terms of Britain's accession.
 This would at least make it more
 difficult for France to resort to
 another veto.   In the meantime,
 in an effort to deal with the di-
 lemma posed by the wishes of the
 Five,  De Gaulle's opposition to
 supranationalism,  and conflict-
 ing pressures at home, Wilson is
 attempting to concentrate on the
 immediate economic issues involved
 in British EEC membership.   In
 the House of Commons last week,
 Wilson declined to comment on
 future political arrangements in
 Europe going beyond those involved
 in  the EEC.
 The prospects are therefore
 for cautious maneuvering over
 the next few months, with all the
 parties aware of the importance
 of the issues at stake.   The basic
 interests of the Five are probably
 reflected in a ranking Belgian
 official's view that Britain's
 entry would offset recent French
 negativism and inject new vitality
 into community institutions.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 JORDAN STILL PLAGUED BY ANTIREGIME DEMONSTRATIONS
 Jordan continues to be
 plagued by antiregime demonstra-
 tions stemming from its poor show-
 ing in the face of Israel's 13 No-
 vember raid.   Egyptian and Syrian
 propaganda media are disseminating
 lurid accounts of the "revolt" to
 encourage further uprisings
 against King Husayn.
 The primary area of unrest
 is Palestinian west Jordan.   West
 Jordan is chronically resentful
 of Amman's rule and has been the
 base for most of the Palestinian
 terrorist activity which precipi-
 tated Israel's reprisal.
 The town of Nablus is cur-
 rently the focal point of popular
 antagonism toward the regime,  and
 demonstrations have been occurring
 there almost daily.   Two battal-
 ions of troops reportedly were re-
 quired to put down a riot there
 on 21 November in which two ci-
 vilians were killed.
 tants. The petition also calls
 upon the government to cease
 interfering with the operations
 of the Palestinian terrorists
 against Israel.   The radio claims
 that popular sentiment in Jordan
 foreshadows "a comprehensive pop-
 ular revolution"                                                                          in all parts of
 the country.
 The semiofficial Egyptian
 newspaper Al-Ahram has attacked
 Husayn's opposition to the arming
 of Jordanian Palestinians,  calling
 him a "reactionary ally of Israel"
 who opposes the PLO and the Pal-
 estine nation and strikes it from
 the rear while Israel attacks it
 on the border.   Cairo radio is
 highlighting a report that a group
 of "free Jordanian officers" has
 formed a revolutionary committee
 which plans to establish a repub-
 lic in Jordan to be named Pales-
 tine and have Jerusalem as its       25X1
 capital.
 Trouble has also developed
 in other towns,  including Jeru-
 salem, but Jordanian authorities
 have thus far been able to main-
 tain control by vigorous action
 against. the demonstrators.
 The Palestine Liberation Or-
 ganization's  (PLO)  "Voice of Pal-
 estine," broadcasting from Cairo,
 has featured a petition to Husayn
 by the Nablus mayor and other of-
 ficials which requests that the
 government cooperate with the PLO
 in fortifying Palestinian border
 villages and arming the inhabi-
 Israel, meanwhile,  shows no
 inclination to take further ag-
 gressive action at this time.
 International criticism of the
 magnitude of its 13 November raid
 has prompted the Israelis to claim
 that the operation went beyond its
 intended scope.

 NIGERIAN CRISIS DEEPENS
 The interregional differences
 which have been pushing the Ni-
 gerian federation toward fragmen-
 tation for four months are una-
 bated.
 Supreme Commander Gowon last
 week in effect disbanded the in-
 terregional conference on a new
 constitutional formula and prom-
 ised to "discuss" with the four
 regional military governors pro-
 posals of his own for constitu-
 tional reforms.   Gowon attributed
 his initiative to the inability
 of the tribal disputants even to
 agree on a site for the talks,
 much. less resolve substantive dif-
 ferences.
 Eastern military governor
 Ojukwu, whose refusal to send his
 region's delegates to Lagos had
 stalled the talks since late Oc-
 tober,  called Gowon's decision
 "dictatorial" and promised that
 the East would resist any attempt
 to impose a constitution upon it.
 This makes unlikely any early di-
 rect meeting between himself and
 Gowon.
 The East would evidently
 still accept a loose confederal
 arrangement, but opposes creation
 of a federal parliament and is
 more insistent than ever on pre-
 serving its regional integrity.
 The West,  rapidly losing what con-
 fidence it had in the federal mil-
 itary government and feeling pro-
 gressively more estranged from the
 other regions, has apparently
 moved close to the East's posi-
 tion.   However, the federal gov-
 ernment--now controlled by North-
 Page  19
 erners--and key spokesmen for
 minority tribal elements now dom-
 inant in the Northern region are
 holding out for a strong central
 government and creation of addi-
 tional states to cope with tribal-
 ism in the East and North.
 Western military governor
 Adebayo has publicly denounced a
 plot to overthrow his government
 instigated by ex-politicians be-
 longing to the banned Nigerian
 National Democratic Party  (NNDP).
 He will probably take no action
 against the NNDP politicians or
 troops involved in the plot for
 fear of a reaction from army ele-
 ments or powerful Northern friends
 of the plotters.   The incident
 has,  however, added strong new
 impetus to Western pressures for
 early replacement of troops na-
 tive to the North by those native
 to the West.
 Gowon's position remains pre-
 carious.
 He must soon show some progress
 toward bringing the East to heel,
 rehabilitating the army,  and
 tightening up the administration.
 Northern extremists increasingly
 urge pre-emptive military action
 against the East and military ele-
 ments are impatient to get on with
 reorganization of the badly shat-
 tered army.

 DISSIDENCE INCREASING IN ETHIOPIA
 The Ethiopian Government is
 facing new unrest in two areas
 of the country--the traditionally
 separatist-minded northern prov-
 ince of Eritrea and in the south
 among the Galla people.
 Following a long period of
 relative inactivity,  the Eritrean
 Liberation Front  (ELF)  early this
 month carried out coordinated but
 unsuccessful attacks against se-
 curity forces in several towns
 and villages in western Eritrea.
 Since early fall the ELF has been

 operations.   This has required
 the government to divert security
 forces to that area where the
 latest reported ELF attack--on
 a police post near Massawa on
 14 November--occurred.
 Although the ELF is not yet
 a serious threat,  it is believed
 to have about 600 disciplined
 guerrillas.   The government would
 be hard pressed to contain a
 threatened two-front ELF opera-
 tion,  and has asked the US for
 helicopters to meet this possi-
 ble threat.
 Unrest has also been grow-
 ing among the Galla people,  the
 largest ethnic group in the coun-
 try.  Although historically dom-
 inated by the ruling Amhara-Tigre
 people, many Galla hold important
 government and army positions.
 The last outbreak of violence
 among the Galla occurred in early
 1965 in Bale Province.
 SECRET
 The current unrest in Shawa
 and Arusi provinces has been
 prompted by the activities of
 prominent Galla figures lead by
 General Tadesse Biru.   Tadesse
 and the others have been trying
 to politicize the principal Galla
 tribal association, which Tadesse
 heads.   Political parties are
 not permitted in Ethiopia, but
 since September Tadesse and other
 Gallas have been holding polit-
 ical rallies calling for elec-
 tions and reforms and stressing
 Galla unity.
 For the moment at least the
 government seems to have the
 situation in hand.   Except for
 Tadesse, who is in hiding,  the
 other Galla leaders have been
 detained.   However, should the
 Galla get any concessions from
 the Emperor,  the 30 to 40 other
 tribal associations in Ethiopia
 might also be encouraged to or-
 ganize for political purposes.

 half of the country.   The armed

 PROGOVERNMENT PARTY GENERALLY VICTORIOUS IN BRAZIL ELECTIONS
 Election returns  from Bra-
 zil's congressional elections on
 15 November are still incomplete.
 It appears, however,  that the
 government has obtained coopera-
 tive majorities in Congress and
 in most state legislatures for
 the incoming administration of
 president-elect Arthur da Costa
 e Silva.
 Although the progovernment
 National Renewal Alliance  (ARENA)
 has won substantial victories,
 the opposition Brazilian Demo-
 cratic Movement  (MDB)  has polled
 impressive totals in the impor-
 tant states of Guanabara and Rio
 de Janeiro,  and has done well in
 urban areas of Sao Paulo,  Rio
 Grande do Sul,  and Pernambuco.
 An important factor in many
 states was the high percentage
 of abstentions and blank or in-
 valid votes--in some cases run-
 ning as high as 50 percent.   Al-
 though this is in part attribut-
 able to widespread public dis-
 satisfaction with the government
 of President Castello Branco it
 also reflects public confusion
 over complex ballots.
 Two important ARENA winners
 --Carvalho Pinto in Sao Paulo
 and Magalhaes Pinto in Minas
 Gerais--are running well ahead
 of the party tickets.   Press and
 opposition observers are attrib-
 uting  this  to the independent
 stands taken by these candidates
 and to their frequent criticism
 of the administration despite
 their association with the pro-
 government party.
 Aside from some charges of
 intimidation of opposition candi-
 dates and of vote buying in rural
 areas,   the elections are acknowl-
 edged  to  have been properly
 carried out.   The government
 sparingly used its extraordinary
 powers to cancel mandates and to
 void political rights,  and its
 forbearance may help to reduce
 charges that it is a military
 dictatorship.

 POLITICAL TURMOIL CONTINUES IN ECUADOR
 Ecuador's new provisional
 president, Otto Arosemena, has
 succeeded with difficulty in form-
 ing a cabinet, but his position
 remains extremely shaky and he
 could fall at any time.
 Little is known of most of
 the new ministers.   Most of them
 lean toward conservatism,  although
 it appears that Arosemena has
 tried to form a government of
 "national conciliation" by in-
 cluding persons of diverse politi-
 cal views.   The foreign minister,
 Jorge Carrera Andrade,  is one of
 Ecuador's best known leftist in-
 tellectuals.
 Opposition to Arosemena comes
 from left-of center political
 groups, primarily the Liberal
 Party and Assad Bucaram's Concen-
 tration of Popular Forces.   In
 its declaration of "intransigent
 opposition" to Arosemena,  the
 Liberal Party describes his elec-
 tion as a "shameless alliance
 among the political right and the
 economic oligarchy."   His stand-
 ing has suffered because he gained
 the presidency by a political deal
 parlaying his three votes into a
 majority in the assembly.
 The center-left is trying to
 topple Arosemena by street demon-
 strations and political double-
 dealing of its own in the assem-
 bly.   Demonstrations have tapered
 off since the weekend of 19-20 No-
 vember, but more are expected.
 The military leaders, mean-
 while,  are keeping a cautious eye
 on the deliberations of the assem-
 bly
