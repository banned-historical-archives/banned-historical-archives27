 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 Communist China:   Who's Running the Show?
 Introduction
 The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,
 which erupted in the spring of 1966, has had a pro-
 found impact on the shape and effectiveness of the
 nation's leadership hierarchies.   Even though a
 process of restoring some semblance of "normalcy"
 to China's post-revolutionary power structure has
 been under way for more than two years, it is still
 too soon to answer definitively the question of
 "who's running the show" at the national level.
 Indeed, there is still a serious problem in as-
 sessing the shape and perhaps the function of Com-
 munist China's ruling body, the politburo of the
 Communist Party.  The new body--formed at the ninth
 party congress in April 1.969--is a peculiar creation
 compared to its predecessor.   Prior to the Cultural
 Revolution, the politburo consisted of party chairman
 Mao Tse-tung and a number of top officials in the
 regime, each of whom had a special constituency
 that he monitored on behalf of the party.   Thus, one
 mans primary duty was agriculture; one concerned
 himself with economic affairs; one wi-ch foreign af-
 fairs; another with party business; yet another with
 military matters and so forth.   The new politburo
 does not appear to be constructed along such lines.
 Below the top triumvirate of Mao, his heir-designate
 Defense Minister Lin Piao,  and Premier Chou En-lai--
 who wears many hats both domestic and foreign--only
 economic specialist Li Hsien-nien has a clearly iden-
 tifiable constituency.   For the remainder, there is
 no sharp breakdown of responsibilities, and even the
 army leaders on the politburo must now be presumed
 to be he,-oily irvolved in other than strictly mili-
 tary affairs.  1,oout all that can safely be said
 Note:   This memorandum was prepared by  the Office of
 Current Intelligence and coordinated within CIA.

 Approved For Release 200    fqVf   PfJX0L875R001100100066-3
 about the politburo is that most members, although
 by no means all, probably participate in setting
 the broad outline of policy direction.
 In any case, the politburo itself represents
 only the tip of a large iceberg.   The implementation
 of the policies that it helps formulate rests in the
 hands of a still emerging and as yet little known
 bureaucracy of second- and third-echelon leaders.
 This memorandum is an attempt to identify these sec-
 ondary officials and to describe how they fit into
 the central ruling hierarchy.   Unfortunately, there
 are still many gaps in our knowledge about the structure
 of China's internal governing mechanism.   The Cultural
 Revolution not only resulted in a sweeping purge of
 Mao's principal opponents within the top leadership,
 but also raised havoc throughout the old party and
 government organizational structure.   Al,.ough the
 process of putting together the pieces of this appa-
 ratus has been under way since at least the ninth party
 congress in April 1969, progress has been slow, in part
 because both the party and government bureaucracies e.re
 being restructured and streamlined, and in part because
 many key personnel appointments apparently have been
 bones of contention in Peking.
 One of the primary objectives of the Cultural
 r hierarchy
 Hopefully, a more definitive assessment of at least
 the central government hierarchy will be possible
 after the regime holds its Fourth National Peoples
 Congress which, among other things, is expected to
 serve as a forum for presenting the full slate of
 post - Cultural Revolution ministerial appointments.
 There have been reports that Peking intends to hold
 this congress sometime this year, but this is unlikely
 until some of the political maneuvering currently
 under way within the ruling politburo subsides.
 In examining the state of the nation's leader-
 ship to date, this paper will focus on the three

 major vertical hierarchies in Peking=   the central
 government, the party, and the military.   In each
 of these areas, we will attempt not only to provide
 a comprehensive listing of known officials but also
 to point out, where possible, the division of labor
 within these vertical hierarchies and their relation-
 ship to one another.   The fourth section will examine
 in detail the makeup of the Chinese Foreign Ministry,
 about which much more information is available.  The
 final section will take up the distaff side of the
 house, with special emphasis on identifying the
 wives of the major party and government leaders.

 SECTION I:    THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
 The primary target of the Cultural Revolution
 was the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) apparatus, but
 because the party and government hierarchies formed
 interlocking directorates with many veteran party
 leaders concurrently holding top government posts,
 it was inevitable that the purge would spill over
 into the central government.  Premier Chou En-lai
 put up a spirited defense of many of his subordinates
 and, indeed, he was successful in saving more than a
 few from total political eclipse.   Even so, well over
 half of his government ministers lost their positions
 within the first few months of Red Guard terror.
 From the wreckage of the Cultural Revolution
 the regime is trying to erect a new, streamlined
 bureaucracy--a move specifically directed by Mao
 Tse-tung on she grounds that the pre - Cultural Rev-
 olution structure had become an entrenched elite
 operating through a chain of command that was un-
 responsive to the "revolutionary masses" and that
 was in practice modifying Mao's programs and opera-
 ting largely outside his personal control.  Never-
 theless, the process is intended to do more than
 satisfy Mao's anti-bureaucratic bias.   It is also
 apparently designed to achieve a more clear-cut
 division of labor between local and national levels
 in which more responsibility for day-to-day affairs
 (education, health, production for local use, etc.)
 devolves upon the lower levels.  The number of min-
 istries, according to Chou En-iai,  is being reduced
 by half, and many cadres have been sent off for
 labor "re-education" either permanently or on
 rotation.   Numerous unidentified new names are now
 appearing in lists of departments under the State
 Council.  Some pre - Cultural Revolution officials
 have managed to hang on to their old or similar
 slots, however, and during the past few months a
 number of long-absent veteran officials have again
 appeared.
 Two major features about the staffing of the
 central state bureaucracy are immediately apparent.
 The first is the unusually heavy representation of
 the military.   In many ministries control presumably
 is still in the hands of the military control com-
 mittees that assumed supervision during the Cultural
 Revolution, and four of the six new ministers who

 Approved For Release 200 L'*NFfIA       -Aj$75R001100100066-3
 have been named thus far are military careerists.
 These are men in their forties and early fifties
 who, under the old system, would have had to wait
 ten to 15 years to acquire comparable positions
 of authority within the top-heavy military bu-
 reaucracy.  Judging from what has been observed
 about the new minister of foreign trade, for ex-
 ample, these new soldier-administrators are in-
 telligent, capable, and articulate, but they
 almost certainly have to rely on their largely
 civilian vice ministers for technical expertise.
 Although it seems safe to assume that not a
 single government unit will be free of some form
 of military influence, it is also interesting to
 note the return of many veteran cadre to their
 former places of work.  Some are being identified
 by their former titles; others have shifted from
 one ministry to another as part of the government
 reorganization; and still others are listed only
 as "responsibile persons" of various unidentified
 departments.  Their return to duty is ample testi-
 mony to Peking's recognition that it cannot cav-
 alierly drain the relatively small reservoir of
 civilian managerial and technical talent available
 to China.   It also marks a considerable mellowing
 in the regime's political attitude, which must be
 particularly shocking to the various revolutionary
 activistists who only three or four years ago were
 being exhorted to struggle against the "bureaucrats"
 and forcibly remove them from office.
 The following organizational presentation
 represents only the key elements of what is known
 about the central government hierarchy.

 STATE COUNCIL
 Premier
 Chou En-lai              Chou appears to be "running
 the country"; at one time he
 was assisted by 15 vice pre-
 miers.
 Vice Premiers
 Li Hsien-nien            Li, longtime minister of
 finance, is currently the
 only working vice premier;
 like Chou, he is extremely
 active; his basic field is
 finance and trade, but he is
 undoubtedly now performing a
 much more general, economic
 and planning role.
 Li Fu-chun             Once China's top economic
 specialist, Li appears only
 irregularly now, and he may be
 in poor health.  His influence
 is felt primarily through the
 State Planning Commission, with
 which he may still be associated.
 Hsieh Fu-chih             Hsieh, who is also boss of
 Peking city and minister of
 public security, had been out
 of sight for nearly 15 months
 until he reappeared in June
 1971.  At that time he was
 reidentified as vice premier,
 but it is not clear whether
 he still retains the public
 security portfolio.

 STATE PLANNING COMMISSION
 (There is evidence that the SPC is playing the major
 role in directing China's economic recovery following
 the Cultural Revolution.  At least three former min-
 istries--Allocation of Materials, Labor, and Geology--
 have been absorbed by the SPC, thus greatly expanding
 its over-all planning capabilities.   The State Eco-
 nomic Commission (SEC) , on the other hand, appears to
 have been abolished.  Before the Cultural Revolution
 the SPC handled long-range planning while the SEC
 supervised short-term production plans.   Evidently,
 these functions have now been centralized in the ex-
 panded SPC).

 Li Fu-chun                 Li, for many years one of

 Other responsible persons

 Thus far, however, the only person who has been con-

 his infrequent appearances is Su Ching, a military
 man who is reported to head up the military control
 committee assigned to the SPC.  Su's military back-

 NATIONAL DEFENSE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL COMMISSION
 The existence of this commission was first made

 The civilian aspect of China's R&D program appears

 ences, which reportedly has absorbed the former State
 Scientific and Technological Commission.
 No officials have been identified with this com-
 mission in recent years, and, in fact, the regime rarely

 the NDSTC or some successor organization must be super-

 OTHER CENTRAL ORGANS AND SPECIAL AGENCIES

 THE SUPREME'S PEOPLE'S COURT
 During the Cultural Revolution, normal judicial
 proceedings were suspended and most serious cases were
 handled by military tribunals.  According to the new
 draft state constitution, the stipulation that the
 People's Court be "independent, subject only to the
 law," is omitted, thus bringing the judiciary formally
 under party control.  Even though the courts have lost
 their separate status, however, the regime is still
 identifying officials at the national level.   These
 include Chen Chi-han, and Wu Te-feng--two longtime
 vice presidents of the SPC--Chen Pai, and Yang Lin.

 SECTION II.   THE PARTY HIERARCHY
 The apex of any Communist party system is the
 politburo.  Membership is ordinarily kept rather
 limited, and the Chinese politburo is no exception.
 However, beneath the politburo there exists a large
 central bureaucracy of departments, units, and com-
 mittees that are essentially structured to mirror
 the government and society that the party controls.
 In Communist China, before the Cultural Revolution,
 the party's Secretariat served as the executive arm
 of the politburo.   It controlled the day-to-day ac-
 tivities of ten or so operational departments or
 units that, in turn, supervised almost every aspect
 of the party's function and duties.
 The leaders of the Cultural Revolution claim
 that Mao's opponents thwarted his will by seizing
 control of the party apparatus.  It is not surpris-
 ing therefore, that the head of the Secretariat and
 the chiefs of each of the subordinate departments
 were among the first victims of the Cultural Revo-
 lution.                       To date, the Secretariat has not reap-
 peared, and there is no provision for it in the new
 party constitution; about all that can be said is
 that responsibility for party reconstruction and
 organization now is probably divided among a number
 of politburo members, of whom Chou En-lai appears
 to be the key figure.  Moreover, the regime is be-
 ing very deliberate about the pace of reconstruction,
 which is presumably an area of considerable sensitiv-
 ity in Peking.   Of the ten or so original departments
 and units, only two have been publicly identified as
 still in existence.   The International Liaison Depart-
 ment (ILD), which is responsible for relations with
 foreign Communist parties, has been particularly ac-
 tive in recent months, following the naming of Kong
 Piao, China's former ambassador to Albania, as the
 new director.  The ILD is roughly the party equiva-
 lent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and its
 relatively rapid re-emergence can be likened to
 that of the Foreign Ministry within the central
 ministries.
 For the most part, however, the regime is being
 extremely secretive about who holds what top party
 jobs.   For example, not one member of the politburo

 has been identified in a specific party post, even
 though it can be presumed that there is some kind of
 divis;_on. of labor among the active politburo members.
 Moreover, analysis of the lists of central party and
 government figures that attend the major rallies in
 Peking clearly reveals that the central party hier-
 archy is as big and cumbersome as that of the central
 government ministries, despite Mao's efforts to
 streamline all levels of administrations.
 Nevertheless, it is possible to make a few gen-
 eralizations about the staffing procedures for the
 party.   It is obvious that the military are well
 represented not only at the politburo level, but
 also at the working level within the central party
 hierarchy.   It is also evident that, when compared
 to  the  ministries, only a small number of party
 cadre have been reinstated in positions of authority.
 Conversely, the large numbers of persons appeari

 that existed on the old party veterans can be accu-
 mulated.  At the end of this section is a list of
 names of Chinese officials who appear destined to as-

 SECTION III: THE MILITARY HIERARCHY
 Organizationally speaking, the Cultural Revolu-?
 tion did not seriously harm the central military
 structure.   Perhaps the biggest casualty was the
 General Political Department., which dropped out of
 the news for about two years following the disastrous
 summer of 1967.  Evidently, the leaders of the GP?D
 became directly implicated in the short-lived cam-
 paign to "drag out" the handful of revisionists in
 the military establishment or the People's Libera-
 tion Army  (PLA), as it is known in China.
 Actually, there was a major purge of army per-
 sonnel at the center in late 1966, but it went
 largely unnoticed because of the rapid flow of
 events following the movement of the Cultural Revo-
 lution into the provinces in a major way in 1967.
 Although estimates vary, depending on how one de-
 fines a military versus a party leader, something
 in the order of about one third of China's top mil-
 itary brass was removed at that time.  There fol-
 lowed the purge of the GPD in mid-1967 and the
 mysterious Yang Cheng-wu affair in March 1968, in
 which three key military officers were sacked fol-
 lowing an alleged plot to topple Mao.

 China, however, it is obvious that the key decision-

 Affairs Committee, a party organ under the central
 committee but probably directly responsive to the
 politburo and its standing committee headed by Mao
 and Lin.   The MAC probably sets the basic guidelines
 within which the military hierarchy operators. r~

 The implementation of purely military policy---
 such as national defense planning, the conduct of
 troop movements, training, logistics, etc.---is prob-
 ably handled by the General Staff Department  finder
 the over-all supervision of the Minister of 1'~itional
 Defense, Lin Piao.   The head of the PLA General Staff
 Department, Huang Yung?-sheng, is roughly the counter-
 part of the Chief of the General Stdtf in the West.
 There is no separate staff headq.,arters for the
 ground forces, and the chief of staff, as the situ-
 ation exists today, has as his deputies the leaders
 of the air force and navy as well as the logistics
 chief.   The only person who does not formally come
 under the chief of staff is the director of the
 General Political Department.   He probably answers
 directly to the MAC.
 The third major element within the military
 hierarchy is the so-called "administrative unit" of
 the MAC.   This is a special body that apparently was
 set up under the MAC to supervise the army's growing
 role in civil affairs as a result of the Cultural
 The importance of this body can be seen in the
 high party ranking that was ultimately accorded its
 top leadership.   Five of its seven members were
 elevated to the politburo at the ninth party congress
 in 1969.   If the administrative :snit is, in fact,
 the primary organ overseeing the army's performance
 of its many civil duties, then it is truly a powerful
 group.   The military men who were placed in control
 of the central and provincial government machinery
 during the Cultural Revolution are now being awarded
 equivalent positions of authority in the rebuilt
 party structure.   Thus, the leaders of the adminis-
 trative unit are in a position to exercise the major
 influence over the future makeup and direction of
 the party itself.   In effect, the levers of political
 control in China today are more highly centralized
 than ever before.

 SECTION IV:   THE FOREIGN MINISTRY
 In comparison with other party and governmental
 institutions in China, the Foreign Ministry is clearly
 a special case. In the first place, simply because
 of its functions, the Foreign Ministry receives much
 more exposure than other governmental units that are
 oriented primarily toward domestic matters.  More-
 over, as China has sought to resume more or less
 normal diplomatic contac4- since the ninth party con-
 gress in 1969, it has necessarily had to move faster
 in restaffing the various geographic and functional
 departments of this ministry.  As a result, much
 more is known about how it operates than any of the
 other governmental units.
 Most of the faces showing up in the ministry
 are familiar ones.   In nearly every case, positions
 in the key geographic departments are going to offi-
 cials with considerable field experience in their
 area of responsibility.  A similar trend toward
 professionalism has     eri evident in the men sent
 abroad by Peking since mid-1969 to replace the chiefs
 of missions who were recalled  in  early 1967 for Cul-
 tural Revolution "re-education."  As in the case
 with nearly every governmental unit, there are mil-
 itary representatives within the ministry--some of
 whom are ranked higher than vice foreign ministers.
 But none of them has been identified as yet with
 permanent t-ositions in the ministry.   In short, the
 professionals appear to control the actual opera-
 tions of the ministry.
 Except for a brief period in 1967, the Foreign
 Ministry was spared much of the political upheaval
 that afflicted so many other ministries.   In April
 of this year a successor was named to replace former
 Foreign Minister Chen I, but Premier Chou En-lai
 still handles most of the major responsibilities
 of the job.   The new minister, ranking deputy minis-
 ter Chi Peng-fei, is only "acting," however, sug-
 gesting that the question of who will ultimately
 run the show is still being debated.

 Minister
 Chi Peng-fei                  Chi, the ranking vice minis-

 SECTION V:   THE DISTAFF SIDE OF THE HOUSE
 The Cultural Revolution has witnessed the rise
 of the wives of the regime's two top leaders--Chiang
 Ching  (Madame Mao)  and Yeh Chun  (Madame Lin).   The
 wives of certain Chinese officials have always held
 high party positions--such as Premier Chou En-lai's
 wife Teng Ying-chao, who has been a member of the
 party central committee for years--but Chiang Ching
 and Yeh Chun are the first to have been brought
 into the elite politburo.  Although neither one has
 been identified in a specific party or government
 post, Chiang Ching continues to be active in the
 field of cultural affairs, and she may be given a
 formal position in this field, such as the minister
 of culture.
 The list that follows is by no means an ex-
 haustive study, but it does contain the names of
 those women who are currently making appearances
 at various meetings and diplomatic functions in
 Peking.
