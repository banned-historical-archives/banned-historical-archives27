 WORLD DRUG TRAFFIC AND ITS IMPACT ON
 U .S. SEC( IIITY
 TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1972
 l r.5.  SENATE,
 SUBCOMINEITTEN: To INVESTIGATE THE
 ADAIINls'reATION  OF THE  LNTESNAL  SECURITY ACT
 AND O'riin IN,mi-N L SECURITY LAWS
 OP THE ('ou]TITTEE oN THE JUDICIAr,Y,
 Washington, D.C.
 The. subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:55 a.m. in room 1202,
 New Senate Office Building, Senator James O. Eastland (chairman),
 presiding.
 Also present : J. G. Sou twine, chief counsel.
 The CIIAIRLIIAN. Time courmittee will come to order.
 We have convened this hearing today for the purpose of exploring
 the worldwide drug traffic anti more particularly its effect on the
 security of the United States.
 The dangerous and devious aspects of global drug traffic are fright-
 euing; and, when this menace of narcotics is translated into time terms
 of its impact on America and particularly on. our youth, it is even
 more frightening.
 Despite our every etfort to keep drugs out. of this country, illegal
 narcotics are coming in at arm alarming and ever-increasing rate. Our
 present antidrug apparatus has so far not been able to cope with the
 tremendous influx of drugs. in spite. of all we are doing to combat the
 flow of drugs, we are being overw lcelrned. The situation is critical.
 I am convinced that We are now losing- this battle; and if prompt
 decisive. steps are not taken, Ave, will most assuredly lose the war against
 drug's. America and our society as AA-v lcnoiv it is in serious and Imini.-
 nent danger.
 The studmy of global drug traffic is fascinating, but frightening. It
 is an extremely dangerous. highly devious and immensely profitable
 business: but only international criminals profit, while the world
 stands to lose.
 Drugs are threatening to undernrirre the very foundation of the
 American future our youth.
 To recognize the impact of drugs on the American scene--and par-
 ticularly on our young people--01W (reeds only to look at the most
 recent figures provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on
 crime in~ the United States. I am convinced that drugs are a major
 factor in this startling increase in crime in this country. We will sub-
 stantially reduce crime only when we substantially reduce the use of
 cl rugs.

 Lot us look at the figures concerning drug arrests for violations of
 narcotics .laws :
 Drug arrests increased eightfold in the last 11 years;
 Arrests for those under 18 were up by 30-fold, a staggering
 and startling 3,000 percent;
 Arrests for those under 1S increased five times faster than those
 over 1S:
 Drug arrests accelerated seven times faster than arrests for all
 offenses combined; and,
 In 1971, more persons were arrested on narcotics charges than
 for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault
 combined.
 Last year, nearly a half million persons were arrested on drug
 violations. More than half of these-52 percent-were under the age
 of 21, and almost a quarter of them--22 percent-were under 18 years
 of age. In fact, the largest number of those arrested were 17-, 18-, and
 19-year olds.
 To end the drug epidemic in this country, we must get to the source:
 world drug traffic. We must stop drugs at our doorstep, we must block
 the global routes of drug traffickers, we must put; out of business inter-
 national hoodlums who profit from drugs, and. we must dry up the
 sources. This will come only through cooperation-close cooperation-
 among the nations of the world.
 In this country, I am convinced that only through strong laws-and
 strong law enforcement-can we roll back the drug epidemic.
 This is a deadly serious situation. T7nless America can conquer drugs,
 drugs will surely conquer America.
 It is my hope that these hearings will accomplish two purposes:
 First, sound the alert to a complacent public by giving them the
 facts about a serious situation that threatens the well-being of every
 American: and, second, these hearings should point the way toward
 new and effective legislation that will enable the United States to meet
 and overcome this challenge of worldwide drug traffic.
 p  In Say of this year. the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee
 commisioned General Lewis W. Walt, retired Assistant Commandant
 of the Marine Corps. to direct a task force investigation of the world
 drug problem. General Walt personally visited 1.5 countries in the
 course of his investigation, and. on klrgust ]4, lie, testified on the situ-
 ation in Southeast Asia. Thursday morning he will be appearing before
 the subcommittee for a second time to complete his testimony on the
 world drug situation and what can be done to roll back the drug
 epidemic.
 Our elan, during 5 days of testimony, is to give an overall view of the
 drn(y situation and look closely at what can be clone to cone with it.
 Our first hearing today. "The Hashish Trail," will deal with the
 imnact of drugs on the individual.
 Our second hearing, "The International Connection," will describe
 the world of the drug traffickers and the machinery of drug traffic.
 In our third hearing, General Walt will present an overview of the
 world drag problem, and his recommendations for strengthening
 our controls at both the national and international level.
 In our fourth and fifth hearings, the heads of the four maior divi-
 sions of Government concerned with. drug control, will each report

 on the special role played by their agency in the war against drugs.
 Also, Dr. Olav Braenden, who has headed up the United Nations
 Narcotics Laboratory since its inception 16 years ago, will testify on
 certain aspects of current narcotics research.
 Our first witness this morning, Suzanne Labin, is a distinguished
 French writer, the author of 15 books. She may very well be the only
 Western journalist who traveled the full length of the Hashish Trail,
 from its'beginning in Western Europe to its end on the Indian Ocean,
 living with American and European young people, taking their life
 stories, and studying their progressive human degradation as they
 moved further along this infamous trail.
 General Walt, you may identify yourself.
 STATEMENT OF GEN. LEWIS W. WALT, U.S. MARINE CORPS
 (RETIRED)
 General WALT. I am Gen. Lewis Walt, U.S. Marine Corps (retired),
 and I have done a study for the committee, Internal Security Subcom-
 mittee, having to do with the international drug traffic problem.
 The CHAIRMAN. Now, proceed.
 General WALT. Mr. Chairman, this morning I would like to con-
 tinue our testimony by taking a look at the human side of the drug
 problem.
 Last June, you directed me to make a trip around the world, and I
 visited certain countries. One of the countries we visited was Afghani-
 stan. We stopped at Kabul. the. capital, for 1 day and 1 night. One of
 the most deplorable and saddening sights of my life I saw at Kabul in
 Afghanistan. I saw literally hundreds of hippie-type people, youth
 from many countries, especially from the United States, on the streets
 of Kabul. These young people. many of them, have come from as far
 west as Antwerp and Paris. They have come down through the Bal-
 kans, through Turkey and Iran, into Afghanistan. Some went up to
 Nepal, and some planned to go down into India, and so on. This trail
 through Europe and Asia has become known as the "Hashish Trail."
 I had heard about it, but I did not realize the meaning until I got
 to Kabul and saw these young people on the streets of Kabul, most of
 them very poorly dressed, very dirty, many of them very emaciated,
 due to the fact that they had not had anything to eat for a long time.
 They come in there and they live on drugs primarily. Then can do
 this, because the drugs in Kabul are cheap, relatively speaking. With
 hashish, they can sustain their addiction there on about 40 cents to
 60 cents a day, and when they have this much drug they do not care
 for food. They lose their appetite and they lose their weight, and get
 down to where they are just. skin and bones. These are the types of
 people I saw on the streets of Kabul.
 I tried to talk to them. They had a dullness about their eyes that was
 j list unreal. These were young American kids, 15, 18 years old. They
 are a tragic proof of what is happening as far as our drug addiction
 problem is concerned.
 Now, this morning, sir, we are very fortunate in having a witness
 who saw a lot of this. She followed this Hashish Trail herself for
 several months, and she has written a book about it. This book is a
 very interesting book. It is "Hippies, Drugs, and Promiscuity." That
 is the title of it. I have read the book, and I think anyone would enjoy

 Approved For Release 2005/04/27 :6C2IA-RDP75B0038OR000300070004-2
 reading it and would get an awful lot from it. It tells the story of these
 young Americans and other young people from other countries
 who take this trail and get hooked on these drugs, and to me it is a
 very important part of the testimony, because it does get, the human
 side. It shows what the drug addiction in the wvorld, the international
 drug traffic, is doing to the young people not only of America, sir, but
 to young people from Germany, England, and France and other coun-
 tries as well.
 It is a very sad story, but I think we are very fortunate this morn-
 ing, sir, in having Madame Suzanne Labin to give us details of this
 story.
 The Crr.~rn~rax. Identify yourself for the record.
 TESTIMONY OF MME. SUZANNE LABIN
 Mrs. ImovTN. Yes. I am Suzanne nLabin, a French writer and journa-
 list and lecturer.
 I have made IG around-the-world tours. and I have written 15
 books. I have been recently interested in the drug traffic because I
 met a lot of drug addicts in America, San Francisco. Los Angeles,
 New York, and 1 or 2 years after the epidemic spread into France,
 Italy and all Europe, and I learned about the "ITashish Trail."
 So I decided to make the voyage not only through Afghanistan,
 Kabul, and Nepal, through India, through Goa, but I have inter-
 viewed some hundreds of them, individually and in groups, in many
 countries. I have visited all types of places where they gather and
 studied their way of life. I have seen all degrees of intoxication, from
 light to lethal. I studied most of the existing literatures and research
 about drugs and hippies. I have discussed the matter with renowned
 specialists, physicians, psychiatrists, directors of rescue services, repre-
 sentatives of hospitals and the Red Cross, the Chief of the TT.S. Bureau
 of Narcotics in Paris. chiefs of the French Narcotic Squad, Ministers
 of Information, together with ambassadors and consuls in the capi-
 tals I have visited along the hashish Trail.
 I have a master of science degree in physiology and chemistry, so
 I understand the technicalities in of vved.
 The drug addicts I contacted can be analyzed in the following ways:
 Age: Most were below 30, the bulk between 19 and 25; many even
 under 15.
 Sex: Sixty percent were male: 40 percent female.
 Nationality : In all my around-the-world tours, 40 percent of the
 addicts were Americans. The remainder, in decreasing proportions,
 were English, Germans, Scandinavians, French, I)ntc}r, Australians,
 Italians, and Belgians. There were, on the whole Hashish Trail, no
 significant contingent from Spain, Portugal, Greece, or from Latin
 America, Asia. and Africa. Most of them were people, your people,
 white, from the Western Worl d.
 Social level: Eighty percent, came from- upper and middle class, 20
 percent from workers and families of lower income. None were farmers
 or peasants.
 Cultural level: Eighty percent of the r:?uuaways above 17 had at-
 tended college for at least 1 year.
 Now that you have a general background about the field, I will
 cover, together with my qualification to do it, my specific. experiences
 and the conclusions I derived from them.

 Mr. Chairman, now I will make a description of case stories.
 My first contact with this particularly tragic group was during
 the nights I spent in the police station of Ilollywood-West, once in
 1968, a second time. in 1970.
 Do you know, Mr. Chairman, in Los Angeles, the law forbids chil-
 dren under 16 to walk alone in the streets after 10 p.m.? During my
 nights in the police station, every 15 minutes the patrol cars brought
 in two to four teenagers who had been picked up drifting alone. Their
 pockets were full of all kinds of drugs. Some had run away from
 their families months ago.
 All these kids showed the characteristic dilated pupils, vacant stares
 of hashish smokers. Some already had the discreet but chronic cough
 of the marihuana addicts. All considered themselves advanced, su-
 perior to the sheep who followed the standards of backward school-
 masters and parents. Several whom f interrogated revealed that they
 had dropped out of school. The pictures of runaways, claimed by
 their families, covered whole walls of some police stations from floor
 to ceiling.
 Meanwhile, some years ago, there were only three or four pictures
 on these walls.
 A young boy appeared to be an expert trafficker already. In a note-
 book I discovered on him I read, with amazement, elaborate schemes
 about prospective new customers to contact, new drugs to test, and
 where to get them cheapest. Scrawled across a fresh page in a bold
 yet childish hand, lie had written "I must expand my empire." At 15,
 he had already lost his life.
 After this first and heartbreaking experience, I met teenage drug
 addicts all over the world. The most atrocious scene I witnessed in
 this respect occurred in October 1970, in a. high school for boys in
 I Ionolulu. There, one morning, more than 200 boys got stoned together.
 During the several days previous, they had been given free barbitu-
 rate pills by some. pushers at- the school entrance. 'T'hese we-re of a kind
 that produced bad trips and they were even more addictive than
 h.eroiri. 'T'he scene grew into sheer horror. The boys were running in all
 corners, shouting insane things with shrill voices, tearing their ga.r-
 nients to pieces, breaking evcr.ytliing, engaging in bloody rows.
 In Rome, Italy, I witnessed the police search of a so-called sports
 club for teenagers installed on a big boat oil the Tiber River and at-
 tended by 2,000 boys and girls from 20 high schools. Instead of ath-
 letic training. they were given drugs of all kinds and induced to have
 sexual intercourse.
 The reason for the extent of drug addiction among the teenagers is
 that the younger they are the easier they are influenced and the faster
 they become addicted. In addition, many teenagers are very clever
 and discreet auxiliaries of the traffickers. That is why the pushers
 eagerly cultivate that group of customers. They often organize free
 distribution of various drums-even heroin-in high schools and
 colleges. The chief of police I met in Manila documented that lie had
 caught some. And in Manila, f met President Marcos who told me the
 drug problem had reached a point of no-solution in his country, and
 his statement made the hea dl i nes in all the press.

 Ili many schools, principals have confirmed the fact to me that the
 boys are given drugs in the school.
 Also, to promote the drug habit among teenagers, the pushers have
 developed a variety of mini-drugs, such as banana skins. This has no
 intoxicating effect at all but by being taken in an atmosphere of
 clandestine initiation to artificial paradises, it encourages the kids to
 go on to the true drugs.
 During a smoke-in party in a park in Vancouver, Canada, I watched
 a man selling balloons to children under l2. He instructed them to
 sniff the Freon gas and get on a trip of several minutes. I saw one
 child after the other, from a long line, falling in the grass with the
 vertigo. I learned afterwards that this sniffing can cause death, because,
 the expansion of the gas freezes the lungs.
 Now, I will speak to you, Mr. Chairman, of the psychedelic
 churches.
 I want to mention the too little known phenomenon of the so-called
 psychedelic churches. The basis is in a decision of your Supreme
 Court.
 In accordance with the freedom of religion guaranteed by the U.S.
 Constitution, the Indians are allowed to eat the cactus called peyote,
 during their religious rituals as they have for centuries. Peyote
 contains mescaline, a hallucinogenic drug. From this ruling, the
 hippie leaders, realizing that the words religion and cult are not
 defined in the Constitution, concluded that taking drugs could be
 exempt from legal restraint by pretending that they are sacraments
 in a new cult, and to use the stratagem, they advised their followers:
 You must make a written "declaration of faith" stating that you use drugs to
 elevate your souls ; as part of a ritual of a new religion you have created, you
 put the declaration in a sealed envelope, send it to yourself, and keep it sealed.
 Your church can consist of no more than you and your girl with your bedroom as
 a temple. Should the police raid the place, you will open the envelope and prove
 that you were taking drugs as part of your religious ritual, and you could
 invoke the protection of the Constitution.
 This trick has worked pretty often. and was the basis for the
 creation of over a hundred pseudo churches. I thought, Mr. Chair-
 man, this loophole in your legislative  framework was  worth
 mentioning.
 Now, Mr. Chairman, I speak of my experience on the Hashish
 Trail.
 The most determined and most addicted hippies from the Western
 \ Torld set out on the famous Hashish Trail to India and its sur-
 rounding countries where they hope to find a world of their dreams,
 a world of mysticism, detachment from material things, long hair.
 bare feet, minimal dress, free housing and, above all, cheap drugs. A
 few affluent hipi)ies from the United States of America take planes
 and can land directly in India because they can produce a return
 ticket which is a necessary condition to get a visa. All the others, a
 ;neat majority, who do not have the money for a roundtrip ticket
 to India, must go to Afghanistan first and from there cross illegally
 into India. They travel mainly by hitchhiking in Europe, buses,
 lorries, and trains in Asia, often walking barefooted. When they begin

 this crusade there is flesh o,i their bones, and they enjoy outbursts of
 color, dance and music. When they arrive at the end of the trail far-
 away in Goa, they have turned, as we shall see, into silent., gray,
 meager, slow-moving spectres, awaiting only death.
 The route goes through Yugoslovia, Greece, Turkey and Iran. The
 hard part is Turkey where the police. are brutal, the cost of living
 high, where truckdrivers use to beat and rob their passengers and rape
 the girls and even the boys because of their long hair. In Ankara I
 met a desperate young American man who had just married a Dutch
 girl. His wife had boarded a different truck than he and she did not
 arrive and did not show up day after day. She had probably been
 sold to a Saudi-Arabian brothel from which no woman ever gets out.
 Many of these drug crusaders--more than is commonly thought-
 disappear during their travels, be it by death due to overdose and
 d isease, or be it by murder.
 A quarter of a million pilgrims have given up even before Turkey
 because of all the hardships or lack of money.
 In Turkey, another half abandon or fade away and most return to
 their countries, often even to their homes. Only the hardiest 25 percent
 get to Afghanistan.
 There the picture changes markedly. It is a place of rest where the
 many hippies gather. As a matter of fact, the Director of the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs assured me that his country had adhered to the
 U.N. Covenant of 1961 which prohibits drugs. And I have seen drug
 users arrested in the Cafe Keyber-although they were soon back.
 But the tabernacles of the drugs in Kabul are the rooms in a belt of
 fleabag hotels. All of them are open to anybody's visit and are crammed
 with hippies taking drugs from dawn to dark.
 Why is that tolerated so openly? Because a foreign diplomat
 whispered in my ear, "The hotels belong to local VIP's."
 A bed in a communal room of one of these hotels costs 30 cents
 daily; 20 cents if the hotel does not provide blankets; 15 cents for
 sleeping on a table, and 10 cents for sleeping on the floor. As food is
 cheap, the hippies can make it for $1.50 a day, including the price of
 dope which is 20 to 50 times less than in the 17nited States.
 By "room," Mr. Chairman, you must understand it to be four naked
 and dirty walls with a door, an obscure window, and a pale lamp.
 No furniture; no water; no toilet. In some there is a fireplace in the
 middle; the pipes go through the window. The hippies sleep mainly
 in their own clothes as long as they have not sold them.
 There, gentlemen and Mr. Chairman, is the drug paradise. There, on
 the bare ground inside the heads of those lost youngsters who have
 traveled 10,000 miles to compose that scene. There is where I found
 boys and girls of all types, from all our civilized countries, "Boys
 and girls?" Or should I say "a third middle sex," because they are
 nearly indistinguishable under their long greasy hair, their shabby
 pants, their loose shirts of faded colors, their stonelike complexion.
 Sexual intercourse is free; but. after Kabul it is rare because per-
 sistent intoxication by drugs slowly extingmslies sexual drive and
 power.

 In a minuscule room of the hotel Fez in Kabul. I found two blond
 handsome German boys who were spending their life lying on their
 bed and testing one mixture of opium and hashish after the other,
 deadly serious. The, two did not leave their room again. They had
 definitely drawn the curtain between the world and themselves.
 I was brought to this silent sanctuary of vacuity by a French lad,
 the son of a servant couple, who had escaped from the police in
 Marseilles and did not have a penny left. Ile was living as a parasite
 on the two German parasites. At the Hotel Noor, another room was
 occupied by five boys and one chap whose face was permanently bid-
 den by a vast peevish hat. The walking thin? never spoke nor seemed
 to understand what happened or what was happening all around. If
 there were degrees of vacuity, their eyes which sometimes appeared
 from under the hat, read absolute zero. Suddenly. that hatted shape
 proved to be a girl by undressing herself without knowing it. She
 was stoned practically all the time. And, Mr. Chairman, I can tell
 you that they were not taking only hashish or opium. but were taking
 all. classes of drugs, amphetamines, and barbiturates with asprin. They
 mix everything.
 In still another crowded room of the Ihuiiyan Motel, a Canadian
 with piercing eyes, acted as a chieftain. I was to learn later he was, in
 reality, an American deserter from the draft, who had procured a
 Canadian passport. lie offered me a white powder to play with in my
 mouth. I refused, of course, but the powder was instantly accepted by
 an English hippie. The Canadian, the only one constantly active,
 was surely a pusher. If the white powder was heroin, addiction could
 occur in 2 weeks; in 2 days, if it was cocaine. Nevertheless, all these ig-
 norant roommates put in their stomachs or in their veins whatever
 chemicals are offered to them without inquiring about the one who
 offers and without taking care of the most precious inheritance they
 possess : their brain.
 Dramas often occur. Another American lad--and, of course, I am
 speaking to you more of the Americans because I think you are
 interested in your boys, but there are many dramas among the French
 also. Another American lad, whom I rescued from starvation with
 some dollars, led me to his room where I met a young. anemic British
 hippie who was seeking, with large tired eyes, some remains of life
 and was coughing all the time. When I returned to the room some days
 later, I learned that lie had died the night before from an excruciating
 crisis of asthma, exaggerated by hashish. Nobody in the room had
 moved to call a doctor, who could have saved him easily, because all
 were hi glr on drugs.
 My French friend told me that a fortnight ago a girl had cut her
 veins to feel the magic intensity of the redness of her blood under
 LSD. Her blood whispered under her door all night, and in the morn-
 ing she was dead.
 Urgent middle-of-the-night calls to help a hippie who has swallowed
 an overdose are commonplace. Help corning too late is also common-
 place.
 Now, in Katmandu, Nepal, the general picture is the same, very
 cheap life and drugs in shabby bistros and rooms full of drug-takers
 from all Western. nations. One difference is that drugs there are legal.

 In a restaurant I had the shock of reading, printed in the menu,
 dishes like "Hashish Pudding,"' Marihuana Ice Cream."
 Dramas are also frequent in Nepal. I have seen bands of naked girls
 wandering around erotic temples by night.. A Belgian girl, Brigette
 Axel, suffered recurrent crises of LSD-wlricli means trips erupting
 spontaneously weeks after a first ingestion-which made her insane.
 As there are no psychiatric hospitals in Nepal. and insanity is con-
 sidered as the possession of the body by some demon, she was im-
 prisoned and finally chained because she became violent.
 A Swiss lady of admirable dedication, working with the Red Cross,
 searched out her family in Brussels. because there is no Belgian Em-
 bassy in Katmandu, Nepal, and her family sent enough money to re-
 turn Brigette by plane with a husky male nurse who watched her
 every move. Once cured, this girl of good education wrote a book
 telling her story, where you will find, from the begining to end, pas-
 sages like this one :
 "I. walk along the road. A long-haired Aumerican, plucking a, guitar,
 picks me up in a little used car. Lick Igas a good provision of shi.t''-the
 slang term for pot. "By night, I sleep with him in a community tent.
 The day after, Dick departs to Goa. I stay gladly because the place
 is full of shit. I proceed to Benares with Joan, a blond girl who fixes
 herself with heroin. On the way ww e hoard a little used car. In the back,
 Peter is plucking a guitar. Ile has lots of shit. I spend with him 2
 nights." And so on, and so on, ad nauseam.
 This excerpt shows well the vacuity of those hippies' lives. Notice
 that in Katmandu they are. surrounded by superior samples of -those
 natural beauties they claim to prefer to our jammed cities, and by
 marvels of art, not to mention the charm of fairy people living in a
 biblical style, having more temples than houses. Well, although sur-
 rounded by this fascinating human and natural scenery, most of the
 hippies remain packed-one should rather- say "burred"-in their
 dark, bad-smelling rooms and bistros. None of those I met has had the
 curiosity to inquire about the religion and mores of the Afghan and
 Nepalese peoples. The drug makes there indifferent to everything,
 unable to read, unwilling to walk a few miles to contemplate the in.
 credible Himalayas. Yet, they retain the ability to discuss between
 trips.
 An aspect of drug addiction which contributes strongly to make it
 attractive is the community life. 'Fiore appeal of that old utopia. is
 understandable, because all of those who run away from regular
 society soon feel the need for another society for mutual. help. In
 addition, many drugs are, taken collectively.
 Among the variety of comnnrnes which have been organized, the
 rural type received special publicity. It was presented as a model of
 a return to a nontechnological, hence "pure" and "poetic," way of life.
 Well, I have visited over a dozen of such agrarian communities of drug
 addicts in Honolulu, Vancouver, Europe, the Near East, and nowhere
 did I find any hint of bucolic style or virtues. I only found utter dirti-
 ness due to the laziness of drug addicts, and disputes about the work
 to be done.

 Above all, I found a perpetual. flux because these so-called "flower
 children" are, in reality, "butterfly children" with as few brains and
 as much instability as butterflies.
 Mr. Chairman, the hippie communities break up just as quickly as
 they gather and for reasons just as superficial. The groups cling to-
 gether and then fall apart just like the clouds in the sky and are
 nothing more than collections of lonely people. There is no hippie
 community in the proper sense of the word, only temporary bivouacs
 raised here in a whim and then set up elsewhere under another whim
 with other pilgrims. At the bottom, every pilgrim remains eternally
 alone. His companions-or rather should I say "his entourage"-are
 composed of electrons without affinity with each other, transitorily
 linked together by the pipe or the bed. No real friends, no real lovers.
 Those traditional links imply that the partners cultivate something
 together-even  though  it  be  commonplace--something  lasting;
 whereas, these drug addicts are not really looking for anything, for
 nothing to nourish the mind, nothing to warm the heart, nothing of
 any lasting value. Their inner visions are essentially fleeting and
 incapable of communication.
 Now, Mr. Chairman, I would speak of how these hippies survive.
 Although the hippie drug addicts, who form. 95 percent of this
 subculture, live very poorly, let us say on an average of $50 per month
 in the Middle East, they still need those $50. I investigated the impor-
 tant problem of how they manage to get them. Here is a list of their
 methods :
 1. The money they take with them when leaving, together with
 their belongings which they sell en route.
 2. Within Western countries they find plenty of surpluses.
 3. They beg on the streets.
 4. They sell their passports. An American passport in the Orient
 is worth $100.
 5. They sell their 'blood. This, they do in Europe as well as Asia.
 Sometimes their blood gets polluted by disease. It happened in Sweden,
 where for 3 months the blood bank closed its doors and serious surgery
 cases had to be shifted to Europe.
 6. They rob whatever they can, from statues in temples, to food
 and saris in popular markets; tourist cameras; curtains and carpets
 in embassies ; wrist watches and wallets from bedmates, and, of course,
 drugs from pharmacies.
 7. Above all, they turn themselves into drug dealers for newcomers.
 In Asia, the parasitic. character of the hippies struck me more than
 in the West, because of the tragic all-pervading poverty in Asian
 society. As a matter of fact, the hippies take their food from the have-
 nots; they rob the have-nots; they corrupt the have-nots because they
 spread among them the additional calamity of drugs. This is why the
 Hindu Government refuses to back these foreign tramps who bring
 a thousand new unsolvable problems with them, that add to the hun-
 dred of thousands of unsolvable problems the Government had on
 its daily agenda. In India, there are not enough 'houses, food, hospitals,
 medicines, prisons, without even mentioning the enormous surplus
 of beggars.

 So what can the Hindu authorities do with the hungry, ill, mendi-
 cant, thieving, or trafficking hippies? How can they tolerate the fact
 that these self-manufactured poor live on the very substance of the
 genuine poor? Don't these rich children, dressed up as indigents and
 who pretend to live upon nothing, insult the unfortunate who are
 dying from it?
 Mr. Chairman, I have to stress to you that the Western embassies
 are overwhelmed.
 The French Ambassador to Nepal, Mr. Francais, told me about a
 French girl who had been discovered by the agents of the consulate
 crawling on all fours. She had been carried to his office, and he realized
 that she had lost the control of her tongue and of her sphincters. She
 urinated on the Embassy's carpets. He was able to send her back to
 Paris where she will end her animal life in a psychiatric hospital
 because of the many drugs she. has taken.
 The ambassadors of France, United States of America, and Great
 Britain made me aware of the size of the problems. They receive every
 week from G to 15 long-distance calls from their respective countries,
 imploring them to find out about runaway children. But liow call
 they act efficiently? They have no budget to pay the detectives re-
 quired to search the cities unceasingly. They have no budget to buy
 return air tickets. When they get their money from the families for
 that purpose and they have fortuitously succeeded in spotting the de-
 linquent and putting him in a plane, said delinquent most often would
 fly away to Delhi, sell his ticket, and disappear. Besides, how can they
 convince the delinquent to return home? They have no power at all,
 neither of police, nor of justice, to enforce their plans. Only their
 government could do something, "but," said U.S. Ambassador Robert
 Neumann, "apparently they did not want to bother." "An embassy,"
 added Mr. Francais, the French Ambassador, "is neither a police sta-
 tion, nor a prison, nor a hotel, nor a bank, nor a section of the Red
 Cross." Therefore, peoples from our Western countries should be ad-
 vised that their representatives in the countries along the "Hashish
 Trail" practically cannot do anything to have the runaways go back
 home if the latter do not want it.
 Now, as to in Goa, at the end of the line : The most extremist hippies
 dedicated to drugs find the human climate in Kabul or Katmandu too
 noisy and they go further; they go to the bottom of India, at the re-
 mote Bay of Kalagute, near Goa. This golden sand beach is bordered
 by a beautiful tropical forest, and that is where the hard-drug addicts
 settle. I have followed these humans, gifted with reason, and who
 voluntarily embrace madness.
 There are huts scattered under the palm trees. One-third of them
 harbor native fishing families, the others harbor families of hippies,
 most of which do not include any women, but usually four or five
 young men living in chastity-drugs deaden the sexual drive. The
 hippies rent their huts for $4 a month. Since there may be from 4 to
 10 in a hut, the price per person is seldom more than u dollar. By the
 time the hippies arrive at Goa, most of them have lost all but two of
 their treasures-their hashish pipe and their long hair.

 General IVALT. Mr. Chairman, we would like to continue with the
 testimony of .Madame Labin on her experiences with youung people
 and drugs, with the youth, not only in this country, but internationally.
 I Ier experience took her along the "Hashish Trail," Burin which time
 for several months she actually lived with these young people.
 She got to know them. She talked with them. She tried to under-
 stand them, and as a result of this she has received a real insight into
 the drug problem insofar as the youth of our country, as well as other
 countries, are concerned. I would like now to introduce Madame
 Suzanne Labin to continue her testimony, sir.
 The cimm-iCAN. We would be very glad to hear from you.
 Mrs. LABIN. Mr. Chairman, I will continue my testimony..
 Thus, in this enchanted forest along the most inaccessible shores
 of India, I made my way from door-to-door to visit the most extreme
 of those who have rejected Western-style modern life.
 In the first hut 1 met an American young man sitting on the dirt
 floor with a. cat in his arms. Ile told one that, "MY cat loves to take
 trips with me," he said. "especially LSD trips." He told me that he
 believed in transmigration and that be, hoped to be a Siamese cat in
 his next life. So you see many of them have become a little crazy.
 In another but I found a: young French couple who were eager to
 share their ideas. After a while I noticed the girl's stillness. She had
 been lying on her mat, without moving for more than 2 hours. One
 could see traces of suffering on her features. Then I looked at her
 companion. Did the blood still course through his veins? He suffered
 infectious hepatitis.
 I suggested to them to go to the. bracing ocean air to recover health.
 But the young man said it had been ages since they had been to the
 beach. "It's only an Hour's walk," I said. The girl interrupted. "I
 can't walk. My legs are too painful."
 She unrolled the dirty cloth wrapped around her ankle. I was
 horrified. Here was the result. of the hippie pattern of drug injections.
 with needles washed by licking with the tongue. From the swollen
 masts of flesh, a mixture of blood and pus oozed, and with it, an odor
 of putrefaction. I had a feeling that the girl believed these open
 wounds would evaporate, if only she could show them to a tourist
 artIN-ing from the West ern World "corrupted by technological civiliza-
 tion and work," but which, nonetheless, knew something about the
 healing .of ills.
 In one especially dirty but, from which the garbage had not been
 removed for months, I was received by a household of three, com-

 posed of an American Israeli in a black skull cap, a cadaverous French
 woman in her thirties, and a very young Swedish girl. The first two
 had met in Israel and had a 9-year-old daughter.
 "Where does the child go to school '" I asked.
 "Nowhere," said the reran. To learn what ? False ideas of life, I don't
 want my daughter to have lien head stuffed with all that knowledge by
 the establishment."
 "Then, who teaches her to read and write. Her mother?"
 "Well, you see," the mother started, but he interrupted her in-
 dignantly : "No one. Must she learn to read and write-, to do the multi-
 plication tables, to be happy ? She is teaching herself the wonders of
 nature, watching the trees, the flowers, the butterflies, as she chooses.
 She does what who wants, without restraint. She is as free as a bird."
 Then, turning suddenly toward the child, who was about to put a
 pipe in her mouth, he yelled, "Don't touch that. I have told you a dozen
 times. And don't go too far from the house. Remember, 1'v-e forbidden
 you to go to the :beach alone."
 Quite a bit of interdictions for a child free as a bird.
 1 asked the family autocrat what, they did all the day.
 "What we do? Nothing," lie answered.
 "But there must be somethin- in that `nothing'."
 "I eat, I drink. I sleep. I smoke hush."
 "I mean, what do you do to nourish the spirit? Do you read?"
 "Never."
 "All right. You don't read, you don't play an instrunment, you don't
 paint. Then you travel? You visit the churches of Goa? You swim?
 You play cards? Have you a hobby?"
 They burst into laughter, as if 1 had made a bad joke.
 "We don't know how to swim. We can hardly tell a queen from a
 jack. Our church is this forest, and the trips we take are without
 moving, through LSD," the man told me..
 "Do you cook'?" I asked, almost desperately.
 "No. We buy our food already cooked from the Indians. They pre-
 pare it over their wood fires near their huts. It is too tiring to gather
 wood in the forest."
 "But where do you get the money?"
 "We make out."
 "But how ?"
 I couldn't draw them out further. Then, suddenly, the young Swed-
 ish girl appeared at the door, bright and healthy, wearing gaudy
 ornaments and pink cheeks. And I understood she had just left home
 with money and riches in hand, and the couple rented her the hut for
 more per week than they paid for it for a year. This is the supreme law
 of the clan : the old hands are supported by the novices, to whom,
 in compensation, they teach the ropes about the drug world.
 I watched five young men approach. There were two Americans, and
 again . I couldn't believe my eyes. Remember, Mr. Chairman, those
 starving people of Biafra not so long ago? Those hippies-wearing
 only loin cloths-reminded rue of them. Their thighs were no thicker
 than broom handles, which made their knees look like deformed
 protuberances.

 Their skin was stretched tight across their ribs. And in place of
 cheeks and eyes, there were deep, skull-like holes. They forgot to be
 buried. Yet they were in search of drugs, not of food. In the long
 run, the drug deadens all sensations. Abusers of hash or opium don't
 feel hunger, have no pain from ulcers, don't realize they are getting
 steadily weaker. They are wrapped in cottonwool, internally and ex-
 ternally. Pain is an alarm necessary to the survival of all animals.
 But drugs have broken their alarm system.
 Here, then, I have seen the end of the line. And I discovered that it's
 the entrance to the grave.
 Now, briefly, I will speak about the causes of the drug explosion.
 THE DRUG ExPLOSION : THE FALSE REASONS
 The drug explosion was so sudden, so unexpected, and so severe,
 that the first question arising in everybody's mind is: Why? Why on
 earth did it happen precisely in our time, precisely in the most de-
 veloped countries, precisely among the most privileed youth? I
 shall offer you the results of my own thinking about this' fundamental
 question.
 Let us examine the most popular false explanations of the phe-
 nomenon.
 The first explanation states that, the youth revolts and defies the
 establishment by taking drugs to protest social injustice. But social
 injustice was considerably worse 60 years ago, and no one confronted
 it with drugs. The main channel of protest was the socialist move-
 ment, and this was fully pledged to science, technology, rationalism,
 material well-being, sanctity of work, social planning, all in direct con-
 tradiction to the philosophy of the present, youth revolt.
 Why should mysticism and drug addiction have erupted when social
 justice had made tremendous advances'? And, why among the upper
 classes, not among the true victims of the said injustice? It's probably
 because there is not much ground left to make drama with the emanci-
 pation of the working class, so our hippies had to turn toward claim-
 ing emancipation from neckties, haircuts, and sex.
 A second explanation of the upsurge of drug addiction is that
 our society has become unbearably materialistic and greedy. A candid
 examination disproves this idea, too. Just consult the annals from
 past times, and you will realize how much cruder than today were the
 race for money, the venality of the officeholders, the concern for social
 status in marriage.
 Never, in the past, have states spent so hugely for sciences, arts
 sports, education, entertainment, research, and, last but not least,
 pleasures for the youth. Don't forget that the fantastic cost of cosmic
 travel is supported exclusively for the sake of knowledge. Don't
 forget that our adult generation, presented as being interested only
 in gadgets, calories, and TV watching, has endured cruel sufferings
 to fight against fascism for the highest ideal : Freedom.
 Don't forget that history has never seen the equivalent of the col-
 lective generosity embodied in the $250 billion in aid delivered by the
 rich nations, mainly the United States, to the poor ones. Besides, I
 find it odd to present as a reaction against our society's excessive self-

 A third explanation goes back to the uniformity and boredom pro-
 duced by our mass society. Here there is a gross misunderstanding. Our
 technology offers, indeed, to everybody the same set of keys to material
 life and entertainment. But those keys are so numerous that they open
 a much wider range of horizons than in any age before.
 it's like saying that Guttenberg uniformized culture because all
 writings got printed the same way. As a matter of fact, uniformity
 was more choking in older times. when the nobles could see only one
 and the same play every month, and the common man had only one
 and the same church sermon every week. Wealth and technology
 always work to enlarge, not reduce, the range of personal drive and
 initiative.
 A fourth explanation is that our youngsters rebel against too op-
 pressive family and social disciplines. This is too obviously the opposite
 of truth to deserve a lengthy refutation. Never has an existing order
 been so liberal, so open to all those who curse and undermine it, so kind
 toward all the fancies set up by its youth to defy it. The philosophers
 of the hippie-drug-New Left population only cry that this population
 is oppressed, in order to put around their head the aura of chain
 breakers.
 111 the reasons of the "Youth Revolt" we have reviewed have the
 common trait that they make the established order and the older gen-
 eration guilty for the drug explosion.
 I shall now try to demonstrate that, if our generation plays a part
 in the genesis of this plague, it's in the opposite direction; namely,
 that of having given too much without due preparations. If the hippie-
 drug-New Left complex can be considered as the embodiment of a crisis
 i n our civilization, it is a crisis of growth, not of decay.
 Consider, for instance, the torrential increase in the university popu-
 lation. It marks an expanding and liberal society, not a restrictive
 and privilege-minded one. But it has thrown so many youngsters into
 superior education that the newcomers became strangers in their
 modest and unsophisticated families, and they were ready to buy
 outside their families the romantic but hollow postures of rebellion.
 They formed the psychological proletariat I have mentioned earlier.
 Those families of the upper strata which do possess the culture to
 face their son's pretentious at transcendental novelties, are not willing
 to do it, because they have abdicated parental authority. The typical
 nor the the inner resources to force their offspring into a healthy way
 of life.
 Proposing a system of values to a boy is considered anathema,
 bigotry, intellectual oppression. Hence, the parents lock themselves
 into impotence when their children fancy to take drugs.
 General affluence multiplies the effects of moral permissiveness in
 families and schools. General affluence in society and ultraleftism in
 ideology has proved to be a major social explosive. In particular, it
 has unchained that old component of hiunan nature called laziness.
 One had forgotten it because for all the past centuries, which were
 poor and required hard work, the rampant biological laziness in us had
 been repressed by the tremendous power of moral censure, social pro-
 hibition, and material punishment. Today, all this age-old apparatus

 Approved For Release 2005/04/27: CIA-RDP75B00380R000300070004-2
 74
 to inhibit laziness has been broken by the triumphant trilogy I have
 mentioned. Permissiveness allows the child to let his laziness flow
 without being castigated; general affluence allows the lazy adolescent
 to survive even outside of his home; and ultraleftism allows him to
 appear not as a good-for-nothing, but as an interesting rebel.
 In other words, the adolescent has now available: The permission to
 display his laziness, the means to live without working, and the phi-
 losophy to turn his parasitism into a nice case of social revolt.
 But once laziness is given free course, the great problem becomes
 to occupy the passing time. Classical games and pleasures. like music
 and love, are quickly found insufficient. The only way is to forget time,
 to substitute the normal, extroverted life, which calls for activities,
 by an artificial, introverted life, with an unoccupied body. And the
 only solution, obviously, is drugs.
 This explanation accounts for some characteristics of the hippie
 drug phenomenon. Two other factors have contributed to give it its
 present dramatic size. One is the help it received from the establisli-
 rnent; the other is the big push received from the subversive forces.
 The so-called progresive intelligentsia has shed. through the mass
 media of communication, torrents of propaganda presenting the
 "hippie drug culture" with an interesting aura, as a pristine upsurge
 of our "advanced" youngsters, to enlarge human potentialities beyond
 the dull limits imposed by our ugly society.
 This propaganda, through press, books, lecture-. films. TV, maga-
 zines, songs, buttons, posters, mass rallies. and happenings, has reached
 much greater proportions than is commonly realized. The so-called
 underground hippie press has, in fact, an open circulation of millions
 of copies each week, most of which chant loudly the marvels of drugs.
 The record makers of the establishment have issued tens of millions
 of records alluding to the marvels of drugs. Such big hits as "Lucy in
 the Skv With Diamonds"-initials from LSD-"Freak out U.S.A.."
 "Day Tripper," are j ust a few in a long list..
 Tim Leary, although discharged from Harvard for having given
 LSD to his students, was kindly and respectfully interviewed by
 dozens of TV stations and reputable magazines of mass circulation. I
 have met dozens of school principals who refrained from repressing
 drugs in their establishments in order not to appear backward. And
 I can assert that this multifarious propaganda has been most respon-
 sible for the spread of drugs among the. youth, always eager to try
 something new, forbidden, but glamorous.
 In. France, the antidrug law forbids all forms of prodrug propa-
 ganda. But not in the United States, because of the too absolute inter-
 pretation of the first amendment. Justice Holmes once said that
 I`reedorn of speech does not permit one, to scream, "Fire, fire" in a, thea-
 ter, because that endangers the life of the people. But to propagandize
 in favor of drugs endangers the life of society much more.
 Yet, the courts of justice, intimidated by the formidable wall of
 sweetness built by the mass media around hippie subculture, have
 been extremely soft. They let all the prodrug literature and happen-
 ings, which I just mentioned, flourish without intervening.

 Remember that on September 23. 1966, a court of appeals dropped
 the charges against Leary stemming from his second arrest the pre-
 ceding April. The court ~v-as trapped by the justification given by
 Leary that LSD was taken as ,r religious ritual in the new church
 lie had just founded 4 clays before and called League for Spiritual
 Discovery, initialed after LSI).
 On October 12 of the same year, Leary was arrested a third time
 for having carried drags from Canada,'but he was released again.
 During all this time, lie held press conferences in the best clubs, cele-
 brated open services of his new church in a New York theater, orga-
 nized "Acid Culture Weeks" and LSD-sanctified marriages at his
 "Castalia Foundation."
 ,rh.is establishment, with 64 luxury rooms, in Milbrook, and regis-
 tered as a nonprofit organization, openly and loudly advised the
 young to drop out from school-winch is criminal under the laws of
 compulsory education-and to take one marihuana. trip each day and
 one LSD trip each week--which is criminal under the laws against
 drugs.
 Oil] ,v in March 1970. after hundreds of bad trips, some ending in
 death or murder or insanity. and due to Leary's propaganda for LSD,
 did a Federal court uphold his initial conviction for smuggling drugs
 from Mexico. Ile. got a 10-year sentence. And during the very display
 of all this leniency by the establishment, Leary was denouncing its
 "oppression" and described it as "being made up of old crabs physio-
 logically and mentally in the declining menopause age." And he earned
 a tax-free fortune from these denunciations.
 I think that, one of the most urgent and efficient ways to combat the
 drug explosion is to stop that abominable propaganda. It is absurd
 to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to repress a conduct which
 you permit to be glorified in 1(5) million words.
 A third type of help granted by the establishment to the spreading
 of drugs is that it lets free, and even snbsidizes, the centers organized
 by the hippies to assist dru  addicts. Rescuing people in distress,
 even when they are in distress .? from their own faults, is a principle of
 generosity, %A-hich a modern society must uphold. But that should be
 only the job of charitable organizations; while, in reality, the relief
 centers set up by the hippies are often also relays and sometimes
 strongholds of further drug use. They prevent the hippies who call
 on. them from returning horse, when they feel desperate, by giving
 them a new start with addresses of cheap hotels, free food, drug deal-
 ers. guides for LSD trips, et cetera.
 I might say that you can become addicted in 15 days on heroine, but
 it onlytakes2 days on cocaine.
 I shall give a look at the ties between the hippie drug movement
 and the various species of redact leftism and organized subversion.
 Not all the hippies are radicals. As a matter of fact, most of tile-
 run-of-the-mill hippies shy away from political, as well as from all
 organized, commitments. But all those who do indulge in some poli-
 ticking do it on the side of the extreme left. I was very struck by the
 fact during my world inquiries, that most of the missionaries of the

 7l
 hippie crusade did not, use drugs. They obviously wanted to keep cool
 heads in order to recruit the greatest number of prospective converts.
 The self-appointed Messiah I interviewed in a hippie community of
 San Francisco, who told me that "The saints of Christ are the new
 forces for the riots," was of that type. So, also, was a. British musician
 who led hippie bands in the streets of St. Germain des Prigs in Paris,
 who exquisitely explained to me that "Rock and roll, drugs, and com-
 munism are all of the same essence."
 So was the Canadian chieftain of the Hotel Bamyan, in Kabul,
 whom I mentioned earlier. So was an articulate, never-stoned Chinese
 chap whom I watched serving as director of conscience in the drug
 lodges of Nepal. All were fluent and clever to praise-to the. others-
 the drugs they never took, filling their environment with all the sub-
 versive slogans about current issues.
 The higher leaders of the "drug culture" are even moire tainted with
 the same political color. During the student strikes in Berkeley,
 Mario Savio welded together a coalition of hippies and left revoIl!-
 tionaries. Allen Ginsberg appears at public meetings at the side of
 Communist speakers and leaders of the "Fair Play for Cuba Com-
 mittee."
 The Canadian hippie leader. Daniel DePoe. adorns his headquar-
 ters with photos of Mao Tse-tung. The French hippie leader, Jean
 Claude Lamoureux, before dying from a heroin injection, printed
 a journal called, "The Red Mole." For all the underground hippie
 press, the only material you find, apart from hippie and drug items,
 is not discernible from the propaganda stuff of all subversive move-
 ments.
 And notice that the greatest guru. Timothy Leary, once escaped
 from jail, went straight to Algeria to offer his services to the Marxist
 revolution. An incident worth remarking here is that, in the end, Tim
 Leary was expelled from Algeria, which is in tune with the fol lowing,
 very revealing lines written by the Castroite publicist Susan Sontag,
 in the April 1969 issue of Ramparts. to defend Castro's stern interdic-
 tion of hippicism :
 The American new left is correct to be anarchic, because it is out of power.
 The freaky clothes, rock, drug, sex, are prerevolutionary forms of cultural sub-
 version and so you can have your grass and your orgy, and still be moral and
 revolutionary. But in Cuba, the revolution has come to power. and so it follows
 that such disintegrative "freedom" is inappropriate.
 Through this undisguised confession of Communist double play.
 Susan Sontag brought unwillingly to light a very important point;
 namely, that the pro-Communist leanings of those hippies who en-
 gage in politics are by no means normal. What naturally belongs to
 the hippie drug drives is a radical condemnation of the social order
 existing in the West.. But there. is no reason why this should entail
 applauding the Communist order of the East, in which all the vices
 denounced by the hippies are considerably more severe: Hard disci-
 pline. innumerable constraints. intensive labor, oppressive police,
 black censorship, rigid orthodoxy. and strict outlawing of drug addic-
 tion. with drug traffickers sentenced to death.
 There is, thus a paradox in the fact. that the hippies curse a demo-
 cratic society which treats them nicely and lets their horizons free,
 while blessing a totalitarian society which oppresses and enslaves

 inen. This paradox can only be understood under one assumption : that
 the hippies have been manipulated by the subversive propaganda
 machines.
 They are, indeed, easy to manipulate, because of their naivete and
 ignorance. As they are constantly at odds with the law, which pro-
 hibits drugs, they are bound to welcome the "kill pigs" campaigns of
 black extremist groups against the police. As they love peace and
 dislike violence, they are biased so as to swallow phony pacifist slogans
 used by the Communists to undermine the American resistance to
 Communist aggressions. In support. of what I have just said, let me
 make some quotations.
 The hippie press is full of ads publicizing antidraft unions. Their
 journalists advise the young to convince their draft board that they
 are either addicts, homosexuals, or incurable psychotics, or to throw
 a hysterical fit. Many ads offer obscene tatoos on the body, to avoid the
 draft. The "Sun," which boasts of specializing in "rock, drugs, and
 fornicating," write that guerrilla warfare ought to include the dy-
 namiting of police vans and recruiting offices.
 Jerry Rubin, who burned his draft card, wrote the following in
 his book, "Do It":
 time have mixed young people, music, sex, drugs, revolt and treason all together.
 What other combination would be as effective? . . . What we need is a genera-
 tion of bizarre, unbalanced, irrational people, obsessed with sex, angry, Irreli-
 gious, Infantile and crazy. People who burn their draft cards, who take marijuana
 and LSD, who proudly wave the Vietcong flag, who are not afraid to say obsceni-
 ties on television.
 To sum up, we see that all varieties of the leftist subversions had
 tried to capture the hippie-drug movement and to manipulate it.
 Now. let me attempt a general summary.
 Living with drugs :
 I have specially focused my investigations on the human-not
 clinical-angle. From that point of view, there are some main ques-
 tions bothering the public, which I had constantly in my viii cl. What
 are the risks of fatal accidents? Can the drug addicts be saved and
 return to a normal life? During their life under drugs, to what extent
 are the addicts degraded?
 Unfortunately, there is no unique, answer to these questions. All
 depends, in complex ways, on the. nature of the drug. the age and
 health of the one who takes it. the way he does it-orally or by injec-
 tions, with or without hygiene, by strong or moderate doses, and
 frequency.
 But what I am sure of is that, whatever the circumstances, the
 answers to the preceding questions are rather dramatic. Not in the
 sense that all drub addicts necessarily end in premature death. With
 nonphysically addictive drugs like hashish, LSD, soft amphetamines-
 in most cases the young person finally escapes and goes back to normal
 life. But he may remain deeply handicapped. with broken health,
 diminished mental and sexual power-this latter is often definitely
 gone-and the sequel of so many years entirely lost for study or
 professional training.

 7S
 But before being saved by a return to normal life, the drug addict
 may have been victim Of a fatal accident. By "fatal accident,"' I under-
 stand any of the following hazards : serious and chronic illness, and/or
 incurable insanity-leading to life con fined in an asylum; suicide,
 and other forms of violent accidents provoked by `bad trips," such as'
 people throwing themselves out of the window becaltse they think they
 can fly; or engaging in bloody fights. And, finally, direct death as a
 consequence of overdoses, or exaggerated frequency, or bad quality of
 the drug.
 My personal feeling is that the rate of those fatal accidents is not
 negligible with cannabis, is significant with met.hedrine, and is im-
 portant with LSD.
 If, now, we go to the so-called "hard" drugs----opium, heroin, co-
 caine-the outlook becomes still. gloomier. And don't forget that great
 numbers of addicts of the so-called "soft" drugs escalate to the. "hard"
 Ones.
 The risks of fatal accidents with. the latter are greater and the pro-
 portion of the addicts who escape from the hard drugs and save them-
 selves drops to no more than :i to 10 percent. And t Bose who do return
 to normal life evince serious damage.
 And what about those who do noi drop out, and go on taking drugs
 permanently? ?W hat is their life expectation-excluding the, cases of
 fatal accidents? What is the degree of degradation, afflicting them
 (hiring their lifespan ? Here, again, it is impossible to give definite
 figures because of the wide variety of circumstances which can change
 the picture.
 Robust abusers of cannabis may reduce their life expectancy by
 some 10 years; weak ones by as much. as 20 years and, while living
 under cannabis, they lose something like half of normal human abili-
 ties. With systematic LSD-not interrupted by fatal accidents-these
 abilities are nearly 100 percent lost during trips. and between trips
 may get restored or stay partially reduced, depending on what brain
 cells have been clamaged. ('hroniosomes are often badly damaged.
 The moderate. regular, well-living taker of opium may live 40
 Years; an immoderate taker only 20 years. with a steadily increasing
 degradation reaching practically 100 percent in the last years.
 Systematic heroin and nrorpliine addicts rarely survive more than
 1;i years, during which they are heavily degraded. Permanent. cocaine
 use leads to a still shorter lifespan and leads rapidly to insanity.
 are there benefits to he- gained f rom drugs ?
 I think this summary fully supports the overall conclusion that all
 drug addiction entails ddramatic damage. There is absolutely no ground
 for the light dismissal of the issue, as you so often find in the writ-
 ings of a number of commentators. Some go further than this, treating
 the whole drug affair as one more sweet, folly of our imaginative
 youngsters.
 These so-called "Liberal" writers, in order to feel themselves "ad-
 vanced," assign our concern abort drug's to a reactionary tendency
 to repress the free development of all human potentialities. Even
 granted some bad efects, they say, that is the price you pay for getting
 your consciousness enlarged, and open to transcendent truths.
 I can assure You emphatically that I have seen not one single bit
 of new potentialities developed by any of the hundreds of drug addicts

 I met. Even when I was told by them about their inner visions, the
 miracles they claimed to have experienced boiled down to futile, in-
 consistent, if highly colored, hallucinations. These visions remain far
 inferior to the marvels which can be apprehended by a well-awakened
 and trained natural consciousness. combining refined sensation with
 alert. thinking. Drugs do not enlarge consciousness; they disrupt it.
 As for new transcendent truths, where are they? What are they?
 Notice that over the last H years, there have been millions of well-
 educated white men taking drams-souse pretty bright before their
 addiction--and you cannot find, stemming from any of these, one
 outstanding work or great achievement,of any kind in any field made
 under drugs.
 and the same applies to all those who have taken drugs through
 past centuries. This sterility of the mind governed by drugs is all the
 more striking when you compare it with the extraordinary fertility
 of human minds governed by their natural consciousness. Plato, Archi-
 medes, Copernicus, Galileo, lienibrandt., Michelangelo, Shakespeare,
 Newton, Beethoven, Kant, Iinsteiir, and so on, have left us a glitter-
 ing gallery of philosophic, scientific, and artistic gems, and none of
 them had taken either hashish, nor L 1), nor heroin.
 Physically, all prolonged chrug abuses end up in ruin. The euphoria
 brought on by the drugs-the famous artificial paradises-are always
 short lived and never gratuitous. In the long run, regular use of all
 drugs corrodes and disrupts both body and mind. At first, they charm,
 like the beuatiful face of Circe, but in the end they show their hideous
 head of Medusa.. Then. comes the desire to continue, experienced by
 all takers, and the physical and psychic addition rapidly becomes an
 all consuming passion, which deprives the individual of his own free
 will.
 All of the drugs, after long usa~ye, undermine the two principal
 pillars of all civilizations: in the realm of the mind, the power of
 reasoning; and in the realm of the soul, the will. Without the ability
 to think about the universe in a positive way, and without the impulse
 to act ,on it, there is no longer room for great works and, hence, there
 is no more real culture. That is why, should the use of drugs become
 permanent and universal, as the hippies demand, it would lead to. the
 ruin of all human civilizations.
 But, unless we, abdicate in total passivify before, the hippie-drug
 explosion, f do not, think that it can destroy our civilization. The deep
 reason is that the foundation that, umder,girds hippieism is, in reality,
 marked with the seal of impotence. It can deceive you for a while,
 because we have come to believe that every revolt is a step forward.
 But there are also reactionary revolts, and the hippie one belongs to
 this class, in spite of appearances. It. is reactionary because its goal
 is to destroy, beyond the established order, the. only spirit that has
 ever made humanity advance: the. spirit of enterprise.
 This spirit of enterprise, which was born 20,000 years ago, and was
 baptised 350 years ago by the great Galileo, will nevermore disappear
 from the human seen(,,. It has built too many powerful and splendid
 pillars. It will probably be given nobler objectives, a more glamorous
 outlook, but. it will never be. replaced by the spirit of nothingless. That's
 why we ought not to yield to panic before this wave of nihilism,
 which foams at the foot of our towers, and of which the hippies are

 the unfortunate troubadours. Our towers will resist because this
 wave, because, although it is powerful today, it has neither engine nor
 compass to get very far.
 Just open the door of a drug den in Katmandu, and the Messianic
 theories of the hippie prophets blow away like a current of air. From
 the vision of these prostrate children, the reality of the hippie's life
 jumps to our eyes and grips our heart. It is self-destruction, the
 symbol of defeat.
 The hipppes and their drug prophets had ambitious pretentions.
 They wanted to become the social pilots of our tine-and here they
 are, its tramps, in the process of becoming its corpses. Here they are,
 lost and dirty, along the roads they wanted to flourish.
 Here they are, without any deep affection, they who wanted to
 teach us love. Here they are, without ideas, they who pretended to
 rejuvenate ours. Here they are, without a future, without It profession,
 without interest, their eyes empty, whether they turn them toward
 their inner world or toward the outer world.
 Who could really imagine that they will build it new culture with
 that empty gaze.
 Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much.
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
 Mr. SOrRWINE. Madam Labin, I just have one question to ask. If I
 heard you correctly this morning, you testified that some of the hippies
 on the Hashish Trail sold their passports. How do you know about
 this?
 Mrs. LAmIN. Because I know the parents of many children in
 France who have returned and said, we have no more passports.
 Further. they said they have lost them. And after they investigate,
 they find that they have sold their passports. That has been told to me
 by three or four parents in France.
 Second, the American Ambassador, the French Ambassador told
 iimme that nearly every week they have hippies coming to them, to the
 Embassy, saving that they have lost their passports. The embassies
 have told me that they know that they are selling them.
 Mr. SonRwncE. Thank you.
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Madame Labin.
 We will be in recess now until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.
