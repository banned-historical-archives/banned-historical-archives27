COMMUNIST CHINA'S POWER POTENTIAL THROUGH 1957 
THE PROBLEM 
To estimate the political, economic, and military development of Commu-
nist China through 1957. 
CONCLUSIONS 
1. The Chinese Communists' have as 
their long-range goal the development of 
a Soviet-style state in China, with its own 
bases of economic and military strength, 
and dominant in eastern and southern 
Asia. To this end they will proceed, as 
rapidly as possible, through the forced 
and ruthless measures characteristic of 
Communist regimes, to reorganize the 
social structure along Communist lines, 
improve the effectiveness of the adminis-
trative system, and develop the economy 
to the extent feasible. The regime will 
devote substantial resources to modern-
izing and strengthening its armed forces 
as a power base for its foreign policy. 
2. Although the Chinese plans for eco-
nomic development are not known in 
detail, it appears that these plans com-
template an increase in total output in 
1957 to 20-25 percent above the 1952 level. 
Emphasis is placed upon increasing the 
output of the modern industrial sector, 
particularly heavy industry and trans-
port. Fulfillment of the regime's eco-
nomic plans depends upon increasing 
lExcept where otherwise indicated explicitly or by 
context, "China" and "Chinese," as used here-
after, refer to Communist China and the Chi-
nese Communists. 
agricultural output while rigorously re-
stricting consumption so as to provide 
the resources needed to support the in-
dustrial investment and military pro-
grams. A large part of the capital goods 
needed to fulfill the program will have to 
be obtained from the rest of the Soviet 
Bloc in return for Chinese exports. Avail-
able resources will have to be efficiently 
allocated to ensure that crucial sectors 
of the economy, such as transport, meet 
the demands generated by increasing 
production. 
3. Barring a major crisis or other un-
predictable event, we estimate that China 
will have attained by 1957 a gross nation-
al product of roughly US $32 billion, an 
increase of 20-25 percent over the '1952 
figure. We estimate that agricultural 
output will be about 10 percent higher 
than in 1952, and the output of the mod-
ern industrial sector of the economy 70-
100 percent higher. The increases in in-
dividual industries (including transpor-
tation) will of course vary widely from 
this over-all rate of increase. Even by 
1957, however, the Communists will only 
have begun the modernization of China's 
economy. The country will as a whole 
remain agrarian and underdeveloped.

4. We believe that by 1957 the Chinese 
regime will have increased its adminis-
trative efficiency and have further tight-
ened its control over its people and re-
sources, but the regime will not have been 
able substantially to alter traditional so-
cial patterns or to obtain more than pas-
sive acceptance from the bulk of the pop-
ulation. However, we believe that the 
regime's ability to direct and control 
China will not be significantly impaired. 
Furthermore, we believe that the regime 
will be able to master leadership prob-
lems that are likely to arise, even in the 
event of the death or retirement of Mao 
Tse-tung. 
5. The internal control and the interna-
tional power position enjoyed by the 
Communist regime rest largely upon the 
power potential of China's military estab-
lishment, at present the largest of any 
Asian nation. We believe that the mili-
tary establishment will gain in strength 
and effectiveness during the period of 
this estimate through the regime's pro-
gram of modernization and training. 
Soviet assistance will continue to be es-
sential to the fulfillment of this program. 
6. We believe China's dependence on the 
USSR will not be significantly lessened 
during the period of this estimate, and 
that maintenance of the alliance with 
the USSR will continue to be a dominant 
aspect of China's foreign policy. The 
Communist Chinese regime will continue 
to consolidate its political position, to 
gain in economic and military strength, 
and by 1957 will be a more powerful force 
in world affairs than at present. Cer-
tain aspects of China's development will 
be used to support claims that time is 
on the Communist side in Asia. China's 
increased power and prestige will present 
a challenge to the influence of the West-
ern nations in Asia, and to the Asian 
leadership aspirations of India and Ja-
pan. 
DISCUSSION 
I. INTRODUCTION 
7. Since their assumption of power in 1949, 
the Chinese Communists have, with Soviet 
assistance, built up a powerful military estab-
lishment. The Communists have undertaken 
a political and social revolution of vast pro-
portions, and they have virtually eliminated 
effective opposition. They have largely re-
habilitated and established control over the 
country's economy. 
8. The Communist regime has accomplished 
the foregoing in, the face of serious obstacles 
and at great economic and human cost. In 
1949 the regime was confronted by widespread 
economic disruption, and general weariness re-
sulting from 12 years of virtually continuous 
war. The regime has had to impose its will 
on 500,000,000 Chinese people and over an 
area approximately as large as the US, Mexico, 
and Alaska combined. The bulk of the people 
are illiterate; communication and transporta-
tion facilities are rudimentary or inadequate 
in many areas. Formidable problems must 
still be overcome before the Chinese reach the 
ambitious goals set by the regime. 
II. PRESENT SITUATION IN CHINA 
9. The Chinese Communist regime has under-
taken to create an industrialized and mili-
tarily powerful state. At present, the energies 
of the regime appear to be devoted to the 
consolidation and expansion of China's eco-
nomic strength, modernization of military 
forces, and the transformation of China's 
political and social structure. To these ends, 
the regime is creating a more effective admin-
istration of government, intensifying its con-

trols, and undertaking to eliminate or neu-
tralize institutions or individuals which stand 
in the way of its goals. 
Political Development 
10. Administration and leadership. The Chi-
nese Communists have adapted Soviet admin-
istrative and political institutions and tech-
niques to Chinese conditions. The highly 
centralized and dictatorial government has 
instituted effective measures to suppress tra-
ditional regional, clan, and ethnic loyalties, 
and has imposed a unitary state structure 
with direct lines of command down to the 
village level. 
11. Ultimate power in China resides in the 
Communist party and is vested in the Political 
Bureau (Politburo) of the Party's Central 
Committee. Under Mao Tse-tung's leadership 
each of the five principal members of the 
Politburo appears to have certain general 
areas of responsibility, in addition to collective 
responsibility in the Politburo: Liu Shao-c'hi, 
party affairs; Chou En-lai, operation of the 
government; Chu Teh, military; and Ch'en 
Yun and Kao Kang, economic affairs. 
12. The decisions of the Politburo are trans-
mitted through a governmental structure pat-
terned on that of the USSR. (See Chart I.) 
The highest place in the governmental struc-
ture is reserved for the All China People's Con-
gress, a body to be chosen by national elec-
tions now promised for 1954. Until this event 
takes place the top governmental body is the 
Central People's Government Council, headed 
by the Chairman (Mao Tse-tung) and six vice-
chairmen. To bolster the fiction that the gov-
ernment is a coalition, three of the six vice-
chairmen are "democratic personages" repre-
senting other political groups such as the 
Chinese Democratic League and the Kuomin-
tang Revolutionary Committee. The princi-
pal administrative bodies ? the Government 
Administration Council and the People's Revo-
lutionary Military Council ? are nominally 
responsible to the Central People's Govern-
ment Council. However, since the principal 
members of the Politburo are also members 
of these administrative bodies, the authority 
of the Communist party is brought to bear 
directly upon the administration of the state. 
Decisions made by the national authority are 
implemented in each of the administrative 
regions of China by a regional organization 
composed of party, government, and military 
organs. A similar pattern of integrations of 
party and government is repeated down to 
local government level. 
13. Chinese leadership is marked by the co-
hesion and stability of the party elite. The 
Communist leaders have been closely knit by 
their common experience in revolution and 
war since the party's founding in 1921. As in 
any group, however, there have been rivalries 
for power in the past and some almost cer-
tainly exist at present. Party pronounce-
ments such as the February 1954 warning by 
the Central Committee on existing dangers to 
party unity suggest the existence of differ-
ences and rivalries, and there are hints of the 
existence of ill-defined groupings about Liu 
Shao-ch'i and Chou En-lai. There is no firm 
evidence, however, of clearly established fac-
tions among the upper echelons. There have 
been no major purges in the past 16 years. 
14. The precise manner in which Soviet influ-
ence or control finds its way into Chinese 
policies is not known. The USSR apparently 
treats its Chinese ally with deference. Soviet 
advisers almost certainly are in contact with 
the highest level of Chinese party and govern-
ment leadership, but we do not believe that 
these Soviet officials issue direct orders. We 
believe the USSR is able to exert influence over 
Chinese policies primarily by virtue of their 
common ideology and China's economic and 
military dependence on the USSR. 
15. Political Controls. The Communist re-
gime has vigorously and ruthlessly set about 
establishing political control over the Chinese 
people. To do this, it has employed a wide 
array of programs, ranging from inducements 
and patriotic appeals to coercion and terror. 
16. The Chinese Communists have developed 
an elaborate system of persuasion, involving 
social, economic, legal, and psychological 
pressures, and the operations of an extensive 
and highly coordinated propaganda appa-
ratus. The Communists have sought to in-
still in the people a sense of participation in

the "new China" and, through exaggerated 
claims of China's military and diplomatic 
accomplishments, to stimulate Chinese na-

pressed by the regime's achievements. Other 
important and energetic elements of support 
are found among members of the armed 
forces, government workers, skilled industrial 
workers, and a considerable proportion of the 
women. 
18. Through terror and force, the Commu-
nists have eliminated the landlord class and 
thousands of businessmen, professionals, and 
former government officials. There is no evi-
dence of significant organized resistance to 
the regime. To insure its control, the regime 
has established extensive security and police 
forces in addition to the army. In addition 
to these organized forces, the regime's ability 
to ferret out dissenters has been augmented 
by a pervasive system of vigilance committees 
and volunteer informers. 
19. However, much of the voluntary support 
the regime received in 1949 has been dissi-
pated. The regime's coercive measures have 
created an atmosphere of fear among many 
segments of the population. Many Chinese 
have probably become increasingly suspicious 
that the USSR is encroaching upon China's 
sovereignty. In some instances, strong ad-
verse reactions have resulted from attacks on 
religious and traditional institutions. In-
creased taxation and- regimentation have 
caused an adverse reaction among the 
farmers. Dissatisfaction has arisen among 
workers as a result of the failure of real in-
come to rise. Merchants and petty shopkeep-
ers are resentful of heavy taxes and govern-
ment competition. Dissatisfaction has grown 
among intellectual and professional groups as 
4 
a result of the drop in their living standards 
and of the regime's unrelenting pressure 
toward literal conformity. 
20. However, such dissatisfaction as now 
exists in China has neither the universality, 
the intensity, nor the physical means by which 
to transform itself into effective resistance. 
Economic Situation 
21. China is an underdeveloped agricultural 
country with a population of 500 million. 
China's estimated gross national product of 
approximately US $27 billion 2 is less than one-
third of Soviet and about one-fourteenth of 
US GNP. China's per capita gross national 
product of roughly US $54 is about equal to 
that of India but only about one-quarter that 
of Japan. While there are the beginnings for 
a modern industrial development the present 
contribution of the industrial sector to total 
output is small. The regime faces a formida-
ble task in achieving its long-term goal of a 
modern industrialized economy. To accom-
plish this, the Communists are developing 
their organization for planning and for con-
trolling the economy. 
22. As in any planned economy, the national 
budget is the major instrument for channel-
ing resources to implement the regime's pro-
grams. By 1952, the Chinese national budget 
had risen to about a third of the gross nation-
al product, a substantially lower proportion 
than in the case of the USSR. The two most 
important categories of budget expenditures 
during this period have been military outlay 
and capital investment. (See Chart II for 
breakdown of the budget.) 
23. In 1949, when the Communists undertook 
the task of rehabilitating and expanding the 
Chinese economy after 12 years of wartime 
disruption, production was extremely low. 
At that time, the production of electric power 
was only about two-third's of the peak pro-
duction under the Japanese, coal roughly two-

'Estimates based on 1952 data are used generally 
throughout. Changes since 1952 are believed not 
to have altered the general order of magnitudes 
or the relationships.
