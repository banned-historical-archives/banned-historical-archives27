 After marking time for nearly five years, Communist China again is expanding its
 presence in Africa. Since October 1970, five African governments have established diplo-
 matic relations with Peking. When the two others now in the process do so, the Chinese
 Communists will  be ahead of the rival Chinese Nationalist regime in the contest for
 recognition. When the UN General Assembly voted to admit the People's Republic of China
 to the world body, Peking, received most of the African ballots. Along with these diplomatic
 gains, there has been a considerable increase in Chinese economic aid_to African nations.
 Transforming such short-range political profit into long-term influence will depend on
 a number of factors: the effectiveness and continued generosity of Peking's economic aid,
 the ability of the Chinese to allay African fears of subversion, conditions and events within
 Africa, and Peking's ability to find issues on which China and the African regimes can unite.
 China .undoubtedly will continue to give priority to its relationships with the US, the USSR,
 Japan, and Europe, but in Peking's effort to alter power relationships in the world, Africa
 has a definite, if limited, part to play.
 The Early Years
 Africa first attracted the attention of the
 Chinese Communists in the mid-1950s, when the
 European powers came under increasing pressure
 to_ grant independence to their colonies. Taking
 advantage of the surge in African nationalist senti-
 ment, .Peking stressed its opposition to imperial-
 ism,  offering  moral  and, on occasion, material
 support  to  African  national  liberation  move-
 ments.  In  May  1956,  Egypt's  President Nasir,
 sensing a potential source of support in his devel-
 oping dispute with Britain and France over the
 status of the Suez Canal, became the first ruler on
 the African continent to recognize Mao's regime.
 Peking's aid to the nationalist rebels in Algeria
 paid off  in  1962 when the newly independent
 government- established diplomatic relations with
 China.
 Peking's efforts to assert itself as a revolu-
 tionary model  for African  independence move-
 ments and to forge diplomatic, economic, and
 political ties with the more radical of the newly
 independent  African  states  set  the  stage  for
 increased  competition  with the USSR, and, as
 Sino-Soviet differences widened during the 1960s,
 rivalry for influence in Africa increased. Peking's
 attempt to preserve its ideological purity and out-
 bid  Moscow  in  revolutionary  appeal, however,
 soon adversely affected Chinese diplomacy. Once
 in  power,  most  African  nationalists, who wel-
 comed Chinese political and material aid during
 their  struggle  for  independence,  gave  a  chilly
 response to the Chinese cries for continued social
 revolution that Peking felt compelled to sound as
 part of  its contest with Moscow for ideological
 leadership of the Communist movement.
 Nevertheless,  as  an  increasing  number  of
 African colonies gained independence during the
 early 1960s, China stepped up its efforts to gain
 influence,  mainly  to  match Soviet moves. The
 Chinese were also trying to counter the rival over-
 tures of the  Nationalist  regime on Taiwan and
 reduce US influence on the continent. As Chinese
 diplomatic  missions  on  the  continent  grew  in
 number, a  modest foreign  aid  program was in-
 augurated  to  woo  African  governments  and
 enhance Peking's prestige.  High-ranking Chinese
 leaders, such as Premier Chou En-lai and Foreign
 Minister- Chen I, made personal tours in Africa.
 African delegations were encouraged to visit Pe-
 king, and promising African revolutionaries were
 cultivated  and  occasionally  given  training  in

 China. By 1965, 15 African countries had diplo-
 matic relations with Communist China.
 Starting in  1965, China's steady, if modest,
 progress in Africa began to slow down. African
 leaders resented Chinese efforts to use them as-
 political weapons in the widening quarrel between
 Peking and Moscow., A major reason for the can-
 cellation of the Afro-Asian conference planned
 for Algiers in 1965 was the desire of many Afri-
 can leaders to avoid association with any Chinese
 effort  to  turn  the  meeting  against the USSR.
 Peking's  doctrinaire  support  of  revolutionary
 action  cast  suspicion  on  its  motives.  In some
 cases, such as their backing of the radical  Lu-
 mumba and Mulele uprisings in the Congo (now
 Zaire), the Chinese appear to have overestimated
 the  revolutionary  potential  of  the  situation.
 Revelations-some of them concocted-of Chinese
 complicity  in subversion aimed at overthrowing
 independent  regimes,  as  in  Burundi,  alarmed
 many African  leaders.  Close Chinese ties with
 such national leaders as Ghana's Nkrumah meant
 that  when  those  leaders  were  ousted, Chinese
 influence suffered.
 Peking also discovered that diplomatic ties,
 modest  Chinese economic  aid,  and  ideological
 rhetoric were no match for the larger amounts of
 economic and military assistance available to Afri=
 can governments from Moscow and the West. In
 Algeria, for example, Peking was unable to com-
 pete with the large Soviet military and economic
 aid commitment. Nor was the prospect of Chinese
 political support on international issues attractive
 enough to win over more African regimes: Peking
 lacked the superpower status and political punch
 of the US or USSR.
 African uneasiness over Peking's policies in-
 creased with the unfolding of the Cultural Revo-
 lution. The Chinese at that time appeared almost
 completely engrossed with domestic concerns and
 presented an image of internal instability. All of
 China's ambassadors, with the exception of the
 one  in  Cairo,  were  called  home.  In only one
 instance,  however,  was  there  a  break  in
 diplomatic relations between  an African nation
 and Peking during the most tumultuous stage of
 Special Report
 the Cultural Revolution. In 1967, after Tunisian
 complaints  about Chinese propaganda activities
 .and Chinese accusations that Tunsia wished to
 wreck relations, Peking closed its embassy. Peking
 was otherwise generally able to isolate its basic
 interests in Africa from the effects of the up-
 heaval, 'although Chinese prestige and  influence
 undoubtedly suffered. The major effect of the
 Cultural  Revolution in Africa was to curtail the
 extension of new Chinese economic aid and to
 put a moratorium  on further expansion of Re-
 k i n g's  diplomatic  relations.  After  Mauritania
 recognized Communist China  in July  1965, no
 other African government entered into diplomatic
 relations with Peking for over five years.
 In 1969, the restoratiori of order at home
 and the adoption of a more pragmatic and flexi-
 ble approach to foreign policy laid the ground-
 work  for  a  renewal  of  China's  campaign  to
 increase  its  presence  and  influence  in  Africa.
 Chinese  ambassadors  began  returning to their
 posts. Peking's economic effort on the continent
 was given new impetus; in 1970, China extended
 $452.8 million in new economic aid to African
 regimes, far exceeding its previous aid to Africa.
 The commitment to finance and build the Tan-
 zania-Zambia railway accounted for most of this
 total ($401.2 million), but Guinea ($10 million)
 and Sudan ($41.6 million) were given a slice of
 the pie. Continuing  its version  of dollar diplo-
 macy into 1971, China extended new economic
 aid to Somalia ($109 million), Ethiopia ($84 mil-
 lion), Sudan ($40 million), Algeria ($40 million)
 and  Mauritania  ($20.5 million). In Mali, Peking
 indicated its interest in financing and constructing
 the $100 million Manantalli dam project.
 A New Approach to Revolution
 Since 1969, Peking's answer to the problem
 of differences between the demands of its African
 policy conducted in a world of nation states and
 the  demands  of  its revolutionary ideology has
 been to downplay the ideological factor and to
 operate on a more pragmatic basis. In effect, the
 goal of social revolution has been retained but put
 off into the indefinite future. Chinese policy now
 emphasizes the cultivation of good state-to-state

 relations with any government willing to recog-
 nize Mao's regime as the sole legitimate govern-
 ment  of  China.  No  ideological  strings  are
 attached, and Peking does not demand that other
 governments  support  its  position  vis-a-vis  the
 USSR. Communist China's leadership apparently
 accepts the fact that non-Communist, nationalist
 regimes are in power throughout Africa and are
 likely to remain indefinitely. Naturally, the Chi-
 nese are pleased when an African regime adopts a
 radical position, as in Guinea or Congo (Brazza-
 ville).  Nevertheless,  while  publicly  applauding
 such measures as the nationalization of various
 sectors  of  the  African  economy,  Peking  has
 demonstrated considerable private caution. Chi-
 nese officials have warned various African"regimes
 of  the  dangers of going too far, too fast  in
 remaking  their  economies.  Chinese spokesmen.
 also  have reminded African leaders hungry for
 economic aid that China's capacity to help them
 is  limited,  implying that they  should .not cut
 themselves off from other sources of assistance.
 China's adoption of a flexible,  pragmatic
 policy emphasizing good state relations has paid
 off in wider acceptance of Mao's regime by Afri-
 can  states.  In  turn, diplomatic  recognition  by
 African governments helps buttress the interna-
 tional  legitimacy of the Peking government and
 undermine that of its rival on Taiwan. African
 regimes are encouraged to believe that they can
 do business with Peking without fear of Chinese-
 sponsored subversion. In the long run, the Chi-
 nese obviously hope that increased international
 prestige  and acceptance will  be translated  into
 support for Peking's moves directed at altering its
 power relationships with the US and the Soviet
 Union.
 Peking loses no opportunity to establish the
 image of China as a champion of third-world-
 hence, African-interests against those of the two
 superpowers. Chinese propaganda hits hard on the
 theme that Washington and Moscow are "con-
 tending and colluding"  in order to divide the
 world  between them, that Soviet and US eco-
 nomic and military aid are given with ulterior
 motives, and that Afro-Asian (and Latin Ameri-
 can) countries should "get united" to oppose the
 Special Report
 schemes of the two superpowers to block the
 attainment of complete political and economic
 independence. Peking, which repeatedly pledges
 never to behave as a superpower, looks for con-
 crete issues of importance to Africans on which
 China  can take the  lead.  For example, China
 supports African anti-colonial moves in the UN,
 approved the Security Council decision to hold a
 session on African problems in Addis Ababa, and
 keeps up a drumfire of criticism against the white
 governments  in  Rhodesia and South Africa. If
 possible,  Peking  attempts to  select  issues that
 involve the interests of as wide a range of third-
 world countries as possible. Thus, Chinese sup-
 port of the claim. of several African countries to a
 200-nautical-mile  limit  for  territorial  waters, a
 matter of even greater concern to most South
 American states, was included in the communique
 of July 1971 summarizing the visit of a govern-
 ment delegation  from  Sierra  Leone. Later the
 same month, the communique marking the end of
 the visit of the Algerian foreign minister called for
 a "Mediterranean for the Mediterranean states,"
 obliquely criticizing the presence of both the US
 and Soviet fleets in the area.
 Current Chinese pronouncements stress the
 African  states' struggle to  protect  their sover-
 eignty and interests in the face of "imperialism,
 neo-colonialism,  and  racism."  Peking  is  fully
 aware of the damage done to its position in Africa
 by  its  past  association with  subversive move-
 ments. The Chinese quickly, and probably truth-
 fully, denied charges made in the summer of 1971
 by Uganda's President-Amin that they were aiding
 exiled President Obote in his plans to return to
 power. They  have told the Tanzanian Govern-
 ment that if any Chinese personnel there step out
 of line, the authorities in Dar es Salaam have only
 to say the word and the offender will be sent
 home immediately. There is no good current evi-
 dence that Peking is offering material or propa-
 ganda support to any movements aimed at over-
 throwing black'or Arab regimes in Africa. Indeed,
 as  demonstrated  by  Chinese  criticism  of  the
 Soviet Union's alleged meddling  in the internal
 affairs of the Sudan, Peking is attempting to turn
 the  tables  on  those  who  continue  to  label  it
 subversive.  In a  recent conversation, Sudanese

 President Numayri contrasted Chinese "correct-
 ness" on the issue of subversion with what he
 believed to be the unsavory record of the USSR.
 China maintains the revolutionary basis of
 its. African policy by supporting liberation move-
 ments directed against white rule in Portuguese
 Africa,  Rhodesia,  and- the  Republic  of  South
 Africa. Peking furnishes arms and training to the
 Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) based
 in Tanzania, and a small amount of arms have
 been given to the rebels in Portuguese Guinea.
 The  FRELIMO  leader, Samora Moises Machel,
 visited Peking in late summer 1971, and further
 Chinese aid probably was discussed. The Chinese
 have given limited amounts of aid to two smaller
 groups,  the  Mozambique  Revolutionary  Com-
 mittee  and  the  Partisan  Liberation  Union  of
 Mozambique, in an effort to maintain wide con-
 tacts within the anti-Portuguese liberation move-
 ments:
 The chairman of the Popular Movement for
 the Liberation of Angola made his pilgrimage to
 Peking in July 1971, and he may have secured
 promises of .Chinese support in the form of sup-
 plies and training by Chinese instructors in Tan-
 zania. The Chinese also have given token amounts
 of  aid  to  the  National  Union  for Total  Inde-
 pendence of Angola. Peking furnishes funds and
 military training in Tanzania to the Zimbabwe
 African National Union, an organization seeking
 the overthrow of the present regime in Rhodesia.
 Ideological  and  organizational  splits  have
 undermined the political and military impact of
 the  various  liberation  movements,  particularly
 those in Rhodesia, and Peking probably discounts
 their ability to overthrow colonial or white rule in
 the foreseeable future. After seeing their aid to
 various African revolutionaries frittered away in
 the early and mid-1960s, the Chinese apparently
 have  decided  to  give  only  relatively  modest
 amounts of aid to such groups, at least until these
 organizations  prove  to  have created effective,
 Special Report
 well-disciplined  movements  with  a  chance  of
 eventual success.
 Chinese influence among the African libera-
 tion  movements  faces several  limiting factors.
 Many of the movements, such as in Portuguese
 Guinea, receive aid from the USSR which their
 leaders are loath to jeopardize. The thought of
 Mao Tse-tung may inspire some African leaders
 intellectually and emotionally and interest them
 as a general guide to military and political action
 in a "people's war," but none of these leaders is
 an out-and-out Maoist, and all are ardent national-
 ists.  None of them appears susceptible to firm
 Chinese control, even if Peking should attempt to
 exert it. Finally, Chinese efforts to influence the
 liberation  movements are restricted by the atti-
 tudes of the African states that -play host to the
 rebels. For example, in view of Peking's efforts to
 court the Nyerere regime,  it  is highly unlikely
 that the Chinese would go against his wishes in
 dealing with FRELIMO.
 Given these limitations, which are aggravated
 by China's remoteness from the scene of action,
 the Chinese are- contenting themselves with being
 more of an inspirational force to the movements.
 Chinese propaganda stresses the necessity for each
 movement to be self-reliant, to build a base of
 local popular support, and to adopt its tactics to
 the local social and political environment.
 The Chinese have no qualms about reducing
 or even abandoning their propaganda or material
 support of an African liberation movement, if
 such an action helps cement good relations with
 an  African  government.  Peking  ceased  propa-
 gandizing for the Eritrean Liberation Front sev-
 eral months before China began recognition talks
 with  Ethiopia, and, since -the establishment of
 diplomatic relations, Peking has severely cut back
 and  probably  ended  support  for  the  Eritrean
 rebels.  Suspension  of  aid,  never  very  great  in
 absolute terms, was one of the main conditions
 set by Ethiopia as the price of recognition, and
 the Chinese apparently paid the price with alac-
 rity in order to gain a presence in an important

 African  state.. During  Emperor  Haile  Selassie's
 visit to Peking in October 1971, the Chinese lead-
 ership  emphatically  reassured  their  guest  that
 their aid to the Eritrean  Liberation  Front had
 ended.
 Peking's decision to accept the necessity of
 dealing  with  the  existing  African  nationalist
 regimes is paralleled by a decision to write off as a
 potential source. of support the few existing-and
 in almost every case illegal-African Communist
 parties. Most of the parties have generally been
 ineffectual and have lined up behind Moscow in
 the Sino-Soviet ideological split, making it easier
 for the Chinese to write them off as revisionists.
 Peking's utter indifference to African Communist
 parties is illustrated by its reaction to the fate of
 the Sudanese Communists. China did not join the
 Soviet and East European chorus protesting Presi-
 dent Numayri's violent suppression of the Sudan-
 . ese party. On the contrary, according to Numayri,
 the Chinese sent him a "good luck" message on
 the  occasion  of  his  countercoup. The Chinese
 ambassador  was the first foreign representative
 received  by him after his restoration to power.
 Peking has nearly doubled its economic assistance
 to his regime and has signed a military protocol
 with Khartoum. Chinese national interest in gain-
 ing  influence at the expense of the USSR in a
 major African state clearly overrode ideological
 considerations.
 If Peking has written off the existing Com-
 munist parties, there is-still the question of why
 the Chinese have made no great effort to en-
 courage the formation of pro-Peking Communist
 movements in Africa. One deterrent to such a
 move is the bias toward "European Communism"
 in the African movement. Particularly in French-
 speaking  Africa,  most of .the recruits to Com-
 munist or other ultraradical views have undergone
 ideological conversion under European influence.
 During the colonial era, the embryonic African
 Communist parties were in a sense an extension
 overseas  of  the  Communist  movements in the
 Special Report
 metropole. An equally strong factor is Peking's
 view of the prospects of African Communism.
 The Chinese very likely do not regard the situa-
 tion as ripe for the launching of African Com-
 munist  parties, which in their view cannot be
 organized from outside but must evolve according
 to the circumstances in each state. Rather than
 engage  in futile efforts to encourage chimerical
 Communist  movements,  Peking  has  chosen  to
 support selected radical African leaders or nation-
 alist movements and to await developments more
 favorable to the organization of pro-Chinese par-
 ties.
 Since  the  renewed  expansion  of  Chinese
 activity in Africa in 1970, most of China's new
 economic aid has gone to regimes that already
 have recognized the People's Republic. In part,
 this generosity is meant to impress African leaders
 who do not recognize China with the tangible
 benefits to be gained by good relations. Ethiopia
 and  Equatorial  Guinea concluded economic aid
 agreements with China within a year after recog-
 nizing  Peking.  Chinese  diplomats in Cameroon
 have broadly hinted that their government is will-
 ing to entertain a request for assistance, and the
 Chinese Communist ambassador  in Nigeria has
 suggested the conclusion of trade and economic
 aid agreements between the two countries. Peking
 uses its foreign aid as more than just a lure for
 recognition.  Provision  of  aid  helps  project  an
 image  of  a  dynamic, expanding, and  modern
 Chinese economy that will serve both as an in-
 spiration and source of help for underdeveloped
 nations.
 The Chinese are well-suited  by experience
 and the level of their technology to build basic
 projects-roads,  railroads, dams, ports, light  in-
 dustry, and agricultural and medical facilities~o
 badly needed by many African nations. The tech-
 nologically  more  sophisticated  Western  donors
 often  will  not  match  Peking's financial  terms,
 which  include  mainly  no  interest  credits with
 repayment  over  a  long  term  following  a

 substantial grace period. Chinese aid has been well
 received by most of its African recipients. The
 Chinese have a reputation for hard work, fru-
 gality, and living within the local economy. The
 scarcity  of  African  complaints  about  Chinese
 ideological  proselytizing in connection with the
 aid programs suggests that Peking is treading with
 circumspection. Moreover, the Chinese are willing
 to  undertake economically dubious  projects if
 they believe that the political gains will justify the
 burden. A case in point is the decision to finance
 and build the Tanzania-Zambia railway at a cost
 of $400 million. In addition to its direct utility,
 the railway is a showcase demonstration of the
 Chinese  ability to  handle  a  large-scale  project
 under  the  difficult  conditions of the African
 interior.
 China's economic competition with the West
 or the  USSR  is  limited  by  its own economic
 deficiencies. In Africa, Chinese economic aid has
 surpassed that given by the Soviet Union in only
 seven countries. The immense cost of the Tanzam
 railway has enabled Peking to outdistance Mos-
 cow in Tanzania and Zambia. China is the largest
 Communist aid donor to Congo (Brazzaville), and
 a $109-million aid package negotiated with the
 Somali  Republic .makes the Chinese the major
 source of aid there next to Italy. Peking also has
 topped .the Soviet aid level in Sudan and Mau-
 ritania. Half of the small loan given to the Central
 African Republic in 1964 remains unused. Bangui
 broke diplomatic relations with Peking early in
 1965. On the other hand, China's total economic
 effort in Africa through  1971 ($1,146 million)
 pales in comparison with the USSR's $2,519.5
 million in grants or loans during the same period.
 Most  African  states also retain  important eco-
 nomic ties with their. former colonial rulers; there
 is still considerable French economic interest in
 west and central Africa, and the United Kingdom
 is an important trade partner for its former Afri-
 can possessions, including Tanzania and Zambia.
 Chinese aid activities, particularly in Ethiopia and
 Somalia,  have  succeeded  in  arousing  Soviet
 apprehension.  Moscow's  representatives  have
 attempted  to  blacken  Peking's  new  pragmatic
 Special Report
 image by recalling past Chinese association with
 subversion  and,  on  occasion,  by  meeting the
 Chinese in head-on  competition, as in Somalia,
 where the recent Soviet agreement to finance a
 large agricultural development project. obviously
 is meant to offset increased Chinese economic
 aid.
 Moscow's  competition  probably  will  not
 deter an increasing number of African regimes
 from seeking Chinese economic assistance in the
 future. Almost all African regimes profess to fol-
 low anonaligned foreign policy, and acceptance
 of  Chinese aid  helps reinforce this image. Al-
 though there probably are few African leaders
 who have any illusions about China's ability to
 replace the West or the USSR as an economic
 patron, Peking's assistance is welcome, not only
 in its own right but also as a device to counter-
 balance any Western or Soviet presence, and as a
 bargaining tool with which to negotiate elsewhere
 for more aid on better terms. The Malian regime,
 for example, appears to be trying to play off
 China,  France, -and the  USSR in an effort to
 secure greater economic aid.
 Military Aid
 Peking's use of military aid as a supplement
 to  its  larger  economic  effort  is  more sparing.
 Tanzania and possibly Sierra Leone are now the
 only African states dependent on China for most
 of  their  new  military  equipment.  President
 Nyerere, fearing eventual Portuguese retaliation
 for  his  support  of  FRELIMO,  has agreed to
 receive, free of charge, about $12 million worth
 of Chinese equipment (tanks, trucks, jet aircraft,
 artillery,  patrol boats, small arms, and ammuni-
 tion), much of which has already been delivered.
 The Chinese also are building a base for the Tan-
 zanian Navy at Dar es Salaam and a major airfield.
 Chinese  instructors provide military training in
 Tanzania, and Tanzanian naval and air force per-
 sonnel have received military instruction in China.
 In addition, the Chinese have been asked to help
 train the new Tanzanian popular militia.

 Apart from  Tanzania, no African govern-
 ment has received large amounts of military aid
 from  Peking  since  1960. The agreement  con-
 cluded in July 1971 between China and Guinea
 calls for Peking to supply only several small patrol
 boats and an undetermined amount of arms and
 ammunition. Despite the signing of a military aid
 agreement with Congo (Brazzaville) in September
 1971-which  will  bring  in  Chinese tanks .and
 "heavy  equipment,"  and  send  some  military
 personnel  to  China for training-the Congolese
 receive most of their military equipment from the
 USSR. The Chinese have been well received, how-
 ever,  garnering  considerable  prestige  from  a
 modest amount of aid. Sierra Leone has received
 some small arms and ammunition and reportedly
 will receive some helicopters, gunboats, and more
 small arms. Zambia recently received its first shipr-
 ment of small arms from China.
 Prospectus
 Locked in a competition with the US and
 the USSR in the changing world power balance,
 Peking is likely to continue to take advantage of
 Africa's underdeveloped economies and endemic
 political  instability to expand  its influence and
 secure  African political support. How well the
 Chinese do will depend on a number of factors.
 Fifteen years of expanding involvement in Africa
 have  given  Peking  certain  intangible  assets-
 experience  in  the  area,  contacts  with  several
 important African leaders, such as Nyerere and
 Kaunda,  and  a  greater  understanding  of  the
 region's complex social and political structure.
 These assets have not always been well used-
 witness the setbacks dealt the Chinese during the
 mid-1960s-but Peking's increasing experience in
 Africa suggests that its policies and activities there
 are likely to become more sophisticated in the
 years ahead. The turn toward a pragmatic policy
 after 1969 has paid off in an expanding Chinese
 presence, yet Peking, by backing selected national
 Special Report
 liberation groups, has managed to retain its revo-
 lutionary aura.
 Transforming  these  assets .into  long-term
 political gains is a more uncertain process. The
 Chinese must continue to make good on their
 promises of economic aid and to show African
 leaders that China's support is valuable in attain-
 ing their  sometimes  competing  national  objec-
 tives. Amajor factor shaping the future of China
 in  Africa is, of course, the unpredictability of
 events  on  the  continent  itself.  The  fall  of
 Nkrumah, which  wiped out the political gains
 Peking had made in Ghana, and the failure last
 year of the attempted coup in the- Sudan, which
 opened  up  a  new opportunity for expanding
 Chinese influence, are cases in point.
 So far, China's ability to influence develop-
 ments in Africa has been very limited. No African
 regime or liberation movement appears about to
 adopt the Maoist model of society in toto, and,
 given  the  intensity  of  the African  desire for
 independence,  it  is unlikely that any African
 regime  will  allow  itself  to become completely
 dependent on Peking. African leaders are more
 likely to become increasingly skillful in balancing
 the  competing  pressures  from  the -West,  the
 USSR, and China.
 But  as long as Peking supports important
 African objectives, avoids a repetition of  med-
 dling  in  subversive  activities within  black  and
 Arab African nations, and offers cheap economic
 and  military  aid,  it  probably will continue to
 make modest gains. In such a context, the view of
 a skeptical Soviet diplomat in Ethiopia-that for
 years the  Ethiopians had  milked the US, had
 attempted to milk the USSR, but now have found
 a new cow and will milk it as dry as possible-may
 come to reflect much of the realit  of P  '
