 LEBANON
 Lebanese leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt
 finally gave in to Syrian pressure on April
 2 and agreed to a ten-day truce. Within
 the time limit-a condition demanded by
 the leftists-the Lebanese parliament is
 supposed to amend the constitution, elect
 a new president, and thus make way for
 President Franjiyah's resignation.
 Muslim leftist forces remain poised to
 resume the fighting should these con-
 ditions not be met.
 The parliament is scheduled to convene
 April 10 to amend the constitution. If this
 session is successful, election of a new
 president presumably will follow within a
 matter of days. Franjiyah, according to
 his Christian colleagues, has agreed to
 step down after the election of his
 successor.
 Syria  has increased its military
 presence in Lebanon during the past week
 in an effort to keep up the pressure on
 Jumblatt.
 These forces, along with Syrian-con-
 trolled Palestinian troops, have taken
 control of major ports, border-crossing
 points,  and  key supply and com-
 munications facilities throughout the
 country in what appears to be an effective
 blockade of arms and supplies to Jum-
 blatt's forces and their allies. Damas-
 cus has kept most of its regular forces
 in the north near Tripoli instead of
 in central and southern Lebanon to
 minimize the chance of an Israeli counter-
 move.
 The Israelis, as of midweek, did not
 appear concerned that conditions in
 Lebanon might lead to a new Arab-Israeli
 war, although defense officials announced
 publicly for the first time that significant
 numbers of Syrian regulars have, in fact,
 entered Lebanon.
 Damascus is gambling that Tel Aviv
 will continue to act with restraint and that
 the show of Syrian force will intimidate
 Lebanese leftists and their Palestinian
 supporters into going along with the plan
 to replace Franjiyah and extend the
 cease-fire. The danger is that Syria might
 fail to intimidate Jumblatt and misjudge
 the limits of Israeli tolerance. (An
 analysis of the growing military and
 political strength of Lebanon's Muslim
 leftists appears on page 9.)F

 The USSR is giving strop support to
 Syria's effort to achieve a truce in
 Lebanon.
 On Thursday, a Pravda article signed
 "Observer" to denote the Kremlin's en-
 dorsement, backed Syrian mediation and
 called for the preservation of a united and
 independent Lebanese state. It was the
 most authoritative Soviet statement to
 date on the Lebanese situation.
 Soviet diplomatic intercession in Beirut
 may have been prompted by a meeting
 between Vinogradov and Syrian President
 Asad on March 29. At about that time,
 Damascus was soliciting Western reaction
 to more open and extensive Syrian in-
 tervention in Lebanon, and Asad may
 have convinced the Soviets of the gravity
 of the situation.
 Moscow wants to avoid an expanded
 conflict in the area, but it has other
 reasons  for supporting the Syrian
 proposal. It does not want Asad's prestige
 to suffer, particularly at a time when
 Soviet problems with Egyptian President
 Sadat have intensified. Moscow may also
 fear that Syrian failure in Lebanon could
 lead to political instability in Damascus.
 US naval movements have led the
 Soviets to talk publicly about possible US
 intervention in Lebanon, and they have
 formally asked Washington for an ex-
 planation of US intentions. The Soviet ac-
 tions appear designed to show the Arabs
 that Moscow is protecting their interests.

 Cairo.
 A Soviet government statement issued
 last week put Moscow's formal denuncia-
 tion of Sadat's action on the record. The
 statement did not berate President Sadat
 by name, but it did reject some of his ac-
 cusations against Moscow on the ar-
 maments and debt questions and made
 clear that it was Sadat's reorientation of
 Egypt's foreign policy that has caused the
 rift.
 The statement, as well as a torrent of
 Soviet comment that followed, rejected
 assertions by Egyptian officials that the
 abrogation will not cause any changes in
 the Soviet-Egyptian relationship. Moscow
 said Sadat will have to face up to the
 Egyptian people for the consequences of
 his policy-a statement designed to sow
 doubts in Egypt about the wisdom of
 Sadat's action.
 Soviet officials have privately indicated
 that the USSR does not intend to take
 any dramatic action against Sadat.
 In justifying their decision to sit tight,
 the Soviets are asserting that Sadat's
 isolation in the Arab world and Egypt's
 economic difficulties will eventually lead
 to his removal. They probably want to
 avoid any action that might lend sub-
 stance to Sadat's charges that they are
 seeking to undermine him. Some Soviet
 officials are worried that Sadat may expel
 the many Soviet citizens still in Egypt and
 act against the Soviet cultural centers,
 which give Moscow entry to the Egyptian
 left.
 The Soviet public statements have
 stirred an outpouring of charges from the
 Egyptian press and public figures of
 Soviet meddling. The Egyptians are try-
 ing to show widespread support for Presi-
 dent Sadat to counter the Soviet cam-
 paign, but their failure to publicize some
 of the specifics of the Soviet rebuttal
 suggests concern that the attacks might

 FRENCH TERRITORY OF
 THE AFARS AND ISSAS
 Paris has met a quick rebuff to its ef-
 forts to begin the peaceful decolonization
 of the French Territory of the Afars and
 Issas.
 Somali President Siad last week re-
 fused to give Paris a formal guarantee
 that Somalia will respect the sovereignty
 of the territory after it becomes in-
 dependent. Siad, who wants to annex it,
 told a special French emissary that he
 would only give verbal assurance.
 The Front for the Liberation of the
 Somali Coast-a Somali puppet
 organization-and the African People's
 Independence League-the legal opposi-
 tion party in the FTAI-last week re-
 jected French proposals for a meeting that
 would include them, the pro-French
 governing party led by Ali Aref Bourhan,
 and the Ethiopian-backed Djibouti
 Liberation Movement.
 The Front and the League called on
 France to negotiate only with them, ex-
 cluding Ali Aref and the Djibouti Libera-
 tion Movement. The Front accused
 France of trying to conceal its true
 aim-the transfer of power to Ali Aref
 after a sham ."referendum.
 The special French'emissary had visited
 Addis Ababa before he went to
 Mogadiscio. The Ethiopians reiterated
 their determination to prevent Somalia
 from dominating the FTAI. They ex-
 pressed concern about the weak domestic
 position of Ali Aref, whom they favor to
 lead an independent government.
 The  Ethiopians said  they oppose
 "foreign bases" in the territory after it
 becomes independent, but made no ex-
 plicit objection to French troops remain-
 ing there to protect its sovereignty. Ethio-
 pian officials said they would prefer
 guarantees b  the Organization of
 African Unity.
 RHODESIA
 N2_
 The four southern African presidents
 who  support the black Rhodesian
 nationalists are pressing ahead with ef-
 forts to increase military pressure on Ian
 Smith's white minority regime.
 Tanzanian President Nyerere, Mozam-
 bican President Machel, Zambian Presi-
 dent Kaunda, and Botswanan President
 Khama reportedly agreed, at their recent
 meeting in Lusaka, that the insurgents
 should be permitted to launch guerrilla at-
 tacks into northwestern Rhodesia from
 Zambia. No such attacks have occurred
 yet, but the Zambians have reportedly
 been making plans to support such
 operations.
 The African leaders were unable to per-
 suade the leaders of the two principal
 nationalist factions-Joshua Nkomo and
 Bishop  Muzorewa--to bury their
 differences.

 Nyerere and Machel are trying to
 tighten their control over outside aid to
 the nationalist guerrilla forces because
 they are concerned that direct aid by the
 Soviets, Cubans, and Chinese to the fac-
 tions each favors could widen existing
 divisions and weaken the guerrilla effort.
 The Tanzanians informed  communist
 countries last week that all outside aid is
 to be sent through Tanzania and Mozam-
 bique.
 The four presidents want to avoid a
 repetition of what happened in Angola.
 They have agreed that no Cuban or other
 foreign combat troops will be allowed to
 join the fighting in  Rhodesia. The
 pressure to allow communist participation
 will increase, however, if the fighting
 drags on, as is likely.
 A recent British initiative aimed at
 restarting settlement talks shows little
 sign of bearing fruit. British Minister of
 State Ennals was given a sympathetic
 hearing in Tanzania and Mozambique
 last week, but Nyerere and Machel both
 expressed their belief that further fighting
 would be necessary before there could be
 any meaningful negotiations. Kaunda,
 who had been the prime backer of the
 settlement talks, reportedly has come to
 the same conclusion.
 ALGERIA-MOROCCO
 Algeria last week renewed its efforts to
 keep the UN involved in its dispute with
 Morocco over Western Sahara. A senior
 Algerian Foreign Ministry official told
 the US ambassador on April 1 that the
 return to the area in late March of UN
 Secretary General Waldheim's special en-
 voy shows that the international com-
 munity is still involved. The official urged
 the US to encourage UN efforts to
 resolve the dispute. He did not suggest
 any softening in Algeria's position.
 The envoy's mission was abruptly
 suspended this week. Neither Morocco
 nor Mauritania would receive him
 because he had met representatives of the
 Algerian-backed Polisario guerrillas and
 inspected Saharan refugee camps during
 his visit to Algeria.
 The  Moroccan
 poised to launch
 army reportedly is
 a massive sweep to
 clear remaining pockets of Polisario re-
 sistance in Western Sahara. Moroccan of-
 ficials are counting on this offensive to
 halt-at least through the hot summer
 months-Polisario raids on Moroccan
 forces in southern Moroccan and Western
 Saharan towns.

 major elements
 of three armor battalions and up to four
 motorized infantry battalions, plus sup-
 porting artillery, deployed in defensive
 strongpoints west of Tindouf.
 Algiers is also increasing its air strength
 in the area. Six MIG-21 fighters were on a
 highway strip northeast of Tindouf. This
 is the first time such aircraft have been
 seen in the southern border area. Sixteen
 new aircraft revetments were observed
 nearby, suggesting that the Algerians in-
 tend to build at least an auxiliary landing
 strip there. Seventeen MIG-15s or
 MIG-17s were at Tindouf airfield, about
 double the number previously located 25X1
 there. (A discussion of the background
 and the character of the Polisario Front
 appears on page 16.)
 ITALY    6 /  Z D
 The Socialist Party is maneuvering to
 bring down Prime Minister Moro's two-
 month-old Christian Democratic minority
 government. The Socialists, whose
 abstention in parliamentary votes is
 crucial to Moro's survival, seem to want
 an early national election but hope to
 avoid sole responsibility for the political
 and economic uncertainty that would
 follow the fall of Moro's government.
 The maneuvering by the Socialists is
 part of the political fallout from a clash in
 parliament last week over legalized abor-
 tion. The Socialists were infuriated by the
 Christian Democrats' willingness to rely
 on the support of the neo-fascists to
 thwart a Socialist attempt to make abor- 25X1
 tions readily available. The neo-fascists
 have Italy's fourth largest party, but they
 are treated as political pariahs by the six
 other parties.
 Parliamentary debate on abortion has
 been suspended until next week. The
 Christian Democrats, who failed to agree
 on a party strategy at their recent con-
 gress, are trying to patch things up. The
 Socialists, however, are in no mood to
 compromise and appear determined to
 force decisions on basic political issues.

 A meeting of the Socialist directorate
 this week showed strong sentiment in
 favor either of an early parliamentary
 election or an emergency government in
 which the Communist Party would have a
 limited but openly acknowledged role.
 The directorate gave Socialist chief De
 Martino a mandate to solicit the views of
 major political and labor leaders on a
 broad range of Italian problems. the
 Socialists are hoping to persuade others to
 agree that Moro's minority government is
 too weak to act effectively.
 De Martino is clearly trying to bring
 the government down by consensus in
 order to avoid the kind of criticism his
 party faced when it toppled  Moro's
 previous  government  early  this year.
 UNITED KINGDOM 2I "2 5
 James Callaghan became prime
 minister and leader of the Labor Party on
 April 5 after a third-ballot victory over
 left-winger Michael Foot.
 The policy direction of the Labor
 government probably will not change
 significantly. Callaghan will put his per-
 sonal stamp on the government, but there
 will be little change even in the style of
 leadership. Callaghan, like Wilson, has a
 knack for avoiding controversy and for
 seeking out the middle ground on poten-
 tially divisive issues. His sense of tactics,
 however, at times leaves Callaghan open
 to charges that he lacks conviction and
 originality.
 In his first television address as prime
 minister, Callaghan warned that Britain
 continues to live beyond its means and
 that more sacrifices will be necessary. He
 reaffirmed that the government must con-
 trol inflation before turning full attention
 to reducing unemployment. This order of
 priorities was confirmed by Chancellor of
 the Exchequer Healey in his budget
 message the following day.
 Most key ministers have remained in
 Callaghan's new cabinet if not always in
 the same job.  Most importantly,
 Healey-the symbol of the government's
 economic recovery program-stays on as
 Chancellor of the Exchequer. Anthony
 Crosland succeeded Callaghan as foreign
 secretary. Crosland, while not an avid
 "European,"  will  probably  follow
 Callaghan's pragmatic approach to EC
 affairs. British foreign policy will continue
 to reflect Callaghan's pro-American out-
 look.
 Foot's impressive and dignified perfor-
 mance in the leadership race may gain
 him the deputy party leadership, a
 stronger say in setting policy, and a key
 role in maintaining party unity. He has
 already been named Leader of the House
 of Commons, the government's business
 manager in Parliament.
 Many Labor politicians, probably in-
 cluding Callaghan, hope to put off an
 election until next year in the expectation
 that inflation and unemployment levels
 will be lower. Callaghan might still be
 tempted to call a snap election, however,
 if the opinion polls and local election
 results later this spring show that Labor
 has a good chance of winning.
 Budget Announced
 Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis
 Healey announced this week a mildly
 reflationary budget that reaffirms the
 government's commitment to reducing in-
 flation through cooperation with the labor
 unions.
 The budget, which entails a $22-billion
 deficit in the fiscal year running through
 March 1977, calls for selective tax cuts if
 the trade unions accept tougher wage con-
 trols.
 Included in Healey's tax package are
 certain unconditional tax relief measures
 as well as a few minor investment aids.
 Higher excise taxes are planned for
 alcohol, cigarettes, and gasoline. Personal
 income growth from an expanding
 economy is supposed to provide a higher
 base to tax, increasing the overall revenue
 take.
 The largest part of the tax relief,
 however, is contingent on labor's accep-
 tance of an annual limit on wage increases
 of about 3 percent. Healey is likely to
 have a hard time selling this to the unions.
 He may have to accept a higher pay limit
 coupled with less tax relief. Under current
 guidelines, wage increases have averaged
 10 percent.
 Healey has scheduled a 13-percent in-
 crease in government spending in the
 fiscal year ending next March. This is
 down sharply from the 29-percent rise
 registered last year; in real terms, it
 amounts to almost no change.
 Healey emphasized that economic
 recovery must be based on the expansion
 of exports and import substitution rather
 than massive government spending. He
 ruled out the prolonged use of import con-
 trols, but indicated the government might
 use selective controls.
 Len Murray, general secretary of the
 Trades Union Congress, objected to a
 3-percent pay limit on the grounds that it
 is inflexible and does not take pay
 differentials into account.  Margaret
 Thatcher, head of the Conservative Party,
 objected to the conditional nature of the
 tax cuts and to the large role that the un- 25X1
 ions play in deciding on tax cuts that
 affect  other  citizens      as well.

 EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
 The EC summit in Luxembourg last
 week failed to agree on solutions for the
 pressing  economic and  institutional
 problems facing the Community. The
 political fallout will probably be most
 damaging for French President Giscard.
 His ideas on monetary cooperation and
 his proposal to resolve the deadlock on
 direct elections to the European Parlia-
 ment were blocked.
 The most immediate problem facing
 the heads of government at Luxembourg
 was the disparity in economic conditions
 25X1     that had led France again to withdraw
 from the joint float-an action that
 emphasized  West  Germany's  relative
 strength within  the EC. Chancellor
 Schmidt made no bones about Germany's
 unwillingness to underwrite further EC
 programs to benefit the weaker members
 unless they accept binding pledges to
 follow more stringent economic policies.
 The French and British, in particular,
 found this condition politically unaccep-
 table. The leaders fell back on charging
 the finance ministers with examining later
 this month EC Commission proposals for
 policy cooperation.
 Prime Minister Wilson failed in his bid
 to have the Community adopt a common
 approach to unemployment. Schmidt in-
 sisted that each member must alleviate its
 own unemployment problem and do it by
 non-inflationary means.
 The Council was unable to devise a for-
 mula for apportioning seats in a directly
 elected European Parliament in 1978.
 While new proposals are possible, it is not
 yet clear whether the issue can be un-
 blocked at the next European Council in
 July.
 Prime Minister Tindemans' report on
 European Union was given short shrift;
 the long-term development of the EC
 could not be discussed objectively in an at-
 mosphere so lacking in common purpose.
 The foreign ministers were given a vague
 mandate to come up with "concrete
 proposals," based on Tindemans' report,
 for the European Council in December.
 The leaders did reach a number of
 foreign policy decisions. They issued, for
 example, a declaration on Rhodesia sup-
 porting British objectives there. In Lux-
 embourg, the political directors agreed to
 make a demarche to Greece, Turkey, and
 Cyprus to encourage continuation of the
 Clerides-Denktash talks.
 The absence of results from the summit
 contrasts with progress registered during
 the first joint meeting of EC foreign and
 finance ministers this week. The ministers
 made a long-overdue start on discussing
 how the EC budget could be more
 rationally used to direct greater resources
 into  regional  and  social  programs.
 SPAIN           26,2-7
 Madrid's efforts to isolate the Com-
 munist Party suffered a serious setback
 last weekend when two major Christian
 Democratic groups decided to join the op-
 position alliance recently formed by the
 merger of Communist- and Socialist-led
 coalitions. The government will come un-
 der more pressure to speed up moves
 toward democratic reform. The political
 right, in turn, will galvanize its campaign
 against reform.
 In separate meetings last weekend, the
 Christian Democratic Left, led by Joa-
 quin Ruiz Gimenez, and the more conser-
 vative Popular Democratic Federation,
 led by Jose Maria Gil Robles, agreed to
 join the new alliance-the Democratic
 Coordination.
 The willingness of the Gil Robles fac-
 tion to discard its previous rejection of
 cooperation with the Communists ap-
 parently stemmed from its long-standing
 desire to merge with the Christian
 Democratic Left. Both factions agreed to
 unite and pledged to work toward
 cooperation  between  all  Christian
 Democratic groups in Spain.
 The two groups stipulated that their
 participation in the new opposition front
 depends on its renunciation of the use of
 violence.
 The government has taken a tough line
 toward the Democratic Coordination,
 claiming it is just another Communist
 front. The regime struck back at the
 Communists by arresting several party
 members who tried to hold a news con-
 ference to publicize the new front. If the
 Communists are brought to trial, the
 Madrid government is almost certain to
 be the target of a campaign throughout
 Europe charging it with the kind of
 political repression practiced during the
 Franco regime.

 The removal of Teng Hsiao-ping from
 all his offices, announced by Peking on
 Wednesday, and the appointment of Hua
 Kuo-feng as premier and party first

 mean sidetracking of the broad range

 The shift is apparently not an un-

 Prime Minister Khukrit Pramot lost his
 seat in the National Assembly in Sun-
 day's general election, and with it any
 chance of forming the new government.
 His defeat was the result of a conservative
 backlash against his hard-nosed approach
 to negotiations on a residual US military
 presence. Key military leaders were con-
 cerned that Khukrit's handling of the
 negotiations had jeopardized Thailand's
 close relationship with the US and the
 continued now of US arms and equip-

 him.

 Party won only 20 percent. Democrat
 Party leader Seni Pramot, Khukrit's older
 brother, is in line to form the next govern-
 ment.
 The size of the Democrat plurality puts
 Seni in a strong position to form a more
 stable government. He has only to gain
 the support of one of the three political
 parties that received between 10 and 20
 percent of the votes to gain a majority.
 Last year, Khukrit was forced to rely on a
 shaky seven-party coalition to win a vote
 of confidence in the assembly.
 Seni has the backing of key military
 leaders,  including former army com-
 mander      Siwara
 The prospect of a relatively stable
 center-right coalition backed by the
 military clearly lowers the odds of a
 military take-over anytime soon. The
 presence of Krit in the cabinet would
 assure the military leadership that its in-
 terests are being protected.

 in a major speech last week, President
 Morales Bermudez tried to defuse coup

 The President admitted that errors had

 The President gave a spirited defense of
 the seven-year-old revolution led by the
 military and affirmed that it would con-
 tinue firmly, but gradually, on a "Chris-

 The President's speech had something
 for almost everyone. Some could see it as
 a promise to moderate the leftward drift

 however, are clearly not convinced that
 the President intends to take a firmer

 leftists like the Prime Minister, General

 ARGENTINA 6-6 57
 Argentina's new civilian economy
 minister, Jose Martinez de la Hoz, has
 outlined a comprehensive package of
 tough measures to slow runaway infla-
 tion, curb wide-scale illegal economic ac-
 tivities, and provide investment incen-
 tives.
 The program amounts to an invitation
 to domestic business and agriculture, as
 well as to foreign capital, to line up behind
 the new military government. It is a direct
 challenge to labor, which stands to lose its
 privileged position.
 The program, the product of months of
 work, calls for expansion of the private
 sector and a decrease of the state's role in
 economic activity.  Some specific
 proposals provide for cuts in federal spend-
 ing, tax breaks and other incentives for
 industry and agriculture, and measures to
 attract foreign capital.
 The minister also plans to seek inter-
 national assistance in covering the coun-
 try's estimated $1.4-billion foreign ex-
 change gap.
 The plan is an attack on virtually all
 Argentina's economic problems at once.
 Some measures, notably freeing the
 foreign exchange rate, are already in
 effect. The generals are clearly betting
 that they can produce an early,
 demonstrable success for the benefit of
 both critics at home and prospective
 creditors and investors abroad.
 Though not so presented, the new
 program is a categorical rejection of all
 aspects of Peronist economics. Wage
 limits and permission for producers to
 raise prices as needed will depress living
 standards for labor, long the favored
 group under Peronism. Cuts in federal
 spending  are  to  trim  the  bureauc-

 Private firms are urged to join state

 inhibiting foreign investment also runs
 counter to the Peronists' nationalistic line.
 Organized labor still has the potential

 since he came to power two years ago. On
 every occasion, the punishment has been
 the same and directed only at the in-

 dramatic impact of each incident, but
 their frequency has a cumulative effect
 and indicates that some politicians see
 provocation as a useful way to dramatize
 Geisel's dictatorial powers.
 Such episodes also strengthen opposi-
 tion to Geisel among conservatives within
 the government. There are many, es-

 the President has already gone too far

 DEMAND FOR OPEC OIL
 World demand for oil from members of
 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
 Countries appears likely to increase by
 about 7 percent in 1976 to an average of
 29 million barrels per day. Even so,
 OPEC production this year will remain
 substantially below the nearly 31 million  25X1
 barrels per day produced in both 1973 and
 1974.
 Output during January and February
 this year averaged only slightly above 27
 million barrels per day, as oil companies
 held down liftings in order to dispose of
 excess stocks. Stocks are now down, and
 OPEC output for the remainder of the
 year will probably average more than 29
 million barrels per day. This level of out-
 put should ease the production and
 revenue problems faced by many OPEC
 members over the past year.
 Global economic recovery is the main
 reason for the likely resurgence in demand
 for OPEC oil. With the economic revival
 picking up momentum, energy consump-
 tion will probably rise substantially for
 the first time since 1973. Because output
 of alternative fuels will rise only slightly,
 oil consumption in the non-communist
 world will probably rise by about 5 per-
 cent; it fell 3 percent in both 1974 and
 1975.
 We estimate that oil production in
 Western countries that are not members
 of OPEC will edge up to 17.8 million
 barrels per day this year. Output will ex-
 pand by about 500,000 barrels per day in
 the North Sea and by about 300,000
 barrels per day in Mexico, and will
 probably fall by another 400,000 barrels
 per day in the US.

 Jtl.Kt I
 The rapid rise in the political and military power of
 Lebanon's radical and leftist groups has brought a new
 and unpredictable dimension to the Lebanese scene. No
 single group inside or outside tie country has dominant
 influence on the loose alliance or leftist factions.
 Radical Muslim and leftist groups are
 emerging from the prolonged fighting in
 Lebanon with considerable new popular
 support, military strength, and political
 resolve.
 Even before the collapse of the
 Syrian-sponsored  cease-fire in early
 March, the leftists had proved they were a
 formidable political as well as military
 force that could  intimidate old-line
 Muslim politicians and directly challenge
 the Christian military establishment.
 During  the  renewed  fighting  last
 month, the radicals showed they could vir-
 tually silence old-line Muslim leaders and
 could inflict chastening defeats on the
 major Christian militias. Leftist military
 successes were due in part to support from
 independent fedayeen groups, especially
 Yasir Arafat's Fatah. The military and
 political prospects of the left hinge to a
 large extent on whether it continues to
 receive support from Arafat.
 Whatever the relationship between
 Palestinian and leftist leaders, the leftists
 will be a powerful and influential factor
 on the Lebanese scene for some time to
 cone. It is conceivable that they may gain
 the upper hand during the critical weeks
 and months ahead.
 The Leftist-Muslim Coalition
 The task of controlling or even
 negotiating with the extreme left is com-
 plicated by the fact that it is a collection
 of fringe groups allied mainly by a sense
 that together they can gain the advantage
 in Lebanon. There is no dominant leader
 or faction that can be brought into what
 Lebanon: The Left's Ascendancy
 would probably have differing points of
 view in negotiations for a political settle-
 ment.
 The rebel Lebanese Arab Army headed
 by Ahmad Khatib has been a key compo-
 nent in the leftist coalition. We estimate
 that Khatib's followers have swelled from
 several hundred in late January to
 between 2,000 and 3,000 now. Many of
 these may be only hangers-on, but most
 are trained soldiers who brought with
 them arms, ammunition, and some heavy
 weapons. Khatib has probably not. been
 able effectively to organize his band, and
 there does not appear to be any abiding
 allegiance to his leadership within the
 renegade army, except among a core
 group of several hundred.
 We have only scant information on
 Khatib's political leanings. The success
 and fame he has won by cooperating with
 the left may lead him to adhere to leftist
 political demands. Even so, he may not be
 able to deliver all of his following.
 Outside Sponsors
 The rapid ascendancy of the Lebanese
 left has triggered intense competition
 among outsiders for influence over in-
 dividual leftist groups. Syria, its Pales-
 tinian client Saiqa, and Yasir Arafat's
 Fatah have been the left's primary
 patrons.
 Libya and Iraq also supply some small
 arms and money, but they have been
 prevented by the Syrians-who control
 the  major  supply  routes  into
 Lebanon-from gaining sponsorship over
 any one group or establishing any signifi-
 cant influence over the leftist movement
 as a whole.
 remains of the old political system.
 Kamal Jumblatt comes closest to being
 the leader of the leftist-Muslim coalition.
 His long record of speaking out against
 the Christian and Sunni Muslim es-
 tablishments and his agitation for minori-
 ty rights and economic and social change
 have gained him stature among younger
 Muslim radicals in many parts of the
 country. His private militia, moreover, is
 the largest in the leftist front.
 Although Jumblatt by no means con-
 trols his radical allies, his ability to exploit
 the inherent weaknesses in Lebanon's
 traditional political fabric-its inequities
 and rigidities-has been the key to his
 success, and, as his allies seem to
 recognize, to their recent rise as well.
 Most other leftist leaders are locally
 based and urban. They have no well-de-
 fined ideology beyond a strong commit-
 ment to Palestinian and Arab causes, a
 desire to overturn Christian minority
 rule, and a general penchant for radical-
 ism. Their support has conic from disad-
 vantaged Muslim and minority groups.
 The most successful of these local
 leaders are Ibrahim Qulaylat and his ally
 Isam al-Arab in Beirut, Faruq Muqad-
 dam in Tripoli, and Mustafa Saad in
 Sidon. Muqaddam and Saad are scions of
 old-line political families, and their
 political and social views may be relative-
 ly tempered. They arc far outnumbered,

 have loosely coordinated their military ac-
 tions and together may command fighters
 numbering in the thousands, but they

 SPECTRUM OF POLITICAL LEADERS AND MILITARY GROUPS
 INVOLVED IN THE LEBANON CRISIS
 Kamal Jumblatt, parliamentary deputy and leader of the Progressive
 Socialist Party, is the commonly accepted leader of the leftist coali-
 tion. He is head of Lebanon's Druze minority, and under the old
 confessional system of government, could not hold the presidency or
 prime ministership. His 3,000-man militia-the largest in the coali-
 tion-depends on Syria and the main fedayeen groups, Fatah and
 Saiqa, for arms and training.
 Ibrahim Qulaylat, head of the Independent Nasirite Movement, is
 one of Jumblatt's chief allies in the leftist front. His 2,000-man
 militia is based in Beirut and has been active in the struggle for the
 hotel and commercial districts. Qulaylat has close ties with Fatah and
 receives some aid from Libya.
 Lieutenant Ahmad al-Khatib, is leader of rebel Muslim army soldiers
 whose seizure of army installations in southern Lebanon triggered
 the collapse of the cease-fire in early March. His following has
 increased from several hundred in mid-January to roughly 4,000
 men. His followers have brought with them most of the supplies and
 heavy weapons of the Lebanese army.
 Brigadier General al-Ahdab, led the attempted coup against President
 Franjiyah on March 11. Ahdab appears to have very little backing
 from army commanders. An initial endorsement from Khatib's forces
 has not materialized into any real support, but his challenge to the
 President and his control of Beirut radio have been important
 psychological boosts for the leftists.
 Major Palestinian Leaders
 Yasir Arafat, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and
 chief of Fatah, leads the 400,000 Palestinians living in Lebanon. He
 commands 8,000 Fatah regulars in Lebanon and a 1,000-man con-
 tingent of the Palestine Liberation Army-the Ayn Jallut Brigade-
 normally based in Egypt.
 Zuhayr Muhsin, member of PLO Executive Council, is chief of the
 Saiqa fedayeen organization controlled by Syria. In effect, he is
 Syria's voice in the Palestinian movement. All of Saiqa's 3,000 troops
 are now in Lebanon and are directed from Damascus.
 Brigadier General Budayri. Commander of the Palestine Liberation
 Army, has 5,000 troops now in Lebanon. With the exception of the
 contingent under Arafat's command, PLA units are controlled by
 Damascus. The PLA was used earlier this year to enforce the cease-
 fire, but the sympathy of top PLA commanders for Lebanese leftists
 and fellow Palestinians involved in the fighting has undermined the
 PLA's effectiveness as a neutral police force.
 "Rejectionist" fedayeen leaders, including George Habbash, Ahmad
 Jabril, and others, have fought with leftist militias against the Chris-
 tians.
 Prime Minister Rashid Karami, a Sunni Muslim, has lost much of his
 grass-roots support in northern Lebanon to a local leftist leader and
 has become dependent on Syrian backing. He still has a certain
 national standing that may help him hold on to the prune minister-
 ship. Karami's private militia-the Arab Liberation Army-was in-
 volved in the defense of Karami's home town of Tripoli in the
 fighting against the Christians last year but has not actively partici-
 pated in the current leftist-Christian struggle.
 Saib Salam, former prime minister, was once the most powerful
 Sunni Muslim political boss in Beirut, but has lost most of his
 popular backing to radical Muslim leader Ibrahim Qulaylat. Salem
 continues to play an active role in efforts to negotiate a settlement
 and has generally supported Karami.
 Kamal Asad, Speaker of Parliament, is a prominent leader of Leba-
 non's Shia Muslim community. He heads a powerful bloc of parlia-
 mentary deputies from the south, which signed a recent petition for
 FranjiyaWs resignation. Asad is currently helping to arrange passage
 of a constitutional amendment that would provide a legal, face-saving
 way for the President to resign before the end of his term.
 Key Maronite Christian Leaders
 President Sulayman Franjiyah, who has never had enthusiastic back-
 ing from his fellow Maronites, has lost the support of most Chris-
 tians. He personally commands a small militia based in the northern
 city of Zagharta and a 300-man Christian contingent from what is
 left of the Lebanese army.
 Pierre Jumayyil, parliamentary deputy and leader of the Phalanges
 Party, is the founder of the conservative Phalanges-the largest Chris-
 tian party in Lebanon-and is the most powerful spokesman on the
 Christian side. He commands the Phalangist militia, which has well
 over 10,000 well-trained fighters, and perhaps as many as 8,000
 irregulars.
 Camille Shamun, interior minister, former president, and chief of the
 National Liberal Party, generally played a spoiler's role in settlement
 negotiations last year. ' He has been the most inflexible and unpredict-
 able player on the Christian side. His 2,000-man militia has been
 active in fighting in Beirut and areas south of the capital.
 Raymond Edde, parliamentary deputy and leader of the National
 Bloc, is-the son of Lebanon's first president, and leader of the third
 largest Christian Party. A leading candidate to succeed President
 Franjiyah, Edde has a broad following in parliament and among
 conservative Muslims, but is opposed by Syria and conservative
 Christians, like Jumayyil.
 Ilyas Sarkis, governor of the central bank, is Edde's chief competitor
 to replace Franjiyah. Sarkis has no personal following but is favored

 Rivalry between Syria and  ata  or
 controlling influence over the left, com-
 bined with challenges from               Iraq and
 Libya, have given the major leftist leaders
 a measure of independence from any one
 outside sponsor. Jumblatt, for example,
 appeared relatively immune to Syrian
 demands earlier this year to stop his
 trouble-making,  and  more  recently,
 blatantly defied Syrian insistence that he
 accept a cease-fire. Only the combined
 decision of Syria and Fatah to cut off
 military support to Jumblatt finally
 brought him to heel.
 The Egyptian Angle
 Egypt's preoccupation throughout the
 Lebanon crisis has been with the prospect
 that Syria might strengthen its leadership
 in the Arab world by a successful effort to
 settle the conflict. Above all, Cairo wants
 to prevent anything that would so en-
 trench Syria's influence in Lebanon as to
 give it virtual control of the country and,
 with it, control of the Palestinian move-
 ment.
 The Egyptians do not have much in-
 fluence, but they are doing their best to
 thwart Syria, and they have lately become
 a disruptive influence. They seem blinded
 to the prospect that the alternative to
 Syria's political intervention could be the
 ascendancy of the left in Lebanon, and
 they seem undismayed by the possibility
 that  the  conflict  could  lead  to
 Syrian-Israeli hostilities.

 The Egyptians have also dropped any
 pretense of neutrality toward the Leba-
 nese factions, and have been openly prais-
 ing Jumblatt for his anti-Syrian posture.
 A Look Ahead
 The loose alliance under Jumblatt may
 fragment to some degree as a result of the
 cease-fire, and the left will not necessarily
 be as formidable politically as it has been
 militarily. There are differences among
 the leftists in terms of personality,
 ideology, regional interests, and con-
 stituencies that will make it difficult for
 Jumblatt to present a united position on
 every issue. fie will, for example, have
 some difficulty balancing the concerns of
 his rural conservative Druze followers
 with the demands of the Muslim "street"
 constituency of Qulaylat.
 The leftists, however, have sufficient
 common ground to enable them to remain
 the most powerful voice on the Muslim
 side and a force that cannot be isolated
 and weakened by the old-line Muslim
 leaders, by the Christians, or by Syria.
 The leftists appear united in seeking sub-
 stantial reduction in Christian political in-
 fluence, economic adjustment in favor of
 the Muslims, an end to quotas by religion
 in the government and the army, close ties
 with the Palestinians, and a reduction in
 Syrian influence in Lebanon.
 Most importantly, the leftists appear to
 have eroded significantly the political con-
 stituencies of moderate Muslim leaders
 like Rashid Karami and Saib Salam. The
 old-line leaders have proved unable either
 to arrest or to capitalize on the leftists'
 momentum, and they will probably be in-
 timidated in any future negotiations by
 the leftists' political and military poten-
 tial.
 The leftists are not in a position to dic-
 tate a political settlement, but they will
 not accept a refurbished version of the
 Syrian-backed reform package achieved
 in February. They will insist on con-
 cessions, and their strength will ensure
 continuation of de facto partition and will
 complicate the problem of reconstituting
 an effective national security authority in
 Lebanon.
 The Palestinians and Muslim leftists
 together now control about two thirds of
 Lebanon and have reduced Christian con-
 trol in Beirut itself. This means that any
 new government in Beirut will continue to
 be weak and, in effect, will be operating
 within a confederation framework.
 The potential political ascendancy of
 the leftist Muslims and Palestinians in
 southern Lebanon will make the Israelis
 look at the area as an even greater securi-
 ty threat.

 that Syria's ability to influence the sit-

 have inhibited Asad from pursuing an
 even-handed policy.
 The limits of Syrian influence in
 Lebanon have also been exposed by the
 cooperation of Muslim leftists and Fatah
 to resist the Syrians. The more direct a
 role Syria has attempted to play, the more
 the left has united against Damascus'
 policy. The leftists and Arafat, in par-
 ticular, can be expected to continue trying
 to preserve their freedom of maneuver
 and to exploit any opportunity for playing
 off other Arab states, both radicals and
 conservatives, against Syria.
 President Asad's actions are also likely
 to be constrained by growing opposition
 within his military and ruling party to his
 Lebanese policy because it has tended to
 favor the Christians.
 Recent violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
 reflects rising Palestinian nationalism, and more trouble
 seems likely. The Israelis show no sign that they are
 considering significant modifications in their occupation
 policy.
 Growing Palestinian nationalism has
 fanned two months of violent anti-Israeli
 demonstrations by Arab students in the
 occupied West Bank. The outbreak will
 probably make it more difficult for Israeli
 occupation authorities to secure the
 cooperation of local Arab leaders to ad-
 minister the troubled area.
 More serious terrorist violence on the
 West Bank against Israeli rule seems like-
 ly. On a different level, many Palestinians
 are expected to show their hostility
 toward the Israeli occupation by suppor-
 ting candidates in the West Bank
 municipal elections on April 12 who are
 sympathetic to the Palestine Liberation
 Organization.
 Arab students have been demonstrating
 since late January. The demonstrations
 were triggered by the ruling of an Israeli
 magistrate ,permitting Jewish prayer ser-
 vices on Jerusalem's Temple Mount-the
 site of Islam's third holiest shrine.
 The students are also protesting against
 ,Jewish settlements in the West Bank, par-

 ticularly one set  up illegally last
 December at Sebastia near Nabulus. The
 Israeli government has not authorized the
 Sebastia site for permanent Jewish settle-
 ment, but the demonstrators fear that Tel
 Aviv's decision late last year to permit a
 small group of the would-be settlers to re-
 main temporarily at a nearby Israeli army
 camp is a first step toward permitting a
 permanent settlement.
 On March 21, the Israeli Supreme
 Court upheld the right of police to prevent
 Jewish prayer services on the Temple
 Mount. This decision has helped to pacify
 West Bank Arabs and the demonstrations
 have subsided. The territory is tense,
 however. The general strike on March 30
 in Israel staged by Israeli Arabs was sup-
 ported by many West Bank Palestinians
 who held widespread but mostly non-
 violent sympathy strikes.
 The Israelis have responded to the West
 Bank  agitation by reinforcing their
 military and police forces in- the West
 Bank and imposing strict curfews on par-
 ticularly rebellious towns. The Israelis
 will probably institute military rule of the
 West Bank if further disturbances should
 appear to jeopardize essential city services
 or Israeli security.
 These measures, however, will not
 resolve the political problem underlined
 by the West Bank violence.
 The Israelis are not insensitive to the
 problems caused by their occupation of
 the West Bank. The Israeli Education
 Ministry, for example, will soon make
 available to East Jerusalem's 6,000 Arab
 junior and senior high school students a
 curriculum nearly identical to the courses
 taught when Jordan governed the West
 Bank before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
 The new system is intended to enable
 East Jerusalem students to enter Arab un-
 iversities-something  previously  made
 difficult by the Israeli requirement that
 Arab students study essentially an Israeli
 curriculum.
 The change in courses suggests that Tel
 Aviv, while continuing to regard East

 Jerusalem as an integral part of Israel,
 feels compelled to acknowledge the ex-
 istence there of strong non-Jewish cultural
 and social ties to the West Bank and the
 rest of the Arab world.
 The Israeli government, however, has
 no apparent intention of revamping its oc-
 cupation policy in any major way to
 placate the West Bank Palestinians. The
 government, as well as the Israeli public,
 tend to view the West Bank primarily as
 territory necessary to strengthen Israeli
 security.
 Moreover, the Israelis generally believe
 that their occupation of the West Bank
 has been enlightened, that it has brought
 economic prosperity to the area and that
 most West Bankers, while not supporting
 the occupation, are willing to live with it
 as long as it continues to be benign and

 This tactic and the political power

 probably will be elected in some towns,
 however, putting increased pressure on
 the mayors in those places to be more ac-
 commodating to the PLO.
 Israeli Plans
 Defense Minister Peres, the cabinet of-
 ficial responsible for administering the
 West Bank, hopes to counter the PLO's
 popularity by encouraging the election of
 candidates sympathetic to his plans for in-
 stituting a limited measure of Arab self-
 rule in the area. Ideally, Peres would like
 to confer broader powers on receptive
 municipal officials after the elections and
 to this end he has long pressed a number
 of West Bank leaders to agree to his plan.
 He has met with little success because
 relatively few West Bankers are willing to
 cooperate publicly with Israeli occupation
 authorities.
 To improve the dim prospects for his
 plan, Peres has stepped up government ef-
 forts against the most blatant anti-Israeli
 groups. At the beginning of January, he
 prohibited "hostile Arab organizations,
 especially groups belonging to the PLO"
 from participating in the municipal elec-
 tions.

 deported to Lebanon two prominent Arab

 The Czechoslovak party congress that begins Mon-
 day will stress stability and loyalty to the USSR. The
 speeches may give some clue as to how President Ilusak
 is faring in his struggle with hard liners in the party over
 how to overcome the legacy of 1968.
 Public  preparations  for  the
 Czechoslovak party congress that begins
 on Monday have stressed continuity and
 stability. A central theme of the congress
 will be the correctness of Prague's policies
 since Gustav Husak came to power in
 1969, with stress placed on Czechoslovak
 loyalty to the Soviet Union and Husak's
 personal friendship with Brezhnev.
 Behind the facade, there are signs that
 Czechoslovakia: Party Congress
 disputes over fundamental policies have
 sharpened with the approach of the con-
 gress. It is unlikely that the disputes will
 come to a head at the congress itself; there
 are too many signs that party leaders
 want an appearance of stability. Speeches
 at the congress may provide clues,
 however, as to whether Husak is gradual-
 ly winning out in his battle with hard
 liners in the party over how to overcome
 the legacy of 1968.
 Perhaps the thorniest issue is what to
 do with Aleksander Dubcek and the other
 leaders of the "Prague Spring" who are
 still in Czechoslovakia. Though dis-
 credited and maligned, they are visible
 and sometimes vocal reminders of the
 Soviet invasion.
 Their fate is closely linked to the
 problem of rehabilitating almost 500,000
 former members of the party who were
 purged or who simply turned in their
 cards in the post-Dubcek era. These men
 constitute a pool of badly underutilized
 talent in a suffering economy that is
 chronically short of labor on the produc-
 tion line and at the managerial level.
 The state of the economy, in turn, has
 added to the tension between Czechs and
 Slovaks, especially during a time of
 Slovak political dominance. The Czechs
 resent the fact that a disproportionate
 share of capital investment goes to
 Slovakia to bring up its level of develop-
 ment to that in the Czech lands.
 Husak is trying to deal with the
 rehabilitation issue by separating the
 problem of Dubcek and other leaders
 from the thousands of rank-and-file party
 members who were "duped" by the
 "Prague Spring" and can thus be redeem-
 ed. The policy, called "differentiation,"
 has been stubbornly opposed by party
 secretary Vasil Bilak and the rigidly
 orthodox conservatives who support him.
 Recent evidence indicates that the
 balance in the party may be swinging
 toward Husak and the moderates. The

 tone of last month's congress of the
 Slovak party-the home constituency of
 Husak  and Bilak-was much more
 restrained than in 1971. Surprisingly little
 attention, for example, was devoted to the
 "threat from the right"-the Dubcek
 reformers-that has been a favorite Bilak
 theme.
 Also, on the eve of the Slovak congress,
 presidium member Alois Indra published
 an article that the US embassy says
 offered unbridled support for Husak and
 constituted a thinly veiled attack on Bilak.
 Indra has long been regarded as a
 hard-line rival of Husak. His apparent
 conversion may be another indication of
 Husak's growing strength.
 Even if Husak's position has improved,
 it probably is not strong enough to permit
 him to ride roughshod over Bilak and his
 firmly entrenched supporters in the party
 bureaucracy. Speeches at the congress
 may show, however, a trend in the party
 toward Husak's position.
 Any decision on rehabilitation would
 almost certainly come at party plenums
 after the congress, when Husak might get
 the party to back selective rehabilitation
 of most former party members in return
 for a continuing policy of no compromise
 toward Dubcek and his leading sup-
 porters.
 Major changes in the top leadership are
 unlikely at the congress. As at the Soviet
 and Bulgarian congresses, some minor
 adjustments may be made. Former presi-
 dent Ludvik Svoboda, who is senile and
 sick, may leave the party presidium to
 retire with full honors. If Svoboda is
 replaced, a leading candidate for his place
 is Foreign Minister Chnoupek, a staunch
 Husak supporter.
 Party secretary Frantiisek Ondrich will
 probably lose his position because of his
 recent  transfer  to a  government
 ministerial position. There will probably
 be some government shifts following the
 congress. Some reports suggest that state
 planning chief Vaclav Hula may become a
 scapegoat for the country's economic
 problems.
 The Polisario guerrillas of Western Sahara are capa-
 ble of carrying out hit-and-run attacks over a wide area in
 southern Morocco and northern Mauritania as well as
 Western Sahara. They are dependent on Algerian support
 and could not increase their operations substantially
 without much greater Algerian help.
 The Algerian-backed Polisario Front
 has become a significant guerrilla force
 capable  of conducting  harassing
 operations in southern Morocco, northern
 Mauritania, and Western Sahara.
 Estimates of the number of Polisario
 guerrillas range from 1,000 to more than
 5,000; we estimate the figure to be
 between 2,000 and 3,000. A number of the
 partisans were recruited from nomads
 and territorial police disbanded when
 Spain left its former territory.
 I he Front depends mainly on Algeria
 for arms, training, supplies, and financial
 support; some Algerian  military per-

 Before mid-1974, when King Hassan

 Sahara, the Front got most of its arms
 from Libya, which continues to provide
 some weapons and  financial  support
 through Algeria.
 The guerrillas, although no match for
 Moroccan and Mauritanian forces in con-
 ventional fighting, continue to carry out
 sabotage and hit-and-run attacks over a
 wide area. In addition to small arms, the
 guerrillas have used mortars, machine
 guns, grenade launchers, and occasionally
 SA-7 surface-to-air-missiles in skirmishes
 with Moroccan and Mauritanian forces.

 ing, it can continue a war of attrition in-
 definitely. Morocco can contain, but not
 eliminate, Polisario harassment.
 The bulk of Polisario partisans are
 from the Reguibat tribe, one of the most
 powerful of the Saharan peoples. They
 traditionally have followed a nomadic
 lifestyle, ranging with their camels across
 wide expanses of southern  Morocco,
 Algeria,  Western  Sahara,      and
 Mauritania.
 The Reguibats are known for their
 ferocity, pride, and ability with Firearms.
 Reguibat tribesmen-possibly including
 some  of the  present     Polisario
 leadership-were prominently involved in
 anti-Spanish demonstrations in the
 territorial capital of El Aaiun in 1970.
 The Front first came to notice as an in-
 Guerrillas during training at Polisario sanctuary
 surgent group in May 1973, when it at-
 tacked a Spanish frontier post along the
 Moroccan-Saharan border. The organiza-
 tion appears to be the successor of an
 earlier Saharan movement that opposed
 Spanish control of the territory.
 Sporadic Polisario incidents against
 isolated Spanish outposts in the Sahara
 continued through  1974 and  1975.
 Following the agreement in Madrid last
 November, which provided for a phased
 turnover of the territory to Morocco and
 Mauritania,  Spanish  forces gradually
 withdrew to it 70-mile defense perimeter
 around EI Aaiun.
 The guerrillas moved into the resulting
 vacuum, and operated in much of
 northeastern and southern Sahara. As
 first Moroccan, and later Mauritanian,
 troops moved into the Sahara, Polisario
 guerrillas began to attack these forces.
 Until late January, when  Morocco
 began extensive sweep operations against
 the guerrillas, the Front held several
 towns. The Polisario has since been forced
 to abandon virtually all of its fixed
 strongpoints, but the Front continues to
 wage guerrilla warfare in the more remote
 desert regions.
 Most Polisario militants are Reguibats
 and other indigenous Saharans. Some of
 the  front's known  leaders,  including
 Secretary General Mustafa Siyed el
 Ouali, reportedly were Saharan students
 who attended law school in Morocco.
 There are probably a significant
 number of Mauritanjans in the Polisario
 as well. The most prominent Mauritanian

 is Baba Miske, a former diplomat, who
 frequently  appears  as  a  Polisario
 spokesman.
 Many Saharan tribes probably have
 more in common with the Mauritanians
 than with the Moroccans. The Hassaniya
 Arabic spoken in much of the area is near-
 ly identical to that spoken in Mauritania
 and quite different from the Maghrebi
 Arabic spoken in Morocco.
 Political Credentials
 Recently, the Polisario Front seems to
 have been trying to strengthen its shaky
 political credentials,  Its provisional
 Saharan National Council, established
 last fall, proclaimed the formation of the
 "Saharan Democratic Arab Republic" on
 February 27.
 The announcement of the Republic was
 clearly intended to counter the Moroc-
 can-dominated  Saharan  territorial
 assembly's unanimous endorsement the
 day before of a motion to integrate the
 Sahara into Morocco and Mauritania. In
 further attempts to gain diplomatic sup-
 port and delay international recognition
 of de facto control of the territory by
 Morocco and Mauritania, the Front has
 also  announced  an  eight-man
 "government" and  promulgated a
 "provisional constitution."
 The Polisario controls little territory
 and has in effect set up a government-
 in-exile. Algerian and Polisario efforts to
 obtain recognition of the new Saharan
 "state" have been less successful than
 Algiers expected.
 Rabat's decision on March 7 to sever
 diplomatic relations with Algiers served
 as a clear warning to states that value
 their  relations with  Morocco not to
 recognize the new state. Thus far only
 Algeria, eight other African states, and
 North Korea have extended diplomatic
 recognition.
 The fall of Teng Hsiao-ping and the rise of Hua
 Kuo-feng this week have not resolved China's leadership
 struggle. The changes may be a result of a compromise
 between rival factions of a still-divided party leadership.
 China: Tang's Removal
 The demonstrations in Peking on Mon-
 day,  which  seemed designed  to put
 pressure on the party's left wing to ease up
 on its campaign against Teng Hsiao-ping,
 instead precipitated his removal from of-
 fice.
 The announcement by the Central
 Committee that Teng has been dismissed
 from all his positions specifically links
 this move to the demonstrations. The left
 successfully seized the opportunity to
 bring much more serious charges against
 Teng. The announcement indicated that
 the events of Monday had changed the
 situation-Teng's case now required
 punishment rather than persuasion.
 By contrast, a party directive issued in
 late February or early March indicated
 that Teng was in a relatively good position
 to survive the attacks on him. It reported-
 ly stated that Teng was not to be "struck
 down" and that his case was different
 from those of party leaders purged in the
 recent past.
 By orchestrating the demonstrations,
 Teng and his supporters badly overplayed
 their hand. The wide international
 coverage of the events angered and em-
 barrassed Mao and the left, and may have
 enabled them to win the support of
 moderates on the Politburo for the
 removal of Teng.

 Teng is now out of the succession
 sweepstakes, but he retains his party
 membership and has been given a chance
 to make amends for his errors.
 His removal does not appear to be an
 unqualified victory for the party's left
 wing, Although the decision against Teng
 was "unanimous," the left may well have
 made some concessions. One could be
 that the announcement on Teng is to
 mark the end of the current political cam-
 paign.
 Indeed, the editorial published Tuesday
 seemed more sharply focused on Teng
 alone than previous articles, and the
 reappearance yesterday of Politburo
 member Li Hsien-nicn, one of Teng's
 staunchest supporters, who had been ab-
 sent from public view since mid-January,
 suggests that other supporters of Teng
 will not suffer.
 The appointment of Hua Kuo-feng as
 Premier and as first vice chairman of the
 party may also be part of a compromise
 solution. Hua is not in the leftist camp
 and was attacked by leftists in 1974.
 There is also some evidence that he may
 have been subject to indirect attacks from
 the left during the campaign against Teng.
 In any event, Hua's elevation to first
 vice chairman of the party, a spot left va-
 cant by the death of Chou En-lai,
 suggests that the removal of Teng will not
 necessarily allow the leftists to increase
 significantly their influence in the top
 leadership. Hua was promoted over Wang
 Hung-wen, a young party leftist who had
 been next in line for the post.
 The appointment of Hua to the
 premiership,  together with the
 reappearance of Li Hsien-nien, the party's
 leading economic specialist, suggests that
 the current ambitious economic policies
 may continue with little change. The
 preservation of policies associated with
 Teng on a broad range of issues has un-
 doubtedly been foremost in the minds of
 moderates in the leadership.
 Teng's backers may have agreed to
 drop their support of him once they were
 assured that the relatively moderate Hua
 would become premier and would be
 promoted to a position in the party of suf-
 ficient stature to give him a major say in
 policy issues. Hua's new party position
 leaves him second only to Mao.
 Hua is closely identified with the effort
 to modernize agriculture, and when he
 was acting premier he frequently indicated
 there would be no change in China's
 foreign policy. Others in the leadership,
 who may have opposed the abrasive Teng
 for personal reasons but did not differ
 with him over policy issues, may now
 close ranks with those who personally
 supported  Teng,  thus giving  the
 moderates a  major voice in policy
 matters.
 Apart  from  the  opportunities for
 factional maneuvering arising out of the
 disturbances on  Monday, the entire
 leadership was probably considerably
 shaken by the demonstrations. Although
 they were orchestrated to a considerable
 degree, they revealed a depth of popular
 feeling about the late premier Chou En-lai
 and his policies that has no real precedent
 since the communists took power.
 Large-scale demonstrations apparently
 were confined to the capital,  but
 manifestations of support for Chou also
 occurred elsewhere in China. To some ex-
 tent, this outpouring of feeling was made
 possible by the continuing uncertainty
 about authority in Peking:
 ? Hua Kuo-feng was merely an
 "interim" acting premier.
 ? Tcng Ilsiao-ping remained under
 attack, but was not out of the picture.
 ? The leftists had not been able to
 generate momentum in their campaign
 against Tcng.
 Most leaders seem to have agreed there-
 fore to paper over their differences for
 a decisive display of authority. All were
 acutely concerned about the image of con-
 fusion and unbridled rivalry in Peking
 that was being presented to foreign
 observers, particularly in the Soviet
 Union.
 The leadership has taken the unusual
 step of publicizing rallies today in support
 of these decisions, indicating some defen-
 siveness about the turmoil on Monday.
 Yesterday's decisions, however, do not
 provide a long-term solution to China's
 Premier Hua (i) with
 Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua
 leadership problems. The People's Daily
 editorial on Tuesday acknowledged-for
 the second time-that the party Central
 Committee remains split. Given the depth
 of public sentiment revealed on Monday
 and the relatively powerful position of the
 moderates throughout the country, a
 "backlash" against the left remains a real
 possibility.
 Another round of struggle is almost
 certainly in the cards, perhaps even before
 Mao dies.
 Further changes in the leadership may
 also occur at the high-level meetings now
 under way in Peking, but a new rank-
 ing may not he fully revealed until May 1.
