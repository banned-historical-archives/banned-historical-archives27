 Educational Reform
 Prospects for the longer-term success of Deng
 Xiaoping's (Teng Hsiao-p'ing) modernization pro-
 gram will depend heavily on Beijing's ability to reform
 and revitalize China's educational system. Education
 is both an integral part of Deng's program and a
 barometer of political change in China. It has always
 been closely linked to Chinese politics. Since the
 Communists came to power in 1949, educational policy
 has swung with the political line, moving from
 pragmatism to Maoist ideological purity. It emerged
 from the Cultural Revolution in a shambles-highly
 politicized, weak in academics, and almost completely
 unable to turn out the trained people the country
 needed. The current pragmatically oriented national
 leadership is trying to correct this situation and to
 create an educational system capable of serving and
 sustaining Deng's ambitious plans for modernization.
 To do so, however, it will have to overcome many
 intractable problems-political opposition, low mo-
 rale, a shortage of funds, and poor planning and
 leadership in the field of education. Not the least of
 these problems is that education will almost certainly
 remain politically sensitive. Education will be one
 prime area in which significant popular backlash to
 Deng's modernization program could eventually
 emerge.
 This paper examines the Chinese leadership's educa-
 tional policies and discusses the problems of educa-
 tional reform and the prospects for ultimate success.
 A Legacy of Destruction-The
 Background of the Current Reforms
 The Chinese educational system was almost destroyed
 by the Cultural Revolution and by radical reforms
 introduced after 1970. Because of the turmoil during
 the Cultural Revolution, all middle schools in China
 were closed for two years (1966-68), and all universi-
 ties for four years (1966-70). When these schools
 finally reopened, a number of radical reforms were standards. Many teachers were persecuted for being
 25X1
 implemented. Grades and examinations (including
 both regular term exams and university entrance
 exams) were abolished. Courses of study were short-
 ened at all levels-from 10 to eight years in primary
 and middle schools, from five to four years in
 university science programs, and from four to three
 years in all other university programs. Textbooks used
 before the Cultural Revolution were declared obsolete
 and discarded. Curriculums were revised to stress
 political themes and practical applications of knowl-
 edge. Courses in basic theory, considered irrelevant by
 the leftists, were either abolished or neglected, and
 students were forced to spend a large part of their time
 working in communes and factories rather than
 studying. Graduate programs in all fields were abol-
 ished, and postgraduate students were trained only
 informally in research institutes, if at all. Under this
 very limited arrangement, few students could be
 trained, since many research institutes themselves
 were abolished or turned into production units in
 factories. The China University of Science and Tech-
 nology, for instance, the leading center of science
 education in China, was moved from Beijing to Anhui
 (Anhwei) Province, where students undertook work-
 study programs but were deprived of the advantages of
 interning in Beijing's Academy of Sciences.
 Entrance requirements for universities were also dras-
 tically altered. After 1970, students were selected
 largely on the basis of their class backgrounds and
 political reliability rather than their intellectual ability
 or academic records. In addition, almost all students
 were required to spend at least two years working in
 the countryside after completing middle school before
 they could apply to college. As a result, most students
 required remedial work once they finally enrolled in
 colleges and universities, both to make up for the
 deficiencies in their education and to refresh their
 knowledge of what they had learned before going to
 work in the countryside.
 As education programs declined, so did teaching

 overly intellectual, and, as a result, either were purged,
 left their jobs, or neglected their duties. Teaching
 became so risky and unpopular that many rural schools
 were forced to recruit teachers who had only a junior
 high school education. Because of the decline in
 educational and teaching standards, even university
 graduates were often poorly trained and ignorant of
 basic knowledge in their fields.
 In addition to these problems, discipline at all levels
 was severely eroded. Students were encouraged to
 rebel against their teachers and to ignore their orders
 and instructions. Teachers, in turn, cowed by leftist
 attacks, were reluctant to take firm measures against
 students, or to try to maintain order in classrooms.
 The effects of these leftist reforms and policies on the
 Chinese educational system were disastrous. Gradu-
 ates of Chinese schools and universities were unable to
 think and work on their own and were unable to
 conduct independent research in their fields. As a
 result, China turned out few competent scientists or
 other specialists needed to help modernize her econ-
 omy. According to Zhou Peiyuan (Chou P'ei-yuan),
 president of Beijing University, China today has only
 300,000 to 400,000 scientists. In contrast, Japan, with
 only about one-ninth of China's population, has more
 than 500,000.
 The dangers of this situation were recognized by
 several Chinese leaders, and in the early 1970s they
 made efforts to correct it. In 1972, for instance,
 Premier Zhou En-lai (Chou En-lai) issued orders to
 universities to introduce courses in basic theory in the
 natural sciences and tostrengthen andexpand re-
 search work. He also proposed that some graduating
 senior middle school students be allowed to enroll
 directly in universities without first working in the
 countryside. In 1973, the State Council decided to
 reinstitute university entrance exams. In 1975, under
 orders from Deng, then vice-premier, the State Coun-
 cil drew up an "Outline Report on the Chinese
 Academy of Sciences," designed to remedy the dam-
 age done to scientific research programs. All of these
 measures, however, were sabotaged by the leftists. It
 was only after the fall of the Gang of Four in October
 1976 that the government was able to take effective
 measures to reform the educational system.
 Shortly after the purge of the Gang of Four, the
 Chinese Government began to take measures to reform
 and upgrade the Chir ese educational system--a task it
 realized was essentia to the success of China's
 modernization progrz m. As a result of these measures,
 theleftist educationa`. changes undertaken both during
 and after the Cultural Revolution have been almost
 completely overturned, and attempts are under way to
 restore the pre-Cultual Revolution system.
 One of the first and most important reforms was an
 overhaul of the entrance requirements for universities
 and colleges. In Octo c er 1977 it was announced that
 university entrance examinations would be reinstituted
 and that high test scores would be the most important
 qualification for ad  ssion to college. The first round
 of exams was held in December 1977 and the second in
 July 1978. For the first round, each province drew up
 its own exam; subsequently, a nationwide standardized
 test was introduced. Although political and work
 records are still taken into account in college admis-
 sions, they can no longer offset poor performance on
 the exam or a poor academic record.
 A related reform, alsc announced in October 1977, was
 the decision to-allow 20 to 30 percent of each freshman
 class of university stu dents to enter college directly
 from senior middle school, without first working in the
 countryside. These students must all have outstanding
 academic records. Their percentage is expected to
 increase gradually.
 The national work conference on enrollment, which
 met in October 1977, announced that graduate pro-
 grams, which were almost completely destroyed during
 the Cultural Revolution, would be restored. As a result
 of this announcement, the China University of Science
 and Technology, based in Anhui since the Cultural
 Revolution, was ordered to establish a graduate school
 in Beijing and to enrol11,000 graduate students within
 two to three years. Its program is to last three years
 and will permit studeras to work and do research at the
 various institutes undfi-,r the Academy of Sciences. As
 in the case of undergraduate programs, academic
 excellence is the main qualification for acceptance,
 although work and political records remain important.

 Other schools have set up similar programs. Beijing
 University, for instance, plans to enroll about 1,000
 graduate students. Postgraduate studies are also being
 revived. According to a recent re ort there were 10,500
 postgraduate students in 1978.
 At all levels of the educational system, study and
 academic ability now are being stressed over political
 reliability, work records, and work experience. This
 new emphasis has been reflected in a number of
 reforms:
 ? Students and teachers are required to spend less time
 working in the countryside and in factories during the
 school year, and more time teaching and studying. The
 goal is for each person to spend at least five-sixths of
 available time on professional or academic work.
 ? Grading and routine examinations and tests have
 been restored. Students are no longer automatically
 promoted from grade to grade regardless of their
 academic performance.
 ? Courses of study have been lengthened in universi-
 ties, from three years to four years in liberal arts
 programs and from four years to five years in science
 programs. There appears to be no plan, however, to
 lengthen primary or secondary education from the
 current 10 years or return to the pre-Cultural Revolu-
 tion 12-year system.
 ? New textbooks are being compiled for all levels of the
 educational system. The first batch, issued in Septem-
 ber 1978, was based in part on a study of foreign
 textbooks collected by Chinese education delegations
 to Western Europe, the United States, and Japan.
 According to a recent report, China has collected more
 than 71,000 foreign science and engineering textbooks
 since 1977.
 To relieve the shortage of qualified teachers, teacher
 training courses have been started in various areas. In
 addition, academic titles have been restored, teachers
 purged during the Cultural Revolution have been
 gradually rehabilitated and reassigned to teaching
 jobs, many teachers have been given modest raises, and
 the authority of teachers over their students has been
 increased significantly. Discipline in classrooms, al-
 most unknown since the Cultural Revolution, has been
 at least partly restored. In spite of these efforts,
 however, there are still too few teachers, and many
 young people, depressed by their bleak job prospects,
 are still restless.
 25X1
 In addition, there have been important changes in the
 structure of universities and in educational administra-
 tion. Revolutionary committees formed to govern
 schools after the Cultural Revolution have been
 abolished, and in many universities the pre-Cultural
 Revolution administrative system, including the posi-
 tions of rector, dean, and president, has been restored.
 This change is intended to strengthen the control of
 teachers and academic personnel over the university
 system and reduce political interference in the aca-
 demic side of university life.
 25X1
 Many of the recent reforms aim to raise the quality of
 the Chinese educational system. One of the most
 important of these is the restoration of the "key
 university" system originally developed in the 1950s.
 Under this system, a number of model schools are to be
 developed throughout the country. These schools will
 train the best students, get the best teachers, undertake
 major research projects, and, in general, set the
 standards for first-rate academic work for other
 schools to follow. There are currently 88 such schools,
 including such institutions as Beijing, Qing Hua
 (Tsinghua), and Fudan (Futan) Universities, and the
 China University of Science and Technology in Anhui.
 Key schools are also to be set up at the primary and

 reflect the greater stress on academics. In the social
 sciences and humanities, topics banned since the
 Cultural Revolution-Western literature, Chinese
 classical literature, religion-are once more being
 taught. In the sciences, greater stress is being placed on
 courses in basic theory and on theoretical science. =
 D
 In addition to improving quality, the new reforms also
 aim at increasing the number of students educated.
 Leading Chinese educational officials have noted that
 the 900,000 students now enrolled in universities are
 far too few for China's needs, and have indicated they
 hope to increase this number to 3 million by 1985. At

 present, however, China lacks the schools and qualified
 faculty to accommodate more students. To overcome
 these problems, the Central Committee has ordered
 that the military and other organizations return the
 school buildings they occupied during the Cultural
 Revolution. According to the estimates of the Ministry
 of Education, this would create space for 150,000 extra
 university students, 370,000 middle school vocational
 students, 900,000 middle school students, and 810,000
 primary school students-not much in a country with
 almost a billion people, but still significant when
 educational facilities are so limited.
 The objective of the exchange program is to help train
 the scientists, engineers, technicians, and management
 personnel needed for China's modernization program.
 For the most part, students will do research, teach, or
 take staff management positions in industry on their
 return to China. Th( Chinese Government is so
 convinced of the value of sending these people abroad
 that it apparently is willing to risk some student
 defections.
 Like other reforms, I he plan to send students abroad to
 study will almost certainly meet political opposition-
 in this case from those raised on the Maoist belief that
 China should rely or, her own, not foreign, resources.
 In addition, there wi1 be problems recruiting qualified
 students. Because of the disarray in Chinese education
 in recent years, few college- or graduate-level students
 have received the equivalent of Western secondary
 education. Most, therefore, will be unable to take
 Western college-levelcourses. Moreover, very few
 have had any training in foreign languages--prerequi-
 site for study abroad. There will also be financial
 problems. Most Chinese education leaders are un-
 aware of the costs of educating students in Western
 countries, and in fact have been horrified when told of
 these costs during negotiations over the exchange
 program. All officials have tight budgets and a limited
 amount of foreign exchange with which to finance a
 large number of projects. As a result, unless host
 countries are prepared to foot all or part of the bills for
 Chinese exchange students, the Chinese Government
 may be unable to pay for its share of the program.
 Finally, Chinese students sent abroad will face enor-
 mous problems adjusting to societies and educational
 Other measures to increase the number of students
 include the introduction of teaching by television and
 the development of a large number of radio and
 television courses to be broadcast for the general
 public. A central radio-television university was set up
 in February 1979, and began to broadcast courses
 throughout the country. Provincialand local radio-
 television universities have also been established to
 relay the courses of the central university. These
 measures, of course, help to minimize the shortage of
 qualified teachers by reaching a large number of
 people with a small teaching staff.
 Even if these reforms can be successfully implemented,
 it will be many years before Chinese schools can begin
 to turn out the highly trained graduates the country's
 modernization program requires. Because China needs
 qualified scientists and technicians immediately, how-
 ever, the Chinese Government has drawn up plans to
 send large numbers of its best students abroad to study.
 Accordingto various reports, between 10,000-and
 40,000 students will go to Japan, the United States,
 Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand over the
 next few years. Most of them will study science and
 technology, although a few will take courses in
 business management and the social sciences. Al-
 though plans call for sending both undergraduate and
 postgraduate students, most of those sent so far have
 been researchers or scholars in their thirties and forties
 who graduated from college before the Cultural
 Revolution. At present they are the only Chinese
 "students" with the academic credentials to take
 Western university courses.
 systems radically different from their own.l
 In addition to sending students abroad, the Chinese
 Government plans to invite large numbers of foreign
 specialists to China to teach and do research. Many of
 these are to be overseas Chinese, who understand
 Chinese culture and society better than foreigners and
 who often speak Chinese. There are also plans to invite
 other foreigners as well, however.
 China plans to ask Germany to establish a
 German university in Shanghai, to be staffed by 100
 German teachers. Other countries will be asked to send
 language teachers to China to help prepare Chinese
 students for study abroad.

 system is still in such disarray that the best students
 have to be sent abroad to obtain an adequate educa-
 tion.
 Problems Facing Educational Reform
 Although there is wide support for these reform
 measures, the Chinese Government faces an uphill
 battle in trying to implement them. There are many
 reasons for this-political, geographical, cultural, and
 economic.
 The most immediate problem is the continued opposi-
 tion to reform from supporters of leftist policies. This
 resistance has been discussed at length in the Chinese
 press. Many schools continue to stress politics and
 political courses rather than academics; others still
 oblige their students and teachers to spend more time
 working in factories and on communes than they do
 teaching and studying. In one instance, the director of
 the Anhui provincial education and cultural office had
 to be reprimanded three times for his hostility to new
 education policies.
 Although some national leaders may have reservations
 about the new policies-for instance, Wu De (Wu Te)
 recently purged as head of the city government of
 Beijing, has been accused in wall posters of obstructing
 educational reform there-most of the opposition
 comes from middle- and lower-level functionaries who
 rose during the Cultural Revolution. There is also
 opposition in universities from students recruited
 under the old leftist standards who stand to lose out
 under the new system, and from people who graduated
 from school while leftist policies were in effect and who
 profited from the leftist measures. At Beijing Univer-
 sity, China's most prestigious school, this hostility is so
 great that wall poster wars broke out between old
 students and recently recruited ones in March 1978.
 This opposition will probably continue for some time to
 come and will slow the implementation of new policies.
 Related to leftist opposition are low morale and apathy
 among large numbers of intellectuals, students, and
 educators. Many of these people were purged during
 the Cultural Revolution for supporting policies similar
 to those being implemented now. Because of their
 experiences, they are reluctant to support the new
 reforms openly or vigorously for fear that the party line
 will change and they will once again be persecuted for
 their views. The government has gone to considerable
 lengths to try to reassure these people, but with only
 limited success.
 Student morale is low for another reason. Because
 there are few places in colleges and universities and
 few jobs in the cities, most young people are sent to the
 countryside to work after high school. Their jobs there
 are often menial or unprestigious, their living condi-
 tions tough and spartan, and their prospects for
 advancing or returning to the cities bleak. Since the
 fall of the leftists, who were the main supporters of this
 down-to-the-countryside program, the government has
 tried to improve the lot of young people in the
 countryside in various ways. It has made efforts to
 improve their living conditions and increase their
 wages. It has also tried to provide them with various
 means of furthering their education in the countryside,
 including television and radio courses, spare-time
 schools, and various work-study programs. More
 important, the National Conference on Educated
 Youth Settling in the Countryside, held between 31
 October and 10 December 1978, promised that as
 China modernizes and as more jobs become available
 in the cities, young people will no longer be sent to the
 countryside. It also apparently approved significant
 changes in the down-to-the-countryside program in
 some areas. In Sichuan (Szechaun) Province in
 southwest China, for instance, middle school graduates
 in nonfarming households in three prefectures and in
 all county capitals, small factories, and townships have
 been excused from going to the countryside. These
 changes, however, are likely to be counterproductive in
 the short run, increasing rather than decreasing
 student awareness of their problems. In December
 1978 and January 1979, as many of these changes were
 announced, student demonstrations broke out in
 Beijing, Shanghai, Shaanxi (Shensi) Province, and
 Yunnan Province to protest the down-to-the country-
 side program. Until the program ends completely, and

 until there are better educational and job opportuni-
 ties, many young people are likely to remain restless
 and dissatisfied, yearning for the educations and obs
 they cannot have.
 In addition to these two problems, the Chinese
 Government will have to cope with a host of difficulties
 stemming from the radical education policies pursued
 after the Cultural Revolution: the shortage of qualified
 teachers, poor discipline in schools, the lack of
 adequate textbooks and equipment, the poor back-
 grounds and training of most college-age students, the
 weakness of primary and secondary school education,
 and the need to revamp the curriculum at all levels.
 Each of these alone will take time and effort to solve.
 The real difficulty, however, is that so many intracta-
 ble problems have to be dealt with at once.
 Compounding these difficulties are a series of eco-
 nomic problems. China is a poor and underdeveloped
 country, with little money and few resources to support
 its ambitious modernization program. There will
 undoubtedly be hot competition for the little that is
 available among the various sectors of the Chinese
 economy-agriculture, industry, the military, the sci-
 ence and technology establishment-and among the
 various programs and projects that are part of the
 modernization effort. Education and educational re-
 form will probably have to take a back seat to the more
 immediate problems of modernizing agriculture and
 industry. They will therefore probably receive fewer
 resources than will be needed to solve their problems
 adequately.
 Poor planning and leadership are also likely to be
 problems. Few if any of the current leaders seem to
 have a comprehensive view of the needs of Chinese
 education or how educational reform fits into China's
 modernization program. They seem to deal with
 problems on an ad hoc basis, as they arise, with little
 thought of the consequences. A typical example is the
 program to send Chinese students abroad to study.
 Education officials involved in the program seem to
 have no clear idea of the number of students to be sent
 or the problems these students will face in foreign
 schools because of their weak backgrounds in their
 fields of study and in foreign languages.
 In addition, the Ministry of Education and other
 organs involved in making educational policy are
 understaffed and lack personnel with the experience or
 expertise to implement the new policies effectively.
 Only a few top-level education officials have had wide
 experience in educational or science and technology
 policymaking and in dealing with Western countries.
 These leaders-such as Fang Yi and Zhou Peiyuan-
 have many responsibilities and are unable to devote
 much time to any on,, of them. Zhou, for instance, is
 both head of the China Science and Technological
 Association and president of Beijing University, and
 also has many responsibilities in the science and
 technology field. At least one key education official,
 Vice-Minister of Education Li Qi (Li Chi), is in frail
 health. Junior education officials are reportedly unso-
 phisticated and unknowledgeable. Moreover, many of
 them, accustomed for years to implementing radical
 Cultural Revolution )olicies, are reportedly uncom-
 fortable implementing the new academically oriented
 policies.
 The greatest problems facing Chinese education,
 however, may be demographic and cultural, not
 political. Given China's huge population-now esti-
 mated at almost 1 billion people-it would be an
 enormous and all-but-impossible task to give an
 adequate, let alone good or thorough, university
 education to all college-age young people in the
 country. Most young people in China want to go to
 college because this will ensure them a better job. It
 would be equally difficult, at the current stage of
 China's development. to find appropriate jobs for such
 a large number of educated people. There are rela-
 tively few jobs in the mall, modern, urban sector of the
 economy, and jobs in rural areas-the majority of
 those available-den=and a relatively low level of
 formal education. Presumably, as the pace of modern-
 ization quickens, more jobs will be available.
 A second major probem is the large amount of
 linguistic and even cultural diversity within the popu-
 lation. In parts of southern China, different dialects
 are spoken even in neighboring villages. Efforts to
 make Mandarin the standard spoken language have
 proceeded slowly. In addition, in many areas-such as
 Xizang (Tibet), Xinjaang (Sinkiang), Yunnan, and
 Guizhou (Kweichow) -there are significant minority
 populations whose educational levels are well below

 those of the Chinese population. Educational and
 cultural levels are also much higher in cities and urban
 areas than in the countryside. As a result, it is difficult
 to establish uniform levels of education, uniform
 standards, and equal educational opportunities
 throughout the country. A measure of the seriousness
 of the problem was provided by the results of the 1978
 university entrance examinations. The minimum pass-
 ing scores varied sharply from province to province.
 The low was 250 in Xizang, the high. 365 in Fujian
 (Fukien).
 In many ways, educational reform in China is caught,
 at least for the short run, in a vicious circle. Any
 measure taken will almost inevitably undercut another
 one. If the best students and researchers are sent
 abroad, for instance, they will not be immediately
 available to teach in China, and teaching standards
 will remain low. If money is spent sending students
 abroad, there will be less money to implement the
 much-needed changes at home, and educational re-
 form will proceed even more slowly. If money is spent
 on "key" schools, other schools, particularly rural ones,
 will have to be neglected.
 In addition, educational reform, like other new poli-
 cies, will have to produce results in a relatively short
 period of time. In the long run, time may be on the side
 of the opponents of reform. The most committed
 supporters of the new policies are Deng Xiaoping and
 his followers, many of whom were educated abroad or
 have had wide contacts with foreign culture and
 society. This Western-educated elite, however, is
 aging-most are in their sixties or seventies, and some
 are even older. Opponents of the new policies, on the
 other hand, are probably somewhat younger. Support-
 ers of reform will have to root out leftist opposition,
 overcome apathy and fear of taking action, and win
 over both young people educated in schools dominated
 by leftist ideas and midlevel bureaucrats with little
 exposure to Western culture, all in the relatively short
 time remaining before they pass from the scene. There
 have been signs recently that the leadership is trying to
 build support for the new policies among provincial
 officials and young people by including large numbers
 of provincial party secretaries in delegations going
 win over its opponents and, more importantly, the new
 policies will have to produce striking results in an
 almost impossibly short period of time.
 25X1
 Even if the Chinese Government achieves its educa-
 tional goals, there is some question whether the stress
 on quality, elitism, and academic achievement will
 solve the problems of Chinese education or meet
 China's needs.   25X1
 At the current stage of her development, China's needs
 are more those of a developing country than a
 developed one. Its economy consists of a large,
 relatively backward agricultural sector, and a small
 but expanding modern urban one. Most jobs are in the
 agricultural sector, and require a relatively low level of
 education or technical training                  25X1
 What China needs, in the short run, is a small number
 of highly trained specialists to lead its modernization
 effort, and a much larger number of people with a
 lower, less sophisticated level of education to serve in
 the agricultural sector and help spread knowledge of
 modern technology there. As the country modernizes,
 of course, the need for highly trained specialists will
 gradually increase, and so must the number of such
 The current reform program aims at turning out
 specialists rather than low-level technicians. True,
 there are television and radio courses, part-time
 education programs, and work-study programs, all of
 which are designed to serve the needs of the rural
 population. But these seem to be used mainly as a
 means of allaying the frustration of students who fail
 to get into regular colleges and universities, and not as
 important training centers in their own right. For the
 most part, these programs are expected to be self-
 supporting, and get little or no financial aid from the
 central government. Most available money appears to
 go to the more prestigious universities and colleges.

 economy, at its current stage of development, can
 absorb. The result would be a class of overqualified,
 alienated intellectuals for whom no appropriate jobs
 are available.
 The new reforms could work against China's needs and
 best interests in other ways as well. Too much stress on
 quality and elite education could increase boththe
 social inequalities and the differences between rural
 and urban areas which the government would like to
 eliminate. Under the "key school" system, the best
 schools and universities will be located, as they have
 been in the past, in urban areas, especially in major
 cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Students who live
 in these areas will naturally have better opportunities
 to advance themselves than those from poorer rural
 areas. Moreover, as the amount of time students spend
 working in the countryside is reduced, the links of city
 dwellers and students to the countryside will become
 even weaker. Although the government plans to
 continue the down-to-the-countryside program for the
 time being, this will only increase the frustration of
 25X1     those young people obliged to work in rural areas.
 This raises yet another potential problem-that by
 stressing the importance of obtaining higher education,
 the Chinese Government will raise the expectations of
 Chinese youth unrealistically. Even under the best of
 circumstances, the number of young people in China
 interested in education far exceeds the few places
 available in Chinese universities, especially the better
 universities. The majority of Chinese youth, therefore,
 will continue to have to work either in the countryside
 or in less glamorous jobs in the cities. Yet the current
 educational program fails to prepare most students for
 this prospect. Unless this is changed, frustration and
 dissatisfaction among young people are likely to
 25X1     increase.
 In spite of the disrepute in which they are held in China
 today, the leftists in many ways correctly diagnosed a
 number of China's problems-the danger of increasing
 social inequalities, the problems of creating an
 overeducated, overqualified elite, and the need for
 people whose talents and training are suited to China's
 agricultural economy. The problem the current gov-
 ernment must solve is how to upgrade Chinese
 education without increasing frustrations and social
 tensions in the country.

 Educational Reform
 In China
 Key Points
 D
 China is seeking to come to grips with the effects of the
 Cultural Revolution that left Chinese education in a
 shambles-politicized, weak in academics, and incapa-
 ble of producing highly qualified graduates, who will
 be required for modernization. During the Cultural
 Revolution:
 ? Middle schools were closed for two years (1966-68),
 and universities for four (1966-70), and reopened with
 shorter programs, no examinations or grades, and
 highly politicized curriculums.
 ? Qualified teachers were purged and discipline
 severely eroded.
 Since October 1976, the government has been able to
 undertake effective reform measures aimed at restor-
 ing the pre-Cultural Revolution system:
 ? Courses of study are being lengthened, curr4,culums
 revised to stress academics, and enrollments will be
 increased.
 ? More students will gradually be accepted into
 universities directly after middle school without being
 sent to work in the countryside.
 ? Until reforms enable China's own schools to produce.
 needed specialists, foreign study will be permitted, and
 foreign scholars are being asked to lecture in China.
 The aging leaders still face numerous and often
 intractable problems in educational reform:
 125X1
 ? Younger officials, who are products of Cultural
 Revolution education, oppose many of the reforms, and
 are playing for time.
 ? Resources are insufficient, and education will prob-
 ably have to stand in line behind the expensive
 modernization programs.
 ? In the long run, reforms could produce more highly
 qualified graduates than the modernization program
 can absorb, creating frustration among overqualified
 graduates who, at best, must settle for rural or more
 prosaic employment.
