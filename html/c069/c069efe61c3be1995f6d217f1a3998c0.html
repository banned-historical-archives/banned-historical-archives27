DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Soviet-Yugoslav dispute: The USSR's suspension 
for five years of two large economic development 
credits to Yugoslavia--worth about $278,000,000--
marks a new stage in the deteriorating bloc-Belgrade 
relations. Moscow is evidently willing to risk the un-
favorable effects its action might have in India and 
other uncommitted states through making it apparent 
that the Soviet ec9n0mic aid was not without "strings." 
  (Page 1) 
Communist China: A resolution passed by the 
Chinese Communist party congress is the strongest 
attack by Peiping against Belgrade in the current dis-
pute. Peiping repeats its earlier attacks and now 
charges that Belgrade played a "provocateur and in-
terventionist" role in Hungary. Peiping's castigation 
could serve to keep the Yugoslav dispute alive and may 
discourage any sentiment in the Fonr. which favors soft-
pedaling the issue. (Page 2) 
IL ASIA-AFRICA 
Lebanon: Government efforts to reach a political 
settlement with the opposition have failed. Government 
leaders are showing increasing pessimism over the 
capability of the security forces, numbering some 13,000 
to 14,000, to maintain control in the face of opposition

from an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 armed rebels who 
remain entrenched in some urban quarters and who 
control much of the countryside. Extensive UAR sup-
port to the rebels continues and may be intensified. 
Army commander General Shihab continues hesitant 
to commit the army in an all-out drive against the 
rebels. (Page 3) (Map) 
Taiwan: Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's son, 
Chiang Ching-kuo, stated recently that Col. Warouw, 
acting premier of the Indonesian dissident movement, 
had arrived in Taipei and had requested Chinese Na-
tionalist air support for the dissidents. Chiang stated 
that the Chinese Nationalists had not reached a decision 
to give aid to the dissidents. 
Greece: Prime Minister Karamanlis has warned 
the American ambassador that if the British proposals 
on Cyprus, which are expected in the near future, are 
unsatisfactory, the government will be forced to take 
a harder line on Cyprus to prevent the Communists 
from exploiting this issue. Karamanlis probably wants 
to line up more American support on the Cyprus issue, 
but in any case he has_lo_facea, more vocal and deter-
mined opposition.  (Page 5)

Morocco-USSR: The Moroccan Government approved 
on 22 May a Soviet request to establish a permanent com-
mercial mission in Casablanca. On 20 April, a trade 
agreement between Morocco and the USSR was concluded 
calling for an exchange of goods valued at $14,200,000, 
more than double the amount provided for in the 1957 
agreement. In the past Morocco has been cool to Soviet 
approaches, but this new development opens the way for 
the Soviet Union to press for expanded relations.

Tunisia: New roadblocks are being erected, and 
French forces may no longer leave their bases even in 
civilian clothes. A mob tore down the flag at the French 
gendarmerie headquarters in Tunis on 26 May, but was 
prevented by Tunisian police from entering the building. 
The Tunisian delegation at the United Nations is expected 
to ask soon for a Security Council meeting on Tunisia's 
complaints against France. For the time being, Tunis 
Is still trying to avoid a showdown in order not to em-
barrass the United States and Britain.

*France: Socialist opposition to De Gaulle, despite 
a "strong and pathetic plea" by party leader Mollet to 
Socialist deputies to reconsider, was apparently the basis 
of Coty's decision to ask the presidents of the two parlia-

under which the government would be formed. Continued 
Socialist opposition and maneuvering will encourage the 
Communists in their last-ditch efforts to fashion a pop-
ular front government, and could set off the threatened 
military coup to install De Gaulle and result in serious

an attempted take-over by Defense Minister Castro and

President Larrazabars passivity in the face of a rapid 
rise in leftist influence. (Page 10)

L THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Moscow Suspends Economic Credits to Belgrade 
The USSR advised Yugoslavia on 27 May of its inten-
tion to suspend for five years the two big development-loans 
it had extended Belgrade two years ago. This move marks 
a new stage in the deterioration of interstate relations which 
has followed the bloc-Belgrade ideological rupture. Since 
the Soviet credits are to be used chiefly to provide equip-
ment for industrial construction now in the planning stage, 
their cancellation will not cause an economic crisis in Yugo-
slavia. 
Approximately $278,000,000 in credits are involved, 
including the joint East German - Soviet $175,000,000 credit 
for the construction of an aluminum plant. The Yugoslav 
announcement of the Soviet decision did not mention, how-
ever, a $54,000,000 commodity credit extended during Feb-
ruary 1956, of which about $28,000,000 remains to be drawn. 
The USSR noted, in suspending the credits, that the possibil-
ity existed "for some compensation on the basis of current 
goods exchanges." As yet, there has been no mention that 
Czechoslovakia and Poland intend- to follow Moscow's lead 
and cancel approximately $90,0009000 in credits they have 
extended to Yugoslavia. 
The hint of a possibility of some compensatory arrange-
ment suggests that no immediate complete economic boycott--
such as ensued after the 1948 break--is contemplated. 
The Soviet decision, which was probably discussed at 
the recent CEMA meeting in Moscow, suggests that the USSR 
does not contemplate any resolution of the current dispute in 
the foreseeable future. Moscow apparently is willing to risk 
any unfavorable effects its obviously political action may have 
in India and other uncommitted states where the USSR has 
been careful to avoid attaching political strings to its aid.

Peiping Renews Attack on Belgrade  
The 23 May resolution of the Chinese Communist party 
congress exceeds in harshness Peiping's 5 May blast against 
Belgrade, and charges the Yugoslav leaders played a "pro-
vocateur and interventionist" role in Hungary. 
In language resembling the 1948 Cominform resolution 
which expelled Yugoslavia, Peiping declares that the Yugo-
slav leaders have "alienated themselves" from the interna-
tional Communist movement. The resolution pointedly 
distinguishes between Yugoslav leaders and the populace. 
The resolution reflects the tone of the entire proceed-
ings of the Chinese party congress, which reaffirmed hard 
lines in domestic and foreign policy. Mao Tse-tung and his 
most influential lieutenants in the past year have increasingly 
stood for ideological orthodoxy, tighter organizational con-
trols, and greater pressures on the populace for rapid eco-
nomic development. The Chinese resolution charges that 
the Yugoslav program "betrays" Marxism and that the Yugo-
slays have "completely forsaken" the concept of Communist 
party power monopoly. 
In order to counter any speculation that the Chinese 
are supporting Stalinist opponents of Ithrushchev, Peiping 
for the second time in a week makes a special point of its 
support for Khrushchev personally. The resolution endorses 
the measures taken since 1954 toward Yugoslavia by the So-
viet central committee, "headed by Comrade N. S. Khru-
shchev." 
Yugoslavia's Borba regards the Chinese resolution as 
the death knell for the pleas for "well-meaning criticism" 
which have been voiced by some East European spokesmen. 
The paper comments that the old methods Of the Cominform 
havv�in been put into practice.

II. ASIA-AFRICA 
Lebanese Situation 
Efforts for a negotiated settlement between the Leba-
nese Government and opposition leaders have broken down 
completely. Prime Minister Sulh's statement on the presi-
dential second-term issue has been rejected outright by ex-
tremist leaders who demand Chamoun's resignation. Gov-
ernment leaders are increasingly pessimistic that security 
forces can cope with the rebels, who now control most of 
the countryside. 
Prime Minister Sulh declared on 26 May that if Gen-
eral Shihab failed to take effective action against the rebels, 
Sulh saw no alternative but to bring in foreign troops if 
Lebanon were to be saved. President Chamoun also stated 
on 27 May that the situation had become more critical and 
that General Shihab questions his own ability to deal with 
the increasingly difficult situation. He said that the gen-
eral did not, as he had on previous occasions, object when 
Chamoun suggested that foreign intervention might be the 
only solution. 
Shihab is reported to have told Foreign Minister Malik 
on 26 May that "it was not his policy to engage the opposi-
tion forces directly," and that he expected more terrorist 
bombings in Beirut, since "neither Beirut nor the other 
large cities were presently priority targets for the army." 
Claiming that the rebels now numbered between 6,000 and 
7,000 men, Shihab declared that if the army were attacked 
on all fronts, he would have to give up two thirds of the coun-
try and retire to the main cities. Shihab concluded by stat-
ing that Nasirism was a tremendous movement with which 
Lebanon would have to accommodate itself gracefully. The 
general belie'ved, however, that foreign intervention was in-
evitable since the West would not let the UAR take over the 
country. 
Buttressing the gloomy predictions of government lead-
ers is the severe deterioration of the military situation. The

Greek Premier Warns Against Unacceptable  
Cyprus Proposals  
Premier Karamanlis told the American ambassador to 
Greece on 26 May that a solution to the Cyprus problem is 
now urgent. �The premier attributed sizable Communist 
gains in the recent Greek national elections, along with the 
decline of his own pro-Western party, to the resentment 
felt by the Greek people toward Britain, Turkey, and the 
United States for their attitudes on Cyprus. 
Karamanlis warned that to prevent further exploita-
tion of this bitterness he would be forced to adopt a more 
unyielding attitude toward the Cyprus problem unless the 
forthcoming British proposals are acceptable. He denied 
that the Greek Government has any contact with, or influ-
ence over, the Greek Cypriot underground organization 
EOKA, but predicted that "great violence" would follow an-
nouncement of any unacceptable British plan. This in turn, 
he warned, could lead to communal clashes on the island 
and a possible rupture in Greek-Turkish relations. Kara-
manlis concluded with an urgent plea that the United States 
use its influence to convince Britain and Turkey that they 
must act to bring about an acceptable solution. 
Domestic problems were probably as much respon-
sible as foreign issues for the recent display of leftist 
strength in Greece. The proven vote-getting power of the 
Communists is now large enough, however, to influence 
the conduct of Greek foreign policy for the indefinite fu-
ture. If Britain's new plan for Cyprus is unacceptable to 
Archbishop Makarios and the Greek Cypriots, Karamanlis 
will be forced to take a firm stand favoring Cypriot self-
determination or risk further left-wing gains in Greek 
municipal elections next October.

Turkey May Be Considering Soviet Economic Aid 
Top Turkish leaders held

discussions 
discussed a proposed Sovietloan to rirey ox 
$300,000,000 in gold in installments, a type of loan the 
USSR has never granted a country outside the bloc. Ry-
zhov allegedly triedto tie such aid to an agreement not to 
permit rocket bases in Turkey, but Foreign Minister 
Zorlu is said to have refused to discuss this issue "at 
this time." 
Despite Turkish denials that anything of major sig-
nificance was discussed, American representatives in 
Ankara are watching the situation closely, and believe 
the presence in Ankara of the Turkish ambassador to 
Moscow may be significant. 
While such reports may be designed to worry Amer-
ican officials studying the question of aid to Turkey, it is 
possible that the Turks may feel forced to seek Soviet aid 
to solve their critical financial problems, which include 
servicing a foreign debt estimated to be as high as 
$1.5 billion. President Bayar is reported to have 
told Ryzhov in early April that Turkey might respond fa-
vorably to Soviet aid offers. 
Turkey is seeking multilateral help through the facil-
ities of the International Monetary Fund and the Organiza-
tion for European Economic Cooperation. Officials from 
these organizations are scheduled to make a survey of 
Turkey's economic troubles in early June. Meanwhile the 
Turks are seeking immediate interim economic assistance 
from the United States and West Germany.

Moroccan Government Approves Establishment of Soviet

The Moroccan Government is reported to have approved

The conclusion in Moscow on 20 April of a new trade agree-

needed because trade was inconsequential. Under the 1957 
agreement, Moroccan trade with the USSR expanded rapidly. 
During the first nine months of 1957, trade was valued at 
$3,672,000, in contrast to $204,000 during the same period 
of 1956. Despite this expansion, Soviet trade amounted to 
only slightly more than one percent of Morocco's total trade. 
While Morocco has been cool to Soviet approaches, and 
Premier. Balafrej and the King personally oppose closer rela-
tions, the government since March has been seriously con-
sidering an exchange of diplomatic representatives with the 
USSR. Establishment of a commercial mission now provides 
a new contact and opportunity for the USSR to press for ex-
panded relations. 
The reporting officer expects the unanimous decision 
of 22 May to be used to exert pressure on the United States 
for increased aid on more favorable terms.

III. THE WEST 
French Crisis 
Further efforts by President Coty to give maximum 
legality to General de Gaulle's assumption of power have 
delayed the expected direct presidential request that the 
general form a new government. Coty's designation of 
the presidents of the two houses of Parliament late 28 May 
to negotiate with De Gaulle has brought heavy pressure to 
bear on the recalcitrant Socialist party--the main stum-
bling block to a legal investiture,. 
There are indications that the pro-De Gaulle forces 
may have underestimated the depth of Socialist opposi-
tion to any form of De Gaulle regime and the willingness 
of at least a segment of the party to make good the threat, 
privately advanced by several leaders, to "go underground" 
regardless of how De Gaulle takes power. According to 
the press, even a "pathetic plea" by Socialist leader Mol-
let to Socialist deputies on 28 May failed to sway a majority 
of them. 
Continued Socialist opposition, by encouraging the 
Communists and probably other anti Gaullist elements, 
enhances the possibility of momentary military interven-
tion which had seemed slightly less imminent following 
De Gaulle's 27 May announcement that he was preparing 
to form a government and his request for the maintenance 
of public order. The prospects for a violent leftist oppo-
sition movement also are increased by prolonged resist-
ance of "republican" elements in the Assembly. 
The Swiss Government is so concerned over what it 
considers the "strong possibility" of civil war in France 
that, it has

directed troops in western Switzerland to be ready to 
man border controls and to guard against extension of 
the conflict to Swiss soil. In the event of war, Bern 
expects large numbers of refugees from the extreme left 
or right, and will grant asylum.

Venezuelan Junta Appoints New Cabinet  
New tensions may be created in Venezuela by the 
governing junta's new cabinet appointments. Finance 
Minister Mayobre, a banker and former governor of the 
International Monetary Fund, is reported to have been at 
one time closely connected with Communist party affairs; he 
was exiled by the Perez Jimenez dictatorship in 1952. 
Foreign Minister de Sola� formerly minister of justice, 
was active in the overthrow of the Perez regime and is 
said to be popular with Caracas' leftist-inclined, anti-
militarist students. Education Minister Rafael Pizani, 
exiled by the Perez Jimenez regime, was the leading pro-
ponent under conservative President Medina in 1943 of the 
provision for a 50-50 return to the government on petro-
leum revenues. Agriculture Minister Hernandez, an agron-
omist, and Justice Minister Aguilar, who was secretary of 
the Caracas bar association in 1954, appear to have been in-
active politically. 
The new appointments may precipitate an attempt at 
a take-over by Defense Minister Castro and general staff 
chief Perez Morales. The officer corps has for some time 
been concerned over junta President Larrazabal's assiv-
itv in the face of the rapid rise of leftist influence.
