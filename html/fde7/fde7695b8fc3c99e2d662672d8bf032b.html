FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
CHINA 
All active members of the Politburo 
except Mao were present to mark the 25th 
anniversary of the founding of the People's 
Republic of China. Ailing Premier Chou 
En-lai presided and made a speech at a 
reception on September 30, but he was ap-
parently still not strong enough to join 
other Chinese leaders for a walk in Pe-
king's parks the following day. 
The huge leadership turnout was highlighted by 
the return to public view of several long-absent mil-
itary officials who were under severe attack earlier 
this year and by the rehabilitation of a considerable 
number of civilian and military officials purged dur-
ing the Cultural Revolution. The new round of reha-
bilitations includes_ a number of provincial party 
leaders and .central ministers who fell early in the 
Cultural Revolution, as well as several figures ac-
tive in the early purges who were themselves dis-
graced in later phases of the convulsion. This sug-
gests that an .attempt is being made to build the 
widest possible consensus among the second-echelon 
leadership... in .anticipation of a transition period 
in which China's two top leaders are no longer active. 
Peking's major publications issued a joint edi-
torial that gave heavy _play to .the unity theme but 
offered little in .the way of policy. guidance. The 
editorial made it clear that the divisive anti-Con-
fucius campaign, which has been toned .down since 
this summer, is to remain in low gear. Although 
the campaign is to continue "for a long time," its 
main emphasis is on study rather than on attacking 
party officials, and the campaign is to be used to 
boost production. 
Consensus and continuity were also apparent in 
the brief treatment of foreign affairs in the Na-
tional Day joint editorial. A reference was made to 
Mao's "revolutionary policy in foreign affairs," a 
code phrase for the opening to the United States. 
The editorial also incorporated the slogan "dig tun-
nels deep"--a reference to possible war with the So-
viet Union that was a prominent propaganda theme in 
1972 and 1973, but has appeared less frequently re-
cently as the Chinese stressed the notion that Moscow 
was merely "feinting" to the East while preparing for 
war in the West. 
We examine :today. at Annex the question of the. 
Chinese leadership and succession in greater detail.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
ETHIOPIA 
There are signs of increasing dissen-
sion among factions in the Armed Forces 
Coordinating Committee that now runs Ethi-
opia. 
Armed forces units in the capital were placed 
on alert yesterday during an emergency session of 
the committee, according to press reports. Air 
force jets made several passes over the Fourth 
Divi-
sion Headquarters, where the ruling military group 
usually meets,-. Air force officers, who have been 
among the more radicalmembers of the committee, 
have been eclipsed by moderates in the past few 
months. The flyover suggests the air force is try-
ing to reassert its influence. 
The current discussions of the military commit-
tee reportedly,center on the issue of whether the 
Military should take over operation of the govern-
ment from civilians, Late yesterday,. the committee 
announced that it will continue to rule through a. 
civilian cabinet. 
The status of General Aman was probably also 
discusse& On September 28, the committee announced 
that Aman had been replaced as _chief of staff of the 
armed forces but that he retained the. posts of titu-
lar head of government, prime minister, and defense 
minister. 
The committee's rescission yesterday of appoint-
ments made two days earlier of Aofficers well regarded. 
by Aman appears to substantiate reports that Aman has 
lost some status.

NOTE 
World Grain Production: The world grain situa-
tion for l74/75 has tightened further. We now fore-
cast a decline of 4 percent in grain production from 
last year's record level. World wheat production is 
estimated to fall about 5 percent, while the supply 
of feedgrains, especially corn, will be even shorter 
than wheat. Production of corn in the major export-
ing countries is likely to be down by 11 percent.

A 
FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP AND SUCCESSION EXAMINED 
Premier Chou En-lai's return to the 
hospital some time in August suggests 
that we may be on the verge of the post-
Chou era in Chinese politics. The Chi-
nese themselves seem to be considering 
the possibility with considerable real-
ism, but with apprehension as well, be-
lieving as they do that his international 
prestige and legendary administrative 
abilities are irreplacable assets. They 
are, moreover, aware that Chou's death 
or permanent incapacity could further 
roil the troubled waters of Chinese pol-
itics. 
Chou Not Yet Down for the Count  
The Premier is, however, not yet out of the 
picture. He has made three appearances in the past 
two weeks. He talked  with Imelda Marcos for over an 
hour on September 20; 
Whether he will again tackle many of his duties as 
Premier and senior vice chairman of the party will 
obviously depend on the progress of his recovery. 
As long as Chou is not permanently hospitalized, 
he is likely to retain a large measure of influence, 
even if he is not so immediately engaged in day-to-
day duties as in the past. But some of Chou's in-
fluence has derived from his well-known ability to

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
master the detailed problems of running the Chinese 
bureaucracy, and this aspect of his authority is cer-
tain to be diluted in any event. 
It is equally important that Mao can now no 
longer count on Chou to carry on with current Chinese 
domestic and foreign policies after the Chairman's 
own demise. Mao Tse-tung has put a great many eggs 
in Chou's basket in the past several years, but he 
is now forced to consider the real possibility that, 
even should Chou outlive him, the Premier may not 
have the physical capacity or the willpower to carry 
through on difficult and controversial programs. In 
the past two months we have seen the first veiled 
signs that concerns of this sort have begun to 
trouble Mao. Chou's uncertain health itself makes 
him a less useful instrument to the Chairman. Mao 
must consider that the prospect of the Premier's 
demise will almost certainly intensify jockeying for 
position at lower levels--a development he cannot 
afford to ignore, but may now have to manipulate 
without Chou's assistance. 
Despite all these uncertainties, Chinese policy 
is unlikely to change greatly in the shorter run even 
if the Premier is incapacitated or dies. Mao remains 
the core of Chinese politics. Chou has pursued the 
policies with which he has been identified in recent 
years in tandem with the Chairman, not in opposition 
to him, and there is no evidence that the "great 
helmsman" desires a marked departure from the current 
line, domestic or foreign. On the contrary, he seems 
anxious to nail down present policies even more firmly. 
Interim Successors 
Most of Chou's duties as premier have already 
devolved--on a temporary basis at least--on two 
lesser and slightly younger Politburo members, Li 
Hsien-nien and Teng Hsiao-ping. Both appear to have 
Mao's trust, although neither is likely to monopolize 
the Chairman's ear to the extent that Chou has in 
recent years. Both also appear to lack the broad, 
long-term perspective that has characterized Chou's--
and Mao's--view of the world and of China's internal 
development. 
Li is a long-time lieutenant of Chou, concerned 
primarily with economic and financial matters. Teng, 
a somewhat more complicated personality with a solid 
reputation as an administrator, was for many years 
secretary general of the party and was the second

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
most important man purged during the Cultural Revo-
lution. He had a. number of disagreements with Chou 
in the early 1960s, but the Premier was instrumental 
in arranging for Teng's "rehabilitation" in early 
1973; Teng has been singing a "chouist" tune on pol-
icy matters since his return to prominence, and he 
has a well-established record of opposition to Mos-
cow. Neither man is likely to press for major de-
partures in policy should Chou become incapacitated, 
but both are more likely to be followers rather than 
initiators in the style of the Premier. 
Chou's party responsibilities are also likely 
to be fragmented should he fade further from the 
scene. Thus far, no obvious stand-ins for the Pre-
mier have emerged in this field, but many of his 
duties are probably being performed by two men from 
Shanghai who rose to prominence during and after the 
Cultural Revolution, Chang Chun-chiao and Wang Hung-
wen. Both are suave, bright, and apparently compe-
tent, but neither has more than a mere fraction of 
Chou's long experience in party affairs, and they 
may lack the Premier's famous instinct for adjust-
ment and compromise. 
Although both were associated with the manic 
phase of the Cultural Revolution, neither now seems 
wedded to the "radical" approach to policy questions 
characteristic of the late 1960s. Both seem to have 
developed ties to the more "conservative" old-line 
party administrators as a complement to their initial 
links to the "radical" wing of the party. They ap-
pear, however, to operate under some disability. 
Although Chang has apparently been slated for the 
vacant job of party secretary general for over a 
year, he has not been formally named to the post, 
apparently because of some sort of opposition. Wang 
has been rumored to be ultimately destined for Mao's 
position as party chairman--he is now the third-rank-
ing member of the party--but he is only 39 and a con-
siderable number of older party officials resent his 
meteoric rise. Both Wang and Chang appear to have 
Mao's trust, but he probably recognizes that they do 
not have the experience and--in Wang's case at least--
the perspective of Chou En-lai. 
In these circumstances, it is likely that greater 
day-to-day responsibilities for the management of Chi-
nese policy will revert to Mao. Should this in fact 
happen, the strain could well begin to tell fairly  
quickly on the Chairman, who is approaching 81  
  Moreover, in overseeing Chinese policy, Mao 
will find himself without Chou's unique combination 
of skill and foresight, and without a fully reliable 
institutional instrument capable of implementing his 
policies.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Input of the Cultural Revolution and the Anti-Con-
fucius Campaign  
The party and government bureaucracies are 
still rent to some degree by factionalism engendered 
during the Cultural Revolution; both have lost some 
of their elan, and, in each, several crucial posts 
have remained unfilled for a number of years. The 
military, the third leg of the tripod supporting 
the Chinese state, is also fissured; it played an 
extremely important role during the Cultural Revo-
lution, but it has since been badly tarnished by 
the putative coup attempt mounted by former defense 
minister Lin Piao in 1971. It is a major target of 
the current anti-Confucius campaign. The divisions 
within these three institutions have clearly been 
exacerbated by the anti-Confucius campaign, which 
has tended to revive factionalism in the provinces 
and at the national level. 
At this point, the campaign itself is merely 
sputtering along. It has been in low gear since 
early summer; significantly, this waning began in 
June when Chou became seriously ill. Given the un-
certainty regarding Chou's active future, it would 
be surprising if important forces in Peking were not 
anxious to compose differences--to the extent possi-
ble--rather than to continue to push ahead with a 
movement that is in many senses divisive. Those 
who believe they may ultimately become victims of 
the campaign obviously have personal reasons to ar-
gue for such a course of action. But Mao's acute 
sense of his own mortality tends to cut in the other 
direction; he almost certainly believes he has lit-
tle time left to imprint indelibly his own order of 
priorities on the leadership, the bureaucracy, and 
the Chinese populace. 
In the past two months, both these lines of 
thought have been evident in the Chinese press. A 
number of authoritative editorials have strongly 
stressed the theme of unity in political matters, 
arguing forcefully against "entanglement" in divi-
sive issues. At the same time, a series of arti-
cles--some almost certainly emanating from Mao him-
self--couched in the Aesopian language of historical 
analogy have touched directly on the sensitive suc-
cession question, arguing that after the death of the 
supreme leader current "progressive" policies are 
likely to be reversed unless the struggle is carried 
through to the end.

, 
FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
In fact, these two lines of argument are not 
necessarily mutually exclusive. A close reading 
of the editorials calling for unity suggests that 
an attempt is being made to damp down the quarrels 
between "left" and "right" within the Chinese lead-
ership which have helped fuel the anti-Confucius 
campaign--while pushing ahead with the effort to 
reduce the military's influence in politics, perhaps 
an even more important aspect of the campaign. This 
order of priorities is not surprising. Both Mao and 
Chou--and presumably other civilian leaders as well--
were shocked by Lin Piao's attempt in 1971 to "step 
outside the system" and settle political quarrels 
with the help of military muscle. The Chairman 
would certainly wish to ensure that this episode 
cannot be repeated once he himself is gone. 
Internecine sniping between "left" and "right," 
however, has by no means died out. The so-called 
"radicals," who have fallen on evil days since their 
period in the sun during the Cultural Revolution, 
have been attempting to shore up their position by 
making use of their continued access to the press 
to issue covert and carefully worded appeals to 
their supporters in the lower echelons of the bu-
reaucracy; they, like their putative opponents, 
are obviously anticipating the eventual demise of 
both Chou and Mao. In particular, Chiang Ching, 
Mao's wife, has successfully warded off attempts 
to circumscribe her control of cultural affairs 
by claiming that any criticism of her is, in effect, 
a criticism of Mao. Some of her manifestos, couched 
in esoteric, historical analogy, have been picked 
up by Western newsman and commentators, who have 
probably attributed to her greater strength than 
she actually possesses. In fact, while she seems 
to have hit upon some effective defensive ploys, 
"leftist" rhetoric has had little impact on policy 
decisions. Except for some relatively minor ad-
justments in the educational sphere, Chinese policy 
has been impervious to "radical" pressures. 
The uncertainties inherent in this general sit-
uation are clearly intensified by the possibility 
that Chou will die before Mao. A powerful voice ar-
guing for "moderation" and relatively pragmatic pol-
icies will be lost, and Mao will have to take into 
account a somewhat different balance of forces among 
his associates and underlings. Even so, his own 
charismatic authority should still provide consid-
erable drive to Chinese policy. It is his own 
death?in the event that Chou dies first--which 
promises to be the real watershed in Chinese poli-
tics.

'Factors for Short-Term-Immobility After Chou--and 
'Mao 
Chou's early incapacitation should not in it-
self prove crippling to China, but the odds would 
be less than even that the Chairman will be able 
to achieve to his own satisfaction a full consensus 
on the issues now troubling Chinese politics. Among 
the major questions now under debate are: 
--how to provide an acceptable definition of 
the legacy of the Cultural Revolution which 
assesses the gains and losses engendered by 
that upheaval; 
--how to remove the military from political 
administration without alienating influential 
military commanders and to "rehabilitate" and 
restore to authority experienced old-line of-
ficials purged during the Cultural Revolution 
without overly upsetting younger officials 
who were promoted as a result of those purges; 
--how to preserve the revolutionary fervor 
that brought the communists to power, while 
training and encouraging technical experts 
who can modernize China and expand its indus-
trial base; and 
--above all, how to cope with the wide range 
of problems deriving from the presence of a 
hostile Soviet Union on China's northern bor-
der. 
This last problem is one that seems to be par-
ticularly troubling to the Chairman recently. While 
it is highly unlikely that any influential figure is 
arguing for a rapprochement with Moscow, propaganda 
associated with the anti-Confucius campaign suggests 
that Mao believes that some important individuals--
perhaps within the military--think it is in China's 
interest to reduce the present high level of Sino-
Soviet tension. Paradoxically, Mao seems willing to 
risk the divisiveness caused today by the anti-
Confucius campaign in order to weed out or neutral-
ize such suspected opposition and, thereby, ensure 
that the Chinese leadership will present a united 
front to the Soviet menace after his death. Since 
the Lin Piao affair, Chinese officials at all levels 
have frequently expressed apprehension that Moscow 
would try to meddle in Chinese domestic affairs, 
attempting to exploit leadership differences, once 
Mao was no longer on the scene.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
In fact, arrangements the Chinese are known to 
have made in the wake of the Lin imbroglio, together 
with less definite signs that these arrangements are 
being modified in the wake of Chou's illness, indi-
cate that Peking expects to establish some sort of 
collegial leadership once the Chairman and the Pre-
mier have either died or become permanently incapac-
itated. In the absence of a leader of Mao's unique 
stature or of an obvious primus inter pares such as 
Chou, the Chinese would almost certainly find it ex-
pedient to resort to some kind of consensus policy-
making. But in these circumstances the chances are 
good that Chinese policy will in fact- be no policy 
at all. In the initial succession period, there 
will almost certainly be no single individual--and 
perhaps no group of individuals--with sufficient 
,authority and firmness of purpose to reverse current 
policy trends or .even to push ahead in directions 
already charted. Even while Mao and Chou are on the 
scene, the Chinese have been unable to agree on a 
formally designated party secretary general or a 
minister of defense; such impasses are likely to be 
multiplied in the. early succession period. A general 
immobility on policy issues--at least the major ones--
might persist for several years. 
Moreover, persistent difficulties facing the 
Chinese--population pressure coupled with the lim-
ited availability of arable land, industrial moderni-
zation, and the security of a Chinese state militar-
ily inferior to the superpowers, to name but a few--
are surely not going to vanish in this period. The 
political history of the past decade indicates there 
is a wide range of views within the regime on how 
best to tackle these problems; differences in ap-
proach are almost certain to be intensified and ex-
acerbated by personal frictions and even hatreds 
arising from the Cultural Revolution and its after-
math. In such a situation, a struggle for supremacy 
is quite likely, and policy questions could easily 
become entangled in the fight for personal advantage. 
In short, a period of partial immobility could be 
followed--although this is of course by no means 
certain--by a period of rapid and wide swings in 
policy of the sort that characterized China in the 
late 1950s and 1960s. 
The Long-Term Prospect is Better  
In the longer perspective, however, and despite 
these immense obstacles, the trend is likely to be 
in the direction of "moderation" and relative pragma-
tism. And even if pulling and hauling does develop, 
it is most unlikely that China will come apart at 
the seams. The regime survived the enormous strains 
of the Cultural Revolution intact and has absorbed 
the blow of the Lin "coup" (mounted by Mao's desig-
nated successor) with relative ease. The forces 
that pull China together are much strohger than 
those that push it apart, and this will continue to 
be true when neither Chou nor Mao is politically 
active.
