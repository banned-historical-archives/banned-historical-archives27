 SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS
 Information available as of 13 ]nnnarv 1983 was
 used in the preparation of [his Estimate.
 THIS ESTIMATE IS ISSUED BY THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL
 INTELLIGENCE.
 THE NATIONAL FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE BOARD CONCURS.
 The following intelligence organizations participated in the preparation of the

 The Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security
 Agency,  and  the  intelligence  organizations  of  the  Departments  of  State  and
 the Treasury.

 This Estimate examines recent shifts in China's policies
 toward the United States and the USSR. It focuses on the
 implications of these changes for the United States over the
 next several months.
 A mix of factors-some of which have been debated in 13eiiing for
 several years-was behind the emergence over the past two years of
 policies that put some distance between Washington and Beijing and
 that opened the door to a reduction of tensions with the Soviet Union.
 Deng Xiaoping was attempting to establish a stable political environ-
 ment for his successors and, we believe, wanted to remove foreign
 policy as a potentially contentious domestic issue. Longstanding Chinese
 skepticism about the value Washington placed on its China connection
 and about US intentions toward Taiwan was reinforced by a growing
 sense of nationalism about foreign issues in general. Bening saw signs
 that Moscow, because of domestic economic difficulties and foreign
 burdens, was seriously interested in resuming a dialogue with China.
 Some Chinese argued that reducing tensions with the Soviets would
 enable China to devote more resources to the modernization effort.
 Finally, some in the leadership also believed that an excessively close
 identification of China's interests with those of the United States was
 undercutting China's credentials in the Third World.
 This web of interlocking factors, in our view, has produced policy
 shifts that Beijing hopes will maximize its bargaining power with both
 the United States and the Soviet Union. It has not, however, altered
 Beijing's fundamental global balance sheet. The Chinese still regard the
 USSR as their main threat and the United States as the only viable
 counterweight to Soviet expansionism, in Asia and around the world.
 The Chinese also believe that continued access to US trade and
 technology are very important to their modernization goals. We believe
 Beijing's  current  tactics  are intended  in  part  to  gain  a  stronger
 commitment of support from the United States. This objective has been
 frustrated by what they see as continuing US reluctance to make as
 clear as China would like that solid relations with Beijing are more
 i
 SECRET
 important than maintaining a highly visible relationship with Taiwan
 authorities.  This  perception  appears  to persist  in  Bening,  despite
 repeated US reminders that the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act
 obligate the United States to a certain level of support to Taiwan.
 We believe the key implications for the United States of these
 adjustments in Chinese policies are the apparent depth of Beijing's
 skepticism about US intentions toward China and its new willingness to
 play off its links with Washington against Moscow, and vice versa. The
 Chinese already have demonstrated to the United States that they are
 not afraid to deal independently and directly with the Soviet Union.
 Chinese perceptions of US attitudes toward China and Taiwan will, in
 our view, be a maior influence on Beiiing's foreign policies for the
 remainder of this year.
 In our view, some important constraints create a floor beneath
 which the Chinese do not wish their relations with the United States to
 erode. China's bargaining power with the Soviet Union is derived from
 Beijing's relationship with Washington; by the same token, the Chinese
 recognize that their value to the United States comes from a common
 interest in halting Soviet expansionism. Moreover, China's development
 strategy is keyed to good relations with the United States, Japan, and
 Western Europe, thus setting some limits on any improvements in Sino-
 Soviet relations.
 Even if the Sino-US relationship improves, we do not expect the
 Chinese to quickly abandon their efforts to reduce tensions with the
 Soviet Union. Any negotiations on the key security issues that have long
 divided the two countries will be protracted and contentious, but eve
 cannot rule out the possibility of significant progress if the Soviets make
 major concessions or Sino-US relations remain unsettled.

 SECRET
 STriving for Maneuverability
 1. Significant changes in China's foreign policy,
 especially toward the United States and the USSR,
 have emerged  over  the  past  two  years.  The  key
 ingredients have been an attenuation of diplomatic
 and  strategic  relations with  the  United  States,  an
 attempt to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union, and
 a  renewed  emphasis  on  relations  with  the  Third
 World. The Chinese have described these changes as
 tactical moves necessary to underscore the independ-
 ence of  their foreign  policy,  which some Chinese
 apparently believe  is  threatened by an excessively
 close relationship with  Washington.  We believe, in
 fact, that a mix of factors, some of which are closely
 related, went into the decision to put some distance
 between Beijing and  Washington, and to resume a
 dialogue with Moscow. These factors were:
 - A iudgment that Moscow, because of increasing
 economic difficulties at home and growing bur-
 dens overseas, was prepared to seriously explore
 the possibility of reducing tensions with China
 and a desire to explore the possibility of obtain-
 ing from the USSR technological assistance in
 upgrading  China's aging  industrial  plant  and
 expanding mutually beneficial trade.
 - A trend toward more conservative domestic poli-
 cies and a desire to remove potentially conten-
 tious foreign policy issues that might complicate
 the  succession  prospects  for  Deng  Xiaoping's
 heirs.
 - China's adverse reaction to trends in US policy
 toward China and Taiwan, especially regarding
 arms sales to Taiwan and technology transfer to
 China, and the consequent conclusion that the
 United States was placing decreased value on
 China as a strategic partner.
 Concern that a widespread perception that Chi-
 na was too close to the United States was under-
 cutting its credentials and influence in the Third
 World.
 - A iudgment that reduced tensions with the USSR
 would enable China to divert resources from the
 military to the modernization effort.
 2. In our view, these considerations led the Chinese
 to begin adjusting their policies in ways they hoped
 would enhance their flexibility and leverage with both
 Washington and Moscow. The Chinese leaders hoped
 at  the same time to reduce their vulnerability to
 charges of being too close to the United States at the
 sacrifice  of  their  national  interests.  The  domestic
 priorities of the Dengists-which include reducing the
 influence of the military, preparing the ground for a
 major  party  purge,  and  managing  criticism  of  the
 social effects of China's opening to the  West-also
 probably  reinforced  the leadership's inclination  to
 pursue a more cautious foreign policy.
 3. The extent to which domestic political impera-
 tives have affected China's foreign policy course dur-
 ing  the  past  two  years  is  unclear.  Foreign  policy
 reviews over the last few years have occurred at a time
 when Deng's overriding concern has been to strength-
 en the political base of his handpicked successors and
 to promote his comprehensive reform program.  We
 believe China's foreign policy direction over the com-
 ing months will continue to be influenced by the
 domestic  political  jockeying  associated  with  Deng
 Xiaoping's attempts to ensure a stable political envi-
 ronment for his successors.
 4. From the outset of Sino-US relations, there have
 been elements in the leadership who, citing widely
 held reservations about relying on a foreign power,
 have argued for a more independent, balanced course.
 We believe that skepticism about the benefits China
 will gain from its relations with the United States is a
 factor with which the leadership has had to reckon
 and that this factor becomes particularly important
 when the leadership perceives Sino-US relations to be
 strained. The Chinese repeatedly stress their sensitivity
 to what they perceive as affronts to their national
 dignity, and a highly nationalistic tone has marked
 their complaints about US policy on Taiwan. Moves

 SECRET
 during the past two years in the direction of a more
 balanced  posture toward  Moscow and  Washington
 complemented  other  policy  compromises  such  as
 tighter controls over  Western influences on  Chinese
 society.
 5.  When relations are strained, concessions by any
 leadership to the United States could became a politi-
 cal liability. We do not have reliable indications that
 policy toward the United States has been a maior
 domestic  political  issue  in  which  key  leaders  are
 adopt a  cautious,  skeptical  approach  toward  both
 Washington and Moscow. We believe Deng's succes-
 sors would seek to maintain the current consensus
 while consolidating their authority. Nonetheless, we
 cannot rule out the possibility that Deng's departure
 would create disarray in the policymaking establish-
 ment and that strains with the United States would be
 more difficult to manage. Although we believe there
 are no strong pro-Soviet elements in the leadership,
 pressures could build on Deng's successors to under-
 take ales inhibited approach toward Moscow if Sino-
 US relations remain troubled and the Soviets demon-
 strate increased flexibility.
 6. Chinese attempts to insulate Sino-US trade and
 access  to  US  technology  from  the  vicissitudes  of
 triangular politics would also suffer under these cir-
 cumstances. While there have been some tensions in
 the trade sector over the past year, we believe these
 were due to Beiiing's efforts to reduce the large deficit
 it had with the United States and to obtain access to
 the largest possible share of the lucrative US textile
 market. In our view, political difficulties have not so
 Ear significantly influenced Beijing's approach to these
 problems. Over the longer run, if the Chinese continue
 to perceive an unstable relationship with the United
 States, we expect political problems will begin to affect
 other sectors of the relationship. At the same time, of
 course, Beiiing's current determination to enhance its
 access to US trade and technology provides the United
 States with some leverage in the political as well as the
 economic aspects of the relationship.
 8. US  attitudes  toward  China,  especially  future
 actions toward Taiwan, will play a crucial role in
 determining the extent to which Beijing pursues these
 new policy directions. We believe the Chinese have no
 clear-cut, long-term expectations Eor their talks with
 the USSR. In fact, they clearly still consider the USSR
 the principal threat to China, and they have done
 nothing over the past two years to suggest they are
 likely to change that view. In any event, the conditions
 the Chinese have set Eor substantial progress in the
 talks-Soviet withdrawal of support for Vietnamese
 expansionism, removal of the Soviet military presence
 in Afghanistan, and a substantial drawdown of Soviet
 troops along the Chinese border-ensure lengthy ne-
 gotiations, which we believe the Chinese will use to
 maximize their bargaining position with the United
 States.
 9. The Chinese want to use the discussion with
 Moscow, in part, to try to influence US policy on
 important bilateral and other issues. If, for example,
 the Chinese conclude that the qualitative or quantita-
 tive  levels  of  US  arms  provisions  to  Taiwan  are
 inconsistent with the 17 August communique-and
 especially if it is done in a highly visible manner-we
 believe Beijing will increase the tempo of its contacts
 with Moscow. In short, we believe the Chinese will
 exploit continued talks with the Soviets to make it
 appear that the United States will pay a geopolitical
 price for not actively seeking improved Sino-US ties.
 The Chinese also are likely to seek to make the United
 States appear out of step with its allies on the China
 question and will continue to court broad support
 from  the Third  World,  including  criticism of  US
 policies in various regions.
 10.  We believe, however, that there are important
 considerations that currently serve to constrain China's
 indicates that the Chinese want to protect and
 en  ance  the bilateral Sino-US  relationship.  In  our
 4
 SECRET
 25X1
 25X1
 225X1
 225X1
 view, the Chinese also recognize that some sort of
 reasonably solid relationship with the United States is
 necessary iE they are to have any significant leverage
 with the USSR. By the same token, Beiiing's aspira-
 tions as a Third World leader fighting the "hegemonis-
 tic" activities of both superpowers would be seriously
 undercut by too quick a reconciliation with Moscow.
 On the other hand, the Chinese have demonstrated a
 desire to keep Washington guessing about the depth of
 any  warming trend  in  Sino-Soviet  relations. ~
 11. There are other important  factors  that  add
 uncertainty to Beiiing's future policies. The extent to
 which the USSR is prepared to propose significant
 concessions, for example, could affect the tempo of
 improvement in  Sino-Soviet  ties. Should the Soviets
 offer troop withdrawals, we believe the Chinese would
 respond favorably to the inevitable Soviet demands for
 counterconcessions, such as a Chinese troop pullback.
 Here, too, the degree to which the Chinese publicly
 portray them as a substantial move toward normaliza-
 tion of Sino-Soviet relations would, in our view, de-
 pend at least in part on the status of Sino-US relations
 at the time.
 Chinese Attitudes Toward The United States
 12. For more than a decade, there have been three
 fundamental considerations in China's US policy-
 Taiwan, the Soviet Union, and trade, including tech-
 nology transfer. Chinese obiectives in these key areas
 have been to obtain US recognition of Beijing's sover-
 eignty over Taiwan and to induce the United States to
 end its military support to Taiwan,  to establish a
 "strategic" relationship with the United States that
 would serve as a counterweight to the Soviet threat to
 China, and to utilize US technological expertise to
 support China's modernization effort.
 13. For Bening, US intentions toward Taiwan have
 always been the most important obstacle to the devel-
 opment  of  Sino-US relations.  The emotionalism  of
 Chinese attitudes about sovereignty cannot be overem-
 phasized, and some Chinese leaders have always ques-
 tioned US intentions regarding Taiwan. China's objec-
 tives regarding Taiwan, in fact, are bound to create
 tensions with any US leadership. Chinese officials over
 the years have been advised by leaders of both  US
 parties that no US administration will guarantee a
 termination of arms sales to Taiwan. Beijing's flexibili-
 ty on the issue has fluctuated over the years, in our
 view, depending on its perception of US attitudes and
 intentions toward the issue. When the Chinese have
 concluded that the United States was mindful of their
 sensitivities on Taiwan and moving toward their posi-
 tion-regardless of the pace-Beijing has been gener-
 ally upbeat about the overall nature of the relation-
 ship. On the other hand, periods during which the
 Chinese perceived "backsliding" on Taiwan have been
 accompanied by stagnation or tensions in other aspects
 of the relationship.
 14. In the euphoric atmosphere that followed nor-
 malization of relations in  1978, the Chinese clearly
 believed that progress would be made in all aspects of
 the relationship in more or less equal fashion. While
 the Chinese almost certainly were not entirely satisfied
 with  the  letter  of  the  normalization  agreement-
 especially on the knotty question of US arms sales to
 Taiwan-their expectations for further progress were
 high, and in retrospect excessive. During 1981 and
 1982,  however,  the Chinese undertook a series of
 foreign policy reviews that reflected, among other
 considerations, a iudgment that the short-term pros-
 pects Eor accomplishing their goals toward the United
 15. After several months of discussion, some of it
 apparently contentious, a leadership consensus on poli-
 cy toward the United States-as well as the Soviet
 Union-began to emerge in  1982.  Criticism of US
 policies in other parts of the world was stepped up.
 This approach reflected Chinese resentment over what
 they perceived as an attempt by the United States to
 offer a security relationship in exchange for Chinese
 acquiescence in US arms sales to Taiwan. At the same
 time, senior Chinese officials intensified their com-
 plaints to US officials and others about the US failure
 5
 SECRET
 25X1
 'L5X1
 25X1
 25X1
 to honor earlier "commitments" to transfer technology
 to China. On the other hand, Chinese officials went
 out of their way to assure US officials and businessmen
 that trade should not be affected by the tensions in
 other aspects of the relationship.
 16. The signing of the ioint communique in August
 1982 has not substantially altered Beijing's tactical
 approach to the United States. Despite the difficulties
 of the past two years, we believe China's long-term
 objectives in its US relationship remain basically un-
 changed Erom those described earlier in this Estimate.
 The Chinese have done nothing either with the United
 States or with the USSR that would close the door to a
 resumption of closer ties in the Future. In fact, Huang
 Hua's statement to the Council of Foreign Relations in
 early October 1982 that China and the United States
 share "many things in common" in the international
 arena  suggests  to  us  that  Bening  remains  deeply
 interested in resuming-at some point-the strategic
 dialogue and that his remarks reflect some optimism
 about the long-term prospects for the relationship.
 17. On the other hand, we believe the Chinese may
 be far less sanguine about any significant improve-
 ment in bilateral ties in the short run. The principal
 obstacle to a resumption of forward movement in the
 relationship, in our view, is Beijing's perception that
 the United States underestimates the importance to
 China of Taiwan. Indeed, Huang's contention at the
 private and influential Council of Foreign Relations
 that "some people" in the United States are seeking to
 use Taiwan to undermine Sino-US relations and that,
 as a result, the relationship could "go down the drain"
 is a clear reminder that the Taiwan issue remains the
 key irritant in bilateral relations.
 18. Huang's remarks and other similar comments
 by top Chinese leaders over the past several months, in
 our view, also suggest that the Chinese believe there is
 some political advantage to implying that China can
 be "lost" again. Remarks such as Huang's, therefore,
 are designed to imply that the Chinese are prepared to
 restrict their approach to the USSR if the United States
 takes what Beijing regards as the proper steps in the
 Sino-US bilateral  relationship.  It  also suggests,  we
 believe, that the Chinese judge that there is a receptive
 audience to this suggestion in the United States.
 19. Continuing Chinese protestations that the Unit-
 ed  States does  not  intend  to  live up  to  Beijing's
 interpretation of the August communique suggests to
 that  the  United  States  was  determined  to
 maintain its support to Taiwan. The Chinese want to
 be reassured about both the form and the substance of
 the US link with Taiwan. They have shown particular
 sensitivity to the "quality and quantity" provision in
 the communique, and have warned that they will
 watch carefully for a bona fide decline in US sales to
 Taiwan.  Chinese  leaders  cite  US  unwillingness  to
 specify a precise turning point Eor such reductions as
 demonstrating a lack of US sincerity toward fulfilling
 provisions of the August communique. At the same
 time, their concerns about US intentions mount when
 the United States displays public, official interest in
 20.  We  believe  that  one  of  China's  immediate
 objectives is to persuade the United States to reduce
 the publicity of its arms sales to Taiwan and of its
 overall links with Taiwan. Not only would this remove
 the need Bening feels to react publicly, but it would
 diminish the opportunity for domestic critics to fuel
 anti-US fires in Beijing. In our view, another Chinese
 objective in the coming months is to engage the Uni[ed
 States in ongoing consultations on arms sales, a move
 that would help the leadership, if it chose, to interpret
 any future sales in the best possible light for the
 domestic audience. Over the longer term, the Chinese
 almost certainly believe such consultations would en-
 hance their ability to ensure diminishing sales.
 21. There are important constraints on how far the
 Chinese want distancing from the United States to go.
 A  sharp  deterioration  in  Sino-US  relations  almost
 certainly would undercut China's relations with Japan
 and other Western countries, a prospect that Bening
 clearly wishes to avoid. Chinese officials in the past
 have attempted to assure Japanese leaders that prob-
 lems with  Washington would not impair ties with
 Tokyo. Chinese leaders understand that China's ability
 to  acquire  high  technology  from  Japan  could  be
 complicated  by  a  serious  downturn  in  Sino-US
 relations.

 22. Despite their public rhetoric about China's abil-
 ity to deal "independently" with the Soviet threat, we
 believe most Chinese leaders still value the United
 States as the only real strategic counterweight to the
 USSR and are trying to establish a floor below which
 they do not want the US relationship to go. Clearly,
 the Chinese have reduced-to a more realistic level-
 their expectations about the  degree to  which the
 United States and China are likely to cooperate in any
 military sense against the USSR. Nonetheless, in our
 view they recognize that without some form of reason-
 ably solid US relationship their flexibility to deal with
 the Soviet Union would be reduced sharply. Moreover,
 Beijing's position and influence in areas where US and
 Chinese interests coincide-such as Indochina and
 Afghanistan-would also be reduced.
 23. Finally, we believe that the Chinese recognize
 that over time their access to US technology and
 markets would be adversely affected, despite Beiiing's
 attempts to protect it, if the relationship is not put on a
 more solid footing. Imports of US high technology,
 especially in areas such as energy development and
 aircraft, are crucial to China's long-term moderniza-
 tion plans. Moreover, the United States-now China's
 third leading trade partner, after Hong Kong and
 Japan-will remain an important target market in
 China's long-term export planning. Even currently,
 the Chinese are deeply concerned that growing pro-
 tectionist sentiments in the United States and the West
 will hamper their modernization effort by preventing
 them  Erom  earning the foreign exchange required to
 pay Eor their large capital import needs.
 24. In the final analysis, however, we cannot rule
 out the possibility that a downward spiral in Sino-US
 relations will continue well past any floor that Beijing
 hopes to set for it The US relationship with Taiwan, as
 well as Beijing"s own growing contacts with Moscow,
 will make it difficult for China to stabilize what, from
 Beiiing's viewpoint, is currently an unsettled relation-
 ship with the United States, and one that is politically
 charged at home.
 Beijing's Approach to Moscow
 25. Over the past decade,  China's main  Foreign
 policy goal has been to construct political alignments
 and strategic counterweights against the Soviet Union.
 In Beijing's view, Moscow has been, and remains, an
 aggressively expansionist power which seeks to expand
 its political and military influence as a "hegemonist'
 throughout the world. Countering Soviet designs while
 avoiding the kind of provocation that could bring a
 confrontational response from  Moscow  have set the
 limits on China's policy.
 26. The Chinese see military power and military
 assistance as Moscow's main, if not sole, instruments of
 political influence in Asia. Moscow's efforts to trans-
 late  respect  for  its  power  into  influence  and  its
 provision  of  military  aid  to  states  around  China's
 periphery have remained the focus of concern among
 Chinese leaders. It is Eor this reason that China has
 been most preoccupied with Soviet influence in Viet-
 nam and the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan
 and Mongolia.
 27. The sustained Soviet military buildup along the
 Sino-Soviet border obviously represents China's prima-
 ry national security threat. Beijing has regarded this
 buildup since the mid-1960s as Ear beyond the needs
 for self-defense, as reason to hold overall Soviet mo-
 fives in question, and as proof of Moscow's intentions
 to use the threat of military force for political ends.
 While the Chinese behave as if they do not expect the
 Soviets to mount an attack on China unless there is a
 severe provocation, we believe China's strategy and
 military modernization are proceeding on the assump-
 tion that Soviet capabilities will continue to improve-
 a trend that can only  widen the gap between the
 quality of the two forces.
 28. In addition to this growing sensitivity to the
 continuing Soviet effort to encircle China, militarily as
 well as through a worldwide political campaign, Bei-
 jing's  policy  toward  the  USSR  in  the  1970s  also
 reflected  the  historical legacy  of  racial  animosity,
 political differences, ideological conflict, and national
 resentment that had long animated Chinese percep-
 tions of Russia and the USSR. As a global competitor
 with the USSR and as an Asian power with close ties to
 Japan,  the United  States  played  a  central  role  in
 China's anti-Soviet security calculus.
 29.  We have a limited appreciation of  how the
 Chinese assess the factors now shaping their Soviet
 policy.   25X1
 guidance early in 1981 called for improving people-to-
 people ties with the USSR. The guidance apparently
 was based on a Chinese conclusion that the Soviets
 were being  impelled by  difficulties at  home  and
 abroad to seriously attempt some normalization  in
 7
 SECRET
 relations with China. The Chinese, in our view, also
 calculated that the Soviets' difficulties would allow
 China to compete with them politically by improving
 ties with some East European parties and pro-Soviet
 Western Communist parties and by striking a more
 independent  posture  toward  the  Third  World.  In
 short, the initial Chinese response to Soviet overtures
 for improved ties was couched in essentially competi-
 tive terms.
 30. By January 1982, the Chinese had begun to
 view their relations with the Soviets from differing
 perspectives. The Chinese concluded, we believe, that
 their modernization effort required prolonged stability
 on their borders-an objective that has been evident in
 their initiatives to improve relations with North Korea,
 India, and the Southeast Asian countries-and that
 reduced  tensions  on  the  Sino-Soviet  border  would
 allow a diversion of resources from military to nonmil-
 itary purposes. At the same time, those voices arguing
 that Sino-Soviet relations should be exploited for their
 practical  benefits,  such  as technological  assistance,
 apparently began to gain a more receptive hearing
 among top policymakers.  We believe this occurred
 because the  Chinese  had  begun  to  conclude that
 further economic retrenchment was necessary  and
 that China would profit more from using all sources,
 including Soviet, for refitting its existing industrial
 base-much of it Soviet-built-than from seeking new
 plants and equipment solely Erom Japan and the West.
 31. In our view, Beijing's primary concern about
 the future of Sino-US relations strongly influenced its
 calculations about policy toward Moscow. Knowing
 that the Soviet proposal in September 1981 to reopen
 border talks was timed to exploit Sino-US differences,
 Chinese officials deferred response, while informing
 the United States of the offer as a reminder that
 Beijing had other options. As Moscow pressed Beijing
 with new overtures, Beijing delayed resumption of
 political talks until after the August communique had
 eased the Sino-US crisis. This reduced the potential for
 negative effects on Sino-US relations and at the same
 time  allowed  Beijing  to  address  Moscow  from  a
 strengthened position, enhancing prospects for exact-
 ing concessions.
 32. China's behavior is similar to its conduct in
 1979 when the Chinese delayed opening talks with the
 Soviets until after the visit of Vice President Mondale
 to Beijing in August had satisfied the leadership about
 US intentions. Judging by this 1979 pattern, we believe
 Beijing hopes to make at least some progress during
 Secretary Shultz's visit before resuming contacts to
 explore improved ties with Moscow.
 Looking Ahead
 33.  We believe that Beijing in the coming months
 will continue on a course with Moscow that will:
 -Improve Chinese flexibility in the Soviet-Chi-
 nese-US triangle. The Chinese hope that dealing
 more positively with Moscow will increase Chi-
 na's short-term leverage with the United States;
 they are probably even more hopeful that it will
 work to their advantage over the longer run.
 - Establish a permanent political channel to the
 USSR to probe Soviet positions on basic issues.
 We expect the Chinese to maintain pressure on
 all key issues-Soviet forces on their border and
 in Mongolia and the Soviet role in Afghanistan-
 but to give the Soviet-Vietnamese alliance priori-
 ty treatment.
 - Reduce tensions and improve access to whatever
 material benefits are available from expanded
 trade,  economic,  academic,  and  technological
 ties with the Soviets.
 - Demonstrate that China is not intransigent in
 dealing with the Soviets. Beijing especially wants
 its image of coequality with  Washington and
 Moscow to influence views of the Sino-Soviet
 relationship in Europe and the Third World.
 34. Neither intelligence reporting nor official Chi-
 nese statements indicate that Beijing expects rapid
 progress toward a resolution of the basic issues. Beijing
 has also shown in talks so far that it will push Moscow
 to take the first step in dealing with Chinese security
 concerns. We believe, however, that the Chinese are
 prepared to strike some compromises with the Soviets
 on the military situation alone the border
 If the
 Chinese made progress with the Soviets here, Beijing,
 in our view, would not require immediate, similar
 progress on Indochina and  Afghanistan to keep the
 dialogue going. But we would expect the Chinese to
 keep  pressing  their  case  in  these  two  areas.  The
 8
 SECRET
 ,, ~sx1
 25X1
 Chinese have solid incentives to maintain a hard line
 on Afghanistan and to keep the Soviets' feet to the fire
 on Kampuchea.
 35. Even if Bening is flexible in dealing with Soviet
 proposals on the military situation-by agreeing to
 initially symbolic steps along their common border or
 in  Mongolia,  for example-we do not believe the
 Chinese  will  follow  suit  on  the other  key  issues.
 official Chinese statements
 point out clearly that changes in the Soviet-Vietnam-
 ese relationship are a priority for China. The tactical
 benefits  from  this Chinese  position  are obvious-
 Hanoi's distrust of Moscow is already evident in its
 reaction to the Sino-Soviet talks.  Moreover, China's
 proposals on Indochina, which were tabled at the first
 round of talks, directly serves ASEAN's interest in an
 independent and neutral Kampuchea. A less adamant
 stand against Vietnamese presence would, in the Chi-
 nese view,  threaten to undermine ASEAN's consen-
 sus-backed by Bening-on the need for a full Viet-
 namese withdrawal.
 36. China does not expect the Soviets to negotiate
 seriously about their presence in Aghanistan. Beijing
 knows that the Soviets do not regard China's position
 as a decisive factor in the situation, that Moscow has
 demonstrated  it  is engaged  in  an  extended  anti-
 insurgency effort, and that China can use its opposi-
 tion to the Soviet presence to good effect in its anti-
 hegemony effort in the Third World.
 37. A failure to make progress on the basic issues
 will not prevent Beijing from seeking improvement in
 other aspects of relations with the Soviets, both for
 their own sake and to cushion the dialogue. Moscow,
 for example,  is sure to push for an expansion  of
 mutually beneficial economic and cultural ties. The
 Chinese are likely to be forthcoming on  trade if
 Moscow offers to fill Chinese orders for raw materials
 and chemicals. The Soviets are willing to dispatch
 advisers to China as well as to make Soviet technology
 more available to China, but, except Eor the upgrading
 of portions of China's aging, Soviet-designed industrial
 plant, the political legacy of the 1950s and the more
 attractive opportunities Eor technology transfer from
 the West will place strict limits on how far China is
 willing to go.
 38. In  the  last  year  or  so,  Beijing's  renewed
 contacts  with several pro-Soviet parties in  Eastern
 and Western Europe, including the French Commu-
 ^ists, have sent mixed signals. China's greater activi-
 ty in the international movement  appears to be
 motivated by a desire to increase competition with
 Moscow. It also reflects a general revival of China's
 desire to pursue an independent line abroad, and in
 selected areas-particularly in the Third World-to
 refurbish Chinese ideological credentials. The Chi-
 nese  may  flirt  with  Moscow's  interest  in  party
 dealings, but we do not expect them to reciprocate
 soon.
