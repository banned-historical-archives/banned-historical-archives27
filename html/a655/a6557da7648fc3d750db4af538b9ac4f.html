 Washington's ultimate goal, the
 CIA chief contends, is heading
 off a massive refugee crisis on
 America's southern border.
 Cl Mr. Casey, with so much attentlon fo-
 cused right now on Nicaragua and the con-
 tras, can you give us your assessment of
 the impact of the anti-Sandinista guerrillas?
 A They're creating a great deal of dis-
 array and pressure on the regime.
 They've damaged the economy. Daniel
 Ortega Saavedra (leader of the Sandinis-
 ta junta) said a couple of weeks ago that
 the contras have cost them about one
 third of their exports.   .
 The main impact, however, is to di-
 vert Sandinista leaders from supporting
 the insurgency in El Salvador and bring
 pressure on them to negotiate sensibly
 to a more peaceful situation in that
 whole area They are perceived to be
 the threat to the peace by all the surrounding countries
 because Nicaragua is the base for supporting insurgencies
 not ooh in El Salvador but in Costa Rica, Guatemala and
 Honduras as well.
 Q While the United States may want to pressure the Sandi-
 nistas to end support for Marxist guerrillas elsewhere, is that
 really the goal of the contras in Nicaragua? Aren't they bent on
 overthrowinc the regime?
 A Those things are always mixed. They would like to
 unseat the regime. The question is: What is th'e U.S. govern-
 ment's purpose? After all in World War fl    were helping
 the Communists, the Royalists, the Caullists and everybody.
 They were all trying to get power. We didn't care about
 that, we just wanted to get help against the Nazis. It's an
 analogous situation we have here. Our own national inter-
 ests need not be strictly tied to any one group's goals.
 Q What chance do the contras have of overthrowing the
 Sandinista regime?
 A I think there's no chance that they will be able to
 overthrow the government In the resistance, you have, it is
 said, perhaps 15,000 men with rifles scattered around the
 open, unpopulated parts of the country, which is where
 guerrillas can hide. They can't go into the cities, which the
 government is protecting with tanks and 75,000 men in the
 Army, the militia and the security forces. So they're not
 going to overthrow that government
 It could be-but it's a very long shot and unlikely-that
 the government would dissolve because the people would
 get fed up and fall away from the regime. But it's hard to
 change a government that operates a system of control
 where everybody in every block is counted and any strang-
 ers who show have to explain themselves.
 Q What is your response to published reports that the CIA
 was involved in the mining of the Nicaraguan ports?
 A I can't comment on such allegations.
 Q What about reports that the CIA Is actively running this

 mining operation with a mother ship
 offshore?
 A I never comment on such reports,
 Q Are the Cubans still heavily in-
 volved in Nicaragua or have they reduced
 their presence there as some recent re-
 ports suggest?
 A While the Cubans have been
 talking about lowering their presence,
 they've actually been moving in more
 people. The Cubans run the security
 services that manage the block-popu-
 lation-control system.
 There are about 7,000 to 9,000 Cu-
 bans in Nicaragua including 3.000 to
 3,500 military advisers intertwined
 with the Nicaraguan military. They
 also have 5,000 to 6.000 teachers,
 construction and health workers who
 are regularly taken back to Cuba on
 rotation. The replacements now be-
 ing sent have had military training
 and are under 40.
 As we saw in Grenada, Cuban con-
 struction workers carry rifles as well
 as shovels. There have been occasions
 where these Cuban construction
 workers joined in the fighting in Nic-
 aragua when contras tangled with the
 Nicaraguan military.
 Cl Is there any evidence that Cuba or
 the Soviet Union Is'converting Nicaragua into a kind of strategic
 base along lines you've warned about in the past?
 A We were concerned about that because they were
 lengthening airfields in Nicaragua to make them long
 enough to handle supersonic planes. And we know, Nicara.
 guan fliers were going to Bulgaria, to the Soviet Union and
 Cuba to be trained- Now, that has continued. The training
 has been completed. We believe that MiC-23s are in Cuba
 earmarked for Nicaragua and that Nicaraguan pilots are
 practicing in them. We believe the planes haven't been
 sent over to Nicaragua, because they're concerned about
 our response.
 Q How many Nicaraguan pilots have been trained?
 A We don't have an exact figure, but it's substantial-
 something like 40 pilots, enough to handle a squadron of
 planes, which is what we think they have in Cuba.
 One thing you've got to understand is that both the
 Soviets and the Cubans go to great lengths to keep their
 military' support for Nicaragua quiet and ambiguous. The
 heavy Soviet weapons come largely in Bulgarian and Alge-
 rian ships. Soviet and Cuban ships bring. n the lighter stuff
 mixed with commercial cargo. We have intelligence that
 the Cubans in Nicaragua shave their mustaches and hide
 their dog tags. They are mixed in with Nicaraguan units,
 not kept in separate Cuban formations that could be
 identified..
 Q You mentioned that an objective of the contras was to
 divert the Sandinistas from their support of the Marxist guerrll-
 ias in Et Salvador. Are they having an, impact on the flow of
 supplies to the Salvadoran rebels?
 A Oh, they certainly have had an impact, though it's
 hard to ouantify. To start off with, the Nicaraguans have to
 use their weapons and ammunition to fight the contras
 instead of sending them to El Salvador to fight the govern-.
 ment. That's got to have an impact The supplies are.stili
 coming in from Nicaragua, but we think it's in reduced

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/29: CIA-RDP87M00539R002904800014-1
 amounts. We know -that the, Nicaraguan government and
 the Army are having to pay greater attention to dealing
 with the internal resistance, which means that there's
 much less attention they, can give to exporting revolution.
 But I can't be very much more specific than that.
 Q It Nicaragua is being forced to divert Its attention from El
 Salvador, why do the Marxist guerrillas In El Salvador seem to
 have been gaining In recent months?
 A Well, they might be doing better without that diver-
 sion. We do know that the Salvadoran guerrillas have been
 able to increase their numbers by training and. arming
 some of their support people. At the same time, we have
 pretty good reporting that they're short of ammunition and
 they're short of funds and they're not as effective as they
 would be if Nicaraguan support were unimpaired.
 Also, the Salvadoran Army has been getting more effec-
 tive. Before the period leading up to the elections, the
 Army had the guerrillas pretty well broken up and pushed
 back into their bases in mountainous areas.
 Q How do you reconcile your claim that the Salvadoran Army
 is getting better with the constant criticism that It's still too
 Incompetent to make headway against the guerrillas?
 A It has a lot of deficiencies but it is improving steadily
 through better training, better leadership, more-aggressive
 tactics and more-sustained operations. It needs more mobil-
 ity. It is not a perfect world, and there is still plenty of room
 for improvement. That can be said about any army.
 The main problem in El Salvador from the military stand-
 point is this: As a rule of thumb, experts say that an army
 needs an 8 or 10 to 1 advantage to win a guerrilla war. Look
 at the Nicaraguan Army and militia 75,000 men under
 arras---and they are unable to cope with 15,000 contras.
 Now the ratio of the Salvadoran Army to the guerrillas is
 something like 4 to 1, and the guerrillas have a safe haven, a
 supply and a command-and-control base right across the
 border in Nicaragua. Given that situation, the Salvadoran,
 Army is not doing badly.
 The only way you're going to resolve the conflict in El
 Salvador is if two things happen: You have to deprive the
 guerrillas of their safe haven and further reduce the flow of

 supplies and build up the Salvadoran Army by 25 percent
 to 40 percent to improve the ratio of Army to guerrillas.
 Q How do you handle the growing pressure In Congress to
 cut otl military aid to El Salvador if the death squads continue to
 operate there? Why Is the Salvadoran government unwniing or
 unable to deal with the death squads?
 A I think?it's a cultural problem. It's a violent society like
 most of the societies down there. Everybody talks about the
 right-wing death squads. During recent months, most of
 the assassination victins have been supporters of the Ro-
 berto D'Aubuisson mdvement, the so-called right wing. So
 there are left-wing death squads. The guerrillas practice
 intimidation, and the}' slaughter people as they did in Viet-
 nam. It's a civil war. And they also have this special kind of
 free-lance, nongovernmental death squad that practices re-
 venge. That works both ways right across the society.
 Besides that, the judicial system in El Salvador leaves
 much to be desired. They have a hard time getting any
 convictions. But basically what we're talking about is
 whether our primary purpose is to establish a better society
 in El Salvador, which isn't likely to happen quickly under
 present circumstances, or to protect the security interests
 of the United States and give Salvadoran democracy a
 chance to develop.
 Q Are you worried that Central America will become a major
 Issue In the political campaign and undermine popular support
 for the administration's strategy there?
 A I think that people in the long run are less concerned
 about reports of mining Nicaraguan harbors than they are
 about the danger of creating P. wave of immigration into
 this country if Central America or any part of it should fall
 under Soviet-Cuban domination. If we have another Cuba
 in Central America, Mexico will have a big problem and
 we're going to have a massive wave of immigration- The
 effort to prevent this from happening is not going to excite
 Americans as much as the threat they would face if things
 go wrong.
 Also, I think people are concerned about the military
 danger. If the Communists solidify their hold on Nicaragua,
 the other countries down there would have to accommo-
 date in some way. The Communists would next be looking
 at Mexico, to find problems that they specialize in exploit.
 ing. So what you're looking at for your children and your
 grandchildren is a long-term prospect of a hundred million
 hostile people immediately south of our border if we fail to
 give democracy a chance to develop in Central America.
 Q To turn to the other spot that worries Americana-the
 Middle East What is the likelihood of an Iranian victory In the
 war with Iraq?
 A The Iraqis should be able to stave off this current
 offensive because they have such a preponderance of air
 power and artillery and tank power. But the Iranians have
 the numbers; they have the staying power; they've got the
 economic resources. The Iraqis are in bad shape economi-
 cally. They've also got a big Shia population with religious
 ties to Iran. I think the prevailing opinion is that in the long
 run the Iranians have some important advantages.
 Q. What dangere might the United States face if Iran does
 win?
 A If Iran prevails and a radical Shiite regime is estab-
 lished in Baghdad similar to the Khomeini regime in Tehe-
 ran, there are a lot of people they could turn loose against
 Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the gulf states, which have sup-
 ported Iraq.
 The Iranians are in a vengeful frame of mind. We have
 seen what they can do with the terrorist attacks on the
 American Embassy in Kuwait and the Marine barracks in
 Beirut. They are taking people from those gulf states to
 camps in Teheran fox terrorist training and sending them

 back. So already they hpve a
 pretty potent subversive poten-
 tial in those small countries.
 Q What would the United States
 do if Iran moved against these oil
 states in the gulf region?
 A I can't speculate on that.
 The U.S. government said that
 we would keep the Strait of Hor-
 muz open. As to something hap-
 pening in one or another of these
 countries around the gulf, any re-
 action, I would suppose, would
 depend upon the circumstances
 at the time.
 Q That brings up the problem of
 state-sponsored terrorism that Sec-
 retary of State Shultz has been talk-
 ing about: What can the United
 States do to counter terrorism
 sponsored by Iran and other gov-
 ernments-assassinate their peo-
 pie, bomb their capitals or what?
 A Don't put words in my
 mouth. As Secretary Shultz said,
 we're dealing with a new phe-
 nomenon in state-sponsored ter-
 rorism--a new weapons system
 that obliterates the distinction
 between peace and war.
 Contras: "Perhaps 15,000 men with rifles scattered
 around the unpopulated parts of the country."
 The Iranians use their diplomatic facilities as a platform
 to make revolutionary guards, communications facilities
 and money available for terrorist planning and action.
 They've attacked us twice in Beirut-the American Embas-
 sy and the Marine barracks. They turn up in many coun-
 tries in Africa, Asia and Europe, and we are likely to see
 them here. They send their missionaries across the whole
 Moslem world, from Morocco to Malaysia and Indonesia,
 preaching Khomeini's brand of radical religious-social gos-
 pel. It's a force that we're going to have to reckon with in
 many dimensions.
 Q But what can you do about It? Do you get-into the business
 of assassinating terrorist leaders?

 measures
 -- coopera  on to deter and defeat terrorism.
 Let's look at the problem of state-sponsored terrorism'-
 and international terrorism in a little more detail. There
 are more than 50 major terrorist organizations, and hun-
 dreds of mom and pop shops-little groups that take on
 operations for hire. We can count scores of terrorist-train-
 ing camps in Iran, Libya, Syria, South Yemen, Bulgaria, the
 Soviet Union, Romania, Cuba and other bloc countries.
 Now, there are several things you can do to cope with
 this kind of terrorism. You can handle it by defending
 yourself, defending potential targets. That's pretty tough
 because you haven't got enough policemen to protect ev-
 ery target and you don't know where they're going to hit
 So we are engaged in helping security organizations in a
 great many countries to improve their training and opera-
 tional proficiency. These countries have their own intelli-
 gence capabilities to watch the terrorists. They're apt to be
 better at it than we are because they've got to live with
 them all the time and they're closer to them. A qualified
 antiterrorist network has developed through the liaison
 relationship between intelligence and security organiza-
 tions. It is being improved by intensified intelligence ex-
 changes and by training and other forms of assistance.
 On top of that, there's a question of deterring terrorism
 by sending the message that if
 the terrorists attack there will be
 retaliation. It's not necessarily a
 matter of striking back directly at
 the terrorists. The Israelis, for ex-
 ample, send the message: "If
 we're hit from your territory,
 that's your responsibility and
 we're going to kick you in the
 teeth somehow." I think you will
 see more of that-retaliation
 against facilities connected with
 the country sponsoring the ter-
 rorists or retaliation that just
 hurts the interests of countries
 which sponsor terrorism.
 Some people say that you've
 got to find out who the terrorists
 are and make sure you hit the
 people who hit you. Well, usually
 that means you're not going to do
 it at all. If retaliation is going to
 be a deterrent, the countries
 sponsoring terrorism have got to
 know it's going to happen quick-,
 1), and with certainty.
 Now, there's a third way to
 handle state-sponsored terrorism
 which, in my view, needs to be
 developed faster.
 Q What's that alternative way?
 A That's a kind of international, diplomatic counterof-
 fensive against international terrorism. In effect, it would
 apply a modern version of the 18th-century international
 law on piracy that charged every nation with responsibility
 for picking up pirates and putting them away where they
 could do no more harm. It's a little hard to get acceptance
 of that in today's world, and I'm not quite sure just how you
 would implement it.
 But nations could join together to invoke economic sanc-
 tions against and isolate diplomatically countries, such as
 Iran and Libya, that practice terrorism as a matter of state
 policy. They could collaborat
 i
 They could agree to respond more quickly and surely to
 requests from other countries for extradition and assistance.
 So there are three ways you can deal with state-spon-
 sored terrorism short of sending out hit squads. You can
 defend, you can retaliate and you can impose international
 barriers and sanctions of a nonviolent nature.
 Q If we can turn finally to the Soviet Union: What, as you see
 It, has been the effect of the change In leadership there from
 Andropov to Chernenko?
 A Minimal. Chernenko is clearly a transitional leader,
 but nobody knows whether he's going to be around six
 months, two years or five years, and it doesn't make much
 difference. We predicted that China's Mao Tse-tung would
 die 20 times before they finally buried him. So we are very
 shy about predicting how long Chernenko will last.
 My view is that under the Soviet system today everything
 is worked out in a collegial way. Certainly with this kind of
 short-term leader, no one man is going to have the power
 to make a drastic change of direction. And there's no reason
 to assume that when Chernenko goes, the situation will
 change. What you've got in the Soviet Union is a generation
 of septuagenarians who are reluctant to forfeit their perqui-
 sites by passing power. to a younger generation. They're
 intent on hanging on to power.                       0
