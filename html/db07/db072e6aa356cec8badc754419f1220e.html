PREFACE 
This classified annotated chronology was developed to assist U.S. government officials responsible 
for managing relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and government analysts of the Chinese 
political scene. It was prepared as part of a larger study of PRC political negotiating behavior.' The 
chronology summarizes the evolution of the "normalization" dialogue between the United States and the 
PRC between 1967 and 1979 and post-normalization negotiations between Washington and Beijing on the 
issue of American arms sales to Taiwan. The annotated summaries of the senior-level exchanges also 
document exchanges on international political and defense issues of concern to the two governments. 
NOTE ON CLASSIFICATION 
This report has been given the overall classification of SECRET per review and decision by the 
National Security Council Staff of September 24, 1985. 
� Much of the NSC-controlled original source material for this analysis, primarily negotiating records, 
was initially classified TOP SECRET. The decision to downgrade the classification of this study reflects a 
number of considerations: that such negotiating records, as controlled by the Department of State, are 
normally handled at the SECRET level of classification; that the sensitivity of the documents has declined 
somewhat with the passage of more than a decade; and that a study of these materials at the SECRET level 
would be more readily accessible�and therefore of greater value�to a broader mnge of the official 
community.

I. INTRODUCTION 
BACKGROUND: A STUDY OF CHINESE POLITICAL NEGOTIATING BEHAVIOR 
This annotated chronology of senior-level political exchanges between the United States and the 
people's Republic of China (PRC) was prepared as pan of a larger study of Chinese political negotiating 
behavior.' At the beginning of that study, the author constructed a brief, descriptive chronology of 
negotiating encounters to assist in reconstructing the record of official exchanges between senior Chinese 
and American political leaders, especially those encounters related to the normalization of U.S.-PRC 
relations between 1971 and 1978, and to negotiations with Chinese authorities over the issue of U.S. arms 
sales to Taiwan in 1981 and 1982. 
The working chronology turned out to be of sufficient value that the author was asked to prepare an 
elaborated version, including extensive summaries of the substantive issues discussed in each negotiating 
encounter and a review covering the period 1967 to 1984, the years in which the United States and the PRC 
gradually moved away from the hostility and confrontation of the 1950s and 1960s to establish diplomatic 
ties and to conduct the full range of normal state-to-state political, economic, and�in limited form�security 
relations. 
A CHRONOLOGICAL REFERENCE AND RUNNING HISTORY 
This classified chronology is designed to assist U.S. government analysts conccmcd with the Sino-
American relationship and "operational" officials responsible for formulating and implementing U.S. China 
policy and conducting negotiations with their counterparts from the PRC. It establishes a concise historical 
framework for the evolution of normal U.S.-PRC relations, highlighting the primary negotiating encounters 
between senior Chinese and American officials during this 17-year period and summarizing the key issues 
discussed and the major policy departures put forward by each side. This chronology is the only 
comprehensive survey of this negotiating record based on official documents that are now scattered among 
collections held by the White House, the National Security Council, the Departments of State and Defense, 
the libraries of Presidents Nixon. Ford, and Carter, and the Kissinger collection in the Library of Congress. 
SCOPE: A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF SENIOR-LEVEL POLITICAL 
EXCHANGES 
It is important to define the scope of the documentary assessment this chronology is based on: 
It is comprehensive, but not complete. The documents reviewed for the chronology represent 
something on the order of 95 percent of the official record of senior-level U.S.-PRC political 
negotiating encounters for the years covered. Some documentation has either been lost or is 
accessible only with great difficulty, but virtually all critical negotiating encounters have been 
located.

U.S.-PRC POISTICAL NEGOTIATIONS, 1967-1954 
Some especially sensitive exchanges, particularly those of a political name, were never recorded on 
paper. For example, a discussion between PRC Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping and President Carter and a 
few senior officials in Washington on January 29, 1979, which concerned China's intent to "teach a lesson' 
to Vietnam for its invasion of Cambodia, was never recorded. Also, Chinese and American officials would 
occasionally raise particularly sensitive matters while sightseeing, in dinner-table conversations, during car 
rides to or from airports, or in asides at the end of formal negotiating sessions. Most of the issues discussed 
in such off-the-record encounters, however, appear in subsequently recorded discussions. � 
h must also be emphasized that full control over this negotiating record is rendered almost impossible 
by the documentary control procedures of the U.S. government. Each relevant agency�primarily the White 
House, the National Security Council, and the Departments of State and Defense�has its own documentary 
control systems. The agencies normally do not exchange negotiating records, except perhaps on an informal 
or "bootleg" basis. There is no central repository of this negotiating record within the U.S. government. 
Moreover, within each agency there are various levels" of documentary control. For example, the 
Department of State's normal secret-level cables are given fairly wide internal circulation and extensive 
distribution in the field to relevant embassies and consulates, in contrast to the highly restricted "NODIS" 
(no distribution) channels at either secret or top-secret levels of classification. Similarly, the National 
Security Council has a "normal" system of documentary control, while particularly sensitive materials are 
handled in an "outside the system" accountability control process, or in a 'really outside the system" (i.e., 
totally unrecorded) manner. The White House, in addition, has a highly controlled "back channel" system 
of telegraphic communications with U.S. embassies abroad by which ambassadors can communicate 
directly with the President or his National Security Adviser in a highly restricted and secure manner. 
Further complicating the problem of access to the full documentary record is the fact that over time 
documentary collections are dissipated, destroyed, or removed to various governmental libraries or storage 
centers. As a result of the normal turnover of government officials and the limits of documentary storage 
space there is probably not much more than a three- to five-year Institutional memory' of official 
documents readily available to operational officials at any given time. And it has become fairly standard 
practice for an administration, in its waning hours, to remove its politically most sensitive documents to the 
retiring President's library or, as in the case of the Kissinger collection, to the Library of Congress, where 
the material is subject to controlled access. Finally, much documentation, including transcripts of telephone 
conversations, sensitive "back channel" telegraphic messages, or uncontrolled memeranda, are virtually 
beyond retrieval except through extraordinary effort and highly controlled usage. 
The author of this chronology gained authorized access to the record of U.S.-PRC political exchanges 
in part because of the support of senior officials of the Reagan administration, in part because of his prior 
exposure to most of this material as a staff member of the National Security Council during the years 1971-
1976 and subsequent work as a consultant to the NSC and the Departments of State and Defense, and 
because of the support of former senior officials who, in their formal roles in the decisionmaking and 
implementing process, created much of this negotiating record. 
The problems of gaining full documentary control have been partially compensated for by the growing 
corpus of memoirs prepared by former government officials, which draw upon their own records as well as 
their recollections of events in which they participated. This chronology draws upon a fairly extensive 
collection of such memoirs (set Appendix A), which have been used to check and supplement the formal 
documentary record. In addition, more than 30 detailed interviews were conducted with former senior 
officials involved in the development of Sino-American relations, both to check certain aspects of the 
formal record and to gain the officials' impressions of the manner in which Chinese officials manage the 
negotiating process�the primary concern of this project.

NTRODUCTION 3 
The chronology focuses on senior-level. Executive Branch political negotiating encounters with 
PRC counterpart officials. It docs not include internal U.S. government policy deliberations; it 
is largely a record of the face-to-face negotiating exchanges between Chinese and American 
officials in which the policy positions of each side were formally communicated to the other. 
This record is thus based largely on the English-language memoranda of conversations, the 
-memcons" which are the formal and official record of negotiating encounters.2 (It should be noted that 
such records, while generally accurate, are not always precise verbatim transcripts; and on rare occasions, 
they have been altered prior to distribution in governmental channels because of some special policy or 
operational sensitivity.) 
The chronology is largely a record of senior-level negotiations by Presidents, Secretaries of State, 
National Security Advisers, and Assistant Secretaries or Ambassadors acting on behalf of their principals. It 
contains few references to exchanges between senior Chinese officials and Congressional delegations, 
except where such encounters contain especially important political "signals." And there are limited 
inclusions of press statements by American or Chinese leaders where such public material was clearly used 
by the officials concerned as part of the negotiating process. 
The chronology does not include detailed assessments of negotiating encounters by Cabinet-level 
officials (such as the Secretaries of the Treasury or Commerce) or other senior negotiators in which the 
subjects under discussion are not relevant to the political normalization of U.S.-PRC relations, management 
of the Taiwan issue, or Sino-American exchanges on international political and security issues. Similarly, 
the Chronology does not include much of the increasingly voluminous "middle-lever communication 
between Chinese and American officials, which is largely relevant to the process of implementing policies 
set by their superiors, except in instances where such communications shed light on Chinese negotiating 
practices. 
PHASES IN THE EVOLUTION OF US.-PRC RELATIONS 
The text below puts the period covered (1967-1984) in a broader historical context of Sino-American 
relations and describes briefly the periods, or phases of the U.S.-PRC political dialogue. There are distinct 
differences in the political character of these periods, as well as variations in the style of the negotiating 
process and the channels of communication involved. 
In broadest terms, the U.S. government's dealings with the Chinese Communist movement�which 
after 1949 was institutionalized as the government of the People's Republic of China--fall into four distinct 
phases. The first covers the "pre-liberation" years, especially the 1930s and 1940s, when official contact 
was established through the U.S. Army's "Dixie Mission" to the Communist capital of Yanan during World 
War II, the Chinese Communist Party mission in the Nationalist Chinese government's wartime capital of 
Chungking (Chongqing), and after the defeat of Japan in 1945, via a range of contacts with the soon-to-be-
victorious Communist authorities during the Civil War period (particularly the mission of General George 
C. Marshall to mediate the Communist-Nationalist civil war). 
The second phase is the two-decade period of adversarial confrontation from the founding of the PRC 
in 1949 through the Korean War years, the military confrontation over Taiwan, and the Vietnam War 
The Chinese counterpart officials in this negotiating relationship keep their own verbatim records of these same exchanges�but oi 
course in the Chinese language. Except in rare insunccs. no effort has been made to verify that the English-language transcript of a 
negotiating encounter (which is a record of the English-language presentation by the US. official and a translation into English of the 
,Chinese-language presentation by a PRC official) is the same as the Chinese-language record held by the PRC.

period. During this time. U.S.-PRC official contact was maintained primarily through ambassadorial-1m 
exchanges at Geneva and Warsaw. 
The third phase is the period of efforts by senior leaders in Washington and Beijing (Peking)3 
initiate and conduct a process of normalizing the Sino-American relationship covering the years 1967 (whi 
presidential candidate Richard Nixon published an article in Foreign Affairs calling on the United States 
"come urgently to grips" with the problem of the U.S.-PRC confrontation) through 1978, when Sin 
American diplomatic relations were finally established. 
The fourth phase of Sino-American relations begins with formal recognition and the establishment 
diplomatic relations on January 1, 1979, and continues to the present day. 
This chronology covers the last two of these phases in the U.S.-PRC relationship. It should also I 
noted that within the years 1967 to 1984 there are several distinct periods of official COMMUiliCatiC 
between Washington and Beijing. From 1967 through mid-July 1971 communication was largely indirec 
either through unilateral public statements and gestures (e.g. the Nixon article noted earlier, or Chairmn 
Mao's reception in 1970 of American Edgar Snow atop Tien An Men on October 1, the PRC national dc 
celebration) or the exchange of messages through intermediary governments, primarily the Romanian an 
Pakistani. This period also covers the last two of the "Warsaw Talk" ambassadorial-level exchanges, i 
which the United States and the PRC each proposed the establishment of a direct, senior-level, secur 
dialogue in either Beijing or Washington. 
The next period begins with National Security Adviser Henry A. Kissinger's historic secret trip u 
Beijing for three days of direct talks with PRC Premier Dou Enlai in early July 1971 and runs up to thi 
establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. Communications in this period were most visibly conducted 
during eight more trips to the Chinese capital by Kissinger in his roles as the President's National Security 
Adviser and, after September 1973, as Secretary of State, and by trips to the PRC by Presidents Nixon (in 
1972) and Ford (in 1975). 
There were, in addition, several important overt and coven supporting channels of communication 
during these years which carried the bulk of political communications recorded in this chronology: 
publicly acknowledged channel of contact through the U.S. and Chinese embassies in Paris; a secret "Path 
channel" established in July 1971, involving special Presidential envoy General Vernon A. Walters (ant. 
occasionally Kissinger) and PRC Ambassador to France Huang Zhen; another secret channel established ir 
New York City in October 1971, when the PRC was first admitted to the United Nations, which involvec 
encounters between National Security Adviser Kissinger and China's then-Permanent Representative to the 
UN.. Ambassador Huang Hua. This channel was usid until China established a liaison office in 
Washington in May 1973 (the United States established an equivalent liaison office in Beijing at about the 
same time). 
Between the spring of 1973 and March 1979, when the two liaison offices were converted into 
,embassies, the bulk of Sino-American political exchanges were conducted in Washington between Liaison 
Office Chief Huang Zhen and Kissinger, or during Kissinger's periodic trips to the Chinese capital. During 
the Carter administration, Huang Zhen and later his successor Ambassador Chai Zemin continued to be 
primary points of contact with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and National Security Adviser Zbigniew 
Brzezinski. The chief of the US. Liaison Office in Beijing, Leonard Woodcock, played a key role in 
negotiating the full normalization of U.S.-PRC relations in the second half of 1978. 
With the conversion of liaison offices to embassies in the spring of 1979, the Sino-American political 
dialogue became increasingly institutionalized ("normal"), with the Department of State playing the

predominant role in communications between the two governments. While periodic leadership visits at the 
Presidential or Cabinet level have continued to be an important aspect of the Sino-American political 
dialogue, the negotiating process has tended to become increasingly routinized at the ambassadorial level. 
This was particularly the case with the 1981-1982 negotiation on American arms sales to Taiwan. 
It is important to be aware of this evolving institutional pattern of U.S.-PRC communications brellicr 
of the shifting bureaucratic locus of exchanges between the two governments. 
USE OF THIS CHRONOLOGY 
This annotated chronology has been designed to be as simple and straightforward as possible, but a 
few explanatory comments on the categories used (the date of an encounter, the senior officials involved, 
and a summary of and/or comments on the subjects discussed) will be helpful. 
Date. The date of a particular meeting (and the time it was recorded in the source document) 
represent the actual encounter at the locale where it occurred. The recording or reporting date of a particular 
exchange, upon occasion, may be somewhat later than the meeting itself, but the documentary record almost 
always identifies the time and date of the meeting. 
In certain negotiating situations, the time difference between Washington and Beijing4 is important to 
understanding the evolution of a negotiation. This is particularly so in the negotiations of December 1978, 
when the United States initiated a rapid, last-minute exchange of communications between the two 
leaderships to make certain that the Chinese government understood the American position on post-
normalization arms sales to Taiwan. 
The relative times of negotiating exchanges being conducted via cable between Washington and 
Beijing can be accurately identified by using the "Zulu" or Greenwich Mean Time notation in the date-time 
group record in a particular cable. 
Senior Officials. For brevity, and to minimize repetition, only last names or surnames are used to 
identify the senior spokesmen involved in an encounter. Other officials are usually in the room during a 
negotiating session, but their names are not noted except where these individuals actively speak in a 
particular meeting. Full names and tides are noted only the first time an individual is identified in that 
particular role. Thus, Kissinger is identified on October 10, 1969, as Presidential National Security Adviser, 
and subsequently is referred to simply as Kissinger, except for the entry of September 26, 1973, which is his 
first negotiating encounter in the role of Secretary of State. Appendix B contains a listing of the full names 
of the primary Chinese and American officials cited in this chronology. 
Although Chinese names are rendered throughout the chronology in pin-yin form, the original 
documentary record now held by the U.S. government uses the Wade-Giles system of Roman ization for pre-
1979 memoranda of conversation and cables. Thus, Zhou Enlai is rendered as Chou En-lai in pre-1979 
source documents. The Wade-Giles equivalents of Chinese officials' names are given in parentheses in 
Appendix B. 
Where there could be some confusion or lack of specificity in the use of a Chinese surname, the full 
name is given, e.g� Huang Hua and Huang Then are both used in full. 
Locale. The locale of an exchange is usually identified implicitly as the "home office" of the first 
official mentioned under the "Senior Officials" heading. Thus, for example, in an entry for October 20. 
4 getjing is 13 hours "ahead" of Washington during the months of Standard Time in the United States. and 12 hours ahead when the 
United States is on Daylight Saving Time.

locale�) at the given hour and date in local time. When meetings occurred in a city other than Beiji 
Washington, that city is explicitly identified. 
Summary and/or Comments. The documentary record summarized in this chronology co 
largely of verbatim transcripts of negotiating encounters, identified only by the date and time o 
encounter and the participants involved. As the process of Sino-American communication be 
institutionalized and politically less sensitive, particularly during and after the Carter administrz 
memoranda of conversation or instructions and reports on negotiating exchanges were communicate, 
official cables, with their elaborate system of time notations identifying the hour of transmission and re 
of the message and document control numbers. Such notations are not usually necessary for the retriev 
a document, however; the date, participants, and subject are sufficient in most cases.5 
The documentary record summarized here is voluminous; these brief summaries are ince: 
primarily to provide a sense of the topics discussed in a particular negotiating session and major ix 
positions (and changes in position) put forward by the Chinese side�especially as they relate to i 
negotiating positions on political normalization with the United States, American arms sales to Taiwan, 
international political and security issues. These summaries should not be assumed to be comprehem 
however. Some sessions in which exceptional important initial presentations were made of Chinese pc 
positions, or changes in established positions, are summarized in detail. Subsequent sessions that re; 
established policies with little change are summarized in less detail. 
Where the author has judged that a particular session is noteworthy for some reason of stylt 
substance, comments are enclosed in brackets to indicate that they are interpretive judgments. 
$ Cable numbers were recorded in notes taken for the preparation of this chronology; and sources other than =means or cable

FRN wants him to visit Beijing with Ambassador I  David Bruce in another presummit planning session. Cr If 
Chinese say many U.S. political figures now want to 
visit PRC; refusing them is difficult in wake of HAKi 
p 
FWahers informs KZ of Dobrynin call on HAK �1 
regarding his Beijing visit. Soviets ask if RN is 
prepared to visit Moscow rusg HA1C says no. )4 
Regarding U.S. politicians visiting China, there is 
need to keep first U.S.-PRC exchanges free of 
partisanship so as not to inhibit President's freedom of 
Laction. 
rChinese agree to October interim visit, but refuse �1 
inclusion of David Bruce "for understandable le�asons" 
[i.e., Vietnam]. HAftelpresses concern over Taiwan 
and U.S. 'right wing" attacks on his China visit; Cr 
requests the Chinese keep their distance from .1 
LAmericantleft" groups. 
Zhou: U.S. China policy is changing. Negotiations 
with Nixon must lead to withdrawal of U.S. forces 
from Taiwan and Taiwan Strait. Not all U.S.-PRC 
problems can be solved at one stroke. Japan covets 
Taiwan. China will not go into U.N. if status of 
Taiwan 'undetermined.* Danger of Japanese 
militarism. Settlement of Vietnam war most urgent. 
Soviet buildup a threat to China. U.S. forces should 
withdraw from Korea. 
FHAK: A Soviet proposal for agreement on preventing 
nuclear war is directed at China. US. rejects the 
proposal, but is prcparcd to sign similar agTeemcnt irt 
with PRC. RN will no: meet with Soviet leaders 
before Chinese. Indo-Pakistani conflict. Planning for 
LRN visit to China.
