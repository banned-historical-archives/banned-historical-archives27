 The Ford Trio
 Chinese diplomats abroad and other officials
 with access to thinking in Peking have depicted
 President Ford's trip to China in positive, almost
 glowing terms.
 Clearly under instructions from Peking, these
 well-informed officials have told US di lomats
 --Peking is satisfied with Sino-US
 relations and that the Shanghai com-
 munique remains the framework for
 more substantial improvement in
 relations in the future;
 --Peking and Washington hold common
 views regarding many international
 issues, particularly with respect to
 "hegemony," and this could result
 in a common approach to other
 problems;
 --the visit strengthened Washington's
 hand in future dealings with Moscow.

 agree on any significant matters.
 Peking has taken the line that the talks on
 international issues
 constituted the
 mos  uagor an  par  o   e  or  visit.  "Hegemony"
 to the Chinese obviously means opposition to an ex-
 pansion of Soviet influence, and Mice Premier Teng
 H-ciao-ping indicated at a farewell lunch for Ambassador
 Bush in Peking on December 6 that the visit produced
 results "greater than we expected..

 Nixon Doctrine meant a limited US withdrawal from

 Moscow.
 Peking's apparent view that the visit produced
 a clearer definition of mutual Sino-US interests
 whose object is the containment of Soviet influence
 is reflected in Chinese treatment of the detente
 issue.  Whereas major Chinese public statements dur-
 ing the visit by Secretary Kissinger in November con-

 statements during President Ford's visit were more
 specifically anti-Soviet, virtually brushing aside

 Another Death in the Part ?s Famil
 The death of party vice-chairman Kang Sheng on
 December 16 should have little effect on Chinese
 policy-making.  Kang had been inactive for several
 years, although he appeared at the party congress
 in 1973, at National Day ceremonies in 1974, and at
 the National People's Congress this year.  Rang was
 rumored to be ill at least since 1971, and he was
 in a wheelchair for the National Day celebrations
 in 1974.  He was aligned with the party's left wing
 and reputedly recruited Chiang Ching into the party
 in the 1934s.  Although his supposed illness may not
 have prevented him entirely from advocating leftist
 causes in higher party councils, the actual extent
 of his influence in recent years is impossible to
 determine.
 The memorial service held for Kang on December
 21 brought out all active Peking-based Politburo
 members.  The namelist, given in order of party
 rank, revealed no changes.  Chiang Ching, far
 example, desgite the many setbacks she has suffered
 this year, remains the highest ranking member of
 the Politburo, following the elite Standing Committee.
 Another highlight of the service was the reagpearance
 of young party vice-chairman Wang Hung-wen, who pre-
 sided over the ceremony.  Wang's appearance was his
 first in Peking since last May and was virtually
 mandatory under the circumstances.  He reputedly had
 returned to Shanghai earlier this year for further
 "seasoning" as a result of his less than glowing
 performance as a member of the hierarchy in Peking.
 Party vice-chairman Yeh Chien-ying, who himself
 has been ailing, delivered a rather warm eulogy,
 claiming that Kang was "beloved by the people of the
 whole country."  Kang, whose career was spent mainly
 in security and internal intelligence work, was in

 fact probably more feared than loved, and his
 role in support of party leftists during the Cultural
 Revolution undoubtedly did not endear him to the
 moderates.
 Mao, the ailing Chou En-lai, and 90-year-old
 Chu Te, who has made several public appearances
 despite his age, did not attend the ceremony but
 did send wreaths.  The same was true of aging
 Politburo member Liu Po-cheng.
 There are signs that the party's most prominent
 intellectual, the octogenarian Kuo Mo-jo, is ill.
 Kuo has not appeared publicly since October.  He
 sent a wreath to the Kang Sheng ceremony and has
 missed several events hosted by the Chinese Academy
 of Sciences, of which he is president.  On some
 occasions, these events have been held in Kuo's
 name, a formulation used for Premier Chou En-lai.
 Whether or not Kong's death means that the
 left has lost yet another voice, it does point up'
 the age of the current leadership.  At 77, Kang
 was the same age as Chou En-lai and Yeh Chien-ying,
 both of whom are ailing to some degree, and was
 younger than Mao, Chu Te, and Liu Po-cheng.  Earlier
 this year, Politburo member and co-founder of the
 party Tung Pi-wu died at the age of 90.  Despite
 remarkable longevity, the old  ward is slowly
 passing from the scene.

 Peking has added 21 new routes and 58 new flights
 per week to domestic air operations since April, bring-
 ing total  routes  to  115 and total flights  to  344.          Air-
 ports and aircraft inventories are also being expanded.
 International air operations are plagued by law
 traffic demand and continuing losses on existing routes,
 although China continues to seek new international air
 agreements.  China now offers flights to only 10 for-
 eign countries and is served by 10 foreign airlines.
 Peking has reciprocal air agreements with more than 30
 countries, however.  The most recent agreements were
 signed this fall with Finland and West Germany.  The
 surge of new foreign flights to China that occurred in
 the last few years has stopped, probably reflecting
 high fuel prices, Peking's stringent visa policy, and
 the general economic slump.
 Chinese aircraft inventories continue to grow
 despite serious under-utilization of the recently
 added 10 Boeing 707s and 8 British Tridents.  Origi-
 nally bought to augment the 5 Soviet ZL-62s on inter-
 national routes, several of these medium and long
 range aircraft are being flown on domestic fli hts
 alon  with 31 Soviet AN-24s and 45 IL-14s.

 China and India:  Dialogue of the Deaf
 In the last few months, India has taken the in-
 itiative in the long inconclusive dialogue with Pe-
 king designed to lead to the normalization of rela-
 tions.  This is a turnabout from the exchanges of
 last year and early this year, when the Chinese took
 the lead.  The results, however, have been no dif-
 ferent--there has been no real progress.  Indeed,
 Peking appears distinctly uninterested in resuming
 discussions for the time being, although the Chinese
 have been careful not to close the door on negotia-
 tions at same future time.
 According to the Indian Foreign Secretary, the
 Indian feelers were initiated in August.  The foreign
 secretary said that he called in the Chinese charge
 in New Delhi and favorably reviewed past Chinese
 statements relating to normalization.  The Indian
 observed that the two countries should try and build
 on this and asked the charge how this might be ac-
 complished.  The foreign secretary said that he got
 no substantive reply.
 Although this is our first knowledge of the al-
 leged Indian demarche, it is consistent with a pattern
 of Indian. intentions toward China since September,
 when a movement to prepare Indian public opinion fog
 some type of movement in Sino-Indian relations may
 have begun.

 an  i went p   is in October in an inter-
 view wi   he central news service, saying India's
 policy toward China was to improve relations even
 though there were differences between the two coun-
 tries, but the Chinese had not responded to Indian
 efforts.  Gandhi made those remarks shortly after a
 border clash in which four Indian soldiers were
 killed.  Both sides played down the incident, and it
 does not seem to have altered the state of relations.
 The Indian position has not been as unambiguous
 as their diplomats would make it seem. Gandhi, for
 example, coupled her overtures to Peking with some
 stiff language.  In an interview with the London Sun-
 da~ Telegraph that was broadcast by New Delhi domes-
 tic radio on October 12, she accused Peking of in-
 stigating Indians along the border to make trouble,
 supplying them with arms and books, and trainin
 guerrillas.
 Individually, New Delhi's feelers may have seemed
 lukewarm to Peking.  But taken in toto, the signals
 were clear enough, and it was Peking that was uninter-
 ested in picking up the thread.  The Chinese may have

 calculated that Gandhi is not serious, given Delhi's
 continued ties with Moscow and what the Chinese saw
 as deliberate stalling in the face of unmistakable
 Chinese overtures in early 1975.  Peking might also
 believe that a Chinese-Indian dialogue would have a
 negative impact on the hard pressed regime in Bangla-
 desh.  If this is Peking's concern, it presumably
 will defer a response to New Delhi until Dacca in-
 creases its internal control and the danger of In-
 dian intervention further recedes.
 There is another possible factor in China's cur-
 rent disinterest--the contempt that China's current
 de facto premier holds for India.  In an early Decem-
 ber conversation with the departing USLO chief, rank-
 ing vice-premier Teng Hsiao-ping dismissed India as
 a country where "cows are more important than state
 sovereignty."  while it is in Peking's long term in-
 terest to normalize relations with New Delhi, Teng

 Recent PRC Claims  for Cha.na's
 Foreian Trade
 Estimates of the value of Chinese trade based
 on recently available official statistics compare
 favorably with CIA estimates based on trading part-
 ner data.
 Although Peking has not published data on the
 value of China's foreign trade since 1959, for the
 past three years it has released fragmentarg sta=
 tistics on the percentage increases in China's for-
 eign trade.
 Dollar values estimated from the sporadic Chi-
 nese statements and from trading partner statistics

 The CIA estimates based on trading partner statistics
 are lower than those derived from official Chinese

 as to difficulties in making estimates from trading
 partner data.  Actual Chinese procedures for record-
 ing trade may differ from ours, for example, with
 respect to the accounting currency and the treatment
 of aid goods and freight and insurance charges,
 Some of the discrepancies in the valuation of
 trade undoubtedly stem from differing exchange rates
 used to convert trade into a common currency.  In
 1959 China reported total trade in 1952 as 6,460 mil-
 lion yuan, of which trade with Communist countries
 accounted for 5,252 million yuan,.  If the Chinese
 indexes are based on yuan values, the Chinese must
 have since scaled down the yuan value assigned to
 trade with the Communist countries for 1952.  Other-
 wise the recent Chinese statement in Chung Kuo Tui
 Wa% Mao I, that trade in 1974 was 7.5 times the level
 of trade in 19.52, would mean 1974 trade amounted to
 48,450 million yuan (apgroximately US $24 billion
 at current exchange rates}, a total. which is patently
 absurd.  On the other hand, if China computes the in-
 dex in US dollars, small differences in the exchange
 rates used to convert Chinese trade to US dollars
 could account for a large gart of the differences
 between the dollar estimates.  For example, if the
 actual dollar value of trade in 1952 were $1,857 mil-
 lion, the estimate derived from the official state-
 ment for 1974 would be $14,005 million, the same as
 the estimate based on trading partner statistics.
 Floating exchange rates have complicated the making
 of US dollar estimates from trade partner statistics
 since 1971.
 Some of the discrepancies result from errors in
 estimating Chinese trade with trade partners that do
 not publish complete statistics.  The CIA estimates
 of China's trade with Albania, the Asian Communist
 countries, and many developing countries are based
 on fragmentary information from trade agreements and
 other indicators.  Pitfalls abound in placing dollar
 values on these items.

 Several other factors may also help explain
 the differences between the CIA estimates and the
 figures derived from the Chinese claims.
 --Adjusting trade partner data to a Chinese
 exports  f.o.b. and imports c.i.f. basis
 involves  the use of flat percentage rates
 based on distance, which may not reflect
 actual shipping and insurance costs.
 --Shipping leads and lags are ignored in the
 use of trading partner data.

 countries through Hong Kong may not be

 Grain Output
 The Chinese have released a new figure for grain
 output in 1974 that is far larger than output claimed
 for any previous year--because soybean production
 has been included.
 For each year from 1970 through 1973, the Chi-
 nese announced an absolute figure for the output of
 grain, which included rice, wheat, coarse grains,
 and potatoes.  In 1974 the Chinese reported only that
 output for that. year was 2.4 times that of 1949..
 Tha derived output figure based on this increase would
 be 250 million tons.  CIA, however, believes that
 this total is a bit high.  Weather in 1974 was generally
 unfavorable, and output was probably closer to 255
 million tons.
 The new total for 1974 (announced at a UN FAO
 conference in Rome in mid-November by the vice-minister
 of agriculture and forestry, Yang Li-kung} is 274.9
 million tons.  Minister Yang also repeated the claim
 that 1974 output was 2.4 times that of 1949, and the
 coupling of this increase with an absolute figure
 makes it clear that the 1974 official output figure
 (2.428 times the 1949 grain and soybean output} in-
 cludes soybeans--and is consistent with our esti-
 mates.

 The radical changes in education introduced five
 years ago as a result of the Cultural Revolution are
 again being defended, but chances are still good that
 they will undergo some, if not considerable, modifica-
 tion over the next year or so.  Since the first of the
 month, Red Flag, People's Da~Zy and the provincial
 media have all carried adamant defenses of the Cul-
 tural Revolution reforms while attacking advocates of
 the more traditional approach to education.  Red Flag's
 verbal assault on "bad elements in education circles"
 is almost certainly aimed at Minister of Education
 Chou Jung-hsin, a leading advocate of a return to the
 more conventional, pre-Cultural Revolution practices
 in the schools.
 The current 'debate, which seems to have been
 going on below the surface for several months, may
 have been forced into the open by several speeches
 Chou made in September and October.  In his October
 speech, Chou criticized the reforms of the Cultural
 Revolution and claimed that there had been an over-
 emphasis on practical application at the expense of
 theoretical training.  He also deprecated a model cur-
 riculum that the radical faction was then promoting.
 Chows speech was circulated as a centrally-originated
 document, indicating that his views commanded consid-
 erable support at the upper levels 4f the regime.~~      25X1

 On the question
 i lions,   a   airman a so appears to have sided
 with Chou Sung-hsin.  Last year Mao recommended that
 high school graduates should go directly to the uni-
 versities without first doing a stint on a farm or
 in a factory.
 It is probable that Mao has not given wholesale
 endorsement to the moderate position however.  Having
 fathered many of the radical educational reforms him-
 self, he may well have a problem in backing away too
 fast and too unequivocally.  The leftists seem to be
 aware of the Chairmants vulnerahility and have made
 liberal use of his quotations from an earlier period
 when he was more radical on this issue.
 In any case, Moots tilt toward the moderates has
 undoubtedly left the radical faction, led by Chiang
 Ch'ing, further isolated.  This latest blow comes on
 the heels of leftist setbacks in the cultural realm--
 also at the hand of Mao--and a steady decline in re-
 cent months of Chiang Ching's political stature.  In
 all probability, it was this erosion of radical clout
 that emboldened moderate elements to step up their
 criticism of the educational system, the last remain-
 ing edifice to the Cultural Revolution.  Likewise, the
 leftists probably realized that if their educational
 reforms were overturned, they would be left with little
 defense for the high cost of the Cultural Revolution.
 It may have been this sense of the high stakes that
 led the radicals to seek support in the public do-

 Even before the initial salvo was fired on De-
 cember 4 with the broadcast of the lead article in
 Red Flag, the leftists had apparently appealed to
 students at Tsinghua and Peking universities.  These
 two institutions have traditionally been centers of
 palitical_activism as well as models that other
 schools in the country watch closely for signs of
 new educational trends.  Peking University, moreover,
 was specifically criticized in the speeches of Chou
 Jung-hsin.  There are signs that since September
 there has been considerable activity--all of it
 peaceful--at these campuses an behalf of the Cultural
 Revolution reforms.  It is not surprising that the
 students, most of whom are from working class back-
 grounds and are the direct beneficiaries of the re-
 forms, would be quite sympathetic to the leftists,
 who undoubtedly were well aware of this reservoir
 of support.  It is no accident that the December 4
 Red Flag article was written by persons from Peking
 and Tsinghua universities.
 There are a number of other hints that the left-
 ists feel themselves on the defensive in this politi-
 cal contest.  The detailed, point-by-point refutation
 of the moderate position, characteristic of the De-
 cember 4 Red Flag article and much of the subsequent
 media play, reflects this defensiveness.  In particu-
 lar, the articles go to unusual lengths to refute the
 notion that the current educational system is turning
 out graduates who lack professionalism.  They cite
 numerous examples of student contributions to eco-
 nomic progress, emphasizing scientific achievements.
 A few articles plainly admit that there are "defects,"
 but hasten to add that any new system requires time
 to prove itself and that the educational reforms
 brought about by the Cultural Revolution are no
 exception.
 Finally, the leftists have displayed a certain
 amount of caution in trying to pin labels on their

 opposition.  Unlike numerous political battles in
 the past, the mudslinging seems muted.  The opposi-
 tion is portrayed as misguided, but the insinuation
 that it is in some way anti-socialist is for the
 most Bart avoided,
 At the same time, in an attempt to sustain their
 reforms] the leftists have not hesitated to play on
 the insecurities of the large number of cadres in the
 universities who were purged during the Cultural Rev-
 olution and later returned to positions of influence.
 An important Red FZag article broadcast on December
 11 singles out these cadres and admonishes them to
 pay attention to seeing things from a proletarian
 outlook.
 The parameters of this educational debate are
 familiar, and the issues have been bandied about from
 time to time within the leadership during the past
 few years.  The last major outbreak of polemics on
 the education issue occurred in the spring of 1973,
 when university entrance examinations were briefly
 made a primary criterion for admission.  A counter-
 attack that summer forced the moderates to retreat
 on this issue.
 The outcome of the current round is likely to
 be quite different.  Unlike 1973, the moderates today
 are far stronger, while the political stack of the
 left has precipitously declined during the past year
 and a half,  There can be little doubt, judging from
 the ambitious economic goals set by the coalition of
 moderates around Vice-Premier Teng Eisiao-ping, that
 economic growth is their chief and overriding concern.
 An educational system that places a priority on
 quality and relies more heavily on graven methods
 probably has a great deal of appeal to these men--
 and provides the additional political dividend of
 further circumscribing the left.  Finally, and per-
 haps  of  decisive  importance,  unlike  1973  Chairman  l~iao
 has added his own political weight to the moderate
 side.  All. of these factors suggest that the left is
 at best fighting a rear-guard action.
