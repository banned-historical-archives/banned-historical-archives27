 COMRADE MAO ZEDONG'S FIVE LETTERS TO RELATIVES AND FRIENDS (MAY 1950-
 JUNE 1957)
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16,.16 Aug 82 pp 2-4
 [Text] Comrade Mao Zedong's five letters to his relatives and friends
 (written between May 1950 and June 1957).
 Letter to Mao Yiminl (dated 8 May 1950):
 Comrade Yimin:  Your 3 January letter has been received.  Thank you for your
 kindness and for telling me in detail about the situation in our home
 village.  The poor people in the village live a hard life and the families
 of revolutionary martyrs live an even harder life.   They must bear it at
 this time.  After the land reform, things will improve somewhat.  Then, the
 people's government will be able to give some aid to the people, such as
 providing loans for them.  By that time the people will be able to grad-
 ually improve their livelihood.
 Care for the families of revolutionary martyrs is a nationwide concern.
 There are millions of families of revolutionary martyrs throughout the
 country.   Of course, it is inconvenient for the government to give special
 care to the families of revolutionary martyrs in only a few localities.
 However, the local government should give consideration to the people with
 the greatest difficulties when reducing rent on land and carrying out land
 reform and when the new crop is still in the blade and the old one has been
 consumed.
 It is very good that you work in the home village.   Thus, you can write to
 me often and tell me about the situation there.
 Please give my best regards to the comrades in the village.   I hope they
 will work hard and progress.
 This is my reply to your letter.   I wish you good health.

 Letter to.Wen Nansong (dated 12 May 1950):
 Cousin Nansong:  Your letter has been received.   Thank you for your kind-
 ness.                     Brother Yunchang2 wrote me several letters and I sent him a reply
 which was mailed to the address in Baibangkou, Nanxian County.  I do not
 know if he has received the letter.  It is improper for me to recommend
 brother Yunchang for a job.  He should acquit himself well among the people
 to win their trust.   Then, he will have an opportunity to participate in
 work. Are our 10th and 17th elder brothers still alive?  I am greatly
 relieved to learn that our 11th elder brother is still alive and healthy.
 He has written to me and I have sent him a letter in reply.  I do not know
 if he has received the letter.   In your letter you said that there was a
 food shortage in the village, but the government refused to provide food
 grain. How are things now?  Is there still a food shortage?  Has the
 government done anything about it?  Please write to me and tell me in
 detail about the situation.
 This is my reply to your letter.   I wish you well.
 Mao Zedong, 12 May 1950
 Letter to Li Shuqing3 (dated 16 October 1952):
 Mr Shuqing:  Your letter has been received.   I am delighted that you told
 me about the situation in the home village.   I am willing to collect infor-
 mation on local matters for reference only; I am unwilling to directly
 handle general local matters and should not do so.  Otherwise, it would be
 inconvenient for local party and government organizations to handle
 matters.   I hope you will excuse me.   I avail myself of this opportunity
 to extend my respects to you.
 Mao Zedong, 16 October 1952
 Letter to the Shicheng village party branch and government (dated 29 April
 1954):
 Comrades of the Shicheng village party branch and government:  Comrade Mao
 Yueqiu4 brought me your report when he came to Beijing.  Many thanks.
 The Wen family of Tangjiatuo are my relatives.   In the past several years,
 they visited me often in Beijing.   Since their return to Tangjiatuo, some
 of them have become arrogant and not very cooperative with the government.
 This is wrong.   Any member of the Wen family, like others in the village,
 should obey the leadership of the party and the government, farm diligently,
 and abide by the law and should not be treated differently.  Please do not
 hesitate to subject them to discipline just because they are my relations.
 My attitude is:
 1.   I love them because they are working people and my relatives.

 2.   Because I love them, I hope they progress, farm diligently, abide by the
 law and participate in the mutual aid cooperative organization like everyone
 else.   They should not enjoy any special privileges.  They should.be criti-
 cized if they show backward behavior.  Do not hesitate to criticize their
 shortcomings and mistakes just because they are my relatives.
 Enclosed is a letter from Comrade Wen Bingzhang5 for your perusal.   I agree
 with Comrade Wen Bingzhang.  Please handle what he mentioned.  Also, please
 let those in Tangjiatuo read my letter and Wen Bingzhang's letter, and help
 them correct their shortcomings and mistakes.   I believe that as long as
 you and I assume a correct attitude and as.long as they do not stubbornly
 adhere to their opinions, they can correct their shortcomings and mistakes
 and progress.
 With comradely regards,
 Mao Zedong, 29 April 1954
 Letter to Sun Peijun6 (dated 8 June 1957):
 Comrade Peijun:  Your 16 May letter was received.   I am glad. that you have
 graduated from junior middle school.   It is inappropriate for me to write
 to the school regarding your admission.  The school should decide whether
 you passed the examination and have been selected.   If you are not admitted
 to the school of higher grade, you may review your lessons at home.
 Enclosed is 300 yuan for your mother.   I will send you more money later.
 Do not worry.
 Mao Zedong, 8 June 1957

 LEARN FROM COMRADE LIU BOCHENG
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 5-9, 31
 [Article by Xiao Ke [5135 0344]]
 [Text] Comrade Liu Bocheng is a devoted proletarian revolutionary, a tested
 marshal, a Marxist military theorist and a noble-minded communist fighter.
 His magnificent contributions and his inspiring words and deeds are models
 for the whole party and the whole army.   I knew Comrade Bocheng's name at a
 very young age.   The second day after the start of the Nanchang uprising, I
 saw in the street a bulletin by the advisory group of the revolutionary
 committee.   Liu Bocheng's signature heading others caught my attention.
 This was the first time I saw his name.   Only later did I realize that he
 was a brave and remarkable general of Sichuan well versed in the military
 arts.  During the period connected with the central revolutionary base, I
 could not tear myself away from any translation or work by him that I picked
 up.   To me, he was a cherished mentor.   In the summer of 1936, the 2d and
 4th Front Armies of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army converged
 on Ganzi.   I at last saw Comrade Bocheng.   I regretted  not having had such
 an opportunity earlier.
 Comrade Bocheng said with emotion:   "I am very proud to be a member of the
 Communist Party of China and to have found the right leader.... I wish that
 after my death, I could have a monument over my tomb bearing the inscrip-
 tion:   the tomb of Bolshevik Liu Bocheng.                          That would be a source of great
 satisfaction to me."  These words from the bottom of his heart spelled out
 Comrade Bocheng's sense of dedication to communism.  All who made his
 acquaintance had nothing but admiration for his conversion from a democrat
 of long standing into a faithful communist!
 In his youth, Bocheng cherished the idea of making the country rich and the
 army strong.   He was from a poor family.   Some people advised him to go into
 business.   He said:   "A gentleman has nothing but the well-being of the poor
 in mind.   How can he think of his own prosperity?"  He resolutely went into
 the army and participated in the revolution of 1911.   In 1912, Yuan Shikai
 usurped the fruits of the revolution of 1911.   Joining the army of Xiong
 Kewu, a member of the Sichuan League, Comrade Bocheng participated in the

 first battle against Yuan..  After its failure, Dr Sun Yat-sen reorganized the
 scattered members of the KMT and established the Chinese Revolutionary Party.
 Comrade Bocheng in Shanghai joined it.  At the end of 1915, Yuan Shikai laid
 claim to the title of emperor.  From Yunnan, Cai E led an army to Sichuan to
 fight Yuan Shikai in defense of the country.  Yuan Shikai made Cao Kun lead
 an army upstream for Sichuan.   The two forces were thrown into a decisive
 battle in the neighborhood of Luzhou and Naqi.  At this time, Comrade
 Bocheng was leading the 4th Detachment of the Sichuan Safeguard-the-Country
 Army.   His troops occupied the important town of Fengdu, intercepting enemy
 troop transportation on the Changjiang River and attacking the flank of
 troops sent to help Cao Kun.   This gave an effective boost to the northward
 advance of Cai E's Safeguard-the-Country Army.   Comrade Bocheng spent 10
 years in the Sichuan army rising from platoon leader to a ranking commander.
 He witnessed the replacement of the old militarists by the new ones and the
 sorry plight and miserable fate of the people.   He deeply felt that there
 was no hope for the realization of his original idea of saving the country
 and the people.  His despair was bitter.
 After the Russian October Revolution, Marxism-Leninism was brought to China.
 In the autumn of 1923, Comrade Bocheng was seriously wounded in his left leg
 in a battle against bandits  (represented by Wu Peifu).   He recuperated in
 Chengdu.   He got acquainted with Communist Party members Wu Yuzhang and
 Yang Angong.   They became good friends talking about the situation and
 discussing Marxism-Leninism.   Thereafter, he broadened his horizon and his
 thinking changed greatly.   Just as Bocheng was in a confused state of mind
 looking back over the past and pondering the future, militarist Lai Xinhui
 asked Chengbo's former subordinate Wang Erchang to persuade Bocheng to
 fill an important military post in Lai's army.  Comrade Bocheng replied:
 "I have been with you for so many years.   But you still don't know what I
 want.   Yue Wumu said:   'Just as a civil official is not greedy for gain so
 a military official is unafraid of death.'   I am from a poor family.   I
 have nothing to fear in fighting the enemy.  My only fear is that there
 may be trouble from within and without.  The country may be reduced to such
 a state that officials carry out persecution and soldiers throw their weight
 around, leaving the people in a sad plight.  The last thing I have in mind
 is fame and fortune.  If these militarists think that they can lure me with
 high office and lucrative pay, they are dead wrong.  I have made up my mind.
 I will follow Yuzhang and leave Sichuan with him.   So long as I am alive, I
 will not stop participating in the revolution."  In May 1924, Bocheng and
 Wu Yuzhang left Sichuan together.  They went to Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong
 and Guangzhou studying the revolutionary movement.  In July 1925, they
 returned together to Chongqing.  As members of the Sichuan Provincial KMT
 Committee, they participated in the work of the leftist provincial head-
 quarters of the KMT.   In May 1926, through Yang Angong and Wu Yuzhang's
 introduction, Bocheng joined the Communist Party of China, realizing his
 conversion from a democrat into a communist.
 In the summer and autumn of 1926, the Northern Expedition jointly organized
 by the KMT and the CPC reached the Changjiang River valley.  As assigned by
 the party, Bocheng joined Yang Angong, Zhu De and Wu Yuzhang in organizing
 and leading the uprisings in Luzhou and Shunqing (Nanchong).   Five brigades

 totaling 12,000 people participated in the uprisings.   Bocheng was recom-
 mended by all as the,general commander in charge of the various route armies
 of the National Revolutionary Army in Sichuan.  The uprisings this time
 lasted from early December 1926 to the middle of May 1927.  They played a
 helpful role in the Northern Expedition, realizing the strategic aim of
 preventing the main force of the Sichuan army from moving eastward to
 threaten Wuhan--a strategic aim called for by the CPC Central Committee.
 The uprisings "shattered the pipedream of the militarists and aroused the
 consciousness of the masses, producing a great impact on the Sichuan
 situation.   Success or failure should not be the measure of a big or small
 achievement."   (The "National Bulletin," 29 January 1927)  The uprisings of
 Luzhou and Shunqing were a big contribution by the communists toward the
 Northern Expedition.   They also represented our party's first attempt in
 leading armed struggle.
 Due to Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei's rebellion against the revolution,
 coupled with rightist capitulationism erroneously promoted by the leader-
 ship organ of the Communist Party represented by Chen Duxiu, the spectacular
 great revolution failed.   Serious White terro-: was subjecting every revolu-
 tionary to a test.   Some of the revolutionaries retired from the scene,
 assuming a passive attitude.  Some gave up their cause and joined the
 reactionary camp.  A number of most devoted communists and proletarian
 revolutionaries represented by Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhang Tailei and
 other comrades formed the backbone in keeping the cause alive.   "Wiping off
 the bloodstains from their own bodies and burying the corpses of their good
 companions, they kept on fighting."   ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 3,
 p 985)  At this historical turning point, Bocheng displayed the firm faith
 and high principles of a Communist Party member.   Knowing what should be
 done, he first found his way to Wuhan and then reached Nanchang.   He joined
 'thou Enlai, Zhu De, He Long, Ye Ting and other comrades in leading the
 Nanchang uprising, firing the first shot in resisting the KMT reactionary
 group and turning a new page in the history of the Chinese revolution.
 A Marxist Strategist and Military Theorist
 Comrade Bocheng was one of the founders of the Chinese People's Liberation
 Army.   In the long period of revolutionary war, he directed many battles
 and fought and won many major battles.   He was an invincible general strik-
 ing awe into the enemy.  He left a glorious page in the history of the
 Chinese revolution and the revolutionary war.  His art of directing mili-
 tary operations and his combat strategies formed an important part of Mao
 Zedong-'s military thinking.   Comrade Bocheng was worth being called a
 tested marshal, Marxist strategist and, military theorist.
 After the failure of the Nanchang uprising, the party sent him to study in
 the Soviet Union.   In the summer of 1930, he returned to the country from
 the Soviet Union.   The party Central Committee assigned him to the
 Changjiang Bureau as secretary of the military committee.  At a meeting of
 the Presidium of the Changjiang Bureau on 3 September, he relayed the
 instructions on Wuhan's work given by Comrade Zhou Enlai as representative
 of the party Central Committee.  He prevented the execution of the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 adventurist plan calling for an insurrection in Wuhan.  The likely damage
 arising from "leftist" putschism was avoided.  In January 1932, Comrade
 Bocheng joined the central soviet area and acted for the first time as
 president of the Red Army College and concurrently political commissar.
 In October, he served as chief of the General Staff of the Red Army helping
 Comrades Zhou Enlai and Zhu De in directing operations and achieving a great
 victory in the fourth counter-"encirclement" campaign.  During the Long
 March, Comrade Bocheng assumed weighty responsibilities and worked uncom-
 plainingly.   Before the Zunyi meeting, he brought up the rear of V Corps,
 giving the central organ cover in breaking through four enemy blockade
 lines.  At the end of 1934, the central authorities transferred Comrade
 Bocheng back to the military committee.  He again acted as chief of the             o
 general staff and concurrently commander of the central column.  After the
 Zunyi meeting, Comrade Bocheng led, an advance force seizing important points
 and paving the way for the advance of the whole army.   This enabled the Red
 Army to get across the Jinsha River, through the area of the Yi nationality
 and across the Dadu River to reach the Sichuan-Xikang plateau and join
 forces with the 4th Front Army.   In the spring of 1937, Comrade Bocheng was
 appointed as the commander of the army sent to help the Western Route Army.
 At this time, the Western Route Army was fighting a hard battle with the
 enemy on the Hexi corridor with neither the support of the party nor a mass
 foundation.   It was hard put to obtain grain and munition supplies.
 Bocheng urged his army units to start on their way quickly.   He was worried
 over the plight of the Western Route Army.   He was overflowing with class
 sentiment.  When his army reached Zhenyuan, the Western Route Army had
 unfortunately been defeated.   Bocheng and Political Commissar Zhang Hao led
 the masses of cadres and fighters of the 4th Front Army in correctly waging
 a struggle to criticize Zhang Guotao's mistakes.
 After the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war, Bocheng was appointed the
 commander of the 129th Division of the 8th Route Army.   Together with
 Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, Deputy Divisional Commander Xu Xiangqian
 and other comrades, he led the effort to establish the Shanxi-Hebei-Henan
 anti-Japanese base in the Taihang Mountains.  They successfully organized
 and directed the battles of Shentou Ridge and Xiangtangpu; led their army
 units to break through the encirclement of nine routes by the Japanese
 renegades and smashed the policy of imprisonment pursued by the Japanese
 renegades, opening up and developing vast areas eastward to the Jinpu road,
 westward to the Tongpu road, northward to the Cangshi road and Zhengtai
 road, and southward to the Huanghe River.   Thus, they established the
 Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan base, which became one of the important anti-          o
 Japanese bases.   In September 1945, the militarymen and civilians of the
 whole Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan area launched a massive counterattack
 against the enemy.   In a short period of time, they annihilated more than
 50,000 enemy troops and recaptured 59 counties and towns.  Bocheng was one
 of the main leaders responsible for this brilliant achievement.
 After the victory in the anti-Japanese war in 1945, the Chiang Kai-shek KMT
 in September that year launched an attack on the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-
 Henan liberated area and occupied six towns in our Shangdang Prefecture.
 Bocheng and Comrade Xiaoping led their army units to fight bravely in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 self-defense.  At one stroke, they annihilated 13 enemy divisions composed,
 of more than 35,000 people.  This provided effective support for Comrades
 Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in their peace talks in Chongqing.   Chiang
 Kai-shek was forced to sign the "double 10th agreement."  But Chiang Kai-shek
 gave lip service to peace on the one hand and concentrated large numbers of
 troops to push northward from Xinxiang along the Pinghan road on the other.
 Bocheng and Comrade Xiaoping immediately sent forces eastward and organized
 and directed the Pinghan battle, annihilating two army corps comprising
 23,000 people.  Another army corps and a column revolted and crossed over
 while in the battlefield.   Thanks to the great victories achieved in
 Shangdang and Pinghan and in other battlefields, half a year of peace
 ensued.   On 26 June 1946, Chiang Kai-shek blatantly tore the peace agreement
 to pieces and launched an all-out attack on the liberated area.  Together
 with Comrade Xiaoping, Bocheng organized and directed the battles of Longhai,
 Dingtao, Juye, Juancheng and Huaxian.   Victories were achieved in all the
 five battles.   Ten and a half brigades of the intruding Chiang troops or
 more than 70,000 people were annihilated.  This gave an effective boost to
 the efforts on other battlefields in the country.   Chiang Kai-shek's plan
 for an all-out attack was smashed.  In June 1947, to crush Chiang Kai-shek's
 concentrated attack, Bocheng and Comrade Xiaoping led their troops to cross
 over the natural barrier of the Huanghe River at one stroke.  After annihi-
 lating nine and a half brigades of enemy troops in southwest Shandong, they
 advanced quickly making straight for the Daibie Mountains.   This was the
 enemy's most strategically sensitive and yet weakest area--a vantage point
 of ours jeopardizing Nanjing to the east, Wuhan to the west, the Changjiang
 River to the south and threateningly overlooking the central plains.   It was
 like a sharp blade thrust at the.enemy's heart, pinning down 90 of the 160
 brigades on their southern front and raising the curtain on the strategic
 counterattack in the war of liberation.
 At the end of 1948, together with Xiaoping, Chen Yi, Su Yu, Zhen Lin and
 other comrades, Comrade Bocheng directed a decisive battle on an unprece-
 dentedly large scale--the Huai-Hai campaign.   They achieved a great victory
 annihilating 22 army corps and 56 divisions or 555,000 enemy troops and
 realizing Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction before the battle:   "Given
 victory in this battle, not only will the situation north of the Changjiang
 River be brought under control but also the national situation as a whole
 can be basically taken care of."  In January 1949, Comrade Bocheng acted
 as the commander of the 2d Field Army.   Together with Political Commissar
 Comrade Deng Xiaoping, he led troops to cross the river liberating vast
 areas of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Fujian.   Not long after, they
 received orders to attack southwest China.   They resorted to the practice
 of making a big detour and a big encirclement--beating the enemy to it in
 occupying important points and cutting off their retreat.   The enemy troops
 ran away helter-skelter, revolted, crossed over, or were killed.   There
 were 900,000 such enemy troops.  With southwest China under control, the war
 of liberation basically ended.  Thus, the long period of battle life also
 ended for Comrade Bocheng.
 During the long period of revolutionary war, Comrade Bocheng displ2vved the
 poise and talent of a great strategist who was both prudent and decisive in

 directing operations.  He was capable of arriving at a correct understanding
 and judgment of the enemy's strategy and battle plans.   He was no less
 skilled in deploying his own troops in light of the conditions concerning
 the enemy and ourselves.   Therefore, he could foresee the development of the
 war and seize the initiative in fighting.   Comrade Bocheng often stressed
 that commanders and fighters at all levels must have a clear idea of given
 tasks, information about the enemy, our own position, the terrain, and the
 time factor.  He called these points "five tricks."  He consistently opposed
 fighting in a "rigid" way and opposed the strategy of "meeting force with
 force."  Instead, he called for "capitalizing on every favorable factor and
 avoiding all unfavorable ones and annihilating the enemy flexibly."  In
 practice, he carried on and developed many tricks in war, such as
 "encircling a city and attacking the reinforcements," "concentrating on one
 point, attracting the attention of the relief troops, tackling a given part
 of them and annihilating them one by one," "making an encirclement on three
 sides, leaving one side open, providing a make-believe route of escape and
 setting a trap," "aiming for the heart of a fierce tiger," and the snake-
 beating art of "pinning down its head, grabbing its tail and cutting it in
 two."  He was skilled in using military dialectics to organically unify
 strategy, battle and tactics.  This provided a magic weapon for defeating
 the enemy.   In a fair assessment and a graphic description of him, Comrade
 Chen Yi said:   "He is the modern version of Sun Wu when it comes to the
 military art.   In his dedication to protect national territory, he'is the
 match of Fan Han in ancient history."  A review of Comrade Bocheng's
 revolutionary life of battle shows that he really "has the style of well-
 known ancient generals and is a general with expertise rarely seen in the
 country."
 These great achievements of Comrade Bocheng are inseparable from his
 assiduous study and research efforts.  He had a busy military life and was
 always on the move.   But he took time out to seriously study military works
 by Engels and Mao Zedong and well-known works on the military art by writers
 in modern and ancient times at home and abroad.  Having regard to changes
 in the situation and our army's needs, he translated many works related to
 the civil war in the Soviet Union and the antifascist war--works of all
 kinds from small-scale to large-scale fighting and from defense to attack.
 The aim of making the past serve the present and foreign things serve China
 was really achieved.   Comrade Bocheng paid great attention to summing up
 experiences in fighting.  He wrote many good military works.  The "Selection
 of Military Writings by Liu Bocheng" soon to be published is the crystal-
 lization of his brilliant thinking on military life.   His military works and
 his translations were his magnificent contributions to our military history.
 They have produced and will continue to produce a great impact on the
 building of our army.   Military commentators have traditionally held that
 a good strategist should combine the three arts of leading soldiers, train-
 ing soldiers and using soldiers.   Comrade Bocheng is a master of all the
 three arts.   He is called a Marxist strategist and military theorist.  His
 repute is well deserved.

 The Founder of Our Military Colleges
 During the protracted revolutionary war, Comrade Bocheng was deeply aware
 of the fact that all the powerful armies, at all times and in all countries,
 could not "fight without given training."  To give training, it was first
 necessary to train cadres.   Therefore at the time of the Lushun uprising,
 at the time he first entered the central soviet area, at the time the 4th
 Front Army was attacked by Zhang Guotao and from the time of the war of
 resistance against Japan to after the nationwide liberation, he always
 attached great importance to setting up a military college.   Sometimes, he
 concurrently supervised the work of the college in the capacity of command-
 ing officer, and at times, he devoted his whole attention to the work.  He
 worked conscientiously and painstakingly and took infinite care in turning
 out batch after batch of qualified people versed in polite letters and
 martial arts for the army.
 Before the nationwide liberation, our army was scattered in rural areas
 among various strategic areas.   There was only a single poorly equipped arm
 in the army.  Although there were military schools in various major areas,
 most of them were still in the primitive stage of learning to fight by
 taking part in actual fighting.  After winning nationwide political power,
 just as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:   "A basic change has already taken
 place in this kind of objective condition.   We are now at the higher stage
 of army building, or the stage of mastering modern technology."  For the
 sake of enabling our army to complete this new historical change, it was
 necessary to set up military colleges in keeping with modern conditions.
 Comrade Bocheng, who advocated "to run the army well, we must run military
 colleges well," resigned from his post as chairman of the Southwest Mili-
 tary and Political Committee and earnestly proposed to the Central Com-
 mittee:   "The war.is now over, let me go and set up military colleges!"
 The Central Committee handed this difficult task to Comrade Bocheng.  This
 indeed could be described as picking the right man for the job!
 In October 1950, Comrade Bocheng received instructions to set up a military
 college.  He made light of the hardship and braced himself for the vigorous
 effort of making a success of the work.  With this revolutionary spirit of
 bravely exploring, he discovered the experience for properly setting up
 regular higher command schools in the new historical period.   In drawing up
 training policies for the military college, he proposed:  Using Mao Zedong's
 thinking on integrating theory with practice to unify military thinking,
 reorganize the style of study, oppose empiricism and guard against dog-
 matism.  He stressed that attention must be paid to opposing two tendencies
 in training:   First is the tendency of casting away our former foundation,
 the fine tradition of the PLA and Mao Zedong's military thinking.   The other
 is the tendency of stubborn conservative unwillingness to accept new things
 and modern military sciences.  With regard to the purpose of training, he
 proposed:   Train senior commanders and staff officers loyal to the party
 and to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people led by the party and
 who are good at organizing and commanding modern units composed of regi-
 ments, divisions and various services in coordinated operation.  These

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 policies and principles for setting up military colleges were basically
 affirmed at that time.
 Under the historical conditions of that time, Comrade Bocheng studied the
 advanced experience of the Soviet Union in accordance with the instructions
 of the Central Committee.   He insisted on learning the organizational and
 command experiences of the Soviet Army on the basis of summing up the battle
 experiences of our army.  He translated and edited a complete set of teach-
 ing materials on military theory and gradually built a Red and expert con-
 tingent of instructors.                           For the sake of bringing theoretical study and
 planning exercises closer to reality,  the military college organized a total
 of 35 military maneuvers and 12 large-scale field exercises from 1951 to
 1955.   These activities not only unified thinking, but they also trained
 and toughened the ability of the cadets to actually command a composite army
 in battle and played a vital role in the education and training of the units.
 For the sake of fitting in with the needs of modern warfare, naval, air
 force, artillery and armored departments were added one after the other not
 long after the setting up of the military college.  When these departments
 could independently fulfill their teaching assignments, they were also
 expanded into independent command colleges for the services with the
 approval of the Military Affairs Commission.   This enabled our army to have
 a more comprehensive college system and thereby promoted the process of
 building a modern and regular army.
 i
 In his "Instructions to the Military College," Comrade Mao Zedong highly
 appraised Comrade Bocheng's work.  He said:   "The founding of the military
 college and its teaching over the past year and more have made an important
 contribution to the building of a regular and modern national defense unit."
 Naturally, some shortcomings and mistakes existed during this period of
 military education and some unsuitable things were copied from the experi-
 ence of the Soviet Army.   These minor aspects which emerged in our advance
 because we had no experience in building a modern army were immediately
 corrected upon discovery. This was reflected in the bimonthly work report
 submitted by Comrade Bocheng to the Military Affairs Commission of the
 Central Committee.
 However, in the so-called "oppose dogmatism movement" suddenly launched in
 1958, such labels as "dogmatism" and "mistakes of the bourgeois military
 line" were imposed on Comrade Bocheng, and large numbers of comrades in
 charge of military training were also wrongly criticized.   From then on,
 "leftist" guiding  ideology began to develop in the army.   When Lin Biao
 was in control of the Military Affairs Commission, he actually negated the
 orientation of building a regular and modern army and even preposterously
 abolished military training and dissolved large numbers of military colleges.
 This caused serious damage to army building.  The leading comrade of the
 Military Affairs Commission has pointed out that the oppose "dogmatism" of
 that time was wrong.  He also said that the many military colleges estab-
 lished after the founding of the People's Republic had achieved great
 successes, but later suffered two serious reverses.   One was from oppose
 "regularization" and the other was from oppose "dogmatism."  The words of
 the leading comrade of the Military Affairs Commission are in keeping with

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 Historical facts, and they have not only reaffirmed the past achievements
 of Comrade Bocheng in setting up military colleges, but are also of impor-
 tant actual significance in bringing order out of chaos on the orientation`
 of army building and the policy of training.
 Comrade Bocheng has lofty communist moral character.   He never takes
 advantage of his great merit or fame.  He lives frugally and simply and is
 honest in performing his official duties.  He is open and aboveboard, and
 is not afraid of shouldering responsibility.  He is a model for us com-
 munists.
 He is boundlessly loyal to the party and consistently submits to the leader-
 ship of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and the
 party organization at various levels.   He used to say:   "When I joined the
 party, my oath was 'absolute obedience to the party.'   Since then, I have
 always exhorted myself:   I am a senior cadre of the revolutionary army led
 by the party, and I must be boundlessly loyal to the party.   I must set
 myself up as an example and teach the troops under me to fully accept the
 unified leadership of the party and become glorious tools of the party."
 Comrade Bocheng has faithfully carried out the oath he took when he joined
 the party scores of years ago.  At critical moments, he showed no fear of
 personal hazard in safeguarding the party organization.   In the autumn of
 1947, when Bai Chongxi dispatched more than 30 brigades to lay siege to
 Dabieshan, Comrade Bocheng was heading the evacuation of the organs of the
 Central China Bureau.  When they were camped in the Beixiangdian district
 of Guangshan County, Henan Province, they happened to run into the enemy's
 11th Division.   Bocheng's first thought was for the safety of the Central
 China Bureau.   When the comrades by his side urged him to quickly evacuate
 from the dangerous situation, he solemnly and firmly said:   "I will not
 leave without establishing contact with the Central China Bureau."  Five
 minutes passed, and then 10 minutes...it was not until the liaison staff
 reported that the Central China Bureau had safely evacuated that he would
 make his departure.
 He can take the interests of the whole into account and make concessions.
 He has strong party spirit and good party work style.   In 1939, he was
 dissatisfied with the blockhouse policy and positional warfare pushed by
 the leaders of the "leftist" line.  He would neither give advice nor offer
 plans and was not tolerated by them.  Using his quarrel with Le De as an
 excuse, the "leftist" leaders dismissed him from the post of chief of the
 general staff and assigned him as chief of staff of the 5th Army group.   He
 was not dejected and said:   "The practice of a year of battle has proved.
 that the broad masses of cadres and fighters of our Red Army are brave and
 skillful in battle.   However, there are problems in our strategy and tactics
 which must be changed."  In 1936, when Zhang Guotao insisted on moving
 south and made a split with the party and the Red Army, he righteously
 pointed out:   "The split is a mistake and will have no popular support!"
 Zhang Guotao consequently sent him to work in the Red Army Univers-ty of
 the 4th Front Army.   Comrade Bocheng took advantage of the opportunity to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 patiently propagate the correct advocation of the Central Committee to the
 cadres and, together with Comrade Zhu De, carried out a great deal of work
 in the leftist army.  Particularly after the "oppose dogmatism movement"
 in his old age, he had no choice but to leave his leadership post at the
 military college.  This aged but ambitious warhorse has actually lost its
 chance of galloping a thousand li.  When I think of it, I feel sorry for
 him!   However, even in his dotage Comrade Bocheng is still concerned about
 military defense matters and army building, and is always thinking and
 worrying about them.  He called himself an "auxiliary staff officer."  He
 is always thinking about what military work should be constructed on the
 border, which strategic highway should be quickly repaired and what should
 be done for urban civil air defense..,  When he has an idea, he will ask his
 staff officer to write it down and send it to the comrades of the Military
 Commission and the chief of the general staff for consideration.  He donated
 more than 2,000 volumes of works on military matters he had collected over
 the years to what was then the Military and Political University.   In the
 autumn of 1972, I paid a visit to Comrade Bocheng.   The moment he saw me,
 lie said:   "You have come to teach at the Military and Political University?
 Good.  I am already old.  Make a success of the work."
 He firmly believes that the masses are the makers of history.  In June 1947,
 party, government and mass representatives from all walks of life in
 northern Hebei Province presented him with an embroidered inscription with
 the characters "Evervictorious general."  He modestly said:  "You have
 called me an evervictorious general.   I really do not deserve this.   I have
 not been always victorious.   If I win most of the time that is already not
 bad.   I only performed my duty under the leadership of Chairman Mao and
 Commander in Chief Zhu and with the support of the people in the rear areas.
 The credit should belong to the party and the people.   I dare not claim
 credit for the achievement of other people.  Without the civilians provid-
 ing us with food and clothing, the army cannot fight in a war."  These
 simple and unpretentious words are not a polite remark but his world out-
 look.                He constantly educated the cadres:   "Some of our cadres think that
 they have won this battle and I have won that battle, or, I have opened up
 this region and he has opened up that region.  Actually, without the masses
 joining the army where does your army come from?  Without the workers making
 clothes and guns, how can you win a battle without the workers making
 clothes and guns, how can you win a battle without clothes and guns?  If
 the masses do not organize mass organizations and do not elect the political
 power, how can your region be opened up?   Therefore, all the credit should
 belong to the working people.  We ourselves are only members of the masses."
 This is. the way he understands the relations between the generals and the
 masses.   He has lectured the cadres on numerous occasions to explain this
 viewpoint and to oppose the tendency of claiming credit for oneself and
 becoming arrogant.
 On Comrade Bocheng's 50th birthday, Comrade Deng Xiaoping composed an essay
 to him:   "His fervent love for the country, the people and his party is a
 fine quality every communist must possess.   Our Comrade Bocheng not only
 possesses this quality, but he has also dedicated his whole life to the
 country, the people and his party."  To learn from Comrade Bocheng, we must
 proceed by wholeheartedly dedicating our lives to the motherland, to the

 PROPERLY USING POWER ENTRUSTED BY THE PEOPLE--READING COMRADE MAO ZEDONG'S
 FIVE LETTERS TO RELATIVES AND FRIENDS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 10-11
 [Article by RED FLAG commentator]
 [Text] Comrade Mao Zedong's five letters to his relatives and friends,
 which are carried in this issue of our journal, were written from 1950 to
 1957. They raised a serious question:  How should the cadres of the party
 in power properly use the power the people entrusted to them; should they
 seek private gain for themselves or a few people, or work for the interests
 of the masses of people?  An important factor is how they treat their
 relatives and friends.  This is an important question concerning our
 party's nature and purpose.   Comrade Mao Zedong's letters expounded the
 correct principles toward this question.   They are brilliant examples
 for us in this respect.
 The principles expounded in Comrade Mao Zedong's five letters can be sum-
 marized into the following three points:                            1) Comrade Mao Zedong was very
 glad to hear from his relatives and friends about his "hometown situation."
 He hoped that they would "often write to me and tell me something about our
 hometown."  While telling Comrade Mao Zedong about his "hometown situa-
 tion," some relatives and friends also requested him to respond in one or
 two words about his hometown so as to directly help solve some problems.
 Comrade Mao Zedong politely declined their request.   He said:   "It is not
 appropriate to give independent and preferential consideration of the
 interests of a few localities."  "As to local affairs, I would like to
 collect some materials for reference.   But I would not, and indeed should
 not, directly handle local problems of a general nature, because that
 would embarrass the local party committee and government."  2) To those
 relatives and friends who asked for help in finding jobs or admission to a
 .school, Comrade Mao Zedong politely declined and furthermore patiently
 tried to educate them.   In his letter to Wen Nansong he wrote:   "As to
 Yunchang's work, it is inadvisable that he get a job through my recommenda-
 tion.  He should do something among the people and win their faith before
 he can get a job."  In his letter to Sun Peijun he wrote:   "It is not suit-
 able for me to write to the school, so far as your study at a higher school
 is concerned, whether you can be admitted should be decided by the school
 only."  3) Comrade Mao Zedong advised the party branch and government of

 Shicheng township to supervise and educate his relatives and "not to feel
 awkward or balk at criticizing their shortcomings, mistakes and backward-
 ness because they are my relatives."  He said that he hoped his relatives
 would be "treated exactly the same as the masses and would not be given any
 preference." In short, the main spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's five
 letters can be summed up as follows: Never use one's position and power to
 seek private interests and preferential treatment for one's relatives,
 friends and hometown, strictly require one's relatives and friends "not to
 seek privilege," and resolutely support the party and government organiza-
 tions to criticize and deal with the shortcomings and mistakes of one's
 relatives and friends.  This is the attitude Comrade Mao Zedong adopted
 toward his relatives and friends.  It is also the only correct communist
 attitude.
 Comrade Mao Zedong set a good example in this respect.   So did many other
 veteran proletarian revolutionaries like Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi and Zhu De
 and the majority of the thousands upon thousands of high and middle-ranking
 officials and grassroots cadres.  Since they acted in strict accordance
 with the party's principles, set strict demands on their relatives and
 friends as well as on their own children, asking them not to seek privilege,
 and did not use their positions and power to seek private gain for their
 relatives, friends and children, they won the trust and admiration of the
 people.   Comrade Luo Shunchu, a former leader of the consultative group of
 the PLA Shenyang units and a veteran Red Army soldier, set strict demands
 on himself and his children throughout his life.   He fostered a revolu-
 tionary atmosphere in his family.   Facts show that there are many such
 examples within our party.   This is a good tendency and a fine tradition
 of our party.
 Not using one's position and power to seek personal gain for one's rela-
 tives and friends is a principle determined by the nature of our party.
 Marx and Engels pointed out in their "Communist Manifesto":   "All previous
 movements were movements of a few people, or movements for the interests
 of a few people.   The movements of the proletariat are, however, movements
 of the majority and are for the interests of the majority of people."
 ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 1, p 262)  Ours is a proletarian
 political party which seeks the interests of the majority of the people.
 Every party member, especially every cadre, has the duty of serving the
 people heart and soul, and is granted no privileges.  If a cadre thinks
 that he is a cut above other people and certainly has the privilege to seek
 personal gain for his wife and children and other relatives and friends,
 then he is running counter to the purpose of the Communist Party, and what
 he does does not conform to the description and role of a party member and
 a cadre.
 During the decade of internal disorder, the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing
 counterrevolutionary cliques seriously damaged our party's work style
 through their factionalist and illegal activities.   They preached such
 fallacies as "power means everything" and "power may expire and become
 invalid," which greatly corroded people's minds?   Their pernicious influ-
 ence on some cadres has not yet been totally eliminated.  An example of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 this is that some cadres have not acted according to principles in treating
 their relatives and friends.  They have placed their family or personal
 relationship'above the revolutionary relationship and have taken advantage
 of their position and power to solve such problems as school enrollment,
 employment, joining the party, receiving a promotion, going abroad and
 returning to work in cities for their relatives and friends through improper
 or illegal channels.  When their relatives and friends committed mistakes
 or crimes, they tried all possible means to protect them and cover up their
 mistakes and evil deeds, or even took advantage of their power to bully
 others so as to obstruct the execution of discipline and the laws.  Another
 expression is that some "warmhearted people" have, under the pretext of
 "caring for comrades and showing consideration for leaders," sought personal
 gains by various means for the relatives, friends and children of their
 leaders and friends.   They have actually attempted to seek preferential
 treatment for themselves and their relatives, friends and children by fawn-
 ing over their leaders.   Instead of regarding it as a disgrace, they took it
 as an honor.  They did not realize that this is a reflection on themselves
 of a feudalist privilege mentality and the corrosive bourgeois ideology.
 The socialist system is a new social system.  Under this system, the rela-
 tionship between man and man, including the relationship between family
 members and relatives and friends, must first be comradeship on the basis
 of revolutionary principles.  Every party member and cadre must closely
 relate his family, relatives and friends to the destiny of the state, the
 nation and the people.   The interests of the former must never be placed
 above the fundamental interests of the latter.   Like a mirror, the attitude
 of a party member and cadre toward his family, relatives and friends clearly
 reflects his party spirit and work style.   It also has an important bearing
 on the relationship between the party and the masses.   After the founding
 of the PRC, Comrade Zhou Enlai repeatedly stressed that cadres must pass
 "five tests," that is, the ideological test, the political test, the social
 test, and test of relatives and friends, and the test of hard life.  At
 present, under the new historical conditions, it is necessary for our party
 members and cadres to check themselves again to see whether they have
 successfully passed these tests.
 Lu Xun said:   "Not exactly all passionless men are real heroes."  We com-
 munists have never denied the passionate feelings between relatives and
 friends and have never prohibited people from establishing normal contacts
 with their relatives and friends.  However, we have our own principles in
 dealing with these feelings and contacts.   We hold that personal feelings
 must be related to the passionate feelings toward the peoples, and the
 former must never be played above the latter.   Personal relationships must
 be subordinate to the revolutionary relationships and must never surpass
 the latter.  When one's relatives and friends commit mistakes or crimes,
 one must not protect them and try to cover up their mistakes and evil deeds.
 One must not protect "private feelings" at the expense of "public laws."
 In short, in treating our relatives and friends, we must always adhere to
 the party's stand and principles and always have our party's purpose in
 mind.   In this respect, we must earnestly learn from the proletari'n revo-
 lutionaries of the older generation represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, and

 actually follow their examples in our actions.  We must all learn something
 from Comrade Mao Zedong's five letters to his relatives and friends, raise
 our consciousness and unify our understanding so that we can encourage each
 other to properly use the power entrusted by the people and advance forward
 side by side.

 COMMUNISTS SHOULD UPHOLD PRINCIPLES IN HANDLING FAMILY PROBLEMS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 12-13, 40
 [Article by Zhu Yan [2612 1484]]
 [Text]   The Communist Party has nearly 40 million members, every one with
 his or her own relatives and family.   Communist Party members, as the lead-
 ing section of the proletariat class must, when dealing with the problems
 of relations between family members and relatives, uphold the party line
 and certain principles.   The most important thing is that they set an
 example while teaching and helping their family and other relatives that
 the most important thing is to act for the benefit of the party and the
 people, that the good of the party and the people must come before the
 good of the individual or the small family unit, and to prevent or correct
 any actions which might be damaging to the good of the party or the people.
 Of course, it should be made very clear that the vast majority of party
 members carry out such duties very well.  The older generation of proletariat
 revolutionaries and various other outstanding communists may all be cited as
 paragons  of the communist way of thinking in terms of their correct handling
 of family problems.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that some communists,
 including some leading cadres, do not perform their duties well in this area;
 one might even say in some cases, that they are very bad.   Some choose to
 socialize and never talk about anything of any importance with their fami-
 lies, tend to spoil and pamper their children, creating very unfavorable
 tendencies which then go unchecked and become overlenient.   Some tend to
 take advantage of their position and use the back door for their families
 and relatives, helping them to do such things as move to the city, to
 school, get jobs or receive promotions.   Some, in a brazen attempt to
 satisfy the unreasonable demands of their families, take over organizational
 distribution and actually make alterations   in work conditions, while others
 find every means possible to create a "nest of hedonism" for their families.
 There are still others who resort to deception so that their children or
 other relatives may go to Hong Kong or leave China without a care for the
 integrity of the country or the individual.   But what is of a more serious
 nature are those who either overtly or covertly support and connive with
 .their families to engage in smuggling and illegal selling as well as specu-
 lation, swindling and corruption.  Some even directly involve themselves and
 their families in such fraudulent and illegal activities.   Such phenomena

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 are clear illustrations of the egoism of the capitalist classes which has
 developed in the hearts of some communists and their families, causing them
 to lose their original leadership spirit.  Not only do such people harm the
 great reputation of the Communist Party, they also damage the party struc-
 ture and are a very bad influence on the general mood of society.  Every
 level of the party structure must take a serious look at this problem, and
 make every effort to rectify it.
 The Communist Party of China is a well-formed and tested proletariat polit-
 party armed with the philosophy of Mao Zedong and Marxism and Leninism.
 ical
 Not only does it take a serious attitude toward and openly expose and
 criticize negative elements within the party, it must also rely on its own
 strength to overcome these negative elements, transforming bad into good,
 educating every party member and strengthening the party structure.  The
 party's history already speaks for itself in terms of such determination.
 Examples such as the smashing of the "gang of four," the restoration of order
 after chaos and the correct rerouting of the party line are all evidence
 enough.  The party has already made great efforts to correct the mistakes
 of some communists in their handling of family problems including the severe
 punishment of some very bad criminal elements.  The extremely important task
 now before us is to clarify to a greater extent the principles of family
 behavior to each party member and to set up a correct and revolutionary view
 of the family.
 The family is a cell within society and family relations always reflect a
 certain historically developed stage in production relations.   In China,
 both the victory of the revolutionary task of the people and the transfor-
 mation by socialism of the previous system of private ownership of the
 means of production are basically finished, necessitating the establishment
 of a new form of socialist family relations.  Within this new kind of
 family, not only is it necessary to destroy the outdated idea of subordina-
 tion of one family member to another, which is rooted in the basis of the
 system of private ownership of the means of production, but it is also vital
 to reestablish new relations between the family and society.  In other words
 we must bind tightly together the happiness and pleasures of each family
 with the future and destiny of countless millions of others as well as the
 future
 and destiny of our socialist homeland.   The families of Communist
 Party
 members
 should become models for this new kind of family.   E
 very
 single
 party
 member, regardless of his or her position within the
 family,
 'should
 adopt
 philosophies and actions of this advanced core of the
 prole-
 tariat
 to influence and guide every member of the family, strictly
 adhering
 to party philosophies and principles to eradicate contradictions within
 family life and should strive to create unified harmony within the family to
 form a revolutionary collective struggling together for the causes of
 socialism.
 Should the Communist Party lay down principles related to family love?  Of
 course it should.   But it is not the feudal and patriarchal kind of love that
 is reflected in the old sayings such as "When a man goes to heaven so does
 his entire family," nor is it the vulgar love of the bottom levels of the
 capitalist classes which takes enjoyment and money as its central themes.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 It is instead a love emanating from a Communist Party member, under the
 guidance of the party and its principles, helping to unite the spirit of
 his family and relations with the revolutionary cause of the proletariat.
 He or she should promote mutual concern, consideration, help and under-
 standing with his or her spouse, parents, children and other relatives.
 But anyone who wants to put the narrow confines of the family above the
 good of the party, the country and the people, is contravening a law of. the
 party and the government and is committing a crime against the moral prin-
 ciples of socialism and communism.  Under the conditions of socialism, if
 the good of the individual family is put above the good of the country and
 the people, a conflict will arise, often resulting in undesired results
 which in the long run are bad for the country, the people and the indi-
 vidual family.
 In dealing with the question of whether a party member is correctly uphold-
 ing party principles when dealing with family problems it is important to
 examine, after he or she has come to terms with power they possess, whether
 they are abusing this power to benefit their family.
 After the Communist Party began to rule the c.:ountry, many party members
 were given certain powers and thereafter lived for a long time in a peace-
 ful environment, with a stable family life and ever-increasing family rela-
 tions.  Among some party members, the number of cadres who became more
 involved in family affairs and their children's situations increased and
 we saw the appearance of some people who wanted to use their powers within
 the family to gain special "favors and allowances."  Under this situation
 our comrades were faced with the problem of how to correctly manipulate the
 powers bestowed on the people.   The question of whether our party members
 are able to stand up to this sort of test or whether or not they have good
 family relations is not a question related to individuals, but is a ques-
 tion of great concern to the whole positive or negative mood within the
 Communist Party.   If some people decide to adopt an attitude of abusing
 the power they have been given and wasting their time while gaining
 advantages for their own families by means of the power they possess, then
 the power bestowed on them becomes abused and lessens in quality, they
 themselves are abusing their positions as public servants and there is even
 a danger of overturning the stability of the society.   In order to avoid
 this danger, the party has for many years stressed the importance of
 correcting these few errant communists and cadres.   It is clearly stated in
 "Concerning the Principles of Political Life Within the Communist Party"
 that it is forbidden for anyone to abuse their power to gain benefits for
 their own family, it is forbidden for anyone to separate public and private
 and to use public office for private gain.   Furthermore, it is forbidden
 for any leader or cadre to transgress any of the party's criteria and
 structural principles for cadres or to promote or aid the promotion to a
 leadership position of any member of one's family.   It is forbidden for
 anyone to reveal state or party secrets to family members, and no one may
 overstep one's authority and meddle in the work of the party or state or
 see to it that a family member is placed in a position of crucial impor-
 tance in relation to one's own position.   Such rules reflect the funda-
 mental good of the party, the country and the people and in addition

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 embodies the expectations and respect of the party and the people toward
 the party members and hence, every self-respecting self-possessed party
 member, especially leading cadres, should without exception strictly observe
 these guidelines or rules.
 Communists who uphold these principles in handling family problems should
 not simply handle each problem one at a time but should constantly
 strengthen education along the party lines, encouraging and giving support
 to using communist thinking in fighting against individualism and other
 nonproletariat thinking.  While creating an objective world, every party
 member should consciously build a subjective world and firmly establish a
 communist world view and morality and build up strength to resist the
 corrosive influence of exploitive capitalist thinking.  It should be said
 here that most Communist Party members have already reached this level of
 consciousness, but there will always be a certain number of people who
 lack such a consciousness and indeed under some circumstances it can occur
 that those with consciousness may lose it.   Thus the importance of party
 member and cadre consciousness must be stressed.  In addition we must have
 supervision by the organization and supervision by the masses, as one is
 vital to the other.   Recently the supervision of cadres by the masses has
 intensified and the number of people who have dared to criticize those who
 abuse power to their own ends has increased.   Initially this was a very
 good thing but later many cadres began to feel awkward about the situation
 and started to use their powers to pressure or carry out reprisals against
 their critics.   Obviously the party cannot in any way ignore these "special
 party members," and the more they concern themselves with their families and
 themselves, the greater the necessity for strict supervision.   The recently
 investigated economic criminal cases helped step up the supervision by the
 organization and by the masses and made a move toward helping to solve some
 of these problems.    Such problems which are present in any areas or depart-
 ments should be immediately investigated by party members in authority,
 thereby helping to strengthen softened and lapsed party structures.  We must
 encourage and insist on finding those cadres and party members from
 conniving and protective families who have committed various crimes and get
 them to quickly correct their mistakes and severely punish those who insti-
 gate or participate in activities and crimes involving family members and
 who refuse to repent and mend their ways.  We believe that if the whole party
 works with unremitting efforts we can achieve these goals and thereby deeply
 impress and educate the wide  spectrum of party members and cadres with the
 party line.   In this way, not only will we be able to put a relatively quick
 stop to the incorrect thinking of some party members in terms of their
 family problems, but at the same time we will be able to encourage all
 Communist Party members to conscientiously strive toward the establishment
 of a new kind of family setup which will correspond to the principles of
 socialism.  This without a doubt would have a deep influence on and be felt
 by the millions of families in China, resulting in an improvement and change
 in the mood of society, both in the cities and the countryside, and would
 powerfully spread the material, cultural and spiritual facts of socialism.

 ON THE WORKING CLASS AFTER THE ELIMINATION OF THE BOURGEOISIE AS AN
 EXPLOITING CLASS IN OUR COUNTRY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 14-18
 [Article by Yu Yannan [2456 3601 0589]]
 [Text]  Editor's Note:   From this issue onwards, this
 publication will publish a series of articles on the
 current situation of the working class in our country.
 These articles will later be compiled into a book by
 the RED FLAG Publishing House.
 Over the past 30 years or more since the founding of the country and in the
 wake of the advancement of our country's socialist cause, the contingent
 of our country's working class has greatly developed.  According to statis-
 tics, the total number of workers in the country was 8 million in 1949 and
 was 109 million in 1981, an increase of more than 1,200 percent.   In 1949,
 there were only 3.9 million industrial workers who formed the main body of
 the working class--workers of the units owned by the whole people including
 industrial, capital construction, communications and transportation, and
 postal and telecommunications units, but the number was raised to 46 million
 in 1981, showing an increase of about 1,100 percent.  In 1952, there were
 only 164,000 engineers and technicians in the units owned by the whole
 people, but the number rose to 1.862 million in 1980, showing an increase of
 more than 1,000 percent.   In 1981, the proportion that workers occupied in
 the country's total urban population was raised to about 60 percent from
 14 percent in 1949.   Of this, the proportion that industrial workers working
 in units owned by the whole people occupied in the country's total urban
 population also rose to 35 percent from 7 percent in 1949.  In certain
 medium-size industrial cities such as Changzhou, Yangzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou
 U           in Jiangsu,  the number of workers already accounts for over 60 percent of
 the total urban population.   Before the founding of the country., the output
 from modernized industry only accounted for about 10 percent of the GNP, and
 in 1981, the proportion of industrial output in the GNP was raised to above
 70 percent.   This is a great historical change.   This change has, and is
 still playing, a very important role in our country's socialist moderniza-
 tion drive, the consolidation and perfection of our country's socialist
 system, the development of our party's ideology, politics and organizational
 construction and the development of our entire economic life, poli_ical life,
 cultural life and other aspects of life.

 The status and role of the greatly developed and strengthened working class
 in our country in state life and social life, and its labor situation,
 ideological and political situation, cultural and educational situation and
 other situations not only represent to a large extent the development of
 our country's economic, political and cultural situation, but also inevitably
 exert great influence on other social classes and people of various classes
 and exert great influence on the development and future of the party and
 the state.   Thus, we must attach great importance to investigation and
 research into the situation of the working class under the socialist condi-
 tions and into the ideological, political and organizational construction
 of the contingent of the working class.   In addition, we must raise the
 level of our work concerning the working class to the important agenda of
 various party and government departments at all levels.
 Currently, some comrades both inside and outside the party fail to cor-
 rectly understand the historical relation of the unity of opposites of
 mutual interdependence between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and that
 they are prerequisites for one another.   They hold the view that since the
 bourgeoisie in our country has been fundamentally eliminated as an exploiting
 class, the working class as its antithesis will discontinue to exist as a
 class.  This view fundamentally distorts the actual social situation of our
 country and seriously affects work in many respects.   This view accounts for
 many problems that we encounter in actual practice such as neglecting the
 building of the contingent of the working class, giving up education among
 the working class, slackening efforts in giving play to the advanced role
 of the working class, not being enthusiastic enough in imbuing the peasants
 and masses with the ideology of the working class, thinking that everything
 is unanimous between the working class, peasants and intellectuals judging
 by their unanimous fundamental interests, and denying class distinctions in
 a socialist society.   Thus, we think that when talking about the question of
 the working class now and discussing the building of the contingent of the
 working class, we must primarily clarify this incorrect view.  We must
 unswervingly affirm both inside and outside the party the basic Marxist
 view that when the bourgeoisie has been eliminated as an exploiting class,
 the working class will not only exist but will become a strong and advanced
 class for a long time, a leading class and the principal force of a socialist
 society, and that it will exert great influence on other classes and strata.
 Undoubtedly, like all other classes and all other historical phenomena, the
 bourgeoisie and the working class come into being and develop in history,
 and must all become extinct in history.   However, we cannot naively inter-
 pret this conclusion of development laws which has been highly generalized
 and the relation of the unity of opposites between two antagonistic classes
 as meaning that they can come into being in the same morning and become
 extinct in the same morning.   In history, except for the simultaneous
 elimination of the two antagonistic classes of slaveowners and slaves, the
 two antagonistic classes of landlords and peasants have not been simultane-
 ously eliminated in the wake of the abolition of the feudal system of
 exploitation and it is impossible for the two antagonistic classes of the
 bourgeoisie and the working class to be simultaneously eliminated in the
 wake of the abolition of the bourgeois system of exploitation.   In our

 country, with the abolition of the feudal system of exploitation, the land-
 lords were eliminated as the exploiting class.  However, the class of
 peasants still existed and has started off on the socialist road after
 undergoing socialist transformation of the system of private ownership of
 the means of production.  After socialist transformation was basically com-
 pleted, our country's bourgeoisie was also basically eliminated as an
 exploiting class.  However, the working class was not eliminated in the
 wake of the elimination of the bourgeoisie but has become stronger.   Today,
 the Chinese working class, as the representative of the advanced productive
 forces and production relations, is standing like a giant in the Orient.
 By means of its vanguard force--the Communist Party of China, it leads the
 PRC and the Chinese people in carrying out the great cause of socialist
 modernization, and is playing an important role in world affairs.  Why?
 Does this violate the law of the unity of opposites or violate the.his-
 torical law of development that socialism means eliminating classes?  The
 answer is absolutely no.   Fundamentally speaking, the continued existence,
 and existence for long years to come, of the working class and the peasants
 in our country is attributable to the fact that our country's social pro-
 ductive forces are still far behind the standard required for eliminating
 all classes and class distinctions and that the Chinese working class has
 not yet fulfilled the mission entrusted to it by history.
 The historical mission of socialism, in simple words, is to eliminate
 classes and prepare conditions for ultimately making the transition to a
 proletarian communist society.  This is also the great historical mission
 shouldered by the working class.  This point has already been expounded in
 Marxist theories.   However, actual socialist practice has shown that elim-
 ination of classes is a lengthy and complicated historical process.  This
 historical process must be realized in two stages:   First, the working
 class and its vanguard force must lead and unite the broad masses of
 people, eliminate the system of exploitation and the exploiting class by
 means of a socialist revolution, and consequently, eliminate in history the
 class distinction between the exploiting class and the exploited whose
 fundamental interests contradict each other and are antagonistic to each
 other; then, by fully developing the social productive forces and creating
 conditions in various aspects over a long period of time, eliminate the
 class distinction which is of a consistent nature between the working class
 and the peasants, who enjoy the unanimous fundamental interests of the
 laboring masses, and eliminate other social distinctions, and consequently
 eliminate the working class itself and push society forward to communism
 based on a proletarian structure.   Only by realizing these two steps can
 the working class ultimately fulfill its historical mission.   The historical
 process of class elimination can only advance on the road determined by this,
 objective law.  In our country, it is absolutely impossible for the working
 class to eliminate all class distinctions and other major social distinc-
 tions in social life in a short time.   This is because our country was
 originally a semicolonial and semifeudal state and has never undergone a
 stage in which capitalism was fully and independently developed.  As a
 result, social, economic and cultural development were backward.  Although
 the establishment of the socialist system has opened-up a wider channel for
 the development of the productive forces, our country's current level of

 development of productive forces is still rather low.   The elimination of
 the class distinction between the workers and peasants, the distinction
 between the urban and rural areas, the distinction between physical and
 mental labor and other major social distinctions as a result of insufficient
 development of the productive forces can only be realized on the basis of
 achieving a rapid development of the social productive forces and improve-
 ment of the cultural and educational level and political awareness.  Thus
 it is a fairly difficult and lengthy task which is necessary for eliminating
 the system of exploitation and the exploiting class.   It is necessary to
 undergo a long historical development process before we can fulfill this
 historical mission.   Since the development of the social productive forces
 progresses step by step, the historical process of eliminating the dis-
 tinction between workers and peasants, the urban and rural distinction and
 the physical and mental labor distinction inevitably bears the historical
 characteristic of progressing step by step.  As far as the basic content
 and basic orientation of this historical process is concerned, it is a
 process in which the working class transforms the whole society according
 to their own image and is also a process of working-classizing [gong ren
 jie ji hua 1562 0086 7132 4787 0553] all members of the society.  In the
 wake of the gradual improvement of the social productive forces and the
 social cultural and educational level, class distinction and social dis-
 tinctions are gradually reduced, the peasants and other members of the
 society are gradually more closely connected with the workers.  When all
 the members of the society have become working-classized, these distinc-
 tions will be eliminated.  Thus, in this long historical process of
 progressing step by step, the working class gives fuller play to its
 advanced role and its contingent becomes stronger.  All this totally com-
 plies with the laws and with dialectics which governs the development of
 history.
 In our country, it is impossible, in a short time, to eliminate all class
 distinctions and other major social distinctions or to completely eliminate
 the social phenomenon of class struggle from our country's social life.
 To be sure, we have eliminated the system of exploitation, eliminated the
 bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, and have consequently eliminated
 class struggle between the exploiting class and the exploited.  Undoubtedly,
 this is a critical step for the working class in our country in the course
 of fulfilling its historical mission of achieving the elimination of its
 own class, class struggle and class distinctions.  We absolutely cannot
 underestimate its great significance and role,  However, class struggle
 has not completely ceased and it will continue to exist for a long time
 within certain limits in our country's society.  When we say that the
 bourgeoisie has been eliminated in our country, we mean that this class
 has been eliminated on the mainland of our country.  This class still
 exists as a whole exploiting class in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and
 still plays the roles determined by its class interests and class nature.
 Outside the country, the capitalist system and the bourgeoisie still exist.
 Capitalism is an international phenomenon.   Similarly, the existence of the
 working class is also an international phenomenon.   The working class'
 struggle against capitalism is inevitably a class struggle within inter-
 national limits.  Class struggle in a socialist society is related with the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 class struggle within international bounds.  Our socialist modernization
 cause cannot be carried out by closing the country to international inter-
 course, we must adopt and adhere to the open-door policy and, on'the basis
 of upholding the principle of equality and mutual benefit, develop economic,
 trade and cultural intercourse with various countries in the world includ-
 ing many capitalist countries.  Under the circumstances of incessantly
 expanding the situation of being open to foreign countries, the foreign
 bourgeoisie will inevitably and greatly affect, infiltrate and corrupt our
 country's social life.   Thus, the Chinese working class will shoulder
 tougher tasks of struggle in opposing and overcoming such influences,
 infiltration and corruption.  At the same time, due to the fact that the
 semicolonial and semifeudal system in our country has only been overthrown
 for a short time and that the feudal class and the bourgeoisie have only
 been eliminated for a short time, their traces cannot be completely wiped
 out in the wake of their overthrow and elimination.   Because our socialist
 system is still in a stage of initial development, is far from being per-
 fect and well-established and does not have the essential economic, polit-
 ical and social conditions which enable us to completely get rid of the
 hostile elements, there still exist in our society various hostile elements
 who deliberately sabotage and subvert the socialist system.   These hostile
 elements include the small number of former counterrevolutionaries, enemy
 agents, a small number of old exploiting elements who still uphold a
 reactionary stand, certain new counterrevolutionaries, new exploiters who
 are engaged in corruption and theft, speculative activities and smuggling
 and selling of contraband, and those people who jeopardize socialism.  We
 stress that class struggle will continue to exist within certain limits in
 our country, and this class struggle within certain limits mainly means
 the struggle between the people and these hostile elements.  With regard to
 these hostile elements, the working class, peasants and the intellectuals
 must maintain sharp vigilance and must exercise powerful dictatorship over
 them by means of the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship.
 In addition, among the people, due to the influence of the system of
 exploitation and the exploiting class outside socialist society and the
 remnant ideological influence of the exploiting class, bourgeois and non-
 proletarian ideas and deeds such as bourgeois liberalization, anarchism,
 and extreme individualism exist among a certain number of people.  All
 these ideas and deeds contradict the interests of the socialist system,
 the working class and all the people.   Generally speaking, this contradic-
 tion, among various social contradictions of a socialist society, is one
 which embodies the nature of class struggle.  However, it belongs to a kind
 of contradiction among the people.   This contradiction is still very com-
 monly found in our current socialist society.   Thus, it is necessary for
 the working class and the majority of the people to adopt appropriate
 methods, mainly the method of criticism and active ideological struggle,
 to overcome these ideas and deeds so that the contradiction will be
 effectively solved.
 In light of the above analysis, we can clearly see that the Chinese working
 class must still make more arduous efforts and more contributions in order
 to complete its historical journey and fulfill its historical mission of
 eliminating all class struggle phenomena and all class. distinctions within

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 our society.  This will only be achieved in the remote future.  Before the
 completion of the historical journey, the working class as a class will not
 disappear from our country's political and social arena.
 Some comrades do not deny that the working class, as a class, still exists
 in our country.  However, they hold that today's working class is no longer
 the working class in the same sense as before, and that the definitions
 given by Lenin of the working class and other classes no longer apply to
 their modern counterparts.   We do not recognize such a viewpoint as being
 correct.   The working class, like all other things that emerge and finally
 vanish in history, has to undergo a course of development.   In this course,
 it inevitably undergoes changes of some kind.   Following the victories of
 the new democratic revolution and socialist revolution in our country, the
 working class of our country has indeed experienced enormous changes and
 now has a new face and new characteristics.  These changes include the
 change of its status from a ruled class in the past to the ruling class in
 the new society, from wage laborers who did not possess means of production
 in the past to the masters of the new society who own the means of produc-
 tion today; the constant enrichment and development of its inherent.class
 character during the continuous social practice in the new historical
 conditions; and so on.   This is not only the case of the working class.
 The peasantry has also undergone considerable changes, which can be seen
 in the change in its status from a class of small property owners in the
 past to the peasantry which is organized under the system of collective
 ownership in socialist society today, the noticeable improvement of its
 cultural, technical and ideological levels, and so on.   But, in general,
 the working class has not lost its original nature despite these changes.
 And, as a legacy of the class society in history, the class difference
 between the workers and the peasants has not vanished because of these
 changes either; their relations with the means of production are still
 different (the labor of the working class is mainly based on the system of
 ownership by the whole people, while that of the peasantry is mainly linked
 to the system of collective ownership); and their roles in the organization
 of social labor, their concrete forms in the distribution of social revenue
 and social alimony are also different from each other.  These several aspects
 are exactly the basic characteristics which Lenin pointed out in his "A Great
 Beginning" and other articles to distinguish between different classes.
 Therefore, although socialist society, by eliminating the system of private
 ownership of the means of production, has eliminated the demarcation line
 which divided the members of a society into a group of people who owned the
 means of production and another group of people who did not own the means
 of production, every member of society is not completely equal in terms of
 their relationship with the means of production.   Lenin's definition of
 class is by no means completely outdated.   It basically applies to all
 classes in socialist society.  We should interpret the changes, which our
 country's working class has undergone since the victory of the revolution,
 and the abolition of the bourgeoisie as an exploiting class, as inevitable
 phenomena which China's working class, as the rival of China's bourgeoisie,
 working class, had to experience in the long and uncompleted course of its
 emergence, development and withering away.

 In the final analysis, the history of mankind is a history which records the
 production of means of subsistence, and the struggle of the laboring people
 who are the producers of means of subsistence.  This is the basic' viewpoint
 of Marxism on the development of social history.  In our socialist society,
 workers, peasants and intellectuals are the basic force in socialist
 construction, and therefore they play the main roles in historical
 evolution.  Nevertheless, the working class remains the leading force of
 our society, and the most advanced and the best organized class with the
 highest political consciousness.   The reason why our country's working
 class can play a leading role under socialist conditions is, first of all,
 because of its objective status in the system of socialist economic rela-
 tions--most workers are working in enterprises under the system of owner-
 ship by the whole people which is the highest form of socialist ownership,
 and the economy under the control of the ownership by the whole people is
 the leading and decisive factor in our country's national economy.   In the
 second place, it is because our country's working class has been linked to
 socialized mass production since its emergence in history, has stood the
 tests of revolutionary struggle over a long period of time, has obtained
 rich experiences in revolution, and has cultivated a high degree of collec-
 tivist spirit and sense of revolution, organization and discipline.
 Furthermore, in the practice of socialist construction, our country's
 working class has constantly improved its political quality and quality
 in other aspects.   For the above reasons, the leading status and role of
 our country's working class in socialist society is an objective existence
 independent of man's will.  And this status and role of the working class
 will never change even though there are various temporary negative factors
 within the class.
 Of course, our country's working class cannot spontaneously exercise its
 leadership of socialist construction but mainly leads it through the
 activities and work of its vanguard--the CPC.   The party is the force at
 the core leading the socialist cause forward.   The leadership of the work-
 ing class is embodied in the formulation and implementation of the party's
 line, guiding principles and policies; in the political work, organiza-
 tional work and other work of the party; in the education carried out by
 the party for the whole people with the communist ideological system and,
 of course, also in the advanced ideology and exemplary acts of the members
 of the working class which may influence, and thus bring along, the broad
 masses of the people.  Without the party's activities and work, the leader-
 ship of the working class can never be realized since the prerequisite and
 guarantee for exercising such leadership do not then exist.   During the 10
 years of turbulence, in flaunting the banner of the working class as the
 leading class, and in "promoting revolution by discarding the leadership of
 party committees," Lin Biao and the "gang of four" replaced the leadership
 of party committees at various levels with worker propaganda teams.  They
 directly gave orders and thus vigorously distorted and destroyed the
 position and role of the working class in history, and seriously spoiled
 the working class' reputation.   Such pernicious influence left behind by
 them must be thoroughly eliminated.   In order to correctly and effectively
 exercise its own leadership, and to represent the working class' will and
 accomplish the working class' historical mission in a better way, Lhe party

 undoubtedly has to conscientiously attach importance to constantly maintain-
 ing close ties with the working class, unremittingly absorb wisdom and  .
 strength from the working class, and give full play to the advanced role
 of the broad masses of workers in the life of the state and the life of
 society.
 As Lenin pointed out, "The main thing in the doctrine of Marx is that it
 brings out the historic role of the proletariat as the builder of a social-
 ist society."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 2, p 437)  Today, to more
 thoroughly elaborate on the position and role of the working class in the
 construction of our country's socialist modernization in light of our new
 historical conditions and new historical mission after the elimination of
 the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes in our country remains an
 important task in our party's Marxist ideological work. We must conscien-
 tiously redress some wrong viewpoints which, stating that our country's
 working class no longer exists as a class, and so on, do not conform with
 the objective reality in our country and go against Marxism.  Moreover, in
 view of the present situation that the working class' sense of class has
 been worked, we need to adopt various vivid forms to strengthen the correct
 propaganda on the historical position,  the historical mission and advanced
 role of the working class so as to promote the class consciousness of the
 working class, reinforce the sense of class of the working class, arouse
 the sense of glory and sense of responsibility of the working class, and
 thus push ahead with the building of work class contingent.
 Do we mean that the working class should enjoy any privilege when we empha-
 size the working class' leading position and role in socialist social life?
 Of course not.   On the contrary, we just mean that the working class has to
 undertake an arduous historical mission with regard to the future of the
 state, the nation and the people, and with regard to the future of the
 socialist cause.   Acknowledging this historical mission of the working class
 in no way means to play down the role of the people belonging to other
 classes and strata in the socialist. construction.   It is under the party's
 leadership and through firm unity and close cooperation with the whole
 people that the working class will fulfill its historical function and
 unremittingly push ahead the socialist cause.

 ON THE BASIC CHARACTERISTICS AND CONTENTS OF THE DRAFT OF THE REVISED
 CONSTITUTION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 19-25
 [Article by Lu Zhichao [4151 0037 6389]]
 [Text]  After the "Draft of the Revised PRC Constitution" was promulgated,
 the people of all nationalities throughout the country held warm discus-
 sions on it and deemed that this is a fairly good draft of the constitu-
 tion which tallies with the needs of the Chinese people at present and for
 a considerably long time.  In order to do better work in the discussion by
 the entire people on the draft of the constitution and its further revision,
 it is quite .necessary to both. theoretically and politically understand the
 basic characteristics and contents of this draft.
 With the exception of "A Common Program" which was similar to a provisional
 constitution, the 1954 constitution was the first constitution that China
 ever promulgated following the founding of the PRC.  At that time, we were
 in a stage of transition from new democracy to socialism.   Under the
 leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people seized the state power and estab-
 lished-the people's democratic dictatorship, led by the working class and
 based on the alliance of workers and peasants.   However, the socialist
 social system had not yet been set up.  The major tasks of the Chinese
 people were to further consolidate and develop the people's democratic
 system and to realize socialist industrialization and the socialist trans-
 formation of individual farming, the handicrafts and capitalist industry
 and commerce step by step by relying?on this state system.  All these
 matters were fully reflected in the 1954 constitution.  At that time,
 Comrade Mao Zedong said:   "This constitution of ours is a socialist-type
 constitution but is still not yet a socialist constitution in the full
 sense.   It is a constitution for the transitional period." This remark
 summarized the characteristics of the 1954 constitution quite well.  As the
 first constitution after the founding of the PRC, the 1954 constitution
 summed up the long years of experience of the Chinese revolution, affirmed
 the socialist component parts and defined the orientation of building
 socialism.   It was of immediate significance not only at that time but many
 of its basic principles and basic institutions were also of long-tLrm

 significance to our country.  Therefore, it can become the foundation for
 us today to revise the constitution.
 China's socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of
 production was basically completed in 1956.  Since then, the stage for all-
 round socialist construction has begun.  On the one hand, major achieve-
 ments were scored and rich experiences were gained in China's economic and
 political construction and educational, scientific and cultural under-
 takings, and on the other hand, for quite a long time, grave mistakes were
 committed.  In regard to the work of the party and the state, we failed for
 20 years to conscientiously and unswervingly shift the work onto the course
 which takes economic construction as its center.  This was an extremely
 profound lesson.  The aim of revolution is, of course, to liberate the pro-
 ductive forces.   Overthrowing the rule of the reactionaries, establishing
 the state's power of the people's democratic dictatorship, eliminating the
 exploitative system and setting up the socialist system are all aimed at
 removing the obstacles of the development of productive forces.  When the
 obstacles are basically removed, the contradiction between the increasingly
 growing demand by the people for material goods and culture and the back-
 ward social production will naturally become the principal contradiction
 which China has to solve; and in addition, concentrating our efforts on
 developing the social productive forces and carrying out the socialist
 modernization program with economic construction as the center should
 naturally become the main task of the people throughout the nation and the
 focus of work of the party and the state; and all other types of work,
 including the class struggle which is carried out in accordance with actual
 conditions, should center on and serve this main task.  We have taken a
 long roundabout path because of the failure to correctly understand and
 solve this problem, both in theory and practice, and even committed the
 grave error of the "Great Cultural Revolution," an error comprehensive in
 magnitude and protracted in duration.   It was precisely at this stage,
 when,we took a roundabout course and committed errors, that the 1975 con-
 stitution was promulgated.   It reflected China's extremely abnormal polit-
 ical life during the "Great Cultural Revolution."  The basic characteristics
 of this constitution were to affirm the theory on the "basic line," which
 took class struggle as the key link, and on the theory of "continued revo-
 lution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" in a form of fundamental
 law, and affirm the practice of the "Great Cultural Revolution.".  As a
 result, the central task of carrying out economic construction and
 developing the productive forces was squeezed to a much less important
 position.
 The 1978 constitution was formulated shortly after the smashing of the
 Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique.   Owing to historical conditions and
 cognitive restrictions, no fundamental changes were made in the 1975 con-
 stitution (nor in the serious shortcomings).
 The 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee held in December
 1978 put an end to the course that hovered about erroneous theories and
 practice and began the new historical stage which took socialist moderniza-
 tion and the building of a high level of civilization and democracy as the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 fundamental task.   It was only after several years of bringing order out of
 chaos since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, after
 the comprehensive and profound summarization of the basic historical
 experience. since the founding of the PRC--a summarization made at the.6th
 Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and in the situation in
 which not only the focus of work of the party and the state has been
 resolutely-shifted to socialist modernization program but also many major
 reforms have been made in fields such as the systems of economy, politics
 and state leadership--that it is possible for our country to draw up a
 draft of the revised constitution as we have today.
 In short, since the founding of the PRC, we have gone through three stages
 and promulgated four constitutions:   the 1954 constitution, which correctly
 embodied the. characteristics and tasks during the transitional period; the
 1975 and 1978 constitutions, which reflected the faults and errors in our
 guiding ideology; and the new constitution, which is now under discussion
 among the entire people and will be adopted. this year, a constitution
 which correctly embodies the characteristics aad tasks of the new histori-
 cal stage.  History has taken a zigzag road.   Our constitutions are its
 record.
 Today we have gradually embarked on a new and victorious broad road.   A
 road which is clear, definite and correct is stipulated in the draft of
 the revised constitution which is now under discussion.   The basic charac-
 teristics of this draft of the revised constitution are as follows:   First,
 it clearly defines the fundamental task of the Chinese people during the
 new historical stage and the bases, conditions and guarantee for ful-
 filling this.task.   The stipulations concerning the various fields, such
 as the tasks and principles of the economic and political systems and
 education, science and culture should center around and serve this funda-
 mental task.   The fundamental task of the new historical stage is both the
 center of our present work and our long-term goal of struggle.   Therefore,
 the various stipulations of the draft of the revised constitution should
 be suited to China's current actual conditions on the one hand and should
 take China's relatively long-term development prospects into account.
 The principal contradiction and fundamental task of the new historical
 stage will not change for a considerably long historical period.  The new
 constitution which correctly reflects this contradiction and task will also
 certainly contain the characteristic of long-term stability.  Second, it
 has correctly and profoundly summed up historical experience.  This draft
 of the revised constitution was promulgated after we had traversed a long
 course of historical twists and turns.   Therefore it is a crystallization
 of historical experience.   For example, regarding the fundamental task of
 socialist construction, the adherence to the four basic principles, the
 strengthening of the building of socialist democracy and socialist
 legality, the ensuring of the basic rights of citizens and of the insep-
 arability of their rights from their duties, the safeguarding of social
 order and the state's laws and discipline, the reforms. of the systems of
 economy, politics and state leadership and so on, it is impossible to
 formulate them in such a practical and concrete way.   It is also ir??ossible
 for the people to have such a profound understanding of them in a time when

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 the socialist transformation was just basically completed and without the
 following 20-odd years of experiences, both positive and negative, and
 particularly without the lesson of the "Great Cultural Revolution."  That
 is to say, the valuable experience for which hundreds and millions of people
 have paid a high price have now become a long-term constitution for running
 the country well and giving the people peace and security.   Third, it con-
 tinues to affirm the correct principles and systems since the founding of
 the PRC in a new sense.   This draft has inherited and developed the basic
 principles of the 1954 constitution and reserved and reinstated many of
 its stipulations which are still suited to present conditions.  However,
 this draft has enriched and developed the contents of the 1954 constitution
 rather than a simple reservation and revival of the 1954 constitution.  For
 example, the stipulation of the draft on the people's democratic dictator-
 ship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and
 peasants is largely the same as that of the 1954 constitution, but owing
 to the tremendous changes in the class situation in China's society over
 the past 20-odd years, its content has been considerably changed.   Some
 of the stipulations concerning the system of people's congresses and the
 basic freedoms and rights of citizens are also basically and even com-
 pletely the resurrection or revival of the clauses concerned of the 1954
 constitution, but with 20 years and more of experiences full of complica-
 tions, its meaning and the way the people understand it are entirely differ-
 ent from what it was in those years.   It is precisely as one case and is the
 same motto for life.  Its meaning is not at all identical, like the under-
 standing between a juvenile who has not seen much of the world and an adult
 who has experienced the hardships of life.  The draft of the revised con-
 stitution shows that the country and the people are becoming increasingly
 more mature in the course of building socialism.
 By the so-called basic contents, we mean, of course, the several important
 contents which are related to the characteristics and fundamental task of
 the new stage rather than the whole contents and stipulations.  They are
 mainly as follows:
 1.   On the Socialist Economic System and Economic Construction
 The socialist system is the basic system of the PRC.   Its basis is the
 socialist economic system, that is, the socialist relations of production.
 When we say that the socialist system is an advanced system and has tre-
 mendous superiority, this is first because when compared with the old-time
 relations of production, the socialist relations of production are more
 commensurate with the nature of the development of productive forces.   Over
 the 30-odd years since the founding of the PRC, although we failed to bring
 this superiority of the socialist economic system into full play, owing to
 lack of experience and committing repeated errors, there still have been
 innumerable facts proving its superiority and vitality.   Upholding and
 unceasingly perfecting the socialist economic system is an important
 guarantee for us to win victory in the socialist modernization program.
 As the fundamental law of the state, the constitution must contain clear

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 and definite stipulations on the socialist economic system and the prin-
 ciples and policies of the economic construction which are related to the
 socialist economic system.
 The. draft of the revised constitution on the socialist economy contains the
 most concrete and detailed clauses of all the previous constitutions since
 the founding. of the PRC.   From Article 6 to Article 19 of the "General
 Principles," there are 14 stipulations on the socialist economic system and
 the principles and policies of economic construction.   These clauses are a
 summary of the 30-odd years of experiences and lessons and a record of the
 positive achievements of bringing order out of chaos and of the reforms of
 the economic system since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
 Committee.
 Usually, when we talk about the socialist economic system we first refer to
 the aspect of the basic principles of this system, such as the public owner-
 ship of the means of production, the distribution of the personal means of
 subsistence according to work done, the planned economy and so on.  All the
 socialist countries during the whole socialist historical stage are the
 same in this respect.   However, because of the difference in the various
 socioeconomic conditions, and particularly in the situation of the develop-
 ment of productive forces, the socialist economic system in different coun-
 tries or in different historical stages of a country must have different
 concrete forms which are manifested in the various concrete systems and
 policies.   To uphold the socialist economic system and give full play to the
 superiority of the socialist system, we must proceed from actual conditions
 and in light of the situation and requirements of the development of pro-
 ductive forces, create the concrete economic systems which are suited to
 the development of productive forces and carry out the principles and poli-
 cies which are commensurate with the development of productive forces, and
 in addition, with the development of productive forces and the changes in
 the situation, we must constantly transform and perfect these concrete
 systems and policies.   In reviewing the "leftist" errors we committed in
 our previous economic construction, we found that they were by and large
 related to the failure to correctly understand and solve this problem.   For
 example, we imagined a set of fixed development patterns of the socialist
 relations of production by deviating from the actual conditions of the
 development of China's productive forces and we held that the larger the
 scale of public ownership, the more advanced its superiority would be; we
 imposed excessively rigid control on planning and management; in economic
 construction, we overlooked the principle of doing things in light of
 actual conditions and within the limits of our own capabilities; in
 economic activities with other countries, we one-sidedly understood the
 principle of self-reliance and thus emerged a situation in which the coun-
 try was closed to international relations.   Such circumstances were the
 results of the ossified and oversimplified understanding of the socialist
 economic system and economic construction, deviating from China's reality
 and violating the principle that the relations of production must cor-
 respond to the situation and requirements of the development of productive
 forces.  Of course, while correcting these "leftist" errors, if we have
 doubts and take a wavering attitude toward the basic socialist economic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 system, for example, the public ownership of the means of production, the
 planned economy and the centralized and unified leadership of the state
 over the national economy and so on, our attitude is similarly quite wrong.
 Historical experience tells us that on the question of the socialist
 economic system and economic construction, it is necessary to integrate
 well the universal theory of Marxism with the concrete practice of the
 Chinese revolution and to integrate the principle of adhering to the basic
 socialist system with the flexibility of adopting various forms and methods
 in accordance with actual conditions.   Since the 3d Plenary Session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee, our party and state have carried out a policy of
 domestically revitalizing the economy and internationally opening up the
 door to other countries, reformed the economic system and readjusted the
 principles and policies of economic construction.  The aim'of all this is
 to solve the question of this "integration" and to discover appropriate
 forms and a correct path which uphold the socialist road and develop the
 socialist economy under the present conditions of our country.
 The achievements gained both in understanding and practice in this respect
 since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee have been
 fully absorbed in the draft of the revised constitution.   First, on the
 question of the ownership system of the means of production, on the one
 hand, it holds that the basis of the socialist economic system is the
 state sector of the economy, that is, the economy under the ownership
 system owned by the whole people, is the "dominant force in the national
 economy" and that the various forms of the cooperative economy in the
 countryside and the cities and towns constitute a socialist sector of the
 economy collectively owned by the working people.  In particular, an addi-
 tional special clause is added, which stipulates in a relatively clear
 manner that mineral resources, water, forests, mountains, grasslands,
 underdeveloped lands, beaches and other natural resources, seas and land,
 are owned by the state or are collectively owned, thus ensuring the nature
 of the socialist public ownership of these basic and important means of
 production; at the same time, it clearly affirms the principle of "socialist
 public property shall be sacred and inviolable," and in accordance with this
 principle, it stipulates many concrete regulations in the clauses concerned.
 On the other hand, it still affirms that the various forms of the collective
 ownership system are in the cities and the countryside, that the individual
 economy of the urban and rural working people, within limits prescribed by
 law, is a complement to the socialist sector of the economy owned by the
 public, that the right of the peasants who are members of organizations
 of the rural collective economy to farm plots of agricultural and hilly
 land, engage in household sideline production and keep livestock for their
 own needs and affirms the various forms of the socialist responsibility
 system in operations and management, and so on.   Second, on the question
 of the planning and management of the national economy, it clearly stipu-
 lates that the principle of "the state plans of the national economy on
 the basis of socialist public ownership" should be upheld, and at the same
 time, while affirming the supplementary role of regulation by market
 mechanism, it stipulates that "the state ensures the proportionate and
 coordinated development of the national economy through the comprehensive
 balancing of economic plans, with regulation by market mechanism as a

 subsidiary."  In regard to state-run enterprises and collective economic
 organizations, in accordance with their different conditions, on the one
 hand, the draft separately stipulates that they should submit to the
 unified leadership of the state, carry out the state plan or accept the
 planning and guidance of the state and abide by the laws concerned, and
 ,on the other hand, it respectively stipulates the different forms of
 decisionmaking,power gained by the two types of enterprises and the differ-
 ent forms of power of democratic management enjoyed by the working people
 of the enterprises.  Third, on the question of the principles and policies
 of economic construction, it stipulates the aim and means of socialist
 production and the relationship between accumulation and consumption and
 between the state, the collective and the individual, and it affirms the
 principle of gradually improving the livelihood of the people on the basis
 of the development of production.  Fourth, in accordance with the principle
 of developing the economic and technical cooperation with other countries
 on the condition of achieving independence and self-reliance through
 rejuvenation, an additional clause for permitting foreign enterprises or
 foreign individuals to invest in China or carry out various forms of
 economic cooperation in accordance with the provisions of state laws is
 stipulated in the draft, and so on.  All this briefly records the achieve-
 ments and orientation of the reforms of the economic system and the prin-
 ciples and policies of economic construction since the 3d Plenary Session
 of the 11th CPC Central Committee in the form of succinct and precise legal
 articles and thus embodies the integration of principle and flexibility.
 There are still many concrete problems concerning the economic system and
 economic policies which demand further exploration and solutions but the
 basic form and path have been clearly defined.   It is of tremendous and
 long-term significance to the development of China's socialist economy to
 affirm them in the form of the fundamental law of the state.
 2.   On the Building of Socialist Spiritual Civilization
 The development of civilization always includes material and spiritual
 aspects.   Socialist construction undertakings similarly embrace two
 aspects:   One is to develop the economy and create increasingly sophisti-
 cated conditions for material production and more and more material
 products and the other is to develop culture and enhance the ideological
 and moral levels.  After the socialist system has been established, it is
 wrong not to place economic construction as the central task of the people
 all over the country; however, when the focus of the work of the state has
 been shifted to modern economic construction, it will also be wrong not to
 concurrently put the building of socialist spiritual civilization in an
 important position.   This is because without the building of spiritual
 civilization, the people will be ignorant and backward and unable to free
 themselves from the old ideas and old habits which were shaped under the
 exploitative system and the private ownership of the means of production.
 This being the case, it is obvious that it is impossible to accomplish
 socialist modernization and also build a highly advanced material civiliza-
 tion.   Furthermore, as a new social system, socialism must raise the
 socialist and communist political consciousness and moral level of the
 entire people and establish a new-type relationship between man.anu man in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100360001-8
 light of new ideas rather than confining itself to establish new-type
 economic ties and improving material living conditions.  The socialist
 system was, as it should be, founded under the guidance of advanced and
 scientific ideology, and the continued advance of socialist society will
 surely be achieved under the guidance of this advanced ideology, and more-
 over this advanced ideology should be gradually spread among the whole body
 of the members of society.   Otherwise, the socialist system cannot possibly
 develop healthily and there may even emerge a phenomenon of shrinkage and
 retrogression in this respect.  Therefore, the building of socialist
 spiritual civilization is a question of fundamental importance concerning
 the consolidation and development of the socialist system.  The constitu-
 tion during the new historical period has to work out principled stipula-
 tions from various aspects on this question.
 There are two main aspects in the draft of the revised constitution regard-
 ing the contents of spiritual civilization:  One is to develop socialist
 education, science, public health and various cultural undertakings and
 the other is to encourage social virtues and educate the people on the
 ideas and ethics of communism.
 Article 20 in the "General Principles" stipulates in principle the develop-
 ment of such undertakings as education, science and culture.   In particular,
 the following clear stipulations have been drawn up concerning the educa-
 tional system and tasks:   1) Universalize primary education and wipe out
 illiteracy.  This is the prerequisite for raising the whole nation's
 scientific and cultural level.   2) Develop secondary, vocational and.
 higher education.   This involves the question of establishing a rational
 educational structure and helping education suit itself to the require-
 ments of scientific and cultural development and the modernization program.
 3) Promote political, cultural, scientific, technical and professional
 education among the workers, peasants and other working people (Article 41
 still stipulates that necessary vocational training should be provided to
 citizens who have not yet been assigned work).   This is the education for
 adult working people who are at their posts.   It has a bearing on the
 constant improvement of the political and technical quality of people who
 are capable of full-time labor in industry, agriculture and various other
 trades.   4) Promote the spoken Han language for wide use throughout the
 country to facilitate the development of cultural and educational work.
 This is of tremendous significance to the cultural exchange of the various
 regions and various nationalities all over the country and.also one of the
 basic measures for increasing the scientific and cultural level of the
 people throughout the nation.   The above-mentioned matters are all extremely
 important work which should be undertaken for a long period and conscien-
 tiously carried out.  Developing educational undertakings is the basis for
 the whole cultural construction.  Doing a good job in this type of work is
 of great strategic significance to improving the cultural quality of the
 whole nation, to raising the quality of labor of the entire working people
 and to the balanced development of the country's cultural undertakings and
 the unity and prosperity of the country.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 Article 22 of the draft is a stipulation concerning one important aspect of
 socialist spiritual civilization--political consciousness and ideas and
 ethics. This article embraces three contents:  One is to promote the
 virtues of love for the motherland, the people, labor, science .and social-
 ism.                     Listing "loving five things, that is, the motherland, the people,
 labor, science and socialism," which the state promotes as social virtues,
 into the constitution means determining the common codes of conduct for all
 citizens.  The other is to educate the.people in the ideas and ethics of
 patriotism, collectivism, internationalism and communism.  This education
 serves as the consolidation and development of the socialist system which
 'takes the'public ownership of the means of production as the foundation
 and serves as the core of building socialist spiritual civilization.   Still
 another is to oppose the influence of capitalist ideas, the remaining
 feudal ideas and other decadent ideology.  The building of socialist
 spiritual civilization is not carried out in a vacuum.   Putting forth the
 task of such ideological struggle in light of China's domestic conditions
 and international conditions is the important guarantee for building
 socialist spiritual civilization.   In short, the three tasks which comple-
 ment each other and are stipulated in the draft are the program for building
 socialist spiritual civilization in the field of education in ideas and
 ethics.
 The draft has not only formulated programmatic stipulations on the building
 of spiritual civilization but also concretely stipulated the legal codes
 and moral standards which should be followed by the whole citizens in the
 clauses concerned.  For example, they concern the matters of the principle
 that socialist public property shall be sacred and inviolable and the
 various concrete stipulations related to it; of work being a glorious duty
 of every able-bodied citizen and the due attitude toward labor which the
 working people should hold; of the principle that all citizens are equal
 before the law and the various concrete stipulations on equality between
 different nationalities, between man and woman and between citizens' rights
 and duties; of the stipulations that the state functionaries and armed
 forces must serve the people; that the state and society take care of and
 train young people and children, give help to citizens who are old, ill or
 lost their abilities to work, ensure the livelihood of the disabled members
 of the armed forces and help arrange for the livelihood and education of
 handicapped persons; of the requirements for citizens to observe work
 discipline, observe public order and respect social ethics and beneficial
 customs and habits; of the stipulations' that marriage, the family, the
 mother and the child should be protected, that children have the duty to
 support their parents and that maltreatment of old people, women and
 children is prohibited; of the sacred duties of citizens to be duty-bound
 to safeguard the unity of the country and the unity of all nationalities
 and to safeguard the security, honor and the interests of the motherland
 and to defend the motherland and resist aggression.   All this is a new-type
 relationship between man and man and a code-of conduct which are both based
 on the socialist system of public ownership.  The aim of establishing this
 relationship and carrying out this code of conduct is to enable the'people
 throughout the country to become disciplined socialist: citizens with ideas
 and virtues.   Putting these stipulations into the fundamental law of the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 state is first aimed naturally at establishing the people's socialist
 political relationship and legal standards and at the same time aimed at
 establishing the people's socialist ideological belief and moral standards.
 This is because the stipulations in the constitution concerning the new-
 type relationship between man and man which a socialist society should have
 are not only manifested in concrete systems and laws but also should go deep
 into the people's ideology and life and become the codes of conduct which
 the people should abide by.  In order to suit the requirements of the
 modernization program and to perfect the socialist system during the new
 stage, such concrete and clear and definite stipulations on the building
 of spiritual civilization have been formulated.  This is a naked charac-
 teristic of this draft of the revised constitution.
 3.   On the Building of a Highly Democratic Socialist Political System
 The socialist system is not only an economic system but also a political
 system.   The socialist political system which corresponds to the socialist
 public ownership of the means of production and under which the entire
 people enjoy in a political sense the supreme power to administer the
 affairs of the country means the system of the people's democratic dictator-
 ship.   Building a highly democratic socialist political system is the guar-
 antee for accomplishing socialist modernization and building spiritual and
 material civilizations.   Because the socialist cause is an undertaking by
 the whole people, only when we realize in a political sense a high level of
 democracy and practice centralism on the basis of a highly advanced
 democracy, can we ensure the political situation of long-term stability,
 bring the enthusiasm of the broad masses for socialism into full play,
 make a tremendous united force and ensure the smooth development of
 socialist construction.  At the same time, realizing a high degree of
 democracy and fully ensuring the entire people's right of being the masters
 of the country and the legal freedoms and rights of individual citizens
 themselves are also some of the important goals of the Chinese people for
 building socialism.   Therefore, formulating systematic stipulations on
 highly advanced socialist democracy in a way ranging from principle to con-
 crete system is a fundamental requirement of the revision of the constitu-
 tion.
 Highly advanced socialist democracy includes two meanings:   On the one hand,
 in terms of the nature of the state system, socialist democracy, that is,
 the people's democratic dictatorship, indicates the entire people's ruling
 position and their position of being the masters of the country.   This is a
 democracy in which the entire people are the masters of the country and for
 this reason, it is a democracy of a higher degree compared with that of the
 bourgeoisie.   On the other hand, in terms of the various democratic systems
 and democratic life under socialism, we are now far from sufficient in this
 respect and achieving highly advanced democracy still requires a course of
 long-term development.  For this reason, we take the realization of a highly
 advanced democracy as an important task of building socialism.   The two
 meanings we have talked about here are, in fact, the state system and
 political system of a socialist country.   These two meanings are inter-
 related.  Without overthrowing the rule of the reactionary classes and
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 establishing the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class,
 highly advanced democracy is out of the question and any allegations, such
 as "the majority of the people decide" and "the minority should submit to
 the majority," are nothing but empty talk.   So the state power- under the
 people's democratic dictatorship is the prerequisite for achieving highly
 advanced socialist democracy.  However, after the people's democratic
 dictatorship is established, if the building of the highly. democratic polit-
 ical system is not strengthened according to democratic centralism and the
 perfect socialist legality of this system is not displayed, it will be
 impossible to fully ensure that the entire people can exercise their right
 of being the masters of the country.   Therefore, strengthening the building
 of democracy and the legal system is an important condition for upholding
 the. people's democratic dictatorship.   Our previous lessons lie in the
 serious-neglect of the building of various, socialist democratic systems and
 the legal system.   This is precisely one of the important reasons why the
 "Great Cultural Revolution" could come into being.   Since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, while summing up historical
 experiences and lessons, our party has once again stressed the importance
 of realizing highly advanced socialist democracy, and over the years, it
 has. done a lot of work in the reforms of the country's political and
 leadership systems and in the building of the democratic and legal systems,
 thus enabling. China's socialist democracy to revive and greatly develop.
 The profound understanding of realizing highly advanced socialist democracy,
 which we gained from historical experience, and the advances which we
 :achieved in the building of democracy and the legal system find expression
 in a centralized way in the clauses of this draft of the revised constitu-
 tion.   In the "Preamble" of the constitution, the draft takes the building
 of a modern socialist country with a high level of democracy and culture as
 the fundamental task of the people throughout the country in the days to
 come. Article 1 through Article 5 of the "General Principles" stipulate
 the fundamental principles of our country's political system, including
 the state system of the people's democratic dictatorship and the system of
 people's congresses, which are organized according to democratic centralism.
 The stipulations in the chapter on the "Fundamental Rights and Duties of
 Citizens" concerning the freedoms and democratic rights of citizens are
 derived from the principles of socialis.t democracy, which are included in
 the "General Principles."  The chapter on "The Structure of the State" is
 the objective of China's socialist political system--the system of people's
 congresses.   These stipulations stress from many angles the building of
 socialist democracy and socialist legal system.   First, in order to con-
 scientiously ensure that the people can really exercise state power, the
 chapter strengthens the building of the state organs at the various levels,
 in particular the building of the system of people's congresses in
 accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, such as strengthen-
 ing the functions and powers of the National People's Congress and its
 Standing Committee; restoring the post of the state chairman; establishing
 the Central Military Commission, which is responsible to the NPC; raising
 the work efficiency of the administrative organizations; enlarging the
 functions and powers of the State Council and practicing the premier-
 minister responsibility system; strengthening the functions and posers of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 the local people's congresses at the various levels, and so on.  All this
 will enable the state organs to better represent the interests and will of
 the people and better serve the people and to effectively lead and organize
 socialist construction.  Second, in accordance with the principle of social-
 ist democracy, the chapter concretely stipulates the various basic rights
 and duties of citizens and establishes the social political relationship
 between man and man and between the individual citizens on the one hand and
 the state and society on the other; restores, increases and substantiates
 the clauses on the citizens' rights of democracy and freedoms; establishes
 the principle that all citizens are equal before the law and stipulates that
 no organization or individual shall enjoy privileges that transcend the
 constitution and the law; establishes the principle that the rights of citi-
 zens                                                                                                  ?
 are inseparable from their duties, stipulates the duties every citizen
 should observe and that when exercising their freedoms and rights, citizens
 must not infringe upon the interests of the state, society and the collec-
 tive and other legal freedoms and rights of citizens.   This provides legal
 bases to correctly handle the relationship between democracy and centralism,
 between freedom and discipline and between rights and duties in accordance
 with the principle of democracy.  Third, except for the exercising of state
 power through people's congresses, the chapter on the "General Principles"
 stiuplates that "the people have the right to administer the affairs of the
 country and its economic, cultural and social affairs, according to the
 provisions of the law, through various channels and in various forms."  In
 keeping with this, separate stipulations are made on the right of citizens
 to make criticisms of and proposals to any state organ or any department
 therein and on their rights to supervise; the right of workers in the
 state-run enterprises and in units of the collective economy, urban or
 rural, to take part in or exercise democratic management, and of the right
 of the residents in urban and rural areas to practice autonomy of a mass
 character, and so on.   This enlarges socialist democracy in the various
 fields, such as the political, economic, cultural and social life of the
 people all over the country.   Fourth, the principles of socialist legality
 are established.   The chapter on the "General Principles" clearly stipulates
 that "the state upholds the uniformity and dignity of the socialist legal
 system" and "all state organs and people's armed forces, all political
 parties and public organizations and all enterprises must abide by the
 constitution and the law."  This provides a constitutional and legal guaran-
 tee for the institutionalization of socialist democracy.   The new constitu-
 tion itself is the supreme legal basis for the institutionalization and
 legalization of social democracy.   It will play a tremendous role in build-
 ing the socialist political system with a high level of democracy.                   ?

 STRENGTHEN THE GREAT UNITY OF ALL NATIONALITIES
 Beijing RED.FLAG in Chinese No. 16, 16 Aug,82 pp 26-31
 [Article by Ismail Amat]
 [Text]  The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party
 Since the Founding of the PRC" approved by.theparty's sixth plenary
 session pointed out:   "It is of profound significance to our multinational
 country to improve socialist relations among our various nationalities and
 strengthen national unity."  More than 30 years' history in Xinjiang has
 proved that, under the leadership of the.CP.C Central Committee, people of
 all nationalities should strengthen unity and march in unison in the great
 socialist family of the motherland.   This constitutes an important guaran-
 tee for the cause of opposing hegemonism,, consolidating the unification of
 the motherland, promoting the common prosperity of the various nationali-
 ties and smoothly carrying out the socialist modernization program.
 Our great motherland has been a multinational state since ancient times.
 The Chinese nation, including Han and other minority nationalities, is an
 entity.  Although in history splits and disunity have occurred on many
 occasions among the various nationalities, they have been only temporary
 phenomena while unification has always been-the main aspect of China's
 historical development.   Chinese history of the past thousands of years
 is one of founding and defending the motherland-by the people of various
 nationalities who are interdependent and are. inseparable from one another.
 It is a history of the people of various nationalities who live in compact
 societies and who get along well with, and help, one another.  Xinjiang,
 like all other minority nationality autonomous regions in our country, is
 an integral part of the great motherland.  As early as 2,000 years ago,
 the Western Han dynasty exercised its sovereignty over Xinjiang by setting
 up administrative organs.   In the past 2,000 years and more, the people of
 various nationalities in Xinjiang and the Han people have drawn on each
 other's experiences in politics, economics and culture.   This has vigor-
 ously promoted economic development and enriched the cultural treasure
 house of the motherland.  In the course of historical developments, the
 various minority nationalities have introduced from the Han region advanced
 production tools and techniques and thus promoted the economic anc: cultural

 development of the border region.  The Han people have also introduced
 from the minority nationalities particular strains of crops and cultivation
 techniques nonexistent in many areas of the central plains and thus pro-
 moted the agricultural development of the central plains.  The people of
 Xinjiang consist of 13 nationalities including the Uygur, Han, Kazak,
 Monggol, Hui, Kirgiz, Xibo and Tazik.   They have been working hard to build
 up and defend this beautiful and richly endowed border region of the mother-
 land.  Many outstanding political, military, scientific and literary and
 artistic personages from various nationalities in Xinjiang have made great
 efforts to safeguard the unification of the motherland and the unity of all
 nationalities and, with their outstanding talents, greatly contributed to
 the higher education and culture of the motherland.  A large number of
 artifacts that have been uncovered in Xinjiang over the years, such as
 ancient books, documents, contracts, letters and inscriptions on tombs,
 bear witness to the historical fact that, since ancient times, the people
 of various nationalities in Xinjiang have closely united with, and got
 along well with, the Han people.
 In the struggles against imperialism and feudalism, the people of all
 nationalities in Xinjiang were united as one and fought side by side.  They
 fought heroically and unremittingly against invaders from czarist Russia
 and the feudal rule of the Qing dynasty and performed many moving deeds.
 The common cause of defending territorial integrity and national unity
 against national split and exploitation and oppression by the reactionary
 ruling classes have bound the people of all nationalities tightly together.
 They depend on one another for survival and are inseparable.   Especially
 during the new democratic revolution,  the people of all nationalities in
 Xinjiang, under the leadership of the CPC, set off a mighty revolutionary
 movement.  As early as 1933, the CPC successively sent party members to
 Xinjiang to engage in revolutionary work.   In 1939, it again sent Comrade
 Chen Tanqiu, a member of the CPC Central Committee, to serve as a party
 representative in Xinjiang.   Together with Mao Zemin and many other com-
 rades, he spread Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought in Xinjiang and pointed
 out to the people of all nationalities the correct way to revolutionary
 struggle.  With their outstanding work, the Chinese communists in Xinjiang
 managed to awaken the people of all nationalities who had suffered for a
 long time under the reactionary rule of the warlords and the KMT.   The
 revolution that broke out in the three prefectures of Ili, Tacheng and
 Altay in the autumn of 1944 dealt a telling blow to the KMT reactionary
 rule.   This was an integral part of the people's democratic revolution
 throughout the country.   Exemplary communists, including Comrades Chen
 Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, Lin Jilu and Qiao Guozhen remained staunch and
 indomitable in the enemy's prison and were murdered in cold blood.   They
 dedicated their precious lives to the revolutionary cause of all nationali-
 ties in Xinjiang.  Their revolutionary spirit of complete dedication and
 wholehearted service to the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang will
 always be remembered by the people in Xinjiang.
 In the early postliberation period, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's
 instructions on marching into Xinjiang, stationing troops to open up the
 wasteland and defend the border and doing more good for the people of all

 nationalities, Comrades Wang Zhen and Wang Enmao marched into Xinjiang at
 the head of their troops.  A large number of Han cadres enthusiastically
 answered the call of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong and
 came to Xinjiang from various localities thousands of li away.  Later, the
 CPC Central Committee again transferred and-dispatched a large number of
 cadres and scientific and technical personnel of the-Han nationality to
 Xinjiang.  Most of these Han cadres, whether they came at an. earlier or
 later date, were diligent and conscientious in serving the people of all
 nationalities in Xinjiang.   Shouldering heavy responsibilities on various
 fronts, they modestly learned from the cadres and masses of minority
 nationalities, conscientiously implemented the party's policy toward
 nationalities, respected the customs and habits of minority nationalities,
 were as-dear to the minority nationality cadres as. members of their family
 and fought-side by side with them.  They have done a lot of good deeds for
 the people of all nationalities and have made tremendous contributions in
 the great struggle to defend and build up the border region.  Many veteran
 cadres working in Xinjiang, who had experienced the agrarian revolution,
 the 25,000-li Long March, the war of resistance against Japan and the
 liberation war and who had gone through all kinds of hardships and difficul-
 ties by fighting north and south on many fronts, consistently keep and carry
 .forward the glorious traditions of hard work and plain living and the
 Nanniwan spirit and devote all their energy to the-cause.of building up the
 border region.   They are cadres with relatively high political conscious-
 with a work style of arduous struggle, with practical experience in
 building up the border region and with rich experience in national work.
 They are familiar with Xinjiang's natural conditions and have a profound
 feeling for the people of minority nationalities.  They have set an example
 for the cadres of various nationalities to learn from.  In the protracted
 struggle to build up and defend the border region, not only have they
 painstakingly and loyally led the people of various nationalities in over-
 coming difficulties and winning fresh victories in both construction and
 revolution, they have also,'with a high degree of political enthusiasm and
 patience,- helped a large number of minority nationality cadres to reach
 maturity.  At present, quite a few minority nationality cadres who are in-
 leading positions in the various departments of our region, including
 myself, have grown up with the solicitude and cultivation of the party and
 with the help of Han cadres.  According to statistics, in 1949 there were
 only more than 3,000 minority nationality cadres throughout the region, but
 in 1981, the number increased by 51.95 times, to more than 158,800 minority
 nationality cadres throughout the region.   In 1950 there were only 460
 professional and technical cadres of minority nationalities throughout the
 region, but, in 1981, there.were more than-44,700 persons, an increase of
 96.17 times.   With the education of the party, the numerous minority
 nationality cadres have gradually heightened their political consciousness,
 working ability and cultural and technical levels.  They love the party,
 the motherland and socialism, are familiar with the past and present con-
 ditions of their nationalities, understand the sentiments, habits and
 special characteristics of the people of minority nationalities and have
 a close link with the masses of people in the localities.  These cadres
 include veteran comrades from the-revolution in Ili, Tacheng and Altay and
 middle-aged and young cadres who grew up after liberation in the c,)urse of

 revolution and construction.  At their own respective posts, they study
 assiduously, work hard and maintain close links with the masses, thus
 winning the praise of the party and the people of the various nationalities.
 In the difficult years of pioneering work in production and construction,
 the minority nationality cadres throughout the region, along with the Han
 cadres, shared weal and woe.  They supported and made allowances for each
 other and, united as one, marched forward hand in hand.   The growth of many
 Han cadres is also inseparable from the enthusiastic help of minority
 nationality cadres.
 Facts have fully proved that since the existence of recorded history,
 Xinjiang has always been a component part of the history of our motherland.
 Over the years, the minority nationalities and Han people in Xinjiang have
 been working and fighting in this beautiful and richly endowed land.  Han
 people have helped the minority nationalities; the minority nationalities
 have also helped Han people.
 Bound by a common cause, the various nationalities are as close as flesh
 and blood and live amicably and inseparably together like members of one
 family.   We must certainly cherish the glorious history of the motherland
 and inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of unity and friend-
 ship among all nationalities.
 In his article "Certain Questions in China's Policy Toward Nationalities,"
 Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out:   "Our socialist state is aimed at mod-
 ernizing all fraternal nationality regions and autonomous regions.  The
 modernization of the whole country must be achieved in an all-round way.
 We should have this spirit, a spirit of genuine equality and friendship in
 this great family of nationalities.  We should not let the backward areas
 remain backward forever.  If we do, we are creating inequality; and, this
 is a mistake."  Strengthening the great unity of the people of all
 nationalities is precisely the requirement for realizing socialist
 modernization.
 The motherland's modernization program is closely linked with the common
 prosperity of various nationalities.   The social and economic structures
 of the various nationalities in our country are extremely uneven in their
 development.   Generally speaking, economy and culture develop quite
 speedily in the Han region while in the outlying regions where the minority
 nationalities live in compact communities, due to some natural conditions
 and historical causes, the social, economic and cultural developments are
 rather slow.   Without the leadership and help of the party and state and
 without the vigorous support of fraternal provinces, municipalities and
 autonomous regions in manpower and in material and financial resources, it
 would be impossible for the nationalities which are rather backward polit-
 ically, economically and culturally to speedily get 'rid of their backward-
 ness and catch up with the advanced regions.  This has been proved in the
 past and will continue to be proved in the future.

 In-the past 30. years and more, the cadres and-masses of various nationali-
 ties in Xinjiang, with the solicitude of-the CPC Central Committee and the
 support of relevant state departments and fraternal provinces, municipali-
 ties and autonomous regions, have made common efforts. and engaged in
 arduous: struggle.  They have achieved great. successes:in various under-
 takings,, bringing about earthshaking changes to the north and south of the
 Tianshan Mountains.   In the early postliberation period, the region had only
 a?dozen or so small, poorly equipped factories or workshops and access to
 the,;reg?ion was.,very difficult.  Now, relatively modern industrial enter-
 prises--including iron and steel, machine building, coal, power, petroleum,
 chemical, cement, nonferrous metal, textile; paper and sugar making--have
 been built.  We are more than self-sufficient in some products.  We have
 not only supported the state and some fraternal provinces and regions but
 also sold products abroad.  In 1981, the region's total industrial output
 value was 45?.25 times the 1949 figure; total output value of agriculture and
 animal husbandry was 5.33 times the 1949 figure.   Of these, total grain
 output was 4.6 times the figure of the early'postliberation period while
 the number of livestock was 2.72 times the figure of the early post-
 liberation period.  The region's industrial avid agricultural output value
 is increasing at an average progressive rate, of 7.8 percent every year.
 The communications network, consisting of railways, highways and civil
 aviation, links up all parts of the region.  With the development in pro-
 duction, financial revenue has constantly.. increased.   Cultural, educational,
 sanitation, scientific and technological undertakings are thriving and the
 material and cultural life of the people of various nationalities has
 greatly improved compared with the early postliberation period.   Before
 liberation there was only 1 small college with 185 students; now the region
 has 12 universities and colleges with nearly 8,000 minority nationality
 students.  The number of secondary and primary school pupils has increased
 still more.  In 1949 there were only 48?small hospitals while now the
 region has 903 hospitals, 17.8 times the 1949 figure.  Scientific research
 institutes and technological departments can be found all over the region
 and a large number of middle and high-level scientific and technical person-
 nel of various nationalities are emerging on various fronts.   However, we
 should also soberly note that although we have achieved great successes and
 attained fairly great developments in the economic and cultural construction
 of our region, we still lag far behind the advanced fraternal provinces and
 regions.  We still fall short of the requirements of the four modernizations
 by a greater margin.   These facts conclusively show that in developing and
 building up Xinjiang, not only did we need in the past the strong leader-
 ship and vigorous support of the state and the enthusiastic help of the
 cadres and scientific and technical personnel of fraternal nationalities
 in the hinterland, but we also need them now and shall still need them in
 the future.
 Naturally, help between various nationalities in our country has always
 been mutual.   The minority nationalities need the help of Han people and
 vice versa.   This has been decided by the interests of the party, state
 and nation and the long-range goal of communism.  Achieving socialist
 modernization is the common goal of struggle for the people of all .
 nationalities.   This constitutes a basis for further strengthening the

 great unity of the people of all nationalities.  The minority nationalities
 in our country have relatively sparse population but they are scattered
 over vast regions.  There are abundant resources and hidden treasures in
 these regions.  Due to different weather and natural conditions, there are
 great varieties of agricultural crops that can be developed and we enjoy
 exceptional advantages in some products.  In animal husbandry, all the
 five great natural pasture grounds in our country are situated in the
 minority nationality regions, where there are also abundant forestry
 resources.  There is still a greater potential for developing mineral
 resources.  Xinjiang is a valuable place where there is vast territory and
 abundant resources and where development and construction is urgently needed.
 It also plays an important role in promoting the four modernizations of the
 motherland.  The four modernizations desperately need the active support and
 participation of the people of all nationalities.  Only by making concerted
 efforts and making up for each other's deficiencies will it be possible for
 the people of all nationalities to build a modern socialist motherland and
 achieve common prosperity for the people of all nationalities.  The cadres
 and masses of our various nationalities must proceed from the viewpoint that
 the four modernizations program has a direct bearing on the fundamental
 interests of the people of all nationalities and conscientiously safeguard
 and strengthen the great unity among the various nationalities.
 Xinjiang is an important strategic place for national defense in the
 western part of our country.  The CPC Central Committee and the leading
 comrades of the central authorities have issued a series of important
 instructions on work in Xinjiang.  A very important aspect of these
 instructions is that, in thinking and working, the cadres and masses of
 all nationalities should proceed from the overall situation of unity
 against hegemonism and of strengthening border defense, and strengthen
 unity between the army and the government and unity between the army and
 people in order to genuinely build Xinjiang into a powerful fighting force.
 In the protracted struggle of building and defending the border region and
 in the struggle to oppose the aggressive, subversive and sabotage activities
 of hegemonism, the people and cadres of all nationalities, the staff and
 workers of the production and construction corps, police cadres and militia-
 men unite closely and fight side by side with the commanders and fighters of
 the PLA units stationed in Xinjiang.  They are as close as fish and water
 and have cemented ties of deep friendship.   The people of all nationalities
 in Xinjiang will always remember the difficult years in the early post-
 liberation period when the PLA units stationed in Xinjiang, carrying forward
 the glorious traditions of being a fighting force, working force and produc-
 tion force, suppressed bandits, opposed local despots and engaged in
 democratic reforms together with the cadres and masses of minority
 nationalities; they developed production by opening up wasteland and carry-
 ing out farming; they lived frugally and set up iron and steel, textile,
 machine building and many other factories through self-reliance, thus
 laying a foundation for Xinjiang's industrial construction.   In the social-
 ist revolution and construction period, the commanders and fighters of the
 PLA units stationed in Xinjiang, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit
 of "fearing neither hardship nor death," facing blizzards, eating in the

 wind and sleeping in the dew, have guarded the frontiers of the motherland
 with high vigilance.  They have strengthened the army-civilian joint defense
 and helped the people with their production.  Wherever conditions are the
 hardest and most dangerous, there you are sure to find the people's own
 army. They have done a lot of good deeds for the people of all nationalities
 and managed to foil the hegemonists' scheme of aggression; they leave no
 opening for a handful of foreign and domestic enemies to exploit.  The
 people's army love the people and the people love the liberation army.  In
 the past 30 years and more, the cadres and masses of all nationalities in
 Xinjiang have regarded the difficulties of the people's own army as their
 own and, in manpower and material resources, have actively helped the PLA
 successfully fulfill the tasks of defending and building up the border area.
 Now, whether in the rural areas or grasslands, whether in the army barracks
 or at sentry posts, the stories of supporting the army and cherishing the
 people and of unity between the army and people and between the army and
 government are being widely circulated.   The western frontier defense of the
 motherland is more consolidated and the wall of army-civilian joint defense
 is indestructible.
 Comrade Mao Zedong said:   "One of the reasons why the imperialists dared to
 bully China in the past was because the various nationalities in China were
 disunited.   However, this era has passed forever.   Since the founding of
 the PRC, the various nationalities in China have united into a great family
 of friendship and cooperation.  This is sufficient to vanquish any imperial-
 ist aggression and to build our motherland into a prosperous and powerful
 country."  Now, the hegemonists are threatening our country and are employ-
 ing various means to carry out subversive and sabotage activities in
 Xinjiang in a vain attempt to split our country.  A handful of domestic
 enemies are also engaged in the criminal activities of undermining national
 unity and splitting the unification of the motherland by every possible
 means.  The people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, cadres at various
 levels, commanders and fighters of PLA units stationed in Xinjiang, the
 staff and workers of the production and construction corps, police cadres
 and the militiamen should'greatly heighten their vigilance against the
 enemy.  The more the enemies fear our unity, the more closely should we
 unite.  We should also make all preparations and struggle against foreign
 and domestic, overt and covert enemies that undermine our national unity
 and split the unification of the motherland.  We should guard well the
 western gate of the motherland with one heart and one mind and achieve a
 still greater victory in building and defending the border region.
 In Xinjiang, both historical experiences and the tasks confronting us demand
 that, in considering every problem and doing any work, we must attach great
 importance to national unity.  All our tasks must be subservient to unity,
 which constitutes an overall situation.   If we neglect or forget this over-
 all situation, we will be committing a big mistake.
 The key to strengthening unity among all nationalities lies in the correct
 implementation of the nationalities policy of the party and in the consoli-
 dation and strengthening of regional. national autonomy.   The party's policy
 on. regional national autonomy is the party's basic policy for solving

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 national problems.  In the course of long history, the Han people and the
 minority nationalities as well as the various minority nationalities them-
 selves have lived and mixed in compact communities.  Most of the minority
 nationalities live in small compact communities over vast regions.  There-
 fore, in most autonomous regions, the "nationalities that practice
 autonomy" do not command a majority.  This is a special feature of the
 regional national autonomy in our country and is particularly advantageous
 to the development of socialist national relationship.  Our country's
 policy on regional national autonomy has affirmed the rights of the
 minority nationalities to become the masters of their own affairs.  It              ?
 ensures that the various minority nationality regions, under the unified
 leadership of the central authorities and the leading bodies at a higher
 level, have the right to modify the policies of the party and the state
 to suit their special conditions.  Efforts should be made to help these
 regions develop their own economy and culture, to respect the minority
 written and spoken languages, customs and habits, to train and select
 cadres from among minority people and to bring their role into full play.
 However, this policy should not be misunderstood to mean that the Han cadres
 are not needed or that cultural, educational, scientific and technical
 personnel and masses of the Han nationality are not needed.  It should be
 pointed out that, due to serious interference and sabotage by Lin Biao and
 the "gang of four," some people have a vague idea of the party's policy
 toward nationalities.  Especially among the large number of youths that
 have grown up recently, we have not conducted a good education on the
 Marxist viewpoint on nationalities and the party's policy toward nationali-
 ties.  This merits our particular attention.  To this end, we should con-
 scientiously and frequently conduct publicity and education among the
 minority cadres on the party's policy toward nationalities and on national
 unity so.that the minority cadres can penetratingly study Marxist national
 theory and foster a Marxist viewpoint on nationalities.  It is necessary
 to improve party work style and strengthen party spirit.   In order to do a
 good job of inner-party democracy and promote, through this, the great unity
 of the people of all nationalities, it is necessary to wage struggles,
 through criticism and self-criticism, particularly through opposing and
 rectifying the erroneous tendencies and national prejudice within the party
 on the national question, against the ideas and acts that run counter to
 the party's national policy and the principles of party spirit.
 Comrade Hu Yaobang once pointed out:   The Han cadres and cadres of minority
 nationalities should be united.  They cannot be divorced from each other.
 Our cadres of all nationalities, especially leading cadres at various
 levels, must set examples with their own conduct and take the lead in
 promoting unity among cadres and the masses of all nationalities.   Both Han
 cadres and cadres of other nationalities should not say anything harmful or
 do anything detrimental to unity.  Criticism and self-criticism must be held
 often among cadres of all nationalities and heart-to-heart talks must be
 encouraged among them so that they will be really able to have mutual
 affinity, show utter devotion toward each other, and value the interests of
 the party and the people above everything else.   In handling problems
 involving relations between nationalities, we must be firmly convinced that
 the great majority of cadres and the masses of every nationality uphold the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 leadership of the party, love the socialist motherland and safeguard national
 unity.   Those who disrupt national unity and whip up national split are only
 a -few bad elements.  We should never waver in this firm conviction.  If the
 conviction wavers, we will commit.'dreadful mistakes.  In viewing any dispute
 or problem between one or two individuals of Han nationality and a minority
 nationality,'cadres of all nationalities must make a concrete analysis in
 line with the spirit of seeking truth from facts.  A problem should be
 determined by its real nature.  The problems of a certain person should,not
 involve others.  Problems of one individual should not be termed as a prob-
 lem of one nationality.  Bad elements who provoke incidents and disturbances
 and disrupt national unity must be dealt with according to law and must be
 handled strictly regardless of nationality.  A solid unity among people of
 all nationalities can be ensured only when ideology is unified, relations
 improved and unity strengthened among cadres of all nationalities.  This has
 been repeatedly proved by practice and the experience of many localities
 and departments in our region.
 In order to further enhance unity among the .people of all nationalities,
 the regional CPC committee and people's government have called on the party'
 organizations and government departments at all levels to attach primary
 importance to cementing the unity of all nationalities, especially the unity
 of cadres of all nationalities.  Leading cadres at all levels should pay
 attention to the work on national unity while giving instructions for
 assigning work of other fields, and while examining and summing up work of
 other fields.   In places like our Xinjiang, relations among nationalities
 and unity should be considered as major criteria in measuring the work in
 one district, one department and one unit and the work of one leading cadre.
 Safeguarding national unity should be considered as one of the essential
 aspects while assessing and promoting cadres of all nationalities.  We must
 make further efforts to implement the policies of the party and thoroughly
 redress all unjust verdicts, false charges and mishandled cases. so as to
 properly handle all pending problems.  National unity should be taken as one
 of the important aspects in building spiritual civilization.  Education on
 the policy toward nationalities and national unity should be once again
 stressed extensively and penetratingly throughout the region.   It should
 spread into every department and every unit of the party, government, mili-
 tary, civilian and educational organizations..  Courses on policy toward
 nationalities and national unity should be established in kindergartens,
 primary schools, middle schools and universities. The party's policy
 toward nationalities should be made known to every household, striking root
 in the hearts of the people.  Departments in charge of historical science,
 literature and art, press, publication, radio and television should make
 much of national unity, publicize the great significance of enhancing
 national unity, building and safeguarding the frontier region and commend
 stirring deeds relating to national unity and unity between the army and
 the people so that a new situation in which everybody pays attention to
 and safeguards national unity will appear.
 Engels once pointed out:  "Only the proletarians can cease the state of
 estrangement among all nationalities, and only the awakening proletariat
 can foster fraternal affection among all nationalities."  ("Collected Works

 of Marx and Engels," Vol 2, p 666)  Before liberation, national oppression
 existed in China; but all nationalities were also oppressed by imperialism,
 so they were oppressed nations too.  As a result of imperialist aggression
 and oppression, all Chinese nations came to realize from their common
 sufferings that they had to unite and struggle against imperialism and its
 lackeys.  Through protracted struggle under the leadership of the CPC, at
 long last they achieved victory in revolution, with the founding of the
 People's Republic of China under a united flag of all nationalities and
 embarking on the road of socialism.  The founding of new China discarded a
 system of national oppression which had lasted over thousands of years and
 opened up a new era of national equality and unity in our country.  Under
 the leadership of the CPC, the people of all nationalities have established
 a new style socialist relationship of unity and friendship. Like the people
 of all nationalities in other provinces, municipalities and autonomous
 regions of our country, the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang consti-
 tute, too, a major member of the big socialist community of the motherland
 and share the right of equality in managing state affairs.  Cadres and the
 masses of all nationalities in our region should greatly treasure the right.
 Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and under the brilliance
 of the light of the party's policy toward nationalities, they will work hard
 for enhancing national unity, safeguarding the frontier regions of the
 motherland and protecting the integrity of the motherland.  And they will
 work hard for the common development and prosperity of all nationalities
 and for the realization of communism--a common goal of all nationalities.

 SEVERAL PROBLEMS CONCERNING THE CURRENT RATIO BETWEEN ACCUMULATION AND
 CONSUMPTION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 32-36
 [Article by Chen Feizhang [7115 2431 4545] and Jiang Zhenyun [5592 2182

 [Text]  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 1.1th CPC Central Committee the
 whole party has conscientiously summed up the experiences and lessons in
 economic construction and clearly seen that the practice of high accumula-
 tion rate and low consumption which we adopted for years in the past should
 by no means be allowed to continue.   The CPC and the government have adopted
 a series of measures and strived to solve the problems in this respect.  At
 present, what is the ratio between accumulation and consumption?  What
 problems remain unsolved?  These questions have aroused the extensive
 attention and concern of the people.  Here we are going to discuss our
 understanding of these questions.
 In 1979, the CPC Central Committee decided to readjust the national economy.
 One important decision was to adjust the ratio between accumulation and
 consumption funds in the distribution of national income and to gradually
 reduce the accumulation rate.  Through several years of efforts, remarkable
 achievements have been scored.
 First, in accordance with the principle of doing things within the limits
 of our capabilities, we have reduced the accumulation funds, mainly the
 scope of capital construction and correspondingly increased the expenditure
 on consumption funds.  In 1978, the accumulation rate had reached-36.5 per-
 cent, the third highest since the founding of the PRC following that in
 1959 and 1960.  After  readjustment, the accumulation rate has decreased
 year after year and it dropped to 28.3 percent.in 1981.
 Second, in-the distribution of accumulation funds, spending of a production
 nature has been gradually reduced, while spending of a nonproduction nature
 has been considerably increased, thus initially putting an end to the
 longstanding situation in which the "bones" and the "flesh" were not suited
 to each other.  Of the total investment in capital construction in 1981, the

 proportion of a production nature used for enlarging reproduction fell to
 58.8 percent from 82.6 percent in 1978 and the proportion of a nonproduction
 nature used for satisfying the people's material and cultural needs rose
 from 17.4 percent to 41.2 percent.  The aggregate sum of investment spent by
 the state on nonproduction construction in the last 3 years was equal to
 140 percent of the total sum of investment spent during the decade-long
 "Great Cultural Revolution," or 54 percent of the total sum of investment
 spent during the 29 years between 1950 and 1978.  Of the investment in non-
 production construction in 1981, the proportion for  housing alone rose from
 7.8 percent in 1979 to 25.5 percent.  The aggregate sum of investment spent
 by the state over the last 3 years on the construction of houses in the
 cities and towns was 29.1 billion yuan.  The floorspace of newly completed
 houses totaled 223 million square meters and the average annual increase
 was more than 74 million square meters or more than 300 percent of the
 total average floorspace completed annually during the 10 years of the
 "Great Cultural Revolution."
 Third, in the distribution of production construction investment, the ratio
 between light and heavy industry has also been readjusted.  The proportion
 going to light industry rose from 6.1 percent in 1978 to 10 percent in 1981,
 while that going to heavy industry fell from 50.9 percent to 40.3 percent.
 The above-mentioned adjustment of the ratio between accumulation and con-
 sumption has improved the life of both urban and rural people remarkably
 in all aspects.
 First, let us start with the 800 million peasants.  The further implementa-
 tion of the rural economic policies and the rapid development of agricul-
 tural production was the fundamental guarantee for the improved livelihood
 of the peasants.  However, what must not be ignored is that the state has
 given more money to the peasants through the redistribution of national
 income.  The rise in state purchasing prices of some farm produce and side-
 line products, coupled with the practice of paying more for production in
 excess of the quota, has cost the state 48.1 billion yuan in the last 3
 years.  This sum of money has become the income of the peasants.  During
 this period, the state has still adopted the measures of reducing or
 remitting part of rural taxation, which cost it 7.8 billion yuan.  That is
 to say, these two-things combined have meant a gain in income of 55.9
 billion yuan for the peasants, an average of 70 yuan each.  According to the
 State Statistics Bureau's sample survey of 28 provinces, municipalities and
 regions, the average per capita increase in the peasants' net income added
 up over the last 3 years was 89 yuan, equivalent to 220 percent of the
 increase in income achieved during the 20 years between 1957 and 1976.
 Again according to a "survey of 100 villages" conducted by the former
 State Agricultural Commission in March this year in 27 provinces, munici-
 palities and regions, the number of villages where the livelihood of the
 peasants has been improved or remarkably improved constituted 95 percent
 of the total.
 Next, let us have a look at the living standards of the residents in cities
 and towns.  Over the last 3 years, most staff and workers have seen their

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 wages rise, with some going up one grade and others up two grades.  With
 more than 26 million people employed, the widespread implementation of the
 bonus system among enterprises and undertakings, and staff and workers
 receiving subsidies to compensate for nonstaple food price increases, the
 total wages of the staff and workers throughout the country in 1981 were
 44 percent more than in 1978 and the average increase in the wages of the
 staff and workers was 25.7 percent.  The average staff member or worker's
 wage has still registered ,an increase of 12 percent over the figure for
 1978, after taking into account the factor that the prices for some com-
 modities have risen in varying degrees during this period.  The population
 which every employee had to support (excluding the employee himself)
 dropped from 1.06 people in 1978 to 0.77 people in 1981.
 There are two pronounced indications of the improvement of the living
 standards of the urban and rural population.  One is the substantial
 increase in total sales of consumer goods, with the figure for 1981 being
 60.4 percent higher than in 1978.  New changes have taken place in the
 structure of.consumption.  In the consumption of the families of staff and
 workers in cities and towns, more and more people are tending to buy medium-
 and high-grade commodities and durable consumer goods.   By the end of 1981,
 every 100 staff and worker families had 58 TV sets, 70 sewing machines and
 100 radios, or they increased by 320 percent, 32 percent and 61.2 percent
 respectively compared to 1978.   In the consumption of the peasants, besides
 improving the quality of their food and clothing, the peasants need larger
 quantities of durable consumer goods.  Particularly in housing, in some
 communes and their subdivisions with high incomes, almost every family has
 built a new house.  According to incomplete statistics, over the last 3
 years, the floorspace of housing built by commune members throughout the
 nation themselves was about 1.4 billion square meters.   The current housing
 floorspace of every rural resident is, on the average, nearly 10 square
 meters.   The other is the big increase in the amount of savings deposits.
 The remaining sum of the savings deposits of the urban and rural popula-
 tion in 1981 reached 52.4 billion yuan, an increase of 150 percent over
 1978.
 The above-mentioned facts have irrefutably shown that the living standards
 of urban and rural people have indeed improved.  In addition, in the short
 space of 3 years, fairly big advances were made in improving the people's
 well-being.  This was scored through the great determination and efforts
 exerted by the party and the government.   It is also a great achievement
 gained in readjusting the ratio between accumulation and consumption.
 Over the last few years, new problems concerning the ratio between accumu-
 lation and consumption have arisen which warrant attention and urgent
 solution.   They are mainly as follows:
 First, the marked improvements of the people's livelihood have been
 achieved under a situation in which the national income has increased
 limitedly.  Nearly all of the newly increased national income has been used
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 for consumption.  From 1979 to 1981, the usable amount of national income
 increased by 87.4 billion yuan, of which 87.1 billion yuan was spent on
 consumption (including the consumption of the people and of society).  The
 growth of the consumption funds is mostly arranged by the state plan.  It
 is entirely necessary to adjust the excessively high accumulation rate and
 put an end to the situation in which no improvements were ever made for many
 years in the people's livelihood.  However, it must also be admitted that a
 part of the consumption funds has been increased blindly outside the targets
 of the state plan, which is manifested in increasing purchase prices of
 agricultural products sold in excess of the quota and in issuing bonuses
 among the enterprises in cities and towns.  This has resulted in loss of
 control over the growth of consumption funds to a great extent.  The prob-
 lem now which should be taken into account is that on the one hand, the
 accumulation rate should be reduced rationally so as to ensure the con-
 tinued increase in the level of consumption and, on the other hand, a certain
 growth rate of the national economy should be maintained.  This requires us
 to raise the economic effect of accumulation funds by every possible means
 and to increase national revenue by a big margin.
 It should be acknowledged that over the last few years, the economic effect
 of accumulation funds has been very poor.  The national revenue created by
 every 100 yuan of accumulation funds has decreased year by year rather than
 increasing year by year, that is, it decreased from 33.7 yuan in 1978 to
 only 20.2 yuan in 1981.  The drop in the accumulation rate has resulted in
 a decrease in the economic effect of accumulation funds.  This has brought
 about new difficulties to the development of the national economy.  Failure
 to solve this problem will interfere not only with the growth rate of the
 national economy but also the continued improvement of the people's
 standard of living.
 Second, despite steady growth in production, state revenue has dropped.   The
 method of everybody "eating in separate kitchens" practiced in the financial
 system, the expansion of the decisionmaking power of enterprises, the wide-
 spread implementation of the bonus system among enterprises and undertaking
 units and the correction of the drawbacks of excessively centralized state
 control over the distribution of the national income have produced marked
 achievements in arousing the enthusiasm of the localities, enterprises and
 staff and workers and rejuvenating the economy.  Nevertheless, a new problem
 has also cropped up, that is, despite a certain growth rate maintained in
 the national economy year by year, state revenue has been on the decrease.
 Compared with 1978, in 1981, the total output value of industry and agri-
 culture rose by 180 billion yuan (excluding the factor of price fluctua-
 tion), whereas the state's revenue decreased.by 11.7 billion yuan.  With
 the development of production, why has the state's revenue decreased?
 This involves a multitude of factors.   But the main cause was a reduction
 in profits turned over to the state.   The ratio of the state's revenue in
 the national income was 37.2 percent in 1978, which was, as it should be,
 on the high side.   It was manifested in the relatively high degree.of
 centralization by the state and the limited amount of reserve financial
 resources of local administrations and enterprises.  The ratio in 1981 was.
 only 27 percent, which seemed to be on the low side.  It found expression in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 the fact that the country did not have sufficient money whereas the
 ex-budgetary funds of local administrations, mainly the money of the enter-
 prises, increased by a big margin roughly equal to more than half of the
 state revenue.  In the last 2 years, the state has had to borrow money from
 local administrations and enterprises in order to make up financial deficits.
 Exploration into the proper ratio for the state's revenue in the national
 economy should be continued.  But one thing is certain, that is, with the
 funds being decentralized and without money in hand, the country will
 accomplish nothing big or significant.  It will not do to let things go on
 for a long time in this way.  It is not a permanent solution for the coun-
 try to get along by depending on borrowing money from local administrations
 and enterprises.  The problem to which consideration should be given now is
 that the country should appropriately amass funds and undertake the work
 which should be done and what is more, be done urgently, and the work which
 is conducive to the overall situation but cannot be undertaken by local
 administrations and enterprises.
 Third, all kinds of subsidies for improving the lives of urban and rural
 people and promoting industrial and agricultural production have been on
 the increase.  During the 3 years from 1979 to 1981, the total amount of
 state subsidies reached 104.3 billion yuan, of which the amount in 1981 was
 42.9 billion yuan, an increase of 170 percent over 1978.  The ratio of state
 subsidies in the state's revenue within the same year was 14.2 percent in
 1978, and in 1979, 1980 and 1981 was 25.9 percent, 32.7 percent and 42.7
 percent respectively.  Of state subsidies, subsidies compensating for
 commodity price increases come first and in 1981 reached 32 billion yuan,
 constituting 74.7 percent of the total amount of subsidies within the same
 year.  According to rough statistics, at present, the number of subsidized
 items amounts to more than 80.  Take the important ones for example, the
 subsidies spent on the people's livelihood, such as on the price difference
 between the purchase and sale of grain, edible oil, nonstaple foodstuffs,
 coal and industrial articles for daily use, and subsidies spent on agri-
 cultural production, subsidies for losses in marketing chemical ferti-
 lizers, farm chemicals, farm machinery, plastic films and small-sized farm
 implements and for the price difference in supplying diesel oil and elec-
 tricity in preferential prices; the subsidies spent on industry, such as on
 the losses and subsidies resulting from the price difference in supplying
 such materials as cotton, leather, coal, bamboo and timber, and silkworm
 cocoons.  Huge amounts of state subsidies are spent on the consumption of
 the people.  Because of the subsidies for price differences and the reduc-
 tion in, or exemption from, taxation, in 1981, subsidies to the people in
 urban and rural areas averaged 32 yuan per capita--a total of 31.6 billion
 yuan.  That is to say, the improvement of the living standards of the
 people in our country has resulted not only from the increased income from
 labor and collective welfare but also from the portion of state subsidies.
 Without doubt, it is entirely necessary to practice state subsidies at a
 time when there are some latent dangers in finance and market prices.   At
 such a time, our major task is to stabilize the economy.  It constitutes a
 most important prerequisite and concerns the overall situation.   The fact
 that we adhered to the method of state subsidies in the previous stage has,
 in fact, played a considerable role whether in stabilizing market prices,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 improving the people's well-being, providing conditions for readjusting the
 economy or promoting the development of industrial and agricultural produc-
 tion.                     This is precisely an indication of the superiority of the socialist
 system of our country.  The problem to which consideration should be given
 now is that in a situation when the economy has gradually been stabilized
 but state revenue has been on the decrease, with more and more money spent
 on various kinds of subsidies and a heavier and heavier load on the state,
 it is impossible for the state to amass funds for much needed construction.
 All these problems have resulted from misapplying some aspects of the
 present economic system, from the irrationality of the pricing system, and
 from hastiness in adjusting accumulation and consumption rates.  Above all,
 haphazard use of accumulation funds and economic inefficiency have been
 basic causes.  The reform of the economic system and pricing system cannot
 be accomplished within a short time.  Carrying out the reform without full
 preparations and an overall plan will lead the economy to chaos. As for the
 problems in the ratio between accumulation and consumption, they can be
 solved so long as all of us have a unified understanding of them and do a
 good job in achieving an overall balance and rational arrangements.  So, the
 key to the problem lies in the fact that we should raise economic effect
 and put an end to waste on the one hand and the state should amass neces-
 sary funds and put them to rational use under overall arrangements on the
 other.
 After the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, in the
 course of correcting the "leftist" mistakes committed in economic work,
 some comrades in the economic theoretical circles and professional depart-
 ments probed and discussed the rational limits of the ratio between accumu-
 lation and consumption.  After analyzing historical experience, some
 departments pointed out that under normal circumstances, the proper accumu-
 lation rate was about 25 percent.  In our opinion, that is suitable.  Seen
 from the last few years of practice, it was precisely because of the reduc-
 tion in the accumulation rate that the level of consumption could be raised
 and the people's livelihood could be considerably improved.  In the future,
 provided we rationally arrange and use the accumulation funds well and
 substantially raise their economic effect, we can help develop production
 at a fairly rapid pace and help increase the national income considerably.
 This will be able to fulfill the requirements of both reducing the accumula-
 tion rate and gradually increasing the absolute amount of accumulation
 funds.
 In a speech delivered at an important meeting, Comrade Chen Yun pointed out
 that one major policy of our economic work is "first, the 1 billion people
 must have enough to eat; second, socialist construction must be carried out."
 This is our guiding ideology for correctly arranging the ratio between
 accumulation and consumption.  In accordance with this guiding ideology and
 in light of the actual conditions of the ratio between accumulation and
 consumption, at present, proper arrangements should be made for the follow-
 ing aspects:
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 First, in the distribution of national income, the ratio of the funds for
 redistribution amassed by the state (that is, state revenue) should be
 increased in order to guarantee the construction of necessary major state
 projects.  At present, the state's revenue has not increased but the funds
 outside the budgeted targets of local administrations and enterprises have
 increased by a big margin.  True, this has played a fairly great role in
 solving the financial difficulties of the local administrations and enter-
 prises and in undertaking some work conducive to developing the local
 economy and revitalizing enterprises.  However, generally speaking, there
 are very big contradictions in this respect.   Ours is a big country with
 a population of 1 billion.  In order to carry out the modernization program,
 we must have a big overall arrangement of the disposition of the productive
 forces anyway, and we have to undertake a batch of backbone projects which
 will play their part for many years and have a bearing on the national
 economy and the people's livelihood.   The formation of a rational layout of
 the productive forces and the construction of large-scale projects are out-
 side the power of local administrations and in undertaking them, it is even
 difficult to produce satisfactory results by depending on the joint efforts
 of several local administrations.  They can be undertaken only by depending
 on the state's unified arrangements.   Therefcre, it is imperative for the
 state to appropriately amass the scattered funds and to use them in the
 production construction of overall importance.   Of course, by the state
 amassing funds, we do not mean taking the old road in which excessively
 rigid control was imposed on everything, all financial resources were
 centralized in the hands of the central authorities and as a result, local
 administrations and enterprises did not have any power to manage their
 financial affairs in a flexible way; but we mean adjusting the ratio of the
 distribution of the interests of the state, the collective and the indi-
 vidual so as to ensure a relatively big increase in,the portion of funds
 amassed by the state and give proper consideration to the needs of local
 administrations and enterprises rather than negating and putting an end
 to the measures for reforming the economic system which have been carried
 out in the last few years and have produced certain results, measures includ-
 ing the method of everybody "eating in separate kitchens" practiced in the
 financial system, the expansion of decisionmaking power of enterprises and
 the introduction of the economic responsibility system in industrial enter-
 prises.   In studying the proper ratio of the portion of funds amassed by
 the state, the professional departments concerned are encouraged to consult
 with local administrations.   In giving consideration to the imbalanced
 development of the economies of the various regions, more care should be
 given to the economically backward provinces and regions and different
 regulations should be worked out,  for different trades and enterprises.
 It is not suitable to impose uniformity on all trades and enterprises.
 Second, strive to raise the economic effect of the use of accumulation
 funds.   The key problem is to conscientiously readjust the work of capital
 construction.  Judged from the situation in the last few years, funds
 allocated for capital construction within the state budget have been cut
 considerably.  The number of projects arranged according to the state plan
 have decreased, while that of projects constructed with funds raised by local
 enterprises themselves and with funds from bank loans have greatly increased.
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 The trend in this respect is tending to get out of control.  The solution
 to this problem is to bring the construction projects based on funds
 collected by local administrations and.local enterprises into line with
 state planning, strike an overall balance and draw up overall planning for
 them.  This will enable us to control the general scope of capital con-
 struction and at the same time, to concentrate our efforts on undertaking
 the projects which are most badly needed by the state at present and the
 projects which are preparing for the development over the next 10 years.
 Arranging the capital construction projects concerns not only the question
 of financial resources but what is more important, also the question of
 material resources.  At any one time, the state has only a certain amount
 of materials.  If we overextend the scope of capital construction, have no
 guarantee for material supply and fight a protracted war of attrition, then
 huge accumulation funds will stay idle in the numerous projects under con-
 struction and it will be impossible to form them into productive force so
 they can play their part in the production of material goods.  In arranging
 capital construction projects in the future, we must base ourselves on the
 capabilities of the state's financial and material resources and on what the
 state urgently needs and succeed in fighting a quick battle to force a quick
 decision and strive to complete the project in one vigorous effort once a
 project is undertaken.   Only in this way can we genuinely manage to shorten
 the construction cycles of capital construction and raise economic effect.
 The enthusiasm of local administrations and enterprises for carrying out
 capital construction should be brought into play but deviating from the
 needs and capabilities of the overall situation of the country will lead to
 blindness.  We must take the whole country into account, strike an overall
 balance and overcome blindness so as to make the limited accumulation funds
 produce the most satisfactory economic effect.
 Third, accumulation funds must be spent on key projects in a centralized
 way.  At present, energy and communications are the pronounced weak links
 in the national economy.  Owing to a strain in energy supply and in com-
 munications and transportation, many enterprises are operating below
 capacity and there has been a failure to give full play to the existing
 productive forces.   Therefore, it is a pressing task to spend the accumula-
 tion funds amassed by the state in a selective way on boosting the energy,
 and communications.   The construction of energy and communications projects
 requires huge investments and a long construction cycle and cannot possibly
 provide products and service to society within a short period of time and
 contribute to the acceleration of the economic growth gained in recent years.
 However, so long as full preparations are made to concentrate funds, equip-
 ment and materials in this respect, construction cycles can surely be
 shortened and the construction of energy and communications projects can
 produce economic returns in the minimum possible time.  With these bases,
 other branches of industry will then have conditions for rapid development.
 Seen in the short term or from a regional angle, using funds in a
 decentralized way for developing the processing industry in a big way rather
 than concentrating funds on energy resources and communications may ensure
 a relatively rapid development and produce some economic effect, but
 eventually this practice will be handicapped'by the shortage of energy
 supply and transportation capacity and as a result, the already formed
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 productive forces will not be able to be brought into full play.  In addi-
 tion, this will delay the construction cycle of energy and communications
 and interfere with the future growth rate.  We must avoid the occurrence of
 this situation.  Of course, by concentrating funds on energy and communica-
 tions construction projects, we mean striving to strengthen energy and com-
 munications--two weak links in our national economy--through 3 or 5 years
 of efforts by concentrating on completing the projects arranged by the
 annual state plan rather than attempting to undertake a considerable number
 of projects within a short period of time.
 The construction funds collected by local administrations and enterprises
 themselves should also be used in a centralized way, mainly in the techni-
 cal transformation of existing enterprises, and particularly in the tech-
 nical transformation centered around energy conservation.   In this way, it
 seems that no new construction projects have been undertaken and no new
 enterprises have been set up.  However, upgrading the level of technology
 and equipment of existing enterprises will not only accelerate the renewal
 and replacement of products, increase product varieties, improve product
 quality, cut material consumption and alleviate the strain in energy
 supply but also substantially boost production output.
 Fourth, measures should be taken to reduce state subsidies.  At present,
 the total amount of state subsidies is amazing and it is justifiable to say
 that the number has reached the limit.   In our opinion, state subsidies in
 the future can only be reduced rather than increased.  Now one fairly prac-
 tical aspect in our work is to strengthen overall reorganization of enter-
 prises, raise economic results, quicken the pace of commodity circulation
 and capital turnover, reduce the losses of the enterprises which are being
 run at a loss or change the losses into profits, enable most of the enter-
 prises to increase their profits and help,maintain the growth of profits
 of enterprises or help their profit growth rate surpass the growth rate of
 their production.   There is abundant potential in this respect.  No matter
 whether it is industrial, communications or financial units, or whether it
 is rural communes and their subdivisions, they must all think about the
 interests of the country, reduce their dependence on state subsidies as
 far as possible and make greater contributions to the state.
 Fifth, the improvement of the people's livelihood must be realized step by
 step on the basis of the development of production and the enhancement of
 labor productivity.  With the development of production, we will have a
 material basis for improving the living standards of the people.   Compared
 with the people's well-being in the past few years, the people's livelihood
 has been remarkably improved but the overall level of consumption is still
 not high.   There is no doubt that the improvement of the people's liveli-
 hood must be continued.   The steady improvement of the people's level of
 consumption will not only further arouse the enthusiasm of the broad masses
 of people for production but also promote the development of industrial and
 agricultural production and other undertakings through the growth of con-
 sumption and boost the national income.  Nevertheless, there must be a

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 guiding principle in raising the people's level of consumption:  One is to
 manage both to ensure the continued improvement of the people's livelihood
 and to carry out economic construction in light of the current national
 strength, and the other is to arrange the growth of the consumption funds
 disbursed by the state strictly in accordance with the state plan.  Blindly
 increasing the consumption funds by deviating from the capabilities of the
 nation and from the arrangements of the state plan does not tally with the
 long-term interests of the people throughout the country.
 With satisfactory solutions to the above-mentioned problems in five areas,
 the new problems that have cropped up in the current ratio between accumu-
 lation and consumption may possibly be solved fairly properly.

 BE VIGILANT AGAINST THE DANGER OF A REVIVAL OF JAPANESE MILITARISM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug. 82 pp 37-40
 [Article by RED FLAG commentator]
 [Text]  In the course of screening school textbooks, the Japanese Education
 Ministry has brazenly distorted the history of Japanese aggression and
 absolved the Japanese militarists of their war crimes.  This incident has
 naturally evoked strong indignation and protests from the Chinese, Korean
 and other East and Southeast Asian nations.  The Chinese Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs has made representations to the Japanese Government demand-
 ing that it assume the responsibility of correcting the mistakes made by
 the Japanese Education Ministry.  The situation is still under review.  A
 flood of condemnation from various countries, including public opinion in
 Japan, is swelling.  As pointed out by many commentators, this is defi-
 nitely not a simple dispute over the use of words or over the accidental
 mistakes made by the Japanese authorities concerned.  It is a grave signal
 that the danger of a revival of militarism exists in Japan.
 Why is the Japanese Education Ministry trying to cover up and distort
 historical facts?
 As everybody knows, Japan entered the imperialist stage of development in
 the latter part of the last century and the early part of the present
 century.  One of the basic characteristics of imperialism is external
 expansion, contention for colonies and spheres of influence and partition
 of the.world.   By means of wars of aggression, Japan successively annexed
 Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from China in 1895 and completely swallowed
 up Korea in 1910.  Lenin, in "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,"
 listed Japan with Britain, Russia, France, Germany and the United States as
 one of the six biggest imperialist nations.   In 1914 these six possessed 92

 only after Britain, France and Russia.   In 1931 Japan invaded and occupied
 the three northwest provinces of China, and in 1933, invaded and occupied
 Jehol Province.  In 1937 it launched the full-scale aggression against
 China and occupied large areas of north China, east China, the central
 plains and south China.  In December 1941, Japan also started the Pacific
 war and occupied the-Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore., Indonesia and Burma.

 Japanese militarists brought great suffering to the Chinese, Korean and
 other Southeast Asian nations.  These aggressions by the Japanese mili-
 tarists and their aftermaths are historical facts which have been clearly
 recorded in the history books and textbooks of many countries in the world.
 What should be particularly pointed out is that during the war of aggression
 against China from the 1930's to the 1940's, the Japanese militarists com-
 mitted countless inhuman crimes against the Chinese people.  They burned,
 killed and looted everywhere they went, raped the women, carried out large-
 scale massacres of old and disabled people as well as women and children
 and committed all kinds of atrocities.  In particular, they carried out an
 extremely brutal policy of "burn all, kill all, loot all" in the anti-
 Japanese base areas which were under the leadership of the CPC.  In the
 occupied territory, they also forced Chinese workers to engage in slave
 labor and created many "mass graves" filled with corpses.  The big Nanjing
 massacre, which shocked the country and the whole world, was only one of
 their sordid crimes.  To the Chinese people who suffered deeply from the
 war of aggression, all these events will never be forgotten.  The war of
 aggression launched by the Japanese militarists also exacted a heavy price
 from the Japanese people.  As for the Japanese people, they should also
 always bear this lesson in mind.
 In modern Chinese history, it was the lofty ideal and goal of all progres-
 sive Chinese as well as the common desire and national sentiment of
 millions of Chinese both at home and abroad, to completely liberate the
 nation from the oppression of imperialist Japan and other imperialist
 powers.  For half a century, and particularly in the 1930's and 1940's,
 the Chinese people waged a heroic and indomitable struggle, despite
 extreme hardships and difficulties, against the Japanese invaders and
 wrote a glorious chapter in the annals of the world national liberation
 movement.  During World War II, as a result of the joint efforts of the
 Chinese people and other peoples of the world, Japanese imperialism was
 defeated together with the German and Italian fascists.  At that time, the
 Japanese Government shouldered the blame for the war and signed the sur-
 render.  Such major war criminals as Hideki Tojo and Ishine Matsui, who
 directed the Nanjing massacre, were tried by the International Military
 Tribunal and received the punishment they deserved.
 It has long been a verdict of history that the Japanese militarists com-
 mitted a serious crime of aggression against the Chinese, Korean and South-
 east Asian people.  These butchers, who massacred the people of various
 countries, have been locked forever in the pillory of history.
 Now, the Japanese Education Ministry has distorted the history of this half
 century in the screening of Japanese textbooks and has denied that Japan
 carried out aggression against China.  They have used such words as
 "advance into north China" to cover up the full-scale war of aggression
 against China which began in 1937.   They actually made a counterattack and
 described the indiscriminate killing of Chinese civilians after the
 occupation of Nanjing by the Japanese invading army as the result of
 "provocations" caused by the resistance of Chinese soldiers and civilians.

 Besides the Japanese Education Ministry, some high officials in the
 Japanese Government have also come forth to express'support for this dis-
 tortion.  Among them is Yukeyasu Matsuno, head of Japan's National Land
 Agency,, who.even argued:  "When Japan 'advanced' into foreign countries,
 it did not call its actions aggressions, and to present 'advance' as
 aggression is a distortion of history."  According to the principles of
 international law generally recognized by the world, the violation of the
 territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries and the act of
 plundering and enslaving the people of other countries by any country
 constitutes aggression.  Moreover, is it not a fact that Japan has practiced
 such acts of aggression against China for almost half a century?  According
 to the logic of certain people in Japan, aggressions and aggressors do not
 exist in world history, and not only should the whole history of Japanese
 aggression against China be completely rewritten, but the whole history of
 World War I should also be completely rewritten.  From the attitude a
 person adopts toward the mistakes and crimes he committed in the past, one
 can see what this person will do in the future.  This also applies to a
 country as well as to a nation.  The attitude adopted toward crimes of
 external aggression in history has a bearing on this country and the trend
 of the future development of this nation.   Iu 1972 when Chinese Premier
 Zhou Enlai was normalizing relations between China and Japan, he made an
 allegorical statement pregnant with meaning.regarding the past incidents
 caused by the Japanese militarists' invasion of China.  He said:   "The
 invasion of China by Japanese militarists has caused great sufferings to
 the Chinese people, and the Japanese people have also suffered deeply.
 Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future.  We must
 firmly bear in mind such experiences and lessons."  The reason the human
 race cannot forget the past and must respect history is because they can
 learn from history, draw useful lessons and take warning so as not to make
 the same mistake as their predecessors.  Therefore, we should not cover up
 the true picture of history and, moreover, we cannot distort history.   This
 deliberate distortion of history to defend aggressions in history means that
 some day Japan will probably retrace the old footpath of militarism.  The
 incident of.the distortion of history. by the Japanese Education Ministry
 indicates that this danger is already looming in present-day Japan.
 The Japanese militarist forces suffered a crushing defeat in World War II.
 Since the war, the militarists have always been thinking of staging a come-
 back, but they have never been able to succeed because of the resolute
 resistance of the Japanese people and the strong opposition of the people
 of various Asian countries.  What should be noticed is that the militarist
 elements have by no means vanished in Japan; there are many of them in the
 numerous extreme rightwing groups in the country today.   These people are
 carrying out all kinds of activities in a bid to revive militarism and %re
 vainly thinking of turning Japan from an economic into a great military
 power and reliving the old dream of the "Great East Asia Coprosperity
 Sphere."  These people are praising the barbaric and ignorant bushido
 spirit, beautifying the history of Japan's external aggression, absolving
 the militarist ringleaders and war criminals of blame and even worshipping
 them as "national heroes" and praying for their souls.  The film "Thai
 Nippon Teikou" ("The Great Japanese Empire") recently released in Japan

 wantonly glorifies the war criminal Hideki Tojo and propagates the notion
 that Japan's launching of aggressive wars was for its own "protection" and
 the "liberation of Asia."  According to an advertisement in NIHONG KEIZAI
 SHIMBUN, the purpose of the film is to "restore a historical view of the
 great East Asian war that is favorable to the Japanese."  This has clearly
 explained the purpose of certain Japanese in reversing the verdict against
 the militarists.  Cultural education is the reflection of economics and
 politics, and ideological opinion is the precursor of action.  The dis-
 tortion of history is precisely for the sake of preparing public opinion            10
 in an attempt to revive militarism and is an important manifestation of
 this political trend.
 World War II brought unprecedented disaster to the whole of mankind, and
 its memory is still fresh in the minds of the people.  This great war was
 started by the Japanese full-scale war of aggression against China.  One
 important lesson learned from the outbreak of this great war was:  When the
 Japanese militarists kept on expanding the scale of aggression against China,
 when Mussolini was carrying out a war of aggression against Abyssinia and
 when Hitler was embarking on such adventurist actions as intervening in the
 Spanish Civil War, annexing Austria and occupying Czechoslovakia, the anti-
 fascist countries either lacked vigilance or adopted a policy of appeasement
 toward the aggressors.  They did not curb the danger of a world war in its
 germinating stage.  Today the situation of the whole world and the balance
 between the forces of peace and war are vastly different than before.  How-
 ever, the danger of a world war still exists.  A common urgent task facing
 the people and all peace-loving countries of the world at present is to curb
 any factor which might lead to the outbreak of a new world war and making it
 possible to breed or grow.
 The Chinese people and government have always adopted a reasonable,
 magnanimous and farsighted attitude regarding the historical question of
 the Japanese invasion of China.  We believe that China and Japan are
 separated by only a strip of water, that the people of both countries have
 a long history of friendly relations and that the Japanese aggression
 against China occurred under conditions which were entirely against the
 wishes of the Japanese people.   Therefore, we have made a distinction
 between the Japanese people, who could not decide for themselves at that
 time, and the Japanese ruling class; between elements of the Japanese ruling
 class who did not approve of the war of aggression and the militarist
 forces; and between those in the Japanese Government who at that time were
 willing to carry out a friendly and good-neighbor policy and those in the
 Japanese Government who should take the blame for launching external wars
 of aggression in history.   Japan, which has practiced external aggression
 in its history, owes a debt to the countries victimized by its aggression.
 As far as China is concerned, over 10 million people were killed by Japan's
 war of aggression in the 1930's and 1940's, while property damage exceeded
 $50 billion.  Japan, which has now become an "economic big power," should
 retrace its roots.  Was not a considerable part of its capital and wealth
 in fact plundered from other countries by aggressive war and colonial rule?

 From the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 alone, Japan extorted from China
 reparations equivalent to what was then 350 million Japanese yen, and "the
 funds guaranteed the maintenance of the empire's armaments and the estab-
 lishment of modern industry."  ("History of Japan's Foreign Affairs" by
 Seisaburo Nobuo)  Regarding the half century from the Sino-Japanese War of
 1894-1895 to the end of World War II, it is even more difficult to estimate
 the. wealth Japan looted from China, Korea and other Asian countries (includ-
 ing wealth created by laborers from these countries).  The Chinese people
 do not demand that the present Japanese Government assume responsibility
 for the war, and, for the sake of friendship between the people of the two
 countries, they have also dropped the demands for reparations.  However,
 the Chinese people and all Asian peoples who suffered from Japanese aggres-
 sion have the right to demand that the present Japanese Government assume a
 political and moral responsibility to curb the attempts of extreme rightwing
 forces in Japan to revive militarism, to tell the Japanese people--and
 particularly the younger generation--the historical truth, and to teach
 them that they must never again allow Japan to become a militarist state or
 to launch external wars of aggression.  At present, some of the people in
 the Japanese Government are not only unwillint, to do so but, instead, are
 trying to distort history and glorify aggression.   This is a dereliction of
 duty.   It should be pointed out that to distort the history of Japanese
 aggression against China is, in essence, an extreme insult to the Chinese
 people.   The Chinese Government has approached the Japanese Government and
 asked for a correction.   This is the legitimate right of the aggrieved
 party.   But some high-ranking Japanese officials, on the contrary, tried to
 find fault with China by saying that this is "interference in Japan's
 internal affairs."  Their disregard for morality and,justice has reached a
 level that is impervious to reason.  However, public opinion from all walks
 of life in Japan has also proved that this behavior of the Japanese authori-
 ties is also intolerable to the Japanese people.  Kazuo Asukada, chairman
 of the Japanese Socialist Party and member of the Diet, pointed out:   "They
 attempted to play down the aggression perpetrated in the past against the
 Asian countries, cover up the injuries caused by the conduct of the
 Japanese militarists and erase such things from history.   It is only natu-
 ral that this tendency will evoke strong indignation among peoples of
 various Asian countries who were the victims of such acts of aggression."
 Toluma Utsunomiya, president of the Japan-China Friendship Association,
 'said:   "Pandering to the rightwing tendency, the Japanese Government
 attempts to use textbooks to blot out the Japanese people's self-reproach
 for aggression.   We cannot agree to this."  An editorial in YOMIURI SHIMBUN
 pointed out:   "Over 60 percent of the people in Japan at present belong to
 'the generation who do not know anything about the former war.'  Therefore,
 the important thing is to teach them not to blot out the responsibility for
 the-war.  However, the screening (of textbooks) has done just the opposite.
 This. cannot but be considered as a distortion of historical facts."  The
 National Conference of the Japanese History Education Workers Association
 has unanimously demanded that the Education Ministry change the practice of
 distorting history at once.  All these reflect the sentiment of the
 Japanese public from all walks of life who are willing to have friendly
 relations with the people of China and other Asian countries.

 As a result of the concerted efforts of the Chinese and Japanese peoples
 as well as people of insight, diplomatic relations between China and Japan
 were normalized in 1972 and a joint statement was issued in this connection
 by the governments of the two countries.  The treaty of peace and friend-
 ship concluded between China and Japan in 1978 affirmed that "the joint
 statement is the basis for the development of peaceful and friendly rela-
 tions between China and Japan, and various principles indicated in the
 joint statement must be strictly observed."
 The joint statement pointed out:  "The Japanese side is keenly aware of
 Japan's responsibility for causing enormous damages in the past to the
 Chinese people through war and deeply reproaches itself."  This showed the
 attitude of self-reproach adopted by the Japanese Government for the wars
 of aggression launched against China in the past.  It was written as a
 major principle into the Sino-Japanese joint statement on the establishment
 of diplomatic relations and is also affirmed by the treaty of peace and
 friendship.  It is a prerequisite for the development of peaceful and
 friendly relations between China and Japan.  This prerequisite cannot be
 overthrown.  To do so means to wreck the basis for the establishment of
 peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries.  The Chinese
 people have all along valued the friendly relations with the Japanese
 people.  The broad masses of Japanese people also have friendly feelings
 for the Chinese people.  Just as pointed out by the joint statement of the
 two governments, "the normalization of diplomatic relations between the
 two countries and the development of neighborly and friendly relations
 between the two countries conform to the interests of the peoples of both
 countries and will also contribute to the easing of tension in Asia and
 the safeguarding of world peace."  Only by solemnly accepting historical
 facts, respecting the political basis for the establishment of diplomatic
 relations between the two countries and educating the younger generation
 in accordance with this guideline can friendly relations between China and
 Japan develop and can the peoples of both countries get along as friends
 from generation to generation.  The Japanese Government should squarely
 face the distortion of the history of Japanese aggression against China
 made by the Education Ministry in the process of screening textbooks, an
 affair which is damaging Sino-Japanese relations, and take practical action
 to defend the basis for friendly relations between the two countries by
 correcting this mistake.. As far as the Chinese people are concerned, we are
 willing to work together with the Japanese people and the peoples of other
 Asian countries, unite with them and make joint efforts to prevent the
 danger of a revival of militarism.

 CADRES' STUDY SHOULD BE ASSESSED AND EXAMINED
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 41-42
 [Article by Cheng Shu [2052 5289]]
 [Text] While promoting reform of the organizational structure, our party
 also attaches great importance to cultivating cadres.  It has called for
 making the education of cadres a regular, constant practice and an institu-
 tion.  It has clearly defined targets which cadres of central party and
 government organizations should attain after they have been theoretically,
 professionally and culturally trained in the next 5 years.   It has decided
 that a system should be set up for arranging a short-term sabbatical study
 for cadres after working a few years in posts, appointing and promoting
 cadres according to the results of their training, and checking and
 examining cadres' study.   The formulation of the policies and systems fully
 shows that the party Central Committee attaches great importance and pays
 adequate attention to the education of cadres.  It not only reflects
 requirements for the development of building socialist modernization, but
 also expresses the eager desire of vast numbers of cadres.
 The great majority of cadres uphold the system of checking and examining
 their study.  However, some cadres have doubts about the necessity and
 possibility of doing so.  Therefore, it seems it is necessary to offer
 some explanations on this issue.
 The system of checking and examining cadres' study constitutes part of the
 whole system of conducting education on cadres.   Its essential contents
 demand that after a period of concentrated study, every cadre should be
 assessed and examined according to the requirements of his study plan,
 with marks to be kept in his file to help in making the appropriate appoint-
 ment.   If the study is arranged in accordance with the teaching plans,
 teaching outlines and subjects at the middle school, polytechnic school or
 college levels, comrades who pass the exams will then be able to acquire
 diplomas.  A test system like this will help promote cadres' study and
 progress, and will contribute to the formation of a rank of cadres that is
 younger, better educated, more advanced professionally, and more revolu-
 tionalized.

 Cadres of the party and government organizations are leaders and organizers
 in the arduous struggle for the realization of socialist modernization.
 Their quality, level of Marxism, professional knowledge and educational
 level in meeting demands for building modernization have a bearing on the
 success or failure of our cause.  All our cadres are servants of the
 people, doing everything on their behalf.  The people call on us to do
 everything well with high efficiency and quality, so we must unceasingly
 enhance our theoretical, cultural and professional levels and work
 proficiency.  With a view to achieving fruitful results in study, cadres
 should meet strict demands and abide by the system.  Slackness, careless-
 ness and perfunctoriness in the training are not allowed.  Since the
 education of cadres has been made regularized and systematized, every one
 of our cadres now has the right to take a sabbatical leave for study
 according to a scheduled plan.  And he is also bound to study a great deal
 in the assigned period of time.  Checking, attesting or examining results
 of cadres' study is a normal practice.  In a'certain sense, it is a kind
 of motive power to promote the study.  On the other hand, superior organi-
 zations will be able to know every cadre well from the records in his file
 concerning his knowledge, proficiency and marks in study and traniing.  And
 thus the superior will also be able to cultivate every cadre according to
 his practical deeds in work and know him well enough to assign him a job
 and promote him commensurate with his ability.  This is essential not only
 for the growth of every cadre but also for the formation of the whole rank
 of cadres.
 Such a test system in cadres' study is not a new phenomenon.  As early as
 during the war years, many cadres' schools organized by our party in vari-
 ous forms had strict testing systems.  After the founding of the People's
 Republic, those who took time off to go to a worker-peasant short program
 high school and those who received specialized training could graduate
 only after formal exams.  In addition, in some localities those who studied
 Marxist theories while still working had to have tests on a certain number
 of courses.  In 1955, the party Central Committee issued a report submitted
 by the central propaganda department, demanding a system of exams for in-
 service cadres who studied Marxist theories in party schools or political
 schools.  This system played an active role at that time in promoting
 initiative among cadres studying in these schools.  Some cadres now are not
 used to the exam system, or have doubts about such a system.  This mainly
 results from the protracted weakening of cadres' education work since the
 late 1950's, the result of an error in the party's guiding ideology.
 However, in recent years, more and more cadres have demanded a change in
 the aimless, unsystematic education of cadres, and in the lack of a rela-
 tionship between cadres' training and job assignment.  Under these circum-
 stances, most cadres will accept an exam system once they realize the
 reasons for such a system.
 It can be said that now objective conditions are mainly ripe for establish-
 ing such a test system.  Such conditions are:  Since the third plenary
 session in 1978, party committees at various levels have strengthened
 leadership over cadres' education work.  Material conditions for cadres'
 education have improved.  We have accumulated experience in conducting

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 education on cadres from massive cadres' training.  We have set up bases
 for cadres' education on a certain scale, which can be further expanded
 according to the amount of cadres available for training.  And we have had
 an experienced teaching corps which is loyal to the cause of cadres'
 education. In addition, the central departments concerned and local party
 committees at various levels have worked out the proper. length of schooling
 and teaching plans for courses on Marxist theories, basic professional
 knowledge, specialized occupational knowledge, and cultural and scientific
 knowledge.  And different curricula are being. arranged to suit cadres of
 different scholastic backgrounds and with different needs.  All these have
 created good conditions for practicing a test system in cadres' study.
 Some comrades may worry whether exams will come as "a surprise attack"
 without considering the different situation of each cadre.  In accordance
 with the spirit of the central authorities, from now on, cadres' training
 should be flexible enough to adapt to different aims, work requirements and
 different scholastic levels in theory, profession and culture.  Exams
 should be designed to satisfy the demands of a cadre's study plan.  There-
 fore, it is not necessary to worry about the exams.   Some comrades may also
 worry whether the exams will be implemented is in full-time schools.   It
 must be made known that the education of cadres is part of adult education.
 It is different from that of youngsters, so the method of examination should
 not be indiscriminately imitated on that used for the young students in full-
 time schools.   In recent years, some methods of assessment and examination
 which are specially adaptable to the education of cadres have been used in
 some party schools and cadre schools.  For example, some courses are only
 assessed and some must be examined.  The subjects assigned for exams stress
 the knowledge applicable for cadres to,master and use in the future, but
 do not aim at reciting a lesson from memory.   The open-book and closed-book
 exam systems are both adopted.  Sometimes-the exams can be done by writing
 a report on what one has learned from the study or by drawing up a plan for
 solving practical problems in work with the knowledge one has acquired.  The
 'methods of examination can still be further explored and renovated by con-
 tinuously summing up experience from. the practice of teaching work.  On the
 problem of exams, we must not only pay attention to the characteristics
 accompanying cadres' education, but must also set strict demands on them
 and adopt a stern attitude toward the problem.

 WHAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE IN ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 43-45
 [Article by Zhou Shulian [0719 0647 5571]; passages within slantlines
 published in boldface]
 [Text]   Editor's Note:  Many readers have pointed out
 that in studying economic theory it is very important
 to relate the theory to practice and with an open mind
 and dynamic thinking, not only study the economics of
 a socialist country but also examine and draw on the
 experiences of capitalist countries' methods of
 management and administration.  These ideas reflect
 the shared demands of a certain number of cadres and
 we are now publishing this article by Zhou Shulian so
 that our readers may examine such ideas themselves.
 In the process of studying the Marxist theory of economics, we should
 always examine and summarize China's own experiences in enterprise manage-
 ment while at the same time not completely ignore, indeed we may even
 borrow from, some experiences in economic management gained by Western
 countries and thereby do everything possible to find ways of improving
 enterprise management.
 Marx said:  "All direct processes of production reflect the form of the
 combined processes of society and are not expressions of the isolated
 labors of one independent producer, but should engender both controlled
 and organized labor."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 25, p 431)
 Both capitalist and socialist enterprises are built on the societal founda-
 tions of production and it is in this sense that they are related.  Over
 the years, Western countries have accumulated a wealth of experience in
 enterprise management, some of which is well worth our taking note of.
 For, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:   "Within the enterprises of
 industrially developed countries the work force is low, efficiency is high
 and there is an understanding of how to do business.  Thus we may be able
 to improve on our own work by learning some of the principles and reasons
 behind these phenomena."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 5, p 287)
 Thus on the basis of our present need to raise the level of enterprise
 management in China, we must take careful note of and learn from their
 experiences in organizing social mass production.   For example:

 /We can learn from their experiences in managerial policymaking./  In order
 to survive and, develop within constantly changing internal and external
 surroundings, Western enterprise has always, and indeed is increasingly,
 seriously examining the question of management policies..  The American
 management expert Xi Meng [6007 5536] considers that "management means
 policymaking."  Traditional thinking has always viewed policymaking as a
 very.last-minute thing.  Modern theorists of policymaking see. it more as
 a process involving the gathering together of all the; facts, examining
 them,... analyzing them and making decisions: and choices from a selection of
 all the possibilities available.  They consider that it is, possible to
 divide the process of policymaking into the, following three stages:  1) The
 gathering together of information:  involving. the. collection of relevant
 economic. and technological information . both inside and outside the enter-
 prise for the purpose of analysis.                        2) The. drafting of a plan:  drawing up
 all feasible plans on the basis of the information gathered in the first
 stage..  3) Choosing a plan:  making a choice of the best plan from all the
 feasible ones.  Thus, in the process of policymaking, the role of informa-
 tion is always stressed.                       Furthermore, policym.aking theorists distinguish
 between finalized and nonfinalized policymaking; the former type of policy-
 making, involving finalization and procedure, has set patterns to follow,
 while the latter, nonfinalized policymaking is characterized by a lack of
 set rules to follow.  China's socialist enterprise, by the nature of its
 subordination to changes in national plans, is relatively unique.   It must
 not only have good administration but also.good management.  Having ignored
 enterprise management in the past, it is doubly important that we attach
 importance to it now and study and learn from the experiences of policy-
 making within capitalist countries' enterprise management.
 /We can learn from their experience of closely linking production and sales./
 In order to be competitively successful, Western enterprise not only
 attaches importance to production but also to sales., thereby closely linking
 the processes of production and circulation.   The most important measures
 adopted within Western enterprise include:   1) Implementation of market-
 limited production.  When an enterprise fixes its production plans it first
 determines the variety and amount of production according to market demands,
 and after this continually alters these plans in accordance with changes in
 the market situation. 2) Examination and study of the market situation.
 The enterprise either undertakes such studies itself or enlists the aid of
 experts in market studies and advertising agencies to carry out the studies.
 Such studies include examinations of purchasers, competition, the expansion
 capacity of'the market and consumers' opinions.   3) The drawing up of
 market forecasts.   On the basis of examinations and studies of the market
 situation, market forecasts are drawn up.   Such forecasts include the extent
 of sales of specific commodities, sales areas and period of sales.  Most
 forecasts are either annual, seasonal or monthly, while some forecasts are
 more long-range, sometimes 3 or even 5 years.  4) Moves to raise the quality
 of service and customer convenience.  A great deal of importance is attached
 to improving the quality of the work and service performed by salesmen.  In
 addition, the need is recognized to catch the customer's interest through
 sales activities, to grasp the psychology of the customer and stim,ilate his
 or her need or desire for a product, thereby encouraging the customer to

 make a purchase.  Emphasis is also placed on the importance of post sales
 service.  The above experiences provide several lessons worth learning
 from for socialist enterprise.
 /We can learn from their experiences in raising product quality and lower-
 ing production costs./  Many enterprises in Western countries make use of
 expert help when organizing their labor force, and. in terms of saving power
 and raw materials, they apply scientific and technological skills as well
 as using advanced and sometimes imported management tools and management
 skills, and there are valuable lessons to be learned from the experiences of
 such an approach.   Particularly worthy of China's attention is their
 experience in raising product quality and lowering production costs.  The
 improvements in quality and management may be seen as having occurred in
 stages.  Initially it is based on a simple examination of the situation
 after it has happened.  Since the 1920's quality examination has been based
 on statistics.  Learning to control the process of production leads to con-
 trol of product quality.  In the 1960's general quality control was
 developed and product design, purchasing of raw materials, production and
 fitting all the way up to post sales service all conformed to the set
 requirements for product quality.  Many enterprises developed a "perfec-
 tionist movement" whereby workers were mobilized to eliminate any flaws in
 the work process and thus ensure a constant high quality of production.  In
 order to bring down production costs, many Western companies have adopted
 an approach to production costs management known as value analysis or value
 engineering.   The U.S. firm General Electric was an early practitioner of
 this scheme.   In essence it involves achieving low production costs by
 doing one's utmost to find the simplest production methods and cheapest raw
 materials while not letting the quality of the end product suffer.  In
 carrying out value analysis it is important to find out whether there is a
 need to use a certain type of raw material, and find out what profit can be
 made from it.  In addition it must be ascertained whether there are any
 excesses in the quality of the raw materials and whether it would be pos-
 sible to adopt even cheaper production methods.  Furthermore one must check
 that there is a rational breakdown of the production costs, whether there
 are any cheaper prices or any better suppliers and whether the selling price
 is worthwhile in terms of production costs.
 In Japan, the Toyota Company feels that its own achievements in this area
 have been "to make quality guarantees the heart of technological work" and
 "to make reductions in production costs the main aim of enterprises."  Our
 socialist enterprises must therefore set up firm principles on raising
 quality and lowering production costs and the above experiences of Western
 enterprises are well worth our taking note of.
 /We can learn from their experience in improving the enterprise management
 system and the setting up of good relations between centralization and
 decentralization./  Capitalist enterprise has one problem with the manage-
 ment system, the solution to which is often a prerequisite for the success-
 ful organization of production for the enterprise.  For example, since the
 1920's the United States has run centralized management systems but as
 enterprises gradually grew bigger, the faults of such a system became more

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 and more apparent with the result that some large enterprises began a system
 of departmentalization.  Such a system has three main characteristics:
 1) Each department is a decentralized unit with the enterprise granting the
 department whatever limited powers are necessary.  2) Each department is a
 unit responsible for its own profits, having defined responsibilities in
 terms of profits, thereby reaping the benefits in accordance with the ups
 and downs of the management situation.  3) Each department is a unit
 responsible for its products and hence must actively try to expand the
 market and put the products through market tests.  Under certain conditions
 the departmentalization system can be helpful in allowing a large company
 to accurately balance centralization and decentralization and also carry
 -out management policy decisions.  It is considered by many Western enter-
 prises that to achieve an ideal relationship between centralization and
 decentralization, many factors must be taken into consideration such as
 the scale of the enterprise, management make-up, regional distribution, the
 number of management employees and their standard of work, the company
 history and external relations.  Thus, the larger an enterprise is, the
 greater, in general, the need for decentralization.   With a low number of
 management employees and low quality of work, decentralization will be
 harder.   If a company's outside relationships change very quickly, then
 decentralization will be relatively simple.  Certain restrictions have also
 been defined for the powers of decentralized departments within an enter-
 prise.                          For example:   1) The extent and range of such powers should be
 related to the nature and extent of responsibility of the department.
 2) The powers of,each level of managerial departments must be clearly
 defined and differentiated.  3) The relations between each functioning
 department of the enterprise must be clearly laid down.  4) Each depart-
 ment only takes orders from one superior department, thereby avoiding a
 situation in which a subordinate department is at a loss as to what to do,
 having received two conflicting orders.  These few ground rules should be
 learned by China in its move to revolutionize the economic management
 system and set up a system of economic responsibility.
 Furthermore, /we should take note of Western enterprises' experiences in
 training management personnel./ _ In the United States of America, for
 example, management education is fairly well developed and not only should
 our. Education Ministry take note of this, but our enterprises as well.   In
 the United States many large companies train their own management personnel
 and, according to statistics, in 1976 U.S. companies trained 1.4 million
 personnel on company work time in various managerial positions, spending a
 total of U.S.$43 million.  Many companies have "management personnel train-
 ing centers" where they train people in whatever areas of management they
 are needed.
 .In learning from the experiences of Western enterprise management what are
 the things that we should be most careful of?

 /1.  We must recognize the fundamental differences between capitalist
 enterprise management and socialist enterprise management./
 Marx scientifically clarified the dual nature of management in that the
 content and style of management is restricted by production forces and
 production relations.  Since production relations of socialism and capital-
 ism couldn't be more different, the nature of enterprise management is
 different too.  In terms of the content of enterprise management, capitalist
 enterprise management embodies capitalist exploitation.  As Lenin pointed
 out, capitalism is predatory by nature.  Capitalist enterprise management is
 designed to allow the capitalist to reap the greatest possible profits,
 while socialist enterprise management is designed to fulfill society's and
 every member's material and cultural needs.  A socialist enterprise should
 also strive for greater profits because profits are the main source of
 financial accumulation and without such accumulation it is possible to
 develop production and society and satisfy the needs of the people.  But
 we must not, on any account, copy the capitalist enterprise system and
 engage in speculation and profiteering, resort to deception and harm others
 to benefit the individual, purely for the sake of increased profits.
 Socialist enterprise must accord with the country's plans and it must not
 weaken or destroy these plans merely to achieve greater profits.
 When one considers the style of enterprise management, one can see that
 capitalist enterprise management is extremely autocratic with all important
 decisions being made by the capitalists and their representatives.  Today,
 some capitalist enterprises have set up "democratic management," but
 because of the emphasis on the capitalist's profits and the severe limita-
 tions of its power, it has not been able to change the basic face of capi-
 talist enterprise management.  In socialist enterprises it is essential and
 therefore possible to closely link scientific and democratic management.
 It is important that one can recognize these basic differences between
 the two types of management before one can take a correct stance in learn-
 ing from the experiences of Western enterprise management.
 /2.  We cannot totally adopt and copy the experiences of capitalist enter-
 prise management./
 Lenin said the Taylor system "is a combination of the refined brutality of
 bourgeois exploitation and a number of the greatest scientific achievements
 in the field of analyzing mechanical motions during work, the elimination
 of superfluous and awkward motions, the elaboration of correct methods of
 work, the introduction of the best system of accounting and control, etc."
 ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 3, p 511)  Mao Zedong also pointed out at a
 very early stage that "to reject out of hand all foreign science, tech
 nology and culture without analysis is not a Marxist approach, and likewise,
 total acceptance of all things foreign is equally unacceptable and neither
 of these stances will advance the cause of socialism."  ("Selected Works of
 Mao Zedong," Vol 5, p 287)  It is necessary to promote the study of scien-
 tific advances and methodology of Western enterprise management, but on no
 account should we simply copy and imitate.  And of course, those areas of
 enterprise management which do not correspond with socialist concepts
 should not be adopted within the socialist enterprise.

 /3.  We should take an all-round scientific view of the Western capitalist
 class' theory of enterprise management./
 In the case of some very soundly based theories, we must look for the
 possibility that the theory contains some scientific truth and in its
 application we must see to what extent it upholds the exploitive system
 of.capitalism.  When we are examining these theories and the feasibility
 of using them or ways of applying them in a system of socialist enterprise
 management, we must not forget our task of adhering to the socialist road.
 Socialist enterprise management must help develop the forces of production
 as well as help consolidate and develop socialist production relations.
 Finally, /when we learn from the experiences of foreign enterprise manage-
 ment, we must base what we learn on the actual situation in China today and
 remember the importance of integration with the concrete conditions
 existing within each area and unit./
 We must remember the importance of our own experiences and traditions, for,
 since liberation, China's socialist enterprises already have a 30-year
 history and if one goes back to the foundations of the revolution, then we
 have a history of nearly half a century.  Within this time period we have
 amassed considerable experience in terms ofenterprise management and have
 developed our own fine traditions.   For example, from the very first days of
 China's socialist enterprise system, importance has been attached to
 ideological politics, to following the mass line and to introducing demo-
 cratic management.  All of these things represent our fine tradition and
 experience.  Today, on a foundation of summarizing and popularizing China's
 own experiences and traditions in this field, we must make more use of the
 experiences of other countries and thereby gradually build up a modernized
 and scientific socialist enterprise system which corresponds to China's
 specific needs and situation.

 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE URBAN YOUTHS WAITING FOR JOBS IN OUR
 COUNTRY AND UNEMPLOYMENT IN CAPITALIST COUNTRIES?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 46-47
 [Article by Chu Zhengkun [0443 2973 0981]]
 [Text] Outwardly there are some similarities between the urban youths
 waiting for jobs in our country at present and unemployment in capitalist
 countries, and yet these two aspects are different in nature.
 First, these two aspects have different origins and different natures.
 Unemployment is a natural product of the capitalist system.  Under the
 capitalist system, following the development of production and the improve-
 ment of the organic formation of capital, the proportion of changeable
 capital in gross capital is becoming less and less with each passing day
 and the demand on labor force by capital is also relatively decreasing.
 At the same time, the supply of labor force in general will increase
 following the development of capitalism.  The supply of labor force exceeds
 the needs of capital and this situation consequently gives rise to enormous
 unemployment.  At the same time, the existence of excessive unemployment
 constitutes an indispensable condition for the existence and development
 of the capitalist mode of production.  Therefore the existence of enormous
 unemployment forms an invisible pressure on employed workers while capital-
 ists make use of this situation to step up their exploitation of workers.
 In addition, a capitalist economy is characterized by cyclical crises and
 during these crises a great number of workers are sacked.   But on the other
 hand, during economic upsurges, many workers are employed again.  Capitalist
 production needs a reserve of industrial workers that are subject to
 exploitation at any time.  Therefore, the existence of unemployment is an
 objective need and a natural consequence of the capitalist system.  Marx
 termed this situation as a relative surplus of population.  That is to say,
 relative to the needs of the production of surplus value by capitalists, the
 supply of labor force exceeds demand, some workers cannot be included in the
 process of production and consequently they become "surplus" persons in..
 society.
 Ours is a socialist country that is based on the system of public ownership
 of production.   The purpose of our production is to meet the increasing
 needs of people's material and cultural life.  At the same time, socialism

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100360001-8
 practices a planned economy, and not only is the production of goods and
 materials carried out in a planned way, the growth of population is also
 put under control and these situations provide the possibility of..elimi-
 nating unemployment and solving the employment of all the laborers.  The
 present situation in which some young people in urban areas are waiting for
 jobs has been mainly caused by the mistakes we made over the past long
 period in our guiding ideology and work.  We are undertaking socialist con-
 struction in a country which is poor and yet with a huge population.  There-
 fore in order to solve the employment question, it is imperative to spare
 no efforts to develop production and at the same time to control the growth
 of population so that our population will grow according to plan.   But we
 made "leftist" mistakes in our guiding ideology for a long period in the
 past and made one mistake after another in our work.  On the other hand,
 the proportions of the national economy were seriously out of balance.  As
 a result, the development of our economic construction was slowed down to
 affect our ability to absorb the newly added labor force.  Furthermore, we
 did not pay enough attention to training laborers while our education was
 divorced from employment and this situation ha3 resulted in the fact that
 there are some jobs with no one to do them.  on the other hand, we did not
 pay attention to the proportionate development between the production of
 goods and materials and the growth of population.'  As a result, the develop-
 ment of production has been out of step with the growth of population.  This
 is the basic reason why at present some youths in urban areas are waiting
 for employment to be arranged for them.  With regard to ownership systems,
 for quite a long period in the past we only paid attention to the system of
 ownership by the whole people, neglected the system of ownership by the
 collective and squeezed and impaired the individual economy.  In the
 industrial structure, we paid attention to heavy industry and neglected
 light industry, commerce and service trades.,
 Such irrational ownership structure and industrial structure have seriously
 limited the employment of the newly increased labor force in urban areas.
 The policy of "unified guarantee, unified arrangement" for employment that
 has been implemented for a long time, has, resulted in a wrong understanding
 that only working in state-owned enterprises with an "iron rice bowl" is
 considered as employment and that individual operations and cooperative
 operations do not constitute employment.   Thus the road for employment has
 become narrower and narrower.   In fact, the situation in which part of the
 population in urban areas is waiting for jobs has no definite connection
 with the socialist system, nor is its nature that of surplus population as
 mentioned by Marx.
 Second, the two aspects have different methods for solving problems and
 different prospects.  Many years have passed since the bourgeoisie and
 their representatives declared that they would "eliminate unemployment" and
 "realize full employment"; but they have not done so,; nor is it possible
 for them to do so.  The bourgeoisie will be compelled to take some moderate
 measures and decrease unemployment to some extent only when the number of
 the jobless is so excessive as to cause serious social problems, large-
 scale strikes and to seriously threaten the capitalist politico-economic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 system. But they can in no way really solve unemployment.  In order to
 eliminate unemployment it is imperative to overthrow the capitalist system.
 The current problem of waiting for jobs in our country is a temporary
 phenomenon that is caused by mistakes in our work.  This problem can be
 completely resolved as long as we are able to correct our ideology, carry
 out correct principles and policies and display the advantages of the
 socialist system.  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
 Committee, the party and government have paid much attention to the problems
 of youths in urban areas waiting for jobs.  Finally, a series of correct
 principles and policies have been implemented such as readjusting the
 structure of the ownership system, developing the collective economy in a
 big way and appropriately developing the individual economy; readjusting the
 industrial structure, paying attention to the development of light industry
 and developing commerce and service trades in a big way; readjusting
 employment policy and opening up more ways for arranging employment.
 Thanks to these policies and measures, considerable achievements have been
 made.  From 1978 to 1981, employment has been arranged for 34 million people
 across the country.  Many medium and small towns across the country have
 basically resolved the problem of employment.  Of course, in order to
 thoroughly solve the problems of employment in our country, we must spare
 no effort to develop production and control the growth of population in a
 planned way so that the reproduction of population and labor force will
 accord with the development of the whole national economy.

 WILL STRENGTHENING OF PLANNING GUIDANCE IMPAIR THE DECISIONMAKING POWER OF
 PRODUCTION TEAMS?
 Beijing-RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 pp 47-48
 [Article by Zheng Youyun [6774 1635 7189]]
 [Text]  Some comrades regard respecting the decisionmaking power of produc-
 tion teams as contradictory to the implementLtion of state planned guidance
 over agricultural production.  According to their view, to respect the
 decisionmaking power of production teams means not to stress the importance
 of state planned guidance and'means that production teams must be allowed
 to arrange production by themselves and grow however much of whatever crops
 they want.  If stress is given to state planned guidance, the decision-
 making power of production teams will eventually be. impaired.   This view is
 one-sided and not correct.
 The socialist economy is a planned economy that is based on the system of
 public ownership.  Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy,
 therefore agricultural production and circulation must also be carried out
 in a planned way.  Our country has a population of 1 billion, of which 800
 million are peasants and therefore agricultural production occupies a
 particularly important position in the economic activities in our country.
 At present, about 80 percent of the daily necessity goods in urban and
 rural areas are agricultural and sideline products and goods processed from
 these products.; about.70 percent of the raw materials that are needed by
 light industry are supplied by agriculture while in our foreign trade,
 half of the revenue from foreign exchange is gained through :exports of
 agricultural and sideline products and goods processed from these products.
 In order to guarantee that the socialist economic construction can be
 carried out smoothly, and that agricultural and sideline products are
 distributed in a planned way and rationally while social needs are ensured,
 it is. imperative for the state to.keep a certain amount of agricultural and
 sideline products.  Consequently, -the production and sales of major agri-
 cultural products in various places must be included in state planning.
 The various departments of agricultural production such as agriculture,
 forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production.and fisheries produce many
 .items of their own and objectively there exist certain proportionate rela-
 tions among these production departments and production items.  Therefore
 it is necessary for the state.to consider natural conditions and economic

 conditions as well as the needs and possibility, and to do a good job of
 zoning so as to give planned guidance. over the production in various places
 and form a rational agricultural production structure.  At present, there
 are 6 million production teams across the country.  Most of these, production
 teams are basic accounting units.  The production quotas and work quotas
 that are assigned by production teams to individual peasants' households are
 carried out individually.  Therefore it is difficult for both production
 teams and peasant households to understand in an overall way the market
 situations of agricultural and sideline products and predict the development
 of these situations.  Consequently they also need state planned guidance so
 that they will not carry out production blindly.
 To stress the importance of agricultural production being put under the
 state planned guidance does not mean to abolish the decisionmaking power of
 production. teams.  By production team decisionmaking power we mean that
 the decisionmaking power of production teams must be put under state planned
 guidance.  The "Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on Certain Questions
 in Stepping Up the Development of Agriculture" points out:  "Under the
 premise of persisting in socialist orientation, implementing state policies,
 laws, and rules and regulations, and accepting state planned guidance, all
 the basic accounting units of the-people's communes have the right to carry
 out farming according to their specific conditions, to decide on measures
 for increasing production, to decide on management methods, to distribute
 their own products and cash, and to oppose any unrealistic directive from
 any leading body or leading person."  If we consider the decisionmaking
 power of production teams as a .way to depart from state planned guidance
 and to permit production teams to grow whatever crops they consider
 profitable, apparently this view is not in line with the spirit of the
 decision made by the CPC Central Committee about . the.decisionmaking power
 of production teams.  The state planned guidance we are talking about means
 following the needs of natural and economic laws, proceeding from reality
 and working out agricultural production plans according to specific condi-
 tions and all these accord with respecting the decisionmaking power of
 production teams.   The state now does not generally draw up plans for the
 acreage of crops grown by production. teams; it only defines the tasks of
 state purchase and assigned purchase of the major agricultural and sideline
 products that affect the national economy and people's life.   Under the
 premise of respecting the state planned guidance and fulfilling the tasks
 of state purchase and assigned purchase, production teams have.the right to
 arrange their own production.   It is groundless to think that while we are
 stressing the importance of planned guidance, we do not respect the
 decisionmaking power of production teams.
 Of course, there may appear to be contradictions between state planned
 guidance and the decisionmaking power of production teams.  For example,
 by proceeding from the overall situation, the state requires that all
 places that are suitable for growing grain crops must grow such crops,
 because it is only in this way that the grain that is needed by the state
 can be guaranteed.  This practice will also enable the places that are
 unsuitable for growing grain crops to undertake forestry or animal hus-
 bandry or when conditions permit, to grow industrial crops.   But as the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100360001-8
 price parity -between grain crops and industrial crops has yet to be
 rationalized,~the income from growing grain crops is lower than that from
 growing industrial crops.  As a result, production teams are not willing
 to grow grain crops rather than industrial crops.  Another example is that
 .thevstate requires production teams to sell greater quantities of some
 agricultural and sideline products; but production teams consider their own
 intermediate interests and consequently they are reluctant-to respond to
 such requirements.  In order to solve these contradictions,;it is impera-
 tive, on?the?one hand, to step up ideological and political work among
 cadres and peasants in production teams so as to help them foster the idea
 of "taking'the whole country into account" and correctly handle the rela-
 tions of interest among the state, the.collective and the individual.  On
 the other hand, while working out guiding planning, the departments con-
 cerned must step up study and investigations so that the planning may
 accord with reality.  When there.are changes in reality, the planning must
 accordingly be amended or measures must,be.taken to look after the interests
 of, .production teams and peasants so as.to,.minimize the difficulties involved
 in the production teams accepting state.planned guidance.

 AQUATIC BREEDING AND THE QUESTION OF EATING
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 16, 16 Aug 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Xing Xiangchen [0438 3276 5256]]
 [Text]  Statistics showed that 60 million tons of protein is needed
 annually throughout the world as food for mankind; of this figure, 40 per-
 cent is animal protein.  Fish is an important source of animal protein.
 At present, the average per capita world figure for aquatic products is
 33 jin while the figure in our country is less than 10 jin, and when
 shells, moss and damage are deducted from this figure, the average per
 capita figure is just over half a jin per month.  In order to solve the
 problem of feeding the 1 billion population in our country as soon as
 possible and to provide more and better protein for the urban and rural
 population, it is imperative to continue to develop grain production and
 improve the protein content of our grain crops and at the same time to
 spare no efforts to produce animal protein and develop animal husbandry
 and fishery.  In developing fishery, it is imperative to further utilize
 and exploit the resources of ocean and hinterland waters so as to develop
 aquatic breeding.
 The aquatic breeding industry in our country dates back a long time and has
 advantageous natural conditions.  Our country's coastline is more than
 18,000 kilometers long, with many rivers and much fertile water and there-
 fore it is suitable for fish propagation.  The area of continental-shelf
 fish-breeding grounds with a depth of less than 200 meters is 1.5 million
 square kilometers while the area of shallow sea and seashore that is suit-
 able for manmade breeding grounds is 7.4 million mu.  Our country is charac-
 terized by many rivers of various sizes and is dotted with lakes, ponds and
 reservoirs.  The number of rivers with an area of more than 100 square
 kilometers each is more than 50,000.  The total area of fresh water lakes
 is 36,000 square kilometers with the area suitable for fish breeding
 amounting to about 25 million mu.  The number of big, medium and small
 reservoirs is more than 82,000 while the area suitable for fish breeding
 is more than 30 million mu.  But of this enormous water area, only a little
 has been used for developing the aquatic breeding industry.   For example,
 the utilization rate of the 75 million mu of water in the hinterland is
 less than 60 percent; a great amount of water surface is yet to be

 low. For example, the average production of water ponds is only 113 jin
 per mu; the average production of lakes is less than 20 jin per mu while
 that of reservoirs is as low as only about 12 jin per mu.
 In order to supply more and better aquatic products for our people and
 solve the problem of "no fish to eat," it is imperative first of all to
 improve our understanding, step up leadership, correctly handle the rela-
 tions between grain and fishery production, put the latter on the agenda
 and do a good job in this respect.  It is necessary to follow the principle
 of "giving play to advantages and avoiding disadvantages," with breeding as
 the key and to combine breeding with catching.
 Second, it is necessary to sum up the experiences of aquatic breeding in our
 country and to popularize advanced technology.  We have many traditional
 breeding methods such as combining agriculture with animal husbandry and
 fishery to solve the problem of fodder, making use of low-priced agricul-
 tural and sideline products and their "rejects" and particularly to use
 grass and droppings as the main fodder for increasing aquatic products.
 This method is also in the interest of maintaining the ecological balance
 and protecting the environment.   In addition, we have also created such
 technical measures as mixed-breeding and coupled-breeding of various
 species and rotational catching and breeding that are important for
 increasing per unit output.  We must also import and popularize advanced
 science and technology from other countries such as net-box breeding, the
 warm-running-water breeding method and other new methods.
 Third, readjust fishery policy and develop many forms of aquatics produc-
 tion.  Some regions with certain conditions may concentrate their efforts
 on setting up a number of aquatic breeding bases.  Commune members, state-
 owned undertakings and collective undertakings must be encouraged to carry
 out fish breeding in some water areas that are scattered and where it is
 not easy to implement unified management.   Incomplete statistics from the
 five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Guangdong show that at
 present, more than 1 million peasant households are undertaking fish breed-
 ing.  With correct policy, this method of fish breeding will achieve better
 results with less investment.
 Fourth, step up the building of the ranks of technicians,  From the view-
 point of the whole national economy, there is a shortage of science and
 technology in our agriculture, but the shortage of technology in aquatic
 breeding is even more acute.  Therefore at present it is imperative to
 reorganize the ranks of aquatic technicians, set up a system and adopt all
 sorts of methods to train a planned and organized contingent of technicians
 that are both Red and expert.
