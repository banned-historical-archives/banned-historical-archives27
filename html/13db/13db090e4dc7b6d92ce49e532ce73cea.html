 SPAIN: EXECUTION AFTERMATH
 The enthusiastic pro-Franco rallies staged in
 Madrid and the provincial capitals this week will
 reinforce the government's decision to stand firm
 in its campaign against terrorism in spite of vehe-
 ment criticism from abroad. The storm of foreign
 protest over the execution on September 27 of
 five terrorists for killing policemen constitutes a
 major setback, however, to Spain's effort to
 achieve closer political, economic, and military
 relations with its European neighbors.
 Franco's short speech at a rally in Madrid on
 Wednesday was downed out by cheering
 crowds. The impressive attendance-estimated by
 the US embassy at over 200,000-reflects a
 patriotic backlash to foreign criticism. This out-
 burst of pro-Franco sentiment  and the
 government's anti-terrorism campaign are likely
 to make more difficult the transition to a more
 open system in the post-Franco period.
 In a televised speech to the nation on Tues-
 day night, Prime Minister Arias labeled Western
 criticism hypocritical and intolerable interference
 in Spanish affairs. In a further show of disdain for
 foreign sentiment, the government reportedly in-
 tends to bring to trial soon 15 more Basques, in-
 cluding the guerrilla leader accused of the
 assassination in 1973 of Premier Carrero Blanco.
 Despite this show of unity, rumors persist that
 several government ministers strongly opposed
 the executions and that major cabinet changes
 are in the wind.
 The few significant breaks in r,ublic order
 within Spain since the executions have been a
 fairly eff'ctive two-day general strike in the Bas-
 que provinces and the killing of four more
 policemen in terrorist attacks. Three of these ap-
 parently were well-coordinated attacks in
 Madrid. This brings to 16 the number of Spanish
 police killed by terrorists this year.
 The government's hope of reducing fore`g ,
 reaction by sparing the lives of 6 of the 11 con-
 demned terrorises was dashed by the widespread
 and vehement protests. The executions of the
 other five loosed deeply felt emotions among
 those West Europeans who see the Franco regime
 as the last remnant of fascism on the continent.
 East and West Europeans alike have voiced out-
 rage through official statements, withdrawal of
 ambassadors, mass demonstrations, and some
 violence.
 The governments of Western Europe are try-
 ing to limit the damage to their long-term
 relations with Spain, but moves to establish closer
 relations with the Franco regime are precluded
 for now. One of the first casualties will be the
 negotiations, scheduled to begin this month, to
 establish closer economic ties between Spain and
 the EC.

 French President Giscard has come under
 sharp criticism for his government's allegedly
 weak efforts on behalf of the Spanish terrorists.
 The F,cnch Communist Party, seizing the oppor-
 tunity to pose as a defander of Liberty after a long
 embarrassment over Portugal, has been extremely
 vitriolic and will do what it can to keep the issue
 alive. The Socialists have also protested
 vociferously, and even the center and right have
 been critical, although less inclined to blame
 Giscard personally.
 In the UK, leading government spokesmen
 have defended London's effort to obtain clemen-
 cy for the five terrorists. Union leader Jack Jones
 has called for a labor boycott o Spanish ships, air-
 craft, and trucks.
 Anti-Spanish sentiment has also surfaced at
 the UN. Delegates from Mexico and a number of
 East and West European counties boycotted a
 policy speech by the Spanish representative. The
 Security Council, however, rejected Mexican
 President Echeverria's request for an urgent
 Council sessio  t  consider suspending Spanish
 membership.
 FRAMCE
 DEFENSE SPENDING
 The US defense attache in Paris reports that
 proposed defense spending for next year will
 amount to 50 billion francs-the equivalent of
 about $11 billion dollars at current exchange
 rates. This is a 14-percent increase over this year's
 outlay for defense. The increase in real spending,
 however, will come to no more than 5 percent
 after inflation is taken into account. The Nationai
 Assembly will debate the proposal this month.
 Defense Minister Bourges said earlier this
 year that France could not keep its forces at pre-
 sent levels and also put his reform program into
 effect unless the 1976 defense budget grew by at
 least 20 percent. President Giscard reportedly
 settled on 14 percent after he had heard from the
 Page 2      WEEKLY REVIEW    Oct 3, 75
 rr:1nister of finance. Most of the budget increase
 probably will be used to cover the cost of pay
 raises and other personnel benefits ordered
 earlier this year to alleviate morale problems in
 the armed forces.
 Operating costs will absorb about 58 percent
 of the military budget, up 2 percent from 1975.
 This growing imbalance is causing problems on
 the capital expenditures side of the budget, and
 the government will have to re-evaluate its
 priorities for new military hardware. All branches
 of service will feel the effects. Even so, France has
 one of the most ambitious  defense spending
 programs in Europe, and the percentage of spen-
 ding devoted to hardware purchases probably
 will still top that of many of France's neighbors.
 The nuclear programs will retain a most-
 favored status. Nearly one third of all equipment
 funds will go for these programs with more going
 to the strategic programs than the tactical ones.
 An increase in funds has also been authorized for
 France's Pacific nuclear test center, probably
 because of the higher cost of underground
 testing.
 The air force will order 33 of the new Fran-
 co-German Alpha Jet trainers for delivery begin-
 ning in 1970, and the tactical air forces will get 10
 more Anglo-French Jaguar fighter-bombers.
 Budgeting for future aircraft programs will be
 kept to a minimum, and the fate of the next
 generation ACF fighter and a proposed
 long-range transport will remain in doubt.
 The navy will receive two new conventionally
 powered attack submarines, and construction on
 several new frigates and corvettes will continue.
 Money reportedly has been authorized to begin
 construction of France's first nuclear-powered at-
 tack submarine, and design work on a nuclear-
 powered helicopter carrier will continue. The
 navy will slow its purchases of Super Etendard at-
 tack aircraft and adc'itiona! Exocet anti-ship mis-
 siles.
 Little information has been released on
 procurement pl-,ns for the ground forces. The
 army apparently will get some money for im-
 proved Hawk surface-to-air missiles.

 ROMANIA AND YUGOSLAVIA: CHINA TIES
 Ceausescu and Tito seem to be working
 together to expand their contacts with China and
 thus to counter what they regard as Moscow's
 "hegemonist" aspirations.
 An unprecedented number of high-level
 Romanian delegations-five at last count-went
 to China last month. They were led by such rank-
 ing officials as the party secretary for cadre affairs,
 the secretary for economics, the head of military
 intelligence, and a deputy defense minister.
 These visits-coming in the wake of fresh
 assaults on Peking by the Kremlin-underscore
 Romanian determination to resist any Soviet
 pressure to read the Chinese out of the inter-
 national communist movement. They also suggest
 a high degree of confidence that Ceausescu will
 be able to cope with the irritation that the visits
 are certain to cause in Moscow.
 While the Romanians were in Peking,
 Belgrade was making the final arrangements for a
 long-delayed upgrading of its contacts with
 China.  Premier Bijedic-the highest ranking
 Yugoslav ever to make an official trip to
 Peking-is scheduled to arrive on Monday for a
 six-day wit.
 just prior to Bijedic's departure, his Roma-
 nian counterpart went to Belgrade to set up a
 mid-October meeting between Tito and
 Ceausescu. Their talks will probably center on still
 further cooperation that could be read as a
 message of defiance in Moscow.

 AUSTRIA: TO THE POLLS
 Austrians go to the polls on October 5 to
 determine whether Socialist Chancellor Bruno
 Kreisky will retain his mandate l'--)r another four
 years. The Socialists probably w;1i obtain a plurali-
 ty, but Kreisky's hope to retain the majority he
 won in 1971 is in some doubt. If he narrowly mis-
 ses a majority, he may form a minority govern-
 ment, as he did in 1970, or co-opt selected
 members of other parties into a "government of
 experts."
 Although gene Ily opposed to a coalition
 government, Kreisky may have to consider the
 possibility if the gap is more than a few seats short
 of a majority. The tiny Liberal Party would be his
 most likely partner and Kreisky probably would
 only consider a "grand coalition" with the
 People's Party as a last resort.
 The scarcity of issues has made for a dull cam-
 paign. With the possible exception of the
 economy and one or two regional questions,
 most talk has centered on personalities.
 The problem with the economy is that after
 nearly six years of boom, moderate inflation and
 marginal unemployment have begun to stir up
 discontent. The fuel crisis in 1973 marked the
 beginning of a gradual decline in economic
 growth rates. Although inflation is well below that
 of most industralized countries-Austria's rate
 was 8.3 percent in June--dissatisfaction among
 consumers is widespread. Unemployment is
 about 2 percent, also below the West European
 average, but one of the most debated issues in the
 campaign.
 Kreisky began an anti-inflationary stabiliza-
 tion program in 1972. He has emphasized that he
 will not create more unemployment in order to
 curtail inflation. The main thrust of the op-
 position's campaign, nevertheless, is the specter
 of greater joblessness.
 A few regional issues have played a small part
 in the campaign. Delay in completion of the
 country's south autobahn has annoyed Austrians
 and tourists alike, but the government probably
 will plead austerity on this issue. Kreisky's failure
 to provide bilingual road signs in Carinthia has
 alienated the Slavic minority in that state, but may
 win some support from the German-speaking
 majority there. No significant foreign policy elec-
 tion issues have surfaced.
 Kreisky.
 like his predecessor, is on an intellectual par with
 Kreisky's challenger is the chairman of the
 People's Party, 42-year-old Josef Taus, who was
 elected after the accidental death of Karl
 Schleinzer in July. Taus-a self-made man from a
 working class family-has general appeal and, un-

 POLAND: TAKING THE PULSE
 Since the Central Committee plenum a
 month ago, party chief Gierek has spent several
 days touring the provinces, making speeches, and
 conferring with local officials. Some of this activity
 has been related to preparations for the party
 congress next December, but Gierek has also
 been testing the mood of the people and seeking
 to justify the regime's economic policies.
 Leadership and popular interests most clearly
 converge on the crucial question of when and
 if-but mainly when-Warsaw will raise food
 prices that are still being held at the !970 level.
 The regime may now believe it can no longer
 keep the price lid on.
 For several months, Polish leaders have made
 no secret that subsidies to food industries are in-
 creasingly straining the state budget, and the US
 embassy reports that Polish media have been told
 to prepare the people "drop by drop" to accept
 the fact that Poland is "not an island in the sea of
 inflation."
 Warsaw will probably have to act very soon
 on the price freeze or wait until after Christmas.
 Polish leaders vividly remember December 1970,
 when food price hikes helped to topple the
 Gomulka regime.
 Popular reaction will be negative no matter
 when the freeze is lifted, and public disturbances
 like those provoked by the meat shortages last
 spring could result. In an effort to head off trou-
 ble, the leadership might decide on compen-
 satory actions such as wage or pension increases.
 Although the regime points to an increase of
 40 percent in average real wages over the past five
 years, these figures do not necessarily impress
 Polish workers. Gierek is nonetheless holding out
 the promise of significant increases in average
 real wages during the next five-year plan.
 Poland has also suffered chronic shortages of
 meat (mostly pork), and this spring popular dis-
 satisfaction reached its highest pitch since 1970.
 Since then, Warsaw has decreased exports, in-
 creased imports, and raised prices paid to farmers
 in an effort to generate more production. Short-
 ages nonetheless persist, and Gierek is keenly
 aware that statistics showing significant increases
 in meat consumption often fail to persuade con-
 sumers that progress is being made when there is
 n,) meat on the table. He has even admitted that
 an appreciable increase in consumption might
 not satisfy demand and indicated "there might be
 some more troubles here."
 There are troubles elsewhere, too. The
 regime has built more than a million apartments
 in the past five years, and promises even greater
 performance in the next five-year plan. Gierek
 recently admitted, however, that the progress is
 "small" when measured against the needs of the
 people, and that the regime cannot afford a
 greater effort. Increasing absenteeism and ex-
 cessive labor mobility have led to production
 losses and have become common themes in the
 Polish media.
 On balance, the Polish leadership must feel
 that it is on a treadmill. The more it ac-
 complishes-and there has been significant
 progress--the more the population demands. The
 crucial question is whether Warsaw can keep up

 LEBANON: SHAKY TRUCE
 The latest fighting followed the shooting
 deaths on September 30 of eight people, at least
 three of whom were members of the Druze sect,
 in a Christian suburb of the capital. Progressive
 Socialist Party leader Kamal Jumblatt, a Druze,
 blamed the shooting on the Phalangists and
 demanded that the killers be turned over to the
 authorities. The Druze have in the past tended to
 side with the Shia Muslims.
 Fighting in Beirut between Christian and left-
 ist militias flared up again in midweek after
 several days of relative calm during which the
 cease-fire announced last week appeared to be
 finally taking hold. A collapse of the fragile truce
 would probably bring to a quick end the current
 reconciliation talks among the leaders of
 Lebanon's numerous competing factions.
 The 20-man national reconciliation com-
 mittee under the leadership of Prime Minster
 Karami has thus far focused largely on ser..ri;y
 issues. Agreements were reached early in the
 week to remove barricades and end sniping and
 kidnaping. After the incidents on October 1,
 however, barricades went back up in many areas
 and a number of people were kidnaped.
 Problems raised by the make-up of the com-
 mittee, which includes 10 Muslims and 10
 Christians, could complicate the talks. Conser-
 vative Shia Muslims and some Christians claim
 they are underrepresented. The leftists, however,
 are opposed to any attempt to increase the com-
 mittee's membership. The committee has put
 aside, at least temporarily, the troublesome ques-
 tion of Lebanese-Palestinian relations, which had
 been raised by Phalangist leader Pierre Jumay-ril.

 The US embassy in Beirut reports that sub-
 stantial damage has been done to the capital dur-
 ing the latest round of fighting. The damage to
 the commercial and industrial areas alone is es-
 timated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The
 middle class, made up of shopkeepers and other
 self-employed businessmen, has been particularly
 hard hit. About one quarter of this group is said to
 be on the verge of destitution. The embassy now
 estimates that since the fighting broke out in late
 August at least 500 persons have died.)
 INDIA: EXTERNAL MATTERS
 The military-led coup in Bangladesh in
 August was a distinct setback for India, costing
 New Delhi the strong influence it had exerted in
 Dacca since Bangladesh became independent in
 1971. It now appears Prime Minister Indira
 Gandhi's government may be unwilling to stand
 idly by while the new regime in Dacca seeks to
 balance its foreign relations and establish ties with
 India's adversaries, China and Pakistan.
 The desire of Bangladesh's new leaders for a
 more balanced foreign policy is clearly viewed
 with suspicion by New Delhi. The Indians see ear-
 ly recognition of the new regime by Pakistan and
 China as part of a scheme aimed at introducing an
 element of uncertainty for India on its eastern
 flank. Dacca is aware of New Delhi's distrust and
 has tried to reassure the Indians that the In-
 do-Bangladesh friendship treaty, signed in 1972,
 is still a cornerstone of Bangladesh's foreign rela-
 tions.
 Developments in Bangladesh probably have
 also contributed to a downward trend in In-
 do-Pakistani relations. Two sets of bilateral
 negotiations-one related to the design of an In-
 dian dam that will affect Pakistan's water supply
 and another on the restoration of civil air
 flights-are now deadlocked. Additionally, the in-
 termittent propaganda war between New Delhi
 and Islamabad has heated up, and the two coun-
 tries are engaged in a bitter contest for a two-year
 term on the UN Security Council.
 In contrast, Indo-US relations could be on
 the upswing. On October 6-7, Foreign Minister
 Chavan will be in Washington to inaugurate a
 bilateral commission aimed at expanding
 relations in the fields of economic, commercial,
 educational, cultural, scientific, and technological
 affairs. Gandhi's bid for closer relations
 presumably is motivated largely by the economic
 relationship.
 incentive for increased US aid and trade, but also
 by a desire to demonstrate that India remains a
 nonaligned state despite its strong ties with the
 USSR. Nonetheless, Gandhi's basic suspicion of
 US intentions and activities abroad and her sen-
 sitivity to Western criticism of her authoritarian
 rule stand in the way of a truly harmonious

 RHODESIA. NATIONALISTS SPLIT
 Rivalry among factional leaders of the
 Rhodesian African National Council, the umbrella
 organization formed by four black nationalist
 groups last year, has pulled the council apart. A
 national congress in Salisbury last weekend
 elected Joshua Nkomo, a moderate who favors
 negotiating a settlement with Prime Minister Ian
 Smith's white regime, to the council presidency.
 Other council leaders condemned the national
 congress as illegal and scheduled a rival congress
 for October 19.
 Nkomo's election by several thousand
 delegates who convened in the Rhodesian capital
 lends some support to his claim that his faction
 controls a majority of the council's local branches
 inside Rhodesia. Nkomo faces bitter opposition,
 however, from Ndabaningi Sithole, the militant
 leader of an important rival faction that has long
 wanted to scrap settlement talks and resume
 all-out guerrilla warfare in Rhodesia. Bishop
 Muzorewa, who was installed as a compromise
 figurehead president of the council when it was
 formed in December 1974, also vehemently op??
 poses Nkomo's bid for leadership. Although
 Muzorewa has advocated a negotiated settle-
 ment, his breach with Nkomo has sealed his
 dependence on Sithole and the other militant ex-
 iles.
 Bishop Muzorewa
 Las: month Muzorewa expelled Nkomo from
 the council for setting up the recent congress
 over Muzorewa's objections. The presidents of
 Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Botswana,
 who have been trying to unify the council for
 talks with Smith, subsequently met with the
 Rhodesian nationalists in Lusaka, but were unable
 to heal the rift.
 The reaction of the four presidents to
 Nkomo's election is not yet known, but it will be a
 critical test of their cohesion. There have been in-
 dications that Zambia's Kaunda, who does not
 want new fighting in Rhodesia because it would
 intensify his country's economic problems, and
 pE:r'-:aps President Khama of Botswana, might
 accept Nkomo. It is doubtful, however, that
 Kaunda and Khama could persuade Tanzanian
 President Nyerere and Mozambique's Machel,
 who have had closer ties with Sithole's faction, to
 go along.
 At this point, the four presidents probably
 have no firm ideas about how to proceed. They

 During the past several weeks insurgent ac-

 tion.
 ETHIOPIA: UNREST GROWING
 Faced with strikes by disgruntled workers, the
 ruling military council this week issued a tough
 state of emergency declaration in Addis Ababa.
 The coercive tactics forced most of the strikers to
 resume work, but the council has apparently
 widened the breach between it and influential
 leftist union elements. Meanwhile, insurrections
 fed by conservative landlords are posing an in-
 creasingly serious threat to the council's control
 of the northern provinces.
 Labor leaders for some time have been dis-
 satisfied with military rule and the council's
 failure to satisfy specific labor grievances. On
 September 22, the Confederation of Ethiopian
 Labor Unions, the country's central labor
 organization, adopted a resolution threatening a
 general strike unless power was returned to
 civilian hands within a month. The resolution also
 said workers would strike if any confederation
 leaders were arrested or if the council attempted
 to interfere with distribution of the resolution,
 which is highly critical of the military leadership.
 Late last week at least seven workers were
 killed and 19 wounded in a clash with security
 forces who were attempting to arrest airline
 employees for distributing copies of the labor
 resolution. In a separate incident, the council also
 arrested about 30 teachers for distributing an-
 ti-regime leaflets. In response, workers in Addis
 Ababa began leaving their jobs, but the council's
 crackdown prevented a general strike. The
 sweeping emergency proclamation, issued on
 September 30, permits the arrest of all strikers
 who do not return to work, the search of homes
 w;'hout warrants, and the detention of individuals
 for an unlimited period without charges.
 Begemdir and Tigre are the home provinces,
 respectively, of former general Nega Tegegne and
 Ras Mengesha Seyoum, two important tribal
 leaders. They fled Ethiopia last year and have con-
 tacted other former officials about planning a
 resistance movement. Some of the recent dissi-
 dent activity was almost certainly carried out by
 their followers. The US embassy, in fact, recently
 received information that Ras Mengesha has
 returned to Tigre.

 Le Duan and Chairman Mao during recent meeting
 CHINA-VIETNAM: SIGNS OF COOLNESS
 A North Vietnamese delegation, led by party
 chief Le Duan, apparently ran into heavy sledding
 in talks with its Chinese hosts during a visit to Pe-
 king last week.
 Although agreements were signed on trade
 and the provision of an interest-free loan to
 Hanoi, signs of coolness between the two sides
 were evident throughout the visit. Chinese press
 coverage was less enthusiastic than it was during
 Le Duan's last visit in 1973, and the speeches on
 both sides reflected differences of view-notably
 regarding Moscow's role in Vietnam and
 Southeast Asia. Most significantly, no joint com-
 munique was issued at the end of the visit, and
 the North Vietnamese failed to host a reciprocal
 banquet for the Chinese.
 The reference to an interest-free loan in the
 economic agreement is itself new and suggests
 that Peking no longer feels an obligation to
 provide Hanoi with non-refundable aid. This con-
 trasts sharply with Peking's attitude toward the
 new communist regime in Cambodia, to which
 the Chinese only two months ago agreed to
 provide grant aid.
 The question of sovereignty over the Paracel
 and Spratly islands in the South China Sea may
 also have upset the discussions in Peking. Just
 prior to the delegation's departure for Peking,
 two Chinese broadcasts to Vietnam underscored
 Peking's claims to both island groups.
 Moreover, there are some indications that
 the Chinese may be prepared to use the issue in
 open polemics. Party cadre in Hong Kong were
 recently briefed on a new slogan-"Liberate
 Taiwan and the Spratly Islands"-whose target is
 Hanoi. The briefing officer said that Peking had
 adopted "a much harder line" with Hanoi and
 suggested that the slogan might be made public
 soon.
 Le Duan returned to Hanoi after the China
 trip, and a few days later departed for Eastern
 Europe.
 The Soviets will si:reiy try to take advantage
 of current Hanoi-Peking differences to improve
 their own influence in Hanoi and will offer at least
 matching economic assistance.
 THAILAND: MUSICAL CHAIRS
 The desire of newly retired army commander
 Krit Siwara to remain a power in Bangkok by
 assuming a high-level cabinet post has created
 serious strains in the Khukrit coalition govern-
 ment. It seems likely that General Krit's political
 ambitions will force Prime Minister Khukrit to
 shuffle his cabinet and possibly realign the ruling
 coalition as well.
 Krit is lobbying for the defense portfolio. He
 sees the position as a means of retaining his in-

 fluence in the army, protecting his considerable
 financial interests, and furthering his political am-
 bitions.  Krit's plans, however, have run into a
 serious snag. The current defense minister,
 Praman Adireksan, has made it clear that he is not
 prepared to step aside to make room for Krit.
 Prime Minister Khukrit is in a difficult situa-
 tion, because he cannot afford to alienate either
 Krit or Praman. Krit was instrumental in bringing
 together the various conservative factions ir sup-
 port of Khukrit last April. Praman, on the other
 hand, heads the Thai Nation Party, the third
 largest in the National Assembly and a key
 member of the coalition. He is threatening to pull
 his party out of the government if Krit is given the
 defense portfolio.
 Khukrit has announced that he will not shuf-
 fle his cabinet until the budget bill is passed by
 the National Assembly; this should take place
 within the next two weeks. By postponing choos-
 ing between Praman and Krit, Khukrit probably
 hopes each wi!I use his considerable influence in
 the National Assembly to ensure passage of the
 budget.
 If Praman does thwart Krit's desire to become
 defense minister, Khukrit's most likely option
 would be to offer Krit another cabinet post. While
 it is possible that the Krit-Praman clash could
 bring down the governing coalition, Khukrit
 would almost certainly come out on top of any
 Assembly.
 JAPAN-CHINA: TREATY DEADLOCK
 Talks in New York last week between
 Japanese Foreign Minister Miyazawa and his
 Chinese counterpart, Chiao Kuan-hua, failed to
 break the impasse on a peace and friendship trea-
 ty. Tokyo is reluctant to subscribe fully to the an-
 ti-hegemony clause both sides agreed to in the
 1972 communique establishing diplomatic
 relations; the Chinese remain uncompromising.
 At the outset of the treaty talks last January,
 Tokyo tried to exclude a ..Iause.opposing "third
 party" hegemony in Asia because of its anti-Soviet
 overtones. Since then, the Japanese have been
 seeking a compromise that would reposition,
 rephrase, or redefine the clause. In May, for ex-
 ample, Tokyo offered to place the clause in the
 preamble rather than in the text of the treaty;
 Peking refused. Last week, Miyazawa proposed
 that both sides issue separate protocols to the
 treaty spelling out their respective interpretations
 of anti-hegemony. Chiao again refused, insisting
 that a unified definition was essential.
 Chiao, however, did agree to consider
 Miyazawa's overall presentation and respond at a
 later date, thereby maintaining the semblance of
 a dialogue. Both sides still want to conclude a
 treaty, but the prospects for an early resolution of
 the hegemony issue are poor. China's un-
 willingness to blunt the thrust of the an-
 ti-hegemony clause is directly linked to its an-
 ti-Soviet strategy-a key element of Peking's
 foreign policy that has become especially sen-
 sitive since the fall of South Vietnam. In view of
 the publicity the hegemony clause has attracted,
 Tokyo would find it exceedingly difficult to yield
 completely. The Soviets and, more importantly,
 an appreciable number of Japanese would accuse
 the government of capitulating to the Chinese.
 The Chinese maintain that relations with
 Tokyo will not be set back by failure to conclude a
 treaty and that progress in cementing ties is being  25X1
 made in other areas. Indeed, consular and fishing
 agreements were recently announced.
 Peking seems to prefer to shelve the treaty
 rather than compromise on the anti-hegemony
 issue. In Peking's view, further inter,sive dis-
 cussions at this point would probably
 highlight-rather than resolve-the differences.
 The Chinese may also believe that more can be
 extracted from Tokvo over the longer term.
 Japanese Prime Minister Miki remains under
 some self-generated pressure to conclude a trea-
 ty, but he too may decide to mark time-if the
 alternative    is    capitulation    to
 Peking.

 CAMBODIA: DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY
 The communist regime in Phnom Penh has
 stepped up its diplomatic activity recently in an
 apparent effort to broaden its international con-
 tacts.
 France
 Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs
 leng Sary told newsmen in Paris in
 mid-September that he wanted to normalize
 Cambodian-French relations "in the near future"
 and that Paris could play an important role in
 Cambodia. Although the French are still miffed
 over the treatment their people received when
 the communists took over Phnom Penh, they are
 nevertheless eager to re-establish their presence
 in Cambodia. The French intend to treat Prince
 Sihanouk cordially when he stops in Paris early
 this month on his way to New York to address the
 UN, and talks on re-establishing relations could
 well be in the offing. The Cambodians probably
 regard France as a potential aid donor.
 Thailand
 'There has also been progress in the develop-
 ment of Cambodian-Thai relations. Officials of
 the two countries have held meetings in New
 York, and the Thai foreign minister announced
 recently that a high-level Cambodian of-
 ficial-either Foreign Minister Sarin Chhak or
 possibly leng Sary-had agreed to visit Bangkok,
 probably in late October. Topics on the agenda
 will include the establishment of diplomatic
 relations, trade, and probably border security
 problems, and the status of Cambodian refugees
 in Thailand as well.
 Special Friends
 The North Vietnamese ambassador to Cam-
 bodia arrived in Phnom Penh on September 19.
 The Chinese ambassador arrived earlier in the
 month. There are also signs that Phnom Penh may
 receive other envoys from friendly communist
 and nonaligned countries. Diplomatic sources in
 Peking have claimed that Cambodia will allow the
 end
 opening of ten embassies in the capital by the North
 of the year. The others: Yugoslavia, Egyp , Korea, Algeria, Albania, Romania, Mauritania,
 and Laos. The North Koreans have already es-
 tablished a presence in Cambodia.
 USSR
 The Cambodians will proceed carefully in
 working out new relationships with Moscow. Ties
 between the USSR and the Khmer communists
 have been strained and tenuous, as indicated by
 Moscow's refusal to break relations with the Lon
 Nol government until the last days of the war.
 Deputy Prime Minister Khieu Samphan and
 Sihanouk met with Soviet representatives in
 Hanoi in early September, but there has been no
 indication that the dialogue will be continued
 soon.
 Other Moves
 The Cambodian embassy in Peking has also
 begun to acknowledge earlier recognition of the
 Khmer communist regime by several non-com-
 munist countries. Letters have been sent thanking
 the governments of Australia, Japan, and other
 non-communist Asians. Although the Japanese
 consider that relations have been re-established,
 they are proceeding cautiously and have no
 near-term plans to follow up on Phnom Penh's
 response on recognition. The establishment of
 Cambodian-Mexican relations at the am-
 bassadorial level was also recently announced,
 following a brief visit by leng Sary to Mexico City
 in mid-September. Despite the appearance of a
 more forthcoming Cambodian attitude, it will
 probably be some time before ambassadors from
 non-communist countries are permitted to reside
 in Phnom Penh. The Khmer communists are
 highly suspicious of "foreign" influence and do
 not want non-communist diplomats in Phnom
 Penh at this ea                on conditions in
 the county .

 CHINA: A RESTRAINED NATIONAL DAY
 National bay ceremonies this year were
 more subdued than usual. For the first time in
 four years, there was no authoritative editorial

 festivities were marred by the absence of ailing
 Premier Chou En-tai.
 Most national leaders were on hand f%, a

 Senior Vice Premier,Teng Hsiao-ping, who
 served as host at the reception, emphasized

 cussion of the ancient Chinese novel Water

 territory's future.
 The pro-Indonesia forces, even with the aid
 of Indonesian special forces units, apparently
 have been no match for Fretilin's troops. For the
 short term, Fretilin has the upper hand and may
 soon decide to announce Portuguese Timor's in-
 dependence.
 Suharto, for his part, is still standing firm
 against the desires of the Indonesian military to
 send large numbers of Jakarta's troops into Por-
 tuguese Timor.
 The large turnout at the reception reveal-
 ed some new appointees to the national
 military hierarchy. Former chief of staff Lo
 Jui-ching, who was rehabilitated without an of-
 f icial post two months ago, has apparently join-
 ed the, national military, apparatus. Another
 rehabilitated official with close ties to Teng has
 also gained a central military post, reflecting
 Teng's continuing efforts to consolidate his
 power in the military. In addition, several
 military men who until recently were serving in
 the provinces have apparently been named to
 positions in the national rr)ilitary structure.
 Several former cultural and propaganda
 officials made their first public appearance
 since the Cultural Revolution of the mid-1960s.
 These were second-echelon bureaucrats, but
 their rehabilitation adds weight to reports that

 among the earliest victims of the Cultural

 BRAZIL'S TRADE INITIATIVE AT UN
 Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio Azeredo
 da Silveira is continuing efforts to focus world
 attention on his proposal to reform trade relations
 between the developed and less-developed
 nations.
 During the past month, Silveira has made two
 speeches to the UN  General Assembly
 recommending that a new framework be es-
 tablished for conducting bilateral negotiations.
 Silveira argues that there is a growing need to give
 less-developed countries effective access to in-
 dustrial markets and at the same time guarantee
 developed nations adequate supplies of raw
 materials. AVthough his initiative has been
 moderate in tone-apparently designed to por-
 tray Brazil as a constructive spokesman for the
 less-developed countries-it constitutes a marked
 departure from the low profile Brazil usually
 maintains in international forums.
 PERU: SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY
 The military government today celebrates its
 seventh anniversary-under new leadership and
 amid signs of important administrative changes
 affecting the pace and style of the revolution. At
 the same time, President Morales Bermudez faces
 many of the same political and economic
 problems, including intra-military rivalries and
 labor unrest, that stymied his predecessor.
 Since taking office August 29, Morales Ber-
 mudez has indicated his administration will tackle
 Peru's many problems with more flexibility and
 Page   18
 WEEKLY REVIEW   Oct 3, 75
 There is reason to believe that Silveira is
 largely representing his own views and not
 necessarily those of the Brazilian government.
 During his assignment as head of Brazil's delega-
 tion to the UN office in Geneva from 1966 to 1969,
 Silveira reportedly favored the use of large
 deliberative bodies to resolve trade issues. Also,
 he is not known to have obtained wide support
 within the government prior to his appearances at
 the UN, nor has he followed up with specific
 plans for implementing his proposals.
 The fact that Silveira has come back to the
 subject twice within a three-week period suggests
 that he at least has the backing of President
 Geisel. Brazil, as an emerging world power, can
 appreciate the major concerns of industrialized
 nations and can understand common problems of
 economic growth among the less-developed
 countries. Brasilia may now see its international
 role as a mediator between competing in-
 terests.

 less personalism than did President Velasco. Over
 the longer term, this approach is likely to yield
 some success in building greater popular support
 for the armed forces and in providing the govern-

 bureaucracy. For the time being, however,
 Morales Bermudez will be pressed to convince
 more radical officers that his new economic
 policies, including a 12.8-percent devaluation,
 will reverse recent setbacks and that this and
 other measures will not increase civilian antipathy
 for the military.
 The devaluation, announced last week by the
 new civilian economy minister, is a sharp depar-
 ture from Velasco's policy. The former president
 was particularly sensitive since the previous
 devaluation by civilian president Belaunde had
 figured prominently in his ouster by the armed
 forces in 1968. Morales Bermudez' own economic
 expertise-he served as economy minister from
 1969 through 1973-and his currently strong
 military support should afford him sufficient time
 to undo some of the economic excesses of the
 Velasco administration.
 The President's plan for streamlining the
 cumbersome military bureaucracy in order to
 create a more efficient policy mechanism and
 allow top officials more time to concentrate on
 long-range policies includes measures to weaken
 some of the prerogatives of the presidency. A
 likely offshoot of this program will be a greater
 role for civilians in setting government policy.
 Morales Bermudez' concern for maintaining sup-
 port of the radical officers at least for the time be-
 ing may cause this process to move slower than he
 would like, but some further loosening of
 restraints on political and journalistic freedom is
 likely.
 Reported maneuvering by less extremist of-
 ficers to get the President to move against more
 radical officers is indicative of the mistrust and
 ideological disagreement present beneath the
 facade of military unity. Like his predecessor,
 Morales Bermudez is certain to have difficulty in
 balancing these various factions and personalities.
 For the time being, the President's desire and
 need for solid military backing for his domestic
 programs will probably cause him to seek some
 compromise. He may be counting on the success
 of economic and political liberalization measures
 to enable him to resist pressure from the radicals.
 A more immediate problem for the President
 is the threat to the viability of his economic
 programs posed by recalcitrant labor groups.
 Many of the unions are led by leftists who de-
 mand frequent and sizable wage increases and
 other unrealistic concessions by the government.
 At this time, Morales Bermudez can probably
 count on solid military support in resisting labor
 opposition, but other military leaders-particular-
 ly those who strongly supported Velasco-might
 go into opposition if prolonged or serious

 ARGENTINA: CAMPORA RETURNS
 Former president Hector Campora has
 returned to Argentina, undoubtedly hoping to
 cash in on the growing confusion and fragmenta-
 tion within the Peronist movement.
 Campora, at one time tha darling of the
 Peronist left, reportedly promised the govern-
 ment that he would stay out of politics if allowed
 to return ' from exile in M' 'co. He specifically
 ruled out any dealings w,n the dissident Au-
 thentic Peronist Party, from which he dissociated
 himself last July.
 It will be difficult for Campora to remain out
 of the political limelight for very long. Although
 his spokesmen announced that he had no
 political plans, Campora could not resist telling
 reporters on September 27 that he had come back
 to be "a factor of unity" and characterizing
 himself as a "man of involvement. Two days later
 he issued a platitudinous statement invoking the
 name of Juan Peron and offering his services "to
 the cause of the people."
 Campora's presence undoubtedly is viewed
 with disquiet in conservative Peronist and military
 circles. They recall the extreme leftist influence in
 the government and the indignities the armed
 forces suffered during Campora's six-week
 presidency in May-July, 1973.
 Loyal Peronists will also remember that from
 his deathbed Peron ordered Campora fired from
 his ambassadorship in Mexico and expelled from
 the Justicialist Party. Peron's move came after
 Campora hurriedly returned to Buenos Aires to
 sniff the political wind upon learning that the ag-
 ing dictator was seriously ill.
 Campora will have to exercise extreme
 political and personal circumspection. He will
 need to eschew leftist connections and keep off
 the target lists of the right-wing death squads who
 earlier threatened to assasshiate him. Campora
 probably will try to appeal first to the middle road
 of Peronism. Because he is unlikely to find sup-
 port there, he will be susceptible to blan-
 Hector Campora
 dishments from the left wing, which badly needs a
 figure of national prominence as a rallying point.
 The 66-year-old Campora has survived the
 rough and tumble of Peronist politics for over 30
 years, and he may gradually be able to rebuild his
 political fortunes. He is a pompous, loquacious
 man, however, and easily manipulated. He may
 be drawn too soon into the political arena, and his
 try for a political comeback will be short-lived.

 CHILE NO RELAXATION
 Actions of the past week leave little prospect
 that the government will soon relax its tough
 stance on security or its ban on politics.
 When a dozen former Allende officials were
 released on September 12, it was announced that
 some charges remained pending against them.
 Now the navy has begun proceedings against at
 least six of these persons, including Luis Corvalan,
 secretary general of the Cc.mmunist Party, on
 charges of "subversion."
 The Ministry of Interior also announced that
 the Christian Democratic Party-Chile's
 largest-will not be permitted a voice in running
 the government. The statement came after public
 airing of correspondence between two party
 leaders, which in effect reaffirmed the party's
 desire to reach an understanding with the military
 government so that the country eventually could
 return to traditional democratic processes. The
 government's reaction was a categorical rejection
 of any possible constructive dialogue with the
 party on this basis. The government's statement
 raised the threat of punishment for activity con-
 trary to terms of the political recess.
 One effect of the statement will be to com-
 plicate President Pinochet's proposal  on
 September 11 to form a "council of state," com-
 posed of former presidents and prominent
 Chileans, to advise the government. Former presi-
 dent Frei, the most prominent Christian
 Democrat, will find it even more difficult to par-
 ticipate now that his party has been so strongly
 rebuffed.
 Internally, these issues will have little lasting
 effect. On the international scene, however, they
 come at a bad time for Chile. Efforts to improve its
 standing will be severely damaged. Belgium, West
 Germany, and the UK hope to sponsor a resolu-
 tion in the UN condemning Chile's human rights
 stance. Denmark, France, Luxembourg, and
 several other countries apparently approve the
 Belgian draft.
 In yet another effort to improve its image
 abroad. Chile has begun a campaign to have the
 1976 OAS General Assembly held in Santiago. The
 regime believes that if Chile succeeds in these ef-
 forts, representatives of the American nations can
 see for themselves that Chile's enemies have ex-
 aggerated the human rights issue.
 CANADA: EAST COAST FISHING
 Ottawa won approval last week from the
 International Commission for Northwest Atlantic
 Fisheries for its attempt to protect declining
 fishery stocks off Canada's east coast and to prop
 up the faltering Canadian fishing industry.
 The 17-na'ion body, which includes the US
 and the USSR, unanimously accepted Canadian
 proposals to:
 ?  Reduce the number of fishing days.
 ?  Impose stricter quotas on declining
 species.
 ?  Allocate a higher percentage of the
 overall catch in the area to Canadians.
 The agreement covers the Atlantic continen-
 tal shelf off Canada, one of the world's largest
 Canada's Fishing Shelf

 fishing areas. The region consists of a series of
 shallow plateaus, the largest of which is the Grand
 Banks, and extends up to 400 miles off the New-
 foundland coast.
 The total catch in this area has dwindled
 steadily in recent years. Last year, 2.1 million
 metric tons were taken, clown 20 percent from the
 1968 peak. The decline is mainly the result of
 overfishing by foreign fleets. Cod catches have
 slumped over 50 percent since 1968.
 Foreign fleets currently land 65 percent of the
 fish caught on the Canadian banks, compared
 with 35 percent in the mid-1960s. Some 900
 foreign vessels currently fish in these waters, com-
 pared with about 200 Canadian ships. The USSR
 has increased its activity dramatically in recent
 years and now operates a fleet of 400 ships in
 Canadian waters. It takes the largest single catch,
 amounting to 40 percent of the total. Spain, Por-
 tugal, and France, which have fished the banks for
 over 500 years, land 15 percent of the total catch,
 with minor shares going to Poland, West Ger-
 many, and Norway. US vessels seldom fish in the
 area.
 Bearing the Brunt
 The declining catch is a particular hardship
 for Canadian fishermen. Their total landings have
 fallen 40 percent since 1968, a period ?n which the
 foreign catch dropped only 5 percent. Last year,
 the Canadian catch was below the 1963 level, and
 so far this year the catch has not been much
 better. Last year, the fishing industry suffered the
 greatest reverse registered by any Canadian in-
 dustry. In February 1975, Canadian trawlers were
 losing an average of $5,000 per voyage; process-
 ing plants were operating at only 60 percent of
 capacity.
 Newfoundland and New Brunswick have
 been hit very hard. Landings in the two provinces
 have fallen by half since 1968; landings in Nova
 Scotia and Prince Edward island have fallen 20-40
 percent.
 Over the last five years, Ottawa has uni-
 laterally restricted foreign fishing in its territorial
 seas, in the Gulf of $ t. Lawrence, and in the Bay of
 Fundy. These restrictions-aimed primarily at
 France, Portugal, and Spain-are still in effect.

 Only US fishermen are now permitted to operate
 freely in these areas.
 Ottawa is trying to extend its controls to
 cover waters beyond the 12-mile limit. To limit
 Soviet activity, Ottawa in July banned the USSR's
 fishing fleet from Canadian ports. The Soviet shut-
 out was ended a week ago when the Soviets
 agreed to support the Canadian position before
 the international commission and to set up a
 bilateral commission to deal with fishing
 problems.
 Ottawa is unlikely to declare a 200-mile
 fishing zone before the session of the Law of the
 Sea Conference next year. The new measures
 should ease growing domestic pressure to make
 such a declaration. Furthermore, the Trudeau
 government fears that a unilateral move now
 would undermine its attempt to win concessions
 at the Law of the Sea Conference. At that meeting
 Ottawa will ask for special rights in the Arctic and
 special  regulation  of  the  salmon
 CUBA: PROMOTING PUERTO RICO
 Prime Minister Fidel Castro gave further
 evidence in a speech this week that his govern-
 ment intends to uphold the Cuban position of
 promoting Puerto Rican independence even at
 the risk of slowing the accommodation with the
 US.
 In endorsing this position, he lent his per-
 sonal prestige to an issue that has become a major
 stumbling block in the path of normalizing
 relations with the US. His remarks apparently
 were intended as a response to what he labeled
 "strong statements" by US officials.
 In a speech devoted largely to internal affairs,
 Castro spoke briefly about Puerto Rico and the
 US. He implied that Cuban solidarity with the
 cause of Puerto Rican independence is a matter of
 principle that will not be renounced in order to
 improve relations with the US. He added, "If that
 is not understood, we will know how to be as
 patient as necessary."                   25X1
 Contrary to some press accounts of the
 speech, Castro did not depart from the now-stan-
 dard Cuban position regarding Puerto Rico.
 Nothing that he said indicated a retreat from his
 stated willingness to begin negotiations with the
 US to settle bilateral differences.           25X1
 The Soviets are trying to persuade Castro to
 play down his Puerto Rican campaign. Moscow,
 along with other communist governments, fears
 that Cuba's actions could jeopardize its prospects
 for detente with the US. At the Puerto Rican
 Solidarity Conference in Havana last month, the
 head of the Soviet delegation tried repeatedly to
 dissociate the Soviet-controlled World Peace
 Council, the ostensible host, from responsibility
 for sponsoring the conference. He also reportedly
 tried to tone down the more excessive draft
 resolutions and persuaded the other delegates
 not to specify a date for a future conference.
 There may be more flexibility in the Cuban
 position than appearances suggest. In the final
 analysis, rather than risk torpedoing the chances
 for a normalization of relations with the US, the
 Castro regime would probably accept some for-
 mula that would trade a temporary softening of its
 Puerto Rican independ               for US
 negotiating concessions.
