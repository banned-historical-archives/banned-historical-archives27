 BREZHNEV'S STANDING HAS BEEN GROWING
 STEADILY.   HE APPEARS AT LEAST TO BE FIRST
 AMONG EQUALS,
 BUT THE MAJOR DECISIONS, BY AND LARGE, ARE
 APPARENTLY REACHED BY COMPROMISE, AND
 IMPLEMENTED WITH CAUTION,
 THIS TYPE OF COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP ELIMINATES
 THE ERRATIC INITIATIVES KHRUSHCHEV WAS NOTED FOR,
 AND IT REDUCES THE CHANCES OF MAKING BIG MISTAKES,

 IV1   THE IMPORTANT CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN FROM EVERYTHING WE
 KNOW ABOUT THE SOVIET MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT IS THIS:
 A.        THE SOVIETS CONTINUE TO INCREASE THEIR MILITARY
 BUPGET AND THEIR EFFORT TO ACHIEVE A MAJOR
 BREAKTHROUGH,
 OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, THE RESULTING IMPROVEMENTS
 ARE GOING TO GIVE THE SOVIET LEADERS INCREASING
 CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE CREATING AN EFFECTIVE
 DETERRENT, IN THE FORM OF A MILITARY MACHINE WHICH
 CAN UNDERGO NUCLEAR ATTACK, AND STILL DELIVER, ENOUGH
 PUNCH TO DESTROY A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE
 PQPULATION AND RESOURCES OF THE UNITED STATES,
 WR DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE SOVIETS THEMSELVES
 EXPECT TO BE STRONG ENOUGH--EVEN OVER THE NEXT
 TEN YEARS--TO CONSIDER THE DELIBERATE INITIATION
 OF A WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES,
 BUT GROWING CONFIDENCE IN OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE
 CAPABILITIES IS ONE OF THE FACTORS WHICH COULD LEAD
 TO DISASTROUS MISCALCULATIONS WHEN TWO COUNTRIES ARE
 TRYING TO FACE EACH OTHER DOWN, AT THE BRINK OF A WAR
 WHICH NEITHER MAY WANT,

 V.   I WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON JUST TWO FACETS OF SOVIET
 FOREIGN POLICY--RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED ~TATES, AND
 THE SING-SOVIET DISPUTE.
 VI.  IN PUBLIC, SOVIET SPOKESMEN ARE TAKING THE LINE THAT
 ANY IMPROVEMENT IN U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS IS GOING TO
 BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AS LONG AS WE ARE ATTACKING
 THEIR COMMUNIST BRETHREN IN NORTH VIETNAM,
 As            THIS IS NOT ONLY A USEFUL BARGAINING POSITION
 WHICH TENDS TO MAKE Ua COMES TO T E , BUT THEY
 ARE;, PRACTICALLY FORCED TO TAKE THIS STAND BECAUSE
 THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS ARE ACCUSING THE KREMLIN
 OF WORKING WITH THE UNITED STATES AGAR NORTH
 VIETNAM,
 B.   IN FACT, HOWEVER, SOVIET LEADERS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR
 THAT THEY WANT TO AVOID ANY SHOWDOWN WITH WASHINGTON
 OVER THE VIETNAMESE ISSUE.
 C.   THEY ARE, OF COURSE, DELIGHTED TO SEE MAJOR PORTIONS
 QF OUR FORCES TIED DOWN IN VIETNAM, BUT THEY ALSO
 REALIZE THAT THEY MUST, KEEP THEIR LINES TO WASHINGTON
 OPEN AND WORKING, IF THEY WANT ANY PROGRESS ON THE
 ISSUES THAT REALLY CONCERN THEM--SUCH AS EUROPEAN
 SECURITY, ARMS CONTROL, GERMANY  ANq EAST-WEST TRADE.
 As YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN SOME PROGRESS ON ISSUES

 BETWEEN MOSCOW AND PEKING HAVE HIT ROCK-BOTTOM, AND WE
 DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANY IMPROVEMENT AS LONG AS THE
 PRESENT LEADERSHIPS REMAIN IN CONTROL AT VACH END OF
 THE LINE,
 A.   THE; CHINESE HAVE BEEN DOING. THEIR BEST IN RECENT
 WEEKS. TO. GOAD MOSCOW INTO A FINAL BREAK IN
 DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,
 THEY HAVE EASED UP A BIT ON THEIR VIRTUAL
 SIEGE OF THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN PEKING.. BUT
 THEY HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THAT. THEY CAN
 FORCE EVERY LAST RUSSIAN OUT OF CHINA WHENEVER
 THEY DECIDE TO DO SO,
 B,
 MOSCOW IS TRYING TO HANG ON, AND BUILD A RECORD WHICH
 CAN BE USED TO PIN THE BLAME ON THE CHINESE IF IT
 COMES TO A FINAL BREAK,
 WHAT IS AT STAKE IS THE SUPPLY LINE TO NORTH VIETNAM.
 EACH COUNTRY WANTS TO BE ABLE TO PROVE. THAT IT IS
 THE MAJOR SUPPORT OF THE NORTH VIETNAMESE, AND THAT
 THE OTHER COUNTRY IS JUST SITTING ON ITS HANDS, IF NOT
 ACTUALLY HINDERING THE WAR EFFORT,

 GENERALLY, COME IN 0 E   N )-t. ACRO   CHINA,
 3,     TO A GREAT DEGREE, THIS IS BECAUSE OF SOVIET
 RELUCTANCE TO RISK A CONFRONTATION WITH THE
 UNITED STATES ON THE HIGH SEAS,
 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE CONFRONTATION THE
 CHINESE COMMUNISTS WANT TO BRING ABOUT,
 MOSCOW HAS CHARGED THAT THE CHINESE ARE DIVERTING,
 DELAYING, SABOTAGING, STEALING, AND EVEN RE-LABELING
 SOVIET WAR MATERIEL PASSING THROUGH CHINA TO VIETNAM,
 THE CHINESE, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE ACCUSED MOSCOW OF
 "COWARDICE" FOR REFUSING TO SHIP BY SEA,  PEKING
 PROBABLY BELIEVES THAT IN A PINCH, THE SOVIETS WOULD
 STILL REFUSE, AND PEKING COULD THEN TELL THE WORLD
 COMMUNIST PARTIES THAT RUSSIA HAD ABANDONED THE
 NORTH VIETNAMESE, RATHER THAN FACE UP TO AMERICAN
 SEA POWER.

 OF COURSE, BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN CHINA KNOWS THAT "A

 II,   To US   IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS, BUT FOR THE CHINESE IT IS IN
 DEADLY EARNEST.

 CHIEF OF STATE, LIU SHAO-CHI, TO RECITE MAO QUOTATIONS
 FROM MEMORY, AND RIDICULED HIM WHEN HE FLUFFED A LINE,
 THIS IDOLATRY OF MAO IS THE KEYSTONE OF THE CULTURAL
 REVOLUTION,
 A.       MAO, AT 73,  IS AGING, SICK, AND MORE AND MORE INFLEXIBLE,.
 H~ IS OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT HIS COMMUNIST PARTY IS
 LOSING THE REVOLUTIONARY ZEAL OF ITS EARLY DAYS, AND
 CANNOT BE RELIED UPON TO KEEP CHINA ON THE RIGHT TRACK
 AFTER HE IS GONE,
 1,            THE TEEN-AGED MILLIONS OF THE REIN GUARD ARE SUPPOSED
 TO RE-KINDLE THAT ZEAL WITH THEIR UNBRIDLED AND
 UNCRITICAL ENTHUSIASM,
 To MAO, THEN, THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION IS PRIMARILY A
 DRIVE TO RE-INVIGORATE THE COMMUNIST PARTY, OR EVEN TO
 REPLACE IT WITH A MORE RELIABLE, MORE FANATICAL,
 YOUNGER VERSION,
 C.       BUT FOR THE MEN WHO ARE COMPETING TO SUCCEED MAO,  IT HAS
 CIIC(~M BECOME A   KED STRUGGLE FOR POWER AND FOR SURVIVAL,

 SINCE NOVEMBER AND THE ASCENDANCY OF CHOU.

 WE CAN BE FAIRLY SURE OF:
 ==FIRST, UNTIL MAO GOES AND A NEW LEADER HAS TAKEN
 FIRM CONTROL, CHINA'S LEADERS ARE GOING TO BE DIVIDED
 AND IN CONFLICT.  THEY WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO AGREE
 TO ANY NEW POLICY LINE, SO WE DO NOT EXPECT
 ANY RAPICAL DEPARTURES FROM EXISTING POLICIES,
 ==SECOND, FOR SOME TIME TO COME, THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS
 WILL PROBABLY SUFFER FROM A CULTURAL REVOLUTION HANGOVER
 THAT CQULD LIMIT THEIR CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN FOREIGN
 ADVENTURES,
 ==AND THIRD, WHOEVER WINS, WE CAN SEE NO REASON TO EXPECT
 ANY DILUTION OF PEKING'S IMPLACABLE HOSTILITY TOWARD

 SOUTHEAST ASIA
 I.          OBVIOUSLY, THEN, WE CANNOT DISMISS OUT OF HAND THE
 POSSIBILITY OF A SHOOTING WAR WITH COMMUNIST CHINA,
 AND THE NATIONS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE EVEN MORE
 REASON TO BE APPREHENSIVE.
 A.  IN THE TIME THAT REMAINS, I PROPOSE TO TAKE A
 QUICK LOOK AROUND SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND THEN WIND UP
 WITH SOME NOTES ON THE VIETNAM PROBLEM.
 THERE ARE TWO FACTS THAT CHINA'S IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS
 HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND. (MAP
 A.  ONE IS THAT SOUTHEAST ASIA IS NORMALLY A RICE
 SURPLUS AREA, WHILE IN CHINA, OVER THE PAST
 NINE YEARS, THE POPULATION HAS GROWN BY 20 PERCENT
 WHILE FOOD PRODUCTION HAS EITHER STOOD STILL OR--
 IN BAD YEARS--DECREASED. LESS THAN 15 PERCENT
 OF CHINA IS ARABLE,
 THE SECOND FACT IS THAT HISTORICALLY, AT ONE TIME
 OR ANOTHER VIRTUALLY EVERY ONE OF THE SMALL NATIONS
 SOUTH OF CHINA HAS BEEN A PART OR A VASSAL OF
 CHINA--ONE REASON THEY CALLED IT THE "MIDDLE
 KINGDOM," BECAUSE TO THE ANCIENT CHINESE IT WAS
 THE CENTER OF THE WORLD.

 RECENTLY, THE ZOO-- MILLION PEOPLE OF INDONESIA,
 WITH EXTENSIVE POTENTIAL RESOURCES AND IMPORTANT
 STRATEGIC GEOGRAPHY, WERE SLIDING SLOWLY BUT
 SURELY INTO THE GRASP OF PEKING,
 1.   THE CHINESE DIDN'T HAVE TO BUILD A SINGLE
 LANDING CRAFT, OR MAKE A BELLIGERENT GESTURE.
 THEY SIMPLY BUILT UP THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF
 INDONESIA, SUPPORTED AND GUIDED IT, AND CONVINCED
 PRESIDENT SUKARNO THAT CHINESE COMMUNISM WAS
 THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE.
 2,              THE PRO-WESTERN INDONESIAN ARMY HAD ALMOST
 BEEN NEUTRALIZED; THE ANTI-COMMUNIST POLITICAL
 PARTIES HAD BEEN BANNED OR PLACED UNDER TIGHT
 CONTROLS; AND THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY WERE UNDER
 PRO-COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP, WHEN A BADLY TIMED
 AND BUNGLED COUP ATTEMPT GAVE THE ARMY LEADERS
 A CHANCE TO TURN THE TABLES.
 3.   TODAY, THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDONESIA HAS BEEN
 SHATTERED, AND GENERAL SUHARTO HAG ALMOST COMPLETED
 THE DELICATE AND DIFFICULT JOB OF TAKING AWAY
 ALL POWER FROM SUKARNO,  THIS HAS BEEN TIME-CONSUMING

 B.
 INSTEAD, I THINK THE MILITARY SITUATION CAN BE
 SUMMARIZED THIS WAY: SINCE AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS
 WENT IN IN THE MIDDLE OF 1965, WE HAVE TAKEN THE
 INITIATIVE AWAY FROM THE COMMUNISTS AS FAR AS MAIN
 COMBAT FORCES ARE CONCERNED; WE HAVE PREVENTED THEM
 FROM MASSING TO LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE: AND WE HAVE
 INFLICTED HEAVY CASUALTIES,
 LAST YEAR THE COMMUNISTS LOST 56,P00 KILLED IN
 ACTION, BY ACTUAL BODY COUNT, AND ANOTHER 20,000
 TURNED THEMSELVES IN,
 YET OUR ORDER OF BATTLE SHOWS THAT THP ENEMY HAS
 MARE MEN THAN EVER UNDER ARMS--THE MAIN COMBAT
 FORCE CONSISTS OF 21 NORTH VIETNAMESE AND 12 VIET
 REGIMENTS--MORE THAN 130,000 MEN IN ALL.   THE
 CONG
 PARA-MILITARY GUERRILLA FORCES BRING THE TOTAL UP
 TO AT LEAST 300,000.
 THE INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE COMMUNIST COMMAND HAS
 DECIDED IT IS TOO COSTLY AT PRESENT TO FIGHT MAJOR
 MILITARY ENGAGEMENTS AGAINST SUPERIOR FIRE POWER
 AND AIR SUPPORT, SO THEY ARE GOING TO JRE-EMPHASIZE
 CLASSIC GUERRILLA WARFARE,

 NOW THERE ARE EVEN MORE BATTALIONS, AND WE ARE

 TO BE A COALITION OF ALL REBEL PATRIOTIC ELEMENTS,
 REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL OF THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE PEOPLE,
 IT HAS FIVE VICE CHAIRMEN--AND AT LEAST THREE OF THE
 FIVE ARE KNOWN COMMUNISTS.
 IV. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE COMMUNISTS KNOW THAT THEY CAN
 NO LONGER WIN BY TERRORISM O , BY FORCE OF ARMS IN SOUTH
 VIETNAM; THEY CAN ONLY WIN BY WAITING US OUT, BY HOPING
 THAT THE FREE WORLD FORCES WHICH DEFEND SOUTH VIETNAM--
 AND THAT MEANS MAINLY THE UNITED STATES--WILL TIRE OF THE
 WAR AND PULL OUT, OR BE FORCED OUT BY WORLD PUBLIC
 OPINION1
 THIS HOPE EXPLAINS WHY THEY SHOW NO READINESS TO
 NEGOTIATE.  IT SUSTAINS THEM---AND AT THE SAME TIME, IT
 IS THEIR ULTIMATE VULNERABILITY, BECAUSE IF WE CAN
 MAKE IT CLEAR TO THEM THAT THERE IS NO SUCH HOPE,
 THAT THE BEGINNING OF DEMOCRACY IN SOUTH VIETNAM ARE
 GOING TO BE DEFENDED, NOT DESERTED--THEN HANOI TOO
 WILL FINALLY BE FORCED TO REALIZE THAT THIS PARTICULAR
 BALL GAME IS OVER.
 AT THIS POINT,  I PROPOSE TO SKIP GEOGRAPHICAL ORDER,
 AND JUMP TO CUBA, BECAUSE TODAY THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE
 BRANDS OF COMMUNISM--RUSSIAN, CHINESE, AND CUBAN--WHICH
 POSE A THREAT TO US, AND FIDEL CASTRO'S EFFORTS TO SPREAD
 HIS REVOLUTION IN THIS HEMISPHERE CAN BE PARTICULARLY
 VIRULENT AND VIOLENT.
