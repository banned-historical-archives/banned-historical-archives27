There are no firm indications of ultimate Communist inten-
tions regarding conclusion of a Korean cease-fire. In contrast 
with their assertions of a year ago which claimed that UN forces 
would be driven from the peninsula, the Communist conduct of 
negotiations and their propaganda in the past few days have struck 
a balance between conciliation and belligerency, suggesting 'an 
expectation of some form of cease-fire agreement. Meanwhile, 
there has been a continuing improvement in the enemy's military 
position, particularly in the development of his air potential. 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT WEAKENING UNDER COMMUNIST PRESSURE . . . Page 7 
Recent events in urma reveal that the stability of the 
Burmese Government continues to deteriorate a a result of milia 
tary weakness and increa ing political subversion. Thi e progressive 
disintegration of the Rangoon regime's position is leading to 
Communist control of Burma. The Government's hypersensitivity to 
leftist criticism forestalls any effort to dbtain aid and advice 
from the Western democracies.

The importance of the Conservative Party victory in the 
British elections and of.Churchill'a return to power lies for 
western Europe in the impetus given to the rightist trend on the 
Continent. On balance, the effects of ChurchiWs vittolty will 
probably be more psychological than tangible. The initialenthusi-
astic reaction in Western Europe will undoubtedly be dulled as the

The Soviet hold on Communist China may already be, or may soon 
become, o strong as to preclude a successfUloaaaertion of indePend-
ence by the Peiping regime. The USSR has 'been steadily developing a' 
system of controls in Communist China to reduce Peiping's capabili-
ties for independent action. Even if Peiping chooses to reject the 
Soviet demand for subordination of national interests to Moscow's 
global ? objectives, it is gtestionable whether the Chine e could re-
tain control of their entire territory, expel Soviet personnel and 
eradicate Soviet influence.

THE SOVIET WORLD 
In the course of functions commemorating the 34th Anniversary of 
the October Revolution, Moscow,s spokesmen placed unusually strong em-
phasis on Soviet strength and warned the West against an attack on the 
USSR. Although claims of Communist strength are customary in comment 
on this anniversary, the tone of this year's output was more militant 
and the emphasis on capitalist encirclement was more pronounced. 
Politburo member L. P. Beriya, in his keynote address at the Bol-
shoi Theater, cautioned Western leaders not to construe the USSRgs de-
sire for peace as a sign of weakness and repeatedly recalled the Nazi 
invaders' defeat by the Soviet Union at a time when it was much less 
prepared than et present. Another world war, he said, would result in 
the destruction of capitalism. Marshal Malinovsky echoed Beriyags re-
marks the next day at the parade in Red Square when he declared that 
Soviet forces were prepared to meet any attack fully armed." 
The sole hint in Beriya,s speech that the Soviet Government might 
be prepared for negotiations with the West came in an assertion that a 
"basis for agreement" with the West continues to exist. Beriya cited 
the mutual benefits to be obtained from unrestricted East-West trade, 
non-aggression pacts and a disarmament treaty. 
Probably because of the Kremlin's increasing concern over Western 
rearmament the USSR, through various channels, has revealed an ostensible 
interest in great power negotiations. However, feelers from certain 
quarters in the West have so far elicited no favorable response from 
Moscow. 
French President Auriolle suggestion for a big four conference is the 
only one of such feelers to receive any attention in the Soviet press 
and this in the form of criticism that it was not "specific" enough. The 
Kremlin's propaganda organs charged that Auriol had by-passed such vital 
questions as the North Atlantic Treaty, American bases encircling the 
Soviet Union, US rearmament and the remilitarization of Germany and 
Japan. Implicit in these Soviet press comments was a lack of interest 
in big-power talks that do not provide for outright negotiations on the 
rearmament issue and all related questions. 
In contrast to all other Eastern European Satellites tho Rumanian 
Government has announced that its over-all industrial production goals

for the third quarter of 1951 have been fulfilled. According to the 
Rumanian announcement all major production'categdvies2 except build-
ing construction and food and timber products, exceeded their goals. 
Coal and petroleum goals were fulfilled by 102.9 percent, electric power 
by 105.1 percent and transport by 118.7 percent. The announced Rumanian 
industrial successes are in line with Voroshilov's Liberation Day speech 
in August which lauded Rumanian advancements under the guidance of the 
Soviet Union. 
According to a Bulgarian press announcement, Politburo member Titko 
Chernokolev, who was dismissed from his post as Minister of Agriculture 
in June, has been expelled from the party. It was also made known that 
Chernokolev, as well as three deputies of the Bulgarian National Assemb1y2 
had been removed from their parliamentary posts. Since these officials 
have lost their legislative immunity by this actions it is possible that 
they may soon be involved in a political trial in Sofia. Bulgaria thus 
becomes the third European Satellite where current evidence suggests 
that important trials may soon be held -- Poland and Czechoslovakia 
being the other two. 
The Czechoslovak Government has enacted a Defense Training bill 
which will require that premilitary and civil defense training be in-
troduced into mass organizations. A Union for Cooperation with the Army2 
corresponding in name and functions to the USS1Ps DOSAAF, has been es-
tablished to implement the mass defense training program through 
affiliated organizationsp such as the Red Cross, the Peoples Mi1itia2 
amateur flying groups, and SOKOL (the national sports organization). 
The army is to furnish the Union and its affiliates with instructors2 
training cadres, and materials. 
There is evidence that the Rumanian port of Constanta is being de-
veloped as an alternate to the Polish port of Gdynia for Satellite ship-
ments to China. Exports from Eastern Europe to China, which have in-
creased sharply in the past year, have apparently overtaxed Polish  
shipping and port facilities.

COMMUNIST INTENTIONS IN KOREA 
Current intelligence offers no firm indications of ultimate 
Communist intentions regarding a cease-fire in Korea. Although the 
enemy's conduct of cease-fire negotiations and his propaganda have 
recently suggested an expectation that an agreement on the cessation 
of hostilities will eventually be reached, his pronouncements continue 
to strike a balance between conciliatory and belligerent themes. Mean-
while, a continuing improvement of the enemy's military position in 
Korea and contiguous areas has been observed. 
From the date of Chinese Communist intervention in Korea until 
the Spring of 1951 the stated objective of Communist forces was the 
forcible expulsion of UN troops from all of Korea. This position had 
ceased to be made explicit some weeks prior to Maliks cease-fire pro-
posal of late June 1951, and has not been stated categorically since, 
although it presumably remains the Communist long-range objective. 
The most nearly reliable gauge of Communist intentions in Korea has 
been the prevailing tenor of their propaganda which has attempted alter-
nately to prepare for either successful negotiations and a cessation of 
military operations or failure of negotiations and a prolonged conflict* 
For most of the past month, enemy propaganda has emphasized the first 
possibility, attempting to prove that Communist forces haye attained 
their objectives in Korea, that the US has suffered an unprecedented 
defeat, that the battle-lines are in the vicinity of the 38th Parallel, 
and that there are no insuperable obstacles to successful negotiations* 
At the same time, Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai have asserted that 
Feipingts offer to settle the Korean question by peaceful means "still 
holds. good," but have cautioned that support for the "long-term struggle" 
is still the "central tasks" Thus, even if the complex problem of a 
cease-fire is resolved, subsequent negotiations may see the reaffirma-
tion of the enemy's original objectives. 
Ranking Chinese Communist leaders have recently stated that Chinese 
"volunteers" mould not have been dispatched to Korea if the US had not 
"occupied" Formosa, "invaded" Korea, and pushed toward Manchuria, and 
that Peiping's objective in Korea remains that of defending the terri-
torial integrity of China* More ominously, Soviet Foreign Minister 
Vyshinsky at the Paris UN meeting has again put forth unacceptable pro-
posals regarding the 38th Parallel and withdrawal of foreign troops as 
,part of a Korean peace plan* These statements clearly permit renewal 
?of the earlier explicit demand for abandonment by the US of its policy 
Of "neutralization" of Formosa and for withdrawal of all foreign troops 
from Korea.

Ambguous political indications of a desire for an armistice have 
not been reflected in Communist military activity, with their air and 
ground forces continuing to improve their capabilities. 
The major--and possibly the most decisive--improvament in the 
Communist strength has been in their air potential. Enemy air activity 
over North Korea expanded during 1951 and has now reached a point where 
effective UN superiority over northwestern Korea has been denied. There 
has also been a decided improvement in pilot ability. Chinese pilots 
have been noticed supplementing Soviet personnel who previously carried 
the main burden of enemy air combat, An effective air defense system 
now exists in northwestern Korea including daylight jet interceptors, 
night interceptors, probably utilizing radar, radar directed antiaircraft 
artillery, and an integrated early warning ground-controlled intercept 
radar net, Communist air strength in Manchuria is at an all-time high 
with about 500 MIG-15 jet aircraft, and enemy jets have recently begun 
operations from a Korean border airfield. Active preparations to base 
aircraft at other operational Korean airfields continue. 
Communist troop strength has been maintained at about the maximum 
which can be logistically supported, and new units have :appeared since 
the cease-fire talks began. The enemy has attempted to overcome his 
decided inferiority in weapons and firepower by introducing heavier 
equipment. At the time of the Chinese intervention, he had no effective 
armored force, but three armored divisidn4--partia1ly equipped with tanks 
heavier than the familiar T-34--are now accepted in Korea. Firepower 
has also been increased by the addition of a Chinese Communist anti-tank 
division, and by a considerable increase in organic North Korean divie. 
sional artillery. Four, or possible five, Chinese Communist artillery 
divisions, possessing some conventional rocket Weapons, are presently in 
support of front line troops. Antiaircraft strength, estimated to exceed 
six Soviet-style antiaircraft divisions, is disposed at strategic points 
throughout CoMMunist held territory. 
All evidence points to a continuing adequate supply situation to 
support current military operations. Morale among the enemy forces 
varies from good to excellent, with certain exceptions among units that 
have been heavily engaged during the past month. 
Nhile the problem of logistical support probably prevents the intro-
duction of additional Chinese Communist elements, individual replacements 
continue to maintain existing units at or near strength. Major units 
that have lost their combat effectiveness have been replaced by fresh 
units from China and Manchuria, Chinese Communist strength in Manchuria 
has been maintained at a fairly constant level and presumably is available 
for commitment in Korea in the event of need,

Although the Soviet Union has avoided publicly associating itself 
with the Communist cause in the Korean war?other than by giving limited 
diplomatic and propaganda support?Soviet covert participation has in-
creased considerably during the summer and fall of 19510 It has included 
the continuous supplying of war material and of large numbers of Soviet 
military personnel, tentatively estimated by FECOM at 200000, serving in 
both technical and combat capacities in rear areas. The effect has been 
to bolster Communist technical capabilities. 
There continues to be no evidence, however, that the Soviet Union 
plans to employ its considerable Far Eastern military forces openly in 
Korea. In the event of such intervention, the Russians could commit up 
to 15 infantry divisions and sufficient air power to ensure Communist 
air supremacy. The USSR is increasing its offensive capability in the 
Far East by the conversion of conventional fighter air regiments to high 
performance jet fighters. 
All current indications point to a continued strong enemy defense 
in depth. The Communists are believed to be preparing a series of defen-
sive positions extending as far north as the Wonsan-Pyongyang line. In 
western Korea, theTretain a considerable offensive potential, supported 
by armor and artillerY; hoWver, recent UN interdiction of supply lines 
has restated in some deterioration of this potential. There are no indi-
cations, however, that offensive action, other than limited defensive 
counter and spoiling attacks, will be launched in the near future.

BURMESE reliERITMEZIT rvIHArciaTTTIG UNDER C OT2UNTST PR7SSURE 
7.ecent event' in Perna reveal that the stability of th6 Purme,e Govern-
ment continues to deteriorate as a result of military weaknese and inereav-
ing political subversion. This progressive disintegration or the Rangoon 
regimes position is leading to Communist control of Burma. 
The Burma Communist Party has progressed substantially toward its im-
mediate objectives. Communiet military forces have successfully eluded the 
Burmese Army- in moving toward the Chinese frontiers, and have been able to 
accelerate their operations. In addition, Communist efforts to reach an 
understanding with other insurgents are apparently beginning to bear fruitj 
moat significant in this respect is a reported agreement with the Karene in 
3outhern Parma to cooperate in military campaigns. 
The Government seems helpless to prevent the Communists from eoneolidat-
. 
eing control over large areas of northern Burma., from which a southward drive 
may be launched with materiel support from. the Chinese Communiete0 
An equally eerious danger to the Government is the increasing strength 
and altivity of overt leftewing political elements. The Burma Werk ere and 
Peasants Party? which aetaally repreeente the Communist, Party eeevageoands, 
is constantly and effectively attacking the Gevernments domestie and foreign 
policies. Not only is this group eteadily gaining adherente, but it has late-
ly formed a ntriple alliance with two other influential leftist political 
parties. Because of it superior erganieation, popular program and support 
from the Chinese and Soviet Embaosiee, this party wills, in all likelihoods, 
dominate the coalition and seek to tranaferm it into aa overt counterpart of 
the underground ?Pecplee.Demoeratic Front.," into which the Burma Communist 
Party is attempting to attract the several insurgent factions 
&noeer pnlitical threat lies in the activities of U Ba Sue, Secretary 
Oeneral of the Parma Socialist Party ani ]eader of that partygs large proe 
Communist element. He is said to be dissatiLfied with the moderate Socialist 
leadership in the Government and is maneuvering for the Premiership. In order 
to aehieve his ambition it is entirely possible that he will effeet a rapproche-
ment between his left--ng Socialist followers ald the reams., ':ionkere and Deaeante 
Party. 
Should Pa Swe become Premiers, the Burmese Governmentve drift, to the right 
would be abruptly reversed, British and American influence would-be reduted to 
a minimum, closer relations with Communist China muld be developed -- as has 
been repeatedly recommended by the Purmeee Ambassador to Peiping -- and the 
prospects of early Communist domination of Burma would be greatly improved.

WESTERN EUROPEAN REACTION TO CHURCHILL'S VICTORY 
The Conservative victory in the United Kingdom is generally accepted 
on the Continent as another step in the general Western European trend to 
the right. Most non-Communists, with the exception of the Socialists, 
hailed Churchill's return. Although no great change in British policy is 
envisaged, the general expectation is that closer ties with the other 
Western European countries and a firmer stand on foreign policy matters 
will result. 
While most Continental commentators agree that Churchill's domestic 
policy will follow that of the Atlee Government fairly closely, Socialist 
spokesmen have expressed considerable dismay over the effects of the 
Labor Party's defeat on the international Socialist movement. Even if 
the Labor program is not radically altered, Socialism's prestige is 
considered to be endangered by this setback to its outstanding experiment. 
The relatively close vote has led some commentators to question 
the real force of the Conservative victory, and 3ocialist regret has 
been somewhat tempered by the thought that BritiSh Labor's policy has 
not been defeated. This attitude may help to prevent the adoption by 
the Socialists of more extreme measures which might widen the breach 
between them and their more moderate partners in the Continental govern-
ments. There is no immediate prospect of an increased strain on 
governmental stability in any Western European country because of this 
factor. 
Continental observers are again enthusiastic over the possibility 
of British support of, or even participation in, such plans as the 
coal-steel pool and the European Defense Forces. Nevertheless, despite 
Churchill's record in favor of closer European cooperation, there is 
scepticism over the extent to which the Prime Minister will attempt to 
follow the views he expressed as leader of the opposition. 
Most Europeans will be satisfied to see Great Britain more closely 
aligned with the Continent, even if political and economic ties are not 
formalieedin a more rigid framework. On the other hand, the most 
commonly expressed fear in regard to British foreign policy is that 
closer Anglo-American solidarity will develop. Such a trend is viewed 
as a danger to British ties with the Continent and hence to the 
European unity goal. 
The most optimistic European supporters of Churchill look to him 
for immediate efforts to ease East-West tension. Some expect feurpower 
talks, or even an American-British,Soviet conference, although it has 
also been pointed out that past meetings involving Churchill and Stalin 
gained little for the West in comparison with what was given..

Nevertheless, any British attempt which might lessen the defense burden 
will be regarded hopefully on the Continent. 
Particular national problems are reflected in the varying facets 
of European opinion on Churchill's return to power. The probability 
that the Conservatives will follow a stiffer policy toward the Moslem 
states appeals to the French, who have recently sought closer 
collaboration with Great Britain on Near East and African matters. 
Churchill's pro-French sympathies have also colored French estimates of 
his potentialities for advancing their Coreign policy objectives. 
Much speculation in West Germany revolves around the possibility of 
a change in British policy, particularly towards Germany. Underlying 
this speculation is the old German fear that an East-West rapprochement 
might be accomplished at the expense of German unity and independence. 
The Austrian Foreign Office is optimistic over the possibility of 
renewed four-power negotiations which it associates with Churchill's 
policies. The Austrian Foreign Minister believes that the Austrian 
question can be resolved only through such a meeting. 
Portugal finds specific grounds for welcoming a Conservative victory 
in the expectation that a stiffer British colonial policy will weaken 
the rising tide of nationalism in Africa. The Portuguese also look to 
a softer British attitude toward Spain. This hope is also found in the 
controlled Spanish press. The Spanish Government presumably looks for 
a less hostile attitude among its European neighbors if Great Britain 
develops a policy favorable to Spain. 
Only in Scandinavia has non-Communist comment been apprehensive of 
the international effects of Churchill's return. Both Sweden and 
Norway foresee a possible loosening of the close relations they had 
maintained with the British Labor Government, The Norwegians particularly 
fear increased British activity in Asia and the Near East. In Denmark, 
on the other hand, greater governmental stability can be expected since 
the Social Democrats will now be disinclined to challenge the ineumbent 
conservative Moderate-Liberal government. 
On balance, the effects of Churchill's victory will probably be 
more psychological than tangible. The initial enthusiastic reaction in 
Western Europe will undoubtedly be dulled as the Conservatives' policies 
are handicapped by their narrow majority and tempered by their growing 
economic and financial problems.

SPECIAL ARTICLE 
WORLD C0MMUNISM2 THE SOVIET HOLD ON COMMUNIST CHINA 
The Soviet hold on Communist China may already be, or may soon become, 
so strong as to preclude a successful assertion of independence by the 
Peiping regime if the desire to do so should ever arise? The Chinese Com-
munist leadership may eventually reject, as did the Yugoslav, the Soviet 
demand for subordination of national interests to the objective of world 
domination by Moscow? If current trends continue, however, it is doubtful 
that the Chinese could ever, like the Yugoslave, retain control of their 
entire territory, expel Soviet personnel, and eradicate Soviet influence? 
To date, far from showing any inclination to break or even to loosen 
its ties with the USSR, the Peiping regime has consistently followed poli-
cies which have the effect of binding China ever more tightly to the Soviet 
bloc? Even before the regime's founding in October 1949, the Chinese Com-
munist movement was deeply penetrated by the USSR, and in the past two 
years Peiping has sought and obtained extensive Soviet assistance?political, 
economic and military?in consolidating its position and developing its capa-
bilities? The USSR has thus been able to develop a system of controls in 
Cbmmunist China which steadily reduces Peiping's capabilities for independent 
action? 25X1

Although the CCP owes its attainment of national power primarily to its 
own efforts and is bound by a strong sense of nationalism, it has been aggres-
sively pro-Soviet and consistently Stalinist in behavior. Because the die-

tinction between a Soviet order and an adopted Soviet suggestion is not 
readily apparent to the outer world, it is not known to what degree the USSR 
may compel Peiping to adopt policies which the Party regards as disadvanta-
geous to its national interests. Thus it is not known whether Mao Tse-tung 
and his lieutenants, like Tito and his, envisage or will discover a point 
beyond which they cannot or will not go in sacrificing national interests to 
the cause of "proletarian internationa1ism0" 
Even if the CCP Politburo were to split en bloc from that of the USSR, 
it is questionable whether the entire party would follow? The USSR may al-
ready have a sufficiently strong hold over the political, economic and 
military apparatus of the border regions?Manchuria, Inner Mongolia and 
Sinkiang--to secure control of those areas in the event of a Sino-Soviet 
split without having to take direct military action? 
Soviet economic interests are particularly strong in the border regions? 
Manchuria and Sinkiang are traditional spheres of Russian influence, and the 
,USSR on several occasions, as when it invaded Manchuria in 1929 to protect 
Soviet interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway, has asserted its position 
in these regions by force? The USSR dominstes civil air and land transport 
in these areas, has a controlling position in the exploitation of oil and 
certain mineral resources, and commands physical access to the border re-
gions equal or superior to that from China proper? This dominance continues 
dsspite signs of a strengthened Chinese administrative position in these 
arease 
In China proper, Soviet economic penetration does not generally extend 
to the point of controls The railroads, the important textile industry, 
and other segments of the economy are typically Chinese-operated and Chinese-
owned? Nevertheless, Sino-Soviet agreements concluded sincs 1950 in the 
field of communications, transportation and trade reflect considerable 
progress in aligning China with the Soviet economy? Traditionally unimport-
ant in China's foreign commerce, the Soviet bloc accounted for one fourth 
of China's trade in 71950, and, according to Peiping, fully three fourth's in 
1951? Peiping's frequent commentaries on the activities of Soviet advisers 
also reveal the influence they have on many sectors of the Chinese economy? 
The structure of Russian economic interests in China indicates that 
China could not be withdrawn intact--that is, China proper plus the bor-
der areas-from the Soviet bloc. China proper might be withdrawn without 
critical economic dislocations the principal disruption would be caused by 
the necessity of once again reorienting China's foreign commerce, but the 
experience of the past two years shows that the redirection of China's trade= 
flow could be effected in short order if Peiping and the West were willing? 
A Sino-Soviet split would threaten Peiping with loss of all effective 
authority in the border regions? The loss of Manchuria's industries and

resources in particular would be a crippling blow to Peiping's industrializa-
tion plans. This consideration alone would strongly discourage possible 
Chinese separatist tendencies* 
On the military side, the Sino-Soviet treaty of February 1950 formally 
commits the Peiping regime to the Soviet bloc in the event of war, and per-
mits the USSR to retain control of the Port Arthur naval base area until the 
end of 1952* Unpublished agreements are believed to provide for the assign-
ment of Soviet advisory-technical personnel to every part of the Chinese 
military organization, for the supply of Soviet materiel, and possibly for 
the joint development and operation of Chinese naval and air bases. 
An estimated 10,000 Soviet military advisers, instructors and technicians 
are attached to the Chinese Communist ground forces at every level from the 
Revolutionary Military Council in Peiping to the regiment in the field. While 
these Soviet officers do not have command of Chinese foroes, their power is. 
reported to be as great as that of the Chinese commanders. The USSR is re-
ported to be training and equipping elite formations of the CCF in Manchuria 
and to be operating specialist schools of various types. The supply of Soviet 
materiel to Chinese armored and artillery forces, and possibly to the infantry 
as well, has been substantial. Although the CCP could dispense with Soviet 
aid without jeopardizing Peiping's control of China, the regime's capabilities 
for either offensive or defensive operations, and for achieving_status as a 
world powers, would be greatly reduced, r 
The Soviet position is especially strong in the Chinese Communist Air 
Force?with an available strength of 1220 combat planes--which is almost en-
tirely a Soviet creation g the USSR has provided planes, equipment, training 
and combat pilots. Since maintenance and supply of the air force will con-
tinue to depend on the Soviet Union, a Sino-Soviet split would probably mean 
deterioration, or possibly even defection of the air force to the USSR. 
The Soviet Union is undertaking development of the small--I29000 men 
ChineseCommunist Navy, and Soviet penetration, particularly in the more 
technical fields, extends to the lowest levels of the Chinese naval training 
organization. Realization of the Navy's missions of invading Formosa and 
defending the coast clearly depends upon continued Soviet assistance. 
Many of the Peiping regime2s military leaders have studied in the USSR, 
thousands Of Chinese officers have been Soviet trained, all of the top com-
manders have indicated a Stalinist orientation, and indoctrination on Stalin-
ist lines is pervasive throughout the armed forces. Moreover, the political 
apparatus in the military establishment is Stalinist in character and has pre-
sumably been penetrated by Soviet agents. In the event of a Sino-Soviet split 
at the Politburo level, it is likely that the Chinese Communist armed forces 
would also be split seriously enough to prevent the anti-Stalinist forces from 
achieving control over all of China.
