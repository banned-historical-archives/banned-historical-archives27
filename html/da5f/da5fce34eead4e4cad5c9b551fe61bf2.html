 COMMUNIST CHINA TAKES CAUTIOUS LINE ON LAOS
 Peiping's fundamentally
 cautious policy in Southeast
 Asia is reflected in its response
 to current developments in Laos.
 About ten days ago the Chinese
 launched a major propaganda cam-
 paign centered on charges of US
 intervention, but all their offi-
 cial statements have carefully
 avoided any commitment to mili-
 tary countermoves in Laos.   Even
 Foreign Minister Chen Yi's omi-
 nous remarks concerning Laos on
 24 June, the toughest statement
 to date by a Chinese Communist
 leader, are deliberately vague
 concerning specific Chinese ac-
 tions, although they hint at the
 possibility of escalation.
 On 13 June, two days after
 the first air attack on Khang
 Khay, propaganda broadcasts con-
 cerning Laos jumped to 25 per-
 cent of Peiping's total radio
 output and remained at about
 this level for eight days.   As
 the volume of the outcry in-
 creased, it took on a harsher
 tone, and the language seemed
 calculated to convey an impres-
 sion of mounting wrath.
 There was angry talk about
 a new US "blood debt" and vague
 warnings that continued inter-
 vention in Laos could set off a
 "new civil war" which might
 spread further.   Such statements
 appeared designed to project a
 threatening image which would
 generate political pressure in
 the free world for negotiations
 on Chinese terms--the full Geneva-
 type conference with an expand-
 able agenda for which Peiping has
 The Communist World
 repeatedly called.   These blasts
 produced little reaction any-
 where, however, and on 20 June
 the Chinese sharply reduced the
 volume of their propaganda--
 probably to permit a reassess-
 ment and possible shift of line.
 This blend of militancy and
 caution was demonstrated by the
 Chinese announcement on 18 June
 of a major military review in
 Peiping attended by Mao Tse-tung
 and other top leaders.   Such
 demonstrations of military
 strength have been rare in re-
 cent years, and the timing of
 this one suggests it was designed
 to remind neighbors in Southeast
 Asia--and potential enemies--of
 Peiping's military strength.
 However, the New China News
 Agency commentary, which claimed
 that the review "fully demon-
 strated" Chinese military pre-
 paredness, carefully avoided
 any suggestion that this strength
 might be used outside China's
 borders.
 Peiping's reluctance to
 stiffen its propaganda line with
 anything approaching a firm pub-
 lic commitment has been matched
 by its failure to use its formid-
 able military striking force in
 South China to support its prop-
 aganda.   If the Chinese wished
 to raise tension in the area they
 could do so easily by making ob-
 vious changes in deployment or
 initiating new activities, since
 units now in place near the bor-
 der could launch a devastating
 round attack into Laos.            ~

 MOSCOW MODIFIES TACTICS IN DRIVE FOR COMMUNIST CONFERENCE
 Although the Soviet leaders
 continue to insist that a world con-
 ference is imperative, they appear
 to have modified their tactics in
 an effort to break the impasse on
 this issue within the Communist
 movement.   There are indications
 that extensive consultations with
 foreign Communist leaders in the
 first part of June resulted in a
 compromise formula which stresses
 Moscow's earlier proposal for a
 preparatory commission rather than
 a. full-fledged conference of all
 parties.
 This formula was advanced pub-
 licly in Gomulka's report on 15 June
 to the Polish Party Congress in
 which he vigorously denounced
 Chinese "delaying tactics."  He
 cautioned that a world conference
 "requires patient and good prepa-
 rations" and rejected Peiping's
 right to veto such preparations.
 Gomulka. urged that a, committee com-
 posed of parties representing the
 "most important areas of the world"
 begin preparations in the'Very near
 future."  This committee would con-
 duct preliminary discussions on a
 conference agenda., prepare draft
 documents, and fix the date for the
 international conference.   Gomulka
 declared that the opposition of
 "one party or a. few parties" should
 not be an "impassable barrier" to
 a. conference, but he deleted a,
 highly charged sentence from his
 advance text which asserted that
 parties refusing to participate in
 such a meeting "will prove that
 they have placed themselves outside
 the international movement."
 Soviet party secretary Podgorny,
 who headed the Soviet delegation,
 welcomed Gomulka's speech, which
 was more forthright than Poland's
 earlier equivocal statements sup-
 porting the USSR's position.
 Podgorny underlined the "identity"
 of the Soviet and Polish parties on
 the question of Chinese "splitting
 activities" and agreed that confer-
 ence preparations should begin "as
 soon as possible."
 The Soviet leaders clearly be-
 lieve it will be easier to rally an
 impressive majority in favor of
 preparatory talks than to get sup-
 port for a, formal conference.   This
 tactic would place the Chinese, who
 want to postpone such talks until
 next year, in a vulnerable position.
 Several key foreign parties, which
 have been unwilling to endorse an
 early conference, have indicated
 approval of preparatory discussion.
 resolve itself."
 Although the Soviet leaders
 are determined to maintain pressure
 for a, conference as a. means of
 checking the disarray in the
 Communist world, they are trying
 to overcome foreign reluctance by
 constant assurances that the pur-
 pose of such a meeting will be to
 "strengthen the unity and cohesion"
 of the movement, not to excommuni-
 cate the Chinese and their allies.
 Khrushchev, however, could not
 conceal his impatience with for-
 eign Communist "neutralists" in
 his 12 June speech when he declared
 "it would be unpardonable for Com-
 munists to sit with folded arms
 and wait for the disagreement to

 RECENT TRENDS IN SOVIET AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION
 The number of aircraft pro-
 duced in the USSR has declined
 steadily since 1955.   Expendi-
 tures decreased from 1955 to 1960
 but have since remained rela
 tively stable. Current trends are
 expected to continue through
 1964.
 The percentage of combat
 aircraft dropped from 70 percent
 of the total production in 1955
 to 15 percent in 1959, then be-
 gan to rise, and will probably
 level off by the end of this year
 at 55 percent.   This increase is
 occurring as supersonic aircraft,
 primarily fighters, are built to
 replace subsonic aircraft pro-
 duced in the early and mid-1950s
 when Soviet production of mili-
 tary planes was at its height.
 Combat types, which accounted
 for nearly 90 percent of all ex-
 penditures for aircraft in 1955,
 have accounted for a stable 30-
 45 percent since 1959 and are
 expected to absorb 45 percent of
 the total in 1964.
 The disparity between this
 relatively steady rate of expendi-
 The Communist World
 tures for military aircraft and
 the rising portion of total num-
 bers of aircraft that are combat
 models can be attributed to two
 principal factors:   more money
 for combat aircraft is being di-
 rected to fighters and less to
 bombers; spending for noncombat
 aircraft is shifting to more
 costly, higher performance models.
 In 1964, up to four new
 models of transport aircraft will
 be introduced, while production
 of the current four turboprop
 models will be continued at a
 reduced level.
 The number of fighters and
 bombers to be produced this year
 will not differ enough from 1963
 to cause major changes in costs
 or resources used.   No heavy bomb-
 ors                                                                      are either in production or
 anticipated.   No major changes
 are anticipated for medium or
 light bombers; the single model
 of each now in production will
 be continued.   There may be a      25X1
 slight increase in the continued
 output of four models of fighters. 25X1

 Chinese Communist Trade:
 Peiping 's trade with the non-
 Communist world continues at a
 record pace, with China buying
 large amounts of agricultural
 goods  as well as increased
 quantities of industrial prod-
 ucts that it formerly bought in
 large part from the Soviet bloc.
 This trade last year rose about
 20 percent to an estimated $1.5
 billion--accounting for nearly
 55 percent of China's foreign
 commerce.   Trade in 1964 may be
 even larger.
 Trade with the Far East ac-
 counts for the largest part of
 this
 upsurge.   Sino-Japanese
 trade
 is
 expected to
 increase
 over
 40
 percent this
 year to
 about
 $200 million.
 Peiping's
 exports to Hong Kong, its main
 source of foreign exchange, are
 running well above last year
 when they earned China a record
 $250-million trade surplus.
 In Western Europe, the
 Chinese have purchased at
 least $50 million worth of com-
 plete plants since mid-1963.
 A spokesman for a Dutch trade

 PEIPING STEPS UP ACTIVITIES IN MIDDLE
 Peiping's $28-million long-
 term credit to Yemen is the lat-
 est Chinese move to compete with
 the Soviet Union for influence in
 the Middle East.   Peiping has never
 had any significant influence with
 the Communist parties in this area
 and is therefore concentrating
 its main effort on fostering con-
 tacts with nationalist government
 leaders.
 Under the terms of the 20-
 year, interest-free arrangement
 concluded during President Sallal's
 visit to Peiping early this month,
 the Chinese will build a new road
 through rebel-held territory from
 Sana to Sada, repair the Sana-
 Hudaydah road, and construct a
 hospital and textile factory.
 Original construction of the Sana-
 Hudaydah road, completed in 1961,
 was financed by a Chinese credit
 of $16 million extended six years
 ago.   About 1,000 Chinese came to
 Yemen to build that road, and the
 latest agreement will probably
 bring a new wave of Chinese tech-
 nicians and laborers.
 After announcing the assist-
 ance to Yemen, Peiping opened a
 bitter attack on Soviet aid to
 underdeveloped areas.   At the
 Second Afro-Asian Economic Seminar
 in Pyongyang on 20 June, the chief
 Chinese delegate warned that ac-
 ceptance of Soviet aid will wreck
 a country's economy and make it
 dependent on Moscow.   Citing Pei-
 ping's own experience, he charged
 that Soviet foreign aid serves
 only Moscow's "great-power chauvin-
 ism and national egotism."
 In its competition with the
 Soviet Union, Peiping is forced to
 rely on polemical attacks to make
 up for the modest quantity and
 relatively primitive character of
 its own aid programs, which achieve
 greatest success in backward areas
 like Yemen.
 Syria has recently become a
 center for China's stepped-up prop-
 aganda efforts.   Baath Party sec-
 retary general Aflaq has termed the
 Chinese Communist envoy the most
 active in Damascus.   New China
 News Agency publishes a daily bul- 25X1
 letin which is distributed to vari-
 ous political and commercial groups.
 Central to Peiping's propaganda
 campaign has been renewed emphasis on
 the emotion-charged Palestinian prob-
 lem.   The Chinese hope to curry Arab
 favor by contrasting Peiping's whole-
 hearted support for militancy against
 Israel to Soviet endorsements of a
 peaceful settlement.   Liu Shao-chi
 at a mid-June banquet for visiting
 Sudanese President Abboud, for ex-
 ample, pledged Chinese support for
 the Arabs' efforts to regain their
 "proper rights" in Palestine.   Polit-
 buro member Peng Chen at a rally for
 Yemeni President Sallal, pointedly
 hailed the Arabs' efforts to achieve
 unity "in their own methods"--in an
 obvious effort to capitalize on
 Khrushchev's gratuitous advice to
 the Egyptians during his recent       25X1
 Cairo visit that Arab unity should
 be based on proletarian solidarity,
 transcending ethnic boundaries.

 The Communist World
 The Polish party congress
 from 15 to 20 June demonstrated
 that Gomulka. has reasserted his
 dominance over dissident party
 factions.  His keynote address
 suggested that his present con-
 servative policies will continue
 essentially unchanged, although
 he moved slightly closer to Mos-
 cow's side in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute.
 While the personnel changes
 made at the conclave do not af-
 fect the continuity of top party
 leadership, Gomulka, neverthe-
 less did allow several appoint-
 ments which give the hard-liners
 an increased role in party af-
 fairs.   He apparently was trying
 to focus the party's attention
 on certain of the country's basic
 problems:   agriculture, trade,
 and security.
 Those elevated to more
 responsible party positions are
 men experienced in the economic-
 administrative apparatus.   The
 politburo was increased from
 10 to 12 by the addition of
 deputy premiers responsible for
 investment planning and indus-
 trial technology.   Two of the
 three candidate members of the
 politburo--a. new organizational
 category--hold high government
 economic posts.  The third is
 hard-line security boss Ryszard
 Strzelecki.
 Gomulka.'s purge from the
 central committee of "ideologi-
 cally alien" elements of both
 right and left indicates a.
 strengthening of the party's
 center group, but at the cost
 of flexibility and imagination
 in party policies.   Men who have
 opposed Gomulka's rigidity in
 the past were dropped from the
 new 85-member central committee,
 while its 27 new members are
 predominantly colorless but
 competent functionaries.
 The renewed emphasis on
 ideological commitment and
 vigilance against "alien ideo-
 logical influences" suggests
 that there will be little lib-
 eralizing of domestic policies
 in the immediate future

 RUMANIAN - YUGOSLAV - SOVIET RELATIONS
 Rumania's increasingly out-
 spoken defense of its independ-
 ent position in the Soviet bloc
 appears to have given rise to
 the hastily arranged border
 meeting between the Rumanian
 and Yugoslav leaders on 22 June.
 The Yugoslavs probably urged
 Rumanian Party first secretary
 Dej to proceed with caution in
 his campaign for independence,
 and Dej, for his part, probably
 tried to capture Tito's support.
 After his meeting with Khru-
 shchev in Leningrad on 8 June,
 Tito told the US ambassador to
 Belgrade he thought Dej was mov-
 ing too far in criticizing and
 attacking the USSR
 The Yugoslavs favor Ruma-
 nia's drive for independence,
 and do not appear worried about
 its economic contacts with the
 West.  They seem, however, to
 be concerned that Rumanian be-
 havior may have repercussions
 which would endanger European
 stability and the trend toward
 improved East-West relations.
 They also fear that Bucharest's
 continued open attacks on the
 Soviet Union will undermine Khru-
 shchev in his dispute with the
 Chinese Communists.
 Rumania's long-standing,
 uncommitted position in the
 Sino-Soviet dispute--at odds
 with that of other countries
 in Eastern Europe--emerged again
 during the recent Polish party
 congress.  The Rumanian dele-
 gate, politburo member Emil
 Bodnaras, did not even mention
 the Chinese in his speech and
 did not back the Polish pro-
 posal for a Communist prepara-

 YUGOSLAV - WEST GERMAN RELATIONS
 The prospects for improved
 Yugoslav-West German relations
 seem considerably brighter than
 at any time in the past year.
 In "friendly" talks on 12
 June, contrasting sharply with
 the coolness of previous infor-
 ma.l meetings, Bonn proposed
 renewing formal negotiations on
 economic issues and offered to
 grant some of the economic con-
 cessions Yugoslavia had earlier
 demanded.   On 26 June the two
 countries will begin negotia.-
 tions on this offer and on a
 new trade protocol to replace
 the one expiring at the end of
 this month.
 Yugoslavia, has considerably
 toned down its criticism of the
 Bonn government, which in turn
 quashed charges that ha.d been
 brought in West Germany against
 Yugoslav Vice President Rankovic
 for alleged war crimes.
 Yugoslavia also appears
 to be adopting a conciliatory
 attitude on some of the politi-
 cal issues which divide the two
 countries, such as West German
 indemnification for Yugoslav
 World War II losses.   At the
 12 June meeting, Yugoslav nego-
 tiator Drndic indicated that
 his government might settle
 temporarily for a Bonn state-
 ment recognizing a, moral obli-
 gation to take up the indemnifi-
 cation question when circum-
 stances permit.
 If the economic talks are
 successful, Drndic hopes for
 political discussions which might
 lead to restoring the "missions"
 withdrawn in 1957 when West Ger-
 many broke relations because
 Yugoslavia. recognized East Ger-
 many.
 Drndic further stated that
 even if high-level talks stale-
 mated, Yugoslavia would welcome
 discussions along the lines of
 a. "Trieste-type solution"--an
 idea. which has appeared frequently
 in Belgrade commentaries in re-
 cent weeks but has not been
 spelled out.   Presumably, this
 would involve some form of third-
 party mediation.
 In spite of these concilia.-
 tory gestures, however, the divi-
 sive issues which remain could
 disrupt the coming talks.   Yugo-
 slavia still is sensitive about
 Bonn's failure to control the
 activities of the Ustashi ter-
 rorist elements in West Germany.
 Bonn suspects that Yugoslavia
 might be campaigning for recogni-
 tion of East Germany among the
 unaligned nations,a.nd on 8 June
 officially accused the Yugoslav
 Government of preparing such a
 campaign for the coming unaligned
 conference.   Yugoslavia continues
 to deny these accusations but
 has not yet responded to the
 protest.

 Laotian Premier Souvanna
 has called for a sharp step-up
 in military action against the
 Pathet Lao.   In a meeting with
 US officials on 23 June, he out-
 lined plans for an attack against
 Pathet Lao positions in the
 Phou Khoun area.   The plans
 call for about ten battalions
 of rightist.and neutralist
 troops-supported by Laotian
 Air Force T-28s--to move against
 an estimated three Pathet Lao
 battalions.   Souvanna emphasized
 that the success of the attack
 would depend heavily on large-
 scale US logistical support.
 The proposed attack is
 designed to forestall an ex-
 pected enemy move against the
 neutralist stronghold at Muong
 Soui.
 Souvanna also pressed for
 increased interdiction operations
 against Route 7 east of the
 Plaine des Jarres as well as
 for continued strikes against
 Pathet Lao depots on the Plaine.
 He urged maximum US support of
 these operations.
 On 20 June, a spokesman
 for the pro - Pathet Lao dis-
 sident neutralists under Col.
 Deuane issued a statement strongly
 condemning Souvanna as respon-
 sible for the continuing Lao-
 tian Air Force attacks against
 Communist positions.   Branding
 him "the new lackey of US im-
 perialism" the statement warned
 that if Souvanna continues his
 present course the "Laotian
 population will surely over-
 throw him."
 On the diplomatic front,
 Souvanna and Pathet Lao chief
 Souphannouvong have remained
 at odds over arrangements for
 renewed tripartite talks.   Sou-
 vanna, although agreeable to a
 meeting at Luang Prabang, has
 refused to yield to the Pathet
 Lao demand that the town be de-
 militarized.   Souphannouvong
 has not responded to Souvanna's
 suggestion that talks be held
 in a neutral city outside Laos.
 Probably anticipating an
 eventual acceptance, the Polish
 Foreign Ministry, working with
 the British ambassador in War-
 saw, now has proposed tripar-
 tite talks outside Laos to de-
 termine whether conditions ex-
 ist for reconvening the Geneva
 conference.   Representatives
 of both the Geneva co-chairmen
 and the governments participat-
 ing in the International Con-
 trol Commission would attend.
 The co-chairmen would then re-
 port to ICC members with a rec-
 ommendation to reconvene the
 Geneva conference "should the
 results so warrant."  Communist
 China has also called for tri-
 partite meetings.

 The new Indian Government
 is considering tighter controls
 on food distribution as part of
 its effort to solve what Prime
 Minister Shastri has termed In-
 dia's "most formidable" problem
 --rising prices.
 Food prices have been the
 main factor in a 7-percent in-
 crease in over-all living costs
 for the working-class consumer
 during the past year.   The In-
 dian Government estimates that
 prices of principal food grains
 have risen 17 percent since June
 1963--as high as 100 percent in
 some localities.   Comparable in-
 creases have occurred in other
 food prices.   Although the pinch
 felt by the already undernour-
 ished consumer has not yet led
 to major unrest, tension is
 mounting, and labor union pro-
 tests may soon shatter the new
 Shastri government's "honeymoon."
 Wheat prices reached un-
 seasonably high levels late
 last year as a result of the
 decline in wheat production dur-
 ing 1962-63--a shortfall typical
 of India's general lag behind
 planned agricultural output.
 The problem was compounded in
 January, when unusually cold
 and dry weather in the north
 presaged a poor spring wheat har-
 vest this year. Hoarding and grain
 speculation added to the normal
 upward pressure on prices caused
 by local shortages.   Hoarding
 has also recently pushed up the
 price of rice, India's major
 food crop.   Despite a record
 high in rice production last year,
 deliveries to the market are more
 than 15 percent below normal.
 Having staked much of its
 prestige on. curbing inflation,
 the Shastri government has de-
 voted a major portion of its
 early policy deliberations to
 the food price problem.   An ur-
 gent three-day conference between
 the central government ministers
 involved and the chief ministers
 of the states--begun on 24 June--
 may lead to additional state trad-
 ing and control over retail dis-
 tribution.   Such a program would
 be costly to administer, however,
 and could aggravate the malady
 by causing an inflationary in-
 crease in government deficits.
 A political obstacle to
 any solution is likely to
 arise from local Congress
 Party leaders in many of the
 afflicted areas.   Grain mid-
 dlemen are often allowed to
 reap windfall profits from
 price imbalances in nonelec-
 tion years while the political
 bosses look the other way.  In
 return for this the middlemen
 are tapped, in election  years,
 to contribute heavily to party
 coffers.

 MOROCCAN-ALGERIAN BORDER INFILTRATIONS
 Although Morocco's King
 Hassan is taking positive steps
 to avoid open conflict with Al-
 geria, recent events have
 strengthened his conviction that
 President Ben Bella seeks even-
 tually to unseat him.
 On 9 June, Moroccan secu-
 rity forces "eliminated" a band
 of Moroccan dissidents attempt-
 ing to infiltrate from Algeria.
 Hassan sent emissaries to talk
 with Ben Bella on 13 June, but
 was careful not to imply that
 the Algerian President was per-
 sonally responsible for the dis-
 sidents' activity.
 Ben Bella in turn has de-
 nied flatly that Algiers knew
 about or was in any way involved
 in the incident, or that it sup-
 plied Moroccan dissidents with
 arms, money, or training.   Ben
 Bella promised to investigate.
 King Hassan has also or-
 dered his army command to clean
 up the Moroccan frontier area
 with a minimum of fanfare and
 bloodshed.
 A Moroccan Foreign Ministry
 official speculated to the Ameri-
 can Embassy last week that Ben
 Bella, if given enough Soviet
 materiel and despite his denials,
 might create an anti-Moroccan
 diversion to distract attention
 from his internal security prob-
 lems.   Algiers itself seems to
 be taking a serious view of these
 problems; it has "suggested"
 that several foreign dignitaries
 cancel visits they were scheduled
 to make in the next few weeks.
 The Moroccans draw the conclu-
 sion that the West should sup-
 port them "as the remaining
 stable element in northwest Af-
 rica."  They imply that this sup-
 port should include the arms
 that Morocco has been trying to
 get from Western sources.
 Nonetheless, a facade of
 improving relations between Al-
 geria and Morocco is being
 erected.   By mid-May, Rabat and
 Algiers apparently decided to
 resume full diplomatic relations
 and to seize the initiative from
 the arbitration commission which
 the Organization of African Unity
 had appointed last November to
 recommend means of settling their
 border dispute.
 On 25 May, they revived
 the mixed Moroccan-Algerian com-
 mission set up just prior to the
 clashes last October.   Although
 the two negotiating sessions held
 have been described as a "dialogue
 of the deaf," the commission will 25X1
 meet again in Algiers on 8 July
 to maintain appearances of amity.

 The Congo National Army
 (ANC), unable to cope with new
 outbreaks of dissidence, appears
 to be near collapse in several
 areas, and Leopoldville seems
 unsure what to do.
 In Stanleyville, once the
 seat of Antoine Gizenga's left-
 wing regime, the ANC detachment
 still controls the city even
 though there was an arms-gather-
 ing raid on 20 June by dissidents
 --possibly from the newly formed
 antigovernment "Popular Libera-
 tion Army "
 In Kivu Central Province,
 the ANC appears to be making lit-25X1
 tle new progress against the in-
 surgents.
 Political maneuvering in Leo-
 poldville continues  and the com-
 position of the new government
 which President Kasavubu must ap-
 point by 30 June, when the mandate
 for the present government runs  25X1
 out, has not been determined.
 Tshomb6
 announced on 24 June he wou d re-
 turn at once "at the invitation"
 of the Leopoldville government.
 If the former Katangan presi-
 dent is unable to gain a dominant
 position in Leopoldville or one
 which would facilitate his ultimate
 ascendancy, he may well use his
 force of 3,,000 gendarmes in Angola.
 to re-establish himself in Katanga.

 TANGANYIKA MOVES SLOWLY TO CURB ZANZIBAR PRO-COMMUNISTS
 Tanganyikans and pro-
 Communist Zanzibaris continue
 to maneuver in what promises
 to be a long struggle for con-
 trol of Zanzibar.   President
 Nyerere is confident that the
 situation is improving but be-
 lieves that establishing full
 control may take up to six
 months.   He is determined to
 avoid force until all political
 means have been exhausted.
 Nyerere's most significant
 move was the removal two weeks
 ago of Salim Rashid from Zanzi-
 bar to Dar es Salaam, where he
 will be junior minister of
 finance.   Rashid, a Communist
 who was secretary of Zanzibar's
 Revolutionary Council, wielded
 considerable power through his
 influence on Vice President
 Karume.   His successor as council
 secretary is a mild-mannered
 admirer of the Soviets who spent
 six years studying in Moscow.
 The unpredictable Karume
 remains the key to Zanzibar P
 e seems a-
 trac e    o   e ideal of African
 unity but is unwilling to give
 up the assistance that the Com-
 munists have promised him.
 Last week, while four of
 the island's most ardent pro-
 Communists were absent, a team
 of Tanganyikan civil servants
 started work in Zanzibar and
 two tough, able Tanganyikans
 took up ministerial posts chosen
 to keep them close to Karume.
 Karume has removed two of the
 three pro-Communist commissioners
 on Pemba Island following com-  25X1
 plaints about their brutal tac-
 tics.
 The Communist aid program
 on Zanzibar continues to expand.
 Equipment for an East German
 medical clinic has arrived. The
 latest count of advisers and
 technicians lists some 37 Soviets,
 29 East Germans,and 67 Chinese
 plus an East German trade mis-
 sion which arrived last week.
 Eight Zanzibari civil servants
 are due to go to East Germany
 next week for training in finance.
 A new $14-million Chinese devel-
 opment loan,which Karume and the
 Chinese ambassador signed on 16
 June, is in addition to the $28-
 million interest-free credit
 and $3-million grant for the      25X1
 United Republic signed in Peiping
 the same day by Vice President
 Kawawa.

 It has always been a tenet
 of French President de Gaulle
 that Communist bloc unity even-
 tually would suffer from resur-
 gent nationalism and that West-
 ern initiatives should promote
 this as it developed.   The cur-
 rent Soviet-Rumanian rift has
 probably deepened De Gaulle's
 conviction,  and he may have de-
 cided that France now should
 step up its efforts to make its
 presence felt in Eastern Europe.
 Minister of State Louis
 Joxe's visit to Yugoslavia from
 18 to 23 June,  the first by a
 high-level French official since
 World War II,  appears to be an-
 other step by Paris to develop
 its contacts in that area.   Paris'
 principal efforts in Eastern
 Europe are likely to center on
 promoting cultural exchanges com-
 parable to the agreement Joxe
 signed in Belgrade.   A notable
 feature of this agreement is a
 provision to increase the teach-
 ing of French in Yugoslav schools
 and universities.
 The French   already have
 re-established good cultural
 ties with Poland and Hungary,
 and to a lesser extent, with
 Bulgaria.   Last December Paris
 raised its diplomatic missions
 in Budapest, Sofia, and Bucharest
 to embassy rank.   The French For-
 eign Ministry has also succeeded
 in getting broader circulation
 for the French press in Eastern
 Europe
 On 1 June, France signed a
 bilateral technical agreement
 with Rumania providing for ex-
 changes of scientific documents
 and of research scientists.   Two
 similar agreements have already
 been concluded with Yugoslavia
 and the USSR.   The director of
 the French Atomic Energy Commis-
 sion has visited Bucharest and
 toured scientific installations.
 He may have tried to interest
 the Rumanians in a French nuclear
 power plant.
 Paris feels satellite ties
 with Moscow can be further weak-
 ened by easing certain trade
 credit terms to bloc countries
 demonstrating independent tenden-
 cies.   Recently, a leading Paris
 financial paper reported that
 current Franco-German talks to
 ease commercial credits to the
 satellites could be concluded
 on the occasion of De Gaulle's
 July visit to Bonn.
 De Gaulle probably would
 like also to dispel the notion
 that the US is doing more than
 other Western countries in evolv-
 ing new relations with the East-
 ern European states.   In this
 regard, Paris would particularly
 like to increase its contacts
 with Eastern bloc intellectuals
 in the hope that they could be
 converted to what the French term
 a more "European" approach.
 While De Gaulle probably
 has no blueprint for bringing
 the satellites into the confed-
 eral Europe he envisions,  he
 seems to look on the Eastern
 European nations as an added
 weight to maintain the balance
 against resurgent German power.

 THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
 Italy's current economic
 difficulties continue  to be the
 chief worry of the Moro govern-
 ment.   The anti-inflationary
 measures it has taken show signs
 of proving effective, but addi-
 tional stabilization measures
 are in prospect, partly to sat-
 isfy EEC requirements for credit
 assistance.   However, a new
 rash of strikes threatens to
 accelerate inflationary trends.
 The economy has shown a
 number of encouraging signs
 this year,   Small balance-of-
 payments surpluses appeared in
 April and May--the first in
 about a year and a half--and
 price rises have moderated some-
 what.   Unemployment, although
 still under control, could pre-
 sent the most critical problem.
 The situation in Turin Province
 --the area hardest hit by the
 stabilization measures--is po-
 tentially serious; reportedly
 there are about 150,000 em-
 ployees working reduced hours
 and layoffs are increasing.
 The Italians reportedly
 are seeking to postpone for a
 week the EEC Finance Ministers'
 planned 29-30 June meeting--to
 review the Italian program.
 They hope this added time would
 allow them to overcome differ-
 ences within the cabinet over
 the proposed new anti-infla-
 tionary measures.   These are
 expected to be mainly fiscal,
 upping some luxury taxes and
 public service rates.   A progres-
 sively increased income tax
 rate on incomes of over $20,000
 is also being considered.   Three
 additional tax measures contem-
 plated are designed to reduce
 the trade deficit and will de-
 pend on EEC approval of increas-
 ing taxes on imports while per-
 mitting larger tax rebates on
 exports.
 EEC Vice President Marjolin
 was in Rome last week to dis-
 cuss the stabilization effort
 and was said to be satisfied
 with the effectiveness of Ital-
 ian credit restrictions.   Ac-
 cording to an EEC official, the
 proposed EEC "credit package"
 may involve the equivalent of
 $1 billion in long-term credits
 --mainly from Germany--plus
 "several hundred million" for
 use by the Bank of Italy to
 counteract speculation against
 the lira.
 Labor unrest has been in-
 creasingly severe in recent
 weeks, with 24-hour walkouts
 called in several important in-
 dustries.   In the building in-
 dustry, hard hit-by the anti-
 inflation measures, unemployment
 reportedly is high and there
 is apprehension that the na-
 tionwide strike held this week,
 if repeated, might lead to a
 repetition of the violent demon-
 strations which occurred between
 construction workers and police
 last fall.

 The two major non-Communist
 trade confederations did not
 participate in the recent rail-
 road and building industry
 strikes and have often denounced
 the Communist confederations'
 strike motives as an attempt to
 embarrass the center-left gov-
 ernment.   They have, however,
 joined with the Communist con-
 Sweden:   At its quadrennial
 congress earlier this month,
 Sweden's governing Social Demo-
 cratic party deferred until 1968
 a decision on the controversial
 issue of whether to authorize
 the defense forces to acquire
 nuclear weapons.
 Defense Minister Andersson,
 in a speech urging support for
 a resolution by the party exec-
 utive postponing a decision,
 declared that Sweden "would not

 putes over contract renewals.
 Wage rates have risen about 11

 maximum increase which could
 be permitted if inflation is
 to be brought under control.
 have access to sufficent quanti-
 ties of plutonium until the late
 1960s or early 1970s."
 This decision of the con-
 gress is a victory for the mode-
 rate faction led by Prime Minis-
 ter Erlander.   He skillfully out-
 maneuvered the Social Democratic
 left wing which, ever since the
 partial test ban agreement last
 year, has urged the party form-
 ally to renounce acquisition of
 these weapons.

 A new wave of terrorist at-
 tacks in British Guiana this
 week seems to be the work of ac-

 Jagan's Progressive Youth Organ-

 In the last two days   at least
 six persons have been killed,
 mostly from ambush or by masked
 terrorists.   Almost all the vic-
 tims are Negro, and there is a
 serious possibility of large-
 scale Negro retaliation against
 East Indians, particularly in
 the capital.
 The Jagan organization is
 apparently seeking to demonstrate
 that those of its top leaders who
 were recently jailed are not re-
 sponsible for directing the grow-
 ing violence.   It may also be
 trying to show that the governor
 cannot control the colony despite
 his sweeping security powers.
 Another motive may be to promote

 tion.   The UN Decolonization
 Committee voted on 23 June to
 send a mission to British Guiana,
 despite Britain's express re-
 fusal to allow such a group to
 enter the colony.
 Meanwhile, Jagan's govern-

 spite loss of its legislative
 majority.   To a certain extent,
 the Negro attacks on East In-
 dians at Wismar at the end of
 May.reportedly have solidified
 East Indian support behind Jagan.
 Harassment by the Jaganites of
 the Guyana All-Indian League,
 a semipolitical anti-Jagan group,
 has probably reduced chances
 that this group will develop into  25X1
 an organization capable of at-
 tracting East Indian voters away
 from Jagan.

 DETERIORATING SUPPORT FOR ECUADOR'S GOVERNING JUNTA
 After nearly a year in
 power, the prestige of the rul-
 ing junta of Ecuador has de-
 clined to a new low.   This is
 due both to popular disenchant-
 ment and to military dissatis-
 faction over conditions in the
 armed forces and disillusion-
 ment with individual junta, mem-
 bers.
 The political parties now
 are openly critical of the gov-
 ernment.   However, they are
 weak and poorly organized and
 are presently incapable of pro-
 viding strong civilian leader-
 ship.   The general public re-
 mains apathetic to the politi-
 cians' attacks on the government.
 There is some indication
 that municipal elections will
 soon be announced for November.
 This could be the first tenta-
 tive step toward restoration of
 constitutional government.   A
 new election law is being de-
 layed, however, and several
 junta members have rejected the
 idea of handing power over to
 the civilians until political
 processes are reformed and the
 political parties manifest a.
 greater sense of responsibility.
 Efforts have been made to
 reactivate an antigovernment
 "popular front" called the Ecua.-
 dorea.n Democratic Alliance (ADE)
 which overthrew the Arroyo del
 Rio regime in 1944.   So far,
 however, neither ADE nor any of
 several other "movements" have
 been able to pick up much sup-
 port for antigovernment activity.
 More serious for the junta.
 in any case is its dwindling
 support within the armed forces,
 which are increasingly dissatis-
 fied with their pay and living
 conditions.   While there is no
 evidence of organized military
 opposition, a, spirit of disloy-
 alty is widespread, and many
 officers seem to think that a.
 major personnel change in the
 government is needed.   Even the
 popular air force junta. member
 Colonel Freile has lost much of
 his support, as has junta presi-
 dent Admiral Castro Jijon.
 There are rumors that De-
 fense Minister General Naranjo,
 Government Minister General Mora25X1
 Bowen, Freile, and other offi-
 cers might be included in a new
 executive.
 There also are persistent
 rumors of a cabinet shake-up,
 possibly around the anniversary
 of the junta's assumption of
 power on 11 July.   Freile has    25X1
 implied that certain inefficient
 cabinet officers will soon be
 replaced.

 ARGENTINE POLITICAL TENSION
 Argentina, is entering a
 new phase of political turmoil,
 as public patience with Presi-
 dent Illia's vacillation has
 given way to strong opposition
 to the government's economic
 policies.  Nearly all vocal
 segments of society have been
 alienated and are trying to
 bring pressure on Illia to
 change his cabinet and modify
 his policies.
 According to the American
 Embassy, most political parties
 are pessimistic regarding the
 future of the government.   They
 believe the internal difficul-
 ties of Illia's People's Radical
 Party (UCRP) severely inhibit
 his regime's capacity to deal
 with Argentina's severe economic
 problems.
 The catalyst releasing this
 antigovernment sentiment has
 been the "Battle Plan" of the
 General Confederation of Labor
 (CGT), which is designed to
 wring wide-ranging economic and
 political concessions from the
 government.
 The government's steps to
 meet labor's economic demands
 have been self-defeating.   These
 include a minimum wage tied to
 living costs, price controls
 on certain essential commodities,
 new exchange regulations, and
 Western Hemisphere
 stringent regulation of the
 beef trade.     All have failed
 to halt the rise in living costs,
 and  in the case of beef, have
 caused shortages and a black
 market. The government's actions
 also have heightened fears in
 business circles that the UCRP
 may impose further economic
 controls.
 Business interests also
 fear that extreme nationalists
 within the UCRP may undercut
 Illia's efforts to conclude
 satisfactory settlements with
 US and other foreign companies
 regarding their annulled petro-
 leum contracts.   Illia's con-
 tinuing efforts are a matter
 of great concern of the mili-
 tary  who, along with him,realize
 that the foreign companies are
 necessary to attain self-suffi-
 ciency in oil.
 The military leaders do not
 wish to become involved directly
 in matters of primary civilian
 responsibility and will inter-
 vene only if conditions should
 deteriorate to the point where
 government policies lead to
 complete discrediting of the re-
 gime and  o ular demand
 removal.
