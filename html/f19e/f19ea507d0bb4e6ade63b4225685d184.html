SUMMARY 
Chinese Communist theorists claim that Mao Tse-tung has 
contributed to the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state with 
his concept of the "people's democratic dictatorship." This 
particular claim for Mao appears to be valid. 
Whereas Marx had envisaged a dictatorship simply of the 
proletariat, Lenin had proposed adding--for a time--the peas-
ants. Mao originally accepted Lenin's view, but in the late 
1930s he began to add to the select circle another class--
the middle or "national" bourgeoisie. Mao regarded this 
class as having the essential characteristic of anti-imperial-
ism. 
Lenin had also envisaged that the peasants would eventual-
ly be discarded as partners in the dictatorship, and Stalin 
did this. Mao has not followed this precedent; he has pre-
served the "people's democratic dictatorship" of several 
classes. 
The Chinese, have sometimes shown sensitivity to Soviet 
efforts to obscure Mao's concept_ Moscow has been concerned 
with the prestige-value of the concept--which Mao has :.pre-
sent-edas an indispensable state form for underdekreloped coun-
tries--and, in consequence, with thc; possible expansion of 
Chinese influence, at Soviet expense, among the Communist par-
ties of these countries. There is evidence that at least 
three Asian Communist parties--of Indonesia, Burma, and 
Malaya--have in fact accepted Mao's concept. 
The Chinese Communists themselves have sometimes con-
-tributed to obscuring Mao's concept by agreeing with Soviet 
theorists that the "people's democratic dictatorship" is only 
a "form" of proletarian dictatorship. This formulation means 
simply that power is held as exclusively by the Chinese par-
ty as by the Soviet party. In theory, Mao is a revisionist, 
while in practice the Communist dictatorship in China is ap-
plied with such vigor as to disturb even some observers in : 
the bloc.

II. THE STATE Fonm 
("P'EOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC DICTATOMHIP") 
According to Marx, destruction of the .bourgeois state 
is not peaceful but revolutionary, and what the proletariat 
establishes is not socialism or democracy but a transition-
al state, the dictatorship of the proletariat. (1) "Be-
tween capitalist and Communist society," Marx says in his 
Critique of the Gotha Program of 1875, "lies the period of 
the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. 
There corresponds to this also a political transition peri-
od in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary  
dictatorship of the proletariat." fe7Mphasis in original/ 
772) At various points in their writings, Engels and Lein 
elaborated on the idea of the dictatorship of the proletar-
iat, as did Stalin. Since at least 1949, Chinese Communist 
theorists have claimed that Mao too has further advanced the 
theory of state, of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
In 1949, Tu Shou-su (3) and Li. Mien (4) both say that 
Mao "further developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of state" 
by advancing the concept of the "people's democratic dicta-
torship." Similarly; in 1960, Liu Ping-lin says that, "Com-
rade Mao Tse-tung has.creatively developed the Marxist-Lenin-
ist doctrine on the dictatorship of the proletariat, creat-
ing the theory of the people's democratic dictatorship." (5) 
Liu goes on to say t.haT-Tat Mao had discovered "for China" 
was "a new form of revolutionary dictatorship of the prole-
tariat." 
The Chinese claim appears to be valid. The precise na-
ture of Mao's originality--briefly, his substitution of the 
idea "people's democratic" (including national capitalists) 
for "proletariat" in describing a Communist dictatorship--
emerges only from his relatively late writings. For in at 
least two rather early works, Mao merely follows Lenin's 
and Stalin's views. 
Thus in his Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist? 
of October 1928, Mao speaks of an aFFEa "workers' and peas-
ants'" regime (6), and in A Single Spark Can Start  a Prairie 
Fire of January 1930, he speaks of 'the correctness of the 
slogan about a workers' and peasants' democratie. political 
power," (7)

It was Lenin who, in 1905, departed from Marx's idea of 
the dictatorship of the proletariat and proposed inclusion 
of the peasants in the concept. In his Two Tactics of Social  
Damocracy in the Democratic Revolution, ho says: "The task 
now is to define which casses must build the new superstruc-
ture...This definiti67 is given in the slogan: The democratic 
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. This slogan 
defines.. .the character of the new superstructure (a "demo-
cratic" as distinct from a socialist dictatorship),.." as 
bourgeois-democratic development was still the order of the 
day in Russia. (3) rjmphasis in original7 Stalin applies 
the slogan to China In 1926: 
I think that the future revolutionary government in 
China will in general resemble in character the gov-
ernment we used to talk ? about in our country in 1905, 
that is, something in the nature of a democratic dic-
tatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, with the 
difference, however, that it will be first and fore-
most an anti-imperialist government. This shall be 
an interim state power for China to attain non-cap-
italist development, (9) 
This idea of workers' and peasants' political power, 
originally Lenin's, was not-75E1y used by Mao in October 1928 
and January 1930, but also appears in the 1931 constitution 
of the Chinese Soviet Republic (Kiangsi). That constitution 
referred to the political power of "the state of the demo-
cratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants." (10) 
But in the late 1930s, Mao began to develop. his own 
idea of Communist dictatorship, carrying Lenin's innovation. 
one step further by bringing yet another class--the "middle," 
or "national," bourgeoisie--into the circle of the select. 
The "big" bourgeoisie, compradors, landlords, "bullying 
gentry," and the reactionary section of the "vagrants" 
(lumpenproletariat) were excluded. 
In Chapter 2 of The Chinese Revolution and the CCP  
(December 1939), Mao, describing what he calls a "new demo-
cracy" revolution in China, says: 
Politically, it means the joint dictatorship of several 
revolutionary classes...Economically, it means national-
ization of all big capital and big enterprises..:distki-
bution of the land of landlords among the peasants, and

at the same time the general preservation of private 
capitalist enterprises.... /emphasis supplied7 (11) 
Mao goes on to say that the "new democracy" revolution re-
sults in the "dictatorship of the united front of all rev-
olutionary classes" (12), without explicitly including the 
national bourgeoisie. But Chapter 2 carries throughout the 
implication that this class is indeed a member of the new 
"united front," or "joint," dictatorship, as "The national 
bourgeoisie...oppressed by imperialism.. .constitutes one of 
the revolutionary forces." (13) 
On New Democracy (January 1940) strongly implies that 
the national bourgeoisie would be one of the classes to par-
ticipate in the future Communist state power. Mao first 
says that the Chinese revolution aims at establishing "a new 
democracy society" and "a state unAer the joint dictatorship. 
of all revolutionary classes." (14) He then sets forth the 
prime criterion for determing the loyalty to minimum Commu-
nist policies: anti-imperialist attitude. "No matter what 
classes...join the revolution...so long as they oppose im-
perialism, their revolution becomes part of the proletarian 
socialist world revolution and they themselves become its 
allies." (15) Thus, the Chinese national bourgeoisie "...even 
in the era of imperialism" retains to a certain degrees "a 
revolutionary quality which enablesit....to ally 'with  the 
proletariat and petty bourgeoisie to opliag;TTEe'enemi-jg-It 
sets' itself against." 5mphasis supplied7 '(16) It appar- ? 
ently is,therefore,,one of the revolutionary classes destined 
to play a role in the "joint dictatorship." 
The first explicit reference in Mao's works to the na-
tional bourgeoisie as one of the classes of the new, Maoist 
dictatorship is made in On the People's Democratic Dictator-
ship (July 1949) (17). Mao says: 
Al]. the experiences of the Chinese people...tell us 
to carry out a people's democratic dictatorship.... 
Who are the "people"? At the present stage in China 
they are the working class, the peasantry, the petty 
bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. (18) 
"This clear and correct definition," says Tu Shou-su, "leaves 
no confusion." (19) It is primarily to these lines that

Chinese theorists point whop they credit Mao with having fur-
ther developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictator-
ship of the proletariat. 
According to the Chinese, at precisely what point did 
Mao develop this theory? Liu Ping-lin makes the inclusion 
of the national bourgeoisie the decisive factor. "The peo-
ple's democratic dictatorship accepted the participation of 
the national bourgeoisie; it was, therefore, different from 
the 'Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Democratic Dic-
tatoship' proposed by Lenin during the 1905 Russian revolu-
tion." (20) 
Liu's rejection of Lenin's formula, which Stalin in 1926 
had declared would be the future form of state power in China, 
is a reflection of Mao's persisting reluctance to accept the 
Russian idea. It was Mao's desire to establish a new, Chi-
nese formula to describe state power. Liu states: "Comrade 
Mao Tse-tung has created a new form of proletarian revolu-
tionary dictatorship for our country and found the most cor-
rect road, the road of the people's democratic dictatorship." 
reliphasis supplied7 (21) 
Mao's formulation is indeed a new one. For Marx, Lenin, 
and Stalin, the Communist dictatorship following the revolu-
tion was not to include the:middle, or national, bourgeoisie. 
They never saw this class as part of the "people" in a Com-
munist-controlled state. On at least two occasions, Lenin 
explains Marx's use of the term, "people," as indicating only 
the workers and peasants, the latter constituting part of 
the petty bourgeoisie. 
In 1905, Lenin says: "It now remains to define more 
precisely what Marx reall? meant by 'democratic bourgeoisie' 
(demokratische Burgerschaft), which together with the work-
ers he called the people, in contradistinction to the big 
bourgeoisie...There is no doubt that the chief components 
of the 'people,' whom Marx in 1348 contrasted with the re-
sisting reactionaries and the treacherous bburgeoisie, are 
the proletariat and peasantry." (22) 
Regarding the "liberal bourgeoisie," Lenin excludes them 
from the ranks of the "people" after the revolution, as they 
will betray the peasants by taking the side of the landlords. 
In 1917, Lenin points out that in a letter to Dr. Kugelmann

(12 April 1871), Marx spoke of a "people's revolution." (23) 
He then says that, "the idea of a 'people's' revolution seems 
r.;trange on Marx's lips, and the Russian Plekhanovites and 
Mensheviks...might possibly declare such an expression a 
'slip of the tongue'...but in the Europe of 1871, the prole-
tariat on the Continent did not constitute the majority of 
the people. A 'people's' revolution, actually sweeping the 
majority into its current, could be such only if it embraced 
both the proletariat and the peasantry. /During the revolu-
tion7 both classes then constituted the 'people."' (24) After 
the revolution, when the new, transitional state is estab-
lished, it can be, says Marx, only a dictatorship of the 
proletariat. 
Lenin's own use of the term, "people," also excludes the 
national bourgeoisie in the state form. In 1905, he defines 
the "people" as the "proletariat and peasantry, if we take 
the main, big forces and distribute the rural and urban petty  
bourgeoisie (also part of 'the people') between the two." 
/aphasis supplied/ (25) "The Jacobins of contemporary So-
Zial-Democracy--trie Bolsheviks...--want the people, i.e., 
the proletariat and the peasantry, to settle accounts with 
the monarchy and the aristocracy in the 'plebian. way....'(26) 
"There.remains the 'people,' that is, the proletariat and 
peasantry...." (27) The peasants, designated. by Lenin as 
"democratic," or "petty," bourgeoisie were to be used only 
to consummate a revolutionary seizure of power, after which 
the proletariat would mark them for discard: "In other words: 
When the democratic bourgeoisie or petty bourgeoisie ascends 
another step, when not only the revolution but the complete 
victory of the revolution becomes an accomplished fact, we 
shall 'substitute' (perhaps amid the horrified cries of new, 
future, Martynovs) for the slogan of the democratic dictator-
ship, the slogan of a socialist dictatorship of the prole-
tariat...." (28) 
That is what Lenin did after the Bolshevik takeover in 
1917; the dictatorship of tl,e' proletariat was formalized by 
in 1936. But Mao did not follow this precedent after 
the CCP takeover in China in 1949. For reasons of prestige 
and broad popular support, Mao insisted then and insists to-
day on preserving the unique ritualistic slogan of "people's 
democratic dictatorship."

Since 1949, the Chinese have shown considerable sensi-
tivity to apparent Soviet efforts to erode or conceal the 
uniqueness of Mao's slogan. In 1952, the Peking Jen-min 
Jih-pao noted with apparent delight the criticism by Soviet 
scholars of the book, Historical Materialism (Konstantinov, 
editor), which had "incorrectly" described China's state. 
_form. Jen-min Jih-pao reports the criticism: 
In the 'last paragraph ofSection 2, Chapter 9, "On 
the Soviet Socialist State," the writer states that 
the People's Republic of China has established a 
revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the prole-
tariat arid peasantry. This definition fails to in-
dicate full and correctly the characteristics and 
special features of the state power of the Peo-
ple's Ropublic of China (genuine people's and demo-
cratic state power)., 
The writer does not give, attention to the alliance 
of the working class and the national bourgeoise 
formed in New China, although this aspect should not 
be negleoted in describing the scharacteristics of 
the development of the people's republic in China. 
(29) 
In discussing China's "people's democratic dictator-
ship," other Soviet writers seem to have made it a standard 
procedure to conceal its originality by equating it with 
the Lenin-Stalin slogan. Thus V. Maslennikov, describing 
the nature of Chinese "people's democracy," credits Stalin, 
among other things, with having "predicted" that the future 
revolutionary power would be "something like" Lenin's "demo-
cratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry" which 
would be a state form in the state of transition to social-
ism. (30) 
The Chinese effort to resist Soviet imposition of the 
Lenin-Stalin slogan is manifest in the manner used by Chang 
Ju-hsin in treating this slogan in his eillogy of Stalin in 
April 1953. (Chang's essay is a tribute to Mao as well.) 
Chang's procedure is simple: he conspicuously deletes Sta-
lin's phrase, "that is, something in the nature of a demo-
cratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry":

In his article On the Prospects of the Revolution in  
China, published'in 1926, Stalin wrote: 
"I think that the future revolutionary gov-
ernment in China will in general resemble 
in character the government we used to talk 
about in our country in 1905 with the 
difference, however, that it will be first 
and foremost an anti-imperialist government. 
This shall be an interim state power for 
China to attain non-capitalist development. 
(31) /hang's dashes indicating deletion7 
Chang goes on to say that China's state power belongs to the 
general "type of state power" described by Stalin, but then 
quotes from Mao's On People's Democratic Dictatorship the 
passage which specifically includes the national bourgeoisie. 
We may now ask, Why did Moscow attempt to blur the dis-
tinction between a democratic dictatorship of the proletar-
iat and the peasantry and a "people's ttemocratic dictator-
ship"? There are several reasons, the most obvious being 
the Chinese claim that Mao had "further developed" the 
MarNist-Leninist theory of state. 
Whether it was accurate to claim that a Communist-led 
state is anything but a dictatorship of the proletariat (i.e., 
of the Communist party)--whether the claim was true to life--
is a matter which probably did not much concern the Soviets. 
They were not interested in the accuracy of the claim: they 
were concerned with the prestige-value of the claim. 
In addition, the Soviets probably were irritated by the 
independent way in which Mao had first formulated his new 
"people's democratic dictatorship" as clearly distinct from 
the Soviet model and by the interlational significance he as-
signed it. In 1940, describing his joint dictatorship of 
several revolutionary classes as a "new democracy republic," 
Mao openly makes the following distinctions: 
On the one hand, this new democracy republic is dif-
ferent from the old European-American form of capital-
ist republic under bourgeois dictatorship, for such an 
old democratic republic is already out of date; on the 
other hand, it is also different from the socialist

republics of the type of the USSR, republics of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat; such socialist re-
publics are already flourishing in the Soviet Union 
and moreover will be established in all the capitalist 
countries and undoubtedly will become the dominant 
form of state structure and political power in all , 
industrially advanced countrie,., yet, during a given 
historical period, they are not yet suitable for the 
revOlutions in colonial and semi-colonial countries. 
Therefore the form of state to be adopted by the rev-
olutions in colonial and semicolonial countries during 
a given historical period can only be a third one, 
namely, the new democracy republic. This is the form 
for a given historical period and therefore a transi-
tional form, but an unalterable and necessary form. 
/emphasis supplied7 (32) 
That is, according to Mao, a dictatorship of the proletar-
iat is applicable to the Soviet Union and industrially ad-
vanced countries, but is by no means pertinent to the back-
ward, colonial, or semicolonial nations. 
By advancing this idea, Mao has taken a step beyond 
Marx's statement in the Critique of the Gotha Prograia, i.e., 
that the state in the transition period "can be nothing else 
but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat." Mao 
insists that for backward countries, the "state can be noth-
ing else but the revolutionary people's democratic dictator-
ship" or a "people's dictatorship." 
Chinese Communist theorists are avare that Mao's "peo-
ple's democratic dictatorship" is a revision of Marx and 
have in effect said so. Thus in October 1953, theorist Chi 
Yun says: 
The problem of the transition period had been raised 
in Marx's Critique of the Gotha Program, 1875, when 
he wrote: "Between capitalist and socialist 51c7 
society is the period of the revolutionary trans-
formation of the one into the other. There corresponds 
to this also a political transition period in which the 
state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship 
of the proletariat."

But at that time there was yet no practical experience 
in the building of socialism which could be used. 
Marx was therefore able to bring forth this problem 
only as a principle. (33) 
Chi then says that Lenin found the concrete road for "Russia's 
transition" which was further developed by Stalin, but that 
the form adopted by China "differs from that of the Soviet 
Union and other people's democratic states because original-
ly we were not a capitalist nation, but rather a semicolonial, 
semifeudal nation." China's form, he concludes, was "dis-
covered" by Mao, who advanced the political theory of the 
"people's democratic distatorship." 
Stalin's did not regard Mao's revision of Marx's dic-
tatorship of the proletariat as an academic point; on the 
contrary, it was a practical matter. Acceptance of the 
slogan "people's dictatorship" by Communist parties in back-
ward countries would afford a new channel for the spread of 
Chinese influence among these parties at Soviet expense. (34) 
? Furthermore, Stalin had "predicted" in 1926 that the 
state form in China would resemble Lenin's two-class dic-
tatorship, and Stalin was not a man who would permit his 
foresight on any matter to be taken lightly. 
There is evidence that the Chinese were successful in 
inducing some acceptance of the Mao slogan. Burmese Commu-
nist, Myat Htoo, stated in April 1953 that the Communist par-
ty in Burma mUst "set up a dictatorship of four classes: 
the workers, the peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the 
national bourgeoisie." (35) Also in 1953, the Indonesian 
Communists used Mao's slogan of "people's dictatorship" in 
their Draft Program and Election Manifesto. The Draft Pro-
gram, approved in October 1953, stated that, "consizier'ing 
the backwardness of our economy, the IndoneSian Communist 
party hold that the future government should nut be one of 
the 'dictatorship of the proletariat, but rather a govern-
men of people's dictatorship," (36) The Indonesian Commu-
nist party's Election Manifesto of 1954 declared: "The 
party must carry though a people's dictatorship...A people's 
dictatorship means the rule of workers, peasants, intellec-
tuals, and petty and national bourgeoisie (enterpreneurs)... 
Without a :people's dictatorship, there can be no complete 
independence and Democracy for Indonesia.0.," (37) The dic-
tatorship of several revolutionary classes was also incorpor-
ated into the program of the Malayan Communist party. (38)

Use of the Chinese slogan by these Asian Communist rar-
ties suggests that they rejected a Soviet effort to impose on 
Aian Communist movements Lenin's formula of a two-class 
workers'-peasants' -- dictatorship, in line with Stalin's 
192(3 "prediction." 
The Scientific Conference in Moscow in November 1951 had 
laid it down that, "People's democracy in countries of the Orient 
is a specific form of the revolutionary democratic dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry..." (39), and in,October, A. So-
bolev had already written in Bol'shevik that the first stage of 
people's democracy is a revolution In the course of which peo-
ple's democracy emerges as the organ of revolutionary power, 
which is in content something like a dictatorship of the working 
class and peasantry." (40) 
The theory of "people's democracy," which was developed by 
Soviet theorists in 1947, may have been taken, in part, from Mao's 
1939-45 theory of "new democracy." (41) There are many striking 
similarities between the two theories: both contain concepts of 
a new type of transition to socialism based on a coalition of 
classes, land redistribution as a "bourgeois democratic" measure 
playing a large role in the transition period, "feudal vestiges" 
and the foreign enemy as forces which cause the union of the pa-
triotic bourgeoisie with other revolutionary classes, and tempo-
rary rejection of the dictatorship of the proletariat as the 
state form. (42) 
At the :same time, Mao's idea of the dictatorship of a bloc 
or "front" of several classes -- rather than of one class -- ap-
pears in G. M. Dimitrov's speech at the Seventh Comintern Congress 
in 1935. According to Dimitrov', a "people's front" government, 
which was to be broader than a united front government, should 
be established in Europe. It would include the workers, peas-
ants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and certain "advanced sections" 
of the bourgeois intellectuals (intelligentsia). (43) The Res-
olution of the.peventh Congress ordered the sections of the In-
ternational, if possible, "to create a proletarian united front 
government or an anti-fascist people's front government, which 
is not yet a government of proletarian dictatorship...*." lim-
phasis in original/ (44) The workers would not yet be ready to 
rise under Communist leadership "for the achievement of Soviet 
power." (45) 
These statements of 1935 come close to Mao's 1939 and 1940 
remarks on a "joint dictatorship" of several revolutionary classes

which was to include the national capitalists. But neither 
Dimitrov nor the Resolution called for inclusion of the national 
capitalists in the "people's front government." The similarity 
between the Dimitrov and Mao formulations appears to be the ex-
plicit, temporary rejection of the dictatorship of the prole-
tariat; Cor Mao, however, this rejection became permanent.. 
If Dimitrov in 1935 anticipated one aspect of Mao's theory 
of a people's government -- rejection of the dictatorship of the 
peolotarint -- he was, in 1948, eager to dispel the notion that 
Cowmunist regimes could be anything but such a dictatorship: ' 
Embodying the rule of the toilers under the leadership 
of the working clans, the people's democracy...can and 
must successfully perform its functions of proletarian 
dictatorship for the liquidation of capitalist elements 
and the organization of a socialist economy. (46) 
For his part, Mao clung to his idea of a joint dictatorship or 
a "people's democratic dictatorship" even when, in 1953, the 
first five year plan for China was introduced and the "transi-
tion to socialism" was declared in progress. 
To enter this transition period, that is, to begin the 
"construction of socialism," without proclaiming a dictatorship 
of the proletariat was unprecedented in Communist theory. After 
1943, all the Eastern European "people's democracies" were de-
clared to be "performing the functions of" proletarian dictator-
ship, although they were states without the "Soviet form" and 
were, therefore, not as advanced as the Soviet Union. They 
moved to exclude the national capitalists from their structure 
as the "construction of socialism" began. (47) 
In contrast, the Chinese continued their independent 
course, as the CCP led by Mao demonstrated that Stalin's theo-
rists might drum the Eastern European leaders into line but 
could not bend the independent leader of China, In July 1951, 
Hu Chiao-mu, author of the standard history of the CCP, stated 
emphatically in his work that: 
In the present historical period, the PRC still permits 
the national bourgeoisie to exist. Herein lies the dif-
ference between people's democracy in China and people's 
democracy in the countries of southeast Europe. (48)

Who, in 1953, China's "transition to socialism" was announced, 
the people's democratic dictatorship was held to be the proper 
form for attaining socialism. By a dialectical twist, one Chi-
nese theorist denied that a continuation of the "alliance and 
coalition with the national bourgeoisie could be held a weaken-
ing of the class struggle." (49) Again by a dialectical stwist, 
yet another theorist denied that there was a real ("essential") 
difference between the state power of proletarian dictatorship 
and the people's democratic dictatorship (50); the difference 
was only a matter of "form." Soviet theorists agreed that this 
was so. 
A dialectical compromise appears to have been worked out ' 
between Moscow and Peiping. The new Chinese-Soviet view that 
the people's democratic dictatorship was only a different "form" 
of proletarian dictatorship apparently was intended to bring 
Mao's formulation a step closer to the mainstream of Leninism 
and, therefore, to Soviet theory. For Lenin had conceded that 
"The transition from capitalism to Communism will certainly 
bring a great variety and abundance of political  forms, but 
the essence will inevitably be only one: the dictatorship of 
the proletariat." (51) A-Mphasis supplied7 Yet the Chinese 
maintain that a "peoplei-s democratic dic-fatorship" is suffi-
ciently different from proletarian dictatorship to warrant re-
tention of Mao's slogan. Thus the dialectical distinction per-
mitted the Chinese to have their cake and eat it too: differ-
ent in "form" and similar in "essence." 
Speaking of this well-known philosophical distinction in 
the works of Aristotle, Bertrand Russell stated in his A His-
tory of Western Philosophy (1945) that the concept of "essence" 
is " muddle-headed...incapable of precision." Soviet and Chi-
nese theorists in 1953 did not desire precision; what they de-
sired was ambiguity, and they attained it. 
Liu Shao-chi gave the new Chinese-Soviet view considerable 
prominence by stating the ambiguous formula at the Eighth CCP 
Congress in September 1956: "...the people's democratic dic-
tatorship has in essence become a form of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat." (52) 
This was a pill which even Khru9hchev would permit himself 
to swallow, and at the Chinese embassy in Moscow he acknowledged 
on 26 November 1956 that the Chinese had established a "people's 
democratic dictatorship." As Pravda expressed it at the time,

no real difference between proletarian &ctatorship and people's

CCP as it is by the CPSU. 
In theory, continued existence of the bourgeo!_sie as a 
class is a revision of Marx and Lenin and, in the M,:trxist-Leninist 
sense, Mao is a revisionist. In practice, the Communist dictator-
ship in China is applied to non-capitalists as well as capitalists 
with a vigor and terror that is offensive even to some members of 
the bloc.

The road taken by the Chinese people in de-
feating imperialism...is the road that should 
be taken by the peoples of many colonial and. 
semi-colonial countries in their fight for 
national independence and people's democracy... 
This is the road of Mao Tse-tung. (Shanghai , 
Wen Hui Pao, 25 November 1949) 
But two years later, Moscow changed the line 
and apparently prevailed on the Chinese for a 
time to discard their effort to impose Mao's 
revolutionary-military model on other Asian 
Communist movements. The concept, "Mao Tse-
tung's road" -- a feature of Chinese propaganda 
since Liu's speech of November 1949 -- disap-
peared from Chinese publications in November 
1951. 
This abrupt turn resulting in silence took place 
simultaneously with the presentation of a report 
to the Scientific Conference held in the Orien-
tal Studies Institute of the Academy of Sciences 
USSR by the principal speaker, Ye. ?Zhukov, in 
November 1951. In his report, Zhukov had said 
that, "it would be risky to regard the Chinese 
revolution as some kind of 'stereotype' for 
people's-democratic revolutions in other coun-
tries of Asia." (Cf. "On the Character of Pecu-
liarities of People's Democracy in Countries

Although the line of "Mao Tse-tung's road" was 
thereby temporarily held in check by Moscow, 
shortly after Stalin's death in March 1953, 
several Asian Communist parties openly accepted 
another of Mao's views -- viz., the "people's 
democratic dictatorship" or "people's dictator-
ship."

Sobolev applies the Lenin formula to China in the way 
Stalin had applied it: "The revolutionary power which 
has been established in China as a result of the vic-
tory of the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal revolution 
is, in its content, something like a democratic dicta-
torship of the working class and peasantry." 
There was, however, at least one instance in which a 
Soviet writer did not use Lenin's formula but Mao's. 
It is significant that this occurred after Stalin's 
death. Colonel A. Martynov, reviewing the first three 
volumes of Mao's Seleciad Works in the organ of the 
USSR Ministry of VeYgnseT?RFasnaya Zvezda, 1 December 
1953, says: 
"Creatively developing the ideas of Leninism, 
Mao Tse-tung, in his works, The Chinese Revo-
lution and the CCP and On New Democracy, slaaved 
that the victory of the bourgeois-damocratic rev-
olution in China under the leadership of the pro-
letariat would inevitably lead to the establish-
ment of a people's democratic system with a dic-
tatorship 'of the alliance of all anti-imper-
ialist and anti-feudal forces led by the prole-
tariat." The credit given Mao by Martynov is a 
striking departure from Soviet writers' earlier 
treatment of his view of the future Communist 
dictatorship.

41. Professor Benjamin Schwartz has posed this question in his 
excellent article, "China and tha Soviet 'Theory of Peo-
ple's Democracy,? Problems of Commlnism, No. 5, Volume 3, 
September-October 195T, p. 1-07-'07-15articular import... 
was Varga's use of the phrases 'democracy of a new type' 
and 'new democracy. It Invites the speculation that 
at this time, Soviet theoreticians were paying some at-
tention to Mao Tse-tung' s 'theoretical contribution' to 
Marxism-Leninsm.... There is a strong resemblance be-
tween /Yeatures of7 Varga's 'democracy of a new type' and 
Mao's Thew democracy." 
Discussing the Soviet theory of 1947, Professor Samuel L. 
Sharp says, "Mao Tse-tung seems to be the author of 
the term 'new democracy.'" (Cf. Samuel L. Sharp: "New 
Democracy: A Soviet Interpretation," American Per-
spective Volume 1, No. 6, November 194= 
H. Gordon Skilling says that among Soviet theorists in 
1947 "the expression 'new democracy' was for some time 
In common usage. This was gradually superseded, with
explanation, during 1948 by the term 'people's 
democracy,' which is invariably used at the present time." 
(Cf. H. Gordon Skilling: "People's Democracy in Soviet 
Theory," Soviet Studies, Volume 3, No. 1, July 1951 and 
Volume 3, No, 2, December 1951.)

The revision of the theory of "people's democracy" by 
Soviet writers in 1948 as a result of the Stalin-Tito 
break and signs of polycentrism in Eastern Europe, 
together with the final CCP takeover in China in 1949, 
obviated any further pretense by Mao that a genuine

democracy, Trainin stated that "the main driving forces 
of the new democracy are the people: the workers and 
peasants, who are joined by the progressive part of the 
bourgeoisie, its intelligentsia, and various democratic 
strata of the petty bourgeoisie." (Cf. I. P. Trainin:

Soviet theory, Pravda's chief editor. Pospelov, wrote on 
22 January 1949 thaT"The regime of people's democracy

tariat in suppressing and abolishing capitalist ele-
ments, thus solving the problem of the transitiJE-Trom

The preamble to the Constitution of  the People's  Repub-
lic of China (adopted 20 September 1054) states that 
Trio regime is "a people's democratic dictatorship." 
Article 5 includes "capitalist ownership" as a basic 
form of ownership of the means of production and 
Article 10 says that "The state protects the right of 
capitalists to own means of production and other cap-
ital according to law." (Cf. Constitution of the Peo-
ple's Republic of  China, ForeEri?aliiiiages Press, Peking, 
104, pp. 3, 10, and 12.)

50. "In essence, there is no difference between state-capitalism 
under a dictatorship of the proletariat and state-cap-
italism under a people's democratic dictatorship..." (Cf. 
Ti Chao-pai: "State-Capitalism in Our Transition Period,", 
Hsueh-hsi, 2 February 1954.) 
Other writers stated in late 1953 and 1954 that "in es-
sence" the two dictatorships were similar. 
The logic of this approach escaped many. Theorist Yu 
Kuang-yuan ventured an explanation to party members: 
"People might ask: Since the people's democratic dicta-
torship in China is now essentially a form of the dicta-
torship of the proletaiiat, how are we to explain the 
fact that the national bourgeoisie has the right to vote? 
....Under present conditions in China, the majority of 
the bourgeoisie find it possible to accept socialism; 
therefore, we must keep them as our ally...and let them 
take up important work in the government at all levels 
...." ("The Class Nature of China's People's Democratic 
Dictatorship," Hsueh-hsi, 2 November 1956.) Yu also 
stated that the?EaTTNIThts were needed for economic 
construction -- an argument which Liu Shao-chi had 
stressed in his political report to the CCP's Eighth 
Congress in September 1956.
