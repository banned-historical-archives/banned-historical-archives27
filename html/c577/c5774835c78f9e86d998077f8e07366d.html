 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14' April 1960
 During Prime Minister Ver-
 woerd's recuperation from                       the
 9 April attack on his life,the
 South African Government     is
 being led by Minister of Lands
 Paul Sauer, a member of the
 relatively moderate wing of
 the ruling Nationalist party.
 Sauer and other government
 spokesmen have indicated that
 Verwoerd's policies will be
 continued.   In fact, the Na-
 tionalist drive for total ra-
 cial separation may be inten-
 sified in an effort to reduce
 South Africa's overwhelming
 dependence on African labor.
 Police raids and arrests  in
 African areas are continuing.
 With the outlawing of the
 two main African nationalist
 organizations--the African Na-
 tional-Congress and the Pan-Af-
 ricanist Congress --and'_the ar-
 rest of most of their leaders,
 Africans have lost most bf their
 ability to organize effective
 protests.
 The continuing crisis may
 have aggravated the splits with-
 in the European population. Al-
 though the English community,
 represented in Parliament by
 the United party, has supported
 the government's efforts to sup-
 press the Africans, United par-
 ty leaders have called for an
 investigation of the causes of
 the disturbances once the ten-
 sion abates.   Moreover,  the
 English population, which domi-
 nates South African industry
 and wishes to retain a large
 urban African labor pool, will

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14 April 1960
 Exchanges of visits by
 cultural, labor, and agricul-
 tural missions between Cuba
 and the Soviet Union and Com-
 munist China are increasingly
 reported, and Castro plans to
 establish diplomatic relations
 with these regimes and other
 Communist countries.  However,
 there is no evidence that the
 USSR has yet taken action on
 the expressed agreement of
 Mikoyan and Castro in February
 to resume diplomatic relations
 "at a convenient time."   Mos-
 cow may wish to assess reac-
 tion to the Czech move and to
 wait until after the summit
 conference in May.
 antigovernment guerrilla bands
 cou   provide the nucleus for
 an eventually much larger and
 more serious challenge to
 Castro's position.
 The growing number of defec-
 tions from the regime has
 caused widespread comment in
 other Latin American countries
 adverse to the Castro regime.
 The Cuban air attache in Mexico
 defected on 11 April, declaring
 his conviction that Castro has
 betrayed the Cuban revolution.
 He said the only road now open
 for him is again to take up
 arms,  this time to fight Castro.
 The resignation on 7 April of
 the Cuban ambassador to UN of-
 fices in Geneva, Andres Vargas
 Gomez, is perhaps even more
 significant, since he is widely
 respected and capable and is
 representative of professional
 and business elements who have
 become thoroughly disillusioned
 with Castro..
 In its plans for the "hun-
 gry nations" conference in Ha-
 vana in September, Cuba now seems
 resigned to accept unofficial
 delegations to an obviously non-
 governmental conference.   This is
 indicated by the recent Cuban in-
 vitation to ten Honduran students
 and pro-Castro members of the Hon-
 duran congress.   The conference
 will thus be a far cry from Cas-
 tro's original plan for a meeting
 of ,official delegations headed by
 prominent personages, but his con-
 trol of the conference is assured
 and extensive propaganda exploita-
 tion can be expected.
 EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 As the Western foreign min-
 isters began meeting in Wash-
 ington, Moscow reverted to its
 standard propaganda line that
 influential circles in:the West
 still oppose negotiating with
 the USSR and that this continues
 to divide the alliance.    Moscow
 seized on Secretary Herter's 4
 April speech to contrast West-
 ern skepticism over the prospects
 for agreement at the summit
 with Khrushchev's public expres-
 sion of optimism following his
 talks with De Gaulle.
 The Soviet press criti-
 cized the speech as a demon-
 stration of how the "weight of
 the past" still drags US policy
 along the "inglorious cold-war
 road."   Izvestia on 9 April

 claimed that Herter used the
 "threadbare" thesis of the
 threat of aggression from the
 East to urge Western European
 countries, particularly Bonn,
 to "arm and rearm."
 Moscow also used the speech
 as "evidence" of divisions with-
 in the West.   Izvestia said
 Herter's defense of the "new"
 West Germany as a stabilizing
 factor in Europe was shown to
 be "elementary hypocrisy" by
 a London Times report that in
 his talks with Macmillan the
 secretary did not deny Germany
 could become a danger to Europe.
 Pravda claimed that the speech
 clashed with Premier Debre's
 statement on the same day
 calling for a speedy solution
 of disarmament problems, and
 was generally at odds with the
 tone set at Camp David and at
 Rambouillet, where Khrushchev
 and De Gaulle met.
 As part of the general
 propaganda build-up to place
 the West on the defensive be-
 fore the summit conference on
 16 May, Moscow has intensified
 its efforts to discredit the
 Adenauer government with a
 series of critical notes, an-
 nouncements. and press con-
 ferences
 Adenauer still favors a
 pre-summit plebiscite in West
 Berlin, but the West Berlin
 city council agreed to hold
 the plebiscite if requested by
 both the Bonn government and
 the Allies.  Consequently,
 Adenauer apparently decided to
 reserve the plebiscite idea
 for possible use at a later
 date.
 Disarmament
 The bloc delegates at the
 Geneva disarmament conference
 have stepped up pressure to
 commit the West to a set of
 general principles which could
 be referred to the summit for
 endorsement.   Following formal
 rejection of each other's plans,
 Soviet delegate Zorin suggested
 that this line of debate be
 abandoned in favor of returning
 to the United Nations resolu-
 tion as the commonly agreed
 point of departure.   He intro-
 duced a slightly refurbished
 version of the Soviet proposal,
 under the heading "Fundamental
 Principles of Complete and Gen-
 eral Disarmament." He stressed
 that the discussions had re-
 vealed certain points of mutual
 agreement which should be re-
 corded before proceeding to
 draft  'specific  :measures for..
 a treaty.
 The bloc delegates prompt-
 ly moved to establish this docu-
 ment as the basis for further
 debate by. inviting the Western
 powers to offer amendments and
 suggestions.   Zorin argued
 that areas for possible agree-
 ment were larger than the West
 admitted and cited the preamble,
 measures constituting complete
 disarmament, and the concepts
 of stages and effective controls
 contained in his list of prin-
 ciples.
 These tactics, plus the
 Soviet agreement to a long re-
 cess in the conference from

 Moscow's apparent belief that

 shift in its disarmament posi-
 tion prior to the summit con-
 ference.   The bloc delegates
 hope to obtain some agreed gen-
 eral statement, even though
 limited perhaps only to a
 treaty preamble which restates
 in effect the UN resolution.
 Test Ban Talks
 A member of the Soviet
 delegation to the test-ban talks
 has privately told a US official
 in Geneva that his delegation
 has forwarded to Moscow its
 recommendations.on the Eisen-
 hower-Macmillan statement of
 29 March which called for uni-
 lateral pledges not to test
 small underground nuclear weap-
 ons.            He added that it will
 take "some time" before a de-
 cision is reached.
 In contrast to his usual
 approach to any new Western
 move at the talks, the Soviet
 delegate has refrained from
 attacking the Western proposal.
 He has instead confined him-
 self to posing questions about
 the duration and nature of the
 proposed moratorium and on the
 details of the research and de-
 velopment program, and to re-
 stating the Soviet position
 that any moratorium obligation
 should be incorporated in the";
 test-cessation treaty and that
 the moratorium and research
 program should be conterminous.
 This cautious approach reflects
 Khrushdhev's apparent desire
 to have   the main  elements
 of  a test-ban' treaty ready
 for decision  at   the May
 summit meeting.
 In discussing  the   is-
 sues to be   taken up  by   the,
 heads of  government, Soviet
 spokesmen continue   to point
 to a test-ban  treaty as of-
 fering   the best possibility
 for agreement.

 EAST HIGHLIGHTS
 Iraq              1
 The  Iraqi scene this past
 week has been dominated. by the
 visit of Soviet First        Deputy
 Premier Mikoyan, who arrived on
 8 April.   He has  talked  with
 Qasim several times, but no of-
 ficial pronouncements have been
 made.   Mikoyan is being given
 the usual tour--the hanging
 gardens of Babylon, model vil-
 lages, and the US-built Daura
 oil refinery near Baghdad.   He
 is scheduled to hold a press
 conference before returning to
 Moscow on 16 April.
 Mikoyan has been greeted
 by large crowds, and the Com-
 munist press has marked the
 visit,_by praising Soviet eco-
 nomic assistance.   One nation-
 alist paper, however, published
 an "open letter to Comrade Miko-
 yan" declaring that the "im-
 perialists" could not have de-
 famed "your reputation one
 tenth as much" as the Iraqi
 Communists have. Soviet pub-
 licity has been confined large-
 ly to accounts of Mikoyan's
 statements of friendship for
 the Iraqi people and to descrip-
 tions of his activities.
 There have been no signif-
 icant clashes  or disturbances
 during the visit.   However,

 Mikoyan's arrival  to chastise
 the leftist-run Iraqi press
 association and the Communist
 press for creating         divisive
 influences in the country.
 His comments were particularly
 aimed at articles criticizing
 the government.
 On 10 April the president
 of the Baghdad  Military Court
 struck  out  at the  Communist
 press for describing 66 indi-
 viduals being tried as "honest
 fighters," stating,  "No one can
 dall.these  accused honest."
 Those referred to are  Commu-
 nists who set  up a "workers'
 court" and executed   17 anti-
 Communists after the Mosul re-
 volt in March 1959.                    A recent
 issue of Ittihad al-Shaab, the
 Communist mouthpiece, was   de-
 voted entirely to charges that
 the regime has  shown partial-
 ity toward anti-Communist par-
 ties,   has closed down                   Commu-
 nist-dominated unions  and im-
 prisoned  their  leaders,                       and
 has failed  to license peasant
 associations.    At  the  same
 time, three previously    sup-
 pressed  nationalist papers

 Libya
 On 11 April  a  minority
 bloc in the Libyan Chamber of
 Deputies launched virulent at-
 tacks on the operation of Wheel-
 us Air Base, on the "lack of re-
 spect shown by  Americans  for
 Libyan sovereignty and honor,",
 and on American "indifference"
 to Libya's economic needs. One
 of the group's spokesmen  de-
 manded that  the chamber take
 matters into its own hands
 and "annul this evil American
 treaty."
 While the Libyan Government
 still controls the majority  of
 the chamber's membership,   the
 strength  of  this   opposition
 bloc was considerably increased
 in    last January's elections.
 Earlier meetings of the newly
 elected membership were organi-
 zational;   this  is  the first
 chance the minority group   has
 had to use parliamentary debate
 to air its anti-American views.
 As "rent" for continued
 American use  of the air base,
 the prime minister and    other
 leading governmental officials
 are insisting on a substantial
 level  of American aid and    a
 commitment of funds for several
 years which would be completely
 at  the disposal of the Libyan
 Government.   The government's
 handling of the minority par-
 liamentary group on this issue
 will depend largely on the spe-
 cific size and nature of pend-
 ing new American aid proposals.

 weeks ago found the hotly dis-
 puted Palestinian "state" ques-
 tion too delicate to handle,
 (see Part III, page 6),   tried
 to tackle another controversial
 matter in Cairo last week. This
 was the UAR-sponsored proposal
 for an Arab boycott of French
 goods and the freezing of French
 assets in Arab states in protest
 against nuclear testsa in  the
 Sahara.   In mid-March, Cairo
 quietly stopped issuing further
 import permits for French goods,
 Disagreement  in the ,Arab
 League committee showed that
 few, if any, of the other Arab
 governments intend to follow
 the UAR's lead, and Cairo prob-
 ably is not pressing the issue.
 A Lebanese official publicly
 announced ':that  his  country
 would "refuse to abide by any
 Arab League recommendation for
 the boycott of France."
 While  there  has  been a
 strong adverse reaction in"all
 the Arab states to the    French
 nuclear tests, economic rela-
 tions with France are important
 to many of them.  Their goTern-
 ments prefer to express their
 opposition in. ways which db not
 entail disruption of trade or
 possible financial loss. Thus,
 most of the Arab  states  will
 probably  continue  to  concen-
 trate on protesting through
 propaganda, public demonstra-
 tions, and diplomatic notes.
 Working with the. African states,
 they will also sustain their
 pressure in the United Nations
 for a special General Assembly
 session on the issue.
 Turkey-USSR
 Ankara and Moscow issued
 simultaneous announcements on
 12 April that Premier Menderes
 would visit Moscow in July and
 Premier Khrushchev would make
 a return visit to Turkey at  a
 later date.    The  USSR since
 early 1960 had been pressing
 for such an exchange, but offi-
 cials in Ankara were reluctant
 to agree to the visits, fear-
 ing their,',,effect  on  some                                                           of
 Turkey's allies--particularly
 Iran.   The Turks apparently ac-
 quiesced to keep pace with some
 of their NATO allies in current
 efforts to improve  East-West
 relations.
 Officials.in Greece have
 already indicated fear that
 the   announcement  will cause
 internal difficulties  for the
 Karamanlis government, which
 has consistently rejected simi-
 lar Soviet overtures.                                                              Iran,
 .whose relations with the USSR
 have been severely strained
 during the past year, will also
 be under increased pressure to
 improve relations with Moscow.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Fighting      in  Algeria may
 soon intensify,   especially in
 the Tunisian border area.  The
 rebels  have  indicated  their
 desire to step up military op-
 erations as a means of improv-
 ing their international stand-
 ing.    The  build-up  by                both
 sides near the Tunisian border
 increases the possibility  of
 French incursions into Tuni-
 sian territory in pursuit                 of
 rebel units.
 French  Defense  Minister
 Messmer reported to the Senate
 Defense Committee on 6 April
 his concern over Tunisian "com-
 plicity"  in allowing the in-
 stallation of rebel training
 camps "within binocular range"
 of the Algerian frontier.  He
 added  that  French  military
 forces are not authorized to
 remedy this situation "for the
 time being."
 Meanwhile,   French Army
 headquarters in Algeria has
 declared the end of the eight-
 month campaign in the Kabylia
 Mountains, in which the French
 claim to have inflicted 5,000
 rebel casualties, and announced
 the imminent transfer of the
 seasoned Tenth Paratroop Divi-
 sion, probably to the Tunisian
 border.
 French military authori-
 ties state that they expect a
 rebel attack in force at  an
 early date,   and the press is
 giving  anticipatory  play  to
 the "right of pursuit."  The
 French have crossed the Tuni-
 sian  border                 occasionally  in
 the past, and the bombing of
 Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef in Febru-
 rary 1958 resulted in a formal
 Tunisian complaint to the UN
 Security,  Council.
 The  rebels,   who  held  a
 council of war in Tripoli from
 4 to 6 April, plan to step up
 both   military  and  political
 activity.   Spokesmen of the
 provisional  government  have
 hinted that newly arrived arms
 will permit the launching of a
 spring offensive.  The rebels,
 reportedly disappointed  at
 Khrushchev's failure to plead
 their cause.with De Gaulle, may
 send a delegation to`Communist
 China to obtain arms and to
 demonstrate their willingness
 to accept aid from any friend-
 ly source.  The rebels' moves
 to gain international accept-
 ance as belligerents have in-
 cluded "ratification" of the
 Geneva convention at the Trip-
 oli meeting, as well as efforts
 to  inaugurate  a    "foreign
 legion," presumably made up of
 Arab volunteers, for Algeria.
 Premier Debra's  visit to
 Algeria from 11 to 13 April
 concentrated on preparations
 for    the  29  May  cantonal
 elections which his government,
 in spite of the skepticism of
 of most political groups in
 France, apparently hopes will
 bring forward a new group of
 Moslems with whom Paris can
 discuss Algeria's future. While
 his  public  statements  dealt
 mostly with problems related
 to  economic  and  social
 progress, he said in a 12 April
 broadcast that a vote favoring
 independence in any referendum
 following ;paeificition would
 be disastrous and would lead
 to partition of the area. The
 rebels  have   said  they  will
 boycott the French-sponsored
 elections in Algeria, and prob-
 ably plan a campaign of terror-
 ism                                                       to inhibit Moslem partici-
 pation.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14 April 1960
 ECONOMIC CONFERENCE
 A Belgian-Congolese eco-
 nomic conference will open in
 Brussels on 25 April against a
 backdrop of growing alarm in
 Belgium over the Conga's eco-
 nomic future after it becomes
 independent on 30 June.   The
 conference is thus likely to
 be much concerned with imme-
 diate financial problems, but
 Belgium still hopes that it
 will also settle such impor-
 tant questions as the Congo's
 future ties with the Common
 Market,  the formation of a
 Belgo-Congolese Development
 Corporation, future relations
 between the Congolese and Bel-
 gian central banks, and various
 other financial and budgetary
 management problems.
 The most immediate problem
 confronting the Belgians is the
 serious flight of capital from
 the Congo since the independence
 accord was reached.   Capital
 outflow in 1959 exceeded the
 1958 level by $130,000,000,
 reflecting the persistent fear
 of disturbances and possible
 expropriation.   The capital
 repatriation in January 1960
 was $20,000,000 above last year's
 monthly average.   Although ex-
 change controls have recently
 been initiated, the Congo cen-
 tral bank's reserves have been
 seriously depleted, and there
 are apparently insufficient
 funds to meet treasury require-
 ments between now and 30 June.
 The longer term problem,
 and probably the more important
 one,  is the lack of financing
 for essential public investments.
 At a meeting with American Em-
 bassy officials in Brussels on
 5 April, Congo Minister   de
 Schrijver and his economic
 counselor estimated the 1960
 requirement at $120,000,000
 to $135,000,000.   This sum is
 ON THE BELGIAN CONGO
 over and above minor sources
 Brussels still hopes to tap and
 the $54,000,000 contribution
 Belgium will make to the Congo
 budget this year.
 Brussels says it has unsuc-
 cessfully sought Belgian-guaran-
 teed loans for this purpose from
 various European countries, as
 well as the European Common Mar-
 ket's investment bank, and now
 sees no alternative to American
 aid.   Without immediate and sub-
 stantial foreign aid,  Belgian
 officials predict there will be
 "economic and political turmoil,"
 economic stagnation, and aggrava-
 tion of the already serious un-
 employment problem, and a conse-
 quent loss of Belgian--and West-
 ern--prestige.
 The Belgians seem to have
 been slow to appreciate the eco-
 nomic implications of the Congo's
 independence and are probably
 ill prepared to cope with them.
 The $1,000,000 technical assist-
 ance program Belgium intends to
 offer, for example, seems small.
 Also illustrative of overoptimism
 is the hope expressed by Belgian
 officials that the Congolese will
 agree to permit Belgian nationals
 to continue to handle the budget,
 the banking system, and the gov-
 ernment controller's office.
 Some Congolese appreciate
 the extent to which they are
 still dependent on Belgium, but
 they will be alert to any at-
 tempt by Brussels to retrieve
 at the economic conference what
 it gave up at the political talks
 in January.   One powerful Congo-
 lese leader has indicated that
 in his view the conference should
 concentrate on such matters as
 the present financial crisis and
 Belgian budgetar  assistance to
 the new state.

 SOMALI AGITATION FOR INDEPENDENCE
 Agitation by Somali nation-
 alists for early independence
 and political unification has
 increased tension in the Horn
 of Africa, particularly between
 Ethiopia and the Somalilands.
 Local legislatures in the pro-
 tectorate of British Somaliland
 and in the Italian-administered
 trust territory of Somalia re-
 cently passed resolutions di-
 rected toward unifying the two
 territories by 1 July, when the
 trust territory is to achieve
 independence.
 To guide its protectorate
 toward independence within two
 or three years, London has re-
 formed the territory-wide legis-
 lative council so that elected
 members are in the majority.
 Elections were held last Feb-
 ruary, and London appointed four
 Somalis to ministerial positions
 in the seven-member executive
 council.   The nationalist lead-
 ers,  however, at the opening ses-
 sion of the legislature in Har-
 geisa, introduced a motion on 6
 April calling for independence
 and unity with neighboring
 Somalia by 1 July.

 14 April 1960
 Protectorate nationalists,
 taking advantage of an apparent
 change in the position of the
 trust territory government in
 favor of Somali unity, have by-
 passed official channels in
 London and Rome and have ar-
 ranged a meeting of representa-
 tives of the two Somali terri-
 tories in Mogadiscio--Somalia's
 capital--to discuss a unifica-
 tion agreement.
 Somalia's legislature, ap-
 parently anticipating the res-

 quested the Italian administra-
 tor to advise the UN of the
 "unanimous desire of all Somali
 people to be united under the

 to "freely express" their "own
 wish to be united" in an early
 UN-conducted plebiscite. While

 400 in March, compared with
 less than 10,000 per month in
 January and February.  During
 the week ending 12 April, more
 than 2,391 refugees
 fled to West Berlin
 alone--598 more than
 during the compara-
 ble week in 1959. Of
 the March total, al-
 most 11 percent were

 with a normal figure
 of about 5 percent;

 under direct supervision of the
 state.     Most of the newly col-
 lectivized farms are still
 loosely organized, but the re-
 gime will probably attempt to
 consolidate control after the
 harvest.   This in turn is like-
 ly to provoke further resistance
 and flights to the West.
 The regime will continue
 pressure for complete collec-
 tivization in the remaining dis-
 trict in the hope of being able
 to announce, prior to the sum-
 mit conference,  that East Ger-
 many is fully collectivized.
 At the same time, great efforts
 have been made to halt the flights
 by tightening security precau-
 tions on the frontier and a-
 round Berlin.
 Proceedings at the eighth
 SED central committee plenum,
 held from 30 March to 2 April,
 reveal that the regime is at-
 tempting to counter serious
 manpower shortages and low
 morale on farms by ordering
 thousands of youths to the
 countryside. The State Plan-
 ning Commission has ordered
 conversion of certain factories
 to manufacture farm machinery
 essential for the newly formed
 collectives.  More funds are to
 be provided for collectives,
 which are usually costly opera-
 tions.                                                        This reallocation of
 funds reportedly will be at the
 expense of badly needed hous-
 ing and consumer goods for the
 general populace.   Such meas-
 ures suggest that the collecti-
 vization campaign went at a
 faster pace than originally
 planned.
 The socialization campaign
 --called the "great leap for-
 ward"--is being extended to the
 "middle class."  The economic
 importance of the small shop-
 keepers, who in August still
 accounted for approximately 25
 percent of East Germany's re-
 tail trade, may be such that
 the regime will deal somewhat
 more.cautiously with them than
 with independent peasants.
 CHOU EN-LAPS TRIP THROUGH ASIA
 Communist China's Premier
 Chou En-lai, accompanied by
 Foreign Minister Chen Yi and a
 party of 20, has left Peiping
 for a tour of South and South-
 east Asia.   His major effort
 will be directed toward attain-
 ing some agreement with Indian
 Prime Minister Nehru concerning
 the countries' boundary dispute.

 In Rangoon, Chou pre-

 The Chinese will portray Chou's

 more difficult for Nehru to

 that it will develop into a ma-
 jor, high-pressure campaign.
 The social and political im-
 plications of the urban commune
 program are likely to be of
 more immediate significance
 than the economic effects, and
 Peiping presumably hopes it
 will result in a higher degree
 of regimentation and control in
 the cities.
 Premier Chou En-lai's
 speech at the closing session
 of the congress on internation-
 al relations and foreign policy.
 added nothing to Peiping's pres-
 ent lines.   He gave only routine
 support to Soviet policies, and
 his attacks against the United
 States contrasted sharply with
 Moscow's relatively moderate
 tone.   He recently told the
 Indian ambassador that once
 Sino-American issues were "set-
 tled," Soviet and Chinese at-
 titudes would be "identical."
 Chou had originally been
 scheduled to present a,"govern-
 ment work report," but this was
 dropped from the congress'
 agenda just before the opening
 session.   In the light of other
 indications that the opening
 may have been delayed for sev-
 eral days, this suggests that
 lines to be taken at the con-
 gress were not formulated in
 detail until the last minute.
 Mao Tse-tung attended the
 opening and closing sessions
 of the congress, as did Vice
 Premier Chen Yun, whose inac-
 tivity for almost a year has
 given rise to speculation that
 he was out of favor.   Chen,
 described by a Western corre-    25X1
 spondent as "lean and haggard,"
 was listed in his usual place
 as senior   vice   premier.
 CHINA'S LONG-RANGE AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM
 China's National People's
 Congress, which ended on 10 April,
 endorsed a long-range "Program
 for Agricultural Development
 (1956-67)" but called for ef-
 forts to complete it two to
 three years ahead of schedule.
 This program, announced in
 early 1956 and revised in the
 fall of 1957, is a loosely
 drawn outline of measures to
 improve agriculture.   It lacks
 specific provisions for its
 realization, but is said nev-
 ertheless to have provided the
 "impetus" for many of the suc-
 cesses achieved in agriculture
 in the past few years.
 In discussing the program
 before the congress, party agri-
 cultural spokesman Tan Chen-lin
 attempted to show that in the
 "leap forward" of the past two
 years, certain objectives had
 already been surpassed and
 others realized to a large ex-
 tent.   He claimed that the yields
 called for by 1967 have already
 been achieved on one fourth of
 China's grain acreage and on
 more than 40 percent of total
 cotton acreage.
 The country's hog popula-
 tion and average per capita farm
 income last year reached levels
 which the program had set for
 1962.   Some two thirds of the
 program's target for irrigated
 acreage has already been met,
 Tan said, but he cautioned that
 completion of a reservoir does
 not automatically confer irriga-
 tion benefits on nearby acreage
 --as Peiping's statisticians
 have sometimes implied.

 Good progress was also re-
 ported by Tan toward the pro-
 gram's goals of extending the
 area sown to improved seed
 strains, planting more high-
 yield crops (like corn), rais-
 ing the multiple-cropping in-
 dex, bringing new areas under
 cultivation,  and initiating
 greater research in agronomy.
 Mechanization and moderniza-
 tion are proceeding more rapid-
 ly than had been envisaged in
 the original program.
 Tan revealed, however, that
 the situation in agriculture is
 not completely optimistic.
 Grain yields set for 1967, one
 of the few specific targets
 set forth in the program, im-
 ply the production of 360,000,-
 000-375,000,000 tons.   This
 would mean an average annual
 increase of about 7 percent
 over the 1957 harvest--the last
 crop before the "leap forward."
 While this is a more conserva-
 tive figure than the claimed
 increase of 21 percent per year
 between 1957-1959, it is still
 an unrealistic goal.   The rel-
 ative modesty of the 1967 goal,
 together with Tan's emphasis
 on the "arduous" task ahead,
 suggests that even Peiping may
 regard some earlier "leap for-
 ward" claims as exaggerated.
 Tan takes note of the vast
 changes which have taken place
 in the Chinese countryside since
 the program was first made pub-
 lic in early 1956.   The regime
 has shifted rapidly from lower
 level cooperatives through col-
 lective farms to the present
 communes.
 Tan intimates that future
 changes will be worked out with-
 in the commune framework.  He
 says the,promised move from the
 present system of ownership
 mainly at the production-brigade
 level to ownership mainly at
 the commune level will require
 several "conditions"--average
 income of commune members must
 reach 150-200 yuan (as against
 85 yuan last year), "poor"
 brigades must reach the income
 levels of advanced ones, and
 mechanization must reach "cer-
 tain proportions"--all of which
 indicate that complete rural      25X1

 reliance may be placed on the
 underground Pathet Lao insur-
 gent movement as the  main
 means for gaining control of
 the country.
 The government has been
 fairly successful in inducing
 the principal anti-Communist
 political groupings--former
 Premier Phoui's Rally of the
 Lao People (RLP) and the. Com-
 mittee for Defense of National
 Interests (CDNI) --to limit the
 number of rival anti-Communist
 candidates seeking election.
 Government-approved'candidates
 will be running  unopposed  or
 opposed  only by other RLP or
 CDNI candidates in 30  of the
 59 electoral districts.
 By means of a highly re-
 strictive electoral ordinance
 and other administrative strat-
 agems, the government was able
 to limit the number of candi-
 dates from  the NLHS  and  the
 fellow-traveling  Santiphab
 party to nine each. Sympathiz-
 ers among  the  "independents"
 bring the total number of Com-
 munist and Communist-associated
 candidates to an estimated 25.
 There are indications that the
 government  may  take  further
 steps  to  ensure  that only a
 bare minimum of Communist can-
 didates are elected.
 The American Embassy  in
 Vientiane believes that, with-
 out rigging by the government,
 the NLHS and allied candidates
 could win from 5 to 15 seats.
 The embassy expects the RLP to
 win more seats than  the CDNI-
 sponsored candidates,but feels
 the two groups may be so close
 in size  as  to render the in-
 vestiture of a new premier dif-
 ficult when the new                                                                 assembly
 convenes on 10 May.
 The Communists may foresee
 a real possibility of a split
 in the anti-Communist ranks in
 the new assembly, which would
 give the leftist bloc much
 greater scope fbr manuever.
 This c#lculation is probably
 an important factor behind the
 Communists' seeming willing-
 ness to permit the elections
 to be held in relative peace.
 Their propaganda has warned,
 however, that if the "American
 interventionists"  and  their
 "lackeys"--the CDNI--prevent
 NLHS and other  "progressive"
 candidates from winning,  the
 elections will be null and void
 in their view, and there  will
 .be a recrudescence of guerrilla
 warfare by the Pathet Lao.
 Late reports indicate the NLHS
 and  the Santiphab  may  with-
 draw                                                               at  least  some  of

 stani Government and as Ayub's
 designated successor.   The new
 governor may view his assign-
 ment to a post 1,200 miles away
 from the central government
 and army headquarters, both of
 which are located in Rawalpindi,
 as a demotion, since it removes
 him from the center of power.
 There has been speculation,
 however, that Ayub ha^ under
 consideration giving Azam a
 special title--"vice president"
 has been mentioned--to confirm
 him in his number-two position.
 Azam's departure may en-
 courage the other members to
 jockey for positions of greater
 influence, with Minister of
 Interior Sheikh taking a promi-
 nent part in the maneuvering.
 Sheikh has been frequently
 mentioned in rumors circulated
 by opponents of the regime as
 eager to increase his own
 power, even at the expense of
 Ayub.  At the same time, the
 announced changes will probably
 lead regime opponents, particu-
 larly the ousted politicians
 and their followers, to claim
 that the Ayub government is
 unstable.
 Azam has a reputation for
 getting things done, and his
 assignment may be intended to
 demonstrate that the central
 government views economic prog-
 ress in East Pakistan as a
 priority objective.   He will
 probably try to bring about
 early economic improvement, but,
 as a West Pakistani and an out-
 sider, he may offend provincial
 sensitivities in his drive for
 greater efficiency and harder
 work.   Many East Pakistanis will
 probably find cause for com-
 plaint in the appointment of
 a West Pakistani as governor
 and are unlikely to be mollified
 by the appointment of East Paki-
 stan's former governor to the
 central cabinet.
 President Ayub has appointed
 the Khan of Kalabagh, a prominent
 Pushtoon who has been serving
 as chairman of the Pakistan In-
 dustrial Development Corpora-
 tion,  as the new governor of
 West Pakistan.   He probably
 hopes this move will strengthen
 Pakistan's position  in  its

 CEYLON'S ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES
 Prospects for any early
 improvement in Ceylon's deteri-
 orating economic situation have
 been dimmed by the failure of
 any party to win a majority in
 the national elections in March.
 The island's economic decline
 under Prime Minister Bandara-
 naike during the last three and
 one half- years was accelerated
 in the series of political
 crises which began in mid-1959
 and culminated in. the dissolu-
 tion of Parliament last December.
 The tenuous backing of Dudley
 Senanayake's new minority gov-
 ernment and the probability that
 instability will continue, at
 least until new elections can
 be held,make it appear likely
 that the economic decline will
 continue throughout 1960.
 Chief among Ceylon's eco-
 nomic ills is a record trade
 deficit of $52,710,000 during
 1959.   Before 1957, there was
 usually an annual surplus.  The
 increased volume and higher
 costs of imported consumer goods

 were primarily responsible for
 the deficit, as prices for ma-
 jor exports were favorable and
 total export earnings for 1959
 increased over 1958.
 The balance-of-payments
 position has deteriorated con-
 siderably since 1958, and the
 deficit last year was $47,250,-
 000.   External assets fell
 during 1959 from $185,000,000
 to $145,000,000, enough to pay
 for about four months of im-
 ports.   This small reserve ca-
 pacity points up the island's
 vulnerability to flood, drought,
 or unfavorable shifts in ex-
 ternal trade patterns.
 The government's cash op-
 erating deficit of $86,730,000
 for the past fiscal year, Octo-
 ber 1958-September 1959, is an
 increase of more than 100 per-
 cent over the 1957 deficit.
 The high rate of government
 expenditures has contributed
 to expanding the money supply,
 which rose sharply during the
 last quarter of 1959, keeping
 prices high and maintaining
 the demand for imports.
 The difficulties of fi-
 nancing the deficit and lower-
 ing the cost of living have
 increased considerably.  The
 total of treasury bills out"
 standing reached its legal
 limit in mid-January, and the
 government recently announced
 that it would cost $18,000,000
 to reduce the subsidized price
 of rice, which other major
 parties promised during the
 election campaign.
 The government has a few
 favorable factors on its side.
 Production of major  export
 crops was satisfactory in 1959,
 Colombo has contracted for suf-
 ficient food imports to cover
 1960 requirements, and the ab-
 sence of disruptive strikes
 since mid-1959 has resulted in
 improved operations at Colombo
 port, Ceylon's major gateway
 to the outside world.
 Such advantages are heav-
 ily outweighed by adverse po-
 litical factors, however.
 Even if the Senanayake govern-
 ment survives its first par-
 liamentary vote on 22 April,
 its minority status will severe-
 ly curtail its power to im-
 plement proposed economic re-
 forms.

 American investments in
 Peru, which have risen sharply
 in recent years because of
 favorable Peruvian laws and
 relatively stable political and

 oil companies has been unusually
 bitter.  The International Pe-
 troleum Company, a Standard Oil
 subsidiary and Peru's largest
 producer, faces possible an-
 nulment of rights to its oil
 properties, a threat which
 rightist and Communist figures
 have exploited politically. A
 new financial group, backed by
 a politically powerful cousin
 of President Prado, is appar-
 ently using the possibility of
 nationalist agitation to break
 into International Petroleum's
 distribution monopoly.   Another
 US petroleum company was de-
 nounced in Congress and the
 press late last year for "vio-
 lating" Peru's national sover
 eignty--a charge also frequent-
 ly levied against Standard's
 subsidiary.
 The US-owned copper com-
 pany at Toquepala, whose newly
 inaugurated mine largely ac-
 counts for Peru's expected 27-
 percent increase in export
 revenues for 1960, is strongly
 criticized by the government-

 party, because it discourages
 unionization.   A further cause
 of US-Peruvian friction is a

 A serious new anti-Ameri-

 in 1958 brought in 12 percent

 EUROPE'S TRADE CONFLICT
 Although conciliatory
 statements from Bonn and De
 Gaulle's recent visit to London
 have somewhat relaxed the ten-
 sion, no generally acceptable
 solution is in sight for the
 basic issues dividing. Europe's
 trade blocs--the European Eco-
 nomic Community (EEC) and the
 European Free Trade Association
 (EFTA).   A late March meeting,
 the first all-European trade
 talks in more than a year, pro-
 duced merely another investigat-
 ing committee--whose findings
 are likely to be used by each
 side to justify its own posi-
 tion.
 Further talks are not sched-
 uled until late May, by which
 time the issue may have been
 decided--if, as'still seems
 likely, the EEC's governing
 council decides on 10 May to
 accept EEC President Hallstein's
 plan to speed up the estab-
 lishment  of  the  Common Mar-
 ket.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14 April 1960
 Much of the re-
 cent rancor--as evi-
 denced by the uproar
 over Prime Minister
 Macmillan's alleged
 ttack on the  EEC
 during his Washing-
 ton visit--is attrib-
 utable:,,, to the full-
 er realization of the
 decisive importance
 of the Hallstein
 plan.   The EFTA was
 set up in the belief
 that, by matching
 the internal tariff
 reductions of the
 EEC and persuading
 it to reciprocate,
 no trade preferences
 --within Europe--
 would arise,   This
 effort to achieve a
 European free trad-
 ing area--by a round-
 about t,way--could suc-
 ceed, however, only
 if the EEC agreed to
 postpone indefinitely
 the effective imple-
 mentation of its com-
 mon external tariff
 and thereby to forego
 the objective of
 creating a full cus-
 toms union.
 In the eyes of
 Hallstein and his col-
 leagues,   such  a
 sacrifice of basic
 principle would be
 European Free Trade Association (Outer Seven
 European Economic Community Common Market
 fatal to the Common Market, and
 they have offered their speed-
 up plan in part to precipitate
 a decision while economic and
 political circumstances are
 still favorable.   However, even
 an initial step by the EEC to-
 ward application of its common
 tariffs would be a major tacti-
 cal defeat for the EFTA, and
 might result in equally serious
 long-term consequences. Should
 the possibility of an "easy"
 association with the EEC seem
 to be foreclosed, some of the
 "reluctant" members of the EFTA
 whose trading interests are
 primarily with the EEC might
 feel they have no alternative
 but direct affiliation with the
 Common Market.
 Many in the EEC are ob-
 viously still sensitive to the
 charge they are opening up a
 permanent rift in Europe. Nev-
 ertheless,  since it was first
 announced on 3 March, the Hall-
 stein thesis has attracted in-
 creased support.   The EEC's

 European Parliamentary Assembly,
 which represents a rough cross-
 section of Continental parlia-
 mentary opinion, almost unani-
 mously endorsed the plan on 31
 March.
 President Gronchi's invi-
 tation to Amintore Fanfani to
 form a cabinet reveals Gronchi's
 determination to push for a
 center-left government as the
 solution to the long-standing
 dilemma of the Christian Demo-
 crats (CD).   Such a move to
 the left risks alienating con-
 servative ecclesiastical and
 economic interests within or
 allied with the party.   Fer-
 nando Tambroni's effort to
 form an all-CD cabinet col-
 lapsed because the party's left
 wing, mindful of the general
 leftward trend of the electo-v,
 rate, refused to accept rightist
 support.
 Although an attempt to form
 a center-left government under
 Antonio Segni during the early
 stages of the crisis was blocked
 by conservative forces, there
 is a good chance that the sec-
 ?ond attempt under Fanfani will
 succeed.  The revolt within the
 Christian Democratic party
 against participation in a gov-
 ernment dependent on the votes
 of the neo-Fascists, as would
 have been the case with the
 Tambroni government, provided
 a rough gauge of the strength
 of anti-rightist feeling with-
 in the party.
 The present crisis has
 lasted much longer than any
 previous postwar Italian crisis,
 and there have been rumors of a
 possible coup attempt followed
 by a general strike initiated by
 the left. Fearx~that .ItajS,!s in-

 spurs to a solution, however
 provisional.     Regardless of
 the crisis, Antonio Segni,
 foreign minister by virtue of
 his inclusion in the Tambroni
 cabinet, will take part in the
 Washington pre-summit confer-
 ence.
 In the event
 Fanfani does not ob-

 will probably favor

 The Liberals--who
 precipitated the cCi -

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 STATUS OF THE SINO-SOVIET BLOC'S ECONOMIC DRIVE
 The Sino-Soviet bloc last
 year added $1 billion to the
 total amount of aid it has ex-
 tended to free world countries.
 Moscow hopes by this program
 to foster a permanently ex-
 panded relationship with un-
 derdeveloped countries through
 a sustained growth in trade.
 However, the bilateral trading
 practices of the bloc, the pri-
 orities of intrabloc trade,

 consisted largely of military
 assistance, now is principally
 oriented toward providing cred-
 its for economic development.
 Almost no new military aid was
 included in the $1.04 billion
 in bloc credits and grants ex-
 tended in 1959, and the more
 than $550,000,000 extended dur-
 ing the first quarter of 1960
 was entirely for economic pur-
 poses.
 Moscow's blatantly political
 motivation, and the Soviet Un-
 ion's greater need for Western
 industrial products are seri-
 ous limitations to such growth.
 The Aid Program
 The bloc's foreign aid
 program,   which  originally
 Moscow has extended 75 per-
 cent of the $3.9 billion in aid
 provided thus far by the bloc
 and in 1959 and early 1960 ac-
 counted for 90 percent of bloc
 aid. The role of the European
 satellites, however, has not
 diminished. The USSR frequently
 turns to Eastern Europe to com-

 bloc.
 About one third of all
 credits extended under the bloc
 aid program have been utilized.
 Most of the $780,000,000 in mil-
 itary aid agreements has been
 implemented, and economic as-
 siStancw deliveries amount to
 about $550,000,000.  Construc-
 tion of India's Bhilai steel
 mill and a variety of projects
 and other economic assistance
 in Yugoslavia and Afghanistan
 account for most of the economic
 aid thus far delivered.  The
 relatively slow pace with which
 bloc economic credits have been
 utilized has resulted from a
 lack of domestic funds to meet
 local costs of construction,
 poor planning by local officials,
 and in some cases the unavail-
 ability on short notice of par-
 ticular bloc goods.
 The operation of the pro-
 gram has gone far toward elim-
 inating the optimism initially
 engendered in recipient countries
 by bloc aid agreements.  The UAR,
 which recently accepted more
 Soviet aid and is renegotiating
 the Soviet-Syrian agreement, at
 the same time is critical of
 some lags in Soviet deliveries
 and the unsuitability of certain
 equipment provided.  The eco-
 nomic stagnation in Iraq has
 led Baghdad to seek new Western
 assistance and to cast asper-
 sions on the Soviet program by
 dismissing the pro-Communist
 economic planning chief who ne-
 gotiated the aid agreement with
 Moscow.   Iraq, like other under-
 developed countries, mistakenly
 expected Soviet aid to have a
 more immediate economic impact
 but is expected to continue to
 seek such assistance.
 The early psychological
 impact--favorable both to Mos-
 cow and recipient governments--
 has been out of proportion to
 the size of the aid and is grad-
 ually being reduced as aid recip-
 ients find the bloc suppliers as
 realistic and  hardheaded as

 their Western counterparts.
 Nevertheless, bloc assistance
 is still welcome, and many of-
 ficials of underdeveloped coun-
 tries which need more aid than
 can be obtained from Western
 sources continue to see advan-
 tages of doing business with
 the bloc.  They cite the low
 interest charges, the provi-
 sions for repayment in surplus
 commodities rather than cash,
 and the ease of negotiating
 credit agreements.
 The superiority of the
 bloc program in some respects,
 however,  is largely ephemeral.
 While bloc interest rates are
 usually well below those pre-
 vailing in the West, the larg-
 est part of Western aid to un-
 derdeveloped countries has been
 in the form of outright grants.
 Less than 5 percent of bloc aid
 has been in this form. The bloc,
 on the other hand, has real ad-
 vantages in its lack of a his-
 tory of colonialism and in its
 willingness to accept goods
 rather than foreign exchange
 in repayment.
 The bloc also profits by
 its ability to seize an exploit-
 able situation, offer aid imme-
 diately, construct a few proj-
 ects with favorable propaganda
 impact, and conclude a simple
 document regulating the credit
 extended.   Bloc flexibility
 frequently does not extend be-
 yond this point.   Because of
 the planned nature of bloc econ-
 omies, contracts once concluded
 are rigid, and subsequent al-
 teration of projects is virtual-
 ly impossible.
 The bloc program will,
 however, continue to be accept-
 able in the underdeveloped
 countries, and bloc countries'
 fulfillment of their credit
 agreements--which for the most
 part has been satisfactory--
 probably will make underdevel-
 oped countries increasingly
 willing to seek aid from them.
 The bloc, chiefly the USSR, will
 be able to continue this pro-
 gram at least at the 1958-59
 level of about $1 billion an-
 nually, and an expansion of this
 rate is possible.  Repayments of
 existing credits, which will
 reach a peak in the mid-1960s,
 presumably will enable the bloc
 to expand the program without
 further increase in the burden
 of foreign aid.  These repay-
 ments will tend to sustain trade
 with the underdeveloped areas.
 Technical Aid and Training
 About 5,040 bloc economic
 technicians are helping to fill
 the need for qualified technical
 personnel in the underdeveloped
 countries.`  Nearly half the spe-
 cialists are engaged in planning
 and supervising construction
 projects, and the remainder are
 employed in geological surveys
 and prospecting or are construc-
 tion personnel working on public
 utilities.
 For the most part, bloc
 technicians enjoy a good reputa-
 tion in the underdeveloped coun-
 tries.  They have refrained from
 political activities.  The most
 frequent complaint seems to be
 that they keep too much to them-
 selves.  This stems in part from
 the language barrier.
 Neither the USSR nor the
 host countries publicize  the
 presence of the 1,500 bloc mil-
 itary specialists abroad--more
 than half of whom are located
 in the UAR.  They are engaged in
 training and equipment mainte-
 nance and, at least in Afghan-
 istan, perform some staff func-
 tions as well.  Few complaints
 have been registered about the
 qualifications of bloc military
 specialists.
 Less successful is the
 training and advanced education
 within the bloc for workers and
 students from the underdeveloped
 countries.   Innate distrust of
 Communism and fear that their
 citizens may be-subverted have
 made governments reluctant to
 foster this program.   Since 1955,
 3,500 military personnel--about
 half from the UAR--and nearly
 2,000 technical trainees--about
 half of them Indian steelworkers
 --have received instruction in
 the bloc; just over 1,800 students

 ucts has established trade ties
 with the underdeveloped coun-
 tries.  While these exchanges
 are expected to increase, they
 are not likely to establish the
 bloc as a major influence in
 international commerce in the
 near future.   Despite the ex-
 pansion of its trade in the
 past few years, the USSR is
 still only a minor force in
 world trade; most of its trade
 is still with other Communist
 states.   Furthermore, two
 thirds of the USSR's free world
 trade is with industrial coun-
 tries whose economic and polit-
 ical affiliations are relative-
 ly well established.
 On occasion, trade in cer-
 tain commodities such as tin,
 oil, rubber, and sugar--despite
 statistical insignificance--has
 had important effects in free
 world markets.  Moreover, bloc
 trade in a few cases now ac-
 counts for an important share
 of the total trade of some non-
 bloc countries.  The UAR, Af-
 ghanistan,  Iceland, Yugoslavia,
 Turkey, Finland, Uruguay, Aus-
 tria and Guinea carry on from
 10 to 33 percent of their trade
 eral trade. Trade
 presumably will con-
 tinue to expand, but
 except in special
 cases and for limited
 periods of time it is
 expected to remain rel-
 atively insignificant.
 Bilateral trade
 now is more frequently resisted
 by underdeveloped countries,
 where the practice has only tem-
 porarily corrected trade prob-
 lems resulting from surpluses.

 More recently, Indonesia
 has refused to commit itself to
 barter agreements involving rub-
 ber,  Argentina,  Indonesia, and
 Burma are terminating bilateral
 trade agreements with bloc coun-
 tries.  The Sudan is not inter-
 ested in maintaining last year's
 level of cotton exports in ex-
 change for Soviet goods.   Some
 underdeveloped countries also
 have found themselves in a
 creditor position as they ship
 surplus agricultural commod-
 ities and learn that desired
 imports are not available in
 the bloc.
 The growth of multilateral
 trade involving the bloc is not
 likely.   Such trade would loosen
 bloc control over its imports
 and exports, which are regulat-
 ed to fulfill planned commit-
 ments primarily within the bloc.
 Moreover, the underdeveloped
 countries probably would look
 to the bloc more as a market
 than as a source of goods--the
 result of which would be to
 drain off bloc holdings of for-
 eign exchange for raw materials
 and agricultural products at a
 time when the bloc needs such
 financing for the large imports
 of advanced free world machinery
 it seeks.
 On the other hand, there
 is a more natural relationship
 in Soviet trade with the indus-
 trialized countries.  As Mos-
 cow frequently states, the im-
 portant economic aspect of its
 trade drive now is to procure
 Western equipment and technol-
 ogy to improve its productive
 capability, particularly in
 the chemical field.   Soviet de-
 mand for such imports--which
 was beginning to assume major
 proportions in late 1959--is so
 great that it has spurred ex-
 ports to earn foreign exchange
 to support these purchases.
 For the past two years Mos-
 cow has actively sought credits
 from Western suppliers to fi-
 nance such imports.   Governments
 of free world industrial coun-
 tries already have indicated
 that a minimum of $250,000,000
 is available as a guarantee for
 equipment delivered on credit
 to the USSR alone.  Recent crit-
 icism by members of the Soviet
 Academy of Sciences about the
 lack of progress in the petro-
 chemical industries suggests
 that Moscow will continue its
 efforts to exploit advanced West-
 ern technology through imports.
 The satellites' success in
 establishing fairly promising
 trade ties in the underdeveloped
 countries results largely from
 the valid economic basis for
 such trade, as opposed to the
 USSR's attempts, which often
 appear contrived--even to the
 underdeveloped countries in-
 volved.
 Czechoslovakia and Poland
 are seeking to expand markets
 for growing industrial output aswell
 as  sources of raw materials and
 agricultural products.  The same
 is frequently true of East Ger-
 many, although in its search for
 diplomatic recognition East Ger-
 many has participated more in
 propagandistic activity than
 other satellites. The satellites
 continue to account for 50 per-
 cent of the Sino-Soviet bloc's
 trade with the underdeveloped
 countries.                  Pre-        25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14 April 1960
 ARAB POLITICS AND A PALESTINE "ENTITY"
 Although the Arab states
 usually speak in unison about
 the "crimes" of Israel and its
 "creators"--the Western powers--
 they are frequently in discord
 on other facets of the Palestine
 problem.  More than a million
 Palestinian Arab refugees from
 what is now Israel are pawns
 in their disputes.
 Some 604,000 of them still
 reside.. in Jordan : in what was
 formerly Palestinian territory
 on the West Bank of the Jordan
 River; 252,000 are in the Gaza
 strip, the other remaining Arab
 portion of Palestine; 113,000
 live in the Syrian region of the
 UAR; and 135,000 are in Lebanon.
 With the exception of Jordan,
 their host states generally
 refuse to absorb the refugees,
 ostensibly fearing that the
 Palestinians' claims against
 Israel might be prejudiced,
 but also to keep the Palestine
 issue before the eyes of the
 world.   The UN, through its
 Relief and Works Agency for
 Palestine Refugees (UNRWA),
 supports the refugees.
 Leadership of the Pales-
 tinians' cause--restoration of
 Arab "rights" to live and re-
 gain property in Palestine--
 now is contested by UAR Pres-
 ident Nasir,  Iraqi Premier
 Qasim, and Jordan's King Hu-
 sayn.  This rivalry has re-
 cently focused on the question
 of a Palestine "entity" or
 state which in theory would
 embrace the remaining Arab ter-
 ritories of Palestine and
 unite all Palestinian Arabs
 for an all-out campaign against
 Israel.  These proposals are
 important as propaganda  for
 Qasim and Nasir, but for Jordan,
 which opposes them, they threat-
 en the very existence of the
 state.  Jordan includes more
 than 2,200 square miles of for-
 mer Palestinian territory, and
 two thirds of its population
 is Palestinian.
 On 3 April, the Arab League
 political affairs committee
 failed to agree--as had the Arab
 League Council a few weeks ear-
 lier--on the UAR's proposals to
 create a Palestinian "national
 entity" and army.   Further dis-
 cussion of the problem was de-
 ferred until a special session
 of the Arab League Council at
 the foreign ministers' level
 scheduled for 30 April.
 The deadlock involved only
 the UAR and Jordan, inasmuch as
 Iraq boycotted both the council
 .and the political affairs com-
 mittee meetings because they
 were held in Cairo.  The Iraqis
 have said they will not attend
 the foreign ministers' meeting
 either, unless it takes place
 outside the UAR.   Whether Iraq
 attends will probably have lit-
 tle effect on the already dubi-
 ous prospects for a settlement
 of the dispute.
 . 1947 Partition ,
 Although the partition of
 Palestine in 1947 by the United
 Nations was intended to facil-
 itate the formation of a new
 Arab state, as well as a Jewish
 homeland, King Husayn's grand-
 father, King Abdullah, sought to
 incorporate the Arab sectors into
 his Kingdom of Transjordan. Egypt
 and Saudi Arabia refused to ac-
 quiesce in this and countered by
 proclaiming a phantom "Government
 of All-Palestine" under the no-
 torious Grand Mufti of Jerusalem,
 Hajj Amin al Husayni.
 Nevertheless, Abdullah pro-
 ceeded in 1950 to annex the so-
 called West Bank area of the
 Jordan River adjacent to his
 territory and to change the name
 of his kingdom to Jordan. Egypt
 occupied the "Gaza strip" por-
 tion of Arab Palestine adjoining
 its eastern frontier.  The Mufti's
 continued agitation on behalf of
 his "government" from outside
 Palestine has had little effect.

 Recent Developments
 The disagreement among the
 Arabs regarding Arab Palestine
 was more or less quiescent until
 1958, when the UAR, at an Arab
 League meeting in April, called
 for the formation of a "Pales-
 tine army."  On 16 May 1958,
 the Gaza Legislative Council
 adopted two resolutions: one
 called for the establishment of
 a Palestine Liberation Fund;
 the other proclaimed the estab-
 lishment of the Arab National
 Union with the objects of re-
 covering "usurped Palestine,"
 establishing "complete Arab
 unity," and organizing a demo-
 the West Bank and that Pales-
 tinians under its jurisdiction
 already have Jordanian citizen-
 ship and serve in Jordan's army.
 The league was unable to settle
 the differences.   Jordan's Prime
 Minister Majalli claims the
 league refused to discuss a Jor-
 danian plan for solution of the
 over-all Palestine problem.

 has been enriched by contribu-
 tions from Iraqi workers and
 industries, eventually will to-
 tal $5,600,000.  On 5 April he
 said the Palestinian situation
 had reached a stage requiring
 "violent action."
 These statements cost
 Qasim little, for Iraq is re-
 mote from Israel and only about
 5,000 Palestinian refugees live
 within its borders..  Such agi-
 tation is nevertheless trouble-
 some to the UAR and Jordan,
 which harbor many more refugees
 and have common frontiers with
 the Israelis.
 Nasir has responded vigor-
 ously to Qasim's attacks.  He re-
 introduced his Palestine pro-
 posals at the Arab League Coun-
 cil meeting on 8 February, de-
 spite the certainty of continued
 Jordanian opposition.   In Jan-
 uary 1960 he set up the Pales-
 tine National Union in Gaza and
 expanded it to Syria with the
 aim of expanding it into an or-
 ganization of all Palestinians.
 An army of Palestinians report-
 edly is also being organized in
 the UAR.   In speeches in Syria
 during the Israeli-Syrian bor-
 der crisis in February, Nasir
 challenged Qasim to demonstrate
 his sincerity by sending troops
 to the Israeli border and ac-
 cused Jordan of having withdrawn
 its troops from the Jordanian
 frontier near the scene of the
 clashes in order to avoid in-
 volvement in the fighting.
 Problem in Jordan
 Jordan has indicated it
 will not engage in any further
 discussion of the entity "inno-
 vation" at any level whatever.
 Husayn, reacting to the Nasir-
 Qasim maneuvers, has shown in-
 creased concern about the West
 Bank.  He has visited its cities
 more often than previously in
 an effort to generate support
 for his regime and has arranged
 to hold meetings of the Jor-
 danian assembly in Jerusalem.
 This violates, as does the pres-
 ence of the Israeli Government
 in Jerusalem, a UN resolution
 favoring internationalization
 of the city and its environs--
 the Holy Places.
 Husayn implicitly attacked
 Nasir and Qasim on 1.March for
 their statements about Palestine,
 arousing Nasir.in particular to
 renewed outbursts against the
 King.  Husayn announced on 13
 March that he would accept the
 results of a plebiscite among
 his Palestinian subjects on the
 question of whether or not they
 wish to become separated from
 Jordan.  He hopes this move will
 undercut the potentially subver-
 sive proposals of Nasir and Qa.-
 sim, whom he suspects of wanting
 to bring down his regime.
 Husayn has insisted the of-
 fer is not a mere propaganda
 gesture and claims he will ac-
 cept the result whatever it may
 be.    However, he has provided
 himself with a possible excuse
 for not fulfilling his offer by
 making a plebiscite conditional
 on the desires of Palestinians
 to have one.  The King could
 cite the numerous expressions
 of support he has received since
 the announcement as "evidence"
 that a vote is not wanted, al-
 though he has said he will ac-
 cept'; the determination of "neu-
 tral members" of the league--i.e.,
 Lebanon, Yemen, Libya,  Sudan,
 Tunisia, and Morocco--on the
 question.
 The relatively urban and.
 Westernized Palestinians of the
 West Bank are not amalgamating
 easily with the more isolated
 and conservative Jordanians of
 the East Bank.  Many of these
 Westernized Palestinians, bey
 lieve, as do some Western diplo-
 mats in Jordan, that the major-
 ity of voters in a plebiscite
 would opt for separation from
 the Amman government and for
 association with the UAR. Some
 Palestinian opponents of Husayn's
 regime are.even'?said to oppose

 either independence or asso-
 ciation with the UAR because
 the West Bank would be left ex-
 posed to possible occupation
 by Israel.  The Israelis, ex-
 tremely sensitive to;develop-
 ments in the West Bank, have
 indicated that UAR control there
 would "necessitate" its occupa-
 tion by Israel as a defensive
 measure,
 Neither a West Bank pleb-
 iscite nor the special session
 of the Arab League foreign min-
 isters scheduled for 30 April is
 likely to resolve the Palestine
 controversy. As long as Nasir,
 Qasim, and Husayn remain heads
 of their respective states, the
 dispute probably will endure as
 part of their rivalry for pan
 Arab leadership. Under these con-
 ditions, Arab?unity will remain
 a long-range dream, and divisive-
 ness will continue to weaken the
 effectiveness of Arab opposition
 to Israel.
 DE GAULLE'S VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES
 The timing of De Gaulle's
 acceptance of the long-standing
 invitation to visit the United
 States was probably determined
 by his desire to sharpen on the
 eve. of the summit conference
 the image of France as a great
 power,   In his talks in Wash-
 ington from 22 to 25 April, De
 Gaulle will probably seek to
 subordinate specifically French-
 American issues to a discussion
 of world problems and, as the
 most recent Western statesman
 to have held discussions with
 Khrushchev, to expound his pro-
 posals for dealing with the
 Soviet bloc.  He can be expected
 to continue to press for further
 implementation of Western tri-
 partite global discussions and
 for extension of NATO responsi-
 bilities to Africa, and to probe
 US attitudes on the development
 of independent European defense
 capabilities.

 because he was preoccupied with
 Algeria and with the domestic
 problems consequent to the over-
 throw of the Fourth Republic in
 May 1958.  He now:.~probably be-
 lieves that France's nuclear
 achievements, the popular sup-
 port he continues to command at
 home, and his success in induc-
 ing Khrushchev to visit France
 have sufficiently bolstered
 France's international position
 to give weight to French views,
 despite the stalemate on Ali
 geria.
 Personal Diplomacy
 On his visit to the United
 States, shortly after his talks
 with Khrushchev, De Gaulle will
 probably be anxious to compare
 notes and expound his estimate
 of the Soviet leader's inten-
 tions, and to suggest tactics
 for the summit meeting.
 The talks with Khrushchev
 have apparently not altered De
 Gaulle's opinion that the So-
 viet Union is motivated primari-
 ly by nationalist drives or that
 Communism is a passing phe-
 nomenon.   He has believed for
 some time that the Soviet Union
 is under domestic pressures for
 higher living standards, and
 that the external pressures from
 an aggressively expanding China
 will eventually oblige Moscow
 to cooperate with the West.
 Khrushchev probably sought to
 encourage De Gaulle in the view
 that cooperation between "white
 men" is the only reasonable
 eventuality.
 De Gaulle has long insisted
 on a firm Western position to-
 ward the USSR on immediate prob-
 lems.  His hope for a long-range
 East-West reconciliation may
 have led him, however, to read
 into Khrushchev's noncommittal
 reaction some positive endorse-
 ment of French proposals for
 easing East-West tensions: a
 joint East-West economic aid
 program to less-developed coun-
 tries, a noninterference agree-
 ment, and an agreement to control
 arms shipments to neutral areas.
 In addition to such summit
 topics as disarmament, Germany,
 and East-West relations--on
 which French and American views
 are in general agreement--De
 Gaulle in Washington will prob-
 ably want particularly to dis-
 cuss Africa and Communist China,
 which he regards as especially
 troublesome world problems. He
 apparently believes the Peiping
 regime is the greatest danger
 to world peace, and he feels
 some means must be found to
 curb the Chinese.  He rejected,
 however, Prime Minister Macmil-
 lan's recent suggestion that
 Peiping be admitted to the UN.
 De Gaulle apparently hopes that
 Moscow-Peiping differences can
 be exploited to the advantage of
 the West, and he may spell out
 some suggestions as a result of
 his attempts to raise the China
 problem with Khrushchev.
 De Gaulle is particularly
 concerned over increased Chinese
 Communist interest in Africa.
 He believes that retention of a
 dominant Western influence in
 Africa is necessary for the sur-
 vival of Europe.  This is why he
 insists that joint aid, nonin-
 terference, and an arms sales
 ban be discussed at the summit
 level.  He may press for tripar-
 tite action to counter Communist
 expansion by extending Western
 defense responsibilities in Afri-
 ca, perhaps combined with a tri-
 partite economic aid program.,
 Differences With US
 De Gaulle certainly has
 little hope of obtaining US sup-
 port for the retention of French
 bases in Morocco and Tunisia,
 but he can nevertheless be ex-
 pected to continue to seek some

 way to reduce pressures for
 France's withdrawal 'from. Africa
 and some means of indicating
 US support for French policies
 there,  He will want a formal
 US endorsement of his Algerian
 policy in the official communi-
 que ending his visit here. The
 absence of a reference to Al-
 geria in the communique follow-
 ing the Khrushchev visit may
 have been due to De Gaulle's
 unwillingness to restate his
 acceptance of the Oder-Neisse
 line as Germany's eastern bor-
 der, or because Khrushchev had
 again endorsed "self-determina-
 tion" publicly.
 Partly to maintain the
 "global" atmosphere of his
 Washington talks and partly be-
 cause of the imminence of Amer-
 ican presidential elections,
 De Gaulle will probably not
 make an issue of any of the
 questions which have disturbed
 US-French relations in the past
 two years. His dislike of sub-
 merging national identities in
 an integrated NATO, his opposi-
 tion to foreign control of nu-
 clear weapons based on French
 soil, his reasons for withdraw-
 ing the Mediterranean fleet from
 NATO control, and his unhappi-
 ness with US policies in North
 Africa are all unchanged. More-
 over, his primary aim continues
 to be to win for France equal-
 ity with its "Anglo-Saxon" al
 lies in Western councils, in-
 cluding a voice in any Western
 decision to use the nuclear
 bomb.
 A French-led Europe
 While De Gaulle is unlikely
 to make any direct request for
 US aid to the French nuclear
 weapons program, he may ask
 clarification of President Ei-
 senhower's statement of 3 Feb-
 ruary on the possibility the
 United States might make avail--
 able to its allies atomic in-
 formation already known to the
 Soviet Union.  De Gaulle is de-
 termined to establish a French
 nuclear striking force armed
 with sophisticated weapons and
 a modern delivery system.  He
 has also shown increasing in-
 terest in the development of a
 European defense capability to
 provide military backing for the
 Continental European bloc he
 hopes to establish.
 De Gaulle's basic aim is
 to "free" Europe from its pres-
 ent dependence on US- and Brit-
 ish-controlled nuclear weapons,
 and to make a French-led Europe
 strong enough to play a leading
 role in East-West relations. He
 is also anxious that Europe be
 prepared for the day when the
 United States might decide to
 withdraw its forces from the
 Continent.
 De Gaulle's public state-
 ments have from time to time
 reflected the fear expressed
 in some European circles that
 the United States and Britain
 would be reluctant to use their
 nuclear weapons to defend Eu-
 rope for fear of provoking So-
 viet retaliation.  He has re-
 peated. as recently as February
 that France must provide for its
 own defense "without relying on
 others." In a November press con-
 ference, he justified France's
 development of a nuclear capabil-
 ity, indicating he did not ex-
 pect the "sort of equilibrium"
 which exists between the United
 States and the USSR to remain
 static.  He warned that the ad-
 vantage of "sudden advances" in
 the capabilities of either side
 might be so great as to overcome
 peaceful inclinations.
 "Who can say," De Gaulle
 stated,  "whether in the future
 the two powers having the nuclear
 monopoly will not agree to di-
 vide the world.... Who can say
 ...whether on some awful day
 Western Europe should be wiped
 out from Moscow and Central Eu-
 rope from Washington." "France,"
 the French President said,  "in
 equipping herself with a nuclear
 weapon, will render a service to
 world equilibrium."

 technological interest is as
 thick as ever.
 Closed Areas
 The complex set of prohi-
 bitions which governs the trav-
 el of foreigners in the USSR
 was amended in June 1953, Au-
 gust 1957, and August 1959. On
 balance, the effect has been
 to open up some areas, in the
 Baltic states and the Western
 territories seized in 1939-41,
 for example, which had previous-
 ly been denied because of po-
 litical or economic instability,
 while adding to the prohibited
 list a number of areas of in-
 telligence interest from  the
 military or technological point
 of view.   Also denied are  the
 Soviet Far North, the bulk of
 the Far Eastern provinces,  the
 northern and eastern shores of
 the Caspian Sea, and parts   of
 Central Asia, which have been
 formally forbidden to foreign-
 ers all along.
 There are, in addition,
 the devices of "temporary" and
 de f acto..'c iosures .   Many of
 those parts of Central Asia
 normally open are "temporarily"
 closed each year during spring
 maneuvers.   Other areas offi-
 cially accessible are,  in fact,
 denied on various pretexts.
 Numerous requests by Western
 representatives to visit Vorkuta,
 the former slave-labor center
 above the Arctic circle, were
 denied,,although it has been
 formally prohibited only since
 August 1959.
 In other cases, approved
 travel is subjected to indirect
 restrictions along the route.
 Misroutings or delays are used
 to ensure that the observer
 will pass through an area of
 interest at night.
 Surveillance, provocations,
 and staged incidents have long
 been familiar to Western diplo-
 mats and military attaches   in
 the Soviet Union.   With the ex-
 pansion of East-West exchanges,
 the various forms of surveil-
 lance and harassment have been
 extended to cover exchange stu-
 dents, delegations, and ordinary
 tourists.   Such activities di-
 rected against tourists have ap-
 parently increased.
 Printed matter was care-
 fully inspected by customs  of-
 ficials at entry points in 1959,
 although in previous years lit-
 tle concern had been shown. In
 some cases,  books were confis-
 cated at the"border and never
 returned to their owners. Fur-
 thermore,  last year for  the
 first time there were instances
 in which men's wallets and
 women's purses were inspected
 and pockets turned inside out.
 Customs inspections at exit
 points also became increasingly
 severe.
 Searches were more frequent.
 In a number of instances snaps
 and locks were simply broken.
 Personal items such as cameras
 and diaries frequently disappeared
 from their owner's rooms for days.
 In other cases, tape recorders,
 cameras, and unexposed film were
 obviously tampered with and some-
 times put out of commission.  Noc-
 turnal telephone calls as a check
 or reminder of surveillance,tele-
 phone taps, and concealed micro-
 phones were encountered with in-
 creased frequency.
 In 1959, American tourists
 and businessmen resident in the
 USSR long enough to receive for-
 eign mail noticed that their let-
 ters were being opened.  In  many
 cases there was little or no at-

 stations, airfields, bridges,
 government buildings,  indus-
 trial enterprises,                       and the
 like.   On the whole,Americans
 have abided carefully by  the
 regulations, but in 1959 a
 number of Americans were de-
 tained or arrested for "mis-
 using" their cameras.   Some
 made the mistake of photograph-
 ing unflattering scenes, but
 others had photographed ob-
 jects of natural interest to
 tourists whihh,  unknown to
 them,  included areas considered
 by the USSR to have military
 or economic intelligence in-
 terest.                                        `
 Since Stalin's death, and
 particularly since 1958,  the
 Soviet regime has lost some of
 its inhibitions against  the
 release of economic data. Sta
 tistics on the production  of
 some items, on trade of some
 articles, and some planning
 data have replaced the former
 releases, which consisted  of
 announcements of a series  of
 percentage changes on A', base
 year for which data were con-
 cealed.   Still protected,how-
 ever, is a very wide range of
 production data on the output
 of individual plants, armament
 and military-related products,
 and other state secrets  such
 as practically all data re-
 lating to the output of pre-
 cious or base nonferrous
 metals.
 Limitation of Contacts
 Contacts between foreign-
 ers and Russians have expanded
 markedly in recent years as  a
 result of both the increase in
 East-West exchanges and a great-
 er sense of personal security
 on the part of Soviet citizens.
 There remains, however, a con-
 siderable barrier to free,
 spontaneous contacts.   Western
 officials must continue to
 reckon with more or less per-
 manent surveillance, while of-
 ficial delegations and tourists
 are almost constantly under the
 watchful eye of official guides,
 who operate under instructions
 from security officials.
 Disclosure or public dis-
 cussion of security--related
 topics in recent years has
 given the appearance of some
 relaxation, but, with hardly
 any exceptions, a self-serving
 aim is always evident.   For
 example,'Chrushchev's disclosure
 in January of the size of his
 armed forces, although unprec-
 edented,. was intended to
 strengthen his hand in disarma-
 ment negotiations.   On vital
 points the'. ' Soviet '. sense of
 security remains extremely
 strict.   The USSR consistently
 denies access to information
 and facilities when it feels
 that such access would weaken
 military security, and that de-
 tails on similar activity in
 the West will routinely become
 available in open sources. and
 not'-.require a quid pro quo trade.
 Guided Missiles
 Statements by high Soviet
 officials, designed to under-
 score Moscow's self-confidence
 and to buttress its interna-
 tional prestige, have occasional-
 ly thrown some light on the gen-
 eral development of the USSR's
 guided missile program, but have
 not revealed details.
 Travel restrictions may
 be a barometer of sensitivity:
 five cities added to the denied
 list last August--Vorkuta,Gorky,
 Kazan, Kuybyshev, and Dneprope_
 trovsk--may be involved in some
 aspect of the guided missile
 program.   Soviet aircraft de-
 signer Tupolev was given a tour

 of Thor missile production fa-
 cilities during'a visit to the
 US, and Mikoyan was offered  a
 trip to Vandenberg AFB.  However,
 a request by the  Nixon party
 for a visit to a Soviet missile
 production facility was  never
 answered.
 Airdraft 'Industry, Shipbuilding
 Aircraft factories are in
 many   instances   situated   in
 closed areas.   Where  this is
 not the case,Western travelers
 approaching areas known to con-
 tain aircraft plants are fre-
 quently turned back by security
 police  or  the military. The
 Russians have gone so far  as
 to put a smoke screen  around
 a factory airfield when it was
 known that the US air attached
 would be passing the field by
 train. General Twining's group
 in 1956 visited. Airframe Plant
 20 and Aircraft Engine  Plant
 45, both in Moscow, but neither
 of the plants was doing work of
 military interest at the time.
 With these exceptions,  aircraft
 factories have been  strictly
 out of bounds to Westerners.
 Some foreigners, includ-
 ing a few Amerieans,have been
 allowed to visit certain Soviet
 shipyards producing  merchant
 vessels.   However, shipyards
 producing or suspected  of pro-
 ducing naval vessels such                    as
 submarines and destroyers are
 generally located in closed
 cities, or,  as in the case of
 Leningrad, access is prevented
 by the denial.bf travel re-
 quests or by on-the-spot ac-
 tion by servicemen, police, or
 ordinary citizens to prevent
 observation and photographing.
 The USSR has not agreed to an
 exchange of shipbuilding spe-
 cialists. Only after strenuous
 protests was Admiral Rickover
 allowed to make anything  but
 the most superficial tour  of
 the nuclear-powered icebreaker
 Lenin.
 Military Secrecy
 Secrecy concerning  all
 phases of the development and
 production of new weapons is
 extremely heavy until there
 is a public showing of the new
 weapons or an announcement that
 such weapons exist.  These dis-
 closures are always tied to
 the current propaganda line
 in order to?_emphasize that the
 USSR has the strength to back
 its policies.   The USSR never
 publishes information on the
 size of its military stock-
 piles,  nor does it ever invite
 Western?attachds to unit exer-
 cises or publish the specifics
 of significant tactical or
 strategic doctrines.
 Vigilance Stressed
 There is thus no sign of
 a reduction of Moscow's far-
 flung internal  security sys-
 tem. With the sharply increased
 influx of foreign visitors,
 the accent may fall on more,
 rather than less, internal se-
 curity.
 The State Secrets Act issued
 in 1956 is, like the ' 1947 statute it
 replaced, a lengthy compendium prohi-
 biting divulgence of many kinds of
 information regarded elsewhere a
 public property. A rigid cen-
 sorship of domestic publica-
 tions and of outgoing press
 dispatches  continues J
 A resurgence of "security
 consciousness"  was also evi-
 dent in the extensive "vigi-
 lance" campaign in                                                               the press
 in  the latter  half  of
 1958--a campaign  which stressed
 the  dangers  of  carelessness
 and complacency arising  from
 "peaceful coexistence"  and
 warned against  the depreda-
 tions of US  intelligence,
 which is said to employ "tens
 of  thousands  of  people who
 bend  all   efforts   to in-
 flict                                                              damage  in the
 tries  Of socialism."
