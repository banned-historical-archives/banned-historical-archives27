 Dissent in Chiral                                          25X1
 Key Judgments   The Chinese Communist Party has again cracked down on dissent by
 rounding up prominent dissidents, suppressing underground journals, and
 placing restrictions on free expression in party and nonparty forums. Senior
 Chinese leaders like Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping and newly appointed
 Chairman Hu Yaobang view dissent as a potentially serious threat to
 internal stability. They are preoccupied with China's complex economic
 difficulties and fear that dissidents will be able to capitalize on popular dis-
 content with the party's new economic strategy, especially unemployment,
 inflation, and the economic program's effect on vested interests.
 In drawing the line on dissent, Deng has responded to the interests of party
 conservatives in order to gain their backing for his political succession
 plans. Deng, however, has tried to avoid alienating party liberals and
 intellectuals-who make up one of his key constituencies-in the process of
 defining stricter limits on the dissidents. The party's crackdown will not lay
 the issue of dissent to rest. Rather, it is likely to:
 ? Further strain relations between the party and the Army, and between
 leftists and liberals in the party and the bureaucracy. It may embolden
 leftists to make use of cultural issues to attack reform policies.
 ? Cause the party to place greater restrictions on a variety of cultural and
 personal contacts with the West.
 ? Lessen the enthusiasm of intellectuals for the party's modernization
 program and reduce the likelihood that the party will overcome the
 "crisis of confidence" in its mission and objectives.
 ? Lead to additional controversy, particularly within the Ministry of
 Culture and intellectual circles, over the limits the party has placed on
 freedom of expression.
 Despite the party's concern, the level of dissent today is relatively low and
 primarily nonviolent. Moreover, party leaders do not precisely define
 dissidence. From their perspective, dissidents include not only outspoken
 advocates of the "democratic movement" who have organized networks
 across China and who generally work from outside the system to seek
 change within it, but militant workers, university activists, and artists,
 writers, and filmmakers who ask fundamental questions about the regime's
 right to rule and the efficacy of the socialist system. Indeed, dissidents
 themselves do not present a single, coherent program of opposition to the
 party, but articulate the dissatisfaction, frustrations, and grievances of the
 populace with the regime.

 The current restrictions on dissent are unlikely to loosen dramatically in
 the near future. "The Resolution on Certain Historical Questions" passed
 by the Sixth Plenum of the party Central Committee in June clearly stated
 the party's determination to prevent another blossoming of dissident
 activity. Even if the party can maintain such control, dissidence-which
 the party cannot extinguish completely without undermining the modern-
 ization program-will remain aloes-level irritant for the regime.

 Introduction
 The Chinese leadership is again cracking down on
 internal dissent following the spread of strikes, dem-
 onstrations, and sporadic acts of violence late last
 year. Senior party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping,
 view dissent as both dangerous and along-term threat
 to stability. The arrests of prominent dissidents, the
 suppression of underground journals, and the renewed
 restrictions on the arts all reflect the fear that dissi-
 dent organizations unchecked will bring a growing
 and more radical criticism of the regime
 The tighter control over dissent comes at a time when
 China's leaders are deeply concerned with maintain-
 ing social order as they implement a new economic
 strategy that may increase unemployment and threat-
 en vested interests. Deng, who initially encouraged
 and manipulated dissent to serve his own political
 goals, now seeks to draw the line on unacceptable
 political behavior. Deng has been under pressure from
 opponents and some members of his own camp to deal
 harshly with dissent outside the party, and he is
 clearly willing to toughen his approach at the expense
 of more liberal elements in his own reformist constitu-
 ency to prevent hardliners from upsetting his political
 succession plans.
 The suppression of dissent has already widened the
 gap between reformers and leftists in the party. It has
 stirred up divisions over policy toward culture and
 intellectuals in the party's senior ranks and has
 enabled leftists to make use of cultural issues to
 attack Deng's reform policy. Paradoxically, it has also
 strengthened the resolve of liberal academics and of
 dissidents to air their grievances.
 Dissidents have stirred official fears that Western
 "bourgeois" ideas will erode popular support for
 Marxism-Leninism by praising aspects of Western
 democracy, economics, and culture. They articulate
 widely held grievances and will continue to irritate the
 regime with their critiques in the future. In the long
 run, dissidents have the potential to galvanize popular
 discontent against the regime in the event of a crisis.
 More immediately, however, they point to the party's
 inability to build support fo; its mission and ideology
 among the young and the intellectuals.
 Who Dissents and Why
 Chinese leaders regard dissent as any activity that
 opposes the policies of the Central Committee. In this
 context, dissent encompasses activities that range
 from the expression of political opinions at odds with
 current policy to overtly criminal behavior. As such,
 any definition of dissent must be somewhat arbitrary.
 In his speech to the party work conference last
 December, for example, Deng Xiaoping,excoriated all
 those whose actions threatened "the stability and
 unity of the political situation"-lumping together
 political radicals, rioting "down-to-the-countryside"
 settlers, and rapists, prostitutes, arsonists, and smug-
 glers.
 Dissidents have been a persistent irritant to the
 regime since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central
 Committee in 1978, when the party endorsed the
 slogan "emancipate the mind" and in effect broke the
 Maoist ideological mold. Dissidence reached its
 height in the "Beijing spring" of 1979 when young
 "democrats" used wall posters to air their views on
 the "democracy walls" of Beijing and other cities, and
 published dissenting essays, poetry, fiction, literary
 criticism, and woodcuts in spontaneous journals. An
 outbreak of public disorder that spring forced Deng
 and party reformers to accede to pressure from both
 conservatives and leftists and to crack down on as-
 saults on the party's legitimacy. More than 40 dissi-
 dents were arrested in Beijing; Wei Jingsheng, Fu
 Yuehua, and other prominent "democratic figures"
 were tried and imprisoned later in the year. As a
 consequence, the level of dissidence dropped sharply
 and many activists went underground.

 Although dissent currently remains at a relatively low
 level, it embraces a broader spectrum of activity than
 in 1979, ranging from localized flurries of wall poster
 writing to small-scale, violent demonstrations and
 underground networks. Dissidents today include both
 the outspoken advocates of the original "democratic"
 or "human rights" movement of 1979 and militant
 workers and university activists. Allied with them
 across the nation are writers, artists, and filmmakers
 who, like many party cadres, ask fundamental ques-
 tions about the system.
 Dissidents do not present a single, coherent program
 of opposition to the party but rather express a variety
 of views that articulate the dissatisfaction, frustra-
 tions, and grievances of the populace with the regime.
 Most dissidents support socialism, at least in the
 abstract, and primarily urge the reform of the party
 and society. Overall, they appear to back Deng
 Xiaoping, but believe that there must be steady
 pressure from the outside to prevent Deng and the
 reform program from succumbing to Maoist counter-
 currents and bureaucratic inertia.

 Some general themes are common to most dissidents:

 government.
 ? Party domination of intellectual life and violation of
 constitutional guarantees. Dissidents advocate ex-

 to publish opinions at variance with orthodox party
 views, and an end to party interference in the arts
 and sciences. Dissidents also attempt to hold the
 party to the constitutional guarantees of freedom of
 speech and assembly, and of rule by law.

 Focal Points of Dissent
 The "democratic movement, "which probably num-
 bers several thousand activists across China, is the
 most intractable and troublesome dissident element
 and, as such, is the primary target of periodic crack-
 downs. The party, mindful of its own origins, is wary
 of challenges from small, organized groups, as well as
 apprehensive about the influence that dissidents can
 exert over young intellectuals throughout the country.
 The "democratic movement" comprises articulate,
 well-educated veterans of the Cultural Revolution era
 (Their leaders are
 men like Wang Xizhe and Xu Wenli, two well-known
 polemicists who were arrested in the crackdown last
 spring. Wang first came to national attention in 1973
 as one of the Li Yizhe group-writers of a widely
 circulated wall poster, put up in Canton, that criti-
 cized in highly emotional terms the excesses of the
 Cultural Revolution. Xu and Wang were "heroes" of
 the spontaneous mass demonstrations on 5 April 1976
 in Tiananmen Square and later set the pace for the
 protests of the "Beijing spring" in 1979. Some high

 Zhang Zhixin, a dissident

 Yuanzin, has become a cause
 celebre among youn
 democrats in China
 party officials, who believe that they represent the
 views of many educated youth, have given them tacit
 support, and they have published their views in Hong
 Kong leftist publications.
 Militant workers, some of whom are political radi-
 cals, have sporadically challenged party hegemony in
 the factory and may have organized some of the
 strikes that hit the country last fall. Party officials-
 sensitive to the parallels with the Polish situation-
 have tried hard to preverit alliances between radical
 intellectuals and young workers, especially where
 labor unrest has occurred. In the northern city of
 Taiyuan last October-the scene of shutdowns and
 labor agitation~issident journals ridiculed the offi-
 cial notion that workers are the "masters" of China
 and denounced the Communist party's suppression
 and exploitation of the working class. Some publica-
 tions were discovered by police in factories that went
 on strike.
 The "down-to-the-countryside"settlers-people sent
 to rural areas under party policy established in the
 early 1960s-were at the forefront of the first out-
 burst of dissident activity in 1979. They have contin-
 ued to agitate for an improvement in their living
 conditions and for return to their home cities. Last
 December, for example, 60,000 to 70,000 settlers
 staged mass demonstrations in Xinjiang to protest the
 regime's failure to improve their conditions and to
 demand the right to return to Shanghai. A stall in
 negotiations led to rioting, the occupation of the local
 party headquarters, clashes with officials, and a
 standoff with troops called in to quell the disturb-
 ances.
 News of the rioting in Xinjiang sparked sympathetic
 demonstrations in Shanghai, where an estimated
 10,000 people gathered to listen to returned settlers
 describe their plight. The authorities in Shanghai and
 other eastern cities have been unable to send back
 illegal returnees, who may number some 20,000 and
 remain a persistent source of anxiety for local offi-
 cials.

 Some of the protesting settlers have links to the
 "democratic movement" and have published unoffi-
 cial journals critical of the regime. Because of the
 depth of their discontent, and because large numbers
 of such settlers are concentrated in the strategically
 important region of Xinjiang near the Soviet border,
 their actions have provoked great concern among the
 leadership about maintaining order. Beijing wants to
 prevent settlers from returning because this would
 exacerbate the existing problem of urban unemploy-
 ment
 Criticism of the party is a strong undercurrent on
 university campuses. Last fall the elections of dele-
 gates to Local Peoples' Congresses gave dissidents the
 opportunity to galvanize China's largely apathetic
 campuses. Widespread demonstrations occurred that
 focused on various issues-including party control of
 academic life and cadre abuses.
 At Beijing University, for example, the elections
 embroiled the campus in turmoil for two months.
 They sparked rallies, student journals, discussion
 groups, and big character posters in which students
 aired their views on current political issues, including
 the history of the party, the assessment of Mao
 Zedong, the meaning of democracy, and the critique
 of "bureaucratism." Candidates at Beijing University
 and other campuses who described themselves as
 "anti-Marxist" ran and won election as deputies.
 Criticism of the party and of Mao was vigorous, and
 party attempts to refute student views in debates were
 largely unsuccessful. The recent crackdown has bot-
 tled up expression of dissent for the time being, but
 the prevailing campus critique of the party and its
 general acceptance by students pose a potentially
 serious morale problem in the long rung
 The arts-particularly fiction and films-have pro-
 duced the most trenchant criticism of the party. The
 persuasive power of the written word-traditionally
 esteemed in China-and the recent Chinese fascina-
 tion with films provide dissident writers with a large
 and receptive audience. In the last few years, they
 have articulated mass grievances and have been the
 cutting edge of social criticism in China.
 With the emergence of the "scar" literature' since
 1978, a literature of protest has grown up that is
 remarkable for its boldness in exposing "contradic-
 tions" in Chinese society. Writers-many of them
 rehabilitated rightists who no longer feel they have
 anything to lose by criticizing the party-began first
 to explore the inequities of the Cultural Revolution
 and have subsequently spared no sector of official
 China in uncovering fraud, deceit, and corruption.
 The bravest authors have documented cadre incompe-
 tence, accused army generals, exposed the cruelty of
 the "down-to-the-countryside" program, and ruthless-
 ly satirized Mao and all that is sacred to the old
 guard.
 Senior reformist officials, like party Chairman Hu
 Yaobang and cultural leader Zhou Yang, generally
 sympathize with the artists' critiques of the party.
 This has also encouraged expose writing and some
 investigative reporting in China's national press. Con-
 servatives and some party reformers, however, have
 been alarmed and have attempted-so far to little
 effect-to direct the writers toward service to the
 party.
 Deng and Dissent
 Deng Xiaoping, the prime mover in the recent crack-
 down on dissent, initially supported the right of
 dissidents to criticize the party and clearly sought to
 use their critiques to his advantage against his oppo-
 nents. He told         that wall
 posters had been "in con ormity with the Chinese
 constitution" and that the Chinese people had "the
 capability to judge the truth." He encouraged dissi-.
 dents to attack the leftist excesses and manipulated
 their critiques to gain support for his personnel and
 policy positions in the Politburo. He lashed out at
 adversaries for attempting to "still dissent" and to
 suppress the "activism of the masses," and was suc-
 cessful in purging leftist opponents like party Vice
 Chairman Wang Dongxing after party debates that
 echoed dissident complaints.

 Secret
 Deng's initial manipulation of dissident critiques ex-
 posed his flanks to political attack in the Politburo.
 Deng's opponents linked his moderate policies toward
 intellectuals, his calls for the democratization of the
 party and society, and his reform-oriented social
 policies with support for dissidents. They charged that
 Deng and his reform policies were largely responsible
 for growing social disorder in April 1979, and alleged
 that dissidents constituted a fifth column, rather than
 a loyal opposition, because they refused to acknowl-
 edge the primacy of the party.
 Deng himself, now concerned about the dissidents'
 potential as a long-term threat to internal stability,
 responded with arrests of the most prominent dissi-
 dents and an enunciation of the "four basic princi-
 ples." These insist that despite the party's determina-
 tion to "emancipate the mind," all criticism must
 defer to socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat,
 party leadership, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Ze-
 dong Thought.
 Deng and his allies not only are antagonized by
 dissident critiques of the validity of the socialist
 system but also have drawn lessons from the crisis in
 Poland, where grass-roots political action snowballed
 into abroad-based effort to reform the party. Deng
 has become increasingly concerned that dissident
 ideas may attract workers and intellectuals away from
 the party and believes that dissident critiques have
 aggravated, not healed, the party's "crisis of confi-
 dence." Asense of eroding support for the Communist
 party and a general disdain on the part of Chinese
 intellectuals for Marxism-Leninism have almost cer-
 tainly buttressed these apprehensions.
 Since the December 1980 work conference, when the
 party acknowledged the depth of China's current
 economic problems, party leaders have stressed the
 importance of "stability and unity" to ensure the
 success of economic readjustment. They were con-
 cerned that dissident critiques would only fuel popular
 unhappiness with high inflation, unemployment, and
 temporary shortages while factories are restructured.
 In support of his harder line against the dissidents,
 Deng has expressed concern about their:
 ? Critique of the socialist system. Deng does not want
 to extinguish legitimate criticism, but he will not
 tolerate views that question the validity of the
 socialist system or party supremacy. Deng has told
 party leaders more than once that dissidents
 "wished to practice democracy without party lead-
 ership" and has promised that this would never be
 permitted.
 ? Competition with the leadership and the reform
 program. Deng, Hu Yaobang, and other senior
 reform leaders are concerned that the public recog-
 nition accorded the dissidents has included the
 perception that the party has lagged behind their
 actions. Mao was first openly debunked in wall post-
 ers and only later-after the party adopted the
 dissidents' slogan-officially described as "a man
 and not a god."
 ? Organization and infiltration into the party. Despite
 the small size of the dissident movement, Deng and
 party leaders are worried-with some reason-
 about the organization of networks among dissident
 groups on college campuses, in cities across China,
 and in factories. Deng wants to prevent young
 reformers in the party from forging links with
 dissident organizations. The party leadership real-
 izes that as in Poland dissidents could well begin a
 reform movement from below in the party.
 leaders, demeans China's dignity.
 ? Foreign involvement. Deng has criticized the dissi-
 dents for accepting foreign, "bourgeois" ideas of
 democracy and freedom. He has been wary of the
 contacts dissidents have developed with foreign re-
 porters and has backed accusations that they are
 passing state secrets. The party made an ideological
 case last spring that "class struggle" must be car-
 ried out against the influence of foreign ideas like
 "anarchism" and "ultra-individualism." Beyond
 these concerns, moreover, Deng believes that dissi-
 dent activity fosters an image of Chinese instability
 abroad and, through its blunt criticism of Chinese

 Deng has continued to line up with conservative views
 on the need to control dissent since the party's central
 work conference last December. While ostensibly
 supporting the principle of "socialist democracy,"
 Deng has agreed to a dragnet to arrest the most
 outspoken dissidents and to permit party documents
 that mandate the restriction of forums for dissidents.
 He has again demonstrated that he will sacrifice the
 interests of some in his group who favor greater
 .freedom of expression to the more urgent need for
 social order and discipline. Indeed, this trade-off on
 Deng's list was apparently a precondition to the
 endorsement for his critical objectives-removal of
 party Chairman Hua Guofeng and agreement on the
 reassessment of Mao Zedong-from senior party
 leaders.
 Although agreeing with the need to limit dissent,
 Deng has squelched the efforts of hardliners to broad-
 en the crackdown significantly. In particular, he has
 tried to separate the harsher approach toward "dis-
 sent" from the maintenance of a moderate policy to
 intellectuals whose support he believes is critical to
 the success of his reform program. Deng has reas-
 sured them that the crackdown does not mark a
 fundamental change in the regime's policies and has
 told them that they will not become targets of a
 political campaign against dissent. In trying to limit
 the targets for the hardliners, Deng has reined in
 some of his own supporters who have backed dissi-
 dents and who want greater liberalization. Neverthe-
 less, Deng must move cautiously or risk alienating
 some of his own supporters in the party as he moves to
 accommodate the concerns of the hardliners.
 The Views Surrounding Deng
 Hardliners who oppose the liberal emphasis of
 Deng's reform program-like number-two ranking
 Ye Jianying and Army General Political Department
 Director Wei Guoqing-attribute the dissidents' ex-
 cesses to difficulties created by reform. They have
 sought to tie the demands for greater democracy and
 "human rights" with a wide range of social and
 economic problems, especially rising crime rates, poor
 economic performance, the party's "crisis of confi-
 dence," and labor unrest.
 Leading military figures have been most strident in
 asserting that Deng's moderate policies toward intel-
 lectuals provide fertile ground for the growth of
 dissent. The Army, which has forcefully expressed
 displeasure with the reformers' emphasis on material
 rewards and pragmatic ideology, vigorously criticized
 liberal writers this spring as representatives of the
 "ideological trend toward the liberalization" of Chi-
 nese society.
 Even senior leaders associated with party reform like
 Vice Chairman Chen Yun and party Chairman Hu
 Yaobang deeply distrust dissidence. They see dissi-
 dent wall posters and pamphlets as an extension of the
 disruptive mass politics of the 1960s. These leaders
 have accused young dissidents of being proponents of
 a "second Cultural Revolution," and "anarchists" and
 "ultra-individualists" who are unpatriotic and infatu-
 ated with Western ideas.
 Even so, many reformers, who now occupy important
 positions in culture, the media, and the scientific
 establishment, tolerate dissent. They fear that sup-
 pression would lead to a restriction of the regime's
 liberal policies toward intellectuals and have contin-
 ued to lobby for increased intellectual freedom. Deng
 has tried to convince reformers to accept his conces-
 sions to hardliners on dissent, but he will face pressure
 in the future to reopen the "window of democracy."
 Containing Dissent
 The party has instituted a variety of measures to
 control dissent in addition to the arrests of leading
 dissidents and the suppression of unofficial publica-
 tions.

 Media campaigns have tightened guidelines for intel-
 lectuals, chastened errant writers and artists, and
 warned against further dissident activity. The cam-
 paigns seek to increase confidence in the party and to

 Secret
 The intensified political indoctrination on college
 campuses and in the party insists upon adherence to
 party leadership and the "four basic principles." It
 invokes the virtues of patriotism, and resurrects
 Maoist social models and slogans to guide the behav-
 ior of intellectuals. The party has wrapped itself
 ostentatiously in the mantle of Chinese traditional
 culture, called for proper behavior among youth,
 reiterated the necessity for hierarchy and obedience to
 authority, and sought to channel youthful energies
 into the creation of a Marxist "spiritual civilization."
 The national media have also urged writers to adhere
 to party guidelines. The military, which has been
 disgruntled because of its dim prospects for benefiting
 from modernization despite the party stress on mate-
 rial incentives, took the lead in reining in liberal
 writers in mid-April. Then, the Liberation Army
 Daily openly attacked writer Bai Hua for his film-
 script "Bitter Love" in a manner that smacked of the
 tactics of the Cultural Revolution
 The party has issued central directives that assert
 tighter control over art and literature and call for the
 suppression of dissident organizations. The directives
 attack dissidents in harsh language for attempting to
 seize party power and to "see the state plunged into
 chaos." They restrict dissident activities, ban "links"
 between dissident organizations, order the arrest of
 dissidents who continue to publish in defiance of party
 orders, and call for the investigation of party members
 suspected of having connections with dissident groups.
 The directives also order officially sponsored writers
 to accept the consensus on the historical evaluation of
 Mao Zedong and place restrictions on further criti-
 cism of sensitive periods in the party's history-such
 as the Cultural Revolution and the 1957 Anti-
 Rightist Movement. The party has instructed writers
 to submit to greater party control over the arts by
 emphasizing their responsibility to socialist society.
 The party has also decided to use its propaganda
 apparatus to check dissidents within its own ranks.
 Reactions and Implications
 Dissidents have won widespread sympathy-mostly in
 China's cities-for their positions, which has given
 them prominence and potential influence that exceeds
 their numbers. They have articulated the grievances
 of China's young and its intellectuals with the party,
 and, most tellingly, have by their example forced the
 party to address many of their complaints. They have
 made national issues out of the special privileges of   25X1
 party officials and the need for rule by law and party
 obedience to the constitution. Even though the more
 radical "democratic movement" dissidents are vulner-
 able to periodic crackdowns, dissidents in art and
 literature continue to command sizable audiences and
 to address similar issues.
 The dissidents do not pose a threat to the regime;
 indeed, it has easily rounded up as many as 200
 dissidents across China and closed down all unofficial
 publications. Nevertheless, the dissident issue is
 symptomatic of larger problems the Chinese leader-     25X1
 ship faces. The party will be able to muffle, but not to
 extinguish, its critics, and dissent will continue to
 appear in one form or another, sounding similar
 themes
 The suppression of dissent has caused friction between
 the Army and the party, and between conservatives
 and liberals in both organizations. The Army used its
 critique of Bai Hua in the Liberation Army Daily to

 Approved For Release 2007/08/04 :CIA-RDP83B00551 8000200150006-6
 raise broader objections to party reforms; it has also
 sought to blunt the reformer's critique of "leftism" in
 the Army and to revive Maoist standards for the arts.
 Deng, who gave the Army its opening by permitting
 criticism of Bai Hua's film "Bitter Love," subseguent-
 ly ordered limits on the Army's critique.
 Reaction to the party's harder line among intellectu-
 als, especially liberals in the Ministry of Culture, has
 been cool. Liberal writers-including senior cultural
 figures like Zhou Yang, deputy director of the Propa-
 ganda Department~ountered the Army's initiative
 by awarding a prize to Bai Hua for another of his
 works and publishing speeches in People's Daily that
 endorse a comparatively moderate cultural policy.
 These actions helped to limit the scope of a crackdown
 and worked to ensure that cultural policy would
 guarantee at least a modicum of intellectual freedom.
 The provincial media have mostly echoed the line
 contained in the restrictive central directives, but
 actual compliance with the documents has been
 spotty. Provincial First Secretaries in several prov-
 inces have protected writers who were singled out for
 criticism by the party Propaganda Department and
 have tried to soften the criticism of authors overall.
 Others-notably in Hebei Province-have, however,
 loudly endorsed the tougher line of Liberation Army
 Daily.
 The party, which has traditionally associated dissent
 with foreign influence, has already made some efforts
 to supervise more closely or curtail cultural programs
 and contacts with foreigners. It has also placed great-
 er restrictions on the activities of American social
 scientists doing research in China and has issued
 documents limiting the access of Western reporters to
 Chinese officials. The party, moreover, has banned
 The decision to suppress dissent could also pose
 political problems for Deng's reform program. Faced
 with serious economic and political difficulties, Deng
 has leaned toward conservative demands for "stability
 and unity," muffling the voice of popular dissatisfac-
 tion that has served his interests in disciplining and
 rectifying the bureaucracy. He risks alienating mem-   25X1
 bers of his reform group who advocate the tolerance of
 dissent and liberalization of Chinese society.
 As the suppression of dissent strains relations between
 reformers and leftists in the party, it may raise the
 level of tension in the bureaucracy and embolden
 those who seek to discredit the reform program.
 Senior reformers, who are known to have protected
 dissidents in the past, will be vulnerable to leftist
 critiques. Although dissidents attack the left with
 vehemence, the ultimate victims may be the party
 reformers.
 Deng must deal with the prospect that diminishing
 enthusiasm among the intellectuals may extinguish
 the sense of innovation required for modernization as
 well. The party has never successfully disciplined
 intellectuals and won their allegiance to its programs.
 While reformers have to a degree championed and
 used dissident issues, their need to compromise with
 vested interests in the party to secure key changes in
 the leadership will restrain further identification with
 those themes.
 Efforts to recruit more intellectuals to party ranks are
 likely to be slowed by revivals of the worn out and
 unappealing Maoist themes of the 1950s and 1960s.
 Problems with young intellectuals-particularly those
 now on college campuses-in the future could well
 appear in efforts to emigrate, a lack of active support
 for the regime, and indifferent performance in the
 work place
 The move to suppress dissent is likely to strengthen
 the resolve of those who oppose or seek to criticize the
 party. Reflecting the complexity of the dissident
 movement, the PLA's thwarted attack on writer Bai
 Hua provoked a strong reaction from more liberal
 figures in the Cultural Ministry and in the media-a
 further encoura ement to dissidents outside official
 circle

 Secret
 Current restrictions on dissident activity seem unlike-
 ly to loosen in the near future. The "Resolution on
 Certain Historical Questions" recently passed at the
 party Central Committee's Sixth Plenum clearly stat-
 ed the party's determination that dissidents not "air
 their views in a big way," and it supported the party's
 decision to prosecute "rightists" in the late 1950s.
 Hence, another blossoming of dissent probably will
 not occur, but dissidents will remain aloes-level
 irritant for the regime in the future.
 In the event that a crisis within the leadership occurs,
 dissidents have the potential to rally the people
 against the regime and to spark mass demonstrations
 like the Tiananmen rally that led to the fall of the
 Gang of Four in 1976. Dissidents have shown an
 extraordinary ability to organize and articulate mass
 frustrations with the regime-a legacy they have
 inherited from the Cultural Revolution. In the long
 run, however, the course of dissent will depend upon
 the success of Deng and party reformers in reviving
 the economy and consolidating their hold on the
 party.
