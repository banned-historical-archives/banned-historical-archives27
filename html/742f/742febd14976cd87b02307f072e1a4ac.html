LONDON OBSERVER 
25 August 197h 
A fog of mystification and elaborate security hides the activities of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, with its world-wide network of secret 
agents and allies. Originally formed with the respectable purpose of 
ensuring that the Government was better informed, it has become a 
clandestine operational tool of the United States Presidency, organising 
undercover intervention in the internal politics of foreign countries. 
Now the facts have been revealed for the first time by an ex-CIA-
man, VICTOR MARCHETTI, who in 14 years rose to a top-level job, 
working in the office of the Director. In collaboration with JOHN D. 
MARKS, a former intelligence agent in the State Department, he 
resolved to break ihe Wall of silence around the Agency. - 
Backed by the Government, the CIA tried to kill their-book before 
it was written, then held up publication for nearly a year. Under a legal 
ruling, it ordered the deletion of 339 passages. The authors and pub-
lishers (one of the biggest in America) fought back in the courts, won 
the reinstatement of 171 passages (including those published below in 
'black type) and defeated the CIA and the Government by publishing 
the book, leaving blank spaces (identified here as 000) where the 
text is still censored. 
Our opening extract from this book?the first in American history 
subjected to prior Government censorship?describes how successive--
Presidents used 
THERE. exists in the United States 
today a powerful and dangerous 
secret cult?the cult of intelli-
gence. 
Its holy men are the clandestine 
professionals of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. Its patrons and 
protectors are the highest officials 
of the Federal Government. The 
Agency's methods and assets are a 
resource that come with the office 
of the Presidency. Richard Nixon ? 
and Secretary of State Kissinger 
used them to the full. 
The purpose of the cult is to 
further the foreign policies of the, 
US Government by covert and 
usually illegal means. Tradition-
ally, the cult's hope has been to 
foster a world order in which 
America would reign supreme, the 
unchallenged international leader. 
Today, however, the dream stands 
tarnished by time and frequent 
failures. . Thus, the cult's objec-
tives are now less grandiose, 
but no less disturbing. Its world-
wide war against Communism has 
to some extent been reduced to a 
covert struggle to maintain a self-
sefking stability in the Third 
'World, using whatever clandestine 
methods are available. 
;.5 
the CIA and lied for it. 
The CIA is the primary instru-
ment of the cult of intelligence. 
It engages in espionage and 
counter-espionage, in propaganda 
and the deliberate circulation of 
false information, in psychological 
warfare and paramilitary activities. 
It penetrates and manipulates.. 
private institutions, and creates its 
own commercial . organisations 
(called.. proprietaries'). It re--
cruits agents and mercenaries ; -it 
bribes and blackmails foreign 
officials to carry out its unsavoury" 
tasks. It does whatever is required 
.to achieve its goals, without any 
consideration of the ethics involved 
or the moral consequences of its 
actions. As the secret action arm 
.of American foreign policy, the 
CIA's most potent weapon is its 
covert intervention in the i.nternal 
affairs of countries the US Govern-
ment wishes to control or influence. 
Members of the cult of intelli-
gence, including Presidents (who 
are always aware of, generally 
approve of and often actually . 
initiate the CIA's major under-
takings), have lied to protect the 
CIA and hide their own responsi-
? bility for its operations. The Eisen-
bower Administration lied about 
the CIA's support of the unsuccess-
ful rebellion in Indonesia in 1958; 
and Francis Gary Powers's 1960 
U-2 mission. The Kennedy 
Administration lied about the 
CIA's role in the abortive invasion 
of Cuba in 1961, admitting its 
-involvement only after the opera-
tion had failed disastrously. The 
Johnson Administration lied about 
all of the CIA's commitments in? 
Vietnam and Laos. And the Nixon 
Administration publicly lied about 
the Agency's attempt to fix the 
Chilean election in 1970. 
The justification for the right 
to -lie ' is that secrecy in covert 
operations is necessary to prevent 
US policies and actions from 
coming to the attention of the 
enemy '?or, in the parlance of 
the clandestine trade, the opposi-
tion '. None the less, in many 
instances the opposition knows 
exactly what covert Operations are 
being targeted against it. The

Soviets and the Chinese as Soviet

'US is to the CIA. 
From 1952 to 1954, 'at.the height 
of the Cold War, the Soviet KGB 
electronically intercepted even the. 
most secret messages routed 
through the code room of the US 
Embassy in Moscow. This breach 
in secrecy, however, apparently 
caused little damage to US national 
security,' nor did the Soviet Gov-
ernment collapse because the CIA 
had for years secretly intercepted 
the private conversations of the top 
Russian leaders as they talked over 
their limousine radio-telephones. 
Both sides knew more than enough 
to cancel out the effect of any leak. 
The fact is that, in the US, secrecy, 
and deception in intelligence oper-
ations are as ? much to keep - 
.Congress and the public frcim 
learning what their Government is 
doing as to shield those activities, 
from the opposition. 
A good part of the CIA's power 
position is dependent upon its care-
ful mythologising and glorification 
:of the .exploits- of the clandestine 
profession. Like most myths, the 
intrigues and successes of the CIA 
over the years have been more 
imaginary than real. What is real; 
-unfortunately, is the willingness of 
both the public and adherents of 
the cult to believe the fictions. 
. In the field of classical espion-
age, the CIA's Clandestine Services' 
have been singularly unsuccessful 
in their attempts to penetrate or.. 
spy on the major targets. The 
Penkovsky case in the early 1960s, 
the only espionage operation 
igainst the Soviets that the Agency 
can point to with pride, was a 
fortuitous windfall which British 
Intelligence made possible for the 
CIA. 
In the beginning, Penkovsky was 
not a CIA spy. He worked for 
British Intelligence. He had tried 
to join the CIA in Turkey, but had. 
been turned down' mainly because 
the Soviet Bloc Division of the 
Clandestine Services was overly 
careful not to be taken in by KGB 
,double agents, in the period follow-
,ing the Burgess-Maclean catas-
trophe. 
The loudly heralded ?Berlin 
tunnel operation of the mid-1950s 
?actually .a huge telephone wire-
tap?produced literally tons of 
trivia and gossip, but provided 
little in the way of high-grade 
secret information that could be 
used by the Agency's intelligence 
analysts. The operation's true 
value was the embarrassment it 
caused the KGB and the favourable 
publicity it generated for the CIA. 
Against China, there have been no 
agent-related espionage successes 
whatever. 
Fortunately for the US,. 
however, the CIA's techni-
cal experts, working with their 
counterparts in the Pentagon and 
in the private sector, have been 
able over the years to develop a 
wide array of electronic methods 
for collecting much useful infor-
mation on the USSR and China. 
From these collection systems, sup-
plemented hy material accumu-
lat cd through diplomatic channels 
and open sources, the analysts on 
the CIA and elsewhere in the in-
telligence community 'have 'been' 
able. to keep abreast .of .develop-1 
ments within the Communist 
Powers. . 
There can be no doubt that the 
gathering of intelligence is a neces-
sary function of modern govern-
ment. Without an effective pro 
gramme to collect information and. 
to analyse the capabilities and pos-
sible intentions of other major 
Powers, the US could neither have 
confidently negotiated nor now 
? abide by the SALT agreements, or 
achieve any measure of true 
detente with its international 
rivals. 
The issue at hand is a simple one 
of yurpose.?Should- the CIA func-
tion. in the way it was originally 
intended to?as a co-ordinating 
agency responsible for gathering, 
evaluating, and preparing foreign 
intelligence for use by Government 
policy-makers--or should it be per-
mitted to function, as it has done 
over the years, as an operational 
arm, a secret instrument .of the' 
Presidency ? 
The extreme secrecy in which 
the CIA works increases the 
chances that a President will call 
it. into action. He does not have 
to justify the Agency's activities to 
Congress, the Press, or the Ameri-
can people so, barring premature 
disclosure, there is no institutional 
force within the US to stop him 
fr onr oing what he , wan fse 
For example, after Salvador 
Allende had been elected President 
of Chile in 1970, President 'Nixon 
was asked at. a press conference 
why the US was willing to intervene 
militarily in Vietnam to prevent a 
Communist takeover, but would not 
do' the same thing in Chile to 
prevent a Marxist from taking 
power. 
He replied that 'for the United 
States to have intervened in a free 
election and. to have turned it 
around,1 think, would have had 
repercuSsions all around Latin 
America that would have been far 
,worse than what happened in 
Chile.' 
The President failed to mention 
that he had approved 0 0 0 0 0 
Go000?000 0 0 0 0 0 0 
but by keeping his action secret, 
he was able to avoid the adverse 
political reaction ' he feared. If 
.there had been no CIA to do the 
job covertly, the US Government 
almost certainly would not have 
tried to involve itself in the 
Chilean elections, since it was obvi-
ously not willing to own up to its 
action S. 
Almost three years to the day 
after Allende's election, he was 
overthrown and killed in a bloody 
coup d'etat carried out by the com-
bined action of the Chilean armed 
services and national police. His 
Marxist Government was replaced 
by a military junta. What role 
American business or the' CIA may 
have played in the coup -is not 
publicly known, and may never be. 
But CIA Director William Colby 
admitted in secret testimony 
before the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee that the Agency had 
penetrated ' all of Chile's major 
political parties; and that it had 
secretly furnished sonic assis-
tance ' to certain Chilean groups. 
Even if the CIA did not inter-
vene directly in the final putsch,

,CIA and 
Cyprus 
VICTOR MARCHETTI cabled. 
from Washington last week: 
The Greek background to the 
Cypriot disaster presents one 
more reason why. the CIA's 
policies and .prattides should be 
more tightly controlled by the 
United States Congress. 
- The seeds of the disaster were 
sown in Greece almost a decade 
ago, when the clandestine agency 
encouraged King Constantine's 
effort to thwart the political re-
forms of Leftist Premier Papan-
dreou?reportedly a former CIA 
agent. Within two years, a mili-
tary junta took control of the 
country. If the CIA did not act-
ively abet the coup d'etat, it Un-.,  
doubtedly collaborated with the ? 
junta afterward?despite official 
denials by Washington. 
By then, the CIA's operational?
,imperatiye, replacing its thread-
--bare 'to keep the world free for 
democracy,' had become 'to main-
tain stability.' Thus, a repressive 
dictatorship in Greece was prefer-
able to a democratically elected, 
? Left-leaning Government. 
Athens was also a large CIA 
station, from which operations 
could be supported and launched 
against other targets in the Middle 
East. 
Eventually, the crude methods 
of the junta 'became a liability 
? even to the CIA and the US Gov-
ernment. The Agency quietly 
began to disengage, apparently 
transferring certain operational 
assets fo Iran?a safer station, 
now overseen by former CIA 
Director, Ambassador Richard. 
Helms. There would, of course, 
be no trouble with the Shah. The 
CIA had restored him to his 
throne earlier by overthrowing 
Premier Mussadiq. 
On Cyprus, meanwhile, Nicos ? 
Sampson moved?with the appro-
val of the junta?to oust Arch-
bishop Makarios. Allegedly, the 
CIA had 10 days' warning of the 
coup but chose to .do nothing . 
about it. Official Washington 
sources now claim the threatened 
parties Were forewarned. Per-
haps. 
the US Government as a whole did 
take a series of actions designed to 
undercut the Allende regime. 
Henry Kissinger set the tone at a 
background press conference In 
September 1970, when he said that 
Allende's Marxist regime would 
contaminate Argentina, Bolivia 
and Peru?a stretch of the geo- ? 
political imagination reminiscent 
of the South-East Asian domino 
theory. Another measure of the 
White House attitude?and an indi-
cation of the methods it was willing 
to use?was the burgling, of the 
,Chilean Embassy in Washington in 
May 1972 by some of the same men 
who the next month staged the 
break-in at the Watergate. And, 
the US admittedly worked to 
weaken the Allende Government-. 
by cutting off most: economic aid. 
Henry Kissinger has dismissed 
speculation that the CIA helped 
along thiS economic collapse and 
then 'engineered Allende's down-
fall; privately he has said that the 
secret agency wasn't competent to 
manage an operation as difficult as 
the Chilean coup. Kissinger had 
already been supervising the CIA's

most secret operations for more 
than four years when he made this 
disparaging remark. V. hether he 
was telling the truth about the 
CIA's non-involvement in Chile or. 
was simply lying (called 'plausible 
denial '), he along with the Presi-
dent would have made the crucial 
decisions on the Chilean situation. ? 
THE failure of traditional espion-
age against the principal 'opposi-
tion,' the Soviet Union, meant that 
the emphasis within the CIA's 
Clandestine Services shifted to-
ward the Third World. This change 
reflected to a certain extent a 
bureaucratic need as a secret 
agency to find areas where it could 
be successful. More importantly, 
the shift came as a result of a 
hardened determination that the 
US would protect the rest of the 
world from' Communism. Refer-
ring to CIA coups in Iran and 
Guatemala, Allen . Dulles, who 
was Director during the Cold War 
period, wrote.: 'Where there 
begins to be evidence that a coun- ? 
try is slipping and Communist 
takeover is threatened ... we can't 
wait for an engraved invitation to
and give aid.' 
The Agency's shift towards 
covert action was quite obvious to 
young officers taking operational 
training during the mid-1950s at 
'The Farm,' the CIA's West Point, 
located near Williamsburg; Vir-
ginia, and operated under the cover 
of a military base called Camp 
Peary. Most of the methods and 
techniques taught there at that 
time applied to covert action rather 
than traditional espionage, and to 
a great extent training was oriented 
toward such paramilitary activities 
as infiltrationjexfiltration, demoli-
tions and night-time parachute 
jump's. 
The Third World countries,. 
underdeveloped and often corrupt, 
offered far more tempting targets 
for covert action than those in 
Europe. Relatively small sums of 
money, whether delivered directly, 
to local forces or deposited (for 
their leaders) in Swiss bank 
accounts, can have an almost 
magical effect in changing volatile 
political loyalties. 
The CIA's early operations in 
Asia met with mixed success. 
Attempts to develop resistance.. 
movements in China in the 1950s,. 
accomplished nothing more than-. 
the capture of Agency offters John 
Downey and Richard Fecteau?
and death for the Nationalist 
Chinese agents they were trying to 
,plant. Mainland China was not 
fertile territory for Agency opera-
tions. 
But there were successes else-
where.The link insurgency in the 
Philippines was put down with help 
from the CIA, who played upon 
local superstitions about vampires. 
The last member of a rebel patrol 
would be ambushed, his neck punc-
tured vampire-fashion with two 
holes, and the corpse drained of 
blood before it was thrown back 
on the trail. The rebels, as super-
stitious as any other Filipinos, fled 
the region. 
Agency - supported 'Nationalist 
Chinese troops in Burma (when not 
engaged in their principal pastime 
of trafficking in opium) were in-
duced to conduct occasional raids

in the person of Colonel Edward 
Lansdale (the original of Graham

? played a large part in propping up

considered by the Agency to be a? 
major accomp)ishment. ? 
Such gains in Southeast :Asia 
were offset by some notable 
failures, particularly the Agency's 
failure to overthrow President . 
Sukarno of Indonesia in 1958. 
Contrary to denials by President 
Eisenhower and Secretary of State 
Dulles, the CIA gave direct assist-
ance to rebel groups on the .island 
of Sumatra. Agency B-26s even 
carried out bombing missions l in

? The Agency also became deeply 
involved in the chaotic struggle 
which broke out in the Congo in the 
early 1960s. Clandestine. Services 
operators regularly bought and 
sold Congolese politicians, and-the-
Agency supplied money and arms

aries into the Congo, and the 
Agency's' .B-26 bombers, flown. by 
Cuban exile pilots?many of whom 
were Bay of Pig's veterans. ?carried 
Out regular Missions against insur-
gent groups. 
? During these years, the CIA. and. 
its Special Operations Divisions 
were becoming increasgly ? pre-
occupied with Southeast Asia:: In 
Laos, Agency operators organised 
a private army of more than 30,000 
.men and built an-impressive string 
of bases throughout the country. A.. 
few of these bases were used 
as jumping-off points to send 
guerrilla raiding parties, into 
North Vietnam and China. 
The CIA viewed the secret 
war in Laos much more fav-
ourably than the huge mili-
tary struggle that eventually 
developed in Vietnam, The 
Laos fighting was not visible 
to the American public or tile 
world. In fact, the Laotian 
war had been.going for years 
before the US Congress even 
became aware of it.' 
The CIA was in complete 
control in Laos, but at no 
time were more than 40 or 
50 operations officers re-
quired to direct the para-
military -effort. The ground 
fighting was handled by hun-
dreds of Agency contract 
personnel and more than 
30,000 Lao tribesmen, whom 
the CIA from time to time 
secretly decorated with 'in 
telligence ' medals. 
The CIA's Laotian forces. 
were augmented by thou-
sands of Thai volunteers ' 
paid by the Agency. Air sup-
port, an extremely dangerous 
business, was. supplied by 
Air America?a CIA-owned 
airline?and on occasion by 
the Thai Air Force. 
Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the 
: CIA-ARDP77-00432R0004 
CIA supported and financed 
a force of roughly 45,000 
Civilian Irregular Defence 
Guards, local guerrilla troops, 
who fought under the opera-
tional direction of the US 
Army's Special Forces. CIA 
operators and Agency con-
tractees ran the Counter 
Terror teams. The Agency 
also organised guerrilla raids 
against North Vietnam, with 
special emphasis i on intru-
sions by seaborne commando 
groups coming over the 
beach' on specially designed; 
heavily armed, high-speed 
PT-type boats. 
At least one such CIA raid-
ing party was operating in 
that part of the Tonkin Gulf 
in 1964 where two US 
destroyers allegedly came 
under attack by North Viet-
namese ships. 
. These CIA raids may wel: 
have -.specifically provoked 
the North Vietnamese action 
against the destroyers, which 
in turn led to the US Con-, 
gress passing its Tonkin GUlf 
resolution in 1964, setting the 
stage for large-scale Ameri-
can Military involvement in 
Indo-China. 
DEEPLY embedded within 
the clandestine service men-
tality is the belief that 
human ethics and social laws 
have no bearing on covert 
operations or their practi-
tioners. The intelligence pro-
fession, because of, its lofty 
natural security' goals, is 
free from all moral restric-
tions. The determining fac-
tors in secret operations are 
purely- pragmatic : Does the 
job need to be done? Can it 
be done? And can secrecy 
.(or 'plausible denial') 
be-
maintained ? 
One of the lessons learned 
from the Watergate ex-
perience is the scope of this 
amorality and its influence 
on the clandestine -mentality. 
E. Howard Hunt (who 
worked in clandestine opera-
tions for the CIA for 21 
years) claimed that his parti-
cipation in the Watergate 
break-in and the other opera-
tions of the White House 
plumbers group was in 'what 
I believed to be the . . ;best 
interests of my country.' 
Hunt expanded . on this 
point when interrogated be-
fore a federal grand jury in 
April 1973 by Assistant 
Attorney Earl Silbert.

In early October 1969, the 
CIA learned through a secret 
agent that a group .of radicals 
was about to hijack a plane in 
Brazil and escape to Cuba. 
This intelligence was for-
warded to CIA headquarters 
and from there sent on an 
eyes only' basis to Henry 
Kissinger at the White House 
and ton officials of the State 
Department, the Defence De-
partment. and the National 
Security Agency. 
'Within a few days, on 8 
October, the radical group 
commandeered at gunpoint a 
Brazilian commercial, airliner

'wwith 49 people aboard and 
after a refuelling stop in 
Guyana forced the pilot to 
fly to Havana. Neither the 
CIA nor the other agencies of 
the US Government which 
had advance warning of the 
radicals' plan moved to stop 
the crime being committed, 
although at that time the 
official policy of the US?as 
enunciated by the President 
?was to take all possible 
measures to stamp out aerial 
piracy. 
Afterwards, when officials 
of the State Department 
questioned their colleagues 
in the CIA on why measures 
had not been taken to stop 
the hijacking, the Agency's 
clandestine operators de-
layed more than a month be-
fore A;esponding. 
During the interim, secu-
rity forces in Brazil suc-
ceeded in breaking up that 
country's principal revolu-
tionary group and killing its 
leader, Carlos Marighella. 
Shortly after the revolution-
: ee 
ary leader's death on 4 
November, the CIA infor-
mally passed word back to 
the State Department noting 
that if any action had been 
t .ken to stop the October sky-
jacking, the Agency's pene-
tration in the radical move-
went might have been ex-
posed and Marighella's 
organisation could not have 
been destroyed. 
While it was never clear 
whether the agent who 
alerted the clandestine opera-
tors to the hijacking had also 
fingered Marighella, that 
was the impression the CIA 
tried to convey to the State 
Department. The Agency im-
plied it had not prevented 
the hijacking because to have 
done so would have lessened 
the chances of scoring the 
more important goal of 
' neutralising ' Marighella 
and his followers. To the 
.CIA's clandestine operators, 
the end?wiping out the Bra-
zilian radical movement?
apparently had justified the 
means, thus permitting the' 
hijacking to fake place. 
During the last 25 years 
American foreign policy has 
been dominated by the con-
cept of containing Commu-
nism. Sincere men in the 
highest ' Government posts 
believed?and still do believe 
?that their country could 
not survive without resorting 
to the same distasteful 
methods employed by the 
other side. In recent years 
there have been changes in 
America's conduct of foreign 
affairs. Yet the feeling re-

nation's top officials, in the 
CIA and elsewhere, that 
America has an inherent

Similarly, the CIA's annual bud-
get does not show t.he Pentagon's 
annual contribution to the Agency. 
For example, the CIA's Science and 
Technology Directocate has an 
annual budget of only a little more 
than S100 million, but it actually 
spends well over $500 million a 
year. The difference is funded 
largely by the Air Force, which 
underwrites the national .overhead-
reconnaissance effort for the 
entire United States. intelligence 
community. 
For some reason?perhaps be-
cause of the general view- in the. 
CIA ?that its operations are above 
the law?the Agency has tended to 
play fiscal games that other Gov-
ernment departments would not 
dare engage in. One example con-
cerns the Agency's use of its .em-
plOyee retirement fund, certain 
agent . and contract-personnel 
_accounts, and the CIA credit, 
union's capital, to play the stock 
Market. ? With the approval of the 
.top CIA leadership, a small group ? 
of senior Agency officers has for 
years secretly supervised the man-
agement of; these, funds and 
vested them in stocks, hoping tO 
. turn a greater profit than normally 
would be ? earned through the 
Treasury Department's traditional . 
low-interest but safe bank deposits. 
and bond issues. Originally, . the 
investment group; consisting of 
CIA economists, accountants and 
lawyers, -dealt with an. established 
Boston brokerage house, which 
made the final investment de-
cisions. ? Within a matter-of months 
the Agency investors were earning 
bigger profits than ever before. 
Any reasonable reviewer of the 
CIA, after supervising the deploy-
ment of Agency funds and per-
sonnel and weighing these against 
the intelligence gains produced by 
the various directorates, would 
probably come to the same conclu-
sion as did Richard Helms's tem-
porary replacement as Director, 
James Schlesinger. On 5 April 
1973 Schlesinger admitted to the 
Senate Armed Forces Committee 
that," We have a problem ...we 
just " have too many peoPle. It 
turns out to be too many people 
in the operational areas. These 
are the people who in the past, 
served overseas Increasing 
'emphasis is being placed on science 
and technology, and ? on intelli-
gence judgments.' 
Schlesinger's words?and the 
fact that he was not a house man ' 
from ,the Clandestine Services?
were auguries of hope to those 
many critics of the elv 
iv.to be-
lieve that it is overly preoccupied 
him the covert side of intelligence. 
But Schlesinger has been suc-
ceeded by William Colby?a man 
who had ? a highly successful 
career as a clandestine operator 
,specialising in dirty tricks,' and 
who can only be expected to main-
tain the Dulles-Helms policy of 
concentration on covert action. 
At present the Agency uses about 
two-thirds of its funds and its man-
power for covert operations and 
-their support?proportions that 
have been held relatively constant 
for more than 10 years. Thus, out

Although the CIA has had since 
its creation exclusiveresponsibility 
for carrying out overseas espion-
age operations for the'collection of 
national intelligence, the various 
military intelligence agencies and 
the intelligence units of American 
forces stationed abroad have re-
tained the right to seek out tactical 
information for their own depart-
mental requirements. With US 
forces permanently stationed in 
countries like England, Germany, 
Italy, Morocco, Turkey, Panama, 
Japan and -Australia, the military' 
intelligence services have sought 
to. acquire information through 
secret agents---the .justification, .of 
course, always being the need for 
departmental or tactical intelli-
.gence. ?, .? 
A... military . intelligence ,?unit 
assigned to Bangkok, Thailand, as 
late as 1971 was trying to entrap 
Soviet *KGB officers, recruit local 
spies, and even was attempting to 
rim, its own agents into. China 
through , Hong Kong. Little or 
none, of this activity was being 
cleared with the CIA.. 
',In 1967 Helms was urged by his 
staff to authorise an official review 
of intelligence collection by ?com-
munity members, with 'special 
emphasis on the. many technical 
colledion systems.- After several 
months of intense- investigation, 
the small group concluded?this 
was the first sentence of their 
report The ? US .. intelligence 
community collects too much in-
formation.' The study noted that 
the glut of raw data -was clogging 
the intelligence systein and Making 
it difficult for the analysts to 
separate out what was really im-
portant and to produce thoughtful 
material for the policymakers. The 
study* also observed that there 
simply were too-- many' reports on 
too many subjects for the high-
level policymakers to cope with. 
The study caused such consterna-
tion in the CIA that Helms refused 
to disseminate it: 
. Secrecy is an absolute way of life 
at the Agency, and while outsiders 
might consider some of the result-
ing practices comical in the ex-
treme, the subject is treated with 
great seriousness in the CIA. Train-
ing officers lecture new personnel 
for hours on end about security 
consciousness,' and these sessions 
are augmented during an em-
ployee's entire career by refresher 
courses, warning posters, and the

telephone book marked SECRET, 
which is intentionally incomplete. 
It lists no one working in the Clan-
destine Services, and each semi-
annually revised edition leaves out 
the names of many of those em-

so that if the book ever falls into 
-unauthorised hands, no enterpris-

clandestine jobs. f hose temporarily

their names appear in . the next 
edition of the directory, at which 
time others are selected for tele-

Added to this confusion is the 
fact that most Agency phone num-
bers are regularly changed for 
security reasons,- Employees man-
age to keep track of 'Coirtmonly 
called numbers by listino* them in 
their own personal deskdirector-
ies, although they have to be care-
ful to lock these in their safes by

with a security violation. 
Along with the phone books, all 
other classified material (includ-
ing typeNvxiter ribbons and scrap 
paper) is placed in theSe safes 
whenever an office is unoccupied. 
Security guards patrol every part 
of the agency at roughly half-hour 
intervals in the evenings and on 
weekends. 
Even a -charwoman at the CIA 
must gain security clearance in 
order to qualify for the badge that 
she, too, must wear at all times; 
then she must be accompanied by 
an armed security guard while she 
cleans offices ? (where -all classified 
niaterial has presumably already 
been locked up). Some rooms at 
the Agency are considered so 
secret that the charwoman and 
her guard must also be watched 
by someone who works in the 
office. 
. The pervasive secrecy extends 
-everywhere. Cards placed on 
. Agency bulletin boards ,offering 
items for sale conclude: ' Call 
Bill, extension 6464.' It was only 
in 1973 that employees were 
allowed to answer their phones

The - headquarters building, 
located on a partially wooded 125-
acre tract eight miles from down-
town Washington, is a modernistic 
fortress-like structure. Until the 
spring of 1973 one of the two roads 
leading into the s..clucted corn-
- poumwas totally unmarked, and 
the other featured a sign identify-
ing the installation as the Bureau 
of Public Roads. 
When the CIA headquarters 
building was being constructed 
during the late 1930s, the sub-
contractor responsible for putting 
in the heating and air-conditioning 
system asked the Agency how many

reasons, the ,AgenCy refused to tell 
him, and he was forced to make . 
his own "estimate based , on the 
building's size. The resulting 
heating system worked reasonably 
well, while the air-conditioning 
was quite uneven. After initial 
complaints in 1961., the contractor 
installed an individual thermostat 
in each office, but so many Agency 
employees were continually re-
adjusting their thermostats that 
the system got worse. 
At this point the CIA took the 
subcontractor to court to force him 
to make improvements. His 
defence was that lie had installed 
the best system he.could, without a 
clear indication of how many 
people would occupy the building. 
The CIA could not counter this 
reasoning and lost the decision. ? 
Another unusual feature .of the 
CIA headquarters is the cafeteria. 
It is partitioned into a secret and 
an open section, the secret part 
being for Agency employees. only. 
The partition ensures that no. 
visitor will see the face of any 
clandestine operator eating lunch. 
The CIA's ' supergrades' (civilian 
equivalents of generals) have their 
own private dining room in the ex-
ecutive suite, however. There they 
are' provided with higher-quality 
food at lower prices than in the 
cafeteria, served on fine china with 
fresh linen by black waiters in 
immaculate white coats. These 
waiters and the executive cook's are 
regular CIA employees, in contrast 
to the cafeteria personnel, who 
work for a contractor. On several 
occasions the Office of Management 
and Budget has questioned .the 
high cost of this private dining 
room, but the Agency has always 
been able to fend off .the ? attacks, 
as it fends off virtually all attacks - 
on its activities, by citing national 
security.' 
Although .no statistics are avail-
able, mental breakdowns Seem 
more common in .the . Agency's 
tension-laden atmosphere than in 
the population as a whole, and the 
CIA tends to have a more tolerant 
attitude toward mental health 
problems and psychiatric therapy 
than the general public. In the 
Clandestine Services, breakdowns 
are considered virtually normal 
work hazards, and employees are 
encouraged to return to work after 
they have completed treatment. 
Usually no stigma is attached to 
illness of this type; in fact, Richard 
Helms suffered a breakdown- when 
he was still with the Clandestine 
Services during the 1950s and it 
clearly did not hurt his career. Ex-
Clandestine Services chief Frank 
Wisner had a similar illness, and 
he later- returned to work as the 
CIA station chief in London'. 
Many Agency officials are known 
for their heavy drinking, which 
also seems to be looked upon as an 
occupational hazard. Again, the 
CIA is more sympathetic, to drink-
ing 'problems than outside organ-
isations. Drug use, however, re-
mains absolutely taboo. 
INTELLIGENCE a;;.tencies, in the 
popular view, are organisations of 
glamorous master spies who, in the 
best tradition of James Bond, dar-
ingly uncover the /Nil intentions 
of a nation's -enemies. to reality, 
however, the CIA has compara-
tively little success in acquiring 
intelligence through secret agents. 
This classical form of espionage 
has for many years ranged con-
siderably below space satellites, 
code-breaking, and other- forms of 
technical collection as a source of 
important foreign information to 
the US Government. Even open 
sources (the Press and 'other corn-
Inunications media) and official, 
channels (diplomats, military at-
taches, and the like) provide more 
valuable information than the 
Clandestine Services ot the CIA. 
Against its two principal targets, 
the Soviet Union and Communist 
China, the. effectiveness of CIA 
spies is virtually nil. - 
To be Sure, the Agency has 
pulled off an occasional .espionage 
coup, but these have generally in-
volved the 'walk-ins '?defectors 
who take the initiative- in offering 
their services to the Agency. 
Nearly all the Soviets and Chinese 
who either spied for the CIA or de-
fected to the West did so without 
.being actively recruited by Ameri-
ca's leading espionage agency. ? 
A large percentage of defectors' 
become psychologically depressed 
with their new lives once the initial 
excitement ,of resettlement in a 
.new country wears off. A few have 
cOmmitted suicide. To try to keep 
the defector content, the CIA 
assigns 'a case officer to each one 
for as long as is thought necessary. 
With a particularly volatile defec-. 
tor ? the Agency maintains even 
closer surveillance, including tele-
phone taps and ejail intercepts. 
In some instances, case officers 
will watch over the defector for 
the rest of his life. More than 
anything else, the Agency wants no 
defector to become so dissatisfied 
that he will be tempted to return 
to his native country. 
Agents are intricate and, often, 
delicately balanced individuals. 
With the Soviet Oleg Penkovsky, 
his British and CIA handlers found 
that. flattery Ny as a particularly 
effective- method of motivation.. 
Although be preferred British 
manners, Penkovsky greatly ad-
mired American power. Accord-
ingly, he was secretly granted US 
citizenship and presented with his 
' secret' CIA medal. As a military 
man he was quite conscious of rank; 
consequently, he was made a 
colonel in the US Army to show 
him that he suffered no loss of 
status. because of his shift in 
allegiance. 
On two occasions while Penkov-
sky was an active spy, he travelled 
outside the USSR on official duty 
with high-level delegations attend-
ing Soviet-sponsored trade shows. 
Both times, first in London and 
then- in Paris, he slipped away 
from his Soviet colleagues for .de-
briefing arid -training 'sp.ssions with . 
British and American case officers. 
During one of the London meet-
ings, he asked to see his :US Army 
uniform. None of the CIA men, 
nor any of the. British operators, 
had anticipated such a request. 
One quick-thin king officer, how-
ever, announced that the uniform 
was at another safe house and that 
6 
driving there and bringing it back. 
for Penkovsky to see would take 
a while. The spy was temporarily 
placated, and a CIA case officer 
was immediately dispatched to find 
a colonel's uniform to show to the 
agent. After scurrying riround 
eondon for a couple of hours in 
search of an American Army' 
colonel with a build similar . tO 
Penkovsky's,,the operator returned 
triumphantly to the debriefing 
session just as it was concluding?
uniform in hand; Penkovsky was 
pleased., 
. Months later, in Paris, the CIA 
operators Were better prepared. A 
brand-new uniform tailored to 
Penkovskv's measurements was 
hung in a closet in a room, adjacent 
to where he was being debriefed, 
and he inspected it happily .when 
the meeting was concluded. - ? 
A NUMBER of years ago the CIA 
established a secret .historical lib; 
rat-y, later a secret internal profes-
sional journal, and in '1967 began 
the preparation of the exhaustive 
history of the Agency, being writ-
ten by retired senior officers. 
Recognising the irresistible ten-
dency Of :former .intelligence offi-
cers to write their memoirs and 
thereby often to embarrass their. 
-organisations and their Govern-
ments with their revelations Direc-
tor Helms prudently aoreed:to per-
mit the preparation of-an - official 
secret history of the CIA and its 
clandestine . activities. . Retired 
senior- officials were rehired on 
contract at their former salaries to 
spend a couple of additional years 
with the Agency putting 'their 
recollections down on paper. 
Helnis's . decision was a master 
stroke. The history will never be 
completed, nor will it ever he pub-
lished. By definition it is ,a perpet-
ual project and one that can be read 
only by those who have: a clear 
heed to know.' But the writers, the 
battle-scarred old hands, have got 
their frustrations out of their 
systems?with no harm done?and 
they have probably been better 
paid than they would ? have been 
had they gone public. 
Counter-espionage, like covert 
action, has become a career spec-
iality in the CIA; some clandestine 
operators do no other type of 
work during their years with the 
Agency. These specialists have 
developed their own - clannish 
sub-culture within the Clandes-
tine Services, and even ether CIA 
operators often find them exces-
sively secretive and deceptive. 
The function of the counter-espion-
age officers is to question and 
verify every aspect of CIA opera-
tions taking nothinr, at face 
value, they tend to see deceit every-

tremely mistrustful people, they

positions in the CIA most likely 
to have been infiltrated by the 
KGB and maintaining constant 
surv eiflance on the occupants.

;nat the most vocal students in all parts of

agency as representative of all that is

Question periods were all taken up by

a.pitals of the world, including 
Washington and London: its backing of 
rise;-wing totalitarian regimes; and its

the wcrld in his head.") 
Whatever the motives, there are 
thousands of young Americans whowould 
give their eyeteeth to be employed by the 
CIA or. simply, to "get into the in-
telligence business," as one student put it 
to me, and by "intelligence" he clearly 
meant the spookier side. 
Although every one of the thousands of 
letters of application that reach the CIA 
:ieadquarters at Langley. Va., is given 
serious consideration, the attitude of 
agency recruiters is generally one of 
"Don't call us; we'll call you,'

to the CIA is regarded as ground for 
suspicion. And for good reason. An 
analysis of these letters shows clearly 
Mat many of them were prompted by 
motives other than patriotic ()ties, a 
chance to "have a look at the insideso that 
I can write a book about it later" being a 
particularly prominent one. 
The CIA keeps what must certainly be 
the largest card file in existence of possi-
ble recruits for its organization?univer-
sity students, members of certain 
professions and people having certain 
special qualifications. A person may find 
himself propositioned by a CIA recruiter 
because some area division chief hasask-
ed for ''a man, age early 20s. who has a 
background in electronics, who speaks 
Hungarian although is not of Hungarian 
ancestry, and who can meet the agency's 
criteria for career officers." 
He is more likely to be approached, 
however, if he is simply a senior in "one of 
the better American universities?(i.e.; 
one that has a minimum of stutlent 
demonstrations) with a B average, an ab-
sence of left-wing affiliations and a 
record of sound emotional health. The 
CIA employs professors and graduate 
students at "the better American univer-
sities- to canvass members 'of senior 
classes, either in the name of the CIA it-
self or through some "front,- commer-
cial or institutional. 
ONCE YOU GET IN, you will findYour-
self in a whole new world. The CIA's 
recruiters do their best to screen out the 
romantics and to select only young men 
and women whosemotivationsareentire-
ly practical: but I would say that 99 per 
cent of those who join the agency are at 
least partly attracted by the glamor. 
Even those few who are entirely blase 
when they first get into the agency are 
certain to be dazzled by the in-
doctrination. e - 
The first training undergone by young 
CIA employes who are "officer 
material" takes place in the modern, 
streamlined buildings at Langley. Much 
of it is concerned with routine matters 
such as forms for reports. how tograde in-

CIA: But who will 
watch the watchers? 
Without Cloak or Dagger, by Miles 
Copeland. New York: Simon and 
Schuster. $8.95. 
By Leon Lindsay 
If you want to know as much about 
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency 
as possible ? without compromising 
its present or future operations, of 
course ? what better source than a 
man who was present at its inception, 
has served it long and well in many 
capacities, and retains his status in 
the agency's "gentlemen's club"? 
Miles Copeland is that man. For 278 
well-written pages the author edu-
cates the reader about intelligence, 
espionage, and counterespionage, 
carefully avoiding any exposures of 
sensitive identities or operations. 
There is not much doubt that this is 
an "authorized biography" of the 
CIA, published to counter recent 
publication of adverse articles and 
books. 
If it is not a defense or an apologia 
for the Agency ? which has recently 
seen its romantic, "cloak and dag-
ger" public image stripped away to 
expose the uglier aspects of its oper-
ations ? it is at least an attempt to 
present the "real" CIA. 
If, in casual, disarming references, 
some of the cold-bloodedness, cli-
quishness, and self-justification slip 
through ? well, that is not going to 
alarm the reader very much. Even 
the assertion that someone has to 
take care of "dirty tricks" may seem 
a truism in these times. 
But there are still, one would hope, 
a lot of Americans who are not going 
to be able to accept Mr. Copeland's 
final chapter, "Some Conclusions." 
Most of these "conclusions" are 
stated with the kind of righteous 
assurance one usually expects only 
from fanatics. For example: 
"If it isn't already, the CIA may 
well become 'the world's most pow-
erful government agency,' as one 
columnist called it." 
The word "agency" may not ex-
actly put the CIA on the same plane as 
the three great branches of U.S. 
government ? until one reads a few 
lines farther on: 
" 'The dangers are increasing,' an 
Agency official told me, 'and our 
power to deal with them is increasing 
proportionately. But so is the public's 
fear of us. Although the nature of the 
dangers is such that the Agency can 
hardly become less secret in handling 
its information . . . , it can at least 
put its trust in a representative 
number of Congressmen" (my ital-
ics). 
What are the "increasing dan-
gers"? Mr. Copeland identifies two: 
first, terrorism, andparticularly new-
left terrorism, which he says is a 
worldwide, if amorphous conspiracy: 
second, the competing imperialisms 
of the Soviet Union and Communist 
China ? vying with each other to 
economically strangle the U.S. by 
taking over, through one means or 
another, areas of the world with 
strategic materials. 
The extent of records kept by the 
FBI, Army CIC, and other agencies, 
in connection with suspected left-wing 
associations, has only recently been 
?discovered ? and decried. Mr. Cope-
land admits that the CIA has the most 
comprehensive computerized file on 
individuals in the world, and he gives 
it a name: "Octopus." 
The file's existence is justified, he 
says, by the terrorist threat. Even 
some of the CIA's liberals don't like it. 
But, explains Mr. Copeland, even 
these civil-rights-conscious people ac-
cept its necessity for they know 
frightening facts the ordinary citizen 
doesn't. 
He makes some other statements 
that seem relevant: "Removing the 
dangers inherent in a 'powerful' gov-
ernment agency is-not a matter of 
decreasing the power, but of ensuring 
that those who exercise it are in-
corruptible and truly responsive to 
public interest." (italics his). 
The CIA "will support politicians, 
political groups, and governments 
through the world [including in the 
U.S.?] whose objectives are com-
patible with our own; it will some-
times work with unpopular organiza-
tions ? American, international, and 
foreign. 
"All these actions are certain to 
result in some public outcry, and the 
extent to which the agency is able to 
survive it will depend on the extent to 
8 
which the public becomes confident 
that the agency really has unpubli-
shable information necessitating the 
moves, and is acting entirely in the 
public interest and not for the gain of 
Individual political figures, political 
parties, or special-interest groups." 
In this case, the reader is led to 
assume, as in justifying other activi-
ties, the CIA "will give its contacts in 
Congress ample information to prove 
the necessity for so doing." The 
Implication here, possibly unintentio-
nal, is that the agency itself will 
determine who those congressional 
contacts will be. 
But the same "defusing" process 
that works to abort assignments that 
the CIA 'gentlemen's club" considers 
unwise has other uses. Mr. Copeland 
gives a very disturbing example: 
When James Schlesinger became 
director of the Agency and immedi-
ately began a shakeup (for whatever 
motives), his efforts were cleverly 
sabotaged. Clearly, the CIA will be 
internally changed only if the "gentle-
men's club" wishes it so. 
Mr. Copeland says one maxim is 
being inculcated in the younger men 
now: "'Always keep in mind whom 
you are-working for' ? meaning it's 
not for the President of the United 
States as a person, not for the Direc-
tor of the CIA, but for the CIA as an 
Instrument of the American democ-
racy." 
Considering the existence of "Oc-
topus," the Agency's coziness with 
selected politicians, "dirty tricks" at 
home and abroad, and Mr. Copeland's 
indication that the CIA strongly 
doubts the possibility of real detente, 
one can't help but wonder about their 
definition of democracy. 
In fact, after reading Mr. Cope-
land's conclusions, one might con-
clude that Big Brother is abcrut to 
unlock a door marked "1984."

By PHILIP SHABECOFF 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 ? 
President Ford today named 
George Bush, the Republican 
National Chairman, to be the 
United States envoy to China 
as he announced his first major 
changes in key diplomatic, po-
litical and economic posts. ? 
Mr. Bush, who is 50 years 
old, will succeed the 76-year-
old David X. E. Bruce, who re-
portedly has been ill, as head 
of the United States liaison of-
fice in Peking. . 
- Because they have not estabe 
lished formal diplomatic rela-
tions, the United States and 
China do not have embassies in 
each others capitals and have 
not exchanged ambassadors. As 
,head of a liaison mission rather 
than an ambassador, Mr. Bush 
will not require, confirmation 
bythe Senate. 
Paris Post for Rush 
A White House official close 
to the President said that to-? 
day's appointments marked the 
beginning. of Mr. Ford's efforts 
to reshape both the Govern-
ment and the Republican party. 
, The other significant person-
nel changes announced today 
by the White House press sec-
retary, J. F. terHorst, include 
the following: 
q,K-enneth Rush; the eco-
nomic counselor to formet 
President Nixon, who has con-
tinued in his post under Mr. 
Ford. was nominated to be Am-
bassador to France. 
(!John Sherman Cooper, a. 
Republican Senator from. Ken-
tucky until he retired in 1972, 
was named to be the first Unit-
ed States Ambassador to East 
Germany. 
William D. Rogers, a Wash-
ington 'lawyer and former State 
IDepartment official, was nom-
mated by Mr. Ford to be As-
sistant Secretary of State foe 
Inter-American Affairs.

? At a news briefing today, 
Mr. terHorst also said that 
President* Ford and the White 
House chief of staff, Gen. Alex-
ander 'M. Haig Jr., had been 
discussing possible new assign- ? 
ments for General' Haig and 
that one was the post of com-
mander in chief of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
forces. 
Mr. terHorst said that no de-
cision had been reached and 
that meanwhile, General Haig 
would .continue to 'serve "indef-
initely" as the White House 
chief of staff. However, he said 
that General Haig had indi-
cated to the President that he 
would like to return, to the 
Army. 
Explaining the selection of 
Mr. Bush for the Peking post, 
a high White House official 
said: "George Bush was- a 
strong and viable candidate to 
be Ford's Vice President until 
the last minute. He is some-
body the President holds in 
high regard. His appointment, 
therefore, is a signal to the' 
Chinese that the , new United 
States envoy is somebody who 
has the President's ear." 
Post Has Ambassador's Rank 
Mr. Bush served two terms 
as a member of the House of 
IRepresentatives from Texas. - 
His only experience in diplo-
macy his been about two years 
he spent as United States rep-' 
resentative at the United No:-
tions. 
As head of the liaison rnis-. 
sion in Peking, Mr. Bush will 
hold ambassadorial rank. His 
appointment to a diplomatic. 
post clears the way for Mr, 
Ford to assume effective charge: 
of.-- the Republican National 
Committee, a. White House of; 
ficial acknowledged today. 
The -official agreed that Mr:' 
Ford's recommendation that 
Mary Louise Smith be appoint' 
ed to succeed him indicated 
that the President intended to 
exercise practical control over 
the party. Mrs. Smith is a party' 
professional who has held nol 
major elective position. 
Although Mr. Bush foughtl 
against attempts by the White! 
House, under President Nixon,' 
to use the Republican party to 
defend Mr. Nixon against im-
peachment, he was associated 
iwith the "imagery k; of the 
Watergate scandal, according 
to one White House official. 
The appointment of Kenneth, 
1Rush to the Paris post also 
helps solve a domestic problem 
for President Ford. Mr. Ford 
had been criticized for retain-
ling President Nixon's economic 
lacjvisers even though economic 
conditions have steadily

communist parties, 'and to it-
duce- an atmosphere of terror 
and uncertainty. Perhaps the 
CIA added a little fuel to the 
flames by sowing addition& 
suspicions here and there but 
it seems very unlikely that its 
role, if any, was as crucial as, 
Mr Steven suggests. 
If one is going to rewrite. 
history one needs to provide a 
little evidence. And if one is 
going to indulge in the fashion-
able and often justified pas-
time of bashing the intelligence 
services one needs to show that 
one has higher standards.

I am not convinced by this 
book, and since the author pro-
vides no evidence to support 
his story the reviewer does not 
have to provide any evidence to 
refute it?though it does, in fact, 
contain some factual errors. 
What Mr Steven claims is that' 
the wave of show trials and 
terror which swept across 
eastern Europe before Stalin's 
death was masterminded by Mr 
Allan Dulles of the CIA, who 
hoped that it would so discredit 
the communist regimes that the 
people would rise up in revolt. 
As it turned out, when people 
did rise up somewhat later they 
were put down, but there is no 
evidence that the show trials 
' had much to do with it. Many 
ordinary people were totally 
indifferent to whether one lot 
of communist leaders was put-
ting another lot in prison. 
Mr. Steven, who was on the 
Daily Express and is now on the 
Daily Mail, admias that the 
alleged plot did not work but 
insists that there really was a 
plot. Its key figure, he says, 
was Jozef Swiatlo, a deputy 
head of department in the 
Polish security police, who 
defected to the west in 1953. 
Mr Steven says he was a double 
Wage and Piice Stability. The 
i'White House did not disclose 
'today who would replace him 
in his various jobs. 
Mr. Rush, who held posts as 
Ambassador to West Germany, 
Deputy Secretary' of Defense 
and Deputy Secretary of State 
before moving to' the White 
House, was said to be delighted 
with his new assignment.' He 
will replace John N. Irwin 2d 
in Paris. 
Mr. Rush is' said to be close 
to the French Foreign Minister, 
Jean Sauvagnargues. The two 
men were Ambassadors in Bonn 
at the same time and helped 
negotiate the 1972 agreement 
with the Soviet Union regulat-
ing civilian travel in and around 
Berlin. 
The appointments of Mr. 
Cooper and Mr. Rogers had 
been expected for some weeks. 
President . Ford also an-
nounced today that he planned 
to retain Dean Burch and Ann 
Armstrong as counselors on a 
permanent basis. Both will serve 
politica! functions. Mr. Burch 
will maintain liaison between

Republicans in Congress, and:

Mr. terHorst declined to con-i 
firm a report that General Haigi 
had been selected as the cm-
pander of NATO forces, saying: 
ithat -several possibilities were; 
tbeing discussed and no decision; 
jhad been reached. 
At the briefing, the press' 
;secretary cautioned reporters 
lagainst being "kicked in" to 
the report tha: Gencral Haig 
would get the NATO post. Hel 
had no comment on reports 
that the Government of the 
Netherlands had objected to

The North Atlantic Treaty 
says nothing about obtaining 
the ratification of member na-
tions ? for appointment of a

Under the patronage of Senators Edward Brooke of 'Massachu-

Studies will sponsor a conference on "The Central Intelligence 
Aeency and Covert Actions" September 12 and 13 on Capitol 
Hill. Robert Borosage, a young lawyer in the Nader mold, is 
head of the Center and the moving force behind the conference. 
Borosage has no first-hand experience in intelligence, which

thoughtful and animated discussion. The possibility that such 
discussion will lead to a not-very-secret secret service seems to 
bother him not at all. 
"The cost of enforcing the rules is so great domestically for 
the benefit of those in bureaucratic power," Borosage says, "that 
it is better to go with the limited classification of secrets." This 
is a rather simplistic solution to the whole problem of security 
classification in government?in a very real sense it advocates 
solving the problem by denying that a problem exists. 
In Borcisaat's view the remaining secret information?say one 
percent of what is now classified?would be protected by a "code 
of honor" among those in the intelligence establishme.nt. Such a 
cee.le worked to the satisfaction of the, intelligence bureaucracy 
as long as only the "old boys" of the old boy network were doing

panelists include Thomas Ross on "The CL-Vs Covert Operation 
in the United States"; Richard Falk on "Covert Ope.ra:ions and

as Ray S. Cline,, former CIA and State Department. intelligence 
specialist, will add leaven to the conference's loaf. 
Borosage seems to agree with the ne.i.v school of intelligence 
theory?namely, that it's impossible for an intelligence organi-
zation to do much cood. "Foreign espionage doesn't work against 
the to Communist countries," he says, what we are talking 
about is putting people on the Agency's payroll (in miner foreign 
countries) to influence events, not to collect intelligence." This 
effort by the CIA to push people around, the new cri-lics feel, 
causes crises in foreign affairs. 
The conference's attempt to open 1:7:t intelligence cloiet should 
draw critics of the system like bees to honey. In the wake. of 
Watergate and the neo-isolationism that spreads eith inelation, the 
old, system is more vulnerable than ever. -National security" is 
now an inoperative defense. So if you drop by Borosage's confer-
ence, feel free to join in the discussion. And above all, don't keep 
any secrets.

Smile. The Prophets of Gloom and Doom 
Are Not All Right 
By Colin Greer 
Many formerly optimistic social ob-
servers have come increasingly to be-
lieve in the negative characteristics of. 
being human. . 
More and more, the belief that the 
American Dream of equality would be 
fulfilled?if we could use the power 
of the state to guarantee that dream?
has given way to the conviction that 
people must voluntarily (Robert Heil-
broner) accept or be coerced (B. F. 
Skinner) into new controls. State pow-
ers are seen as undemocratic but 
necessary for order and security. 
The belief that there has been enough 
economic growth to fairly distribute 
material things among people recedes. 
as popular and scholarly observers tell 
us that such growth possibilities are 
severely limited. 
Indeed, we are told, planetary sur-
Nivel' is precarious because we have 
been greedy and irresponsible. The 
solution, in this view, is to give up our 
democratic aspirations rather than to 
redistribute existing benefits. Those 
without will probably have to con-
tinue to do without while the more 
fortunate protect their own interests. 
There are, of course, immense mate-
rial problems ahead of us, but supply 
and profit are so thoroughly manipu-
lated for vested interests that the pri. 
mary problem of more egalitarian, 
more gentle treatment of ourselves and 
our planet is barely apprqachable be-
fore the issues of privilege and ex-
ploitation are subjected to remedial 
social action. 
How can we really know about the 
root scarcity with which we might be 
confronted until we can look at a 
social world in which we make better 
use of what is available?' 
To be sure, this probably means 
Government controls and some level 
of imposition on individual taste and 
appetite. That's nol the problem. Mak-
sing it so is to miss the real point?
namely, the explicitly undemocratic 
nature of what we are being -told is 
necessary. 
The liberal creed' has run out of 
steam. Liberals made a journey a few 
years ago and found that the direc-
tions they followed did not take them 
to the places .they said they were go-
ing. Perhaps, many have come to be-
lieve, those places never existed. It is 
time to stop judging ourselves by un-
fulfilled American Dream promises. 
Unfortunately success flourished less 
extensively than had been presumed: 
Not only black people were poor, not 
only hippies and Weathermen, were 
feeling out of joint in' America. We 
were in danger of bankrupting what 
success there was through ecological, 
and nuclear shortsightedness,jand the 
population explosion. So, in a few, 
years, we graduated from renewed 
talk of group-based genetic inferiority. 
tea more generalized belief in species. 
rooted inadequacies. 
It is in this perspective that Mr. 
Heilbroner's book, "An Inquiry into 
the Human Prospect," and the plaudits 
it has received are important as re-
minders of a growing pessimism. 
This pessimism is characterized by' 
the alleged rediscovery of the neces-
sity for sin to govern human life (Karl 
Menninger), the dominance of heredity 
in intelligence (Richard Herrnstein), 
the overdue need to put a leash on 
human aggression (Erich Fromm), the 
imminent danger of the technological 
future (Alvin Toffler), and the recog-
nition of predominating "animal" prop-
erties in us (Robert Ardrey, Desmond 
Morris). 
? .Mr. Heilbroner, a contributor to the 
nineteen-sixties faith in the progres-
sive power of social analysis and social ? 
action, now writes of a pessimism of 
millenial proportions. Confronted by 
ominous forecasts of material short-
ages, the darker.side of human nature 
is emphasized with an atavistic, al-
most religious, awe of demons in us. 
We continue to live in a culture. 
based on material scarcity. We suffer 
not only from scarcity of oil or food 
but also from the competitive distribu-
tion of both goods and social rela-
tions. Social equilibrium in such a 
culture is maintained by a promise 
of either future plenty or the justifica-
tion of limitations expressed through 
religious, industrial and technological 
myths. We are being pushed in the 
latter direction. - 
I have yet to see, any pessimists 
,call for heavy taxation of the rich; 
rather the message I hear is for the 
-aspiring to aspire less and for those 
who have little to settle for that. Only 
when privilege is secure can other 
conditions be ameliorated. The current 
state of our socio-economic system, 
therefore, seems to require an empha-
sis on conservation rather progres-
sivism. 
Throughout our progress from reli-
-gious to technological myths, the day-
to-day activity of the :tate has in-
creasingly deepened its I. s:eence and 
effect on our lives. Sixties' 1. just 
as much as seventies' pess.,.. 
turned on the possibilities of that 
fluence. The pervasive role of the state 
in -everyday social as well as political 
life is a fait accompli: The involve-
ment of the state in every sector of 
American life is ..nprecedented. The 
significant contemporary questions 
about the?state are those hawing to 
do with the style, quality and content 
'of its- interaction with persons, not 
whether we are to rely on it heavily. 
Economic shifts require value shifts, 
too. And so we are being educated into 
a new distrust of ourselves, a new 
lack of self-respect, a newly regimented 
grammar of 'aspiration. A climate is 
being created which will permit use of 
the state's increased power as an 
agent on behalf of the very exploita-
tion many trusted it grew powerful 
to oppose. This is the real issue before 
us right now,

Black Envoys Seek More Non-African Posts 
By THOMAS A. JOHNSON 
Special to The New York Times 
LAGOS, Nigeria?There is a 
growing fear among black 
Americans in United States 
Government service abroad that 
the concentration of their sen-
ior members in African assign-
ments could lessen their effec-
tiveness in Africa and around 
the world. 
"There is this dilemma," salt 
a black American in west Af-
rica, "that while we are anx-
ious tO serve in Africa, the 
proof of our success in this 
field will be our postings?in 
addition to Africa?to France, 
Peru, Norway and China." 
Five black Foreign Service 
career officers are ambassa-
dors and all have been assigned 
by the State Department to 
Africa. They are John E. Rein-
hardt, Ambassador to Nigeria; 
Terence A. Todman, to Guinea; 
Rudolph Aggrey, to Senegal 
and Gambia; W. Beverly Carter 
Jr., to Tanzania, and David B. 
Bolen, to Botswana, Lesotho 
and Swaziland. 
African assignments have 
also been given to all seven 
blacks who head operations of 
the Agency for International 
Development abroad. Seven Of 
the 10 blacks who head United 
States Information Service of-
fices abroad are assigned to 
Africa. 
Twenty-two black Ameri-
cans have served as Ambassa-
dors since President Truman 
named Edward R. Dudley of 
New York as Ambassador to 
Liberia in 1949, and 17 of 
these have been assigned to 
black nations. The five others 
are Clifford R. Wharton, who 
served in Norway from 1961 
to 1964; Carl T. Rowan, Fin-
land, 1963-64; Patricia R. Har-
ris, Luxembourg, 1965-67; 
Hugh Smythe, Syria, 1965-67, 
and Malta, 1967-69, and Je-
rome H. Holland, Sweden, 
1970-72. c 
Comparison to Industry 
Blacks in Government serv-
ice abroad have been reluc-
tant to discuss publicly their 
fears of what they see as a 
trend. 
But in Washington, senior 
black officials from the State 
Department, the development 
agency and the information 
agency, organized loosely as 
the "Thursday luncheon 
group," met earlier this year 
with Secretary of State Kis-
singer to voice their concerns. 
Sources within the group say 
they hope to meet with Mr. 
Kissinger again soon. 
One black Arrierican diplo-
matic sources in west Africa 
said recently: "In a real sense 
the blacks in foreign service 
are beginning to face the same 
problem as blacks in American 
industry who are executives in 
charge of urban or minority 
affairs, and special markets. 
Both are restricted to low-pri-
ority areas where their black 
skins are supposed to count." 
Asked if a black skin really 
gave a diplomat an advantage 
in Africa, black Americans in 
foreign service generally reply 
with a limited "yes." 
They say it helps to estab-
lish a rapport and to build 
closer and faster relationships 
with Africans than can many?
although not necessarily all?
of their white counterparts. 
But; according to Mr. Todman, 
the Ambassador to Guinea, 
blacks in the Foreign Service 
find, at the same time, that 
when it comes to the basics of 
international negotiations, "Af-
ricans deal with you strictly as 
an American." 
Mr. Reinhardt, the Ambas-
sador to Nigeria,- said, "Initial 
meetings, introductions and in-
vitations to African social 
affairs aside, one does _business 
in any field in Africa on the 
basis of one's competence." 
"We should not expect that 
Africans, any more than other 
peoples, will make decisions on 
grounds other than merit and 
their own national interests," 
Mr. Reinhardt Said. ? 
What do black Africans think 
of black American diplomats? 
Some say, as one African diplo-
mat did, that it is easier to 
"deal with a person who wants 
to be in Africa?who looks like 
us and feels a kinship." Anoth-
er questioned how "a second-
class citizen can really repre-
sent that racist land." 
What seemed a majority 
view, expressed by a senior Ni-
gerian diplomat, was that "the 
only question to consider is 
does the diplomat come with 
real power, does he really speak 
for his Government, can he 
make a decision?". 
The United States Embassy 
here in Lagos, the largest in 
Africa, has been headed. since 
November, 1971, by Mr. Rein-
hardt, a former information of-
ficial in Washington, Iran, 
Japan and the Philippines. 
The Ambassador to Guinea, 
Mr. Todman, was assigned to 
Conakry two years ago afte: 
assignment as the Ambassador 
to Chad and earlier tours in 
the Middle East and at the 
United Nations. 
Mr. Aggrey, appointed edrlier 
this year as the Ambassador 
to Senegal, is a former infor-
mation officer in Africa and a 
former State Department Afri-
can expert. 
Served in Africa 
Before Mr. Carter was named 
Ambassador to the east African 
nation of Tanzania, he too 
served in Africa for the infor-
mation agency. 
The newest of the black Am-
bassadors in Africa is Mr. Bolen, 
who was named earlier this 
year to the southern African 
countries of Botswana, Lesotho 
and Swaziland. He .was a for-
mer economics counselor at the 
American Embassy in Yugo-
slavia. 
The five black Ambassadors 
in Africa serve in about 3 per 
cent of the 143 head of mission 
posts maintained by the United 
States. In all, the 340 black 
employes of the State Depart-
ment come to about 4 per cent 
of that agency's total. 
Higher percentages of black 
employes have been registered 
by the aid and information 
agencies, reflecting primarily 
the recruitment of nonprofes-
I. 
12 
Isional personnel from the heav-
ily black Washington area. , 
Blacks Make tip about 17 per 
cent of the employes of the aid 
agency. It has black Americans 
heading seven major aid pro-
grams in the African nations of 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sene-
gal, Tanzania, Tunisia and 
Zaire. 
The information agency has 
seven black public affairs offi-
cers heading information serv-
ice offices in the African na-
tions of Ethiopia, Gabon, 
Guinea, Liberia, Somalia, Togo 
and Tunisia. 
Three other black Americans 
head information service of-
fices in Bolivia, Laos and Syria.

Pentagon Kept Tight Rein 
In Last Days of Nixon Rule 
? By BERNARD GWERTZMAN 
Special to The New Vol* Time. 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 24?De-
fense Secretary James R. Schles-
inger and the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff kept unusually, close con-
trol over lines of command in 
the last days of the Nixon Ad-
ministration to insure that no 
unauthorized orders were given 
to military units by the White 
House. 
A senior Pentagon official said 
?today that the decision to moni-
1tor closely all orders from any 
Isource was taken by Mr. Schles-
inger, in consultation with Gen. 
George S. Brown, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to pre-
vent any of a series of hypo-
thetical situations from devel-
oping. 
Two Areas Cited - 
The official said that Mr. 
Schlesigner began to worry 
about the situation when in late 
July and early August he felt 
that the impeachment or resig-
nation of Mr. Nixon was in-
evitable. 
There were two major areas 
of concern on Mr. Schlesinger's 
mind, the official said. 
The first was that in some 
"improbable" situation, Mr. 
Nixon or one of his aides might 
get in touch with some military 
units directly without going 
through the usual Pentagon 
chain of command and order 
that some action be taken to 
block the "constitutional pro-
cess." 
The second was hat a genuine 
national emergency might de-
velop in which American mili-
tary units might have to be 
placed on alert or go into ac-
tion, and Mr. Schlesinger and 
General Brown wanted to in-
sure that they would be .able 
publicly to justify the actions. 
No Event Apparent 
The Pentagon official stressed 
today that the concern of Mr. 
Schlesinger was hypothetical 
and did not evolve from any 
event. At no time, the official 
said, was there any sign that 
the White House or any mili-
tary commander was contem-
plating any action outside the 
chains of command. 
Mr. Schlesinger reportedly 
became concerned that if there 
was an impeachment debate 
and then a Senate trial, which 
seemed likely after the House 
Judiciary Committee voted ar-
ticles of impeachment, the 
country could "have difficult 
times." 
There was concern not only 
that somebody at the White 
House might order some unit 
to act against Congress, but 
also that some official might 
seek to have some unit oust the

President. 
Moreover, Mr. Schlesinger, in 
his conversations with Secre-
tary of State Kissinger, was 
also concerned about .a national 
crisis arising while the Presi-
dent's future hung in the 
balance, the Pentagon official 
said. 
Both Mr. Schlesinger and 
Mr. Kissinger remembered the 
general skepticism when Ameri-
can forces were placed on a 
heightened alert last October 
when it seemed as if the Soviet 
Union was contemplating send-
ing forces into the Middle East. 
Allegation Denied 
The alert, on Oct. 24-25, 
came only a few days after the 
so-called "Saturday night mas-
sacre" when Mr. Nixon dis-
missed the Watergate special 
prosecutor, Archibald Cox, pre-
Attorney General Elliot L. 
Richardson and the ouster of 
his deputy, William D. Ruckel-
haus. 
-When Mr. Kissinger had a 
news conference on Oct. 25, he 
was asked repeatedly if the 
alert was linked to some desire 
to. distract public attAntiort 
from the domestic crisis. He 
denied such an allegation, 
stressing then and later 'that 
the alert was legitimate. 
But the 'Pentagon official 
? 
said that the public skepticism 
shown during the alert wor-
ried Mr. Kissinger and Mr. 
Schlesinger, and that they 
were determined to insure that 
if a crisis developed, they 
would be in a position to justi-
fy any military moves. 
Mr. Schlesinger decided that 
he would not leave Washington 
during the White House crisis 
so he would be at the center 
of the Pentagon command. 
Under the National Security 
Act, the President is Command-
er in Chief, as specified by the 
Constitution, and his commands, 
flow downward from the- De-
fense Secretary to the Joint' 
Chiefs of Staff and to the mili-
tary ,units. 
'Mr. Schlesinger, on the rec-
ord, limited , his comments to 
the following: 
"In keeping with my statu-
tory responsibilities, I did as-
sure myself that there . would 
be no question about the-proper 
constitutional and legislated 
chain of command, and there' 
never was any question." 
The Pentagon official who 
disclosed Mr. Schlesinger's con-
cern denied some published re-
ports that Mr. Schlesinger had 
been particularly concerned 
about the loyalty of Air Force 
officers. He said that there 
had been no sign of an prob-
lems with any branch or group 
of officers.

Ta 
James W. McCord Jr., 
one of the men convicted in 
the Watergate break-in and 
bugging case, has subpoe-
naed all presidential tapes 
during the period of the 
original Watergate trial for 
use in his civil lawsuit. 
The subpoena, filed at 
U.S. District Court yester-
day, calls on White House 
Counsel Philip W. Buchen 
to deliver all tapes between 
Jan. 1 and Jan. 31, 1973.

last week calling for the

BALTIMORE SUN 
26 August 1974 
Blemishes among the Spectaculars 
The Minuses of Nixon's Foreign Policy 
Washington. 
. Richard Nixon's die-hard sup-
porters and some of his severest 
critics claim that he left an 
admirable record in foreign poi-
' icy in spite of his impeachable 
crimes and abuse of the presi-
dency. 
Even in -the final hours, before 
' abdicating to avoid -ouster from 
his high office, Richard Nixon 
brushed aside the Watergate 
scandals that had done him in 
and sang the praises of his for-
eign policy accomplishments. He 
even invoked, for the last time 
as President, those well-worn 
cliches?"a generation of peace" 
and "a structure of peace." It. 
? was done in such a way, as to 
suggest that these should corn-
. Pensate for the disgraceful scan-
dals over which he had presided. 
But does the record support - 
the view that the Nixon foreign 
policy was extraordinary? Does 
the legacy in foreign affairs that 
he left for Gerald Ford warrant 
such acclaim? 
There have, indeed, been ac-
complishments. And given the 
public relations operations at the 
White House during Nixon's in-
cumbency they were about the - 
only things the public was told 
about. But there were also some 
great failures both of commission 
and omission. And both Nixon 
. and his only foreign policy advi-
sor, Henry Kissinger, seldom if 
ever mentioned them. When 
.forced to do so, as in the current 
Greece-Turkey-Cyprus disaster, 
lame alibis or attempts to blame 
others were put forth. 
? ? ? 
In addition to failures that find 
American relations with old al-
lies at an all timelow, the Nixon 
accomplishments themselves are 
not without blemishes. For exam-
ple, one of Nixon's last foreign. 
spectaculars?a second summit 
meeting in Moscow early this ? 
.summer?was a failure. It dis-
closed that even in the area 
where Nixon claimed highest 
marks for himself, detente with 
the Soviet Union is at best fra-
gile, uncertain and viewed by 
many Americans with skepti-
cism. Nixon's crude and unwise 
attempt while in Moscow to jus-
tify detente on a special "per-
sonal relationship" with Leonid 
Brezhnev, fortunately for those 
who want real detente, was re-
jected by the Soviet leader. 
The opening to China, which 
By R. H. SHACKFORD 
Nixon exploited with a sensa-
tional televised trip to Peking in 
1972, muddles along. Reversal of 
American policy toward China 
was an accomplishment worthy 
of praise and long overdue. Yet 
the 'manner in which it came 
about is not necessarily the way 
Nixon describes it?his idea and 
initiative. There is some evi-
dence that the initiative came 
from Peking, because of China's 
quarrel with Russia, and that 
Nixon wisely took advantage-of it. - 
Maybe the Nixon "accomplish-
ment" about which one hears the 
most is Vietnam. It is indisputa-
ble that all American fighting 
men were extricated from Viet-
nam during his presidency, even 
though the war . and its cruel 
casualties went on for more than 
four years of the Nixon Adminis-
. tration. But contrary to claims, 
Nixon did not bring peace to that 
s tortured part of the world. He 
used the "peace is at hand" 
claim on the eve of his landslide 
election in 1972, but there is no 
peace in Vietnam or Cambodia. 
The war goes on. Although 
American GI's are not fighting; 
the war is carried on with Amer-
ican money and American mili-
tary equipment and American 
advice. it remains an American 
war, albeit by proxy. 
The verdict on the Middle East 
is still unknown. The Cyprus cri-
sis is separate from the Arab-Is-
raeli problem. But both affect . 
the stability of the Middle East. 
Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy be-
tween Arab countries and Israel 
early this year brought about a 
separation of forces. All sides 
were ready, for a military cooling 
off period. Whether they are 
ready to make the concessions 
necessary for a permanent peace 
?on isSues like the future of the 
Palestinians on which the U.S. 
equivocates?remains to be seen. 
0 0 0 
But it is not just in these 
major areas where the claim of 
a successful Nixon foreign policy 
is subject to challenge. It is in 
all the rest of the world, espe-
cially among America's old al-
lies, where his policies and atti-
tudes have rendered dubious if 
not negative results. 
The last three White House 
tapes, which were made public 
on the eve of Nixon's departure 
in disgrace, revealed some 
shocking Nixon views on funda-
mental world problems. They 
contradicted the myth, perpe-
14 
trated for so long, that he was a 
man too busy with great world 
problems to be involved in Wa-
tergate. In the midst of a discus-
sion on Wa4.:Jrgate, however, Nix-
on's attention was called in June, 
1972, to serious international 
monetary developments, especial-
ly with respect to the British 
pound and the Italipn lira. 
On the new "floating rate" for 
the British pound which affected 
the value of the American dollar, . 
Nixon said:. "I don't care about ? 
it. Nothing we can do about it." 
And when told about grave 
worries with respect to specula-
tion in the Italian lira, Nixon's 
- shocking reply was: "I don't 
give a (expletive deleted) about , 
the lira." 
Once one moves away from 
Nixon "spectaculars" in foreign 
policy?detente- with Russia, - 
opening to China, extrication of 
American troops (but no peace) 
in Vietnam?the list of foreign 
policy matters which were bun-
gled or ignored by Nixon is . 
lengthy. 
Here are a few Issues on which 
any objective observer must give ,. 
Nixon low marks: 
? Western Europe and NATO. 
A year ago last June, Kissinger 
- proclaimed that Nixon was mak-, 
ing 1974 "the year of Europe." A 
new Atlantic Charter was to be 
devised, as though another piece? 
of paper setting forth general 
, principles would Solve complex 
problems. Unwisely, our Euro-
pean allies had not been con-
? sulted and the ill-conceived idea 
?fizzled. 
0. Japan. The "shocks" admin-
istered to this major Asian ally 
? are still felt. They included no 
advance warning about a new 
U.S. policy toward Peking and no 
warning on monetary and tariff 
changes that severely disrupted 
Japan's economy which was de-
pendent upon trade with the U.S. 
? Bangladesh. Nixon's now fa-
mous "tilt" toward Pakistan and 
against India in that tragic epi-
sode, while piously and falsely , 
proclaiming neutrality, was a 
disgrace to American foreign pol-
icy. 
? Middle East. Until forced to 
do so when it exploded last Octo-
ber. Nixon ignored the Arab-Is-
raeli problem. Only when the 
Arabs used their oil as a weapon 
that affected the U.S. directly, 
did Nixon focus upon the area 
?and then with total concentra-

? tion to the' detriment of other 
problems, such as Cyprus, which 
was right on the Arab-Israeli 
doorstep: 
Dictatorships. Unquestioning 
support of harsh and suppressive 
military dictatorships such as in 
Greece and South Korea has led 
to diplomatic disasters in the 
Greek area (With that part of 
NATO now in shambles) and 
portend potential ones in Korea 
where Stability is so dependent. 
? upon a reasonable working rela-
tionship between Japan and 
-Korea and respect and trust in 
both countries for the United 
States. 
* Nuclear weapons. Despite 
the tiny but hopeful start with 
the first SALT agreement with 
Russia -to limit nuclear weapons, 
the Nixon administration never 
succeeded in reaching a consen-
sus on the issue in its own 
country. President Ford inherits 
from Nixon a ieriout and funda-
mental dispute on nuclear policY 
between Kissinger and Defense 
Secretary James R. Schlesinger 
which should have been resolved, 
but wasn't, before Nixon went to 
Moscow in June. 
? International monetary af-
fairs. For several' years the daily 
financial pages of newspapers 
tell of the failures in this field, 
as in the correlative field of 
run-away domeStic inflation. 
When the old monetary system 
broke down, Nixon allowed nis 
former Treasury Secretary, John 
Connally, now indicted on 
charges of accepting a bribe, to 
try to bully our European part-
ners into a solution. When an 
interim agreement was reached,. 
Nixon, with typical over-state-
ment, proclaimed it the greatest 
agreement in the history of man-
kind. But just as there is no 
peace in Vietnam in spite of the 
, "peace is at hand" statement, 
there is no monetary stability in 
THE NEW YORK TIMES, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1974

The list could go on and on?. 
refusal to normalize relations, 
with Cuba, the tragedy of war 
brought by Nixon to Cambodia,. 
? failure to tackle world food,' 
energy and resources problems 
on a global scale, such follies as . 
the sale of most of our surplus 
grain to Russia at bargain prices 
and with American taxpayers' 
subsidies on the eve of zooming' 
prices and world shortages. 
? President Ford has proclaimed 
a new' era of openness and can, 
dor in all fields, including foreign 
affairs. It remains to be seen 
whether a man like Kissinger, 
whose one-man road show and. 
secret methods of operating fit-. 
ted Nixon's own proclivities so 
well, can perform for a man like, 
Gerald Ford, who, thus far, has 
displayed a forthrightness so in 
contrast to the duplicity as-
sociated with his* predecessor,' 
Richard Nixon. 
Mr. Shackford is a veteran 
Washington newspaperman. 
Ford's Foreign Problems and Prospects: 
The View From' Major- World Capitals 
In an address to a joint ses-
sion of Congress the week be-
fore last, President Ford said 
that he intended to continue 
the foreign policies of President 
Nixon. In the accompanying 
dispatches, correspondents of 
The New York Times report on 
how capitals around the world 
currently view their chief prob-
lems in relations with the 
United States. A dispatch from 
Washington gives the view of 
the* problems from there. . . 
? The Soviet Union 
Special to The New York Times 
MOSCOW?Despite a residue 
of goodwill left from President 
Nixon's three summit meetings, 
the Kremlin leaders will be 
pressing. President Ford on at 
least two issues that remain 
major stumbling blocks to bet-
ter Soviet-American relations. 
The more conspic_uous is 
trade, which in Soviet eyes has 
been stifled by the- unwilling-
ness of Congress to grant most-
favored-nation status and in-
vestment credits. 
If the Soviet Union views 
tariff -policy as a matter of 
prestige, given the relatively 
low volume of exports to the 
United States, the matter of 
'low-interest credits is of prac-
tical concern, for only with 
such credits, the Russians con-
tend, can they afford more 
,American technology. 
Consequently, Moscow is 
counting on Mr. Ford to help 
break the deadlock posed by 
Soviet restrictions on emigra-
tion, particularly by Jews, and 
deliver on the trade promises 
Mr. Nixon made to the Soviet 
leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
No Real Progress 
A still thornier prApprcive 
limitation of strategic nuclear 
weapons, on which nn real 
progress was made in talks 
this summer. As some,Western 
diplomats'viewed it, the Krem-
lin, nervous about Mr. Nixon's 
vulnerability on Watergate, was 
unwilling to offer concessions' 
that could be dissipated if he 
were swept out of office. 
Although President Ford is 
dealing from a position of 
greater strength, a problem as 
complex as the limitation of 
offensive arms will continue to 
resist simple solutions. Negoti-
ations at the recent meeting re-
portedly reached a deadlock 
over the number of missiles 
that the Soviet Union would be 
allowed to equip with multiple 
warheads. 
Moscow has also resisted 
American ptoposals that both 
sides - phase out their land-
based missiles, in which the 
Russians have numerical su-
periority. Instead, it has sought 
parity in multiple warheads 
while demanding that Washing-
ton halt its deployment of the 
Trident submarine-based mis-
sile and the B-1 strategic 
bomber. 
? 
Western Europe 
spedLI to The New York Times 
PARIS?The major Western 
European concerns about the 
United States involve econom-
ics and the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
The NATO issue stems from 
the Cyprus crisis and specula-
tion that Greece may ask the 
Sixth Fleet to withdraw from 
port facilities. This particularly' 
upsets Italy, where there is a 
strong current of opinion, 
mostly but not only on the left, 
against granting additional 
daVfoll?gd&t4.1561768/,b15 
The argument is that more 
bases would increase American 
"colonialism" and the tempta-
tion to interfere in Italian pol-
itics to prevent the Commu-
nists from being admitted to 
the Government. 
Other countries are also wor-
ried about NATO. France, 
which, like Greece, has with-
drawn her military forces from 
the alliance, is planning to bol-
ster over-all Western defenses 
in the Eastern Mediterranean 
outside it. 
? The economic issue is per-
haps more keenly felt by gov-
ernments at this point than by 
the general public. There is 
criticism that the United States 
fed worldwide inflation by al-
lowing a huge trade deficit to 
build the colossal Eurodollar 
supply, now estimated at $200-
billion. And there are fears that 
if the United States tries to 
fight inflation too vigorously, 
it will set off a general reces-
sion by constricting world 
trade. Bonn in particular has 
been critical of on-again, off-; 
again policies and is watching 
warily to see how President 
Ford will handle the problems. 
There is also concern about 
American talk of restricting 
agricultural exports since this 
would drive prices up, hurt 
European cattle raisers who 
rely on American feed grains 
and contribute to inflationary 
pressures. It is ironic that after 
15 years in which the major 
United States-Common Market 
dispute was American insist-
ence that Europe accept more 
agricultural exports, the issue 
now is fear of inadequate 
American exports. 
Eastern Europe 
cligaglahyggn 
long drama of Watergate the 
governments of Eastern Europe 
were especially concerned with 
the fate of PreSident. Nixon's 
trade bill, which has been held 
up in Congress. 
All would like to expand 
trade, but even more important, 
they seek access to financing 
through international agencies 
and banks available only to: 
those given .most-favored-rose 
tion status. 
All of Eastern Europe pre-
sumably welcomes d?nte, and 
there has been apprehension in 
some ,quarters that President 
Ford will not ? regard the issue 
as being as important as his 
predecessor_ did. 
All the countries of Eastern 
Europe have specific and some-
times highly emotional quarrels; 
with the United States. An 
example is Hungary, which has. 
been demanding the return of 
the golden crown of St. 
Stephen, founder of the Hun-1 
garian state during the Middle 
Ages. The crown, which came 
into American hands at the end 
of World War II, is still with-
held on the ground that Hun-
gary has shown little interest 
in being more friendly. ? 
Greece 
Special to The New York Times 
ATHENS ? Greek-American 
relations are dominated by the 
Cyprus issue and its widening 
ramifications. 
Athens is living with the hu-
miliating fact that it could not 
stop the Turkish invasion, and 
the Greeks are attributing most 
of the blame to Washington. 
Greece is used to blaming 
others for her troubles, and the 
more conspiratorial theories are 
00444#1rstantiated. But 
re feel they are 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100340008-2 
performing a Service by ahsorb-
ing criticism that otherwise 
might endanger the frail new 
civilian government of Premier 
'Constantine Caramanlis. 
Athens wants Washington to 
'exert more pressure on Ankara 
sto make significant concessions 
on Cyprus. Many of Greece's 
recent diplomatic moves?with-
drawal of troops from NATO, 
;acceptance of a Soviet proposal 
for a conference on Cyprus?
!were aimed mainly at the 
United States. 
A related 'issue, is the pres-
ence of important American 
military installations here. 
Greek officials keep threaten-
ing to close them?another 
move designed to make the 
United States use its influence 
with Turkey. 
President Nixon was long 
identified with support off the 
now-defunct military junta; 
President Ford has the distinct 
advantage of starting fresh 
with the new Government. But 
in Greek eyes America is main-
ly embodied by Secretary of 
State Kissinger, and he has 
become the archvillain of the 
piece because of Cyprus policy. 
.Turkey 
speem to The New York Times 
ANKARA, Turkey?The Turks 
feel that they are off to a good 
start with the? Ford Adminis-
ation on the Cyprus issue, 
but United States objections to 
the resumption of opium-poppy 
cultivation are a threat to good 
relations. 
Premier Bulent Ecevit says 
Turkey may be a more diffi-
cult ally in the future as she 
asserts a more independent 
position on controversial is-
sues. He also says there will 
the frankness on Turkey's side, 
;with all the cards on the table. 
In the case of Cyprus and 
the larger issue of Turkish-, 
Greek relations in the Aegean 
Sea, the feeling here is that 
the United States has reacted 
in a constructive way and 
shown appreciation for Tur-
key's point of view. 
In return, the Turks say they 
have kept fully win mind ? the 
ntereSts 
in NATO defense in the East-
ern Mediterranean and the 
preservation of detente with, 
the Soviet Union. 
The Middle East 
Special to The New York Times 
CAIRO?The United States, 
.under President Ford as underi 
his predecessor, holds the key! 
to Middle Eastern peace. Arab. 
leaders are in agreement on: 
Ithis point, but they differ On!, 
:how the Ford Administration!, 
,intends to use the key. 
President Anwar el-Sadat of; 
Egypt, in 'a series of speeches! 
reported by the press, has! 
strongly reaffirmed his belief,' 
that the October war imposedl 
a basic policy change on the: 
United States, Instead of con-
fining itself to unconditional 
support for Israel, he holds, it 
is now genuinely working for 
a permanent settlement ac-
ceptable to the Arabs. He has 
added in his statements that 
such a , settlement would have 
to include the return of all ter-g 
ritories occupied by Israel in 
I 1967. 
Mr. Sadat has also been 
Istressing the sorry state of the 
.economy and Egypt's depend. 
?ence on American, Western Eu-
ropean and Arab investment. 
At the other end of the 
scale are the Palestinian lead-
ers, including Yasir Arafat, 
who have been accusing Sec-
retary of State Kissinger of 
duplicity. As they see it, the 
United States is not interested 
in real peace?which, in their 
eyes, includes a Palestinian state 
?but siniply wants to sepa-
rate the Arab and Israeli ar-
mies and prevent a new war, 
prolonging the ?status quo and 
permitting Israel to keep most 
of the territories won in 1967, 
India 
Special to The New York Times 
NEW DELHI?India, once the 
largest recipient of American 
aid, is struggling to revive good 
relations with the United States 
after two years of bitterness 
and anger. 
From India's point of view 
the crux is American policy to-
ward Pakistan. As long as the 
United States maintains its 
arms embargo against Pakis-
tan, Indians say, relations will 
improve. They soured during 
the 1971 Bangladesh war, when 
the United States sided with 
Pakistan's unsuccessful effort 
to crush the autonomy move-
ment in East Pakistan,. now 
Bangladesh. 
India's interest in spurring 
better relations is based on two 
interlocking factors. 
One.is the realization among 
officials that India, in economic 
disarray, needs American as-
sistance. Discussions have taken 
place for a joint commission to 
strengthen economic, cultural 
and scientific ties. 
A second factor is the con-
cern here that India has become 
too dependent upon the Soviet 
Union and wants some balance 
in the form of closer relations 
with the United States. Indian 
officials say that the past pat-
tern of a donor-recipient rela-
tionship is being replaced by a 
more mature link involving 
trade and commercial ex-
changes. 
South Vietnam 
spedal to The New York Tproes 
SAIGON, South Vietnam?
After a decade of utter de-
pendence on American aid, the 
Government has refined the 
skill of Washington-watching 
into such an art that officials 
are somewhat jaded by the 
shifts in the Administration. 
As a result officials note with 
confidence President Ford's rec-
ord as a conservative and a 
hawk, and some even go so far 
as to suggest that he will be 
more beneficial to South Viet-
nam than was President Nixon 
because his relations with Con-
gress are more amicable. 
Congress has become the real 
source of worry for the Saigon 
Government these days, mainly 
due to sharp cuts in military 
aid voted in recent weeks. The 
Nixon Administration had asked 
for $1.45-billion for this fiscal 
year; both houses voted $700-
million. 
Cambodia 
Special to The New York Times ' 
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia ? 
The Government has always 
been worried that some day 
Washington might sharply re-
duce or withdraw its support?. 
which would almost certainly 
mean victory for' the Commu-
nist-led insurgents. This con-
cern has been heightened with 
:the advent of a President un-
known to the leaders, who are 
seeking assurances that he will 
be as. stanch in his backing as 
?was his predecessor. 
In the course of the four-.

Japan and Korea 
Special to The New York Timea. 
TOKYO ? In Japan the im-
mediate concern about the Ford 
Administration is that no one Ford, 
Administration
knows much about thei 
?new President. Equally impor-
tant from the point of view oft 
senior Japanese officials, Presi-
dent Ford doesn't know much 
1 
about Japan. 
This lack of a personal and 
political connection with Mr. 
Ford takes on special impor-
tance here since personal re-
lationships, even among na-
tional leaders, is vital in the 
Japanese scheme of things. 
Thus, Premier Kakuei Tana-
ka indicated, immediately aft-
er the new President took of-
ifce, that he wanted to go te 
,Washington to meet Mr. Ford. 
The meeting is now scheduled 
Ifor Sept. 21, while Mr. Tanaka 
is in the Western Hemisphere 
Ion a trip to Mexico, Brazil and 
Canada. 
I In addition, Mr. Ford is plan-
ning to visit Japan, probably 
between the November elections' 
I and Thanksgiving. If he does, 
he will be tho first President 
ever to have visited Japan, 
while in office. A planned stateI 
visit by President Eisenhower, 
in 1960 was cancelled because: 
of anti-American leftist riots. I 
The great policy issues of I 
the Nixon era have either been; 
res(olved ? Vietnam, trade,1

On China, Japanese policy is 
;basically working in the same; 
'direction as American policy,' 
only faster and unencumbered 
by security Considerations such 
as those arising from the 
United States's defense treaty 
with Taiwan. On security, the 
Japanese Left constantly tries 
to overturn Japan's alliance 
witlf the united States but is 
not making significant head-
way. 
Japan's conservative politi-
cians and businessmen are ex-
pected to use the occasion of 
the Ford visit to test him for 
isolationist And, protectionist at-
titudes, ati'cr to. try to dissuade 
hiin from such policies if they 
detect signs of them. 
Across the narrow Strait of 
Tsushima, the South Korean 
Government has started to, 
'worry about President Ford and' 
the United States commitment 
to Korean defense. Mr. Ford: 
recently issued a statement ex-
pressing concern over President 
Park Chung Hee's, jailing of 
Koreans for political reasons. 
In addition, Congress has in-
dicvted that it may cut military 
aid to Korea. Congressmen have 
criticized Korea's alleged dis-, 
regard for human rights and; 
prominent American scholars 
have called for a reduction in 
the 38,000 United States troops 
there. Some Christian leaders, 
seeing fellow Christians in 
Korea jailed. for their political 
beliefs, have protested to their 
Congressmen, although other 
American Christian leaders 
have &fended President Park's 
repressive policies. 
China 
HONG KONG ? The recent 
personal letter from Premier 
Chou En-lai to President Ford 
is believed to reflect China's 
desire. to establish good rela-
tions with the new Administra-
tion. And the visit to China by 
a bipartisan congressional dele-
gation led by Senator J. W. 
Fulbrighteis interpreted here as 
evidence that contacts begun 
during the Nixon Administra-
tion will-be maintained. 
From Peking's point of view 
at least, its main problem with 
-the United States remains the 
Taiwan issue, which "is thel 
crucial question obstructing the[ 
normalization of relations," mi 
the words of the 1972 com-
munique at the end of Mr.. 
Nixon's visit. 
Though the United States has; 
reduced its military presence 
in Taiwan, China was annoyed 
by the recent appointment of 
Leonard Unger as Ambassador 
in Taipei and by the opening 
of Chinese Nationalist consu-
lates in Atlanta, Kansas CityI

The Opium 
Of the. 
-S
eople 
..By C. L. Sulzberger 
? KONYA, Turkey?The opium of the 
people, in Turkey is not religion but 
politics or, put another way, opium 
is the 'politics of the people in terms 
of ''stn agitated argument with the 
Upited States that is not adequately 
understood by either side. 
Premier Bulent Ecevit assured me ; 
that.. "the Turkish Government' is not ! 
emotional on this but in the areas ' 
where it is grown, the entire peasant 
economy depends on the poppy. There-
fore the curb imposed in 1971 stirred 
up psychological reaction. Opium areas 
haye been reduced by natural process 
from 42 to seven provinces and will 
be. reduced further as new livelihoods _ 
appear. We will do what we can to ' 
control illegal traffic but world medi-
cine needs more or less, opium." - 
Poppy growers depend not only on' 
the sap from which the drug derives 
but also on flour, fuel and oil ex-
tiacted from the plant. And the 
Anatolian peasant is sometimes at 
the ,lowest subsistence level. Prof. 
Ragip Uner, an expert, says: 
'Turkey there are still people who live 
in caves and burn oil lamps." 
The United States pledged $35 mil-
lion three years ago when a ban was, 
.annOunced by Turkey in accord with 
Washington. Nevertheless, the govern-
`ment of Konya Province, which now 
resumes cultivation on a small scale, 
-says the money was slow in reaching 
-actual growers. Substitute crops 
Weren't swiftly introduced and peas-
-ants found themselves idle. This be-
:Came a psychological problem. 
? The Turks make surprisingly little 
-out of opium. Between 1967 and 1971 
the, annual crop ranged between 120 
and 350 metric tons. (It takes ten 
metric tons of opium to make one 
metric ton of heroin.) The grower here 
was getting perhaps $75 a kilogram 
for raw opium gum and now might 
receive roughly, $200. But the retail 
price of heroin, smuggled Out of this 
country, processed, then sold in New 
York, is about $400,000 a kilogram. 
It isn't the farmer who got the vast 
differential, but the crook. The moons 
shining peasant holds back a minor 
share of his crop from the Government 
purchasing agency, sells it to a local 
bootlegger who sneaks it along to 
refiner i and transpotters elsewhere. 
Althbugh this country grows far fewer 
poppies than India, it is said 80 per 
cent 'of U.S. heroin derives from 
Turkish gum. ? 
On June 30, 1971, Premier Nihat 
Erim ? (whose Government -was put in 
by the military) prohibited opium. 
production. He said: "Illicit traffic 
from our country has become very 
distressing"; Turkey had been "unable 
tio prevent smuggling"; and "we can-
not allow Turkey's supreme interests 
and the prestige of our nation to be 
further' shaken." ? 
- But-politics got into the-question 
as full democracy returned. The 
minority Ecevit Government is based 
on a coalition. The vote of the poppy 
giowers was needed and all parties 
courted it. Were an election to be 
held now, in the. wake of the Cyprus 
landing, Mr. Ecevit would win by a 
landslide. But the ban was rescinded 
July I, just before Cyprus exploded. 
? Politicians argued that farmers were 
being oppressed, that there was a 
world, shortage of medicinal opium, 
that the U.S. was turning to India as 
a source, that anyway America had 
no tight to boss Turkey. Professor . 
Uner writes: "No other country has 
any right to dictate what ,we have to 
cultivate or not-to cultivate." But he 
acknowledges that Turkish opinion. 
doesn't realize the "hysteria" in the 
United States prompted by drug addic-
tion. ? 
American politics is also involved.. 
The -United States Congress, influ-
enced by exaggerated statistics, felt 
its own Government wasn't doing 
enough. To propitiate Congress, 
American Ambassador Macomber was 
withdrawn from Ankara right after 
the restoration of poppy-farming. Mr. 
Macomber had to fly back out of the 
opium frying pan into the Cyprus fire. 
? There has been inadequate under-
standing on both sides. Americans 
cannot, grasp the misery of impover-
ished ?poppy farmers?or the signifi-
cance ,of their vote. Turks cannot 
even imagine the horrors of mass 
addiction among American youth. It 
is ce,rtainly imperative that smuggling 
here- (which Mr. Erin i admitted was 
"impossible to prevent") be curbed 
and that the criminal chain from 
farmer to addict be broken. 
But it would be well for both na-
tions to remember the tolerance of 
Mevlana, a thirteenth-century phi-
losopher-poet who founded the whirl-
ing dervish order here and counseled 
,the fanatical medieval world: "Our 
center is itot one of despair. Even if 
you. have violated your VOWS a hun-
dred times, come again." The word 
"try" should be substituted for "come."

ishful 
Coexistence' 
The ,Kremlin is developing a blind 
spot where President Ford is con-
cerned, much like the blind spot that 
caused it to miss the real significance 
of Watergate. 
Because Moscow was committed to 
Mr. Nixon and saw him as the embodi-
ment of detente, it wanted him to stay. 
in power and refused to believe that 
he might have to go. In Mr. ? Ford's 
case, the same kind of wishful thinking 
in the Kremlin is causing the Soviet 
press to play down the sharp edge 
which shows every now and again In 
the new administration's pronounce-
ments about the need for big defense. 
buildups and major expenditure on.. 
them. 
The Soviet press mildly remarked, 
with some delay, on Ford's "regret-
table inaccuracy" in saying that the' 
Soviet Union had naval bases in the 
Indian Ocean, but all the emphasis in 
Moscow is on Ford's coininitment to 
Nixon's 'detente policy; on the con-
tinuity represented by 'Kissinger's con-
trol of foreign policy. Pravda observes 
with delight that Ford sees Kissinger 
first thing every morning, while such 
hawks as Defense Secretary James 
Schlesinger and CIA Director William 
Colby ,have to await a summons. 
It is not naivete that causes Mos-
cow to see only what it wants to see in 
Ford, but a deliberate tactic. There 
was a time when MoWcow assumed 
that the "imperialists" always had the 
worst intentions and, in preparing to 
Counter them, it brought on the very 
actions it feared. So,.for that matter, 
did the West bring out the worst in? 
Moscow. Now, by ascribing only good 
intentions to Ford, by granting him 
the presumption of innocence, the 
Kremlin is trying to make the wish the

rather to the thought which begets the 
action. It is all part of the new pattern . 
4-1' what is wrongly described as peace-
ful coexistence. Wishful coexistence 
would be a better term. Do unto others. 
aa you would have them do unto you?' 
and they will respond accordingly. 
But there is another aspect of for--
eign policy making in Washington to 
which Moscow has drawn attention: 
from time to time?the . "zigzags" 
? which make the. White House veer this 
way and that, blow hot and cold on de-
tente, usually for reasons of domestic 
politics which have little or nothing to 
do with foreign policy. The Moscow 
theory has it that the Zigzags, often 
,due to electoral considerations,. will 
make a President,take? a harsher 
?. 
.stance toaVard the. oviet Union than 
he might otherwise wish. 
'Those who take the zigzag view Of 
presidential motivation have warned in 
the past that the Kremlin cannot. just 
take a new wave of harshness lying 
down, that it must respond accord-
ingly, and that the mutual buildup of 
suspicion and' hostility Could play 
havoc with detente. The Soviet practi-
tioners of wishful coexistence have 
now banished any such forebodings 
from the pages of Pravda. But this 
does not mean that Moscow's zigzag 
school of thought has been banished to 
Siberia?only that its spokesmen, tem-
porarily tint of favor, have been told to 
keep quiet. 
If Moscow's surface view of the Ford 
-presidency could be stripped away, it 
would probably disclose .a tangle of 
contradictions and fears about the fu-
ture far more intense than the simple-
minded confidence it presents in pub-
lic. An attempt to reconstruct what is.
PRAISES 
FORD LEADERSHIP 
---------
Pravda Gives Assessment 
of His First 2 Weeks 
Swis.1 to The New York Times 
MOSCOW, .Aug. 22 ? The 
Communist party newspaper 
Pravda today made an optimis-
tic assessment of President 
Ford's first two weeks in office, 
suggesting that initial Soviet 
nervousness over Mr. Nixon's 
sudden departure was rapidly 
bei ng assuaged. 
.Pravda noted that Mr. rad 
was hard at 'work to solve the' 
problem ofinflation, which, the 
newspaper said, had reached 
"catastrophic magnitude" un-
der Mr. Nixon. 
While the te- has been no hesi-
tancy about focusing on Ameri-
can problems, the Soviet press 
had been careful not to link the 
former .PresidVnt with them by 
name. I 
But. today's article indicated 
that the immunity from criti-
cism ? that Mr. Nixon had en-
joyed by virtue of his relation-
ship with the Soviet leader, 
Leonid I. Brezhnev, had been 
pragmatically set aside, al-
though the Soviet press has still 
not released the full details .of 
the Watergate affair. 
The article, which was writ-
ten by Pravda's Washington 
underneath, based on past patterns of 
Kremlin thought and of Kremlinologi-
cal evidence, would reveal the uncer-
tainty about Ford which is glossed 
oveg by the press. 
The Kremlin presumably knows as 
well as most of us how unpredictable 
the vagaries of the American electoral 
process are. But it has to draw up for-
eign policy plans for the future, and it 
.has to make certain assumptions about 
it. One scenario obviously favored by 
at least some people in Moscow is a 
1976 election fight between what the 
Soviet press represents as the forces of 
darkness and evil, led by Sen. Henry 
Jackson (D-Wash.), and what must inev-
itably appear against this somber back-
ground as the forces of light, led by 
President Ford. 
This in 'itself would provide Moscow 
with very good reasons to give Mr. 
Ford the benefit of any doubts it 
might have, as the Soviet press is now 
doing. But as Watergate must have 
taught Moscow, the straight projection 
of U.S. trends into the future is a 
thankless task, and some of its experts ? 
must now be busy drawing up alterna-
tive scenarios. 
Moscow would obviously want to 
help Ford against Jackson, and this is 
something that Kissinger could use to 
good advantage in the negotiations 
that lie ahead. But some Soviet leaders 
feel that Brezhnev has already made 
too many concessions to Nixon in the 
past three summits, and that it is high 
time the White House started paying 
back. The coming negotiations could 
be tougher than any in the past. 
? 1974, Victor Zona 
cOrrespohdent, Boris Strelni-
kov, painted a cautiously bright. 
future for Soviet-American re-
lations under President Ford, 
with an allusion to the trade 
legislation pending in Congress. 
In assessing President Ford's 
first days in office, Pravda said 
he was trying "to raise at least 
some barriers in the way of in-
flation which began under the 
Kennedy Administration, inten-
sified during Johnson's rule, 
and assumed catastrophic mag-
nitude under Nixon." 
While saving that Mr. Ford 
was spending "nearly half" his 
time on the inflation problem, 
the newspaper also stressed 
that he was devoting "much 
time" to foreign affairs.

is esse tial to 
ei!e te 00. 
"Twenty-two years ago on a warm 
August night, Soviet secret police agents 
executed 24 Jewish writers, poets, ac-
tors. and intellectuals in the basement of 
Moscow's notorious Lubyanka Prison. At 
that moment,. Joseph Stalin's drive to 
eradicate Jewish life and culture from 
the Soviet Union attained its ugliest 
expression through ultimate terror. 
' To this day, the Kremlin has main-
tained its original death sentence on 
Jewish identification and tradition, even 
if it has ceased executing Jews outright. 
And yet, Jewish cultural identification 
and ethnic consciousness flourish today 
in the Soviet Union, although much of 
their expression is private and relegated 
to the underground. Jews study Jewish 
history, read Jewish literature, write, 
paint, dance and compose in a Jewish 
idiom even when prohibited. They study 
the Hebrew language in secret classes, 
because the study of Hebrew is .specifi-
cally proscribed. 
-"A new generation of Jews bound to 
their tradition has evolved in the Soviet 
Union, a generation steadfast in its will 
te-survive and motivated actually by the 
oppressive atmosphere created by the 
Soviet government. And yet, survival 
there. as a Jewish community has be-
come almost an unbearable effort. 
" Thus, since 1971 the struggle for Jew-
ish rights in the Soviet Union has be-
come synonymous with the principle of 
free emigration. The only alternative for 
many identifying Jews is to go to ,a 
place where they can give full and 
complete expression to their Jewishness. 
As a result, attention has inevitably 
focused in the United States on the 
Trade Reform Act of 1973, Section 402, 
commonly known as the Jackson 
amendment, which denies credits and 
most-favored-nation status to any nation 
with a restrictive emigration policy. 
. Opponents of the Jackson amendment 
believe it would drastically interfere 
with the growing U.S.-Soviet detente. Its 
supporters, on the other hand, have felt 
that a viable, meaningful detente prov-
ides for the accrual of benefits for both 
sides. Unilateral concessions?in this 
case billions of dollars in foreign trade 
to.. the Soviet Union with nothing in 
return?cannot achieve an authentic de-
tente. 
,While it is true that Jewish emigration 
geeatly increased rrom the Soviet Union 
in 1972 and 1973, the decline of those 
permitted to leave this year demon-
strates what can occur when emigration 
Is not free despite the mutually pro-
fessed spirit of detente. In 1972 and 1973, 
almost 33,000 Jews each year were 
Mr. Fruchtman is executive director of 
the Baltimore Committee for Soviet 
Jewry, a standing coinmittee of the 
granted exit visas. To date in 1974, that 
number has declined about 35 per cent. 
At the current rate, no more than 22,000 
will be allowed to leave by the end of. 
this year. 
Moreover, since Soviet officials have 
arbitrarily chosen who shall go and who 
shall stay, most of those recently 
granted visas have cbme from the So-
viet heartland, not from the major 
urban areas. They are less educated and 
less professionally trained than their 
more sophisticated urban brethren. ? 
In recent testimony before the Senate 
Foreign Relations subcommittee on mul. 
tinational corporations, Professor Zbige 
niew Brzezinski of Columbia University 
spoke of two kinds of detente. He distin-
guished the rather comprehensive Amer-
ican view from the more narrow Soviet 
idea based on a continuing ideological 
struggle with the West. The Soviet view 
of detente is limited and expedient to 
the extent that it is aimed solely toward 
the achievement of tangible economid 
benefits. 
By contrast, Mr. Drzezinski said, the 
broader American view is not "artifi-
cially compaetmentalized to economics 
alone." Included in this genuine version. 
of detente is a possible social, political 
and cultural accommodation which 
could lead to closer social links between 
the two great nations. , 
The American view would have, ac-
cording to Mr. Brzezinski, an obvious 
impact on the current Soviet refusal to 
permit free emigration. Indeed, part of 
this vision of detente lies within the 
realm of the basic human right to leave 
one's country. Free emigration would 
precipitate no changes in the Soviet. 
sociopolitical system. 
The Jackson amendment is a means 
toward the attainment of this broader 
view of detente. Professor Brzezinski. 
stressed that the denial of free emigra-
tion is not an internal Soviet domestic 
matter, even if many Americans have a 
direct and highly personalized concern 
for those in the Soviet Union who want 
to leave. Deploring the possibility that 
the right of free emigration would not 
be included in the detente agenda, Mr. 
Brzezinski concluded that "given this 
country's traditions, the adoption of a 
posture of amorality Is to give up 
something very precious, something 
which should not be given up lightly." 
It is important to recall that the 
United States has on several occasions 
displayed concern for oppressed minori-
ties abroad. Throughout the past century 
alone, there have been both congres-
sional and presidential initiatives on 
behalf of Russian Jewish rights. Presi-
dent William Howard Taft in December, 
1911, abrogated a commercial treaty with 
Russia, for example, under pressure 
from public opinion and a unanimous 
'Congress after reports of mistreatment 
Moreover, the right and opportunity to 
emigrate is a transnational concept, 
pointedly expressed in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and gener-
ally recognized in international law_ The 
Soviet Union, as a signator of the Uni-
versal Declaration as well as of the 
International Convention on the Elimina-
tion of All Forms of Racial Discrimina-
tion, has violated the provisions in these 
documents which specify the right to-
leave one's country. 
There are, therefore; both an accepted 
norm embodied in international conven-
tions which encourages transnational 
concern for the right of free emigration 
and a long American tradition of tangi-
ble action on behalf of human rights 
through the exercise of American di-
plomatic and economic influence. 
Thus, a rationale exists for the,Jack-
son amendment which may not have 
been made clear to the American_ pece? 
ple. Support of the Jackson amendment. 
need not mean that one has. to be 
opposed to detente, but support -of -a 
broad, meaningful detente would logi-
cally require support of the amendment'. 
It is through the implementation. of 
the-right of free emigration, then, that 
Soviet Jews hope to act out their Jewish 
consciousness. Those 24 poets and intel-
lectuals murdered in 1952 represented 
the leadership of Jewish thought -arid 
letters, and they posed a major threat-to 
the Stalinist goal of liquidating Jess* 
culture. The murder of the 24 -wasee 
result of Stalin's creation of a JeWsiSh 
Anti-Fascist Committee in 1942 When a-
number of Jewish intellectuals,'ali-df 
whom regarded themselves as .Soviet 
patriots, were recruited to generate. watt. 
time support by Jews in the West for 
the Soviet struggle against Nazi f.lere 
many: 
Little did these Soviet emissarieLsug-
pect Soviet duplicity. On its return after 
the war, - when its services were no 
longer needed, the committee was dis-
banded, and all its members arrested.

Sea po or: U.S. vs. U.S.S.R. 
By Richard Burt 
Special to The Christi= Science Monitor 
London 
The publication this week of the 1974-75 edition of Jane's Fighting 
Ships has revived the lively but complex debate over the relative 
strengths of the U.S. and Soviet navies. 
Echoing the repeated claims of former U.S. Chief of Naval 
Operations Elmo Zumwalt, the editors of Jane's stab:, that the Soviet 
Union has achieved substantial supremacy in a variety of areas of 
nava/ weaponry, and has begun to challen the United States in 
others. 
Writing that the U.S. Navy is "in the van of navies subjected to 
misinformed, illogical, and irrational attacks by those who depend 
upon it most," the editors said that the Soviet Navy enjoys a major 
numerical edge in submarines anti heavy cruisers and "leads the 
world in aeaborne missile armament, both strategic and tactical, both 
ship and submarine-launched." 
In the strategic area, the Soviets have launched over 60 ballistic 
missile submarines, including the new Delta-class boat which is 
capable of launching 12 misolles with a range of 4,600 miles. With this 
range, te editors note 12110 the Delta-class subs will be able to strike 
targets in the United Statee from protected waters near Soviet shores. 
The United States now possesses 41 missile-launching submarines 
with 3,860-Mile ran missiles. The first of 10 new Trident submarines 
equipped with resege missiles will not be ready until 1678-79. 
In the tactical area, the Soviet Union is given a major lead in cruise 
missile's, a technology area that U.S. officials admit has not been fully 
exploited by the Navy. Deployed abeard both submarines and surface 
verseelo, the Soviet missiles are at present viewed as the primary 
throat to ts Ill.g. merrier force. 
The Soviet Navy is also given high 
marks in surface vessels, where Its 
fleet of cruisers outnumber the U.S. 
firce 34 to 6. Included in this figure are 
the Soviet Navy's new Kara and 
Kresta-class ships, which are de-
scribed as the fastest and most heav-
ily armed heavy combatants in the 
world. 
One of the few areas in the surface 
vessel category where the editors still 
give the U.S. Navy a clear lead is 
aircraft carriers, where the present 
force of 14 stands unchallenged. How-
ever, they warn, with one carrier now 
,undergoing sea trials and another 
being constructed, the Soviets could 
challenge U.S. carrier supremacy in 
the 1980's. 
Few naval analysts doubt the edi-
tors claim that the Soviet fleet "is a 
very powerful fighting force." But 
numerous experts emphasize the dif-
ficulty of comparing the two forces. 
Thus, while the Soviet Navy enjoys 
an advantage in number of ships, U.S. 
naval vessel, on the average, tend to 
be larger and more capable. In fact, it 
Is estimated that the total tonnage of 
U.S. naval vessels is twice that of the 
Soviet fleet. 
In terms of individual vessels, the 
U.S. Navy is also generally given an 
edge. While the Soviets have deployed 
sophisticated ships such as the Kara-
class cruisers, most U.S. vessels are 
believed to be three to four times 
more effective then their Soviet coun-
terparts, possessing greater endur-
ance and flexibility. 
Analysts also note an important 
difference between how the two fleets 
are deployed. Possessing a true "blue 
water" capability the U.S. Navy con-
tinuously deploys large forces 
throughout the world and possesses a 
wealth of experience in maintaining 
ships at sea for long periods of time. 
Defensive force 
Despite Soviet forays into the South 
Atlantic and naval visits to Africa and 
South America, analysts argue that 
the Soviet Navy has yet to master a 
strategy of "forward naval deploy-
ment" and is still viewed by the 
Kremlin as a defensive force to 
?protect the Soviet homeland from 
attack. 
The U.S. Navy and its supporters, 
however, have seized on these deploy-
ment differences to argue that U.S. 
forces must possess superiority over 
the Soviet Fleet. While the United 
States, they argue, must maintain the 
freedom of the seas to ensure a secure 
supply of strategic commodities or to 
project force in areas such as the 
Middle East, .the Soviet Union only 
needs to disrupt the sea lanes to 
achieve its objectives. 
This view was recently questioned 
by Michael McGwire, a retired Royal

How t Lose an Ally. 
By Graham Hovey 
Secretary of State Kissinger still 
seems oblivious to the dimensions of 
the disaster sustained by United States 
foreign policy in the Cyprus tragedy 
and insensitive to the hurt of people 
who feel let down by Washington. 
How else explain his ill-timed offer 
to mediate the Cyprus crisis and his 
bland invitation to a harried Greek 
Premier to come to Washington to 
talk things over?at a time when Tur-
key was grabbing the northern third 
of Cyprus and drawing only a wrist 
tap from the State Department? 
Did Mr. Kissinger really believe that 
Greece's Premier Caramanlis or For-
eign Minister Mavros could accept a 
summons to Washington at that point 
and survive? As former United States 
Under. Secretary of State George Ball 
said, the Kissinger mediation offer in 
that context exhibited "an insensi-
tivity beyond belief." 
And at whom was Mr. Kissinger 
aiming his warning of last week that 
"a foreign government must not ex-
.pect that every time there is a crisis, 
the Secretary of State will come rush-
ing. into the area and spend all his 
time settling that particular crisis?" 
Was anyone asking for what he 
grandly calls "the personal shuttle 
diplomacy of the Secretary of State"? 
Mr. Kissinger did promise that in 
any negotiation, Washington would 
"take into full account Greek honor 
and dignity," but he felt it necessary 
to add a warning that this country 
would "not be pressured by .threat of 
withdrawal from the. [NATO] alliance" 
nor by unjustified anti-American 
.demonstrations. . 
7. But the Secretary surely. misreads 
LOS ANGELES TIMES 
23 August 1974 
the political signals from Athens if he 
regards the pullout of Greek forces 
from NATO and the anti-American 
demonstrations merely as ploys by the 
Caramanlis Government, rather than 
reflections of utter disillusionment 
with an alliance and a superpower ally 
that could not prevent Turkey's blitz 
and Greece's humiliation on Cyprus. 
In fact, Mr. Kissinger's trouble from 
the onset of the Cyprus crisis has been 
a lack, in dealing with allies, of the 
sensitivity that was an ingredient of 
his success in the Middle East and 
Vietnam negotiations, as well as in the 
initiatives that led to President Nixon' 
visits' to China and the Soviet Union. 
The United States is not omnipotent 
and, as Mr. Kissinger reminds us, can-
not stop "every local war between 
smaller nations." No one can prove. 
that any feasible Washington effort 
this time would have halted Turkey's 
invasion of Cyprus. ? 
' One is forced to recall, however, 
that President Johnson twice got Tur-
key to call off a scheduled invasion Of 
Cyprus: in 1964, with a tough letter to 
Premier Inonu; in 1967, through a 
skillful, even-handed negotiating job 
by envoy Cyrus Vance. 
Once a shaky military regime in 
Athens had staged a putsch against 
President Makarios, clearly aimed at 
enosis? the union of Cyprus with 
Greece?there was only one way to 
prevent Turkish intervention: to dem-
onstrate that Geeece would not be 
allowed to get by with it. Washington 
could have made the point by backing 
Britain in refusing to recognize the 
new Cyprus regime and in demanding 
that Athens recall .the Greek officers 
wko had directed the coup. 
Instead, the United States gave Tur-
key and the world every reason to 
believe it accepted the coup. Washing-
ton refused to pin responsibility for it 
on the `Greek dictatorship and even 
hinted that on Cyprus it preferred the 
swaggering murderer, Nikos Sampson, 
to the devious Makarios. 
Turkey's initial Invasion of July 20'? 
was the inevitable result. This at leaA 
accomplished the salutary secondary 
results of blasting out of power both 
Sampson and the Athens junta. At that 
point the imperative was to persuade 
Turkey to go no further. 
Ankara had made its point: it would 
not accept enosis and it' intended at 
any cost to protect the Turkish 
Cypriote minority. The ? Turks could 
now negotiate from strength. They. 
could expect American and British 
backing for constitutional revisions to 
give the Turkish Cypriotes a large 
measure of autonomy.' 
But the invasion had been heady 
wine for .Turkey and Washington 
again seemed to blow a timid trumpet. 
At -the showdown in Geneva, Turkey ' 
presented a-drastic plan for division of 
Cyprus as ah ultimatum, refusing to 
give the Greeks and Greek Cypriotes 
even a 36-hour reeess to concult. 
Turkey's blitz killed hundreds, dis-
placed some 200,000, sowed new seeds 
for protracted intercommunity strife, 
provoked Greece into pulling its forces 
out of NATO, and inereased instability 
in the eastern Mediterranean and the 
Middle East. It also dealt a heavy blow 
at United States credibility and the 
reputation of Henry A. Kissinger. 
More's the pity that he seems not to 
understand why.

The Risk of America's Role as a orld Umpire 
BY MAX LERNER 
NEW YORK CITY?In years ahead 
there will be other outbursts of anti-Amer-
icanism around the world, like the one in 
Nicosia where American Ambassador 
Rodger P. Davies was cut down by gunfire 
in a confused mob attack on the embassy. 
Americans have become the inevitable tar-
gets for national and sectarian rages the . 
world over. To be an American envoy in a 
world trouble area?let us face it?is to 
hold down one of the high-risk jobs of our 
time.

,? The anti-Americanism in The world to-
day differs sharply from that of the '40s 
through the '60s. It is not a decadent and 
-?-scorned American capitalism that is at-
tacked, as in the '40s, nor the American 
"cold war Mentality," as in the '50s, nor the 
? imperialist interventions in insurgent situa-
tions, as in the '60s. 
_ When the new anti-Americanism is not 
directed against the multinational corpora-
tions or the CIA?the two still favorite 
? targets?it is directed against America as 
the arbiter of the world's quarrels. 
That is part of the price America will 
have to pay for the Kissinger era in diplo-
macy and for the world image which Kis-

in his shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East.

"Kill the intervener" or "Kill the cold warri-
ors" or "Kill the fascist imperialists." But 
how did the United States become such a

umpiring. Only the United States is left to 
function, well or badly, in this vacuum. - 
In a way it is a form of left-handed trib--1 
ute, both to Kissinger and to the United 
States, to declaim and protest against their 
role. It implies that they have more power 
than the facts probably warrant, and that:, 
the arbitrating role is actually theirs, even 
if wrongly used. 
Kissinger has explicitly offered his medi-:-. 
ation efforts to the Greeks and Turks. But 
it would be a dangerous mistake to believe, 
whether abroad or in the UniLed States,. 
that America must right every wrong, re-
dress every grievance, heal every injury, 
balance out every inequality that occurs M 
the world. 
It was stupid for America to try to hi 
the world's policeman. It is dangerous to 
try to be the world's umpire. 
It is absurd. Yet for the moment there is 
no one and nothing else to fill the role.

Rowland Evans and Robert Novak 
eek Military Scandal 
Blatant misuse of American military 
aid by the ousted Greek military dicta-
torship, which probably caused the 
junta's fatal inaction in the Cyprus cri-
sis, is about to be exposed in a major 
international scandal?threatening the 
permanent end of U.S. military aid to 
Greece and widening the dangerous 
Washington-Athens breach. 
This scandal, a closely-held secret 
within the new civilian government of 
Prime Minister Constantine Karaman-
lis (which had nothing whatever to do 
with it) may help explain the sudden ? 
collapse of the military junta following 
Turkey's invasion of Cyprus. Turkey's 
move was triggered by the Greek jun-
ta's overthrow of Archbishop Makarios 
as President of Cyprus on July 15. 
Karamanlis and his top aides, includ-
ing Foreign Minister George Mavros, 
are convinced the junta was preparing 
military operations across the Turkish 
border in Thrace immediately follow-
ing Turkey's decision to intervene mili-
tarily on Cyprus But when the junta 
mobilized the Greek reserves, military 
stores of U.S. aid?rifles, ammunition, 
boets, machine guns and rockets?
were discovered to be totally inade-
quate. Crates of the American M-16 ri-
fle, for one example, were found to 
contain one or two layers of rifles on 
the top, with rocks, wood and other fil-
ler material hidden underneath. 
The discovery of this shocking short-
fall of arms and equipment was the fi-
nal nail in the coffin of the junta, al-
ready under heavy political pressure 
for its .stumbling Cyprus adventure. 
The full extent of the disappearance 
of American arms aid is still not 
known. Some well-informed experts on 
the outrages perpetrated , by seven 
years of Greek military rule believe 
that arms were sold for cash to foreign 
countries, possible black Africa, be-. 
hied the' backs of regular military com-
manders. 
.But wholly apart from the devastat-
ing impact on the junta itself, the dis-
covery of the shortfall raises profound 
questions about Greece's military de-
fenses in her role as a member of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO). Karamanlis, pressured by the 
Turkish Cyprus invasion into an anti-
American posture, withdrew Greece 
from ,:he military arm of NATO two 
weeks ago. 
High officials here are unaware of 
the Karamanlis-Mayros- investigation 
which revealed the junta's inability to 
mobilize the Greek reserve. That in-
vestigation is now centered on three 
major military depots: Attica, the site 
in the Athens-Piraeus area of major 
Greek military installations; Larissa, 
in central Greece, the headquarters of 
the First Army; and Salonika, Greece's 
second city and the headquarters of 
the Third Army corps. 
Although administration officials are 
in the dark, key members of four con-
gressional committees?the Foreign 
Relations and Armed Services commit-
tees of both Senate and House?have 
been apprised of the scandal by Elias 
Demetracopoulos, the best-informed 
anti-junta Greek exile here the past 
seven years. He recently returned to 
Washington from high-level talks in 
Geneva with officials of the Karaman-
lis eovernment. 
Key congressional committee meni-
hers, including one senator who sup-
ported U S. military aid to Greece 
even during the military dictatorship, 
will soon demand a Complete investiga-
tion by the General Accounting Office 
(GAO), congressional .watchdog over 
government spending. 
The results of that probe Could be: 
dynamite. In 1971, Rep. Wayne Hays of.; 
Ohio pushed through 'Congress a ban,' 
on U.S. military grant- aid to Greece: 
Only last week Hays authored a bill to, 
repeal that ban, on grounds that grant 
aid could be restored now that the 
colonels were gone. 
But if the GAO probe shows that 
there really was wholesale abuse of 
American military aid, Congress will 
be most reluctant about new grant aid 
even to the respected civilian govern-
ment of Karamanlis. - 
Even without the scandal, restora-
tion of aid seems dubious considering - 
the fact that Karamanlis bowed to 
anti-American sentiment by withdraw- ? 
ing Iron NATO's military organization 
and accepting Moscow's formula for a ' 
political settlement on Cyprus. . 
The impact of a finding by GAO that 
lame amounts of American aid were . 
pilfered or squandered would go far-
beyond Greece. It would radically ad-
vance the argument against foreign 
aid that is widespread in Congress and 
fanned by neo-isolationalism. In this 
way too, the chickens of obsequious 
U.S. support for a clique of mimitive 
G rock colonels are coming home to 
roost with a vengeance.

Intervention Arm 
Greek democrats have long complained that 
the Central Intelligence Agency was pulling 
the strings of the so-called colonel's' dictator-
ship, before the military government was re-
placed recently. State Department officials 
have now confirmed that CIA agents subsi-
dized politicians and bought votes in Parlia-
ment. The CIA, and not U.S. Ambassador Hen-
ry Tasca, dalt directly with the Greek junta's 
strong man, Brig. Gen. Dimitrios loannidis, 
who ran the secret police. 
? Perhaps ;the State Department officials put 
out this information because they disliked 
being bypassed by the CIA, or because the 
department now wishes to repudiate complici-
ty in the former dictatorship. The fact is that 
the American Government supported and ma-
nipulated the .Greek military government 
through the CIA, as if has used the CIA to 
support secure right-wing regimes in other 
countries. And the Greek experience, like the 
Bay of Pigs, proved a disaster. 
In 1963 former President Truman wrote, "I 
never had any thought that when I set up the 
CIA it would be injected into peacetime cloak-
and-dagger operations." It was supposed to be

an intelligence-gathering agency. The work of 
intelligence can only be compromised by inter-
ventionist activities that have,: to be justified 
through the intelligence arm: 
Still, the basic question is whether the Unit-
ed States should meddle in foreign govern-
ments, particularly in support of oppressive 
governments, in ways that are kept more se-
cret from the American people than from for-
eign peoples who are victimized by the inter-
vention. In Greece the CIA carried out a form 
of foreign policy that the State Department 
could not afford to acknowledge. ? ? 
Despite frequent revelations of CIA paramil-
itary and political projects, usually after fail-
ures, Congress has done little to bring the 
agency into some form of public scrutiny and 
responsibility. The joint special CIA Oversight 
Committee itself led the Senate rejection last 
June of Senator Proxmire's proposal to make 
the CIA disclose the total amount of money it ! 
spends. So far congressional oversight has 
simply meant congressional approval. In view 
of the Greek exposure, how much longer will 
Congress wait, to bring the CIA to reasonable . 
'account? 
he FlOtSarri Of the Storm 
? By C. L. Sulzberger ? 
SPETSAIS, Greece?Right after an-
nouncing withdrawal of Greek armed 
forces from NATO, Premier Caraman ? 
lis overhauled the command of those 
forces, firing all top leaders associ-
ated with the previous junta and with. 
the boomerang Cyprus coup that 
touched off Turkey's invasion. The odd 
thing is that the men now named 
to command have all been pro-NATO 
enthusiasts. 
It will take months before Athens 
unscrambles its idea on relations with 
the Western alliance. So far it merely 
says it will emulate France, which 
pulled out troops but retained politi-
tal membership. Greek studies claim 
General de Gaulle's experts analyzed 
the French-NATO problem four months 
before he moved?then gave the allies 
a year to evacuate, if that's an indica-
tion, it will be Christmas 1975 before 
anything irrevocable happens. 
Neither the United States nor NATO 
earned any consistent kudos from 
Turkey or Greece during the Cyprus 
confrontation. Turkish Premier Ecevit 
initially told me it would be "difficult" 
for Turkey to continue in the alliance 
if Greek-Turkish problems weren't 
first solved. Later he thought Turkey 
could "fill up the gap" created by 
Greece's withdrawal. 
Washington warned Greece and Tur-
key that they would be cut off from 
American arms supplies if they went 
to war. This particularly threatened 
Greece, which expects to get another 
squadron of F-4 Phantoms next month. 
American diplomacy tried to be ac-
tive. President Ford made his firs( 
foreign intervention by asking Turkey 
to do nothing that would "humiliate" Washington, which has mishandled 
Aegean; not much ripple. Secretary 
Kissinger's call to Premier Caramanlis 
Weren't received with approbation or 
even respect. The United States is 
today widely disliked and mistrusted 
in Greece, 
Moscow, for its part, made scant 
headway. The Turks resented a Soviet-
launched rumor that 50,000 Russian 
troops were ready to help Ankara 
invade Cyprus. But Moscow, no slouch 
in these affairs, prompted its latest 
friend, Libya, to give Turkey minor 
air-force and financial aid and also 
applauded sprouting friendship be-
tween Ankara and Soviet-armed Syria. 
Greece rightly saw in all this a 
Kremlin effort to bust up NATO ? 
which Greece ended up doing itself. 
When Moscow suddenly shifted to a 
pro-Greek stance, there was little gen-
uine enthusiasm. Meantime, Belgrade 
'counseled Athens that since ? NATO 
couldn't protect its adherents, the five 
permanent members of the United Na-
tions Security Council, plus one non-
aligned spokethnan, Yugoslavia, should 
look after unattached lands like Cy-
prus. This suits Russia's present diplo-
macy. 
El 
Although both Greece and Turkey 
pride themselves on martial prowess, 
they each did badly in a military sense. 
The Greek mobilization was deplor-
able. Turkish paratroop drops in 
Cyprus were often far off target. An 
original Famagusta landing, scheduled 
to coincide with that at Kyrenia, had 
to be called off because it was so 
badly coordinated. The Turks bombed 
one of their destroyers, with heavy 
losses; the Greeks shot down one of 
their planes. 
might' be well adVited to sponsor a 
joint United States-West German mis-
sion of distinguished generals to ex-
plain to the Turkish Army why it 
should keep .its cool. The army re-
mains Turkey's ultimate political force. 
Gen. Lauds Norstad, former NATO 
boss, and Gen. Johann Von Kielman-
segg, who commanded,its central front, 
would be ideal for that purpose. 
America has much military prestige 
in Ankara but Germany's is of. far 
greater duration. ? 
Another thing. I hope Greece even-
tually reconsiders its promised expul-
sion of U.S. and NATO bases. But, in 
any event', there is too large an Amer-

Greece to Shut All Its

By Jack Anderson "We have made major efforts (D-Ind.); Peter Kyros, (D-Maine) ghan, the peppery Makarios was 
Public statements to the con-
trary, Greece is already making 
plans to shut down every NATO 
base in the country within a 
year, thus leaving a getting hole 
In the fabric of the Western 
world's defense systems. 
So secret are the new Athens 
civilian government's plans that 
even top U. S. officials are una-
ware of the 'seriousness of the 
threat. Jut a few days ago, De-
fense Secretary James Schle-
singer was speaking honestly 
when he said he had "little indi-
cation" of such a move. 
Our information, however, 
from high but confidential dip-
lomatic sources who backed up 
their talk with documents, is 
that the NATO shutdown is al-
ready a Matter of Athens policy, 
barring a radical change in the 
current U.S. attitude toward Cy-
prus. 
The importance of the Greek 
NATO bases is difficult to over-
estimate. Naval, bomber, mis-
sile and communiations facili-
ties in -Greece give NATO a 
striking power directly beneath 
the belly of Soviet Russia and 
her satellites. ? 
At the same time that Greece 
was setting its course on NATO, 
Secretary of State Henry Kis-
singer was assuring a private 
meeting with President Ford 
and Republican leaders that the 
U.S. policy on Cyprus is neutral. 
to elicit concessions from both 
the Greeks and the Turks," he 
said, according to confidential 
minutes of the White House 
meeting. "We will take a new 
look if the Turks cross the 
cease-fire line." 
The restive Republicans won-
dered why Kissinger had not 
simply halted aid to Turkey. 
Kissinger replied, according to 
the minutes, that this "woUld 
not have stopped the three-day 
occupation." 
Indeed, Kissinger warned, 
such drastic action "Would have 
enormous consequences on 
NATO, Turkish nationalism and 
(the) possible, approach to the 
Soviet Union." One "possible 
solution," Kissinger said, "may 
be a federalized republic or a 
Cantonal structure" ? in short, 
a semi-partitioning of Cyprus 
with Greece and Turkey each 
controlling part of the island. 
Added President Ford hope-
fully, "I think we'll come out all 
right as friends of both parties." 
Kissinger also met privately 
With five congressmen of Greek 
descent who gave him a far 
more obstreperous going over 
than the Republican leaders. 
One of the Greek-American leg-
islators who attended the off-
the-record meeting told us they 
tore into Kissinger "in a manner 
to which he is unaccustomed." 
The congressmen were Louis 
Bafalis, (R-Fla.), John Brademas 
Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), and Gus 
Yatron (D-Pa.). At one point, 
they told, Kissinger he was per-
sonally responsible for a "griev-
ous policy. The U.S. has egg all 
over its face." 
The strong-willed Kissinger was 
"patient" but "stuttered, reeled 
back and reddened" under the 
onslaught, we were told. At one 
point he left the meeting for a 
telephone conversation witt 
Turkish Prime Minister &tient 
Ecevit. But at the end of the-
meeting, Kissinger courteously 
invited the lawmakers to come 
back again. - 
Despite appearances of even-
handedness, we are told by high 
diplomatic sources that Kis-
singer tentatively and confiden-
tially agreed in recent meetings 
with British Ambassador Peter 
Ramsbotham to a Cyprus plan 
drawn up in London. 
To the distress of the'Greeks, 
it would, in effect, chop Cyprus 
into Greek and Turkish en-
claire% The Turks would make 
an ostentatious pull-back to a 
line running across the north-
ern third of the island to pacify 
world opinion a move they had 
intended anyway.- - 
When the plan was delicately 
put to deposed Cypriot presi-
dent Archibishop Makarios *in 
London by Britain's Prime Min-
ister Harold Wilson and For-
eign Secretary James Calla-
outraged, we were told. 
In Athens, Greek leaders are , 
also fuming. For years, they - 
have gone along with almost ev-
ery twist and turn in American 
policy, while the Turks have of- ? 
ten refused to cooperate with 
Washington. A few weeks ago, 
for instanceoTurkey defied the 
United States and resumed cul-
tivation of opium. . 
Meanwhile, we: have learned 
that Athens risked her good rel- ' 
ations with the Arabs by se-
cretly permitting the United 
States to use Greek NATO bases 
for shuttling supplies to Israel ? 
during the Middle East war last. 
October. As a result, Israel is se-
cretly grateful to Greece and 
hopes it will keep its NATO ties. 
During the October War, 
Greece also allowed U.S. 
irfcelli-
gence services to use a commu-
nications station outside Athens 
to monitor Soviet and Arab ra-
dio broadcasts. Turkey, on the 
other hand, reportedly permit-
ted the Soviets to overfly her 
territory to deliver .arms to the _ 
Arabs. 
Footnote: At the State Depart-
dent, a spokesman denied . 
Greek bases were used by. the 
United Statesto resiply Israel. 
He also said the British ? 
tive was not yet "developed." It 
does not have any ,"arms or 
legs" yet, he said.

BONN, Aug. 27?Public 
hearings into 'West Germany's 
most sensational spy scandal 
opened here today with the 
government expressing deter-
mination to keep "the smell of 
Watergate" out of the proceed-
ings. . ? 
A seven-man parliamentary 
commission is investigating 
the circumstances under 
which Guenter Guillaume 
managed to rise in 15 years 
from a supposed East German 
refugee to a position at former 
Chancellor Willy Brandt's el-
bow. Guillaume was arrested 
last May, and his exPosure 
was the motivation for 
Brandt's dramatic resignation 
.as head of the West German 
.government. 
A key subject in the parlia-
?mentary investigation is how 
Guillaume managed to get so 
far despite suspicions leveled 
against him 'ey official and 
private intelligence bodies

concerned.with Communist es-
pionage. 
This was not the immediate 
concern of the parliamentary 
committee, which Will hear 
some 20 witnesses this week. 
The opening eession was 
marked by partisan squabbles 
and a denial by an Interior 
Ministry official that there 
had been any government ma-
nipulation of documents. 
Government witnesses also 
testified there had been noth-
ing out of the ordinary in the 
procedures involved in Guil-
laume's employment, first as 
a junior member of Brandt's 
staff and later as one of his 
three personal advisers. But 
the committee has yet to go, 
into the hotly disputed ques-
tion of how Guillaume slipped 
through the seeurity checks. 
In. a' lengthy article on this 
subject, the respected Frank-
furter Allgemeine newspaper 
said yesterday that it was 
clear that pressure from the 
Social Democratic Party had fin 
e f Es 
overriden the hesitations of 
Bonn's security advisers. A key 
witness is expected to be for-
mer ? Gen. Gerhard Wessel, 
head of the Federal Intelli-
gence Service. 
At the time of Guillaume's 
appointment to the chancel-
lor's office in 1970, Wessel 
said that the East German 
agents background should be 
more closely investigated be-
cause of the reports about 
the Frankfurter Allge-
hith. 
meine reported. 
According to the paper, 
nothing was done other than 
to question Guillaume "in a 
naive and dilettantish way" 
and some officials who wanted 
to pursue the matter more in-
tensively were told that the in-
vestigation was closed. . 
The pressure to close the in-
vestigation came both . from 
the chancellor's office and 
from the ,Social Democratic 
Party, the paper said. 
The doubts about Guillaume 
were traced back to a report 
1955 by the Investigatiir-e 
View From the Rhine 
By James Reston 
? BONN, Aug. 22?This capital of 
West Germany is outwardly as calm 
these days as an American university 
town in vacation time, but inwardly 
? it is acutely worried about the world 
? economy. 
For while West Germany has the 
lowest inflation rate of any of the 
advanced industrial countries?about 
7 per cent?it depends for its pros-
perity and relatively full employment 
on selling its goods abroad. 
Compared to other European coun-
tries, it is in excellent shape. Though 
it still feels amputated with the loss 
of East Germany, its gross national 
product per capita is now almost 
double that of Great Britain. 
As things now stand, West Germany 
exports as much to the Western world 
as the United States and imports al-
most as much from the Western World, 
but this trade accounts for about 23 
per cent of West Germany's G.N.P., 
as compared to only about 5 per cent 
in the United States, which is there-
fore far more independent of the 
movements of the world markets. 
Officials here are watching the new 
Ford Administration in Washington 
with the greatest care. For as they 
see it, a strong anti-inflation policy 
in the United States would mean lower 
prices for American goods, higher un-
employment and therefore less U.S. 
BONN 
Since West Germany has led the 
world in combatting inflation, it is 
aware of the difficulty of arguing that 
other countries should do the same. 
But the point emphasized here is that 
the U.S. economy is five or six times 
as large as Germany's and that what-
ever the United States does greatly 
influences the world economy on 
which all industrial countries depend' 
more than the U.S. 
It is noted here that President 
Ford's main emphasis in his inaugural 
address to the Congress was on the 
need to fight inflation, and that he 
also spoke of the importance of world 
peace and order. But how far will he 
go, officials here ask, not only ver-
bally but actually, on a deflationary 
policy? Will he look at it mainly from 
a U.S. point of view, or try to find 
the delicate balance between just 
enough anti-inflation to help the 
United States and not so much as to 
produce world-wide deflation? 
The answer to this, of course, is 
that President Ford has been in office 
for only a few days, with a new Secre-
tary of the Treasury, a new chairman 
of the Council of Economic Advisers, 
and a new world-minded Vice-Presi-
dential nominee. Both the cast of 
characters and the mood of Washing- , 
ton are changing and nobody can be

Committee of Free Jurists, a 
private organization in West 
Berlin. At the time, Guillaume 
was employed by an East Ger-
man publishing house, and the 
committee note_d that his supe-
riors there -had reportedly, 
been told by the Communist 
Party not to concern them-
selves with his frequent ab-
sences from his post. 
. Guillaume was making fre-
quent trips to West Berlin and 
West Germany, where hE 
aroused the committee's sus 
picion. The committee's re 
port on him was handed to the 
West Berlin police and, ac 
cording to the leper, later sem 
on to Bonn but in a watered 
down version. 
?will go. 
? Conversations with officials in Bonn 
and in other European capitals, 
.however, demonstrate. haw difficult it 
is to generalize about America's rela-
tions with Europe, especially in the 
field of economics. 
Each country is still looking pri-
marily at its own problems. Thus 
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium 
have had stronger anti-inflation poli-
cies than others on this 'continent. 
France, before the death of _President 
Pompidou, was more concerned with 
the growth of her economy than with 
inflation, but under President Giscard 
is now taking a more deflationary 
line: Britain is in an alarming state, 
with grievous labor-management prob-
lems end an annual inflation rate of 
20 per cent: 
The members of the European Eco-
nomic Community are talking more 
frankly to one another now about their 
common problems, and the. relations 
between Chancellor Schmidt here and 
President Giscard in Paris are particu-
larly good, but all leaders are still 
having trouble in reaching common 
policies to fit their quite different 
traditions and econornc and political 
problems. 
As the testimony of German officials 
here shows, however, Europe, no mat-
ter how much she may worry about 
the power of the United States, can-
not insulate herself from that power 
economically or financially any more 
than she can militarily.

while the U.S. now has 5.3 per cent

only 2.3 per cent, unemployment here

Italy And the C.I.A.. 
To the Editor: 
After the corruption of Greek party 
politics, the systematic subversion and 
' then the total destruction of political 
liberty, after the spiritual humiliation 
of modern Greek culture, following 
? murder and torture by its Greek servi-
tors?the C.I.A. has been told to desist 
from interference in Greece. Had not 
the regime of the Colonels ended in 
'buffoonery and chaos, the C.I.A. would, 
have received no such directive?if, 
indeed, it can be obliged to respect it. 
Has anyone suggested dismissal, or 
even punishment, for the American 
public officials responsible for, out-
rages committed in our name in a 
friendly country? 
Perhaps, however, it is wiser to look 
to the future. There is another Medi-
terranean country in which democracy 
? is endangered. The recent bomb out-
rage on an Italian train shows that the 
Italian'right is determined to sow ter-
ror and disorder?to provoke .(or pro-
vide. an excuse for) a coup d'etat by 
certain elements in Italian politics and 
the' armed forces. 
? Many?Italian citizens are indeed re-
vulsed by the inefficiency, corruption 
and parasitism of the state bureaucracy 
(which is a fief of the Christian Demo-
cratic party). A new alliance for struc-
tural reform in Italian government and 
society is being negotiated by in-
fluential leaders of Italian business, 
by the unions, the Communists and 
Socialist parties and by ome Chris-
tian Democratic .leaders with a sense 
of responsibility. That alliance might 
well entail the entry of a Communist 
party in the Government. The right 
seeks to oppose this , at all costs. The 
Italian Communist party is so reform-
ist that it has been criticized by the 
Italian left for its moderation. Only 
the blindest and most primitive politi-
cal thinking could deny that the Ital-
ian Communists have in fact been 
pillars of the Italian republic since the 
fall of Fascism. 
Precisely that sort of political think-
ing, if it can be dignified by that term, 
has characterized the operations of the 
C.I.A. We are obliged to ask, before it 
is too late, whether the C.I.A. (and the 
American Embassy) have intervened 
in Italian politics. The New York Times 
has published reports that Mr. Fan-
fanfi, the leader of the right wing of 
the Christian Democrats, has received 
American subventions. Before events 
take a turn tragic for Italy, and for 
our good name in the world, our 
involvement in Italian politics should 
be re-evaluated. NORMAN Buusanum

Act Cautiously on Inflation 
Warns in Interview That Extreme Moves

Sptelai to The N 
BONN, Aug. 24?Chancellor 
Helmut Schmidt of West Ger-
many is warning the Ford. Ad-
ministration that extreme, 
measures to curb inflatien In 
thes :United States could seri-
ously disrupt the world econo-
my. 
In an interview with The 
New York Times, released to-
day, the former German Fi 
nance Minister recognized the 
need to combat inflation in the 
.United States, but appealed for 
day-to-day consultation among, 
the major industrial powers to 
avoid unemployment and re-
cession, 
"There is a danger," he said, 
"that if the United States as 
a whole goes deflationary 
this will inevitably spread to 
the world markets. It will mean 
less demand from the U.S. on 
the world market, and it will 
mean that we can sell less. 
"You have to light inflation, 
but please don't enter into de-
flation policy, because you 
might incur too much unem-
ployment, too much deflation 
in the world economy." 
Chancellor Schmidt was par-
ticularly eoncerned to avoid 
harsh action by the United 
States without adequate con-
sultation with other ,countries 
whose economies would be af-
fected by American policies. 
He indirectly criticized former 
Secretary of the Tresury John 
B. Connally for having done so 
in the past. 
What is required, he said, 
is the closest personal and al-
most daily contact among key 
officials in the United States, 
Germany, Britain, France and 
Japan. 
"They must never permit 
RESTON 
ew York rae! 
themselves again," he re-
marked, "what happened in 
August, 1971, when somebody 
acted on his own, even with-
out previous warning. . . . This 
was a grave mistake suscep-
tible . to destroying the trust, 
the confidence in the economic 
leadership of the United 
States." 
The Chancellor also., made 
the following points: 
tlAlready, "quite a few gov-
ernments were starting to act. 
on their own." He seemed de-
termined to raise a warning 
against the spread of unilat-
eral action. 
9The world has not yet seen 
all the negative consequences 
of the new floating monetary 
system. The world has been 
living with fixed exchange sys-
tems for generations and with 
floating rates.for only 15 or 17 
months. "We don't know what 
to AD with this new prenome-
non of the so-called Euro Mar-, 
ket." 
9Labor union leaders have to' 
take their share of blame for 
the inflation that is now 
Europe's major political and 
social problem. Real wages are 
falling in the industrial coun-
tries and the unions are natur-
ally trying to catch up, but this 
also affects inflation, 
9Fortunately, the rising gen-
eration in Europe, and particu-
larly in West Germany, takes 
both economic and political co-
operation between the nations 
much more for granted than 
the previous generation. 
(IA11 nations are caught up 
together in a vast stage of 
structural economic and finan-
cial change, "but it is not a 
situation in which you should 
lose your nerves or in which 
one should switch to pessi-
mism." 
The Chancellor referred to 
the new "shattering experience 
of the world monetary system 
26 
after the oil price crisis." He 
indicated that the world had 
not yet begun to feel the full 
force of this explosion. 
This aggravated the balance-
of-payments deficits of coun-
tries that were in deficit, and 
put into deficit some countries 
that had previously been in bal-
ince. The result was that some 
nations were getting to the 
point where they could not pay 
their bills, and were naturally 
cutting imports and affecting 
the balance of the exporting 
countries. 
While ,West Germany's um-
employment rate was only 2.2' 
per cent as compared with the 
United States' 5.3 per cent Mr. 
Schmidt noted that the Ameri-
can economy was five times as 
large as West Germany's. He 
noted that exports amounted 
to only about 5 per cent of the 
United States gross national 
product, whereas exports 
counted for almost a quarter of 
West Germany's GNP. 
, The Chancellor emphasized 
that he favored a faster unifi-
cation' of Europe. But he said 
Europe now lacked the outside 
threat and the dynamic leader-
ship that tended to produce 
common action. 
"We are living in art era of 
detente," he said, "and it's re-
ally d?nte. It is a much less 
dangerous world than it was at 
the time of the Cuban missile 
crisis and the Berlin crisis: We 
have had enough of that. The 
menace has gone, at least it 
has shrunk." 
Sees Problem of Coping 
But he added that nations 
had not yet learned to live in 
this new and complicated 
world, part nationalistic an 
increasingly interdependent. 
For example, he noted tha

were the Christian Demo-

was devastatingly simple : 
they were convinced that all 
attacks, -like this latest one, 
were organised- by the Chris-

In other words, the Chris-

discredit the extreme Right.

a long way, since the MSI 
was seeking a constitutional 
collapse through fanning 
public opinion on the current 
economic crisis and the 
scandals of corruption. But 
economics and. ? corruption 
had now been swept off the

the effect would be to under-

ATHENS?.-The bruise en NATO's 
southeastern flank caused by the 
Greek-Turkish showdown over Cyprus 
is going to take time to heal. In the 
end the alliance should be strength-
ened by the mere fact that it survived 
another confrontation between two of 
its partners. But that "end" is still far 
off. '? 
NATO is a curious pact. It has man-
aged to survive a quarter of a century 
of peace. equalled only by the Delian 
League created in these parts 25 cen-
allies ago and it somehow keeps go-
ing despite private wars involving its 
members. 
Thus, during its lifetime, Belgium 
has fought in the Congo, the British 
and French in Egypt, France in Al-
geria, Portugal in its African colonies, 
America in Vietnam, Iceland and Brit-
ain in ? naval mini-exchanges and 
Greece and Turkey on and off again 
around Cyprus. 
But weirdly enotigh, none of these 
confrontations has smashed the coali-
tion irreparably. Indeed today, for the 
first time, NATO .is a genuinely uni-
form alliance in the philosophical 
sense of being democratic, thanks to 
political upheavals in Portugal, Turkey 
and Greece. 
But purification came at a price. 
a high 'degree of specialisa-

rele as a supreme producer 
of top-rate scientists and 
technologists. Education will 
be the battle of life, history 
will be based on arguments 
not dry facts, new technolo-
gical studies will have pride 
of place in our schools. 
"In this the help of the 
Catholic Church will be 
sought, but it will be a 
different Catholic Church. It 
will be free of all creeping 
progressiveness. We will 
oppose the 'idea of the pro-
gressive priest. Above all, we 
will fight corruption, and con-
duct a policy of denunciation ?

convinced that in the long

party that has the courage to 
reject corruption in all fields

"The Italian people will

the current media and will

propose. We will demand 
necessary sacrifices of the

will bring them back to the 
position of a major power." 
Here I interrupted the flow

more details and partly be-
Turkey now maintains in Cyprus about 
two divisions, whin would be better 
stationed near Russia. Both the Turks 
and the Greeks paid heavily for a 
mobilization against each other. The 
Greek call-up was a disastrous mess. 
Turkey has unilaterally warned 
Greece it is revising its national air-
space and henceforth regards offshore 
Greek islands as Turkish. This means 
that if Athens sends planes to Rhodes 
or Chios without first asking Ankara's ? 
permission, they might be shot down. 
The psychological atmosphere re-:.

tries, must be canceled. Likewise, 
there is no present thought of sending 
back to Izmir, Turkey, the Greek of-
ficers and men normally attached to a 
NATO subheadquarters there, with-
drawing during the Cyprus affair. 
None of this is pleasant news and 
-tension is, likely to continue. Cyprus 
is a boil not yet lanced. It is hard for 
the Greeks to replace the 650 officers 
assigned to that island's national 
guard. If they withdraw the lot who

Also, it has been riven by politics.

cause. I was by now disturbed 
by the glazed expression in 
the eyes of this ordinary look-
ing Italian. I asked how this 
programme would be carried 
out. The reply was that the 
Movimento Sociale Italiano di 
Destra Nazionale did not 
believe in mathematical for-
?mulae like ?tne Communists. 
In answer to a question about" 
the relationship of this new 
Italy to the rest of the world, 
the reply was that Italy would 
play a major role in the nations 
of Europe that would no 
longer be the instrument of 
Russia and the US. 
The conversation had the 
familiar ring of the old brand 
of Fascist- propaganda. What 
did they think was new in 
the arguments they pro-
pounded. The student of 
economics answered and had 
the final word: "Our em-
phasis on the phenomenon of 
the youthful Right is new. 
It is new because it follows 
a period of permissiveness 
and because youth, having 
been used by the old political 
powers after 1968, is sick of 
this permissiveness and seeks 
the moral values we-offer. We 
can solve the problems of 
youth in Italy, and the 
strength of our youth groups 
is the new element we . 
bring." 
Certain key junta supporters have 
been moved from Athens-to distant 
units. But the military remains politi-
cized and uneasy. -- - 
Another weakness is the queStion of 
strategic relations with the United 
States. Washington had based Greek 
-policy on the need to maintain bases 
here, including homeporting facilities 
for one Sixth Fleet carrier, in order to 
? be able to maintain a credible position 
vis-a-vis Russia in the Middle East. 
The first part of this formula was 
worked out and a destroyer flotilla 
was centered around Athens, including 
families of the crews, although every 
intelligent American recommended it 
would be preferable to keep a low pro-
file, arguing, if the United States Navy 
insisted, it was wiser to do the home-: 
porting in relatively remote Suda Bay, 
Crete. 
But negotiation of the formula's cru-
cial second part?involving the car-. 
rier itself?came to a head just as the 
junta headed by Colonel Papadopoulos 
Was replaced by the junta headed by 
General Ioannides. The latter immedi-
ately demanded a higher price from 
Washington?in terms of aid and 
weapons?and the proceedings got; 
stuck. So, by inept policy, the United 
States earned the blame for tolerating 
a nasty political regime in order to get 
naval privileges it never really ob-
tained. 
Thus, in the material sense, NATO is. 
in poor shape now in the critical area--
separating the Soviet Union from the 
turbulent and vital Middle East. Allied 
diplomacy must work hard and swiftly 
to rectify this situation. In doing so, 
fortunately, it can rely? on the fact 
that, despite their quarrel, in both ' 
Greece and Turkey for the first time 
in years the spirit of -democracy has 
revived.

NEAR EAST REPORT 
28 AUG 1974 
American Friends of the Middle East 
This is the second in a series of articles 
describing the affiliations, statements, 
and activities of several Washington or-
ganizations which promote Arab inter-
ests in the United States. 
American Friends of the Middle 
East (AFME), located in an expansive 
office on Massachusetts Avenue, de-
scribes itself as a "private, non-profit 
organization dedicated to furthering 
communication and understanding be-
tween the peoples of the Middle East 
and North Africa and the people .of the 
United States through educational and 
informational programs." 
According to Director of Information 
Services, Joan L. Borum, AFME was 
created in 1951 when it became ap-
parent that the United States was des-
tined to play a significant role in the 
Middle East. As a result of efforts by 
several noted individuals active in the 
Arab Middle East, AFME was organized 
to present "the other side" of the Middle 
East story, which its founders felt was 
not adequately represented or heard in 
this country. 
"We have always tried not to favor 
the pro-Arab side or the pro-Israel side," 
Borum said, "but have looked at the 
Palestine question from a pro-American 
side." She maintained that American 
political decisions concerning the Mid-
dle East are often "made without ade-
quate access of information." 
Avowed Anti-Zionism 
Politically, however, AFME is any-
thing but neutral. The organization is 
avowedly anti-Zionist?though not anti-
Israel?asserted Borum, who did not 
see this as a political orientation. Chal-
lenging Israel's right to exist as an "ex-
clusive theocratic state," Borum insist-
ed that because the creation of Israel 
was predicated by the Zionist move-
ment" it was established on wrong prem-
ises." She called American support 
for the founding of Israel "a big mis-
take in terms of American national in-
terest. We don't think Israel will ever 
be a viable entity in the Middle East," 
she said. 
To be sure, AFME today has as-
sumed a much more restrained polit-
ical role than in the past when it boast-
ed such extremists and well-known anti-
Zionists as Dr. Elmer Berger, Harold 
B. Minor, and Kermit Roosevelt on its 
Board of Directors. The stigma of the 
viciously anti-Zionist diatribes of foun-
der Dorothy Thompson, however, has 
not yet worn off entirely. Nowadays, 
AFME is less concerned about dissem-
inating outright propaganda as about 
emphasizing Arab medical, educational, 
and economic progress. 
With total membership under a thou-
sand, AFME relies in small part on a 
little over three thousand individual 
contributors to help finance its opera-
tions. There is no need to actively solicit 
funds, however, since a steady flow of 
money comes from numerous contracts 
and grants from major corporations and 
foundations. Among these are the Ford 
Foundation, the Department of State, 
and the American-operated Saudi Ara-
bian Airlines. 
Oil companies and other major in-
dustries have also contributed, but Bor-
urn termed these sums "very minor" 
since the organization itself is "not a 
direct service to them" and, therefore, 
not necessarily in their interest to sup-
port. In recent years no corporate fund-
ing has exceeded $5,000 per year. 
CIA Funding 
Borum admitted that in the past 
AFME had received significant sums 
from organizations, including the phil-
anthropic Dearborn Foundation, which 
were later shown to be conduits for 
CIA funds. Borum added that since the 
disclosure in 1964, there has been no 
financial assistance from sources receiv-
ing CIA funding. (See Near East Re-
port Special Survey, 1964.) 
A significant portion of AFME's dis-
bursements are to its eight overseas 
offices in the Arab world?none in 
Israel. Besides the main Washington 
office, there are U.S. branches in New 
York, Chicago, and San Francisco, with 
several more local chapters nattered 
throughout the country. 
Although funds are primarily ? used 
for "manpower and development proj-

ects" in -Arab countries, nearly one-
half of AFME'S total revenues go to 
maintenance and ? administration. At 
present top priority is being given to 
counseling Arab students for admission 
to American universities under pro-
grams sponsored by the U.S. govern-
ment. AFME also sends specialists to 
Arab countries to establish bases of co-
operation with religious, cultural, and 
social-minded leaders of the Middle 
East. It sponsors programs of Arab 
speakers before student, church, and 
civic groups to acquaint American au-
diences with the Arab viewpoint and 
conducts an active publication?campaign. 
? Besides its bi-monthly newsletter, 
:AFME Report, the organization puts 
"out literature describing its activities 
and promoting the sale of books and 
pamphlets articulating the Arab posi-
tion. These publications unabashedly 
reflect AFME's anti-Zionist posture. 
Viewpoints, published monthly, deals 
with cultural and economic events in 
the Arab world. The "Basic Facts 
Series" is a compilation of paMphlets 
providing general information on indi-
vidual Arab countries. Mid East, a 
monthly review of events, was discon-
tinued in 1971 for lack of funds. Ad-
ditionally, AFME acts- as a clearing 
-house for information on the Middle 
East by offering books and other publi-
cations to its members and contribu-
tors at substantial discounts. Perusal of 
the list of information services, how-
ever, favors representation of the Arab 
perspective on the problem. 
One of AFME's principal objectives 
is combating what Borum categorized 
as "misinformation" of the American 
public by Zionist elements. Asked 
whether AFmE's anti-Zionist leaning did 
not place the integrity of the organiza-
tion as a nonpartisan one into question, 
Borum hesitated before saying that this 
was a serious consideration which she 
needed more time to think about.

Something has gone Wrong With the administration's 
game plan for Diego Garcia. CIA Director William 
Colby broke ranks and qualified the arguments of the 
Pentagon?particularly those of the recently retired 
.chief of naval -operations, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt ? 
which sought to justify the need for America's first 
Indian Ocean naVal. and air base because the Russians 
.either already were around, or certain to come..: 
In presenting-the case before Congress,-Adni.:Zurn-.

of Missouri, who gained x-ray military vision as Presi-
dent Truman's: Secretary of the _Air Force and. who 
uniquely straddles seats on both the Armed Services 
and Foreign Relations Committees, had doubts. He 
summoned Colby to testify before-allowing his Senate 
military construction subcommittee to proceed on the 
navy's request for $29 million for the initial expansion 
of the Diego Garcia project. And since only two fellow 
? senators showed up to listen, Symington persuaded 
Colby that it would be in the public interest for him 
to sanitize his testimony and permit as much as pos-
sible to be printed in the Congressional Record: T. 
In contrast to the admirals' red maps of the Indian 
Ocean area, Colby had his own :way of dramatizing: 
Socotra, in the. Chagos Archipelago; "A bare island. 
There is almost nothing there except for a small garri-:

World War II air strip which is really not feasible for

On Indian Ocean Bases

President Ford committed a has contended that Soviet

nied that its naval presence in 
the Indian Ocean constitutes a 
threat to peace in the area

"Unfortunately, it must be 
noted that the head of the 
Americr Government was mis-
informed by his staff. In reality 
there exist neither three nor 
even' one U.S.S.R. naval base 
in tihe Indian Ocean," asserted 
a commentary issued today by 
the official press agency Tass. 
The Tass rebuttal to a re-
mark made by Mr. Ford in his 
news conference last Wednes-
day was the first criticism 'of 
the new President to appear in 
the Soviet press. While it was 
couched in mild language, the 
response pointed up Moscow's 
sensitivity about the Soviet

The Soviet Presence 
The Pentagon has main-
tained that expansion of the 
1Diego Garcia base into a naval 
and air support facility is nec-
essary to counter the growing 
Soviet naval presence in the 
area. 
The Soviet Navy first moved 
into the Indian Ocean in 1968. 
Since 1971, it has kept a flot-
illa estimated at up to 20 Ves-
sels in the ocean, drawn from 
its Pacific fleet based at Vladi-
vostok.

to create "chaos on the seas 
and oceans" at the 10-week 
conference. 
, ? Today Tass gently reproved 
-President Ford for his stance 
?on Diego Garcia by noting that 
the Director of Central Intelli-
gence, William E. Colby, bad 
in testimony before the Senate 
Armed Services Committee de-
scribed the So.viet presence in 
the Indian Ocean as "relatively 
small" and had 'said that the 
final size of Soviet forces there 
would depend upon what the 
United States put into the area. 
The Tass commentary, which 
lwas written by Aanatoly Krasi-
!kov, depicted the proposed new 
base as a bustling, formidable 
island fortress. 
"The Pentagon's plans have, 
however, met with serious ob-
jections from the U.S. Congress

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
27 August . 1974 . 
Israeli trip 
to U.S. set up 
despite spat 
By Jason Norris . 
? Special to 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Jerusalem 
Yitzhak Rabin's American debut as 
Israel's Prime Minister, now offi-
cially scheduled for early next month, 
began stirring up squabbles here even 
before its political aims were for-
mally defined. 
?, Much of the controversy stems 
from the awkward way in which 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's 
'invitation was extended to Mr. Rabin, 
according to some Israeli com-
mentators. 
-. They complain that Dr. Kissinger 
announced that the Israeli "Pi--efaler 
-would be visiting Washington, D.C., 
before Mr. Rabin had agreed to the 
prospective date, thereby presenting 
him with a "fait accompli." 
The hard noses among them even-
suggested that Mr. Rabin should 
defer a decision on the matter, if not 
reject the American bid outright for 
that reason. 
Other critics of the Rabin mission 
contend that it is part of the current 
spate of "sham diplomacy" in which 
a great many Middle Eastern com-
ings and goings are no more than a 
camouflage for a very real diplomatic 
stalemate. ? 
One highly tuned source in the 
Israeli capital suggested that chances 
for resumption of the Geneva peace 
conference on the Middle East this 
fall are weak, if only because of the 
sweeping changes in the U.S. admin-
istration. 
Mr. Rabin's Cabinet, however, 
voted unanimously to approve his 
plans regarding the U.S. visit, speci-
fying that it would take place during 
"the first half of September." 
At the same time it bowed to the 
Premier's request that deliberations

Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100340008-2 
until a later date on the ground that 
political developments may occur in 
the interim. According to the indepen-
dent daily Haaretz the session prob-
ably will be held Sept. 8 ? as close as 
possible to Mr. Rabin's actual depar-
ture. 
The Premier attempted to mollify 
Dr. Kissinger's local critics by point-
ing out that the original invitation was. 
extended by former President Nixon 
during his tour of Israel June 17. 
Not only was the project mentioned 
In the joint Israeli-American commu-
nique at the close of Mr. Nixon's stay 
but it also was reiterated in a mes-
sage sent by President Ford on Aug. 
9.. Mr. Rabin noted that Mr. Ford 
suggested that the visit take place "at 
end of the summer." 
Mr. Rabin evidently subscribes to 
the belief that the U.S. Interest in 
having him follow in the wake of his 
own Foreign Minister and those of 
Jordan, Egypt and Syria and to 
precede Egyptian President Sadat to 
Washington is linked to the desire to 
preserve the diplomatic momentum. 
On the other hand, the Israeli 
Premier, who served until last year 
as his country's Ambassador to the 
U.S., reportedly observed that domes-
tic political considerations may have 
played a part in President Ford's 
timing the approaching congres-
sional election. 
'Hysteria' decried 
He urged his countrymen to avoid 
taking extreme or "hysterical" posi-
tions on the implications of the next 
U.S.-Israeli summit, contending that 
"calm" would serve thein better at 
this stage. 
The emotional background of the 
anti-Kissinger groundswell lies in the 
impression that Secretary Kissinger 
may be about to exert pressure on 
Israel to accept a disengagement 
formula along the River Jordan. 
This would entail a withdrawal of 
Israeli forces, 'establishment of a 
United Nations buffer zone, and re-
newal of Jordanian civil adminis-
tration in occupied Jericho. 
Opposition circles argue that no 
territory in the occupied West Bank 
should be relinquished without sub-
WASHINGTON POST 
24 August 1974 
Rowland Evans and Robert Novak 
espair in the Mideast 
Private word from a top American 
' diplomat to a Western ambassador last 
week that Israel "etas shut the door" to 
further withdrawal from the Syrian 
Golan Heights brought this instant 
rejoiner: "If so, that means war." 
The exchange is symbolic ef the sud-
den descent from soaring optimism 
that marked every step of Secretary -of 
State Henry Kissinger's brilliant shut-
tle diplomacy following the Arab-Is-
raeli war of last October. 
? Indeed, a mood approaching black 
despair has now taken hold in all Arab' 
capitals since Kissinger's last 1Vfideast 
success?pinning down the partial Is-
raeli withdrawal from Syria's Golan 
Heights on May 31. Since then, the ab-
rupt change of Presidents in Washing-
ton, coupled with U.S. impotence re-
garding the Turkish-Greek war on Cy-
prus, has led Israel into bold new dip-
lomatic intransigence. 
Although it' is far to early to prove 
him right, the Arabs fear that Presi-
dent Ford, long a champion of Israel 
as a Republican congressional leader, 
will be less liardnosed with the Israelis 
than was Richard Nixon. 
Because of his extreme political 
weakness at home, a desperate Presi-
dent Nixon this year needed diplo-
matic successes in the Mideast as fast 
as Kissinger could get them and so 
leaned hard against Israel. Mr. Ford is 
under no such pressure. Moreover, 
with the 1974 congressional election 
only two months away, the President 
mieht be understandably reluctant to 
use two-fisted pressure against Israel 
this fall. 
This at least partially explains prime 
minister Yitzhak Rabin's new hard line 
in Jerusalem. Rabin's government has 
now systematically closed off every 
bargaining opportunity with the Arabs 
save one: a second-stage Israeli withe 
? drawal from the Egyptian Sinai penin-
sula. But that single opportunity has 
been tightly closed by the Arabs. them-
selves. 
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat is 
under overwhelming pressure from 
other Arab capitals not to take any 
new withdrawal agreement with Israel, 
'on grounds that the Palestinian issue 
-must be dealt, with first. That Arab 
pressure would threaten Sadat with 
political overthrow if he went ahead, 
ae he would prefer, with a new Israeli 
withdrawal agreement. 
Valls, Israel's desire to negotiate 
with Egypt is meaningless. Sadat's 
hands are tied. 
On the other two fronts, Rabin him-
. 
self is now taking a muscular position: 
the Golan Heights will remain an in-
separable part of Israel; and Israel's 
"rieht" to settlements in Judea and Sa-
maria, the ? West Bank of the Jordan 
River that Israel seized from Jordan in 
1967, goes hack to "ancient times." In 
other words, Israel will, not make even 
the token six-mile withdrawal from the 
river that King Hussein demands as 
the price of attending the ever more 
distant Geneva conference. 
This stalemate; which many experts 
believe wiP lead to a far more danger-
ous war?bloodier, longer and more 
apt to involve the superpowers?than 
last October's, has continued despite 
the paeede of Israeli and Arab leaders 
to Washington the past few weeks. 
32 
mating the matter to a national 
referendum, as pledged previously by 
Mr. Rabin. 
Evacuation specter raised 
These'groups fear that Israel will be 
forced to evacuate the West Bank in 
it entirety and hand it back to 
Jordan, which in turn might lose it to 
a militant Palestinian Arab regime. 
However, Mr. Rabin will not be 
empowered to act at his own dis-
cretion once in Washington, nor will 
his discussions be limited to territo-
rial questions. ? 
Under Israel's political system, 
which is based on parliamentary 
coalitions of political parties, a prime, 
minister is duty bound to represent 
the policies approved by the Cabinet 
as a whole. 
Hence the .importance of the pre-
departure cabinet deliberations. They 
will virtually write Mr. Rabin's script 
for presentation to President Ford, 
Dr. Kissinger, and Defense Secretary 
James Schlesinger.. 
Indeed, the Ford administration, has 
not yet finally decided where Israel . 
should next be pressured to move: the 
West Bank, the Golan Heights or,a 
combination of bath. ? ? 
To prepare for another war, Isreal is 
now neeotiating with reluctant Penta-' 
gon officials for a vast increase in its 
militara. arsenal: $e billion in "urgent"' 
aid, plus a separate package of S1.5 bil-
lion a year for each of the next five 
years. 
This is supposed to balance the huge" 
Soviet arms shipments to Syria. But 
many military experts here feel it 
would give Israel. too .much potential - 
fer long-run mletary Operations- the 
United States would be' powerless to 
stop. 
? Yet, threatened disintegration of the 
southern arm of NATO in Greece and 
Turkey gives new substance to Israel's 
arms demands. With the United States, 
the United Nations and NATO itself 
unable to stop the Turkish invasion of 
Cyprus Israel has gained an important 
new argument to support its demands. 
for defense against the Arabs. 
Only Personal intervention by Presi-
dent Ford, convincing Israel that he 
will not relax U.S pressure for territo-
rial concessions and that he stands as 
? firmly behind his beleaguered Secre-
tary of State as Nixon did, can now ar-
rest the alarmieg decline in once 
bright hopes for a settlement.

NEW YORK TIMES,  MONDAY, AUGUST 26, 1974 
India's Downtrodden Burst Into Literature  
By BERNARD WEINRAUB 
specie to The New York Times 
NEW DELHI, Aug. 25?A 
wave of angry writing 'by im-
poverished and low-caste au-
thors has burst across the 
literary landscape of India. 
. The literature, mostly poetry, 
is unusual because of its furi-
ous explicitness, its sexual 
bluntness and its dark tone. 
Perhaps most significant, this 
is the first time that a large 
body of writers who are .so-
called "untouchables" are ex-
pressing their rage at high-
caste Hindus and at a system 
the: authors term exploitive. 
Within the last year, the 
spate of angry poetry has 
emerged in such states as 
Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, 
Gujarat, Hihar, Kerala, Tamil 
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and 
West Bengal. Although the 
poetry is written in regional 
languages and published in 
small magazines, radical news-
papers, leaflets?even on walls 
--literary critics are terming 
the movement a significant 
break from tradition. 
"In the past, high-caste writers 
dominated our literature," said 
Dr. Prabhakar Machwe, sedr6-
tary of the Government-sup-
ported Sahitye(literary) Acad-
emy, a coordinating body that 
seeks to advance modern Indian 
writing. "Now the so-called de-
pressed classes are getting edu-
cated. Social and political causes 
are reaching the masses. People 
are finding frustration every-
where and looking for means to 
express it." 
Although untouchability is 
outlawed in India's Constitu-
tion, discrimination and preju-
dice are still widespread against 
:Hindus born to families outside 
the tiered caste system, in 
:which the priestly Brahmin 
caste is the highest. 
Reject Ideology 
Dr. Niachwe, a poet himself, 
said: "Many of these young 
people have gone beyond ideol-
ogy -- they say ideology has. 
no meaning. They say it's all 
part of a chessboard that must 
be discarded. It's a kind of ni-
hilPisemrh'a.ps the most noted writ-
ers are the Dalit Panthers, from 
the Bombay area. These young 
authors, writing in the local 
language, Marathi, have named 
their movement after the Black 
Panthers ? the word Dalit 
means oppressed ? and have 
sought to merge poetry with 
political activism. 
Vrtually all the Dalits were 
born as Harijans ? the Hindi 
word for "children of God," a 
terms Gandhi used for untouch-
ables in an effort to remove the 
stigma against them?and have 
converted to Buddhism. 
These poets write for two 
local magazines and have been 
published in the English-lan-
guage press. 
"We've always had liberal 
Indians writing about Harijans, 
but not Harijans writing about 
themselves," said Dileep Padgi-
onkar, an e4ditor of The Times 
of India who is compiling a 
book on Dalit poetry. "But the 
language .was still a Brahmin's 
language." 
"The new poets have literally 
aggressed the language. They 
use obscenity, new words, new 
speech that are part of the 
culture of poverty." 
"These new poets are mot.; 
desperate than angry," he said. 
"They're desperate about the 
economic situation, about the 
lack of solutions, about the 
lack of public morality." 
Linked to Polities 
In some cases, poetry and 
politics have intertwined. A 
Harijan minister in the southern 
state of Kannada, formerly My-
sore, was forced to resign when 
he termed current establish-
ment literature there as cattle 
feed. 
A ministe- in the state of 
Tamil Nadu has urged poets to 
emulate?in Tamil?the writ-
ings of the angry young authors 
in other states. In Andhra 
Pradesh, an eastern state, sev-
eral angry poets have joined a 
violent movement based on the 
Naxalites, who were terrorists 
in West Bengal five years, ago. 
Moreover, the tough poetry 
'as well as several new plays 
and novels are now splashed 
with explicit sexual passages, 
unusual in Indian literature. 
Incestuous and homosexual re-
lations have been dealt with 
lin recent novels and plays by 
'Bengali, Marathi and Hindi au-
thors. 
One, play in Bombay "Va-
sena Kand" ("Passionate Af-
fair"), is now facing a', court 
test on obscenity_ charges be-
cause it involves incest. 
Cites Newspaper Violene 
"It comes simply t othis," Mr. 
Machwe wrote recently in a 
literary journal. "We tolerate 
and even connive at violence 
in life?every daily newspaper 
is full of such harrowing tales 
of rape of Harijan women, 
burning alive of untouchables, 
murders of poor people. But 
if one mentions them in lit-
erature; the poor author is 
banned." 
? ? Writers and critics have said 
that the most forceful influ-
ence among the younger au-
thors is Allen Ginsberg, the 
American poet who lived brief-
ly in Calcutta and Benares 
nearly a decade ago. , 
"He made a tremendous. im-
pact with his form, his writ-
ing, his way of life," said Shak-
ti Chatterjee, a poet and 'critic 
.in Calcutta. 
I ? "He taught people something 
very simple: that a poet can 
go without a job, can be solely 
devoted to poetry: He taught 
us that." 
Other influences include the 
Spaniard, Federico Garcia.. Lor-
pa; the Chilean, Pablo Neruda, 
and the Russian, Vladimir Maya-
kovsky. 
Recite on the Streets 
Some poems express empty 
despair. In the impoverished 
northeastern state of Bihar, for 
example, where a restless stu-
dent movement is mounting an 
anti-Government protest, poets 
have actually come out on 
street corners and recited their 
work. One' poem, recently pub-
lished in English by, an anony-
mous writer, starts: 
The university gave me 
A bundle of paper, 
Weighed down by that burden 
I knocked at every door, 
And today after having sold 
myself . 
For a whole month, 
And emerged from the office, 
I realize?
That there are a few coinIn 
my palm 
But no rations in the bazaar... 
Mother, 
What kind of jungle have you 
brought me into? 
Some poems ? express the 
anger of the untouchables. An 
anonymous South Indian Tamil 
author, in a recent anthology 
of angry poetry, wrote: 
How do we bear the hot sun 
By being burned by it 
' How do we shield ourselves from 
the rain 
1By being drenched in it , 
I How do we keep hunger away 
,By Starving 
'How do we cure diseases ? 
By Death 
;Do you know 
Who are we? 
? Numerous poets mock the 
National Government, including 
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, 
and write ferociously of the 
,ruling Congress party, whose 
!members often symbolically 
wear clothes of white home-
spun, called Ithadi. A poet from 
Kananda writes:. 
Spit on you! two faced, double:-
tongued 
Khadi-wearing, silk-draped 
Fellow with an open empty skull:.; 
And some of the poets ex-
press anarchic rage. Namdeo 
Dhasal, one of .the most-promi-
nent writers in the current 
movement and a central figure 
in the Dalit Panthers, wrote 
recently: ? 
Here every season is cruel 
So it is not enough to hang a 
skeleton by a branch 
Here eyelids have no lashes 
Here every offerer is a miser k 
So only breaking the glasses is 
? not enough 
Here there is no burning inner soul 
'All creation is turned to coal 
Here every epic poet is a Lilli-
putian dwarf....

Washington Post Foreign Service 
DACCA?Without doubt, 
this year's floods in Bangla-i 
desk have killed people, de-
stroyed crops and wrecked 
homes. ? . 
No one knows, however, 
how high the death toll is, 
or how -extensive the darn. 
age. 
' More important, no one ' 
knows, either, how to re-
spond to Bangladesh's pleas 
for help, so thoroughly has 
the government destroyed 
its credibility. 
"We believe the flooding 
has been more widespread 
than normal," says a U.S. 
aid official, "but the damage 
to housing .and loss of lives 
and crops are not severe." 
"What matters is not how 
widespread the floods are," 
says a leading government 
agricultural economist, "but 
how long the water. remains 
on the ground. Anything 
more than five days and rice ! 
plants cannot survive. In 
some parts of the country 
they have been ?.iundated 
for weeks and the water is 
only now beginning to re- , 
cede." 
"The damage to property, ' 
particularly to housing, has 
been enormous,", says a Dan-
?ish official of. the interna-' 
tional League of Red Cross 
Societies. "And the floods 
have perhaps been the last 
straw tti what was already a 
highly critical food saute-
-tion." 
The World Bank con- ' 
ducted a survey of crop 
damage and concluded that 
the official government 
claim a a loss of 1.1 million 
tons of rice was accurate. 
sh 
A number of dip omatie 
observers and foreign ex-
perts are mildly surprised 
that the government has 
limited its claim to this fig-
ure because it was matched 
during the floods of 1968 . 
and surpassed in 1970, while 
Bangladesh was still east 
Pakistan. 
The -explanation seems to 
be that- cooler heads among 
senior government officials 
have prevailed upon the 
flamboyant prime minister, 
_Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to 
try to convince increasingly ? 
suspicious and cynical aid 
donor nations of Bangla-
desh's good faith. ?

tics on flood deaths are rela-

. The smaller numbers 
have confused Bengalis and 
foreigners. Everyone in 
Dacca seems to have his 
own formula for proving or 
disproving the official statis-
tics. But the fact is that no 
meaningful assessments will 
be possible until the waters 
recede. 
The attempt to appear sin-
cere may be too late and, 
Ironically, may work against 
Mujib's efforts to . attract 
foreign aid. 
To date, worldwide re-
sponse to the country's ap-
peals has been just over $3.6 
million. Earlier this month, 
more than 30 ambassadors 
based in Dacca were taken

"It's not that we've been 
bitten once and are wiser," 
said a Western economist 
who has helped Bangladesh 
through five years of recur-
ring disaster. "We've been 
bitten dozens of times." 
The "biting" began when 
the world responded to the 
death and destruction 
wreaked by the cyclone of 
November 1970. Then in 
1971 came the Pakistan 
army's campaign of terror 
to put 'down the ? Bangladesh 
independence movement.' 
The war was followed by a 
drought in 1972. Then came 
the effect of the oil price 
rise on the feeble Bangla-
desh economy in 1973, and 
now the floods of 1974. 
Bangladesh is' a desper-
ately poor country and 
needs all the help it can get. 
But foreign governments 
are reluctant to keep on pro-
viding it because of Mujib's 
government, which is crip-

Res retaHate f r &Viet Army's land 
By Daniel Southerland 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Saigon 
The South Vietnamese Army has 
paid a price for its land grabbing in 
the northern part of South Vietnam. 
Retaliation by the Communists in 
this area has led in recent weeks to 
the heaviest fighting since the cease-
fire was declared more than a year 
and a half ago. The North Vietnamese 
have regained a good part of the 
territory they held in the northern-
most region at the time of the cease-
fire. 
Casualties have been high. One 
well-informed military officer reports 
that there are more wounded South 
Vietnamese soldiers in hospitals at 
the moment than at any time since the-
cease-fire was supposed to have be-
gun. ? 
But veteran analysts say that the 
Communists' aims for the moment 
appear to be limited. The attacks that 
have occurred are not intended to be 
knockout blows, they say. In fact, 
Hanoi is far from releasing the full 
force of its war machine in the 
northern region. 
"What we are seeing is first an 
attempt to roll back 'pacification' and 
second an attempt to make the GVN 
[Government of Vietnam] more rea-
sonable from the Communist point of 
view," said one Saigon analyst. 
"They [the Communists] are at-
tempting to regain the territory which 
they claim was theirs or which in fact 
was theirs at the time of the signing of 
the peace agreement," this analyst 
said. 
Mobility shown 
Some analysts think that the cur-
rent attacks may also turn out to be a 
prelude to some sort of new Commu-
nist political initiative coming per-
haps as early as the beginning of next 
year. 
One thing which the recent fighting 
has clearly demonstrated is the im-
proved mobility of the Communist 
forces in South Vietnam. One Commu-
nist regiment, the 29th, appeared 
quite suddenly and unexpectedly dur-
ing the fighting around Thuong Duc 
last month. The soldiers in this regi-
ment were rapidly deployed in trucks, 
thanks to new roads developed by the 
Communists since the cease-fire. 
Intelligence experts agree that the 
North Vietnamese currently have 
enough Material stockpiled in South 
Vietnam to launch a general offensive 
lasting many months. 
South Vietnam's President, Nguyen 
van Thieu, has been predicting such 
an offensive for more than a year 
now. His information minister an-
nounced that a major offensive was 
Imminent five months ago. But the 
much-predicted offensive has not 
come. 
Public-relations effort? 
President Thieu's predictions are 
seen by many observers as part of a 
South Vietnamese public-relations ef-
fort designed to secure continuing 
support and sympathy from the 
United States. 
The predictions may also be de-
signed to help maintain South Viet-
namese Army discipline and to pro-
vide a pretext for Mr. Thieu's contin-
uing refusal to agree to certain politi-
cal provisions called for in the Viet-
nam peace agreement. 
Contrary to Mr. Thieu's pre-
dictions, there are a number of rea-
sons for believing that a major offen-
sive is far from imminent:

e The rate of conscription and the 
rate of military training in North 
Vietnam are both currently at low 
levels. One would expect them to be at 
high levels before an offensive. 
? While Hanoi has the supplies to I 
carry out a major offensive, it has not 
been sending troops into the South in 
large enough numbers to indicate 
'preparations for an offensive. Nor has 
it distributed its supplies in a manner 
that would signal an imminent offen-

oil North Vietnam's strategic forces 
have not shifted their posture in a way 
that would point to an offensive. 
? There are numerous indications 
that the North Vietnamese are putting 
much of tiller energy into solving 
major economic problems and that 
they have given their highest priority 
to the repair of war damage in the 
North. 
Cut in supplies hinted 
Some analysts are convinced that 
while the Soviet Union and China 
continue to provide considerable mili-
tary and economic assistance to 
North Vietnam they have actually cut 
down on deliveries of military sup-
plies. 
These analysts are equally con-
vinced that if the North Vietnamese 
launch a major offensive they cannot 
count on having the Soviets and 
Chinese replace all their lost am-
munition and equipment. If these 
analysts are correct, the North Viet-
namese stand to gain more from a 
step-by-step approach to gaining con-
- trot in the South than they do from 
organizing an all-out offensive.

BANGKOK, Thailand 
(AP) ? The U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency has 
deposited nearly $3 million 
in Thai banks to cover full 
back pay of Thai, "volun-
teer" soldiers soon to be 
released from captivity in 
Laos, a government source 
reported today. 
The Pathet Lao are re-
ported ready to release 
some 640 'Thai mercenaries 
and one American civilian 
and the Laos government to 
free its North Vietnamese 
prisoners in an exchange 
scheduled for Sept. 19. 
Nearly 20,000 Thai merce-
naries ? recruited, sup-
ported and paid by the CIA 
? fought on the loyal Lao 
government side before the 
Laos peace agreement in 
February 1973. 
THE U.S. EMBASSY 
spokesman in Bangkok re-
fused to confirm or deny the 
reported compensation 
36 
plan. He referred questions 
to the Thai government be-
cause it was a matter in-
volving Thai prisoners. 
The government made no 
official statement on the 
pay question. But a govern-
ment source said the CIA 
has deposited $2.8S million 
In two Thai banks and each 
prisoner would get his 
monthly salary for time in 
captivity. 
One Western diplomatic 
source said privately that 
"the Americans believed 
they had a duty to provide 
some kind of compensation 
to these people, and they I 
are doing it." 
THE TWO LAOS sides 
are to exchange prisoner 
lists 48 hours before the 
scheduled exchange on the 
Plain of Jars, the Thai For-
eign Ministry said. 
The liberated Thais will 
be flown for debriefing to

Special to The Star-News 
SEOUL?The pistol shots 
that killed the wife of South 
Korean President Park 
Chung Hee also likely ended 
any hopes for an early 
relaxation of martial law 
government here. 
The attempt to assassi-
nate Park, as he made a na-
tionally televised Independ-
? ence Day address Aug. 15, 
is expected to preserve 
Park's virtual dictatorship 
and the strain it has created 
in South Korea's relations 
with Japan and the United 
? States. 
Only the day before the 
shooting, Japanese offi-
cials, in the words of one 
diplomat, "took very hard" 
the abrupt announcement 
? from Seoul that the Korean 
government had dropped its 
investigation of last year's 
kidnaping of Korean opposi-
tion leader Kim Dae Jung 
froin a Tokyo hotel. - 
Kim, a 49-year-old politi-
cian who narrowly lost the' 
1971 election to Park, disap-
peared for five days and 
then was freed in Seoul. 
Japanese police have linked 
at least One official of the 
Korean Embassy in Tokyo 
to the abduction scheme. 
THE SEOUL govern-
ment, however, announced 
Aug. 14 that their own probe 
of the incident was over 
with no charges being 
made. Kim Dae Jung, 
meantime, has not been al-
lowed to leave Korea and 
faces trial on alleged elec-
tion law violations in 1971. 
In the wake of the assas-
sination attempt, in which 
Mrs. Park and a 17-year-old 
choir girl were slain, the 
Park government tempo-
rarily prevented all Japa-
nese citizens and Koreans 
who live in Japan from 
leaving Korea. The deten-
tion stemmed from the 
apparent fact that Park's 
assailant, indentified at 
Mun.?Se Kwang, was a Ko-
rean who lived in Osaka, 
Japan, and traveled with a 
stolen Japanese passport, 
Though they were embar-
rassed by the involvement 
of a Japanese resident in 
the incident, Tokyo Foreign 
Ministry officials were far 
from pleased with the 
travel ban, especially since 
Kwang had been taken into 
custody immediately after 
the shooting. 
NEViERTHELESS, 
Prime Minister Kakuei 
Tanaka attended the funer-
al services last Saturday 
for Mrs. Park and later 
called on Park. The visit 
was seen as an indication of - 
Japanese concern over the 
worsening relations be-
tween Seoul and Tokyo. 
Tanaka's efforts, how-
ever, did do nothing to calm 
popular anti-Japanese feel-
ings among South Koreans. 
(About 3,000 South Ko-
reans demonstrated at the 
Japanese Embassy in Seoul 
today in the fourth straight 
day of protests. But Educa-
tion Minister Min Kwan-
shik, fearing a break in 
relations between Japan 
and Korea, called a meeting 
of high school principals 
after pupils joined the prp-
test and ordered a ban on 
future demonstrations, the 
Associated Press reported. 
(In Tokyo, Vice Foreign 
Minister Hisanari Yamada 
tried to ease the situation 
by saying his government 
regretted the assassination 
attempt. Japan was severe-
ly criticized in Seoul for an 
earlier statement attributed 
to Japanese Foreign Minis-
try sources that the Japa-
nese government had no 
legal or moral responsibil-
ity in the attempt.) 
In the United States, 
meantime, South Korea's 
image in Congress and at 
the State Department has 
appeared to rapidly deterio-
rate with the seemingly 
endless string of secret 
court-martial proceedings 
against opponents of the 
Park government. 
AMONG THE MORE 
than 170 people convicted 
were Korea's leading poet, 
Kim Chi Ha, a death sen-
tence commuted to life 
imprisonment; Catholic 
Bishop Daniel Chi, 15 
years; 77-year-old former 
President Yum Po Sun, 
three years' suspended; 
and an American-educated 
leading intellectual, Kim 
Dong Gil, 15 years. 
Only two days before the 
assassination attempt, the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee in Washington 
voted to cut in half the 
administration request for 
military aid to South Korea 
in fiscal year 1975. The re-
quest was reduced from 
$252 million to $123 million. 
Park, who has been presi-
, dent since 1961, gathered 
the strength of his present 
power by declaring martial 
law in late 1972 and then 
pushing a new constitution 
through a national referen-
dum under martial-law 
conditions. 
The new constitution _pro-
vides for emergency de-
crees of nearly unlimited 
power. Park invoked these 
on Jan. 8, 1974, providing up 
to life prison terms for such 
crimes as "spreading false 
rumors" against the gov-
ernment. He promised the 
death penalty for those 
engaging in anti-govern-
ment demonstrations. 
Diplomats in Seoul con-
sider Park a loner with a 
volatile temper but an indis-
putable talent for organiza-
tion and economic planning, 
"HE HAS an unswerving 
belief in his own mission. 
He thinks that something 
could be made of this coun-
try and that he's the one to 
do it,", a Park observer of 
some years commented. 
To date, the military has 
dutifully carried out the dis-
tasteful courts-martial, 
though there are some com-
plaints in private. There 
are few serious predictions, 
even by Park's opponents, 
of restlessness in the mili-
tary.? 
Kim Dee Jung, now under 
virtual house arrest, is one 
of those fearing the long-
range effect of Park's poli-
cies on South Korea's stand-
ing with other nations, part-
icularly Japan and the 
Unitec, States. 
Still mindful of the mili-
tary threat from North 
Korea, Kim told a recent 
visitor, "If we become iso-
lated, we couldn't maintain 
this country."

Quiet but significant initi-
atives are under way toward 
ending the 13 years of hos-
tile relations between the 
United States and Cuba. , 
Conciliatory signals are 
being flashed between 
Washington and Havana 
?through a variety of inter-
mediaries. Although these 
probes have been unofficial 
in nature, they are being 
monitored and evaluated at 
the highest levels in both 
capitals. 
The next development in 
what Latin American spe-
cialists here regard as a 
fast-moving though low-
keyed scenario is expected 
to. be a call for normaliza-
tion of relations between 
the . two countries by the 
prestigious Commission on 
U.S-Latin Ameritan Rela-
tions. 
That panel is composed of 
prominent businessmen, fi-
naneiers,?publishers and aca-
demic figures some of whom 
have, held high governmen-
tal policy jobs in Latin 
American affairs. It is 
headed by former Xerox 
Corp. board chairman Sol 
Linowitz, who served as the 
Johnson administration's 
anibassador to the Organiza-
tion of American States. 
. :Within the next few 
months. the council is ex-
pected to produce a wide-
ranging review of U.S. rela-
tions with Latin America 
that is bound to have consid-
erable impact on the Ford 
administration. 
"It is no secret that we 
are going to recommend 
normalization as fast as pos-
sible, although we've made 
no public statement to that 
effect," said one member of 
the council. "The only ques-' 
tion is whether we issue a 
statement now or wait until 
we are ready to issue the 
full report." 
. "The whole Latin Ameri-
can position on Cuba," said 
another participant in the 
work of the council, "is mov-
ing so fast that there is con-
siderable feeling we should 
-say something now or we'll 
be caught in an undertow of 
reaction." 
Officially, the position of 
the U.S. government is still 
to look upon Cuba as a revo-
lutionary pariah in the hem-
isphere. The line?from the 
lowliest desk officer to Sec-
retary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger?is that "no 
change" in U.S.-Cuban rela-
tions is. under way. Though 
this may be true, in the 
I most literal terms, it is far 
from the whole truth, 
Kissinger is known to 
have been aware of recent 
contacts by Americans with 
top Cuban ?officials, includ-
ing Premier Fidel Castro 
and his influential chief eco-
nomic adviser, Carlos Rafael 
Rodriguez. The Secretary of 
State is reliably reported to 
have given private encour-
agement to those contacts. 
Kissinger is . also. unde,e 
stood to have told both pri-
vate and governmental ac-
quaintances that, while he 
personally favors normaliza-
tion of relations with Cuba 
within the general frame-
work of ? detente diplomacy, . 
President Nixon was inflexi-
ble on the subject. 
With a new President in 
the White House the flexi-
bility quotient of the U.S. 
government is now thought 
to be much higher, and Kis-
singer's hand considerably 
freer. 
Castro, for his part, has 
expressed admiration in the 
recent interviews for Kis-
singer's ability and diplo-
matic Objectives. High-rank-
ing Cubans have recently 
told their American visitors 
that Kissinger's sympathetic 
attitude toward conciliation 
between the two countries 
has been relayed to them 
through second-party, offi-
cial channels such as Mexi-
can Foreign Minister Emilio 
Rabasa. 
Because of the sensitivity 
of the current contacts, few 
of those who have been as-
sociated with them are will-
ing to speak for-attribution. 
But the consensus of their 
'reporting is that Premier 
Castro has substantially low-
ered the temperature of Iis 
rhetoric toward the United 
States and softened the hea-
lic terms on which the Car-
ibbean cold war  
ended. 
The strongest public heti-
cation of. this was the reci-
findings of the Senate Fc.c-
eign Relations Conunitecee 
chief of staff, Pat M. Holt, a 
Latin America specialist, 
who concluded in his form al 
report to the committee' that 
"the Cubans are correct 
when they say . . . that the 
U.S. policy of isolating Cuba 
has been a failure. If this is 
so, then it follows that a 
new policy should be de-
vised." 
Holt, the a ut h or ? of a 
memo Foreign Relations 
Cbmmittee chairman J. W. 
Fulbright (D-Ark.) handed to 
President Kennedy in 1981 
opposing the Bay of Pigs in-
vasion attempt, is the high-
est-ranking U.S. official to 
have visited Cuba since the 
rupture of diplomatic rela-
tions that same year. ? 
In addition to the Holt 
trip, a 15-day visit to Cuba - 
was made last month by 
Kalman Silvert, who trav-
eled as a visiting New York 
University professor but is 
also a member of the Com-
mission on U.S.-Latin Amer-
ican Relations and Ford 
Foundation program adviser 
' for Latin America. Silvert is 
a former academic colleague 
of Kissinger's Latin Ameri-
can policy planning adviser 
Luigi Einaudi. 
And another unofficial 
journey to Havana , was 
made last month by a Wash-
ington-based television team 
led by Frank Mankiewicz, 
former Peace Corps director 
for Latin America and a so-
cial friend of Kissinger's. He 
was accompanied by his for-
mer Peace Corps' deputy, 
Kirby Jones, and film pro: 
ducer Saul Landau of the In-
stitute for Policy Studies 
whose work Castro person-
ally knows and admires. 
The Itlankiewcz team had 
a rare four-day filming ses-
sion with the Cuban leader 
during which he expressed 
his admiration for Kissinger 
and John I'. Kennedy, and 
r.111111(iai ed terms for rap-
prociaenea j1 
understood to

proachful terms than he has 
ever publicly slated them.

2slanid owl group upon 
which to lavish four days of 
per';onal ;.nteeview tirnc 
over the numerous reriu%.?Nts 
?.that pour into Havana for 
suchesessions cannot be con-
Sidered a matter of coinci-
dence. It suggests a strong 
desire .on his part at this 
time to -reach through the 
airwaves to Amirican public 
opinion. 
-During that interview Cas-
tro openly alluded to his. 
keen interest in U.S. opinion: 
in speaking of the hijacking 
agreement between Wash- ? 
ington and Havana. 
--We took an important. 
step when we signed the hi-
jacking agreement," Castro 
told Mankiewicz in the still-
Unpublished interview. '"We 
have no major airlines and 
the hijackings were hurting 
the United Statee, not us. 
The determining factor that 
led us to sign the agreement 
was really a concern for in-
ternational public opinion?. 
for the people of the United 
States." 
Cuba, Castro has repeat- 1 
edly said, is waiting for the 
United States to take steps 
that will include ending the 
economic blockade launched. - 
by the Kennedy administra-
tion at the height of bad 
feeling between the two 
countries. ? 
Castro and his principal 
advisers haVe been' telling 
American visitors -that, from 
Cuba's standpoint, the -chief 
impediment to normaliza-
tion is the trade blockade di-
rected from Washington and 
carried out?with only pan: 
tial success?through U.S. 
trading partners. 
The official rationale for., 
the trade embargo, which 
was adopted by the ?United 
States in 1962 and by the 
OAS under heavy U.S. prod-
ding in 1964 was to retaliate 
against Havana's campaign 
of revolutionary insurgency 
elsewhere in Latin America. - 
It is conceded openly by 
U.S. officials and guardedly , 
by the Cubans that Havana 
has since 7968 abandoned its 
efforts to export its revolu-
tion and instead sought to 
play the role of a showcat:e 
socialist state. depending 
heavily on the .tiovie.

'Latin America has been at a 
minimum, one might say -a 
trival level for years in 
other than an ideological 
sense." , 
As long ago as 1971 Castro 
proclaimed in a visit to 
Chile that there is "more 
than one road" to economic 
development and that each 
country must find its own 
? road. Since Cuba abandoned 
the course of external revo-
lutionary insurgency, as 
symbolized by the late Er-
nesto (Che) Guevara, rela-
tions have progressively , 
warmed between Havana 
and many of its Latin Amer-
ican neighbors. 
Today there are prospects, 
considered by regional ex-
perts to be quite imminent, 
that Venezuela and Colom-
bia will soon join the ranks 
of countries in the hemi-
sphere that have restored 
full diplomatic relations 
with Cuba. The most recent 
was Panama, which resumed 
relations on Tuesday. 
It is expected that by the 
end of the year there may 
be only a handful of hold-
outs, such as Bolivia, Chile, 
Guatemala .and Nicaragua. 
WASHINGTON POST 
29 August 1974 
Although " the. blockade 
has failed to prevent a grow-
ing Cuban trade with such 
capitalist partners as 
France, England, ditaly, 
Spain, - Canada, and Japan?
and most recently with U.S. 
auto subsidiaries in Argen-
tina?it has cost the Cubans 
dearly in the form of astre;

, Since freighters calling on 
Cuban ports are automati-

American ports the Cubans 
have had to charter ships 
both for import and export 
of goods. This has led - td 
staggering transportation 
costs, which would be allevi-
ated with a relaxation of the 
embargo. 
Without continuing Soviet 
aid to the tune of, some $600

Cuba Stance Eased 
By Laurence Stern and Marilyn Berger' .d 
Washington Post Staff Writers 
? President Ford yesterday signaled a sig-
nificant softening in the oft-repeated pub-
lic U.S. stand opposing a relaxation of eco-
nomic and political sanctions against 
Cuba. 
The President laid heavy stress on U.S. 
action "in concert with" members of the 
Organization of American States, where 
- there has been a strong surge of support 
for ending the 1964 hemispheric sanctions 
against the Cubans. 
Official analysts here concede that as 
many as two-thirds of the OAS permanent 
council. ? certainly a majority ? are now 
prepared to vote for an end to the eco-
nomic blockade and support restoration of 
diplomatic relations with Havana. 
OAS Secretary-General Gab o Plaza of 
Ecuador acclaimed Mr. Ford's statement 
? on Cuba and observed that "it is clear that 
a majority of the countries [in OAS} are 
now willing to lift the sanctions against 
Cuba." 
He added that it is "highly satisfying to 
hear that President Ford intends to act 
through the mechanisms of the OAS." 
The President said that U.S. policy to-
ward Cuba "is determined by the sanc-
tions voted by the Organization of Ameri-
can States, and we abide by those actions 
that were taken by the members of that 
organization." 
He also said that the United States 
would exercise the option "to change our 
policy" if, as he put it, "Cuba changes its 
policy toward us and toward its Latin 
neighbors." In pursuing any such action, 
he added, "we would certainly act in con-
cert with the other members" of the OAS. 
It is widely ceneeded at official levels 
in Washinetun that. the Cubans long ago 
abandoned the effoet to exuort_socigist 
ApproVed FOr e e 
1 .remote dependency in Ha-
vana. ? 
? And so the extension of 
'the '.spirit of detente to the! 
? Caribbean could provide tri-
angular benefits, as analysts 
? of the region see it,--to Cuba, 
the Soviet -Union' and the 
United States. ., 
? Politically, the full retuao 
of Cuba to the inter-Ameri-
can family has become an 
important symbol and rally-
ing cry for the. concept of 
regional sovereignty and in-
dependence of U.S. influ-
,ence. 
Mexican ? President Luis 
Echeverria has been 'cam-
paigning for admission of 
Cuba to the conference of 
Latin foreign ministers, 
whatever Washington might 
think of such a move. Echev-
erria and other Latin lead-
ers see the foreign minis. 
ters' conference \ as an alter-
native political body to the 
OAS, which is. widely per-
ceived as a Washington-dom-
inated 'forum. 
Kissinger this year took 
an adroitly ambiguous stand 
on Cuban participation in 
the next foreign ministers' 
meeting?an indication, in 
itself, of a. new "flexibility" 
revolution elsewhere in the hemisphere. 
The chief political justification for the 
1.964 sanctions was to repel the spread of 
insurrectionary socialist movements from 
Havana to other Latin American coun-
tries. 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger 
In the past has suggested to Latin Ameri-
can foreign ministers that they not rush 
the Cuban issue to confrontation. 
There was also apprehensiveness within 
the administration about the effect of an 
abrupt reversal on Cuban policy before 
the November elections. Mr. Ford's state-
ment yesterday was the first hint of a new 
flexibility on the question. 
OAS Secretary-General Plaza 
Indicated yesterday that there 
'aas been strong pressure with-
In the OAS for a meeting of 
the permanent council within 
:he next two months to deal 
with the Cuban question. - 
The foreign ministers of 
Costa Rica, Venezuela and 
Columbia have been press-
ing for OAS action designed 
to normalize Cuba's political 
place in the hemisphere. 
Venezuela was the initiator 
of the 1964 motion in the 
OAS to impose the sanctions 
against Havana. 
Panama quietly last week 
sent a full diplomatic mis-
sion to Havana, ending the 
10-year rupture of relations 
with Cuba. This action is ex-
pected to be followed by 
other moves to restore dip-
lomatic relations. 
While most of the ques-
tions at the press confer-
ence involved domestic af-
fairs, President Ford dealt 
with several other foreign 
policy issues. 
toward Cuba' in. Washington.' 
The traditional response: 
would have been head-on op-' 
position. 
The key to the future of 
relations with Cuba is, of 
course, in the hands of Pres-
- ident Ford and his prospec-
tive Vice President, Nelson 
A. Rockefeller?a man who 
over the years has demon-
strated a more than passing 
interest in Latin America-
with its vast Rockefeller 
holdings in oil and land. 
The issue of Cuba is re-
plete Niiith unknown; if not 
dubious, benefits to a Re- ? 
publican President. During 
the .Nixon presidency the 
bureaucratic folklo...?e in 
Foggy Bottotn was that any 
move toward mellowing U.S 
relations with Cuba would 
have been blocked because 
of Mr. Nixon's friendship 
with C. G. (Bebe) Reboso, 
0 was probably the nue-- t. 
influential of all Cuban ex-
patriates. 
Whatever the answer, .the 
betting is that Kissinger will 
now have more leverage for 
whatever his objectives may 
be toward Cuba than ever 
before in his six years in . 
Washington. 
fort is under way to develop 
al.T.S. position for the next 
round of Strategic Arms 
Limitation Talks. Pentagon 
and State Department offi-
cials said negotiations will 
resume in Geneva in the 
second half of September. 
The President said that 
there is now "an effort be-
ing made to bring the De-
partment of Defense, the 
State Department and oth-
ers together for a resolution 
of...the United States posi-
tion regarding SALT II. 
This decision will be made 
in the relatively near future. 
I don't think there is any 
basic difficulty :that cannot 
be resolved internally 
within our government." 
Differences were known 
to have existed between Sec-
retary of State Kissinger 
and De f en se Secretary 
James R. Schlesinger as to 
the timing and tactics on a 
SALT agreement prior to 
the last Moscow summit. 
These were superseded by 
the decision to conclude a 
10-year agreement. Adminis-
tration officials say the cur-
rent discussions within 'the 
U.S. government have not 
reached a point where 
there are fixed departmen-
tal positions that require a 
presidential decision. 
President Ford said Kis-
sineer would be meeting with 
representatives from the So-
viet Union "in the near future, 
I think in October." This was 
a reference to a trip Kissinger

prospects for a SALT agree-

Kissinger told reporters yes-
terday that he is also consider-
ing a brief separate trip to the 
Middle East in mid-October, 
before the Soviet visit, to ex-
pediate negotiations toward a 
settlement there. That trip, to 
unspecified Middle East capi-
tals, would follow talks here 
with Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin and meetings 
with various foreign ministers 
in September at the time of 
the opening of the U.N. Gen-
eral Assembly. 
The President yesterday 
WASHINGTON POST 
01 September 1374 
Jack Anderson and Les Whitten 
sidestepped a question about 
moving the U.S. embassy in Is-
rael from Tel Aviv to Jerusa-
lem, a suggestion he had made 
in 1972. 
"Under the current circum-
stance and the importance of 
getting a just and lasting 
peace in the Middle East," he 
said, "I think that particular 
proposal ought to stand aside. 
We must come up with some 
answers between Israel and 
the Arab nations in order to 
achieve a peace that is both 
fair and durable." 
Detenie and the Cuban Commandos 
v 
If the U.S. starts doing business with 
Fidel Castro's Cuba; as is expected 
within tht, next six months, CIA.-
trained, anti-Castro commandos will 
turn their deadly skills against the 
T.J.S. 
1. his is the vow of commando lead-
ers, who have threatened- to launch a 
'campaign of terror in theU.S. like the 
Irish militants have been waging 
against the British. 
- For 13 years, these commandos have 
risked their lives raiding Cuba. They. 
have lest comrades who have been 
'killed and captured by Castro' S militia. 
New they see the U.S. preparing to em-
brace the hated dictator they have 
been fighting. ? 
We spent a week in Miamitalking to 
'Cuban leaders and checking into the 
terrorism that has already erupted in 
he Cuban community. 
"If the U.S. recognizes Castro," said 
one leader grimly, "we will look upon 
the U.S. as our enemy." 
Another threatened: "If the U.S. 
. Won't let us fight Castro in Cuba, we 
will fight Castro here." 
' Others predicted assassinations, 
bombings and sabotage against Amen-
car ?congressmen and businessmen 
Who support a Cuban-American thaw. 
One described the coming terror cam-
paign menacingly as "civil war." 
Cuban commandos boasted that they 
have already shot up the door .of the 
FBI's Miami office, have blown up the 
car of an FBI informant and have tried 
to run aown an FBI agent. 
U.S. authorities discount most of the 
talk as bravado. They acknowledge 
that the Cuban community has been 
hit by a dozen or more bombings, in-
cluding the car of an alleged FBI in-
formant. But the explosions have been 
small. with no casualties. 
? Cubans ,vho are considered soft on 
Castro have also received threats on 
their lives. For example, storekeepers 
who sell a controversial Cuban news 
magazine have been threatened. 
Although the commandos told us 
they shut up the FBI. entrance with a 
.45 revolver, the authorities claim the 
weapon couldn't have been larger than 
a small .22 pistol. It is even possible, 
they say, that the damage was caused 
by teenagers throwing rocks. 
There is no denying, however, that 
the FBI's Cuban intelligence specialist 
had to dive over hushes to avoid being 
run do % n by an automobile that whip-
pe around a corner and speeded 
straignt for him. 
The FBI contacted in Miami, had no 
comment on these incidents. 
Miami's quietly. competent Mayor 
Maurice Ferre acknowledged that a 
terror - canspaign is "definitely possi-
ble" in case the U.S. should restore of-
ficial tit s with Castro. 
'Feelings run deep enough," he said, 
. to cause Cuban militants to take des-
perate measures. could be like Ire-
land," he agreed. But he also said? Cu-
ban leaders have a tendency to over-
dramatize. 
-? Although he confirmed terrorism in 
the Cuban community "undoubtedly is 
?going on," he !misted it has been 
"greatly exaggerated." Most Cubans, 
he said, are law-abiding and grateful 
for the haven that the U.S. has pro-
vided them. ' 
There are an estimated one million 
Cubans scattered across the U.S., with 
about half of them concentrated in the 
Miami area. They have formed several 
dozen anti-Castro organizations. The 
pattern, explained one official, "is for 
the members of the group to fight, 
.,,fragment, and form new splinter 
groups" Less than half a dozen organi-
zations are effective, U.S. authorities 
estimate. 
vet hundreds of Cubans have been 
trained by the CIA in the military arts. 
They are skilled in handling guns and 
bombs; they are ready to strike swiftly 
and silently. It would be ironic if they 
should now use their schooling in vio-
lence against the government that 
trained them. 
Yet we spoke to CIA-trained Cubans 
who swore they would fight anyone 
who aevocates rapprochement with 
Castro. This is now expected to be 
President Ford's first major foreign 
policy move. 
Sources close to Secretary of State 
Henry .'Kissinger say he has wanted to 
normalize relations with Cuba ever 
sirce he began practicing detente di-
plcmacy. It made no sense to him to 
seek friendship with Russia and China 
on the opposite side of the globe and 
remain nostile to Cuba only 90 miles 
from our shores. 
Kissinger was blocked from improv-
ing relations with Havana, our sources 
claim, by former President Nixon who 
had an abiding hatred for Castro. This' 
personal animoAty 'dated back to an 
audience that Nixon, as Vice Presi-
:4 0 
dent, granted Castro in 1959.- 
Castro came away from the visit, he 
COI fided afterward, feeling it had been 
friendly But Nixon told friends after-
ward that the interview had solidified 
his hatred of the Cuban dictator. ? 
Nixon reportedly was also influenced 
by his best friend, Bebe Rebozo, an 
American-born Cuban who is strongly 
anti-Castro. 
With Nixon in seclusion at San Cle-
mente and Ford now in charge of the 
White House, Kissinger is believed to 
have a oetter chance to work his way. 
The new President is inexperienced in 
foreign affairs and is expected to rely 
heavily on Kissinger's advice. 
The Secretary of State has already 
sent signals to Havana through inter-fl that he would like to im-
prove relations. Castro has responded 
favorably. Commenting on the official 
U.S. attitude toward Cuba, Castro told 
a Kissinger friend; Frank Mankiewicz, 
recently: "Cuba is the only country in 
the world where John Foster Dulles is 
still Secreatary of State." 
The cold war has ended, Castro 
pointed out, everywhere except be-
tween the U.S. and Cuba. But now, in 
response to Kissinger's overtures, the 
newspapers and radio stations in Cuba 
have toned down their attacks on the 
U.S. 
One iv one, Argentina, Barbados, 
Guyana, Jamaica, Panama, Peru and 
Trinidad-Tobago have established dip-
lomatic relations with -Cuba in defi-
ance of the U.S.-imposed ban. Colum-
bin, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras 
and Venezuela are getting in line. Not 
far behind them is the U.S. itself. 
Footnote: Mankiewicz spent several 
days with Castro, filming his daily ac-
tivities for a TV documentary. Mank-
iewicz found the Cuban leader to be 
immensely popular with his people. 
Castro drives his own jeep through the 
Havana traffic, acknowledging the 
friendly greetings of his fellow motor-
ists. 
Once they stopped at a restaurant in 
the outskirts of Havana. There was 
frienily banter between Castro and 
the waiters. "Tell these people that if 
they won't serve us lunch," he joked to 
an aide. "we'll lower their prices."
