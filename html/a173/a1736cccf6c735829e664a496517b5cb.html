 [From Newsweek magazine, Apr. 26, 1965]
 THE TEST IN VIETNAM
 (By Walter Lippmann)
 The President's Baltimore address on Viet-
 nam marked a certain change in our official
 policy.  For the first time he offered to en-
 gage in discussions with Hanoi without re-
 serving the right to refuse discussions unless
 certain conditions (which were not specifical-
 ly stated) were met first.
 Although this opened the door a little for
 discussions, there is no reason to expect a
 diplomatic settlement of the Vietnamese war
 in the near future.  For the time being the
 outcome in Vietnam is being determined by
 the course of the war itself, and there is no
 disposition as yet on either side to avoid a
 military showdown.
 The scene of the showdown has been and,
 it seems certain, will continue to be in South
 Vietnam.   It will be a showdown between
 the government in Saigon which we are sup-
 porting and the Vietcong which Hanoi is
 supporting.   The  issue hangs  on whether
 there can be a government in Saigon which is
 able to subdue the Vietcong rebellion, pacify
 the countryside, and get itself accepted by
 the preponderant mass of the people in the
 greater part of South Vietnam.  There is now
 no such government in Saigon.   As a matter
 of fact, the Saigon Government is in a critical
 position, having lost control of a large part
 of the countryside by day, of an even larger
 part at night.
 The United States has been committed,
 and never more strongly than by the Presi-
 dent at Baltimore, to reversing the military
 trend in South Vietnam.  The President has
 'undertaken to make the Saigon Government,
 which is near to defeat and collapse, into the
 victor in the civil war. This will take a
 lot of doing, but the administration has de-
 cided that it will be possible to defeat the
 Vietcong in South Vietnam if it is deprived,
 as the President put it, "of the trained mqn
 and supplies, orders and arms," which "flow
 in a constant stream from north to south.
 This support is the heartbeat of the war."
 THE OFFICIAL THEORY
 This is the basis of the policy adopted in
 early February, of putting increasing pres-
 sure on North Vietnam by bombings which
 creep nearer and nearer to the highly popu-
 lated and industrialized centers around Ha-
 noi and Haiphong.  The official theory is that
 by these bombings we can deter Hanoi from
 supporting the civil war in the south and
 even force Hanoi to force the Vietcong to ask
 for peace, especially since we are offering an
 attractive economic future if they do this.
 We hope also that the bombings in the north
 will inspire and enable the Saigon Govern-
 ment to rally the people and to win the
 war.
 We are now embarked on a crucial test of
 this theory.  Can the Saigon Government win
 the civil war while we attack the Hanoi Gov-
 ernment?  The outcome of this test de

 .they can endure.  Looking at it in a cold-
 blooded way, this  is a test of a military
 theory.  For my part, I am inclined to think
 that Hanoi will endure all the punishment
 that we dare to inflict.
 BOMBING CAN'T WIN
 I am assuming that we dare not and will
 not devastate the cities of North Vietnam
 and kill great masses of their people.  I am
 assuming that we shall not do this because
 we are too civilized, and also because the re-
 action to such cruelty, would be incalculable
 in every continent.
 The relatively moderate punishment we
 are inflicting we shall probably continue to
 inflict.  I believe it will not force the North
 Vietnamese to their knees.   They are, we
 must remember, a country of peasants. Their
 industries are comparatively primitive, and
 their capacity to do without the products of
 their industries is quite different from that,
 let  us  say,  of  a  well-to-do,  middle-class
 American community in an affluent suburb.
 Provided they get some food., which they
 can from China, they are not likely to quit
 and to do what we might want because their
 powerplants and bridges and factories are
 demolished.  What they are likely to do if we
 make the north increasingly uninhabitable is
 to go south into South Vietnam.
 So, experience may show that our official
 theory of the war is unworkable.  If it does,
 we shall have to do what we have already
 done several times in the coure of our en-
 tanglement in southeast Asia.  We shall have
 to change our minds.  This is always a pain-
 ful process, especially in a big, proud coun-
 try.           But it may have to be done, and it
 will be done best if we keep the problem
 open to free and resolute public debate.

 SOUTH VIETNAM CONSIDERS WEAKENING LAND

 OWNERS CAN HOLD-STIPULATION WOULD BE
 THAT THEY          Hucs OUTPUT    WITH  MODERN
 METHODS-REACTION BY UNITED  STATES Is
 MIXED
 (By Richard Dudm.an)
 SAIGON, SOUTH     VIETNAM,       April  1.-The
 Government of South Vietnam is consider-
 ing weakening a key provision of its land re-
 form program.  United States officials here
 are thought to be giving the controversial
 proposal some encouragement.  They con-
 sider it premature but believe it has some
 merit.
 The provision in question is the current
 limit of 100 hectares (247 acres) on what a
 single landowner may hold.  Holdings be-
 yond that amount are supposed to be sold
 to the government and then sold to landless
 peasants on a time payment plan in plots of
 three to five hectares.
 The  Minister  of  Rural  Affairs,  Nguyen
 Ngoc To, told the Post-Dispatch he thinks
 it may be advisable to increase this limit to
 200 or even to 1,000 hectares.  He said that
 the higher limit would apply only to the
 owners who agreed to use modern machines
 and fertilizers to increase their crop produc-
 tion.
 Some Americans and Vietnamese familiar
 with the land problem here are outraged
 over the proposed increase.  They contend
 that it is given in to pressure by the big
 landowners,  who  have  been  powerful  in
 every regime since Vietnam won its inde-
 pendence 11 years ago.                     Critics argue that
 the Vietcong always poses as the protector
 of the peasant and would capitalize on the
 change in propaganda.
 Asked about the origin of the proposal,
 To said that many farmers had asked that
 the limit be increased because they wanted
 more land for cultivation.  He said it would
 be politically useful to satisfy these land-
 owners.  He observed that the big landown-
 ers are better educated than the .peasants                                                                            the use of American jet bombers against tar-

 a major war.  The possibility of a nuclear war

 Our present policy, instead of preventing
 the spread of communism, has bad the effect
 of alienating the people of South Vietnam
 and of other southeast Asian countries.
 Mr. President, we urge you to halt the war
 in  Vietnam  by  initiating  the  following
 courses of action:
 The United States should cease its attacks
 on North Vietnam.
 A conference of all parties to the conflict
 in Vietnam should be convened to negotiate a
 political settlement in Vietnam.
 To prevent a repetition of the tragedy of
 Vietnam, an international conference should
 develop guidelines for the peaceful settlement
 of disputes throughout southeast Asia.

 CONCERN ON VIETNAM OF MEMBERS OFSOUTH-
 AMPTON MONTHLY MEETING  OF FRIENDS
 In his speech of April 7 our President has
 pointed out certain goals of our presence in
 Vietnam with which we are in cordial agree-
 ment.  He has stated that, in that country,
 we seek nothing for ourselves--only that the
 people of South Vietnam be allowed to guide
 their own country in their own way.  He
 has, furthermore, mapped out a great pro-
 gram of development in southeast Asia which
 might permit us, in close cooperation with
 the other nations of the world, to heal the
 scars of war, to improve the conditions of
 life, and to replace enmity with cooperation
 for the common good.  He has, finally, an-
 nounced our readiness for "unconditional
 discussions" as a way toward terminating
 the bloodshed  and destruction which are
 now engulfing not only South Vietnam but,
 through our bombing forays, North Vietnam
 as well.

 April 21, 1965           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 I
 We are in full agreement with these ob-
 jectives and this approach and urge our rep-
 resentatives in Congress and the departments
 of our Government to give them their un-
 stinting support.  However, we submit that
 not only our declarations, but also our ac-
 tions, must change if the desired goals are to
 be realized.  Specifically,
 1. We. must halt our bombing raids on
 North Vietnam, which have been extended
 increasingly  to   civilian  objectives-roads,
 railroads, powerplants, bridges-with a hu-
 man  toll                             which  is  unknown to us.       The
 wanton destruction of the fruits of       hard
 labor in a country which is not rich will
 not convince its inhabitants of American in-
 terest in their welfare, but only spread the
 notion that "the American invader is the
 enemy of the people."
 2. We must include the National Libera-
 tion Front or the Vietcong in our openness
 for unconditional discussions.   Whether it
 is a creature of North Vietnam, as our State
 Department has contended,  or a broadly
 based nationalist movement comparable to
 the French resistance in the Second World
 War, as Shunichi Matsumoto, investigator
 for the Japanese Government, a firm sup-
 porter of our policies, has found, the immedi-
 ate conflict in South Vietnam is between the
 National Liberation Front and Vietcong on
 the one hand  and  the  South Vietnamese,
 Government and American forces on the
 other.  If the killing in South Vietnam is to
 stop, a cease-fire must be arranged by con-
 sultation between these two groups.  A final
 settlement will without doubt have to be
 reached  by  negotiations  which would  in-
 clude North Vietnam and the broad range
 of nations with interests in southeast Asia.
 Our goals in these negotiations have been
 spelled out by the President.    Presumably
 they would include the withdrawal of out-
 side military forces from South Vietnam, and
 the holding of elections under the supervi-
 sion of International Control Commission or
 United Nations teams to ascertain the man-
 ner in which the people of South Vietnam
 desired to be governed.  We must contem-
 plate the possibility that, if these elections
 are truly free, they may express the desire
 of the people of South Vietnam to be re-
 united with their brothers in North Vietnam
 under a government with primarily Com-
 munist orientation.  The force of nationalism
 would seem to render such an outcome prob-
 able unless Vietcong terror has alienated the
 people even more than American bombings,
 burning s, and gas. Yet, if we are true to our
 word, we must abide by the outcome, what-
 ever it is,  Doing so, we will support the
 cause of law in the world, enhance confidence
 in American motives, and strengthen our
 sense of national purpose and leadership.
 We shall have demonstrated that respect for
 the dignity of the human person which we
 seek to have acknowledged everywhere.

 FRESNO, CALIF.,

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 HONORABLE SIR: I deeply appreciate your
 opinion on the war in Vietnam.  And I feel
 that the Nation owes you a debt of gratitude
 for daring to state-It in the face of almost
 unanimous opposition.
 I am a registered Republican because I
 think we,need.an opposition party. But alas,
 on at least three major issues that are de-
 stroying our Nation, and our civilization
 (war, liquor, and finance) there is no longer
 any difference between the two parties.  This
 means that we are fast becoming a one-party
 government.  And one-party government in-
 evitably becomes a dictatorship.
 What to do about it?  If reactionary Re-
 publicans continue to rule the party, the die
 is already cast.  An effective coalition of con-
 servatives and liberals is impossible.  This
 seems to leave a new party, with new leader-
 ship, as the only hope.                                                                                   The last election
 showed that the voters no longer merely rub-
 ber stamp the party label.                                                                              So I am convinced
 the time for an independent party is now.
 But the fiction is out which says "third
 parties cannot win."  In 1860 the Republi-
 cans won as a third party.  With intelligent
 leadership it might happen again in 1968.
 The need is fully as great as in 1860.  I be-
 lieve all we need is leadership.  But time is
 running out. So hurry.
 Sincerely yours,
 Rev. W. R. WILLIAMs.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:                              I am  counting on
 you to step up your pressure against our
 stupid policy in Vietnam.  I do not in any
 way wish to be classed as being the same
 group as the so-called leftist student demon-
 stration,  but  someone  must try  to bring
 some sanity to our foreign policy, Let us stop
 bombing North  Vietnam.   Let  us  defend
 South Vietnam so long as necessary, but by
 all means let us avoid the possible confron-
 tation with Russia in North Vietnam.                                                                                        We
 should rather be weaning Russia away still
 farther from China, not throwing them in
 each other's arms.
 Also may request your concern over the
 possible strike.  One more problem would be
 too much.  May I urge Federal intervention
 if necessary.
 Sincerely,
 WOODLAND HILLS, CALIF.,
 April 14, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I Support fully your
 position on the war in Vietnam.  Continua-
 tion of the war is not only destroying life
 and'property in Vietnam, and turning peo-
 ples in the underdeveloped nations against
 the United States, but is also eroding democ-
 racy  here.   It  is  becoming                                                                                    commonplace
 for the Government to manage and distort
 news, and lie to the people.  Your efforts to
 penetrate the blanket of mass media distor-
 tion are a great service to the preservation of
 peace and democracy around the world.
 Sincerely,
 ST. Louis, Mo.,
 April 15, 1965.
 DEAR MR. MORSE: You are putting your fin-
 ger on the meaningful point when you say
 that the war in Vietnam is not the American
 people's war.  We were given a choice only
 between Johnson and Goldwater by the pro-
 fessional political organizations financed by
 big business which choose the candidates.
 This is little choice, and I frequently heard
 the opinion expressed during the campaigns
 that it was choice between the lesser of two
 evils.
 It turned out that the candidates were per-
 fectly  agreed  on  foreign  policy,  or more
 likely, that  both were  committed  to the
 same foreign policy laid down for them by
 the big business men who financed both
 campaigns.    Goldwater Said frankly that he
 intended to escalate the Asian war, while
 Johnson kept his mouth shut except to chew
 barbecue, and the result was that Goldwater
 was buried for his frankness.  He said John-
 son was the biggest phony in Washington,
 and now we know in our hearts that the
 general was right about that, anyway.
 The hot and cold wars through which the
 taxpayers have been bilked of huge sums
 annually for years are for the financial bene-
 fit of big business thriving on Government
 contracts.  It is the representatives of big
 business who really run this country because
 they support both political parties.  Their
 greed for profits has increased our national
 debt to topheaviness dangerous to our econ-
 omy, and has destroyed our freedom under
 the pretense of protecting it from commu-
 nism.  The American voters no longer have
 much say about how their country is run, as
 witness the war.
 Johnson ought to be impeached for the
 Bobby Baker affair.

 Hon. SENATORS CHURCH, GRUENING, MCGOV-
 ERN, and MORSE,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATORS: Although I am not one of
 your constituents I wish to commend the
 strong stand you have taken against the of-
 ficial policy on Vietnam.
 It seems that the preelection talk of being
 a "peace President" has been replaced by
 acquiescence in the plots of our military es-
 tablishment.   Instead of a sane, realistic,
 compassionate policy toward the people of
 southeast Asia, we have regressed into a sav-
 age play for power, which will make us the
 most hated nation on earth, if indeed, the
 whole earth is not destroyed as the result
 of our cruel stupidity.
 The $3 billion spent fQr war in that area
 should have been used for the Mekong River
 development and other such projects.  It's
 not too late to admit our mistakes, and call
 on all concerned to meet under U.N. super-
 vision to work out a humanitarian settle-
 ment.
 Maybe China needs help with a hydroelec-
 tric project, too.
 I feel that what we do in the next few days
 will ruin or strengthen the U.N. depending
 on  whether we  act  outside  or  inside  its
 "good offices." The press of many countries
 reflects a loss of faith in our integrity, and
 fitness for leadership.
 May you continue your good work.

 you can support the suggestion contained
 therein, a formula for ending the fighting

 I should also be most grateful to get your
 considered reaction to the proposal.
 Yours most sincerely,

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Although your recent
 offer to negotiate unconditionally with North
 Vietnam was one of the most morally im-
 pressive utterances ever made by an Amer-
 ican statesman, it is now apparent that we
 must  go further if  we want to end  the
 destruction of human lives and the possibil-
 ity that the conflict might escalate beyond
 control.
 The proposal outlined below could further
 strengthen our moral case, prevent further
 damage to the Soviet-American rapproache-
 ment, reinforce the U.N., shift the struggle

 in Vietnam from the battlefield to the ballot
 box, and yet safeguard our aims, interests,
 and friends in Asia and elsewhere.
 I propose that we induce the Saigon gov-
 ernment and the Vietcong to agree on the
 following terms:
 1. An immediate cease-fire;
 2. Temporary occupation of South Viet-
 nam by a neutral force, assembled either by
 the U.N. or by an ad hoc grouping of neutral
 .powers and consisting of troops and general
 officers from countries acceptable to both
 the government and the insurgents;
 3. Surrender of all arms by the govern-
 ment and the insurgents to the occupying
 command;
 4. Withdrawal  of  all  American,  Soviet,
 Chinese, and North Vietnamese personnel to
 points   outside the   borders of  South
 Vietnam;
 5. Assignment by the Saigon government
 and by the Vietcong of their fighting men in
 equal numbers to the occupying command
 which would proceed to form mixed mili-
 tary units consisting half of government and
 half of Vietcong personnel;
 6. The gradual  phasing  out of  troops
 from the neutral countries and the replace-
 ment of them by the mixed units which
 would operate under either a Neutral or a
 U.N.  Command  and  retain  an absolute
 monopoly on military equipment;
 7. Division of Vietnam into electoral dis-
 tricts equal in population for the election of
 delegates  to  a constitutional convention
 which would frame a constitution stipulating
 that there shall be:  (a)  elections every 2
 years, (b) guarantees that all parties are to
 have complete freedom to participate in elec-
 tion campaigns, (c) a provision similar to ar-
 ticle 9 of the Japanese Constitution, an ar-
 ticle which would renounce war as an instru-
 ment of the foreign policy of South Vietnam
 and would prohibit government authorities
 from ever raising an armed force exceeding
 that required for legitimate Internal police
 functions (which would continue to be sub-
 ject to supervision by the U.N. or the ad hoc
 grouping of neutral powers) ;
 8. Massive economic and technical aid to
 South Vietnam, and possibly also to North
 Vietnam, through the joint efforts of the
 United States, the Soviet Union, and perhaps
 the United Nations.
 I beg you prayerfully to consider this pro-
 posal which might conceivably end the dan-
 ger of the eruption of World War 111.
 Yours most sincerely,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am a resident of the

 opportunity  of  casting  a  vote  for  you.
 However, I feel that you are representing
 me.
 I have written to my New York Senators
 urging them to speak out in opposition to
 the present policy on Vietnam.  I shall con-
 tinue to express my belief that our present
 policy is a wrong and dangerous one.
 However, I felt that I did want to express
 my gratitude to you for your forthright posi-
 tion.                       You are really acting in the beat in-

 DEAa SIR: As our son goes to Washington,
 D.C. to visit you with a number of like-
 minded young people, I thought of'asking
 you again to discontinue the U':S. self-sub-
 scribed role in Vietnam, that of fighting.
 The 1954 Geneva Conference held the an-
 swers for today's conflict there.  Initiate an
 official cease-fire there now, to reduce the
 present tension there, here, and abroad.
 Promote a plebescite in Vietnam under V.N.
 auspices.
 Pave the way for worldwide disarmament
 achievement, and withdraw all foreign troops
 everywhere.
 I am glad to see the growing number of
 Congressmen in favor of withdrawing men
 and materials from Vietnam and looking to-
 ward a peaceful solution.
 Thank you,
 Sincerely,
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: In my ninth grade
 social studies class, we have been discussing
 the crisis America faces in South Vietnam.
 I favor military withdrawal from this na-
 tion with continued economic aid.  From our
 discussion,  it  has  become  apparent  that
 Americans must think it a sacrilege to ques-
 tion their Nation's actions in a conflict that
 theoretically could become global. It is a
 frightening thought to think that the United
 States may be precipitating a far greater war
 by carrying the conflict across South Viet-
 nam's border.
 Another thing that makes this war an
 enigma is its nondeflnition.  Although Presi-
 dent Johnson delivered an address to define
 the war in Vietnam, I feel certain that his
 nebulous terms and assorted tangents did
 not placate the parents of those who have
 been lost or killed, nor did his speech en-
 lighten the public greatly.  The talk only
 reiterated  the  American  obligation  and

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I would like to ex-
 press my approval of your stand on the
 U.S. position in Vietnam, and urge you to
 continue speaking out on important issues.
 It was a statement of yours that sent me
 to the library to read all I could find on
 southeast Asia and  to inquire as to how
 this country became involved there.  All the
 information that I could find leads to a
 confirmation that our country's position Is
 morally wrong. President Eisenhower's posi-
 tion was wrong, President Kennedy's posi-
 tion was wrong; President Johnson's position
 is unconscionable.  We who lov?'our country
 would, as Dr. Pauling said, like to see her
 near the top in the listing of moral nations
 instead of near the bottom of the list.
 Judging from the letters to the editors in
 our local newspaper, there must be many
 more people than myself who feel that our
 policy in Vietnam Is shameful and should
 April 21, 1965
 be altered.  An editorial in support of Gov-
 ernment policy on Vietnam brings a spate of
 letters lucidly spelling out our errors in that
 area.
 It seems to me that a foreign policy that
 isolates our Nation from contact with up-
 ward of a  billion people  (i.e., China and
 Russia) and seems to depend more and more
 on  warlike actions  and Intimidation  by
 threats of nuclear war to maintain it's posi-
 tion, needs to be reviewed.
 Please do continue to speak out on vital
 issues.  Your speaking out not only chal-
 lenges one to search out the truth or error
 of your premise, but also gives aid and com-
 fort to citizens who sometimes view Govern-
 ment actions with uneasiness of conscience
 and even alarm, but feel that they are un-
 able to truly justify their views in opposi-
 tion of the learned columnists and editorial
 writers.
 Yours truly.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  It is heartening to
 hear your voice raised against the policy of
 our Government in escalating the war in
 southeast  Asia.   The  increased  bombings
 were supposed to bring the hostilities to
 an end in perhaps less than 2 months.  In-
 stead, they are threatening to bring China
 and perhaps Russia into a war.     When can
 we learn that retaliation only brings on more
 countermeasures and solves nothing?
 Keep up your good work in protesting and
 publicizing our continued use of violence
 and threats.  Let us try to reach a civilized
 settlement before it is too late.
 Sincerely,
 Los ANGELES, CALIF.,

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:  We are appalled at
 the contradictions between your statements
 and your actions.  How can you say you are
 for independence and freedom in southeast
 Asia and yet deny the Vietnamese the right
 to determine their own affairs by free elec.
 tions,  under  international  supervision,  as
 promised in the Geneva Convention?
 How can you say you want peace, yet or-
 der the dropping of bombs on North Viet-
 nam?                                                                                                                        How can you offer "unconditional
 negotiations" to North Vietnam and Red
 China-knowing full well that by omitting
 mention of the ones who are actually wag-
 ing this war, the South Vietnamese NLF, you
 are thus creating not only a "condition" but
 an impossible obstacle.
 We agree with the 2,700 ministers, priests,
 and rabbis who, in a full page ad in the New
 York Times of April 4, pleaded with you to
 stop it in the name of God.  The longer
 your present policy of brutal military assault
 on the Asians continues, the more will you
 drive them into the arms of the Commu-
 nists-thus creating the very situation you so
 dread.  Your daily escalation of the war will
 win you the hatred not only of the Asians,
 but all the peoples of the world-including
 the Amelcan people, as our youth is slaugh-
 tered so needlessly.
 We urge you to stop doing the bidding of
 those war hawks who are advising you, or
 you and your family will wind up in an
 early grave, together with all the American
 people.  Listen, instead, to the counsel of
 Senators GRIIENING, MORSE, MCGOVERN, and.
 CIIVRcss.  Stop this murder before it is too

 DEAR SENATOR MoasE: Impressed with the
 growing gravity of the Vietnam situation,
 leaders in the National Council of Churches
 have taken two actions and we share them
 with you in view of your responsibilities
 along with the President for U.S., foreign
 policy.
 Among our constituency across the coun-
 try, increasingly strong and insistent con-
 cern is being expressed about Vietnam de-
 velopments.   Many  questions  are  being
 pressed as to the direction and decisions o3
 our Government, and whether they mean a
 drift toward war,  Now, special importance
 and encouragement are being attached to
 the statement of President Johnson on March
 25,  emphasizing   again  the principle  of
 restraint and the willingness for honorable
 negotiajion, and indicating the possibility
 of a peace offensive in terms of new initia-
 tive for economic, political, and social devel-
 opment which can help to make viable,
 Stable, independent nations in that whole
 area.  We hope that such initiatives will
 find a real response. among peoples in Other
 parts of the world and among all in our own
 Nation having responsibilities in developing
 and carrying through such an imaginative
 program for peace and human betterment.
 The  deep  concern  of  our constituents
 across the Nation is clear. On the basis of the
 meaning of religious faith and ethics for
 events in Vietnam, Insofar as facts, could
 be known to us, our president, Bishop Reu-
 ben H. Mueller, telegraphed President John-
 son, February 15 copy enclosed.  This was
 also sent to the UN.. Secretary General and
 the Secretary of State.  Further concern was
 expressed by church leaders gathering from
 all parts of the country and meeting of the
 west coast in our policymaking body, the
 general  board.   After - deliberation,  they
 adopted the February 26, resolution, enclosed.
 For your information reviews aoout Viet-

 the world are enclosed: the World Council of
 Churches' statement from its commission of

 others around the world.

 The PRESIDENT,

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: In pursuit of policies
 long advocated by the National Council of
 Churches, we welcome your repeated state-
 ments that the purpose of the U.S. Gov-
 ernment in actions in Vietnam is not to
 escalate war but to open the way for negotia-
 tions and peaceful settlement.
 We realize something of the tremendous
 complexity and the awesome significance of
 the situation.  We are concerned that con-
 tinuing efforts be made to create conditions
 for honorable and effective negotiations,  We
 feel it is Imperative that all parties involved
 live up to international agreements already
 entered into conducive to peace with justice,
 and that they exercise the utmost restraint
 by ceasing infiltrations and subversion and
 deeds which threaten to escalate the military
 action Into a wider war which would benefit
 none and do vast harm to all.
 We would urge, too, that all nations seek
 peaceful means for settlement of conflict and
 the development of that area, as in the Me-
 kong River project, making use of the United
 Nations and other channels as will be most
 effective, for the sake of the people of Viet-
 nam, the best national interests of all, and
 the peace of the world-hopes which we, as
 Christians, share with people of other faiths
 and men of good will everywhere.
 Be assured of our appreciation for your
 seeking to exercise restraint and your earn-
 est efforts to find peaceful ways to deal with
 this extremely complex and critical set of
 issues.  You and other leaders in our land
 and in other countries involved are in our
 prayers that you and they may be enabled to
 lead us all into the paths of peace with jus-
 tice and freedom.

 SOUTH VIETNAM
 (A statement on certain lines of action by
 the chairman and director of the Com-
 mission of the Churches on International
 Affairs, Sir Kenneth Grubb and O. Fred-
 erick Nolde)
 In the complex and explosive situation of
 Vietnam today, where precise information
 Is not at hand, caution must characterize
 both appraisal and public utterance.  As
 officers of the CCIA, we have been in touch
 with a number of our regional and national
 commissions of the churches on internation-
 al affairs, particularly those of the East Asian
 Christian Conference and of the National
 Council of Churches of Christ in the United
 States, and thereafter have issued an in-
 terim report on South Vietnam.  In speaking
 now more specifically, we do not seek to
 pronounce judgment but rather to voice the
 deep concern of millions of Christians in the
 World Council of Churches; to identify our-
 selves with the tragic lot of the people of
 Vietnam;  and to suggest certain lines of
 action which we believe merit consideration.
 The effort to solve the problem of South
 Vietnam by military measures to offset acts
 of calculated Infiltration or subversion is
 bound to prove futile.  While conceivably
 results of a temporizing nature may thus be
 achieved and the stage set for negotiations,
 the risk of escalation is an ever-present dan-
 ger, and critical world public opinion espec-
 cially among the peoples of Asia will inevi-
 tably increase in depth and volume.
 Our commission has over the years held
 that justice will be more fully served and
 world order under law better advanced by
 processes of peaceful change and peaceful
 settlement.  We believe we reflect a widely
 held conviction In calling upon all parties
 foreign to South Vietnam to exercise the ut-
 most restraint by ceasing on the one hand
 acts of infiltration and subversion and on
 the  other  consequent  military  measures
 which may result in enlarged conflict. This
 is a first requirement, and if it is not met
 negotiation for a solution will become in-
 creasingly difficult if not impossible.
 The United Nations Secretary-General has
 said that means must be found urgently,
 within or outside the United Nations, of
 shifting the quest for a solution away from
 the field of battle to the conference table.
 We are convinced that this can be done and
 that it can be done honorably, but only if
 false pride in facesaving is abandoned and
 there appears a readiness to take necessary
 risks without guarantees of success in ad-
 vance.  The shift from the battlefield to the
 conference table will not be facilitated if
 the United States awaits a clear signal from
 North Vietnam, or if North Vietnam awaits
 the withdrawal of. U.S. forces from active
 participation.  A new attitude of cautious
 venturesomeness is needed if catastrophe is
 to be averted.
 Various suggestions have been made as to
 how the parties concerned could be brought
 to the conference table and all should be
 looked  into  carefully.  They  include  re-
 course to the United Nations, recognizing the
 disadvantage that the Peoples Republic of
 China has not been seated; response to initi-
 atives of the United Nations Secretary Gen-

 there set up has proved ineffective; the use
 of ad hoc representation by great powers-
 notably the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom,
 and France-in whom the interested powers
 may `have sufficient confidence.    We see in
 addition to these yet another 'possibility
 which should be adequately explored. While
 the whole world is concerned with the prob-

 area who are not involved in the conflict are
 nevertheless most immediately and vitally
 involved in the total situation.  Their good
 offices might serve to bring into negotiation
 the parties in conflict or responsible for the
 conflict.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:                                     You are no doubt
 in my mind the greatest Senator in our
 times.  From your brave stand in the early
 1950's opposing Senator McCarthy (and you
 almost stood alone then and as now) to the
 present stand in Vietnam you deserve my
 heartfelt thanks.
 The cry over the entire country must be
 "We should not have gotten in, we should
 not have stayed, we should get out."
 of  South  Vietnam  are permitted  to seek
 what seem to them to be the best solution
 for their problem, and one which satisfies
 the demands of peace and security in south-
 east Asia.                 The expressed will of the people
 of South Vietnam or the decision of a gov-
 ernment freely chosen by them-taking into
 due account the common concern of all peo-
 ples-is the essential justification for the
 presence of foreign forces on their territory.
 We know how difficult it will be to insure
 that all foreign intervention based on force
 or the threat of force shall be removed and
 that the people begievn an opportunity to
 express their desires.  It may be that here
 again governments in the area who have
 much at stake could provide the manpower
 for observation and direction on the scene
 whereas , other   governments   proceeding
 through Impartial channels could contribute
 to the financial costs.
 We cannot overlook two factors of long-
 standing concern which play adversely into
 the present -situation in Vietnam.  In the
 first place the inability of the United Nations
 to deal with the problem as it should is in no
 small measure attributable to the absence of
 the Peoples Republic of China from its de-
 liberations  and  decisions.  The  continued
 artificial isolation of some 700 million people
 is a dangerous situation and may well aggra-
 vate the intransigence of the government in
 effective power-an intransigence which has
 thus far made peaceful solutions in the area
 difficult or impossible.  In the second place,
 peace will be endangered or only precariously
 maintained so long as one side supports wars
 of liberation and the other side provides
 military support for the defense of freedom.
 A frontal approach to these two problems
 may  well  at  this  time  result  in  failure.
 However, ingenuity motivated by good will
 should be able to create a situation in which
 there emerges a coincidence of interests and
 it becomes possible to override hostile atti-
 tudes and conflicting ideologies.
 In this troubled world, Christians as well
 as all men of good will can find their obliga-
 tion and opportunity, in the struggle to con-
 vert_,evil into good and to make what is
 potentially destructive redound to the bene-
 fit of mankind.  We pray Almighty God who
 rules and overrules our tangled history that
 such may be the course of events in South
 Vietnam.
 DEAF SmR: Am writing you in regard to
 the disgraceful way we are bombing in Viet-
 nam.  I guess the United Nations don't
 apply to us, it makes one ashamed to be

 Where we bomb women and kids and
 schools, maybe someday we will get it back,
 then what?
 Are we always going to bully the rest of
 the world to our way of thinking?  Which
 I don't think is so hot.  We are taxed to

 Los ANGELES,
 April 15, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I enclose a Drum-
 mond column from the Los Angeles Times of
 the 13th and a Chamberlain column from the
 Herald-Examiner of the 12th, aimed at you
 particularly-a nasty slur or two.
 Have answered sharply both gentlemen-
 and they will not be happy with my letter.
 When even Senator JAVrrs says his mail is
 running 50 to 1 against our role in Vietnam
 am afraid its the columnists who are misled
 as to popular feeling. Regarding the Cham-
 berlain statement on the use of private letters
 in the CONGREssIONAL RECORn, I assured him
 I am certain most writers would be happy to
 have their Vietnam views publicized par-
 ticularly because the press  has  failed to
 carry the bulk of the criticism but is con-
 ducting a virtual campaign to escalate  a
 real war.
 The  "polls"  are  very  unreliable as we
 know-especially since they are not truly
 representative and they are belied by the
 evidence on every hand-I have yet to talk to
 anyone who approves Vietnam-not all write
 letters.
 ERMA DUTTON.
 actions which Mr. Johnson has taken in the
 last 2 months to show Hanoi that aggression
 will not pay.
 There is no weakness, no vacillation any-
 where in the address In which he expounded
 those actions.
 His message is clear.  To our beleaguered
 ally, South Vietnam, to our adversaries in
 Hanoi  and  elsewhere  in  the  Communist
 world to the American people who bear much
 of the pain and cost, he made this total
 commitment: "We will not be defeated.  We
 will not grow tired.  We will not withdraw"-
 until the aggression ceases.
 I believe that the Nation will be over-
 whelmingly relieved that he said It.
 But the President made it equally clear
 that the United  States does not put one
 single condition, one single barrier, not even
 one diplomatic  breath in the way of our
 willingness to discuss an end to the war.
 In his Johns Hopkins speech he told every-
 body that the United States stands uncon-
 ditionally ready to begin "unconditional dis-
 cussions."  To the 17 neutral nations he said,
 in effect: Yes, we will talk; see if Hanoi will,
 too.
 This is a crucial clarification of Johnson
 policy.
 The President is saying that we will talk
 with the aggressor even while the aggression.
 persists, that we will talk with Hanoi even
 if the infiltration of men and arms from,
 North Vietnam continues, that we will nego-
 tiate and defend--simultaneously.
 Does this mean that the United States is
 going to negotiate away the independence
 of South Vietnam?  Does willingness to un-
 dertake  "unconditional  discussions"  mean
 that there would be no conditions on the re-
 sults of such discussions?
 I can say with knowledge that it means
 no such thing.  It means that nothing will
 keep the United States from the confer-
 ence table except the absence of Hanoi. It
 also means that we will have only one ob-
 jective to take to the conference table: the
 Independence of South Vietnam and its free-
 dom from future attack.
 Mr. Johnson makes this vital point: If
 Hanoi wants to talk and continue the ag-
 gression, we will talk and continue the pres-
 sure until the aggression is ended either by
 negotiation or by any other means.
 He assures Hanoi-and the world-that we
 seek no overthrow of the North Vietnamese
 regime, no military base in South Vietnam,
 and that we stand ready to give enlarged
 assistance to any cooperative effort in which
 the nations of southeast Asia would collec-
 tively join.
 The  President  is  saying that defending
 South Vietnam successfully is not a road to
 war; it is the road to peace.

 No  FURTHER    DOUBTS  ON  VIETNAM

 President Johnson's strong and lucid re-
 port on Vietnam to the Nation-wand to- the
 world-leaves nothing 1p doubt.
 Three consequences flow from it:
 It will, I am certain, decisively unite the
 American people behind what Is being done
 and whatever still must be done to success-

 It  puts  the  onus  totally  on Hanoi for
 refusing to seek a peaceful settlement by
 opening talks with the United States.
 It will enlist for the United States mount-
 ing support from world opinion-particularly
 the 17 unalined nations which have appealed
 for negotiation.   It will do so because the
 President says that he will talk with the ag-
 gressors or other nations any time under
 any circumstances without any conditions.
 I am convinced that only weakness and
 vacillation on the part of the President in his
 commitment to defend South Vietnam could
 divide the Nation.

 which their words have been put,  (He as-
 sumes too much.)
 The Russian reporter who has used the let-
 'ters to Senator MORSE is S. Vishnevsky, That
 Mr. Vishnevsky is a partisan distorter of the
 worst order is proved by the use he has made,
 in the same Pravda Issue of April 2, of a
 column written by my colleague, William S.
 White,
 In the particular column in question Mr.
 White poured scorn on the handful of pro-
 fessionally  anti-American  Americans  who
 continually run down their country, calling
 it "ugly America," "guilty America," and so
 on. But Mr. Vishnevsky, ignoring the whole
 thrust and meaning of the White column,
 quoted selected bits from it to prove that
 America is indeed a guilty nation.
 True enough, Senator MORSE did not hand
 the correspondence directly to the Russian
 -reporter. 'The letters may be found in the
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
 It is one thing to carry on a campaign
 against White House policy as part of a great
 debate over the issue of American interest in
 southeast Asia, but isn't it something else
 again to  make presumably private letters
 available for use by anybody?

 Would have been caused back in 1940 to
 patriotic members of the America First Com-
 hlittee if their letters to Congressmen had
 found their first news exploitation in Dr.
 Goebbels' press in Berlin?
 We  may be sure  that Senator  MORSE
 wanted his mail to make an impression on
 the White House, but S. Vishnevsky stresses
 the point that none of these letters have
 be= published in local papers.
 I am sure that many Americans, including
 Oregonians who voted for him, are ashamed
 of Senator MORSE'S naivete In permitting
 Itussins to be misled about popular feeling

 DEAR  SENATOR:  By passing the Vietnam

 responsibilities, and gave President Johnson
 power greater than De Gaulle's or Khru-

 When people protest Johnson's war, Con-

 the ..situation and Washes its hands of it.

 FEMININE TOUCH
 Editor, The Hackensack (N.J.) Record:
 To all American women  under 40  and
 over, married  or single,  with children or
 without, housewives, or jobholders, organized
 or  unorganized, churched  or unchurched,
 plain or fancy: we have something valuable.
 Social scientists are saying that we have
 qualities superior to the male's-intuition,
 adaptability, resourcefulness,   ingenuity,
 peacekeeping  and negotiating  ability, pa-
 tience, tact, understanding, and compassion.
 They are even saying that women should be
 represented in the councils of decisionmak-
 ing, since men have brought the solution
 of conflict by war to Its limits.
 If  President  Johnson  happened  to  be
 Madam President, his intuition (defined by
 H. L. Mencken as a sharp and accurate per-
 ception of reality) would have told him that
 chemicals are being used to gas innocent
 villagers in Vietnam. It is quite clear that
 the President needs an overwhelming dose
 of feminine persuasion to counteract the
 effect the warhawks have had on him.  He
 finally  identified himself  with  those try-
 ing to put Negroes on a par with whites;
 he could finally identify himself with the
 majority  of  Americans  who  are appalled
 at   our  militant   action    in Vietnam.
 United States officials even admit that most
 Vietnamese people don't want us in their
 country.  We certainly aren't making the
 world a better place for them.  And we are
 defying the United Nations, our own re-
 peated verbalizations  that  the. best hope
 for peace lies in the United "Nations, and
 the urgent pleas to negotiate coming from
 Secretary-General  U. Thant and  countless
 other statesmen and leaders.
 President Johnson will listen if hundreds
 of women will take the time to write a short
 but urgent note expressing their concern.
 When casualty lists start coming in together
 with other evidence that we are involved in
 a brutal war-worse than the suffering going
 on down South-damage will be great.  For
 years  we  shall  have  to  compensate for
 our foolish and harmful ways.

 It on to Mr. McNamara or Dean Rusk to

 My letter to you is to thank you for your
 clear stand on Vietnam and to let you know
 that I. am a solid supporter of yours here

 you, to .continue your very line work in the

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  The world already
 knows our military strength.  Now let us
 show our moral strength by (1) immediate
 cease-fire in Vietnam; (2) immediate use of
 U Thant formula for negotiations.
 HOn. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 MY DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I recently came
 across some historical material about the ori-
 gins of World War II which I think are ex-
 tremely topical in our own times.  The en-
 closed article, -which appeared In the Port
 Clinton, Ohio, Daily News,, resulted from this.
 I should point out that I was one of those
 who' thought that Sir Robert Vansittart was
 right,  that  the  free  world  should  rearm
 against nazism.    But until now -I had no idea
 that Sir Robert's thinking was so far off base,
 so impractical, so useless.  In our own era,
 Sir Robert would be a "hawk."
 But, I think, a "hawk" should do more
 than to lead his people to war-he should
 weigh the consequences of his advocacy.  Sir
 Robert, obviously, did not.
 As to the sorry role played by Ian Colvin,
 "the man who started the war," one cannot
 help but wonder if we don't have his likes
 whispering into the ears of our "hawks" to-
 day.                                                                    If the quality of the information he
 gave in 1939 had not been so completely
 wrong, the mutual defense pact with Poland
 might not have been concluded.  Yet, I ask
 myself, was this bad?  It was, after all, the
 only  morally  correct step taken by the

 STEVE LOOKS AT THE NEWS
 (By Steve Eerati)
 What might be called "The Secret History
 of the Origins of World War II" is still being
 written.
 With each publidation of memoirs, each
 new snippet of previously unknown infor-
 mation, the jigsaw puzzle slowly falls into
 a discernible whole.
 But the entire story remains to be told as
 the governments release their official papers
 in drips and drabs.
 One man who played a large role in at-
 tempting to rearm Britain throughout the
 period of Hitler's ascendancy was Sir Robert
 Vansittart, a man who performed as a 20th
 century counterpart of Rome's Cato (who re-
 peatedly told the Roman Senate, , Delenda
 est Corthago," or "Carthage must be de-
 stroyed").
 Vansittart was permanent undersecretary
 of the Foreign Office from 1930 to 1937.  He
 clearly saw the threat of German rearma-
 ment and, as captured German records now
 show, repeatedly exaggerated the actual Ger-
 man state of preparedness.
 tarized zone in Germany's favor.  And I
 would restore her colonies to Germany.  In
 return  for  these  offers we should extract
 from Germany a return to Geneva disarma-
 ment and a formal renunciation of any ter-
 ritorial designs in Europe, including aims of
 at  absorptions  of  Austria  and Czechoslo-
 vakia."
 Commented the British historian A. J. P.
 Taylor:   "This was  curious  advice. _ Great
 Britain and presumably France were to give
 way to Germany over the colonies, where they
 were comparatively strong, and were to re-
 sist                                                                                                                           her        over Austria and   Czechoslovakia,
 which they had no means of doing."
 And  so  the  Germans  remilitarized  the
 Rhineland without objection from the British
 or French. Next, they forced the unification
 of Austria with Germany.      You know the
 And so Britain ended up fighting alone.
 Playing a peculiar part in all this was a
 British  newsman stationed in Berlin, Ian
 Colvin.  Sir Winston Churchill pinned ever-
 lasting fame on Colvin by calling him "The
 man who started the war."
 The time was 1939.  British ministers con-
 sulted Colvin before the conclusion of the
 British guarantee to defend the borders of
 Poland against German aggression (a moral
 guarantee that could not be exercised though
 the Rhineland could have been defended.)
 The Polish Pact was made known March
 31,  1939.   The invasion  of  Poland began
 Sept. 1, 1939.
 Here is what Colvin told the British minis-
 ters in March:
 "'rhe Germans may attack the Poles to-
 morrow, the next day, the day after, in a
 week."  (He gave March 28 as the most likely
 date.)
 Colvin is said, by Taylor, to have told the
 ministers that Hitler was unpopular in Ger-
 many because of his persecution of the Jews
 in the synagogue attacks of Nov. 9, 1938.
 Many German officers were. said to have been
 eager to overthrow Hitler.

 A. STATEMENT BY THE IOWA YEARLY MEETING
 OF FRIENDS  (CONSERVATIVE)
 We are deeply concerned by the develop-
 ments in South Vietnam.  The increasing
 casualties of Vietnamese on both sides and
 of Americans fill our hearts with sorrow.
 The cruelty of using incendiary bombs in-
 discriminately over a whole region causes
 anguish, horror, and shame.
 These methods of warfare, the enlarge-
 ment of United States combatant forces, and
 bombing of North Vietnam seem to us
 breaches of international law, the United
 Nations Charter, and especially of the Ge-
 neva accordgf 1954 which the United States
 promised to respect.
 'We urge our Government and our coun-
 trymen to reconsider their present attitudes,
 to ask for an immediate ceasefire, and to
 start negotiations toward a coalition gov-
 ernment on a broad popular basis with mu-
 tual guaranty of amnesty to members of the
 previously warring factions.    We hope for
 neutralization  of  the  whole  area  of  the
 former French Indo-Chinese Federation un-
 der the guaranty of all the states which
 signed the Geneva accord of 1954, the United
 States and the United Nations.  We also urge
 generous support of far reaching regional
 development plans by all the powers, dip-
 lomatic recognition of North Vietnam, and
 close  economic association  between North
 Vietnam and a South Vietnamese state, in-
 dependent from, but friendly to her neigh-
 bor to the north.
 If peace is our goal we have to realize
 that true peace can never be reached by vio-
 lence.
 Even an almost impossible victory in the
 civil war by our present and extended bomb-
 ings of North Vietnam, and the employment
 of large American. land forces could only
 bring about an. insecure. absence of open
 hostilities,  Also there is the threat of al-
 most certain intervention of North Viet-
 namese and Chinese armies if we extend the
 war too far.
 True peace can only be achieved through
 understanding and cooperation toward goals
 which. further the interests common to all
 concerned.  The United Nations'  secretary
 general's proposal for a Vietnamese peace
 conference included plans for utilizing the
 United Nations' Special Fund project for the
 Lower Mekong River Basin as one of the
 bases for opening negotiations.  It is not too
 late yet to accept this suggestion, and to use
 our money, influence and technical skill Lot
 the benefit of the whole Indo Chinese re-
 gion and Thailand, instead of squandering
 them in a lost civil war.

 DEAR Sm: I have followed with consider-
 able interest in your pronouncements on the
 situation in southeast Asia.  I agree with
 your sentiments In many instances and offer
 my support for you.   Certainly something
 must be done at the earliest moment.
 I am wondering if you maintain a mailing
 list for newsletters to your constituents.  If
 so, I would greatly appreciate having my
 name placed on such a list so that I may fol-
 low your views on Vietnam and other issues
 more closely.
 My sincerest best wishes for continued suc-
 cess in representing your State and the Na-
 tiop.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: As a concerned Amer-
 ican citizen, I would like to express my sup-
 port for your courageous and perceptive op-
 position to the present policy in Vietnam.
 Your presence in the Senate is a heartening
 comfort to those who feel the present mili-
 tary involvement both unjust and inhumane.
 With sincerest respect,
 COURADE JAFFE,
 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,

 DEAR MR. MORSE: Just a word of encourage-
 ment to let you know that I am in complete
 agreement with your views on the Vietnam
 struggle.
 I believe that the vast majority of our
 people, though inarticulate, share these views.
 May we soon see an end to this murderous
 business Which has brought  unspeakable
 havoc to a long-tortured people and which,
 if unchecked, can involve all of us in ruin.
 Thank heavens, we have a few men in Con-
 gress who, like you, are not afraid to take a
 stand.  I predict that as the chorus of oppo-
 sition to present policies swell  (and it Is
 swelling) you will find yourselves joined by
 some of the more timid who perhaps feel as
 you do but lack the courage to say so.
 Sincerely yours,

 MY DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Like a good many
 of my friends I find myself wondering if
 our behavior in Vietnam is really in the na-
 tional interest.  If the United States is in
 danger, is this place the most advantageous
 place to make a stand against our attackers?
 If, as some allege the troubles in Vietnam are
 7849
 in the nature of a civil war is it in our in-
 terest that we should be intervening on one
 side or the other of a civil war in a small
 country several thousand miles away?
 I am not in the least anxious for us to be
 in a war but if it is in the national interest
 to be in one should be not go through the
 formality suggested by our Constitution in
 regard to such matters; i.e., have Congress
 declare war?
 Much general discussion of the incredible
 news about what we are doing in Vietnam
 ends on a note of uncertainty because many
 of us feel uncertain about the accuracy and
 completeness of the news we are receiving.
 Should not Congress ask for more news and
 more complete news and share it with the
 public?

 Hon. R. VANCE HARTKE,

 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR HARTKE: Since receiving your
 letter and speech concerning Vietnam, I have
 been intending to write.  The news broad-
 c?sts about more than 20,000 students dem-
 onstrating in Washington against the Viet-
 namese war pushed me into expressing my
 agreement with their viewpoint.
 I hope that my beloved country will aban-
 don this cowardly policy of bombing Viet-
 namese.  Surely there can never be any
 worthwhile objective gained from such ac-
 tions.  Our children and grandchildren will
 have to reap the hate from this as surely
 as Americans today reap the hate sowed
 by slavery and serfdom in our own country.
 Furthermore, the military superiority that
 enables us to attack Asians with no fear of
 retaliation upon our homeland will not last
 forever.  Already the Chinese test nuclear
 weapons.
 I believe I speak for many who voted for
 you when I say that the various viewpoints
 Of Senators  MORSE,  GRUENING,  MCGOVERN,
 and FULBRIGHT (to a lesser degree), are more
 to our liking than those expressed on the
 Senate floor by yourself and Senator BAYH.
 In fact your position,  and that of the
 President, remind me of ex-Senators Jenner,
 Capehart,  Goldwater,  and  ex-Congressman
 Bruce.   I believe  that both  Indiana and
 the Nation have progressed to a point where
 we see the fallacy of negotiation with bombs
 and bullets.  May I take this opportunity
 to  compliment you on your     attempts to
 strengthen the voting rights bill.
 My  wife      agrees,  generally, with  my
 opinions.
 Sincerely,
 STEPHEN OLIKER.

 HOD. WAYNE MORSE:
 You are to be commended for opposing
 escalation  of war  in Vietnam.   Thinking
 Americans are dismayed.    We cannot under-
 stand that the President honestly believes
 he is doing right.
 I can imagine you are discouraged and
 think you stand alone, but remember God is
 always on the side of right and peace.
 Neither are you as alone as you may
 think.  The Korean war is still in our mem-
 ories.                    We were afraid of an atomic war
 then-we are afraid of one now.
 We have written to the President asking
 him to turn away from military advisers.
 Will you keep trying to show him your con-
 viction in this matter?            -

 MY DEAR MR. SENATOR:  I thank you sin-

 Senate and elsewhere about our indefensible
 policy in southeast Asia.
 Since there are so few voices to oppose
 that policy, we urge that you not become
 discouraged, but continue your active op-
 position to our strikes against nations with
 whom we are supposedly at peace.  We pray
 that you continue to hammer away on this
 every Week or every day.  Each time some
 few Americans may begin to think and to
 question.  This Is our only hope.
 With heartfelt gratitude, I am,

 INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS-SADNESS,
 ALARM, AND CHAGRIN
 Any conscionable person who meditates on
 current interpersonal relationships cannot
 but be sad-and alarmed.  And one who is
 familiar with the work of Alfred Korzybski
 and Sigmund Freud must also feel chagrin
 that much of so-called man's inhumanity to
 man therein might be due, in. large measure,
 to the ignoring of their concepts.
 Millions have known about Freud's basic
 contribution as to tricks played by the sub-
 conscious, although few are aware that in
 his "Civilization and Its Discontents," pub-
 lished  in  1930,  he  then  thought  man
 had discovered the means of destroying him-
 self "to the last man" and decision rested on
 "struggle between Eros and Death, between
 the instincts of life and the instincts of
 destruction."
 Probably fewer are acquainted with the
 -communication concepts of Count Korzybski.
 He came to this country prior to the Second
 World War, did work with patients at St.
 Elizabeths Hospital and wrote  extensively
 about  our  errors  in the  transmission of
 thought, including "Science and Sanity" of
 over 1,000 pages.
 As Freudian ideology furnishes guides to
 greater individual insight, such as in aware-
 ness of projection, identification, and trans-
 ference, new ideas on communication are
 made available by this Polish mathemati-
 cian aimed at avoiding statements which are
 not in accord with the facts of reality, which
 can cause illness, and which facilitate de-
 tection of such errors in others.  It was his
 opinion that If statesmen had understood
 the utterances of Hitler the carnage wrought
 by that sick person might have been avoided.
 It would be futile herein to attempt any
 summary of Korzybski's formulations.  Man
 does not readily change his heritage of val-
 ues and any attempt to explain his work
 meets withsome of the same errors in think-
 ing which he tried to eradicate.  But one
 of his most important contributions was his
 emphasis on unwitting piling of abstraction
 on abstraction until there is such polarity of
 words in communication that group conflict
 Is almost beyond man's ability to under-
 stand, let alone settle.  Such either/or ap-
 proach, whether it be in terms of liberal/con-
 servative, Negroes/whites, freedom/slavery,
 et al., harms the health of humanity and re-

 DEAR SENATOR JAVITS: Please add my name
 to those who concur In the appeal of the
 Clergymen's Emergency Committee for Viet-
 nam of the Fellowship of Reconciliation as
 published in the New York Times on April 4,
 1965.  I would change the address thereof
 to Mr. President: In the name of the people
 of the world, stop it.
 Months ago President Johnson said he did
 not want to get us into war with 600 million
 Chinese, but sometimes the right hand does
 not know what the left hand is doing.  As
 of this moment, Senators MORSE and McGov-
 ERN are the true statesmen of this Nation
 and in the pattern of the greatest world
 statesmen of my time-the late President
 Kennedy.
 Several years ago in a letter published in
 '' local newspaper; I could have been the first
 to speak of an accidental war, quoting from
 Dr. Freud's "Civiliation and Its Discontents,"
 published more than 30 years ago, in which
 he mentioned man's ability to wipe out the
 human race.  Now the theme is common-
 place.
 In the last analysis, the murder of inno??
 cent people, including Americans, in Vietnam
 is but a war of words-the battle of capital-
 ism versus communism.  This tragedy could
 be generated only by unconscious motivation
 (Freud) and high-level abstraction or un-
 tards the beneflctent evolution of culture.
 Notwithstanding the immensity of scien-
 tific achievement in other fields, there ap-
 pears to be, indeed, cause for sadness, alarm,
 and chagrin about man's relationships with
 his fellow man.  Unscientific communication
 could be the most important factor in a
 "struggle between Eros and Death"

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Having been a long-
 time admirer of your political actions and
 utterances, particularly an the Vietnam war,
 I felt constrained to write you and give you
 some of my Ideas on the problems perplexing
 our Nation and the world.  There is no doubt
 the world is going through one of those
 cataclysmic changes that have marked the
 history of mankind since the beginning of
 recorded  time.   Babylonia,  Persia,  Greece,
 Rome, Spain, Great Britain, and now the
 United States have and are still trying to
 rule  the  world.   Slavery,  from     absolute
 through serfdom and chattel to economic or
 wage, has been the lot of the workers through
 all history.  The right of the strong and
 cunning to exploit the weak and simple has
 always been part of the law and morality of
 all ruling nations and peoples.  We are now
 going through an era when the workers and

 little people of the, world are demanding a
 change.  They insist that their labor be ap-
 plied to the natural resources of the earth
 for the general welfare of all, instead for the
 private profit' of those who have in some
 manner taken possession of the wealth of
 the world.  I am enclosing herewith some
 verses that I believe tells the story; "The
 March of the Hungiy Men."
 In, view of your expressed views on the war
 in South Vietnam, I am also enclosing my
 observations on the speech made by Presi-
 dent  Johnson on  the  subject before  the
 Johns. Hopkins Hospital group.  I contend
 they are based on facts and the logical con-
 clusions arising from them.     It is appalling
 that more people do not see where we are
 heading and what is being done to us under
 the guise of seeking peace and freedom.  We
 are so brainwashed that most of us freeze
 into spells of fear and hatred at the men-
 tion of the word "communism."  It is thus
 our rulers keep us quiet while they borrow
 and tax us into insolvency, waste the money
 on unnecessary military splurges.  We are
 told we now' have enough atomic weapons
 to kill every person on earth 25 times, but
 we are spending` $56 billion this year for
 more military might.  Perhaps that is why
 we are spending more billions on space ex-
 ploration; we must find some other people to
 kill in order to keep our military production
 going.
 Doesn't the  present  military,  economic,
 and political program of our rulers give one
 the Impression we are a nation of fools gov-
 erned by a bunch of imbeciles?                            How else
 car we account for the low standards and
 ethics of our principles? The motivation of
 economic and political activities is competi-
 tion.  This is the law of the jungle.                     Only
 the strongest and most cunning can succeed.
 All of our businesses and professions are oper-
 ated on that basis.  "Caveat emptor," let the
 buyer beware is the rule.  The Federal Gov-
 ernment, every State, county, city, borough,
 or other municipal unit has inspectors, in-
 vestigators, and examiners employed to keep
 the operations of free enterprise merely legal.
 There is no attempt to keep them moral or
 ethical.  This causes operation by the rule
 of the four B's: bull, bluff, bribery, and bru-
 tality.                              Think it over;  isn't this the way
 things are generally done under our system?
 I am also enclosing some verses on the
 kind of political campaign we are inflicted
 with these days.  Each side tries to outdo
 the other in its denunciation of communism;
 or tries to convict the opponent of friend-
 ship or softness toward Communists.  In the
 present mental and emotional condition of
 our people that is usually sufficient.  But
 the fact that you and some other Members
 of the Senate and Congress are telling the
 truth gives us hope that sense and reason
 may be restored to our people.  Then we can
 have a Government ruled by truth and jus-
 tice unclouded by a fog of fear and hatred.
 But I am afraid as long as we are trying to
 mix economic royalty with political democ-
 racy, the ferment caused, as in all ferments,
 will bring a scum to the top, with notable
 exceptions, of course.  Thank you for letting
 me bother you.  With all good wishes, I am,
 Respectfully yours,
 Cvaus A. DAVIS.
 COMMENTS   ASQUT        PRESIDENT   JOHNSON'S
 SPEECH By Cysus A. DAVIS, ALHAMBRA, CALIF.
 Whoever wrote the President's speech on
 the var in ~lietnamfollowed.closely the pre-
 cepts of MachiaveYi's political doctrines and
 Hitler's, big' lie. it was a magnificent exhi-
 bition of concealing intentions with words.
 First; North-Vietnam, which is not attacir-
 ing the United States, but being bombed by
 U.S. planes, can have peace any time it ac-
 cepts the U.S. terms.  These are uncondi-
 tional surrender of the right to give or allow
 the transportation of any and all assistance
 to the people of South Vietnam, who are
 rebelling against the puppet government we
 imposed on them, in violation of the Geneva
 Conference agreement.  He made it clear and
 emphatic that we are going to maintain our
 fight to impose a government favorable to us
 on the nations of southeast Asia if we have
 to fight an atomic war to do so.  The rest
 of the speech was an offer of bribes to those
 who will accept that kind of government.
 This is an example of imperialist tactics
 since the beginning of history.  As long as
 the weak accept the domination of the strong
 on the strong's terms, they. can have peace.
 This is known as Roman peace as it was first
 named during the reign of that rapacious
 empire.  It is the k+d of peace experienced
 by a man who is prostrate, with a robber
 sitting astride his body ransacking his pock-
 eta.                                                                            As long as he submits peacefully he
 will not be injured.  In fact, he may have
 some of his possessions returned to him as
 charity.  Charity is a salve concocted to ease
 the conscience of those inflicting and the
 pangs of those suffering injustice.
 When      Vietnam  was divided into north
 and south nations, by the Geneva Confer-
 ence, it was agreed that no foreign govern-
 ment should                                                                                  interfere with  them.   They
 were to form their own governments and in
 1956 held a plebiscite election to decide if
 they desired to unite.   Foster Dulles, the
 U.S. delegate at the Conference, refused to
 sign the agreement and immediately, with
 the  assistance  of  the CIA,  of which  his
 brother Allen was the head, installed a pup-
 pet dictator as the head of South Vietnam
 and moved    in our financial  and military
 power to support him.    This is the modern
 form of imperialism.     Hitler used it in his
 attempt to conquer the world.  In fact, the
 name of his Norway puppet, Quisling, is the
 contemptuous title applied to such charac-
 ters.  The people of South Vietnam rebelled
 against the dictator and the war started to
 dislodge him is still going on. The original
 dictator was ousted and murdered by a pal-
 ace revolution and military junta installed,
 which we immediately recognized.  This in
 turn  has  been followed  by  several  other
 palace revolutions installing other dictators
 and military juntas, all of which we rec-
 ognized and accepted, despite the demand
 of the people to elect their own ruler. These
 dictators and military juntas are the peoples
 governments the President said the Com-
 munists were trying to overthrow and we are
 going to maintain if it starts an atomic war.
 It has already cost us billions of dollars and
 hundreds of American lives with no observa-
 ble benefit, but the President says that un-
 less the people of Asia, and the world, agree
 to accept and endure this kind of imperial-
 ism, we will force it on them or destroy the
 world in atomic horror.  In other words, we
 intend to rule or ruin the world.  It is our
 way or none at all.
 The President stated all he wanted was to
 establish peace and freedom in the world.
 We have already described the kind of peace
 he wants to impose on the weaker nations.
 Let us examine the kind of freedom the
 United States is supporting all over the world.
 Every dictator in the world, upholding capi-
 talistic economy, is on our payroll.  Most of
 them were installed by overthrowing a people
 elected government with a U.S. organized and
 financed revolution.   Guatemala, Panama,
 Venezuela, and lately Brazil.  All these coun-
 tries are recognized and supported by us.
 Chiang Kai-shek helped take over Formosa,
 where he slaughtered 65,000 of the. leading
 citizens in so doing.  The people of Formosa
 had no opportunity to accept or refuse him.
 They have never had a chance to vote in a
 free and fair election ,whether they want to
 live under Chiang or join the Communist
 mainland.  Yet under_.the pretense of pro
 tecj!ing their freedom, we are supporting their
 dictator financially, and keeping the 7th Fleet
 of the U.S. Navy between Formosa and the
 7851
 mainland to keep the Communists from re-
 moving him.   We have  even coerced the
 United Nations to seat him as the real China,
 while inducing it to refuse to admit the real
 China.  The President's freedom is on a par
 with Roman peace.  More submissiveness for
 the victim and more freedom for the robber.
 Suppose the Bay of Pigs invasion had been
 successful and the so-called freedom fighters
 had one-half of the island in their, possession.
 Suppose the Russians were helping Castro
 with air support, including the use of na-
 palm bombs, gas and corrosive acid to de-
 stroy villages, farms and vegetation held by
 the invaders; that the Russian navy captured
 or destroyed all the ships supplying the in-
 vaders with arms and supplies and finally
 started to bomb bases in Guatemala and Ni-
 caragua, would we accept their claim that
 they were doing so to bring peace and free-
 dom to Cuba?  Our blockade of Cuba and the
 threat of atomic war on the importation of
 guided missiles into Cuba is the answer.  How
 hypocritical can we get?
 In surveying conditions  in our country
 and the attitude of the President, one is in-
 clined to wonder if we aren't in a throw-
 back to ancient times, and using the meth-
 ods of these days to solve our difficulties.
 Bread and circuses of the Roman empire
 are copied by welfare and pageants; queens
 are crowned for all kinds of public spec-
 tacles;  games and parades, radio and TV
 programs keep them entertained and amused.
 Doles maintain our unemployed and subsidies
 our industries.  Lately automation has taken
 the place of millions of workers, both skilled
 and unskilled,   It is estimated that 40,000
 workers are replaced weekly by automation.
 Big  corporation  profits  increase  as  their
 labor cost decreases.  The result is we have
 a rapidly increasing army of unemployed.
 They must be taken care of someway.
 In olden days when rulers were affected
 by such problems they declared war on each
 other and had the surplus populations killed
 off.  That was easy for old absolute rulers.
 But in modern times different tactics must
 be  employed,  so  the  people  affected  will
 think the war is for some high and noble
 purpose,  or to  defend  against   aggression.
 Thus we are steeped in false and hypocritical
 propaganda about peace and freedom and
 resistance to aggression in order to brain-
 wash us into approving and supporting the
 war.  The President's speech was a fine ex-
 hibition of that system in action.
 First, he butters up the people generally
 by announcing a program of welfare cov-
 ering social security, medicare and educa-
 tion.                                                                                                                                          He will probably get it through the
 Congress and Senate, by assuring the spon-
 sors of the Members, that it will not be in
 effect long, if at all, by telling them of his
 plan to start an atomic war, which will re-
 duce the population to manageable propor-
 tions.  This is like giving a condemned man
 a wonderful meal before his execution.  So
 eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow you
 may die.
 Then he has secret meetings with those
 members, who are in on the deal, and dis-
 tributes brochures to them showing how the
 contemplated war will work.  It will dimin-
 ish the population of both Russia and the
 United States by from 100 to 150 million each.
 The extermination will be greatest in the
 large cities and urban areas where most of
 the  indigent  and   unemployed  live.   (See
 Pearson's column in the Los Angeles Times,
 Apr. 9, 1965).  The President and those in
 the know will  hide  in  specially prepared
 bombproof  shelters  in  the  mountains    in
 Maryland until the holocaust is over.    (See
 Pearson's column at the time war threatened
 over Russian missiles in Cuba).    Then the
 President and his cortege will emerge and
 compel the survivors to clean up and re-
 build the shattered cities for the privilege
 of living.  This is the Fascist dream,

 All this could be averted by allowing the
 people of each country to have a free and
 fair election in which they could choose their
 own rulers.  If they wish to go Communist,
 it should betheir privilege.  If they do not
 wish to remain Communist, they can revolt
 against  that  regime  as well as  they can
 against puppet dictators.   Then we can help
 the people instead of the puppets.   It is
 as simple as that. No rigged or ex parte elec-
 tions will do.  They should be conducted by
 the league of nations through a committee
 composed of members of every economic and
 political belief. No election under the super-
 vision of the army of a supposed neutral
 nation will do. The election in Greece under
 the British Army supervision was rigged to
 return  70 percent for the royalty ticket,
 according to the officer in charge as related
 in Reynolds News.  Then after a free and
 fair election, the chosen leader should be
 protected against any machinations to start
 a revolt against him, no matter what ideo-
 logical group seeks to remove him. It should
 be lawful to remove him by a vote of the
 people or the organization authorized to do
 so; like the vote of no confidence in England,
 or the vote of the politburo in Russia.  The
 people of every nation should be allowed and
 protected in advocating and voting for any
 political or economical party or program
 they desire.  And each party should be given
 equal and protected time to expound the
 tenets of their doctrines. That is real democ-
 racy.
 Two world wars in which hundreds of
 millions were slaughtered and trillions of
 property destroyed hasn't taught us any-
 thing.  Three-fourths of the world's popu-
 lation live in poverty, including one-third
 of our own.  Our Nation and all of its mu-
 nicipal parts are in debt up to their ears
 and going deeper.  Crime and unemploy-
 ment are Increasing daily.  Most of our agri-
 culture and industries are maintained by
 subsidies.  The only remedies we are offered
 is more borrowing and spending and war on
 cominuntsm, which wants only to take and
 use the natural resources and industries of
 the world and operate- them, not for the ac-
 cumulation of individual wealth but for the
 general welfare.   They want to substitute
 cooperation for competition in the economic
 affairs of the world.  We are taught that
 makes them our enemies, even of our religion.
 I wonder if those who recite the Lord's
 Prayer "Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be
 done on Earth as it is in I-leaven" do hon-
 estly believe that God concessions out the
 properties and services necessary to the oper-
 ation of Heaven to His favorites to exploit
 the population generally; or do they think
 He throws such concessions up for grabs so
 the strong and cunning can get control of
 them and use them to get wealthy at the
 expense  of  others.   Don't  you  think  we
 should reexamine our political and economic
 programs?

 POLITICAL SESAME: A LA NIXON
 (By Cyrus A. Davis)
 It used  to be a problem in this  great
 Democracy,     -                  -
 To acquire success in politics or fame of a
 degree,
 As a radio purveyor of scandal, news and
 such,
 For as columnist or writer it required a cer-
 tain touch.
 There was need of education and an under-
 standing mind,
 With a wide vocabulary of a strong convinc-
 ingkind.                   -
 There Were many weighty issues; many ques-
 tions were involved,
 And political aspirants were assessed on how
 they solved
 These ever pressing problems in the political
 lists,
 But all they need today is curses for the
 Communists.             -
 The old time politicias who made the welkin
 ring,
 With their mighty perorations of the good
 their rule would bring,
 Now are stilled; for none will listen to the
 issues of the day,            -
 Though the Elephant may trumpet and the
 Donkey loudly bray,
 From the sun of California to the rock bound
 coast of Maine;
 Prom the mountains to the oceans; from the
 city to the plain,
 Every platform, stage and pulpit, business,
 labor, racket, farm,
 Sounds and echoes to the clamor of the un-
 ending alarm,
 Of our self appointed Saviors grinding propo-
 ganda grist,
 Like a broken record playing, Communist,
 Communist.
 Wesometimes miss the glamor ofthe old red
 light parade,
 And the old spell binding speakers who their
 eloquence displayed.
 As they extolled their virtues and denounced
 opponents claims;
 Pointed to their deeds and honors and ex-
 posed their rivals shames.
 But today the politicians are more sinister
 and sly,
 And              conceal  their  real  Intentions  in  a
 patriotic lie.
 They canont expound a thesis in which they
 are so unversed,
 So they just repeat a slogan in which they
 have been rehearsed.
 To hide their lack of learning they scream
 and shake their fists,
 And denounce all their opponents as a bunch
 of Communists.
 If you seek for fame and fortune in the varied
 ways of men,
 There is one unfailing system to extoll your
 tongue or pen.
 You don't even need to spell it or define or
 understand;
 No one asks for explanations; all debate on
 it is banned.
 You can charge, accuse, and slander; disre-
 garding truth and facts,
 Without fear of an accounting for the re-
 sults of your acts.
 All your writings will be published;  your
 opinions hailed as wise,
 Even though they lack coherence-Heaven
 help him who denies.
 Tame as a news commentator or note as a
 columnist,
 Waits for him who tries to teach us how to
 hate a Communist.
 Let us do away with wisdom, all the arts and
 liberty,
 Lest they delude and lead us into true democ-
 racy.
 What's the use of constitutions or the broth-
 erhood of man,
 When they provide protection for the com-
 munistic clan?
 Who depend upon our justice and rely upon
 our truth,
 Till we destroy our heritage in fighting them
 forsooth.
 For despite all our denials, here's a fact that
 still persists,
 We are losing truth and freedom in our war
 on Communists.
 THE MARCH OF THE HUNGRY MEN
 (Blessed are the poor for theirs is the
 kingdom.)
 "The lowly of earth are stirring,
 Like a giant aroused from sleep.
 As the host of a storm advancing;
 The rumble grows steady and deep.
 Give heed to the crowding masses-
 From desert, dungeon, and den;
 The tramp of the earth's forsaken;
 The march of the hungry men.
 "For the promise of old they gather;
 From the jungle and cave they came;
 Crawling, falling, and struggling;
 Through slaughter, famine, and flame.
 Theyfollow their crucified leaders
 To battle with tongue and pen-
 For the heritage God has promised
 The army of hungry men.
 "In the ease of their downy couches-
 Through the dreams of their pampered
 sleep;
 The Lords of the World are tossing,
 As terrors upon them creep;
 The clamor of starving millions
 Is ringing from crag and fen;
 While the city canyons echo
 The tramp of the hungry men.
 "in vain are the pleas to Jehovah;
 In vain the diversion of war;
 The people ere girding for battle
 Ask-'What are we fighting for?'
 For quarrels and spoils of the Masters,
 They will not be puppets again;
 But march now as brothers united;
 The legions of hungry men.
 "Through the fear of created darkness,
 As the dawn invades the night;
 They are coming, as it is written;
 Their banners ablaze with light.
 Tomorrow-as God has promised,
 Will come the fulfillment; when
 The kingdom will be given
 To the hands of the hungry men."
 They ask for bread and we give them bul-
 lets; for the wounds of oppression we offer
 the salve of charity.  But eventually and
 inevitably, individually and collectively, we
 must account to and settle with eternity on
 the basis of truth and justice.

 Hon. ERNEST GRUENING,

 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR GRUENING: Our heavy hearts
 were eased by your informed and concerned
 plea for a cease-fire in Vietnam, at the San.
 Francisco Masonic Auditorium Sunday, April.
 4.  We indeed share your view that this is
 the most rational  and  feasible means  of
 creating  the  proper  climate  for realistic
 negotiations.  The American Friends Service
 Committee and other sponsoring groups, felt
 that the very responsive audience of over
 2,000 was the largest peace meeting they
 could recall here.
 The periodic standing ovations must have
 convinced you of audience support and deter-
 mination to pursue every channel to per..
 suade our Government to reverse its blindly
 dangerous military policy in Vietnam.
 While the President's address at  Johns
 Hopkins University, had some hopeful as-
 pects, the consensus here was that the ad-
 ministration's position was too self-righteous
 and we were still pugnaciously assuming the
 role of "world policeman"; that those even
 slightly informed on the background of Indo-
 china simply cannot accept the dishonest
 propaganda reiterated so blatantly to sell
 our war strategy; that it is demeaning to
 one's intelligence.
 ' A large group here met Saturday night,
 April  10,  to hear  a  radio  rebroadcast  of
 Steve Allen's objective coverage of the Viet-
 nam dilemma.   Their expressed hope was
 that such rationality as you and he detailed
 should be acessible to all the Nation and
 that our policymakers ponder and imple-
 ment this wisdom even at this late hour.
 Again, we greatly admire and respect the
 effort, traveling-strain and time involved,
 which you have contributed so generously
 for our country and the world.  We earnestly
 -pray for your continued health and strength.
 Gratefully,
 Mrs. GRETA SLATER.

 April 13, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR KUCHEL: In response to your
 letter received today on South Vietnam en-
 closing your views as outlined in speeches
 to the Senate, I am enclosing copy of my
 letter to Senator GRUENING.    This expresses
 generally the feeling of all those we know
 and that of the various groups to which we
 belong.
 In fact,  the opposition to, our Govern-
 ment's military policy in South Vietnam is
 so general it is noticeably uniting the com-
 mon voter of both parties in this shared
 protest., This feeling has been so predom-
 inant that many have expressed loss of con-
 fidence in achieving world peace through
 political channels and are delving into the
 potentials of a genuine people to people's
 movement.
 Qualified authorities on southeast Asia
 have made frequent references to the book,
 "The Battle of Dienbienphu" by Jules Roy
 (Harper & Row); also to "France Against
 Herself" by the Swiss author Herbert Luthy
 (Praeger, New York).  It is planned by many
 interested here to have these books reviewed
 shortly at a,meeting concerning our Govern-
 ment's most unpopular military policy in
 Vietnam.
 In conclusion, the common comment is
 that one can not recall a situation where
 opposition to Government policy has ever
 been so unequivocal, articulate, and wide-
 spread as their position on South Vietnam.
 Sincerely yours,
 MIS. G. M. SLATER.

 IT'S UP TO CONGRESS
 The language of the President's speech on
 Vietnam was eloquent, but unrelated to the
 realities of the situation,  If a resolution
 were introduced in Congress to declare war
 against North Vietnam, the American people
 would overwhelmingly oppose It.
 The Congress of the United States has no
 right to place the responsibility or authority
 for this conflict upon the President.  The
 Congress has no right to pass resolutions giv-
 ing the President the equivalent of the power
 to declare. war.
 The Vietnamese want the Americans to
 get out of Vietnam, and that is what we
 should have done long ago.  France won't
 support the United States position and other
 NATO allies have given at most token sup-
 port.  It is not our responsibility to go it
 alone in Vietnam, . If we continue to do that,
 we shall be embroiled in wars all over the
 world.

 President JOHNSON,
 The White House, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I agree with Senators
 GRUENING and MORSE that the war in South
 Vietnam is a civil war, that America has
 flaunted the Geneva Convention of 1954 and
 that we are aggressors.
 With this concept of the actual condi-
 tions,  "unconditional  discussions"  merely
 sounds like a maneuver to shift world public
 opinion away from them toward us.
 Unless your humanitarianism and com-
 passion, so magnificently demonstrated in
 your struggle for the Great Society and civil
 rights extends, not only to all Americans,
 but to all the world, you and your adminis-
 tration will be condemned now and in the
 future, if there is any, by enlightened man-
 kind.
 I  urge  an  immediate  cessation  of  the
 bombings. I urge an immediate reevalua-
 tion of our policy in South Vietnam.                                                                              I urge
 you to  focus  your  compassion,  humani-
 tarianism, and great powers of leadership
 on a genuine struggle for peace in that area
 of the world.
 Sincerely,
 LANSDOWNE, PA.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am very much in
 opposition to the President on his Vietnam
 policy.  I think the bombing should stop
 at once and all policy should be taken to
 the  United  Nations.  There  shouldn't  be
 unilateral action in such a matter-that is
 for the body that represents the people of
 the world.
 Even more am I in opposition to those
 who would start a preventive war-who will
 use some excuse to bomb China.
 Johnson's blank check to use force in Asia
 should be revoked.  I'm glad you and GRUEN-
 INo voted against it but am frightened that
 everyone else went along.

 awesome questions.  I would do nothing to
 make your task more difficult.  I also appre-
 ciate highly the gracious manner in which
 you express your dissent from me in the
 matter of Vietnam,  and hope  that  I am
 reciprocating.
 Like you I deplore foreign aggression, in-
 ternational illegality, terrorism, hoodlumism,
 and the violation of solemn commitments
 by anybody, but I deplore them most when
 they are perpetrated in my name by my
 Government.
 The most honorable commitment we made
 with respect to Vietnam was the promise not
 to interfere in the implementation of the
 Geneva agreements of 1954.  This promise
 was not kept.  For details I refer you to the
 enclosed document, which I have hesitated
 to send you because the reproduction is so
 bad.  Key West weather, perfect for most
 purposes, is not very friendly to gelatine
 sheet duplicating machines.
 My concern is that Americans know all
 the pertinent facts.  In this matter  both
 the administration and the news media have
 been remiss, and we cannot have democratic
 solutions to problems on these terms.   To
 anyone aware of the facts, the President's
 recent presentation must seem something
 less than completely straightforward; this
 opinion seems to be shared by the most per-
 ceptive of our news commentators.
 Of course we have the power to destroy
 Vietnam,  and  we probably shall.  But we
 shall live to be sorry.

 Senator WAYNE
 U.S. Senate.
 HONORABLE SIR: We have admired you and
 Senator GRUENING for your outspoken efforts
 to get the United States to hand the prob-
 lem of Vietnam over to the United Nations
 and to get our troops out of there.
 However, Technocracy Inc. informs us that
 in the past 25 years, the United States has
 spent $980 billion, $973 million, for war, and
 preparation for war.
 Technocracy Inc. has suggested that if war
 seems to be such a necessity to our economy,
 that we should declare war on the millions
 of square miles of the Pacific Ocean, as this
 would be an area that could never surrender,
 nor fight back, and it could absorb all of our
 production for many years to come.
 Having peace would make it imperative
 that we solve some of our domestic problems,
 perhaps this would involve social change,
 and we could start creating a civilization
 that would be worthy of man's intelligence.
 Enclosed please find some of our literature
 for your earnest study, and comment.
 Please continue your  efforts to  get the
 Vietnam war stopped.
 We thank you in advance, for your reply

 ing ignorance. At
 any rate, all of us now are reaping the fruits
 of price system sabotage and the social emer-
 gency that has been created.
 Now, that some of the arrogance has been
 knocked out of us by current events on the
 international scene, some people are giving
 pause to look at. our social circumstances a
 little more objectively than in recent years.
 Outstanding is the total lack of a national
 objective of any kind.  There is_ no social
 unity, and little national pride except in our
 bigness and in certain philosophic words,
 phrases and ideas .that no longer apply in
 this age of science.  These things aren't
 reason enough in a world that is moving as
 fast as this one.  The cult of individualism,
 which we think we believe in, but which in
 fact we can't evenpractice, dominates the
 social attitude required to survive and pro-
 gress upward and forward in this scientific
 era.
 We are finding that it was most unfortu-
 nate to allow reactionary minorities to in-
 timidate and belittle those individuals who
 could appreciate and work with science;
 and to make science almost a dirty word to
 citizens ofthis continent, especially the
 youngsters.  It is,._ tpo bad that the social
 consciousne,-s of -the average youth is at the
 moronic level of burning rubber from the

 Among the older generations, it

 "sold out" to the price system in an attempt
 to amass a few pieces of shoddy goods and an

 rendered obsolete the social attitude and the
 price system of the continent.  But that oc-
 currence has not stopped us from continuing
 to use the old system.  Therein lies the cru-
 cial conflict.  It is a battle to the death for
 one or the other.  No one can say with abso-
 lute certainty what the final outcome will be.
 We do know that we live by science and tech-
 nology; therefore, the decision of each North
 American had better be in favor of these
 social forces.  Our utter failure, as a people,
 to recognize the problem and to act is push-
 ing us into the category of a second-class
 power, with the prospect of much worse social
 consequences to come, unless there is a wide-
 spread revival of social consciousness.
 Since the North American Continent is
 without a governing mechanism that is capa-
 ble of supplying the leadership and direction
 required to guide us out of the present mess,
 the question arises: What can anyone else
 do about it?
 At some point in time in the future, prob-
 ably all too soon, the mass of people on this
 continent is going to be jolted into action by
 the pressure of events.    When this mass
 movement begins, it had better be directed
 by an organization that knows the score.
 As conditions  become more intolerable,  a
 social ferment will develop, producing the
 mass movement which will be largely de-
 void of intelligent understanding.
 While Technocracy, Inc. Is not designed to
 be a governing mechanism, Technocracy, the
 method, is so designed.  When we consider
 that 40 years of engineering and scientific
 research have gone into Technocracy, we be-
 gin to understand why it is qualified to dis-
 cuss comprehensively, and with the correct
 insight,  problems  before  North  America.
 What we are attempting to make clear is that
 we North Americans have a course of action
 to take to solve our problems.  Technocracy
 is born of science, it is being presented in
 an organized way, and its organization has
 'the  leadership  to  see  us  through social
 change on this continent.  What more do we

 vast resources of this continent, makes it pos-

 provide an abundance of goods and services

 every North American.
 Technocracy builds on the solid rock of
 fact and is not involved in emotional vagaries

 factual approach to America's social problem.
 Technocracy's social design includes the

 North American Continent.
 Technocracy, Inc. is building a trained and
 disciplined organization capable of meeting
 the demands of the march of events.  This
 organization-the  technological  army  of
 the  new  America--is  designed  to  show
 the people of this continent how to assure
 the continued functioning of the equipment
 on this continent.  A severe break in the

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I was thrilled with
 your speech (on film)  shown at this rally
 at Swarthmore College.  I admire your con-
 tinued  courage to                                                                                                                                     speak  out.   There  are
 many who feel strongly against our Govern-
 ment policy on Vietnam.
 P.S.-I carried this with me to Washing-
 ton yesterday when I went on the protest
 march on Vietnam (but didn't pass a mail
 box).  It was thrilling to be a part of such
 a large gathering but today I wonder, How
 can we really make our voices heard and
 have-things changed?   God forgive us for
 what we have done and are doing.

 SWARTHMORE  COLLEGE,
 April 1965.'
 Contradiction and confusion have been the
 norm of the war in Vietnam. There is hope-
 ful talk of negotiations from both sides, but
 there has been in recent weeks a steady ex-
 pansion of the war by the United States.
 We must assess events of the past months
 and closely examine the directions of coan-
 fliting policy.  We must, as citizens deeply
 concerned  about  peace,  consider possible
 courses for the future.
 Therefore, while registering our protest of
 present policy, we are following the examples
 of  the University of Michigan,  Columbia,
 Temple, and the University of Pennsylvania
 by calling for a teach-in at Swarthmore on
 April 7 from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m.  The proposed
 program includes speeches by professors and
 outside  experts  and  general   discussions
 in which all may participate.

 Article 33 states: "The parties to any dis-
 pute, the continuance of which is likely to
 endanger the maintenance of international
 peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a
 solution by negotiation, inquiry, mediation,

 the United States has signed, would clearly
 seem to require negotiation before bombing,
 not after.
 Under article 51, the United States re-
 ported to the Security Council on February
 7 that the bombing raids on North Vietnam
 were "defensive action."  Article 51 provides
 that: "Nothing in the present Charter shall
 impair the inherent right of individual or
 collective self-defense if an armed attack
 occurs against a Member of the United Na-

 measures necessary to maintain interna-

 Member of the United Nations. The impli-

 the United States could make which might

 Vietnam;
 (b) A willingness to negotiate with the
 NLF;
 (c) A readiness to abide by the results of
 a free and supervised election in South Viet-

 Vietnam as proposed in the Geneva Ac-
 cords of 1954; and
 (d) Some  indication  that  the  United

 the conference table before rather than after
 widespread violence and war?
 CROWN POINT, IND.,
 April 12, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE : Thank you for your
 courageous stand on Vietnam.
 Respectfully,
 Mr. and Mrs. DAVID GRATNER.
 APRIL 12, 1965.
 HONORABLE        SIR: May God's blessings be
 upon you, for informing your people, on the
 wrong being committed in Vietnam and the
 threat to all mankind if this war is not con-
 trolled.  Peace, through negotiation is our
 only hope. For it is only in peace can a war
 against poverty and other ills be most ef-
 fective.  I fervently pray that our Nation
 will take the lead in seeking peaceful solu-?
 tions, as not only would we gain honor and
 dignity-but all of the peoples on this earth
 would be forever grateful.  It could begin
 with this Easter week-calling for a mora-
 torium,  as  suggested  by                                                                                                                                      Lester  Pearson
 (Prime Minister of Canada).  In the mean-
 time-above all else-please keep on talking.
 could he be expected to at this stage, the
 amount of Vietcong participation in an in-
 dependent  South  Vietnam  Government.
 Would the United States and South Vietnam
 agree to NLF representation in the Cabinet?
 If so, how many would there be? in what
 posts?  If South Vietnam Is to be an inde-
 pendent country, would the United States
 be prepared to see South Vietnam move, over
 the course of a few years, to union with
 North Vietnam-as envisaged by the original
 Geneva accords of 19547  Would the United
 States be prepared to support a Titoist type
 government in Vietnam?  These questions
 ought to be faced and discussed openly in
 the United States if there is to be any hope
 for a negotiated solution in Vietnam.
 On the Senate floor March 25, Senator
 GEORGE  AIxEN, of Vermont, stressed that
 North Vietnam does not want to be a Chinese
 satellite.  Senator MIKE MANSFIELD, of Mon-
 tana, noted that there has been more than
 1,000 years of enmity between the Viet-
 namese people and the "Chinese colossus to
 the north."
 In a little-noticed speech at Johns Hop-
 kins, March 12, Senator J. W. FULBRIGHT, of
 Arkansas, made a general remark relevant
 to the situation in Vietnam: "I think we
 ought  to  ask  ourselves,  hypothetically,
 whether a  Communist regime that      loans
 away from China is worse or better from the
 viewpoint of our political and strategic in-
 nam.- But since the beginning of the year,                       terests than a non-Communist state, such as
 the United States has done nothing to can      Indonesia or Cambodia, that leans toward
 a session of the Security Council as is im-    China."

 Government is committing the same error

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  The press, and the
 younger Members of Congress tossed-their
 hats in the air over a few crumbs of peaceful
 talk from the President's table at Johns Hop-

 mained calm amid the tumult.  The refusal
 of the United States to face the fact that
 this is a civil war which in fact has been
 lost, not by us, but by the 21-odd Saigon
 governments we have leagued ourselves with
 leaves things pretty much the way they were
 before the President launched his equivocal
 peace overtures.

 not that Clos has said anything that has
 not been reported before in the better news
 media here  and abroad, but he does say
 it pungently, and also  throws some light
 on how the Saigon government's defeat has
 come about, and what program and future
 the Vietcong are holding out to the people
 of Vietnam.

 Nguyen gets 1,750 piastres a month, about
 $18.  His lieutenant receives a salary of $80.
 Eighteen dollars is not a small sum in Viet-
 nam, but Nguyen thinks he would be more
 useful in his own village.  Biit, it's not only
 a  dAestion  of  this.   Theoretically  he  is
 drafted for 3 years, but this is already the
 5th year he's been in uniform. The war con-
 tinually gets harder. The Vietcong continu-
 ally are better armed.                         Life for him is very
 tough. The Vietcong propaganda says: "Why
 do you fight us?  The war will eventually
 ,end.  The Americans will leave.  Go over the
 hill now, or do not fight when you are at-
 tacked.  Keep still, and nothing will happen
 to you."
 Nguyen, to say the least, is upset.  He
 knows his village Is controlled by the Viet-
 cong.  He knows also that if he is wounded,
 he will be poorly cared for because there is
 a scarcity of doctors and medicine. More-
 over, the military hospitals are crowded with
 wounded.  They are stacked four and five
 high under the tarpaulins which extend the
 roofs of the hospitals.  The wounded pain-
 fully line up to go to the latrines which are
 always jammed and to get a drink of water
 at the scarce fountains. Nguyen knows also
 that if he loses an arm or a leg, he will be
 left without any chance to make a living-
 and he Is not more than 20.  So, sometimes,
 when he is on guard around the compound
 of the big-shot Americans with their laughter
 ringing in his ears, he asks himself what he
 will do if the Vietcong attack.
 The Americans :are bitter. They have been
 disillusioned by Vietnam.  They say: "These
 ,,people are incomprehensible. We come here
 to save them from Communist slavery, and
 they couldn't care less."
 The Americans carry with them their al-
 -most insane horror of communism.  They
 apply here all the fatuous ideas they have
 on the subject in the States.  For them the
 problem-is simple: The Vietnamese are di-
 vided neatly into two groups, the Vietcong
 and the anti-Vietcong, that is, the pro and
 the anti-Communists. These two groups, by

 tical theory.  What they do is propose con-'
 crete solutions to. concrete problems.  These
 problems are not difficult to state.  They are,
 in the order of their importance, the return
 of peace, the reestablishment of law and
 order, and    better  management    of   public
 affairs.
 What the Vietcong leaders say to the peas-
 ants, and what all the officials down the line
 repeat, is this:
 "You have nothing to pay to the landlords
 who have taken refuge in Saigon.  The land
 belongs to the man who farms It.   Don't
 worry, if someone tries  to persecute you,
 we will protect you."
 . When, under Diem, the program of stra-
 tegic hamlets was tried, the Vietcong argued:
 "Don't let yourselves be locked up in dis-
 guised concentration camps.  No one has
 the right to force you to leave your homes.
 Resist.  We will help you.  If you can't help
 it, cooperate, but help us later to destroy the
 hamlets."
 When the Government tries to draft, the
 Vietcong tells the parents: "Don't let your
 children go.  The Saigon government wants
 them to be killed to advance the objectives
 of the Americans.  Hide them.  In an emerg-
 ency, send them to the areas we hold.  We
 will make use of them."
 The families with boys in service are told:
 "Have them desert, and no harm will come to
 them.  If they don't we will be forced to kill
 them."
 In a revolutionary period, propaganda is
 worthless if it does not put out a concrete
 --a.ction  program.   The  Vietcong  tells  the
 population: "You are oppressed by corrupt
 men representing a government which has
 sold out to a foreign country."
 On hearing this the peasants look around.
 The chief of the province appointed by the
 Saigon Government lives in a big house,
 drives a Mercedes, and loads his wife with
 jewelry.  The Governor is a man of impor-
 tance who is approached with deference, pro-
 tected by police, soldiers, and assistants. His
 Vietcong opposite number can be seen every

 conviction, after becoming master of their
 heart and head.  The Saigon Government also
 has tried to win over the people.  This was
 under Diem, but it was all a matter of exter-
 nals.                                                                                                                                    I was well acquainted with Ngo Dinh
 Nhu, the brother of the dead President.  He
 was the regime's man of theory.      He was
 obsessed with the idea of having at his com-
 mand, as the Vietcong does, an army of fanat-
 ical partisans who would go from village to
 village, from man to man, doing the kind of
 work the Vietcong has done.  He never could
 develop a corps of this kind, however, because
 there are no competent people of this kind
 who side with the Saigon Government, and
 he didn't have time to create them.
 With the fall ofiDiem the Vietcong machine
 preempted this field of activity.  One Saigon
 government after another fell.   There was a
 confusing succession of heads of state and
 commanders  in chief.   There was    a con-
 tinual turnover of important civil and mili-
 tary officials who were killed, jailed, silenced,
 fired, and recalled.
 The people have this picture to look at.
 On one side there is a real government, law
 and order, and responsible people.  On the
 other side, chaos, anarchy, and disorder.  The
 people chose those who had won the contest.
 Against  this  bombs  and  strafing        mean
 nothing.
 If the National Liberation Front imposed
 itself by clever propaganda and by profes-
 sional leadership, it also offered a political
 program designed to win adherence.
 The Vietnamese are by nature distrustful
 and  sensitive  to  possible  trickery.  They
 don't swallow naively the arguments of the
 Vietcong leaders.   They know perfectly well
 what they have to fear from the installation
 in South Vietnam of a government compar-
 able to the one imposed by the Vietminh on
 North Vietnam.      They don't want a govern-
 ment of that kind at any price.  They pas-
 sionately want two things: First, not to be
 subjected to the North Vietnamese Govern-
 ment which they detest, and second, not to
 see installed in the south a political and
 economic system less humane than that of
 Hanoi.
 The National Liberation Front, with the
 approval of Hanoi, gives pleasing assurances
 on all of these different points.  First, it
 stresses that it is a question of a front, and
 not of a single party.  It's not the Marxist
 Party alone, but the Popular Revolutionary
 Party-a party made up of 20 other groups.
 It is therefore necessary to make out the
 Popular Revolutionary Party plays an essen-
 tial role in the conduct of the struggle, but
 it is known that neither the president nor
 the secretary of the front are members of the
 Popular Revolutionary Party, and that only
 one of the front's five vice presidents  is
 affiliated  with  the  Popular Revolutionary
 Party.
 The program of the front is one that could
 not be more reassuring.     To read it, it is
 for a sort of liberal Socialist government.
 It is precise in providing for the retention
 of the right to private property, that private
 industry and commerce will be encouraged,
 that the property of French citizens will be
 protected.  In foreign affairs, diplomatic re-
 lations will be established with all countries
 "without distinction as to political system."
 Economic, cultural, and technical aid will
 be sought from countries "having different
 political systems."  It is the same as saying
 that Vietnam will be a friend of the United
 States.  Lastly,  the  separate  existence  of
 South Vietnam is promised.       On reunifica-
 tion of the two Vietnams the program says:
 "The question will be determined by the two
 parts * * * subject to the proviso that one
 part will not swallow up the other."
 All  observers  are in  agreement  on  one
 point: The program and the conduct of the
 National Liberation Front have won it the

 adherence,  enthusiastic  or resigned, of  a
 very large part of the Vietnamese population.
 This is a fact which becomes particularly
 clear when one interviews middle class and
 intellectual people in Saigon.  One of them
 summarizes the problem in this way: "We
 have a choice between two solutions: to wage
 an endless war while every day placing our-
 selves more at the mercy of the Americans,
 and without any guarantee that this will
 end in aelearcut victory, or categorically to
 demand the end of the war and trust to the
 good  faith  of  the  National  Liberation
 Front's leaders and to their willingness to
 carry out a program which to us appears
 acceptable."
 Before that vast majority who above all
 want  peace  and the  fulfillment  of their
 hopes, there is one minor obstacle:  some
 generals who command troops ready to die
 like the troops of all ages.  There is also
 a  major  obstacle  presented by  the open
 intervention of the United    States in the
 Indochinese war.    One thing at least is sure:
 the fiction that American     military power
 has been introduced upon demand of a
 people fighting communism no longer holds
 today.
 Senator MORSE, as Senator from Oregon
 and a welcome critic of the official policy in
 Vietnam, I particularly want you to read a
 copy of my letter to the President:
 SAN Jost, COSTA RICA,
 April 11, 1965.
 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I want to thank you
 for your on-the-whole, excellent speech at
 Johns Hopkins offering a new resolution to
 the Vietnam crisis.
 I am thrilled with the offer of an extensive
 development plan for southeast Asia which
 is to be cooperative in nature and to be ad-
 ministered by the  U.N.   The  sum  of  $1
 billion seems adequate to do the job and is
 certainly generous. I approve of your nam-
 ing Secretary of 'the U.N., U Thant, as a man
 who would be in a particularly good posi-
 tion to know the problems and to bring a
 peaceful solution to this strife-torn area.  I
 was very pleased to have you call upon all
 the countries of the U.N. to participate in
 the plan, including Russia.
 However, I was not entirely pleased by all
 of your speech, by any means.  You stated
 that U.S. forces will remain in South Viet-
 nam so that the people of that country will
 be governed as they wish.  I believe that
 until the whole Vietnam area is neutralized,
 both North Vietnam and South Vietnam,
 and all foreign soldiers and equipment are
 removed from the area--which means Ameri-
 can, as well as other-then there will be no
 hope  for a democratic  government there.
 There certainly is not such a government in
 South Vietnam-now.  Walter Lippmann has
 pointed out that even the military dictator-
 ship which is now functioning                   in South
 Vietnam only counts the large centers of
 population under its control and not the
 open countryside.  When we examine Ameri-
 can reasons for being in Vietnam, we find
 them full of superficial thinking and con-
 fusion.
 I believe that your insistence in the Johns
 Hopkins  speech    of  continuing  air  raids
 against North Vietnam is part of the con-
 fusion of U.S. policy toward Vietnam.                       You
 offer peace and bountiful self-development
 with one hand and armed destruction with
 the other.  Which policy is the real policy?
 Which is what you really paean?
 It is time to decide for the peaceful policy
 of construction with the help of U Thant and
 the U.N.  It is time to face the futility and
 foolishness of continuing an aggressive mili-
 tary policy in southeast Asia.  Such a policy
 can only stave off the day when you have to
 come to terms with mainland China on a
 live-and-let-live policy for southeast Asia.
 Very truly yours,
 Mrs. CHESTER M. PATTERSON, Jr.
 SAN DIEGO, CALIF.,
 April 13, 1965.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Senator ERNEST GRUENING,                  -
 Senator FRANC CHURCH.
 DEAR SENATORS: You deserve the deep ap-
 preciation and utmost support from every
 citizen, for your efforts to end the disgraceful
 war in Vietnam.  If only the true facts could
 be presented to everyone, through our mass-
 communication media, then the war would
 end tomorrow.    Forgive me for not writing
 three separate, individual letters to each of
 you, but there are so many letters of protest
 (not commendation), that I must send to
 those who favor the administration's insane
 "escalation" policy.
 No doubt your mail is heavy, so I will be
 brief.  I am enclosing a copy of a letter which
 I wrote to President Johnson (before his re-
 cent double-talk speech).  Part of his speech
 seemed conciliatory, but his actions show
 that he is still following the advice of Gold-
 water and the military strategists.
 I am writing this letter while in a mood of
 despair and near desperation.  Many of my
 friends say I am just wasting time, sending
 protest letters to President Johnson, Dean
 Rusk, McGeorge Bundy, etc., that the ball is
 rolling too fast now towards big general war
 for everyone to stop it.  If President Johnson
 will not listen to the advice of wise, principled
 statesmen such as  MORSE,  GRUENING, and
 CHURCH, then there is no chance that an
 ordinary citizen can make his voice heard.
 But, somehow the voices of protest must
 not be silenced.  I have never before taken
 part  in any demonstration, or march for
 peace or civil rights or anything.  But now-
 now perhaps there is still time for me to take
 a plane to Washington and join those who
 will be marching to end the Vietnam war, on
 April 17.
 Please  do not allow the war hawks to
 silence you and I pray that the list of legis-
 lators who support your views will grow big-
 ger and bigger.  Now I must hurry.  I will
 write protest letters while in Washington.
 Most sincerely,
 SAN DIEGO, CALIF.,
 April 4, 1965.
 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: It is not easy for an
 American  citizen  who  loves        his  country
 dearly, to speak out critically against actions
 taken by his President. Yet I cannot keep
 silent about the horrifying, impractical, and
 indefensible (both morally and legally) ac-
 tions which are now being carried out in
 Vietnam by the U.S. Government.
 Last fall I was one of many trusting citi-
 zens who really believed that you fully in-
 tended to take positive steps toward dis-
 engagement in South Vietnam, just as soon
 as the elections were over.  Yes, millions of
 us ordinary citizens believed your campaign
 statements and we gave you the "mandate
 for peace" that you asked for.  But now-
 now you are embracing, and carrying out, the
 worst aspects of Goldwaterism.
 Why, just think how terrible-to be sucked
 into a long, hopeless war such as France
 tackled for 8 years?  What if our casualties
 should equal those suffered by France?  Also
 the end result- would be the same.  Are we
 in South Vietnam at the request of a freely
 elected and popular government?  We do not
 need a beachhead in southeast Asia anymore
 than we need a beachhead In Korea, as the
 advent of nuclear power and ICBM's has
 made such beachheads obsolete.   We have
 had about 55,000 soldiers guarding the 38th
 parallel for 15 years.  It would take three or
 four times that many soldiers to guard the
 frontiers of South Vietnam, if we should win
 and then would the Pentagon be satisfied?
 And would  the  South Vietnamese  people
 then be allowed to have the free elections
 that  were promised  them  in  the Geneva
 agreements, or would we find another Diem?
 Then the military strategists would increase
 pressure on Cambodia and Laos, saying that
 we must make the "domino theory" operate
 in reverse. Then Russia and China would
 patch up their differences and we would face
 worldwide nuclear war.
 Mr. President, I sincerely believe that you
 really want to be a good President and to be
 remembered in our history books as a man of
 peace.  But you are under tremendous pres-
 sure.                                                                                                                                    As Columnist Marquis Childs wrote it
 the Republican. San Diego Tribune on Apri:
 1, 1965:
 "While he [Goldwater] approved the step,-
 taken to carry the war to North Vietnam, h(
 went on to say he had a terrible feeling that
 turning tail and coming home is what tht
 Johnson administration has in mind.  It
 short he  [Goldwater]  was identifying th(
 political trap, and if his opponent of las
 November should fall into it, he will is
 heard from loud and long."
 Mr. President have you forgotten that thin
 man's views were repudiated at the poM
 overwhelmingly, just last November?
 Yes, the Goldwaterites will howl loudly (ii
 you turn away from suicidal war), but not
 for long.  A few Gallup polls will show that
 the millions who voted for you will applaud
 your courage, and will reelect you again, and
 even more overwhelmingly.  The moderate
 Republicans would also applaud and only
 the Goldwaterites would say you were turn-
 ing tail but, if you continue to appease the
 Goldwaterites then you will be handing them
 a campaign issue on a silver platter.  The
 Republicans will soon begin to talk and act
 like a peace party saying: "The Democrats
 always get us into war.  Eisenhower stopped
 Truman's Korean war and now we must elect
 Gov. George Romney as President so he can
 stop Johnson's war in South Vietnam."
 Mr. President, please listen to wise states-
 men like Senators  MORSE,  GRUENING,  and
 CHURCH.
 Sincerely,
 J. L. MINER.

 S. The Constitution and its amendments,
 the supreme law of the land, was planned

 only such a policy will serve our own best
 Interests.

 PERTINENT COMMENT
 Cicero's natural law is consistent with and
 has been embodied in the doctrine of the
 Christian church.
 Montagu's  book  furnishes  a  scientific
 basis for the interpretation of Cicero.
 The above two books may easily be the
 most important to appear in the past cen-

 12. It is seldom safe to attempt firm con-
 clusions regarding interpretation scientific-
 ally of historical events.  However, answers
 to  the  following  questions,  if  available,
 would be pertinent to our situation in Viet-
 nam:
 (i) Why were the Romans, despite the use
 of terrible tortures of thousands of Chris-
 tians over long periods, unable to stamp out
 the new religion?
 (ii) Why, after nearly half a century of
 planning,  with meticulous attention paid
 to everything, except human nature, did the
 Kaiser and his war party lose the Battle of
 the Marne, and hence lose the war and the
 Second Reich?
 (iii) Why, with the great advantages of
 arming, initiative, and overwhelming nu-
 merical superiority, did Hitler and his war
 party lose the Battle of Britain, and hence
 lose World War II and the Third Reich?
 (iv) Why, despite the very great amount
 of arms and money poured by the United
 States into the support of Chiang Kai-shek's
 regime, were the Communists able to take
 over all of China?
 (v) Why did the French lose the Battle of
 Dienbienphu and with it lose Indochina?
 (vi) Why, despite the very great amounts
 of money and armament poured by the
 United States into Vietnam, have we not won
 the war?
 COMMENT
 Mr. President, you have inherited in Viet-
 nam a problem and a policy.  The policy has
 not worked and the problem has steadily
 worsened.  An Asian war now threatens.
 Why not work out and establish a new
 policy? It has been said that the proper sub-
 ject for the study of mankind is man.  Why
 not study man?
 SUGGESTION
 (A) Set up at once a high-level Presiden-
 tial Advisory Committee to seek answers to
 the questions on page 3 of this letter, and
 to recommend a policy on Vietnam, with time
 limit set.
 Suggested  personnel:  Ashley  Montagu,
 Martin Luther King, Jr., Sergeant Shriver,
 Robert M. Hutchins, Virgil M. Newton, social
 scientists.
 (B)  Refer to the World Court, via the
 United,,Wations, for adjudication, the prob-
 lem of Vietnam, together with your proposed
 new policy: the Johnson policy.
 (C) Accept the World Court verdict and
 implement it wholeheartedly.
 NoTE.-The above suggestion  is entirely
 consistent with the recommendations of the
 400 professors from 20 universities in the
 New York Times of February 16.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I had, in the past,
 written my approval of your attempts to
 encourage negotiations in Vietnam.
 On March 20, the western edition of the
 Christian Science Monitor carried an article
 entitled "Air Raids:  U.S. Lid on Debate."
 The sense of this article along with others
 point to a movement toward ever greater in-
 volvement in a questionable war without
 even considering alternative solutions.
 Since  even consideration of alternatives
 seems to be successfully squelched by pro-
 ponents of further escalation in official cir-
 cles, it is more important than ever that al-
 ternatives be examined in the light of day
 by the public.  I can think of no greater
 tragedy  than   a  deepening  involvement
 merely because we didn't think the issue
 through.
 In line with this feeling I would like yo
 to send me some copies of your speech deal
 Ing with Vietnam.  These will be placed o:
 the social concerns committee table of m',
 church.

 H,OxORARI,E SIR;- Since xz ylast' letter, you

 ponent of Barry Goldwater and all that he
 stood for.                                             combine with those of U Thant Mr. Lester
 In the issue dated March 23, 1865, the fol-"Pearson, President 'de  Gaulle, and  other
 lowing was written:
 "Are these just isolated incidents, of no
 importance? Do they portend a major stra-
 tegic turn in U.S. foreign policy, a decision
 to take a hard line against aggression of all
 sorts and to protect every last acre of the
 free world?  Probably not.  Certainly it's too
 soon to pronounce the verdict, one way or the
 other,  But these are signs of at least a tem-
 porary tactical turn, of a coolheaded effort
 to test out the will of our own people, of our
 allies, and of the enemy."
 Although one should never be judged by
 the company one keeps, it should be little
 source of comfort to you to know that your
 activities in Vietnam are approved by that
 voice of extremism.
 We can only guess what their reaction will
 be to the use of gas warfare by the United

 MY DEAR SENATOR MORSE: While not a con-

 courageous and outspoken stand on the sit-
 uation in Vietnam, and to urge you to con-
 tinue to press for negotiations.  Our "save
 face escalation','.-In tlkat unfortunate. little
 country seems to have cost us the support
 of the world.  The support which we claim
 to have front the British Government seems
 to be most reluctant and uneasy. I am en-
 closing a troubled editorial from the March
 10 edition of the Manchester Cauardl`an.
 I hope that those of you in the Senate who
 support a sane, humane, and constructive
 policy will exert all your influence to change
 the perilous course upon which this Nation
 has almost unwittingly embarked under the
 urging of our overzealous military estab-
 lishment.
 Very respectfully,
 ELIZABETH NORTH.
 Whether or not the Prime Minister's state-
 ments on Vietnam in the -Commons yesterday
 satisfy his Labour critics they are probably
 as good  as we  can                              expect.   Disingenu-
 ous, of course-particularly the quick ref-
 erences to-the 1954 agreements (a very com-
 plicated story), and to, the change which
 he sees in the war in recent months.  It was
 not to be supposed that in present circum-
 stances he would flatly contradict the Amer-
 ican line.  Nor would it have done any good
 if he had. In fact, his only harsh words
 were directed neither at Mr. Rusk nor at
 the critics of hij own attitude in the Labour
 Party, but at Tory attempts to exploit the
 disagreement between these critics and him-
 self.
 Moreover, he did give an impression of
 activity-talks with Mr. Gromyko next week,
 the Foreign Secretary's journey to Washing-
 ton the week, after.  Probably these efforts
 will have only, a marginal effect on the course
 of events; the end of the war will almost cer-
 tainly bedetermined more by what happens
 in South Vietnam than b  what happens in
 London, or even in Paris,' Peiping, Moscow, or
 Washington.  So it has been throughout;
 what Mr. Wilson"thinks matters less (as no
 doubt he realizes)  than what a handful of
 Saigon . generals  and monks and  a whole
 countryful of other Vietnamese think.  That
 is an additional reason for not wanting to
 offend'the'U.S. Government pointlessly. But
 statesmen to create an atmosphere in which
 negotiations come to seem natural and in-11 evitable.  Here again it is important that
 some of those adding their mediatory pies-
 sure on President Johnson should seem sym-
 pathetic to his dilemma.
 There are, of course, limits.  Washington's
 good opinion is not the sole factor in our
 foreign policy.  It is deeply disturbing that
 a report has been circulated giving the im-
 pression that the British Government sup-
 ports the U.S. air strikes against North Viet-
 nam.  This report has been printed in for-
 eign newspapers and broadcast in the United
 States.  It naturally shocked Mr. Vladimir
 Dediler, as he made clear in a letter to the
 'limes yesterday and it must have shocked
 many others whom we like to feel well dis-
 posed toward us. Apparently it arose from
 a misunderstanding of something a Govern-
 ment spokesman said.  It must be untrue;
 when Mr. Wilson was asked yesterday by a
 Conservative Member of Parliament for an
 assurance that the Government was "sup-
 porting the U.S. Government in the actions
 which they have taken;" it was noticeable
 that he evaded a direct answer.  Instead, he
 took refuge in the truism that "if, the 1954
 agreements were observed, there would, be
 no problem."  But a more definite denial of
 the harp ul report is needed.    The British
 Government may not feel able to condemn
 the raids, but it is not called upon to ap-
 prove them.

 such a stand it certainly must be OK to
 follow my own inclinations on the matter.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Congratulations on
 your firm stand for negotiations to end the
 Vietnam fighting.
 You have demonstrated tremendous cour-

 DEAR Zia: I would like to congratulate you
 for your stand on Vietnam.  That this hoax
 is being perpetrated in the name of freedom
 .and democracy Is Incredible.  The accept-
 ance of this hoax by the American people is
 saddening.  The platitudes voiced by the
 bulk of the U.B. Senate are sickening.  Your
 voice is refreshing.  I thank you.
 Sincerely,
 DENNIS C. WRIGHT.

 fight China (and any allies) in his inter-
 est, regardless                       of  changing world situa-

 ment also provides that United States will
 (would) never sit down in the same U.N. w)th
 representatives of the 700 million real Chi-
 nese.  And it provides (a later codicil in a
 world suicide, pact?) for the earliest possible
 nuclearization of Japan-.
 3. That in the 1950's American economic
 policy (the National Economic Council ab-
 negating world leadership by example) sub-
 verted civilian economic and human produc-
 tivity (butter) to military overkill stockpil-
 ing and space programs-a parasitic growth
 profiting the few via incredible waste of tech-
 nical human manpower and hardware at the
 -expense of domestic nonhardware industry
 and the use of America's productivity of real
 humanly needed'goods and their distribution
 around the world.
 In short, by economically planning the
 parasitic, wasteful, growth in hardware and
 space industry, America in the 1950's and
 1960's became in all major civilian indus-
 tries a second-rate producer in world mar-
 kets * * * ruined its banking and gold stand-
 ing in the world * * * and caused the fol-
 lowing:
 Two-thirds of America's paycheck dollar
 earned by working for Overkill and space-
 racing;
 Only token funds available for domestic
 programs to create better than 97 physicians
 per 100,000 population (1963 figures)
 for new teachers and new schools to replace
 firetraps * * * for  nursery  schools * * *
 for programs against pollution of air and
 water, waste and plunder of our natural re-
 sources * * * for the rebuilding of civilian
 industries like shipbuilding (we built 40 in
 1964, while Russia built over 600, and Japan
 captured the free world markets), like fish-
 ery technology (we are 20 years behind, hire
 foreign advice),-like railroads (the mayhem
 here needs no comment), like housing (out-
 moded building designs and--methods-and
 outrageous graft-keep building down, and
 so make slums of old and new the source and
 result of our rapidly increasing fihpoverish-
 ment and demoralization of fully one-third
 of 'our citizens, black and white), like ma-
 chine tool a}ic) printing equipment companies
 (lack of economic planning has forced these
 to produce overseas, or import, in epidemic
 proportions) * * * and so on ad nauseam.
 The  export to  the  developing nations
 around the world of similar parasitic growth,

 vhich"their economies can even less endure

 DEAR SENATOR WAYNE MORSE: Realizing full
 well the probability of its quick trip to the
 wastebasket, I send you the enclosed com-
 ments on the Vietnam situation, its political
 preelection background as I feel forced to
 view it, and an overview of the depletion and
 subversion of the real human and economic
 strengths of our country.
 All for your consideration In depth, com-
 ment welcome of course.
 All presented with the utmost dedication
 and skill of which I am capable, and hoping
 against hope someone will prove I am wrong
 or, if I am right, set partisan politics and
 greed aside long enough to commit them-
 selves to the revolution necessary in Ameri-

 our suicide course in both areas.
 Publication will result, in time I trust,
 from a more careful presentation of the

 DEAR  SENATOR:   You   have  consistently
 spoken out against this deplorable war in
 Vietnam, correctly foreseeing our increasing
 involvement  and  the Impossibility of our
 goals there. Unfortunately, most others in
 public office are unwilling to discuss openly
 the issues involved, and the premises upon
 which our policy is based.  We are grateful
 for your outspokenness.  You inspire in us
 a mighty urge to move to Oregon.

 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE: Your  courageous

 I know who are not writing you also support
 your stand.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Congratulations on
 your continuing fight against our Vietna-
 mese adventure.  The prospects for negotia-
 tions look slightly better now-probably due
 in large part to the efforts of you and your
 colleagues of like mind-but there is still a
 long way to go.
 I am enclosing back copies of "Toward
 Freedom"  which  illustrate  our  long-time
 interest in giving the Vietnamese people a
 chance to determine their own fate.  In ad-
 dition, your name is on our regular list and
 you should have received our January issue
 with a main article by Hosing Van Chi, an
 anti-Communist - Vietnamese, who courage-
 ously examines American misconceptions and
 mistakes about his country.  If your copy
 7867
 of this issue has been" misplaced we will be
 glad to send you another on request.
 Permit me to call your attention particu-
 larly to our suggestion of a "pro people"
 swap agreement: we would accept popular
 elections in all Vietnam in return for Soviet
 acceptance of all-German elections.  Elec-
 tions may seem a long way in the future In
 the present excruciating Vietnam situation,
 but I feel that we must envisage and plan
 for a turn toward ballots instead of bullets
 unless we are to make a mere propaganda
 pitch out of democracy.  After all we con-
 nived in depriving the Vietnamese of the
 chance to use ballots in 1956, so it's not too
 surprising that they turned to bullets in-
 stead.  We certainly must have proposals for
 going back and taking the ballot way.
 The British were the first to push the par-
 tition idea in 1954, and now they have come
 up with something almost equally poison-
 ous: the garrisoning of Vietnam by Red Chi-
 nese and American troops to maintain or-
 der.  How can it be called a peace move
 to bring United States and Chinese troops
 face to face?  India provided 6,000 troops
 for the prisoner exchange supervision in Ko-
 rea, and neutral troops could also be found
 'for Vietnam-say a combination of Philip-
 pines, Burma, Malaysia, Ethiopia, and Ghana.
 I believe that constructive moves on Viet-
 nam are of the utmost importance.  Let me
 know if there is anything I can do to help.

 WILLIAM B. LLOYD, Jr.,

 DEAR  SIR: I wish to thank you for the
 courageous stand you have been taking in
 opposing American escalation of the war in
 Vietnam.  In doing so you are performing
 a great service for the people of your State

 more men of your caliber this would be a
 safer, more prosperous, and happier world
 to live in. Keep up the good work.

 more people like you in important places
 who would speak out against the folly of

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: My reason for tak-
 ing your time with this letter is the serious
 dilemma of Vietnam and your interest in
 finding a way out.  I want to suggest a pos-
 sibility, based on "War, Revolution-or Co-
 operation on the Mekong," the main article
 heading the Wells "Between the Lines" News-
 letter of March 1, 1965.
 Walter Lippmann, in his March 19 column
 says our present policy will not work and
 will lead to disaster, either by military defeat,
 escalation of the war, or our expulsion from
 the area by a Vietnamese deal with the Viet-
 cong.  Mr. Lippmann says our policy is all
 stick and no carrot.  The missing ingredient
 is a sketch of the settlement our bombing is
 designed to bring about.
 Quoting the March 1 Wells Newsletter:
 The most tragic shortcoming of U.S. policy
 in southeast Asia has been the failure to
 cooperate with and use the great Mekong

 delta development program as a means for
 curbing and defeating communism. * * *
 This is an immense and bold plan for land,
 agriculture, water, and power  *  *  * that
 unites all factions in the four nations of the
 delta, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and South
 Vietnam.  *  *  *   This imaginative project
 provides a framework in which all free na-
 tions could join under the U.N. but with very
 little U.N. expenditures, * * *  It could be
 supported by only a small fraction of the
 cost of the war.
 Instead of bombing the fragile industries
 of North Vietnam we could be offering them
 incalculable benefits for cooperation. * * *
 The United States could use the project as
 a basis for a negotiated peace:, withdrawing
 our military and substituting a new free
 Asia, emergency peace  force--troops  from
 Thailand,  India,  Japan,  the  Philippines-
 while concentrating all strength and energy
 on the development program.     The Commu-
 nists would not dare alienate all Asia by at-
 tacking such a representative peace force,
 nor would they dare to sabotage the Mekong
 project.
 Mr. Wells lists reference articles on the
 Mekong project.  Before we destroy Hanoi
 or bomb Red China, why not explore this
 possibility?  If you do not read the "Wells
 Newsletter" and desire a copy of the March 1
 issue, I could have one sent to you.
 I am a conservative Republican.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:                    May I express my
 gratitude  for your courageous  and  con-
 scientious effort for negotiations in the Viet-
 nam war.                 I wrote to President Johnson in
 support  of  the  pleas  by  the  clergymen's
 emergency committee on Vietnam "In the
 Name of God, Stop It" (New York Times of

 This urgent plea by the thousands of men
 of God deserves the support of every humane
 Senator, and thank God that we still have
 a Senator like you in these critical days.

 calling for U.S. withdrawal from South Viet-
 nam and the placement of the problem be-
 fore the United Nations.
 Sincerely,
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.:
 actions have unmasked us as a naked aggres-
 sor in a land thousands of miles from our
 borders.  Any justification for this must go
 down in history as a rebirth of the Nazi
 Weltanschauung.
 It is impossible for me as an American,
 who has been brought up in the traditions
 of equal rights before the law, self-detemina-
 tion, and fair play, to accept that for the
 first time in our history the rest of the world
 can justifiably label us as an out-and-out
 aggressor in a foreign land.
 I fear that If things continue as they have
 in Vietnam the "war hawks," who seem to be
 controlling the, situation, will resort to nu-
 clear weapons and probably bombs in des-
 peration.   Our action over there must be
 stopped before its too late.

 DEAR  SENATOR       MORSE: While  I  am  not

 never be able to cast a vote for you as Sen-
 ator, still I find that you most frequently
 speak for me on a majority of issues.    For
 this reason I am writing you today to urge
 you to continue your efforts to conclude our
 involvement in Vietnam.
 This situation may already have gone too
 far to avoid general war, but so long as
 there is any hope, do please use all your
 powers of persuasion not only to prevent
 further spread of the fighting, but also to
 end our military participation in the affairs

 blunders.

 DEAR Sin: From time to time, I have been
 reading your anxious views on the conflict
 in Vietnam.  I am interested to know what
 you think of President Johnson's offer (April
 7, Johns Hopkins University) for uncondi-
 tional talks to end the dreadful war in Viet-
 nam.  Mr. Johnson said the United States
 would not leave South Vietnam until the
 country has secure peace free from outside
 interference.  Are we to assume from this
 that the President has not changed the U.S.
 position?  I thought his  ideas for recon-
 struction in southeast Asia excellent.   How-
 ever, if the United States remains ready to
 carry on its military effort in South Viet-
 nam and against the north, in the final out-
 come will there be anything left to recon-
 struct?  Make no mistake, we in this coun-
 try share your grave concern over this costly
 war.
 I would sincerely appreciate hearing your
 views on the latest development.

 your service to the people in giving much
 needed information on the war in Vietnam.
 -It is hoped that your voice will never be
 stilled by the threat of dams or any other
 favors to your State, for if the present policy
 is pursued to its ultimate conclusion there
 will be no need for dams or anything else
 anywhere.
 In all wars of history, religion has played
 its part either in instigating or blessing the
 participants and there are vague hints that
 there are religious issues at stake in Vietnam.
 Otherwise, it doesn't seem that those Bud-
 dhist monks would seek to publicize their
 side of the controversy by such violent means
 as burning themselves to death.  Such be-
 havior suggests that a way of life is being
 forced upon them that is inimical to their
 sense of justice.
 I am wondering if you could give me in-
 formation or suggest reading material con-
 cerning this phase of the war.
 Again thanking you for your almost Single-
 handed fight in the Senate and urging you
 to remember, in lonely moments, that there
 were "7,000 in Israel who had not bowed
 the knee to Baal."  All people of good will
 will be grateful to you for your fearless ad-
 vocacy of a more lenient policy in Vietnam.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have recently read
 an article by Bertrand Russell entitled "Free
 World Barbarism: The War of Atrocity in
 Vietnam" (Minority of One, December 1964)
 which has left me seriously disturbed and
 anxious to discover additional and reliable
 information on the political nature of the
 struggle in South Vietnam.
 Russell and others have described the na-
 tional liberation front as "indigenous" and
 have asserted that the uprising in Vietnam
 against the Diem and subsequent govern-
 ments is a national one.  It seems to me
 critical that one know the truth of thi:
 assertion for the reason that one cannot pass
 judgment on the political validity of the
 U.S. role in the suppression of the Vietcong
 (NLF) without understanding just what and
 who  our  Government has  determined  to
 crush.
 A document that would indicate the origins
 of the front, its leadership and their back-
 grounds, and the nature and source of its
 support is sorely needed.  This kind of in-
 formation is simply not available (as far as
 I have been able to discover) in the Amer-
 ican press.  I cite to you David Halbertram's

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE; A friend has lent Ine
 a copy of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for the
 Senate for April 1, 1965, and.I want to con-
 gratulate and commend you on your cou-
 rageous stand demanding a United Nations
 cease-fire.ordef as,.the beginning of a nego-
 tiated peace in Vietnam.
 However. I. have not been able to finish
 all the excellent statements which you suc-
 ceeded in getting printed in the RECORD for
 April 1, since I had to return the copy, and
 I would like If it is possible to have this
 issue of the RECORD for my flies.
 You probably don't remember me but if
 you think back to the days when you were
 dean of the University of Oregon Law School
 And an arbitrator . for the longshore union
 you may remember a young United Press
 correspondent going to the university in Eu-
 gene and working on the Eugene Register-
 Guard who used to pick up copies of your
 decisions.  I ,was that reporter and it was
 my job to digest the decisions and wire over-
 head to Portland a 100- or 150-word version
 for news, stories that went up and down the
 Pacific coast, and I suppose also to, the east
 coast if the. dockside issue was important
 enough.
 Now >;, have my own news agency in Los
 Angeles, serving weekly neighborhood papers
 with reports on local government.  The pub-
 lishers
 who buy my service are almost uni-
 formly conservative and would not print any
 column of ir4ne stating my views pointblank
 about our aggression in Vietnam,   But I am
 enclosing a column which contains one single
 paragraph which compares the Asian situa-
 tion to -George Orwell's predictions of "1984"
 so you can see how I feel.
 Without voices such asyours and Senator
 GRUENING's the United States would be in
 a sorry State.  The conservatives, control the
 pipelines of news and opinions and those
 of us who feed material into these pipelines
 are often foreclosed from warning our read-
 ers and listeners of the dangers of nuclear
 disaster.  But I at least write the truth as
 I see it and if I. can't take,,a stand against
 would never write a word apologizing for
 what I think is ingrally wrong and stupid In
 the bargain.
 S wlsh,youu well  I've followed your career

 called the big lie.
 President Johnson Is branding the world
 with his deadly L.B.J. In the name of "peace,

 benevolent proclamation and proceeds to his
 dastardly deeds of bombing.
 I have marched, I have written, and will
 continue although it sometimes seems futile.
 We cannot give up-yet, I wish I could be
 more effective-have you any suggestions?
 15,000  march  on  the  White  house  and
 President Johnson refuses to stop bombing
 as he speaks of peace.
 Please, please continue your heroic and
 sensible efforts-shout the truth as loud as
 you can, for as long as you can-I, we, see
 it is our only hope in a world rapidly heading
 toward its own destruction.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:. AS Johnson's War in
 Vietnam is escalated toward a global con-
 flict, we are ever more grateful that you and
 Senator  GRUENING  continue to speak otit
 against this shameful action by Our beloved
 country.
 More and-more Americans join you in ef-
 forts to achieve a cease-fire and negotiations.
 Yesterday 200 of us marched in a peace wit-
 ness in Bellingham instituted by the Ameri-

 We work for peace here and know you
 will continue to do the same in the Senate.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:             Keep up the fight
 against our murderous activity in Vietnam.
 We are proud of you for your courage. Hope
 you can get through to the President and

 We are with you.  Wish there were direct
 aid to give.  Is there?

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: As a graduate of the
 University of Oregon, I feel that I am an
 Oregonian.  I have long supported  your
 courageous stand on South Vietnam, that
 the problem should have long since been
 submitted  to the United  Nations. Such
 action would not only have demonstrated
 our genuine willingness to preserve world
 peace, but would have branded the Com-
 munists as aggressors in the eyes of the
 world.  Our continued support of a corrupt
 regime which lacks the moral and material
 support of its citizens seems destined to
 failure. At best all we can hope to create
 is an artificial situation which will collapse
 soon after our troops are withdrawn.
 McGeorge Bundy, on a press interview
 Sunday, April 4,  1965,  appeared to  evade
 directly answering questions posed to him
 on American opposition to our policy in
 South Vietnam.    Bundy's remarks on tele-
 vision seem to lend support to former State
 Department adviser Owen Lattimer's charge
 that the State Department "hushes everybody
 up by saying, 'we know all the facts."'
 I feel that such State Department high-
 handedness is doing Irreparable harm to our
 democratic institutions.  It seems that our
 State Department officials are presuming to
 act for the American people without con-
 sulting the very people whom they profess
 to represent.  Perhaps the present admin-
 istration should be reminded that the Con-
 stitution was created by and for the Ameri-
 can people.
 Yours truly,
 APRIL 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Without fail-every-
 time we hear on the radio-what you have

 DEAR  SENATOR MORSE:  As I recall it, the
 Constitution says Congress has the right to
 declare war. Of course, it did not define war
 exactly; but it seems to me that bombing an-
 other country every day regularly might well
 be considered a state of war.
 It seems to me there might be considerable
 mileage in some Senators or Representatives
 attempting to assert the ancient rights of
 Congress at the present time?

 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 Senator from Oregon,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  SENATOR MORSE:  It was  mentioned
 over the air Saturday Morning, April 3, that
 you had a discussion or debate with Wiscon-
 sin Senator PROXMIRE in San Francisco or Los
 Angeles, on our private undeclared war on
 the Vietnam people who are fighting for
 freedom from their oppressors, the rulers we
 in the United States are forcing on them in
 the name of preserving democracy for the
 freedom-loving people in South Vietnam,
 and that our democratic and :freedom-loving
 warmongers in Washington will fight for that
 freedom even if they have to kill every non-
 combatant man,  woman,  and  child living
 in North or South Vietnam by incendiary
 bombs, napalm bombs, gas bombs, and ordi-
 nary dynamite bombs dropped by the tons
 by our men serving as consultants or advis-
 ers to the Vietnam armed forces we are cre-
 ating, training, supporting, and paying for
 With our sons' lives and with our own tax-
 payers' money in the billions.
 It's our men, planes, and ships that are
 doing most of the killing and committing
 wanton murder like Hitler did to the Jews
 and,to all others who opposed his Ideas of
 solving the race problem.
 I believe that we are committing, a greater
 crime against humanity than Hitler because
 it was the United States that plunged into
 World War I and II, which wars took over 75
 million lives and property destroyed worth
 hundreds of billions of dollars to make the
 world safe from future wars and hatred and
 to penult self-determination of governments
 by the people and for the people-not gov-
 ernments forced on them by outside powers.
 Colonization and slavery was supposed to be
 out.
 What are we doing in  southeast Asia?
 What kind of an example for freedom and
 peace are our ruling clique In Washington
 displaying for the newly created govern-
 ments?
 How can our President, and my friend,
 Lyndon B. Johnson, who is lighting so hard
 ,for rights and improvements to our people
 in our United States criticize and condemn
 the crimes and shameful acts committed by
 our own extreme right group, yet permit the
 shameful crimes we are committing in Africa
 with the Tshombes and in southeast Asia
 with the gangster rulers whom we have put
 in a position to rule their people by oppres-
 sion  and mass murder.  These  rulers  are
 sitting on top of a government supported by
 our bayonets, money and military might-
 not by the wishes of the great majority of
 their citizens.
 Dear Mr. Senator, what can we do here in
 the United States to arouse the conscience
 of enough Senators and Congressmen to stop
 this shameful undeclared wanton murder of
 innocent people who are paying the supreme
 penalty for something they don't know what
 it's all about.
 Does our war clique In Washington really
 want to bring this undeclared private war to
 an  atomic  war  climax?  What  then?
 I am certain that there are enough de-
 cent and liberal thinking Senators and Con-
 gressmen in the Senate and House, and
 many millions of  citizens  in  the United
 States who are willing to support them mor-
 ally, and financially if necessary, to stop this
 shameful undeclared private war which is
 being pursued under the guise of saving
 democracy for the freedom-loving people.
 Why the hypocrisy?  Why not have the
 United Nations take over the responsibility
 of handling this situation as proposed by
 U.N. Secretary U Thant?
 Smart people are those that admit their
 mistakes and try to make amends without
 face saving and schemes.
 Please mail me a copy of your recent debate
 with Wisconsin Senator PROxMIRE  (in San
 Francisco or Los Angeles)  who was elected
 on a liberal platform of the LaFollettes but is
 now singing a different song.
 Very truly yours,
 SAMUEL KIPNxs.

 DEAR MR. MORSE: I am so disgusted with
 the stand our Florida Senators take on the
 war in Vietnam, that I am writing to you.
 The U.S. image is being blackened by bomb-
 ings, strafings, and burnings of peasants and
 homes in Vietnam.  This is in direct opposi-
 tion to our policy at home-where we op-
 pose such acts on a lesser scale by the KKK,
 White Citizens Council, etc.  If we oppose
 terror at home, why should we not oppose it
 in Vietnam?
 From what I can understand the people
 of Vietnam want to be left alone-and only
 a few Vietnamese plus military personnel
 want the war to continue.
 My plea to you-please do all you can to
 stop this war.

 Vietnam are uncalled for.  I have protested
 to the President and to some of the Senators
 about U.S. action there.   I consider it an
 invasion of North Vietnam.
 I may not have agreed with you on any
 other controversial question, but I am glad
 you have spoken out against our war there.
 When "our" approved rulers had charge there,
 there were murders, I believe, until they were
 slain.

 SENATOR: t am deeply concerned over the
 Vietnam situation and alrl Wilting you in
 the hope of a brief explanation for our
 presence there.  You happen to be my fa-
 vorite Senator and that is nay, reason for
 directing this letter to you..
 There appears to be much confusion and
 diversity of opinions, reports and explana-
 tigns for our, involvement in Vietnam.  My
 quettions are as follows: Did, the United
 States enter into the 1954 Geneva. Agreement
 as a formal party?  It is frequently reiterated
 that a breach of the Agreement is the sole
 reason for our intervention in, Vietnam, Are
 the North Vietnamese directly and solely
 responsible for the civil and political dis-
 turbance in South Vietnam? I have not read
 or heard of any North Vietnamese troops or
 aircraft being employed in the south.
 Finally, if our presence and objective in
 Vietnam is as vital as generally alleged, I am
 extremely curious to know why our allies are
 not rendering us any assistance.  Would not
 the outcome in Vietnam affect their as dras-
 tically as the United States?
 Is it true that the European nations are
 trading and selling goods to the North Viet-
 namese while we, are engaged in military
 conflict with them?  If true, this situation
 appears' ridiculous.
 Needless to..state I am quite confused
 with. ,respect to Vietnam and would inded
 welcome even the slightest clarification.
 Sincerely yours,
 I Mr. WALTER DUDA,
 NEW YORK, N.Y.,
 DEAR .SEIATOR, MORSE: I'm much heartened
 always by your readiness and willingness to
 "speak truth to pomposity."
 As'for Mr.. J9hnson's speech last night-
 which did not answer world .criticism of
 `CTnited States havoc ip Vietnan},. North ,and
 pout - j iltl point it's as though he's try-
 ing to let the world to chip in on what, is
 all     clearly our reparations bill there for
 10 years of dislocation, devastation, death,
 and destruction,  Is there any unscorched
 earth  left?  Are  any  villages  left?  Did
 Operation Sunrise ever realty end?
 Above all, though, Mr. MORSE, is our con-
 tinued, pledge to force North Vietnam into
 the war.  How the .,Pentagon must be vexing
 at .the, North's xefll,sal to -rise to our bait.
 And we continue to bomb and, burn. with

 A Japanese report earlier this week, liken-

 resistance movement of World War II. seems
 to best state the situation.  This Washing-

 DEAR SIR: Although I am not a member of

 '7$71
 support for your efforts to uphold the validity
 of international agreements in the face of
 such transgressions as the advisory action of
 the United States in Vietnam.  I feel that
 negotiations   must   be   undertaken im-
 mediately or we risk nuclear destruction. It
 has been a sad, time in world history. We
 speak Of democratic government and do such
 things as attempt to assure the civil rights
 of minority Americans and we conjure up a
 consensus foreign policy which acts against
 the interests of democracy and civil rights in
 Vietnam.    Despite  the  legal  arguments
 against United States actions in Vietnam,
 there has long been substantial evidence that
 the Saigon governments which we have sup-
 ported work against the people of Vietnam.
 There is also the obvious and apparent cen-
 sorship of the, American press representatives
 in Vietnam,  I feel that this acts to deceive
 the American people and further injure the
 interests of the Vietnamese people.  Again,
 I must congratulate you on the position
 which you have defended in the face of
 gross unreason in the Congress of the United
 States of America,

 so because Barry Goldwater said he would in-

 you can say you did not say, as President
 Eisenhower did about Korea, what you would
 do but you know you gave the impression
 you could be trusted to decrease rather than
 increase military activity there.
 You talk about "democracy and freedom,"
 What does democracy mean for the ordinary
 person?  Mail against the present policy in
 Vietnam is running up to 500 to 1 against
 what is being done now.  Senator JAvrrs'

 home think  our  foreign policy is .wrong.
 Many are terribly confused and afraid.  They
 want to live and fear you are rushing us to-
 ward the complete destruction of the world.
 Please bring military men home instead of
 sending more and lose all the face necessary
 to stop the war.  Stop unilateral action and
 ask the United Nations to take over the job
 in Vietnam.
 I am thankful for every speech you make.

 DEAR MR. BuNDY:                  Your appearance on
 "Meet the Press" telecast last Sunday in-
 spired me to write this letter.  You rather
 indicated that your mail regarding Vietnam
 was not being counted, and I do not expect
 this letter to be counted, either. I do not
 know when I have heard such a weasel
 worded conversation as you put on.  My wife
 said, "Well, at least he didn't tell any out-
 right lies."  That may be so, but neither do
 I recall you telling any outright truths.  The
 nearest to an outright lie was your conten-
 tion that we are not aggressors In Vietnam.
 I doubt that the majority of the people of
 the world would agree with you, and perhaps
 not even a majority in this country.
 I say that you have a lot of blood on your
 hands, and I should  imagine  psychiatrists
 are wondering how you can sleep.      There
 will undoubtedly be a lot more blood on your
 hands, unless and until, the President gets
 rid of advisers such as you.
 Very truly yours,
 M. C. BELKNAP.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I want to let you
 know that I support you and you are speak-
 ing for me when you urge that we negotiate
 over the Vietnamese situation.
 The area should be neutralized and we,. as
 a nation, should get out.  Morally, we are
 all wrong, and politically, we are cutting our
 own throat before the world.
 Keep up the good work.
 Sincerely,                     -
 Los ANGELES, CALIF.,
 April 6, 1965.
 President L. B. JOHNSON,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Recent events,
 taken in conjunction with the evidence sum-
 marized below, have forced me to come to the
 reluctant conclusion that you are taking the
 United States down a path which bears a
 terrifying similarity to that taken by pre-
 war Germany.
 The evidence forcing me to this conclusion
 follows,
 1. The U.S. Government claims that the
 present war is an instance of Communist
 aggression is authoritatively refuted by the
 noted historian Devillers in the China Quar-
 terly for January-March 1962.
 2. The U.S. Government states that ac-
 tions of the Vietcong are only made possible
 by the infiltration of personnel and equip-
 ment from North Vietnam and that the Com-
 munists in North Vietnam are attempting to
 conquer South Vietnam.
 Data  obtained from the recent White
 Paper, and from the Pentagon, indicate that
 Communist-made  weapons  constitute  less
 than 21/2 percent of the weapons used by the
 Vietcong.
 The White Paper names only six native-
 born North Vietnamese who have infiltrated
 into South Vietnam In the 5-year period
 prior to and including 1964.
 Therefore, the Government's own figures
 contradict its claims of significant infiltra-
 tion from the north.
 The above items indicate that the U.S.
 Government has deceived the American pub-
 lic.  This is corroborated by the New York
 Times editorial of July 29, 1964, which states
 that "unpalatable facts were suppressed and
 the truth subverted" and also by an Amer-
 ican in Saigon who is quoted in Newsweek
 of February 10, 1964, as saying, "Washing-
 ton repeatedly lied to the American people
 during the last 3 years."
 3. The use of torture, poison chemicals,
 and gas, the leveling by bombing of villages
 suspected of containing a few Vietcong, the
 willingness to inflict a horrible  death by
 burning through our extensive use of napalm,
 and the bombing of North Vietnam on the
 false pretext that significant quantities of
 arms and men have been infiltrated, are con-
 trary to morality and international law and
 have caused death and misery to countless
 innocent people.  Many American boys have
 been killed and maimed in carrying out the
 Government's policy.
 4. Foreign  policy has  apparently  been
 taken over by the military.    Except for a
 few  courageous   Senators       such  as MORSE,
 GRUENING, McGovERN, and CuuacH, Congress
 has abdicated  its  responsibility and goes
 along with  the actions by which we are
 being led deeper into an immoral war which
 will kill and maim millions, if not hundreds
 of millions, of human beings.
 When a government deceives its people
 and uses methods which have shocked the
 world to gain its ends, it does not deserve the
 respect of its citizens.
 If the American people do not demand
 that their Government tell them the truth
 about our actions in southeast Asia, we are
 going to reap the nuclear holocaust which
 you seem determined to bring about.
 The crimes tried at Nuremberg were a
 Sunday school picnic compared to those of
 which these responsible for world war III will
 be guilty.
 Yours truly,
 Care of Senator  WAYNE  MORSE,  Senator
 ERNEST GRUENING.
 ST. Louis, Mo.,

 DEAR   MR. MORSE: Big Brother Johnson's
 administration is soon going to have
 us in an atomic war, as you recently predict-
 ed on TV, the way things are going.  I have
 come to the conclusion that we will be lucky
 If we have an economic collapse that will
 put us out of the war business before we get
 into an atomic war that will end it in an
 even more unpleasant manner, and perhaps
 the rest of the world as well.
 The only people who are  satisfied with
 this war are the industrialists and military
 who have been making huge profits from
 the cold war, and never want it to end, ex-
 cept by escalation into a hot, or at least
 lukewarm war, through which they can make
 even more in graft and profits.
 These are the people Big Brother is taking
 care of, and no doubt it was they who backed
 his campaign financially as well as Gold-
 water's. Big Brother ought to be impeached
 for the administration's whitewash of Bobby
 Baker because it is obvious why.

 DEAR. SENATOR MORSE: Keep fighting!  rWe
 don't belong in Vietnam In the first place

 can  make   the  Indochinese  accept the

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I Want you to know
 that I appreciate your long-time criticism
 of our policies In Vietnam. Your article In
 "Progressive" plus your CONGRESSIONAL REC-
 ORD statements of protest and explanation
 following the Gulf of Tonkin business have
 been substance for my own debating. .
 My reasons for supporting negotiation and
 withdrawal of military machinery are, I be-
 lieve, substantially the same as yours;  we
 never belonged there in the first place, and
 we've bungled it while we've been there.
 I was really disappointed by the recent
 "White Paper" which attempted to cover up
 the whole fiasco.  We are really getting des-
 perate.  I just hope we can get smart and
 get out before bombing Chinese targets be-
 comes as accepted as bombing North Viet-
 nam and Laos has become.

 of us out here who think you're on the ball.

 U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. SENATOR: The last line of the en-
 closed letter is rhetorical; however, it seems
 you and Mr. GRUENINO stand almost alone
 in the Senate.
 Two aspects of this matter seem to me to
 demand much more than a routine protest--
 one,  the  wrecking of the United Nations
 spoken of in the attached letter, and two,
 the fact that the power of making war now
 resides de facto in the hands of the Presi-
 dent alone.  This is a monstrously revolu-
 tionary condition for our country.  One-man
 war, undesirable any time to our way of
 thinking, wolud seem in this epoch to be
 simply fantastic.
 I suspect the popular protest against our
 policy in Vietnam Is enormous, as reflected
 in congressional mail.  And yet the press as
 well as the Congress seem determined to sup-
 port this policy, apparently feeling that as
 soon as we can get enough Americans killed

 public sentiment will change.  A frequent

 ent in this outrageous course.                        As a mem-

 Hon. J. W, FULBRIGHT,
 Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,
 U,S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. SENATOR: Ypu state that you be-
 lieve it would be unwise to commence nego-
 tiations in Vietnam when the prospects for
 success are unfavorable-this seems to say
 that if we are losing we will throw away the
 rulebook.  But the oily real test of a set
 of rules is to lose under them.  Are we to
 cripple or even demolish the United Nations
 to keep from losing in Vietnam?
 if our present policy of stepping outside
 a rule of law and pulling a gun succeeds and
 gains us a more favorable position, surely
 such a fine policy will then be used again
 and again in the future?  And surely other
 nations will follow our winning example?  If
 our present policy fails, we shall find our-
 selves involved in an inexorably widening
 war,  in either case, the United Nations will
 have been most neatly dismantled.
 This seems a high price to pay.  Is what
 we are, "losing" in Vietnam of equal value?
 Is it possible that the President's advisers
 are laboring under "a profoundly and dan-
 gerous" false notion," in the words of Walter
 Lippmann, as to what constitutes winning
 and losing in Asia?
 The unlovely arrogance of our Pentagon
 diplomacy in operation in Vietnam is abhor-
 rent ,to the  whole world.  Every village
 burne4 creates thous-'nds of new friends for
 world communism and thousands of newly
 dedicated anti-Americans.  The serene cyni-
 cism with which we pour out massive de-
 struction in "retaliation" for any Americans
 killed by underground terrorists makes this
 enormous nightmare an enormous Operation
 Lidice.  The violent brutality toward those
 "who threaten the stability" of South Viet-
 nam  (i.e., those  who  object to American
 policy) ; the "hunting trip" raids of U.S. air-
 planes                             looking  for "random , opportunity
 targets"; the "experimenting" with splendid
 new antipersonnel weapons  that  cause
 "extremely painful burns extremely difficult
 to heal"; bombing of a countryside by the
 map grid numbers-all these recall Mr. Hit-
 ler in his finest hour.
 Is the United States to conclude its record
 of reasonably civilized leadership of the last
 20 years by becoming a Fourth Reich?  Are
 you yourself willing to cap your heretofore
 .distinguished  record in foreign affairs by
 quietly acquiescing?
 There are many Americans who are ap-
 palled at being cast in the role of the Nazis
 this time around, and are doing their utmost
 to make vocal and effective their dissent,
 Are there no such Americans in Congress?

 reverse our course in Vietnam-,,at}d.work for
 an immediate cease-fire and self-determina-

 While expediency may seem to dictate a

 station, in company with friends I had in-
 vited to my home to hear you) .
 The time is drawing near, very near to a
 third world war, really, a world war. In
 my 85 years of life I have observed and heard
 much.  The First World War, World War II,
 the Korean war, and yet I continually ask
 myself- and  (others if they are willing to
 listen to me)    why this brutal murder of
 innocent people? Why this wanton destruc-
 tion?         I continually talk about the Korean
 war, and tell the people how the American
 officers were supervising Korean soldiers with
 their hands tied in their backs and others
 digging their own graves, it told that when
 they will. finish digging their graves they will'
 have their hands tied also and they will all
 jump into their graves, alive. And what was
 our gain from the Korean war: 196,000 Amer-
 icans dead, the flower of our youth; a cor-
 rupt Government and millions of dollars lost,
 and millions still give the gangster govern.
 ment in South Korea, and what a fiasco.
 What is the reason to repeat this tragedy?
 DO you know what the name for Americans
 is? "The American Killers."  This was told
 to me by two people of integrity, .one a writer,
 woman, the other a publisher.  They both
 speak -several foreign languages, and their
 pleading that they were not American by
 birth could not convince the people that
 they are not as evil as those Americans who
 make wars, directly and indirectly (that was
 6 years ago).  What a pity.  Oh, for those
 years when Americans were known the world
 over as liberty loving, democracy loving, gen-
 erous, friendly people.  No more.  I have
 experienced only disdain (because I did not
 speak Spanish) when I was in Mexico in 1954
 and again in 1969 (the second time not so
 much hatred) it was right after the American
 Ambassador who boastfully acknowledged In
 speech and print, in the Times, that he came
 into the President of Guatemala with two
 pistols and so forced him to flee the country.
 The Mexicans, and not only the literate; even
 the illiterate, the street vendors, wanted to
 know why the Americans destroy the Latin
 American peoples,  Oh, I could go on, but I
 know that .you hardly have time to read my
 letter.  I could say so much more to re-
 lieve-my anger and anguish, but I shall close
 with my gratitude to God, that there are men
 like you even if few in number-very few
 indeed.

 HoN. SENATOR MORSE: Want to voice my
 appreciation for your opposition to the war
 in Vietnam.
 This war is not only too inhumane but also
 too dangerous to continue.
 Why not turn this over to the U.N.?  This
 war must be brought to a close and it seems
 to me it would greatly strengthen the U.N.
 to allow them to mediate a peace.
 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: It seems obvious to
 almost everybody except Gen. Maxwell Taylor
 and the administration that the policy in
 Vietnam has gone very sour indeed.  Instead
 of breaking the resistance of the North Viet-
 namese, we are strengthening it, and even
 driving them into the dubious embraces of
 Communist China.  How stupid can we get?
 Our whole policy appears to be calculated
 to  strengthening the  Communist  world,
 pushing Mgscow and Peiping closer together,
 turning all of Asia and Africa against "white
 lmperialism"-the best weapons in the Red
 propaganda arsenal, in addition to actual
 military materiel, have been made in the
 United States of America.  When will we
 learn?
 Worse than that, the actions of the admin-
 istration have sown dismay and distrust in
 this country at a critical time  when we
 should be united.   The people have been
 lied to and betrayed.  After repudiating esca-
 lation of the conflict at the polls, we find that
 our expressed hopes have been cynically
 tossed  out.    Goldwaterism  without  Gold-
 water.                                                                          The press releases from the White
 House, the white papers of the State Depart-
 ment are such obvious lies that it is im-
 possible to take them seriously, if it were not
 for the fact that they have such serious
 results.                        "
 Now is government by the people possible
 when the people are misled, bamboozled, and
 denied access to information vitally affecting
 their safety and welfare?  "Big Daddy knows
 best" is hardly in the American tradition.
 We are not at war with North Vietnam.
 Why, then, are we committing acts of ag-
 gression on a par with Pearl Harbor?  If we
 are at war, the Congress should exercise its
 constitutional duty of making a legal decla-
 ration, and not leave it to the Executive to
 wage war unconstitutionally.  This tendency
 to bypass the Constitution, to me, is a far
 graver threat to our Republic than the feeble
 efforts of No Chi Minh,  The Congress should
 reassert its duties as reprehentative of the
 people, and not slip into-an emasculated role
 of - a rubberstamp, like the Roman senate
 under Augustus,
 All the way with the --American people.
 The President should execute the will of the
 people, not impose his own.

 DEAR  PRESIDENT                                                        JOHNSON:   Our  recent
 bombings  of  the                                                      defenseless inhabitants
 of Vietnam, north and south, are costing us
 all of our influence and prestige in Asia, not
 to mention American reaction at home and
 elsewhere.
 You have stated that our purpose is to
 end Communist aggression and terror in
 South Vietnam.  How true is this?  Judging
 from reports most Vietnamese, except for
 Saigons4eem to prefer the Vietcongs.
 From almost every viewpoint our position
 seems to be coming more and more unten-
 able.  Let's have a cease fire before the situa-
 tion  deteriorates  still  further.  Then  we
 can plan to rebuild and if possible regain
 some self-respect.

 Mr. and Mrs. PAUL KERBER.

 If it weren't for you and men like you I

 for a halt to the awful horrors which the
 United States is perpetrating are answered.

 You may be sure that when you advocate
 immediate negotiation to end this unjust

 SENATOR WAYNE MORSE:
 Would you read the enclosed and if you
 approve of its general content, have it in-
 serted in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD?
 I believe the majority of the American peo-
 ple are strongly against this increased in-
 volvement in Vietnam.  Parents of sons who
 are now in_Vietnam are especially bitter.
 If this war continues another month, we
 will have "escalation" of friction in Ger-
 many, the Middle East, Africa, all over the
 I met Representative JOHN CONYERS yes-
 terday (he's in Savannah for a voter registra-
 tion drive for the NAACP), and he spoke out
 strongly against our involvement in Viet-
 nam; he said many Congressmen are strongly
 against it.
 Thanking you for your continued fight
 for world peace and sane government, I
 Sincerely,
 ARBAM EISENMAN.
 P.S.-Sent you my book; you never have
 told me whether you read it, liked it, or dis-
 liked it.
 How To  GET OUT OF VIETNAM
 Five thousand years ago, Confucius said:
 "Easy to save face in Asia-just keep body
 in native land,"
 Today, I say: "Easy to get out of Viet-
 nam-let's become part of the world."
 We have no more right in Vietnam than the
 Chinese would have had intervening during
 our Civil War,
 But, there we are in Vietnam, and seem-
 ingly hellbent on starting world war III,
 if  necessary,  so that we  can save  South
 Vietnam for Democracy.
 But, are we not there to stop communism?
 If we don't stop them in Vietnam, what
 country is next?
 Well, there's communism in Cuba, 90 miles
 from our shores, but we don't bomb them.
 There, are Communists in Italy, but we don't
 bomb them to save them from communism.
 There  are  Communists  in  France,  India,
 England, we don't bomb them.  There are
 allegedly   Communists  in   the     United
 States-should we bomb ourselves to keep
 ourselves safe from communism?
 This is the  age  of geographical schizo-
 phrenia: There's a North and South' Korea,
 and a North and South Vietnam; there's an
 East Germany and a West Germany, a West
 Pakistan  and an East Pakistan-and the
 only reason we haven't got an East Pole and
 a West Pole is because we've got a North
 Pole and a $oilth Pole.
 France moved out of Indochina and Al-
 geria, reluctantly, after years of war, and
 ;ountiess  millions  of.' dollars  of  wasted
 Honey, and many scores of thousands of
 utile deaths, and now France' enjoys un-
 arecedented prosperity.  Now, we arespend-
 ing $2 million a day in Vietnam.  The cost
 is bound to go up in dollars and lives.
 Ask yourself this awful question: If the
 Vietnamese Were 'not brown-skinned people
 without voting power in the United States,
 would we bomb them?
 Are we not racists on the world scene?
 Governor Wallace sent his State troopers to
 whip, cattle-prod, and beat Negroes and their
 white friends, trying to march for freedom.
 On the world scene, how distinguish between
 Governor Wallace's actions and ours? Is not
 ours  even  worse  because  we  use  napalm
 bombs, gas, and we kill and *kill to save face
 to.try and bring about a negotiated peace.
 Presumably, the frightened Vietcong will
 get down on their hands and knees and say:
 Big tall white men, lords and masters of de-
 mocracy, stop your bombing and we'll agree
 ,to your peace terms.
 Governor Wallace attempted to horsewhip
 freedom into the ground.  We are attempting
 to bomb  out  Communist leadership from
 Vietnam. And the more we bomb them, the
 more Communist we make them.  The more
 we bomb brown people in Asia the more we
 are hated in all of Asia, not only by the
 Vietnamese, and the Chinese, but also by the
 Japanese, the Burmese, the Indonesians, the
 Hindus, and the Moslems.  The wild men of
 Borneo could truthfully ask: What do the
 white savages want?
 What do we want in Vietnam?  John Foster
 Dulles put us in Vietnam with a few hundred
 advisers.   Look how close we now walk to
 the brink of world war III because -John
 Foster Dulles put 300 military advisers into
 Vietnam to save it from communism.
 But, you ask, if we pull out of Vietnam,
 what about the rest of Asia?  What about
 South Korea?  What about Formosa or Tai-
 wan?  What about the rest of Asia?
 We do have some historical interests in the
 Philippines.  Curiously, since Spain settled
 so,.. much, ' of Latin  America  and  also  the
 Philippines, they have the same basic eco-
 nomic problems though separated by thou-
 sands of miles.
 But, we did eventually grant the Philip-
 pines their independence, and some of their
 30 million people understand and apprecia-
 ate the United  States and its democratic
 potential.
 What about the rest of Asia?  How about
 inviting the Philippines in as our 51st State?
 How  about offering all-out aid to Japan,
 India, Pakistan, Australia, and New Zealand?
 How about offering all-out aid to North
 and South Vietnam,, North and South Ko-
 rea, Formosa, and Red China, too?
 Is it possible that we are about to blow
 the world to bits because our President has
 watched too many westerns on TV and con-
 siders himself the good man, and anybody
 who opposes him the bad man or men, and
 feels entitled to shoot them down if they
 disagree with him?  Especially ' if they are
 short, dark, brown men, Buddhists, who will
 travel 7,000 miles across the Pacific to get
 us if we don't get them first?
 But how does a great power like the United
 States extricate itself from Vietnam?  Well,
 the French just picked up and left.    The
 British picked up and left Ireland, Israel, the
 Middle East, and India.  Russia picked up
 and left the Congo.  The only way to leave
 a country where you don't belong in the first
 place is just to pick up and leave.  It's a
 very easy thing to do, much easier than.
 fighting the Asian people in a prolonged war
 involving billions of dollars and perhaps mil-
 lions of casualties,
 But you say, "we can stop the Red Chinese
 now; 5 years, 10 years from now may be too
 late."
 History repeats the follies of warriors'who
 fought out of fear.  Hitler speculated on
 a cheap and easy 'victory, too,' but the Brit-
 ish stuck it out, the Russians stuck it out,
 and in a few years, Hitler was defeated.
 7875
 Chinese will stick it out?  Isn't it possible
 that if we use atomic bombs in Asia, the
 brown and black men around the world will
 rise in revolt against us?  Isn't it just pos-
 sible that we could lose the world trying
 to save South Vietnam?
 But what happens to Chiang Kai-shek and
 his hundreds of thousands of troops?  What
 happens to the many millions of anti-Com-
 munist forces in Asia if we pull out of Viet-
 nam and subsequently from Korea and don't
 defend Taiwan?
 Look homeward, o angels of mercy.     How
 about our unemployed in the United States?
 How about Latin America which could go
 Communist?
 But, how about Chiang Kai-shek and the
 anti-Communist forces in Asia?
 Must we play the part of the eternal coun-
 terfevolutionaries, holding back the thrust
 of history, whether it be progressive or reac-
 tionary, leaving Asia as a dangling participle
 in an infinitely unfinishable sentence?
 I don't believe the Communists have as
 their primary desire the killing off of every-
 body                                                                                                                                       in Asia  who's  against  them.  What
 would be the advantage of ruling over dead
 men, women and children? We could offer
 Chiang Kai-shek and some of the leaders of
 the anti-Communist forces sanctuary in our
 country even though there would be a dan-
 ger inherent in this act.
 I have no illusions about Ho Chi Minh and
 his government.  Ho Chi Minh has been a
 Long-time members of the Comintern-but,
 the joker is now whether he wants Chinese
 aid, which can gobble him up too in the
 process.  He probably will not ask for Chi-
 nese aid unless we force him to.
 We must wonder where all this will end.
 For, if we have the right to bomb North
 Vietnam, why does not Castro have the right
 to bomb a country he considers unfriendly?
 Why don't the Communists have the same
 right to bomb non-Communist countries?
 Where will all this end except in world war
 three?
 Unfortunately,  the  classic definition  of
 capitalist-imperialism as defined by Marx fits
 us in this Vietnam venture:
 1. We have military weapons; we have a
 powerful military force that must be used to
 keep the wheels of industry going so that we
 can have wealth.  .
 2. We attack a weak formerly subjected
 country.
 3. We prevent a nation from self-determi-
 nation.
 You could put it another way: Bombs and
 profits as McNamara beats the band.
 That is the heart of this issue: So long as
 such a preponderance of our production is
 geared for military might and spending, we
 are going to be engulfed in destructive wars
 not only to destroy people (and prevent the
 spread of communism) but to keep our mili-
 tary industrial machine humming at profit-
 able speed.
 If we do not convert 50 percent of our
 military spending at once to the construc-
 tion of homes, hospitals, schools, roads, and
 conservation of our natural resources, we will
 have  continued  unemployment,   growing
 crime, insanity, juvenile delinquency, and we
 will not have enough homes, schools, hos-
 pitals, roads and conservation of our natural
 resources.
 We could win the friendship of the entire
 world with our wealth and our hand extended
 in friendship and peace.  Instead we fritter
 away our wealth and the good will of the
 world with napalm bombs and incendiary
 bombs on the jungles of Vietnam to flush
 out a few hundred or a few thousand Viet-
 cong.
 In Alabama, It was racism that impelled
 Governor Wallace to send his armed forces
 against the Negro people and their white
 allies, who wanted to march peacefully for

 the right to vote.  How explain to the brown
 and black people of the world that it is not
 racism that impels our Government to use its
 military force against the brown people of
 Vietnam who want the right of self-determi-
 nation of government?  If the Vietnam peo-
 ple choose a Communist form of government
 how does that endanger our national se-
 curity?
 There are more Communists in Italy than
 in Vietnam but we don't bomb Italy.  There
 are more Communists in France than in Viet-
 nam but we don't bomb France.  There are
 more Communists in Cuba than in Vietnam
 but we don't bomb Cuba.  There are more
 Communists in India than in Vietnam but
 we don't bomb India.  There are more Com-
 munists in Red China than in Vietnam but
 we don't bomb Red China. There are more
 Communists in the Soviet Union than in
 Vietnam but we don't bomb the Soviet Union.
 Then why does our national security demand
 that we bomb Vietnam?
 It is evident that Vietnam, like Korea, is
 the wrong war in the wrong place. at the
 wrong time.  But the dangers :now are even
 greater than during the Korean war.  For
 that war came when Red China did not have
 the atomic bomb, when the Soviet Union and
 the United States had not begun to conquer
 outer space. Today, if total war comes, it
 can come from nuclear bombs rained down
 from up above with space ships zeroing in on
 their targets.
 So this terrible question arises:
 If there were no Vietnam, would we in the
 United States have to create one somewhere
 to use up our military weapons, to give pur-
 pose to our military, to keep the wheels of
 much industry going, to keep us affluent?
 But France found out that it became richer
 once it pulled out of Indochina, and Algeria,
 once it stopped spending useless lives and
 dollars fighting hopeless wars on foreign soil.
 So now we come to the bitter fact that we
 have these choices in Vietnam:
 1. The present  use  of American armed
 might in the avowed hope of obtaining a
 peaceful negotiation;
 2. The planned withdrawal of American
 military might from Vietnam.
 It is strange that we have to fight against
 our President on foreign policy since we are
 so much in agreement with him. on domestic
 issues.  It is strange that war, which kept
 the New Deal from moving further along with
 its domestic revolution, which also inter-
 rupted the progressive march of the Fair
 Deal,   now  challenges the Great Society,
 which has only begun to fight its war against
 poverty, crime, racial intolerance, unemploy-
 ment, slums.
 Some will counsel us to go along with our
 President in this strange adventure in Viet-
 nam because he has all the facts, and has
 arrived at his position through knowledge.
 Some will continue to advocate this war
 action in Vietnam, which is bound to create
 the conditions for world war three on the
 holy grounds that it will prevent world war
 three.
 But, many of us can not go along with our
 President on this brinksmanship diplomacy,
 not out of fear alone of world war three but
 because we are convinced that we, the United
 States, do not have any right at all to be In
 any part of Vietnam.
 But how do we withdraw from Vietnam?
 What about South Korea?  What about Tai-
 wan?  What about the rest of Asia and the
 world? We cannot rewrite the history of
 the world.  We cannot color the maps of the
 world's geography to our liking.  China has
 been, China Is, China will be.  China can no
 more conquer the world than the Russians
 can, than we can, for it is now evident after
 World War II that Eastern Europe, the Com-
 munist dominated, has certain desires of its
 own, too.  And the era of Stalinism  and
 Hitlerisin is dead.
 But I do not advocate withdrawing from
 Vietnam without offering a world plan of
 action.  I repeat: We must invite the Philip-
 pines to become the 51st State of the United
 States; we must offer all-out aid to Japan,
 India, Pakistan, Australia, and New Zealand;
 We must recognize Red China, and offer all-
 out aid to both North and South Vietnam,
 .North and South Korea, Taiwan, and Red
 China, too.
 In addition, we must ask Puerto Rico in as
 our 52d State, and extend the invitation to
 all the Central American republics to be-
 come States of the United States.
 We must offer more aid to Latin America.
 And we must convert 50 percent of our
 military spending to domestic spending for
 homes, hospitals, schools, roads, and conser-
 vation of our natural resources.
 Believe it or not, the only way to win the
 war in Vietnam is to withdraw and make all-
 out effort to win the war against poverty and
 unemployment and race hate here in the
 United States, and in our sister republics to
 the south of us.
 The only way to win the war in South
 Vietnam is to quit fighting a war in other
 people's lands, and then magnanimously of-
 fer the world a share in our limitless bounty
 for peace, for trade, for understanding.
 For we have nothing to fear if our de-
 mocracy is a working democracy, and if its
 fruits go down to our people and the people
 of the world.  We shouldn't fear the bogey-
 man of communism so much that we are
 willing to forfeit our destiny as world leader
 fighting a senseless war in Vietnam.  Let us
 pull out of Vietnam, militarily, but let us
 join the peaceful people of the world even
 more.
 For the only way to win the war against
 communism is to win the people of the world
 to our way of life-and our way of life is not
 conducive, as now constituted, to winning
 the people of the world to a great belief in
 our democracy.

 DEAR SENATOR MoasE: Enclosed is a copy
 of a letter on Vietnam I recently sent my
 two Senators and Representative.
 It was heartening to read Walter Lipp-
 mann's perceptive column of March 31 in
 which he concludes, "In southeast Asia we
 have entangled ourselves in one of the many
 upheavals against the old regime, and we
 shall not make things any better by thrash-
 ing around with ascending violence."
 This  tragic  and  immoral  war must  be
 stopped.  I am encouraged whenever I read
 about your  penetrating  speeches  on this
 subject on the floor of the Senate.
 I would like to receive your newsletter.
 Please put my name on your mailing list.
 With kindest regards.
 Sincerely.

 Senator WARREN G. MAGNUSON,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MAGNUSON: The U.S. Gov-
 ernment is guilty ofgross immorality in Vi-
 etnam.  It is conducting a war of annihila-
 tion against the people of that country.  It
 is bombing, burning, torturing and destroy-
 ing without the slightest regard for human
 life.  The  bombing  of  North  Vietnam is
 sheer madness.
 The story that we are losing the war in
 South Vietnam because of North Vietnamese
 support and supplies is a myth.  The guer-
 rillas we are fighting are South Vietnamese
 and the greater part of their weapons an
 captured U.S.-made weapons.
 It is a popular uprising we are trying t<
 extinguish in South Vietnam, led by tht
 National  Liberation  Front which  has the
 support of at least 80 percent of the people
 There are Communists within the NLF but
 they are in a minority. The objectives of the
 NLF are peace, independence, democracy and
 neutrality.
 In trying to extinguish ,this revolution the
 United States-Siagon forces have resorted to
 napalm bombing of villages, inhuman tor-
 ture, the bombing of hospitals and schools,
 the spraying of poisonous chemicals as de-
 foliants and now have sunk to the use of
 poison  gases  against  both  guerrillas  and
 civilians.
 I am shocked and outraged by these ac-
 tions.                                                                                                                                 I demand that a cease-fire be called,

 gotiations begun to establish peace and neu-
 tralization'in southeast Asia.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have never written
 you before.  I deeply apologize for such ne-
 glect because I have admired you over a long
 period of years.  How I do commend you for
 your courage in being willing to stand up to
 your convictions.  Too many people in all
 ages and today turn whichever way the wind
 blows.   I commend you for the stand you
 take in Vietnam; namely, the necessity and
 urgency of getting out of Vietnam.  To me
 your  arguments are valid and   should be
 so recognized by all persons with the respon-
 sibility of molding and formulating the de-
 cision--the  President,  Vice President, De-
 partment.of State, Congress, cabinet officers,
 and the general public. When your ideas on
 Vietnam become popular enough to be crys-
 talized into public opinion if it isn't too late
 with world war III with all of its nuclear
 destruction (God forbid), your speaking as
 a voice in the wilderness will be at an end.
 Then will your stanchness pay rich divi-
 dends.   Keep on "keeping on" with your
 cries to awaken the slothful and the indo-
 lent, the know-it-all and sophisticated, the
 sincere and earnest seekers for truth so that
 we  can make the slogan  of freedom and
 justice for all the reality and manifestation
 it should be.

 The Commission of the Churches on Inter-

 for a solution must be shifted from the bat-

 support  the  National    Council's General
 Board in its request to the U.S. Government:
 - "To engage in persistent efforts to nego-
 tiate a cease fire and a settlement of the
 war which will attempt to achieve the inde-

 the people of Vietnam;
 "To utilize United Nations assistance in
 achieving a solution and in seeking to re-
 duce the area of conflict by effective border
 control and internal policing; and
 "To give bold and creative leadership to
 a broad international development program
 for the Mekong region and to continue full
 scale U.S. economic and technical assistance
 where necessary."

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am writing to ex-
 press my support of your statements on our
 policy in Vietnam and to urge you to con-
 tinue in your stand.
 STATEMENT ON VIETNAM ADOPTED ON MARCH
 24, 1965, BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF
 THE BOARD OF CHRISTIAN SOCIAL CONCERNS
 OF THE METHODIST CHURCH
 We are gravely concerned over develop-
 ments in the war in Vietnam.  We acknowl-
 edge the complexity of the situation in
 southeast Asia,  and we recognize the ex-
 tremely difficult problems confronting the
 U.S. Government as it seeks to maintain as
 much as possible of that area free from Com-
 munist domination.  Those responsible for
 poligy determination deserve sympathetic
 understanding as they grapple with the un-
 pleasant choices which they confront.
 Nevertheless, we firmly believe that citizens
 of the United States and of other countries
 likely to be affected by the future course of
 events in southeast Asia have a right and a
 responsibility to study the issues and ex-
 press a thoughtful judgment as to the wis-
 dom of tpe national policies Involved.
 We; therefore, direct attention to the fol-
 lowing considerations.   The  bombing  of
 North Vietnam at an accelerating pace raises
 serious moral questions as to the appropri-
 ateness of the means chosen for the Imple-
 mentation of legitimate policy objectives. If
 the desired response from Hanoi and the
 Vietcong is not forthcoming, the present
 course of action could well lead to full-scale
 war with North Vietnam and possibly Com-
 munist China.  Such an'eventuality would
 be a disaster of world dimensions, and, in
 our judgment, out of proportion to the goal
 sought.
 Accompanying this military course of ac-
 tion has been an apparent coolness toward
 offers of mediation and toward negotiation
 on any- basis other than an unconditional
 acceptance of the terms laid down-by the
 United States.  We believe a proper regard
 for world opinion and the role of the United
 Nations calls for a clearer expression of read-

 But do you have to confine yourself t

 wrong?  Can you not go further and tak
 the lead in reestablishing Congress' righ
 to decide when we shall go to war and whet
 we shall not.   Article I section 8  clearl,
 gives Congress this power in the words "Con
 gress shall have power-to declare war, gran
 letters of marque and reprisal, and mak,
 rules concerning captures on land and water.'
 The mere fact that the present war is un
 declared does not abrogate Congress' righ~
 in this field, it seems to me.
 And our representatives in Congress have
 a responsibility to stop this un-American ad?
 venture on the other side of the world, anc
 to prevent the nuclear holocaust which mad
 follow.

 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.  --
 DEAR SIR: I am writing to you rather than
 to my own Senators because more. than any
 Member of Congress, you have been a leader
 in the fight against our unjust aggression in
 South and North Vietnam, and our flagrant
 and  increasing  violations  of  the  Geneva
 agreement.  President Johnson is getting
 more and more brutal and bloodthirsty.    He
 seems to recognize no moral or legal limits.
 Today I read of nonmilitary targets in North
 Vietnam being bombed, last week I read
 that poison gas attacks will continue, trial
 balloons on the use of nuclear bombs and
 on attacks on China are being placed in the
 press.
 With  increasing  justification,  Johnson's
 policies in Vietnam are being compared to
 those of Adolf Hitler.  Public opinion polls,
 letters and public officials, statements by
 clergy and intellectuals all oppose Johnson's
 course. But he has paid no heed to pleas
 for peace-neither to our own pleas nor to
 those'of international figures like U Thant,
 De-Gaulle, Shastri, Pearson, etc.
 Pleas, in short, appear to be futile; more
 drastic protest action is required.  I am writ-
 Ing this letter to urge you (the voice of con-
 science in the U.S. Congress), to call for
 impeachment proceedings against President
 Johnson.  Although I am sure he will not

 Cambridge, Mass., on March l  stated that
 "the Pentagon is deliberately pursuing a
 policy of escalation in Asia aimed at the
 destruction of Chinese nuclear installations
 within 90 to 120, days." He told his audience
 that "the failure of the new Vietnamri policy
 is frankly recognized in private by adminis-
 tr~ation officials, who are now determined to
 Ching about mounting, escalation of the war.
 :f the American people do not make their
 voices heard in support of U Thant, Pope
 'aul, and the Council of Churches in their
 ails for negotiations."  MORSE warned, "We
 stand to awaken only when we are being
 trenched in b}ood.
 "The white paper," MORSE noted,  "con-
 ains vi~tilaily nothing that was not known
 ast summer and fall when the:Pre,ident:was
 aying `We are not going north!  And both
 entagon and State Department Insisted that
 io 'useful
 p,urpose would be 'served in the
 youth by attacking the North., To put the
 ld stories in the white paper'and call them
 justification for expandingg, the war now
 when they weren't before" MORSE charged,
 is an llisult to the intelligence,of the entire
 vorld` not to .mention the Americans. "
 Since listening to the aforementioned Sun-

 DEAR  SENATOR                MORSE: I  am  greatly dis-
 turbed by, and opposed to, escalation of the
 war in Vietnam.                                I believe that this policy
 is more likely to lead to an upward spiral of
 retaliation,  destruction, and bitterness by
 both sides than it is to surrender by the
 North Vietnamese Government.
 I appreciate your efforts to bring about a
 change in our Government's policy.
 -I urge that we take the initiative in bring-
 ing about a cease-fire in Vietnam through
 the United Nations or the powers of the
 Geneva Conference of 1954, and in negotiat-
 ing an honorable settlement.
 .I am encouraged by the President's pro-
 posal that we should assist in a comprehen-
 sive program of economic development in
 Vietnam and elsewhere in southeast Asia,
 such as the Mekong River project.  I be-
 lieve that such a creative alternative should

 DEAR SENATOR:  I have sent the following
 telegram to the President:
 "As a student and young voter, I was
 deeply disturbed by your speech on Vietnam.
 Our bombings, brutal atrocities and sup-
 pression of truth, are both immoral and in-
 defensible.  Only an honorable America can
 take the first step to end this insanity."
 I have remained silent far too long on this
 'Issue.  I merely wished to inform you of my
 feelings in this matter.  Your concern and
 courage in this, as in so many other national
 matters, has been inspiring.  Thank you.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Thank you for being
 a courageous man. Thank you for speaking
 for the millions of Americans whose voices
 go unheard.
 What is there left for the moral American
 to do?  We have written our newspapers,
 written our Congressmen, marched in protest
 demonstrations-and yet we must go on liv-
 ing with our indignation and shame over our
 policy in Vietnam, because the voice of the
 people no longer counts.
 I appreciate your willingness to speak at
 a time when other politicians seem to seek
 their political -expediency through silence.
 Sincerely,
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to extend to
 you my heartfelt thanks for bringing to the
 attention of the American people the im-
 moral war which we are fighting in South
 Vietnam.
 That a great democratic nation such as
 ours can be waging a cruel and atrocious war
 in the name of freedom is hypocrisy epito-
 mized.  But there are many who share our
 sentiments and I therefore hope that you
 will not give up the fight.
 Thank you again.

 the rap for war while we will defend them.
 And for God's sake, yours, his and mine, to
 get them out right now.
 Furthermore tell him if by any means he
 wants to build some bad fences in Alabama
 to have Mrs. Johnson to start a Ladybird
 Special to Montgomery and Selma, to have
 her select a dozen or so governors' wives and
 take them along and call on Mrs. Wallace
 for a tea or perhaps she might invite them
 to a tea.
 I believe that would fix some broken fences
 for him because I don't think, according to
 the results of the last election, they don't
 feel  too  kindly  towards  him.   But  they
 would to Lady Bird's Special and, according
 to the newspapers, she is a very intelligent
 and gifted speaker herself. I am thinking
 for this trip an old fashioned campaign train
 with speeches off the back end of the train

 of that?

 We had too many wars already.  I have

 indefensible on legal, moral, and tactical

 our country is isolating Itself even from its

 CLEVELAND, OHIO,

 To the EDITOR,
 The Plain Dealer.
 The language of the President's speech re
 Vietnam was eloquent, but unrelated to real-
 ity.
 If a resolution were introduced in Congress
 to declare war against North Vietnam, the
 American people would oppose it overwhelm-
 ingly.
 The President is responsible for the death
 of every American boy killed in Vietnam in
 this illegal, undeclared war.  Furthermore,
 the'Congress has no right to place either the
 authority or responsibility upon the Presi-
 dent through resolutions which give the Pres-
 ident the Congress warmaking power.
 By and large the Vietnamese people want
 the Americans to get out of Vietnam.  They
 should have gotten out long ago.    France
 Won't support the U.S. position in Vietnam.
 Other NATO allies have given token support
 at most.
 It is not our sole responsibility to try and
 resolve the situation in Vietnam.  We are
 not a world police force.  If we continue go-
 ing it alone.  We shall be embroiled in wars
 all over the world, to the private delight of
 all. of our allies, who chuckle at our stupid-
 ity in sacrificing our men in distant parts of
 the world.
 We have no foreign policy except force,
 which will never bring lasting peace.
 We should certainly give our surplus food
 and more to the hungry peoples of the world.
 We should not force our presence where we
 are not wanted, we with our high standard
 of living, while they struggle to keep body
 and soul together with their rice plantings.
 The President knows that we certainly do
 want something in  Vietnam-we want to
 dominate and control.  So, we had better get
 out of Vietnam at once, where the lives of
 our boys are being sacrificed needlessly.

 READERS' FORUM,

 Pasadena, Calif.
 DEAR  SIR:  Vice President HUBERT  HuM-
 PHREY and other administration lackeys are
 showing signs of frustration over their fail-
 lire to sell the war in Vietnam.                                                            He is quoted
 in Los Angeles:  "Some people get a little
 more concerned about our deeds than Com-
 munist terrorism."  "I haven't heard of any
 demonstration about their blowing up our
 Embassy."
 There was a time when the United States
 was only advising their friends, the South
 Vietnamese, on how to deal with restless
 elements.  This farce was at its peak dur-
 ing the regime of that great democrat who
 never got elected, Ngo Dinh Diem.  Remem-
 ber him?                                                                         Many saw Mr. Diem as a corrupt
 and arrogant despot but he was the best
 that Mr. Dulles could find to serve as the
 cent who could invite the United States
 to participate in South Vietnamese affairs-
 for a price, of course.
 Mr. Diem duty invited the United States
 in but it turned out that more than ad-
 visers were needed because the Diem poli-
 cies were somehow alienating his own sub-
 jects.  Some left wingers have even sug-
 gested that, had the elections of 1956 been
 held (as required by the 1954 Geneva Agree-
 ment), Ho Chi Minh of the North would
 have won  handily.   President  Eisenhower
 had this to say: "I have never talked or cor-
 responded with a person knowledgeable in
 Indochinese affairs who did not agree that
 had elections been held as of the time of
 the fighting, possibly 80 percent of the popu-
 lation would have voted for the Communist
 Ito Chi Minh as their leader rather than
 Chief of State Bao Dai."   This comment
 about Bao Dai (long since retired to the
 rigors of the French Riviera) has been ap-
 plied by spiteful souls to include Diem.
 Naturally, Diem, although a great demo-
 crat (haven't we been assured endless times
 on this count) could not tolerate a demo-
 cratic election of He Chi Minh.  The result
 has been that Diem is gone and was for a
 time supplanted by a number of generals,
 very democratic ones_ to be sure.  Finally,
 the generals were effaced and the United
 States has stepped in and is running the
 show.  Everyone knows that nothing could
 he more democratic than that.  The great-
 est irony is that the restless elements in
 South Vietnam have come to regard the
 United States as fair game for ambushes,
 blowing up of embassies, and other deviltry-
 all this while their arms bear the signature
 "Made in U.S.A."  There simply is no grati.
 tude left in this world.

 DAVID B. NIELSEN.

 HONORABLE  SIR: My  wife and  I  are  two
 Americans who approve of the stand you are
 taking on the Vietnam war. We are deeply
 concerned about the warlike gestures of the
 present administration. We believe that mil-
 lions of American citizens disapprove, but we
 fear that not enough of them are concerned
 enough to do anything about it.  Like you
 we are strongly convinced that we have no
 legal nor moral right to be down there, and
 we are not impressed by the President's ex-
 cuses for 4is actions.
 We call ourselves a nation under God, but
 God seems to be completely left out in the
 decisions of our leaders.  We are acting like
 savages with guns.  We are incurring the dis-
 approval and hatred of the world.  We can
 not stand against the whole world. We an
 courting war with China and probably witl
 Russia, which would be disastrous. Nobod
 would win.  We are bombing helpless people
 destroying their land;  burning them witl
 napalm and poisoning them with gas.
 We should negotiate now, and withdraw
 with dignity, not necessarily as victors bu
 with prudence and the love of God.
 Our military seem to be drunk with powee
 and the President must be ill advised.  His
 tort' teaches us that the decline and fall o
 empires always ensue when that empire seek
 to conquer the world.  The peaceful nation
 that seek no conquests are the ones that sur
 vive.
 We hope you will become our Presiders
 some day so that we may have peace withou
 fear.

 PEAR SENATOR MORSE: I Wish to congratu-
 late you for the courageous statements you
 have made concerning the U.S. Involvement
 in southeast Asia,  It seems to me that what
 we have done there has been simply to
 solidify the forces against America and to
 turn world public opinion against us.  As one
 who has lived in the Orient several years and
 has traveled in the interior of Vietnam, I
 feel convinced that the United States cannot
 win a war there any more than France was
 able to do it there ar in Algeria.  The forces
 of nationalism are too strong to allow a U.S.
 military victory., Let us not do the things
 that we had     afraid Goldwater would have
 done had he been elected President.

 GRADUATE STUDENTS IN ASIAN STUDIES.
 MARCH 24, 1965.
 Ion. LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON,
 tirely agree with this analysis.  Therefore, it
 is incomprehensible how the recent drastic
 intensification of direct military participa-
 tion can attain our professed goals of a stable
 and independent Government in a peaceful
 South Vietnam.
 The increasingly overt U.S. Involvement
 and direction of the war can only undermine
 whatever remaining support the Saigon gov-
 ernment has in South Vietnam by completely
 identifying it with a foreign power.   Since
 Vietcong strategy, following the classical lines
 of wars of national liberation, is to mobilize
 mass support on a nationalist appeal of re-
 sistance to foreign intervention, the Ameri-
 can military presence removes any possibility
 of the local government gaining the popular
 support necessary to defeat the Vietcong.
 Simili?arly, the bombing of North Vietnam
 cannot win a guerrilla war in South Vietnam.
 It can, however, expand the war into a major
 conflagration In the. Far East whose ultimate
 consequences would be unforeseeable,
 That such risks should be taken: in a mili-
 tary policy that is self-defeating to our pur-
 poses in South Vietnam we find appalling.
 Furthermore, the increasing suppression of
 information from Vietnam further under-
 mines our faith in the wisdom and efficacy
 of this policy.  We therefore strongly urge
 you to reconsider this futile attempt at a
 military solution to what is essentially not
 a military problem. Since suppression of the
 Vietcong now seems impossible, other means
 of securing a peaceful settlement in Vietnam
 must be explored.
 Respectfully,

 DEAR  SENATOR MORSE:  We would like to

 volvement cannot settle political and eco-
 nomic problems.
 We have written to our own Senators

 now.
 President Johnson gave us a flame of en-

 Johnson was complaining about the press
 conjecturing about a disagreement over Viet-

 what they do."  Now I believe that tradition-
 ally people who have delusions of being God
 or Christ are considered mentally ill.  At any
 rate, this remark suggests a frightening ar-

 the humility that marks a scholar of human

 man?      Would letters to Vice President HUM-
 PHREY be more useful?  I haven't written to
 McGeorge Bundy-I started to but his resem-

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  The United States
 has no business in Vietnam.  When the U.S.
 Government has to pay an enemy to stop
 fighting, after we already have them whipped
 to a standstill, which cost us billions of dol-
 lars in the first place to do; I, as many other
 citizens  feel  that our representatives  are
 trying to bankrupt our Nation.
 If I should try to run my business on bor-
 rowed money that I couldn't pay for, my
 complete organization would collapse.
 We, as citizens have no complaint when our
 tax moneys are spent on the improvement of
 our own country; but when we have to sup-
 port foreign dictators, large and small, with
 our tax dollars, I feel that we have gone too
 far.
 Please, do everything in your power to cur-
 tail this gross sabotage of the American tax
 dollar.  We, the people, depend on you, as
 one of our representatives.  You are a cus-
 todian of our American heritage.  Let's re-
 lieve the tax burden at home now, by cur-
 tailing  all  giveaways  of any kind  to  all
 foreign nations.
 Let's be Americans, let's think American,
 and let's take care of America.
 Thank you and best wishes.

 problem, even if Russia has not paid all its
 dues.  If we do not support the United Na-
 tions, our chance for real and lasting peace
 will end.
 I believe our intensification of the war in
 Vietnam and the bombing of cities in North
 Vietnam has only solidified the peoples of
 Asia against us.  If we spread even further
 to the bombing of China, more of Asia will
 join against us.
 I believe we should be sure that what we
 are really doing is right, and, it it is right, it
 would be the will of God.  So with this in
 mind, let us look at all the reasons we are
 in Vietnam.  If we are wrong in any way,
 which Is very possible, let us admit it and ask
 the United Nations to settle this problem
 now.
 In your speech tonight you said you asked
 yourself each night if you had done all you
 could for peace, etc.  You suggested that
 each of us ask ourselves the ekme question.
 I asked myself tonight, as I have many times
 before afid' the answer is "No."  That is why
 I am writing you.  If I did not write you of
 my concern, I would not be doing my part'
 today. However, if I wrote only to you it
 still would be insufficient; so I am sending
 copies to some Members of Congress.
 May God be with us-all.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I heard the speech
 of our President and I have read it. with
 care.  I am horrified that it is being ac-
 cepted as a peace speech.  It is the most well-
 thought-out effort to further confuse the
 American people and surely anyone who is
 knowledgeable about what is going on knows
 this well.  Our people can all be fooled-
 soIetimes--but, as history shows, not for all
 time and they are increasingly aware these
 days that we have no legitimate business in
 Vietnam, that the killing, the burning, the
 destruction of food as well as people, has no
 justification in the eyes of any but a small,
 wealthy, powerful (because U.S. supported)
 group who will be overthrown when the Na-
 tional Liberation Front achieves victory.
 now can we mouth words about loving
 people, grieving over the hungry, etc., at the
 very moment when we send more soldiers
 and planes and arms to this landZ
 I hope that people who, like yourself, do
 have some vision of a future for the world
 other than nuclear destruction, will make
 clear that-while the Mekong Delta idea is
 line-not new, already underway with many
 countries-it  is  impossible  because  the
 United States keeps the civil war going and
 expands-it.  First--cease-fire--then begin to
 find ways to talk instead of kill.  And I hope
 too that there will be voices to point out
 that it Is as futile and deceitful to talk of
 negotiations without the so-called Vietcong
 (National Liberation Front) as it would have
 been for the British to announce their desire
 for peace-but negotiations to be only with
 the French.
 We need every voice of sanity.  Help bring
 some to the Halls of the Senate-join Senator
 GRUENING who speaks with such a clear and
 brave and true voice.

 COLUMNISTS--IF GOLDWATER HAD WON
 How would the United States have fared if
 Barry Goldwater had been elected President?
 "The mind boggles to think of it," mused
 Columnist Art Buchwald last week in the
 New  York   Herald  Tribune.  Nonetheless,
 Buchwald did his deadpan best to guess how
 things really would have turned out under
 Goldwater.  To begin with, he wrote, "the
 Vietcong would have blown up an American
 barracks.   Goldwater -would  immediately
 call for a strike on military bases in North
 Vietnam and announce  a 'new tit-for-tat
 policy.'  Democrats would make speeches that
 Goldwater was 'trigger happy' and was trying
 to get us into a war with Red China.
 "But Goldwater would ignore the criticism
 and continue the raids, using not only Air
 Force bombers, but also jets from the U.S.
 Fleet.  As time went on, he would explain
 that, instead of a 'tit-for-tat' policy, we now
 intended to bomb North Vietnam in order to
 let Hanoi know that they could not support
 the Vietcong without expecting retaliation.
 "Senators would call for some sort of nego-
 tiations.  But Goldwater,- with his lack of
 restraint, would retort that there is nothing
 to negotiate and we would only be selling
 out southeast Asia if we sat down at a table
 with the North Vietnamese and Red China.
 Instead, he would recklessly announce that
 he was sending in a battalion of Marines
 with Hawk missiles to protect our airfields.
 His critics would claim he was escalating the
 war, but Goldwater would deny it.  Instead
 he would bomb supply routes in Laos and
 Cambodia.
 "To explain these desperate actions, Gold-
 water would have the Defense and State De-
 partments produce a `white paper' justify-
 ing the attacks and proving that Hanoi was
 responsible for therevolution in South Viet-
 nam."
 Of    course,  wrote  Buchwald,  Democrats
 would hotly insist they had known all along
 that  Goldwater would plunge the United
 States into a war.  Republicans would arguf
 that Goldwater had no choice, that anywa;
 he had merely inherited the Vietnam mes
 from  the  Democrats.  "It  all  seems  far
 fetched," allowed Buchwald, "and I may havf
 let my imagination run away with itself, be-
 cause even Barry Goldwater wouldn't have
 gone so far.  But fortunately, with Presiden,
 Johnson at the helm, we don't even have t<
 think about It."

 MY DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to praise
 you for you stand on the southeast Asia
 situation.  Are we going to have a truce, like

 Harry  Truman called the Korean war a
 police action, but if - Margaret Truman had
 been 2d Lt. Harry Truman, Jr., and in the
 Army in Korea in 1950, I'll bet it would have
 been declared a war.
 I had command of an ammunition ship in

 WRONG VIETNAM POLICY
 To the EDITOR:
 In seeking to establish peace in southeast
 Asia, President Johnson has placed himself
 under a severe handicap by taking the ad-
 vice of the same men who persuaded Presi-
 dent Kennedy to continue the Eisenhower-
 Dulles policy of unilateral military interven-
 tion in Vietnam, instead of-as in Laos-
 seeking to implement the Geneva accords of
 1954.
 The more this interventionist policy has
 failed, the more its sponsors insist upon try-
 ing to redeem failure by ever deeper, more
 dangerous and more reckless commitment of
 United States prestige and power.
 It is now evident that the policy urged
 upon Presidents Kennedy and Johnson has
 failed and will continue to fail if carried
 further.  When a policy has shown itself in-
 capable of achieveing its ends, there is only
 one thing to do and that is to adopt a dif-
 ferent policy.   And when Presidential ad-
 visers who have sponsored a bankrupt policy
 refuse to recognize the need for changing
 course, it is time for the President to seek
 other advice.
 ECONOMIC COOPERATION
 To the outside observer it appears that
 President Johnson is about the only "dove"
 among the present policyrnakers.  He alone
 has spoken, vaguely to be sure, of the kind
 of economic cooperation with all of south-
 east Asia which might bring the warring
 factions to the conference table.
 Surely there are in Washington men able
 and willing to help the President formulate
 a clear-cut policy for peace; Walter Lipp-
 man's  recent  articles are an outstanding
 example, and there are plenty of leaders in
 the world who stand ready to help end an
 ill-advised adventure that more and more
 threatens world peace and, with it, the Presi-
 dent's noble hope     of establishing in  the
 Great American Society an example of what
 all men everywhere may hope eventually to
 achieve.

 to me that this might as easily be an at-

 lull the consciences of those abroad and at
 home, while the aggressive war is continued
 or expanded.  L.B.J.'s "sons" are not dying-
 his daughters are safe and I dare say if Mc-
 Namara and Bundy have them, they are safe,
 too.  The people of South Vietnam are not
 allowed to decide-and it is an evil thing we
 do to forbid people the right to be free of

 SIR:  President Johnson is waging a war
 against North Vietnam beyond any power
 given him by the Constitution or any Fed-

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: A short note of sup-
 port for your stand on the present U.S. policy
 in Vietnam, and encouragement for your con-
 tinued vigorous protests of the administra-
 tion's policies there.
 I shan't bore you with the reasons I find
 present U.S. policies in Vietnam most shock-
 ing, and quite frightening; they do coincide
 in general with your own views as elaborated
 last month at Harvard University, however.
 What disturbs me most, though, is the al-
 most  unanimous  accedence  of  your  col-
 leagues in Congress with the President's
 rather bellicose policy in Vietnam. I have
 and shall continue to hammer away at my
 own Representatives on the subject. Poor
 fellows, they are not blessed with such short
 letters.
 Best wishes.
 Most sincerely,

 MY  TURN
 (By John O'Hara)
 It was a frightening picture that has
 stayed with me, and I am not one to use
 that word, frightening, every day.
 The taxi drivers of New York City for
 years had refused to be organized into a
 anion.  Back in 1934, for instance,  the
 drivers had to. fight the goons who over-
 turned their cabs and beat them up, but
 the hackies remained unorganized.   So it
 has remained until this. year, and the pro-
 fessional unionists did not like that,
 There are only 11,000 cabs in the city,
 but they are public conveyances and the
 public had a constant reminder .of the fact
 that in all these years, the organizers had
 been unable to compel the hackies to join
 up.  From the professional unionists' point
 of view, that was a disgrace, and it could not
 continue.
 So this year the unionists went all out.
 Although there had just been a fare in-
 eretse, that made no difference. They began
 workln5 on ihehackies early in the winter,
 iinally calling a meeting in Madison Square
 Garden,  which  was  attended  by several
 thousand hackles.
 To make sure the meeting would be at-
 tended, the unionists announced, that the
 hacks were not to roll that day. Some did,
 and  their tires, were spiked, windshields
 smashed, some members of the public and

 The head of the garment workers screamed
 and waved his arms and said his union had
 180,000 members  who  would support  the
 hackies, and he emphasized the word finan-
 cially.                                                                                     The mayor of New York, who will
 run for reelection this year, sat there with
 the head of the electrical workers and the
 head of the garment workers, and thereby
 gave quasi-official support to the takeover.
 The mayor is not personally popular with
 the hackles, but the garment workers and
 the electricians are big unions and he needs
 them.
 You looked down at the  first few rows
 in the audience, and you saw the new breed
 of professional unionists, who obviously had
 never driven hacks for a living.  And inter-
 spersed among them were the union tumul-
 ers.
 A tumuler is a cheerleader, a master of
 ceremonies.  It Is a Yiddish word that used
 to be applied to the entertainment directors
 at  the  summer  hotels  in  the  Catskills.
 Danny Kaye, for instance, started out as a
 tumuler.  But Willkie had his tumulers at
 the Republican convention in 1940;     Gold-
 water had them.
 The      meeting  ended, and the   unionists
 won.     After all those embarrassing years of
 shame, all they had to do was smash a few
 cab windows, injure a few citizens, spike a
 few tires, and get some big union leaders and
 Wagner of city hall on a platform, and the
 hackles succumbed,
 You  can  buy  beer at  Madison Square
 Garden, but this was not even a beer-hall

 Well, not quite. But it's the way you get
 your message across if you want to organize

 quantity of inconvenience to the public, the
 promise of financial support by big labor,
 and  the  active  cooperation  of  compliant
 politicians.
 TIIE NEW FACE OF FASCISM
 A few days later Martin Luther King de-
 manded a total economic boycott of Alabama
 Industry, and did he not state that he would
 enlist the support of the unionists?  Had he
 not already been photographed with another
 Detroit boy, Walter Reuther?. Had not var-
 ious Governors sent their representatives to
 Selma?
 The naive, the outraged, the victimized, the
 men and women who loathe the Ku Klux

 subverters, the sinister, and decent indigna-

 We are looking in the wrong direction for
 the new fascism, which will not be called
 fascism and will not be identifiable by swas-

 began in beer halls and in marches, among
 the middle class people who were more or
 less committed to some form of socialism.
 We saw what happened to them, and to the

 DEAR      MR.                              PRESIDENT:  I  strongly  endorse
 your initiative for peace made to your ad-
 dress on April 7th at Johns Hopkins Univer-
 sity.
 Both your offer of "unconditional discus-
 sion" and the proposal of massive aid to
 Southeast Asia were most helpful and com-
 mendable.
 I know that you are faced with many grave
 decisions  concerning  Vietnam  and  sense
 many conflicting pressures, but I respectfully
 urge you to make every possible step to lessen
 the liklihood of a direct confrontation be-
 tween mainland China and the United States.
 I hope that you will give serious consider-
 ation tp the suggestion that the air strikes
 be  called  off  since  they  appear  only  to
 strengthen the resolve of the North Viet-
 namese.and are likely to drive them further
 toward their Chinese and Russian allies.
 I heartily support every effort toward peace
 and reconciliation in Vietnam.

 struction of all we hold dear, and our little
 ones.
 There should be a pause in the air attacks
 of our country on the North Vietnamese, and
 not to invade the territory involving China.
 This is a grave mistake. Our President voices
 hope and words for peace efforts, but the
 next day, papers have great headlines of ad-
 ditional troops landing, planes, and heavy
 equipment for battle.
 This is confusing to many and especially
 to an oriental mind who would think we do
 not mean what we say.   They ate slower
 to move and do not think the same as we do.
 It is the time not to be too quick.  There
 must be a pause or cease fire, so to speak, so
 that the efforts seeking settlement may have
 a chance.  Sometimes we must be still, so
 God can have the chance to  answer the
 prayers of many and help.
 We feel that the United Nations must play
 a vital role in bringing about a settlement.
 The pause would help there also.
 Through the help of the United Nations,
 many think that we should have a contin-
 gent of troops together with those from other
 U.N. nations-a peace force to see that fight-
 ing stops and to police the area of conflict.
 This, with an internationally supported
 economic and social program of reconstruc-
 tion and development many think desirable
 to have peace established, then we should
 leave the mainland of Asia.  It is the land
 of oriental peoples.
 Protestant clergymen and all their people
 ask that "vigorous efforts be made now to
 negotiate an end to the war." May God help
 us and give you wisdom to help.  Kind re-
 gards and wishes, I am

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Your speech against
 our policy in Vietnam might have been made
 not in Athens, Ohio, but over 2,000 years ago
 in Athens, Greece, before Greece ruined it-
 self in the treacherous and uncalled-for ex-
 pedition in Syracuse.
 The people are again misled by warmon-
 gers and profiteers.  Their good sense of self-
 sacrifice and patriotism is again being per-
 verted to the ruin of all of us.
 Thank God for WAYNE MORSE and a hand-

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: From 8 p.m., March
 24 to 8 a.m., March 25 an all-night teach-in
 to protest American policy in Vietnam was
 held at the University of Michigan.  Two
 hundred and fifteen members of-the faculty
 and staff of the university sponsored the 12-
 hour program of lectures and seminars de-
 signed to inform the academic  and local
 communities on Vietnam and the nature of
 the war which is taking place there, and to
 search for viable peaceful alternatives to our
 Government's present aggressive course. En-
 closed is a copy of a petition sent to Presi-
 dent Johnson which was signed by 768 of
 those who participated in the program.
 At the conclusion of the sessions a resolu-
 tion was passed to broaden our local action
 into a national faculty-student movement
 which would engage the active participation
 of  academic  communities  throughout the
 country in a, continuing program of protest
 and  constructive  criticism.   Telegrams  of
 support have already been received from al-
 most 50 colleges and universities across the
 Nation with assurances that several have al-
 ready scheduled or are scheduling teach-ins
 of their own.  Plans also are now being made
 for a national teach-in.
 We wish to thank you for your continuing
 efforts against our foolhardy attempts at a
 military solution to the problems of south-
 east Asia.   We will continue to keep you
 informed of our activities, and hope, that if
 you have any suggestions to make as to how
 our group can be most effective, that you
 will send them on to us.

 nam mess.  Please don't ever falter in your
 most patriotic fight against what we are
 doing there.  I recall enough of the 1954
 Geneva Conference (when Dulles walked out
 in a huff) to know that our policy there is
 very wrong.   The only people around here
 that are for our policy in Vietnam, strangely
 enough, are those who supported Goldwater.
 When I read this morning's paper about
 the mass defoliation and burning out of a
 forest there, all I could think of is that Gold-
 water is  smiling with satisfaction.   I am
 shocked, sickened,  and  horrified  at  the
 napalm, gassing, and the wholesale slaughter
 going on there.  It defies all morals, ethics,
 and decency, for I sincerely believe those
 people in South Vietnam are fighting a civil
 war in which we have no business, except to
 help bring it to an end.
 I've written President Johnson my views
 and also enclosed a clipping quoting Pope
 Paul's pleas for a ceasefire before the thing
 gets out of hand.
 Thank you again and keep up the good
 fight.

 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ALL-NIGHT PROTEST-
 TEACH-IN ON THE WAR IN VIETNAM, 8 P.M.
 MARCH 24 TO 8 A.M. MARCH 25, 1965
 Mr. PRESIDENT: We, members of the facul-
 ty, staff, and student body of the University
 of Michigan, and citizens of the local com-
 munity, have joined together for an  all-
 night protest at the university against the
 policy of the United States Government in
 Vietnam.  Our protest has taken the form
 of a series of lectures and discussions through
 the night, in search of nonmilitary solutions
 to the problems of southeast Asia.
 We are profoundly concerned about your
 present course of military expansion, and do
 not believe that it can bring about a perma-
 nent and satisfactory resolution of the con-
 flict.  We call upon you to initiate a policy,
 not of intensified war in southeast Asia, but
 of an offensive for peace.  The conferences
 and neogtiations for such solutions are long
 and hard, but we urge that they begin now.
 Let us begin with constructive initiatives
 toward a cease-fire.  These must include the
 cessation of our unilateral military actions,
 including the bombing missions into North
 Vietnam, and our introduction of grotesque
 weaponry, such as the nonlethal gas recent-
 ly tested.  It must also include a greater re-
 spect for the safety of civilian populations in
 both parts of Vietnam.  Nothing short of
 such a total effort to effect a negotiated set-
 tlement in Vietnam will lead our Nation
 back upon the path of reason and morality
 from which we have so dangerously strayed.

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I read the New York

 In listen .to radio and television discussions
 and try to inform myself as well as possible
 on the  reasons for our war  in Vietnam.
 Much of the information heard and read is
 contradictory and I realize that you have
 more information than the general public,
 but for some time now I have had to conclude
 that we are greviously wrong In taking part
 in the involved politics of that unhappy
 country.
 I therefore urge you to turn from this
 course Immediately and negotiate.  I fear
 we are wasting men, supplies, and money
 and gaining nothing but resentment and Ill
 will toward ourselves.  I do not care to win
 a war, even 6, justified one, which this one is
 not, by destroying a people's food supply
 and shade trees, by using gas, even a little
 bit of harmless gas and by making little chil-
 dren squeal on parents.  How low can we
 sln)e?  Shame on, us.
 Mr. President, let us discontinue retalia-

 begin negotiations now in spite of present
 unfavorable conditions.

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:  I once again implore

 redirect the U.S. foreign policy so as to prac-
 tice world government under law for all na-
 tions and a peaceful settlement of all dis-
 putes.  Such a policy practiced by the United
 States would be to live up to our best tradi-
 tions and to help fulfill the hopes of a world

 I say."   Individual violence, whether in a
 big city, or by the Ku Klux Klan or by whom-

 DEAR SENATOR MO.lSE: I admire your cour-
 age in saying on TV that our present policy
 in Vietnam is leading us into a large-scale
 war in Asia, and I thoroughly agree with
 you.  You are not second-guessing the Presi-
 dent, either, because you said months ago
 on TV that we should work this out through
 the United Nations rather than to intervene
 as we have done, and you were absolutely
 right.
 Johnson has been acting like a Russian
 czar rather than the head executive of a
 democracy every since he was elected, but he
 has done exactly what the voters rejected
 Goldwater for advocating, by escalating the
 war in Vietnam.. Furthermore, he ought to
 be impeaced for the administration coverup
 of the Bobby Baker graft ring, because it is
 obvious that to expose Baker would have
 been very embarrassing to some much higher
 up.
 It is unfortunate that you are not in John-
 son's job, and if the voters really picked
 their elected leaders, you would have been
 a much more likely choice than Johnson.
 Mr. Johnson and Mr. Goldwater both were
 the choices of the people who have been en-
 riching themselves at the taxpayers expense
 for years with the money from supplying
 military materiel  and  equipment for  the
 cold war.
 The late President Kennedy had thawed
 the cold war to the point where China and
 Russia had turned on each other, and the
 people who are exploiting the cold war didn't
 want that. They want the cold war to go on,
 but it is turning into a very hot war fast
 under  Johnson's  leadership.   We  will  be
 lucky if we have an economic collapse before
 we have atomic war.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE           April 21, 1965
 We, the United States, are aiding, abetting,
 and committing murder in Vietnam without
 (just) cause, and without the sanction of the
 people of the United States as provided in
 the U.S. Constitution.  We are killing and a
 party to the killing of an innocent people
 against whom we have no just grievance.
 Our  own  innocent    sons  are  making  the
 supreme sacrifice in an Asian war not of our
 making, not of our cause and not of our busi-
 ness to commit our sons to the jungle
 sacrifice.
 President Johnson was elected on a promise
 of peace ticket in the sense that the Repub-
 lican nominee could only promise a more
 vigorous action  in the Asian  war, which
 obviously God loving, God fearing, and merci-
 ful people did not want.
 The Congress of the United States is the
 only constitutional agency, short of an in-
 vasion, that has power to make war.   My
 God, why does it not exert its constitutional
 power to  call  a  halt to our invasion of
 Vietnam?  Our cities and our people should
 be spared the deadly destruction now being
 poured upon others.  Our best security lies
 not in making war upon others, and that I

 has spread only because the 'respectable'
 powers refused to do something about the
 burning problems of poverty and oppression."
 To hear over our news media that our
 leaders think the American people "would
 never consent to negotiation on the Vietnam
 matter," and that such leaders are afraid
 to have Red Chinese delegates come to the
 U.N. to discuss our mutual problems because
 our people might become screaming meemies
 and toss such delegates into the ocean, makes
 us ill.
 Why not air the causes of our failure to
 deal sensibly with the Red China problem
 since 1949 and let us see how our McCarthy-
 ism and extremist followups have made us
 the laughingstock of the world, as well as a
 danger to world peace?
 Why doesn't this Democratic Administra-
 tion enlist the aid of the 1936 GOP presi-
 dential candidate, Alf M. Landon, of Kansas,
 who makes such good sense now in his plea
 for U.S. recognition of Red China and for our
 support in getting her into the U.N.; as well
 as approaching "Mao's formal proposal to
 all the countries of the world (for a summit
 conference on nuclear weapons) with cordial-
 ity and caution rather than with coldness
 and negativity"?  That would be a biparti-
 san effort and help tQ blunt the opposition of
 the far right, it seems to me.
 As an American citizen, I am glad that
 the world is hearing your continuing pleas

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: You with your ener-
 gy and ability can bring this to the Senate
 floor and end this mess.  Since when can
 Presidents order killing without consulting
 the Senate or the American people?
 believe that you axe this man.  But how long
 is it going to take?  The Asiatics, Europeans,
 Latin and South American peoples are not
 being fooled by us.  They know the score
 and it is up to you, Mr. President, to nego-
 tiate now before it is too late.
 We have no business trying to settle the
 business of real revolutionaries 10,000 miles
 from our shores no more than we would
 tolerate interference from other countries
 when we so desperately fought the English
 in our Revolution.  Further, if it is not a
 crime for us to bomb incessantly the poor
 North Vietcong, then it is not a crime to have
 our embassies bombed in retaliation.
 Mr. President, I beg of you, let's stop inter-
 fering with the affairs of other people.  Let's
 show them that democracy can really work.
 Let's give a brave people the right to over-
 throw corrupt 24-hour governments and let's
 save our children from being devoured by
 insects that will flourish and be the only
 gainers.
 A line from you is invited.

 PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE IN VIETNAM
 (By Lewis Mumford)
 (EDrroR's NOTE.-The following letter on
 America's role in Vietnam was written to
 President Johnson by critic Lewis Mumford.)
 Mr.  President:  The time  has  come  for
 someone to speak out on behalf of the great
 body of your countrymen who regard with
 abhorrence the course to which you are com-
 mitting the United States in Vietnam.                                                                                                                                    As
 a holder of the Presidential Medal of Free-
 dom, I have a duty to say plainly, and in
 public, what millions of patriotic fellow citi-
 zens are saying in the privacy of their homes;
 namely, that the course you are now follow-
 ing affronts both our practical judgment and
 our moral sense.
 Neither your manners nor your methods
 give us any assurance that your policy will
 lead to a good end; on the contrary, your
 attempt-to cure by-military force a situation
 that has been brought about by our own ar-
 rogant, one-sided political assumptions can-
 not have any final destination short of an ir-
 remediable nuclear catastrophe. That would
 constitute the terminal illness of our whole
 civilization, and your own people, no less
 than the Vietnamese and the Communists
 would be the helpless victims.
 In embarking on this program, you are
 gambling with your country's future, because
 you have not the courage to discard a losing
 hand and start a new deal, though this was
 the magnificent opportunity that your elec-
 tion presented to you.  Your games theorists
 have persuaded you to play Russian roulette.
 But you cannot save the Government's face
 by blowing out our country's brains.
 From the beginning, the presence of Amer-
 ican forces in Vietnam, without the author.
 ity of the United Nations, was in defiance o
 our own solemn commitment when we helper
 to form that body.   Our steady involvemen
 with the military dictators who are wagin
 civil war in South Vietnam, with our ex
 travagant financial support and underhande
 military cooperation, is as indefensible as of
 Government's original refusal to permit
 popular election to be held in Vietnam, is
 communism should be installed by popul:
 vote.  Your attempt now to pin the whc
 blame on the government of North Vietna
 deceives no one except those whose wishf

 DEAR  SENATOR  GRUENING:  I  have  been
 listening to your opinions on the Vietnam
 matter over television and  reading about

 I agree with you completely.   As Sidney

 "We have made of communism a cause of

 it has been an effect of them.  Communism

 Mr. President, your children as well as
 mine, and my grandchildren are not being
 given a chance to make friends and patch
 up the differences that exist and that you
 have inherited.  Instead of making friends,
 we are making more and more enemies all
 over the world.
 We blundered when we sent our boys to
 Korea, and we blundered more when we sent
 our so-called advisers to Vietnam.  It takes
 a big man to say that we erred, and I still

 eking originally committed us to our
 h-handed intervention: the same,set of
 neles and intelligences that inveigled us
 o the Bay of Pigs disaster.
 .nstead of using your well-known political
 :oitness.to rescue our country from the
 litary miscalculations and political blun-
 rs that created our impossible position in
 stnaln, you now, casting all caution to the
 nds, propose to increase the area of sense
 as destruction and extermination, without
 iving any other visible ends in view than
 conceal our political impotence.  In tak-
 ig this unreasonable course, you not merely
 iow a lack of "decent respect for the opin-
 >ns of mankiind,"but you likewise mock and
 etray all our country's humane traditions.
 This betrayal is all the more sinister be-
 ause you are now, it is plain, obstinately
 .ommitting us to the very military policy
 ;hat your countrymen rejected when they so
 overwhelmingly  defeated  the  Republican
 candidate.
 Before you go further, let us tell you clear-
 ly: your professed aims are emptied of mean-
 Ing by your totalitarian tactics and your
 afhilistic strategy.  We are shamed by your
 ;actions, and, revolted by your dishonest ex-
 cuses and pretexts.                          What is worse, we are
 horrified by the immediate prospect of hav-
 ing our country's fate in the hands of lead-
 ers who, time and again, have shown their
 inability to think straight, to correct their
 errors, or to get out of a had situation with-
 out creating a worse one.
 The Government has-forfeited our confl-
 dence; and we will oppose, with every means
 available within the law, the execution of
 this impractical, and above all, morally in-
 defensible policy.  There is only one way in
 which you can remove our opposition or re-
 gain our confidence;  and that 1s to turn
 back from the course you have taken and
 to seek a human way out.
 Thank you, for your effort to stop the war
 in Vietnam.   Please read Hans Morganthau's
 afece  In  the current New_ Republic.  This
 should be read to the Senate.
 May commonsense prevail.

 DEAR  SIR:  Indubitably your name will
 and in history along with that of Bertrand
 issell, of England, Jerome D. Frank, Linus
 uling, and others who have devoted so
 ich effort toward avoiding a nuclear holo-
 ast.
 '< sequel to your incisive remarks in the
 rate is Bertrand Russell's article, "The
 Lr of Atrocity in Vietnam."  Lord Russell
 !ticulously documented his case and plead-
 for President Johnson to listen to reason
 her than get us swept up into a nuclear
 r.  The absurdity of escalation is apt to
 .minate in an Armageddon.  Why, why,
 y will not our President listen to those
 o plead for peace rather than those who
 all too anxious to beat out the all too
 ailiar sounds of the war drums?  Lord
 ;lssell's article appeared in the December
 964 issue of "The Minority of One." This
 ; the one publication which has the cour-
 ge to print material on Vietnam that urges
 rithdrawal.  Senator MORSE, in order that
 tore Americans might read your views on
 'ietnam, please write an article and mail it
 o the following address: M. S. Arnoni, editor,
 'he Minority of One, Inc.; 155 Pennington
 .venue, 'Post Office Box 544, Passaic, N.J.
 'he writer is confident that Mr. Arnonf
 'ould be honored to publish an article by
 on,  You see, sir, most of the population
 oes not have the faintest idea that you and
 snator GRUENING vehemently denounce our
 current policy  in Viet n_ am.  Thus, if you
 were to write, an article ,for the publication,
 even more people might join in your plea
 for peace.
 Personally, sir, it appears that Leonid
 Brezhnev is to be commended for being as
 patient with us as he has been.  No doubt
 if Russia tried something in South America
 similar to what we are trying in Vietnam,
 we would already have been through a nu-
 clear war by now.
 Sir, please keep up your fight against the
 inanities of war.  Muncie's population is well
 represented in the Birch Society, and nearly`
 every day one reads letters to the editor of
 the Press that apparently are trying to fo-
 ment another Red scare and which demand
 escalation, escalation, and more escalation.
 If you were to write a letter, even a long one,
 to the Muncie Evening Press, Muncie, Ind.,
 giving your views on Vietnam, the writer
 Is certain that it would be published in full.
 Sir, if you would be so kind as to do that,
 then  people  around  here  who  seemingly
 have not even heard of the word "negotia-
 tion" would be able to at least see, though
 perhaps not agree with, another point of
 view.
 Congratulations, sir, for having the cour-
 age to take an unpopular stand on this cru-
 cial issue.  Thousands will remember you as
 a man who did all in his power to avert
 World  War  III.  The  remaining  millions,
 perhaps, while the earth is burning around
 them, will be consoled to know in their hearts
 that they were furthering 100 percent true-

 situation in the south and only earns us
 bitter hatred around the world.
 The use of nauseas gas, napalm, the new

 P.S.-We are enclosing the copy of a letter
 we've sent to President Johnson.
 NEW YORK CITY, N.Y.,
 March 29, 1965.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I am writing to you
 to express my shock, indignation, and sur-
 prise at the U.S. Government's actions in
 Vietnam.
 Not only is the policy we are following im-
 moral in nature, but worse yet, it appears
 to be reckless and self-defeating politically.
 If, as you stated on March 25, we "seek no
 more than a return to the 1954 Geneva agree-
 ments," then why have we been consistently
 rebuffing General De Gaulle who for the past
 2 years has been urging us to seek a nego-
 tiated solution on this very basis?
 Why is our Government still listening to
 thouse who in 1965 are evoking the specter
 of "Munich," which took place in 1938 at the
 time of England's extreme weakness and has
 no relevance to the relationship of forces as
 it exists today?
 Why do we discard without explanation
 Mr. UThant's advice?  He spoke to us not
 only as the Secretary General of the U.N.,
 but as a Burmese citizen whose country has
 been experiencing serious problems of civil
 strife?  Yet,  despite her very long border
 with China and lack of U.S. military aid,
 Burma remains non-Communist and main-
 tains                                                                                                                                          good relations  with  her  neighbors.
 Are the opinions of Burma, Cambodia, Af.,
 ghanistan, Ceylon, Nepal, India, and even of
 allied nations like Pakistan and Japan to be
 dismissed without as much as an explana-
 tion?                                                                                                                                          Aren't these the very countries we are
 trying to protect?
 Why, inasmuch as the Hanoi government is
 desperately trying not to  become  China's
 satellite, do we feel it incumbent upon us
 to push  it further into  China's  arms by
 threatening it with extinction?
 Perhaps the central cause of the danger
 in Vietnam is not so much the aggression
 .by Communists, but our refusal to see the

 events, there in any other way and the in-
 ability to change our own habits of think-
 ing, when it comes to our relations with
 China?  The purpose of our policy was to
 isolate China; instead we are isolating our-
 selves as the proceedings at the U.N. and
 our lonely role in Vietnam prove.
 How can we reconcile our claims to moral
 leadership and your own pledges of "seeking
 a reduction of tensions" with General Tay-
 lor's alarming comment that "there are no
 limits to escalation; the pressure stops when
 the enemy gives in."
 We are no doubt sincere in our belief that
 we are fighting communism, not realizing of
 course that what we are really fighting Is our
 own policy of trying to improve relations
 between all nations and of trying to promote
 some sort  of  stability  in this  dangerous
 world.
 How can a religiously moral people ignore
 repeated appeals by the Pope and Protest-
 ant leaders and continue to rationalize our
 destructive policy?
 It has been said that the Communists
 show no interest In negotiations.  However,
 inasmuch as there were indications to the
 contrary, prior to our attacks on North Viet-
 nam, should not the cessation of these at-
 tacks be the logical prerequisite to any
 meaningful exploration of diplomatic alter-
 natives?
 We have to realize that not only the Com-
 munist side but both sides have a great deal
 to lose from the extension of this conflict
 and act accordingly.
 Yours truly,
 ANATOL KOVARSKY.
 P.S.-One is amazed to read that people
 like General Taylor and Mr. H. Cabot Lodge
 are still advising our Government.  What-
 ever their competence  in their respective
 fields, their advice on Vietnam has led from
 one disaster to another. -

 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. JOHNSON:     First, we bombed a
 schoolhouse with children in it, causing the
 deaths of  40  youngsters.  Then we  at-
 tacked civilians with poison gas.  Now, as if
 we had not done enough to "preserve democ-
 racy" in Vietnam, we are resorting to burn-
 ing the jungles with fire bombs and. fuel oil,
 killing people, animals, and vegetation.
 The bombing of our Embassy in Saigon
 was tragic.  It is, however, exactly what we
 must expect when we help military dictator-
 ship suppress its  own  population.   How
 much longer must Americans, Asians, and
 wildlife perish to support tyranny?
 Are we staying in Vietnam to save face?
 My God, man, who cares about prestige when
 hundreds of innocent people are dying every
 day.  Who  cares  what  the  world    thinks
 when Vietnam is being torn apart by     fire
 bombs,  tanks, rockets, and littered with
 broken bodies and charred ruins of villages
 and cities?
 Mr. Johnson, our Vietnam policy is totally
 without   justification,   commonsense,   or
 reason. It is criminal and hateful for the
 United States to be engaged in such crimes
 against humanity. The Nazis resorted to any
 means  to prevail over their   victims;  the
 United States is doing the same thing when
 it murders children, gasses civilians, burns
 jungle,  wildlife,  and  men,  and  supports
 tyranny.
 What more can I say?  I am opposed to
 your policy (not ours, since most New Eng-
 landers with whom I have spoken deplore
 your policy).    I doubt that it will change
 until you have succeeded in drawing China
 into the conflict, and have  seen millions
 of people die.  What, Mr. Johnson, will be
 left?  And, why?

 MR.  PRESIDENT:  We  share         your  anxiety
 about the dangerous situation in Vietnam
 and are fully aware of the tremendous dif-
 ficulties confronting you in deciding on a
 policy which will bring peace and security to
 the entire area of southeast Asia.       As citi-
 zens of this country we cannot help being
 obsessed by grave doubts regarding the role
 of our country in the Vietnamese war.  We
 sincerely believe that force and destruction
 will only strengthen the forces we are trying
 to destroy, a fact vividly illustrated by the
 experiences of the French in the same area.
 Mr. President, we believe that immediate
 steps should be taken to stop shooting and to
 start talking.  The offers of negotiations
 made by Mr. U Thant should be accepted,
 even those of De Gaulle and of our other
 friends should be sincerely considered.  The
 civilian leaders of all factions of Vietnam
 should be given a chance to meet with our
 civilian representatives and, with our fullest
 cooperation, to meet with each other in order
 to form a provisional government represent-
 ing the people of Vietnamat the conference
 table.
 If only a small percentage of the money'
 spent for war in Vietnam would be diverted
 to efforts for peace, the honor of our coun-
 try and the freedom of Vietnam could be
 advanced immeasurably.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: We urge you to exert
 your considerable power to check the esca-
 lating war in Vietnam.
 We believe that this peace cannot be won
 on  the battlefield,  but must come about
 through negotiation, and preferably under
 the auspices of the U.N.
 We fail to see the rhyme or reason to our
 policy on Vietnam, and on the contrary are
 struck by inconsistencies, vague assump-
 tions, and unfortunately inhumanities that
 we attribute to the Vietcong.

 HONORABLE SIR: As all decent people must
 be, I am aghast at the wanton disregard for
 human  life  evidenced  by  our  country's
 actions in Vietnam, which are leading to
 world war.
 The only ray of hope for the salvation of
 mankind is the courageous fight you arc
 conducting in opposition to the madness of
 the administration.

 Crease your endeavors to

 On the contrary, I strongly feel that In
 this Way we are only playing into the hands

 We feel reassured, that the Russians did not
 interfere up until now, but could it be that
 in the back of their mind they are thinking
 "give them enough rope, etc."?
 As I, see it, we will never be able to stop
 communism on the ruins of a devastated
 and underdeveloped Asian country, especially
 where these ruins are for a great deal caused
 by our own intervention.

 DEAR ME. SENATOR: Your stand on the Viet-

 I take the liberty enclosing copy of my
 today's letter to the President, which may
 Interest you.
 Respectfully,
 PETER PRINS.
 SPARTA, N.J.,
 April 1, 1965.
 To TH&PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I doubt whether you
 will be able to read this letter yourself, be-
 cause you must be extremely busy.
 Nevertheless I take the liberty to give my
 views on the Vietnam situation.
 I strongly feel that our policy in Vietnam
 is completely wrong and utterly deplorable.
 In this respect I admire people like Sena-
 tor WAYNE MORSE, Senator RIBICOFF, the Sen-
 atcr from Alaska (I think it was Senator
 GRUENING)   Walter Lippmann, and others,
 who, have the courage to express their views
 freely; warning of the dangers confronting
 us, and the, moral angle of the case.
 I have the feeling that people in the United
 States are not fully informed about develop-
 ments in Vietnam and about the real feel-
 ings of the majority of the people over there,
 who wantus to leave them alone.
 On-the other band it seems that the Amer-
 ican press Is more or less influenced by
 Washington.
 We have always abhored this policy in the
 Communist bloc, and it should certainly not
 be allowed in a great democracy like ours.
 In this respect I applaud programs like
 yesterday's "Changing World" on TV chan-
 nel 13.
 We all know that the popularity of the
 United States has gone downhill pretty fast
 in the world during the last years, which is
 regrettable and not always justified.
 Our policy in Vietnam, however, is adding
 fuel to this consumptive fire, and will be
 felt for years to come.              .
 Even a great nation like ours, can never
 stand alone in this world, especially economi-
 cally.,
 Sure, there are countries who are friendly
 towxrd,,j; ,, but we may never lose sight of
 the fact that their attitude is often influ-
 enCec by financial support we give them.
 It we really want to be a leader of the
 Western world, we should give moral lead-
 ership.
 What .we are doing in Vietnam is not a
 Let us not fool ourselves by saying "we
 cannot pull out now without losing face,"
 because as the Senator from Alaska said these
 days: "more setbacks are still to come."
 Please, do not consider this. a negative
 attitude.
 We have to face the naked fact that, apart
 from the moral angle, the struggle in the
 swamps of Vietnam is not our type of war,
 and will downgrade the image of the Ameri-
 can eagle still further.
 Respectfully,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR  MORSE: I heartily approve
 your efforts to stop the war in Vietnam.  I
 believe firmly in a negotiated peace and I
 have written to President Johnson and other
 Senators.
 Sincerely yours,
 NEW YORK, N.Y.,
 March 31, 1965.
 DEAR      SENATOR     MORSE: I wish to register
 my support for the positions you have stated
 In public concerning the present policy of
 the U.S. Government with respect to the Viet-
 nam situation.  There seems to me no doubt
 that the present unilateral action of the
 United States poses a threat to world peace.
 Any thought that military action is going
 to change what is a political issue appears
 simplistic to say the least.  As a physician
 and psychiatrist I am much more concerned
 with the possibility of saving human lives-
 Americans and Vietnamese-than with prov-
 ing points of dubious principle.  The issues
 presented by the administration as justify-
 ing their intervention in Vietnamese affairs
 do not appear warranted by the facts.  The
 American people are being asked to defend
 an allegedly anti-Communist regime against
 an alleged threat of Communist domination.
 There is little evidence that any of the gov-
 ernments of South Vietnam enjoy any meas-
 ure of public support-there is inadequate
 evidence that the Vietcong is actually con-
 trolled from Hanoi.   There is, on the the
 other hand, considerable evidence that South

 that or any other decision.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  Congratulations on
 your right and eloquent attack on the cur-
 rent U.S. policy in Vietnam.
 There is widespread support for those-un-
 fortunately-few Senators who are talking
 sense about the blundering, illegal, destruc-
 tive, criminal, and atrocious U.S. military in-
 tervention in Vietnam.
 Eventually, you and  GRUENING  and the
 others will be proved right. Something must
 be done soon, before we permanently alienate
 all of Asia.
 I am informing President Johnson of my
 concern.  In continuing and extending the
 American war in Vietnam, he must be rely-
 ing on evil counsel.  I trust the President has
 not lost his mind.
 I want my country to do the right thing-
 also the sensible thing.
 We must get out of Vietnam now.
 Keep up the attack.

 sorrow, resentment, and alienation from this

 course of action.  I am sad that the Govern-
 ment should be deluded with a sense of self-

 alienated to an extent that I would sit in

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have been a teacher
 and occupational therapist for the past 15
 years having worked with the disabled in-
 cluding the disabled veteran and I am dis-
 turbed about the situation in Vietnam as one
 issue that must be arrested, if at all possible,
 for better solution for world peace.
 I am strictly opposed to the decisions and
 actions to allow the U.S. troops to engage
 in combat in this country of Vietnam to say
 nothing of the use of gas warfare.  This is a
 definite act of aggression by the United
 States and should immediately cease.
 As a member of the Women for Peace
 of Oakland and the First Unitarian Church
 of Berkeley, Calif., I will continue to give
 my wholehearted support to proselytize for
 cease-fire and withdrawal of the U.S. troops
 promptly.

 just one sheet, but two or three saying the
 same things in a different arrangement.  If
 we read it often enough are we supposed to
 believe it?
 This solid front propaganda is deeply dis-
 turbing to me, apart from the fact of half-
 truths and lies: It is handed out like the
 party line for all good comrades to read,
 swallow, and repeat.  I think that Washing-
 ton should be aware that the elections last
 November clearly went against this way of
 doing  things  (it's  the  Birch  way),  and
 against the belligerence in Vietnam advo-
 cated by Barry Goldwater.                                                                             Do we have a
 two-party system or don't we?     If we are
 a free country, why can't we get what we
 voted for, not what we voted against?
 The Office of Public Disservice of the Bu-
 reau of Public Affairs, Department of State,
 tells me that "at this time, no issue com-
 mands more of the time, energy, and atten-
 tion. of the President and his senior advisors
 (than Vietnam)."  Perhaps they should be
 spending more time, energy, and attention
 on what we the people voted for. Then they
 might find that Vietnam solved itself quite
 easily.
 Peace Is "face" enough.

 I hope you are no longer a lone voice cry-
 ing in the wilderness in the Senate.   We
 need more courageous leaders like you and
 Senator FULBRIGHT.
 My cousin, who lives outside of Boston,
 wrote me that she had just heard you speak
 and that you said you had been told in brief-
 ings that the United States hopes to bomb
 Chinese nuclear bases in 90 to 120 days.  Is
 this true?  If it is, how terrifying.  Are we
 inviting a nuclear war?  Where is our com-
 passion?                                                                                                                                       Where is our integrity?    And we
 claim to be a Christian nation.
 Is there anything we can do to help change
 our unimaginative foreign policy other than
 writing to our Representatives?
 The irony of our present foreign policy it
 Vietnam is that it is so staunchly backed b}
 the Dirksens and Goldwaters.
 I hope every Senator has read Normal
 Cousin's editorial in the March 27 Saturda
 Review.
 We seem to be going through an interna
 tional McCarthyism today with our fear c
 communism  making  us  perform  wit
 totalitarian  tactics. Haven't  we learne
 that war doesn't stop the spreading of a
 ideology?
 But this is more dangerous because we a7

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE :1 am quite disturbed
 about the war situation in Vietnam.  I be-
 lieve we should pull out of there one way or
 another.
 If we should get in a war with China, I am
 told they could march a line six men wide
 and unarmed from now on and still if we
 killed them as fast as they walk in, that their
 population would not decrease. I think that
 they would welcome anything that would
 destroy about 50 to 100 million Chinese.
 In my opinion, we have no chance what-
 ever of winning a wax that close to China
 unless we should go in immediately with
 atomic bombs and I think that would be too
 risky, for Russia would no doubt bomb us out
 as soon as we have weakened.
 At the rate we are going, this country will
 soon go bankrupt and all the fine things we
 have fought for, produced, and developed
 will go to naught.
 Please use your great influence to get this
 trouble settled.

 DEAR SIR: Keep up the fight to stop the

 and so are some others in this town.  They
 had a peace march, 40 people, and all were
 arrested for parading without a permit, but
 today, because of the pressure, the judge
 threw the case out of court.  I am wonder -
 ing what can be done by me, or just the little
 people.  Writing letters to our Congressmen
 and the President don't phase them, they
 don't even have the courtesy to answer.
 My hat is off to the pastor who is re-
 fusing to pay his income tax because the
 money is being used to fight a war.  He can
 do this and I know that if enough of us
 did this the war would stop overnight.  It
 is impossible for some whose employer has to
 withhold ours.  For us we have no choice.
 Maybe we can figure out some way to help
 you in your uphill fight.  Our town paper

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I send this letter to
 express my concern and dismay over the war
 that is presently being fought in South Viet-
 nam.  There is no question that we are pre-
 sently engaged in a war in Vietnam which
 is being escalated at a frightening pace.  It
 is a war without purpose or meaning.      The
 Vietnamese people do not wish us to be there.
 South Vietnam has no strategic military im-
 portance to us and there is every possibility
 that a compromise government can be estab-
 lished in Vietnam which in time will act im-
 dependently of the Chinese Government.
 I personally know of no one who wants thi
 war.  Therefore, it seems to me, that re
 sponsible representatives of the people an(
 leaders in Government must put a halt t
 this senseless slaughter.

 If I may, I would like to take exception to          Sincerely yours,
 several points raised in your analysis.  The
 Vietcong insurgency was never, from its in-
 ception, an internal revolt.  It is and has
 been an effort closely coordinated, directed
 and supported from Hanoi and further sup-
 ported by Peiping.  Therefore, we ' did not
 enter wrongly into an internal struggle, but
 entered legitimately,' because  the  govern-
 ment of South Vietnam asked for our help
 in burn#ng back a threat to the freedom and
 sovereignty of the Republic of Vietnam. The
 Communists have described the Vietcong
 effort as "a holy war of national liberation
 that will be a test case for other underde-
 veloped areas."  To allow such an effort to
 go unchecked would be to open up the en-
 tire area of Southeast Asia to similar aggres-
 sion and, eventually, other areas in Africa
 and Latin America.  Our dedication to the
 principles of freedom and our concern for
 the fate of the free world demanded our
 presence.

 BARRY-L.B.J.'s MILITARY MENTOR
 During the presidential campaign of last
 fall, the Republican candidate for President,
 Senator Barry Goldwater, was roundly casti-
 gated by his political enemies as an irrespon-
 sible                   warmonger-largely  because  of  the
 views the Senator expressed on the Vietnam
 struggle.
 It might be well now to review a few of
 the more extreme positions held by the Sen-
 ator during that campaign.
 We recall Mr. Goldwater suggested that
 perhaps the staging areas for North Viet-
 namese troops in neutral Laos might be
 bombed.  Subsequent to November, Presi-
 dent Johnson has bombed them repeatedly.
 Senator Goldwater further suggested that
 perhaps carrying the war to North Vietnam
 might serve to induce Hanoi to end its aid
 and direction of the fighting in the South.
 Since November, President Johnson has ini-
 tiated the bombing of North 'Vietnam, not
 just as retaliatory raids for Vietcong blows
 against American installations, but as a set
 policy, the purpose of which is to induce
 Hanoi to desist its support of the war.
 Senator Goldwater suggested that it might
 be beneficial from a military standpoint if
 America undertook to defoliate areas where
 trees and shrubbery protected the guerrillas
 from air assault.
 Now comes word from South Vietnam that
 a large forest northwest of Saigon, which pro-
 vides a canopy of cover for the Vietcong, has
 been the target of chemical defoliation, to
 leave the forest dry and dead.  Yesterday
 that forest was set ablaze by Air Force planes.
 The purpose: Nothing if not defoliation.
 To find out what the administration plans
 to do next in Vietnam we suggest rummaging
 through Senator Goldwater's old speeches.
 How 1962 CIA SUGAR SABOTAGE WAS NULLI-
 FIED---PRESIDENT  KENNEDY  ACTED  To  DE-
 TAIN SOVIET-BOUND CARGO
 (By Max Frankel)
 WASHINGTON, march 26. Discussions here
 about the use of nausea gas in Vietnam have
 brought to light the story of an ingenious
 scheme by which the White House once nul-
 lified the use of a different kind of chemical
 agent on some Soviet-bound sugar.
 It is the story of how former President
 John F. Kennedy outraged the Soviet Gov-
 ernment by conspiring in the detention of
 a British ship with cargo from Cuba in order
 to undo a successful sabotage operation of
 the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The Caribbean melodrama involved mys-
 terious shipboard fires and hijacked sacks of
 sugar, court battles, and angry diplomatic
 messages, all against the background of the
 Cuba missile crisis.
 The story, 30 months old, is not ended.
 At least one attorney in Puerto Rico still is
 being sued by Moscow for damages,
 The story has no direct relationship to
 gas  and Vietnam,  but  sources have been
 recalling it as they talk about the various
 unorthodox weapons that occasionally pose
 special problems for Washington.
 It began on August 22, 1962, when the
 British freighter Streatham Hill, under lease
 to a Soviet agency, limped into San Juan
 harbor, Puerto Rico, for emergency repairs
 after it had damaged its propeller on a reef.
 The 7130-ton vessel was carrying 80,000 sacks
 of Cuban sugar to the Soviet Union on one
 of the  then  regular commercial  runs  by
 Western ships that were infuriating the Ken-
 nedy administration.
 Of the sugar aboard, 14,135 bags came
 ashore,      allegedly  unloaded to permit  the
 making of repairs.  The bags of sugar were
 placed in bond in a customs house, because
 Cuban products could not be imported Into
 the United States.
 As the freighter lay in port for several
 weeks, either before or after some of its cargo
 was taken ashore, one or more agents of the
 United States managed to get to some of the
 sugar to apply a substance that would spoil
 its taste and usefulness.  It is said to have
 been an essentially harmless substance, not
 likely to inflict injury, but certain to arouse
 serious dissatisfaction among Soviet  con-
 sumers.
 How many sacks were tampered with is
 not  known,  but subsequent developments
 indicate that most It not all of the adulter-
 ated sugar was among the sacks in the ware-
 house.
 The purpose of this chemical sabotage is
 said to have been manifold: to damage an
 expensive cargo; to rouse Soviet suspicions
 about the quality of Cuban sugar; to create
 discord between Soviet and Cuban authori-
 ties                                                                  and,  possibly,  to discourage shippers
 from providing services that were likely to
 lead to disputes, recriminations, and perhaps
 even suspicions of sabotage.
 KENNEDY ANGERED BY PLOT
 The operation appeared to have been a
 success and the Streatham Hill was prepar-
 ing to reclaim the doctored sugar and resume
 its journey on September 19 when President
 Kennedy learned of the sabotage.  He. is said
 to have been angered by the plot and fearful
 not only of injury to Soviet consumers but
 also of setting a dreadful precedent in chem-
 ical sabotage.
 In early September, therefore, the order
 went  out  from  Washington:  The  con-
 taminated sugar must not leave U.S. terri-
 tory. Intelligence agents, harbor authorities,
 customs officials, and Government attorneys
 were put on the job and thus began the in-
 trigue to undo intrigue.
 How it was done is clear from,, the recol-
 lection of sources here, in San Juan, and
 Miami and news reports at the time. Exactly
 who played what role could not be. learned.
 On September 18, Terry Kane and some
 associates from Miami appeared in the Su-
 perior Court of Puerto Rico to contend that
 the  sugar  in  the -warehouse  belonged  to
 Cuba and ought to be seized as compensa-
 tion for the Cuban Government's debt to
 them.
 A year earlier, they had obtained a judg-
 ment in a Dade County court in Florida that
 Premier Fidel Castro's regime owed them
 $833,978 for the seizure of a farm machinery
 business in Havana.
 WRIT OF ATTACHMENT
 Kane said it was his own idea to go after
 the sugar in San Juan.  What encourage-
 ment he had from Washington is not clear
 but on September 19, just as the Streatham
 Hill was about to reload its cargo and de-
 part, court records show, the Puerto Rican
 court issued a writ of attachment against the
 sugar in the warehouse.
 The next day, with the freighter still in
 drydock, the remaining sugar on board wits
 ordered impounded and held for a possible
 settlement of the debts due Kane and asso-
 ciates.
 Apparently  President  Kennedy's  orders
 had then been carried out. A long series of
 diplomatic and court bouts followed.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  I believe it is tim
 for all countries to consider the needs of in
 dividuals within other countries before fm
 posing a foreign will upon them.  Only
 country whose citizens are well fed and we
 educated, morally and economically strop
 can approach international crises with suc
 humanitarianism.  No country measures u
 to those standards as well as our Unite
 States of America.
 For that reason, I must protest our tour
 try's intervention in Vietnam.  It is tin
 for the Vietnamese people to be united an
 to learn self-government without ouside ir.
 terference.  This can only be done if all foi
 eign elements leave Vietnam immediatel;
 Our presence in that country is a detrimer.
 to the health, welfare and future growth c
 all concerned, and can only result in hatro
 and international chaos.
 I appreciate your efforts on behalf of th
 people of this country to seek an expedien
 and peaceful solution to the Vietnam crises
 and I hope that you and other Members of
 the Senate will continue to move in that di-
 rection as long as it is necessary.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Enclosed is a carbon
 of a letter I sent to Senator FuLBRIGHT.   I
 thought that because of your own forthright
 stand in the Vietnam matter you might be
 interested in the activities of the group dis-
 cussed in the letter-a group which has made
 one of its main purposes the pushing of a
 hard  line in  cold war  policy.   Especially
 alarming, of course, is the fact that impor-
 tant public figures, including our Secretary
 of State, appear to be lending their prestige
 to this group.

 of knowledgeable Americans agree with you
 and are horrified at the measures being taken
 by this Government. I feel that those sur-

 Iir.   Please continue to fight.  Can you
 think of ways that the hundreds of Ameri-

 nake their objections count?  Already the

 BROOKLYN, N.Y.,
 April 1, 1965.
 Senator WAYNE L. MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I fervently endorse
 your position for negotiations for ending the
 war in Vietnam.  I think that the time has
 come for us to stop talking about saving
 face and to start talking about saving lives.
 Men cannot resolve differing ideologies by
 plunder or mass murder-that can only lead
 to heavy loss of life, property, and esteem on
 both sides.  And in the end, nothing perma-
 nent, i.e., this homogeneous ideology, can be
 effected.   In addition, we  are losing face
 among our allies and other free nations Of
 the world for our current "walk softly, carry-
 ing a big stick" policies.
 It would seem self-evident that people
 would  realize  that  nuclear  war-and  the
 threat increases every hour, every day-would
 be disastrous. Indeed, it would be annihilat-
 ing, for as there is no such thing as one drink
 for an alcoholic, there. is no such thing as a
 localized war.  The way things are develop-
 ing now, it is almost a matter of time before
 this universal dread becomes a reality.
 I repeat, I heartily endorse your policies
 and hope that as a strong voice in our Gov-
 ernment, you can somehow further make
 clear the need for negotiations.  Are we, in
 the final analysis, a nation of mice or men?
 Is our hoped for Great Society all for naught?
 Must we throw sticks and stones like chil-
 dren at play (albeit, alas, we are not at play)
 or can we sit down at the conference table
 and discuss our fundamental differences?
 I have just turned 21, and am looking for-
 ward to legally adding my voice to govern-
 mental policies, I shall vote, not for the war
 for destruction, but for peace.
 Sincerely yours,
 ELLEN- GARDINER.
 SCARSDALE, N.Y.,
 March 31, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:               As  a former west
 coast resident, perhaps I can get your ear.
 Please do not cease in asking that the
 United States heed world opinion, U Thant,
 and Pope Paul- and stop bypassing the U.N.
 in Vietnam.
 Thank you for being a voice of moral in-
 tegrity over the years.
 What  "democracy"  are  American  boys
 fighting for in Vietnam.  I'm ashamed that
 we are tearing up that country with bomb-
 ings.                                                                    We should use the U.N to develop the
 Mekong Valley; thus help them achieve a
 stable government.  This isn't giving them
 a stable government.  I feel my country is
 betraying its humanitarian ideals.  1984 is
 indeed here, if all contrary opinion is silenced
 by Johnson, as it indeed seems to be.
 He has been so fine on Alabama, I'm dis-
 traught that his international advisers have
 been so military in the old-fashioned pre-
 nuclear sense.
 I voted against Goldwater because of his
 warlike stance; but now Johnson is doing
 precisely what the electorate repudiated.
 BEVERLY NYGREEN.
 SCIENTIST OPPOSES WAR
 WOODS HOLE, MASS,
 March 24,1965.
 To the EDITOR:
 In the last election we scientists stood as
 one man behind President Johnson, being
 afraid of what Mr. Goldwater, as President,
 might do.  Now President Johnson does in
 Vietnam what we feared.  He made no prom-
 ises to us scientists.  Nevertheless, I feel dis-
 appointed, alienated, if not betrayed.  I am
 sure many of my fellow scientists feel as I
 do.  We are deeply concerned because it was
 our work which opened the way both to a
 better future for mankind or its final catas-
 trophe.  We are going the wrong way, and it
 is time for scientists to get together once
 more, this time to sound a warning.
 As an American I am deeply concerned
 also because this is more than a war.  It if
 a moral issue  from which  we  can     onl?
 emerge  with  our  name badly  tarnished
 Even victory must mean a defeat.  The ad
 ministration.'s policy is contrary to the prir
 ciples for which  this  country has alwa:
 stood:.  If a war can be conducted, our trea
 urea spent on it, our boys taken to far-(
 countries to kill and be killed, all witho
 asking the people or their representativ
 then democracy becomes a hollow word.
 The great majority of the American peo]
 is opposed to this war that also scuttles f
 U.N., on which mankind pinned its hoi
 and which we promised to support.

 U.S. Senate,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I endorse your pl

 I do not believe the issues involved
 such as to require U.S. participation In
 actual fighting.  I hope you will contil
 to work for immediate withdrawal of i
 forces.
 Sincerely yours,
 A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIT
 STATES
 DEAR  MR.  PRESIDENT:  Last November
 cast our vote for you because we were alarm
 by the war policies of Barry Goldwater.
 Today we find your administration is,
 Vietnam, following the very policies we votc
 to reject.
 All this in the name of "freedom."
 Freedom for whom?  There has never bee
 a free election in South Vietnam.  The Viet
 namese people do not support the "24 hour
 governments imposed on them by militar,
 coups.  They want an end to this fratricida
 war.
 The bombings of North Vietnam and tht
 landing of the Marines in South Vietnar,
 constitute an open invitation to world wa.
 We join with Pope Paul VI and U.N. Sec
 retary General U Thant in urging:
 An immediate cease fire in Vietnam.
 A conference of all nations to negotiat
 peace.
 What you can do to stop the war in Vie

 April 21, 1965           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 Am taking the liberty to send copies of
 this letter to you.  My reason for doing so is
 because from Reading the papers I get the
 idea that the"thinking of you four distin-
 guished gentlemen is not completely condi-
 tioned by the interests of the economic-mil-
 itary complex warned against by retiring
 President Eisenhower.  Am not sending the
 letter to the Senators from my own State.
 With them the ideas here expressed would
 likely fall on stony ground.
 My information is from the same source
 as that of the late and lamented Will Rog-
 ers.                    To me the situation in Vietnam is mad-
 ness.                    If we were to hire really smart men
 to .study the problem with the purpose of
 coming up with the worst plan for its so-
 lution-for the one most inhuman, most
 neatly completely against the public interest,
 the one most expensive and most danger-
 ous-could these said smart men find a worse
 way than that the United States has drifted
 Into, and into which it seems bent on drift-
 mg further?
 For one, like me who feels helpless against
 this dangerous trend, do any of you gentle-
 men have any suggestions?  Any informa-
 ,ion will be received with thanks.
 Yours truly,
 VIRGIL CONNER.

 DEAR SIR: I believe this trouble in Vietnam
 ihould be settled by conferences.
 Do what you can to get this done.  Please.
 y~                PESRUARY 24, 1965.
 HOI1. L. ..JOHNSON,
 President of the United States,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I think you are do-
 ing a good job.
 I realize that the State Department, the
 military, the CIA, and even the White House
 I ttzeif are oolor*d more or, less with the Dulles
 policy of overcommitment throughout the
 world. Even an able and conscientious loran
 like you, and a really good politician be-
 sides, will have to have some time to clean
 the mess out.
 Of course, being a small businessman in
 a country community, and having interests
 that coincide with the interests of nearly
 all the American people, I am for pulling the
 United  States  out of southeast Asia and
 using the money to start a new schoolhouse
 or student dormitory every day for the next
 year.  I suggest this in defense of freedom.
 Incidentally, I do not believe that the
 leaders of the Republican Party, nor any of
 the groups mentioned above are capable of
 making -decisions in the public interest.  I
 believe  any  decision  that  they influence
 would by that much be slanted contrary to
 the public interest.
 In a previous letter I told you I was born
 a Southern Democrat. The precinct in which
 I live and the one in which I have my office
 went for Johnson in a county that gave
 Goldwater 76 percent of the votes cast,  Of
 this I am proud.
 Yours very truly,
 VIRGIL H. CONNER.
 SYRACUSE. N.Y.,
 April 1, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I Wish to express my
 support for your stand on Vietnam.  I urge
 a cease-fire and conference to negotiate peace.
 .Sineerely yours,
 RUTH FLEISS.
 DEAR SENATOR: Maybe it would be a good
 idea for you and fellow Senators who are
 against what the United States is doing in
 Vietnam to call on the wife of the President
 and explain the situation to her.  Perhaps
 she will see the folly of the President's ad-
 visers and use her influence.  She ' looks to
 me as a woman with a lot of good common-
 sense.
 Sincerely,
 APRIL 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR: I am grateful for the effort
 you have made to get us out of this crazy,
 cruel war in Vietnam.  I read that 80 per-
 cent of American citizens are against it, too.
 Could you get a bill passed so that we peo-
 ple who foot the bills and bear the moral
 shame could have a plebiscite on war?
 More power to you.
 WILHELMINA TAGGART.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 The Capitol,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Allow me to add my
 name to your growing number of admirers.
 It is heartening to see that honor and dignity
 still exist (especially in the face of such over-
 whelming odds) in our Government.  Sir, I
 am speaking, of course, on your refusal to
 fall in line with the administration an the
 Vietnam question. Whether our policymakers
 have been seized with madness is hard to tell,
 but, more important, it remains within the
 power of persons such as yourself to make
 every effort to bring such shameful hypoc-
 risies into public view.  I am not too certain,
 that if the American people knew what was
 really going on in Vietnam, they would be
 willing to support our suicidal policies with
 such docility.
 Senator, I am almost sick with horror at
 the thought of such wholesale public irre-
 sponsibility.  The world saw the gathering
 clouds of two World Wars and, during all
 the months that preceeded both, nothing was
 done by any of the nations which could have
 done something.  The same situation exists
 today.  Britain complains with a weak voice.
 France does nothing, no one puts any pres-
 sure on our Government-which seems to be
 perfectly oblivious to any opinion Outside of
 the borders of the continental United States.
 When our own State Assemblyman John L.
 Burton took an initiative (he sent a letter of
 appeal  to  the  heads  of  state  in  Great
 Britain), he was shouted down in the San
 Francisco Chronicle-the most widely read
 daily in the bay area.  At the same time,
 this worthy journal of public information
 relegates news releases from Vietnam to mere
 one-column blurbs, while it titilates a sensa-
 tion-hungry public with front-page. scandal.
 Mr. Senator, what are we to do?  It is im-
 possible to surrender myself over to such
 stupidity and injustice.  Perhaps you know
 of some way in which I can direct my ener-
 gies so that I may do what I can to avert
 another senseless slaughter.  Certainly, let-
 ter writing is some help, but it is not enough.
 With the full realization that you are a very
 busy man, and that you may not be able to
 reply to me personally, I eagerly await your
 reply and possible suggestions.  Keep up the
 good work and count me on your side.
 Sincerely,
 .Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Oregon.
 DEAR SIR: I write you to encourage and
 support your position on Vietnam.  I think
 it's quite clear that the day we bomb Hanoi,
 the United States will be involved in a total
 war.  I cannot understand how our roads of
 suppression and exploitation of underdevel-
 oped areas can continue without an expres-
 sion of concern from the Congress.  And how
 can we be at war without the consent of
 All these questions and more continue to
 go  unanswered,  yet  Hanoi  approaches us
 7897
 quite rapidly.  Americanism begins to be a
 very dirty word around the world, and we
 know all too well, that our only allies are
 the fascist dictatorships and racist countries.
 Respectfully yours,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: We want to let you
 know that we are grateful for your honesty
 and integrity as shown by your position in the
 Senate in opposing our Government's policy
 in Vietnam.
 It is our concern that we will continue to
 have  outstanding  statesmen such as you
 speak forth on issues that affect the welfare
 of our country and the rest of the world.
 Let us know what we can do to help you.
 Sincerely,

 BENSON, ARIZ.,
 March 31, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR: I beg you to rise and make
 a major address denouncing our whole inde-
 cent adventure in Vietnam.  It is your duty
 since only you and Senator GRUENING seem
 to have the knowledge and the courage to say
 what the majority of Americans are think-
 ing and saying.
 Goldwater lost the election but Goldwater-
 ism goes clomping on in military boots.  It's
 the old story-first you build up a military
 force for defense then you use it for aggres-
 sion.
 You are one of my few long enduring heroes
 since I have for years followed your career.
 Congress is always hopelessly "dated" but
 I nearly always find you correct and stimu-
 lating.
 Please talk long and often and please de-
 nounce this war from the Senate floor.   I
 have written Johnson and HuMPHREY crying
 "shame."
 Sincerely,
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR: Enclosed please find a copy
 of a letter I have written to the President.  I
 hope it has not been an exercise in futility.
 I heard your speech at Johns Hopkins Uni-
 versity on March 15.  Thank you for your
 courage and effort to educate the public.          I
 only hope that you will continue to speak
 out against this Vietnam policy.

 nam.                                                                                                                                        I have read and heard your statements
 on the subject.  I am familiar with the last
 white paper released by the State Depart-
 ment.  I an} saturated with all the justifica-
 tions put forward by, our Defense Depart-
 ment, Members of Congress, and various and
 sundry advocates of this course.  But I also
 have researched the history of that area and
 our involvement there.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE           April 21, 1965
 What a tragic story it is: From the unen-
 lightened French colonial exploitation, to the
 rise of the nationalist movement under Ho
 Chi Minh, to the Japanese occupation, to the
 duplicity of the British General Gracey after
 World War II, to the vain efforts of the
 French and their duplicity in trying to re-
 place the yoke of colonialism on Vietnam by
 means of puppet regimes-yes, right down to
 our fanatical anticommunism as espoused
 and promulgated by John Foster Dulles.  His
 was the warped view of the world which put
 us into a struggle on the wrong side with the
 French and their puppets and it has been the
 political cowardice of three Presidents which
 has kept us there.
 I wonder if you, Mr. President, and the pol-
 icymakers ever bothered to read the history of
 the Vietnamese struggle to rid themselves of
 the exploitation of Western man.  If we had
 more historians and fewer CIA people and
 State  Department  "hard  nosers"  making
 policy we might not find ourselves the "last
 French colonialist in Indochina."
 I heard your press conference on Saturday
 March 20, and your reiteration of policy on
 Vietnam and I can only say that whether it
 was started 10 years ago or 110 years ago,
 whether it was the policy of 3 Presidents
 or 33 Presidents, and whether you repeat it
 47 times or 147 times-it still doesn't make it
 right.
 The people of this country do not support
 this hideous little war of napalm and massive
 bombardments and U.S. official propaganda,
 but they have become so intellectually le-
 thargic with affluence that they cannot bestir
 themselves to give loud voice to their dis-
 approval.   They assuage their consciences
 with the balm of anticommunism.
 Have we come to the point where anything
 is justifiable in the name of anticommunism?
 When I consider that after World War II
 and just prior to it's ending, Vietnam was a
 unified and independent nation from north-
 ernmost to southernmost boundaries-when
 I consider that Bao Dal had relinquished his
 throne in support of Ho Chi Minh and the
 Vietminh government and wrote De Gaulle
 asking that the French not persist in re-
 claiming these colonies; then I go on to find
 that the United States came into this strug-
 gle on the side of the French, then the Diem
 regime, and that it was officially stated pol-
 icy  during  Dulles'  secretaryship  to  back
 Diem's refusal to hold elections in accord
 with the 1954 Geneva agreements-that we
 built up Diem's army again in violation of
 the 1954  Geneva agreement-and now we
 have to listen to our officials saying that
 North Vietnam must show it's willingness to
 live up to those 1954 agreements- I can only
 say, what hypocrisy.  Why should the Viet-
 namese respect the artificial  17th parallel
 imposed on them by others, yes, even Russia
 and China along with the Western Powers.
 In closing let me say I am ashamed of my
 Government. I do not support the President.
 I believe we shall fail in this effort because
 we do not have right on our side.
 With regret,
 Mrs. CATHERINE L. MINK.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I would like to take
 this opportunity to congratulate you and
 urge you to continue your positive stand in-
 sofar as Vietnam is concerned.
 Although those of us who want a disen-
 gagement in Vietnam are in the minority
 we are growing each and every day.
 It is my personal thinking that we will
 be able to stop the war in Vietnam only if
 we act quickly, hard-headedly (in the sense
 that we seek peace) and together.
 The world is looking at southeast Asia
 today and so are many Americans.  We must
 show them that the present U.S. position
 in Vietnam can lead to nothing else but war
 unless and only if it is stopped now.
 You are to be commended for your stand
 and you have my continued -support and
 admiration.
 Sincerely,
 G. D. WIEBE.
 N.B -I am wondering if we could have a
 copy of the RECORD where you, according to
 the Saturday Evening Post, I believe, called
 the Vietnam fiasco McNamara's war?

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: The news of the last
 few days are most alarming.  What can a
 lone citizen do to express his fear and anger
 at the ever increasing war which our Gov-
 ernment is waging in South Vietnam?  It is
 wrong, terribly wrong.
 We are so fortunate to have you in the
 Senate and we beg you to continue your
 utmost efforts to arouse the American people
 to an understanding of what is really hap-
 pening.   Our Government is playing with
 high stakes.  The worst thing is that we may
 lose-if not already-control of our maneu-
 verings and find ourselves in an inextricable
 position escalating into a large terrible war.
 We support you-we beg you to continue
 your strong efforts and keep speaking out.
 Our gratitude to you.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  I'm a busy house-

 out to let you know how much I appreciate
 and respect you for speaking out against the
 terrible situation in Vietnam.
 It's wonderful to know that there are today
 in 1965 courageous men such as you, who are
 comparable to the few who spoke out 200
 years ago, and 100 years ago.
 I sincerely hope that you are receiving
 much mail  supporting your position and
 viewpoint on the Vietnam Issue.
 As you know, very little appears in print
 concerning those of us who don't support the
 administration on their Vietnam policy, so
 if you have any printed material available
 (speeches, et cetera), I would very much
 appreciate your sending me anything at all
 that I could use on radio programs such as
 "Voice  of  the  People,"  "Open  Mike,"  et
 cetera.
 Thank you very much for taking time to

 in Vietnam?

 DEAR, SENATOR   ,oRSE; I wanted to Write you
 short note exp"essing my appreciation at
 ir. existence,  It would seem that on the

 only honest man left in Washington.
 It you have the courage to pronounce
 obvious is one ray of light on a dark sea
 ties and abysmal stupidities which pass
 a Ll,S ?policy in Vietnam.
 have a heartfelt question: What can I
 to end my govern4nent's hopeless and
 gerous policy against the North Vietna-
 mese Government?  I have written to Sen-
 ator LAUSCHE, a' warhawk; to Congressman
 DEVINE,  almost as bad; to Senator YOUNG
 who is not quite so bad.  If there is some-
 thing more tell me. If you run for President
 I'll vote for you. Had not even one Senator
 raised his voice, I would be a sad man indeed.
 I would be very grateful for any informa-
 tion you might be able to send me on the
 subject of Vietnam policy.  Local papers and
 newscasts are understandably quite chary
 with meaningful Information.
 A gratified admirer,

 WATERTOWN, MASS.
 March 25,19-65.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Let me congratulate
 you and shake your hand for your coura-
 geous and unfailing stand on the Vietnam
 crisis and for your farsighted criticism of
 U.S. foreign policy.  I regret that, as a Mas-
 sachusetts  resident,  I  cannot  express  my
 fundamental beliefs at the ballot by voting
 for you.
 For years I have been frustrated while try-
 ing to understand how a great nation can tie
 itself down to untenable situations, assume
 without hesitation or a moment's thought,
 the role of setting things straight around
 the world and of policing and guiding other
 nations; or how people like McNamara, Tay-
 lor, Mr. McGeorge Bundy, and other able ad-
 ministrators do not hesitate to adopt brutal-
 ity in foreign policy and commit a great
 country to a cause utterly in opposition to
 its basic interests and to the concepts on
 which it was founded.
 The United States are not historically re-
 sponsible for what is happening in Asia or
 Africa.  Why should they be so eager  to
 shoulder the colonial heritage when the
 former colonial powers themselves, by force
 or reason, find it advantageous to adjust to
 the realities of the 1950's and 1960's? In
 order     to clear up  the  mess and fill the
 power vacuum?  But what mess and what
 vacuum?   No power vacuum can be filled
 from the outside and any such attempt smells
 very much like the old, cherished colonial
 policy tantamount to unrestricted interven-
 tion.                                                                                 Neither can the aim of scaring the
 Vietnamese into withdrawal be considered
 any more realistic or historically justified.
 Unlike individuals, nations, no matter how
 small, are very rarely scared when attacked,
 as evidenced by the valiant fight put up by
 Greece, Yugoslavia, Norway, etc., against the
 Nazi aggressors.
 Such policies have been ruled out and
 rendered ineffective by the realities of the
 nuclear age.  This  may be  frustrating  to
 certain  policymakers in  Washington,   who
 would rather change reality than their views,
 but the truth is that people the world over
 prefer to live, compete, and prosper rather
 than die for somebody else's frustrations. No
 amount of American force or anti-Commu-
 nist propaganda would persuade Africans or
 Asians to do otherwise.  As a matter of fact,
 some of them, and'I-mean Nasser, fioure,
 Ben Bella,  etc.,  are  resisting communism
 much more effectively than any American
 suggestion would have accomplished.
 Wishful thinking or the attitude of good-
 doing may produce some interesting plots in
 the movies  or  television, but the foreign
 policy of a great nation should be guided by
 far deeper and more realistic motives.  It
 often appears to me, however, that this is
 the only reason that can be offered, officially
 or  otherwise, in   support  of many recent
 Washington  policies.  The   overthrow  of
 Castro or Mao may seem to many a good
 cause to fight for, but none of them ever felt
 obligated to offer an alternative jo these
 established and organized states. Does any-
 body seriously believe that the United States
 has the answer to China's problems and can
 feed the Chinese millions after Mao's over-
 throw? 'Unless  the  U.S.  obligation  stops
 right there, after millions of dead and with-
 out any hope that a new and more fanatical
 Mao will not reappear in a few years.
 Another  incomprehensible  attitude, at
 least to me, is that of Senator F. CHURCH.
 He lost his voice as if the reasons for his
 initial criticisms have disappeared or ex-
 plained away.  If the explanation offered in
 Time magazine, that the President threat-
 ened withdrawal of his political support in
 the Senator's home State, is true, his silence
 seems even - more ominous to me.  If this
 kind of pressure can silence beliefs and con-
 victions of such fundamental importance to
 the interests of this country, I wonder about
 the strength of Senator CHURCH's convic-
 tions or his motivation in expressing them in
 the first place.  He did, in my opinion, a
 disservice to his initial beliefs by expressing
 them without being prepared to defend them
 vigorously.
 I would very much appreciate any litera-
 ture on your views and your general political
 philosophy that you would care to send.
 Respectfully,
 JOHN G. FIKIOUS.
 DEAR SIR: Today as I read my newspaper, I
 was stunned to learn that'the United States
 and South Vietnam are employing gas in
 this war.
 Lethal or not, I fail to see why we must use
 it with all the other types of weapons found
 in our arsenals.
 It appears to me that the "war" is being
 escalated while the administration says that
 it is not closing the doors to negotiation.  I
 can well understand that the President is
 waiting for the right moment to head for
 the tables but are they not pushing the date
 further into the future with this new tactic?
 And have we not given Hanoi, Peiping, and
 Moscow some great material for propaganda
 in this undeclared war?
 I hope you will write me and try to ex-
 plain what the administration is doing be-
 cause I cannot make heads or tails of it and
 especially this unwarranted and grossly non-
 humane mode of battle.
 Thanking you in advance, I remain,
 Faithfully yours,

 MY DEAR SENATOR: Would you send me a
 copy of your views and reasons for our with-
 drawal   from   Vietnam?  Our   aggression
 against South Vietnam is unforgivable.
 This should be handled by the only force
 with a jurisdictional right to arbitrate dis-
 putes.   The American taxpayers never gave
 any President a mandate to police the world.
 The U.N. must have its forces and power in-
 creased so it can deal with such messes as
 those in Vietnam and try to find what the
 Vietnamese want, not what the Pentagon
 thinks it should have.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. MORSE: It would give me great
 pleasure to be able to think that yours was
 not a voice in the congressional wilderness
 crying out against the policy of power-mad
 brutality and recklessness now being pur-
 sued by America in Vietnam.
 Are you alone In your clear-cut condem-
 nation?  Or is it simply a matter of the radio
 and press not reporting your unpopular
 views anymore, thereby proving your early
 contention, that 85 percent of the informa-
 tion was being withheld from the American
 people, correct in more ways than one?
 Since that statement of yours I only once
 more heard that you had said (in Tulsa,
 Okla.) that "the United States is waging an
 undeclared war in Vietnam, and this country
 is an aggressor Nation."
 I would certainly appreciate copies of any
 other  statements  you  have  undoubtedly
 made   (several copies, for distribution to
 friends).  For that matter of fact, if you
 know when and where Mr. Eisenhower ad-
 mitted that he "had never talked or corre-
 sponded with a person knowledgeable in
 Indochinese affairs who did. not agree that
 had election been held in 1954, possibly 80
 percent of the Vietnamesewould have voted
 for Ho Chi Minh," I would like to suggest
 that you have it entered Into the CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD.

 a rebroadcast of a speech you gave at Cooper
 Union  entitled  "That Mess  in  Vietnam."
 You gave one of the most helpful presenta-
 ' tions I have heard or read on the history
 and solution of our envolvement there.   I
 would like very much to have a copy of it,
 if this is still possible.
 Several people here would like to make our
 concern about U.S. action in. Vietnam felt in
 Washington.  Where do you think letters
 should best be sent?  We assume that we
 start with our President and our own Sena-

 We would also like to raise the issues for
 discussion in groups in our community.  If
 your speech is not available in quantities of
 50 to 100, can you suggest any other brief
 presentations which we could order to use
 as a background of reading before group

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I was sitting here at
 the typewriter when I heard your speech on
 the radio concerning Vietnam.  I was un-
 aware that any of our legislators were against
 the policy of the Government in Vietnam,
 and it does my heart good to know that you
 feel the way you do.  Of course, I might have
 known from your past record, but there has
 been so much silence from any opposition
 (either accidental or planned) that I thought
 that I was alone.     Then I heard Senator
 GEORGE MCGOVERN, of North Dakota, on "CBS
 Reports," and I wrote him commending him
 on his stand.
 He replied stating that he had received
 thousands of letters like mine.
 I would like to suggest, Senator, that the
 legislators who feel like you and Senator
 MCGOVERN, get together and speak to others.
 I am sure there are many who are either
 wavering, or afraid to speak out.
 I would like to have a copy of your speech.

 You are expressing the concept held, I
 feel, by the majority of U.S. citizens, not only
 in California, but across the Nation. How
 else was President Johnson elected by so
 overwhelming a vote?  The issue uppermost
 in the minds of the voters was, I believe, not
 so  much  race  relations,  educational aid,
 war against poverty, as it was the sharp de-
 markation between President Johnson's and
 Mr. Goldwater's foreign policy in regard to
 Vietnam.  Now that the former is firmly en-
 sconced is he about to be pressured into
 adopting Goldwater's stand?
 I voice the feelings of the mothers in my

 not (as yet) so much the knowledge that we
 have sons of military age as it is the horror of
 knowing that American bombers are wiping
 out  defenseless  jungle  villages,  maiming,
 blinding, and burning infants and children
 such as we have cradled and nursed.
 Why is this problem not placed before
 the U.N.?  Do we only refer crises to the
 U.N. If we are sure of a pro-United States
 decision?

 SIR: It is not surprising, but still reassur-

 you believe in.  Your stand for negotiations
 in Vietnam 'is something which I am sure
 has the support of most Americans.
 Thank you for your  courage  and  best
 wishes for your success.

 Now that the Department of State's v

 Once the United States was in the war,
 our allies in the Pacific were Chiang Kai-

 in half.  The'Pacific war lasted until August

 parts. Unfortunately  some  matters were
 left unclear.  Since the Bao Dai regime did
 not sign the agreementor even accept them,
 it can have no standing under them.  Ap-
 parently the French considered that they
 were still responsible for the region south
 of  the   17th  parallel   because Mend@s-
 France immediately airlifted reinforcements
 into the area and ordered two French divi-
 sions in Germany prepared for tropical serv-
 ice, at the- same time appointing Gen. Paul
 Ely High Commissioner.     The United States
 refused to sign the agreements but formally
 and solemnly promised to abide by them.
 This promise was not kept.
 A funny thing happened on the way to
 the  Geneva  agreements.   Ngo  Dinh  Diem
 suddenly replaces  Buu Luc  as   Bao Dai's
 Prime Minister.  There seems some question
 as to how he got into the act; Drew Pearson
 blames  it on  Francis      Cardinal Spellman.
 Bao Dai was persuaded to abdicate practi-
 cally all his powers to his new Premier and
 was restrained from returning to Vietnam
 from Europe, where he was waiting out the
 conference.  This was       accompanied by a
 strange campaign of denigration of Bao Dai
 in American newspapers which was some-
 thing less than deserved. A month after the
 agreements, the United States notified the
 French that all American military aid would
 henceforth go directly to the Indochinese
 native states (Laos, Cambodia, and Ngo Dinh
 Diem) instead of to the French as hitherto.
 In October President Eisenhower wrote his
 famous letter to Ngo Dinh Diem, now usually
 quoted as the foundation stone of the Amer-
 ican commitment to Vietnam of the south.
 It did, indeed, confirm Diem's status as a
 complete American puppet.  The suspicious
 French, not unreasonably, have always con-
 sidered these moves just the last steps in
 ousting them from Indochina with a view
 to replacing French control by American.
 In accordance with the agreements the
 Vietnam military withdrew north of the 17th
 parallel, but much of the area south of that
 line remained under Vietminh civil control.
 The new Saigon Government of Ngo Dinh
 Diem was dominated by the Central Viet-
 namese and the close to a million northern
 Vietnamese Catholics who flooded into the
 Saigon area and then on provided the hard
 core of Ngo Dinh Diem's political support.
 This Government hardly existed anywhere
 except in Saigon and the coast cities and
 certainly never gained the acquiescence, to
 say nothing of the affection, of much of the
 South Vietnamese  population.   Until  Oc-
 tober 1955 it functioned under the name of
 Bao Dei, but on that date a "popular refe.
 erendum" disposed of the latter; 5.7 million
 votes were alleged to have been cast, 88.8
 percent  for  Diem,  63,017  for Bao   Dai.
 Enough said.
 On April 26, 1955, the last of the French
 military left the country somewhat mitigat-
 ing the Franco-American hostility which had
 distinguished the last months of their stay.
 In July the deadline for the plebiscite which
 was to unite Vietnam under one govern-
 ment passed.  Diem refused  to  cooperate
 with the Vietminh in making arrangements
 for it on the grounds that his government
 was not signatory to the Geneva agreements.
 The real reason, of course, was that the
 Vietminh  was certain  to  win  in  a  free
 election.
 Instead of a plebiscite, Diem instituted a
 persecution.  This was aimed not only at
 the Vietminh pockets in central and South
 Vietnam but at a number of nationalist and
 religious groups who became the object of
 Diem's witchhunting and religious intoler-
 North Vietnamese Government was induced
 to take cognizance of its struggling southern
 compatriots.  More American missions, more
 American military help simply accelerated
 Diem's deterioration.  The appointment of
 Gen. Paul Harkins as head of a high com=mand for the Thailand-Vietnam theater sig-
 naled direct and patent American interven-

 tary and then murdered in November 1963;
 the nature and extent of American implica-
 tion- in Diem's political and physical extinc-
 tion is still something of a mystery.       -
 The 7 years of Ngo Dinh Diem's etoogery
 and the 18 months of his even less effective
 successors are a recital of the same story,
 perhaps at increasing tempo.  The American
 puppet regime, under whatever military or
 civil head, has been little more than the
 local government of Saigon, and nothing to
 boast about even in that function.  After $7
 billion, more than 300 Americans killed (not
 many, considering that the French  killed
 were 60,000, and the Vietnamese killed and
 homeless'must run into the millions or more)
 the southern part of Vietnam is a shambles
 and shows no signs of being anything else
 for a long time.  It is proposed to remedy
 this situation by reducing northern Vietnam
 to this same condition.
 In all of this it is difficult to find any of
 that "peace and freedom for Vietnam" with
 which Government officials are accustomed
 to  decorate  their  public  pronouncements.
 Quite the reverse.    While the first phase,
 the attempt to reestablish French rule, may
 be attributed largely to ignorance, the sec-
 ond, that of trying to get the Vietnamese to
 fight our undeclared war against China for
 us, is simply hoodlumism on an interna-
 tional scale.  This is especially heinous be-
 cause it has involved constantly recurring
 violations of our most solemn commitments
 under the United Nations Charter, a species
 of wickedness of which we are never hesitant
 to accuse other less-powerful nations.  One
 must feel very sorry for Americans who are
 proud of this record.
 Some facts stand out.  We were not, as
 Walter Lippmann suggests, "sucked into"
 (his words)  this situation in an innocent
 fit of absence of mind.   Surely there can
 hardly be a more premeditated, deliberate,
 intentional operation in all our history than
 Dulles' conversion of southern Vietnam into
 an American satrapy.  The Saigon Govern-
 ment is a purely American creation, estab-
 lished and maintained by American Armed
 Forces.  If it had been a good Government
 for its own people or even served some over-
 riding international purpose, one might find
 grounds for condoning its illegality, but it
 has done neither.  The Vietnamese Govern-
 ment of Hanoi, on the other hand, Whatever
 else may be said of it, is Vietnamese, and, if
 for no reason other than that it signed the
 Geneva agreements of  1954, has a greater
 claim to international legality than the for-
 eign-supported dissidents of the south.  If
 there is any reason for calling either side
 "rebel," the title should be awarded to the
 south.
 It should give us pause that no other sub-
 stantial nation shows such disposition to
 provide anything but token support to our
 Vietnam venture.  Only some assurance of
 moral rectitude, quite impossible to anyone
 who knows the facts, could make palatable
 the immense Asian hostility which our Viet-
 nam policy is engendering.  This is very
 sorry preparation for entering what promises
 to be an Asian century.
 President Johnson deserves all the sym-
 pathy and help anyone can give him in his
 ordeal of asking decisions with respect to as
 awesome problem bequeathed to him b;
 earlier   administrations.  This   sympath
 might well include a certain restraint in crit
 ical comment but it should not invoiv
 sweeping any facts under the rag.  Presider.
 Johnson's testy characterization of critics s
 people "who do not know the facts" hardl
 encourages such sympathy, for if American
 do not know the facts, the major blame rest
 upon the administration.  If the time h:
 come when Americans are supposed to a.
 quiesce in national policies ignorant of tl
 facts because the Government has shirked;
 responsibilities, we had better stop talki
 about our democracy.  The Department
 State's recent "Aggression from the Nort
 compounds  this  dereliction,  for  its  to
 do not support its argument.    It is, ind
 an insult to American Intelligence.      If
 sistance to one's compatriots struggling
 free themselves from an externally domino
 bad government is to be called aggress
 what name is to be given to the activitie
 25,000 foreign troops from half way are
 the world imposing that government?
 It Is in President Johnson's interest
 Americans should know all the facts,
 knowledge of the facts will determine
 spirit in which the search for an he
 able settlement is made.  If we go into n
 tiations in any spirit other than a sir.
 desire to redress two decades of wrong
 which we have as much responsibilit;
 anybody, and probably more, negotiat
 can  be  only    acrimonious  and  fruit
 President Johnson's main defense against
 resentment of his fellow citizens, and inc
 the rest of the world, at the unpalatable c
 lions which he has to make alone can onl
 more general knowledge that the probl
 he faces are none of his making.  If
 must be called seeking scapegoats so m
 the worse.
 Finally, it is folly to expect China to
 quiesce in  the  creation  of  hostile  st:
 on its borders; that day is over. We
 pride ourselves on our Monroe Doctrine
 the Americas are in now position to cavil
 a Chinese desire for a similar barrier to ext

 ment. But these are rights which the South
 Vietnamese Government, with U.S. support,
 has already taken away from the people of
 South Vietnam.  None of the governments
 of South Vietnam during the past 9 years
 has been representative of the wishes of the
 people, and none of them has been elected
 by a free democratic process. Human rights?
 We read accounts and see (color) pictures
 every day of the torture and murder of Viet-
 cong prisoners, of the involuntary relocation
 of peasants into strategic hamlets; of indis-
 criminate napalm bombing of entire villages
 which are suspected of harboring a few Viet-
 cong; of religious persecution; of arbitrary
 arrests, and bans on newspapers and political
 activities.
 Every day that we pursue the war in Viet-
 nam, we help convince them that we are
 ruthless and inhuman, and we make a mock-
 iry of our voiced concern for humanity and
 lemocracy.  Every day we stay in Vietnam,
 ve convince more Vietnamese that the Viet-
 ong are a lesser evil.
 If we had insisted on a true democracy
 then South Vietnam was created, if we had
 Lot supported the Diem dictatorship and its
 ruelty, corruption, persecution, and oppres-
 ion, if we did not support the recent "mu-
 ical  chairs"  succession  of  councils  and
 antas,  irregardless  of their concern for
 emocracy and humanity, then we might
 ave saved South Vietnam from the Com-
 iurilsts.
 It is much too late to deny the lessons
 hat the Vietnamese have learned at our
 Lands over the past years.  It is said that we
 nil lose prestige if we admit defeat.  Per-
 taps. 'But how much prestige will we lose
 f we continue to deny our defeat when the
 ituatign Is perfectly clear to the rest of the
 vorld?'We once loudly criticized the French
 'or pursuing a hopeless war in Indochina,
 snd now we pursue a hopeless war on- the
 same ground.
 It is unpleasant to lose a battle, but it
 is a virtue to realize that one has lost, and
 not compound the loss by attempting bull-
 headedly.to lose even more.  The lesson we
 must learn from Vietnam is the lesson we
 should have learned from Cuba: that if the
 United States supports corrupt and inhuman
 dictatorships because they are "anti-Commu-
 nist," then all the suffering and misery that
 exists under that dictatorship will bear the
 label of "democracy."  The people of that
 land will learn'to fear and hate us, and we
 will have made another opportunity for the
 Communists to convince them that they can
 offer something better. If we do not learn
 this lesson now, we shall have other oppor-
 tunities, when people rise up against the
 other dictators whom we now support.  If we
 refuse to learn this lesson, we will be forced,
 by our own stupidity, to lose again.  We can-
 not afford many more losses.  We must get
 out of Vietnam where we have already lost,
 and put our effort into places where we can
 still win by insisting on democracy and
 human rights as well as anti-Communism
 from governments that we support.

 of the facts in order to justify and unjusti-
 fiable war.
 For instance, regarding circular "4/34a-
 1064BT" which says, "The Communists have
 worked ceaselessly to prevent the success of
 the treaty" (the 1964 Geneva Accords).  It
 was Diem, supported by the United States
 who canceled the elections that were to be
 held in 1956 at the latest-not the Com-
 munists, because they would have won that
 election.   President  Eisenhower  has been
 quoted as saying that in 1954, 80 percent of
 the Vietnamese supported Ho Chi Minh-
 which is not surprising.   No matter what
 his ideology, he was the leader against the
 corrupt French colonial government, which
 the United States supported to the extent
 of $4 billion.   If we are so sure that the
 people of South Vietnam will gladly choose
 us, then why not call in the U.N.?   And
 why, if we are so completely correct, are our
 allies not supporting our stand?  Even Eng-
 land, our stanchest ally. is not enthusiastic.
 Do you sleep well at night Mr..Greenfield,

 NEUTRALIZATION  OR  NEGOTIATED  SETTLEMENT
 IN  VIETNAM
 Your concern over the situation in Viet-
 nam is understood and shared.                                                                                     At this time,
 no issue commands more of the time, energy
 and attention of the President and his senior
 advisers.
 The United States desires no permanent
 military presence or base in Vietnam. Noth-
 ing would please us more than the creation
 of a situation in which American soldiers
 could be withdrawn from a peaceful, secure,
 and independent Vietnam.  That is, in fact,
 precisely the situation we are struggling to
 bring about.
 Suggestions for solving the Vietnam prob-
 lem by neutralization or negotiation have
 come from several quarters. A negotiated
 settlement of hostilities in Vietnam was the
 intention of the Geneva Accords of 1954, but
 the Communists have worked ceaselessly to
 prevent the success of the treaty.  Although
 the situation in Vietnam is a complicated
 one, the cause of the crisis is not.  It is
 caused by the simple fact that the Com-
 munists in North Vietnam are attempting
 to conquer South Vietnam. It Is Communist
 aggression which makes a negotiated settle-
 ment in Vietnam impossible. at the present
 time.  As of now, the Communists are not
 interested in a neutral Vietnam.  Hanoi has
 specifically  rejected  neutrality for  itself.
 Their rule for negotiation is "What's mine
 is mine, and what's yours is negotiable."
 Neutralization would simply' be a way sta-
 tion on the road to a Communist Vietnam-
 and after that a Communist Laos-and after
 that a Communist Thailand-and ultimately
 a Communist dominated southeast Asia.
 As President Johnson said:
 "No negotiated settlement in Vietnam is
 possible, as long as the Communists hope
 to achieve victory by force.
 "Once war seems hopeless, then peace may
 be possible.  The door is always open to any
 settlement which assures the independence
 of South Vietnam, and its freedom to seek
 help for its protection."
 VIETNAM: BASIC POLICY
 So many conflicting statements are being
 made about Vietnam that I think it is use-
 ful to restate the bedrock truths about the
 situation there.  First, the problem of Viet-
 nam is Communist aggression.  We are cer-
 tainly there in force now, but the South
 Vietnamese  asked for our assistance only
 when the Communist assault reached such
 proportions as to imperil the very existence
 of South Vietnam.  Second, we have no de-
 sire for a military presence or base In Viet-
 nam.  Our goal is precisely to create a situ-
 ation in which we can withdraw from a
 peaceful,  secure,  and  independent South
 Vietnam.   That will be possible whenever the
 Communists decide to leave their neighbor
 alone. Third, until the Communists call off
 their assault, our withdrawal would simply
 mean turning over 14 million people to the
 Communists.  A political settlement is possi-
 ble only when the Communists are convinced
 they cannot win by force.  Finally, the situ-
 ation in Vietnam cannot sensibly be isolated
 from the general world situation.  Vietnam
 is  not  the end  of  Communist ambition,
 After Vietnam there is Laos, and Cambodia,
 and Thailand, etc.  And if we permit Com-
 munist                                                                                                                                               armed  subversion , to succeed in
 southeast Asia we will surely see it again-
 and soon-in Africa,                                                                                                                                           in the  Middle East,
 and in our own hemisphere.
 It is certainly true that Vietnam is not an
 ideal place for a test of American determi-
 nation.  That is why the Communists choose
 it for the test.  And it is true that there
 is much in South Vietnam and in the war
 there that is not as we would wish it to be.
 Your concern with the situation is under-
 stood and shared at all levels of this Gov-
 ernment.  No issue commands more of the
 time and energy of the President and his
 advisers. Our policy has been examined and
 reexamined and is kept under constant re-
 view.. As a result of this study it is the rooted
 conviction of this Government's policymak-
 ers that our involvement in Vietnam is es-
 sential to our security.  I am enclosing ma-
 terial which explains why Vietnam is im-
 portant to us and contains other information
 regarding that area which may be of interest
 to you.
 WITHDRAWAL FROM  VIETNAM
 First, I want you to know that your con-
 cern over the situation in Vietnam is under-
 stood and shared at all levels of the U.S.
 Government.  No issue commands more of
 the attention and energy of the President and
 his advisers. Our policy has been examined
 and reexamined untold times and is under
 constant review.  We are involved in Viet-
 nam because it is the deep conviction of the
 policymaking officials  of the  Government
 that our involvement is essential to American
 security.  I am enclosing material which ex-
 plains why Vietnam is important to us and
 contains other information regarding that
 area which may be of interest to you.
 You suggest that the United States should
 withdraw from Vietnam.  South Vietnam is
 literally under a siege mounted by the North
 Vietnamese Communists.  Without our as-
 sistance South Vietnam would quickly be
 overrun and conquered by the Communist
 terrorists.

 I agree with you that Vietnam is far from

 situation in Vietnam which we would have
 different, if it were our choice.  But I can-
 not agree that we should abandon 14 million
 people who need our help, asked for our help,
 and cannot withstand the" Communist as-
 sault without our help.   The situation in
 Vietnam is tragic-but it will become even
 more so if we find our responsibilities too
 heavy to  carry.   After  Vietnam,  there  is
 Laos--and   Thailand-and   Malaysia,     etc.
 And if armed Communists subversion suc-

 EDIToR, the Sun, Sir.-Are not the bombings

 populations of North Vietnam and Laos, de-
 liberate war crimes in retaliation for alleged
 help to the South Vietnamese National Lib-
 eration Army just as was the massacre of the
 populations of and destruction of villages
 by the Nazis in the U.S.S.R., in retaliation
 for the successes of Soviet guerrillas against
 the Nazi invaders?
 Should not L.B.J., Rusk, McNamara, Max-
 well Taylor, all be denounced like the Nazis
 as war criminals?
 By the use of terror weapons and by the
 language used by American military person-
 nel describing the results obtained by the
 use of these terror weapons, it is shown that
 the Yanks are out-Running the Huns.
 See what John Kirkwood, your special cor-
 respondent in South Vietnam, reported.
 As Brig. Gen. Hugh B. Hester, of the Amer-
 ican Army (retired), states in an article in

 America believes in self-determination if

 A  nation  that  has  corruption  everywhere

 AN  OPEN  LETTER  TO  PRESIDENT JOHNSON
 TORONTO,  ONTARIO.
 DEAR  MR.  PRESIDENT:    Canada  is  an  ally
 of the United States and a partner in what
 are termed defense arrangements: NATO,
 NORAD, the DEW Line.  U.S. bombers have
 rights on  some  Canadian  bases and U.S.
 nuclear warheads  have     been  placed on
 Canadian missile bases.
 Therefore it is reasonable that Canadian
 citizens should raise their voices against cer-
 tain policies and actions of your Government
 which may be considered as unrealistic and
 dangerous to the peace of Canada and the
 world.
 END  THE  WAR  IN  VIETNAM
 Of supreme importance is the necessity to
 end  the  war                  in Vietnam.  Commonsense,
 justice, and a decent regard for the opinion
 of mankind require that the 1954 Geneva
 Conference be reconvened and a reasonable
 political settlement be made.
 You cannot win the war against the people
 of South Vietnam.  In spite of all the terror-
 ism of your puppet regimes, the National
 Liberation Front government controls and
 governs almost 80 percent of the country.
 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR "SPE-
 CIAI,  WARFARE"                                                                         AND  HITLER'S  WARFARE?
 We have recently had a representative in
 Vietnam.  We are shocked and horrified to
 learn at first hand of the brutal, inhuman
 and criminal  nature  of  your  so-called
 special warfare.
 Thousands of villages have been burned
 with napalm gas, and huge areas drenched
 with poison chemicals, killing hundreds of
 thousands of men, women and children, as
 well as domestic animals.  You have elevated
 the. bestialities of Auschwitz and Buchen-
 wald into a science of "Special warfare."
 The toll of dead, wounded, and burned is
 now I million.
 The vast majority of people in Asia and
 Africa are being graphically informed. Hun-
 dreds of delegations go to see for themselves.
 You are creating a huge tide of hatred and
 loathing for the United States of America.
 This open letter is published to commemo-
 rate the fourth anniversary of the founding
 of the National Liberation Front govern-
 ment.  These heroic men and women really
 represent 80 percent of the people and the
 territory  of  South  Vietnam.  They have
 earned the right to be the government of
 their people just as surely as did George
 Washington and his supporters during the
 grim winter of Valley Forge.
 In the name of our common humanity, Mr.
 President, end this inhuman war, reconvene
 the 1954 Geneva Conference and negotiate a
 reasonable and just settlement.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 SIR: May I respectfully offer a bit of am.
 munition to use in your courageous figh
 against this Government's policy in Viet.
 nam?
 Administration spokesmen haverepeatedl3
 stated that the war in Vietnam is "orderec
 and directed and masterminded by Hanoi.
 If this be true, the orders and direction?
 must be communicated to the hundreds of
 Vietcong units,  many  of  them  isolated,
 operating all over South Vietnam,   How is
 this  being done?    What means of com-
 munication is being used?
 Telephone?  Telegraph?   Personal letter?
 Hardly.
 Messengers? How long does It take a man
 to walk or bicycle the thousand miles between
 Hanoi and the southern part of the Mekong
 Delta?
 This leaves us, if we are willing to reject
 jungle drums and carrier pigeons and clair-
 voyance, only radio.
 But consider: This Nation, as the Japanese
 learned to their sorrow more than 20 years
 ago, boasts the finest code breakers in the
 world; we can crack a complicated code in a
 matter of hours.  Further, all radio messages
 between Hanoi and the Vietcong are surely
 being monitored by our experts.  We must
 know, then, exactly what orders and direc-
 tions are being transmitted by Hanoi to the
 Vietcong.
 Therefore, If Johnson and Rusk and Bundy
 and McNamara are telling the truth, if in-
 deed that war is being "ordered and directed
 and masterminded by Hanoi" how is it pos-
 sible for us to be surprised day after day
 after day by the "sneak" attacks" of the
 Vietcong?
 To get down to one final specific: if the
 attack on our embassy was ordered by Hanoi,
 why didn't we take steps to thwart it?
 Sincerely yours,
 WHITMAN CHAMBERS.

 I WAR WITH CHINA?
 (By Hans J. Morgenthau)
 (Hans J. Morgenthau is director of the
 Center for the Study of American Foreign and
 Military Policy at the University of Chicago.)
 It illuminates the many misunderstand-
 ings that beset our Vietnam policy that in
 order to criticize ,that policy in public one
 has first to justify one's right to do so. The
 astrous he thought his policies to be?  The
 Chamberlain government was driven out of
 office in the midst of war; was It the duty
 of the opposition to keep quiet and rally be-
 hind it? Should the German Reichstag have
 kept silent in 1917 instead of passing, a reso-
 lution asking for a peace without annexa-
 tions?  The German Government of the day
 indeed thought so, but history showed that
 the  parliamentary  opposition  had  better
 judgment than the government.   In the years
 preceding Pearl Harbor, this country engaged
 in a great debate about the best foreign policy
 to follow. Did the country not benefit from
 this clarification of the issues and was its
 later unity not in good measure founded
 upon it?
 Two main arguments are advanced in favor
 of the proposition that the people should
 rally behind the President and not criticize
 his Vietnamese policies.  One is that only
 the President has all the facts and therefore
 only he has the right to judge.  The truth is
 that nobody has all the facts and nobody
 needs them all. What both the President and
 his critics need and have are the relevant
 facts, and what they need more than any-
 thing else is sound judgment.                                                                                                                                           No one man
 can have a monopoly of that judgment.
 More particularly, the President cannot have
 it under present conditions.
 It must be obvious to anyone who is ac-
 quainted with the President's principal ad-
 visers that the most powerful advice he gets
 seeks the extension of the war, and that it
 is hardly anything more than his innate good
 sense  that  has thus far  prevented  these
 advisers from carrying the day completely.
 The President ought to welcome, rather than
 regret, those voices from Congress and the
 public at large which give arguments and
 support to his sound Instinct.  The President
 would no doubt have personally an easier
 time of it, but only in the short run, if his
 Vietnamese policies were not exposed to criti-
 cism.  Yet what the President must seek is
 not the convenience of 1 day but the ap-
 probation of history for all time to come.
 President Johnson  is as  conscious of his
 historic mission and of his place in history
 as any of his predecessors.  Why, then, does
 he in this instance not practice what he
 knows to be right?
 The answer to this question is to be found
 in the other argument in favor of silently
 rallying behind the President. It is the con-
 ception of consensus.  Certainly the political

 health of the Nation and the effectiveness of
 Government are greatly enhanced when the
 policies of the Government are supported by
 the great mass of the people. But consensus
 is a means to an end, not an end in itself.
 Here is one of the differences between a
 totalitarian and a democratic society.   In
 the former, dissent is a moral vice and a
 political crime by definition and, conversely,
 consensus is the ultimate good.  In a de-
 mocracy, the ultime standard is the sound-
 ness of policy for the support of which popu-
 lar consensus is sought.
 The democratic statesman is faced with
 an inevitable dilemma if he cannot get pop-
 ular support for the sound policies he would
 like  to pursue.   He  will.  choose the easy
 disastrous way out if he      sacrifices  sound
 policies on the altar of a fleeting popularity.
 If he chooses to pursue the policies he deems
 to be right against the opposition of the
 popular consensus, he must seek to change
 the consensus in favor of his policies in order
 to be able to pursue them.  Doing this, he
 risks domestic political failure, but If he suc-
 ceeds domestically, he will gain the immor-
 tality of a great statesman.
 George Washington knew how to resolve
 this dilemma of democratic statesmanship.
 He proclaimed the neutrality of the United
 States in the War of the First Coalition
 against revolutionary France in 1793, while
 the popular consensus fervently wanted him
 to join France in that war.  For weeks,
 crowds roamed the streets of Philadelphia
 clamoring for Washington's head, and John
 Marshall reports in his biography of Wash-
 ington that if a motion for Washington's im-
 peachment had not been tabled in Congress,
 it would have passed with an overwhelming
 majority. Yet if Washington had made con-
 sensus the ultimate yardstick of his policy,
 he would have gone down in - history as the
 wrecker, not the Father of his Country.
 TWO  DIFFERENT  ANSWERS
 A critical assessment of our involvement in
 Vietnam must start with the question, Why
 are we involved in Vietnam?  Spokesmen for
 our Government have given two different
 answers.            One answer is implicit in the Sec-
 retary of State's often repeated statement
 that our military mission in Vietnam will end
 when North Vietnam  leaves  its  neighbor
 alone.  In other words, we are in Vietnam in
 order to protect the independence of a sover-
 eign state.  Once that sovereignty is assured
 we Can go home.  It follows from this posi-
 tion that we would not presume to control
 the way in which that sovereignty might be
 exercised. If,  for  Instance,  the  Vietcong
 should take over the government in Saigon
 without support from the North or if a
 South Vietnamese Government shouldcome
 to an understanding with the North through
 which thecountry would be united under Ho
 Chi Minh, we would not intervene.
 The other answer to our question has been
 most clearly formulated by the Secretary of
 Defense when he said on February 18 that
 "the choice Is not simply whether to con-
 tinue our efforts to keep South Vietnam free
 and independent but, rather, whether to
 continue our struggle to halt Communist ex-
 pahsion in Asia."  It is the  same  answer
 Senator  Door)  has given at length in his
 Senate speech of February 23. This answer
 is tantamount to saying that we shall oppose
 communism In South Vietnam or wherever
 else we find it in Asia, by military means if
 necessary.  In other words, we shall contain
 communism in Asia, as we have contained it
 in Europe.  Other official spokesmen, such as
 Undersecretary of State Ball in his speech
 of March    16,  have  expressed  the  same
 thought less concisely by defining our mis-
 sion in Asia as the defense of freedom, that
 is, of non-Communist governments, against
 communism.
 It is obvious that these two positions are
 irreconcilable.  For if one takes the Secre-
 tary of State at his word, then we are en-
 gaged In a limited undertaking which could , Union, China, North and South Vietnam
 be liquidated through a negotiated settle-   order to see how self-defeating this d
 ment without too much difficulty.  If Hanoi
 made a gesture toward noninterference in the
 affairs of South Vietnam, we could find a
 formula which would allow us to disengage
 ourselves from South Vietnam.  If, on the
 other hand, one takes the Secretary of De-
 fense at his word, then we are engaged in a
 global crusade against communism which we
 must fight wherever we find it.  Consequent-
 ly, there is no possibility for a negotiated set-
 tlement, and we shall stay in South Vietnam
 as long as communism threatens to expand
 in Asia, that is, indefinitely.
 There can be no doubt, on the basis of ex-
 ternal and internal evidence, that the posi-
 tion of the Secretary of Defense Is at present
 in the ascendancy in our Government.  It
 is with that position, therefore, that I am
 here concerned.  I am emphatically opposed
 to it on two grounds: because of the in-
 tellectual errors from which it derives, and
 because of its likely consequences,
 The intellectual errors of that position are
 two: misunderstanding of the nature of con-
 temporary  communism;  misunderstanding
 of the policy of containment.
 We are in Asia in order to contain commu-
 nism.  But what do we mean by commu-
 nism?  To answer that question we must
 take a critical look at the two equations that
 provide the  implicit  foundation  for  our
 Asian policies.  On the one hand, we have
 equated communism      with the power of
 China; on the other hand, we have equated
 communism anywhere in Asia with Chinese
 communism.      Yet what has been true of
 the Soviet Union in Europe has proved to be
 true also of China in Asia: that the basic
 direction of her policies is determined pri-
 marily by her traditional national interests,
 and that communism only adds a new dy-
 namic dimension to the means by which
 those policies are to be achieved.  In other
 words, the fundamental fact in Asia is not
 that China has a Communist government but
 that she has resumed her traditional role as
 the predominant power in Asia.  That that
 power has been restored under Communist
 auspices is the only relevant fact for our
 anti-Communist crusaders.  Yet it is but of
 secondary importance to the nations of Asia
 which, from Japan to Pakistan, behold with
 awe and admiration the new Chinese power
 and try to come to terms with it.
 The identification of Asian with Chinese
 communism Is similarly the result of the
 crusading opposition to communism as a
 political philosophy and a way of life.  Such
 identification Is justified in philosophy and
 ethics, but it has no place in foreign policy.
 For it is an obvious fact of experience that
 in the conduct of our foreign policy we are
 faced not with one monolithic communism,
 but with a number of different communisms
 whose character is determined by the char-
 acter and the interests of the particular na-
 tion embracing it.  Thus we find in Asia, as
 elsewhere,  different  kinds  of  communism
 whose relations to China and the Soviet
 Union  range  all  the   way  from complete
 independence to complete subservience.   To
 treat all these communisms alike on the as-
 sumption                                                                                    that they are  all  equally sub-
 servient to either China or the Soviet Union
 or to both is the height of doctrinaire folly.
 In its intellectual debility, it is no different
 from the doctrinaire excesses  of a vulgar
 Marxism which sees the capitalistic world
 as a monolithic monster bent upon the, de-
 struction of communism.
 Not only is such an attitude of indiscrim-
 inate hostility intellectually untenable, but
 it also precludes any possibility at diplo-
 matic  maneuver,  subtle  bargaining,  and
 tolerable accommodation. In other words,
 it renders impossible the conduct of a for-
 eign policy worthy of the name. One only
 needs to consider in the light of such oppor-
 tunities for creative diplomacy the present
 relations among the United States, the Soviet
 nism is.  Instead of bombing North Vietn
 because we don't know what else to do,
 would at least have a chance at bending
 situation in southeast Asia to our ration
 defined interests if the President were
 vised by a Richelieu, a Talleyrand, a 1
 mark or-why go abroad-a Hamilton.
 FOREIGN POLICY CURSE
 Alas, the President of the United St
 has no such advisers.  Instead, he Is adv
 "to continue our struggle to halt Commu
 expansion in Asia," regardless of its cha
 -ter, its aims, its relevance to the interest
 the United States.  For such simple-mir
 conception of the enemy, the comple}
 and subtleties of diplomatic maneuver
 no promise.  It needs an instrument as
 ple, indiscriminate, and crude as itself
 it has found such an instrument ir
 policy of the peripheral military con
 ment of China.  Here we are in the pre
 of the other intellectual error that domi
 our Asian policy.
 It seems to have been the curse of ou
 eign policy since the end of the Second
 War that it has become the victim
 own successes.  The Marshall plan wa:
 nently successful in Europe, and so wi
 fashioned a global policy of foreign
 the assumptions of the Marshall plan.
 policy of containment was eminentll
 cessful in Europe, and so we have ext
 it to the rest of the globe.
 Yet the factors which made the pol
 containment a success in Europe are p
 nowhere else and least of all in Asia.
 a line could be drawn across the Eur
 Continent which clearly delimits the
 ern borders of the Soviet Empire.  Sc
 two armies face each other across that 1
 demarcation, which is guaranteed syn
 cally by the presence of American troop
 actually by the nuclear power of the U
 States to which the Soviet Union is vu
 able.  Third, to the west of that bout
 there lies an ancient civilization whict
 but temporarily in disarray and proved
 capable of containing Communist sul
 lion.  These factors add up to a threat w
 is primarily military in nature and to
 countered primarily by military means.  I
 of these factors is present in Asia.
 The threat here is not primarily mill
 but political in nature.  Weak governmt
 and societies are exposed to Communist s
 version, which may or may not be an exi
 Sion of Chinese power, as Chinese power ;
 or may not be carried abroad by coin:
 nism.   Military containment has no b
 ing upon such a threat.  Thus SEATO
 been irrelevant to the expansion of Chi
 influence into Indonesia and Pakistan.  I
 particularly, China can, in the present E
 of her development, be hurt but not
 stroyed by nuclear weapons.
 But even if the threat emanating f
 China were primarily military in natur
 could not be contained through- the def
 of accidentally selected local outposts al
 periphery of China.  For since the asc
 ancy of China In Asia Is due primarily i
 cultural and political predominance,
 futile to think that one can contain that
 dominance            by  militarily defending
 Vietnam or Thailand.  That Chinese
 dominance is as much a fact of life
 American             predominance in  the  WE
 Hemisphere, and our attempts to co
 Chinese predominance in Asia through
 military operations is about as sensil
 would be China's trying to contain the,
 lean predominance in the Western            :
 sphere by committing her military for
 defense of one or the other of the
 American countries.

 France owes more to Mendes-France who
 liquidated  the  Indochinese  War,  and  to
 De Gaulle who stopped the fighting in Al-

 fighting without  regard  for the limits of
 their country's interests and power.  Those
 few who warned Athens against the Sicilian

 of Athens' greatness, were better patriots
 than its promoters, To point to the likely

 apologetic assertion, but it is also a duty,
 burdensome yet inescapable.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  I know I speak for
 thousands and thousands of American citi-
 zens who are most grateful for your coura-
 geous stand against the abominable business
 in Vietnam. I speak also for those who write
 in protest and whose protest is ignored.
 Enclosed is a copy of a letter I sent to
 President Johnson March 31. Its receipt was
 not even acknowledged.  Heretofore when I
 have written the President or the State De-
 partment, back comes a letter. Perhaps now
 there are so many protests about his Vietnam
 policy he is simply provided with extra waste-
 baskets.
 I would be delighted if you get a chance
 to show it to him, or you might like to put
 it in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
 There is still some hope for our country
 when the Senate has in it a man like you.
 Sincerely,
 JOHN MANNING..
 .-President of the United States of America,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:  Like thousands and 1   .1
 thousands of the American people, I believed
 that what you said in your campaign ex-
 pressed your real meaning and purpose; that
 you were against any widening of the war in
 Vietnam; that you would work for peace;
 that a vote for you was a vote for peace.
 While a vote for Goldwater meant increase.
 and expansion in that "dirty war" in Viet-
 nam, on which course he was verbally in-
 sisting.
 I supported you strongly in the 1964 Cam-
 paign and urged everyone I knew to do like-
 wise.
 I will not forgive you for allowing your
 administration to use the vast resources of
 our country, its manpower, its influence-
 not only to continue the "dirty war," but to
 promote and accelerate it with ever-increas-
 ing savagery.
 Just as the Buddhists in Saigon are op-
 posed to anyone who doesn't stand for peace,
 I am opposed to you or anyone who is pro-
 moting or endorsing this gigantic evil.
 How long it will take to get out, I do not
 know; but out is where we belong.  Every
 successive day and hour American forces are
 in that unhappy country, devastating the
 land, murdering its inhabitants, is one more
 day and hour of disgrace-indelible disgrace
 for our beloved country.
 Yours truly,
 JOHN MANNING,
 Former member Democratic State Com-
 mittee of California.
 I enclose a brief account of earlier activi-
 ties for our Democratic Party which, I feel,
 7907
 give me a right to object as forcibly as I can
 to the disastrous course along which you
 are leading this country.
 BALDWIN, CALIF.
 Re John Manning, former member Demo-
 cratic State Committee of California.
 Since 1932 I have worked. intensely for the
 success of the Demorcatic Party, out here in
 California.
 As soon as Garner won in the primaries
 and "had" the California and Texas delega-
 tions,  being convinced  that  a  Roosevelt-
 Garner ticket would carry the Democratic
 Party to victory, I went about the country
 urging Garner for Vice President; Went down
 into Texas.
 Texas was poor then. Everybody was poor.
 Texas couldn't even get 10 cents a pound
 for its cotton.  "Look here," I said, "Gar-
 ner never could win as President but he'll
 make a corking Vice President. 'Roosevelt
 and Garner,' is a ticket that will sweep the
 country."
 With the bonus marchers from Texas, I
 traveled from Texarkana to Louisville, Ky.
 and campaigned all the way for Roosevelt
 and Garner.  Also I sold them on the idea
 of making their camp on lower Pennsylvania
 Avenue.   "Don't let them shove you boys
 out to Quantico," I said, "where no one in
 Washington will see you.  There are empty
 buildings about to be demolished there on
 lower Pennsylvania Avenue,  why not  use
 them?"    They did.  And stayed there until
 MacArtht* and his lieutenant, Dwight Eisen-
 hower, drove them out.
 I continued my campaign until reaching
 Washington, D.C., buttonholing everyone who
 counted in behalf of the Roosevelt-Garner
 ticket.  After the convention, I returned to
 Pasadena and took charge of the campaign
 at the East Pasadena headquarters.  We suc-
 ceeded in getting the Catholics to go along
 for the whole ticket.  Including McAdoo.  In
 election districts that never before in Pasa-
 dena history had been carried for the Dem-
 ocratic Party, we carried for the Roosevelt-
 Garner ticket.  After the election, Senator
 McAdoo offered to have me appointed as an
 appraiser for the farm loan bank.  I turned
 down the job because I knew that if I was
 to be useful to the administration, it would
 have to be is the Labor Department.
 Texas has gone a long way since those
 days when I was working indefatigably to
 convince the Texas voter that the winning
 ticket was Roosevelt-Garner.  No longer is
 Texas poor.  Yet, for all the wealth amassed
 by Texas since  1933, if John Garner had
 not been elected Vice President in 1932, you
 today, Mr. Lyndon Johnson, would not be
 President of these United States.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR: I have read and heard many
 of your strong criticisms of this country's
 policy and actions in Vietnam and I want to
 state my support of your position. I am very
 much opposed to what our country is doing
 in southeast Asia.  We are losing friends and
 gaining more enemies.  Each bomb creates
 more Communists than it kills.
 I  hope you will continue to speak out
 against our country's present policies and
 work for a peaceful solution to the problems
 of southeast Asia.
 Sincerely yours,
 DETROIT,  MICH.,

 millions of dollars and sacrificing thousands
 of lives for what and whom? We were wrong
 to have entered Into this In the first place
 and I feel, as a Nation, we should admit our

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR:  We wish       to congratulate
 you on your fine- speech at Athens, Ohio,
 condemning  the Vietnam      war. President
 Johnson's lack of experience is leading us
 deeper into this conflict and action should
 be taken at once by our senior Senators to
 terminate this war.  This war is hopeless
 and In my opinion it cannot be won.  The
 most we can hope for is a stalemate.  We
 didn't win the Korean war and this one is
 much more difficult considering the location.
 Its extremely hard for me to understand why
 the Unite. Nations is not involved.  We!
 talk about opposing communism but there:
 isn't one Russian soldier Involved. Why?
 There weren't any Russians in Korea either.
 Why?  This indicates that Russia is much
 smarter than we are as they get other people
 to do their fighting.  This is a bad reflection
 on Mr. Rusk and Mr. McNamara.  Why Isn't
 Australia and New Zealand afraid of south-
 east Asia going Communist and furnishing
 fighting men.
 This Is a very unnecessary war and if it
 spreads -we will lose all our resources; the
 most valuable-our young men-and every-
 thing possible should be done to get it
 stopped.

 to order a mobilization  of reservists and
 draftees.
 This call for American ground forces is the
 logical and inevitable consequence of the
 virtual collapse of the Saigon government
 in the villages.  Having lost the countryside,
 Saigon has lost the sources of military man-
 power.  This deprives it of the means for
 winning the war.     The official estimates to-
 day are that the Saigon government com-
 mands forces superior to the Vietcong by a
 ratio of not quite 5 to 1.  Experience shows
 that no guerrilla war has ever been subdued
 with such a low ratio of superiority.  It is
 estimated that in Malaya, the British and the
 Malayans, who were fighting the indigenous
 Chinese guerrillas, reached a superiority of
 50 to 1. In Cyprus, which they gave up, the
 British had overwhelming force.  In Algeria,
 though the French army had unmistakable
 superiority, the country became untenable.
 It is the deficiency in South Vietnamese mili-
 tary manpower which explains why the pres-
 sure is now on to put in Americans to fill it.
 After 2 months of bombing North Vietnam,
 it has become manifest also that the bombing
 has not changed the course of the war.  As
 a result of this disappointment, the President
 is now under pressure to extend the bomb-
 ing to the populated centers around Hanoi
 and Haiphong.
 There is no doubt that American air power
 can devastate North Vietnam and, if China
 intervened, could do great damage in China.
 But if we had an American army of 350,000
 men in South Vietnam, and extended the war
 in the air, we would have_ on our hands an
 interminable war without the prospect of a
 solution.  To talk about freedom and na-
 tional independence amidst such violence
 and chaos would be to talk nonsense.
 In order to rationalize, that is to sell, the
 wider war, we are being told by Secretary
 McNamara and others that this war is a de-
 cisive test for the future.  It will decide the
 future of wars of liberation.  This is a pro-
 foundly and dangerously false notion, and it
 shows a lamentable lack of knowledge and
 understanding  of  the  revolutionary  up-
 heavals of the epoch in which we live.                  It
 assumes that revolutionary uprisings against
 established authority are manufactured in
 Peiping or in Moscow, and that they would
 not happen if they were not instigated, sup-

 heavals against the old regime, and we shall

 Apr. 8.19651
 LIMITED WAR
 A  funny  thing has happened between
 November and April.  Those who were most
 critical of Barry Goldwater last fall because
 of his tough line on southeast Asia are now
 President Johnson's principal critics in the
 Vietnam dispute.  Conversely,  those  who
 thought Johnson was too wishy-washy then
 are in his corner now.  The President finds
 a champion in Nixon, a foe in MORSE.
 But the whole thing is not so topsy-turvy
 as a first look would make it appear. The
 difference between the Goldwater and John-
 son approaches is explained in part by the
 Riverside (Calif.) Press-Enterprise.
 Senator Goldwater said he would try to
 win the war in Vietnam.  President Johnson
 doesn't want to lose it, but doesn't think, as
 we get it, that a people can be won over by
 annihilation.  Nor does he want to carry the
 war so far that it could erupt into a general,
 global fire-storm.  The President says he will
 negotiate at any time the Communists feel
 the burdens of war intensely enough to buy
 a compromise which, from this country's
 point of view, would be honorable and en-
 ,forcible.   Senator  Goldwater and  his  ad-
 mirers scoffed at the idea of negotiations.
 The idea of limited war, a war that would
 be neither lost nor won, was at the heart of
 the Truman-MacArthur controversy.  Yet, it
 is a concept that was not foreign to our an-
 cestors.  In the colonial age and the age of
 rising nationalisms, many wars were fought
 less to attain a new objective than to main-
 tain a status' quo.  The idea of uficondi-
 tional surrender, winner take all, is relatively
 new-with only such ancestors as Carthage.
 VIETNAM:  AMERICA MUST DECIDE BETWEEN A
 FULL-SCALE  WAR  AND A  NEGOTIATED  TRUCE
 A spiraling exchange of blows and counter
 blows in Vietnam can lead to a major war
 involving the United States and China-a
 war nobody wants and no one can win.  The
 present tragic conflict can only be resolved
 by political, not military means.  Join with
 us in asking negotiations to end the war in
 Vietnam.  Help mobilize public opinion to
 stop the widening of the war.
 Bombing North Vietnam will not stop the
 conflict in South Vietnam. Widening the
 war only serves to invite the intervention of
 the   North  Vietnamese  regular  army,  the
 U.S.S.R. and China.

 lutionary movements could be suppressed
 once and for all by knocking out Peiping or
 Moscow.   They little know the hydra who
 think that the hydra has only one head and
 that it can be cut off.
 Experience shows that there is no single
 central source of the revolutionary upheavals
 of our epoch.          there that is common
 to the Irish rebellion, to the Jewish uprising
 in Palestine, to the civil war in Cuba, to the
 Arab rebellion in Algeria, to the Huk revolt in
 the Philippines?  What is common to them
 all is violent discontent with the established
 order and a willingness of a minority of the
 discontented to die in the attempt to over-
 throw it.
 What has confused many well-meaning
 Americans is that in some of these rebellions,
 though not by any means in all of them,
 Communists have become the leaders of the
 rebellion.  But that does not mean that they
 have owned the rebellion.  The resistance to
 the Nazis in France and Italy contained a
 high proportion of Communists among the
 active partisans. But 20 years later it is Gen-
 eral de Gaulle who presides over France.
 It would be well to abandon the half-baked
 notion that the war in southeast Asia will be
 decisive for the future of revolutionary up-
 heavals in the world. Revolution is a home-
 grown product, and it could not be stamped
 out decisively and once for all-supposing we
 had such delusions of grandeur-by stamping
 out Red China.  In southeast Asia we have
 No issues will be decided by prolonging

 Vietnam.  The fighting must be brought to a
 halt so that the devastated nation may re-

 ..                      IT's STILL GAS
 One of the most disturbing bits of news
 from the disturbing battle zone in Vietnam
 Is the announcement that South Vietnam's
 troops are using nonlethal gas.  This Is not
 the mustard of World War I memory, but a
 kind, of gas that makes victims temporarily
 ill.  it can be argued that this is really
 humane, as the work of war goes, because the
 victim soon recovers. But it's still gas.
 The danger is that in using, this gas one
 side, our side, has pulled the, plug out of the
 bottle,.  If one side can fight with such a
 weapon, the other side can retaliate with
 such a weapon or a ,better one... How big a
 step is it from nonlethal gas to gas that
 might be lethal under just the right circum-
 stances?  And. ,then how big  is the step to
 the real thing?  What next? Germs?  Will
 this lead to an. "escalation'' of a new and
 terrible kind?
 There wasn't much humane about World
 War II. But no major power used poison
 gas,  although, all were probably prepared
 to--If the other side did first,  The belliger-
 ents In World War II were not being polite.
 They were scared, each worrying about the
 new kind of gas the enemy might have and
 e ch  esitating to risk haying its own troops
 afld c ties usedd as targets.  It was this bal-
 anc                     O.f terror  hat saved us.
 The first usg of a humane, little nonlethal
 gas is like the first use of a humane, little,
 low-yield atomic  bomb.        The  important
 thing is not what that first bomb does, but
 what it could lead to.
 The United. States_canrlot,wash its hands
 of such decisions in Vietnam.  The world
 holds us responsible for what South Vietnam
 does, and the chances are the world is right.
 We lament both theuse of the gas and the
 fact that it was our side that started it.

 Max. 14, 19661
 THE AMERICAN MISSION
 Apologists for the war in Vietnam argue
 two ways.                     On the one hand they say we
 face there an entirely new kind of warfare
 which we must learn and master lest we
 perish; on the other, they say the conflict
 is nothing new, but simply another chapter
 in a long struggle that began when doughty
 Harry  Truman  stopped  the  Communists
 cold in Greece and Turkey with the Truman
 Doctrine.
 The arguments are contradictory, and illus-
 trate why the Vietnam crisis has called into
 question the whole muddy philosophy  of
 "containment," which has served all too long
 as substitute for a sane and balanced Ameri-
 can foreign policy.  The flaw in "contain-
 ment" is that it makes no distinction be-
 tween restraining the power of a hostile na-
 tion to injure our vital interests, and under-
 taking as a kind of world policeman to inter-
 vene in other nations' lives and beat down
 revolution wherever it appears.  The first is
 necessary, the second is folly.
 The Truman Doctrine  did  Indeed have
 something in common with the "Dulles doc-
 trine" now being followed in Vietnam, but
 not to the credit of either. In Greece as in
 Asia we intervened unilaterally in a nation's
 internal affairs to help the Government fight
 a Communist Insurrection.
 Fortunately the Communists were beaten
 in Greece without need for large-soale mili-
 tary operation by our forces as in Vietnam.
 They were beaten, however, not by the Tru-
 man Doctrine but by Tito's closing of the
 Yugoslav border, the main route for infil-
 tration into Greece, after his split with Mos-
 cow.  U.S. power did not "contain" the Soviet
 thrust into Greece; it was contained by the
 divergence of national interests within the
 Communist camp.
 It was Mr. Truman's Marshall plan, rather
 than his venture in Greece, that proved to be
 our great success in helping free nations stay
 free, and thus restrain the undue expansion
 of Soviet national power.  In Western Eu-
 rope we gave massive economic aid; we held
 intervention In. Internal affairs to a mini-
 mum; we helped rebuild an already viable
 society whose people knew how to govern
 themselves; we were fighting economic dis-
 tress rather than political revolution, hunger
 rather than communism.
 The principles of the Marshall plan, of Mr.
 Truman's point 4 technical assistance, of the
 Alliance for Progress, economic development
 aid, the Peace Corps-these and not the doc-
 trine of military containment ought to gov-
 ern our policy toward underdeveloped lands
 emerging from colonialism, such as Vietnam.
 Only by building social and economic condi-
 tions that undercut the incentives for revolu-
 tion can free peoples stay free-and then
 only if they want our kind of freedom badly
 enough to sacrifice for it.
 Instead of pouring futile billions into a
 senseless Vietnam war, we should be invest-
 ing millions in the U.N. plan for Mekong river
 development.
 There will  be occasions when judicious
 military aid may help a beleaguered govern-
 ment stave off revolution long enough to ef-
 fectuate needed reforms itself.  A strong and
 vital government with the confidence of its
 ,;people can win a civil war, even when the
 rebels are getting outside support.  But when
 a government loses the elementary power to
 preserve order-when armed troops success-
 fully challenge its authority-revolution is
 often inevitable. It is then uttermadness for
 7911
 the United States to take over a war which
 the people themselves will not wage. Any
 victories are bound to be temporary, and can
 gain us only hatred by oppressed peoples
 elsewhere.
 Our country has a long history of armed
 intervention in Latin America's internal poli-
 tics-the latest venture being the Bay of Pigs
 invasion of Cuba in 1961-and not once has
 the policy well served our own interest in the
 long run.  It cannot serve our interests in
 Asia or Africa either.  We do not have the
 right, or the power, to decide for any nation
 what kind of society, economy or government
 it shall set up.
 Must we then reconcile ourselves to tri-
 umph after triumph for communism, until at
 last America itself is conquered?  The Birch-
 ites and other fanatics with little faith in the
 power of democratic ideas hold this out as the
 only alternative to a holy war against the
 Reds.  Neither history nor commonsense sup-
 ports their view.  National identity and the
 love of freedom are stronger than any ideol-
 ogy.                                                                                                                                               Yugoslavia, Eastern Europe generally,
 even Ho Chi Minh in North Vietnam, all
 discredit the fears of a monolithic world rev-
 olution controlled by Moscow or Peiping.
 What Americans must understand is that
 revolutions will occur so long as social injus-
 tice endures.  Some revolutions will take a
 Communist form or be exploited by Commu-
 nists.  But this does not mean they will be-
 come mere agents of Russian or Chinese na-
 tional power, nor does it mean that the
 United States has a messianic mission to
 suppress revolution everywhere in the world.
 The American mission is to develop our
 own society into the best of many in a diverse
 world; to aid peoples, not governments, in the
 struggle for a better life; to live at peace and
 unafraid alongside systems of which we do
 not approve.

 MORALE BOOSTED
 The use of U.S. jet bombers against Viet-
 cong concentrations within South Vietnam,
 starting less than 3 weeks ago, has brought
 no conclusive evidence of turning the tide
 of war.  But evidence is hard to come by.
 It requires ground observation of the results
 of strikes and this is difficult in jungle and
 mountain areas.
 One of the purposes of the United States
 and South Vietnamese air strikes across the
 17th parallel, in North Vietnam, and of the
 employment of U.S. bombers and crews with-
 in South Vietnam, was to strengthen the will
 of the South Vietnamese ground forces to
 resist the Communists.  Military and civilian
 sources report that the strikes have, indeed,
 encouraged the South Vietnamese.  After all
 the talk in the United States of negotiation,
 withdrawal, and neutralization, this show-
 ing of U.S. determination to fulfill Presi-
 dent  Kennedy's  and  President  Johnson's
 promise to go all the way to help South
 Vietnam remain independent has bolstered
 the morale of the military and of those civil-
 ians in South Vietnam who care.
 The war in South Vietnam, of course, can-
 not be won by air strikes alone.  As time
 goes  on, however, positive results of this
 aerial support of the ground forces should
 become evident.  Those who say the war is
 already lost may have to revise their opinion.
 The Vietcong are not supermen.
 PENTAGONIAN PUSSYFOOTING
 (By Richard Starnes)
 Scarcely a month ago as the truth-seeking
 hindsight flies, U Thant stirred up the con-
 ditioned reflexes that lurk in all editorial
 pages when he said the American people "if
 they know the true facts, will feel that fur-
 ther bloodshed is unnecessary and that ne-
 gotiations alone can create conditions which
 would enable the United States to withdraw
 gracefully" from Vietnam.

 A lot of chronically short fuses sputtered
 angrily at the suggestion -the American peo-
 ple are not being told the score in Vietnam,
 and poor Uncle T. was compelled to issue a
 statement that appeared to disavow what
 he'd said the day before.  Close reading (a
 dying art in our soap-selling culture) dis-
 closes  that  the  Secretary-General  didn't
 really recant at all.  But he seemed to and
 thus honor was saved.
 Now we find that U Thant was uttering
 prophetic truth of a high order.
 The American people are not being told
 the truth about the clandestine wax that is
 being carried out against North Vietnam.
 American reporters have been arrested by
 U.S. troops (a circumstance that would have
 caused an outraged cry in a more vigorous
 day)  and they have been denied access to
 news, at its source in Vietnam.
 Reporters have been forbidden access to
 officers' clubs and mess facilities at the Da
 Nang Air Base and In the city of Da Nang.
 This sort of totalitarian abuse never oc-
 cured in the blackest days of World War It.
 The theory in that war was that the people
 who were paying for it and sending their
 sons to die in it were entitled to know about
 it.  Rump-sprung old correspondents flew
 combat missions, landed on beaches, shared
 the dangers, with the tough young kids who
 did the fighting.  Ray Clapper and Ernie
 Pyle, to name just, two of a gallant and
 tragic company, died in combat--armed with
 nothing but their determination to see the
 truth and write it.
 There is no security consideration in the
 news controversy in Vietnam.  War report-
 ers exercise built-in precensorship; indeed
 all willingly submit to more formal censor-
 ship when circumstances demand it.  But
 pruning potentially harmful facts from copy
 and choking news off at the source are two
 vastly different things.  In the first instance,
 the enemy is properly deprived of informa-
 tion that might help him.  In the second, it
 is the American people who are kept in
 shameful ignorance.
 Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, who
 once shuttled between Saigon and Washing-
 ton like an optimistic yo-yo, has long been
 displeased by the nature of the reporting
 from Vietnam.
 Some weeks ago Mr. McNamara instituted
 a dangerous innovation by offering selected
 stateside journalists free 10-day junkets to
 Saigon, where they, were to be met by mili-
 tary shepherds and shown any aspect of the
 war they wanted to see.  I have been unable
 to learn if this determination to show every-
 thing to these U.S.-subsidized reporters in-
 cluded the air base. at Da Nang, or in any
 event if it still includes it.
 The official rationale of this experiment in
 news management was in exquisitely poor
 taste.  It was to the effect that the arrival
 of handpicked squads of fresh-and inex-
 perienced-reporters  in  Saigon  would  en-
 courage resident correspondents to go more
 into the field and see what the war was
 really about.  This, to be sure, was a thinly
 veiled libel of a courageous group of news-
 men. Some (including Scripps-Iioward's Jim
 Lucas), have spent far more days in combat
 than many American troops now in Vietnam.
 These circumstances bring into sharp ques-
 tion the reliability of the accounts of the
 war that are being made available to the
 American people.   Many air raids against
 North Vietnamese targets are now recounted
 only by Radio Hanoi-a bitter commentary
 on the present Pentagonian view of the peo-
 ple's right to know.
 [From the Oregonian, Apr. 1, 19651
 issue," claimed Dr. Han Suyin in talks at
 Willamette University, Tuesday..
 Dr. Han, a doctor of medicine and suc-
 cessful novelist who knows many of Asia's
 leaders personally, criticized U.S. policy and
 actions in Vietnam and said "you're not re-
 assuring your  friends,  you're frightening
 them and consequently losing them."
 Dr.  Han,  who  lives  In  Malaya,  backed
 Morse's position calling for United States
 withdrawing a solution that she  feels  is
 necessary to achieve the   ends which the
 United States claims to be seeking in Viet-
 nam.
 Her comments came during informal talks
 to students following a morning address on
 "The Many Faces of Asia," as part of the
 Willamette lecture series.
 UNITED STATES SAID MISINFORMED
 Dr. Han indicated that the United States is
 sadly misinformed on the Vietnam situa-
 tion and that citizens in general are trying
 to take a short cut to knowledge on the basis
 of mass communication that still doesn't
 present the whole situation.
 In speaking on the many faces of Asia, Dr.
 Han stated that the "bedrock problem of Asia
 today is that it did not invent the steam
 engine."
 "While the western world has been in-
 volved in an industrial revolution for the
 past 400 years, only in the last 100 years has
 Asia begun to emerge from the feudal age in
 a struggle to  assume  its identity  in  the
 world."
 POVERTY PREVALENT
 Dr. Han indicated that 80 percent of the
 Asian population lives in the countryside,
 where  peasants   stagnate  at  the  level of
 poverty.
 "But," she added, "the peasant no longer
 accepts the problems    of poverty as God-
 given;                                                                 he knows they are from the hand
 of man."
 Land reform was seen as a necessity before
 any industrial  revolution  and "we cannot
 look forward to anything but change and
 turmoil for at least the next two decades."
 TRADE, NOT AID
 "Trade, not aid," is the motto of Asia she
 declared.                     Restrictive tariffs have hindered
 external markets for Asian goods and poverty
 hinders internal markets. ,
 She said any form  of government that
 offers some measure of security, some meas-
 ure of prosperity to the many people who
 are starving, will have the people's support.
 "It is good for Americans to talk of free-
 dom and democracy, but the word freedom
 is unknown to the peasant-it is not even
 in his language.  He has only the freedom to
 starve," she said.
 There has to be an overwhelming drastic
 reform in Asia from the bottom up.   And
 it's not going to be attained by means of
 arms or might, according to Dr. Han.
 [From the Sunday Oregonian, Mar. 21, 1965]
 WHOM  To  BELIEVE?
 The  U.S.  State  Department's so-called
 White Paper   on   Vietnam   sought   to
 document with records, reports, interviews
 and photographs its charge of "a brutal cam-
 paign of terror and armed attack" in South
 Vietnam "inspired, directed, supplied and
 controlled  by the  Communist regime  in
 Hanoi" (capital of North Vietnam).
 The document was unconvincing to Miss
 Angela V. Lane, whose letter appears on this
 page, and to some others who have com-
 municated with the editor.  Their general
 view appears to be that the United States
 has no businessin South Vietnam; that the
 trouble is domestic, without proof of North
 Vietnamese aggression, and would be settled
 by the South Vietnamese themselves if the
 United States got out.
 The State Department's report, the second
 on Vietnam, employs the usual strong state-
 ments of government propaganda support-
 ing the government's position.  But it also
 includes specific evidence  to back up its
 charges.  We see no reason to accept the
 doubts of the pacifists or the charges of
 anti-American propagandists as more valid
 than the evidence submitted by our own
 Government.
 Miss Lane cites appendix D and her tabula-
 tion of 179 Communist-made weapons cap-
 tured from the Vietcong.  This was a list
 of weapons submitted to the International
 Control Commission by the government of
 South Vietnam on January 29, 1964.  She
 does not document her statement that the
 reported weapons were only 21/2  percent of
 the captured Vietcong weapons "during the
 same period."   But the State Department
 reports elsewhere in the paper, for example,
 the capture of approximately 100 tons of
 arms, ammunition and supplies brought into
 South Vietnam   by a single trawler.   The
 White Paper gives examples of infiltration,
 of which appendix D is a sample.
 Reports  from   correspondents,   American
 and others, and from military personnel in
 the field support the statements of the White
 Paper in section II  (to which appendix D
 refers, incidentally).
 These  are, in  brief,  that  the Vietcong
 relied chiefly on weapons and ammunition
 left by the defeated French when the V-C
 campaign began in 1959, and that Ho Ch
 Minh's troops in North Vietnam were sup-
 plied mainly from the same source.
 "As the military campaign progressed, the
 Vietcong  depended  heavily  on  weapon:
 captured from the Armed Forces in Soutl
 Vietnam," the White Paper continues. "This
 remains  an  important  source of weapon;
 and ammunition for the Vietcong.  But a:
 the pace of the war has quickened, require-
 ments for up-to-date arms and special types
 of weapons have risen to a point where the
 Vietcong  cannot  rely  on  captured stocks
 * * *.  Large and increasing quantities of
 military supplies are entering South Viet-
 nam from outside the country.  The prin-
 cipal supply point is North Vietnam, which
 provides a convenient channel for materiel
 that originates in Communist China and
 other Communist countries."
 The White Paper may be subject to criti-
 cism-it does give evidence of having been
 thrown together in a hurry to meet a de-
 mand throughout the country for justifica-
 tion of the U.S. presence in Vietnam.  But
 we see nothing in it to support Miss Allen's
 assertion that it is a "white-wash of the real
 facts."  On the contrary, more recent evi-
 dence from the field is that the movement
 into South Vietnam of North Vietnamese
 soldiers and weapons has been greater than
 the State Department charged.

 DOWN  THE  ESCALATOR
 As U.S. persecution of the war in Vietnam
 moves up the escalator, public knowledge of
 what is going on moves down.  At the very
 time information is most important to the
 American people, U.S. officials in the Pen-
 tagon and in Vietnam clamp tighter the lids
 on such information.
 Public knowledge of the course develop-
 ments are taking at this critical stage de-
 pends on the 115 accredited correspondents
 in Vietnam.   Time and again it has been
 proved that their reports have been more
 reliable than those channeled through self-
 serving military and diplomatic sources.
 In the past few days correspondents have
 been arrested for venturing into sensitive
 areas.  Each of the 115 has been subjected
 to a babysitting procedure-one information
 officer per correspondent.   In effect, every
 source of information is screened.  Not even
 in World War II was official monitoring so
 tight as it has become at some points in
 Vietnam.

 the public support it can muster in America

 RED CHINA'S THREAT
 11 Should Red  China carry out its threat
 to send its troops into Vietnam it could not
 expect to be granted, as in the Korean war,
 a privileged sanctuary in ' China.  Yet the
 U.S. Government would be fat-headed, in-
 deed, to disregard the threat.  U,S, bombers
 could wipe out 100 million Chinese and there
 still would be 450 million or more to con-
 tend with.
 What Mao Tse-tung may be considering
 this time is not the potential of a privileged
 sanctuary, but the possibility that the United
 States would not again, as it did at Hiro-
 shima and Nagasaki, resort to nuclear bombs.
 Of course, the United States has no desire
 o bomb Red China even with conventional
 xplosives.  And almost certainly the use of
 uclear  weapons,  which  might  bring  the
 oviet Union into a world catastrophe, could
 aly be justified by a desperate menace to
 Ie United States or its principal allies.
 Red China, qualified its threat by saying
 would send a land army when requested
 r the Vietcong (not by President Ho Chi
 inh of North Vietnam).  This may not
 eaix anything.  If Red China decides to
 ove, it will not be governed by the wishes
 the 'Vietnamese either north or south of
 to 17th parallel.  It would be fatuous for
 :nericans..to consider this an idle threat,
 we tended to do when Mao said hewould
 a fend l4orth' Korea if U.N. troops crossed
 ie'38th parallel.
 But the Vietcong's plea for world support
 ainst "American aggression," the Soviet
 Muttering about "volunteers" and the Red
 hinese threat may be evidence that U.S.
 olicies of bombing the North Vietnam sup-
 ly lines are bringing matters to a head.

 AN FRANCISCO, CALIF.,
 March 26, 1965.
 FIon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senator.
 DEAR SIR; I have written the Senators who
 do represent me but they have not chosen
 to take 'a stand against the criminal policy
 we are persuing in Asia.  I appreciate the
 daily argument you present from the floor of
 d the Senate.  You are acting from a moral
 standpoint and you are interested in estab-
 lishing the basis for a world in which inter-
 national law is regarded. I have no knowl-
 edge of the number of treaties the Soviets
 and Chinese have broken, but I do know that
 by our unilateral intervention in South Viet-
 nam which violates the 1954 Geneva agree-
 ments and by our intervention in Laos which
 is in violation to accords to which we were a
 party, we are doing all we can to encourage,
 through our example, similar violations on
 the part of the states we normally accuse of
 being the ones most likely to violate inter-
 national treaties.
 But the problem is how do we get out of
 the present morass.  Perhaps the President
 could make a statement to the.effect that the
 Information reaching him in the past was in
 error and that lie has since found out the
 ;rue nature of the Vietnamese situation and
 ,hat hapin  so become aware of true facts
 Ie nowealizes  just  in  time  the  best
 hing for the people of Vietnam is a U.S.
 vithdraw_ a1 .under the condition that the
 oimtry be unified under the leadership of
 he north and that the further aid we would
 end would be in the form of materials to
 ebuild the country we have destroyed. This
 mulct be a voillntary reparation;  it would
 ive us    Ore "face`" than any other plan of
 isengagement T can think of.   It sounds
 absurd for many reasons but what other way
 out is there for us now that the war is on the
 brink of a full-scale limited action.
 The point of this is that we 'are now in too
 far for the north to back down.  That is, of
 course, making  the  assumption which is
 probably in error that the North Vietnamese
 have the power to stop the guerrilla war in
 the south.
 Perhaps what we need around the Capital
 is a bunch of lobbyists whose vested interest
 is the establishment of new relations between
 the states so that the developing countries
 would become customers of our factories who
 sell the means of production instead of just
 the product.  If there were some voice other
 than the interests of those who stand to gain
 by the continuation of our present relation-
 ship with the underdeveloped world, that is,
 where we buy the primary products, then
 perhaps there would be enough steam for us
 to lead in decolonization instead of allowing
 the Communists preempt the field.

 DONALD R. WASKEY.

 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.                            -
 DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I am enclosing
 a reproduction of an advertisement which
 appeared on Friday in the New Haven Jour-
 nal Courier, the New Haven Register, and
 today in the Yale Daily News.  This petition
 was circulated within only 3 days' time and
 yet it represents a group of prominent New
 Haven citizens, all of whom voted for you
 in the last election.
 In November, I departed from my own
 usual practice and publicly endorsed your
 candidacy from my pulpit, even though I
 had heretofore never used  the pulpit for
 partisan politics.   I spoke on your, behalf
 because I believed that you represented the
 voices of sanity and decency in our Nation.
 I still feel this way and I am proud of your
 many achievements.
 At the same time, like so many Americans,
 I deplore the military approach that our Gov-
 ernment is using to solve the problems of
 Vietnam.   Only today,  Senator  Goldwater
 complimented you on our recent bombing
 raids and went even further, suggesting the
 bombing of Hanoi but the American people
 voted for you and not for Senator Goldwater.
 Had they wanted his policies to prevail, they
 had the opportunity to elect him.
 May I respectfully request that you recon-
 sider our present actions in Vietnam and be
 willing to negotiate, in or outside of the
 United Nations, to make peace in that un-
 happy country and to secure an enduring
 peace among the nations.
 Sincerely,
 RABBI ROBERT E. GOLDBURG.

 we will never fear to negotiate."

 We support the appeal of the Secretary
 General of the United Nations U Thant, call-
 ing on the countries involved in the conflict
 in Vietnam to move "from the field of battle
 to the conference table" in or outside the
 U.N.
 We believe that the military approach can-
 not lead to a real solution or serve the best
 interests of our Nation and that expansion
 of the war by any party threatens the peace
 of the world.

 up a rule of law in Asia-honorable in

 OUR MAJORITY LEADER MQVES FOR SANITY IN

 Mr. GRVENING subsequently said:
 Mr. President, earlier today. our distin-
 guished majority leader, the senior Sen-
 ?ator from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD], a
 noted expert on the Far East, made an
 Important declaration on a subject which
 should be in the minds of all. Ameri-
 cans-the undeclared war in southeast
 Asia.  I commend the Senator from
 Montana for bringing up the subject, be-
 cause there has been great need for de-
 bate in this body and elsewhere in the
 Nation.  Debate has been going on in
 various colleges, but so far it has been
 conspicuously absent from the place
 where it really belongs-in the Congress
 of the United States.
 Senator  MANSFIELD  began  by  say-
 Ing:
 It is time for some blunt words on Viet-
 nam.
 I agree.
 He went on to say that while there is
 a great deal of talk about what the
 President meant or did not, mean by his
 speech at Johns Hopkins University, on
 April 7, the bloodshed goes on, and peo-
 ple in both North and South Vietnam are
 dying.
 He called for a cease-fire, for which the
 ,Senator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE] and
 I have been asking for over a year, so
 that there would be a reasonable chance
 of a peaceful settlement and a cessation
 of the slaughter.
 He  suggested  that the conferences
 suggested for Cambodia might very well
 be extended tp a discussion of the Viet-
 nam situation.
 Certainly, all rationally minded peo-
 ple should want to find a peaceful solu-
 tion to a s eadily escalating conflict
 which is on the eve of involving us in a
 major  war  possibly a thermonuclear
 holocaust.  Every suggestion to prevent
 this should be gratefully received.
 The    Senator  from  Vermont  [Mr.
 AiKsN] has rightly expressed the hope
 that the,, world will read and take note
 of what our distinguished majority lead-
 er  [Mr. MANSFIELD]  has said.                Senator
 AIKEN correctly stated, in his comment,
 that it was plainly evident that unless
 reasst  returned, we would be headed
 into the most devastating conflict the,

 MINIMUM WAGE IN THE DISTRICT
 OF COLUMBIA-
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, there ap-
 .peared in the Washington Post this
 morning a_ very fine editorial entitled,
 "Minimum Wage in D.C."  I certainly
 share the opinion of the Washington
 Post that minimum wage and hours leg-
 islation is a very necessary ingredient
 to the District of Columbia antipoverty
 program. I ask unanimous consent that
 this excellent editorial be printed in the
 RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.
 As one who has, supported minimum
 wage legislation fora good many years,
 I am pleased and gratified with the tre-
 mendous general public support which
 exists in this city for improvements in
 minimum wage and hours conditions in
 the Nation's Capital. My colleagues will
 be interested to learn, I am sure, that
 the Washington Metropolitan Board of
 Trade recently withdrew its opposition
 covering a good many years to minimum
 wage and hours legislation. I am pleased
 that the Washington Board of Trade has
 seen fit to change its position on this
 very important matter and I wish to
 commend it for taking such action.
 My colleagues will recall that I intro-
 duced S. 3233, a bill to improve wage and
 hours conditions in the Nation's Capital
 on May 1, 1962. I reintroduced the bill,
 S. 860 on February 19, 1963.
 My Subcommittee on Public Health,
 Education, Welfare, and Safety, of which
 I have the privilege of being chairman,
 held public hearings on S. 860 on October
 1, 4, and 8, 1963.
 The Senate passed S. 860 on August 21,
 1964, exactly as it was reported by the
 Senate Committee on the District of Co-
 lumbia.
 I have reintroduced the bill, S. 19, this
 year and plan to hold public hearings on
 the measure as soon as my schedule per-
 mits.  The District of Columbia Board
 of Commissioners in recent weeks have
 had a minimum wage and hours bill in-
 troduced in the House of Representatives
 which is my bill with a few minor and
 technical changes in it.
 I wish to commend Congressman MUL-
 .TER and his subcommittee for the thor-
 oughness in which his subcommittee has
 gone into this subject in recent weeks.
 As I mentioned earlier, it is heartening
 to see the tremendous public support in
 the District of Columbia for new mini-
 mum wage and hours legislation.  I wish
 to commend the Washington Metropoli-
 tan Board of Trade, organized labor, the
 District of Columbia Board of Commis-
 sioners,  U.S.  Department  of        Labor,
 League of Women Voters, religious and
 neighborhood organizations  and the
 press for supporting much needed im-
 provements in. existing minimum wage
 and hqurs conditions in the District of
 Columbia.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to he printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 committee  has been  conducting  hearings.
 But the principle behind these bills seems
 to us both simple and clear.  A large num-
 ber of people in this Capital City are work-
 ing for less than a minimum,living wage.
 That condition should not     be allowed to
 continue.
 The country is now thoroughly committed
 to minimum-wage laws. Four years ago Con-
 gress fixed the Federal minimum wage at
 $1.25 per hour, although some of the groups
 covered by that law will not reap the full
 measure of its benefits until the coming fall.
 In these circumstances it would be highly
 unreasonable to talk of a lower minimum
 in this center of high living costs.  On the
 other hand, it is estimated that at least 100,-
 000 employees in the District are not covered
 by any minimum wage law at present and
 the wages of some are far below the $1.25
 figure.   In these circumstances,  a figure
 above  $1.25  per  hour for local  industries
 would seem to be premature.
 Both the Multer bill and the District Com-
 missioners' bill would, therefore, accept the
 $1.25 figure as the goal to be attained.   As
 previously amended by the subcommittee,
 however, the Multer bill would exclude from
 -coverage more than 50,000 hourly employes
 and delay the full effectiveness of the $1.25
 floor for some until 1968.  Far more desir-
 able is the Commissioners' plan of compre-
 hensive coverage and adjustment to the Fed-
 eral minimum within 6 months.
 The  Commissioners' recommendation  is
 similar to the bill passed by the Senate last
 year.  It cannot be regarded as drastic. If
 the net result Is to increase the cost of serv-
 ices now being rendered in hospitals, nursing
 homes, some educational  institutions and
 so forth, the recipients of such services will
 have to make the necessary adjustments. It
 is not sound policy to subsidize such agen-
 cies through the payment of less than a liv-
 ing wage.
 Another important provision of the Com-
 missioners' bill would allow them to adjust
 the $1.25 minimum wage to keep abreast of
 living costs,  fair  compensation and  com-
 parable work standards.   Minimum wages
 should not be static while prices and eoo-
 nomic conditions are constantly changing.
 It is necessary of course to relate the changes
 that can be made to specific finding on the
 part of administrative officials, but allow-
 ance for improvement as the economy itself
 improves should be regarded as vital.
 This bill is a necessary part of the Presi-
 dent's antipoverty program.  It would be
 Ironic indeed if a Congress which seems de-
 dioated to the elimination of poverty else-
 where should remain indifferent to the pay-
 ment of starvation wages in the Nation's
 Capital.

 that are of concern not alone to the
 Pacific Northwest but to each State in
 the American Union, as well..
 I ask unanimous consent that the en-

 SPEECH BY SENATOR LEN B. JORDAN BEFORE THE
 PACIFIC NORTHWEST TRADE ASSOCIATION
 PORTLAND MEETING ON "WATER-THE ULTI-
 MATE RESOURCE," APRIL 13, 1965
 I am pleased to participate with the mem-
 bers of the Pacific Northwest Trade Associa-
 tion In this, your 53d conference, on the im-
 portant subject of water.
 Your fine organization is commended for
 the excellent public service it has rendered
 -back through the years in providing a forum
 for discussion of current problems.
 This is the third time I have been priv-
 ileged to speak to you and I sincerely hope
 that my remarks here today will be of inter-
 est to you.
 Water is more than a natural resource-it
 is a necessity of life.  Here in the United
 States we have lived more than 200 years
 before the water problem became generally
 acute.  But the uses we make of water in
 modern society are so tremendous that they
 stagger the imagination.
 The  coming of  our  industrial  era, the
 raising of our living standards, and the in-
 creased application of water to land have
 now highlighted the problems until in much
 of the Nation there is grave and increasing
 concern over water resources.
 Planning for the development of water re-
 sources has undergone a marked evolution
 during the past 50 years. At the turn of the
 century the use of water resources was
 planned largely on a single-purpose, single-
 project, single-agency basis.  Too frequently
 other equally important uses of water were
 overlooked. This was because no agency was
 authorized to plan for comprehensive devel-
 opment.  Each carried out its specific func-
 tion as prescribed by law.
 The  local  people,  through  established
 agencies, such as State water resource boards
 and/or interstate  compact      commissions
 should have an effective voice, along with
 the Federal agencies in this planning which
 would recognize and properly weigh all the
 varied and sometimes contrary programs af-
 fected by the proposed development of water
 resources.
 Here in' the Northwest we are especially
 favored with an abundance--sometimes a
 superabundance-of potable water.  This is
 not to say that our water is always available
 in the right place at the right time.  The
 problems of distribution are always with us.
 How  to  capture  nature's  rainfall on our
 watersheds and then by proper storage and
 supply management mold this water resource
 to best achieve its multipurpose benefits is
 a real challenge, but one that Is richly re-
 warding.  These multipurpose benefits must
 include domestic,  industrial,  reclamation,
 power, navigation, recreation and fish and
 wildlife. No longer can we tolerate single
 purpose planning.
 One basic point I wish to emphasize early     mittees indicates that some 13 million aver-
 in this statement is the interdependence of                                                                       age kilowatts of hydroelectric power can be
 land and water.  Any serious study or plan-   developed in the U.S. portion of the Colum-
 ning for one must necessarily and inevitably                                                                        bia River Basin that will be cheaper than an

 velopment depends first of all on a healthy,                                                                             velopment will be in the State of Washington
 well-maintained watershed.  This is of pri-   or on its boundary.  Yet the watersheds of
 mary Importance.                              the State of Washington will supply but a
 Afghanistan investigating the economic feas-
 ibility of a large reclamation development.
 There I found that centuries of watershed
 abuse had first removed all of the timber
 from the slopes and the higher elevations.
 Overgrazing had contributed to the destruc-
 tion of the brush and grass cover, leaving in-
 sufficient vegetation to retard the  runoff.
 Erosion was inevitable and devastating al-
 most  beyond  belief.  Soil  movement had
 bared the hillsides to berdock so that there
 was little more runoff retardation than from
 the_roof of a building.
 Masonry arched bridges perhaps a quarter
 of a mile long stood stark and desolate in
 the desert, mute evidence to the fact that
 a rampaging river had dammed its own chan-
 nel by lodging debris against the bridge piers
 and then cutting a new channel as if in
 defiance of man's effort to contain it.  At
 flood stage the river was a monster out of
 control.  In the heat of summer when water
 was most needed the river would shrink to a
 docile, sluggish stream, an altogether inade-
 quate fraction of its flood stage.
 In Afghanistan I have seen drifting sand
 dunes uncover the houses of a village that
 was once the center of an irrigated agricul-
 tural community.  Here are the ghosts of a
 civilization that perished for lack of water-
 a silent indictment of man's refusal to ob-
 serve sound conservation practice.
 This is where I learned more of the im-
 portance of watershed protection against
 complete ruination.  Here it was indelibly
 printed in my mind that we cannot take for
 granted that water will always be available
 downstream, no matter how we abuse the
 watershed upstream.
 In the Columbia basin most of the water-
 shed is federally owned.  This poses a real
 problem  because ,the  funds  available  for
 Watershed protection on public lands are not
 adequate.  Moreover, funds which provide
 technical assistance to private landowners
 for soil conservation have been substantially
 reduced in the administration's budget.
 In order to protect our watersheds, some-
 time in the not too distant future, it may be
 necessary to levy against power sales for
 headwater conservation purposes, Including
 additional storage.  A very small assessment
 per kilowatt-hour on all power sold, public,
 private, Federal and non-Federal alike could
 provide  a  fund    to  keep  the  watersheds
 healthy. A prudent businessman employs
 similar methods to protect his long-range
 interest. No less prudent should be our
 approach to sound conservation and water-
 shed protection.
 A second point I wish to make is that there
 is no single uniform policy, no magic formula
 relating to water resources which can be ap-
 plied to all parts of the country at all times
 and in all places.  The problems Involve par-
 ticular needs and uses of water from State
 to State, from basin to basin, and from region
 to region.
 While it is generally sound to plan coordi-
 nated development of water resources by
 large river basin areas, it is possible to place
 too much importance on this concept with-
 out giving full consideration to the States as
 small part of the water that passes through
 these main-stem turbines,
 Washington  watersheds  contribute  less
 than 3 percent of the water at Grand Coulee,
 8 percent of the water at Chief Joseph, and
 13 percent of the water at McNary. Thus,
 most of the water originates on upstream
 watersheds, but the downstream reclamation
 projects receive a lion's share of the benefits.
 Simple equity would call for a sharing of
 downstream benefits with upstream States
 which supply the water.
 Insofar as upstream Canada is concerned
 the United States-Canada treaty gives rec-
 ognition to the contribution that will be
 made by yet-to-be-built Canadian storage.
 A cash payment of more than one-quarter-
 billion dollars has been made by the United
 States to Canada.  This will pay for Canada's
 entitlement to a share of increased produc-
 tion at U.S. plants downstream made pos-
 sible by Canadian storage for a 30-year peri-
 od.  Bear in mind that not 1 gallon of new
 water will be added to the Columbia.  What
 will be accomplished is a partial regulation
 of the streamfiow, storing the flood peaks,
 and releasing the water when normal stream
 flows are lowest.  In addition Canada wil
 receive $64 million for flood control benefit
 to the United States.
 This treaty is a great step  forward  it
 river basin planning.  As a former Chairmar
 of the U.S. section of the International Join
 Commission, I was privileged to work on tht
 early stages of the Columbia Treaty and
 know first hand the months and years of as-
 sembling the basic data which preceded the
 additional months and years of hard bargain-
 ing.  The significant fact is that an accord
 was reached and consummated in a treaty
 thus indicating, at the international level,
 a meeting of trained minds as to the value of
 upstream watershed and storage resources.
 Likewise the upstream watershed and stor-
 age resources of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,
 and Oregon make a contribution similar to,
 and perhaps even greater than, that to be
 made by Canada.
 Now someone will probably challenge this
 comparison on the basis that much of the
 U.S. headwater storage is for reclamation and
 that part of this water is consumptively used.
 The answer is that the purpose of upstream
 storage is to capture the floods or at near
 the source and to release the stored waters
 as needed.
 Irrigation accomplishes this purpose ad-
 mirably.  Even the water that is lost by
 transpiration or evaporation is returned in
 the form of added precipitation.  Only that
 small part which becomes a part of the plant
 Is truly lost.
 In Idaho, on the Snake River alone, we
 have between 8 and 9 million acre-feet of
 storage now through reclamation projects.
 Two-thirds of this water returns to the Snake
 River during its low flows.  Thus, by shap-
 ing and improving the runoff pattern, rec-
 lamation contributes substantial flood con-
 trol benefits and hydropower benefits as well.
 At the present time no provision is made
 for upstream States to share in downstream
 benefits and there is no provision in the law
 for such a sharing.  Nor is there any provi-

 VIETNAMESE ARMY NOT  STRONG ENOUGH To
 COPE  WITH VIETCONG
 (Third of a series)
 (By J. A. Dear)
 SAIGON, VIETNAM.-NO American out here
 faults the fighting spirit of Vietnamese Army
 troops (Arvin).
 on more than one occasion Arvin troops
 have continued attacking until wiped out.
 And remember, this is an army that is under-
 fed, underled, seldom, paid, gets no leave.
 Its nine regular divisions are served by 500
 doctors; that means there are only 200 doc-
 tors to care for a civil population of 16
 million.
 13aving said this, the truth can be set
 forth.  Arvin  is  riddled  with  Vietcong
 agents; staff work is very poor; there is no
 personnel setup at all except for the bureau
 of psychology warfare, which should be con-
 cerned with the enemy.  Some political gen-
 erals are incompetent,. but the most serious
 shortage is of qualified junior officers.  Ap-
 proximately  one-third       of  the                                companies
 composing Arvin are shaky. Above all, there
 Simply are not enough government troops In
 theileld to cope with the Vietcong.
 REPLACEMENTS WERE FEW
 Part of the trouble has its origin in Saigon.
 As a result of the coups and demicoups,
 Arvin received almost no replacements until
 recently.             Because  about 40,000 men were
 lo ge  in ,operations,          this  means  a  badly
 wfSUi'Itled, Arvin had to face an enemy that
 has been' continually nourished by supplies
 and men from the North.
 The first coup, which led to the murder of
 Diem, had the greatest impact.  During the
 sorry interval between Diem's death and the
 present regime of Dr. Quat, effective govern-
 ment came to a stop.  Since. this is a politi-

 evolved, and he is sure military leaders ap-
 preciate the importance of governmental
 stability.
 At  present  there  is no  single  military
 strong man on the scene.      Big Minh of the
 first coup may return, but a five-member
 armed forces council now advises Dr. Quat.
 KY IS COLORFUL COMMANDER
 General Ky, colorful commander of Viet-
 nam's air force, is one of the most important
 members of the council.  General Thi, com-
 mander of I Corps, is an influential general
 though not a member of the council.  Gen-
 eral Co of II Corps, called "dancing master"
 because of his fondness for this pastime, is
 another  name  to  remember. Incidentally,
 Co's acute criticism of the deployment of
 the Special Forces led to the development of
 new tactics.
 The traditional enmity of the Vietnamese
 and Montagnard has caused serious trouble
 in the central highlands. Saigon has made
 concessions, but not before Y B'Ham Enoul,
 former  Saigon  deputy  in  the  highlands,
 skipped to Cambodia after fomenting an
 abortive uprising.
 Most encouraging of all, said Dr. puat, is
 that "your country has settled on a policy
 for Vietnam, for a month ago you had none."
 ASSUMPTIONS  ARE  PLAYING  THEIR  ROLE  IN
 SOUTHEAST ASIA BATTLE
 (Fourth of a series)
 (By J. A. Dear)
 SAIGON,     VIETNAM.-What are the consid-
 erations and thinking on which our policy
 here is based?
 These are the assumptions: Southeast Asia
 is vital to American security.  If Vietnam
 falls            to          Communist  aggression,  southeast
 Asia is lost.
 In spite of obvious apathy to the war, the
 people of South Vietnam are by no means
 committed to the Communist regime in the
 north.                       There are hostilities between these
 regions we can exploit.
 Likewise, there are differences between the
 Tokinese and Chinese that can be exploit-
 ed.   Even the most ardent Communist in
 Ho Chi Minh's government probably hopes
 North Vietnam can escape Chinese occupa-
 tion.
 Ho Chi Minh is indeed dependent on Red
 China.   But to give his regime room for
 maneuver he plays Peiping against Moscow.
 If we hit him too hard, we push him into
 the hands of the Chinese.  If we don't hit
 him hard enough, he has no incentive for
 easing his campaign against Vietnam.
 If we threaten the destruction of Ho Chi
 Minh, we practically assure intervention by
 the Russians and the Chinese.  Because of
 the parities of the situation, Moscow can-
 not stand on the sidelines if a Socialist state
 is threateded with destruction.
 EQUATION CHANGES EVERY DAY
 Thus, the air strikes against North Viet-
 nam involve nice calculations.  Further, the
 TRIP TAKES ABOUT 60 DAYS
 It is agreed that a Communist trooper
 from the North will not reach I Corps or II
 Corps,  the  northern  military  districts  of
 Vietnam, in less than 30 days.   Probably the
 trip takes about 60 days.
 Now, what is the capacity of the Ho Chi
 Minh trail?  One estimate is 1,000 men and
 40 tons of equipment per month.      Consider-
 ing the nature of the country, this does not
 seem unreasonable, though some say it is too
 low by half.
 It is admitted that anyone who has trav-
 eled the trail must rest up before combat.
 Also, Communist arms and men reach Viet-
 nam by sea.
 But this aid-and here we are back to as-
 sumption-is crucial.  Without it the Viet-
 cong would lose vital momentum and the
 Saigon Government would triumph.
 That  is  the  rationale  underlying  our
 policy,
 THERE IS A WEAPON WE HAVE YET To USE IN
 VIETNAM: FOOD
 (Fifth of a series)
 (By J. A. Dear)
 SAIGON,  VIETNAM.-Nothing  is lost until
 it is lost, in my opinion, unless you walk
 away.
 In a nutshell, that's my thought about
 the miserable war.
 Also, the other guy has  real  problems.
 Suppose you had to group 1,000 men for a
 battle 100 miles away, knowing that your
 communications were poor, that'you didn't
 control the roads or the air, that your only
 transport was manback, that    equipment
 had to be toted piecemeal, that your secur-
 ity hinged on the silence of everyone in vil-
 lages your men had to sleep in, that your
 enemy could mobilize murderous firepower
 in minutes, and that you would face anni-
 hilation if caught in the open country?. Well,
 that's the way it is for the Vietcong.
 PROBLEMS OF OWN MAKING
 For all that, we have problems too, and
 some of them of our own making.  The most
 serious  is  that  which  results from  our
 decision to embrace a strategy of terror.
 That's what bombing is.  It doesn't dis-
 criminate between  soldiers and/or women
 and children.  Especially, I have in mind
 American air strikes in South Vietnam.  We
 are  killing  innocents almost  every   day.
 (Twenty-three structures and five water buf-
 falo were destroyed, etc.)
 Morality aside, can you think of a worse
 way to win the hearts and minds of people
 in a political war?  Neither can I.
 If we must be terrorists, let's be effective.
 And there is a weapon at hand we have not
 touched. Food.
 NO WHEAT WITH A-BOMB
 The technical achievements of the Com-
 munist world, including Red China, are im-
 pressive.                                                                                                                                                                              But you can't grow wheat with an

 Red China has the A-bomb, but not the
 wheat.  At least she wouldn't have the wheat
 if Australia and Canada didn't sell it to her.
 Why not stop this trade, if necessary by
 buying the entire wheat surplus of these
 allies? An accommodation with China might
 then be possible.
 And we could abandon the strategy of ter-
 ror that manufactures islands of humanity
 humming with hate and fear of Americans.
 COULD HELP ECONOMY
 At the same time, we could be breathing
 life into the economy of Vietnam, which is a
 surplus food country.  Through Hong Kong,
 the showcase for Red China, go the water
 chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and so forth, that
 Chinese expatriates everywhere love.  Viet-
 nam could fulfill this need, given the chance,
 We could do ourselves a good. turn in Viet-
 nam. by becoming interested In education.
 That is what brought us victory in the Phil-
 ippines, but the lesson has been forgotten.
 In Danang I saw a French Lycee.  But no-
 where in Vietnam did I see an American
 school.  If our interest is long term, why
 don't we think about schools and teachers?
 SCHOOLS IN SAIGON
 At the moment it would be impossible to
 establish American schools In the hinter-
 lands.                    But a start could be made by bring-
 ing bright teenagers, with their parents' per-
 mission, to a first-rate academy in Saigon.
 Though it will go against our Army's grain,
 we should consider lengthening the tour of
 our personnel here to 2 years.  As I have
 said, we have never fielded a finer team
 than that we have in Vietnam,   But consid-
 ering the time                                  for phase in and phase
 out, personnel spend only 9 months in action.
 By the time they have a grasp of the situa-
 tion, they're up for reassignment.  True, this
 system spreads                  counterinsurgency  experi-
 ence through the services.  But it's victory,
 not experience, that we're after.
 Finally, a word about the posture of the
 West in the Far East. Resorts in Formosa

 Journalists  of  the  Philippines  paint a
 different picture of Red China.  It is a moral
 country, and its cities are unbelievably clean
 for Asia.  In the battle for minds and hearts,
 this counts.
 It would be a pity if our great country gets
 lost in the thoroughfares of life by forgetting
 this simple fact.

 TO VIETNAMESE FARMER, WAR IS BELL
 (By J. A. Dear)
 ToKYo.-One reason so many Japanese are
 so critical of our Vietnam policy is that our
 effort to save the Saigon government from
 Communist aggression is not saving the peo-
 ple and their society from destruction.
 The likelihood that what is to be saved by
 war will be destroyed in the process is a
 favorite irony of history.  England entered
 the Second War to save Poland from Nazi
 Germany with the result that Poland became
 a fief of Moscow.
 To understand what the war is doing to
 Vietnam, it is first necessary to consider the
 economy of the rural areas.  About 70 per-
 cent of the farmers in Vietnam work hold-
 ings, which they do not always own, of less
 than 12 acres.  Of the farmers who do own
 their lands, about 65 percent own less than
 12 acres.
 In the delta, the richest agricultural area
 of Vietnam, between 60 and 70 percent of
 thefarmers are now in debt, and probably
 are falling deeper in debt every month.  The
 plight of Farmer Tran Vannam,  cited by.
 Kenkichi Konishi of the Mainichi newspapers
 is typical.
 The Tran family of six owns a delta farm
 of about 5 acres.  They once owned a much
 larger farm, but gave it up because of the
 Vietcong.   About  3  acres  of  the  present
 farm  are   under  rice.  The  other  2 acres
 had flourishing fruit trees, but these were
 cut down to enable Government forces to
 protect a bridge more easily.
 Farmer Tran was not reimbursed by the
 Government for the loss of these trees.  His
 family is able to live off the land, he sells
 the balance of his rice crop, and ekes out
 his existence in the off season by working as
 a laborer in the village.  His total effort pro-
 duces a yearly cash income for the family of
 18,000 plasters-about $122.
 INFLATION HURTS PIASTER
 At this point it must be noted that in
 theory $230 is the dollar equivalent of 18,000
 piasters.                  But inflation-war-has destroyed
 the integrity of the piaster.  During the time
 I was in Vietnam the dollar equivalent value
 of the piaster decreased 7.8 percent.   For
 families that must limit monthly purchases
 to an average of $4 this is murderous.
 But the picture really is worse than painted
 thus far, for Tran's princely income of $122
 yearly doesn't come in at the rate of $10
 per month.  In most months the income is
 about $2.25. So he has to borrow, and the
 going interest rate is from 5 to 10 percent a
 month.
 He is already in debt to the Government
 and to other members of his family.  Thus
 the prospects of additional debt is frighten-
 ing, so frightening in fact that he often sells
 rice futures to escape the high interest rate.
 But he is caught, anyhow, because he can't
 get a decent price on these sales.
 FACES FINANCIAL DISASTER
 Of course, any serious sickness is cata-
 strophic to a man as close to the cloth as
 Tran, and he has tuberculosis.  The medi-
 cines he must buy drive him nearer financial
 disaster.                  Still, he Is an optimist.
 He dreams of another orchard that will
 make his small farm profitable again.  In 5
 or 6 years he hopes to be out of debt. He is
 hard working, literate, anxious that his chil-
 dren be educated, in every way a worthy man.
 In happier times he might make it.     Times
 being what they are, he will die.
 Tran is tough.   Many others have long
 since succumbed to despair.  Remember, the
 Delta is a fortunate region.
 PEOPLE ARE WELL OFF
 Parts of it are controlled by the Viet-
 cong, and have been for a long time.  But
 the people of these areas cannot be better
 off.                     Government forces, backed by Ameri-
 can personnel and technology, are powerful
 enough to destroy the  economic viability
 of any Vietcong area.  Thus all of rural
 Vietnam is an area where the forces of the
 government and the Vietcong wage a fero-
 cious war in a sea of human misery.  Every
 day wavelets of misery wash into the over-
 crowded villages and cities, multiplying the
 danger of epidemic disease, drowning hope.
 If the Communists win Vietnam, Red China.
 will be encouraged to go after Laos, Cam-
 bodia, Siam, Burma, and . Indonesia.                                                                             And
 what is to stop them?
 Surely   no  national  leader  in his  right
 senses will ever again be anxious to save his
 country  from  Communist  aggression      by
 fighting a  war in  his   country that  will
 destroy it. Not after the lesson of Vietnam.
 That is  one   reason why     the airstrikes
 against  North Vietnam make   sense.     The
 Communist leaders will not be as ready to
 embark on their adventures if it is brought
 home to them that all the damage will not
 be confined to the country in which they
 choose to wage war, that their own lands
 will be devastated.
 For too long now Red China has been per-
 mitted to forget a simple fact: War is hell.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, April 19, 1965
 Mr. YOUNGER.  Mr. Speaker, on
 April 2, former Vice President Richard
 M. Nixon addressed the Commonwealth
 Club of California on the subject of
 "Vietnam."  Excerpts from that speech,
 as published by the Commonwealth, fol-
 low:
 "STOP  REDS  IN VIETNAM  OR FACE  BIG  WAR
 FOR    PHILLIPPINES  4 YEARS      HENCE," SAYS
 NIXON
 (From address by Hon. Richard M. Nixon,
 former Vice President of the United States)
 Today the most difficult decision facing
 President Johnson is South        Vietnam, the
 most difficult decision he will make during
 his Presidency, I believe, at home or abroad.
 And it is the most important decision for
 the United States and the free world.
 There are times when the loyal opposition
 should support an administration.  Lyndon
 B. Johnson needs this support not only be-
 cause of the validity of his policy but be-
 cause there is a deep division in his own
 party.
 Our greatest danger to the future of our
 policy on Vietnam is because the Democratic
 party is divided. Forty-five Democratic Sen-
 ators have indicated opposition.
 -  UNITED STATES DEFENDS WORLD-AGAIN
 The interests of America, the free world
 and of South Vietnam are being served by
 the present policy.
 Some claim the United States has no legal
 right in South Vietnam and that we are in-
 volved in a civil war.   Some say the war
 will not be won because the Vietnamese are
 not willing to do what is necessary.
 Others believe that, even if the war could
 be won, the risks are too great.  Many sug-
 gest  another  way  out-negotiation-neu-
 tralization.
 Lyndon Johnson should answer each of
 these objections now.  He might well have
 done this before now.  Not enough people
 know why we should support  the  South
 Vietnamese.
 First, who is responsible for the war? If
 it were not for support of the Guerrillas by
 North Vietnam there would be no war; no
 war, at least, which would require our sup-
 port.                                                                                                                          If it were not for Chinese support
 for North Vietnam there would be no war
 requiring American support.
 COMMUNIST CHINA THE REAL FOE
 This is a confrontation-not fundamentally
 between Vietnam and the Vietcong or be-
 tween the United States and the Vietcong-
 but between the United States and Com-
 munist China.
 This must not be glossed over because if
 we gloss it over we underestimate the risks
 and do not understand the stakes.
 Those, who question our presence ignore
 certain facts.   In  1954  a convention  was
 signed in Geneva guaranteeing South Viet-
 nam                                                                                                                          its  independence.         The  North  Viet-
 namese are there as lawbreakers.  We are

 there as law enforcers, by invitation of the
 South Vietnamese Government.
 What are the risks, the stakes?  First, the
 fate of 15 million Vietnamese. Two hundred
 thousand Vietnamese casualties in the fight
 against communism over the years, prove
 they have the desire and will to keep their
 country free and independent.
 NEED FUNDAMENTALS
 In Vietnam today there is determination
 of the people to save their freedom-provided
 they have the conviction they will win.
 These  are  fundamental  reasons  the
 stronger course of action will be more effec-
 tive than may seem today.
 Fifteen million people are worth saving
 but many argue that this is not enough to
 risk major confrontation and Chinese Com,
 munist intervention.
 If South Vietnam falls, through U.S. with-
 drawal,. political settlement, or neutraliza-
 tion (which is surrender on the installment
 plan) ,  there  is  no  doubt  that  Cambodia
 (already` on the, brink)  will go; that Laos,
 practically gone now because 'of our gulli-
 bility, will go; that Thailand (which wants
 to be on our side but has held her inde-
 peridence by being on the winning side) will
 go; that Burma, an economic basket case;
 and that Indonesia will go.
 SUKARNO'S OVERRIPE MELON
 Indonesia will follow Sukarno and Sukarno
 once 'said that because of the American fail-
 ure in Asia, the Communists were the wave
 of the future and he would be on the win-
 ning side.
 Indonesia has half the world's tin, half the
 world's rubber.  It is only  14 miles from
 the Philippines where  guerrillas and Huk
 activity have begun again-guerrilla activity
 easily supported  by   Indonesian  Commu-
 nists.
 In 3 or 4 years, then, we would have the
 necessity of saving the Philippines. Could
 we avoid a major war to save the Philippines?
 Japan is the biggest prize in Asia, a
 miracle of-economic recovery, the only pos-
 sible   economic   counterpart   to                          China.
 Strong neutralist forces are now growing in
 Japan.  If southeast Asia goes Communist,
 Japan will eventually be pulled irresistably
 into the Red orbit.
 If the United States gives up on Vietnam,
 Asia will give up on the United States and
 the Pacific will become a Red sea.  These
 are the stakes.  And this is the reason the
 Johnson administration has decided to win
 in Vietnam-no more, no less.
 AGAINST RED COLONIALISM
 The possibilities of winning?  How could
 it be possible that, where 300,000 French-
 men on the ground failed, 25,000 Americans
 can expect success?  But when the French
 were in Vietnam they were fighting to stay
 in-while the United States is, fighting to
 get out.
 The Vietnamese had very little interest in
 fighting to preserve French colonialism.  The
 Vietnamese have a very great interest in
 fighting  against  Communist              colonialism.
 That's why they    fight  with  a will today.
 THAT RISK OR GREATER RISK?
 Risks must always be weighed.  There is
 a risk of Russian intervention.           This risk is
 small due to the logistic problems involved,
 and because the Soviets are not, particularly
 interested in seeing the Chinese Communists
 succeed in their foreign policy objectives for
 Asia.
 A greater risk is Chinese Communist inter-
 vention.  Some say this is inevitable, that
 the Chinese Communists would come in to
 save North. Vietnam from defeat.  That is
 subject to serious question.
 Comparing the situation now with Korea
 in 1950, there are major differences.  Now
 Russia and Communist China are opponents.
 Then they were allies.
 China without Russia Is a fourth-rate
 military power.  And that is the situation
 China must confront-if it decides to inter-
 vene.  That. is probably the reason Commu-
 nist China. Is talking big but acting little,
 without risking a confrontation with the
 United States, at this point, over Vietnam.
 Adding it all, we must assume that Com-
 munist China might intervene.  What should
 our decision be, weighing that risk and that
 possibility?  It must be the same, because
 it is a choice not between that risk and no
 risk-but that risk and a greater risk.
 NINE PINS IF UNITED STATES PULLS OUT
 In the event that Vietnam falls, and in
 the event that the balance of southeast Asia
 falls, in 4 to 5 years, ties United States would
 be confronted inevitably with a war to save
 the Philippines or in some other area in
 Asia and we would be confronting a China
 stronger than she is now.  China today is
 diplomatically and militarily  weaker than
 she will ever be in the future.
 Today China has a minimal nuclear ca-
 pability but that capability increases daily.
 It is a risk we must weigh. Do we stop Chi-
 nese Communist aggression in Vietnam now
 or wait until the odds and the risks are much
 greater?
 The United States must make a decision
 as to what our goals are to be.  Our goals
 are presently limited to winning the war,
 without  unconditional  surrender,  without
 destroying North Vietnam, without destroy-
 ing Communist China.                                                                                    It is a limited ob-
 jective but one which must be achieved.
 ROAD OF "GOOD INTENTIONS"
 What are the alternatives?  Many well-
 intentioned people have suggested, Why not
 negotiate?  Negotiation is a good word.  All
 wars are endet by negotiation. But to nego-
 tiate now wound mean that the United States
 could  negotiate  only  surrender, coalition
 government, a division of South Vietnam or
 neutralization, which is surrender on the in-
 stallment plan.
 Negotiating  with  the  Communists    now
 would be like negotiating with Hitler when
 he had France practically occupied.
 We  must     negotiate  independence  and
 freedom for Vietnam.       We cannot do that
 now.   Once we have gained the military ad-
 vantage, once North Vietnam and Commu-
 nist China are convinced they cannot take
 over South Vietnam, then we can negotiate
 the freedom  and  independence  of  South
 Vietnam.  Until then, we cannot.
 Neutralization? Neutralism, where Com-
 munists are concerned, means only three
 things: we get in, we get out; they stay in,
 and they take over.  That is why we can't
 agree to a neutralization of South Vietnam.
 The choice we have is to get out completely
 or to stay in until we achieve freedom and
 independence for Vietnam.
 The future  is our main problem.   The
 world has been given the impression that
 this is our war; that we are there unilater-
 ally for our own selfish purposes.  We are
 there for our purposes, true,  but we are
 there because the freedom of all Asia, not
 just Vietnam, is involved.
 NIXON PROPOSES ASIAN COUNTERFORCE
 Several suggestions can be made for fu-
 ture policy.  Once "the war is won in Viet-
 nam, we must recognize that it will only be
 the winning of a single battle as far as the
 Communists are concerned.
 It took Mao 20 years to conquer China.
 This is Mao Tse-tung's theory of a long war.
 He lost many battles, but he won the long
 war.   If  Vietnam is lost to  Communist
 China, the long war will be stepped up in
 Indonesia or somewhere else.
 There must be a counterforce, an alterna-
 tive to Mao's long war.  Let me make sev-
 eral suggestions.  There is no question as to
 Communist  China's  purpose  and  plan.
 A1913
 They have one, and they are determined.
 But free Asia does not have a plan. It does
 not, have- a purpose.  It is necessary to mo-
 bilize free Asia's economic and military re-
 sources so there will be the lasting alterna-
 tive of peace under freedom as against the
 long war of communism.
 JOHNSON PROPOSAL INCOMPLETE
 President Johnson started down this road
 when he suggested an Asian economic plan.
 Let's go further;  we need a conference of
 free Asian nations, including South Viet-
 nam,                                                                                                                                                                      Cambodia, Laos,  Thailand,  Malaysia,
 Burma, Indonesia, Taiwan, the Philippines,
 Japan, South Korea, and possibly Australia
 and New Zealand.
 Such a conference would have three major
 objectives:                           One,  economic     development-a
 Marshall plan for Asia; a Marshall plan in-
 volving industrial development, free trade
 areas,  and  all  other  aspects which                            mean
 economic development for the whole area.
 Thee difficulty is in stopping there                             and
 that is all that is suggested  by the ad-
 ministration.  Economic strength  alone  is
 not  enough  to    stop  communism, for in
 South  Vietnam,  economic                                   conditions are
 much better than in the North.
 Second, in Europe, the Marshall plan could
 not have succeeded economically unless it
 had the NATO military shield.  There needs
 to be a military alliance of free Asian na-
 tions to stop any Communist aggression
 against freedom.
 The third step is to meet the problem
 of  indirect  aggression.  There should  be
 something like the Caracas resolution of 1954
 that in event of a revolution with Commu-
 nist-support from abroad (as in Vietnam),
 all nations involved would band together to
 resist conquest by indirect aggression.
 Now that we've stepped up military ac-
 tivity in Vietnam, we need to step up our
 diplomatic offensive in all of Asia.
 We need a charter for freedom for the
 Pacific-an alternative to the seeming in-
 evitability, at least to many in Asia, of Chi-
 nese Communist domination.
 MOBILIZE FREE ASIA'S ECONOMY
 Often overlooked today is the fact that
 the economic power of the nations cited Is
 twice as great, as that of Communist China
 today-if it can be mobilized, if it can be
 united; if the United States can support it.
 There is no question but that this could
 be the great step forward which would stop
 Chinese Communist aggression and the in-
 evitable takeover of the heartland and pe-
 ripheral areas of Asia as well.
 I spoke of the stakes-southeast Asia, Ja-
 pan, the Pacific-but they're much greater
 than that.  A great debate is going on in
 the Communist world and what happens in
 Vietnam will determine its course.  The de-
 bate is between the hardliners in Peiping
 and the so-called softliners in Moscow.  The
 _softliners (oversimplified), because of a risk
 of  confrontation with  the  United  States,
 are not supporting revolutions to the same
 extent that they did.   The hardliners say
 "we must step up our tactics and support of
 revolution all over the world."
 In the event the hardliners succeed in Viet-
 nam, that will be the green light for aggres-
 sion in Africa, Latin America-all over the
 world.  If they are stopped in Vietnam, that
 will be a lesson just as Korea was a lesson
 on the use of overt aggression.
 It will be a lesson to the Communists at-
 tempting to take over a nation through in-
 direct aggression that the United States and
 the free world have an answer to it.
 So what is involved here is not just Asia,
 but a battle for the whole world and because
 that is so, risks must be taken-risks which,
 I believe, in the long run will bring peace
 and freedom.  But the alternatives could be
 war and loss of freedom.
 In 1938, immediately after Munich, Win-
 ston Churchill said: "The belief that you can

 gain security by throwing a small state to
 the wolves is a fatal delusion." He was right
 about Czechoslovakia in ' 1938.  And today,
 with regard to Vietnam, the belief that we
 can gain security by throwing a small state
 to the wolves is a fatal delusion.  In this
 year when we honor Churchill the man, we
 will do well to heed Churchill's principles.
 ANSWERS TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS FROM FLOOR
 Question. Will you be a candidate in 1968?
 Answer. The Republican Party must get
 off the floor fighting.  But Republicans must
 fight Democrats and not each other.   To
 win in 1966 the party must be unified. Un-
 til we get the party off the floor, don't talk
 of-1968.
 Question  (William Nigh). Use of gas in
 Vietnam?
 Answer. Under the circumstances it was
 proper.  But when the President said he was
 not aware of its use he gave impression we
 were wrong to use it, and that field com-
 manders could make decisions of this conse-
 quence without his knowledge.  He should
 have said: (1) This was not gas used in World
 Wars I or II which nations have opposed;
 (2) it was used not by United States, but by
 Vietnam; (3) it was used in attacks on vil-
 lages In which Vietnamese could not tell who
 were guerrillas and who the guerrillas' vic-
 tims;  (4). so instead of blasting out friends
 and foes indiscriminately, Vietnamese used
 tear gas so they could separate guerrillas
 from loyal citizens.  It was humane warfare
 and President should have said so.
 Question. (W. F. Bramstedt). Can we win
 without a major land war?
 Answer. Depends on the extent to which
 the Chinese Communists choose to inter-
 vene.  They are basically cautious in military
 policy-=e.g., could have taken all India but
 they stopped.  I don't believe the Chinese
 will intervene. Strategically and logistically,
 this is no Korean type of war.  We must as-
 sume the risk.               Some think China should be
 recognized and taken  into the U.N.  Chi-
 nese communism is in its aggressive, virulent
 stage.  The Soviet Union was not tempered
 in its foreign policy by entrance into the
 U.N. It has been tempered only by the power
 of NATO and the U.S. confrontation in Cuba.
 Question. (J. C. Russell). Johnson admin-
 istration now doing what Goldwater advo-
 cated?
 Answer. It's easy to say "I told you so."
 Johnson needs Republican support, he has
 been learning a lot since the campaign-but
 we don't want him to learn so much he gets
 reelected.
 Question.  (R. J. Jajalich). What if the
 United States asked to leave?  (Col. James S.
 Hughes). Effects of Diem's murder?
 Answer. If any future government gets in
 through a coup or anything but as repre-
 sentativesof the people--and if it's pro-Com-
 munist-we should stay in.  Murder of Diem
 was a major U.S. mistake. Diem and his
 family were sometimes crosses to bear but
 since 1956 he had stood strongly with the
 United States.  We supported the coup but
 did not expect him to be murdered.  You
 can't set such things in motion. A free Asian
 leader told me shortly after Diem's death:
 "It is dangerous to be a friend of the United
 States-it pays to be a neutral and some-
 times helps to be an enemy."  U.S. policy-
 makers must understand that American-style
 Cemocracy  is  not  necessarily the  answer
 where traditions are different.
 Question. (Ivor R.  Parrott). De Gaulle's
 attitude on Vietnam question?
 Answer. De Gaulle's attitude is first French
 and then European: (1) If you were French
 would you want to see the United States suc-
 ceed where you had failed?  (2) Europeans
 see clearly the Communist danger in Europe
 but have a blind spot on Asia.  In the East
 particularly we are afflicted the same way.
 Question.  (Stanley  Brooks).  Proposed
 changes in the new civil rights bill
 Answer. When faced with a volatile situa-
 tion you can't delay action over 7 years for
 an amendment to the Constitution.  There
 shquld be action but action of right kind.
 Voters should be literate but literacy test
 should be fair.  Republican platform of 1960
 considered a sixth grade education as suf-
 ficient qualification.                                                                  The present law ap-
 plies only in those States won by Repub-
 licans in 1964-bill should be extended to
 all the country.
 Abuse of the Sick Aged.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CHARLES S. GUBSER
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, April 19, 1965
 Mr. GUBSER.                                   Mr. Speaker, a series
 of articles written by Lisa Hobbs re-
 cently appeared in the San Francisco
 Examiner which comprise a shocking ex-
 pose of the treatment of our sick and
 elderly citizens in some convalescent and
 nursing homes In California.
 Because I believe these articles should
 be brought to the attention of the leader-
 ship in this Congress and the executive
 branch, I am inserting them in the REC-
 oRQ as separate extensions of remarks.
 I am not including the third article in the
 series since it deals primarily with State
 legislation.
 I am indebted to my constituents, Miss
 Violette Hofmann and Mrs. Frank H.
 Schryver, for bringing these articles. to
 my attention.  I sincerely hope the ap-
 propriate individuals will consider the
 possibility of corrective legislation.
 The first article follows:
 [From the San Francisco (Calif.) Examiner,
 Mar. 14,19651
 BUREAUCRACY'S  VICTIMS: ABUSE OF THE SICK
 AGED
 (By Lisa Hobbs)
 Scandalous abuses are being heaped on the
 sick aged of California by a multimillion-dol-
 lar bureaucracy.
 The powers of this bureaucracy have be-
 come so diffused in the mass of related and
 unrelated Federal, state, and county reg-
 ulations that gross abuses of the aged are
 now inherent in the system's functioning.
 The rise of California's newest Industry-
 the nursing and convalescent homes-is an
 offshoot of this bureaucracy's attempt to deal
 with one facet of the problem of an aging
 population.
 In a 3-week survey of nursing and con-
 valescent homes in the city and East Bay, the
 Examiner found:
 Elderly persons, unheeded, crying to be
 turned over.
 One aid doing all the household cleaning,
 'cooking,  and  nursing for up to 10 bed
 patients.
 Grease encrusted stoves and filthy kitchen
 floors.
 Constant reference to the sick aged as be-
 ing like children.
 Total lack of privacy for those paying up
 to $500 a month.
 Debasing humiliations for lower economic
 aged.
 These abuses are widespread throughout
 the State but the most scandalous fact is
 that for years the city of San Francisco has
 been dumping its sick aged into State mental
 asylums to die-whether mentally ill or not.
 According to the department of mental
 hygiene's report to the legislature in 1963,
 the city's rate of commitment to a State
 mental hospital was 600 per 100,000 popula-
 tion.  Eighty percent of these persons died
 within the first 3 weeks.
 While San Francisco was committing 600
 per 100,000 population, Los Angeles was com-
 mitting only 54 per 100,000 and Alameda 300.
 Eighty percent of those committed were over
 65 and were being committed for the first
 time.
 Bureaucracy-the same style bureaucracy
 that controls the nursing-convalescent home
 situation today-not only allowed this but
 actually condoned it.
 Purely economic reasoning lay behind the
 dumping of these aged persons into mental
 hospitals to end their days.  By removing
 them from the county hospital where they
 were  receiving  medical  assistance  to  the
 aged (MAA)  under the Kerr-Mills bill, the
 city of San Francisco was freed of its 25
 percent share of MAA costs for that patient.
 It is an old solution, however, being used
 long before the Kerr-Mills bill was intro-
 duced.
 The procedure involved was a brief court
 commitment  proceeding  while  the  words
 "with psychosis" were added to the doctor's
 original  diagnosis  of "chronic brain syn-
 drome."                                                                                                                                    This syndrome covers everything
 from confusion to senility.
 Officials of the department of mental hy-
 giene are forced to play their part in the
 scandal, because the law requires them to
 accept  into  mental  hospitals  all patients
 committed by the court, whether mentally
 ill or not.
 Dr. Robert Hewitt, chief deputy director
 of  the   department  in  Sacramento,  said
 there are a substantial number of people in
 our State hospitals who do not require hos-
 pitalization, who are not mentally ill, and
 some of whom should never have been com-
 mitted to our care.
 This solution was practiced for years with
 the knowledge and tacit approval of the city
 and county of San Francisco, county hos-
 pital  authorities,  State  mental  hospital
 authorities,  and the  State department of
 mental health.
 By setting up a honeycomb of regulations
 governing     building and architectural re-
 quirements                                                                                                                                        of housing for the aged, the
 State has paid a ritualistic tribute to the
 physical well-being of the aged.
 Yet in those areas where the aged can be
 most easily victimized-all those areas in
 which they struggle to maintain a sense of
 value  and dignity as  human beings-the
 State has done nothing to protect them.
 Instead,  with  slipshod  regulations  and
 ineffectual controls, the State has left the
 aged sick to suffer countless indignities at
 the  hands  of  unskilled guardians, called
 nurse's aids, vocational nurses, or practical
 nurses.
 Just as victimized are the families of the
 sick aged,  in  those cases where families
 exist. The expense is crippling, the load of
 doubt and guilt devastating.
 I visited scores of homes where the price
 of a room for "a loved one" was plucked from
 the air.  Only twice was I given a printed
 card with rates.  Elsewhere, a score of little
 feelers as to the "loved ones" means-whe-
 ther she was receiving old age assistance
 social security, a veteran's pension, a rail-
 road  pension-always  preceded  the  final
 figures.
 And the final figure was never cheap. No
 home will accept a patient receiving medical
 assistance to the aged if there is a change of
 selling the bed for a higher, private fee.
 Twice it was intimated that if the "loved
