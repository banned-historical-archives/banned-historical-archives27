 LIBERATION OF THOUGHT, FOUR BASIC PRINCIPLES DEFINED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 30 Jan 81 pp 1-2
 [Article by Liu Quankai [0491,0356 7030]:  "Uphold the Four Basic Principles and
 Continue To Liberate Thinking"]
 [Text]   In the new year,. the most important. tasks facing the people of this country
 are, in economics, to further readjust the national economy, and in politics, to
 .continue to develop the situation of stability and unity.  These are in the basic
 interest of all people of the country and are the common desire of all.  And in both
 the smooth accomplishment of the economic readjustment tasks and in development of
 the political situation of stability and unity, thought should be liberated further
 under the leadership of the policy set forth by the Third Plenum.
 Liberating thought is not a temporary measure of the party's but rather a long-term
 policy.  We have.passed through a long period of semifeudal, semicolonial society
 and.have extensive and profound ideological influences deriving from the feudalists
 and bourgeoisie; the 10 catastrophic years of Lin Biao and the "gang of four" created
 modern superstition and used new obscurantism to shackle the masses' thinking.  To
 liberate thought we must smash the spiritual fetters of modern superstition and
 break out of the ideological influences of the exploiting classes let over from the
 old society; we must cause the masses to throw off the fetters of modern supersti-
 tion, and make a decisive break with the exploiting classes' ideology of harming
 others to help oneself, and with old, traditional habits.  This is assuredly not
 something that can be accomplished in a short time.  The belief that liberating
 thought has already run its course or has been overdone is incorrect.  But liberat-
 ing thought should be beneficial to the four modernizations, to stability and
 unity, and to the centralization and unification of the whole party and the whole
 army.  Liberating thought should be predicated on upholding the four basic princi-
 ples to be portrayed as opposites or allow people to break with the four basic
 principles while prattling on about liberating thought.  This state of affairs
 truly exists in some cases, and attention should be called to it.
 Is It Liberation of Thought To "Say What Has Never Been Said Before"?
 Modern superstition has brought forth the bitter fruit of ideological ossification
 and has completely fettered some people's minds.  They cannot consider a problem,
 but can only follow the book and copy the leaders' directives, imitating them all
 whether they are right or wrong.  In their work they act as "megaphones" or "clear-

 ing houses" and have no ideas, views or voice of their own, to say nothing of
 creativity. Accordingly, a basic requirement for liberating thought is that of
 setting the machinery in motion and considering problems.  To start, thinking should
 be enlivened, old theories should be discarded and new ideas created, and new view-
 points'boldly brought forth.
 However; is merely offering new viewpoints and saying what has never been said
 before liberation of thought?  It would be extremely one-sided to think so.
 People's thinking reflects objective reality, and the correctness of what they say
 depends on whether it is in accordance with objective reality.  Whether a new view-
 point is worth advocating or an old viewpoint is worth discarding should be deter-
 mined in accordance with this standard; it is not true that only the new is worth-
 while and that only "new" viewpoints, never before been advocated, are correct.  The
 theory of surplus value, the dialectical-materialist principle that matter deter-
 mines consciousness and consciousness reflects matter and the theory that capitalism
 will inevitably be replaced by socialism were all put forward by Marx more than a
 hundred years ago; and some people believe that they should all be considered "out-
 moded ideas."  But the older they are, the newer they become:  The longer they
 have existed, the more they have been proven to be true, and they cannot be reject-
 ed.  In contrast, many fallacies from the period of Lin Biao and the "gang of four"
 have been labeled"'new" and touted as "new developments" in Marxism; but the under
 the banner of breaking new ground, they actually consist of old, stale goods.  In
 ancient times this country had a saying that "externally their words are ever new
 and changing, but'if you examine their true nature, they are increasingly mean and
 degenerate."  Accordingly all new viewpoints must be analyzed to see whether they
 are in accordance. with reality and are well-reasoned.  If we approve of everything
 "new" no matter what its content, it is very easy to be deceived.
 Marxism is not a dogma but a science.  Marxism does not exhaust all truth, but must
 continue to develop, and the development of Marxism'is not based solely on what
 some individuals can do, but requires everyone's common efforts.  To liberate think-
 ing we need to replace certain individual:,'.outmoded principles of Marxism with new
 principles which generalize actual experience.  Comrade Mao Zedong.was a great
 Marxist who brought the universal principles of Marxism and the specific practice of
 China's revolution into agreement and developed Marxism.  But Comrade Mao Zedong
 also made errors, and these errors, particularly'some theories and formulations
 which have been shown by experience to be erroneous, should under certain circum-
 stances be discussed and investigated.  If we go by the "two all's" and they must
 always be followed without alteration, we merely stifle thought and choke off the
 party's vitality.   But these discussions and investigations must be conducted in a
 spirit of finding the truth and with a rigorous and conscientious attitude.  All of
 the relevant material must be collected and thoroughly analyzed and investigated,
 without demagoguery but with the intention of finding the truth of the matter.  In-
 fluencing factors and objectives effects must be taken into account.  Many comrades
 have proceeded in this way, according great importance to study and making assiduous
 investigations, while refraining from unfounded statements and from glib pronounce-
 ments on subjects they do not understand.  But there are also a few people, partic-
 ularly some young people, who have neither investigated the history of our country's
 revolution nor come to an all-round understanding of the country's current con-
 ditions, and who know even less of Marxism and have assimilated it imperfectly.  On

 the basis of hearsay they pronounce all manner of ill-considered opinions on matters
 they do not understand, deny certain basic truths and attitudes of Marxism and Mao
 Zedong Thought, and style themselves as "liberators of thinking," treating anyone
 who does not agree with them as "old-fashioned," "conservative," or "ossified."
 This is a problem of thought and understanding:  They lack the spirit of seeking
 truth and they consider novel, high-flown theories to be liberation of thought.  In
 addition there is an extremely small number of people who, under the banner of
 liberating thought, advocate such outlandish ideas as that "China has a bureaucradic
 class" and "Marxism is an illusion without scientific foundations."  Such outlandish
 ideas as these are in reality old stuff which the bourgeoisie has long touted and
 which we encountered long ago.  Lenin said, "Distorting the meaning of words has
 long been an extremely common phenomenon in politics," and "the term 'revolution'
 lends itself readily to misuse, and when a movement has developed to a certain stage
 it is even unavoidable that people should misuse it" ("Selected Writings of Lenin,"
 Vol 1, p 615).  This was exactly the case during the 10 catastrophic years.  Is it
 not true that many reprehensible things were done under the fair name of revolution?
 Now the slogan "Liberate Thought" is facing a similar fate at the hands of some
 people.  We must heighten our vigilance against such people who under the guise of
 "liberating thought" are peddling the. bourgeoisie's wares.
 The Assertion That "The Thinking of Officialdom Is Not Liberated, But the People's
 Thinking Is Liberated" Is Sheer Nonsense
 In relation to the liberation of thought some people have fabricated the theory of
 "officialdom and the people," contending that all leadership cadres represent
 "officialdom" with vested interests, so.that their thinking is not liberated.  It
 is only those without power, representing the so-called "people," who can liberate
 thought.  They say that the truth can only be with the "'people" and not with
 "officialdom."  This view wantonly transfers the relationship between officials and
 people in an exploiting society to a socialist society, and is a complete fallacy.
 Officials of all ranks in the exploiting classes' society are the "masters" whose
 prestige and well-being are set on the people's shoulders, who use their power to
 cruelly oppress the common people and suck their lifeblood,.so that the officials
 and the people are in fundamental opposition.  In the exploiting classes' society,
 there were certain individual good officials such as"Bao Zheng and Hai Rui who
 administered the law fairly, behaved incorruptably, and were able to do good for
 the people to some degree.  But because the exploiting classes' state machinery was
 a tool for enslaving and oppressing the people, the existence of a tiny minority of
 honest officials could not change the essential situation of an opposition between
 officials and people.  The proletariat's leadership cadres, however, are different:
 They are leaders, an alement of the people, and the people's "public servants," and
 the relationship between cadres and masses, i.e. between officials and people, con-
 tains no fundamental opposition.
 During the 10 catastrophic years, it actually came to pass that the party's excel-
 lent work style was destroyed and some leadership cadres were infected with the
 attitudes of the oppressing classes' officials, became exalted, divorced from the
 masses and from reality, and some dealt in prerogatives and special privileges.  But
 this was because they were tarnished by the ideology of the exploiting class so
 that their proletarian party spirit was weakened or lost, and it was not because

 they represented "officialdom."  In a situation where there still existed remnants
 of the feudal class and influences of bourgeois thought, incorrect tendencies also
 existed among. certain of the worker and peasant masses who were not leadership
 cadres at all.  It was only because their positions were different that their be-
 havior differed:                 In both cases the source was ideological influences of the ex-
 ploiting classes.  Accordingly the problems of eliminating the ideological influence
 of the exploiting class and rectifying incorrect tendencies and the task of destroy-
 ing the fetters of modern superstition and the ideology of self-interest and liber-
 ating thought exist for both cadres and masses. and for both leadership and ordinary
 cadres.  Of course, leadership cadres at all levels should set an example in this
 respect.  And use of the distinction between "officialdom" and "the people" as a
 replacement for analysis of social and class origins, as well as the belief that
 the masses' thought'is inevitably liberated and the leaders' thought is inevitably
 not liberated, are approaches which are entirely at variance with Marxist class
 analysis and with the principles of historical materialism.
 Liberating thought means bringing thought into agreement with reality, reconciling
 the subjective with the objective, and seeking the reality of the situation.  Pro-
 vided that a leadership cadre is not selfish or prejudiced, but makes assiduous in-
 vestigations,' takes the masses as his teacher, and brings theory into agreement
 with reality,. he will be able to break out of all shackles and liberate his thought,
 and will be able to arrive at more truths.  Such persons are a majority in the ranks
 of our cadres..- But if comrades who are not in leadership posts. lack the above-
 mentioned spirit, they will similarly be unable to liberate their thought and
 attain truths.
 The touting of the "theory of truth in power" by Lin Biao and the "gang of four"
 during the 10 catastrophic years was entirely reactionary.  Power and position bring
 people neither knowledge nor truth; truth is not the inevitable concommitant of
 power.  But provided that one's power is not divorced from the people, but can be
 used to serve the people, it is no hindrance to liberating thought or to arriving
 at truths.  In reality, once the ','gang of four" was smashed., many circumstances
 that were in accord with objective reality and many policy decisions and measures
 which had deep support among the masses, such as the general policy of readjusting,
 reforming,. rectifying and upgrading the national economy and the decision to reform
 the party and-.state leadership system and the economic system, were proposed by
 none other than the party Central Committee.  This proves that the idea that "of-
 ficialdom" is supposedly.unliberated in its thinking and possesses no truths is
 complete nonsense.  Those who claim that they stand for "the people," that their
 thought is liberated and that they are the possessor-ss of truths actually possess
 not truth but fallacy.
 Can Upholding the Four Basic Principles Hinder Liberation of Thought?
 To liberate thought it is necessary to eliminate the "forbidden areas" and all
 "restrictions" which hinder its liberation:  Does this not mean that the four basic
 principles should also be done away with?  Some people actually think so.   They
 believe that. the assertion that liberation of thought cannot deviate from the four
 basic principles is "setting restrictions" and that it will hinder liberation of
 thought; this'is an incorrect idea.

 The four basic principles, namely the socialist road, the people's democratic
 dictatorship, i.e. the dictatorship of the proletariat, the leadership of the party,
 and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, embody the fundamental interests of all
 people in the country, and are a necessity of historical development.  Only by up-
 holding the four basic principles does our country and its people have a future and
 hope, and only in this way can the four modernizations be implemented and the
 people's interests be protected.  Admittedly our country's social system is still
 imperfect and still has faults, the state system of the people's democratic dicr_atc*--
 ship still has shortcomings, leadership by the party still needs improvement, and
 Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong thought were extremely distorted and falsified durirg
 the 10 catastrophic years and require restoration to their original aspect and
 further development.  Accordingly, in connection with upholding the four basic
 principles we need to sum up the lessons of historical experience, exalt democracy,
 listen thoroughly to the masses' opinions, and permit disputes between different
 views.  All rigorous and conscientious disputes based on investigation and study
 help to enliven thought and develop truths.  The aim of this approach is to support
 the four basic principles more effectively, not to doubt or negate them.
 The four basic principles are not the conception of some genius, but a reflection of
 the objective laws of social development, and truths repeatedly proved by long ex-
 perience.  To liberate thought we must destroy superstition and dogma, but we must not
 do away with science or truth.  All new discoveries and all new viewpoints proposed.
 during the liberation of thought should be helpful in the development of science and
 truth rather than the opposite.  Since the four basic principles are basic truths,
 they not only cannot come into conflict with liberation of thought, but are entirely
 in accord with it.  When a train moves along its track, the track is not a hindrance
 to it, and similarly, advocating the four basic principles cannot hinder the liber-
 ation of thought:                   We.proceed on the correct tracks precisely'in order to liberate
 thought.  Some people treat the four basic principles as "restrictions" and are not
 entirely happy with them-or even oppose them, saying that they should be "suspended."
 We should like to ask. just where this kind of "liberation" of thought is intended to
 lead.  Does "liberation of thought" consist only in smashing the four basic prin-
 ciples?                    Is the thinking of those people who. consider the four basic principles
 to be "restrictions" and believe that they will hinder the liberation of thought
 entirely without restrictions itself?  No indeed.  If today's extremely diverse
 countries do not belong to one social system they belong to another; they-all have
 different parties and different ideologies.  If someone is opposed to the four basic
 principles he always wants to adopt some other "principles"; for example, if he does
 not want the socialist system, he must want a different kind of social system, and if
 he does not want the leadership of the.Communist Party, he must want the leadership
 by some other party.  Some people have actually advocated such ideas openly, stat-
 ing~~that "socialism cannot be implemented either in China or anywhere in the world,"
 or "the four modernizations can be implemented and socialism built without the
 leadership of the Communist Party."  Is this not setting up different "restrictions"?
 Comrade Zhou Enlai said:  "Marxism has a framework.  We have a general framework,
 we do not oppose frameworks in general."  Although the exploiting classes in our
 country no longer exist, classes have not been entirely destroyed, and although
 the class struggle has already ceased to be the main contradiction in our country,
 it still exists.  Accordingly, in their thinking or pronouncements involving major
 political questions, people either consciously or unconsciously reflect the
 interests, viewpoints and requirements of a specific class, and their social conse-
 quences generally benefit either one class or another.  In these terms, people's
 understanding has limits.  The people who oppose the four basic principles as
 "restrictions  have not really cast off all "restrictions" themselves; it is just
 that they are employing the "restrictions" other principles.

 Liberating thought is a policy.to which our party unswervingly adheres.  After the
 "gang of four" was smashed, if we had not had a mass movement to liberate thought,
 but had acted according to the "two all.'s," we would not have been able to effect
 a shift of the focus of party work, to carry out' the readjustment of the national
 economy or to.implement the reform of the state leadership system and the
 economic system, we would have been unable to implement a number of party policies,
 and in a word, we would not have the four modernizations or socialism.  Accordingly,
 the liberation of thought must continue to be developed, thoroughly and in a healthy
 manner, without any wavering.  However, the liberation of thought does not'mean'::that
 anyone can say anything he likes or do anything he pleases, can reject party leader-
 ship, socialism, centralization and' discipline, and can approve of all manner of
 incorrect ideas.- Much less can we permit a small minority to distort the slogan
 "Liberate Thought," to peddle all manner of contraband goods and to disseminate
 antiparty, antisocialist views.  There should be thorough democracy among the
 people, the.expression of different opinions should be permitted, and even if
 people express incorrect opinions they must not be attacked or given labels indis-
 criminately; those with incorrect opinions should be given guidance and education,
 while the necessary criticism and struggle should be used in the case of all anti-
 party, antisocialist opinions.                   A clear distinction should be made between this
 and attacks or labeling.  We should propagandize justly and. energetically the
 four basic principles and firmly implement them; we should continue unwaveringly
 to liberate thought, for in this way our country's four modernizations will
 assuredly be realized and socialism will assuredly be victorious.

 READJUSTMENT OF WORK STYLE, DISCIPLINE URGED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 31 Jan 81 p 3
 [Article reprinted from 23 Dec 80 issue of RENMIN HAIJUN:  "Carry Out a Rectification
 of Work Style and Discipline"]
 [Text]  Some units have already made use of the favorable opportunity of summing up
 work as the year ends and the arrival of new soldiers and the return of old ones to
 implement education and rectification regarding work style and discipline.  This
 work is highly necessary, and doing it well is extremely important for the completion
 of this year's tasks.  All units should follow this example and approach the work
 energetically both before and after the Spring Festival.
 Education and rectification with regard to work style. and discipline should begin
 with the cadres.  The cadres' behavior amounts to tacit orders.  When the work of
 education and rectification of the cadres has been done well, they will set an
 example everywhere and the units will follow them.
 The combination of persuasive education and bold administration has always been an
 effective method of rectifying work style and discipline, and we should use the same
 approach on this occasion.  Comrades who breach discipline should be patiently per
 suaded, ably set straight and enlightened; they must not be coerced or stifled.
 Those who are coerced generally do not submit, and attempts to style them are un-
 successful.  But this does not mean that we should refrain from carrying out suitable
 criticism and from taking necessary disciplinary measures.  Criticism and disciplin-
 ary measures are also education.  The lack of the courage to point out and correct
 bad phenomena and to come to grips with pernicious influences and set them straight
 must be rectified.
 The focus of this education and rectification regarding work style and discipline
 is on actively implementing regulations and ordinances and on conscientiously
 implementing rules and regulations.  We should continue setting up a healthy and
 normal system for working and living, based on regulations.  Every cadre and fighter
 must know and conscientiously carry out his duties, maintain security, pay strict
 .regard to appearance and.bearing, conduct and discipline, stress courtesy and eti-
 quette, observe discipline, obey the laws, protect social ethics, and set a good
 example at all times.

 LANZHOU UNITS CADRES STUDY DEFENSIVE WARFARE
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 2 Sep 79 p 1
 [Article by Deng Guotian [6772 0948 3240], Wang Fuhong [3769 4395 7703] and
 Wang An [3769 1344]:  "Integrate a Summing up of Experience With an Inquiry
 Into Future Warfare--The Lanzhou Units Assembled Military Cadres To Study
 Some Problems at the Initial Stage of a War"]
 [Text]  A team of military cadres in training held by the Lanzhou Units have
 just completed a training course recently.  Did it score any significant
 results?  The participating cadres admitted that at the very beginning of the
 course, they did not know much about the concept of "militarily holding fast
 to defensive warfare at the initial stage of war" [7786 1017 1343 7089 1785
 0155 2069].  Having finished the course, they now feel relatively at home with
 this concept.
 After Comrade Su Yu [4725 5940] published his article entitled "An Inquiry Into
 the Problems Relating to the Methods of Fighting at the Initial Stage of
 Anti-Aggression War in the Future," the party committee of the Lanzhou Units
 decided to conduct a team of military cadres in training on the basis of their
 position and mission.  The participants consisted of the key commanding officers
 from various armies of the Lanzhou Units; the major commanders of provincial
 military districts, and the leading cadres from judicial, political and rear
 service establishments.  These comrades had fought in the Revolutionary War
 and acquired definite combat experience.  Nevertheless, to direct combat under
 contemporary conditions remained for them a new topic for study.  The leading
 cadres of the Lanzhou Units stressed time and again that the training course
 should integrate experience with an. inquiry into future warfare. An inquiry
 into the problems of "militarily holding fast to defensive warfare at the
 initial stage of a war" could serve to enhance the organizational as well as
 the commanding capabilities of the participating cadres on the one hand and seek
 the pattern of experience needed for warfare under contemporary conditions on
 the other.  The team of military cadres in training fully manifested military
 democracy.  On academic issues, they spoke out and expressed their opinions
 freely.   In content and methods, they avoided technological work as much as
 possible.  Instead, the emphasis was laid on other aspects--deliberation on
 substance, small group discussion, research paper writing, and roundtable
 discussion.  Prominence was also given to discussing the theoretical aspects of
 "holding fast to defensive warfare" and a commander's command over his
 organization.

 During the training, the leading cadres of Lanzhou Units paid great attention
 to guiding the students in their study of the specific laws of modern warfare
 and probing into flexible tactics in operations suitable for contemporary
 cdnditions. On the basis of integrating their firsthand experience with dis-
 cussions on the basic principles of "holding fast to defensive warfare,"
 those comrades who had taken part in the "Shangganling Campaign" [0006 3927
 5749] and the "38th Parallel Campaign" during the struggle to resist U.S. aggres-
 sion and aid Korea seriously studied the technical equipment of the opposite
 side in a future war and the main features of a group army's offensive
 campaign.  In addition, the principles of utilizing our arms of services
 including the air force, artillery troops, armored troops, signal troops,
 antichemical corps, and political work as well as logistics safeguard were
 diligently studied.  Furthermore, problems such as how to form a strong
 defense system, how to carry out counter-assault and counter-strike tactics,
 and how to organize the various services and arms to fight in coordination
 at the "initial stage of militarily holding fast to defensive warfare" were
 earnestly discussed.  Moreover, an army commander made a thorough study of
 how to take effective coordinated action of "militarily holding fast to
 defensive warfare."   The three observations presented by him were concise
 and to the point.  First, the commanders of the combined arms unit and of the
 various arms must understand one another, and be familiar with the charac-
 teristics and principles of using the various arms.  Second, in organizing
 coordination, the essentials must be firmly grasped.  With respect to the
 various arms, it is essential to have a well-organized coordination among
 the infantry, tank units, artillery troops and the air force.  During opera-
 tions, emphasis should be laid on coordinated actions in resisting continuous
 -assault by the enemy's infantry and tank units on the one hand and carrying
 out a vigorous counterattack on the other.  As to wiping out targets, the
 main effort is to coordinate action'dealing with the enemy's tank assemblage
 and airborne force.  Finally, great Attention should be paid to safeguarding
 communications.
 In exploring the problems of organization and command with reference to
 "militarily holding fast to defensive warfare at the initial stage of a war,"
 they repeatedly combined the study of principles with the salient topo-
 graphical features of a hypothetical battlefield.  They seriously analyzed
 favorable as well as unfavorable conditions of standing fast at a given
 region's defense, and inquired into tactics suitable for its salient features.
 For the purpose of increasing their perception of theory, they crossed the
 Gobi Desert and traversed the length and breadth of the land around a hypo-
 thetical theater of operations and its adjacent area.  They conducted on-the-
 spot investigations of the region's fortifications, topography, climate,
 water supply, roads and resident population.  Then, they worked indoors.
 By integrating theory with practice in their learning process and deliberation,
 the students not merely grasped the theoretical aspects of "holding fast to
 defensive warfare at the initial stage of a war," but also, in a relatively
 systematic manner, studied and drilled on the tactics of sticking to defending
 a hypothetical theater's garrison focal point.  Besides, many valuable hypo-
 theses relating to some aspects of battleground construction including the
 transformation of topography and roads, the integration of farmland capital
 construction, and the construction of antitank fortifications were advanced.

 Through study and discussion, the participating cadres have learned how to
 organize and command "militarily holding fast to defensive warfare at the
 initial stage of a war."  In order to turn personal experience and what they
 have learned into useful knowledge shared by the troops, they completed
 9 research papers, 27 working papers and revised drafts on the "Syllabus of Some
 Problems Concerning Theoretical Aspects of Militarily Holding Fast to Defensive
 Warfare" in the course of assembling for training.  Their arduous works.
 provided useful materials suited to this region for the training of junior
 commanding officers.

 MILITARY AND PUBLIC SECURITY
 CHINA SAID TO NEED STRONG BORDER DEFENSE
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 3 Sep 79 p 1
 [Commentary:   "It Is Necesary To Have a Strong Border Defense"]
 [Text]  Fighting the war of self-defensive counterattack on the China-Vietnam
 border firmly convinced us:  the four modernizations must be defended by armed
 force.  Our garrison forces defending the land border and sea coast are the
 first line in battling to defend the four modernizations.
 The realization of socialist modernization requires a peaceful international
 environment and stable border areas.  The four modernizations are a great and
 heroic undertaking.  It makes our enemies feel nervous and uneasy, so that they
 are bound to try by all possible means to wreck them and cannot let them
 peacefully be carried out.  This poses a problem:  when we concentrate our
 strength on constructing the four modernizations, we must maintain sharp
 vigilance and defend the safety of the border areas, closely integrating the
 construction of the four modernizations with the defense of the four moderniza-
 tions.  Our country's territory is vast, and the land border defense line
 alone is over 21,000 kilometers in length, of which close to two-thirds is
 contiguous to the Soviet Union, Mongolia and Vietnam.  The border regions are
 iihabited by the minority nationalities.  In our country, although the popula-
 tion of the minority nationalities is only about 6 percent of the total popula-
 tion, the regions they live in account for 50 to 60 percent of the total area
 of the country, a vast territory abounding in natural resources.  If a war
 breaks out, no matter whether it is on a small, medium or large scale, the
 border areas and the minority nationality regions will bear the brunt.  All
 this shows that the border defense struggle will be protracted and critical
 and that is is a matter of urgency to strengthen border defense construction,
 and shows that in order to realize the four modernizations it is necessary to
 construct prosperous border areas and strong border defenses.
 History is a mirror.  Over the 30. years since the founding of the state, we have
 fought many wars of self-defensive counterattack in defense of the border areas,
 smashing the aggressive and subversive plots of big and little hegemonism and
 defending the motherland's peace and territorial integrity, in order to create
 advantageous conditions for the construction of socialism.  People can just
 imagine:  if there were not such conditions, there would be daily alarms sounded

 from the strategic positions along the border and year after year the beacon
 fires would. not be extinguished, and in such a case could we have concentrated
 our energy on socialist construction?
 The so-called "political border defense" advocated by Lin Biao was in reality
 borders without defense and even no borders and no defenses.  In those years,
 Lin Biao and the "gang of four" time and again seriously weakened border defense
 construction.  Although we have refuted the fallacy of "political border defense,"
 it still today remains in the minds of some comrades as a wound that demands
 prompt healing.
 "The border defense forces in peacetime and on sentry duty, once a war breaks out,
 will only be engaged in small-scale fighting."  This view is incorrect.  Border
 defense is not a small matter.  The border defense garrison forces occupy the
 first line of struggle against enemies.  The places where they are stationed
 are scattered and numerous, and they live under tough conditions, their tasks
 are onerous, and their struggle will be complex.  In case war breaks out, whether
 .we can resist the first wave of a sudden enemy attack, whether we can delay the
 enemy's offensive, and thus give us the time necessary for war preparations,
 have a direct bearing on how well we construct border defenses.  In line with
 the demands for defending the four modernizations with armed force, we must
 build our border defense forces into strong forces that are Red politically
 and ideologically, that understand our policies to a high degree, that are
 well organized and disciplined, that can work with the masses, that have both
 definite military qualities and a mastery of the techniques of border defense
 fighting, and that can carry out both political and military tasks.  Only this
 kind of forces can shoulder the heavy responsibility on the borders and insure
 that "a certain number of troops can defend against an uncertain number of
 invaders," so that our border defenses will truly pass the test of political
 disturbances and severe warfare.
 Then there is this phenomenon:  the soldiers are defending the border but their
 minds are elsewhere.  This mental state is extremely detrimental to the building
 of strong border defenses.  Focusing on this situation, the great number of
 officers and men in the border defense garrison forces pointed out:  "Cherish
 the border areas and take root in the border areas, defend the border areas, and
 construct the border areas."  This is what people usually speak of as the
 "four borders" idea.  Firmly establish the idea. of the "four borders" is a
 correct slogan.  If we want to construct border defense well we cannot do without
 this slogan.  Within the "four borders," cherishing the border areas it the
 premise, and the other "three borders" are established on this ideological basis.
 By solving the problem of cherishing the border areas through sinking deep roots
 there, they will be able to construct the border areas without being afraid
 to work up a sweat and will courageously devote themselves to the defense of
 the border areas.
 There is yet another situation, viz, speaking of joint defense but actually
 practicing singlehanded defense of one's own position.  If this situation is
 not turned around, it will be impossible to defend effectively.  If we do
 things according to the ultraleft line of Lin Biao and the "gang of four,"

 for example, taking the Mongolian nationality's habit of drinking tea with milk
 as a "bourgeois lifestyle" and the Hui people's habit of demanding that no
 allowances be made for eating pork as a "new trend in class struggle," how can
 we unite the masses in the border areas for joint defense?  True strength lies
 in the masses.  With the border defense line this long, if we are separated
 from the support of the masses of people and only rely on the units doing
 things without any following, it will be hard to strengthen border defense, to
 truly do good mass work in the border areas, especially to to good work with
 the minority nationalities and the militia and to do good military-civilian
 joint defense.  With our motherland's long land border defense line and extensive
 sea border, only if everybody is a sentry, every home is a sentry post and every
 village is a fortress can the motherland become an impregnable fortress.
 The four modernizations require a strong border defense--this viewpoint is
 agreed by all, from top to bottom.  The problem is that, once the question of
 land border and seacoast defense is touched upon, many strange phenomena arise:
 some are that "The mouth is tight but the heart slack," and there is a lot of
 empty talk but little done in fact; some problems, which originally were easy
 to solve, were pigeonholed for long periods of time so that they became a big
 pile:  and also, with regard to certain problems that were hard to solve at one
 time, responsibility was mutually pushed back and forth, and no one thought of
 making reforms....
 In the. background of this kind of phenomena is a concealed problem, viz, the
 problem of leadership style.  If we want to make progress in border defense
 construction within a short period of time, and cause it to take a new lead
 forward, there must be a fundamental transformation in leadership style.  In
 the hearts of the leaders there must be a place for border defense, in all cases
 putting defense of the border first and defense of the interior next, putting
 the companies first and defense of the organization next.  Problems that can
 be solved today definitely cannot be put off until tomorrow, and problems that
 one can solve oneself definitely cannot be pushed off onto others.  If we want
 to truly build prosperous border areas and strong border defenses, a current
 problem that sticks out is:  transform the leadership style!

 SQUAD LEARNS LESSON FROM DEFEAT IN SEA LANDING EXERCISE
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 5 Sep 79 p 1
 [Article by Xu Honghua [1776 3163 5478] et al.:  "Draw Lessons From 'Defeat"']
 [Text]  Midsummer with the scorching sun directly overhead.  On the Yellow Sea
 outpost of "Hill 51,"-the smoke of gunpowder blurs the scene and there is the
 sound of death-dealing guns.  This is a.tactical defense exercise in resisting
 a landing operation that was organized by a certain regiment of the Qingdao
 Garrison District.  Gradually the gunpowder smoke dissipates and the deadly
 sound subsides.  The 2d Squad of the 6th Company, which had been standing
 fast guarding the hill, because of "heavy casualties," has its position
 occupied by an "enemy" motorized infantry-platoon.
 This result, which departed from the common practice in former naval war exer-
 cises, was widely discussed by people.  Some said:  "In training exercises,
 our armed forces cannot suffer a defeat," but the comrades.of the 2d Squad
 felt that they had learned many things from this "defeat."  In the final
 analysis, which view is correct?  Please take a look at the main course of
 this "battle."
 The Trick of Lifting Artillery Fire
 At the beginning of the "battle," a swarm of "enemy aircraft" flew in close to
 the sea surface.  After they had bombed wantonly and indiscriminately, a fierce
 artillery bombardment on our position came from the sea.  The fighters of the
 2d Squad, holding their rifles, squatted in their shelters, prepared at any time
 to hit back.  Several minutes passed and then the observer gave the signal:
 The "enemy's" bombarding fire had been lifted.  The entire squad quickly
 jumped out of their shelters and occupied the position.  Squad leader
 Gao Liyun [7559 4539 6663], while ordering the defense works to be repaired
 in a rush, had misgivings:  Strange!  Why was the artillery attack so brief?
 According to the enemy's tactical principles, this short an artillery bombard-
 ment means that the enemy's LST's are not far from the shoreline.  Can it be
 a trick?  How should I handle this situation?  Prior to this, if he had
 envisaged a fixed plan for dealing with a situation, everything went all right.
 Suddenly he heard a sharp scream in the air:  the "enemy's" lifted artillery
 fire had returned and was plunging down on top of the squad.

 "Hit the ground," shouted squad leader Gao Liyun.  However, it was too late.
 Two comrades who were a little slow in hitting the ground were "killed" and one
 was wounded.  After-the artillery fire had lifted, the squad quickly made rush-
 repairs on the defense works and gave first-aid to the "wounded" soldier.
 (Writer's note:  The organizers of this tactical exercise set up this situation
 in which there was a trick in the enemy's lifting of his artillery fire, so
 that the 2d Squad's was caught unawares with regard to the tactical training
 topic of "defending against artillery"; but the exercise helped, by this
 negative example, the comrades of the 2d Squad to understand this truth:  the
 enemy is extremely tricky and'the situation on the battlefield is ever-changing.
 We certainly must envisage more complexity in peacetime training and make a
 point of tempering the trainees in the capability of flexibly dealing with all
 soxts of complex situations.  Otherwise, if they simplemindedly deal with
 changeable situations, it will be hard for them to avoid taking losses passively.)
 Under cover of artillery fire, three "enemy tanks," in a blustering and truculent
 manner, make a forced beach landing.
 "Hill 51," defended by the 2d Squad, slopes gently and to its front is level
 beach.  The hill is easy to attack and hard to defend and is extremely advan-
 tageous for tank assaults.  According to the predetermined operational plan,
 which called for an ambush attack on the tanks, the squad sent three antitank
 teams, carrying rocket launchers, bangalore torpedoes, and satchel charges, to
 the prebuilt defense works below the position, where they would wait until the
 "enemy tanks" were blocked by the mine clusters on the beach at the high tide
 line, and then mercilessly attack them.  However, the minefield had already
 been destroyed by artillery fire.
 The "enemy tanks" fiercely charged through.  Rocket launcher gunner Sun Jinqi
 [1327 6651 2978] got one tank in his sights.  There was a "boom" and the tank
 was hit, but it forged ahead as before.  The rocket projectile had not pierced
 the front part of its composite armor.   Bangalore torpedo gunner
 Mu Wei'an [4476 5898 1344], holding his weapon in both hands, jumped up and
 rushed forward.  Cleverly making use of terrain features, he crawled, rolled
 and suddenly jumped forward, putting to good use the tactical movements he
 had learned in peacetime training.  But, owing to the fact.that the tanks
 alternately covered each other and that the firepower was fierce and their
 vital points small, he found no way to get close to them.
 The three antitank teams were pinned down in trenches and shell craters by
 machinegun fire from the "enemy tanks."  With a mighty roar the "enemy tanks"
 plunged through the prebuilt antitank defense works, scattering the antitank
 teams behind them.  At this juncture, according to the second phase of the
 predetermined plan, the rocket launcher team should, making use of terrain,
 attack the "enemy tanks" from the rear and the flanks, and the bangalore
 torpedo team should concentrate its fire so as to intercept the "enemy
 infantry" and cut off the "enemy" tanks from his infantry.  But, unexpectedly,
 following on the heels of the "enemy tanks" were three "armored cars."
 Fire from machineguns and submachineguns of the armored cars was fierce.
 Sun Jinqi got his sights on the rear of one "enemy tank" and was about to
 fire when a fierce burst of machinegun fire from an "armored car" "!cut him down."

 Seeing the "enemy tanks" pushing through, and being unable either to attack or
 withdraw, bangalore torpedo team leader Mu Qingguang [4476 1987 0342] ordered
 everybody to throw a volley of handgrenades and, under cover of the resulting
 smoke and dust, jump into a ditch and take a shortcut back to the position.
 At the main position, squad leader Gao Liyun saw the next situation perfectly
 clearly.  After conferring with the deputy squad leader,.he decided to quickly
 lay mines to the front and right side of the position, so as to force the
 "enemy tanks" to go in front of a rain-swollen-ditch and thus stop their
 advance and force the infantry out of the cars.  The squad moved quickly and
 laid mine clusters.  When the enemy tanks approached, deputy rocket launcher
 gunner Pei Doug [1014 2639] from the flank fired his last rocket projectile,
 which hit and severed the track of one "enemy tank."  The rest of the tanks
 turned and charged toward the left flank.  They had not gone far when they were
 blocked by the ditch and had to stop.  One platoon of "enemy infantry" climbed
 out of the "armored cars" and, deploying into formation, charged our position.
 (Writers' note:  This "battle" against tanks shows the results of the 2s Squad's
 peacetime training in attacking tanks and also reveals problems in peacetime
 training.  It made the fighters see that, owing to the fact that their peacetime
 training in studying the enemy's armed forces was insufficient, they had only
 drilled in how to cut the connection between the enemy's infantry and tanks
 and they had not thought about the connection between the enemy's tanks and
 armored cars.  The result was that they suffered losses from the enemy armored
 cars following on the heels. of the. enemy tanks.  This made the comrades of
 the 2d Squad a little wiser:  Only by strengthening the study of the charac-
 teristics of the enemy's equipment, authorized strength, and tactics can the
 training lessen our blindness in action and truly train us in skills that will
 subdue enemy tanks.)
 'Enemy' Infantry That Could Not Be Repulsed
 At the position, the fighters closely observed the "enemy," waiting with leveled
 guns and chests stuck out.  The enemy rushed toward the position en masse.
 But, on the assumption that the enemy was not making a feint, the fighters
 had beforehand carried out tactical drills for coordinating their operations,
 training for over 3 months in line with the enemy's authorized strength and
 tactical principles, so that their fighting capacity was fairly strong.  They
 saw the "enemy" form a front-facing triangular formation and advance, making use
 of the cover provided by terrain features.
 Squad leader Gao Liyun had made quite a peacetime study of the enemy's tactics.
 In a low voice he ordered the squad to disperse to their sectors and prepare
 to fire, waiting for the best opportunity.  As expected, when an "enemy"
 squad rushed to a point about 20 meters in front of the position, they suddenly
 and simultaneously made a half leap and prepared to throw hand grenades.  At
 the sound of Gao Liyun's "Fire," the 2d Squad opened a fierce fire.  Over half
 the "enemy" soldiers were shot down and the rest fled in disorder.
 The "enemy tanks" and "armored cars" retaliated with violent fire, especially
 the tank at the right of the position whose track had been cut, and owing to
 advantageous terrain, it posed an even greater threat to the 2d Squad.  Gao Liyun

 ordered two fighters to destroy this tank.  The two fighters had not moved
 out very far when they were suddenly ambushed by several "enemy soldiers."
 The fighter in front was "killed."  The-"enemy commanding officer," anticipat-
 ing that the 2d Squad would make this move, had laid the ambush.  Quick-witted
 Wang Guaoming [3769 0948 2494] and another fighter, taking advantage of the
 "enemy ambushers" being off guard, attacked.them from the flank. With several
 handgrenades, they wiped out the ambushers and destroyed this "enemy tank."
 The "enemy" redeployed his forces and launched a new offensive, intensifying
 his fire on the front of the position as if he planned to make a frontal
 breakthrough at one stroke.  Gao Liyun, calmly observing the "enemy's" battle
 formation, discovered that they could be playing a trick.  The "enemy,"
 feigning a frontal attack as a screen, sent two squads to quickly outflank
 the position on the right.   Gao Liyun.immediately grabbed a light machinegun
 and with two combat teams moved to the right flank, leaving only two fighters
 to hold the "enemy" at the front of the position.  The two "enemy" squads had
 just started their assault on the fight flank when they were soundly beaten
 back.
 The "enemy commanding officer," adapting himself to changed. conditions, ordered
 the one squad that was..making the screening feint attack to make it the main
 attack, and the squad suddenly launched a fierce assault.  The result was that,
 owing to the fact that the 2d Squad's firepower and military strength at the
 front of the position had been weakened, the "enemy" broke through the position.
 This time the 2d Squad was-thrown into confusion, and the "enemy" on the right
 flank took advantage of this favorable situation to charge forward.  Even though
 the fighters had bravely killed many of the enemy, in the end, because of their
 own excessive "casualties," they were hopelessly outnumbered and lost the
 position.
 (Writers' note: This battle against enemy infantry was quite brilliant, and
 it broke down the old conventions of past exercises being like an act in a play.
 The enemy is not routed with one blow and defeated in every battle.  It was not
 determined beforehand who would win and who would lose.  During this confronta-
 tion, both sides engaged in a battle of wits and bravery, the situation was
 complex, and the scene was true to life.  In this exercise, although the
 2d Squad suffered a "defeat," they were profoundly enlightened by it.  The
 fighters said it well:  Being "defeated" several more times like this will
 certainly spur us to continually raise our tactical and technical levels,
 and in a future war against aggression we can win many victories.

 BEING DEFEATED BY 'ENEMY' IN TRAINING EXERCISES IS NECESSARY
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 5 Sep 79 p 1
 [Article by Ai Hongjun [5337 4767 6511] of a certain tank regiment:  "Let Us
 Begin by Discussing 'How Is It Possible To Suffer a Defeat in a Military
 Exercise"']
 [Text]  Going among the troops, I'observed the tactical training of several tank
 companies.  I discovered a common, problem, viz, the conditions were simplified
 and there was wishful thinking about the enemy's situation.  Our forces were
 victorious every time, winning in the first encounter, and the "enemy forces"
 were defeated every time, collapsing at the first encounter.  This is just
 what is called "killing off the rebels. with three blows and pacifying Shaanxi
 and Gansu."  With this kind of imitative predisposition and setup conditions,
 how can we not deceive ourselves as well as others, and how can we talk about
 the troop training being hard, strict and geared to the needs of actual
 combat?  However, some'of our commanders take exception to this position and
 say:  How is it possible to suffer a.defeat in a military exercise?  Our forces
 have been consistently victorious and have never been defeated.  This idea,
 which only lays stress on the enemy's being a paper tiger and neglects his
 aspect as a real tiger, runs counter to military dialectics.
 The ancients said:  "Victory and defeat are common occurrences for military
 strategists."  This saying is an immutable truth.  In fact, there has never
 been an even-victorious general who has never been defeated, and in war it is
 impossible not to suffer setbacks.  Sun Bin, a strategist of ancient China, once
 pointed out that before a battle one must think of the possibility of defeat
 so that one can then make good preparations to tur?h defeat into victory and
 appropriately deal with complicated situations.  Therefore, in training we must
 pay attention to these questions:  First, we must make a great effort to "know
 the enemy"; we must know not only the enemy's weaknesses but also his strengths,
 and, in setting up training conditions, strive to make them conform to the
 tactical and technical characteristics of the enemy army, and thereby avoid his
 strength and attack his weakness so as to be victorious in battle.  Second, we
 must both despise the enemy strategically and take him seriously tactically.
 We can neither "turn pale at the mention of a tiger" nor "be lulled into be-
 littling a tiger."  We must both "seek to learn from the enemy" and prevail over
 the enemy, winning victories with existing equipment.  Third, we must study both
 positive and negative examples of battle, using for reference successful experiences

 and drawing lessons from defeats, seeking flexible tactics for dealing with
 the enemy and improving our mastery of the skills of modern warfare.
 Fourth, we must deliberately arrange some training situations in which our
 side is losing, for example, being thwarted, being defeated or turning defeat
 into victory, training the commanders at eve?y level to correctly judge the
 enemy's situation, to flexibly apply military force, to use the correct tactics,
 and to seize the initiative in battle so that, no matter under any conditions
 whatsoever, they will be unbeatable..

 XIAO KE SPEAKS AT MEETING OF MILITARY ACADEMIES
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 10 Sep 79 p 1
 [Article by Jiao Wu [3542 2976]:  "Liberating Thinking Is Key to Improving Teaching
 Quality in Colleges and Academies"]
 [Excerpts]  Military colleges and academies recently held a meeting to exchange
 teaching experiences.  Comrade Xiao Ke, party committee secretary and president
 of a military college and concurrently its first political commissar, chaired the
 meeting and delivered a speech at it.  Linking up the reality of teaching material
 compilation, academic research, and teaching reform in military colleges, he
 stressed in his speech that the liberation of thinking is the key question in
 improving teaching quality.
 First of all, Comrade Xiao Ke pointed out that the key question to improving
 teaching quality, raising the teaching to the level of modern warfare, is to
 liberate thinking.  He said that in the past there had been many forbidden areas
 in teaching, which can be summarized in two sentences:  the first was that what
 had been written could not be changed or developed; the second was that if something
 was not written down it could not be spoken of or thought about.  The result was:
 everything in the past could not be moved forward and everything in the future had
 to be done to a pattern.  Whoever did not do things in this way was labelled as
 one who was "chopping down the banner."  In documents and speeches, there was much
 citing of the quotations [of Mao Zedong], taking the quotations as the criterion.
 This way of doing things by Lin Biao and the "gang of four" was much more devastating
 than what was done during the period of the Guangxi "left" doctrinairism.  They
 waved the red flag to oppose the red flag and, in the name of Chairman Mao, made
 propaganda against other leaders and historical figures of the party, categorically
 refuting them and not allowing them to speak out.  If you spoke out, then you were
 opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought or denigrating Mao Zedong Thought.
 They were not permitted to teach military affairs, or if they were permitted to
 teach military affairs they had to do so from a purely military viewpoint, a purely
 technical and professional viewpoint.
 Comrade Xiao Ke pointed out that in order to liberate thinking we must stress the
 features of a future war and compile the required teaching materials that suit
 modern war.  When we speak of teaching, first of all the questions of teaching
 content and teaching materials must be settled.  Without teaching materials, how
 can we teach?  If actors do not have a script, how can they perform?  In the past

 in studying strategy and campaigns, nobody dared to study and discuss, and the
 study of strategy was confined to Chairman Mao's "Problems of Strategy in China's
 Revolutionary War."  Now, we must study the strategy and tactics of people's war
 and military science under modern conditions.  If we stick to the method of the
 Red Army during the Guangxi period of letting the enemy penetrate deeply, mechani-
 cally applying this method, then we will suffer a defeat.  Because at that time
 we held no cities and had no modern industry, and got everything from the enemy,
 when the enemy came, we would "strengthen defense works, evacuate noncombatants,
 and hide provisions, entice the enemy to penetrate deeply, let go with both hands,
 and ask him to come in."  If we were to copy indiscriminately this experience of
 the Guangxi period in a future war against aggression, how could it work?  Based
 on the situation that has developed, we must study new tactics.  Based on the
 standpoint, viewpoint, and methods of Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought,
 we must write our own strategy for modern warfare.  The four modernizations and
 the modernization of national defense pose the problem of modernized combat.
 Military academies must teach under modern conditions, and there must be modern
 teaching content.  We must be determined to write teaching materials suited to
 modern warfare.  Modernized teaching will enable the students to organize coordi-
 nated operations by land, sea, and air forces.  What will we do if the middle- and
 upper-level commanders do not know how to command all service branches and arms?
 If one doesn't understand the knowledge pertaining to the sea and air forces, one
 cannot be a good military leader.  This was true in the past and is also true at
 present.  Therefore, the leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in studying
 modern military science and technology.
 Comrade Xiao Ke pointed out that in liberating thinking there is the problem of the
 attitude in dealing with the experience of foreign countries and the experience in
 running colleges and academies in the past.  After the 1958 counter doctrinairism,
 we did not dare to learn from foreign countries.  Now, we must try hard to catch up
 with the requirements of the situation that has developed, and one important condi-
 tion for doing this is that we break away, militarily, from the policy of closing
 the country to international intercourse, especially daring to learn from enemy
 armed forces, "making the enemy our teachers," and use them for our benefit.  The
 characteristics of doctrinairism is that it divorces theory from reality.  Only by
 proceeding from the reality of constructing our country and its armed forces, and
 maintaining the scientific attitude of learning, can we avoid and prevent doctri-
 nairism.  It is absolutely wrong to adopt a negative attitude toward the military
 academy presided over by Comrade Liu Bocheng and the 17-year work of the armed
 forces colleges and academies.  We must adopt the attitude of "one divides into
 two," viz, that successes are primary and shortcomings are secondary, that essen-
 tials are clearly distinguished from nonessentials, taking over the good aspects,
 further developing them and blazing new trails, and correcting what is uncorrect.
 In conclusion, Comrade Xiao Ke said that we are command colleges and academies
 that train middle- and upper-level cadres, and our responsibility is heavy.  We
 certainly must liberate our thinking, further straighten out the ideological line,
 and raise our consciousness for carrying out the line and the general and specific
 policies of the party Central Committee headed by Comrade Hua Guofeng.  He said
 that after the ideological and political lines have been straightened out, the
 organizations must still be guaranteed, and, therefore, to bring up and train
 successors to the revolutionary cause is the important task of our military acad-
 emies, is the glorious mission bestowed upon us by history.

 DIVISION SETS GOOD LOGISTICS RECORD IN VIETNAM WAR
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 10 Sep 79 p 2
 [Article by Jiang Jilin [3068 0679 2651] et al.:  "Those Who Command Must Look
 Ahead and Behind"]
 [Text]  Comrade editor:
 We understand that, during this war of self-defensive counterattack, an outstanding
 job of insuring logistics was done by a certain division:
 After the unit received its orders, in less than a day's time and in line with
 the upper level's demands, it completed every item of preparatory work for insuring
 logistics;
 During the war, every-time the unit urgently needed its ammunition or food replen-
 ished, the logistics personnel sent the required amount either before the order
 was received or punctually.  In the division's hospitals, not one wounded soldier
 died because of insufficient care and treatment;
 Tested in combat, the rate of weapons and vehicles received in good condition by
 the entire division was over 99 percent;
 ... ... [ellipses as published]
 When we gathered their experiences in this respect for our news story, the first
 thing spoken of was the leaders' serious attention to logistics.  In their own
 words, those who are the ones known to be in command in military and political
 work must look ahead and "behind."  When we asked the division's commander and
 political commissar why they paid so much attention to logistics work, their talk
 never left the word "change."
 They talked about three "changes."
 The first is the change in weapons and equipment.  Even if our weapons and equip-
 ment still lag behind those of the Soviet and American armed forces, there has
 been a great change, and supplying mullet plus rifles has changed into making
 heavy weapons primary.  This change shows that combat cannot be sustained by the
 amount of ammunition, fuel, and food a unit can carry with it.  The three heavy

 machineguns of a machinegun platoon in 14 hours fire 5,600 rounds.  With this large
 an expenditure of ammunition, it must depend primarily on continual replenishment
 by logistics.  If we were to say that, in the past, war supported itself, mainly
 obtaining weapons and equipment from the enemy, then now they are primarily obtained
 from the "rear."
 The second change is the battlefield.  Modern warfare is three-dimensional; specif-
 ically on a battlefield there is no sharp division between front and rear.  The
 enemy's large-caliber artillery can hit a division's rear.  In this war against
 Vietnam, the enemy basically had no usable aircraft and his artillery power was
 extremely limited, so that he could only adopt the method of surprise attacks by
 small detachments against our rear.  This poses for us not only the problem of
 whether the rear can supply and relieve the troops but also the problem of whether
 it can protect itself.  As warfare becomes more modernized, this latter problem
 becomes more acute.
 The third change is in our logistical setup.  In the past, the logistical trans-
 porters of a division or regiment were several horse-drawn carts and later several
 trucks.  Now the logistical setup is much bigger and several hundreds of vehicles
 transport ammunition, fuel, and food to the front.  On the move they form a line
 and when stopped, a large column, making a fairly big target.  Suitable deployment
 zones, tight organizational command, and capable defense measures--all these things
 are matters for great concern.
 After talking about these changes, the division's commander and political commissar
 sighed with deep emotion:  Logistics, rear services--this word "rear" does not
 have the meaning it originally had.  It is a decisive factor!  Therefore, they
 held that it is necessary to correct the pet phrase popular in the unit--"equal
 consideration for military and political affairs."
 The division's commander and political commissar told us:  In the past the phrase
 "equal consideration for military and political affairs" was normally put forward
 .by those of us in primary command of the division's military and political affairs.
 It is true that military work and political work cannot be absolutely separated.
 However, those who are in primary command are responsible for the overall work of
 the unit, and if one puts forward this pet phrase (or slogan), then where does
 one put logistics work"  Logistics is an important part of the overall work of
 the unit.  No matter whether in wartime or peacetime, it occupies an equally
 important position in the minds of those in primary command as does military work
 and political work.   Whether in wartime or peacetime, the cadres in charge must
 "grasp logistics."
 Their tentative method for grasping logistics was:
 They assigned responsibility for logistics but did not separate themselves from
 logistics.  In line with the characteristics of this war against Vietnam, they
 assigned a deputy commander of the division to exercise direct organizational
 command over logistics.  But they assigned responsibility for logistics while
 not separating themselves from logistics.  While directing the fighting at the
 front, they frequently inquired about the situation with regard to the work of

 insuring logistics and issued operational instructors.  It is the same in peacetime,
 when, besides the deputy being in charge of logistics work, the division's commander
 and political commissar regularly concern themselves with this work.  In the second
 half of last year, each regiment engaged in small-scale camp  and field training
 in insuring logistics against a tactical background, and the political commissar,
 who manages work from headquarters, made inspections in the field on several
 occasions.  At meetings of the divisional [party] standing committee, they repeatedly
 stressed that "logistics training must go forward."  Thus, beginning in the second
 half of last year, training in logistics to meet the requirements of wartime was
 launched in every aspect in order to lay a foundation for this "fighting logistics."
 They released the rear but did not allow the rear to be lost.  In fighting a war,
 in order to prevent logistics from being "lost" in the rear, they took a series
 of measures.  For example:  They gave the logistics deployment an adequate number
 of communications tools so that during the entire course of a battle communication
 between the front and the rear command posts was maintained without a break; the
 commander's operational intent and the unit's plan of action were relayed as timely
 as possible to the rear command post, so that the work of insuring logistical
 support was prepared for and foreseen; and every time after the position was shifted,
 ....the division's commander and political commissar, if the situation permitted, would---
 personally inspect the logistics deployment area, and if they discovered problems
 they promptly corrected them.
 Logistics safeguards the unit, and the unit also safeguards logistics.  Before the
 war, they gave consideration to the fact that the existing logistics establishment
 was unsuitable for fighting, so they appropriately beefed up the cadre contingent
 concerned.  During the war, in order to deal with the Vietnamese army's habitual
 feature of making harassing attacks on our rear, besides improving the logistics
 unit's ability to defend themselves, from beginning to end they attached a reserve
 military force of one battalion (at a very few times two companies) to the logistics
 unit, vigorously increased the rear's strength to warn itself, defend itself, and
 protect its transport, and freed the logistics detachments from the fear of distur-
 bances in their rear.  From beginning to end in the war, the enemy was given no
 opportunity and could only direct sniper fire from distant mountain tops at our
 logistics, which came through unscathed.

 INFANTRY SCHOOL IMPROVES TRAINING BY USING VIETNAM WAR EXAMPLES
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 10 Sep 79 p 3
 [Article by Xu Kedi [1776 0344 4877 et al.:  "Use Actual Combat Experiences To
 Enrich Teaching Content"]
 [Text]  The Ji'nan Units Infantry School has paid full attention to using the
 experiences of the war of self-defensive counterattack on the China-Vietnam border
 in order to enrich its teaching content, improve its teaching methods, and raise
 its teaching quality.
 The school has enriched its teaching content with models of battles in the war
 of self-defensive counterattack.  Formerly, many examples of our army's battles
 in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea were taught in detail.  The
 students' reaction to these battles was that they were far removed from the present,
 some did not suit the demands of modern warfare, and they were not very interesting
 to study.  But the typical battles from the war of self-defensive counterattack,
 everybody felt, were not far removed from the present, were of practical signifi-
 cance, and what was said about  them carried weight.  Based on its own teaching
 content, each teaching and research section gathered together and put in order some
 examples of battles by units that had taken part in the war, thereby enriching
 its teaching and obtaining good results.  The service arm teaching and research
 section collected information on battles in this war through three channels:  by
 making extracts of relevant documents written and notices issued by upper levels
 concerning battles and data on them; by collecting reports published in newspapers
 on the course of, experiences in, and heroic deeds of the war; and by writing to
 border defense units in Gaungxi and Yunnan that had taken part in the war and
 asking them about relevant battles.  Afterward the section made comparisons, did
 research, and compiled  the written materials that were then added to teaching
 materials and teaching plans.  For the teaching on the 82 mm mortar alone, 12
 battle examples were used, the teaching on armored troops used 10 battle examples,
 and the teaching was effectively coordinated.  The political work and party history
 teaching and research section used the experience in political work of the units
 that had taken part in the war to enrich the teaching content related to. wartime
 political work, and in every class examples taken from units that had taken part
 in the war were listed, a practice which was welcomed by the students.
 The school assimilated both the positive and negative experiences of the war of
 self-defensive counterattack, and led the students to improve their technical level

 and organizational command capability.  First, the instructors synthesized the ter-
 rain features of Vietnam and clearly expounded to the students the position and
 function of terrain in combat, and moreover strengthened training in moving
 according to the azimuth under all sorts of terrain conditions.  Second, the
 students studied examples of how the commanders at every level of the units that
 took part in the war repeatedly  reconnoitered the enemy situation and the ter-
 rain, and, on this basis, made up their minds, thus making the students recognize
 the close connection between reconnaissance and deciding what to do, become aware
 of the important link of reconnaissance:in the sequence of organizational command,
 and that it is an important basis for deciding what to do.  Third, the instructors
 synthesized the combat experiences of units that had taken part in the war, edu-
 cating the students to apply tactical principles with imagination, to judge the
 hour and size up the situation, and to flexibly wipe out the enemy.  For example,
 in the tactical training for company-level attacks, the students learned how the
 units that had taken part in the war, focusing on the characteristics of the
 Vietnamese army's defensive deployment--what was exposed was false and what was
 concealed was true, combining the overt and the covert--employed the tactics of
 frontal pinning down, making flank attacks, tearing open a hole in the enemy line,
 rolling up both flanks, and springing out at the enemy from our interior positions
 and coming down on him from higher positions, showing the importance of the com-
 manders being flexible in command.  Fourth, the students learned the experiences
 and lessons of how the combined arms commanders of units that had taken part in
 the war applied each service arm in combat, so as to improve the students' organi-
 zational command abilities in combined arms operations.  The armored forces
 teaching group, when teaching about the armored forces and the three forms of
 infantry-tank coordination, introduced lessons on how some commanders of the units
 that had taken part in the war had used amphibious tanks to storm fortified posi-
 tions and had directed tanks to climb slopes that exceeded their technical capacity.
 At the same time, it introduced the frontline experience on how the 3d Battalion
 of a certain tank unit had, with its firepower, supported infantry in destroying
 117 enemy firing points, as well as how a certain tank regiment had coordinated
 with infantry in an operation in which not one infantryman or tank was lost, and,
 comparing the positive and negative aspects, profoundly and vividly explained
 problems.
 In line with the experiences of the units that had taken part in the war, the
 instructors enriched the training content with some actual combat requirements.
 With regard to the tactics of attack and defense at the squad level and below,
 they stressed good training in attacking enemy firing points with small groups
 over many routes and in attacking tanks, enriching the content with regard to
 trench warfare, search-and-destroy missions, and the cleaning up of the battle-
 field; the engineering class, based on the experiences and lessons of the war
 against Vietnam strengthened training in mine laying and removal; the antichemical
 warfare class enriched its content with the applied principles of the tactical
 and technical functions of flamethrowers and flamethrowing detachments; the artil-
 lery class strengthened organizational command training with regard to the shoulder-
 firing of the 82-mm recoilless rifle and the simple and convenient ways of firing
 the 82-mm mortar, and also strengthened the live-ammunition firing content; and
 the firing class added to its content firing while wearing gas masks and firing
 at aircraft.

 INFANTRY SCHOOL REFORMS TEACHING OF STAFF WORK
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 10 Sep 79 p 3
 [Article by Kao Shuhua [5072 2579 5478] et al.:   "Let Battle Documents Be Geared
 To Actual Combat"]
 [Text]  In the teaching of and training in staff work in the Wuhan Units Infantry
 School, the students learn about and apply the experiences of the war of self-
 defensive counterattack against Vietnam.  With speed in mind,. the school has
 conscientiously streamlined and reformed battle documents.  Good results have been
 obtained.
 In the past in its teaching of and training in staff work, this school had given
 its students many assignments, that consisted of writing battle documents, which
 occupied a large amount of their time.  Many students raised this question:  "Are
 all these battle documents produced by one battle?"  The leaders of the school
 and its training department did conscientious research on the characteristics of
 headquarters work during the war of self-defensive counterattack and clearly saw:
 In a battle the situation changes suddenly and time is pressing, and this demands
 that documents be written and issued quickly.  If the number of battle documents
 are excessive, this inevitably will create a strain on staff manpower, affect the
 timely understanding of the situation at lower levels, and affect the transmission
 to the lower levels of the commander's intentions and decisions.  Therefore, the
 streamlining and reform of battle documents is an important topic in teaching
 staff work.
 The leaders of the school and its training department mobilized the instructors
 and students to suggest ways and means for reforming battle documents.  Through
 group assignments in education and training, they found out some methods for
 reforming battle documents.  1. Return orders for merging and make one piece of
 writing serve more than one purpose.  By amalgamating into one document for trans-
 mission to lower levels directives that are more or less alike in content but
 that set down tasks that are not completely alike, we can reduce the number of
 documents and make one piece of writing serve more than one purpose.  For example,
 when making assignments for writing directives on camouflage and air raid defense,
 if the directives are written separately, this will not only waste time and energy
 but also be duplicative.  Consequently, the students merged the two directives into
 one document, so that the students raced against time and were trained in the
 ability to summarize.  2. By grasping quality and conciseness in writing, documents

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100100001-6

 are made brief and to the point.  In the past students of staff work, when writing
 documents setting down their prebattle orders, overstuffed their writing with regard
 to the part about the enemy's situation, and the documents were fairly long.  During
 the teaching and training, the leaders of the school and its training department
 organized the students to study how to write the prebattle orders concisely.  In
 their assignments, the students conscientiously polished their writing, deliberated
 carefully, and shortened,, made pithy, and clear at one glance the documents con-
 taining prebattle orders.  3. By adopting formulated standard forms, the number
 of words in a document are reduced.  The items on preprinted and compressed standard
 document forms are filled in.  In this way, the number of words are few, time is
 saved, and standardization is enhanced.  4. By using all sorts of communications
 instruments to verbally transmit directives to lower levels, the number of written
 documents is reduced.  In a battle there are many communications instruments of
 all sorts.  By using these instruments to transmit. directives and orders to the
 lower levels of a unit, the same result can be achieved as by writing documents.
 In teaching and training, the students use telephones, walkie-talkies, and signals
 to transmit directives and orders to the lower levels.  This method, which only
 requires the writing of a simple outline and a little preparation and checking,
 is. comparatively fast and convenient.  5. With regard to combined and separate
 orders, make separate orders primary.   Orders can be written separately and trans-
 mitted to the lower levels separately in line with their greater or lesser impor-
 tance and urgency, so that both the writing and the transmission are done quickly,
 thereby overcoming the faulty situation in which the transmission of combined
 orders to the lower levels ties up the communications instruments for too long
 a time, and meeting the requirements of actual combat.
 Through the streamlined and reformed method for battle documents used by this
 school, the students are organized, in all sorts of weather, terrain, and condi-
 tions, to carry out training in actual assignments, so that the assignments are
 done quickly and with good quality.  In the past, it took 2 or more hours to
 write a combined order.  Now, to write four separate battle orders.requires only
 about 1 hour.  Everybody reported:  This reform of staff work teaching based on
 the experiences of the war of self-defensive counterattack. is extremely suited
 to the requirements of actual combat.

 SOUTH CHINA SEA FLEET EXPANDS NAVAL TRAINING
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 30 Jan 81 p 1
 [Article by Yu Linsen [0205 2651 2773]:  "South China Sea Fleet Afloat Training
 Center Expands Training Scope.  Classes of Naval Ships Doubled"]
 [Text]  The South China Fleet Afloat Training Center will expand the scope of its
 training this year.  The number of classes of ships taking part in the first class
 will double over last year, and the number of trainees with triple.  Preparations
 to begin training at the afloat training center are, by now, largely completed.
 The afloat training center, which was established on a trial basis last spring,
 marked a major reform by the South China Fleet in the organization of training,
 its content, and methods in order to change the weakness in the technical under-
 pinnings of the forces.  The first group of naval vessels were trained quickly
 in short training cycles and with good quality of training, which earned the gen-
 eral acclaim of the forces.
 In order to meet the needs for more training of specialties and of ships, around
 New Year's time, more than a month was set aside for personnel from surface craft
 groups and submarine groups to study the newly published "Ship Regulations," and
 "Regulations Pertaining to Ship Training," for conscientious summarization of
 the successful experiences and problems that existed in the training of the first
 group of ships, and for continued courageous improvements, supplements to, and
 readjustments in the content of training and methods of training for the various
 types of ships this year.  They have already revised and made more complete 21
 of the former training plans for guided missile escorts, and submarines, and 20
 rules and regulations.  They have also newly devised 18 training plans for sub-
 marine chasers and landing craft.

 ADVANCED WEAPONS SAID NOT WITHOUT LIMITATIONS
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 30 Jan 81 p 3
 [Article by Shi Zhiyuan [4258 1807 6678]:  "What Does the Return of Smoke Screens
 to Front Lines Show?"]
 [Text]  In October 1973, on the fourth day following outbreak of the Mideast War,
 Egyptian forces used portable "Sageer" [5646 2706 1422] anti-tank missiles, and
 were able after only 2 hours of use, to totally annihilate the Israeli 190 armorade
 brigade and take prisoner the brigade commander, Colonel Yaguli [0068 0657 6849].
 After being severely hurt, Israel immediately coldly analyzed and studied new
 countermeasures, deciding to use as their principal countermeasure smokescreen
 cover.  This method was very effective.  Within a short time Israeli forces re-
 crossed the Suez Canal, and under cover of massive smokescreens, launched a coun-
 terattack against Egyptian forces in the Taosuo [one character illegible] [7118
 4792 ? ] sector.  Because of the smokescreen cover, the kill rate for Egyptian
 anti-tank missiles dropped, and an armored task force composed of several hundred
 commandoes successfully crossed to the west bank of the Suez Canal in a single
 action on a pontoon bridge constructed by Egyptian forces south of Ismailia.  Sub-
 sequently, Israeli forces made'large scale use of all kinds of smokescreens, which
 played a substantial role. in assuring combat mobility for military units.
 This war experience offers food for thought.  Given modern weapons and modern tech-
 nical equipment, use of smokescreens for traditional screening, camouflaging, and
 confusing, had been thought by many to be seemingly out of date.  In the 1960's,
 the United States began to disband its camouflage units, and in the 1970's, the
 Soviet Union also generally spoke, of smokescreens in terms of not giving much
 attention to their development.  After the role of smokescreens was made evident
 in the Mideast War, further attention of military forces in all countries of the
 world was aroused for a time, and use of smokescreens was evaluated anew.  All
 countries acknowledge that modern warfare cannot be without cover, and that smoke-
 screens may be used to obstruct enemy use of advanced reconnaissance devices such
 as infra-red, electronics, and lasers in finding their objectives.  In combat under
 nuclear conditions, smokescreens are also able to weaken the strength of radiation.
 Consequently, the American armed forces have worked up plans for the development of
 smokescreens, and the Soviet armed forces have put forward combat methods entail-
 ing use of smokescreens.  In their maneuvers, the West German armed forces have
 made great use of smokescreen laying devices.  Quite a few countries are also en-
 gaged in continued research and development of smoke emitting artillery shells,
 nautical shells, and'rockets.

 The case of the "retiring" smokescreen, which deprived anti-tank missiles of their
 dominance, made people think.  It demonstrated that the superiority of weapons and
 equipment is not omnipotent and the logic of "everything having its vanquisher."
 Under certain conditions, advanced weapons may lose their force or be unable to
 attain the full play of their intended force while relatively antiquated weapons
 and equipment may frequently play a role such as advanced weapons and equipment
 cannot easily play.  China's armed forces had gotten rid of their 60 mm guns, but
 in self-defense combat against Vietnam, the 60 mm gun showed its mettle in anni-
 hilating dispersed and concentrated enemy forces operating from defilade.  Flame-
 throwers, which were preparing to "say goodbye," also showed their skills in wiping
 out "moles" in self-defense combat against the Vietnamese.
 This leads to the thought that in our study of the countermeasures of using inferi-
 ority to triumph over superiority, we must both bear in mind that future battle-
 fields will be filled with modern weapons and equipment, and also realize fully
 and make the best use of the advantages of existing weapons and equipment.  Con-
 tentment with the existing situation is not good, of course, but to shake one's
 head and sigh when looking at existing equipment should not be either.  It must be
 understood that superior equipment has its weaknesses, and inferior equipment also
 has its strengths.  A clear understanding of the adversary's weaknesses and our
 own strengths is an indispensable prerequisite of a policy for seeking to make the
 most of advantages while attacking disadvantages.

 SUPERIOR VS INFERIOR WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT REVIEWED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 30 Jan 81 p 3
 [Article by Li Kexin [2621 0668 0207], Chengdu Command:  "Superior Versus Infe-
 rior"]
 [Text]  Logically speaking, superior equipment should triumph over inferior equip-
 ment, but in the history of warfare countless surprising cases have occurred in
 which inferior equipment triumphed over superior equipment.  It may be seen that
 the triumph of the inferior over the superior positively was no accident.
 In A.D. 1140, after Jin Wushu invaded the Central Plain and launched several in-
 jurious attacks against Yue Fei, he attacked Yue Fei in his encampment at Yancheng,
 using.a "phalanx of horses" trained by Wanmutuochi and Wanmutuoze.  Five of Yue
 Fei's generals were killed in action when the opposing army's "phalanx of horses"
 launched spears and fired arrows.  When Yue Fei heard the news, he said through
 tear-filled eyes:  "I had known about the 'phalanx of armored horses,' which Hu
 Yanzhuo had used some years ago.   Xu Ning reported that a 'phalanx of spears with
 hooks' can destroy them."  In compliance with orders, Meng Bangjie and others be-
 gan the training of soldiers in the use of a "phalanx of spears with hooks," later
 on finally defeating and routing the "phalanx of horses."
 According to the description provided in "Shui Hu Zhuan," at the time Hu Yanzhuo's
 "phalanx of horses" was terrifying.  "The men wore long helmets to protect their
 heads, exposing only their eyes.  The horses were bedecked with heavy armor and
 decorated with red tassels with only their legs uncovered."  "Thirty horses were
 placed in a single formation and locked together with iron rings.  When they met
 the enemy, those formations in the distance used arrows and those close up used
 spears to thrust forward."  In the eyes of the ancients, this "phalanx of horses"
 looked the way massed tanks look today.  They were very awe-inspiring.  According
 to Tang Long's description, there was nothing complicated about the "phalanx of
 spears with hooks."  "All that is necessary is to make them, and then they can be
 used."  In the same way that we regard rocket launchers today, they could only be
 considered light weapons.  Nevertheless, that the easily fabricated "phalanx of
 spears with hooks" was able to triumph over the "phalanx of horses," which was
 unexcelled in all the world, certainly makes people think, does it not?
 In combat, the superiority or inferiority of arms and equipment makes a very im-
 portant difference between triumph and tragedy; however, no weapon or equipment
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100100001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100100001-6
 is omnipotent. They all have shortcomings to match their strengths.  Superiority
 in arms alone is no assurance of victory, and inferiority in equipment alone posi-
 tively does not ordain defeat.  The "phalanx of horses" was not able to save Jin
 Wushu from defeat, and the "phalanx of spears with hooks" won victory for Yue
 Fei's forces, which shows this principle.  Napoleon paid close attention to the
 use of new material means in warfare, and he was a "military master" at devising
 new combat tactics, yet he resolutely rejected the view that arms and equipment
 superiority are decisive in victory or defeat in warfare.  He said, "In warfare,
 morale and weapons count in a ratio of three to one."  Aside from whether or not
 this is a correct proportion, that he gave attention to morale even when giving
 attention to weapons was correct beyond all doubt.
 In comparison with China's major combat protagonists, the protagonists are superior
 and China is inferior in weapons and equipment.  This is an objective reality.  As
 economic construction develops, the weapons and equipment of China's armed forces
 will gradually improve, but no fundamental prospect of improvement is in sight dur-
 ing the short term.  In order to win victory in a future war against aggression,
 the most realistic and the most reliable way is to find means in the use of exist-
 ing armaments and seek countermeasures whereby inferiority can triumph over supe-
 riority.
 Can victory be attained through existing armaments?  This is the same as asking
 whether a way out can be found with existing armaments.  I believe so!  In his
 book, "The Bankruptcy of Atomic Strategy," the military theoretician most able in
 all the world to inspire the human heart, the French-born Czech, F.O. Mikexie
 [phonetic] [4717 0344 6200] made the following observation:  "Well-trained soldiers
 frequently possess the ability to use simple weapons to destroy the enemy's com-
 plex weaponry.  Such a capability increases daily as the large scale use of modern
 weapons increases (and the strength of highly mechanized military forces is deter-
 mined by the proper use of these modern weapons).  Consequently, simple weapons
 have become an effective means to checkmate complex, precision weapons.  In life
 too, such situations frequently occur in which complex implements are hard put to
 counter simple implements; consequently it is still necessary to employ simple im-
 plements."  This Czech has spoken eminently sensibly, and reality has long since
 attested to this.  Wasn't the "phalanx of spears with hook" destruction of the
 "phalanx of horses," just such an extremely persuasive example of how simple weap-
 ons can triumph over complex weapons?"
 In countering an enemy armed with modern weapons, if we have armaments more ad-
 vanced than his, naturally nothing could be better.  However, when one's armaments
 cannot catch up with those of one's enemies and one uses tanks to go up against
 the enemy's tanks, or pits airplane against the enemy's airplanes, one is bound
 to come to grief.  Conversely, use of some insufficient indigenous armaments and
 simple weapons such as satchel charges or small rocket launchers in conjunction
 with flexible and ingenious tactics makes it possible to overwhelm the enemy's
 "T-72," or even the most advanced "T-80."  Strange?  Not at all.  During the war
 of liberation as during the campaign to oppose American and aid Korea, our two
 legs often won the competition against the enemy's 10 wheels.  This was not be-
 cause motor vehicles do not run as fast as people, but because motor vehicle move-
 ments are limited by roads while people can climb mountains and ford streams.
 They can go even where the roads don't go.  Were two-wheeled horsecarts used to

 pursue and attack the enemy's 10-wheeled trucks, they would be no match for the
 enemy, it is feared.  The idea that "everything has its vanquisher" most certainly
 does not mean that the superior will overcome the inferior or that the foreign
 will overcome the indigenous.      Many times the inferior can vanquish the superior,
 and the indigenous can vanquish the foreign.  Things are strange in this way!
 Naturally, simply because the inferior may triumph over the superior does not mean
 one will naturally be victorious without any need for objective efforts.  It is
 very important to create conditions for the inferior to triumph over the superior.
 For example, study of the enemy's and our own strong and weak points, and real
 exploration and development of combat tactics whereby one's own strengths triumph
 over the enemy's weaknesses to constantly improve upon and master available arms
 and equipment, and make the maximum effective use of them is an indispensable con-
 dition for the triumph of inferiority over superiority.  At that time, Xu Ning's
 phalanx of spears with hooks tactics employed spears that had seven hooks along
 the top and mid portion of the spears, and three hooks in concealed positions on
 the lower end.  This entire set of tactics using spears was created with the strong
 and weak points of the "phalanx of horses" in mind.  Had there been only the
 "phalanx of spears with hooks" without the numerous variations in tactical employ-
 ment of the spears, they would not have been able to break the "phalanx of horses."
 All weapons can produce great force only when proficiently and effectively used,
 and when their use is linked to correct and compatible tactics.
 Combat history also presents a phenomenon such as the following.  Once a new
 weapon is born, in order to get fullest effectiveness from it in combat, a process
 of constant understanding, constant study, and constant development is necessary.
 The good men in Liangshan used the "phalanx of spears with hooks" to destroy the
 "phalanx of horses" of Hu Yanzhuo, and Yue Fei used similar methods to defeat Jin
 Wushu, but Yue Fei used broad swords in conjunction with the "phalanx of spears
 with hooks"-to cut the horses legs in the "phalanx of horses," a tactic which more
 effectively developed the power of the "phalanx of spears with hooks."
 Though people such as Fu Le [1381 0510] [phonetic], Lideer Hate [2621 1795 1422]
 [0761 3676] [phonetic], and De Gaulle theoretically explored the use of tanks,
 nevertheless, the potential of tanks was fully recognized by the German, Gudelian
 [0657 1795 6849 1344] [phonetic] and flexibly employed.  Though our arms and equip-
 ment are fairly old, one cannot say that we are able to employ these weapons and
 equipment with the greatest proficiency possible, technically or tactically.  In
 my view there is much that remains to be done in this regard, and a great poten-
 tial to be tapped.
 If I may go on for a few sentences more, this article positively does not deny the
 urgency and importance of developing new weapons and equipment.  Could any who
 aspire to the building of a modern army not cease to want advanced weapons and
 equipment?  The issue is that we cannot just sit and wait for advanced weapons
 and equipment, but must confidently endeavor to study tactical techniques whereby
 the inferior can overwhelm the superior.  Use of available equipment to triumph
 over an enemy is not just wishful thinking; it is attainable in fact.

 tain Airforce Unit in the Airforce Proposes This Year's Integrated Training Plan"]
 [Text]  Report from KONGJUN BAO [Airforce News], 8 January.  How will integrated
 training be done in this new year?  Early last November a certain airforce unit in
 the Airforce convened an integrated training conference to summarize experiences,
 in which they proposed to proceed from the simple to the complex, and from the
 known to the unknown.
 As of the end of October last year, each of the divisions of this airforce unit
 organized four to six integrated training sessions to explore in a preliminary way
 some experiences.  The sessions also revealed some problems.  After full study of
 problems in last year's integrated training, they proposed concrete ideas and plans
 as follows.  Divisions will continue once monthly training exercises, and armies
 will hold them once each quarter.  Organizationally, the ranking officer will be
 in charge.  Combat and training units will work together and jointly take charge,
 with combat units making up schedules and training units making plans in a system
 that divides and combines tasks with the emphasis on combining.  Individual train-
 ing results will be reflected in the air.  Prominence goes to officers in charge
 of training, and officers in charge will sing "the leading role" in combat.  This
 year's training plans call for divisional and wing officers in charge to be given
 integrated command classes and study integrated command skills.  Pilots should
 intensify their study of enemy military strength and tactics and disabuse them-
 selves of wishful thinking.

 Focuses On Assembling Battalion, Company, and Platoon Cadres for Training"]
 [Text]  From early to mid-January, a certain engineering regiment in the Wuhan Com-
 mand focused on filling in gaps by taking firmly in hand assembly for training of
 battalion, company, and platoon cadres in order to increase cadre command capabil-
 ities and teaching levels, thereby creating conditions for doing a good job in
 training in the coming year.
 The assembling of cadres for training in advance of the beginning of training is
 something the regiment does annually.  In former years, this assembling for train-
 ing simply used a uniform training method in accordance with annual training plans
 in a step by step, simple preparation of classes, with insufficiently serious atten-
 tion being given cadre command capabilities and teaching levels.  As a result, not
 many breakthroughs ever occurred in unit training.  This year, the Regiment CCP Com-
 mittee determined to change this state of affairs.                 Taking account of cadre lack of
 study of the tactics of engineering troops during combat involving combined forces,
 and the major ingredients in this year's applied training in tactics, they orga-
 nized cadres taking the training to concentrate on the study and exploration of
 how, in the course of offensive combat involving combined forces, mobile safe-
 guarding units blaze a trail for the infantry, tanks, and artillery, how they re-
 connoiter and remove mine fields and other obstacles from in front of enemy posi-
 tions, how they construct for all branches of service urgently needed defense works
 of all kinds, and how they camouflage various kinds of fortifications.  Following
 more than 2 weeks study and exploration, the cadre trainees drafted a 14 point
 tactical thinkpiece and a 92 point lesson plan for safeguarding the combined forces
 in combat, which took account of the enemy's equipment, combat characteristics,
 and reconnaissance methods.  In addition, they used these lesson plans and think
 pieces in follow-up teaching demonstrations and simulated exercises.
 When the training was over, the cadres summarized two major advantages of this
 kind of assembling for training.  First, it was valuable in pooling the efforts
 and wisdom of everyone for a vigorous attack on trouble spots, and in increasing
 cadre command capabilities and the level of their teaching skills.  Formerly, many
 cadres had only a superficial understanding of these courses.  This time, however,

 as a result of everyone putting the situation on the table and showing difficul-
 ties for joint study of ways to break the enemy's plans, battalion, company, and
 platoon cadres were able to organize, within the scope of their own echelon, ac-
 tions by mobile safeguarding units and barrier emplacement units to handle various
 kinds of complex situations.                                                    Second, it was valuable in increasing the level of
 tactical skills of units.  Formerly, cadres themselves were. unable to explain
 clearly the content of this training, and the more the soldiers listened to them,
 the more confused they became.  Now, cadres at all echelons. are able to organize
 fairly well, to carry into effect, and to teach this important course, and the
 soldiers are able to study and practice it more.

 [Article by Chai Wu [2693 0702] and Ke Jun [4430 6511]:  "Certain Army Readjusts
 Training Deployments in Accordance with Strategic Plans; Emphasizes Strong Posi-
 tional Defense Combat Courses"]
 [Text]  Acting in accordance with strategic policy readjustments in training plans
 decided on by the Central Military Affairs Commission, a certain army of the Bei-
 jing Command has decided this year to stress strong positional defense combat
 training.
 In laying out its training plans, this army has diligently carried out the Mili-
 tary Affairs Commission's strategic plan for active defense, in a change from the
 former disjointedness between the content of training and unit combat tasks.
 Starting with the characteristics of the combat zone, it has required units re-
 sponsible for holding fast in defensive combat tasks to emphasize study of prob-
 lems in how to use strong positions, how to hold fast for long period of time,
 and independent combat.  Units responsible for reserve unit tasks will mainly
 study how to conceal high speed ground mobility, how to rely on nucleus positions
 to launch counterattacks, how to engage in combat against airborne troops, and how
 to coordinate with militia in the combat zone to launch guerrilla warfare.  Logis-
 tical organizations and companies will study mostly problems in how to eat, live,
 and fight in conditions of extreme cold.   In order to improve training quality,
 this unit also decided that this year's tactical exercises will be moved, to the
 maximum extent possible, to selected combat zones where training will take place.
 Units distant from the combat area will also, insofar as possible, select similar
 terrain for training; units will thereby become familiar with prescribed combat
 plans.
 At the present time, headquarters of this unit is in process of studying posi-
 tional warfare, particularly a series of problems in positional warfare under con-
 ditions of intense cold in order to formulate for the forces positional warfare
 training plans.  The organization has already issued all training materials to
 the company level.  Five advanced companies have begun training to gather train-
 ing experiences for the unit.

 BEAT SUPERIOR FORCES WITH INFERIOR FORCES

 [Article by staff reporters Zhao Jun [6392 7786] and Yang Songlin [2799 2646
 2651]:  "Make Efforts To Master the Skills To Handle Existing Weapons and
 Equipment; To Enhance Combat Capabilities To Beat Superior Forces With
 Inferior Forces, a Certain Army Stresses Readjustment of Basic Training"]
 [Text]  To enhance the combat capabilities of troops to beat superior forces
 with inferior forces, key responsible cadres of divisions and regiments
 subordinate to a certain army were called together for a study session during
 the last 10 days of January.  They unanimously held that time and energy
 should be devoted to mastering skills to handle existing weapons and equipment.
 A typical case was analyzed in the course of discussion.  Previously, an
 overwhelming majority of the companies had had a very high hit accuracy when
 they practiced basic firing.  At the end of last year, however, the percentage
 of hits was very low when the army assessed several outstanding companies in
 tactics-related background.   Everybody should notice from these instances that
 although our weapons and equipment are not up to date, they cannot be used
 with maximum efficiency, because we have, not developed the necessary skills
 in handling them.  If we desire to beat superior forces with inferior forces,
 it is necessary to concentrate our efforts on mastering basic skills to handle
 existing weapons and equipment.
 In line with this thinking, basic training for the first half of this year was
 rearranged and readjusted.  Training in positional defense. warfare in every
 unit was made to center on combat missions and on the characteristics of a future
 war theater and they strengthened positional defense combat training.  It was
 further urged that more time and energy be put into hard efforts to master
 the basic skills of the "three ways of fighting and the three defenses" and
 the cadre basic skills of organization and command.  Moreover, during the
 period of basic training, every training division or regiment must conduct
 separate combined-arms training instead of the "all-cooked-in-the-same-pot"
 type of training.

 They also proposed that:  1.       Space, equipment, ammunition and funds be allocated
 and utilized in a scientific manner, which would enable limited material
 conditions to come into full play; 2. Popularizing a rational plan for the
 utilization of space, equipment., and instructors called the "9 Step Tank
 Attack Training Method," produced by a certain regiment by drawing on the
 experience of other units; 3. Popularizing the.eperience of a certain
 division's artillery regiment which provided a several-fold increase in the
 opportunity of company commanders to organize and lead live-ammunition
 practice without increasing the amount of ammunition used.  Besides, energetic
 support must be given to develop troop training through thrift and hard work,
 use substitutes and simulation equipment to the full, and to accomplish more
 at small expense, or even at no expense at all.

 NEW TACTICS OF ATTACKING TANKS BY INFANTRYMEN ADVOCATED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 16 Feb 81 p 2
 [Article by Wu Zhen [0702 7201]:  "The Training Method of Attacking Tanks by
 Infantrymen Must Be Changed"]
 [Text]  To, at present, utilize our army's tanks with their existing equipment
 to safeguard an effective attack on tanks by infantrymen, as I see it, poses
 several problems which deserve our serious attention.
 First, the quality of training fails to meet the anticipated demands.  Training
 of the troops in peacetime usually conforms to the infantry's demands and a
 majority of the tanks are individual vehicles.  They also move at such a speed
 that the foot soldiers can climb up on them or hand up satchel charges to
 facilitate attacks on other tanks.  It is impossible to acquire first-rate
 combat capabilities by this training method because the enemy's attack is
 expected to assemble a large number of tanks in a definite combat formation
 and carry out a high-speed assault in great depth supported by intense air
 and artillery fire along with the coordinated efforts of the infantry.   (At
 worst, the enemy might use nuclear weapons as well as chemical weapons.)
 It is highly unlikely that the enemy would move slowly with individual tanks
 to meet our attack.  Undoubtedly, to deal with the enemy's tank attack by
 our present method of attacking tanks by infantrymen will invite disaster.
 Second, our present method is simply not economical.  One Chinese-made tank
 is worth several hundred thousand yuan.  One motor-hour costs 350 yuan.  The
 armies of the economically much more powerful nations such as the United States,
 the Soviet Union, Britain and France still cannot afford to use equipped tanks
 as safeguard vehicles in tank-attack training, but we have been doing so
 all along.  In 1980, the tank regiments subordinate to various armies and
 divisions averaged 200 motor-hours in supporting tank-attack training by the
 infantry.  It cost 70,000 yuan for a tank regiment alone.  How much would it
 have cost for a whole army?  Troop training must be economical.  In view of
 our nation's weak economic capabilities, we cannot very well avoid considering
 this problem.
 Third, a tank is a combat weapon which should not be treated as a safeguard
 vehicles used in training.   In peacetime if a tank is used as a target to
 train the infantry to attack tanks, blasted by satchel charges or hit by
 "concrete bombs" [3055 3136 1734], this turn of events would affect not only

 the tank's outward appearance, but.also damage its spare parts.  This would
 directly result in a decline in the level of tank combat readiness on the one
 hand and an increase in the loss of combat ready vehicle motor-hours on the
 other.
 And fourth, a prerequisite for fighting in coordination is to train in combined
 arms.  Since the problem of tank-attack training was raised, the infantry
 and tank units have been carrying out their basic training separately.  The
 tank units sent tanks to the infantry's training area to be used as target
 vehicles.  Combined training and joint maneuvers were both scarce.  With little
 or no combined training, not only would.:it be difficult for the infantry to
 master the real skills needed to attack enemy tank masses, but the commanding
 officers of combined arms units would be incapable of or not very good at
 organizing combined operations.
 In the light of our nation's present economic situation and for the purpose of
 enhancing the combat capabilities of infantry subunits to attack tanks and
 raising the level of coordinated infantry-tank combat, it is my suggestion that
 the motor-hours used for supporting tank-attack training by infantrymen should
 be concentrated and used for the coordinated training of the infantry and tanks
 and for joint maneuvers of the various arms.  In that case, can we abandon
 the training of attacking tanks by infantrymen?  The answer is that this training
 must be carried on.  However, its method should be revised.  It may be conducted
 jointly with individual vehicle, platoon and company tactical training and with
 tank driving firing training.  For instance, when tank driving training is in
 progress, the infantry subunits in groups may, on the driving ground or in the
 nearby area where tanks pass, take advantage of favorable terrain and grasp the
 moment when the tanks change speed or cross barriers to practice skills and
 tactics for attacking them.  Moreover, when tank subunits practice training
 firing and combat firing at a range, they may arrange that their firing. practice
 be observed by infantry subunits.  Because tank firing in all parts of the
 world appears to be very much the same, observing our army's tank firing
 practice will be helpful not only in organizing coordination between the infantry
 and tank units, but also in studying the method of attacking the enemy tank
 concentrations.  This kind of training will not only solve the problem of the
 training ground, equipment and material used in the training of attacking
 tanks by infantrymen, but will be close to actual combat conditions and tally
 with the tradition of training through thrift and hard work.

 REGULATIONS RESOLVE PROBLEMS IN TRAINING

 "Shenyang Units Armored Force Formulates Ten Regulations in a Standardized
 Training Order for Units and Below the Battalion Level"]
 [Text]  In the latter part of January various units under the Shenyang Units
 armored force began implementing the "10 regulations in a standardized
 training order for units at and below the battalion level" which were worked
 cut by the leadership organ of the armored force.  Commanders and fighters
 said, With this set of standardized training order, basic training is bound
 to achieve results.
 In the latter part of last year, when the leadership organ of the Shenyang Units
 armored forces was testing and evaluating the units' training, it was discovered
 that basic training was still a weak link.  They felt that although there were
 numerous reasons for it, the most important is that the units, especially the
 fenderis at and below the battalion level, lacked a set of specific and
 systematic standardized training order.  Some companies did not show enough
 conscientious effort in following the training outline and manual and, in
 training, did not do things in order such as going from basic to applied
 training and from technical to tactical training.  Hence, training operations
 were random not unified.  Although the upper-level leadership organ had
 formulated and issued various training regulations, they were nonetheless
 quite loosely adhered to when implemented at fenderis at and below the
 battalion level.  In order to resolve this problem, the leadership organ of
 the armored force summed up past experiences, drew lessons from them and worked
 out the "10 regulations in a standardized training order for units at and below
 the battalion level," ensuring that basic training is on the right track and
 is effectively carried out.
 The "regulations" provided a workable guideline for training personnel, time,
 content and quality.  Everything from instructors teaching to students learning,
 from inside the classrooms to out on the training ground and from regular course
 education to daily cultivation are done with specific and clear regulations.
 The "regulations" brought out the cadres' exemplary leadership roles and
 encouraged them to act as examples in implementing various rules and regulations.

 Wuhan Units: "Which Combat Method Should Be Deployed?"]
 [Text]  A reinforced 82mm recoilless artillery gun platoon of the.3d infantry
 company of the red team is set up by the upper level to conduct fortified
 position defense in the Jiaoshan area.  To the east of the defensive position
 is Hill 315 and to the west is Jiaoshan.  The terrain between these two high
 grounds is somewhat flat and a highway runs deep through the bottom of a thin
 bag.
 At the main strong point trenches for soldiers and bunkers for weapons are
 built and wire-mesh and antitank barriers are put up at places.where tank
 movement is unobstructed.  The 1st and 2d platoons are separately defending
 the two strongholds at the east and west sides while the 3d platoon, as a
 reserve unit for the company, is positioned in the back.
 A reinforced company of the right flank of the 6th tank regiment of the blue
 team has already moved into battle formation, getting ready to launch an
 attack against the 3d company in an attempt to break through its defense.  The
 company moved along the highway in a roundabout southeast direction to link
 up with its main forces.  The commander of the 1st Battalion of the red team
 reported the situation to the commander of the 3d company and asked, "On the
 basis of this situation, is your company going to fight by letting the enemy
 penetrate your position or destroy him in front of your position, or are
 you going to employ another combat method?"
 We ask that comrades think this over for the commander of the 3d company of
 the red team and see what combat method should be used.

 PLA UNITS URGED TO STUDY, IMPLEMENT PARTY'S POLICIES
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 27 Feb 81 p 1
 /News report:   "Military Units Strengthen Political and Ideological Work"7
 LTex] In the course of studying and implementing the guidelines of the Central
 Committee Work Conference, PLA units in Nanjing, Chengdu, Kunming, Lanzhou and
 Urumqi; the National Defense Scientific and Technological Commission; and armored,
 engineer, and capital construction engineering corps have discussed and studied
 measures for upholding the four basic principles and for strengthening political and
 ideological work, in conjunction with what they really have in mind with regard to
 work.   They have encouraged PLA units to act as masters of their own country, to
 carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and to resolutely implement the party's
 principles and policies aimed at further readjusting the economy and bringing about
 greater political stability.
 A series of meetings has been called by party committees of these units to conscien-
 tiously convey and study the documents of the Central Committee Work Conference.  By
 accurately analyzing the current situation, they have achieved a clear understanding
 of the requirements for the further readjustment of the national economy, as well as
 of its far-reaching significance.  On that basis, they have focused their attention
 on a discussion of how to uphold the four basic principles and how to gear political
 and ideological work to serve the need for readjusting the economy.  At an enlarged
 meeting of the standing committee of the party committee, principal leading comrades
 of PLA units in Urumqi pointed out:  The army must be determined to maintain
 political unity with the Party Central Committee.   It is necessary to study and
 implement the guidelines of the Central Committee Work Conference and to study basic
 theories.  Only in this way can we clearly understand the relationships between
 allegiance to the four basic principles and the emancipation of the mind, between
 the development of socialist democracy and the improvement of the socialist legal
 system, and between allegiance to party leadership and the thorough implementation
 of the "double hundred" policy, and can we further increase our consciousness of the
 need to uphold the four basic principles.  At a work conference, the party committee
 of the PLA units in Nanjing stressed:  At present, various ways must be devised and
 bold steps must be taken to strengthen education in the four basic principles, which
 will lead commanders and fighters to understand more clearly the current situation
 and firmly implement the line, principles, and policies adopted since the Third
 Plenary Session.  The meeting also studied specific measures for improving education.
 The leading organs of PLA units in Lanzhou called on vast numbers of cadres, and
 especially the leading cadres, to take the lead in upholding the four basic principles,

 to step up investigation and study with a high sense of political responsibility,
 to do a good job in the ideological field, and to unify the thinking of cadres and
 fighters behind the party's line, principles, and policies.  In the course of study,
 leading comrades of the engineer corps have held special meetings to discuss the
 relationship between the building of spiritual civilization and that of material
 civilization.  They have also offered specific opinions on how to strengthen political
 and ideological work and build a high-level spiritual civilization.
 In the course of study and discussion, some units have conscientiously reviewed the
 experiences and lessons in economic construction that we have accumulated since the
 founding of new China.  Through this review, they have further realized that "left"
 deviationist ideology is a big obstacle in the way of efforts to implement the party's
 principles and policies, to readjust the economy, and to preserve stability and unity,
 and that therefore it should be completely eliminated as a shackle of the people'.s
 minds.   The enlarged meeting of the standing committee of the party committee of PLA
 units in Kenming pointed out:  Even today, some people still have not been able to
 free themselves from the shackles of "leftist" ideology.  These comrades always
 observe problems with "left-leaning" eyes, regarding the correct principles and
 policies adopted since the Third Plenary Session as a deviation from the correct
 course.   This "leftist" influence will certainly have an adverse effect on the
 effort to maintain political and ideological unity with the Party Central Committee.
 Comrades who attended the meeting also discussed the problem of how to eliminate
 "left" deviationist ideology.   This problem was studied by principal leading comrades
 when they presided over a forum.  Comrades attending the forum stressed the need to
 conscientiously organize a study of dialectical and historical materialism in con-
 junction with the implementation of the guidelines of the Central Committee Work Con-
 ference and in a way that takes into account actual conditions.   They also emphasized
 the need to study political economy, to eliminate chaos and restore order on the
 theoretical front, to rectify the ideological line, and to bring the thinking of com-
 manders and fighters into line with the party's principles and policies.
 After completing a study program for themselves, party committees of many PLA units
 have conscientiously encouraged various units to study and implement the guidelines
 of the Central Committee Work Conference.  Leading comrades of PLA units in Chengdu
 have visited offices and units, giving them instructive reports, and applying what
 they have learned as a result of study by cadres and fighters to solve problems.
 The party committee of the National Defense Scientific and Technological Commission
 has studied a series of specific measures for conscientiously carrying out scientific
 research and experimental projects, for scaling down capital construction, for
 strengthening military education and training, for consolidating finance departments,
 for practicing frugality and economy, for promoting production, for strengthening
 political, ideological, and organizational work, for rectifying workstyles, for
 strictly disciplining people, and for improving the party's workstyle.   Leading
 members of the party committee of the Capital Construction Engineering Corps were
 divided into groups to visit six units which assume relatively heavy responsibility
 to readjust the scale of capital construction.  While there, they invited cadres to
 talks in order to become acquainted with their ideas, examine their implementation
 of policies, and solve problems with well-defined objectives in mind.  At a time when
 budgets and construction investments are being cut, leaders at all levels have stepped
 up investigation and study, have encouraged the masses to suggest ways and means, and
 have urged those at the top and others at the bottom to work with one mind and one
 heart, share the burdens of the state, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and
 strive to serve the PLA units well.

 Army Academy: "Apply Inferior Force To Defeat a Superior Force and Seek Truth From
 Facts"7                      -
 ZText7 Highlights: To defeat a superior power, an inferior power
 must size up the actual situation of both sides and study
 strategy on the basis of seeking truth from facts.  We should
 avoid underestimating favorable defense conditions and heroic
 human spirit, on the one hand, but on the other we should oppose
 any tendency to overestimate human factors and disregard material
 conditions.  The concept of pitting one against ten or of pitting
 ten against a hundred generally refers to the political quality
 of the proletarian army from a strategic point of view.   It is
 closely tied to another concept concerning the balance of specific
 combat and tactical forces.  But any attempt to confuse the two is
 not permitted.   It seems more realistic to base the study of future
 defensive warfare on the concept of pitting one against one.
 In a future war against aggression, we will have to employ inferior equipment in
 counterattacks against an enemy who has superior weapons.   This is why we are required
 to exhibit confidence that we can defeat a superior power with inferior equipment,
 to take into account the actual conditions of both sides--ourselves and the enemy--
 and to seek truth from facts in considering problems and studying policies.   Under
 no circumstances should we harbor any unrealistic illusions in this connection.
 For example, how many enemy soldiers one of our own soldiers can conquer in defensive
 warfare is a problem that needs to be analyzed by seeking truth from facts.
 At present, opinions are divided over this issue.  One opinion holds that in modern
 defensive warfare, an inferior army can conquer an enemy force three times greater
 than its own if it can give full play to its latent superior potential as defenders.
 (In other words, one of our divisions can resist three enemy divisions.)   Another
 opinion maintains that in confrontation  with an enemy army with equipment that is
 superior to ours, it is not easy to maintain a ratio even of 1 to 1 on the battle-
 field.   (In other words, one of our divisions can be committed to fight one enemy
 division.)   Which opinion actually is correct?

 We must realize that in modern defensive warfare, the number of enemy soldiers one
 of our soldiers is equal to in terms of fighting capability cannot be determined by
 man's subjective wishful thinking but by a realistic analysis of the advantages and
 disadvantages and the strengths and weaknesses on both sides of the dispute.  On
 this matter, we should avoid underestimating favorable defense conditions and heroic
 human spirit, on the one hand, and on the other we should oppose any tendency to
 overestimate human factors and disregard material conditions.  The concept of pitting
 one against ten or pitting ten against a hundred generally refers to the political
 quality of a proletarian army from a strategic point of view.  It is closely tied to,
 but cannot be confused with, another concept of the specific balance of combat and
 tactical forces thrown onto the battlefield by both sides.  The reason is that combat
 strength consists not only of human factors and man's death-defying courage but also
 of weapons and equipment, both inferior and superior, and of tactics and skills in
 using these weapons and equipment.  If we insist on emphasizing human spiritual
 factors in the face of enemy weapons that are far superior to ours, it will be just
 as Lenin sharply criticized, "It is foolish to pit human waves against artillery
 fire and to use pistols to defend fortresses."   ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 1,
 p 669)
 During the early stages of a future war against aggression, an enemy who has equipment
 far superior to ours will attempt to end the war and win victory as soon as possible
 through the use of powerful modern weapons, backed by a highly efficient command
 system.   This being the case, we feel that it is more realistic to study the problem
 on the assumption of a 1:1 ratio on the battlefield.
 To defeat a superior power in defensive warfare, an outnumbered inferior power should
 possess specific favorable conditions.  For example:  well-selected defense positions
 at strategic points that can easily be defended; full preparations for war; close
 coordination in action; seizure of the initiative to attack fatigued enemy troops;
 and so on and so forth.  Among these conditions, however, strength is the most
 essential.   "Inferiority" and "small numbers" are relative terms and should remain
 at a specific level.  If the equipment is so "inferior" and the number of soldiers
 is so "small" that they cannot resist the enemy and win victory, no favorable con-
 ditions will exist for the defenders.  Furthermore, balance of power does not refer
 merely to a balance of quantities.  More importantly, it refers to a balance of
 qualities.   When the characteristics of weapons and equipment are comparable on both
 sides, quantity will spell an important difference between superiority and
 inferiority.  When there is disparity in weapons and equipment, the side with
 numerical superiority cannot be considered to be the superior power; nor can the side
 with superior quality but numerical inferiority be viewed as an inferior power,
 In the era of cold, or nonexplosive, weapons, there was a popular saying:   "One man
 at a strategic point can resist 10,000 invaders."  How could he do that?  The reason
 was that the weapon held by that outnumbered defender at a strategic point and the
 weapons used by the 10,000 invaders, which included axes and long spears, were
 similar in characteristics; as long as he could hold the line at the strategic
 point, he could certainly head off the invaders' attacks.  With the introduction of
 hot, or explosive, weapons, this type of warfare is gone forever.  As modern science
 and technology are applied in the military field and the range and firepower of
 weapons become greater than ever, defenders, especially those with inferior weapons,
 are obviously becoming less and less capable of resisting enemy troops equipped with
 superior arms.

 During the first round of the war in defense of the Soviet Union, the number of
 artillery pieces what the Soviets7 deployed ranged from two to five per kilometer,
 which proved ineffective in holding the line.  During the third round of the war, the
 Soviet Army deployed 25 to 30 and even as many as 87 antitank artillery pieces per
 kilometer, thus putting it in a better position to halt the waves of advancing
 German tanks.  When the battle for Stalingrad began, the ratio of defenders to
 attackers was 1:1.4 in manpower, 1:1 in firepower, 1:2 in tank force, and 1:3.5 in
 air power, thus putting the Soviet army in an unfavorable pc,;;ition.  This battle did
 not end until the armed forces on both sides were even and the Soviet tanks became
 slightly predominant on the battlefield.
 In the series of defensive wars fought by our army, the ratio of defenders to attackers
 also changed from time to time.   During the battle of interception at Tanshan, one
 column (which commanded three divisions) of our army succeeded in repelling attacks
 mounted by 11 Chiang divisions.   This means that on the average one division of our
 army equaled 3.7 Chiang divisions.   During the defensive war of resistance against
 the United States in support of Korea, our army had to commit an average of 1.2 to
 1.6 divisions to confront one enemy division armed with modern weapons, because
 fur army7 was equipped with slightly inferior weapons.  This was a new picture for
 our army, which in its wars of defense historically had resorted to numerical
 superiority to win victory.
 In modern defensive warfare, large-scale tank offensives have replaced attacks
 mounted by foot soldiers--a striking contrast to the war of resistance against the
 United States in support of Korea.  One heavily armored T-72 tank consists of one
 cannon with a caliber of 85 millimeters, one machinegun for antiaircraft defense,
 one heavy machinegun, and three carbines.   It can move at a speed of 200 to 300
 meters per minute.   Resistance against such a tank, or a tank platoon or a tank
 company, has nothing in common with resistance against a foot soldier, or an
 infantry platoon or company of the past.   Any stubborn advocation of pitting one
 against three or even more, in disregard of objective reality, is obviously unrealistic.
 We must work out a new strategy for an inferior power to defeat a superior power by
 taking into account this changing situation.   In figuring out the balance of forces
 between our antitank bazookas and the enemy tanks to be targeted, we cannot just
 count numbers and disregard quality.   Even if we can commit two antitank bazookas
 (excluding antitank guided missiles) to fight one enemy tank, this does not mean
 that the enemy forces have been outnumbered by 2 to 1 in our favor, because we will
 still be inferior to the enemy in terms of quality.  When one of our infantry
 divisions is committed to defend the frontline, it should be deployed in such a way
 that its defensive formation will not be any longer than the enemy tank offensive
 formation.   To counter wave upon wave of advancing enemy tanks, attention must be
 paid to increasing the intensity of antitank bazookas and to strengthening the
 defense network on the frontline.   Special arms must be reinforced with the
 necessary aviation and artillery units and armored and engineer corps so that they
 can achieve what should be achieved for defense purposes.
 A major tactic in combat during the early stages of war is to firmly hold the
 defense line.   In order to stop the enemy troops from breaking through the vital
 defense line, the tactic of pitting one against one is certainly a reliable
 measure for an inferior power to resist a superior power.   But the tactic of pitting

 one against one is by no means absolute.   For example, the tactic of pitting one
 against two or three, or even against four and five, may be effective in countering
 enemy attacks at strategic geographic points where the enemy troops cannot easily
 be deployed and on the secondary defense front.  It may also be effective when defensive
 measures are taken to support offensive campaigns, when superior forces are being
 concentrated to mount attacks, and when defensive maneuvers are deemed necessary to
 trade space for time.
 In short, the problem of how many enemy attackers one of our-soldiers can repel in
 modern defensive warfare should be studied by taking into account the actual
 situation and by seeking truth from facts.  Right-deviationist conservatism is wrong;
 also harmful to our military operations is an unrealistic assessment of the enemy
 situation from the "leftist" point of view.
 Likewise, in analyzing other problems concerning the application of inferior equip-
 ment to defeat a superior power, the slightest departure from the principle of pro-
 ceeding from reality and seeking truth from facts is harmful.

 role in implementing the guidlines of the Central Committee Work Conference.  While
 urging leading cadres at the army and higher levels to study the documents well and
 to achieve unity in thinking, the party committee and leading organs of the air force
 have called on leading cadres at all other levels to change their workstyle by
 visiting lower level units and helping them to interpret documents, solve problems,
 and thoroughly implement the guidelines of the Central Committee Work Conference.
 Thus far, five standing committee members of the air force party committees have
 visited frontline units, aviation plants, antiaircraft artillery batteries, and
 warehouses, where they have given lectures on the documents and have examined and
 studied the new situation and new problems resulting from the consolidation of units.
 While on an education tour of one selected unit--the Dingjian squadron of a certain
 aviation division--political commissar Zhao of a certain army-level air force unit
 clearly explained to comrades there the vital significance of, the consolidation,
 reminding them that "the rise or fall of a nation is the responsibility of its
 citizens."  Cadres and fighters were deeply moved by this speech.  While explaining
 documents to a certain aviation division, director Jiao of the political department
 of a certain PLA air force unit invited political cadres at division, regiment, flight
 wing, and squadron levels to a forum aimed at strengthening their sense of honor and
 responsibility for carrying out political and ideological work in the course of
 consolidating PLA air force units.  On that basis, he joined this division's political
 cadres at all levels in studying and working out key measures for strengthening
 current political and ideological work.   In this way, the groundwork has been laid
 for political cadres to carry out their work in the future.  A slash in the military
 budget has led to a cut in the availability of aviation gasoline.   This being the
 case, how can we maintain and improve the combat capability of our air force units?
 This is a new problem our air force units now face in the course of their consolidation.
 While on a tour of lower level units, leading cadres not only stressed the need to
 carry out military training in a frugal way but also sincerely joined comrades there
 in pooling their wisdom and in studying and coming up with some good methods and
 good measures for sharpening training skills, both on the ground and in the air.
 While on an investigation and study tour of a certain aviation division, commander
 Yang of the PLA air force unit in Fuzhou proposed four measures for saving aviation
 gasoline and carrying out training.  This division has organized a flight training
 program in accordance with his proposal, and has accomplished training missions
 according to a specific timetable and schedule.  LTex 7  Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in

 EAST SEA FLEET TRAINING--After successfully completing the training of the first
 group of warships, the naval training center of the East China Sea Fleet ceremoniously
 began training the second group of warships on 15 February.  Before the training
 began, this training center adopted a series of positive measures that take into
 account the special features of training and new situation and new problems that
 may arise this year, thus creating the condition for starting the training as sche-
 duled.  First, in order to overcome difficulties in drafting a training program for
 this group of warships, which vary in types and requirements, the center sent leading
 members in charge of training, operations officers, and instructors on a tour of
 these warships long before the training took place.  While on board.these warships,
 they carefully studied the technical, military, and political qualities of. their
 crew members as well as their demands and suggestions, and used these as the basis
 for drafting a training program and working out a training schedule.   Second, in
 the face of a slash in the training budget, the center mobilized its personnel to
 design and produce scores of items of teaching equipment, to compile teaching
 materials in 48 categories, and to produce 25 graphic charts on war games.   In this
 way, it has cut down education expenditures on behalf of the state and has solved
 an urgent need for teaching materials.   Third, in response to a great demand for
 streamlining the teaching staff and improving the quality of teaching, the center
 has reorganized its faculty members.  As a result, six unsuitable instructors have
 been replaced by 14 more experienced and more competent specialists in the operation
 of warships; they were selected and transferred from various PLA units with the
 help of higher authorities.  LText7 (Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 27 Feb 81 p

 REINFORCED INFANTRY BATTALION--Following the training started at the foot of
 the Taihang Mountains by a "combined arms battalion" trial-established by
 a certain army, a "reinforced infantry battalion" set up by a certain army of
 the Chengdu Units officially launched its training at the Tailiang Mountains
 on 17 September.  The commanders and fighters said, Training together this
 way for one day is better than training separately for one month.  In order
 to get experience in coordinated training, this army decided to pick out four
 artillery companies, one signal platoon, one corps of engineer platoon, one
 antichemical warfare squad and one medical squad from the 2d Infantry Battalion
 of a crack army group of a certain unit to form a "reinforced infantry
 battalion" to carry out a scheduled two and one-half months of training.   They
 also applied to the upper level for tanks and aircraft for combined arms
 training, and formed a combined arms command unit which consisted of various
 personnel from infantry, artillery, tank and air force units to direct carrying
 out the combined arms training. [Text] [Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese

 TORPEDO BOATS IN MINE-LAYING--On 11 September, the South China Sea Fleet organized
 torpedo boats to test the launching of mines.  The tests were successful, thus
 providing the experience of laying mines at sea during wartime.  Using fast
 boats to lay mines is an important combat means to seal off sea lanes during
 wartime.  In the past, each boat used in mine laying operations could carry only
 two mines which were rolled into the water from a rack on the rear deck.  Is
 it possible to load mines in the boats' torpedo tubes?  In order to get first-.
 hand experience, the South China Sea Fleet organized a certain unit to begin
 conducting tests on 27 August.  With the boats drifting and moving, they
 successfully laid the mines from the torpedo tubes four times in succession.
 In this way, the capability of using fast boats for mine-laying operations
 doubled. [Text] [Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 21 Sep 79 p 1]
