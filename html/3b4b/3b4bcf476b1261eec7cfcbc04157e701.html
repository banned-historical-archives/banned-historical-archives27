 THE, S INO-V IETIgAIvIE3Ij EFFORT TO LIMIT
 AMERICAN ACTIONS IN THE VIETNAM WAR
 Summary
 When the Viet Conk; was.. re-activated in 1958-59,
 neither Peiping nor Hanoi seemed to estimate that the
 American commitment to Saigon would develop to the point
 at which territory in the North would be subjected to
 :...r strike. s.   In their discussion o:  the war in 190--
 02,  they emphasized that the American effort in the South
 wu~~ "special warfare," i . e . , of a very limited character.
 As American military support of south Vietnam increased,
 the Chinese became increasingly concerned, and by 1964
 they underscored a ;ino-Vietnamese community of interest
 in trying to deter Washington from making air strikes
 against the North.   However, they were at pains to ensure
 that Washington would not calculate that PLA forces were
 poised to enter Vietnam or Laos (and,  therefore, would
 not feel impelled to strike by air at the China mainland).
 The U. S. air stril;es on North Vietnam in August 1964 almost
 certainly took the Chinese and Vietnamese leaders by sur-
 prise.  By February-March 1965, their failure to prevent
 strikes against the North forced them to recognize that
 Mao was wrong in thinking that small wars could be fought
 w~tli only slight risks to the base areas and to the
 security -of-or -bloc countries .
 Once the concept of sanctuary for the North had been
 invalidated, the Chinese were apparently stimulated to
 add a new dimension to their encouragement of Hanoi.   That
 is,  in addition to encouraging the North Vietnamese to
 move the fighting in the South from primarily guerrilla
 warfare (with occasional big battles of annihilation)
 to primarily conventional warfare (with many big battles
 of annihilation), the Chinese apparently began urging the
 North Vietnamese to infiltrate PAVN forces into the
 South on a larger scale.   Hanoi, evidently reluctant to
 comply to the extent advocated by Peiping in early 1965,
 may now be somewhat more willing to do so,  in the sense
 of being willing to infiltrate a few more PAVN units.
 However, the Chinese seem to be sustaining their pressure
 for large-scale infiltration or even direct attacks across

 the 17th parallel.   The Chinese almost certainly would
 increase their pressure on Hanoi if American air strikes
 were to hit targets north of the 20th parallel and were
 to include more economic installations.
 Considerably increased awareness of the threat to
 the China mainland apparently has impelled the Chinese
 leaders to state publicly the conditions under which
 they would use the PLA to intervene.   There seem to be
 two conditions  or clef in ite intervention.   PLA ground
 forces will ontor the fighting if (a) the United states
 moves large forces of its own ground troops across the
 17th parallel and (b) the North Vietnamese prove unable
 to handle the matter and request Chinese assistance.
 Were  the United States to strike by air at bases in China
 but not move its troops on the ground into the North, PLA
 ground forces might be committed to Vietnam.   This last
 part of the Chinese position contains a large element of
 ambiguity, particularly on the matter of what constitutes
 an American "attack'' against the mainland.   The Chinese
 have declared "If we are attacked, we will certainly
 counterattack," but they have been equivocal on the mat-
 ter of whether air strikes against the mainland would
 spur them to counterattack with the PLA on the ground,
 or whether air strikes against the mainland would meet
 merely with a counter air strike (or air defense action).
 The Chinese certainly prefer to prevent such Ameri-
 can air strikes against the1 baases.   Their options, how-
 ever, are limited because of their (Mao's) pugnacity and
 refusal to concede that the small war will not work in
 Vietnam.  They seem to believe that it will still work--
 that is, that, accepting a larger risk to the North Viet-
 namese base area and to China than originally foreseen,
 Communist forces can still pursue the war effectively in
 South Vietnam, probably without provoking the U.S. into
 (a) moving its ground forces into North Vietnam on a large
 scale,   or  (b) making air attacks on China.   Therefore,
 the Chinese will not desist from encouraging Hanoi and
 the Viet Cong from continuing the war.  They seem to be
 willing to risk,  if necessary, even the destruction of
 their bases i South China to sustain the war.

 THE SINO-VIETNAMESE EFFORT TO LIMIT
 AMERICAN ACTICNS IN THE VIETNAM WAR
 Introduction
 As early as 1958, at the time of the Taiwan Strait
 crisis, the Chinese leaders were apparently aware that
 the Soviet nuclear umbrella was credible only for the
 defense of the USSR, not for a Chinese or North Vietnamese
 military effort.  By 1960,  intensification of the Sino-
 Soviet dispute made this awareness even clearer.   Never-
 theless, the Chinese and North Vietnamese leaders prob-
 ably viewed the removal of the Soviet nuclear umbrella
 --in an earlier period a credible restraint on American
 military action in the Far East--as a development which
 would not, and should not, prevent the guerrilla war in
 the South from moving ahead.   They seemed to agree that
 some other deterrent to American action against North
 Vietnam could be found, and their view centered on PAVN
 and PLA forces as constituting an adequate (or credible)
 deterrent.
 The Chinese leaders have hinted at the conditions
 in which they would feel impelled to commit PLA forces
 to fight in Vietnam.  This paper examines the record of
 Chinese hints and direct statements on this matter in
 the context of Peiping's and Hanoi's effort to deter the
 United States from (a) increasing advisory and material
 military aid to Saigon,  (b) striking by air at the North,
 and (c) striking even at China.
 Ambiguity in a statement of deterrence sustains
 political maneuverability, but reduces credibility.   A
 deterrent statement can be both ambiguous and strong
 only when military dispositions indicate a real threat.
 That is, the degree of seriousness of the threat cannot
 be measured by the content of verbal warnings alone.

 Nevertheless, verbal warnings can provide indicators
 of intentions even without hard information on military
 dispositions.   In our view, a deterrent statement acquires
 strength from the degree of precision used in (a) commit-
 ting a country to take direct military actions and (b)
 closing off avenues of retreat after the specific public
 commitment is made.   Adjectives do not make a deterrent
 statement strong or weak, nor do analogies with earlier
 clashes.
 In the following analysi:.i,  all o.C the underlining
 of words and passages has been supplied.
 1.  To Deter the United States from Increasing
 WIT-11-Try Aid
 In 1960 and 1961, the Chinese leaders avoided making
 any public statements indicating direct PLA support for
 the future defense of the North, but hinted, imprecisely,
 at Peiping's concern in the matter.   Typical of the locu-
 tions they used were those contained in Chou En-lai's
 remarks to the North Vietnamese delegation in Peiping:
 the Chinese government and people "cannot be indifferent"
 to the grave situation created by American actions in the
 South,  and the Chinese and Vietnamese governments have
 always been "in close cooperation and supported each
 other" in building socialism and opposing the United States,
 (statements made on 12 June 1961).  Later, in alluding
 publicly to American "plans to send troops" to the South,
 Peiping did not go beyond committing "the heroic people
 of South Vietnam" to react to this new challenge (broad-
 cast of 12 October 1961).1

 Even when the Chinese leaders implied the possible
 use of the PL/1 in a joint military effort with Hanoi,
 it was to be a joint action to defend "separat-e"  (ko-tzu)
 countries.   That is,  it was vague on the matter of PLA
 use in Vietnam:   the Chinese people and "the PLA...will
 makejoin  efforts with  ou to defend the security of
 our separate countries"                                              25X1
 And when this unprecedented
 (and not repeated) statement of joint defense and other
 efforts proved to be inadequate to prevent the establish-
 ment of the American military command in the South (in
 February 1962), tl:.e Chinese avoided references to any
 PLA involvement in defense of the North.   They were not
 explicit on their course of action when they warned that
 the American military command posed "a serious threat to
 the security of the DRV and China" and that Washington
 intended to move first against the North and "from there
 against China" (People's Daily editorial of 25 February).*
 2.  To Deter the United States from Air Strikes

 Peiping and Hanoi probably estimated in 1962 and
 1963 that the establishment of the American military
 command would not l~4ad to American air attacks on the
 In        is editorial, the Chinese repeated what they had
 said in their government statement of 24 February for the
 first time--e.g., American action in the South "seriously
 affects the security of China."  The North Vietnamese had
 established the line earlier and for the first time in
 their government statement of 18 February that American
 action was "a direct threat to the security of the ARV."
 The Chinese government statement ducked the matter of PLA
 involvement and made a careful distinction between the
 "direct" threat to the DRV and the "indirect" threat to
 China.

 North.*  They seemed to believe that the United States
 would restrict its military assistance to support below
 the 17th parallel and were probably confirmed in this
 view by Washington's references to the limited nature
 of its action and the need to fight guerrilla wars with
 (a) "special warfare" rather than with the more exten-
 sive (b) "local" warfare or even (c) nuclear warfare.**
 However, by early 1964, the Chinese and North Viet-
 namese leaders displayed rezl concern about the prospects
 of American air strikes.   In February, NCNA carried Ameri-
 can press references to discussions in Washington of air
 attacks which might be directed against the North, and
 Hanoi stepped up its deterrent statements.   Defense Minister
 Giap called for the improvement of "combat cohesion of
 the armed forces of socialist countries" (Soviet Red Star
 article of 23 February 1964), and the North Vietnamese
 army paper warned the United States--which "is planning"
 to increase "provocations" against the North--that the
 **These terms are not precise but seem consistently in
 Chinese usage to indicate an ascending order.  They refer,
 in order, to a small operation like the U.S. effort in
 South Vietnam, a larger one such as the Korean war, and
 a world  var.   The Russians have a comparable usage.  The
 People's Daily editorial of 25 February 1962 mentioned
 all th e__fypes in connection with American strategic
 military thought and stressed Washington's use of (a)   in
 Vietnam.  Other-Chinese and North Vietnamese articles
 discussed (a) as the prevailing type of American-supported

 leader--Lo Jui-ching--state explicit?y that'.the U.S. was
 moving in the direction of the more extensive "local" war.).

 PAVN is stronger than ever and "together with the strength
 of the peoples and armed forces of the friendly countries
 in the socialist camp--which support us closely--our
 strength is second to none" (Quan Doi Nhan Dan article
 of 3 March).   (The 3 March art icle sarong y suggested
 that only "friendly" China, rather than the USSR, was
 willing to support the DRV "closely.")  Hanoi's concern
 was also reflected in private contacts; for the first
 time, diplomatic channels were used to warn Washington.
 in mid-February 1964 that if the United States
 were to introduce more forces and equipment into the
 South, the Communist side could easily match such increases.
 He went on to say that Hanoi was prepared to deal with
 the possibility that Washington might carry the war to
 the North (apparently a reference to air strikes).   Also
 in mid-February, the North Vietnamese increased military
 and civilian defense preparations against anticipated
 Ame:.,ican air attacks.
 At the same time, the Chinese were careful to avoid
 identifying Peiping in any direct military sense with
 Hanoi's defense effort.   For example, when Hanoi discussed
 a hypothetical "invasion" of the North by American ground
 forces and then referred to the consequence---viz., that
 the United States "would have to cope not only with North
 Vietnam, but also with China"  (Hoc Tap article of January
 1964)--the Chinese omitted this tey passage 3.n their re-
 print.  Reflecting Chinese uncertainty of the extent of
 prospective American action, Peiping's statement of deter-
 rence in early March was so cautious as to be tantamount
 to a mere repetition of I:fanoi's mild warning that "any
 infringement on the DRV" would be the "responsibility"
 of the United States (People's Daily editorial of 4 March).
 While the Chinese were s     on specific commitments
 regarding PLA action, they were long on encouragement.
 A Chinese "peace" statement of early March declared that
 "American clamors to extend the war to the North can only
 frighten those who have lost their nerve," i.e., the Rus-
 sian 'Leaders.
 Hanoi's concern about prospective American air strikes
 on the North continued through the spring of 1964.   On 9

 May, General Giap,  in an interview with the Communist
 newsman W. Burchett, the content of which was intended
 for Western leaders,  reflected some anxiety on the part
 of the leadership when he warned that "any act of aggres-
 sion against the DRV by the United States.. .would be
 suicide."  Under Chinese and North Vietnamese criticism
 at a press conference in Hanoi,  Soviet Ambassador
 Tovmasyan revealed on 15 May that:   "A cadre of the DRV's
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs told me that the Vietnamese
 people do not see the danger of a direct attack by the
 United States."   (Tovmasyan's apparent point was that if
 the real North Vietnamese estimate minimized the prospect
 of an air strike, why should Vietnamese newsmen demand
 to know if there would be a strong reaction on the part
 of the socialist camp (i.e., the USSR) were the North
 to be attacked?)  By mid-May, when the United States
 significantly increased its air-strike capability in the
 South, the North Vietnamese prepared to absorb bombing
 attacks.  At the time, Hanoi's first major statement
 indicated awareness that "the Skyraiders introduced into
 the South are likely to be used in provocations against
 North Vietnam" and suggested the limited nature of the
 Communists' retaliatory capability by threatening the
 Americans only with the punishment "of history" (Nhan Dan
 editorial of 21 May).  Widespread construction of infantry-
 type defense ditches in the central part of Hanoi was
 noted by a visitor to the city in early May, suggesting
 that the Vietnamese were preparing to absorb air strikes
 even against their capital.  Hanoi's second major state-
 ment at the time  (issued by the DRV Foreign Ministry on
 4 June) indicated that countermoves would include primarily
 a steli-up of Viet Cong operations.
 The Chinese did not in any way associate themselves
 publicly with the defense of the North.  They spoke only
 of "friendship" of the PLA and the PAVN and referred
 vaguely to PLA "support for the Vietnamese people's
 struggle for reunification" (Lt. General Liu Chih-chien
 in his speech of 8 June).   They apparently were not
 clear about Washington's intentions.   Air strikes in
 Laos (against Khang Khay) increased their anxiety, which
 was partly reflected by Chou En-lai's reference to the
 "dangerous situation in Indochina" and his urgent appeal

 for the "speedy calling" of a Geneva conference on Laos
 (speech of 11 June).   The meeting of American officials
 in Honolulu in June and the air strikes in Laos may well
 have led the Chinese leaders to conclude that Washington,
 by "entering upon a new phase of direct and open" support
 of anti-Communist forces in Laos (People's Daily editorial
 of 15 June), was hinting at an intention to strike next
 at North Vietnam if Pathet Lao and Viet Cong operations
 did not cease.  They kept their deterrent statements im-
 precise as they met in mid-June in a "work conference of
 the CCP Central Committee":   if Washington wants its
 "own way, it will find itself woefully unwise in its
 choice" (Ta Kung Pao editorial of 15 June) and "we want
 to solemnly warn American imperialism to stop playing
 with fire at once or it will burn itself"  (Ta Kung Pao
 editorial of 18 June).                       -
 The Chinese leaders' effort to deter the United
 States at the time included (a) a revision of Chou En-
 lai's appeal for a conference, which was elaborated by
 Chen Yi to be a conference to seek "first of all" a
 settlement on Laos and (b) warnings that the appeal was
 not "a sign of weakness" and that China "absolutely will
 not sit idly by" while the Geneva accords are torn up
 and "`.he flames of war are spread to its side" (speech
 of 24 June).   Chen was careful to sustain Peiping's
 ambiguity on what it would do to protect North Vietnam
 from prospective air strikes and what it would do if
 American marines were sent to Laos _r
 While attempting by this maneuver to impede further
 American commitments to Vientiane and Saigon, they appar-
 ently decided--probably during their "work conference"
 in June--to further encourage Hanoi and the Viet Cong.
 They declared that Peiping's support for the Communist
 effort in Laos and Vietnam "will remain unshakable"

 (Kuang-ming Daily article of 20 June).  That they con-
 tinued to view any Soviet statement of deterrence as
 not essential (and,  in the context of the Sino-Soviet
 dispute, as not desirable) was suggested by an article
 the Hong Kong Communist newspaper, Wen Wei Pao, on
 23 June.   Referring to an article in P ravda on 2T June,
 which had warned that the USSR would not necessarily
 support China in the event. of an enlarged war, the news-
 paper declared that this warning would only stimulate
 the Chinese to support the struggle in Laos and Vietnam
 in "a more resolute way."  Khrushchev may have attempted,
 during the "work conference" discussions among the Chinese
 leaders, to deter Peiping from further encouraging Hanoi,
 implicitly warning the Chinese that they would have no
 Soviet military or political support in the event of any
 escalation of the war.  This was a costly tactical blunder,
 as it provided the Chinese with a means to "prove" to the
 North Vietnamese leaders that Khrushchev was a traitor
 on the matter of support for the revolutionary struggle
 of a fraternal country,*
 Regarding any expectation by Hanoi of support from
 Peiping in terms of commitment of PLA troops to the North,
 such a commitment was not anticipated and was not con-
 sidered necessary.  North Vietnamese statements reflected
 this situation of non-commitment.  For example, Hanoi's
 first major statement at the time of probable Peiping-
 Hanoi consultations in late June warned vaguely that if
 the Americans "directly encroach on the security of the         25X1
 DRV, " they will "encounter a proper rebuff," but it did
 not state who would administer the rebuff or how it w
 be carried out

 deterrence in June contained a sharp distinction--appar-
 ently worked out by the Chinese and Vietnamese--between
 who would fight and who would merely support the fight:
 ...should they rashly venture to attack
 the North, they would certainly sustain
 a shameful defeat.  And this is because
 our whole people will resolutely fight
 back, because the socialist countries
 and progressive peoples the world over
 will unreservedly support us, because
 the American people an   heir allies too
 will oppose them (Pham Van Dong's Report
 to the DRV National Assembly of 27 June).
 This distinction was made clearer in Nhan Dan on the same
 day (27 June) that the premier gave hsreport.  The
 party newspaper cited a statement made months earlier
 by General Giap at the special political conference in
 Hanoi on 28 March 1964:  "The PAVN and the people's armed
 forces stand ready to deal telling blows at the enemy if
 they recklessly encroach upon the territory, airspace,
 and t^rritorial waters of the DRV."  The newspaper went
 on to discuss the determination of the "Vietnamese" to
 hit back at American "encroachments" and did not refer
 to the Chinese.   When the Chinese leaders made their
 deterrent statement, it was stronger than any Peiping
 had made previously but was still ambiguous on the matter
 of PLA intervention:
 China and the DRV are fraternal neighbors
 closely related like the lips and teeth.
 The Chinese people cannot be expected to
 look on with folded arms in the face of
 any aggression /-.e. of any degree or

 purposes.  The word,  "any," was repeated when the People's
 Daily editorial of 9 July reprinted Chen's remarks   but
 a er in July the Chinese leaders apparently perceived
 that the word was dangerously inclusive, committing them
 to some form of action whether an American attack was
 launched on the ground or in the air.  Thus they dropped
 the word, "any,"Tye end of July
 By late July, the Chinese were acting somewhat bolder
 than they had in early June--that is, bolder than during
 the days immediately following the Honolulu conference
 of American officials.   For the first time, they issued
 a government statement which hinted at the use of the
 Despite the fact that the United States
 has introduced tens of thousands of its
 military personnel into southern Vietnam
 and Laos, China has not sent a single
 soldier to Indochina.   However, there is
 a limit to everything.   (Government State-
 ment of 19 July)**
 '' e editorial of    July made the strongest statement
 of deterrence up to that time:  "Should American ::.mperi-
 alism attack the DRV, thereby posing a threat to China's
 peace and security, the Chinese people naturally cannot
 be expected to look on with folded arms."  Nevertheless,
 it did not say what the Chinese would do when they un-
 folded their arms.
 **The deterrent aspect of the Chinese government state-
 ment of 19 July was suggested by the People's Daily edi-
 torial of the 20th, which warned Washington to no a the
 new threat and that "we mean what we s?ay."  They also
 pointed to the new threat as "showing that China has made
 up its mind, formulated its counter measures, as well as
 looked into every possible future development."   (Hong
 Kong Wen Wei Pao commentator article of 20 July)   This
 reference to contingency planning probably refers to the
 mid-June "work conference" of the Chinese leadership and
 further suggests that the decision to sustain and increase
 support of Hanoi and the Viet Cong was affirmed at the
 conference.

 At the same time, they took care to indicate to Washing-
 ton that only an attack on North Vietnam (apparently a
 ground attack was meant)--and not action in South Vietnam--
 would impel Peiping to commit the PLA in Vietnam:
 We do not want to wage a war in southeast
 Asia.  This is absolutely clear to the
 State Department in Washington.   This posi-
 tion of ours is very accurately known in
 the State Department.   They know that we
 do not want to wage war.  We would feel
 threatened only if, perhaps, the United
 States would send their "special warfare"
 toward the North,  if they attack North
 Vietnam.  That is,  if the other side were
 to attack.  This would directly endanger
 the stability of our border and of the
 neighboring Chinese provinces.  In such
 a-case, we would intervenes...
 Yet, being encircled by aggressive people
 on the other side, we have to naintain
 this army.   It would intervene if the war
 in Indochina should be carried to the
 North....If they want a small war, then
 a small war it will. be.   If they want a
 big war, then it will be a big war.   It
 all depends on the Americans.   (Chen Yi
 interview in late July with Austrian
 newsman)
 This was the first time that a Chinese leader had publicly
 discussed the specific conditions which would impel the
 PLA to "intervene."  Peiping probably believed, at that
 time, that the United States would not strike at the
 North either on the ground or in the air.   An indication
 of such a belief, as of late July, appeared in the broad-
 cast of a Peiping radio commentator on 27 July:   he told
 listeners in Japan that "China considers" American threats
 to invade the DRV as merely intended to scare China, in-
 asmuch as the United States "would not be able" to invade.
 The Soviet leaders also may have believed in mid-July that
 American attacks on the North were improbable; at the

 time, Soviet officials reportedly downplayed the risks
 of escalation on the grounds that President Johnson would
 not let the fighting expand into a local war.
 When,  in early August, American planes hit North
 Vietnamese targets following the incident in the Gulf
 of Tonkin, the Chinese seem to have been taken by sur-
 prise.                             After a 24-hour delay, the Chinese issued their
 government statement in which they threatened to help
 but avoided saying that the PLA now had the right to
 intervene. The statement felT-back upon the distinction
 made by Premier Pham Van Dong on 27 June:
 In the surprise attack on the DRV...United
 States imperialism went over the  'brink
 of war' and made the first step in extending
 the war in Indochina.... Since the United
 States has taken this action, the DRV has
 gained the right of action to f ighV against
 aggression, and all the countries upholding
 the Geneva agreements have gained the right
 of action to assist the DRV in its fight
 against aggression .. no socialist country
 can sit idly by without lending a helping
 hand....
 Aggression by the United States against
 the DRV means aggression against China.
 The Chinese people will absolutely not
 sit idly by without lending a helping
 hand.   The American government must stop
 immediately its armed provocations against
 the DRV and its armed encroachments on the
 latter's sacred territory, airspace, and
 territorial waters.   (CPR Government State-
 ment of 6 August)
 Thus Pham Van Dong's distinction between those who would
 "fight" and those who would merely "assist" was clearly
 and deliberately stressed in the statement and the Chinese
 made no threat to intervene, demanding only that the United
 States stop bombing (after, in fact,  it had stopped).

 Following the second incident in the Gulf of Tonkin

 After the crisis of September subsided, the Chinese deter-
 rent statements remained vague, particularly on the matter
 of a new possible development which the Chinese seemed
 to see as probable--viz., gradual and phased escalation.

 behavior following the August 1964 American air strikes,
 a North Vietnamese official told                in early          25X1
 November that "When the Americans attacked the DRV, the
 Soviets did nothing and the Chinese only talked."*   In
 a published interview in December, Ho Chi Minh suggested
 that North Vietnam would have to fight alone in the
 event of escalation.  He was careT-u-1-To say that if the
 war were expanded to the North, "the CPR will support
 us and the socialist countries will support us   (reported
 by Vietnam News Agency on 23 December).   At the same
 time, the Chinese continued to make their usual distinc-
 tion between supporting North Vietnam and fighting with
 it.  Peiping declared that if South Korean troops were
 sent to South Vietnam, this would provide all Geneva
 accords countries the full right "to support" the South
 Vietnamese (People's Daily editorial of 14 January 1965).
 Mao Tse-tung himself spoke even more cautiously of the
 conditions which would compel the Chinese to engage in
 military operations in Vietnam.  He told Edgar Snow on
 9 January that "Only if the United States attacked China
 would the Chinese fight....The Vietnamese can cope with
 their own situation."
 Hanoi put limits on its own reaction.  The North
 Vietnamese reaction to the air strikes of 7 and 8 Febru-
 ary 1965 was marked by an apparent anxiety to dispel the
 notion in the North and elsewhere that Hanoi was obliged
 to hit back with the full force of the PAVN across the
 17th parallel.  The DRV government statement of 8 February

 declared that the enemy had been "appropriately punished,"
 and it made no mention of the need to retaliate in reprisal
 for damage inflicted by the strikes on the North.   The
 7 February appeal of the Liberation Front presidium for
 forces in the South to "strike strongly, really strongly,
 and really lastingly, in order to protect the North and
 to liberate the South" suggested that Hanoi's policy was
 to react by retaliating on a large scale with its mili-
 tary assets in the South rather than preparing for a major
 PAVN offensive.  Hanoi depicted the air strikes as part
 of an established pattern rather than making a new pat-
 tern.  By implication, therefore, no major new counter-
 action directly from the North was required.   "Well-
 deserved" retaliation from the North took the form of
 bringing down American strike aircraft (Nhan Dan editorial
 of 13 February).  Hanoi declared only tha__ he "South
 Vietnamese people have the right to strike back."   (PAVN
 regional military commander to NCNA on 11 February)
 Peiping, however, seems to have been anxious to go
 beyond the question of the right of the Viet Cong to that
 of the DRV itself--i.e., to that of the use of the PAWN.
 .the DRV has secured the right to take
 the initiative in dealing counterblows to

 This new language suggests that in February 1965 the

 the number of regular PAVN units in the South, apparently
 by a large-scale attack across the 17th parallel.  Hanoi's

 DRV government statement of 14 February did not mention
 any DRV right to take such action.  By contrast, the
 People's Daily and Ta Kung Pao editorials of 14 February
 repeated die theme, as-did the People's Daily editorial
 published on the 19th. The Chinese posits   was prob-
 ably intended also to keep the burden of retaliation on
 the North Vietnamese--that is, on Hanoi's side of the
 Sino-Vietnamese border; at the same time, the Chinese
 tried to avoid the appearance of an inactive partner and
 stated--to the United States--that "We are waiting for
 you in battle array"  (People's Daily editorial of 9
 February).   This statem-e        not quite focus on the
 situation at the time, as the United States was strik-
 ing North Vietnam, :?,ot China; and was doing so in the
 air, not on the ground.
 The Chinese leaders tried to dispel the impression
 in various countries that Peiping feared the consequences
 of a direct military confrontation with United States forces.
 They and their followers tried to justify their inability
 to deter air strikes against the North and their unwill-
 ingness to act militarily.  One line taken was that Pei-
 ping refused to be lured into fighting  at a disadvantage.
 An editorial in the Cambodian paper, La Depeche (a daily
 which strongly supports Chinese positrons), replying on
 9 February to "those who say that the Chinese are con-
 tented with giving only verbal support," argued that
 Peiping "must not commit itself," but must prepare for
 a confrontation "under the best of all possible condi-
 tions."  The Chinese leaders themselves revived the
 formulation of 6 August 1964 that Geneva signatories had
 gained the right to "assist" the DRY and again resorted
 to meticulous ambiguity:   "as to how this right will be
 exercised, it is our own affair" (CPR government state-
 ment of 9 February).   They avoided the question of what
 the PLA would be ordered to do in response to the early
 February strikes:   "If American imperialism is bent on
 spreading the war flames and imposing war on us, then we
 shall have no alternative but to go along with it to the
 very end.   In that event, the whole of southeast Asia,
 the whole of Asia, would be aflame with the revolution-

 of 10 February).  This statement was vague precisely at
 points where precision was easy to employ.  That is, it
 referred to "imposing war on us" and then failed to make
 clear whether "us" referred to China only or to China
 and North Vietnam together. At the same time,  it dodged
 the real issue:  a commitment to act militarily to counter
 air strikes against the North.   Further, to state that
 "an invasion of the DRV is an invasion of the CPR" and
 then to make the entire matter conditional--e.g.,  "If you
 insist on imposing war on us, heavy rebuffs are in store
 for you" (People's Daily editorial of 9 February)--was
 to make no commit a    to      use the PLA in defense of the
 North against air strikes.  Peiping seemed to be saying
 something else:  that an American ground attack against
 the North,  if large enough to threaten the PAVN with
 defeat (as the North Koreans had been threatened in
 autumn 1950), would lead the PLA to intervene.   (It was
 not necessarily saying that the PLA would intervene in
 Vietnam if the U.S. 'were to make air strikes on China.)
 U.S.. ground attack on the North was hardly a real
 possibility; it was a hypothetical situation regarding
 which Chinese statements could be made to sound bold.
 "You will become utterly helpless when people resisting
 aggression,  instead of being afraid of you, dare to fight,
 defy difficulties, and advance wave on wave.   You have
 been taught a lesson on this score in the Korean War.
 Do you want to have the lesson repeated in Indochina?"
 (CPR government statement of 13 February)
 In short, the Chinese commitment--or hedged promise--
 was most nearly explicit on the development least likely
 to occur--a major American ground attack against the North
 (or China).   Regarding the real military situation in
 February, the Chinese in effect conceded that the air
 strike strategy against the North could not be halted by
 their prolonged verbal deterrent effort.  They also im-
 plicitly conceded that the strikes were a significant
 American initiative which deprived the North Vietnamese
 of sanctuary.  Reflecting a considerable degree of sen-
 sitivity to their inability and unwillingness to try to
 stop the air strikes, the Chinese declared:   "How far
 will you go?  That's your own lookout.  But you are
 grossly mistaken to think that the war can be made to

 pointed to the "airdromes on the sea" and asked "What can
 they do since the outcome of the war has to be decided
 on terra firma?"   (People:'s Daily editorial of 13 Febru-
 ary).  That is, theese were compelled to fall back
 to the position that the PAVN would not permit the "out-
 come" of the war to be defeat on the ground for Hanoi;
 but this did not alter the fact that the North was bean
 sub'ected to bombing.
 The Chinese leaders' reaction to the air strikes
 of 2 March seemed intended partly to encourage again
 the North Vietnamese to send more PAVN units to the
 South and partly to deter further attacks.  Regarding
 encouragement of Hanoi, Peiping stressed explicitly the
 line that the United States had again "stepped over the
 boundary" of the 17th parallel and spoke of retaliation
 in terms of a strike back, apparently from the North
 (People's Daily editorial of 3 March).  The North Viet-
 namese, However, stressed the theme that the DRV anti-
 aircraft artillery had given the Americans an "appro-
 priate answer" and that the?Viet Cong, too, had "answered"
 and would answer them with more military victories in
 the South    (Nhan Dan editorial of 5 March). Although
 their 3 and 5-0rc1T ditorials mentioned "punishing" the
 Americans, they did not do so in the context of widening
 the conflict.  Yet this is precisely the context in which
 the Chinese discussed striking back, downplaying Hanoi's
 theme of punishment by anti-aircraft artillery in the
 North:
 Having flagrantly resorted to the war move
 of bombing the DRV again and again, the
 Johnson administration said in its state-
 ment that the United States 'wishes to
 avoid widening the conflict.'  What does

 United States is free to bomb any place
 at will while others should never strike
 back; otherwise, they wou   be  wi ening

 gangsters'  logic!   'It is discourteous
 not to give after receiving,' a Chinese
 saying goes.   Since American imperialism
 has forced the war upon others, it cannot
 expect to escape the punishment it
 deserves.   (People's Daily editorial of
 3 March)
 This line of argument, which gratuitously provided the
 North Vietnamese leaders with a basis for PAVN retalia-
 tion, seemed to be intended to urge Hanoi to act on a
 larger scale as well as to accelerate the overall Viet
 Cong effort.  That the Chinese were urging a course of
 large-scale PAVN entry into the fighting was further
 suggested by the line of argument carried earlier in a
 Red Flag article dealing with the war in Vietnam:
 The American imperialists have extended
 the war to the DRV.   The DRV, therefore,
 is fully allowed to use every possible
 means to deal telling blows to them and
 their lackeys.   (Red Flag "Commentator"
 article of 27 FebruarJ
 This article was not intended merely as justification of
 the war to neutral and other non-Communist leaders.   It
 was broadcast in Vietnamese, and only in Vietnamese, to
 Vietnam six times on 2 March, strongly suggesting the'
 Chinese leaders'  intention to impel Hanoi--"the DRV is
 fully allowed"--to make a significantly greater military
 commitment and to accelerate the effort in the South.
 At the same time, the Chinese offered support for
 such an accelerated effort.  Politburo member Peng Chen
 declared that the Chinese people "have made every prepara-
 tion and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in
 launching counterattacks for self-defense in various ways
 against the American aggressors" (speech of 5 March).

 The Chinese also insisted that the North Vietnamese
 should by no  means maneuver for negotiations as a means
 of gaining a suspension of air attacks.   Particularly
 in the wake of Kosygin's visit to Hanoi, the Chinese
 declared--in the context of possible "peace talks"--that
 'We shall never succumb to the American imperialists'
 blackmail.  No socialist country should"   (People's Daily
 editorial of 1 March) ; that the United States is try nag`
 "to gain at the negotiating table what it is unable to
 gain on the battlefield" (Red Flag article of 27 February,
 broadcast in Vietnamese to VTe  and   on 2 March); and that
 "Vietnam will not agree, nor will all countries which
 truly uphold the Geneva agreements" (CPR government state-
 ment of 2 March).  By contrast, Hanoi was more equivocal
 on the matter of negotiations in early March, did not
 directly attack the idea, and deleted the phrase, "Viet-
 nam will not agree," from the Vietnam News Agency account
 of Peiping's statement.
 these statements contained
 elements of amb:sguity.   For example, an "important" Chi-
 nese official told a Japanese correspondent in Peiping
 on 2 March that
 I do not think the United States will be
 able to carry out bombings on a larger
 scale, but if it should take a chance,
 China would strike the United States with
 real action.   (Tokyo Nihon Keizai, 3 March)

 3.  To Deter the United States from Air Strikes
 Against     na
 Following the early February air strikes, the Chi-
 nese leaders apparently became more aware of a real
 danger of strikes against their own bases than they had
 been since August 1964.  Cutting directly across the
 bold talk of preparation to take "real action" was the
 not ro bold move to disarm a pre-emptive American air
 strike on bases in south China by privately indicating
 (to Washington through a third party) that PLA ground
 forces were not massed on the southern border.   Immedi-
 ately followfrig the air strikes of 7-11 February on the
 North, Peiping's Foreign Ministry arranged a visit to
 the Sino-Vietnamese border area by the China-based cor-
 respondent of AFP; he was told by a Chinese official in
 Kunming that the visit was intended to demonstrate that
 Peiping was not preparing for direct intervention.   Ap-
 parently as intended, the correspondent reported to Am-
 ericar, officials that he saw no military activity in the
 area.  Although insisting publicly on 12 March that
 American threats ("no sanctuary" and "hot pursuit") to
 bomb China could not frighten Peiping, the Chinese lead-
 ers in effect admitted their inability to prevent the
 bombings of North Vietnam from extending throughout the
 DRV and eventually to south China.  They implicitly con-
 ceded that the United States had unlimited capability
 to bomb, but downplayed the military significance of
 bombing:
 Anyhow, you have only so much armed strength
 at your disposal, and for all your clamoring,
 the means you can resort to are /only7:that
 many.

 You may act in your way and we will act
 in our way.   (CPR government statement
 of 12 March)*
 The Chinese leaders were also impelled to downplay the
 military significance of the landing of American marines
 at Da Nang.  By arguing in their statement of 12 March
 that the marines' presence would "educate" the South
 Vietnamese by "negative example" and that "no village,
 town, forest or road in the whole of southern Vietnam
 is safe," the Chinese introduced another line of justi-
 fication for limiting their response to support, falling
 short of use of the PLA in Vietnam.  The apparent logic
 was:   if American force-increases do not basically
 change Viet Cong capabilities and prospects, Chinese
 military intervention is not required.   "How can 3,500
 men save the aggressors from defeat in war?"   (CPR
 government statement of 12 March)  The argument was also
 intended, of course, to buoy up North Vietnamese and
 Viet Cong morale.
 By warning,  in the context of non-intervention, that
 the United States had "embarked on the path of a Korean-
 type war" (CPR government statement of 12 March), the
 Chinese further reduced the deterrent value of the Korean
 War analogy.  And by using the analogy in another con-
 text--namely, in deploying South Korean troops to Viet-
 nam, the United States "has gone farther down the path
 of fighting a Korean-type war" (People's Daily article
 of 18 March)--while threatening no coup ermeasures,
 *Later,  n May, the-Chinese explicitly contrasted Ameri-
 can air and naval power with Communist capability on the
 ground, declaring that "American naval and air superiority"
 is no match for "revolutionary war" on the ground and
 "That is why we say, the enemy may fight in the way it
 chooses, but we fight in our way."  (People's Daily edi-
 torial of 7 May  This was an indirect a m ss on that
 Hanoi and Peiping did not have the capability to prevent
 the air strikes.

 Peiping further weakened it.*  Actually,  in the-apparent
 Chinese view, the PLA would be used to act on the analogy
 only if American ground forces moved across the 17th
 parallel, defeating PAVN units and continuing to advance
 northward.   On this point, Edgar Snow in April reported
 the "thinking of the Chinese leaders" as follows:   "Only
 after repeated warnings were Chinese volunteers sent into
 the Korean War.  They did not intervene until the trans-
 portation and communications networks across the Yalu
 River began to be bombed."  Snow's distortion on the
 matter of bombed networks across the Yalu--if the dis-
 tortion came from the Chinese--would weaken the analogy
 to the point of 'implying that China in this case would
 not-intervene unless China itself were attacked.   While
 it seems doubtful that the   h nese were trying to en-
 .courage this impression (as they were taking a different
 line in other interviews in the same'period), Snow seemed
 to be saying, at the least, that Peiping would not con-
 sider air strikes against North Vietnam a sufficient rea-
 son for PLA intervention.   (His views were set forth in
 an article in the Tokyo Sekai, #4, April 1965.)**
 Regarding the matter of "volunteers," in the context
 of air attacks on the North, Chinese pledges to send
 them Tiad political-psychological value--primarily for
 Chinese prestige, pressure on neutrals, and popular
 morale in the North--but had no military meaning.   Although
 s weakening process had been accelerated by use
 of the analogy in Chinese statement3 published on 13
 February and 4 March following the early February and
 early March air strikes on the North.

 the early and mid-March air strikes spurred Hanoi to
 publicize offers of the Russians, Chinese, Cubans, and
 others to send volunteers "to fight beside their Viet-
 namese comrades" (Nhan Dan editorial of 17 March), the
 North Vietnamese leaders almost certainly viewed these
 publicized offers as having no real deterrent value.
 In mid-March, Chou En-lai in effect admitted this, rul-
 ing out PLA intervention by alluding to DRV self-reliance.
 Replying to a French correspondent's question regarding
 air bombardment of the North Vietnamese, Chou said:   "In
 the first place, they can defend themselves."  Hanoi it-
 self declared self-reliance the real Vietnamese Communist
 policy on military manpower, and voluntary enlistment of
 Vietnamese was depicted in the 14 and 17 March Nhan Dan
 editorials as providing the necessary fighting an
 reserve force for the PAVN. When, therefore, Hanoi's
 Council of Ministers' meeting on 4 April stressed self-
 reliance in fighting, it was merely formalizing the fact
 that Vietnamese Communists were fighting and would fight
 alone in the war's then-current phase.
 Regarding the matter of large-scale PAVN troop
 movements into the South--a policy Peiping apparently
 preferred--Hanoi tried to dispel the impression abroad
 that it would retaliate against the mid-March strikes
 by taking such, radical military action.  The North Viet-
 namese leaders probably believed at the time that a
 large-scale--rather than piecemeal--PAVN movement across
 the 17th parallel would spur the United States into
 launching massive air strikes against all targets in the
 North.  When Hanoi broadcast the 22 March Liberation
 Front statement, which appealed for support from the
 North, it changed the key sentence to a more restrained
 and contingent warning--i.e., from "we will call" to
 "we will have to call in case of need" on those south-
 erners sent North in 1954.   Similarly, when it had called
 a few days earlier on PAVN forces to defend the country
 "in coordination with the liberation forces" in the South
 (Nhan Dan editorial of 16 March), the context had suggested

 that the PAVN would defend the North and the Viet Cong
 would "defend" the South.*  By stressing North-South
 "coordination," Hanoi in these statements seemed to be
 sidestepping the major issue--that is, whether to launch
 a large-scale retaliatory attack southward--and insist-
 ing instead that Viet Cong operations in the South (such
 as the bombing of the American embassy in Saigon) was a
 coordinated and appropriate response to air strikes
 against the North.
 Peiping's prestiges was damaged by the March air
 strikes.  These strikes destroyed the concept of a
 sanctuary and forced them to recognize that Mao was
 wrong in thinking that small wars could be fought with
 only slight risks to the base areas and to the security
 of other bloc countries.  The Chinese were compelled
 to fall back on the argument that the United States would
 not win the final victory.  They were also compelled to
 screen their military inaction behind a cloud of words,
 which included the unprecedented pledge to send men to
 fight in the South.  This pledge was made in response to
 the Liberation Front's 22 March appeal with an eye to
 (a) recouping setbacks in Peiping's prestige, (b) compet-
 ing with Moscow on the matter of willingness to send
 volunteers,  and (c) preventing further increases

 of American (or anti-Communist) ground forces in the
 South.*  However, the pledge was hedged.  China is
 "ready to send our men, whenever the South Vietnamese
 people want them, to fight together with the South Viet-
 namese people to annihilate the American aggressors"
 (People's Daily editorial of 25 March).   Chen Yi and
 C o En-Taiused the same hedge--i.e., whenever wanted--
 on 28 and 29 March respectively.   In the 25 March edi-
 torial, Peiping was careful to distinguish between the
 fact that the Viet Cong had already called for "aid, in-
 cluding arms and all other war materials" (and were in
 fact receiving such aid) and the fact that they had not
 yet called for fighting men.   That is, the Chinese in
 effect told Washington that their real position was not
 to commit PLA forces to fight in Vietnam at that time`. *
 The Chinese leaders hoped to deter the United States
 from striking by air at China by making it easy for
 ens   .vi y to  e ping's inaction and setbacks in
 prestige was'also reflected in (a) a pro-Communist news-
 paper's appeal to readers in Hung Kong to send letters
 to the editor to refute local Chinese Nationalist claims
 that Chinese, not Americans,  are the real "paper tigers"
 (Wen Wei Pao editorial of 14 April) and (b) Peng?Chen's
 use oT`a Fard adjective--e.g., China is "willing to take
 emergency action" to force the Americans out of Vietnam
 (speech of 18 April).  But Peng was ambiguous on the pre-
 cise nature of that "emergency action."  His remark, made
 at a time when the delegation led by Le Duan was in Mos-
 cow, was primarily intended to regain some ground lost
 to Moscow as the Soviet pressed their post-Khrushchev
 effort to increase influence with the North Vietnamese
 leaders.
 **Regarding the matter of negotiations, the 25 March
 editorial suggested that the Chinese also intended their
 position to serve as a means of applying more pressure
 on Hanoi to adopt a stand--against negotiations--similar
 in degree of harshness to that of the Front and Peiping.

 Washington to read the hedge in their position on the
 matter of sending volunteers.   That they were anxious to
 make this clear to Washington is suggested by (a) Chen       25X1
 that China did not intend to intervene mili-  25X1
 tarily in Vietnam so long as Hanoi did not request China
 to do so and (b) the story given
 in Peiping on 25 March--that is, on the same day    a
 Peiping published its bold-appearing but substantivel
 the time not yet ripe for send-
 ing PLA forces to North Vietnam or to the South, that
 Viet Cong forces would first be strengthened by regrouped
 southerners, that after Hanoi and Haiphong had been bombed
 and the North had suffered considerable damage, PAVN
 forces might cross the demarcation line and strike at
 American bases in the South, and that only if, at some
 future time, there were fear that American ground forces
 would sweep the whole of Vietnam (including the North),
 China would intervene with PLA units.  These signals to
 Washington from Peiping that the PLA would not be used
 in Vietnam except in a remote contingency were published
 at a time when the Chinese seemed intent primarily on
 deterring further American strikes against North Vietnam.
 They thus contradicted the ostensible intent.   It is
 probable, therefore, that Peiping was more concerned at
 the time with deterring the United States from striking
 at bases in China--and was implicitly arguing to this
 end that since the PLA is not building up, a pre-emptive
 American air strike is unnecessary.
 This increased concern about possible strikes against
 Chinese bases was expressed in various ways.  For example,
 a Peiping government statement of 12 March declared that
 American threats to bomb China would not frighten Peiping;
 Daily editorial of 29 March stated that after attacng--
 Sou                          and North Vietnam, Washington's "next step will be
 aggression against China;" Chen Yi told
 on 31 March that an attack on China might come at any time,

 and that China was preparing its defenses;
 The 9 April attack of Chinese Communist MIG air-
 craft on American Navy aircraft southwest of Hainan prob-
 ably was intended as a warning to Washington and further
 reflected Peiping's real concern that the mainland, or
 at least Hainan, might be hit by American (or Chinese
 Nationalist) air and naval strikes.
 The shift to increased concern occurred roughly at
 the time when,  in March, the Chinese leaders were made
 clearly aware that their effort to deter strikes against
 the North had failed.  They believed that these strikes
 would he sustained and even expanded.  Central Committee
 member, Liao Cheng-chih, for example, was quoted on the
 air strikes by the Japanese correspondent in Peiping:
 In order to accomplish a revolution, they
 must bear even their own country's being
 ruined.   (Tokyo Shimbun of 26 March, based
 on a telep o econversation between the
 paper's main office and its correspondent
 in Peiping on 25 March)
 On 31 March, the Chinese again hinted at their view that
 the deterrence effort had failed and they could not pre-
 vent further American air attacks on the North.   They
 declared that the Viet Cong.would punish the United States
 "no matter how many bombs it may dump oil Nort4 Vietnam"
 (People's Daily "Commentator" article of 31 March pub-
 lished following the bombing of the American embassy in
 Saigon).  At a time when North Vietnamese targets were
 subjected to air attacks and when the Chinese leaders in
 effect were telling the North Vietnamese leaders that
 these strikes must be absorbed, the Chinese cast about
 for a plausible line to justify their encouragement of
 Hanoi to face even national destruction.   Partly to
 justify the'sacrif ical course they were urging upon the
 Vietnamese'and partly in response to Secretary Rusk's 3
 May remark on the possibility of suspending bombing, the
 Chinese leaders discussed more openly than before the

 prospect of American strikes against the mainland.  Pub-
 licly, they pressed forward along the line that Peiping
 would support the war in Vietnam even if China, too, were
 to be bombed.  The Chinese in this way hoped to add weight
 to their argument that Hanoi should not accept negotiations
 in return for a suspension of bombing.
 Further, the Chinese leaders hoped to indicate to
 Washington the futility of any future course which en-
 visaged various degrees of bombing the mainland of China.
 Marshal Ho Lung declared that Peiping would support the
 war in the South  no matter how great the cost and
 sacrifice" (speech of 7 May at the East German embassy);
 Lo Jui-ching wrote that Peiping would help the Vietnamese
 "to the limit of our capabilities" even if the United
 States "enlarges the war"  (Red Flag article of 10 May);
 and "Observer" wrote that suppor  would continue "whether
 you bomb China or not.... We have taken into full account
 every war venture you may possibly launch and made adequate
 preparations to meet it"  (People's Daily article of 12
 May).  The latter statement a ou  preparations strongly
 suggested air defense precautions.
 As they prepared for the prospect of air strikes
 against the mainland  (adopting the strategy of expecting
 the worst development),* they also indicated that they
 *Lo Jui-mv-ching wrote that "preparations must envisage
 the use by imperialists of nuclear weapons as well as
 conventional weapons" and went on to claim that the United
 States was converting the war into "a local war of the
 Korean type"  (Red Flag article of 10 May).  The People's
 Daily editorial of 14 May also claimed that special -war
 was being expanded into regional war.  This emphasis con-
 flicts with the CCP doctrinal position that small wars     -
 can be confined and contrasts with that of 1961-62, when
 Chinese materials stressed the small-scale, "special war-
 fare" nature of the fighting (see footnote on page 4).
 The change in Peiping's appraisal of the extent of the
 war reflects their awareness that not only North Vietnam,
 but also China has been denied the "right"  of indefinite
 sanctuary.

 preferred not to initiate a Sino-American clash.  Lo Jui-
 ching laid it down that "Our principle is:  We will not
 attack unless we are attacked.   If we are attacked, we
 will certainly counterattack."   (Red Flag article of 10
 May,  in which Lo suggests that the Vi-eYn-amese can handle
 the fighting alone)
 Regarding the strategy of the war in the South, the
 Chinese apparently continued to press Hanoi to accelerate
 the introduction of regular PAVN units into the fighting.
 The Chinese seem to have responded to the air strikes of
 early February and March by encouraging Hanoi to move
 PAVN forces on a large-scale across the 17th parallel.
 In early June, they again urged Hanoi:
 All the Vietnamese people, including the
 people of North Vietnam, have acquired
 the right to exert their utmost to hit
 back-the 17th parallel provisions
 military demarcation line ceases to
 exist and the people in North Vietnam
 cease to be restricted in giving support
 to their fellow countrymen in the South.
 (People's Daily "Observer" article of 1
 June
 Unlike its February reaction, Hanoi did not delete this
 passage from the domestic broadcasts of the "Observer"
 article which were beamed on 3 June.  This suggests that
 the North Vietnamese leaders may be willing to infiltrate
 a few more PAVN units to fight in the South.   However,
 as for PLA action, "Observer" treated the matter with
 caution.   "The Chinese people have the right to do all
 in their power to aid the Vietnamese people in counter-
 attacking."   Further, on 29 May, Chen Yi had been quoted
 in People's Daily as telling a French correspondent that
 thenamese "are perfectly capable of driving the
 American aggressors out of their country by relying on
 their cwn forces."  This is obviously the Chinese lead-
 ers' preferred course in Vietnam.
