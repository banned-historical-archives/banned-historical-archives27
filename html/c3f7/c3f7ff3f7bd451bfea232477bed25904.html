 1.    Action Requested:   None.   This memorandum is for
 your information only.
 2.    Background:   In the memorandum of your conversation
 with Dr. Brzezinski mention was made of a misunderstanding
 over Deng Xiaoping's having endorsed just before his U. S.
 visit a letter by 100 Generals and Admirals.   You indicated
 that you were not familiar with this letter.   I believe this
 must refer to a letter to the President by more than 170 re-
 tired military officers, including senior Generals and Ad-
 mirals, warning him of what they described as an "increasing
 Soviet challenge" to the United States.   The letter quotes an
 authoritative U.  S.  Government National Intelligence Estimate
 as acknowledging that the Russians were heading for superi-
 ority, not parity, in the military arena, and cites data on
 Soviet arms developments as chapter and verse.

 170 Retired Top Military Officers
 Warn Carter of a Soviet Challenge
 By DREW MIDDLETON
 More than 170 retired generals and ad.
 mirals have warned President Carter ofd
 what they describe as an "increasing
 Soviet challenge" to the United States.
 In an open letter, they said a National
 Intelligence Estimate that is descri bed as
 "the most authoritative U.S.. Govern-
 ment evaluation of intelligence data" had
 --finally acknowledged that the Russians
 were "heading for superiority, not parity,
 in the military arena."
 The letter said an American intera-
 gency study on the global military bal-
 ance concluded recently that "in a nonnu-
 clear conflict between the Soviet Union
 and the United States in the Middle East,
 Israel alone might deter Soviet combat
 forces' intervention or prevent the com-
 pletion of such deployment."
 Were it not for the ability of Israel's
 ground forces, the officers declared, the
 United States would have to station sig-
 nificant forces and equipment in the Mid-
 dle East.
 Soviet Objectives Described
 The signers, among whom were 61
 generals, 15 lieutenant generals and 4 ad-
 mirals, included Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt
 Jr., former Chief of Naval Operations;
 Gen. Paul L. Freeman Jr., former Arm
 commander in Europe; Gen. T. W. Park
 er, former Army chief of staff in Europe;
 Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer, who w
 commander of the China theater o
 operations at the end of World War II;
 Maj. Gen. John K. Sieglaub, former chief
 of staff, United States forces, Korea, an
 Maj. Gen. George J. Keegan Jr., forme
 chief of intelligence, United States Ai
 Force.
 They urged Mr. Carter to recognize I
 rael's value as an ally that can defend it
 self and said Israel should be reinforced
 to avoid sending American forces to the
 area.
 The Soviet Union's "imperial objec-
 tives" were described as the neutraliza-
 tion of Western Europe, partly by deny-
 ing it access to oil, the encirclement of
 China and the isolation of the United
 States.
 The letter said the Soviet focus on the
 Middle East to reach these objectives
 represented "a real and growing threat
 to Western security." It said Soviet influ-
 ence and power had expanded in the east-i
 ern Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the)'
 Persian Gulf, Afghanistan had comet
 under Soviet control and "anti-American
 forces" were harassing the Governments
 in Iran and Turkey.
 Cuban mercenaries were described as
 carrying out Soviet policies In Angola,)
 Ethiopia, Zaire, Syria and Lebanon.
 Debate on Arms Accord
 In appealing to the President to "re-
 store the global military balance," the
 writers foreshadowed what is expected to
 be a national debate over the second
 strategic arms limitation treaty. In the
 absence of an. "indispensable military
 equilibrium," they said, "we oppose a
 'deal'     freezes
 reinforces permanent
 gic superiority."                '
 The letter said the challenge was grow-
 ing in these areas:
 The Soviet Union has developed seven
 ICBM missile systems since 1965, the'
 United States one.
 9The Russians have invested heavily
 in submarine-launched ballistic missiles
 and modernized their ICBM's.       ' ?
 4The so-called Backfire bomber, which
 the letter lists in the Soviet strategic arse-
 nal although the Russians call it a medi-
 um-range aircraft, "is capable of deliver-
 ing weapons anywhere in the United
 States without refueling.
 9Soviet advances in multiple independ-
 ently  targetable  re-entry  vehicles
 (MIRV's) are rapidly overcoming the
 American lead in the quantity and quality of nuclear warheads.
 9The development of Soviet naval
 power threatens vital sea lanes that pro-
 vide resources essential to the United l
 The writers also mentioned a pointi
 raised by nuclear scientists, academic
 students of Soviet policy and many for-.I
 eign   .and   American   intelligence,
 analysts: "Soviet defense literature ex
 pressely rejects the Western doctrine of.
 mutual assured destruction.' It rejects
 specifically the notion that nuclear war
 means suicide. Soviet forces are struc-
 to fight, survive and win a nuclear
 tured
 war."
 Mr. Carter was urged to build a coati-'
 tion of "genuine peace," including Israeli,
 and Japan as well as the North Atlantic!
 Treaty Organization nations.

 tranquil. I have said this to a number
 of foreign friends: that the nuclear
 arsenal of the Soviet Union and the
 constant development of their strate-
 gic weapons means that we can say
 that the Soviet 'anion is already on a
 par with the U.S. and we may say that
 in the near future it may surpass the
 Uni;ed States. The Soviet military
 )adet takes up around 30 percent .it
 he gross national product. What does
 a C do with al', these things? With pro
 mar gcinp. on, it has increased its
 stindng army in three years from 3
 c n5 tr_ii,r^- then. What does one do
 there detente in 1977 or in 1978 or will ,
 we see it in 1979? Let us look at the
 Mediterranean, at the Middle East, at
 North Africa. Was not 1978 More tense
 than 1977? We see that last year South
 Yemen was taken over-by the Soviet
 Union and the Soviet Union gained
 influence in ithiopia. If we go further
 east, there's Afghanistan and now
 there's Iran where there seems to be
 no end to the trouble. And Pakistan.
 And further to the east, Vietnam con-
 trols Laos by military means and the
 ":etnamese made a major invasion
 into Cambodia with more than 10 divi-
 sions. And then if we go even further
 east, do we see that the Soviet military
 force has been strengthened or weak-
 ened in the Asian and Pacific region?
 At least its navy and air force have
 been strengthened. What is particu-
 larly noteworthy is that the Soviet
 fleet in the Far East is now equal in
 strength to the Soviet fleet in the
 ..tlantic. So all this gives serious cun-

 A: We look upon it as being big he-
 gemon sr , where one wants to exer-

 would first try to attain its aisa by

 say in Europe. by means of the

 of war is the Soviet Union, not the U.S.

 the US is in strategic retreat or does
 he believe that the U.S. intentions are
 more pacific?
 A: At the present time, the U.S. has
 I no reason and no need to want to
 i launch a war. it is in the interest of
 the U.S. to maintain the status quo.
 1'he problem is that maintaining the
 status quo is difficult.
 Q: When you go to Washington, I
 think you'l! bear that President Car-
 ter, Secretary of State Vance and vari-
 ous members of Congress do not en-
 tir, iy agree with the retired generals.

 have good relations with the Soviet
 union and China at the same time,
 iI'hai isyour reaction to that?
 A: It is only possible for each indi-
 v:dual to express his point of view. No
 country can impose its views on
 another. But we believe in what
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier
 Chou En-lai sail repeatedly; that from
 the.point of view of giebal strategy
 and international politics, even
 where there was no normalization be-
 tween China and the U.S., there were'
 still many common points between
 China and the U.S. What we are faced
 with is stark reality. Reality cannot be
 changed by any person's subjective
 views.

 1972, the third in 1974. We have con-
 stantly said not that we are opposed to
 such agreements, but that they are of
 no use, that they are not of much use.
 In 1963 when the tripartite partial test
 ban treaty was signed between the
 U.S., Great Britain and the Soviet
 Union, there %k I., a gre.,; dlscrepan y

 and the Soviet Union., At that time all
 three coi:ntries;iak;n meet the
 twn of dealing with China; that is, to
 prevent China from acquiring nu-
 clear weapons, but this aim was not at-
 tained. the U.S. and Great Bzftair also
 wanted to limit the Soviet Union in
 nuclear weapons. Did they attain this
 aim? In 1972, and this was after a nine-
 year span, the Soviet Union had tried
 its best to catch up. By 1972 we cannot
 say that the Soviet Union was already
 on par with the U.S. But the discrep-
 ancy between the two countries had
 already narrowed. And then in the
 24'i years before the 1971 ineeting at
 Vladivostok and the secord agree-
 ruent that was reached at the time
 even the U.S. could not but admit that
 the strength of the two countries was
 more or less equal. What is more, both
 sides admitted at the Vladivostok
 meeting that the agreement did not
 put restraints on either side. And
 since 1974 it has Seen another four
 years or so and another agreement is
 to be concluded. Could we believe
 that the agreement could prevent the
 Soviet Union from furtherdevelup-
 ment?

 strain them.
 Q. You mean they won't comply
 with it?
 A: Because the so-called supervision
 or surveillance will not work, no mat-

 the Vladivostok agreement, Dr. Kis-

 about it, and I said to Dr. Kissinger,

 agreements. Were just being sober.
 'I' n not opposing your

 We're just being sober.'
 One should not rely on such a thing'
 In seeking world peace and world
 stability, such agreements are norther
 as significant nor as useful as the nor-
 malization of relations between China
 and Japan And if you look at the ques-
 tioa in an even broader perspective,
 such an agreement is not Rs important
 as the strengthening of relations he
 tween the U.. and Europe at,.(.' be-
 tween the U.S. and Japan, nor as
 important as taking a more

 attitude t-Iwrads each specific event
 as it occurs. The first characteristic of
 the Soviet Union is that it always
 adopts the attitude of bullying the soft
 and fearing the strong. The second
 characteristic of the Soviet Union is
 that it will go in and grab at every
 opportunity.
