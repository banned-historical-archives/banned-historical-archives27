 YUGOSLAVS BRANDED ANTI - MARXIST-LENINIST .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 Moscow republished on 6 May in Pravda the savage
 condemnation the Chinese Communists hurled at the Yugo-
 slavs two days earlier, indicating that the USSR has
 decided the Yugoslav ideology can no longer be toler-
 ated in the Communist world on any terms acceptable to
 Belgrade.   Soviet attempts through "comradely" exchanges
 to have the Yugoslav party's controversial program re-
 vised apparently have been abandoned, and the Yugoslav
 leaders are being branded as "out-and-out revisionists"
 and "anti-Marxists."  The Chinese Communists have. made
 it clear to Belgrade that Peiping entirely disapproves
 of "national Communism," and at the same time have dis-
 pelled any hopes among Eastern European leaders that
 Peiping would support their efforts to attain freedom

 The aide-memoire Foreign Minister Gromyko presented
 to the three Western ambassadors on 5 May clears the way
 for separate negotiations with them.  Gromyko is likely
 to argue that the extensive agenda proposals the USSR
 has made in the series of notes sent since December should
 be used as a basis for negotiations leading to an early
 foreign ministers' meeting.  'Moscow apparently is still
 concentrating its efforts on a parity plan that would in-
 clude three states from each side at a summit meeting and
 probabl  still hopes to include some neutral representation         25X1

 The new breakdown in Rene Pleven's efforts to form
 a French government underscores the continuing difficulty
 of resolving non-Communist party differences over the Al-
 gerian issue.  Meanwhile, France's economic and social
 problems show new signs of worsening, and critics of the
 regime, who so far in the 23-day-old crisis:have been rel-
 atively quiet, may renew their attack on the weakness of
 the Fourth Republic.

 MAY DAY CELEBRATIONS IN THE SINCE-SOVIET BLOC .  .  .  .  .   .   .  Page 4
 The peaceful coexistence theme at the May Day
 celebration in Moscow set the tone for the occasion
 elsewhere in the bloc, and the traditional parades
 were much less spectacular than in other years.     A
 protest against flights of American aircraft over
 the Arctic was echoed in other bloc capitals and
 the rearmament of West Germany was denounced in East
 Germany and Prague.  Only East Germany among the
 European satellites included military participation
 in its parade.  Although the armed forces took part
 in the festivities in North Vietnam, the military
 theme was generally played down in the Far East.

 NEW EAST GERMAN ECONOMIC MEASURES TO BE ANNOUNCED   .  .  .  .  Page 5
 The end of food rationing and the introduction of
 a new wage system, possibly accompanied by increased
 work norms, may be announced at the fifth congress of
 the East German Socialist Unity (Communist) party in
 July.  The measures are likely to cause a rise in food
 prices and a reduction in wages, thus lowering the
 standard of living and adding to the general antipathy
 of the workers toward the Ulbricht regime                                   25X1
 SOVIET DIPLOMATIC TACTICS IN NORTH AFRICA     . . .  .  .  .  .  Page 6
 Moscow has recently sharpened its public criti-
 cism of French actions in Algeria.  Concurrently Soviet
 diplomats in Paris have maintained their campaign to
 increase French suspicion of American policy in North
 Africa, and are privately expressing support, particularly
 to right-wing elements, for France's continued presence in
 the area.  These tactics appear designed to prolong the
 Algerian conflict, which Moscow is ex ploitin  for long-
 term strategic advantages.
 EGYPTIAN INFLUENCE GROWING IN LIBYA   4          .  .  . .          ..  .  Page 7
 Egypt's anti-Nestern campaign in Libya appears to
 be gaining momentum.  Libyan newspapers and schoolteachers
 and pro-Egyptian elements in the Libyan Government have
 joined Cairo radio in aiming an almost constant barrage
 of criticism at the pro-Western stand of., the government.
 In particular, they are attacking the American aid pro-
 gram and the  presence of American military installations
 in the country.  Partly in response, the cabinet may de-
 mand renegotiation. of the base agreement,

 PART II (continued)
 GREEK ELECTIONS   .   .    . .    . ?
 The attempt by the USSR to influence the Greek elec-
 tions of 11 May with its promises of economic aid and
 threats of possible atomic destruction if missile bases
 are located in Greece is not expected to have a signif-
 icant effect on the electorate.  As the relatively quiet
 campaign draws to a close, most observers believe the
 right-center party of"former Premier Karamanlis will re-
 ceive a large plurality--and possibly a strong working
 majority--in the new parliament.  The..Communist-front
 United Democratic Left probably will finish behind both
 Karamanlis' party and another pro-Western center party,
 the Liberals.

 NORTH VIETNAM'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CONCLUDES SESSION   .  . .  Page  9
 The recent session of the North Vietnamese assembly
 elevated to top government positions individuals favor-
 ing"hardline" policies.  The assembly also enacted
 measures to tighten Hanoi's grip over the provincial
 administrations and strengthen its hand in economic af-
 fairs.  Details of the Three-Year Economic Plan (1958-
 60) presented to the assembly have not been released,
 but earlier statements indicate that expansion of food
 production will be stressed and that there will be strong
 d
 pressures to step up collectivization of agriculture an
 socialization of industry.

 PEIPING'S TRADE WITH FREE WORLD CONTINUES UPWARD TREND                    Page 10
 Although Communist China continues to rely on im-
 ports of bloc equipment for its major industrial under-
 takings, it is turning to non-Communist sources to fill
 its growing requirements for machinery.  Communist China's
 total foreign trade in 1957 was less than in 1956, but
 its trade with the free world last year apparently in-
 creased slightly over the $1.09 billion estimated for 1956.          25X1
 JAPANESE NATIONAL ELECTIONS.  .

 The Socialists are expected to make some gains in
 the Japanese  general elections on 22 May, but not
 enough to endanger conservative control of the lower
 house.  A Socialist advance of more than 20 seats, how-
 ever, could lead eventually to the replacement of Prime
 Minister Kishi as government and party leader, and
 stimulate a trend toward nPufralism and   o er relations
 with the Communist bloc.

 BURMESE GOVERNMENT SPLIT OVER PERSONAL RIVALRIES .       .  .  Page 12
 The long-smoldering personal antagonism between
 Burmese Prime Minister U Nu and Deputy Prime Minister
 Kyaw Nyein has resulted in an open split in the gov-
 ernment Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League.  Parlia-
 ment is to meet in special session on 5 June to debate
 a no-confidence motion brought against U Nu by Kyaw
 Nyein.  Unless the breach is healed, Burma will be
 threatened by intensified political instability-as
 the resulting government, whether formed by Kyaw Nyein
 or U Nu, would be either a minority government or a
 coalition including elements of the present opposition,
 and would command only a small majority.                                      25X1
 JAGAN EXTENDS COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN BRITISH GUIANA  .  .  .  Page 13
 Since his electoral victory of last August, Cheddi
 Jagan, long-time Communist leader of the People's Pro-
 gressive party in British Guiana, has followed moderate
 policies as leader of the colonial government
 FH_    long-range trouble-
 making potential is enhanced by recent overtures made
 to him by rival political groups of the new West Indies
 Federation, each of which hopes it may secure his sup-
 port if he brings the colony into the federation.
 GUATEMALANS DISILLUSIONED WITH NEW PRESIDENT    . . .  . a  .  Page 15
 The Guatemalan public is becoming disillusioned with
 President Ydigoras, hardly two months after his inaugura-
 tion.  He has not provided the able leadership expected
 and has yet to tackle any major economic or political
 problem.  His campaign for the "return" of British Hon-
 duras is purely diversionary.  While no immediate threat
 to the regime is apparent, continuation of the present
 drifting would further enhance growing leftist strength
 and seriously imperil Ydigoras' chances of serving his
 full six-year, term.

 FRONDIZI'S FIRST MOVES IN ARGENTINA  .  .  .  . . . . .  .  .  .  Page 16
 Frondizi used both his 1 May inaugural address and
 his first act as President to underline the seriousness
 of Argentina's economic situation.  The USSR's visiting
 delegation reportedly urged that Argentina "follow the
 example of Egypt and India," apparently a reference to
 Soviet credits for basic industries on easy terms.  Fron-
 dizi, however, hopes to receive American assistance; he
 expressed to Vice President Nixon his desire for prompt
 US government credits as a means of encouraging private
 investment.
 THE EUROPEAN COMMON MARKET AND LATIN AMERICA . .  .  ...  .  .  Page 16
 The recent offer of the six members of the Euro-
 pean Common Market to set up permanent consultative
 machinery with various Latin American countries seems
 to be an effort to mitigate the fears of underdeveloped
 countries generally that their exports to Europe will be
 curtailed.  When the tariff provisions of the Common
 Market take effect next January, these countries will be
 competing with colonial territories in Africa which are
 included in the new trading area.
 HAMMARSKJOLD'S INTERVENTION IN THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL .
 The UN secretary general's statement on 29 April
 on behalf of the American-proposed Arctic inspection
 plan is unlikely to affect in the long run, his stand,..
 ing as an independent and impartial negotiator in world
 affairs.  Although his. action has been described as an
 unprecedented break in his impartiality, most observers
 now probably agree that the "calculated risk" he took
 was in keeping with his mandate under the UN Charter--a
 mandate he has interpreted liberally in the past.

 Italy's national elections on 25 and 26 May are ex-
 -pected to produce no major shifts in the voting strengths
 of the principal parties.  There seems little doubt that
 the Christian Democratic  party, though remaining the lead-
 ing party, will still be unable to form a majority gov-
 ernment by itself, and that the Communists and Nenni So-
 cialists will together retain the support of about a third
 of the electorate.  Party alliances have loosened since
 1953, however, and factions within parties differ consider-
 ably on the forming of new party ties.   The relative showing
 of these factions, therefore, ma  si nal long-term chap es

 YUGOSLAVS BRANDED ANTI - MARXIST-LENINIST
 Moscow repub ished on 6
 May in Pravda the savage con-
 demnation the Chinese Commu-
 nists hurled at the Yugoslavs
 two days earlier, indicating.
 that the USSR has decided that
 the Yugoslav ideology can no
 longer be tolerated in the
 Communist world on any terms
 acceptable to Belgrade.   Soviet
 attempts through "comradely"
 exchanges to have the Yugoslav
 party's controversial program
 revised apparently have been
 abandoned, and the Yugoslav
 leaders now are being branded
 as "out-and-out revisionists"
 and "anti-Marxists."
 During the Yugoslav party
 congress, bloc party spokesmen
 clearly indicated they hoped
 the Yugoslavs would concede
 much of their heretical ideology
 for the sake of maintaining a
 position within the Communist
 world.   Poland and subsequently
 Hungary, whose party leaders
 seem to be sympathetic toward
 Yugoslavia's desire to follow
 its own "road to socialism,"
 made special efforts to effect
 changes in the Yugoslav pro-
 gram.   In view of the obvious
 unity of the delegates at the
 Yugoslav congress in endorsing
 divergencies from Moscow, how-
 ever,  the parties of the Sino-
 Soviet bloc have subsequently.
 said little concerning the con-
 tinuation of good party or
 state relations.  While the
 Chinese Communist  attack still
 leaves the door open for Tito
 to regain the status of a re-
 spectable Communist, it demands
 in effect the abandonment of
 the entire ideological basis
 of the Yugoslav "road to so-
 cialism."
 In the bloc's sharpest re-
 buke to the Yugoslav program,
 the Chinese party newspaper on
 4 May accused the Yugoslav lead-
 ers of speaking "like the re-
 actionaries of all countries"
 and described their "road to
 socialism" as "surrender to
 capitalism."  In a key passage,
 the statement stressed that the
 Yugoslav ideas, which are aimed
 at undermining bloc "unity,"
 must be "openly and uncompro-
 misingly criticized."  The Pei-
 ping party's position, as set
 forth in its theoretical jour-
 nal, is that allegiance to
 the USSR is the "foundation
 stone" of bloc unity, and that
 demands for "equality must not
 be set up against" this unity.
 The heretical Yugoslav
 draft party program provided
 the Chinese Communists with an
 opportunity to remove any doubt
 in Belgrade that Peiping entire-
 ly disapproves of "national
 Communism" and to dispel any
 hopes among  Eastern  European
 leaders that Peiping would sup-
 port their efforts to attain
 freedom from Soviet control.
 The blunt Chinese statement
 was probably also calculated
 to convince the Poles that
 they cannot expect any  support
 from  Communist  China  for a
 course independent of  Moscow.
 Peiping for some time has
 been careful to avoid encourag-
 ing Gomulka and his more radical
 supporters who in the past in-
 terpreted Chinese statements
 and developments as support for
 their own views.   The  Chinese
 portray Mao Tse-tung's theoreti-
 cal innovations as a continua-
 tion rather than refutation of

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 8 May 1958
 Soviet doctrine, and Soviet
 experience  is extolled         in
 China.   Speakers at the Chi-
 nese Communist party congress
 now in session are expected
 to stress the need for attack-
 ing the divisive aspect of
 Belgrade's concepts and to de-
 fend the indispensability of
 Soviet leadership.
 While spokesmen for both
 the bloc and Yugoslavia may
 continue to pay lip service
 to the maintenance of correct
 state relations, an  intense
 ideological attack on Tito as
 initiated and called  for  by
 the Chinese Communists cannot
 help but lead to a marked de-
 terioration in Yugoslav-bloc
 relations.   No specific  date
 has been announced as yet for
 the visit of President Voro-
 shilov, who is still expected
 in Belgrade before mid-May.
 Since this visit is considered
 purely a state function,   it
 may still materialize.   In view
 of the condemnation of Tito as
 an "irreconcilable enemy" of
 Marxism-Leninism, however, the
 realization of the "party-state"
 visit  Tito  has scheduled for
 late May to Warsaw  has  been
 made more  difficult.   There
 now can be little  doubt that
 Gomulka, touring Eastern Europe
 and espousing  the  unity  of
 the Communist world, is uneasy
 over the prospects of convers-
 ing with the heretic Tito.
 SOVIET SUMMIT TACTICS
 ._. The aide-memoire Foreign
 Minister Gromyko presented to
 the three Western ambassadors
 on 5 May clears the way for
 separate negotiations with
 them.   Gromyko is likely to ar-
 gue that the extensive agenda
 proposals it has made in the
 series of notes sent since De-
 cember and reportedly summarized
 in detail in a separate memoran-
 dum given the ambassadors on
 5 May should be used as a basis
 for negotiations leading to an
 early foreign ministers' meeting.
 Previous Soviet agenda
 proposals have been broad enough
 to include virtually all topics
 suggested by the West except
 Eastern Europe, which the USSR
 adamantly refuses to discuss.
 While the USSR will not accept
 German unification as a separate
 agenda item, it anticipates that
 the West will discuss this un-
 det the German peace treaty topic.
 Although the USSR is still
 apparently seeking to avoid de-
 tailed negotiations at.,the am-
 bassAdorial;-level and to expedite
 a. foteignministers' meeting and
 subsequentiy.,:a, summit conference,
 it probably does not expect that
 a summit meeting will be arranged

 quickly.  A Soviet UN official,
 who in late March was urging a
 summit meeting before the Amer-
 ican elections, now suggests
 privately that December is a
 suitable date.
 Although Soviet diplomats
 have reportedly discussed Turk-
 ish participation in a summit
 meeting with officials in Ankara, ,
 Moscow apparently is still con-
 centrating its efforts on a
 parity plan that would include
 only three states from each side.
 Poland and Czechoslovakia remain
 the Soviet candidates.   The
 USSR had given the Western pow-
 ers the choice of separate am-
 bassadorial meetings or a six-
 nation joint meeting, but the
 5 May aide-memoire criticized
 the West for rejecting Polish
 and Czech participation.
 The USSR probably still
 hopes to include some neutrals
 at a summit meeting also.   Fol-
 lowing his 5 May meeting with
 the three ambassadors, Gromyko
 met with ambassadors from all
 the bloc states and. from Sweden,
 India, and Yugoslavia, as he
 did following his first meet-
 ing with the Western ambassadors
 in mid-April. This technique
 not only emphasizes the Soviet
 claims  for  parity  and neu-
 tral  representation                                                               at the
 summit  but  inhibits  the
 Western,  effort ;.to, conduct
 secret negotiations   with the
 USSR at   the  ambassadorial
 level.
 FRENCH POLITICAL CRISIS
 The  breakdown      in  Rene
 Pleven's efforts to form a
 French government underscores
 the continuing difficulty of
 resolving non-Communist party
 differences over the Algerian
 issue,   Meanwhile, France's
 economic and social problems
 show further signs of worsen-
 ing, and critics of the present
 republican  regime, who so far
 in the 23-day-old crisis have
 been relatively quiet, may re-
 new  their                  attack  on  the
 basic weakness  of  the Fourth
 Republic,
 The paramountcy of the Al-
 gerian                                                         issue  was clearly  evi-
 denced as Pleven's  effort to
 pull together a small  center
 coalition,,at President Coty's
 insistence, ran into serious
 difficulty when Pleven tried
 to satisfy both left and right
 in the selection of his cabinet.
 The continuing reluctance  of
 most major  party  leaders to
 participate in his government
 also complicated his task, as
 did apparent unwillingness Of

 special powers despite their
 earlier offer of general sup-
 port.
 Filling the key posts
 of minister for Algeria and
 minister of national defense
 can be expected to be diffi-
 cult for any prospective pre-
 mier.   The trend in the So-
 cialist party toward amore
 liberal approach on North Africa
 has  already  aroused the sus-
 picion of French residents in
 Algeria, and their uneasiness
 will probably buttress rightist
 and Independent  nationalisms
 At the same time the Algerian
 question emphasizes differences
 within the center parties, such
 as the Radical Socialists and
 Pleven's Democratic Resistance
 Union.   New military demands
 for more funds for Algeria and
 for restoration of  the  arms
 production program threaten an
 early  reopening of the bit-
 terly fought defense budget
 issued
 Meanwhile, the  present
 French economic and social pic-
 ture is worsening as the foreign
 exchange balance dwindles again
 and as the rising cost of liv-
 ing spurs labor union threats
 to go all out in strikes for
 higher wages this month.   The
 6 May recommendation of the
 National Accounts Committee
 that wine, meat, and petroleum
 be rationed to ease the balance-
 of-payments difficulties fur-
 nishes new political ammunition
 for the likely clash between
 the Socialists and Independents
 over social and economic poli-
 cies.
 Proponents of a move to
 replace the Fourth Republic may
 seize on Pleven's political dif-
 ficulties as typifying the weak-
 nesses of the present system.
 While President Coty can be ex-
 pected to move quickly to get
 a new candidate--possibly  a
 center "dark horse"--to head
 off any renewed speculation
 on a coup, rumors of the pos-
 sible  return  of  General  de
 Gaulle  may  again spread in
