 OUR BANNER IS COMMUNISM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 2-6
 [Article by Editorial Department]
 [Text] Recently, the facts of numerous illegalities and crimes in the
 economic field have told us that we are facing a serious struggle under new
 conditions between capitalist ideological corruption and socialist ideologi-
 cal opposition to corruption.  This struggle is protracted.  All communists
 and party cadres will have to stand up to new, rigid tests repeatedly during
 the struggle.
 The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has pointed out
 solemnly to the whole party:  We must persist in the party's policy of pursu-
 ing open policies toward foreign countries and flexible economic policies
 domestically to speed up our socialist modernization; while at the same time
 we must persist in carrying on the struggle against corrosion by bourgeois
 ideology and  uphold. the communist integrity of our party forever.  All mem-
 bers and cadres of our party must firmly remember the fundamental aim of our
 party to serve the people wholeheartedly, the eventual aim of our party to
 realize the lofty ideal of communism, and the fundamental nature of our party
 as the vanguard of the working class.  Should any member or cadre of the
 party waver on this fundamental point, he certainly has been affected by the
 corruptive bourgeois ideology.  If he refuses to repent, he is not qualified
 to be a Communist Party member and is betraying the communist cause.
 Communism means, in the first instance, the social system of communism, and,
 in the second instance, the communist movement under the guidance of the
 communist ideological system.  We have conducted the communist movement
 organizationally and with political programs in China ever since the found-
 ing of the party.  We have completed the task of the new democratic revolu-
 tion, the task of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means
 of production, begun socialist construction on a huge scale and entered a new
 historical period of all-round socialist modernization.  We have also com-
 pleted the tasks of a few historical stages in the communist movement.  What
 we are embarking on now is no longer a.communist movement in an ordinary
 sense, which means that the proletariat has not yet won its revolution, has
 not yet seized political power and has not yet become the ruling class. We
 are now conducting a communist movement after we have already set up a

 socialist system, that is, the first stage of the communist system.  We,
 members of the CCP and party cadres, should be proud of this.
 Our tasks of revolution are far from having been accomplished.  This was
 clearly pointed out in the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History
 of Our Party Since the Founding'of the PRC":  "In firmly correcting the mis-
 take of the so-called 'continuous revolution under the dictatorship of the
 proletariat,' a slogan which was advanced during the 'Great Cultural Revolu-
 tion' and which called for the overthrow of one class by another, we abso-
 lutely do not mean that the tasks.of the revolution have been accomplished
 and that there is no need to carry on revolutionary struggles with deter-
 mination.  Socialism aims not just at eliminating all systems of exploitation
 and all exploiting classes but also at greatly expanding the productive
 forces, improving and developing the socialist relations of production and
 the superstructure and, on this basis, gradually eliminating all class
 differences and all major social distinctions and inequalities which are
 chiefly due to the inadequate development of the productive forces until
 communism is finally realized.  This is a great revolution, unprecedented in
 human history."  While working at their posts, all party members and cadres
 must contribute their due share toward this great revolutionary movement.
 If the communist movement is to advance continuously and to win victories,
 our party must conduct communist ideological education among the various
 nationalities of the whole country, but first of all, among party members
 and cadres.  Party members, especially party cadres, should carry on their
 work with communist spirit.  They should shape their words and deeds to
 communist thinking and morality.  Some comrades maintain that we are now in
 a socialist society, so we should promote only socialist morality and should
 not promote communist morality.   This is wrong.   In the stage of the new
 democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong put forth the need to publicize
 communist thinking and Comrade Liu Shaoqi also proposed that communists
 should have communist morality.   Why should communist morality not be advo-
 cated in a socialist society?  It is true that in a socialist society, the
 consumer goods should be allocated to the laborers according to the principle
 of from each according to his ability and to each according to his work. We
 must continuously implement this principle, improve it while carrying out the
 policies, and overcome the malady of egalitarianism.  However, in imple-
 menting this principle, we do not reject the communist attitude toward labor.
 On the contrary, it is necessary to encourage the people to adopt this atti-
 tude.  In particular, the party members and cadres should be encouraged to
 actively participate in voluntary, unpaid labor without fixed quotas.  As a
 matter of fact, many members in our party, as well as many model workers and
 other advanced persons in our country are engaging in noble communist labor
 every day, every month and every year.  There is no contradiction between
 upholding the principle of to each according to his work and advocating the
 communist attitude toward labor.  They supplement each other.  Advocating the
 communist attitude toward labor and the application of communist morality in
 handling the social relationships of various forms will not hinder the imple-
 mentation of the system of to each according to his work and the implementa-
 tion of the various social policies at the present stage of socialism, but
 will generate an indispensable force to promote such implementation.  These

 precious communist elements in socialist society are significant in
 resisting corrosion by capitalist ideology, enhancing enthusiasm and
 creativeness of the working people and promoting healthy development of
 socialist modernization.
 Every member of the party joins the party voluntarily.  That is, beginning
 with the day he takes the oath to join the party, he has pledged his deter-
 mination to struggle all his life for the realization of communism and to
 submit consciously to the restraint of party discipline.  This voluntariness
 includes the determination to abandon all things harmful to the interests of
 the party and to sacrifice his life when he is required to do so.  Every
 party member should correctly handle the relationship between discipline
 and creativeness.  The two coincide if observed,from the communist ideologi-
 cal perspective.  Our proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation
 and our martyrs set examples in many ways.  Comrade Zhou Enlai was a good
 example.  All his life he seldom acted in his own way.  He did whatever the
 party assigned him to do, and did it assiduously.  He achieved great suc-
 cess in what he did.  Some of our comrades hold that the presentation of the
 four basic principles would prevent the emancipation of the mind and the
 development of creativeness and subsequently they did not dare to think,
 speak and act.  For party members, the emancipation of their minds, the
 development of their creativeness, and their daring to think, speak and act
 should not deviate from the guidance of communist ideology.  If we separate
 emancipation of the mind, creativeness and daring to think, speak and act
 from Marxist theory, we shall be deviating from the principled stand of
 Communist Party members and shall invariably sink into the quagmire of
 bourgeois ideology.
 Historical lessons merit attention.   During the "Great Cultural Revolution,"
 the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques assumed the ultra-
 leftist outlook, or rather, came from the ultraleft to sabotage our party's
 communist movement, thereby greatly impairing the nature of our party as the
 vanguard force of the working class and the communist integrity of our party
 members.  Their pernicious influence is far from being completely wiped out
 and is corroding some people.  For example, they said that "when one is in
 power, one will have everything."  This viewpoint was very harmful.  Uphold-
 ing this wrong viewpoint, some people expressed the filthiest things in
 their innermost being by a theoretical form, so as to provide a "theoretical
 basis" for all their filthy activities which deviated from the principle of
 party spirit.  Incited by this wrong viewpoint,. some adventurers, speculators
 and dregs of society came from the top downward, from the bottom upward and
 from every direction to establish ties to seize power from the old revolu-
 tionaries, veteran cadres and party members.  Before the "Great Cultural
 Revolution," some comrades inside our party sometimes showed individualism
 but, more often than not, they told themselves that individualism was
 undesirable and, therefore, dared not show it to the party organization.
 However, during the "Great Cultural Revolution," abetted by the Lin Biao and
 Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques, individualism swelled to a serious
 extent.  If I do not like the look of you, I shall shove you to the ground;
 it is better for me to hold power than you; my faction will take a share
 proportionate to its strength; I want to hold open negotiations and have a

 showdown.  These deeds completely bared some people's filthy innermost
 being.  Even up to the present, some people regard anarchism and extreme
 individualism as something natural.  They regard them with pride instead of
 shame.  This historical lesson shows how important it is for party members
 and cadres to maintain their communist integrity.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP*Central Committee, a series of
 social policies have been adopted under new conditions.  For instance,
 externally, we have introduced the open policies of taking in foreign capi-
 tal, running joint ventures with foreign capital, processing materials for
 foreign businessmen, carrying out compensatory trade and conducting business
 in labor cooperation.  Internally, we have adopted flexible economic poli-
 cies.  For example, we will permit the various forms of economic undertakings
 and business management to exist for a long time under the precondition of
 giving absolute superiority to socialist public ownership; in the country-
 side, we have instituted various forms of the production responsibility
 system, developed a diversified economy, expanded the acreage of land for
 personal needs and opened trade fairs; in the cities and towns, we have
 carried out the economic responsibility system and developed the collective
 economy; with regard to financial policy, the localities are allowed to "eat
 in separate kitchens" and the enterprises are allowed to retain a portion of
 their profits and restore the bonus system; and many other social policies
 have been adopted.  Practice has proved that these policies are essential,
 correct and effective.  We must uphold these policies and make further
 efforts to implement and perfect them.  However, we should see that, due to
 domestic factors and international influence, class struggle still exists in
 China to a certain extent.  The present campaign against serious criminal
 activities in the economic field is an important manifestation of class
 struggle in the economic field.   Class enemies at home and abroad are trying
 by every possible means to sabotage our socialist modernization and disrupt
 our communist movement.  The criminals who engage in smuggling, trading in
 smuggled goods, giving and taking bribes, speculation and cheating, and who
 seek private gain at public expense and take forcible possession of state
 property, have gone to an unbearable extent in shamelessly devising all
 possible means to achieve their ends.  Capitalists make reckless moves in
 pursuit of profit; they dare to commit any crime, and even risk the gallows.
 What difference is there between capitalists like this and the elements in
 our country who commit serious crimes in the economic field?  Is there any
 socialist road in these people's minds?  Is there any communism there?  Is
 there any patriotism?  Is there any national dignity?  Is there any national
 and personal moral character?  There is not a trace of these things!
 The realities at present show more clearly that it is extremely important
 for party members to maintain their communist integrity.  To do so, they
 must carry out the struggle between the two fronts.  They must wipe out the
 pernicious influence of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing cliques and of the
 "leftist" ideas.  They must also combat bourgeois liberalization and par-
 ticularly at present combat corrosion by capitalist ideas.
 We must have all-round, clear understanding about the various aspects of the
 corrosion of the party organizations, party members and cadres.  As a whole,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 the CCP is good and has combat effectiveness.  During the period from the
 third plenary session to the sixth plenary session, we had already
 accomplished the historical task of setting the guiding ideology to rights,
 reiterated and established the Marxist ideological, political and organiza-
 tional lines, formulated and carried out a series of correct principles and
 policies for dealing with domestic and foreign affairs and won remarkable
 success.  The political maturity of our party--Central Committee and, in
 particular, its Marxist leadership level shown in the socialist moderniza-
 tion, which has been carried out according to the national conditions, have
 been recognized by all outside and inside the party and have attracted
 worldwide attention.  Our faith in this point should never waver.
 However, we should also see the other aspects.  First, communist ideology
 has weakened in varying degrees in the minds of a very few old party mem-
 bers and old cadres.                      As for some of them, their ideal of and faith in
 communism wavered because the party's guiding ideology had been erroneous
 for some time or because the state had met serious difficulties.  Others
 were poisoned by the fallacy that "power will be invalid after the speci-
 fied date" as professed by the "gang of four" so that after being reinstated,
 they forgot their original intention of fighting their whole lives for
 communism and became intent on seeking personal interests for their sons
 and daughters.  Second, the many young party members who joined during the
 "Great Cultural Revolution" lacked education in the basic knowledge of com-
 munism, and some of them joined the party as speculators.  These two con-
 ditions gave rise to some unsteady elements in our ranks of party members
 and party cadres.  Corruptive bourgeois ideology can be disseminated in the
 party through these unsteady elements.  Some of them have actually been hit
 by the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie and have taken the road to
 decadence and degeneracy.
 At present, our party is facing many new problems and new tasks in the
 ideological, political and organizational fields which we have to scrutinize
 and solve in the.light of communist ideology.
 Our party has been emphasizing the emancipation of the mind since the 3d
 plenary session of its 11th Central Committee.  Emancipation of the mind
 means making our thinking and understanding tally with objective reality.
 At that time, it was aimed mainly at shaking off the long-term yoke of
 "leftist" ideas, for our cause would not advance if this yoke were not
 removed.  The profound and lasting significance of the emancipation of the
 mind should in no way be underestimated.  At the moment, some people have
 not completely shaken off the yoke of "leftist" ideas.  Yet it should be
 soberly realized that at the same time corrosion by capitalist thinking is
 becoming increasingly serious.  This can be shown by the fact that the
 ideas of bourgeois liberalization have spread unchecked.  The Central Com-
 mittee of the party has always been explicit about the meaning of emanci-
 pation of the mind.  It has been clearly elucidated and repeatedly stressed
 in the relevant documents of the party Central Committee and the speeches
 delivered by leading comrades at the central level that emancipation of the
 mind means seeking truth from facts.  Yet, this slogan "emancipate the mind"
 has actually encountered boycott from the "left" and distortion from the
 right.

 In recent years, we have been increasingly expanding our academic exchanges
 with foreign countries.  We.have absorbed good managerial experience and
 advanced science and technology from other countries and have gained
 knowledge in academic fields from the outside world that we did not have
 in the past. We have widened our field of vision and have broadened our
 mental horizon.  This should be affirmed.  But, we must also admit that in
 the course of academic exchanges, certain comrades, due to lack of thorough
 understanding and study, are short of scientific analysis of certain
 foreign things.  Some people are writing articles. and making speeches
 blindly publicizing ideas which had already been 'criticized by Marx, Engels,
 Lenin and Stalin in their times.  Certain ideological trends which are in
 vogue in the West, such as existentialism, are viewed with much interest by
 some of our younger people.  Some young, people are indeed groping for
 knowledge, but in general they lack the theoretical preparation of Marxism.
 Because the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques had left
 our country in a terrible state, the socialist system was damaged, the
 party's image was impaired and the problems which were left behind could
 not be solved at one blow.  In this situation, the young people who lack the
 theoretical preparation of Marxism and do not know the histories of our
 party and state lost their confidence in Marxism and the socialist system.
 They felt that they had found a new way out once they contacted the Western
 ideological trends.  Therefore, if we are to uphold the party's correct
 principles on the ideological front, we should, while criticizing "leftist"
 things, adopt a Marxist attitude toward certain prevalent Western ideologi-
 cal trends, analytically point out their rational parts and make convincing
 criticism against the parts which are erroneous.
 The proletariat is the most revolutionary class and is the most adept in
 learning.  We must not only study Marxism but also learn from all foreign
 countries the things which are useful to us.  But the class and the people
 whom our party represents do not permit us to alter and weaken our party's
 nature as the vanguard force of the working class and our faith and trust
 in communism.  They do not permit the party members to be corroded by
 capitalist ideology.  On the contrary, they invariably demand that the party
 members preserve their communist integrity, that we uphold the party's
 fine traditions and that we persist in putting the communist thinking in a
 ruling position in the ideological sphere.                              '
 In the past 60 years and more, our party took a tortuous path many times and
 suffered defeats several times, but it continued to firmly carry out the
 historical tasks of the proletariat.  We won countless victories but we did
 not stand still after winning a victory.  Instead, we always marched forward
 to win a new victory.  In his article "The Situation and Tasks in the War of
 Resistance Against Japan After the Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan," Comrade
 Mao Zedong castigated class capitulationism and national capitulationism
 and pointed out that in one respect we should hold the ground we had already
 won, for this ground was our strategic point of departure, but our chief
 purpose was to extend the ground already won and to seize new ground.  It
 is precisely in this way that our cause and communist movement have always
 advanced step by step toward our great ideal.

 Let us read the "Report on the Review of the Program and on Changing the
 Name of the Party" which Lenin delivered to the Seventh Congress of the
 Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik).  This report is of great significance
 to us today in upholding the ideal of communism and communist thinking.  He
 called for making a clean break with the anarchists and with social-
 chauvinism in the Social Democratic Party.  He said:  "When the workers set
 up their own state they realized that the old concept of democracy--
 bourgeois democracy--had been surpassed in the process of the development of
 our revolution.  We have arrived at a type of democracy that has never
 existed anywhere in Western Europe."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 27,
 p 114)  That was to say, he. combined the resumption of the name of the
 Communist Party with a new type of democratic government which had been
 established.  We have called our party the Communist Party right from its
 inception.  We have already established a government under the people's
 democratic dictatorship.  There are conditions and it is necessary for us to
 distinctively put forth the question of holding high the banner of communism
 in the party.  The "resolution" adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the
 11th CCP Central Committee pointed out:  "Our present endeavor to build a
 modern socialist China constitutes but one stage of this great revolution.
 Differing from the revolutions before the overthrow of the system of exploi-
 tation, this revolution is carried out not through fierce class confronta-
 tion and conflict, but through the strength of the socialist system itself,
 under leadership, step by step and in an orderly way.  This revolution,
 which has entered the period of peaceful development, is more profound and
 arduous than any previous revolution and will not only take a very long
 historical period to accomplish but will also demand many generations of
 unswerving and disciplined hard work and heroic sacrifice.  In this histori-
 cal period of peaceful development, revolution can never be plain sailing.
 There are still overt and covert enemies and other saboteurs watching for
 opportunities to create trouble.  We must maintain high revolutionary
 vigilance and be ready at all times to come out boldly.to safeguard the
 interests of the revolution.  In this new historical period, the entire
 membership of the CCP and the entire people must never cease to cherish
 lofty revolutionary ideals, maintain a dynamic revolutionary fighting spirit
 and carry China's great socialist revolution and socialist construction
 through to the end."  We must adhere to this orientation pointed out by the
 "resolution"; adhering to this orientation means holding high the banner
 of communism.
 We hold high the banner of communism and uphold the communist integrity of
 party members.  But we certainly do not mean to immediately put into prac-
 tice the policies that will come with the advanced stage of communism.  In
 "On New Democracy," Comrade Mao Zedong said:  "Beyond all doubt, now is the
 time to spread communist ideas more widely and put more energy into the
 study of Marxism-Leninism, or otherwise we shall not only be unable to lead
 the Chinese revolution forward to the future stage of socialism, but shall
 also be unable to guide the present democratic revolution to victory.  How-
 ever, we must keep the spreading of communist ideas and propaganda about the
 communist social system distinct from the practical application of the new
 democratic program of action; we must also keep the communist theory and
 method of investigating problems, undertaking research, handling work and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 training cadres distinct from the new democratic line for national culture
 as a whole.  It is undoubtedly inappropriate to mix the two up."  ("Selected
 Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 2, p 666)  The conditions at present are entirely
 different from those at that time.  However, the principles which Mao Zedong
 talked about are still applicable.  We are now engaging in the socialist
 cause.  Being the first stage of communism, socialism should also be called
 communism.  There is of course a great difference between the present
 socialist system and the advanced stage of communism.  Moreover, we have
 adopted some social policies which comply with the actual situation.  For
 example, the individual economy is permitted to exist under the condition of
 putting public ownership in a position of absolute superiority; the indi-
 vidual economy of working people is an appendage and a necessary complement
 to the socialist economy.  These policies are not socialist in nature.  For
 this reason, on the one hand, we should uphold communist thinking and should
 not turn away from it even a little bit on the ground that certain social
 policies have been adopted; on the other hand, we should formulate policies
 under the guidance of communist thinking and in accordance with the actual
 situation and should not immediately put into practice the policies of the
 advanced stage of communism just for the sake of upholding communist think-
 ing.
 In short, all our members and cadres of the Communist Party must apply
 communist thinking in observing and dealing with all social problems.
 Actual life tells us that if we approach and carry out the party's policies
 under the guidance of communist thinking, we shall come to conditions and
 results greatly different from those which we may come to if we approach and
 carry out the party's policies by deviating from communist thinking.  To
 each of our party members and cadres, holding high the banner of communism
 means using communist thinking to guide and govern their words and deeds.
 Only thus will it be possible to maintain the communist integrity of our
 party and guarantee that our party's cause will continue to gain new develop-
 ments and win new victories.

 RECALLING A LETTER BY MAO Z~DONG
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 7-8
 [Article by Ouyang Shan [2962 7122 1472]]
 [Text]  In April 1944, Yu Xun and I were transferred from the third depart-
 ment of the Central Party School to the Association of Literary and Art
 Circles of the border area to take up literary writing.  Not long after-
 ward, Ding Ling and Chen Ming were also transferred there.  Ding Ling and
 I attended a conference of model collective workers of the border area.
 In the first coverage of what we had learned, she wrote a documentary
 article entitled "Tian Baolin" and I wrote a sketch entitled "Life in the
 New Society," both of which appeared in JIEFANG RIBAO on 30 June.  We
 could never have anticipated that these two short articles, reflecting two
 short profiles of the life of actual struggle. in the border area, which
 were so crudely written, would actually arouse the interest and attention
 of Comrade Mao Zedong, who at that time was shouldering the burden of lead-
 ing the struggle of the whole people.  After reading the articles, he
 immediately wrote us a congratulatory letter and also found time from his
 heavy schedule to meet us..  This spirit of not overlooking anything no
 matter how trifling for the sake of the people was indeed very touching.
 There is no doubt about the importance of the literary sketch.  It is terse
 and forceful, reflects things quickly and is full of militancy as well as
 having a mass character.  Like sketching in painting, it is a basic skill
 in the activity of creating literature and art which should not be under-
 estimated by those engaged in writing.  At present, some of the long,
 medium-length and short novels have tried their utmost to only piece
 together stories but have left the personalities of the characters pale
 and weak.  One of the. reasons for this is precisely the lack of this basic
 skill.  There were a great deal of sketches during the 1930's and 1940's,
 and they were welcomed by the masses.  Such a politician as Comrade Mao
 Zedong would of course advocate a certain form of literature beneficial to
 the people, but he might not necessarily have just had this point in mind.
 As for myself, this sketch "Life in the New Society" was written in 1941
 after my arrival in'Yan'an.  It was my first contact with the new society.,
 the new life and the new masters--the workers, peasants, soldiers and
 masses led by the proletariat.  At the same time, it was also my first

 attempt to use a certain literary form to portray, express and reflect
 them. It could be described as the first tentative step, exercise or
 attempt since throwing myself into the heat of the new struggle.  Despite
 the fact that the work was not mature but was very flimsy, it was neverthe-
 less on this major road.  Could it be possible that it was precisely on
 this point and on this point alone that Chairman Mao divided some of his
 valuable energy to affirm, support and encourage it?  I believed that this
 might be closer to his original intent.  In other words, what should be
 affirmed, supported and encouraged was not this short article itself, but
 a certain tendency, intent, path and orientation that it displayed.  It
 seemed as if he had earnestly said to me:  "Although you are not making much
 progress, your road is still correct."  To have the ability to see such
 profound significance from such an ordinary piece of writing--how great
 indeed was Comrade Mao Zedong's breadth of vision!
 True, in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," he brilliantly
 delineated a new era of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers for
 Chinese literature and art.  This was something known to everyone.  The
 reason he had been able to point out the orientation of serving the workers,
 peasants and soldiers was because this concrete fact that workers, peasants
 and soldiers were the masters of the new society already existed in the new
 society of that time.  Unfortunately, not all the young writers and artists
 in Yan'an knew this at that time, were in touch with this fact, conscien-
 tiously recognized this fact or were moved by this fact.  Therefore, they
 could not eliminate the feeling, which seems extremely ridiculous in today's
 light, of complaining of no opportunity to use their talent or blaming
 everyone and everything but themselves.  They walked up and down the sole
 fountainhead of literature and art.  I was also one of these young people.
 Naturally, after participating in the Yan'an forum on literature and art and
 following the great rectification movement, the situation began to change
 and I also started to move.  No one could have anticipated that after tak-
 ing the first step I would receive such serious attention and loving care.
 Each time I thought of Comrade Mao Zedong's letter, I felt a deep force
 spurring on and encouraging me.  I was only afraid that I might not give a
 good showing or might not produce presentable works for the masters of the
 new society, and could not help feeling deeply ashamed.
 In the last 40 years, a tremendous change has taken place in the actual
 life of the country.   The brilliant idea presented in "Talks at the Yan'an
 Forum on Literature and Art" has already withstood 40 years of rigorous
 tests in historical practice and has been confirmed as an immense and
 mighty truth.  At present, it has further developed from the orientation
 of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers to the even broader orienta-
 tion of serving the people and serving socialist society.
 Although there have been several setbacks in the development and prosperity
 of Chinese literature and art in the last 40 years, at the same time, they
 have also borne out the correctness of Mao Zedong's orientation for litera-
 ture and art.  Whenever literary and art works have been under the guidance
 of this correct orientation, definite achievements have been obtained.
 They have a certain vitality, are welcomed to a certain extent by the

 people and play to a certain extent the role of pushing forward the develop-
 ment of actual life.  On the other hand, if we adopt the erroneous "leftist"
 or rightist attitude of opposing, dissociating, avoiding and distorting
 this correct orientation, we would become devoid of accomplishments, become
 weak and incompetent, and would ultimately be defeated as well as spurned
 by the masses and ridiculed by history.  The several seething struggles,
 reflected by such things as giving priority to the main theme, giving
 prominence to three things and going in for high targets, large in size and
 complete in everything, absolute freedom, self-expression and egotism, have
 all suffered ignominous defeat.  All these are sufficient to prove the
 lamentable results of deviating from this correct orientation.  Every
 time I think of Comrade Mao Zedong's letter, all sorts of emotions well
 up in my mind.

 BE AN HONEST SPOKESMAN OF THE MASSES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 9-12
 [Article by Wei Jianlin [5898 1694 2651]]
 [Text]                                       I
 Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," as
 a product of combining the general truth of Marxism with the literary and
 art practice in China, and as a scientific summation of the new literary
 and art movement in'China and literary and art cause led by our party
 since the May 4 movement, deserves to be called a mature and typical work
 of Mao Zedong Thought on the problem of literature and art and the first
 programmatic document on our party's Marxist literary and art theories and
 policies.  This article expounds and proves in a practical way the nature,
 tasks and orientation of literature and art in China, their social and
 historical characters, as well as a series of problems and policies con-
 nected with them.  The great achievements of Chinese revolutionary litera-
 ture and art over the past few years or so have been made under the
 guidance of the'basic theories and principles put forth in the article.
 The relationship between writers and artists and the masses occupies an
 important position in these basic theories and principles.  Comrade Mao
 Zedong pointed out:  We should esteem specialists because they are very
 valuable to our cause.  "But we should tell them that no revolutionary
 writer or artist can do any meaningful work unless he is closely linked
 with the masses, gives expression to their thoughts and feelings, and
 serves them as a loyal spokesman."  This demand put forth by Comrade Mao
 Zedong should become the fundamental stand and starting point of all
 activities of all revolutionary writers and artists.
 Old China was economically and culturally backward.  To carry out revolu-
 tionary struggle with the ultimate goal of communism in such a country, we
 need the participation of intellectuals, including writers and artists, at
 every stage and step.  In accordance with the nature, historical tasks and
 guiding thought of the revolution led by the proletariat, and its profound
 and extensive development, we make incomparably strict demands on intellec-
 tuals.  They should become common members of the masses and must be good at
 consciously understanding, mastering, reflecting and upholding the immediate

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100290001-6
 and long-term interests of the masses and become their faithful representa-
 tives ideologically, theoretically and morally.
 More than one generation of Chinese writers and artists brought up by the
 "Talks" have acquired the good tradition of linking themselves closely with
 the masses.  Taking root among the masses, mastering the orientation of
 literary and art creation through the people's life and struggle, deriving
 creative power from literature and art, and bringing the role of literature
 and art into full play were from the beginning important Marxist theories
 on literature and art.  These principles have taken root in the Chinese
 literary and art movement since the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's
 "Talks" and have been systematically, comprehensively and accurately
 expounded and developed into theories through this article.  Over the past
 40 years or so, how our writers and artists identify themselves with the
 masses has determined the ideological and artistic success or failure of
 every one of their works.
 The times and social conditions in which the "Talks" was published were
 greatly different from those of today.  The life and demands of the people
 and their mutual relations, feelings, ideals and aesthetic purposes have
 also greatly changed.  Those writers and artists who are familiar with the
 people of the period of the new democratic revolution will not necessarily
 be able to create excellent works which are warmly welcomed by the people
 of the socialist era.  Those writers and artists who are familiar with the
 people of the period of the "Great Cultural Revolution" will not neces-
 sarily be able to correctly reflect the charming manner and varied spiritual
 life of the people who are carrying out socialist modernization.
 During the period of the "Talks" or even nowadays, we might encounter some
 phenomena that intentionally or unintentionally play down the importance
 of the masses and break away from them to varying degrees.  Comrade Mao
 Zedong explicitly pointed out:   "We must identify ourselves with the new
 masses without any hesitation." Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th
 CCP Central Committee, our party has resolutely corrected the "leftist"
 mistakes in guiding thought and hopes that writers and artists will further
 identify themselves with the masses of the new era.  It has adopted a num-
 ber of effective measures in this respect.  Only by integrating with the
 masses can writers and artists make their ideas constantly conform to the
 objective reality.  The more their ideas conform to objective reality, the
 more their ideas can represent the masses. Conversely, if the writers and
 artists are divorced from the masses and reality and only know some con-
 cepts from books, they will only be able to write literary works which tend
 to formularize and generalize even if their concepts are correct.  This is
 because they will not be able to fuse these concepts with their experience
 in life.  Although these works portray the lofty images of characters, it
 is difficult for them to affect the readers and touch their souls because
 they lack, after all, the rich flavor of life and artistic charm.  In works
 like this, it is better to say that writers and artists purely regard the
 images of characters as a bugle call rather than to say that the writers

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 and artists are the faithful representatives of the masses.  At the same
 time, if writers and artists, consider themselves superior to the masses,
 they will go astray.  For example, they will seek so-called "self-
 expression.," which is disconnected from the process of socialist moderniza-
 tion and the practice of the masses.  They will also completely separate
 popularization from the raising of standards, saying that they would rather
 write "Spring Snow" for a small number of people than "Song of the Rustic
 Poor" for the broad masses of people.  They will negate the correct slogan
 of "going deeply among workers, peasants and soldiers" by using the argu-
 ment that intellectuals have become part of the working class.  They will
 also be content to be familiar with a small number of the masses and will
 be unwilling to lay a broader foundation of life.  Frankly speaking, if
 these writers and artists do not change their minds, it will be difficult
 for them to. become honest spokesmen of the masses.
 Following are two problems that are closely related:
 1.  With regard to writers and artists, even if they have a wide range of
 life and acquire profound social and historical knowledge and are completely
 familiar with historical facts, the vividness of their descriptions cannot
 be compared with reality itself.   In other words, not all people of the
 different classes, strata and groups of society of different ages, sex,
 occupation and experience can be equally depicted by writers and artists
 with the same ideological and artistic skills.  A writer or artist might be
 more familiar with this or that part of the masses, or somewhat or com
 pletely unfamiliar with the rest of the people.  Such instances have fre-
 quently occurred in the history of literature and. art.  Therefore, in
 accordance with their personal experiences accumulated in life, writers
 and artists should concentrate their efforts on describing the life of a
 part of the masses in one or several of their works or in a certain period
 or in most of the creative activities in their life.  We should not blame
 them, because this will often become one of the conditions for establishing
 a unique style.  In recent years, we have had a number of writers and
 ,artists who are fairly familiar with the life of workers and peasants or
 intellectuals.  At the same time, we should also realize that if our writers
 and artists do not lay a broader foundation for their creative works and
 fail to master a certain aspect in life based on historical movements and
 broad social contacts, and if they remain content to "dig a well" in their
 personal narrow field of vision, it will be difficult to ensure that there
 will be an inexhaustible supply of water in their deep well and that they
 will successfully depict distinctive and appealing figures throbbing with
 the pulse  of our times based on their many-sided and flesh-and-blood con-
 tacts with practical life.  Under such circumstances, even if they are
 familiar with the subject matter of literary works, they might not be able
 to fully and effectively use it.  Going deeply among workers, peasants and
 soldiers does not mean that writers and artists should not be especially
 familiar with a certain subject matter and that they are not allowed to
 depict anyone except workers, peasants or soldiers.  Going deeply among
 workers, peasants and soldiers, first of all, means that writers and
 artists should think highly of the majority of laboring people in society,
 that they should not forget their interests and demands, and that they

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 should not depict other masses in an isolated way without keeping the
 majority of people in mind.  Writers and artists should not confine them-
 selves to a never-changing field.  They should constantly open up new
 fields for their creations and continuously dig new and deep wells.  All
 this should be done by writers and artists themselves.  At the same time,
 this is also an unavoidable demand put on them by the development of the
 literary and art cause.
 .2. The common and fundamental interests of the people of various nationali-
 ties in our country are to attain the magnificent goal of socialist mod-
 ernization under the leadership of the Communist Party.  Our writers and
 artists may select this or that kind of subject matter and depict this or
 that segment of the masses.  However, they are not allowed to abuse their
 freedom of creation by disregarding these fundamental interests and goals.
 Marxists always oppose the idea of regarding the masses as an "entity"
 without the slightest differences or inner contradictions and struggles.
 Even in the socialist society, this Marxist viewpoint is still of guiding
 significance.  Some of the masses are advanced, and others are in an inter-
 mediate or backward state.  Writers and artists should not downgrade them-
 selves to the level of the masses who are in an intermediate or backward
 state.  When depicting peasants, if they only take delight in talking about
 the selfish ideas of certain peasants or persist in appreciating the aloof-
 ness and arrogance of certain intellectuals without using literary and art
 means to help them raise their consciousness and make progress, these
 writers and artists will be far from meeting the historical demands of the
 broad masses of people, including the above-mentioned people.   .
 There is a misunderstanding:  It seems that once we stress that writers and
 artists must become honest spokesmen of the masses, we will, or are liable
 to, obliterate individual characters in their creations.  This view is
 wrong, because-people with this view fail to realize the close and dialec-
 tical relationship between the healthy and creative work of writers and
 artists and their status of being honest spokesmen of the masses.
 All fair-minded writers and artists devoted to their work have done their
 best to reflect the demands of the masses of their own times and strived to
 create individual characters in their literary works.  Their achievements
 and historical positions have been determined by their efforts in these two
 aspects.  The establishment of the socialist system, the guiding position of
 Marxist ideology, the coincidence of the basic interests of writers,
 artists with those of the broadest masses of people, and the development of
 literary and art history itself have provided. writers and artists with
 unprecedented and mature conditions so that they are able to combine and
 unify their efforts in the above-mentioned aspects of their creations.  The
 socialist reality, the historical and creative activities of the masses for
 the victory of the socialist cause, and their constantly increasing and
 rich spiritual life have helped writers and artists to open up a vast field
 for the development of individual characters in artistic creation and have
 also put strict demands on them.  The bourgeoisie has done everything

 possible to slander socialism as obliterating individual characters.  The
 "Communist Manifesto" replies to them in this way:  "By individual you mean
 no other person than the bourgeoisie, than the middle-class owner of
 property."  While sternly repudiating dogmatism, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed
 out:  Marxism resolutely destroys creative moods that are feudal, bourgeois,
 petit-bourgeois, liberalistic, individualist, nihilist, art-for-art's sake,
 aristocratic, decadent or pessimistic and every other creative mood that is
 alien to the masses of people and to the proletariat.  The tremendous con-
 structive force of socialism and Marxism lies in its efforts to bring up new
 people and establish new characters, new social relationships, new moral
 concepts and new aesthetic objectives based on public ownership.  This
 enables writers and artists. to truly attain a solid and practical basis to
 develop individual characters in their creations, a scientific cognitive
 base and a correct historical orientation.  In other words, being an honest
 spokesman in socialist literature and art means that writers and artists
 should constantly enhance their own artistic accomplishment and power of
 artistic revelation.  By so doing, they will continuously develop and
 enrich the specific characters in their creations.  Lenin said that over-
 simplified methods of repudiating individual creations and individual tastes,
 and mechanically advocating egalitarianism, uniformity and the practice of
 the minority being subordinate to the majority will eventually separate
 writers and artists from the masses.  However, there is another aspect to
 the problem.  In other words, we are not allowed to raise the issue of
 individual characters in creations-if we-depart from the basic principle of
 being an honest spokesman of the masses.  A writer was correct when he said:
 Writers should regard themselves as the "Echo Wall" of the world and dis-
 solve themselves in society and the masses.  If they are always preoccupied
 with their studies and rely on the weak sparks of inspiration which they
 themselves have struck, their thinking will dry up and their sparks of
 inspiration will die out.  In our times, if a writer or artist is unwilling
 to be an honest spokesman of the masses and madly clings to individual
 characters for his creations, which practice runs counter to the interests
 of the masses, it is unimaginable that he can create works which are recog-
 nized by society and which have an active influence on the practical, life of
 the masses.  In his "Talks," Comrade Mao Zedong failed to pay sufficient
 attention to the problem of individual characters in literary and art crea-
 tion.  This had an adverse effect on the development of literature and art
 during a certain period of time.  However, his inference concerning the
 relationship between literature and art and the people's life, the rela-
 tionship between popularization and the raising of standards, the problem
 of truthfulness and artistic quality of literature and art is very enlight-
 ening in finding a correct and overall solution to this problem.  Writers
 and artists should become honest spokesmen of the masses.  At the same time,
 they should develop individual characters in their creations.  The organic
 integration of their efforts devoted to these two aspects is not only a
 condensation of the basic experience and lessons of the development of
 modern literature and art in our country but also a historical characteristic
 of socialist literature and art.  This is where the vitality of our litera-
 ture and art lies, the vitality which promotes its healthy development and
 increasing enrichment.

 We should follow the slogan that literature and art should serve the people
 and society, which was put forth in accordance with the spirit of the third
 plenary session.  This slogan has been proved correct and has been whole-
 heartedly supported by the broad masses of writers, artists and people of
 the whole country.  One of the substantial aspects of this slogan is that
 writers and artists should be honest spokesmen of the masses.  In our times,
 the fate of the people is closely connected with socialism.  Without social-
 ism, there will be no happiness or prospects for the people.  Therefore,
 literature and art that serve socialism also serve the people.  Literature
 and art that serve the people can, in turn, be nothing but literature and
 art that serve socialism.  If literary and art works depart from the social-
 ist road, people will have a sufficient reason to discard them.  If lit-
 erature and art no longer serve the people, this means that their socialist
 .nature has completely changed.
 The reason we discuss the mutual relations of the two aspects of the slogan
 is that in practice some people have separated them to varying degrees and
 are not good at mastering their identity.  There were some literary works
 which were harmful to the consolidation and development of the socialist
 system and ran counter to the morals and habits of socialism under the sign-
 board of "pleading on the people's behalf."  We should know that under the
 new historical conditions, if we depart from the socialist road, we will
 completely violate the interests of the people.  If we put the laurel of
 "affility with the people" on literary works. which harm socialism, we will
 only distort and insult our people.  Only by acquiring a Marxist world out-
 look and making great efforts so that their literary works conform to prin-
 ciple of the party spirit can writers and artists faithfully represent the
 people.  For a long time in the past, we used the concept of "affinity with
 the people" in literature and art to explain certain literary and art
 phenomena.  It was understandable for us to do so.  However, we should on
 no account regard it as a principle of socialist literature and science.
 Socialist literature and art can only be guided by the Marxist world out-
 look and reflect the historical process in which human society will inevit-
 ably march toward socialism.  This kind of literature and art is also in
 accord with the principle of the party spirit of working class literature
 and art, and is a concentrated and generalized manifestation of the
 advanced nature of the working class.  In a socialist society, there is no
 such thing as an affinity with the people which departs from the party
 spirit or a so-called art and literature representing the people which runs
 counter to the party spirit.  Comrade Mao Zedong said:  "China's new culture
 at the present stage is an anti-imperialist, antifeudal culture of the
 masses of people under the leadership of the proletariat.  Today, anything
 that is truly of the masses must necessarily be led by the proletariat.
 Whatever is under the leadership of the bourgeoisie cannot possibly be of
 the masses.  Naturally, the same applies to the new literature and art
 which are part of the new culture."  To serve the people, literature and
 art should take the standpoint of the proletariat.  To socialist writers and
 artists who are determined to be honest spokesmen of the masses, this is the
 motto they should bear in mind all their life.

 ON EULOGY AND EXPOSURE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 13-16
 [Article by Ding Zhenhai [0002 2182 3189]]
 [Text]  Eulogy and exposure in literature and art is an old problem and
 also a new one.  The new historical situation has infused it with new con-
 tent and imposed new demands on it.  Correctly understanding and handling
 the relationship between eulogy and exposure in the course of molding our
 thinking on literature and art and in literary and artistic creation will
 play an extremely important role in bringing about greater prosperity in
 socialist literature and art.
 Literature and art in any era and of any class is a kind of spiritual
 creative activity which greatly affects the social life of mankind.  It
 performs the two social functions of eulogy and exposure.  The theory of
 Chinese classical literature always stressed "praise" and "satire," which
 actually meant eulogy and exposure.  Gorky said:  "The nature of art is
 the struggle between approval and opposition.  There is no, and cannot
 possibly be, art that is indifferent."  Eulogy and exposure supplement each
 other, and neither is indispensable.  This also applies to proletarian lit-
 erature and art.  Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out clearly:  "All reactionary
 forces harmful to the people must be exposed and all revolutionary struggles
 of the people must be eulogized.  This is the fundamental task of revolu-
 tionary writers and artists."  Here, it must be pointed out emphatically
 that the nature and scope of the two social functions of literature and art
 vary greatly in different historical periods and under different social
 systems.
 Marxists hold that the various social systems which appeared one after
 another in human history based their existence on certain historical condi
 Lions, and they comprised the stages of emergence, development and wither-
 ing.  During the period of development, there emerged some valuable lit-
 erary and artistic works which mainly played the role of eulogy and con-
 formed to the social system.  However, no matter how different they were in
 form, the various social systems which existed in recorded history prior to
 the establishment of the socialist system had one basic point in common,
 that is, the exploitation and oppression of the majority by the minority.
 For this reason, even during the period of development of the social

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 systems, the writers and artists who sided with the exploited classes and
 sympathized with them would express their discontent with the times and
 the society through their literary and artistic creations.  With the decline
 and decay of the system of exploitation, the function of exposure per-
 formed by literature and art became more and more important, and laying
 emphasis on exposure become the main stream of progressive literature and
 art.  No matter whether the writers and artists were aware of it or not,
 their works objectively played the role of denouncing the things which
 impeded the advance of history, arousing people's discontent with the
 system of exploitation and the realities in society, and stimulating the
 people to cherish the ideas and perform the deeds of changing the reali-
 ties.  Therefore, they had progressive historical significance.
 The conditions for literature and art are different during the socialist
 period.  The socialist period is an unprecedented, new historical period
 during which exploitation has been wiped out and the people are the masters
 of their country.  The newborn, beautiful things have occupied a more and
 more prominent position in daily life.  The development of realities in
 society have opened up boundlessly wide prospects for the people.  For this
 reason, as an important mark of progressive literature and art in the past
 centuries, the characteristic of being antagonistic to the times will
 invariably be replaced by a new type of relationship between literature and
 art on one side and the times on the other.  As a whole, emphasis is put on
 eulogy and "portrayal of the bright side."   This is an invariable historic
 change, brought about by the fundamental nature of the socialist system, to
 literature and art.  The viewpoints which hold that "writers and poets are
 discontented with the times in which they live" and that in revolutionary
 literature and art, eulogy and exposure "are equal in proportion" and "are
 on a par" are undoubtedly groundless*in fact and in theory.  It is certainly
 untrue to say that the socialist society is a paradise where there is only
 happiness and. brightness and there is no sorrow and darkness.  Brightness
 and darkness are correlative.  Lenin cited Hegels' words:  "In pure bright-
 ness, as in pure darkness, you can see nothing clearly."                       These words
 explain very clearly the dialectical relationship between brightness and
 darkness.  During the socialist period, compared with the former times,
 brightness and darkness have exchanged positions but there is still the
 dark side.  Moreover, as a thoroughgoing materialist class, the proletariat
 should be more adept in using literature and art as a weapon to expose and
 denounce all decadent and backward things, so as to continuously clear its
 road of advance.  In this sense, the party and the people affirmed the great
 number of revelatory works which appeared after the downfall of the "gang of
 four" and which portrayed the widening of the scope of the attack on right-
 ists, the "struggle against rightist deviations" and the decade-long turmoil.
 Comrade Hu Qiaomu pointed out in his article entitled "Several Current
 Questions on the Ideological Front," that "it is natural that a great num-
 ber of works on this theme have appeared in the past few years.  The over-
 whelming majority of writers created these works out of their sense of
 responsibility to history and the people and out of their revolutionary
 fervor.  On the whole, these works are beneficial and play a positive role
 in gaining a clear understanding of history, criticizing the 'leftist'
 errors, exposing the crimes of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolu-
 tionary cliques and portraying the brave fights put up by the party members

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 and the masses who took a correct stand."  However, it should also be seen
 that the emergence of the great number of revelatory works in the past few
 years is only a short-lived, special historical phenomenon.  The reason is
 that, in the long historical course of socialist revolution and construc-
 tion, the widening of the scope of the attack on rightists, the mistake
 of the "struggle against rightist deviations" and even the decade-long
 turmoil and other comprehensive, long-drawn-out and grave "leftist" blunders
 are only short-lived episodes and backwash.  They cannot change the basic
 fact that, on the whole, the bright side is greater than the dark side.
 While affirming the ideological significance and social function of these
 revelatory works and putting them in an appropriate historical position,
 we should not forget the still more important task and function of s9cial-
 ist literature and art, that is, "all revolutionary struggles of the people
 must be eulogized."  Moreover, the wheel of history is rolling forward
 speedily.  Countless facts since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP
 Central Committee have eloquently proved that our party has all the abili-
 ties to rely on the superiority of the socialist system and its own strength
 to correct the past mistakes and to get back onto the path to healthy
 development.  The important purpose of the "Resolution on Certain Questions
 in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC" adopted by the
 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee was to bid farewell
 to the past mistakes so that the whole party and the people of the whole
 country would work concertedly to build their socialist country.  As a
 matter of fact, scenes of people fighting to build a new life for them-
 selves are being unfolded ever more vigorously and spectacularly before our
 writers and artists.  In the face of the new situation and new prospects,
 if they are given excessively,to sad memories and feelings of the past,
 their wide field of vision will be dimmed by their bewilderment and they
 will be unable to correctly understand and reflect the new look of the
 people's militant life during the new period.  They will be unable to make
 literature and art play the glorious role as an advocate of the times and
 a guide of everyday life.  Precisely for this reason, in his speech Comrade
 Hu Qiaomu time and again expressed "the hope that writers and artists all
 over the country will shift the focus of their creative activities to the
 current struggle of building a new life for the people."
 Correctly solving the question of shifting the focus of current literary and
 artistic creation will inevitably involve the selection and expression of
 subject matter.  The "gang of four" wantonly criticized the "opposition to
 the theory that 'subject matter is the decisive matter."'  It mapped out
 various "forbidden zones" of subject matter, thereby not only fettering the
 the writers but also negating the role played by a writer's world outlook
 in guiding his creation (we may as well leave alone the special meaning of
 what they called "important subject matter").  Is it, on the other hand,
 correct to say that "subject matter does not make any difference"?  No, it
 is incorrect.  The reason is that the various things, personalities and
 phenomena in everyday life are different in social nature and have different
 objective meanings.  They occupy different positions and play different roles
 in social life.  Reflected in literary and artistic works,, they naturally
 will have different ideological contents and aesthetic values.  In the
 socialist period, newborn and progressive things always express more

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 directly the nature of society and the trends of historical development.
 For this reason, generally speaking, if the ideological and artistic levels
 remain unchanged, subject matter reflecting seething new life has greater
 social significance than other subject matter which reflects the passive
 aspects of society.  It creates greater possibilities for the writer to
 reveal the nature of social life as a whole and the stirring scenes of the
 times.  Subject matter involving the widening of the scope of the attack on
 rightists, the "struggle against rightist deviations" and the decade-long
 turmoil will certainly have unique ideological value and educational mean-
 ing if the writers depict them by standing on a high plane.  However, com-
 pared with other subject matter reflecting the new struggle to realize
 socialist modernization, this subject matter has limited content and there-
 fore cannot fulfill the tasks of directly reflecting the new times and
 eulogizing the new personalities.  Furthermore, if the works on this sub-
 ject matter form the main stream of literary and artistic creation and long
 prevail in the sphere of literature and art during the new period, then our
 literature and art cannot reflect very well the nature and full view of
 social life in the new period of socialist construction.  Neither will they
 conform with the spiritual needs of the people fighting bravely to build a
 powerful modern socialist country.  Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out in his
 "Speech at the Forum on Playwriting" that "generally speaking, if literature
 and art only or always reflect the backward and dark aspects, I feel that
 they cannot fully and accurately reflect the nature of our society and will
 not conform with the facts of society as a whole."  Applying the basic
 principles of historical materialism and proceeding from the interrelation-
 ship between the general outlook of socialist literature and art and the
 facts of socialist society as a whole, this thesis has elucidated the
 important meaning of the progressive, bright things in our society.
 Of course, the selection of subject matter is not the most important thing
 in determining whether a piece of literary and artistic work is successful.
 A more important thing is whether the ideological contents and aesthetic
 values of the subject matter have been fully revealed and raised to a higher
 level.  "Be strict in selecting subject matter"--this is of course an impor-
 tant link.  But the key is that "the subject matter.-. must be revealed to a
 great depth."  Lu Xun said this very well:  "In my opinion, the basic ques-
 tion is whether the author is a 'revolutionary.'  If he is, his writing is
 'revolutionary literature,' whatever incident he portrays and whatever
 material he uses."  In a speech on the conditions and questions concerning
 literary and artistic creation in the past few years, Comrade Hu Qiaomu
 specifically expounded the decisive role played by the correct stand and
 world outlook of writers and artists in depicting subject matter of various
 kinds.
 First, being a socialist writer, it is necessary to "uphold the correct
 stand" and produce works "with a high sense of responsibility toward history
 and the people."  The practice in literary and artistic creation over the
 past few years shows that when a writer or an artist produces his works with
 a sense of responsibility toward socialism, whether he eulogizes or. exposes
 things, his works can directly or indirectly play an active role in promoting
 the unity of the whole party, the whole army and the people of all

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100290001-6
 nationalities in the modernization drive.  On the contrary, if he does not
 uphold a correct stand, does not cherish a correct feeling or just produces
 literary works for private gain, no matter what he has written, either
 "what a splendid scene it is with the water flowing in the river, with the
 beautiful lotus in the green ponds and with the bright sun shining high
 above in the sky" under the pretext of "eulogy," or "being infatuated with
 pretty girls".and "being sunk in deep thought on their charming smiles"
 under the pretext of "exposure," his work has departed from the socialist
 road.  There are still other writers who really want to "serve the nation
 and the people" and have expressed in their works the strong feeling of
 detesting the dark side of the world.  However, as they are not armed with
 Marxist ideology, they are unable to criticize the unhealthy practices from
 the higher plane of scientific socialism and the proletarian party spirit.
 Instead, they criticize them by means of wrong methods, such as, "combating
 poison with poison" and "combating errors with errors."  As a result, while
 combating unhealthy tendencies such as privilege and bureaucratism, some
 other unhealthy ideologies and practices, such as individualism, nihilism
 and anarchism, are propagated intentionally or unintentionally.  There
 obviously exists contradictions between the writers' intentions in creation
 and the actual results of their literary works.  All this shows that a cor-
 rect. stand or world outlook`is essential for finding a fundamental solution
 to the problem of eulogy and exposure.
 Second, it is necessary for a socialist writer to uphold dialectical mate-
 rialism in observing and reflecting our real life and to oppose meta-
 physics.  Of course, when writing about the construction of the new life,
 emphasis should be put on the depiction of the epic deeds of the hundreds
 of millions of people in advancing toward socialist modernization and on
 the eulogizing of the pioneers of the new era.  But this depiction or
 eulogy does not mean evading difficulties, contradictions and struggles in
 real life.  We advocate the depiction of socialist new people in the new
 period of socialism.  This has nothing in common with the theory of "no
 conflicts" which appeared in the literary and art work several times in the
 past.  Moreover, we must point out that what we are undertaking now, in the
 realization of the socialist modernizations, is an unprecedentedly great and
 profound revolution.  In order to build a high degree of socialist material
 and spiritual civilization, we must not only transform and conquer nature
 in an unprecedented fighting manner, but also penetratingly carry out
 reforms in the economic, political, ideological and cultural fields as well
 as in all spheres of the social life.  We must not only continue to clear
 away the remnants of feudal ideology, but must also guard against and resist
 corruption by bourgeois ideology.  On our road of advance, there are contra-
 dictions and struggles everywhere and every step of our advance is a great
 effort.  Those "no conflict" works cannot truly and penetratingly reflect
 our socialist new period and will be proved to be short of artistic
 vitality.  This is just as Comrade Hu Qiaomu said:  "We hope our writers
 will lay more stress on depicting the present struggles of the people in
 building their new life.  However,. this does not mean advocating the eulogy
 of peace and ease of our life, still less does it mean advocating senti-
 mental works.  In the past, at present and in the future, the road to
 building a new life has always been and will continue to be uneven.  This

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 is a very complicated, arduous and great struggle which concerns every
 aspect of the people's life and will go on for a long period of time.
 Only by conquering various difficulties and obstacles in the human world
 and in nature can it advance forward.  The true, the good and the beautiful
 exist in opposition to the false, the bad and the ugly and develop in the
 struggle against them.  Therefore, in the narrative works, which'are com-
 paratively more complicated, eulogy and exposure usually, and inevitably,
 appear at the same time.   (This refers to the interrelationship between the
 former and the latter, and does not mean that the role of literature and
 art is limited to eulogy and exposure.)"  Whether in modern or ancient
 times, in China or elsewhere, the development of literature and art shows
 that in good literary and artistic works, which depict social life more
 penetratingly and extensively and have more artistic charm, eulogy and.
 exposure are generally more closely combined.  The famous Chinese classics,
 such as the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "The Dream of
 the Red Chamber," the "Western Chamber," "The Mudan Pavilion" and so forth,
 and the foreign classics, such as the works of Balzac, Hugo, Tolstoy,
 Chekhov and Romain Rolland, are good examples of this.  In recent years,
 some modern novels depicting the construction of industrial modernization,
 such as "Factory Manager Qiao's Assumption of Office," "Thirty Million"
 and "Descendent of the Dragon," are also inspiring and have made a deep
 impression on readers.  This is because the characters of the pioneers in
 the new period, whom the writers have portrayed and eulogized with concen-
 trated effort, were placed in conflict situations of complicated contradic-
 tions and in the struggles against various conventional ideas and conserva-
 tive forces which obstruct the advance of the modernization drive.  They have
 comparatively more truly reflected the profoundness and arduousness of the
 recent economic reforms.  In these works, which reflect the struggles in
 the building of a new life, eulogy and exposure are better connected.  We
 must affirm the successful experience of these works.
 When creating literary and artistic works to reflect the socialist con-
 struction in the new period, while laying stress on eulogy, the writers
 must also pay attention to the depiction of contradictions and struggles as
 well as shortcomings and disadvantages.  They must avoid merely singing the
 praises of the bright side.  On the other hand, when creating works to
 expose the mistakes in magnifying the scope of the antirightist struggle,
 and mistakes in the struggle against right deviation and in the 10 years of
 disorder, it is all the more necessary to avoid writing about the dark side
 only.  Otherwise, the organic unity of eulogy and exposure will be damaged
 and one-sidedness will occur.  As a matter of fact, even during the 10
 years of disorder, when the party and the people were suffering from the
 greatest disaster since liberation, there still widely existed positive
 and good things in our life.  Within the party or among the people, the
 struggle against the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques
 and the struggle to resist the "leftist" errors never stopped.  Just as
 was pointed out in the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of
 Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC":  "The party, the people's polit-
 ical power, the people's army and the nature of our society have remained
 unchanged."  Unfortunately, in a number of literary and artistic works
 which have stressed exposure and depicted the happenings in the 10 years

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 of disorder, these extremely important and abundant aspects in our social
 history were not reflected or were not fully reflected.  In other words,
 in these works, exposure is not dialectically related with eulogy.  No
 wonder they are dull and have a low ideological level.  Some of them have
 eiien produced bad social results due to the mistakes in ideology and art.
 In his speech, Comrade Hu Qiaomu particularly pointed out that when taking
 the dark side of things in history, or in our real life as the main theme,
 "it is necessary to take the overall situation, the mainstream and the
 future into consideration" and "take a positive attitude toward the future
 of the party and the people and the future of socialist China."  This
 requires our writers and artists to adopt the principle of revolutionary
 realism in their creative work and relate the depiction of reality with its
 revolutionary development, relate the. depiction of the dark side of things
 with the overall situation of the entire society and connections in history,
 and expose the "illegality" and "temporary nature" of the existence and
 rampancy of the bad things and the historical inevitability of their being
 replaced by bright and progressive things.  As the dark side of things and
 the decadent forces are minor aspects in the history of socialist revolu-
 tion and socialist construction, their existence and development are always
 restricted by the overall situation of social life and are influenced by the
 bright side of things. and the revolutionary forces, which are in the domi-
 nant position.  Therefore, when we faithfully and penetratingly depict how
 the dark side of things and decadent forces are restricted and influenced by
 the bright side of things and the revolutionary forces and how they are
 related with other things, we can also bring to light the trend of develop-
 ment in society through the development and changes in the dark side of
 things.  At the same time, the writers and artists can also express their
 correct social mentality and aesthetic standards through exposing and
 criticizing these ugly things.  Thus, even when a tragedy is written, it
 can also give people strength; even when the "exposure of darkness" is taken
 as the theme, it still can point out a correct road for the people, display
 a bright future and boost people's courage and heighten their confidence on
 the road of advance.

 in formulating or revising its constitution.  This goes without saying.
 What is the fundamental guiding ideology for "the draft of the revised
 constitution of the People's Republic of China" that the 23d Session of the
 5th NPC Standing Committee decided to promulgate?  In the preamble of the
 constitution, it was clearly pointed out:  "Under the leadership of the
 Chinese Communist Party and under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao
 Zedong Thought, the Chinese people will continue to uphold the people's
 democratic dictatorship, to uphold the socialist road, to improve various
 socialist systems, to develop socialist democracy, to round out the social-
 ist legal system, to seek rejuvenation through self-reliance, to fight amid
 hardship, and to gradually build our country into a highly democratic and
 highly civilized socialist country with modernized industry, modernized
 agriculture, modernized national defense and modernized science and tech-
 nology."  The four opening lines here, or the four basic principles repre-
 sent the fundamental guiding ideology followed in revising the constitution
 this time, and also the basic principles that our country must follow.
 The four basic principles put forth are not the subjective wish of any
 individual.  Instead, they represent the sum of the experiences of our
 people in a long period of revolutionary struggle under the leadership of
 the party and are the embodiment of objective laws governing the develop-
 ment of the history of our country.  The "draft of the revised constitu-
 tion" points out:  "After 1840 feudal China gradually shaped up into a
 semicolonial and semifeudal country.  The Chinese people kept fighting in a
 brave struggle for national independence,. for national liberation and for
 democratic freedom." For over 100 years, on the scene of Chinese political
 struggle, various political forces successively staged their own per-
 formances and showed their own powers, to different degrees.  Men of
 insight bent on reform put forth various programs to save the country and
 the people.  Some called for the conduct of education to enlighten the
 people.  Some urged the advocation of science to save the country.  Some
 also called for the use of force to overthrow tyrants.  Of all the ideas

 advanced, there was really no lack of relatively, good ones.  But before
 Marxism-Leninism reached China and before the birth of the Chinese Com-
 munist Party, there was not an.idea that could show us a fundamental road
 to thorough liberation for the Chinese people.  Given the conditions of
 China, only socialism was capable of arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm
 of the masses of hardworking people.  Only by using the Communist Party,
 the vanguard of the proletariat armed with Marxism-Leninism, could we
 organize the proletariat and all the people in waging a thorough anti-
 imperialist and antifeudal struggle.                           Only in this way could we, after the
 victory of the democratic revolution, immediately lead China toward social-
 ism.              Such was the fact.  Once Marxism-Leninism reached China and the
 Chinese Communist Party appeared on the Chinese political scene, 'a turn of
 the tide came in the Chinese revolution.  With its correct revolutionary
 program, the Chinese Communist Party won the support and trust of people of
 all walks of life in the country.  A new situation appeared in the revolu-
 tion.  Just as the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of the
 Party Since the Founding of the PRC" adopted at the 6th Plenary Session of
 the 11th CCP Central Committee pointed out:  "The then Kuomintang, or other
 bourgeois and petit bourgeois political factions, did not and could not
 possibly find a way out for the country and the people.  Only the Chinese
 Communist Party showed the people the way out for China.  The way out was
 to thoroughly overthrow imperialist and feudalist reactionary rule and
 switch over to socialism."  History of over 100 years has proved an
 imperishable truth:  The four basic principles, which accord with the
 desire of several generations. of people in China and reflect the laws of
 historical development independent of human will, are a fundamental guaran-
 tee for the Chinese people's turning our state into a highly democratic and
 highly civilized powerful and modern socialist country.  Therefore, in
 formulating and revising the constitution, we can in no way deviate from
 the four basic principles.  Whether we uphold or oppose the four basic prin-
 ciples and whether we uphold them properly--this concerns the nature and
 orientation of development of the state's political, economic and cultural
 systems, concerns the relations among various classes, among various
 nationalities and among various political forces of the state, and also
 concerns the role, effectiveness and dignity of the constitution itself.
 In this regard, we have both positive and negative experiences for refer-
 ence.
 Since the founding of the PRC, we have promulgated three constitutions.
 The 1954 constitution was a relatively good one.  1) It summed  up and
 affirmed the experiences of the new democratic revolution led by the
 Chinese Communist Party and consolidated the results of the revolution of
 our people and the new victories scored in the political and economic
 fields since the founding of the PRC.  2) It prescribed the state system of
 the People's Republic of China as "a people's democratic state led by the
 working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance."  3) Based on the
 principle of integrating Marxism-Leninism with the practice of China, it
 objectively analyzed the main contradictions in Chinese society and put
 forth the main tasks for the transitional period of the state in light of
 the fundamental demands during the transitional period of the state and
 the common wishes of the masses of people in building socialism.  The main

 tasks called for "gradually realizing the socialist industrialization of
 the state and gradually accomplishing the socialist transformation of agri-
 culture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce."  In a word, the
 1954 constitution embodied four basic principles, defined a socialist road
 compatible with the features of China, ensured the smooth socialist trans-
 formation of the system of private ownership of the means of production,
 stimulated the development of industry, agriculture and the whole national
 economy, and laid a material foundation for our modernization effort today.
 The constitution promulgated in 1975 during the "Great Cultural Revolution"
 abandoned some basic principles of the 1954 constitution and embodied the
 guiding ideology of so-called "continuous revolution under the dictatorship
 of the proletariat."  The main problems with this constitution were:  1) It
 affirmed wrong "leftist" viewpoints--which clearly deviated from the orbit
 of Mao Zedong Thought--as Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, thus creating
 confusion about the guiding ideology for the whole country.  2) Contradic-
 tions of two different types were seriously confused.  The dictatorship of
 the proletariat was interpreted as "overall dictatorship."  The article,
 "The Proletariat Must Exercise Overall Dictatorship Over the Bourgeoisie in
 the Superstructure Covering All Fields of Culture," was put forth, under-
 mining socialist democracy.  3) The "leftist" economic policy was used to
 replace the socialist economic policy consistently upheld by our country..
 4) Regional revolutionary committees at various levels practicing the
 party's "centralized leadership" were affirmed, creating a chaotic state in
 which the party was not separated from the government in the state system
 and the latter was replaced by the former.  The party was thus turned from
 a leader in the social and political life of the state into something that
 directly interferes and that directly takes charge.  This constitution put
 in the form of law many erroneous theories and erroneous practices related
 to the "Great Cultural Revolution," causing damage to the state in the
 political, economic and cultural fields and providing a handful of career-
 ists and conspirators with a legal basis for usurping party and state
 leadership.  After the 4th NPC, the forces of the "gang of four" counter-
 revolutionary conspiratorial group were strengthened not only in the party
 but in the government, not only at central but at regional levels.  This
 was a serious consequence of the 1975 constitution, which negated the 1954
 constitution, which deviated from the four basic principles and which
 followed wrong guiding ideology.
 The 1978 constitution was formulated after the downfall of the "gang of
 four."  But due to the limitations of the then prevailing historical fac-
 tors, it failed to give up the erroneous theories, policies and slogans
 embodied in the 1975 constitution.  Though some ingredients of the four
 modernizations program were added to it as guiding ideology, the theory of
 "continuous revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" remained
 as its basis.  It is clear that this constitution has in many places become
 incompatible with the needs of our political and economic life and the
 needs of the building of a modern state and must be revised.
 Different guiding ideas produce different constitutions and different
 consequences and effects in state political life.  The 1954 constitution

 embodied in a relatively satisfactory way the four basic principles and
 accorded with the interests and aspirations of the people of the whole
 country.  It won the wholehearted support of the people of the whole
 country and gave full expression to the dignity of the constitution.  The
 later two constitutions, and the 1975 one in particular, impaired the
 dignity of the constitution, due to their being divorced from the four basic
 principles, to different degrees.  We must seriously take this as a profound
 lesson.
 The 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee marked an end to
 the situation of party work advancing in a period of hesitation and indeci-
 sion and the beginning of an overall and serious rectification of "leftist"
 mistakes noticed during the "Great Cultural Revolution" and before.  The
 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee adopted the "Resolu-
 tion on Certain Questions in the History of the Party Since the Founding of
 the PRC" and reaffirmed the need to continuously uphold the four basic prin-
 ciples.  This paved the way for our revising the constitution and putting
 the business of revising the constitution again on a very reliable and
 solid foundation.
 We know that in upholding the four basic principles, the most important
 thing is to adhere to the two calling for the socialist road and party
 leadership.  Upholding the socialist road and upholding party leadership
 are two aspects of one thing.  In upholding the socialist road, we must
 uphold party leadership.  Whether we have upheld party leadership, or
 whether we have done this well depends on whether we have upheld the
 socialist road.  In the articles in the 1975 constitution and the 1978 con-
 stitution (especially the former), there appeared many terms about "party
 leadership" and "socialism."  But prompted by-erroneous guiding ideology,
 these articles were permeated with the erroneous theory of "continuous
 revolution under the. dictatorship of the proletariat."  This basically
 violated the rights of the people and undermined the foundation of the
 people's democratic dictatorship, confronting us with the danger of our
 country's deviating from the socialist road in. political, economic, cul-
 tural and other fields.  This actually weakened the party's leading posi-
 tion in state life, basically running counter to the four basic principles.
 Now, though the "draft of the revised constitution" just mentions the four
 basic principles in its preamble, it has clearly defined our socialist
 system and people's democratic dictatorship as the state's fundamental
 system.  Based on this system, it has prescribed our economic system and
 cultural system, set forth criteria for the proper handling of relations
 among various political bodies, among various mass organizations and among
 various nationalities and stipulated the composition of people's congresses
 and people's governments at all levels.  This enables the spirit of the
 fundamental state system to run through.all the articles in the "draft of
 the revised constitution" and forms the basis for the formulation of all
 other systems, ensuring that the political life, economic life and cultural
 life of the state always advance along a socialist orbit.  Meanwhile, the
 draft has drawn lessons from the 1975 and 1978 constitutions.  In line with
 the "resolution" of the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Com-
 mittee and with the spirit of the party Central Committee's instructions on

 the reform of state organs, it has put forth reform measures for separating
 the party from the government and defined the premier responsibility system
 .of the State Council, the responsibility system involving ministers and the
 various forms of,socialist responsibility.  In the form of general laws,
 this has affirmed the results of the reform of state organs and the economic
 system, allowing the improvement and strengthening of the party's leading
 position in state life.
 The "draft of the revised cons.titution" clearly stipulates that the Chinese
 people will uphold the :four basic principles.  This means that every citi-
 zen of the People's Republic of China must uphold the four basic prin-
 ciples.  These principles?cannot-be deviated from or abandoned, still less
 opposed.  If anyone opposes the upholding of the four basic principles as
 the guiding ideology for our country and even brings in guiding ideology of
 any kind then he has acted?against~the laws of historical development and
 against the will of the whole people.
 The party has led the people in formulating the constitution.  The party
 will also lead the people in observing the constitution.  Once the consti-
 tution is approved, .all citizens, public organizations, units, and parties
 and groups, including the Chinese Communist Party, must observe it.  Every
 member of the Chinese Communist.Party is not only a member of the party
 organizations but also a citizen of the People's Republic?of China.  Like
 every citizen, he must do his part in observing the constitution.  In this
 regard, no Communist Party member should be allowed to be a privileged
 citizen.  Whether a-Communist Party member upholds the four basic-principles
 depends on whether he really observes the constitution and consciously
 upholds the dignity,of the ?cons-titution.
 Upholding the four basic principles is the fundamental guiding ideology for
 the current revision of the constitution.  They should also become the
 guiding ideology for the launching of an all-people campaign to discuss the
 "draft of.the revised constitution."  Every citizen of the country must
 take this guiding ideology as a basis, air his own views on the revision of
 the constitution, and speak freely, enabling the four basic principles to be
 better embodied in the constitution as guiding ideology.

 THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS SYSTEM IS OUR COUNTRY'S BASIC POLITICAL SYSTEM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 20-24
 [Article by Wang Shuwen [3769 0647 2426]]
 [Text] In light of the historical experience in building political power
 in our country and based on the needs of the construction of the four mod-
 ernizations, the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee laid
 down a guideline in the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of
 Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC."  This guideline made it clear
 that "it is necessary to strengthen the building of state organs at all
 levels in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, make the
 people's congresses at all levels and their permanent organs authoritative
 organs of the people's political power, gradually realize direct popular
 participation in the democratic process at the grassroots of political
 power and community life and, in particular, stress democratic management
 by the working masses in urban and rural enterprises over the affairs of
 their establishments."  In accordance with this basic spirit, great impor-
 tance has been attached to the strengthening and amplification of the
 system of people's congress, and many new and important stipulations have
 been made in the revised draft of the constitution of the PRC.  In this
 new revised draft, we can find many considerable amendments to the 1978
 constitution, as well as some remarkable improvements of the 1954 constitu-
 tion.
 The Stipulations Concerning the People's Congress System in the Revised
 Draft Give Free Rein to the Principle of Democratic Centralism
 Democratic centralism is the basic principle to be constantly adhered to in
 the political system of a socialist country, as well as the hallmark dis-
 tinguishing the latter from the political systems of all exploiting class
 states.  Based on the summarization of the Paris Commune experience, Marx
 expounded long ago, in "The Civil War in France," the basic principles of
 the political system of a proletarian state.  He said, "The commune was
 formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by universal suffrage in the
 various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at short terms.  The
 majority of its members were naturally working men, or acknowledged repre-
 sentatives of the working class.  The commune was to be a working body, not
 a parliamentary body, executive and legislative at the same time."

 ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 2, p 375)  In "The State and
 Revolution," Lenin discussed these principles in detail.  He pointed out
 that only in carrying out these principles can we replace bourgeois
 democracy with socialist democracy, ensure control. over the state by the
 broad masses of people, and consolidate proletarian state power.  Our
 country's constitution has invariably provided that all state power belongs
 to the people; the organs through which the people exercise the power are
 people's congresses at different levels; and all people's congresses and
 other state organs must carry out democratic centralism.  The principle of
 democratic centralism has been made an individual article (Article 3) in
 the revised draft of the constitution.  It provided that "our state organs
 adopt the principle of democratic centralism."  This is one of the charac-
 teristics of the revised draft of the constitution.  Furthermore, with
 regard to the basic content of democratic centralism, the draft has also
 given an explanation in the following three aspects according to the basic
 principles of Marxism-Leninism and the actual practice in our country; and
 tried to embody the principle as fully as possible in every article govern-
 ing the organization and the activities of the state organs concerned.
 First, the NPC and the local people's congresses at different levels are
 formed by means of democratic elections.  All people's congresses are
 responsible to the people and subject to the supervision of the people.
 The revised draft of the constitution provides that the people's congresses
 at all levels throughout the country are formed by means of democratic elec-
 tion.  According to statistics compiled during the 1981 nationwide general
 election, the voters accounted for more than 99.9 percent of the citizens
 over 18 years of age.  The people's congresses at different levels, which
 are formed by means of election on the basis of extensive democracy, can
 truly exercise state power on behalf of the people.  At the same time, as
 provided in the revised draft, the NPC and all local people's congresses at
 different levels are subject to the supervision of the units and voters who
 elected them; and the latter have the right to replace, at any time, accord-
 ing to the procedure prescribed by law, any deputy whom they have elected.
 This ensures that all deputies will take the initiative in abiding by the
 constitution and law and will proceed in all cases from the interests and
 the will of the broad masses of people.  The above stipulation fully shows
 that the people's congresses at all levels in our country are the people's
 representative organs and are of a highly democratic nature.
 Second, all state administrative organs and all judicial and procuratorial
 organs are originated by the organs of.state power to which they are
 responsible and to whose supervision they are subject.  As provided by the
 revised draft, the NPC is the highest organ of state power, and its
 permanent organ is the NPC Standing Committee.  It exercises legislative
 authority in the country, carries out discussions and makes decisions on'
 issues of nationwide importance.  The local people's congresses at various
 levels are local organs of state power.' Standing committees are estab-
 lished in the local people's congresses at and above the county level.
 They carry out discussions and make decisions on important issues concern-
 ing their respective administrative areas.  All state administrative organs,
 judicial organs and procuratorial organs at various levels are originated

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 by organs of state power at various levels to which they are responsible
 and to whose supervision they are subject.  This implies that all other
 state organs which are originated by people's congresses can never go
 against the will of the latter.  All the above stipulations show that the
 people's congresses at various levels are the organs which truly exercise
 state power, and have the right to carry out discussions on important issues
 in the state's political life, to make relevant decisions and to supervise
 the implementation of these decisions.  Therefore, through the people's
 congress system, the people can exercise state power in a centralized and
 unified way.
 Third, the division of functions and power between the central and local
 state institutions shall conform to the principle of giving full play to
 the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under-the unified
 leadership of the central authorities.  This stipulation of the revised
 draft correctly links the centralized and unified leadership of the central
 authorities with the goal of giving full play to the initiative and
 enthusiasm of the local authorities; furthermore, it reflects such a spirit
 in many articles of the constitution.
 So, from the above three aspects, the revised draft has clarified the proper
 relationship between the people and their representative organs, between the
 representative organs and other state organs, and between the central and
 the local authorities.  It has provided a clearer and more rational divi-
 sion of powers and functions between the state power organs and administra
 tive organs, and between central state organs and local state organs, and
 has properly integrated a high degree of democracy with a high degree of
 centralism.  It has thus consolidated and developed the people's congress
 system in our country.
 The Revised Draft Has Enlarged the Powers and Functions of the NPC Standing
 Committee and Has Consolidated the Highest-State Power Organs
 One of, the prominent and important characteristics of the. revised draft of
 the constitution is that it has enlarged the powers and functions of the NPC
 Standing Committee, especially the legislative power of the latter; and has
 transferred some of the powers and functions which originally belonged to
 the NPC to its Standing Committee.  The revised draft provides that both
 the NPC and its Standing Committee can exercise the legislative power of the
 state and have the right to formulate laws.  The NPC has the power "to make
 and amend basic laws concerning criminal offenses, civil affairs, the
 structure of the state and other matters."  These basic laws include
 criminal law, the law of criminal procedure, civil law, the law of civil
 procedure, the law governing the organization of the NPC, the law governing
 the organization of the State Council, the law governing the organization of
 the local people's congresses and the people's governments at various. levels,
 the law governing the organization of the people's courts, the law governing
 the organization of the people's procuratorate,.electoral law, the law of
 regional national autonomy, and so on.  Other laws, apart from these, are
 to be made and amended by the NPC Standing Committee.  When the NPC is not'
 in session, the Standing Committee has the power to partially amend and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 supplement the basic laws enacted by the NPC.  Besides, the revised draft
 also provides that the NPC Standing Committee has the power to supervise
 the enforcement of the constitution; to examine and approve plans for
 national economic and social development, and some readjustment plans of
 the state budget, when the NPC is not in session; and to decide on the
 appointment and removal of ministers and chairmen of commissions upon the
 recommendation of the premier of the State Council; and so on.  On the
 other hand, the revised draft also has a series of stipulations to
 strengthen the organization of the NPC Standing Committee.  For example,
 it is stipulated that members of the NPC Standing Committee shall not con-
 currently hold posts in state administrative organs or the judicial and
 procuratorial organs, so that they can devote their full. strength and time
 to carrying out their own duties; the chairman, vice chairmen and secretary
 general of the NPC Standing Committee will form the chairmanship conference
 to attend to its important routine work; the responsible people of the
 standing committee of the people's congress of each province, autonomous
 region and municipality directly under the central government shall attend
 the sessions of the NPC Standing Committee, so as to enable the NPC Standing
 Committee to maintain closer ties with local authorities and masses; and so
 on.  All these new stipulations are of great importance to fully bringing
 into play the NPC Standing Committee.
 Some comrades are afraid that enlarging the powers and functions of the NPC
 Standing Committee will weaken the role and functions of the NPC as the
 highest state power organ, and will be harmful to promoting socialist
 democracy.  The principal reason they give for this is that, while the NPC,
 as the highest organ of state power, is composed of deputies from various
 electing units and has a relatively extensive representativeness, the NPC
 Standing Committee, being produced by the NPC through election, has a less
 complete representativeness than the former, and is merely its permanent
 organ.  This question must be considered both from theory and practice.
 According to the Marxist theory of law, law must be based on certain social
 relations and must conform with the needs of the ruling class to consolidate
 its rule in the political and economic fields.  In talking about the
 Napoleonic Code of France, Marx said, "Once this code no longer conforms
 with social relations, it will immediately turn into a pile of valueless
 waste paper."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 6, p 292)  Lenin
 very sharply divided "constitutions" into "written constitutions" and
 "practical constitutions."  He,called constitutional documents prepared by
 the state "written constitutions," and called economic and political rela-
 tions, which are objective things, "practical constitutions."  Whether the
 "written constitution" can truly give full play to its legal functions does
 not depend on what is literally prescribed by it but on whether its content
 is divorced from the "practical constitution," and on whether it conforms
 with the objective needs.  Being realistic and proceeding in all cases from
 the actual circumstances is one of the fundamental principles which must
 always be scrupulously abided by in socialist legislation, and the principal
 criterion to judge whether the constitution and law are complete.  This is
 also the correct attitude we must take in considering the question of
 democracy--we must concentrate our attention on real democracy.  If the form

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100290001-6
 of democracy is divorced from objective reality, that democracy will not be
 a genuine one.  Therefore, in order to ensure that socialist democracy can
 be fully carried out, we must consider the actual situation in our country
 in working out the political system, we must devise a system which can
 guarantee the fully efficient operation of state power organs and which can
 effectively ensure the people's rights to control the state.
 Let us look at the actual situation.  First of all, as far as the super-
 ficial situation is concerned, since the NPC is the highest organ of state
 power, it should enlarge its powers and functions but should not enlarge
 the powers and functions of its Standing Committee.  However, this cannot be
 easily achieved in actual practice.  In view of the past practice, there was
 a relatively large number of delegates to the NPC. (not exceeding 3,500
 people as stipulated by the electoral law in accordance with the actual
 needs).  This hindered the progress of work and the exercise of powers and
 functions.  Therefore, the question of reducing the number of delegates has
 been considered in the course of revising the constitution.  But, on the
 other hand, it is difficult to reduce the number of delegates in order to
 maintain a wide representation of the NPC because our country is a vast
 country which is densely populated.  Since there is a large number of dele-
 gates and in order to keep the meetings from being too lengthy, it is
 rather difficult to discuss problems.  Therefore, the NPC meetings can only
 concentrate on discussion and solution to questions of fundamental signifi-
 cance in the state's political life.  On the other hand, in the wake of the
 development of the socialist cause, there are some serious national problems
 awaiting solution.  The NPC is designated to make laws which are sometimes
 unable to meet the demands of reality.  In view of this, as early as in
 1955, the Second Session of the First NPC adopted a resolution which
 authorized the NPC Standing Committee to formulate certain laws.  The reso-
 lution pointed out:  "In the wake of the progress of socialist construction
 and socialist reform, it is necessary for the state to.formulate various
 laws in order to meet the demands of the state's construction and work.  At
 the conclusion of the NPC meetings, it is inevitable for the NPC Standing
 Committee to adopt and implement certain laws.  In light of this, in
 accordance with Article 19 of Regulation 31 of the PRC Constitution, the
 NPC Standing Committee is authorized, in accordance with the spirit of the
 constitution and actual need, to appropriately formulate certain laws--the
 special regulations."  In 1959, the First Session of the Second NPC adopted
 another resolution which authorized the NPC.Standing Committee, at the con-
 clusion of the NPC meeting and in accordance with the demands for develop-
 ment and work, to amend certain. inappropriate articles of the law and make
 new regulations.  In the new historical era, in order to strengthen social-
 ist democracy and the socialist legal system and ensure the smooth progress
 of the four modernizations drive, it is extremely necessary to strengthen
 socialist legislative work and promptly deal with major problems.  In the
 light of this, we see that enlarging the powers and functions of the NPC
 Standing Committee is a scientific summation of the long-term practice of
 the system of the people's congress and is also an objective demand of the
 new historical era.

 Second, the NPC Standing Committee has the ability to exercise the powers
 and functions entrusted to it by the constitution.  At present, the NPC
 Standing Committee has nearly 200 members.  Although the NPC Standing Com-
 mittee is formed by means of elections of people's congresses throughout
 the country, it consists of representatives from various aspects.  This
 shows that the NPC Standing Committee is fully capable of exercising the
 state's legislative power.  It was stipulated in the constitution in 1954
 that the NPC is the sole organ exercising the state's legislative power and
 that the NP-C Standing Committee cannot formulate laws but only decrees.
 This stipulation was made with reference to the 1936 constitution of the.
 Soviet Union.  However, in accordance with the Soviet 1936 constitution, the
 number of members of the Supreme Soviet Presidium was only 33.  The present
 number of members of our country's NPC Standing Committee is about 5 times
 that of the Soviet Supreme Presidium.  Since the size of the'NPC Standing
 Committee is rather appropriate, it is rather easy for it to hold regular
 meetings.  With its power extended and its organization strengthened by the
 draft of the revised constitution, it can give full play to its role as a
 standing body.
 Finally, while enlarging the powers and functions of the NPC Standing Com-
 mittee, the draft of the revised constitution has also attached great
 importance to the building of people's congresses throughout the country.
 Following are major new regulations:  1) Restore the legal procedure of the
 1954 constitution in relation to the NPC's right to-revise the constitu-
 tion, pass laws and other proposals, and entrust to the NPC the right to
 make decrees (including decisions and resolutions beyond the. scope of law).
 These stipulations are of great significance to maintaining the position of
 the fundamental law of the constitution, enhancing the seriousness of the
 resolutions adopted by the NPC and strengthening the socialist legal system.
 2) Regulations have been made on establishing the special committees such
 as the committees in charge of economics and finance, education and science,
 and foreign affairs in order to examine, discuss and draft relevant propo-
 sals.  Delegates to the NPC.have the right to put forth legislative
 proposals in order to strengthen the NPC's legislative work.  3) As far as
 the rights of the delegates to the.NPC is concerned, the regulation in the
 1954 constitution on the exemption right of delegates has been restored.
 According to this regulation, the statements and votes of the delegates made
 in various meetings are not subject to legal prosecution.  At the same time,
 regulations on the delegates' obligations have also been made.  They must
 maintain close ties with units to which they originally belonged and with
 the masses, listen to and reflect. the people's opinions and demands, and
 assist in the implementation of the constitution and the law.  Hence, the
 delegates can better perform their duties.. The draft has strengthened the
 building of the NPC and its Standing Committee, ensuring that they give full
 play. to the role of being the highest organs of state power and really
 becoming the people's authoritative organs of power.

 The Draft Enlarges the Powers and Functions of the Local State Organs, and
 Consolidates the Local Organs of State Power
 Another major characteristic of the draft of the revised constitution is
 that the powers and functions of the local organs of state power have been
 enlarged and the building of local people's congresses at all levels has
 been strengthened.  Since the proposal of shifting the country's work
 focus onto socialist modernization centering on economic construction was
 put forth at the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, the
 local organs of state power at all levels, particularly those at and above
 county level, are shouldering heavier tasks.  Therefore, under the
 centralized and unified leadership of the CCP Central Committee, appro-
 priately enlarging the powers and functions of the local organs of state
 power and strengthening the building of local organs of state power at all
 levels are essential to giving play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the
 localities and speeding up the development of the four modernizations drive.
 The draft has summed up the experience of building political power in the
 localities since the founding of the state and particularly over the past
 few years.  It has also made the following new regulations on strengthening
 the work of the local organs of state power at all levels.  These new regu-
 lations are major reforms in the local organs of state power.
 1.  The powers and functions of local state organs have been enlarged.
 The draft stipulated that the people's congresses and the standing com-
 mittees of the people's congresses of provinces, autonomous regions and
 municipalities directly under the central government can formulate and
 promulgate local laws and regulations provided that they do not contradict
 the state constitution, law, decrees and administrative rules, and submit
 them to the NPC Standing Committee for the record.  This is of great sig-
 nificance to giving play to the enthusiasm of the localities.  Simultane-
 ously, the draft also expands the autonomous power of the autonomous organs
 in the minority nationality autonomous regions.  For instance, it has been
 stipulated that minority nationality personnel will take up posts of chair-
 man and governor of the autonomous region, and governor of the autonomous
 counties; that under the planned guidance of the state, the autonomous
 organs will be responsible for the management of the local economy, culture
 and so on; and that in opening up resources and building enterprises in the
 autonomous regions, the state should take into consideration the interests
 of the autonomous regions.  These stipulations are conducive to safeguarding
 the minority nationalities' right of autonomy and strengthening the unity
 of the various nationalities in striving for the realization of the four
 modernizations drive.
 2.  Direct election is to be implemented at the county level.
 In the structure of the state organs, the organs at county level play a
 very important role in providing continuity between what has gone before
 and what comes afterward.  The organs of state power at county level con-
 stitute an important cardinal link in leading and organizing the broad
 masses of people.  The people's congresses at county level are elected by

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 the people.  They help to place the organs of state power at county level
 under the direct supervision of the masses, maintain closer ties between
 the state organs and the masses, improve the efficiency of work and lead
 well the four modernizations drive.  The implementation of direct elections
 at county level lays a solid foundation for the election of organs of state
 power at all levels above county level.  Thus, the implementation of direct
 elections at county level is very important to perfecting the people's
 congress system and ensuring that the masses are masters of their own
 house.
 3.  Local people's congresses at all levels at and above county level are
 to set up their standing committees.
 In accordance with the stipulations laid down in the 1954 constitution, the
 local people's committees at all levels are the executive organs of the
 people's congresses at all levels and, simultaneously, they exercise the
 powers and functions of the standing organs of the people's congresses.
 Practice has proved that because the local administrative organs shoulder
 heavy tasks which hinder their efforts in exercising-the powers and func-
 tions of the standing organs of the people's congresses and because of the
 lack of the standing organs of the people's congresses, a situation in
 which the administrative organs are under their own supervision and are
 actually divorced from the regular supervision of the local organs of state
 power appeared.  The draft stipulates that local people's congresses at and
 above county level should set up standing committees and it has also laid
 down explicit stipulations on the organization and powers and functions of
 the standing committees of the people's congresses.  The general powers and
 functions of the standing committees of the people's congresses are:  dis-
 cuss and make decisions on major issues of the local administrative
 district; supervise the work of the local people's government, people's
 court and people's procuratorate; and make decisions on appointment and
 dismissal of the personnel of the organs of state power.  Thus the estab-
 lishment of the standing committees of the local people's congresses at and
 above county level is of great significance to promptly discussing and
 solving local problems regarding the four modernizations drive in
 accordance with local conditions, strengthening the building of the people's
 congresses and strengthening regular supervision over other local state
 It is worth pointing out that the draft also entrusts to the standing
 committees of the people's congresses a large part of the powers and func-
 tions of the local people's congresses at and above county level stipu-
 lated in the 1954 constitution.  This means that local people's congress
 standing committees now have the power to dismiss inappropriate resolutions
 and others issued by the people's government at the same level and by the,
 people's government one level below, and the power to dismiss inappropriate
 resolutions made by the people's congresses one level below.  From a super-,
 ficial look at the situation, the powers and functions of the local people's
 congresses at and above county level are reduced and the powers and func-
 tions of the people's congress standing committees are enlarged.  However,
 such stipulations are in fact more rational and practical because they are
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 more conducive to placing the local administrative organs at all levels
 under the regular supervision of the local organs of state power at all
 levels. In view of the stipulation on the powers and functions of the NPC
 Standing Committee laid down in the 1954 constitution, the NPC Standing
 Committee was also given the power to dismiss the resolutions and orders
 issued by the State Council which were contradictory to the constitution,
 the law and decrees, and the power to alter or dismiss inappropriate reso-
 lutions made by the organs of state power of. provinces, autonomous regions
 and municipalities directly under the central government.  The local
 people's congresses were entrusted with the exercise of such powers only
 because no local people's congress standing committees had been established.
 This shows once again that, regarding the stipulation of the powers and
 functions of the people's congresses and their standing committees, we
 should not superficially look at the amount of powers and functions but
 should see whether they are rational and accord with practical needs.  The
 draft not only establishes standing committees for the local people's con-
 gresses at and above county level but also makes explicit stipulations on
 their powers and functions.  This has further perfected the system of the
 people's congress, ensuring that full play will be given to the role of the
 local organs of state power.
 In short, the draft consolidates the establishment of the highest organs of
 state power and the local organs of state power in accordance with the
 principle of democratic centralism.  It realizes the major reforms and new
 developments in the state system and greatly improves our country's
 people's congress system.  It has great practical significance and far-
 reaching historical significance in carrying forward socialist democracy,
 strengthening the socialist legal system and ensuring that our country will
 be built into a modern and strong socialist country with a high degree of
 democracy and civilization.

 THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIALIST DEMOCRATIC POLITICS IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 25-27
 [Article by Gong Yuzhi [7895 5148 0037]]
 [Text]  The draft of the revised constitution..is being discussed by all the
 people.  Our people have placed high hopes on the revision of the constitu-
 tion this time and they are confident that the discussion, formulation and
 implementation of the new constitution will surely become a new milestone
 in building up our country's socialist political democracy.
 This revision of the constitution is being carried out after the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee definitively formulated the
 party's correct line during the new historical period and after the 6th
 plenary session made a basic summary of the party's-history since the
 founding of the PRC.  The whole party and the whole people have deeply
 thought over the experiences and lessons in the 30 years of our great and
 arduous history and our future tasks and path.  Our people wish to record
 the basic results of their deep pondering, the basic experiences that they
 have drawn from history and the basic path for future development on the
 basic law of the state.
 Naturally, the construction-of the socialist.. democratic political system has
 become one of the key issues that the party and the people have conscien-
 tiously thought over.
 The 3d Plenary Session-of the 11th CCP Central Committee already pointed out
 that we should embody our democracy in our political system and laws and make
 the system and laws stable, constant and extremely authoritative.  In his
 speech at the 30th National Day, Comrade Ye Jianying pointed out that we
 should "reform and improve the socialist political system," and include
 "building up a high degree of socialist democracy" and "a highly developed
 socialist spiritual civilization" into the "major goals of our socialist
 modernization."
 At the 5th Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, the draft of
 the revised CCP constitution was discussed and the abolition of the de
 facto lifelong tenure system for cadres in leadership posts was adopted as
 an important principle.  Later, at,the enlarged meeting of the CCP Central

 Committee Politburo, Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave a speech in which he syste-
 matically expounded on the problem of the reform of the leadership system
 of the party and the state.  One of the aims of the reform was to solve the
 problem of the excessive centralization of power and to abolish the life-
 long tenure system for cadres in leadership posts.  He also said that the
 CCP Central Committee would propose a revision in the constitution in order
 to reflect this reform.
 In the historic resolution that was approved by the 6th Plenary Session of
 the 11th CCP Central Committee it was pointed out that "gradually building
 up a highly democratic socialist political system is one of the basic
 tasks of the socialist revolution.  Our failure to realize the importance
 of this task was one of the important factors that gave rise to the 'Great
 Cultural Revolution.'  This is a grievous lesson for us."  The resolution
 highly praised the party's decision to abolish the de facto lifelong tenure
 system for cadres in leadership posts.
 Now this guiding ideology has been embodied in the draft of the revised
 constitution.  The draft of the revised PRC Constitution stipulates 5-year
 terms of office for the state chairman and vice chairmen, the NPC Standing
 Committee chairman and vice chairmen, the State Council premier and vice
 premiers, the state councillors, the chairman of the Central Military Com-
 mission, the president of the Supreme People's Court and the president of
 the Supreme People's Procuratorate.  It also stipulates that none of them
 may serve for more than two consecutive terms.  This actually means writing
 into the constitution the abolition of the lifelong tenure system for cadres
 in leadership posts.  As a result, the constitution specifically embodies
 the existing regulations on limiting the terms of office in the highest
 leadership offices of the state.
 The construction of the political system of socialist democracy consists of
 many aspects, and the abolition of the de facto lifelong tenure for the
 highest leading posts of the state is merely one of the aspects.  I am
 going to give a few of my opinions on this point.
 We all know that for feudal emperors there was a lifelong tenure system and
 hereditary succession.  The overthrow of the autocracy of feudal kings and
 the establishment of the democratic republic political system, in which the
 top officials of the state are selected by election and their tenure is
 limited, is one of the great achievements of bourgeois democratic politics.
 It is also a major step forward in the political life of the human race.
 Of course, bourgeois democracy is in essence rule by a small number of
 exploiters.  The constant change in the heads of states and heads of
 governments in the capitalist countries reflects, in essence, contention for
 power and readjustment in the contradictions between the various economic
 groups and political sections within the bourgeoisie.  This only serves to
 safeguard their rule over the broad masses of the laboring people.  More-
 over, restriction of the length of tenure of top officials of the state is
 often not stipulated in the fundamental laws of all capitalist countries
 and not always observed even though it has been stipulated in the funda-
 mental laws of a capitalist country.

 Socialist political democracy belongs to the whole laboring people and is,
 in essence, quite superior to the bourgeois political democracy.  However,
 it takes time to build up the socialist political democracy.  Due to vari-
 ous specific historical conditions, although the highest leaders in social-
 ist countries are elected to their offices, a de facto lifelong tenure
 system has emerged.  After the death of Stalin; from summing up the his-
 torical experiences of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the CCP noted
 the negative results in political life in socialist countries by the exces-
 sive concentration of power and the formation of the personality cult.  In
 light of international experiences and in connection with China's cause,
 the CCP already started at that time to consider the question of abolishing
 the lifelong tenure system in party and state leadership posts.
 In 1956 Chairman Mao Zedong proposed that he would not serve another term
 as state chairman, and at the same time also considered not serving a
 further term as party chairman at an appropriate time in the future.  The
 leading comrades of the Central Committee agreed with this view.  The
 party constitution adopted by the eighth party congress included a provi-
 sion that "when the Central Committee deems it necessary, it can establish
 the post of honorary party chairman."  This without doubt reflected this
 consideration.
 On 30 April 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong talked with nonparty personalities
 and mentioned that he did not wish to be nominated as a candidate for the
 position of chairman of the state.  Two nonparty personalities wrote to
 Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhou Enlai about this.  In their letters,
 they expressed their opinions that this was a matter of great concern and
 hoped that the party and government prudently think over the problem.  On
 5 May, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the following remarks on the letters that
 had been sent to be read by him:
 "This matter has already been discussed by dozens of people at the meeting
 in Beidaihe and has been considered by them as feasible.  They have also
 discussed my refusal to serve a future term of office as the chairman of
 the party, but they were of the opinion that although it cannot be accepted
 at this time, it may be accepted in the future when the situation allows."
 "We can also consider that we will revise the constitution and stipulate
 that the chairman and vice chairmen can be reelected only once, and only
 after they have served a term of office."
 Referring to what was said in the letters about stressing the prestige of
 an individual in a collective leadership still being an important link for
 uniting the people of the whole country, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote:
 "I am still alive; the prestige of the individual for uniting the people
 will not diminish because of my refusal to accept reelection."
 Regarding the problem of continuing to play his role in the political life
 of the state, Comrade Mao Zedong thought that when he was freed from his
 firstline duties, he would be able to concentrate his energy on researching

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 some important issues.  He thought that when he no longer held the post of
 chairman of the state, he could deliver speeches on major issues as the
 party chairman at proper meetings if necessary, and that even if he no
 longer held the post of the CCP chairman, he would still be able to
 deliver speeches as a member of the CCP Politburo.
 Comrade Mao Zedong asked that copies of the letter and his remark be circu-
 lated to "all members and alternate-members of the CCP Central Committee,
 all the deputies to the eighth CCP national congress, all the provincial,
 municipal and regional CCP committees, all the NPC deputies and all the
 members of the CPPCC."  He also wrote:
 "This matter should be widely discussed in order to be accepted by the
 people and win their support.  We should also consider revising the consti-
 tution."
 "At present, an increasingly large number of high-ranking leading comrades
 have accepted this idea, but because of a lack of exchange of opinions,
 there are still quite a large number of nonparty personalities who will not
 accept this idea.  Therefore, it is necessary to spend a great deal of time
 in discussing the matter."
 Reviewed today, how insightful his words are.
 It is a pity that owing to the change in the situation which is known by
 everybody, restricting the number of terms of office that a state chairman
 and party chairman can consecutively serve was suspended for a long time.
 Later, the personality cult was gradually aggravated and the power of the
 party-and the state was excessively concentrated onto one individual.  As
 a result democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership
 was weakened or even completely destroyed.  During the "Great Cultural
 Revolution" the practice of including the de facto lifelong tenure system
 for the leader and the stipulation about the leader being succeeded by a
 specified person was written into the constitution.
 History has undergone twists and turns.
 Since the smashing of the "gang of four," both the party and the people
 have become enlightened again.  Searching for a way to.reform the leader-
 ship system of our party and state through a summing up of our own his-
 torical experiences and lessons has become one of the key issues that
 people have been discussing.  With the results of the personality cult in
 the past and the propaganda of the new personality cult still fresh in
 their minds, many old-generation proletarian revolutionaries and many
 careful thinkers among the cadres and masses both inside and outside the
 party have realized and raised in their discussions the necessity for
 abolishing the lifelong tenure system for supreme leading officials.  This
 is an inevitable trend as well as a natural and reasonable conclusion.
 Encouraged by the spirit of the Id Plenary Session of.the 11th CCP Central
 Committee, some theoretical workers have theoretically raised and discussed
 this problem with a keen insight.  It is precisely on this basis that our

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100290001-6
 CCP Central Committee collected the opinions of the masses, decided when
 the time was right and bravely put forth the abolition of the de facto
 lifelong tenure system for leadership posts as a major policy decision
 resulting from a wider range of opinions, in a more perfect form and by
 more accurate reasoning.  Thus it reflected the desire of the masses.
 How are we to understand the significance of this policy decision?  In my
 opinion, the significance lies in at least the following aspects:
 First, this is a reform system, not just a step taken to meet temporary
 requirements.  This reform system was not put forth in isolation.   On the
 contrary, it was put forth as one of the major links of the reform of the
 overall leadership system of the party and the state and the reform of the
 overall cadre system.  As Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping profoundly pointed
 out:  The reform and perfection of a system is more fundamental and com-
 plete and has greater stability and duration than the thought, work style
 and responsibility of an individual.
 Second, this policy decision helps to establish ideologically, politically
 and organizationally the Marxist viewpoint and principle that the Communist
 Party and the state must be under the collective leadership of leaders with
 ability and political integrity who have emerged amid mass struggle.
 Third, this policy decision helps to bring into play the superiority of the
 socialist system in cultivating and steeling large numbers of talented
 leaders.
 Fourth, this policy decision helps to develop genuinely equal and demo-
 cratic relations in the highest leadership stratum and puts a stop to the
 patriarchal system and the phenomenon of the individual placing himself
 above the collective.
 Fifth, this policy decision helps to formulate a democratic order, solve
 the problem of the handing over of power by the highest leadership stratum,
 and ensure the continuity and stability of the correct leadership of the
 party and state.
 Sixth, this policy decision helps to bring down the average age of the
 highest leadership stratum and to regularly rejuvenate it, thus facili-
 tating its constant absorption of new vitality, experience and knowledge.
 The old generation of proletarian revolutionaries' prestige, experiences
 and wisdom that have been gained in their prolonged struggle are the politi-
 cal and spiritual treasure and great strength of the whole party and state.
 While rejuvenating the leading cadres ranks, the CCP Central Committee has
 also formulated some methods and measures to enable those comrades who have
 retired from firstline posts tocontinue.to play their important role--as
 much as their energy and health allow--in the political life of the party
 and state, especially in making decisions on important matters.  Our old
 generation of revolutionaries should sincerely help those comrades who lack
 their prestige, competence and experience, so that they will be worthy of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 leading posts.  They should regard this as their glorious duty for the
 party and the people.  This shows the noble quality of true communists.
 In short, the CCP Central Committee's important policy decision on the
 abolition of the lifelong tenure system for cadres of leadership posts has
 won the support of the broad masses and the broad ranks of our cadres.
 This policy decision has been reflected in the draft of the revised consti-
 tution and is being implemented in the current work of reforming the lead-
 ing organs of the party and state.
 History usually reflects progress.  But on these problems, it seems that we
 merely have returned to the correct viewpoint that we put forth many years
 ago.  However, as was said by Hegel, the same maxim would sound much more
 profound if it was said by an old man who had experienced the hardships of
 life than by a young man who had not experienced much of life.  Though it
 is the same correct viewpoint, when we soundly affirm it today, our affirma-
 tions have been supported by the positive and negative experiences of our
 past; therefore, our understanding of this viewpoint is much deeper and
 much richer in meaning than that of many years ago.  In carrying out this
 correct viewpoint today, we are much more conscious, much more resolute and
 much more persistent than we were many years ago.  At that time, many
 people were not mentally prepared for the reform, but now. the reform has
 become the common will and desire of every one of us.  We are engaged in
 establishing and perfecting a complete system to ensure the full realiza-_
 tion of socialist political democracy..  We are fully confident that we will
 make steady progress.

 A NEW QUESTION FOR STUDY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 28-30
 [Article by Xu Daohe [1776 6670 3109]]
 [Text]  At present, we have started to combat serious economic crime.  The
 struggle has given rise to a new question for study.  We should be armed
 with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to preserve the purity of
 communism.
 Notable results have been scored in carrying out the open-door policy and
 the policy on strengthening our domestic economy in accordance with our
 socialist modernization and with the international and domestic situations
 since the smashing of the "gang of four," particularly since the 3d Plenary
 Session. of the 11th CCP Central Committee.  That the policy will be carried
 out in future is beyond doubt.  We should, however, note that in the past 2
 or 3 years there has been a notable increase in serious crime such as
 smuggling, selling of smuggled goods, corruption, bribery, speculation,
 swindling, and stealing property from the state. and collectives.  Such
 activities are rampant in a small number of localities and among a small
 number of people.  Such activities, which do great damage to the socialist
 economy, are often done by a small number of people in the national depart-
 ments and enterprises who have colluded with undesirable elements in
 society.  Some of these activities are done under the pretense of the state
 or enterprises, some are even backed up by some leading cadres.  Some of our
 cadres, however, do not have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness
 and destructiveness of the questions reflected by the class struggle under
 the present historical conditions.  It is, therefore, necessary to raise
 the ideological level of the members of the Communist Party and the staff
 of the state, to keep a clear mind and to preserve the purity of communism,
 so as to achieve a state of not being corrupt while the correct open-door
 policy and the policy on strengthening our domestic economy are being con-
 sistently carried out.  This gives rise'to a new question for study.
 "The decisions made by the PRC. State Council on combating serious economic
 crime" states that "our cadres, particularly our middle-ranking and leading
 cadres, should study again the works of Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong,
 solemnly and persistently preserve the quality of the vanguard of the work-
 ing class of our party, and preserve the purity of our members' communism.

 Our members' ideological level should not be lowered and their political
 awareness should never be weakened.  Our members should never become
 corrupt and degenerate."  The successful study of the new question, the
 preservation of the purity of communism and the opposition to corruption
 and deterioration all play an important part in the interest of our people
 and our state, in the stability of our socialist system, and in the pros-
 perity or decline of our state.
 During the cause of our revolution and construction, whenever a new his-
 torical era starts, we often pay close attention to the purity of com-
 munism.  We always raise new questions in time so as to prevent corruption
 and degeneracy among a small number of members and cadres.  For instance,
 the emphasis of our work shifted from the rural area to the urban area
 during the early postliberation period.  At that time,.we had to come into
 closer contact with the capitalists.  Confronted with this situation, some
 of our members became despondent.  "They had not been conquered by the
 armed enemies."  "They could not sustain the people's attack with sugar-
 coated bullets," so stated Comrade Mao Zedong at the 2d Plenary Session of
 the 7th CCP Central Committee.  They indulged in material enjoyment; they
 were blinded by lust for gain; and they took part in bribery and corruption
 and in illegal practices.  Nevertheless, our party led all of its members
 and cadres to study its principles and policies so as to strengthen their
 political awareness and raise their ideological level.  Our party started
 the movement of "anticorruption, antiextravagance, and antibureaucracy."
 It severely punished a small number of serious criminals.  Our anticorrup-
 tion and antidegeneracy force in our party has been greatly strengthened.
 Necessary conditions for socialist reform and socialist economic construc-
 tion have been created.
 Our present situation is different from that in the past.  It is different
 from the situation in Russia's period of implementing the new economic plan
 declared by Lenin.  However, the basic principles and spirit of preserving
 the purity of communism and the struggle against corruption and degeneracy
 as advocated by Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong are still applicable to our
 present situation.  The article "Excerpts of Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong
 on Opposing Communist Members' Corruption and Degeneracy," which has been
 recently carried in the. press, is good material for study.  We should
 thoroughly execute the "Decisions by the PRC State Council. on Combating
 Serious Economic Crimes" and should study them seriously.
 First, we should study communist ideology, build up a sound communist world
 outlook and fight persistently against harmful. trends.
 In many of their works Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong have stated their
 insistence on communist ideology.  During the war of resistance against
 Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "it is beyond doubt that our
 highest guiding principle is to push China toward a socialist and communist
 society.  The name of our party and our Marxist world outlook have obvi-
 ously demonstrated our brightest, highest and most wonderful ideal."
 ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 3, p 1008)  Every member has to dedi-
 cate himself to this struggle when he joins the Communist Party.  He is

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 required to form a communist world outlook and to uphold the party's
 principles.  As we march along the road to communism, it is inevitable
 that the development of our revolution'will be impeded by all kinds of
 nonproletariat and harmful trends.  How should we tackle these harmful
 trends?  Lenin has pointed out that we "should keep a close eye to such
 trends and should resist them by means of communism."  ("Complete Works
 of Lenin," Vol 31, p 416)  Comrade Mao Zedong also has pointed out that a
 member of the Communist Party should "uphold the correct principles and
 wage tireless struggle against erroneous ideas and behavior at any time
 and place."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 2, p 332)  At present,
 a small number of our party members have become corrupt and degenerate,
 and they have leaned toward the liberal bourgeoisie.  We should follow the
 teachings of Lenin's and Mao Zedong's to uphold the party's principles and
 to carry out the struggle.  Various harmful trends will run wild and
 greatly endanger the cause of our revolution if we do not wage a firm
 struggle against them.
 Second, we should learn to preserve the purity of communism under any con-
 ditions.  We should not lower the members' ideological level or weaken their
 political awareness.
 Lenin has pointed out that "to preserve the ideological and political
 individuality of the proletariat is the constant and doubtless obligation
 of the socialists.  Those who fail to fulfill this obligation are no. longer
 socialists in practice."  ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol 10, p 60)  In the
 preface and afterword to the "Survey on Agriculture" in 1941, Comrade Mao
 Zedong pointed out that "to preserve solemnly and firmly the purity of com-
 munism among the members of the party, to protect those capitalistic quali-
 ties which benefit the economy and to let them develop appropriately are
 indispensable in our resistance against Japan and at the age of building
 up a people's republic."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 3, p 751)
 At present, our socialist economy has become absolutely dominant.  Various
 forms of economy and management will continue to exist.  Our social policy
 can never be a communist social.policy.  However, members of the Communist
 Party should preserve the purity of communism under all circumstances.
 They should also maintain a good relationship between the preservation of
 the purity of communism and various social policies adopted under differ-
 ent circumstances.  We should not use the comments on noncommunism to
 criticize the social policies and oppose noncommunist policies which are
 adopted in accordance with the practical situation.  Nor should we give
 up preserving the purity of communism, lower the ideological level or
 weaken the members' political awareness just because some social policies
 are not communist.
 Third, we should learn to serve the people wholeheartedly and vow to wage
 a lifelong struggle for communism.
 It is our party's aim to serve the people wholeheartedly.  It is our mem-
 bers' sacred responsibility to wage a lifelong struggle for communism.
 Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The Communist Party is to struggle, to serve the
 people wholeheartedly, not half-heartedly."  ("Selected Works of Mao
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 Zedong," Vol 5, p 420)  He also said that "Communist Party members should
 never put their own interests first.  Their personal interests should give
 way to the interests of the state and people.  Therefore, selfishness,
 sluggishness, corruption, deterioration, 'showing off,' and so forth are
 most detestable.  Selflessness, diligence, wholehearted devotion to public
 duty, the spirit of quietly immersing oneself in hard work, and so forth
 are reputable."  (ibid., Vol 2, p 488)  Through studying Comrade Mao
 Zedong's teaching and practicing it in daily work, we can realize the
 public demand, become one with the masses and straighten out our party's
 spirit.  If we possess such ideas and spirit, we will be able to put the
 interests of the state and people first, handle the relationship among the
 state, the collectives and the individuals, and abstain from jobbery; we
 will not give ourselves the airs of a hero and become proud and complacent,
 slacken off from making any further progress, and will not seek ease and
 enjoyment or be afraid of leading a hard life when we score good results;
 we can make criticism and self-criticism, be courageous enough to admit
 our shortcomings and to overcome them and rectify any ideas and behavior
 which are adverse to our party's cause when we make some errors in our
 work.  In sum, if we possess such ideas and spirit, we can resist the
 capitalist attack with sugar-coated bullets, we will not lose in the battle
 against such sugar-coated bullets, and we can make continuous progress and
 vow to dedicate ourselves to the lifelong struggle for communism.
 In studying the article "Excerpts of Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong on Oppos-
 ing the Corruption and Degeneracy of Communist Members" under the new
 historical conditions, we should closely link it with the present economic
 crime and the harmful trends in the society.  We should take the'lesson of
 the corruption and deterioration of the small number of cadres.  We should
 summarize and study the experience of our good and uncontaminated cadres,
 members and collectives amid the corrosion of capitalist ideas.  We should
 analyze the practical situation to get a better understanding of the related
 teachings of Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong, to raise our ideology level and
 strengthen our political awareness, and to strengthen resistance to capital-
 ist corrosion.

 IS AN INDIVIDUAL UNDERTAKING PRACTICING EXPLOITATION IF IT EMPLOYS
 ASSISTANTS AND TAKES ON APPRENTICES?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 30-31
 [Article in "Questions and Answers" column by Doug Yancheng [5516 5885 2052]]
 [Text]  In our economy today, a small number of individual tradesmen own
 some means of production and, with the permission of the state managerial
 departments of commerce and industry, have one or two assistants or
 several apprentices, and these operators make more money than their
 assistants and apprentices.  Is this. exploitation through hiring labor?
 To answer this question, it is necessary to examine the sources and nature
 of the earnings of these individual tradesmen.
 First of all, it should be noted that the income of individual tradesmen, is
 greater than that of their assistants and apprentices and is not solely a
 result of gratuitous ownership of surplus labor.  The amount a tradesman
 earns includes, first, the value created by his own labor.  An individual
 tradesman owns a little means of production but he is a laborer at the same
 time.  More often than not, he also has higher skills and more managerial
 competence, playing an important role in the process of production.  He does
 more sophisticated labor than his assistants and apprentices, so it is right
 that he earn more than they.  Second, the earnings of a tradesman include
 the money made through his earlier investment in the business.  These-earn-
 ings are equal to or modestly higher than the bank interest for the same
 amount of money.  Therefore, although it is earnings on investments, it is
 justified and permitted by the socialist economy.  Third, the earnings
 include the extra income resulting from pricing factors.  The individual
 economy is a small commodity economy, the economic effects and earnings of
 which are closely related to the changes of supply and demand on the market.
 Since some problems still remain in balancing supply and demand in our coun-
 try at present, and some prices are irrational, a tradesman can often sell
 at an inflated price and purchase at a discount.  This extra income is not
 created by the. labor of the individual tradesman, nor by the labor of his
 assistants and apprentices, but is created by the labor of laborers in other
 departments and transferred through price adjustment (it is also transfer-
 rable to the state through price adjustments and tax collections).  Fourth,
 the individual tradesmen make profit from the surplus labor of their
 assistants and apprentices.  The amount of this is determined by the number

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100290001-6
 and productivity of the assistants and apprentices.  The productivity of
 individual trades is rather low, and one individual tradesman is permitted
 to have a few assistants.  Therefore, the value of the surplus labor of his
 assistants and apprentices is very little and cannot provide the bulk of
 his income.
 One cannot indiscriminately regard the individual tradesman who has
 assistants and apprentices as a capitalist exploiter of.hired labor because
 there are essential qualitative and quantitative differences between the
 two.
 Qualitatively speaking, exploitation means that the workers have no alterna-
 tive to selling their labor power to the capitalists.  The relationship
 between the capitalists and the workers is characterized by the workers'
 forced labor and the capitalists' gratuitous ownership of the surplus value
 created by those workers.  But the'relationship between the assistants and
 apprentices and the masters of such individual trades is a coalition based
 on contract, which sets down the rights, obligations, tenure and income of
 both parties.  Even though the assistants and apprentices are not paid for a
 part of the value they have created, it can be thought of as payment for the
 techniques they have learned.  Speaking on the nature of apprenticeship
 Engels pointed out:  "Apprentices and assistants are not working to earn
 sustenance, but rather to make themselves masters too."  ("Selected Works
 of Marx and Engels," Vol 3, p 310)  These two essentially different kinds
 of labor relations and ownership relations should not be confused.
 Quantitatively speaking, the portion of income derived from surplus labor
 by the individual tradesman differs from that of the capitalists.  Under
 the conditions of hired employment, capitalists' income is totally derived
 from surplus value, which enables them to devote themselves to activities
 of surplus value, rather than labor-oriented activities, and to continuously
 increase their wealth.  Under individual trade conditions, a tradesman is
 permitted by the state to hire not more than two assistants, and no more
 than five apprentices if he has some special skills.  This limitation
 ensures that the value of surplus labor only constitutes a small portion-of
 his income.  Moreover, he cannot spend all his time on activities of surplus
 labor; instead, he has to take part in laboring.
 Small commodity production like these individual trades, needless to say,
 has a spontaneous tendency to expand, to hire more assistants and make more
 profits.  But socialist public ownership and state policies are predominant
 in our state today.  They regulate the scope of business, selling prices
 and indices of income and expenditure of individual trades.  So, with effi-
 cient management, proper guidance and support, the negative aspects of the
 individual economy can be restrained and the business of individual tradesmen
 can play a positive role.

 DO JOINT UNDERTAKINGS AND INDIVIDUAL UNDERTAKINGS MEAN EMPLOYMENT?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 p 32
 [Article in "Questions and Answers" column by Lian Cen [4886 1478]]
 [Text]  Basically, employment means combining labor and production resources
 and engaging in social labor in return for a reward or income.  The social
 format of employment, or the channel of employment, is-determined by the
 system of ownership of the means of production.  Under the circumstances
 where the means of production belong to individual laborers, the means of
 production of an individual laborer are his direct means of employment.  In
 a capitalist society, where individual laborers lose the means of produc-
 tion, a worker can only seek employment by selling his labor.  The socialist
 system has opened up a good future both for the employment of the members of
 society and for the combination of laborers and the means of production.  .In
 our country today, and for a long period of time to come, the economy of the
 system of public ownership of the means of production is predominant, and at
 the same time there are diverse economic forms.  The state-run' economy and
 collective economy are our country's basic economic forms;.the individual
 economy of laborers of a limited scope is a necessary supplement to the
 economy of the public ownership system.  In order to adapt to the various
 forms of economy, employment must take.various forms.  Employment means
 engaging in any occupation under social division of work and in return
 getting back a reward or income.  Employment, whether working in units in
 cooperative undertakings, individual undertakings or state-run enterprises,
 is employment just the same; it is only the form of employment that differs.
 Under the influence of "leftist" errors in the past, policies of banning
 and suppressing the individual economy was implemented.  Overemphasis was
 placed on transforming the collective economy into a state-run economy.
 This blocked many channels of labor employment.  Consequently, people
 formed a one-sided view of employment.  They believed that employment means
 becoming staff and workers of the state, or staff and workers in big collec-
 tive units, and that working in cooperative or individual undertakings is
 not employment.  Such misconceptions of employment stem from equating
 employment to certain definite forms of employment.
 Working for state-run enterprises was only one.form of employment, but not
 the whole.  For a long period of time, the production structure of our state

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 was unreasonable because unilateral emphasis was placed on developing
 heavy industry.  More than 50 percent of newly recruited workers were in
 industrial departments.  Among the industrial departments, 70 percent of
 workers were concentrated in heavy industry.  At present, many people are
 working in the industrial departments, and the number of those engaged in
 the retail business, service trade, catering trade, repair and maintenance
 trade, and certain consumer production trades is relatively few.  In recent
 years, although there has been an increase in the number of people employed
 in these trades, the increase still fell largely short of actual demand.
 The problems of clothing, eating and repairs, which were prevalent in the
 cities in our country, are far from being solved.  Taking the forms of the
 collective economy and individual economy, these trades will produce
 results beneficial to production and management, as well as be convenient
 for the masses.  Therefore, from now on, the development of the collective
 economy and individual economy are important channels for solving the prob-
 lem of labor employment in the cities.
 In order to develop the national economy and to widen employment channels,
 we must carry out thoroughly the policy of three integrations in employ-
 ment advocated by the party Central Committee and the State Council,
 "Under state coordination, planning and guidance, labor departments should
 make employment recommendations, organize employment on a voluntary basis,
 and plan employment."  The idea of looking down on the collective economy
 and individual economy should be eliminated.  Policies should be made to
 guide, encourage, promote and support cooperative and individual under-
 takings willing to organize themselves for employment.  Their property,
 which is also their means of employment, should be given legal protection.'
 Under the conditions of efficient management, higher income, and attention
 to appropriate accumulation, the collective economy can provide better
 wages and welfare facilities than national enterprises.  The legal income
 of individual laborers, even if it is fairly high, should also be safe-
 guarded.
 Cooperative and individual undertakings pose many problems to many young
 people.  On the subjective side, inexperience, and on the.objective side,
 capital, location, resources, sales, and management all pose problems.  In
 addition to national support, the individual's desire to start an under-
 taking is needed to overcome these problems.  We should fervently help the
 young people build up a new concept of employment, and make them feel at
 ease about making contributions to satisfying the needs of the masses and
 the four modernizations by developing production and strengthening the
 economy.

 CAN OUR COUNTRY USE DEFICIT BUDGETING TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 p 33
 [Article in "Questions and Answers" column by Dai Yuanchen [2071 0955 2525]]
 [Text]  The socialist economic construction of our state proceeds in a
 planned way.  The scope of construction should be based on the state's
 capability and should proceed progressively.  The balance of a budget
 serves as an important indicator of whether the scope of construction is
 in accordance with the state's capability.  Although a deficit budget will
 temporarily increase construction capital and expand the scale of con-
 struction, in reality it cannot speed up construction.  On the contrary, it
 will trigger a series of harmful effects.
 First, to make a deficit budget expand the scale of construction and to
 .increase the part of the national income used for accumulation implies that
 the distribution quota of the planned national income exceeds the amount of
 national income created.  In fact, the distribution quota of the national
 income ultimately cannot exceed the amount created.  Though distribution
 in excess of the quota expands capital construction, it will squeeze out
 some consumption with the result that some purchasing power cannot be
 materialized, thereby creating a disproportion between accumulation and
 consumption.
 Second, as capital is a reflection of resources, to carry out construction
 by a deficit budget not only surpasses the financial capability of the
 state, but also goes beyond the material resources of the state.  This
 necessarily creates an excessive scope of capital construction, an over-,
 extended front, and failure to complete a project on schedule so that it
 can go into production.  As a'result, construction is extended over a long
 period of time, with only investment and no output, no production capacity
 is formed and the investment result is poor.
 Third, deficit budgeting and distribution exceeding the quota will lead
 to a tight supply of material resources.  To safeguard capital construc-
 tion will squeeze out raw materials, timber and fuel, as well as power
 required by the current production, will squeeze out the equipment needed
 for repairs, and will interfere with simple reproduction.  This will

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 affect the accumulation of capital and the production of social material
 wealth.  The result will be more haste, less speed.
 Fourth, a deficit budget will bring an increasing circulation of currency.
 When the currency in circulation exceeds the normal demand, the social
 purchasing power will be far greater than the supply of commodities.  This
 will lead to an unstable currency and rising prices.  People often say that
 capital construction has squeezed out finance, which in turn has squeezed
 out banks.  Banks issue currency, and too much currency leads to inflation
 of commodity prices, which becomes an unstable factor in economic life.
 This is harmful to stability, unity and implementation of the four moderni-
 zations.
 Some people might say that a deficit budget is a common phenomenon in
 Western countries, and that it has the effect of "prolonging the lifespan"
 of the capitalist economy.  Why is it that the things which are applicable
 to Western countries fail to work in our state?
 It should be pointed out that ours is a socialist state, with national con-
 ditions totally different from those of Western countries.  In Western
 countries, crises in sales are common because the purchasing power of the
 laboring masses is relatively inadequate as a result of the labor exploita-
 tion by the capitalists.  To them deficit budgeting will expand government
 expenditure, increase social demand, stimulate production and enhance
 employment opportunities, leading to a temporary relaxation of the economic
 crisis.  This will bring big opportunities for capitalists to promote sales
 and therefore make fortunes.  However, a deficit budget will increase the
 circulation of currency and inflate prices.  It is in fact a hidden form
 of taxation at the expense of lowering the living standard by lowering the
 income of workers.  As a socialist state, we are entirely competent to
 maintain a balance of total demand and total supply in a planned way.  A
 relative shortfall in the ability to pay and demand, or excessive produc-
 tion will not occur.  Thus, there is no need'for a deficit budget to expand
 social demand.
 In the 30-odd years since the founding of the PRC, deficits were incurred
 in a few years.  But these were owing to some errors in our work.  When the
 problems were spotted, positive measures were taken to balance the deficits.
 Comparatively large deficits were incurred in our state during 1979 and
 1980.  After common efforts by the whole party and the people throughout
 the state, a fundamental balance of revenue and expenditure was realized in
 1981, and this was a wonderful achievement.  Since the foundation of a bal-
 ance of revenue and expenditure has still not yet been consolidated, we
 must soberly recognize this fact, persistently pursue the policies of acting
 in accordance with our capability and proceed progressively.  We must hold
 fast to streamlining expenditure while increasing revenue, and strive for a
 balance of revenue and expenditure, so as to ensure a normal flow of pro-
 duction and stable market prices.

 A TENTATIVE PLAN OF STRATEGIC MEASURES FOR DEVELOPING OUR COUNTRY'S
 AGRICULTURE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 34-38, 43

 [Text]  Starting from the concrete conditions of our country, the long-term
 strategic target for the development of agriculture should be:  by means of
 readjustment, reform and development, to set up a modern socialist agricul-
 ture that incorporates intensive, rational, economical and practical
 features with prosperous commodity production, so as to meet the needs of
 the life of our people and the demand for grain and other agricultural
 products in the course of industrial growth, to greatly enhance the income
 and living standard of the broad masses of peasants, and to build a new
 countryside of wealth and prosperity with the comprehensive development of
 agriculture, industry, commerce and communications.
 In order to attain the above strategic target, effective strategic measures
 must be adopted.
 1.  Strengthen and perfect the-socialist economic base.
 In the past, one of the important factors that affected the development of
 our agriculture was the single-product, economy.  From now on, with the
 collective economy as the main element, the operation and management of
 state-run agriculture should be improved, and at the same time household
 sideline production should be actively developed.  Also, individual farming
 households should be allowed to exist and develop under specified condi-
 tions.  All this can help to create an active situation with various
 economic forms promoting and complementing one another, fully mobilizing
 the initiative of the state, the collective and the individual, and thus
 expediting the development of agriculture in our country.
 Under the concrete conditions of our country, the economy of collective
 ownership is the main constituent of socialist agriculture.  This is so
 not only because its. output value amounts to 80 percent of the total output
 value of agriculture and the majority of the rural population and labor

 force belong to the enterprises and organizations of collective ownership,
 but also because, and more importantly, the economy of collective ownership
 is more suited to the present production level of our. agriculture.  Its
 system of management, such as democratic management, a rather close com-
 bination of labor remuneration and production results, and greater
 autonomy and flexibility in operation and management, are very favorable
 for mobilizing the initiative of the collective and the individual, in
 stimulating the production potential and in the rational utilizing of
 resources.  But in the past, under the influence of the erroneous "leftist"
 ideology, many people often held the view that collective ownership could
 not promote the development of productive forces in the countryside, and
 they always wanted to quickly switch to the system of ownership by the
 whole people.  This only led to harmful results.  Therefore, we should
 resolutely establish a long-term, stable policy of making collective owner-
 ship the main constituent in agriculture.  As to the ways of management, the
 autonomous rights of the collective economy should be respected, and all the
 production brigades and production teams should become enterprise units
 which have independent accounting, which assume sole responsibility for
 profits or losses, and which have been granted the right of integration
 vertically and horizontally.  The forms of integration or combination can
 be varied and should not be unified.  Within the collective enterprises,
 various forms of the production responsibility system should be established,
 particularly forms linked to output.  For the cadres, the system of personal
 responsibility closely associated with personal benefits should be prac-
 ticed.  New problems in the production responsibility system should be con-
 tinuously investigated and solved, with a view to perfecting the system as
 production develops.
 Various economic forms should be permitted to coexist. even within the
 structure of state farms.  The measures of democratic.management, forms of
 the responsibility system linked to output, and other measures should be
 studied or practiced, while upholding the essential nature of the owner-
 ship by the whole people.                     But these measures should be taken with due
 consideration paid to the specific conditions of the-farms and should not
 be copied indiscriminately.
 Under the condition that public ownership gets the upper hand, household
 sideline production should be developed vigorously.  In actual life, there
 might exist some contradictions between the household sideline production
 and the collective or state-run economy, but they can be easily resolved
 once management and leadership are strengthened.  As a matter of fact, the
 sound development of household sideline production can exert a positive
 influence on the collective economy.  Based on the actual situation in the
 countryside, the proportion of household sideline production in the total
 agricultural output value should be appropriately raised.  To achieve this
 aim, some practical and effective measures should be adopted, such as:
 expanding the quantity and extent of privately owned land and household
 sideline production of commune members; given the characteristics of our
 country, where there is a lot of barren land and hills and a broad expanse
 of water areas, and based on the specific conditions in different locali-
 ties, some privately owned hilly, sandy and water areas may be assigned to

 commune members; with regard to the prices of products, credit facilities,
 taxes, sales of products, the supply of materials and other things, specific
 policies that facilitate the development of household sideline production
 should be formulated.
 Under the condition that the public-ownership economy enjoys absolute
 superiority, it is also necessary that a small quantity of the agricultural
 individual economy be allowed to exist and develop.  The reason is that
 there are many mountainous regions in our country, and some regions have a
 very low level of production and basically have a kind of natural economy,
 and the peasants live in widely scattered areas.  In these regions, in com-
 parison with the collective economy, the individual and personal economy
 can more effectively mobilize the initiative of the peasants in production
 activities and can better utilize the rich natural resources in the moun-
 tainous regions.  Of course, the individual economy does have the limita-
 tions of small-scale production.  Therefore, investigations and studies
 should be conducted to ascertain under what conditions this kind of economy
 can be allowed to exist and develop, and how it should be supported, guided
 and managed, so as to formulate a series of practicable and concrete poli-
 cies.
 2.  Establish a good agricultural ecological system.
 A good ecological environment is the basis and a very important condition
 for developing agriculture.  For a long time, under the erroneous "leftist"
 ideology, our agriculture violated the natural laws of agricultural produc-
 tion, resulting in serious destruction of the resources in farming,
 forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery.  We should
 earnestly draw a lesson from this in our future work.
 We should comprehensively carry out the policy of comprehensively develop-
 ing the five categories of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline
 production and fishery.  Letting neither grain displace forestry, animal
 husbandry, sideline production and fishery, nor the latter displace the
 former..  In the work of plantation, the structure of the varieties and the
 system of cultivation must be rationalized.  The principle of the combina-
 tion of land utilization with land preservation must be practiced.  Agri-
 culture should be reformed with the techniques of modern agricultural
 biological science.  The traditional experiences in agriculture such as
 the utilization of manure derived from the excrement of men and animals,
 green manure, pond-sludge manure, stalks. for use as manure in fields,
 rotational cultivation of grain and manure, and so on, must be popularized.
 All these measures can combine modern science and technology with tradi-
 tional experiences, paving the way for low consumption, low cost and high
 gains.
 Attention must also be paid to the problem of ecological equilibrium in the
 work of water conservancy.  In the past, there were considerable achieve-
 ments in water conservancy, but because engineering administration had not
 been combined with biological control, some reservoirs were seriously
 clogged with mud and sand.  In recent years, there have been very serious
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100290001-6
 floods in some provinces.  One of the important causes was the destruction
 of forests, vegetation areas and the ecological equilibrium.  The current
 policy in water conservancy, besides the engineering administration itself,
 should place emphasis on the conveyance system and the improving of results,
 and should combine engineering administration with biological control, pay-
 ing particular attention to water and soil conservation and also the expan-
 sion of vegetation areas.  Capital construction in agriculture should be
 done in a down-to-earth way and strive for practical results, so as to
 fully utilize the existing water resources in our country.  In the reser-
 voirs and water areas, fishery and cultivation of aquatic industrial
 products should be developed, and this will help to maintain the water
 resources with the gains from aquatic products.
 Forestry work is a great undertaking that can transform nature, benefit-our
 contemporaries and enhance the well-being of posterity.  In order to estab-
 lish a good ecological environment, active planting of trees and grass must
 be carried out.  We assume that by the year 2000, the forest cover rate
 will be raised from the present 12.7 percent (the actual figure is still
 lower) to about 20 percent, and this will require very great efforts.  The
 first thing to do is to gradually slow down the excessive logging of
 forests and to stop the destruction of forestry resources.  The second
 thing is to effectively plant and protect more trees and to increase vege-
 tation areas.  In this respect the key issue is how to solve well the
 problem of supplying fuel to agricultural households and wood used by the
 public.  For this purpose, aside from developing methane, small-scale
 hydroelectric power, solar energy and other fuel sources, special atten-
 tion should be paid to planting fuel forests and fast-growing forests,
 because they possess the merits of strong adaptability, short growth period,
 a wide range of uses, and small investment with fast results.  In the
 plains areas, household fuels and wood used by the public are very scarce,
 and the problem of ecological equilibrium is serious.  Therefore, the key
 issue in the current afforestation of the plains areas is to make the farm-
 ing fields into a network of trees and to plant trees all around farm
 houses.  Attention should also be paid to the potential and function of
 woody plants and oils.  It is estimated that if all the hilly areas and
 all the unused space around households or farming fields are fully utilized
 to grow woody grain, oils, fruits, and also bamboos and medicinal herbs,
 the farming area would be twice as large as it is now, and the country's
 total food output would increase by 1/4 to 1/2 under present conditions.
 To quicken the pace of afforestation in our country, the fundamental way
 is to mobilize the initiative of millions of commune members (staff and
 workers) in planting and conserving trees.  This necessitates more efforts
 in management.  For example, specialized groups or households can be
 assigned the exclusive task of planting trees on the barren land and hills
 owned by the state or the collective; part of the barren hills can be
 allotted to the commune members as privately owned hills, thus mobilizing
 thousands of households in the work of afforestation.  In this way, trees
 can be planted more quickly and their growth . rate. will be high.

 . Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 The problem of ecological environment should also be solved well for the
 development of animal husbandry and fishery.  At present, nearly half of
 the meadows in our country have degenerated, because'too many animals are
 feeding in the fields, exceeding the capacity of the fields, and the con-
 struction of meadows has been neglected.  From now on, the following
 measures should be taken:  designate the number of animals according to
 meadow conditions, have a rational assortment of animal species, and set a
 rigid limit for the number of animals feeding in the fields; develop.arti-
 ficial forage grass based on land conditions, and gradually set up bases
 for forage; in those pastoral areas where the number of privately owned
 animals is comparatively large, meadows can be allotted to set up a respon-
 sibility system for meadows with regard to grassy hills and slopes that
 are not suitable for stock raising, the livestock should be confined to
 certain areas and fed with grass cut from the fields, so as not.to spoil
 the vegetation and to avoid soil erosion; with regard to ill-used grassy
 plains, hills and slopes, scientific plans should be worked out to
 rationally use them and to avoid indiscriminate reclamation; methods
 should. be devised to raise the growth rate of livestock, the percentage of
 meat yield from livestock, and the commodity rate of livestock, and to
 lower the consumption rate of forage; and so on.  In recent years, the
 fishery resources in the coastal water areas and the fresh water regions
 have been drastically spoiled.  Of the eight main categories of fish of
 economic value, some have basically lost the ability to regenerate.  For a
 rather long period of time from now, the fishery resources should be well
 protected, setting up zones where fishing is prohibited and stipulating
 periods when fishing is prohibited in coastal waters that have suffered
 from serious misuse.  The outlet for developing fishery is mainly dependent
 on artificial fish breeding, and on the carrying out of the policy of com-
 bining fish breeding with fish catching, with proper emphasis on breeding.
 Special efforts should be exerted to develop fresh water breeding, because
 it can limit the quantity of fishing in coastal waters to a rational extent,
 thus facilitating the protection and rehabilitation of fishery resources,
 and, what is more, restore and maintain a certain portion of water areas
 that will benefit irrigation work and regulate the local climate.  Also,
 the pond sludge resulting from fish breeding is a good organic manure.
 Besides, some measures in the southern provinces, such as building
 mulberry-based fish ponds and sugarcane-based fish ponds, and combining the
 growing of vegetables, raising of pigs and breeding of fish, should be
 actively practiced because they closely integrate fishery with plantation
 and animal husbandry and help to promote mutual progress.
 To sum up, our agriculture should be guided by the laws of ecological
 equilibrium.  All the measures concerning engineering, machinery and tech-
 nology, and also the whole system of cultivation, and the structure and
 arrangement of crops, should conform-to this law without exception.
 3.  The economic structure in the countryside should be readjusted.
 On condition that the general grain output increases steadily, the propor-
 tion of industrial crops, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production,
 fishery, industry, commerce and communications should be increased in the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 total output value and the assignment of the labor force.  In 1980, the
 ratio of the output values of grain and industrial crops was 7 to 3.  The
 ratio of the. output values of agriculture and forestry-animal husbandry-
 sideline production-fishery was also 7 to 3.  The output value of industry
 run by the production teams amounted to 14.5 percent of the total agricul-
 tural output value.  According to abundant sources from our own direct
 investigation and general statistics, a rough picture can be visualized:
 for production teams that give an average income of over 150 yuan per
 person, the income of forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and industrial
 sideline production amounts to more than 40 percent.  For production bri-
 gades that give an average income of over 300 yuan per person, the income
 of forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and industrial sideline production
 amounts to around 60 to 70 percent.  For brigades that give over 400 yuan
 per person, the income of forestry and others amounted to as high as over
 80 percent.  Conversely, for teams that give an average income of less than
 50 yuan per person, the income of forestry and others amounts to only 20
 percent or lower.  That is to say, the proportion of diversified economy
 bears a very close relation to the amount of income of peasants.  Besides,
 if the proportion of diversified economy is high, the capability to fight
 natural calamities can be increased.  Take Shandong Province for example.
 In 1980, grain production decreased by 3.55 percent because of natural
 calamities, but because the proportion of the output value of industrial
 crops increased from 28.7 percent in 1978 to 37.1 percent in 1980, the
 average per capita income still increased by more than 28 percent.  Of
 course, what constitutes a rational ratio that should be maintained between
 the diversified economy and grain production has to be decided with refer-
 ence to the concrete conditions of different periods and different places.
 From now on, in the work of readjustment three kinds of relationships
 should be dealt with properly:
 First, the relationship between grain and industrial crops-forestry-animal
 husbandry-sideline production-fishery should be handled well.  In our coun-
 try, in the years 1979 and 1980, the area sown with grain was readjusted
 with a total reduction of over 60 million mu.  These mu were converted to
 growing industrial crops or used as forestry and animal husbandry areas.
 In 1981, the sown area of wheat and early rice continued to be reduced,
 this time by 23 million mu.  But, despite this, total grain output main-
 tained a steady increase.  This was mainly because:  1) land unsuitable for
 growing grain was planted with industrial crops that save labor, water and
 manure, and thus more labor, water and manure could be concentrated on
 growing grain crops, resulting in an increase in grain output compared with
 the method of extensive cultivation; 2) after the practice of alternate or
 rotational farming of grain with fertilizer, the fertility of the soil was
 enhanced, and the per unit area yield of grain was raised; 3) with indus-
 trial crops and forestry-animal husbandry-sideline production-fishery
 increasing, more manure and capital could be put into grain production;
 4) the peasants and cadres of basic units fully understood that they had
 to have enough grain to live on and had to develop stockbreeding.  There-
 fore, they adopted various measures to raise the unit output and the total
 output after the reduction of the farming area sown with grain.  But it
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 should be clearly understood that the two tasks stand in contradiction to
 each other in the problem of land utilization.  Thus, when the proportion
 of industrial crops and forestry-animal husbandry-sideline production-
 fishery is being raised, the production of grain must be tackled with the
 greatest effort.  Agriculture is an important constituent part of the entire
 socialist economy, so even after practicing the production responsibility
 system, we should persist in the policy of letting the planned economy play
 the key role, supplemented by regulation by market mechanism.  Under the
 present condition in which the unit output of grain cannot be raised, the
 area for grain cultivation should not be further. reduced.  Besides, in
 order to guarantee the needs of people's life in cities, the suburbs should
 become a base for the supply of vegetables, meat, eggs, poultry and other
 nonstaple food--this is a problem to be solved well in the future.
 Second, the relationship between rational utilization of farmland and the.
 development of mountainous areas, grassland and water areas should be
 handled properly.  In the past, there were many instances of irrational
 utilization of farmland, such as putting all the added investment in high-
 yield fields, with the resulting high costs but very small increases in
 output, and the aftermath was that the output of the medium- and low-yield
 fields could not be enhanced.  .From now on, while stabilizing the output of
 high-yield fields, efforts should. be mainly. concentrated on raising the
 output of medium- and low-yield fields, and also on improving dry land pro-
 duction.  The potential for an increase in output is great for the low-
 yield fields and medium-yield fields (over 70 percent of the total farm-
 land), and also for the dry land, because greater economic results can be
 achieved with comparatively less investment.  In other respects, hills,
 water areas and grass resources have not been fully utilized.  Of these
 resources, 74 percent can be used for agricultural production, but in fact
 only a little more than 10 percent is being utilized:  about 3 billion mu
 of land suitable for forestry have not been used; of the 250. million mu of
 inland fresh water, less than 1/5 has been'used for raising fish, and out-
 put has been low; and 3.3 billion mu of grasslands and 1 billion mu of
 grassy hills and slopes in the.south have been poorly utilized.  From now
 on, hills, water areas and grassland should be rationally exploited so as
 to supply large quantity of woody grains and oils, fruits, meat, milk, fish
 and so on, thus satisfying the needs of society and enabling the peasants
 of our country to prosper faster.
 Third, the relationship, between the various industrial, marketing and com-
 munications trades should be handled properly.  Comprehensive management of
 the production, processing, marketing and transportation of agricultural
 products is essential for changing the irrational system of management
 which separates the trades from each other, restoring the inherent associa-
 tion of these branches in the agricultural economy, and rationalizing the
 economic structure.and the system of management in the countryside.. At
 present, because commodity production in. the countryside is not very
 prosperous, and the degree of specialization and socialization. of ?agricul-
 tural production is not high, the extent of organizing the comprehensive
 management of agriculture, industry, commerce and transportation should not
 be too great.  Based on the principle of specialized collaboration and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 economic rationalization, loose associations. can first be organized without
 changing the system of ownership, and solid economic associations can be
 gradually established with the development of this process.  This process
 will be a long-term one, and no groundless administrative interposition
 should be allowed.  Besides, things cannot be dealt with in a hurried way.
 4.  Socialist commodity production should be developed.
 Developing commodity production and raising the commodity rate has much to
 do with rapidly developing our agriculture and helping the peasants to
 prosper.  According to typical statistics, in production teams where there
 is average income of over 150 yuan per person, the commodity rate reaches
 55.2 percent, but in production teams where there is an average income of
 under 50 yuan per person, the commodity rate is only 18.5 percent.  In the
 whole country, the commodity rate of agricultural products has reached only
 a little more than 30 percent,.which lags far behind that of developed
 countries.  In order to develop commodity production and raise the commodity
 rate, the following problems should be dealt with properly:
 First, as to the arrangement of production, concentration of production
 must be. appropriately based on the concrete conditions of the land.
 Regionalization, specialization and intensive -operation should be gradually
 achieved.  Only in this way can we improve our technology, improve our
 varieties, increase the output per area unit, and enhance the labor produc-
 tivity and the commodity rate.  For instance, the 157 counties that serve
 as bases for goat raising have furnished the state with 60 percent of the
 purchased goat skins; in 1979, the 17 sugarcane bases in Fujian Province
 produced 99.4 percent of the total quantity of sugar in the province.
 Second, great efforts should be made to develop the diversified economy and
 the work of processing agricultural sideline products.  The production of
 the diversified economy is basically a kind of commodity. production.  There-
 fore, the focal point in the development of commodity production should be
 centered on this aspect.
 Third, the form of the responsibility system of specialized contracts link-
 ing production results with remuneration will be a strong impetus to develop-
 ing commodity production.  Specialized households need only a small amount
 of investment and have low costs but can provide greater results, thus
 enabling the stockbreeding'and other undertakings to greatly raise the com-
 modity rate.  For example, more than 30,000 specialized pig-raising house-
 holds and key households in Liaozhong city supply the city with 30 percent
 of the pigs consumed; in Rushan County, Yantai Prefecture, the specialized
 chicken-raising households and part-time households of a single production
 brigade supply 1/7 of the purchased eggs of the county.  It can be asserted
 that specialized households and their combined units are a form of economy
 that holds great prospects for developing socialist commodity production.
 Fourth, circulation channels should be kept open.  For many years, under the
 erroneous influence of "leftist" ideology, the relations between production,
 circulation, distribution and . consumption: in the course of reproduction
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 were severed.  The planned economy was treated. as contradictory to the
 development of commodity production, and this resulted in confusion and
 bad results.  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Com-
 mittee, in many places there has emerged the coexistence of diversified
 channels and diversified forms of marketing, and the rural markets have
 been more brisk.  But, generally speaking, the problem of the system and
 structure of commodity circulation is far from being fundamentally solved.
 Under the unified plans and management of the state, various elements of
 the commercial economy should be allowed to exist, with the state-run
 commerce as the backbone.  The economic results of these sectors should
 be coordinated, so as to have more channels and fewer links, with a view
 to enlivening the market and guaranteeing supply.
 Fifth, communications and transportation in the countryside should be
 actively developed.  The stagnation of commodity production in some places
 is owing to the stagnation of communications.  Various forces of the state,
 .the collective and the individual should be fully mobilized to run the work
 of transportation, with special attention being paid to villager-run
 transportation, which has great potential for development, and to bring the
 functions of railroad, highway and water transport into full play.  Great
 attention should also be paid. to communications construction in mountainous
 regions and border areas.
 Sixth, the construction of small market. towns and small towns should be
 stepped up so that they can be developed into trading centers, centers for
 industry and sideline production, centers for food and other services, and
 centers for cultural and technological activities, with the result that
 agricultural commodity production.. can develop further.
 5.  Agricultural science should be actively developed.
 Because of the readjustment of various policies concerning the countryside,
 the initiative of the broad masses of peasants has been enhanced to an
 unprecedented degree, and a new situation has begun to emerge with the
 masses learning and applying different branches of science.  The task ahead
 is to make good use of this favorable situation to actively develop agricul-
 tural science, so as to raise the level of scientific farming and breeding
 and the level of scientific management.
 An important problem in raising the level of scientific farming and breed-
 ing is the low level of technology in the countryside, and the low scien-
 tific, cultural and management levels of commune members and cadres of the
 basic units.  According to typical investigations, of the rural labor
 force, illiterate persons amount to 26.4 percent; those who know a few
 characters, 18.3.percent; those who have a primary education, 31.5 percent;
 those who have a secondary education, 23.7 percent; and those who have a
 college education, 0.1 percent.  In the countryside, technical personnel
 are very scarce, and some communes do not even have any technical. personnel.
 In view of this situation, we should:
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 First, grasp well the work of eliminating illiteracy.  First, the illiteracy
 among young and middle-aged people must be eliminated within a given number
 of years.  Then primary school education can be made universal, and in some
 regions both primary and middle school education can be made universal.
 Second, the agricultural educational structure and system should be
 reformed.  At present, the ratio of the students in agricultural institu-
 tions of higher learning to those in technical secondary education is 1:2,
 and the spare-time schooling of peasants is nearly nil.  In France, the
 ratio of students in agricultural.colleges,. secondary schools and spare-
 time schools is 1:20:20.  According to the concrete conditions of our
 country, equal attention should be paid to these three levels of agricul-
 tural education.  When distributing education funds, the proportions for
 the last two kinds of education should be appropriately increased.
 Third, agricultural scientific research and technical popularization systems
 should be set up and perfected. In our country, agricultural scientific
 research work is rather backward, and technical popularization is particu-
 larly backward.  Since liberation, thousands of positive results in agri-
 cultural scientific research have been achieved, but few have been really
 popularized.  From now on, special emphasis. should. be put on the work of
 popularizing technical know-how.  Not only should we pay attention to the
 research and popularization of modern agricultural science and. technology,
 but also sufficient emphasis should be put on the summing up and enhance-
 ment of our traditional agricultural techniques, so that the two can be
 combined effectively.  The recently introduced form-of the responsibility
 system linking technology with output is an effective form for promoting
 science and technology and should be actively popularized.  Emphasis
 should be placed not only on training-technical personnel in various kinds
 of agricultural schools, but also on training "local experts" and skilled
 craftsmen.
 Fourth, the role of existing scientific and technical personnel on the agri-
 cultural front should be brought into full play.  The number of scientific
 and technical personnel on the agricultural front of our country has long
 been insufficient, and at the. same time there exists the serious problem
 that a large number of these personnel are working in units that have
 nothing to do with their schooling.  According to related statistics,
 personnel who were graduated from our agricultural colleges or secondary
 schools since liberation and are still working in agriculture-oriented
 units amount to a little more than 1/3 of the total number.  In other words,
 nearly 2/3 of these graduates have been transferred to work in other depart-
 ments.  This is a tremendous waste.                      The main causes of this phenomenon are:
 1) the authorities concerned do not pay attention to agricultural science;
 2) in the agricultural. units, working conditions.are poor, and rewards are
 low politically and materially;.. and 3) some specialties are not suitable for
 local application.  We have the following suggestions:  1) the work of
 transferring agricultural. technical personnel back to their professional
 posts should be done properly;.2) the political and material conditions of
 agricultural technical personnel should be improved, and help should be
 given to them to solve their practical problems; and 3) while doing good
 work in the forecasting of production development, agricultural education
 should be well planned, so as to. avoid inapplicable or impractical subjects.

 ON SPIRITUAL CIVILIZATION AND MARXISM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 39-43
 [Article by Zhang Qihua [1728 0796 5478]]
 [Text]  Our country has entered a new historical period.  During this
 period, we will build a socialist material civilization and at the same
 time spare no efforts to building a socialist spiritual civilization.  This
 work is urgently needed in our present modernization program and is
 demanded by basic Marxist principles.  Therefore, various departments and
 units must put this work in a very important position.
 From a Marxist point of view, civilization is the product of the develop-
 ment of the history of the social progress of mankind as well as ,the
 criterion of mankind's social progress.  In primitive society, people lived
 under uncivilized and barbaric conditions because of the extremely low level
 of productive forces.  They led a life of "eating coarse foods, drinking
 soup made of foliage, wearing animal skins in winter and wearing leaves in
 summer."  They were not concerned with spiritual civilization.  Following
 the constant development. of social productive forces, people began to
 depart from the uncivilized and barbaric era and to enter the civilized
 era.  Historically, civilization includes two aspects--material and
 spiritual.  When Marx and Engels talked about the "production of the whole
 world" in "German Ideology," they particularly noted that this production
 "also includes spiritual production."  They called the production of the
 whole world, which includes spiritual production, "global overall.produc-
 tion" and pointed out that this is "what is created by people."  ("Collected
 Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 3, p 42)  Therefore it can be seen that mate-
 rial civilization and spiritual civilization are like the two wings of a
 bird and they are indispensable in every period of the development of
 civilization.  Material civilization is the base and source for the building
 of spiritual civilization, while spiritual civilization has a powerful reac-
 tion on the building of material civilization.  The development of spiritual
 civilization can in no way be divorced from the development of material
 civilization; neither can the development of the latter be divorced from
 that of the former.  These two aspects condition and supplement each other.
 Spiritual civilization has a different nature and content in different eras.
 For example, slave society, feudal society and capitalist society created

 their own science, culture, health and sports that were or are in line with
 the economic conditions of their own times and the political ideology and
 the concept of morality that were or are in a ruling position.  In particu-
 lar, the capitalist society, where productive forces have developed dras-
 tically, not only has created a material civilization that has a wealth much
 greater than the total wealth since the beginning of history, but has also
 created a spiritual civilization that is much higher than the spiritual
 civilization of any previous society.  But in a class society, there exists
 exploitation of man by man and oppression of man by man, and consequently
 people"s spiritual life is deformed and far from complete, with both
 civilized aspects and ugly and uncivilized aspects.  This feature is most
 prominent in a capitalist society.  Engels once pointed out profoundly that
 the basis of bourgeois civilization is "exploitation of one class by another
 class and therefore all its development is carried out in the contradictions
 that often happen."  These contradictions are shown in the fact that "when
 one thing is good for some people, it is naturally bad for some other people
 and that when one class wins a new liberation it naturally means a new
 oppression for another class."  Therefore Engels concluded that "the more
 the civilized era develops, the more it puts the cloak of love on the bad
 things it naturally created, so as to whitewash or deny them,--in short, it
 habitually practices hypocrisy."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels,"
 Vol 4, pp 173-174)  Engels pointed out here that spiritual civilization
 under the system of slavery, exploitation and oppression-naturally has a
 nature of hypocrisy and contradictions.  The socialist society is based on
 the public ownership of the means of production; it is a brand-new social
 system in the history of mankind.  In a socialist society it is necessary to
 build both a highly developed material civilization and'a spiritual civili-
 zation that is more developed than any class society.  Without highly
 developed material civilization there will be no foundation for spiritual
 civilization, and without highly developed spiritual civilization it is not
 possible to form a highly developed material civilization.  Therefore, it is
 necessary for a socialist society to create a more advanced and.higher stage
 of spiritual civilization on the basis of critically absorbing the excellent
 .fruits of all spiritual civilizations created by our predecessors.
 Basing himself. on the viewpoint of Marxism and Leninism and proceeding from
 the specific conditions of our country, Comrade Zhao- Ziyang expounded the
 main contents of socialist spiritual civilization in his report on govern-
 ment work to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fifth NPC.  These contents
 include the scale of the development and the level of education, science,
 culture, art and literature, health and sports, and the orientation of the
 development and the development. level of social political. ideology and
 ethics.  The purpose of building. socialist. spiritual civilization is to
 transform our people of various nationalities into a people with aspiration,
 morality, discipline and culture.
 Some people hold that the concept of "spiritual civilization" was never used
 .in Marxist and Leninist works and, therefore, they are doubtful about advo-
 cating the building of socialist spiritual civilization.  The fact is that
 it makes no difference whether such a concept had been used before; the
 question is whether there is such an idea.  For example, it was mentioned

 above that in "German Ideology" Marx and Engels mentioned the "production
 of the whole world" and that "spiritual production is also. included," and
 these words no doubt also include the ideology of "spiritual civilization"
 that is being mentioned by us today.  In addition, it is not difficult for
 us in reading Marxist and Leninist works to find that Marxist classic works
 have on many occasions made important and concrete expositions on this
 question.
 Now let us talk about the first aspect of socialist spiritual civilization.
 Marxism always holds that the development and popularization.of education,
 science and culture is a great motive force for promoting the development
 of society.  In the "Manifesto of the Communist Party," Marx and Engels put
 forth 12 important socialist measures and they stressed the importance of
 "combining education with material production."  ("Selected Works of Marx
 and Engels," Vol 1, p 273)  Marx said time and again that in order to
 change social conditions, "the: corresponding education system is needed."
 ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 16, p 654)  Marx and Engels
 spoke highly of the role played by natural science in developing society
 and pointed out:  "Modern natural science and modern industry have changed
 the whole natural world and put an end to people's naive attitude toward
 nature and their naive activities."  (ibid., Vol 7, p 241)  Lenin. inherited
 Marx' and Engels' ideology and paid great attention to carrying.out scien-
 tific and cultural education among the masses.  He repeatedly pointed out:
 "If we say that it is necessary for us to destroy-outer obstacles, then we
 particularly feel that the most arduous work is to reeducate the masses,
 organize and train them, popularize knowledge and fight against the
 heritage of ignorance, lack of civilization and barbarism we have
 accepted."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 3, p 816)  He also said:  "In
 order to build communism, it is imperative to master technology and
 science and enable the broad masses of the people to use them."  ("Collected
 Works of Lenin," Vol 30, p 419)  He. said:  "People will. become communists
 only when they are able to enrich their brains with all the knowledge that
 has been gained by mankind."  He pointed out that "a communist society can-
 not be built in an illiterate country."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 4,
 pp 348, 357)
 Now we should talk about the wrong aspect of socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion.  Directed against the viewpoints which deny the important roles of
 politics and ideology in the development of society, Marxist classic works
 on several occasions clearly pointed out that although the development of
 politics, law and philosophy is based on economic development,. this develop-
 ment has an influence on the economic foundation and cannot be neglected.
 Marx and Engels pointed out in the "Manifesto of the Communist Party":
 "The communist revolution means completely breaking away from the relation-
 ships of traditional ownership; it is not strange that in the process of its
 development, it thoroughly breaks away from traditional concepts."
 ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 1, pp 271-272)  To "thoroughly
 break away from traditional concepts" in fact includes denial of the polit-
 ical ideology and ethical morality of the exploiting classes and the estab-
 lishment of communist political ideology and ethical morality.  In this
 respect, Lenin inherited and developed Marx' and Engels' brilliant ideology.

 Lenin paid particular attention to educating the masses of. people with
 communist ideology.  He said:  "Strictly speaking, so-called communism
 means working for society without pay, no consideration of the differences
 between individuals, no old viewpoints, no conservative psychology, no old
 habits, no difference between various working departments and no difference
 in labor pay."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 30, pp 160-161)  He also
 pointed out that "communist morality is the morality of uniting the labor-
 ers to oppose all exploitation and oppose all small private ownership
 services."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 4,p 353)  He called on the
 people to "strive to abolish the cursable convention of 'each for himself
 and God for all' and overcome the practice that regards labor as a burden
 and holds that any labor must be given a certain pay."  ("Collected Works
 of Lenin," Vol 31, p 104)
 The above-mentioned citations show that the education, science, culture,
 political ideology and ethical morality expounded in Marx' classic works
 are important contents of the socialist spiritual civilization we are talk-
 ing about today.  Therefore, it can be seen that the question of spiritual
 civilization occupies a very important position in the Marxist ideological
 system.
 Some people ask: Is it not also necessary for capitalist countries. to
 develop science, culture, sports and health?  How can we say that these are
 the contents of socialist spiritual civilization?  Our answer is that this
 is because our country is developing these aspects with a socialist nature
 and contents.  Science includes natural science and social science.  Natu-
 ral science has no class character,. and we cannot say that there is a pro-
 letarian science and a;bourgeois science.  But our natural science must
 serve the socialist modernization program and must take dialectical. mate-
 rialism and historical materialism as the guide for its world outlook.                        On
 the other hand, social science has a very strong class character.   There-
 fore, it must have Marxism as its guide.  Its political viewpoint and
 ideological. tendency must be in line with the four basic principles and
 must serve the consolidation and development of the socialist system.  Like
 social science, education, culture, and art and literature must also serve
 socialism and take Marxism as their guiding ideology.  They must also have
 different socialist contents and regard it as their own important tasks to
 form a new ideology, new spirit and new social practices.  There is no doubt
 that health and sports must also serve socialism and must take Marxism as
 their guide in world outlook.  Therefore, our work of developing science,
 culture, sports and health is of a different nature than that in capitalist
 countries.
 Although these two aspects of socialist spiritual civilization have differ-
 ent nature and contents, they are interrelated and influence each other.,
 Cultural cultivation and scientific knowledge have a great influence on
 people in forming their communist world outlook and moral outlook.  The
 formation of the communist world outlook and moral outlook will inspire
 people to further display their talent and wisdom and to further improve
 the level of their cultural and scientific knowledge.  But these two
 aspects cannot be mentioned in the same breath and be regarded as the same

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100290001-6
 thing.  In our view, the core of socialist spiritual civilization is a com-
 munist world outlook and moral outlook.  It is nothing other than this kind
 of world outlook and moral outlook and thorough revolutionary spirit that
 manifest the features of socialist spiritual civilization.  They represent
 a basic difference from capitalist and feudal spiritual civilizations.  The
 key point in building socialist spiritual civilization is to educate the
 masses with communist ideology so as to enable them to form communist
 aspirations, beliefs and world outlook and to heroically struggle for the
 realization of communism in our country.  Advanced cultural knowledge and
 scientific technology will be able to serve our modernization program only
 when they are mastered by people armed with communist ideology, and it is
 only they who are able to ardently take part in socialist labor with high
 consciousness and shoulder heavy responsibilities.  Therefore, in building
 our socialist spiritual civilization, we must put education on communist
 ideology and morals in the primary position.
 Some people might ask why, since the requirements for building socialist
 spiritual civilization are so high, it is possible to build such a civili-
 zation in our country with fairly backward material conditions?  Do we not
 violate the principle of historical dialectics of "social ideology being
 determined by social existence" if we do so?  We believe it is necessary to
 clarify this question.
 First of all, when Marxism affirms that social existence determines social
 ideology, it also affirms that social ideology. is comparatively independent.
 It is true that material civilization is not philosophical social existence
 while spiritual civilization is not social ideology.  But we can say that
 the progress in the material living conditions of mankind, the,progress in
 labor tools and technology,. and the growth of the material wealth of mate-
 rial civilization constitute an important part of social existence and are
 part of the productive forces (it is generally known that the basic thing
 in social existence is the mode of production of goods and materials and
 that the mode of production includes the two aspects of productive force
 and production relations).  On the one hand, it is true that some contents
 of spiritual civilization which represents progress in the wisdom and
 morality of mankind do not belong to social ideology, and this part includes
 some cultural knowledge, health and sports.  But another-major part does
 belong to social ideology (social ideology includes such forms as political
 ideology, the ideology of rights, morality, science, philosophy, art and
 literature, and religion).  Therefore, in investigating the relationship
 between material civilization and spiritual civilization, we can completely
 follow the law of the relationship between social existence and social
 ideology as expounded by historical materialism.  That is to say, we must
 first of all acknowledge that spiritual civilization is the foundation and
 the source of material civilization, and we must also acknowledge that
 'spiritual civilization is comparatively independent.  The development of
 spiritual civilization and the development of material civilization do not
 necessarily and mechanically balance or maintain.a definitive relationship.
 Second, the development of spiritual civilization has its own particular
 laws.  The various parts of spiritual civilization rely on material

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 production to different. degrees.  Generally speaking, the scale and level
 of the development of education, science, culture, hygiene and physical
 training directly reflects the degree of development of social economic
 life and of material production.   They are directly conditioned by material
 conditions, and they often and directly play their roles in the development
 of social productive forces.  But none of these are absolute.  Under cer-
 tain conditions, advanced art and literature and philosophical ideology
 might occur in an economically backward country.  Political ideology, moral
 concepts and prevailing social habits are conditioned by material condi-
 tions.  What is more important is that they have a relationship with mate-
 rial production through the'production relations and.the political and
 legal system based on these relations.  The nature of the relations of.pro-
 duction and the nature of a social and political system directly determine
 social political ideology and morals.  Therefore, when Marxism affirms that
 social existence determines social ideology, it also acknowledges that,
 under certain conditions, a country with a relatively backward material
 civilization might surpass another country with advanced material civiliza-
 tion in regard to spiritual civilization.  At the same time, a country with
 advanced material civilization might have a lower degree of spiritual
 civilization than another country with backward material civilization.
 Even within a country, the development of spiritual civilization has not
 always accorded with the development of material civilization indifferent.
 historical periods.  This has often occurred in history.
 Marx particularly spoke of the balance between material production and
 artistic production.  He said:  "With regard to art, we all know that its
 particular prosperous periods do not develop proportionately with the
 general development of society and therefore do not develop proportionately
 with the material base, which serves as the skeleton of social organiza-
 tion."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 2, pp 112-113)  For
 example, under the conditions in which material production was not greatly
 advanced, some ancient Greek literature and art such as the epics "Iliad"
 and "Odyssey" are characterized by profound ideological description and
 superb art, and even the later generations who read these works were amazed
 at such artistic creation.  There are a number of such examples in modern
 world history.  For example, by the end of the 18th century, French
 philosophy and political ideology had already surpassed those of eco-
 nomically advanced Britain.  In the mid-19th century, Germany was
 economically backward and politically divided, but the philosophical
 ideology of this country was the world's top at that time and this country
 became the birthplace of Marxism.  Engels termed this situation "an eco-
 nomically backward country being able, philosophically, to play the first
 violin."  (ibid., Vol 4, p 485)
 Such situations have also occurred in different historical periods in our
 country.  During the war against Japanese aggression, the material condi-
 tions were fairly poor in Yan'an and yet this place was termed by all the
 progressive people as China's "most pure place" and a "sacred revolu-
 tionary place."  The food, clothing and living conditions were very poor
 in Yan'an, but fine sons and daughters of the Chinese people living there
 cherished great political aspiration and lofty morals.  The relationship

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 between men was characterized by equality, mutual help and militant friend-
 ship.                     With high spirits and vigor, they displayed an arduous revolutionary
 spirit, closely united in their common struggles and were confident of the
 victory of the communist cause.  It is apparent that in these aspects the
 extent in the development of spiritual civilization in Yan'an far sur-
 passed that of the regions under the control of the Kuomintang which had
 better material conditions.  Our material conditions were also comparatively
 backward in the 1950's and early 1960's,.yet we made great achievements in
 building socialist spiritual civilization while people's ideological con-
 sciousness, spiritual outlook, social practice and moral cultivation reached
 a considerably high level.  This shows that a fairly advanced spiritual
 civilization might occur in a country with fairly backward material condi-
 tions.
 Similarly, the development of material civilization does not mean the
 progress of spiritual civilization.  In the world today, the material
 civilization in the United States of America is the highest, but the
 spiritual life there is very poor.and the relationship between men is
 nothing but a relationship of money; the words "each for himself .and God
 for all" have become a justified moral principle.  American moral standards
 are amazingly low.  America's artistic arena is full of decadent elements.
 Murder, theft, burglary and drug taking are very common, and the whole
 society is affected by decadence, degeneration and instability.  It is
 only natural that this country has been described by some people as "a
 materially,rich man and a spiritual beggar."
 In short, the extent of the development of spiritual civilization is not
 absolutely determined by material wealth.  It is not against Marxist basic
 principles to build spiritual civilization in a country fairly backward in
 economic terms.
 Of course, when we pay attention to the building of spiritual civilization,
 this in no way means that we may neglect the building of material civiliza-
 tion.  It is true that material civilization and spiritual. civilization are
 often unbalanced but, basically speaking, the former is the foundation and
 source of the latter.  In the final analysis, building a high degree of
 spiritual civilization must depend on a highly developed material civiliza-
 tion.  Therefore, we can at no time neglect the building of.the economy.
 We must dialectically analyze the relationship between material civilization
 and spiritual civilization; we must in no way.understand them metaphysically;
 we must not counterpose.material civilization with.spiritual civilization.
 On the contrary, we must unitedly build and. coordinate these two civiliza-
 tions.  We must understand that the material production in our country is
 still comparatively backward, but because of the correct leadership of the
 party, the superiority of the socialist system and the common efforts of
 the people.across the country, we will certainly build our motherland into
 a great and powerful socialist country with a high degree of material
 civilization and spiritual civilization.

 A NEW PHENOMENON IN POSTWAR MONOPOLY CAPITALISM--DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC
 INTEGRATION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 10, 16 May 82 pp 44-48
 [Article by Hong Wenda [3163 2429 6671] and Wu Yikang [0124 6318 1660]]
 [Text] After World War. II, certain countries in Western Europe combined
 economically to form economically integrated groups of varying types.  This
 fully indicated the tendency toward economic integration in the development
 of monopoly capitalism.  Studying the objective basis for the appearance of
 this new phenomenon and analyzing its structure and economic influences are
 extremely important for achieving an understanding of the new postwar world
 economic and political pattern and the trend of its development.
 Economic integration means a number of countries effecting a close-knit
 economic union and carrying out to varying degrees joint regulation in
 certain sectors of social reproduction.  Viewed from the standpoint of the
 capitalist system, owing to differences in the socioeconomic foundation and
 in the development level, this kind of economic union includes the economic
 integration of monopoly capitalism and the economic integration of the
 developing countries.  The economic integration of monopoly capitalism is
 the result of the daily aggravating contradiction between, on the one hand,
 the internationalization of the economic life of monopoly capitalist coun-
 tries and the high degree of development of state monopoly capitalism and,
 on the other hand, the barriers of the bourgeoisie countries.  It is also
 the product of the intensified contradictions.between the imperialist
 countries.
 As early as during the period of laissez-faire capitalism, the growth of
 giant industries induced various countries and localities to engage in the
 international division of labor and to take part in the world market.  The
 tendency of economic life becoming internationalized was already apparent.
 Following capitalism's entering the stage of monopoly.,. this. tendency
 .gathered force and developed steadily.  After World War II, propelled by
 the scientific and technological revolution, international division of
 labor, international trade and international investments rapidly flourished
 among the monopoly capitalist countries.  The number of transnational

 corporations doubled, increasing quantities of commodities, capital and
 labor power were absorbed in international exchange, and the internationali-
 zation of economic life reached a new stage of development.  But this
 development has been increasingly hampered by the barriers of the bour-
 geoisie countries.  The development of production forces requires the break-
 ing down of these barriers and the achievement of economic coordination and
 alliance between the countries.  Thus, the tendency of economic life to
 become internationalized has become the objective basis and motive power for
 propelling the monopoly capitalist countries in the direction of alliance.
 Concurrently, the progress of the scientific and technological revolution
 and the socialization of production have also promoted the development of
 state monopoly capitalism.  The state has endeavored to. intensify its
 economic functions and has begun to engage in intervention and regulation
 of the national economy in an all-round way.  But, under the circumstances
 of a high degree of development in the internationalization of economic
 life, depending on economic regulation within one country alone is far from
 sufficient.  Moreover, vigorous contradictions and conflicts existed
 between the monopoly capitalist countries in international competition, and
 without international coordination and regulation, economic development
 would be hampered.  Consequently, there arose the necessity of the countries
 concerned to jointly engage in regulation on an. international scale.  During
 the postwar period, in international economic activities there emerged
 international economic organizations of a far-reaching nature, such as the
 international currency sinking fund, World Bank, and organizations for
 agreements on customs excises and trade.  So far as the monopoly capitalist
 countries are concerned, the activities of these kinds of organizations
 exercised, in a way, the function.of international regulation.  But regula-
 tion of this kind spelled only the beginning and played a very limited role.
 In order to further achieve the objective of international regulation, it is
 necessary to reach a higher level and a higher form of international regula-
 tion.  This means that the governments themselves must form. alliances of
 countries and achieve economic integration.
 The economic integration of monopoly capitalism formed on the basis of the
 internationalization of economic life and a high degree of development of
 state monopoly capitalism mean, in essence, the countries concerned joining
 together on a basis of state monopoly capitalism and carrying out economic
 regulation on an international scale.  But, owing to the actual situation
 in which contradictions and conflicts between the monopoly capitalist blocs
 and between the imperialist countries are becoming increasingly intensified,
 this development results in only a portion of the monopoly capitalist coun-
 tries forming economic blocs which are limited to certain localities.  This
 is because:  First, the nature of monopoly capitalism and the uneven state
 of the economic and political' development of capitalism have brought about
 multifold contradictions and intense struggles between the monopoly capi-
 talism of the various countries and the countries representing their
 interests.  Just as the developmental trend of centralized monopoly cannot
 make the various monopoly organizations combine together to form a "world
 trust," neither can the tendency toward integration make the developed
 countries form a "world alliance of state monopoly capitalism."  Second,

 the purpose of some of the countries forming a group is to build up the
 superiority of their own bloc, which must be exclusive and preclusive.
 The participating countries band together their individual markets to form
 a common market under the protection of a tariff wall.  Its principal pur-
 pose is internally to exclude or squeeze out commodities of a third country
 and externally to augment their competitive power.  However, if alliance is
 expanded without limit, these points of superiority will disappear.  Third,
 an integrated alliance will necessarily reinforce the close economic rela-
 tions and the 'mutual assistance between the participating countries as well
 as promote their political combination.  Hence, it requires a relative
 proximity between the participants in regard to their level of economic
 development and their political and economic interests.  The postwar outward
 expansion of the superpowers has actually compelled other countries to band
 together closely as a means of resistance against the control and hegemony
 oflthe superpowers.  As a result, developed countries which have common
 interests in the international economic and political struggles and are
 more or less of the same status have to band together on the basis of their
 common interests.  For this reason, the economic integration of monopoly
 capitalism can only take place in the form of a regionally integrated group,
 and in a place which possesses the most solid foundation and best conditions
 for so doing.  Historical development has shown that Western Europe is pre-
 cisely this region.
 Western Europe is an economically developed area where capitalism has
 achieved a rather high degree of development.  The area it covers is not
 large, but it has a large number of countries. Western European countries
 rely heavily on the international division of labor and on the international
 market.  In particular, they rely heavily on each other.  When the European
 Economic Community was first established, the reciprocal exports of member
 countries already constituted 30 percent of their gross export value.  More-
 over, a firm foundation had'also been laid for the reciprocal. infiltration
 of their monopoly capital.  For example, the Ruhr and Saar districts of West
 Germany, Lorraine and the northern part of France and the triangular area
 formed by Belgium's southern portion and Luxembourg constitute the central
 coal- and steel-producing areas of Western Europe.  In these areas, a close
 network of monopoly capital of these countries has long been in existence.
 For this reason, the contradiction between Western Europe's highly developed
 production and its internationalized capital, on the one hand, and the
 narrow national markets, on the other hand, have become increasingly severe
 and the common demand for breaking down the national barriers, strengthening
 economic alliance, and implementing interregional regulation has become the
 motive force for bringing about the economic integration of Western Europe.
 Besides, Western Europe is an area where state monopoly capitalism
 appeared early and rapidly flourished.  After the war, in the Western
 European countries the union between monopoly capital and the government
 was further strengthened, the state's regulation of economic life greatly
 developed, and state monopoly capitalism advanced to an unprecedentedly
 high plane of development.  This provided the necessary basis for the states
 themselves to organize an economically integrated group.

 Changes in the economic and political status of the Western European coun-
 tries have constituted important conditions for the growth of an eco-
 nomically integrated community in Western Europe.  Over a rather prolonged
 period in history, Western Europe has been the world's major economic and
 political center.  Because of the uneven development of capitalism, and
 after two world wars, the power and status of the Western European coun-
 tries fell considerably.  After World War II, economically they could hardly
 compete with the United States while politically and militarily they were
 gradually menaced by the Soviet Union after the beginning of the 1950's.
 Only by banding together could they effectively defend their independence
 and sovereignty and protect their own interests.  This shows that the
 Western European economically integrated bloc was formed to resist the
 superpowers.  At the same time, the Western European region is the world's
 largest international market, and it is here that traders of the monopoly
 capitalist countries engage in intense struggles against each other.  The
 formation by the Western European countries of a bloc taking the form of a
 common market protected by a united tariff wall and highly exclusive in
 character was in reality tantamount to setting up a regional and collective
 tariff wall to help in the market struggles.  Struggles of this kind
 reflect not only the contradictions between Western Europe and the United
 States but also the conflicts between the six Western European countries and
 Britain, and, in particular, between France and Britain.  The development
 and evolution of these complex contradictions have played an important role
 in the formation and ultimate expansion of this Western European integrated
 community.  In addition, for the purposes of protecting the Third World,
 particularly the traditional interests in Africa, and ensuring, safeguarding
 and expanding the supply of raw materials as well as foreign markets and
 investments, the Western European countries must also reinforce their alli-
 ance to help them in world competition.
 Over the past 20 years, Western Europe has set up two economically inte-
 grated blocs one after another.  This illustrates that the economic integra-
 tion of monopoly capitalism in the Western European region has already
 obtained a fairly large development.  Their respective joint economic prac-
 tices embody the integrated structure for the international regulation of
 state monopoly capitalism inside each bloc.
 The European Economic Community was formed in 1958 by the six countries of
 France, West Germany, Italy, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg.  In 1973,
 Britain, Denmark and Ireland joined the community and in 1981 Greece was
 admitted.  Thus, it became a 10-nation community.  In the aspect of eco-
 nomic alliance,'the community first of all formed a tariff union to enable
 the industrial products of the member countries to be free of duties and to
 freely circulate in unlimited quantities within the group.  Externally, a
 common customs tariff was in force and a common market for industrial
 products was formed under the protection of a tariff wall.  On this basis,
 the coordination of the bloc's internal economic and social policies and
 the formulation of common policies were gradually carried out.  The direc-
 tion of development was aimed at the formation of an economic alliance.

 The European Free Trade Alliance was formed in 1960 by the seven countries
 of Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and Portugal.
 Afterward, Iceland joined while Finland became a "liaison member-nation."
 Its organizational form is that of a free trade zone of relatively low-level
 integration.  Between the member countries, their industrial products may
 freely circulate and are tax exempt.  Externally, there are no uniform
 tariff rates, and no common foreign trade policy has been formulated.  Up
 to now, the alliance has not yet reached the level of a tariff alliance,
 which was achieved much earlier by the community.
 The principal embodiment of economic integration is the carrying out inside
 the bloc of the international regulation of state monopoly capitalism.  As
 a community unit, this international regulation is first seen in the circu-
 lation sector.  In this connection, the basic activities are constituted by
 the setting up of a tariff alliance and a common market for agricultural
 products.  The reason why the community is also known as the Common Market
 is because it first of all and principally carries out international regu-
 lation of the sales market.
 To a certain degree, international regulation on the part of the community
 also touches on the production sector.  In this connection, it plays a
 relatively greater role in the agricultural sector.  The major points are
 the following:  It regulates agricultural production through fixing common
 prices for agricultural products whereby those in short supply are subsi-
 dized and those with a production surplus are subjected to intervention in
 sales and production.  It enables the agricultural products to maintain
 relatively higher prices and thus stimulates production, through levying a
 disparity tax on agricultural products from outside the bloc and granting
 a subsidy on the export of agricultural products.  It makes use of the
 common agricultural fund to support the revision of the agricultural struc-
 ture and to promote the expansion and modernized management of farms.  On
 the industrial side, direct planning and regulation are effected in such
 links as the distribution of raw materials, investment and production in
 the coal, steel and atomic energy industries.
 The development of the community's international regulation activities also
 extends to the distribution sector.  The community has set up its own
 community-level budget system.  The 1981 budget estimated revenues and
 expenditures at 20.8 billion Eurodollars (roughly equivalent to $25.6
 billion).  The member countries undertake to forward 90 percent of the
 customs duties they collect on industrial products and from the agricul-
 tural products price-disparity tax and up to 1 percent of the value-added
 tax to the community chest to constitute its budgetary revenue.  The
 budgetary expenditures are primarily devoted to the European agricultural
 sinking fund, the European regional development fund, the European social
 sinking fund and the European development-aid fund.  Its steadily increas-
 ing volumes of budgetary revenue and expenditure indicate to a certain
 degree some sort of international regulation over the redistribution of
 the member nations' national income.

 In order to ensure the free circulation of industrial and agricultural
 products inside the bloc and to avoid any undue influences on the fluctua-
 tions in currency value and exchange rates of the various countries, the
 community has extended its international regulation and intervention deep
 into the currency sector.  In the early 1970's, it formed an economic and
 currency alliance and initially coordinated the currency policies of the
 member countries.  In March 1979, the European currency system formally
 came-into being.  It stipulated the Eurodollar as the basic unit for
 settlement of accounts between the member countries and for reserve pur-
 poses.  The central exchange rate between the currencies of the member
 countries and the Eurodollar was fixed, and on this basis the reciprocal
 exchange rates of the various currencies were also determined.  A limit was
 placed on the fluctuations of the exchange rates of the member countries.
 A European currency sinking fund amounting to 25 billion Eurodollars was
 set up for the purpose of stabilizing the exchange rates between member
 countries.
 The community also extends its international regulation activities into the
 field of.external economic and trade relations.  While the tariff alliance
 and the common agricultural policies already embody various kinds of regu-
 lations governing foreign economic and trade relations applicable to the
 member countries, the community has additionally acted as a separate entity
 to establish formal relations and conclude trade agreements with third-party
 countries.  Up to now it has established formal relations with over 120
 countries and signed nearly 100 trade agreements of various kinds.  The
 community also pays special attention to coordinating relations with the
 developing countries.  Acting on the basis of the system of liaison coun-
 tries, which was already in force, the community successively signed, in
 1975 and 1979, trade agreements with scores of African, Caribbean and
 Pacific countries.  It conducted separate "talks," or signed trade and
 economic cooperation agreements, with the League of Arab Nations, the
 Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Andes Treaty Organization.
 The development of economic alliances naturally leads to and promotes
 political alliances.  In fact, the community countries have already
 achieved varying degrees of development in coordination and cooperation in
 such fields as politics, foreign affairs and security protection.
 The postwar economic integration tendency of monopoly capitalism reflects
 the developmental demands of the productive forces and the internationaliza-
 tion of economic life.  It reflects certain adjustments in international
 economic relations.  Hence, the economic alliance, in varying forms, of the
 economically integrated groups and the regulation of state monopoly capi-
 talist countries have necessarily affected economic development.
 .First, international regulation in the circulation sector has promoted the
 growth of trade inside the bloc.  For example, during the transitional
 period (1958-1969) following the community's formation of the tariff alli-
 ance, the gross value of its foreign trade averaged a growth rate of 11.5

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 percent annually, but the growth rate of trade between the member countries
 was as high as 16.5 percent.  From the end of the 1950's to the early
 1970's, the relative proportion of trade within the bloc in the gross value
 volume of the foreign trade of the member countries rose from 30 percent to
 over 50 percent.
 Second, the development of capital centralization and monopoly in the mem-
 ber countries has been accelerated.  Strengthening the economic alliance-
 and the gradual elimination of the limits of national markets have natu-
 rally intensified competition among the enterprises of the member countries.
 This in turn has forced the big enterprises to strengthen their monopoly
 alliance and to expand the scale of their production.  Governments of
 member countries have also adopted policies and measures to promote the
 expansion and merging of their enterprises in order to augment the competi-
 tive power of the monopoly capital of their own countries.  At the same
 time, in order to strengthen their competitive power with foreign, particu-
 larly American, monopoly capital, the community itself has encouraged the
 merging of corporations of the member countries and jointly forming
 European-scale corporations to. enhance resistance.  In. addition, the
 intensification of competition has also tended to bring about the conclu-
 sion of monopoly agreements of various sorts.
 Third, the development of the international division of labor within the
 bloc, of production specialization and of technological cooperation has
 been facilitated while an increase in the investment level has been pro-
 moted.  The internal markets of the group have been expanded and have
 developed in depth.  This has created advantageous conditions for the
 internal division of work within the departments and for specialized large-
 scale production.  In the early 1970's, in the internal trade within the
 community, 3/4 of the trade consisted of industrial finished products and
 semifinished products while under the European free trade alliance, this
 proportion was 4/5.  At the same time, after economic alliances were formed,
 progress has been made in coordination and cooperation in the fields of
 science and technology.  The results of development along these lines have
 naturally increased the labor productivity rate.
 Fourth, promotion of agricultural production has. been facilitated.  The   .
 community's implementation ofa common agricultural policy has expanded the
 internal and external markets of agricultural products and increased their
 production.  Reform of the agricultural structure along with production
 centralization has promoted the modernization of agricultural production
 and management.  During the period from the early 1960's to the early 1970's,
 the annual growth in the agricultural labor productivity rate of the origi-
 nal six members of the community was as high as 7.5 percent, and from 1958
 to 1975 the increase in agricultural production in the six countries was
 50 percent.  These figures are relatively high even among developed
 countries.
 Fifth, internationally, the economic and political comparative strength
 has been further changed.  The formation and development of the two Western
 European economic blocs have brought about a comparatively large increase in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 the economic strength of the Western European countries.  Take, for exam-
 ple, the European Economic Community.  In 1958, the value of industrial
 output and the gold and foreign exchange reserves of the six member coun-
 tries were about 1/2 those of the United States and the volume of their
 foreign trade about equaled that of the United States.  In 1979, the gross
 value of the internal production of the nine countries of the community
 exceeded that of the United States while the volume of their export trade
 and their gold and foreign exchange reserves surpassed those of the United
 States, respectively by 200 percent and over 500 percent.  Including the
 free trade zone, which has been organized by the community and which com-
 prises 18 European countries and the member countries of the European Free
 Trade Alliance, an extensive Western European economically integrated group,
 with the European Economic Community as the nucleus and comprising all the
 major Western European countries as members, has become a reality not to
 be ignored in the international economic arena.  Economic union has pro-
 pelled the Western European countries to cooperate.with each other in
 various fields and has raised the status and role of Western Europe in
 international affairs.  In this way, in'economic and political relations,
 Western Europe and the United States have basically acquired the status of
 equal partners.   Concurrently, this has become an important force stemming
 the progress of Soviet hegemonism.
 However, it can readily be seen that this type of alliance and regulation
 must necessarily meet with, and, in fact, has already met with, many complex
 contradictions and various kinds of limitations.  The reasons are:  First,
 this type of international regulation is based on the state monopoly capital-
 ism of the member countries, and the state monopoly capitalism of the vari-
 ous countries first and foremost serves the interests of the monopoly capital
 of their own countries.  The member countries have differences with regard
 to the degree of development, the principal, form, and the policy and meas-
 ures of regulation.  Besides, following the increase in the number of con-
 stituent members of the community, the disparities between them in economic
 development and economic structure have increasingly widened.  This impedes
 the implementation of common policies and the execution of supernational
 regulatory activities.  Second, the various countries all have in their
 respective countries certain economic levers which can affect reproduction.
 These might be said to include the system of ownership by the state, taxa-
 tion, investments, placing orders for goods, loans and so on, all of which
 are tools to intervene in and regulate the national economy.  Unfortu-
 nately, basically speaking, these are lacking in an integrated group.
 Third, an integrated group is an association of autonomous states.  Eco-
 nomic alliance and joint regulation cannot proceed without unanimity in
 negotiations, but the very socioeconomic basis of monopoly. capitalism
 causes an imbalance in development between the member countries and between
 the social groups and localities within the bloc.  Thus, contradictions
 occur frequently.  Take the European Economic Community for example.  Here
 contradictions exist not only between the big countries like France,
 Britain and West Germany, who are forever bickering among themselves in
 their struggle for economic interests and for leadership power, but also
 between the big and small countries, between the countries which have
 achieved varying degrees of development, and between countries which export

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100290001-6
 industrial products and countries which export, besides industrial
 products, large quantities of agricultural products.  Naturally, contradic-
 tions are inherent between different monopoly capital. blocs,. between indus-
 trial areas and agricultural areas, and between developed localities and
 still backward localities.  These contradictions cannot be eliminated just
 by regulatory activities between countries.  On the contrary, under the new
 conditions, new contradictions and conflicts tend to continuously arise.  In
 recent years, contradictions have been especially apparent in regard to such
 problems as the common agricultural policy and the. community budget.  In
 fact, the existence and development of contradictions within the bloc have
 delayed .the conclusion of certain integration agreements, and have hindered
 and even disrupted the implementation of certain fixed policies.  In par-
 ticular, during periods when crises of a cyclical nature erupted, the con-
 tradictions and conflicts between the member countries intensified and in
 turn caused losses to the alliance and the regulatory activities.  Because
 of the above-mentioned factors, the development of West European economic
 integration has been far from smooth.  Since the 1974-1975 world economic
 crisis, with the exception of the formation in 1979 of the European currency
 system, progress in economic integration has almost come to a standstill,
 and even progress in the European currency system has been slow.  It has
 developed very slowly and has been.confrontedwith many problems because
 of the economic recession in recent years, the high interest rates in the
 United States, and the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar.
 In short, the economic integration of monopoly capitalism,-as seen in the
 formation and development of the two economic blocs of Western Europe, con-
 stitutes a partial change within the sphere of the capitalist production
 form in the international production relations of capitalism of the present
 era..  Its properties determine that it must be subjected to the economic
 laws of capitalism and that it cannot resolve the basic contradictions of
 capitalism, far less the unbalanced development of capitalism and the con-
 tradictions and conflicts existing between the monopoly capitalist coun-
 tries.  Therefore, it may be said that the economic integration of monopoly
 capitalism has a dual character.  On the one hand, it can regulate inter-
 national production relations to suit the socialization of production and
 the development of productive force and, on the other hand, it can promote
 centralization and monopoly and further intensify the contradictions of
 capitalism.  As we all know, state monopoly capitalism constitutes the high-
 est form of socialization of capital relations within the sphere of the
 capitalist production form.  A step further forward will refute this produc-
 tion form itself.  Integrated economic alliance and international regulation,
 as the developed pattern of the internationalization of state monopoly capi-
 talism, have developed on the basis of the internationalization of economic
 life and, in fact, have promoted the further development of the inter-
 nationalization of economic life.  At the same time, they have in reality
 provided the material logical premise and preparations for the eventual
 realization of a united world economic system based on the.system of public
 ownership and highly socialized. This shows the historical position and
 role of the economic integration of monopoly capitalism.
