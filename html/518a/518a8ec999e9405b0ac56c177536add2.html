 i3riefly Noted
 Defense of Private Agriculture in Poland
 Howe Drogi, the main theoretical organ of the Polish
 Communes Party, has published a lengthy defense of private
 peasant farming by TJlieczyslaw Mieszczankowski, a leading pro-
 ponent of non-collectivized agriculture since the 1956 upris-
 ing.                Both the article's length and its publication in Rowe
 Drogi would seem to mark it as a basic, if not definitive,
 per a congress "white paper" on agriculture.
 The new article is actually an extension of Elieszczankowski' ;
 argument, advanced in a series of Zycie Gospodarcze articles
 last year, against a reorganization ofPolish agri ulture which
 would build the countryside around state farms and lead to the
 eventual dissolution of the private peasant economy.  The de-
 matic wing of the Polish Party has been arguing for some time
 that, since collectivization has met with failure in Poland and
 will probably never be attempted again, state farms afford the
 best remaining opportunity to introduce public ownership in the
 countryside.   [See unclassified attachment "Polish Economist Sayj
 Communist Socialized Agriculture Cannot Succeed" for summary of
 arguments. 7
 We cite the IIowe Drogi article as an indication that Polane
 is officially abandoning Communist agricultural collectivization
 as an unworkable theory and a proven failure.  We also: note that
 dogmatic Communists, refusing the evidence of pragmatic tests
 and disregarding the welfare of the people, still attempt to
 maintain their ?arty control over the economic life of the coun-
 try.

 CO MUNIST DISSENSIONS
 23 May-S June 1964
 1.  Soviet, and pro-Soviet media during this period continued
 to propagate intensively the Soviet position and to denounce the
 Chinese, although mostly not going beyond previous polemics.
 Soviet Goverment daily Izvestiya featured a series of editori-
 als:                 May 30, describing an castigating Chinese efforts to.sub-
 vert, soviet citizens; June 3, implying that the Chinese are re-
 moving themselves from .the socialist camp and nullifying the
 provisions,oj the Sino-Soviet alliance; and June 5, saying that
 "one cannot put up with" the uncoordinated acts of some which
 involve the intere$ts of other fraternal states and damage the
 commion line of the socialist countries -- and it lists "behind-
 the-scenes intrigues and "concealed speculations" in foreign
 trade, the  wor? of mass organizations, and sports (for the
 first time) among the Chinese sins.  In addition  o a steady
 stream of endorsements of the CPSU position by other parties,
 Pravda published (Hay 24) an emotional niece by prominent writer
 S.aonov describing Chinese efforts to subvert "Soviet us" and
 ringingly declaring that they will fail, and a 2-part reprint
 (June 3-4) of a major article from 3?artiynaya Zhizn (Party Life)
 which outlines the case against the     nese "Fegemonist-snlitters,"
 stresses the obligation of Communists to adhere to international
 Communist di      ine     voluntarily, estates the need for a
 new interne aLo  ,. conference, an  calls for collective efforts
 by the M-L parties to remove the threat of a split caused by
 the subversive activities of the CCP.   It said that "the over-
 whelming majority" of world parties are with the CPSU and that
 "a majority" favor calling a conference as soon as possible.
 The June J{ommunjst published excerpts of statements supporting
 the Cu..SU by 5  parties, not including some known to be pro-
 Soviet, and Problems of,Peace and Socialism added several more.
 2.  On May 26, Radio Belgrade's Moscow correspondent, com-
 menting on the announced plans for Oast German boss Ulbricht to
 go to Moscow May 29 (for his 3rd visit this year   said   a
 Moscow circles view it as the beginning of a new round of mutual
 visits preparatory to a world conference, which coulc'""be held
 before the end of the year.  His comment seemed to be borne out
 as a new, high-level Rumanian Party delegation went to Moscow
 on the same day (26th ,f, a Bulgarian high-level ?arty delegation
 went on June 4, and Tito de ours -from Finland to meet Khrushch3_,
 in Leningrad on June U.
 3.  The Chinese struck back only once -- but apparently
 with considerable force -- during this period, with a brief,

 (voiiimentary Cont.)
 pungent Sovernment statement dated 3C May in response to the
 Soviet Government s a even  a month earlier denouncing Chinese
 opposition to USSR participation in the Second Afro-Asian Con-
 ference.  The Chinese demonstra a that the Soviet Union is a
 1,uronean power and cannot have it both ways,  point to the
 precedent set at the 7irst A-A Conference in Bandung when the
 U SOY, was not invited (T1ehru quoe? with aonro v~al on reasons
 r,hy not) and still supnortela it,' and      what has changed to
 cause the Soviet leaders to adopt a now attitude now.  They
 assert that if the Soviet leaders 'have t"the least respect" for
 A-A countries, and their decisions at Djakarta, they should
 not "carp and cavil and attempt to overthrow this conclusion
 through crude interference."  The Chinese is'~ rhetorically what
 difference there is between the Soviet attitude toward A- . and
 that of the '7estern Lowers, and question Soviet motives "in
 persistently wanting to squeeze into the Second A-A Conference."
 "The times when the Asian and African countries coul-~ )e or deredd
 about by 'others are gone forever."
 4. In t:3, possibly significant move, the Soviet 7'oreign Minis--
 try took. a large ground of forei n diplomatic chiefs from L oscow
 on a tour o:f Alma-Ata afid vicinity, capital of the   azak i S5L,,
 largest of the Soviet  ventral Asian republics, lying just across
 the disputed border from Chinese Sinkiang.
 S.  Among the other Communist-ruled countries, another
 group of Chinese workers departed from Mongolia, the Czechs
 denounced Chinese interference in their internal affairs, --
 and the '*.umanians appeared to be moving still furthar toward
 in.'epen?dence of the USSR, signing an extensive economic co-
 operation pact with the US, exploring possibilities for a
 relationship with the 71estern Agreement on Tariffs and  rade
 (GATT), etc.  ?erhaps even more significant, on June 5 monitors
 pie'tad up a Bucharest domestic broadcast in Rumanian which re-
 butted and denounced a May 30 Moscow Rumanian-language broad-
 cast entitled "let Us Strengthen the Socialist Community" --
 although Bucharest identified radio Moscow only as "a foreign
 radio station."  Oress reports of a recent Ithrushchev secret
 tri-i to Bucharest in an effort to unseat Gheor hiu-Dej are not
 confirmed, although such an effort might have been made several
 years ago.)
 FBIS reports that radio Poking broadcast the texts of
 the 7 C?SU and CCp letters, which it released on S May,  1, 300
 times by the end of the month, almost as often as the 14 June
 L303 CC? letter (1,113 times).  With the beginning of June,
 Peking's transmitters shifted to massive dissemination of the
 30 t':ay CM Government statement [see ward 3 above].

 to in-
 jhq Q.oyiat Union to the Second A-A Conference and re-
 ed. to eude attar   and abuses against the prticipants.
 A11, its arguments boil down to the following:             the
 Soviet Union is an Asian power and, must participate in the
 Asian-Afr.p,An Conference; to object to its participation
 means to "divide" the forces fighting against imperialism,
 4nd tp, ?Qyi,et. Union will make a "rebuff."  These fiords
 are wrong in their point of departure, absurd in logic, and
 rtdiculou~ ,in couglusioz s.
 The C   ,statement refers to Soviet description of the
 enorr9t4s .size of its territory in Asia.   "Does the fact that
 all the large Asian states coup? fit into the Asian part of the
 US I. give It more say than all the Asian and African countries
 put together?  Size cannot frighten anybody .... In international
 relations each state is a single entity and can have only one
 political center."  IJeaw ly three-fourths of Soviet population
 live in Europe:  the political center of the Soviet Union as a
 single entity has always been in Europe and therefore it has
 traditionally bgen; acZtnvrledged as ?n  uropean country.
 i
 The statement points to the first A-A conference in
 Bandung, where "the Soviet Union as a whole was not invited,"
 "nor were its union republics in Asia," and it quotes the late
 Dime Minister U3hru in 1954:   "Soviet Asia was not invited
 because Politically it is part of a 3uropean unit, namely the
 Soviet Union."  9e was quite right," say the Chinese.   !lore-
 ovex, the Soviets supported the Bandung conference without be-
 ing invited.                       "On what grounds can the Soviet leaders insist
 on being invited to the second... ?What changes have taken place
 ...?  Can it be that the capital of the Soviet Union has been
 moves froia Tti oscoc} t  Vlac ivosto .... ?",
 The Chinese elaborate on the "racism" issue, asking what
 kind of. racism -- yellow, black, or unity of the yellow and
 black against the white -- and pointing out that among the
 participants at Djakarta were "quite a few countries whose
 population is mostly White.',
 The statement then takes tide offensive:
 In frantically vilifying China and behaving as if the
 D jal:arta meeting had been manipulated by China single-
 handed, do you still acknowledge the existence of the other
 A-A countries?  In what position do you want to -place the
 other 21 countries....?
 If the Soviet leaders have the least respect for
 A-A countries, they should first of all res-pee  this con-
 clusion...and should not carp and cavil and attempt to

 traces the road,of the present-day   lid, who, at the 1O Z3
 conference, "in their correspondence with the leading organs cf
 fraternal parties        and also by distributing propaganda
 material, ...tried to. force on _all CPs their own particular anti-

 more and more openly to various hinds of unpleasant devices --
 slander, bribery, and blackmail -- thus trying to bring under
 its influence at least some of the Communists from other coun-

 The article,, after tracing the road taken by the CCP from
 196'3 through 1933, turns to Lenin as authority on three signs

 say that "the 1CM is allegedly in the process of selection,
 crystallization, and consolidation, and that at the present
 time there exist four types of Communist and workers parties."
 (The M-L party; a party where the leadership is controlled by
 revisionists but in which exists an M-L opposition; a party
 under complete control of revisionists, while M-Ls expelled
 form M-L groups; and a party in'which the leadership is re-
 visionist but alongside which a new CP has formed -- the
 Indonesian formulation.)
 "Some comrades think they can maintain contact with all
 the groups and parties mentioned above, and are appealing to
 others to do the same.  Thus they are in effect supporting a
 sort of Communist multiparty system.  But where can such an
 arrangement lead to in practice?  Some say toward a selection,
 toward the breeding of new varieties.  But wasn't the type of

 the right to elevate these factional subversive organizations
 working against the Communist movement to the rank of CPs?..."
 The article notes the "highly significant" way the
 editors of the London ~F~ipnaaucial Times describe the Chinese
 aims:  "the Chinese leaders have been using Marxism-To-771'"s'-
 guise their military and expansionist aims.
 What to do about it?  The article stresses the obligations
 of Communists to adhere  o international Communist discipline --
 voluntarily, in to                          spirit of Lenin, and in accordan   with
 evaluations and conclusions collectively worked out in
 tha international conferences.
 To remove the threat of the split hanging over the
 VICM, the Chinese leaders must return to the general plat-

 struggle against M-t parties, an  EEre   ? settle inter-
 party differences within the framework of                        enin s norms....
 A new international conference of Communists could
 be a new, important stage in the struggle for unity.  The
 majority of the worlds Cps are  in favor of calling one
 as soon as possible, ...The Chinese leaders are increasingly
 and openly seeking to postpone the calling of a conference.
 ...To remove the threat ofr a split created by the C6;Ps

 793.  Lysenkkois?  Still Lives Ctn.
 rACKGROlNi'D:  Marxism represses science.            For scientific
 researb and tnoug   to progress, a  is essential that there
 be no "unthinkable thoughts," no dogmas which cannot be ques-
 tioned, and no fear among scientists that they may be punished
 for unpopular findings.  Marxism professes to be scientific,
 but it is really a dogmatic theory, not verified by experience,
 and not open to revision. From time to time, Marxist dogma
 has collided with scientific work, since the latter has de-
 valop_3ed rapidly in the last century, while the former has--at
 least in theory--stood still.  For many years, Marxist theo-
 reticians contested Einsteints theories, believing them to be
 idealist (as opposed~`.o m~ to  alist); the concept of cybernetics
 net for a time with similar hostility.  Official Marxism      ism
 has reversed itself by now on these two questions, nuclear phys-
 ics and control techniques being fields too important to a
 Great Power to permit dogmatic foot-dragging.  But in biology
 and particularly in genetics, the CPSU still supports the pseudo-
 scientific doctrines of Trofim Denisovich Lysenko, usually
 cared"Michurin science" in the Soviet Union, after the scien-
 tifically-ignorant Soviet plant-breeder, Ivan Vladinirovich
 Michurin (1655-1935).
 Inherited V3. Acquired characteristics.  iviichurinism is
 based on the doctrine-that acquired c aracteristics can be in-
 herit:,1.                        Marx had already warmly embraced this doctrine, which
 was lr3 d by many scientists in his time.  He acclaimed the work
 of Darwin and sought (unsuccessfully) to get Darwin's agrerment
 to having Das Kapital dedicated to him; at the same time 1;1rirx
 scornfully-s' ism ssed the theories of Thomas Malthus on po :~ula-
 tion, which had partly inspired Darwin's vwork.  But at the end
 of the nineteenth century, the discoveries of the Austrian monk
 Gregor Mendel became widely known in professional circles and,
 amplified by the work of other biologists, such as August
 t7eismann and T. 12. Morgan, these findings indicated that ac-
 quired characteristics could not be inherited.    Handel's theory
 was that heredity is transmitTee  by discrete living particles,
 which later became known as genes, and scientific research d?-
 mon.strat:ed by 1915 that the chromosomes of the cell nucleus con-
 sist of thousands of these elements, each located in a linear
 order which can be mapped.  The adaptation of a living organism
 to its external onvircm-:aent in no way affected its genes.
 Mendelian genetics were repellent to good Marxists, for
 several reasons.
 1.  The theory, especially as developed by twentieth century
 research, was too complicated; non-specialists who were
 political activists cou   not understand it themselves,

 cated experimenters like Luther Burbank, Michurin, and
 Lysenko likewise failed to understand the Mendelian theory,
 or the evidence which supported it.
 2.  Mendel, like Malthus, was a cleric; indeed Mendel was
 a monk.  Other proponents of Mendelianism were  our ;eois
 sc?en fists, without "social consciousness." Always in-
 clined to see things in black-and-white, good vs. bad
 terms, Marxists identified their own views with science
 and materialism, and identified Mendelianism with meta-
 physics and idealism.  They distorted the Mendelian theory
 to make it seem that the germ plasm or the genes were a
 spiritual element, like a soul.
 A.  Mendelian genetics outdated views expressed by Marx
 and angels.
 4.  The denial that acquired characteristics could be trans-
 mitted to later generations ran counter to Marxist plans
 to rebuild society over a short Tier o , to creams o  creat-
 Ing a   err SAM Man,  an   o s- erles for rapid re-
 education of every kind.
 Although most Western scientists had accepted Mendelianism by
 the time of the Bolshevik revolution, Soviet scientists made
 valiant eff-s to show the inheritability of acquired charac-
 teristics.     The psychologist F.V. Pavlov tried to show that an
 acquired ability to learn could be transmitted; a serious and
 competent scientist, he admitted by 1927 that his experiments
 had not proven the point.  Michurin, and after him, Lysenko
 claimed to have created new plant species over a short period;
 their claims are believed to have rested on poor experimental
 techniques and, at least in Lysenko's case, on falsification.
 A notorious case was that of an Austrian zoologist,Paul Kammerer,
 who claimed to have changed the color of salamanders; he evades"
 an examination of his specimens for seven years, and after they
 were finally checked (in 1926) and shown to have been painted
 with India ink, he committed suicide.  At the time of his ex?-
 posure, Kammerer had accented an appointment to head an insti-
 tute in Moscow.  Perhaps partly because of this experience, a
 strong and able school of Mendelian geneticists was permitted
 to work in the Soviet Union in the '20's and early '30's, led
 by Uikolai Ivanovich Vavilov.
 Stalin represses science.  But a new school arose under
 Stalin, associating itself rr th the name of Michurin and led
 by Lysenko.  Whatever his shortcomings as a scientist, Lysenko
 was and is an able politician and propagandist.  He managed to
 got Vavilov exiled and imprisoned:  Vavilov died in a concentra-
 tion camp in 1963.  Lysenko's theory appealed to the xenophobia
 of Stalin and Zhdanov, and in 1943, this theory became official;
 the few remaining adherents of Mendelian genetics either recante
 or were removed from their positions.  Biological research in the

 Khrushchev supports controversial Lyrsen'ko.  Some revival
 of genetics took p ace after Stalin's  ea  , and it has been
 possible for Soviet biology to recover some of the ground it
 had lost when Mendelians were branded public enemies.  But since
 the consolidation of KKhrushchev's position, Lysenko has suc-
 ceeded to a degree in consolidating his position as well.  Khru-
 shchev has a fondness for "Practical" scientists who "get the
 work out," and Lysenko has pandered to this taste, claiming
 fabulous results for his Lenin Hills experimental farm, espe-
 cially in grain production and in raising (through breeding)
 the butterfat content of miles,:.  Of course, Lysenko's farm's pro-
 duction (if the figures are accurate at all) is attained by a
 lavish use of the best materials and equipment, and an intensive
 expenditure of man-hours.  But at the slightest criticism of
 Lysenko, Khrushchev points to Lysenko's figures and tells the
 other experts to go to Lenin Hills and learn.
 Ideology continues to block Soviet biological science.   In
 1-larch      a     erary journal, Neva, printed an article, "Pro-
 spects of Soviet Genetics," by . zI  "l~edvedev and V. ICirpichni?cov
 [see unclassified attachment for text].  This article gave an
 excellent layman's survey of modern genetics, and without nar4a-
 iag Lyysenko, attacked the isolation of Soviet biology from world
 biology as survival of the cult of personality.  But other
 Soviet scientists failed to come to the support of these writero,
 and on 13 August, Sel'skaya Shizn (rural Life) printed a force-
 ful criticism by 11-,A-.70 spans ay, a  a-  fu             Lysenko follower
 who occupies LysenL.o's old position as President of the V. 1.
 Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences.  Olshansky
 concluded that a s,3irit of conciliation between Michurin genet-
 ics and "classical" (i.e., Mendelian) genetics was "impermissi-
 ble in biology" and that the Medvedev-Kirpichnikov article "must
 be considered mistaken and harmful for our science."  Neva re-
 winted the Olshansk.iy article in September, along swit=note
 of apology; by October, more than half of Neva's editorial
 board had been replaced.  Other signs contin~o show the ef-
 forts of the Lysenkoites to enforce conformity:  for example,
 a recent book, Genetics, by M. il. Lobashev, was sharply denounce,':
 in a review of     March 1964 as an attempt "to revive the old
 idealistic, metaphysical V1eismann-Mendel-L orb an genetic theory."
 True, there has been a real change since the days when
 Vavilov died in a concentration camp.  Today, much worthwhile
 Soviet material is published with a ritual bow in the direction
 of P ,Iichurin.  Biochemical science in the rest of the world has
 in recent years witnessed exciting advances with research on
 l ITA (desoxyribonucleic acid) and Ei?A (ribonucleic acid) ; L"rNA
 molecular chains appear to provide a sort of genetic code or (in
 the couriuter sense) program, and indeed seem to be the material
 counterpart of the theoretical concert of the genes.  The Soviet
 biologists are well aware of these developments, and even  Lysenko
 himself tries to incorporate DNA into his own system.  In a sense,
 molecular biology may ultimately serve Soviet purposes, since it

 BACKGROUND:   `here is no detente in the cold war with the
 greemen s have  een made in
 Soviet  non althoug        a series of agreement-s-
 an attempt to reduce the nuclear arms race and to create a
 pore favorable political climate in preparation of settling
 the truly crucial issues.  These limited agreements (e.g. re-
 duced production of fissionable materials for military purposes,:,
 limited nuclear test ban, the US-USSR Consular agreement) are
 hopeful signs but they do not yet touch the heart of the crucial
 issues (e.g. disarmament, German questions) nor do they indicate
 any trend in Soviet foreign policy away from the goal of Com-
 munist world domination.
 US and free world-'s" teps toward rapprochement with the
 Soviet Union could be interpreted in many countries as more
 significant than they are with respect both to our policy and
 to the intentions of Khrtishchevts CPSU.  To the extent that this
 is the case, such countries may rush into relations with the
 USSR and Eastern European Communist countries which expose
 them to undue influence and penetration; or they may pressure
 the major powers to make sweeping agreements with the USSR
 which lack controls and verification (e.g. disarmament with-
 out inspection, German agreements without protection for Berlin
 or self-determination for people of Fast Germany, non-agression
 pacts with predatory and unreliable countries such as Cuba and
 Communist China).
 CPSU Position and Polic .  The Soviet Union recognizes the
 restraints place3 oil-large scale direct aggressive action by
 a determined free world possessing destructive military capabi-
 lities at least equal to its own.  But it is not clear that
 CPSU leadership is equally cognizant of the danger of limited
 war (e.g. Communist supported insurrection within countries or
 between "third" countries) -- which it has not renounced.  F3or
 can we rely upon the Soviet leaders' ability to calculate
 correctly what the free world response in the event of communist
 agression in one part of the world or another is likely to be.
 Firm, explicit US and western policies are one attempt to pre-
 vent Soviet miscalculation and the agreement on the "hot line"
 between Washington and Moscow is at least a recognition by the
 Kremlin that miscalculation is a possibility.
 In the long run, it is possible that a Soviet policy of
 indirect aggression and subversion is more dangerous than direct
 aggressions.  Faced by a belligerent Communist China demanding a
 sow down on revolutionary doctrine in a struggle for power

 over the Communist movement on the one side and by restless
 Eastern 2uropean countries and peoples, increasingly caressing
 for political and economic autonomy, on the other, Khrushchev's
 CPSU must prove success for its "peaceful coexistence" policy --
 that is, indirect subversion in all of its aspects.
 The CPSU is attempting to develop as many normal relations
 as possible with non-Communist countries -- and particularly
 hey nations in the developing areas, e.g. Algeria, UAf, Ghana
 Indonesia.   Its major purpose in such relations is to penetrate
 and indoctrinate, subvert to insurrection and by other means
 to impose cc.amunist systems.
 Aggressive, anti-imperialist Soviet foreign policies.
 Khrus          "neaceXuj-                           advocating ostensibly
 reasonable and normal relations with other countries in many
 respects, also continues aggressive actions against the free
 world and democratic institutions.   It males little difference
 whether Soviet attp.clrus on the free world are rationalized as
 necessary (1) to maintain the USSR's status in the Communist
 world and to offset Chicom charges that Khrushchev and the
 CPSU are soft on capitalism, or (2) to quiet real or purported
 pressi res within the US S11. itsief. The attacks and the pos-
 sible consequences are real in either case.  Further, the
 rationalizations tend to make Khrushchev's overtures more ac-
 ceptable to many and to promote a peaceful image for the USS
 in contrast to belligerent Communist dogmatists and Mao's CM?,
 ''71hether Khrushchev might be moving toward a tougher line
 is a moot question.  That he is continuing hxs attacks on the
 Test in general and the US in particular is a fact.  The Soviet
 Union's not so peaceful coexistence practices are found in many
 places.  Some of these are as follows:
 Indochina.  The CPSU charges the US with aggression in Vietnam
 and C,,ia7odia, blames it for the crisis in Laos and claims it
 has a plan to invade that country.  Moscow endorses Sihanouk
 and favors the ?athet Lao and VietCong, though presumably wary
 of Chicorn victory through these forces in Indochina.  All US
 attempts to assist the struggling Indochina countries to defeat
 the brutal, outright aggression from the northern Communists
 are interpreted as US imperialism.
 Ambassador L edorenko, speaking to the United Nations on
 21 P;! ay 100: charged that  the US made "war against the peo-
 ple of Vietnam" committed "aggressive actions" against
 Cambodians, and "stubbornly violated" the Geneva Agreements
 of 10054, which violation led in the case of Cambodia to
 "this meeting of the Security Council."  quarry Schwartz

 M-overflights of Cuba contains extxem" statements which also
 give pause to the view of a Soviet policy of rapprochement with
 the US.  Khrushchev, supporting Castro's threats to shoot down
 American reconnaissance planes, says among otter things that
 the overflights are a contravention of the US-Soviet agreement of
 October 1362, that :Cuba has the right to Soviet weapons to pro-
 tect its sovereignty, and that there can be no real improvement
 in ^oviet-American relations unless the US respects Cuban
 sovereignty.  The facts are that Cuba has never allowed the in-
 spection agreed to in the Kennedy"hruszchev understanding of
 1OS2; that Khrushchev assists, and, through his intelligence
 services, actively participates in :astro's policy of encourarg'nL;
 and assisting insurrection (with Soviet bloc weapons) against
 legal Latin American governments; and that he otherwise en-
 courages or allows Castro's vehement attacks on the US (even
 sugesting that the US prepares bacterial warfare -- a charge
 now appearing in SEA also).

 exploit other countries, interfere in Cyprus and abridge Cuba's
 sovereignty; stated that the CPS has the right to Taiwan; and op-
 posed all forms of colonialism (i.e. the purported neo-colonial#s.a
 of the US in particular).
 In another communique signed with Algerian Premier Ben Bella

 by greorah ng Liu ,~ iao-chi. as Mao's appointed successor.   In 1059
 Mao turned over to Liu the chairmanship of the Government while
 retaining the more important post of party chairman.  Although
 the duties of the C??fl chairman are largely ceremonial,  t.-  s
 transfer enhanced Liu's prestige by making him nominal chief
 of state.  Liu has also been allowed to act as China's foremost
 i~feological spokesman  after Mao of course.  Liu however is 36,
 nearly as old and frail as Mao.  Even if he should achieve a
 successful takeover from Mao it would necessarily be as a care-
 ta.ka  administration.                      Liu certainly does not have the status
 to appoint his own successor as Mao has done.
 There are, moreover, other factors that mare it uncertain
 whether even Mao can successfully install Liu as his successor.
 When a legendary leader like Mao has dominated the Party for
 such a long time, the moment he dies or is effectively removed
 from leadership, the environment changes so drastically that
 any cosparison with the situation that existed just before his
 death is invalid.  Many who were willing and able to work har-
 moniously together under  Sao's tutelage may suddenly find that
 they are no longer able to find common goals and objectives.
 It is one thing to hold a regime together on the basis of re-
 volutionary comradeship and zeal developed in the hard school
 of the Long March and the caves of `:.rerun.   It is quite another
 thing to weld a new leadership out of those who have witnessed

 This group of die-hard Stalinists advocates overly ambitious
 industrial and economic goals, but a series of economic disasters
 in the past fete years has forced them to retreat somewhat.  They
 are concerned lest this period of retreat cause ideological de-
 viations and bring "revisionisu" into their "pure" Marxism-
 Luainism.  That is why the Chinese Party and the Chinese people
 are still being subjected to political campaigns against "class
 enemies," e.g. the socialist educational campaign.
 Premier Chou En-lai heads what is apparently a comparatively

 mander of the Public Security Force anster of public
 Security.e is currently the Army Chief of Staff and a member
 of. the party Central Secretariat.   Els support will be very
 valuable to any group in a struggle for power.
 The Second Generation:  Another major aspect of the suc-
 cession pros em  n Ccm iunist China is the average age of the 13
 members of the Chicot politburo -- most are in their late 60s
 or 73s and the average age is over 35.  No attempt has been made
 to bring gradually second echelon leaders into the top bureau-
 cracy and train thou for ultimate leadership.  The top 40 men
 in the ?arty are all in the older age-group and only below that
 level are there any noticeably younger men, men in the 50-58
 year age group.  There is twofold significance in this fact:
 First, these younger men may react strongly when the legendary
 Mao is removed from the scene.  They may rebel against the "Yentn
 caves" mentality of their elders and seek to put the nation on
 ghat they consider to be a sounder, more balanced economic path.
 Second, and perhaps even more important, this age gap would mean
 that the ton post may change hands several times in the next fete
 years.  Because of the advanced age of the contenders for the
 top post, Mao's successor may find the extreme burdens of high
 command more than he can adjust to and carry successfully at
 such an age.   If this should happen it would further stimulate
 second-generation leaders to seek the top post for one of their
 group.  Thus it would not be unlikely to see three or four new
 ?arty chairmou rise to the surface in the period between now an6
 1933 or 1970.

 1W,be.   Communists Foment Racial Hatred in British Guiana
 After living in relative harmony for many years, the two
 major races -- East Indian and Negro -- that make up the po-'ula-
 tion of British Guiana are locked in a deadly struggle that has
 brought about the declaration of a state of emergency and the
 dispatch of additional British troops to the colony.
 The immediate cause of the current outbreak is the strike
 of sugar cane   rkers  called 12 February 1964? by the Guiana
 Agricultural Workers Union (GAW TJ) , a scab union controlled by
 the party in power, in protest over the fact that a rival union,
 the i anpow,er Citizens Association (PICA) is and has for many
 years been recognized by management and by the British Guiana
 Trade Union Congress (BGTUC) as the responsible bargaining
 agency.
 The current strike is more an excuse than a genuine cause.
 The subversive activities of the Jagan Party's Progressive Youth:
 Organization (PYO),is a similar direct cause.  The P"?O is re-
 sponsible for      most of the a r~ oc  ies committed against the
 Negro population and for the sabotage against the canefields.
 The roots of the conflict are rather political and ideological.
 They go back to the impasse created by the 1961 elections, in
 which the Peoples Progressive Party (?PP) of Cheddi Jagan won
 a majority of the seats in the assembly.  Jagan, a self-confesse:a
 Marxist who has given every indication that he is a bona fide
 to consolidate his power and prepare the colony for eventual
 collectivization under a Castro-Communist government.
 The 1961 elections were held under a district system,
 whereby the winner of the majority of the votes in a given
 electoral district -- whether by a large or a small majority
 -- would win the assembly seat.  Such a system favored the
 Indians, who lived scattered in small towns with relatively
 small majorities, as against the Negroes (or Africans, as they
 prefer to call themselves), most of whom live crowded together
 in Georgetown.  The PPP, with 42.6q% of the votes, received 23
 seats in the 35-man assembly against 15 for the two opposition

 Polish 13conomist Says
 Communist Socialized Agriculture Cannot Succeed
 The main theoretical organ of the Polish Communist Party
 Howe Drogi has published a long article which shows, on the
 lia-sis-o-f7solish experience, why private farms are more produc-
 tive than socialized (i.e. either collectives or state farms).
 This article is an extension of L ieczyslaw Hieszczankowslai's
 argusaont presented in a series of Zycie Gospodarcze articles
 last year against reorganizing Polish agriculture.  Me. has been
 a leading proponent of non-collectivized agriculture since the
 Polish 1956 uprising.
 In the Howe Drogi article, apparently written to counter
 proposals of- o'gm'a`tic Communists to reorganize the private pea-
 sant farms into state farms, 11ieszczanltowski presents the fol-
 loving arguments:
 a.   The nationalization of land and investment goods is
 not an end in itself; the main purpose of socializing
 agriculture is to ensure greater productivity.
 b.   Poland, since 1956, has achieved greater productivity
 without nationalizing land and equipment, while at the
 same time avoiding "the negative effects which some-
 time accompany the socialization of production forces."
 c.   Under present Polish conditions, large-scale collec-
 tivized agricultural units are clearly not superior to
 the peasant economy.  Large socialist farms produce less
 at greater cost than medium (5-13 hectare) private Jhrm3.
 Until Poland has sufficient investment funds to pour in-
 to large enterprises, they will remain inferior as re-
 ards productivity to the smaller farms.   "In this situ-
 ation it is impossible to implement the socialization
 of land - - - it is impossible to replace the individual
 peasant farms by large agricultural enterprises."
 The author recommends that State influence on agricultural
 production be along such lines as purchase of machinery and
 judiciously applied loans from the Agricultural Development fund
 to loosely-knit country cooperatives.

 words. Condensed text:) Genetics is the science that studies
 the phenomena of heredity and variability. Many people are
 acquainted with the controversy that has been going on steadily
 for more than thirty years now in the field of genetics. There
 are two schools of genetics in our country: classical genetics,
 which is often called "formal," and another school that rejects
 the chromosome theory of heredity.*
 At the much-talked-of session of the All-Union Academy of
 Agricultural Sciences in 1948 the principle of the class nature
 of biology-the principle that there are fundamental differences
 between Soviet genetics and the genetics of Western countries
 that must be recognized, the principle of the irreconcilability
 of various schools in genetics-was put forward and applied.
 This principle was vigorously endorsed at the time by Stalin.
 Classical genetics was pronounced a bourgeois science and
 thus found itself "outlawed."
 Fourteen years have passed since then, and all this time the
 dominant positions, especially in the educational sphere, have
 been controlled in our country and the people's democracies
 by representatives of the new school of genetics. Meanwhile,
 classical genetics has continued to develop and has scored
 great victories. The greatest discovery of recent years has
 owr~ been the deciphering of the physical and chemical nature of
 the chromosomes, the cell (nuclear) structures that are the
 basis of heredity. The role of these structures in the synthe-
 sis of proteins has been clarified, and scientists are now at
 grips with the problem of controlling that synthesis. Genetic
 laws have been very important as clues to the nature of
 many serious diseases of man and for the improvement of
 methods of diagnosing, preventing and treating them. The
 progress of classical genetics has led to major advances in
 agriculture. There has been a revolution in the propagation of
 corn, sugar beets and other extremely valuable crops. Poultry
 and pig raising, the breeding of fur-bearing animals and many
 other branches of animal husbandry are being reorganized
 under the impact of genetics.
 The time has come to take stock, to see the reasons for the
 burgeoning of classical genetics all over the world and to as-
 sess the outlook for the further development of this important
 branch of science.

 In January of this year the Party Central Committee and the
 U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers adopted a special resolution on
 measures for the further development of biological science
 and the strengthening of its ties with practice.t A great deal
 of attention is given in it to genetics. Genetics should hold a
 fitting place of honor in the Soviet Union. All the advances of
 present-day genetics should be applied to our country's econ-
 omy. This is the patriotic duty of Soviet scientists.
 The History of the Gene Theory.-Classical genetics devel-
 oped at the end of the 19th century as a unitary world science,
 like physics, chemistry, geology, botany and other branches
 of natural science. Its laws reflect the nature of certain bio-
 logical phenomena and are therefore (like the laws of any
 other science) the same for the scientists of all countries.
 The basic postulate of genetics in the first half of the 20th
 century was, as we know, the theory of the genes-material,
 self-reproducing factors of heredity. The genes are localized
 in the chromosomes within the cell nucleus and influence the
 development of the various characters of the organism.
 When all work being done. in the U.S.S.R. using the methods
 of classical genetics was suspended in 1948, that science did
 not stop developing. The world is a big place; there are many
 scientists in it, and far from all of them took on faith the postu-
 lates of the new theory of heredity. Classical genetics proceed-
 ed to develop at an ever swifter pace. The number of publica-
 tions and books confirming the existence of the genes and the
 correctness of the chromosome theory of heredity grew year
 by year. Every year brought reports of fundamental discoveries
 in the unraveling of the nature of heredity; geneticists were
 awarded Nobel Prizes for their work.
 This process has gradually come to include our country too.
 After the 20th Party Congress a healthier atmosphere in the
 domain of science, and particularly in biology, set in. Free
 discussion of many key scientific problems became possible.
 A number of laboratories resumed genetic research, which was
 urgently needed by several branches of industry, medicine and
 agriculture. Controversy in the field of genetics also began to
 revive.
 Well, what has happened? Why have the predictions of the
 sterility and degradation of "formal" genetics not come true?
 This question demands a clear-cut answer. Impartial analysis
 of the path traversed by classical genetics and by biology as a
 whole is essential, for only on that condition can all the achieve-
 ments of this science be enlisted in the service of the Soviet
 people.
 But first of all a brief account should be given of just what
 heredity is and why the study of heredity is of such great im-
 portance for both the theoretical and the practical aspects of
 Approved For Release 2000/04/14: CIA-RDP78-03061A000200080002-1
 planation of why individuals of one or another species repro-
 duce their like, why children resemble their parents, why and
 how the characteristics and features of parents are transmitted
 to their progeny. A new organism develops out of a single cell
 (zygote) formed by the fusion of two reproductive cells (gam-
 etes)-a male and a female. The fertilized egg cell-the zygote-
 is comparatively simple: the membrane, liquid cytoplasm, a
 central nucleus, reserve substances and a number of other
 structures-this is the total extent of the microscopic morphol-
 ogy before the start of that speedy development which results
 in the appearance of an infinitely complex and perfect organ-
 ism. To explain the mechanism of this development is to ex-
 plain the nature of heredity, to unlock the basic mystery of the
 organic world, to find the keys to the control of heredity for
 the benefit of man. It was on this particular point that the basic
 variance of the two schools in genetics arose. One of them,
 without denying the great influence of the environment, attached
 primary importance to the structures of the egg cell and the
 spermatazoon, from which the new organism originates; the
 other focused Its attention solely on the external conditions of
 that development.
 The premise of classical genetics is that there exist in liv-
 ing cells special self-reproducible particles called genes, which
 are transmitted from one generation to another and the particu-
 lar combination of which predetermines the character of the
 individual development of a biological system. It would prob-
 ably be helpful to recall briefly how the concept of genes came
 into being in science. It originated, as we know, in the form
 of a hypothesis advanced to explain the laws of particulate in-
 heritance In hybrids established in the classical experiments
 of the Czech scientist G. Mendel almost a century ago. ...
 However, the so-called chromosome theory of heredity did
 not make its appearance until several decades after Mendel's
 first experiments, when a striking resemblance was discovered
 between the "behavior" of chromosomes and the nature of the
 inheritance of various characters.
 The strides of cytology in the early part of our century
 showed that in every cell and its nucleus there is a particular
 set of chromosomes-small rodlike structures the number and
 form of which are constant for a given species. When cell di-
 vision occurs, the constancy of the number of chromosomes is
 maintained by their self-replication. Each chromosome cre-
 ates its like before the division of the cell begins. The organ-
 ism's development starts, it will be recalled, as a result of
 the fusion of two cells, a maternal and a paternal; the number
 of chromosomes in the fertilized egg is double the number in
 each gamete. However, the number of chromosomes charac-
 teristic of the species remains at the former level, since in
 the formation of sex cells there occurs what Is called reduction
 division, in which, as distinct from ordinary cell division, the
 paired chromosomes separate into daughter cells without pri-
 or doubling, each sex cell acquiring half a set of chromosomes.
 It was thus established that in every normal cell of any sexual-
 ly reproducing living organism there is a quantitatively con-
 stant and always paired set of chromosomes. ...
 In this early period of the development of genetics, the
 genes still continued to be hypothetical factors of heredity,
 although there was no longer any doubt about the localization of
 the genes in the chromosomes. Methods were even worked out
 for determining the continuity of genes in the chromosomes,
 genetic maps were made of the chromosomes, the relationship
 of dependence was discovered between the appearance of char-
 acters and changes in particular segments of the chromo-
 somes, etc., but the chemical nature of the genes and the mech-
 anism of their reproduction were not unraveled until much
 later.
 The most Important discoveries In this area have been made
 only in the past ten to 15 years, and these discoveries have
 been revolutionizing biology. Elucidation of the biochemical
 structure of the genes has resulted from the swift hand-in-
 hand development of the two sciences genetics and biochem-
 istry, from the fruitful efforts of many laboratories and hun-
 drods of scientists.
 The development of classical genetics in recent decades has
 shown the vitality of this science, reinforced Its link with
 physics and chemistry and brought about its extensive involve-
 ment in the practice of medicine and agriculture. The gene
 theory has successfully passed the test of time. The nature
 and mechanism of the operation of genes have in broad terms
 been established, and one would think the prolonged dispute
 over this problem might have been brought town end. But the
 controversy over the gene theory continues and retains Its
 acute character. What explains this?
 Before answering this question, let us review those princi-
 pal discoveries of classical genetics that have led to identifi-
 cation of the precise biochemical mechanisms of heredity.
 Genetics and Cybernetics. The Concept of Hereditary In-
 formation.-The development of the embryo brings into being
 a highly complex living system made up of billions of cells
 Interconnected in the most appropriate fashion. This develop-
 ment produces a miracle of nature-the thinking brain; optical
 perfection-the eyes; an acoustical device of the highest order-
 the hearing apparatus; and many other systems of the living
 organism, systems whose organization is always astonishingly
 appropriate. The development of this appropriateness in na-
 ture was explained by Darwin's theory of evolution and selec-
 tion. Cumulative change in one or another direction has been
 going on for millions of years. Selection and the struggle for
 existence go on uninterruptedly. Bit by bit, detail by detail,
 change of one kind or another cumulates over thousands of
 generations, and as a result we observe the emergence of a
 new appropriate system. We live in a world made up of appro-
 priately organized living creatures. But no one of them is
 everlasting; every individual, however viable it may be, grows
 old and dies. It cannot transmit to its progeny its brain, its
 liver, its eyes-all those perfected systems that have developed
 in nature in the course of evolution over many millions of
 years. The individual transmits to its progeny an Insignifi-
 cantly small bit of its body-the egg cell or the spermato-
 zoon-which contains nothing but a nucleus with its chromo-
 somes and cytoplasm. To the superficial observer it looks as
 if these microscopic sex cells have nothing to do with the
 grown organism, as if the brain, muscles and blood of the
 body that engendered them have disappeared without a trace
 and the development of these cells starts each time from
 scratch. The narrow-minded scientist is perturbed by the
 insignificant size and seeming simplicity of the sex cell; he
 looks at the perfected, infinitely complicated organism and ex-
 claims: 'They have nothing to do with one another!" It seems
 an absurdity to him that the insignificantly small chromosomes,
 visible only through a microscope, should contain a full store
 of information on the structure and functions of, for instance,
 an elephant or a whale. But if the elephant has developed as a
 biological species in the process of evolution over hundreds of
 millions of year, it would be an even greater absurdity for it to
 come into being as something really new in the space of the
 months that embryogeny takes. Unless one accepts the reality
 of a hereditarily fixed, "programmed" development, the devel-
 opment of so perfect and complicated a system as, for example,
 the body of a mammal in the space of some months of embryog-
 eny is no more credible than the Biblical legend of the world's
 creation. Acceptance of such "programmed development"-of a
 program somehow coded in the chromosomes of the cell-is In
 most cases criticized from theoretical premises that are highly
 tendentious and show insufficient competence. Some people see
 a 'dualism" in this conception, maintaining that two forms of
 one and the same system are impossible. Yet cybernetics and
 information theory have proved that one and the same item of
 information can be expressed by the most diverse means. An
 exact diagram of a complicated machine essentially contains
 all the information about that machine, and the machine can be
 replicated from this diagram. More than that, it is easier and
 simpler to replicate the machine from the diagram than from a
 finished model. But the machine may weigh many, many tons
 while the diagram can be accommodated on several frames of

 that classical genetics has yielded agriculture nothing. Is this
 contention valid? Without touching on the question of whether
 it is possible to develop breeds and varieties by the agency of
 nurture, we shall try here to show, on the basis of several con-
 crete examples, that great and often decisive successes In the
 selection of the broadest variety of plants and animals may be
 laid to the application of classical genetics. As far back as the
 mid-1930s the great Soviet geneticist and plant breeder N. 1.
 Vavilov noted as among the greatest achievements of classical
 genetics the development of crossed-line hybrid corn and the
 production, by means of simple Mendelian interbreedings, of
 grain varieties resistant to rust and other parasites. Let us
 dwell first on hybrid corn.
 1. The first corn-breeding work was done in the 1920s by
 the prominent American geneticist Shull. First, "inbred" lines
 were developed-layers that propagated solely by self-pollina-
 tion. These lines were outwardly poor-looking: The plants were
 puny, only a small number of kernels developed in the ears, and
 the yields dropped off markedly. After eight to ten generations
 of "in"-breeding, the lines were crossed with one another and
 the best hybrids were intercrossed again. In this way so-called
 "double-crossed" hybrids were obtained which were actually
 hybrids of four lines. The quality of the ears in the crossed-
 hybrids sharply improved and the yield increased by an
 line
 average 20% to 30% over the starting variety.
 On N. I. Vavilov's initiative, similar work was begun in the
 U.S.S.R. Several excellent crossed-line hybrids (VIR-42 and
 others) were soon obtained. However, all corn-hybrid work was
 later pronounced harmful and stopped; it was declared, without
 any basis in fact, that the prolonged breeding of related lines
 of corn could yield no good results.
 Only a trip to the U.S.A. by our experts and the active back-
 ing of hybrid corn by N. S. Khrushchev made it possible to re-
 sume the breeding of new Soviet hybrids. Though it has been
 delayed almost two decades, the large-scale use of commercial
 hybrid corn has now begun in Soviet agriculture. In the U.S.,
 "double-crossed" hybrids account for 90% of all the corn plant-
 ed, and the increase in the yields has netted American farmers
 profits of hundreds of millions of dollars. The benefits from
 the growing of hybrid corn have also been very substantial in
 the U.S.S.R., and they will unquestionably increase.
 Utilizing genetic methods, the Soviet geneticist-selectionist
 M. I. Khadzhinov has succeeded in introducing the hereditary
 character of male infertility in several of the best varieties of
 corn. In the hybridization of corn, to avoid self-pollination, the
 pollen-bearing tassels must be torn off all the maternal-parent
 plants by hand. The existence of male-sterile lines makes this
 work unnecessary, releases manpower and yields large money
 savings.
 2. Through the use of colchicine and other alkaloids that in-
 hibit cell division, it is possible to obtain plants with a doubled
 set of chromosomes (tetraploids); the chromosomes divide, but
 the cell is unable to do so. Tetraploid sugar beets have been
 developed this way, i.e., through the use of coichinine. By
 crossing such beets with ordinary beets the selectionist gets
 triploids-plants in which the number oftchromosomes has been
 increased by half. They usually reproduce poorly and are often
 quite sterile, but they frequently yield bigger crops. Triploid
 sugar beets are very stable and have a higher sugar content.
 Extensive and successful sugar-beet breeding work has been
 done in the Soviet Union by a group of selectionist-geneticists
 of the Novosibirsk Institute of Cytology and Genetics working
 under the direction of the gifted scientist A. N. Lutkov. The
 sugar and with almost twice the yield. In Sweden tetraploid
 rye, developed by the prominent selectionist Montsing, has
 given a good account of itself. The Soviet geneticist G. D.
 Karpechenko was the first to succeed in showing that sterile
 plant hybrids can be made fertile by the doubling of the chro-
 mosome set. Such "amphidiploids' have been obtained in the
 case of many plants. To A. R. Zhebrak goes the credit for
 breeding valuable fertile amphidiploid hybrids of hard wheat
 and Timofeyev wheat, the latter being resistant to many dis-
 eases.
 The Soviet scientists V. V. Sakharov and A. R. Zhebrak have
 produced higher-yielding polyploid forms of buckwheat and are
 working for their adoption in agricultural production.
 It aHould be added that many of the best varieties of fruit
 trees are triploids (bananas, for instance), while in the case of
 flowers the overwhelming majority of the double varieties are
 polyploids. In general, the phenomenon of polyploidy is quite
 common in nature. For example, wheat represents a natural
 series of diploid (one-grained), tetraploid (hard) and hexaploid
 Leningrad. The report by Hero of Socialist Labor V. Ye. Pt-
 sarev on some remarkable polyploid rye-wheat hybrids and
 another by one of our oldest selectionists, M. F. Ternovaky,
 on polyploid varieties of tobacco should be singled out for spe-
 cial mention from among the numerous papers read at the con-
 ference.
 3. The resistance of plants to parasites is very often in-
 herited according to simple Mendelian laws, in the 3:1 ratio.
 This enables selectionists, by means of simple crossings, to
 make a valuable, high-yielding variety of barley, wheat or other
 cereal resistant to a specific dangerous disease.
 A parasite is usually adapted to the host plant, to the protein
 composition of its cells. A small change in the set of plant
 proteins resulting from a mutation disturbs this adjustment
 and can make the plant resistant. This has given rise to a pew
 method of selection for resistance. It consists in treating
 plants of a high-yielding but unstable variety with a powerful
 mutagen (for example, gamma rays)* and then searching out
 the resistance mutations. In recent years varieties of rust-
 resistant barley, wheat that is proof against fungus diseases,
 and other plant varieties have been developed by this means.  amp"
 The selection of disease-resistant mutants is also being
 carried out for domestic animals, with particular success in
 poultry breeding. Here, too, resistance is sometimes deter-
 mined by the presence of just one particular gene.
 4. The methods of commercial crossing that were first
 worked out on corn (double-crossed hybrids) later began to he
 used extensively in animal husbandry as well. The interbreed-
 ing of closely related lines is being practiced for obtaining
 so-called "inbred lines' (in poultry farming, pig raising, the
 breeding of fish, etc.). The intercrossing of lines not infre-
 quently yields hybrids notable for greater productivity and
 hardiness (heterosis). Such crossed-line hybrids are being
 bred in chicken farming (U.S.A., Britain, Holland, Belgium,
 the U.S.S.R. and other countries), pig raising (U.S.A.), and in
 several other branches of animal husbandry and in carp farm-
 ing (U.S.S.R). The benefits from commercial crossing are
 quite substantial. Commercial hybridization is being prac-
 ticed more widely year by year and is being extended to more
 and more domestic animals. The bases for this, method were

 point. In Sweden, the U.S.A., Canada and other mink-breeding
 countries furs with wonderful new colors have been obtained
 In recent years on the basis of conventional gene recombina-
 tion. Skins of these colors are in great demand and cost 15%-
 20% more than the usual skins. The same work is being done
 successfully with other fur-bearing animals.
 6. Very important methods have been worked out by the So-
 viet scientist B. L. Astaurov for the control of sex in silkworms,
 and these are now being applied to large animals as well. These
 methods are wholly based on the chromosome theory of sex.
 We shall confine ourselves to these few examples. Classical
 genetics has already exerted enormous influence on such im-
 portant branches of agriculture as the cultivation of corn and
 sugar beets, poultry farming, the breeding of fur-bearing ani-
 mals and others. In many cases the influence of genetics is not
 manifested so clearly, and tells only in the acceleration and im-
 provement of selection methods; but neither crop cultivation
 nor animal husbandry can get by today without drawing widely
 on the data and methods of genetics. The myth of the "fruitless-
 ness" of classical genetics in the field of agriculture must be
 shattered; it is doing our country a great deal of harm.
 Conclusion.-In this article we have touched on only  few of
 the practicaFand theoretical aspects of present-day genetics.
 We have seen that this science Is really making a searching
 and comprehensive investigation of the laws of heredity, and
 from materialist positions. Thanks to the strides of biochem-
 istry, molecular biology, cytology and other sciences, genetics
 has in recent years been able to uncover the intimate mecha-
 nisms governing the transmission of characters from one gen-
 eration to its successors and to identify and investigate the
 structures that perform the functions of a special genetic "mem-
 ory" and efficiently coordinate the processes of metabolism,our
 ur
 growth and development in all living creatures
 planet.
 By having mastered these profound mysteries of biochemistry,
 genetics has now assured itself a central place among the bio-
 accom-
 logical sciences
 plisha number of cardinal practical tasks i in medicine
 and agriculture.
 All attempts to ignore the practical and theoretical signifi-
 cance of present-day genetics and to confine the development
 of Soviet biology within the narrow framework of a single school
 should be resolutely rebuffed. All the resources of Soviet sci-
 entists and all the methods and achievements of biological sci-
 ence that have been tested by time and world experience should
 be marshaled to serve the Soviet people.
 How is it that the progress of modern genetics has been held
 back for so long in our country? Why have we so long let the
 capitalist states hold a large and productive sector of the sci-
 entific front on the pretense that classical genetics was a bour-
 geois science? After all, we do not talk of "bourgeois physics,"
 "bourgeois chemistry" or "bourgeois physiology" I On the con-
 trary, in these and other spheres of knowledge we keep close
 track of all the advances abroad'and try to make speedy use of
 everything new and interesting. Moreover, we strive in the So-
 viet Union to ensure the advance of scientific research on an
 up-to-date level in all branches of science without exception.
 Only in biology do some individuals persist in trying to draw
 a sharp line between Soviet and world science and in ignoring
 anything done by representatives of other scientific schools.
 The answer to these questions seems to us a very simple one.
 All this could have happened only in a setting of perversions-
 those perversions that were observed in the period of the cult
 of the individual. The attempt by some scientists to isolate
 Soviet biology from world science is a harmful survival of the
 cult; it shows loss of contact with reality and fear mo made openly
 and honestly admitting and rectifying                   the

 The  ov et union's Not So Peaceful Coexistence
 The Soviet Union claims that its foreign policy is peaceful
 coexistence, that it seeks normal relations with free world
 countries and peaceful, negotiated solutions to problems which
 threaten the security of the world.  Elowever, in practice, the
 USSR is engaging in hard line aggressive tactics where it suits
 their goals of world domination, for example:  by encouraging
 and supporting insurrection by dissident elements against legal
 free world governments; and by supporting government leaders in
 aggressi   actions to annex territories belonging to other coun-
 tries.  A few cases are summarized below.
 Indonesia.  Credit extended to Sukarno over a period of
 years by  -fie  SSL has been used primarily in purchasing military
 hardware from communist countries.  These loans now mount to
 a staggering debt of some one billion dollars.  The service on
 the debt'%alone is an almost  nsuDpor a ? burden on the Indo-
 nesian economy, long ailing for lack of attention.  Sukarno,
 aware also of the need to divert his people's attention from
 his failure to alleviate their own economic plight, is now pur-
 suing his territorial expansion in a confrontation with the
 'ederation of Malaysia.  Only massive Soviet support has permit-
 ted Sukarno to mount and continue his military aggression against
 neighboring countries, -- a policy which also weakens the coun-
 try internally and creates the conditions for a communist take-
 over,
 Laos.  The USSR has supplied the Pathet Lao with significant
 amounts of the large military hardware which they are using in
 their attempt to take the country by force and destroy the coa-
 lition government established and guaranteed by the 14-nation
 Geneva Conference in 1962.  The Soviets have encouraged and sup-
 ported the Pathet Lao in their recent attacks violating the
 truce agreement; and the USSR has not supported the legitimate
 demand by the Laotian Premier that'-they return to the position
 held prior to their truce violation.
 Cuba.  Khrushchev, through his intelligence services, eco-
 nomic and military support, actively participates in Castro's
 policy of instigating insurrection against legal Latin American
 governments.  The USSR's massive aid program frees Castro's
 limited economic resources for military uses.  A scant 20 months
 ago the United States cut short the Soviet's attempt to place
 offensive missles in Cuba.  At that time (October 1962), IShru-
 shchev agreed that Cuba would be inspected to ascertain the re-
 moval of such missiles.  This agreement has not been fulfilled,
 and Khrushchev is now saying (Izvestiya "observer" article 25
 April) that US overflights con tra`vene the US-Soviet October 1962
 agreement and that Castro has the right to use Soviet weapons
 against reconnaissance planes.
 Iraq.  The Soviets, who had foresightedly supplied the Iraq
 army with Soviet-bloc arms, withheld vital supplies of spare
 parts and ammunition needed by the government's armed forces

 have from time to t me supported the Kurds in their revolts
 against the government.  The Soviets arbitrarily support legal
 governments or rebellious minority groups, as suits their shift-
 ing tactics.
 Con      Soviet official  installations in the Congo were
 close  wen the newly elected government (June 1960) uncovered
 the USS.  plot to take over the country.  Soviet arms were il-
 legally flown into the country to support ill-fated communist
 ]Patrice Lumumba.  After his downfall, his successor, pro-Communis'
 Antoine Gizengo continued efforts to unseat the legal government
 with Soviet arms, agitation and other assistance.  The USSR, re-
 fusing to support the UN peacekeeping mission, continued its ef-
 forts to stimulate insurrection and subvert the country.  Khru-
 shchev, actively supporting anti-Adoula elements in Brazzaville,
 has once more been exposed;   documents recently found in the
 possession of two Soviet intelligence officers contained evidence
 of Soviet involvement in plans of the dissidents to overthrow tLc
 Congolese government.
 Somali.  The USSR offered Somali some $31 million of militax
 arras and equipment in 1963.  The purpose of the hardware :  to
 support that government's illegal subversive and aggressive ef-
 forts to take over lands occupied by nomadic Somali peoples in
 neighboring Kenya and 3thiopia.  The Soviet Union has also taken
 some 600 Somali officers and men to the USSI:=~ for training -- in
 pursuit of these same aggressive actions against peaceful neih-
 bors.            At the same time, official representatives of the USSR In
 ..3thiopia were expelled for subversive activities against that
 government.
 Zanzibar.  Soviet arms shipments were sent to pro-Cormaunist
 leaders who  ttempted to take over the newly independent govern-
 ment of Zanzibar.  After the initial failure of the coup, a build
 up of Communist advisers, arms and official representatives
 started.  president Karume then signed articles of union with
 Tanganiyka on Aroil 22nd in a move to strengthen his country.
 Since that time the Soviets have continued to supply weapons and
 advisers to Communists who are working assiduously to sever the
 ties between the two countries.
 Other.  The Brazilian press recently exposed the heavy
 SovietinvolvemenT-I-n--su  ersive activities in that country,
 which bore a resemblance to their efforts in the Congo.  US
 planes have been buzzed in the air corridors over Germany, truc_-
 convoys have met with interference on the highways to U7est merlin
 and other physical harassment has been used to remind the allies
 of Communist military capabilities in the German problems.  The
 Soviet Union does not support the UN efforts to settle the Cyprcus
 problem, but on the contrary encourages a military solution --
 including willingness to supply hardware.

 Communists Exploit East African Vulnerabilities
 East Africa, from the oldest kingdom in the world to the
 newest nation, is beset by a stepped up Communist offensive to
 influence or even, perhaps, to overthrow her weaker governments
 under the giise of friendly assistance.  The Soviet Union needs
 an East African base, UN support frora the African members, al-
 lies in the Sine--Soviet conflict and African mineral sources.
 Communist China has much the same goals and, in addition, is
 bidding for leadership of the world's revolutionary forces.
 Arms shipments, press and information and manipulation of
 political sympathizers have been widely used weapons in the
 Communist offensive.  The following are typical examples:
 Somali Republic. Somali*s efforts to take over lands and
 tribesmen of the noaaadic Somali peoples now living in eastern
 Ethiopia and northeastern Kenya are being extensively supported
 by the Soviet Union.  In 1963 the USSR offered some $31 million
 worth of military arms and equipment and toots some 400 Somali
 officers and pilots for training in the USSR.
 Ethiopia.  Trio Soviet "diplomats", Second Secretary
 Valdimir  .ychkov and Attache Safar Abdilov were quietly ex-
 pelled from Ethiopia after the government security services
 discovered that they had been distributing anti-government
 literature.  Their activities allegedly included local travels
 under assumed names.
 United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar.  Zanzibar
 achieved independence from Britain in December 1963 with a
 traditional Arab government.  On January 12th, Soviet-trained
 Eanga and China-financed Mohammed Babu organized a revolt under
 nominal leadership of African nationalist Abeid Karume who
 had become president.  An immediate build-up of pro-Communist
 power took place, supported by arms shipments from the USSR and
 a large influx of advisors and technicians from European Com-
 munist countries.  President Narume, unable to cope with the
 growing threat to Zanzibar independence, signed articles of
 union with Tanganyika, later ratified by the Zanzibar Revolu-
 tionary Council.
 However, the Babu group has worked strenuously against the
 April 22nd union with considerable assistance from bloc coun-
 tries.  Communist weapons and diplomatic and technical person-
 nel contintie to arrive in large numbers from the Soviet Union
 and China.  The May Day parade revealed a well equiped military
 organization.  Aid offers were immediately forthcoming from
 Moscow and East Europe,  Many Communist country diplomatic
 staffs were suddenly and greatly increased, including that of
 East Germany, its only Embassy in the non-Communist world.  A
 large scale propaganda barrage on the benefits of Communist
 ties is directed by East Germans and aimed at countering the
 African desire for non-alignment and at deny inz~ the Zanzibari

 the stability of alignment with Tanganyika.  The intensive ef-
 forts to make Haan ibar a Communist base -- which could become
 the "Cuba of Africa" as Babu once predicted -- are in interest-
 ing contrast to the Soviets' demands for removal of foreign
 bases from Worth Africa.
 The former Tanganyika was granted independence from the
 British in late 1961 under Julius Hyerere who is now ?resident.
 The difficult job of building political and economic strength
 was interrupted by echoes of the Zanzibar revolt -- a Tangan-
 yikan army mutiny of mid-January, followed quickly by similar
 revolts in Kenya and Uganda.  The governments had to turn to
 Britain to put down the mutinies quickly and without bloodshed.
 But the mutineers and their countrymen remain unhappy over the
 failure of independence to bring an immediate and magical im-
 provement in their lives.  Their frustrations make them vulner-
 able to Communist exploitation.
 One most significant area of penetration is the press,
 heavily influenced by staffs trained in Communist countries and
 by use of :Free TASS news services.  Communist correspondents
 use Dar-es-Salaam as a base for their contacts with exiles and
 dissident leaders in neighboring countries.  Kao Liang, the
 i1CHA correspondent expelled earlier from India for "unjournal-
 istic activities", acted for the Chinese Communist government
 in getting money into Zanzibar for the January revolution via
 TCCHA representative Babu.
 Kenya came to independence in December 1963 to face, inter
 alia, an  nsistant Somali Republic seeking to annex the Somali
 tribesmen and their grazing lands in Kenya.  The battle con.?
 sisted largely of propaganda and brief territorial incursions
 but suddenly increased in scope when the Somali Republic turned
 to USSR for arms.  As they thus increased the military threat
 against Kenya, the Soviet Union began a program to propagandize
 the Kenyans and subvert the government.
 Large scale efforts are being made in the information and
 communications field.  The Soviets have offered a radio station
 capable of broadcasting into many of the neighboring countries
 of East Africa and money, from Bulgaria as well as the Soviet
 Union, to publish Pan Africa, a pro-Communist English language
 bivweekly, edited by a Briish Communist.
 The Kenyan Home Affairs Minister, Oginga Odinga, the Com-
 raunists' best friend in Kenya, has obtained Communist money,
 technical advisors and press equipment.  He brought both the
 Kenya Broadcasting Corporation and the Kenya News Agency under
 government control so that he could appoint Communist sympa-
 thizers to staff thera and obtain Communist training for em-
 ployees.
 Uganda, independent since late 1962, has also been the
 objecommunist attention.   Individual leaders of the
 Uganda Peoples Congress (UPC)) h y                          amounts

 COMMUNISTS FOMENT RACIAL HATRED IN BRITISH GUIANA
 For many years, the several races that make up the population of
 British Guiana lived in relative harmony.  As Great Britain's policy
 of "decolonization" began to take effect, the one thing that the vast
 majority of the inhabitants had in common was a desire for national
 independence.  This drew the two major ethnic groups -- East Indians
 and Negroes -- together for a time in a common cause.  Today, after only
 a few years of experience in limited self-government, British Guiana
 is torn by racial strife that would plunge it into a bloody civil war
 but for the presence of British troops.
 The immediate cause of the current outbreak of violence is the
 strike of sugar cane workers, called on 12 February 1964 by the Guiana
 Agricultural Workers' Union (GAWU), a minority scab union controlled
 by the party in power, in protest over the fact that a rival union, the
 Manpower Citizens Association (MPCA) is recognized by both the employers
 and the British Guiana Trade Union Congress (BGTUC).as the responsible
 bargaining agency.  By 1 June, with the strike in its 111th day, at least
 33 Indians and negroes had been killed, 4+64 injured, 963 arrested, 841
 houses destroyed or damaged by fire, and over a million dollar's damage
 done to the cane fields.
 Nearly half of British Guiana's population of 600,00o are descendents
 of East Indian laborers.  Most of them live in the rural areas and work
 in the sugar cane fields. Negroes, descendents of African slaves,
 make up about 35% of the population and live mostly in Georgetown.' the
 capital.  The other 15% approximately of the population is composed of
 whites, Amerindians, and persons of mixed ancestry.
 The two principal political parties follow almost mathematically
 the racial constitution of the population:  the People's Progressive
 Party (PPP) is predominantly East Indian; the People's National Congress
 (PNC), almost entirely Negro.  A third party, the United Force
 (UF), draws its strength from the managerial class, which generally
 cuts across racial lines.
 The leader of the PPP and premier o  the colony's government is Dr.
 Cheddi Jagan, an East Indian dentist educated in Chicago.  An avowed
 Marxist, Jagan has given every indication over the years that he is a
 bona fide Communist and intends to make of British Guiana, as soon as it
 attains complete independence, a Soviet enclave on the coast of South
 America.  His wife, nde Janet Rosenberg, of Chicago, was a member of the
 Communist Youth prior to her marriage.  She is even more radical than her
 husband and is considered the brains behind his political organization.
 Until she resigned on 1 June, she was Minister for Home Affairs in her
 husband's government.  (The national police force, largely composed of
 Africans, as the Negroes prefer to call themselves, is under that ministry,
 and it was her contention that the police were discriminating against the
 East Indians.  In reality, her ministry was not cooperating with the police.)

 Approved For Release 2000/04/14: CIA-RDP78-03061A000200080002-1
 The leader of the PNC is Forbes Burnham, a 41-year-old Negro lawyer
 who calls himself a "left-wing democratic socialist",  He has been the
 principal force opposing Jagan's efforts to bring Castro-Communism to
 British Guiana.  Burnham was one of the founders of the PPP, but broke
 off with Jagan in 1955 and formed his own Peoples National Congress.
 .The United Force came into being in the elections of 1961.  It is
 led by Peter D'Aguiar, a self-made businessman of Portuguese descent.
 At first regarded as unrealistically conservative for the practicalities
 of Guianese politics, the OF has recently modified its views, and D'Aguiar
 is recognized by all elements as a progressive knowledgeable industrialist.
 Although-the current strike was the spark that ignited the racial
 violence, it should be considered more an excuse than a genuine cause.
 The roots of the conflict are rather political and ideological.  They go
 back to the impasse created by the 1961 elections, in which the PPP won
 a majority of seats in the assembly.  Jagan thus became premier under the
 impartial eye of the British Governor and proceed somewhat too hurriedly
 to consolidate his power and prepare the colony for eventual collectivi-
 zation under a Castro-type Communist government.
 One of Jagan's first acts was to take over the school system, which
 included assuming control and management of some fifty denominational,
 or parish, schools.  The opposition had feared all along that the minister
 of education would seize the schools and convert them into Godless
 institutions.  Parents protested, citing one of the clauses of the United
 Nation's Declaration of Human Rights that:  "Parents have a prior right
 to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children."
 As the party of the government in power, the PPP has been granted
 facilities over official radio stations not available to other parties.
 Now, the government has announced its intention of taking over all of
 the stations and has notified the British Guiana Broadcasting Co., LTD.,
 a station used at one time by the opposition, that its franchise, due to
 expire at the end of 1964, will not be renewed.
 Control over both education and communications, implying control
 over the minds of the people, represents a giant step toward total power
 for Jagan.
 On the economic front, the Jagan government has established close
 ties with Castro and Cuba.  Through GIMPEX (Government Export-.Import
 Corporation), which is more an arm of the PPP than a private agency,
 as Jagan claims, the government has received a million-dollar loan from
 Castro.  This was ostensibly for railroad cross-ties, and the government
 has been paid for them.  However, few have been delivered yet.  The logical
 conclusion is that the funds are intended to strengthen the PPP and further
 spread subversion in British Guiana.
 Other, more direct, causes of the present stalemate of violence and
 terror are the subversive activities of the Progressive Youth Organization
 (PYO), the activist unit of the PPP.  The PYO is generally believed to
 be responsible for most of the atrocities committed against the African

 Approved For Release 2000/04/14: CIA-RDP78-03061A000200080002-1
 population and for the sabotage against the cane fields.  Many of their
 members have received guerrilla warfare training in Cuba and are suspected
 of smuggling arms into British Guiana.  Several small caches of weapons,
 including four sub-machine guns and 2,000 rounds of ammunition were found
 by police last April.  Much to the chagrin of Janet Jagan, the police
 announced that they had been hidden by members of the PYO.  Following
 the pattern of extremists in other areas that are targets for Communist
 takeover, the PYO is reported to be organizing a secret military force,
 the "Guiana Liberation Army."
 Since the majority political party derives its power from the
 majority ethnic group, and since it is apparently determined to impose
 a Communist-type government upon the country as soon as it is given
 complete independence, the non-Indian elements in the population are
 perturbed and determined to resist by any means.
 There is a possibility that the means was given to them last fall
 in London.  Unable to settle their difficulties, the three political leaders
 (Jagan, Burnham and D'Aguiar) met on 25 October with British Colonial
 Secretary Duncan Sandys, and all agreed -- even Cheddi Jagan -- to abide
 by whatever solution Sandys should choose.  To the delight of both Burnham
 and D'Aguiar, he chose proportional representation.
 The 1961 elections were held under a district system, whereby the
 winner of the majority of the votes in a given electoral district --
 whether a large or a small majority -- would win the assembly seat.  The
 African delegates, in Georgetown, polled heavy majorities, but got few
 seats; while the Indians, living in small towns and villages, got smaller
 majorities but more seats than even their greater numbers would justify.
 For example, the PPP, with 42.6% of the votes, received 20 seats in the
 35-man assembly, while the PNC, with 41% of the votes got only 11 seats.
 the UP, with 16.4% of the votes  on 4 seats.  Under proportional repre-
 sentation, which will be in effect in the elections to be held late in
 1964, a party will be given seats in proportion to the overall number
 of votes which it receives.  Its stength in the assembly, therefore,
 will more nearly reflect its popular strength.  The assembly will then
 be more truly representative.
 More importantly, however, the combined percentages of the PNC and
 the OF would be sufficient to form a coalition government that could
 remove Jagan and reverse many of his ruinous policies.
 This has been the real bone of contention.       Jagan and his Communist-
 lining supporters know that they cannot win under a system of proportional
 representation.  Therefore, the PPP and the PYO have embarked on a campaign
 of sabotage, subversion, and disruption that has but one aim:  to prevent
 elections that they are almost certain to lose.  To accomplish this aim,
 their have resorted to the most cruel of means:  race warfare. From the
 beginning, Jagan has relied on his Indian backing to stay in power through
 the ballot box.  Now, he has threatened that in a physical clash, his
 Indians will outnumber and outfight the others.

 Whether Jagan and his followers will create enough confusion to cause
 Great Britain to postpone the elections remains yet to be seen.  On 22
 May, a state of emergency was declared and more British troops were dis-
 patched to the colony.  They now number over 1,100 and are actively patrolling
 the troubled. areas.  One thing is certain, according to Duncan Sandys:
 Great Britain will not grant full independence to the colony until elections
 are held and until a responsible government is in power capable maintaining
 order with justice.
