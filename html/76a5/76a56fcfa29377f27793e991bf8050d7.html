CHEN WEIDA BAN YUE TAN ARTICLE ON RESOLUTION  
HK260744 Tianjin RIBAO in Chinese 24 Sep 81 p 1 
[Article by Chen Weida [7115 0251 66713: "Study the Marxist Theory of Knowledge Through 
the Resolution"] 
[Text] An article entitled "Study the Marxist Theory of Knowledge Through the Resolution," 
written by Chen Weida, first secretary of the Tianjin Municipal CCP Committee, will be 
published in the No 18 issue of the BAN YUE TAN magazine to come out tomorrow. The following 
is the full text of the article. 
We can often find party members and cadres who lack vigor in their work, who dare not 
criticize or wage struggles against other people's erroneous words or actions, and who do 
not enthusiastically implement the party's line, principles and policies. When we ask them 
why, they will say that our party has committed many mistakes so that as members of the 
Communist Party, they lack assurance in trying to influence others. An important cause of 
this thinking among these comrades is that they are not good at applying the Marxist theory 
of knowledge in viewing mistakes and setbacks. Therefore, in studying the Resolution on - 
Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC, we must not 
only clearly understand matters of right and wrong concerning major historical events, but 
what is more important, we must study the Marxist stand, viewpoints and methods the 
resolution embodies in its analysis of historical events, so that we can help some comrades 
'free themselves from the fetters of idealism and metaphysics and consequently their confi-
dence in our party can be basically restored. 
What is the meaning of a mistake? One commits a mistake when one does not correctly under-
stand objective laws and work according to them. It is not easy to correctly understand 
objective laws. In particular, it is an unprecedented undertaking in human history to 
practice socialism in a poor and backward country with a large population such as ours, and 
therefore it is difficult for any political party or individual to absolutely and accurately 
comply with objective laws in all historical periods and in formulating all major policies. 
Very often, the correct understanding and mastering of objective laws cannot be achieved in 
only one or two rounds of practice. Consider the question of shifting the emphasis of our 
work. More than once, we experienced setbacks in attempting to bring about this shift. The 
first time we proposed it, it was not put into practice. The second time we did so, people's 
attitudes toward it wavered and it was rejected. When this question was raised at the 3d 
Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, it was already the third time. Thus, to 
acquire knowledge about this question is not easy and involves a high price. The same is 
true of the question of class struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong criticized Stalin for 
magnifying class struggle. He also said that there are two categories of contradictions in 
the socialist society, the majority of which being contradictions among the people, and that 
large-scale and turbulent class struggles have basically ended. However, shortly afterward, 
disruptions broke out in Poland and Hungary, a small number of rightists attacked our party, 
and Khrushchev applied pressure on us. Consequently, within our party, people could not 
arrive at a unified view on class struggle. In this complicated situation,LComrade Mao 
Zedong put forth the ideas that class struggle must be stressed all the time, every day, 
every month and every year; that grasping class struggle was an effective solution to all 
problems, that class struggle must be taken as the key link, and so on. Consequently, class 
struggle was magnified and the contradictions among ourselves were confused with those 
between ourselves and the enemy. It is precisely by virtue of our past practice and the 
lessons of our bitter experiences that we can now correctly understand and resolve this 
question. In a certain sense, correct leadership often emerges out of mistakes (direct or 
indirect ones).

R 2 PRC REGIONAL AFFAIRS 
NORTH REGION 
Our party committed the mistake of launching the "Great Cultural Revolution," one which 
affected our country on an overall scale, but our party also learned an extremely profound 
lesson from this historical event. We have acquired knowledge from the bitter defeat and 
have gradually come to discover the relevant laws. Now, we have attained an unprecedentedly 
high level of understanding about socialist revolution and construction. Our party has 
vigorously and correctly summed up the experience of the mistakes it committed. This 
shows that our party is open and above board and has a high sense of responsibility toward 
the people; that instead of being no longer great, glorious and correct, it is even more 
so than before; and that instead of being incapable of exercising leadership, it has even 
greater leadership ability. This has been proved by past history and current practice. 
A review of our party's history reveals that our party committed many mistakes during the 
democratic revolution period. The two gravest mistakes were Chen Duxiu's rightist 
capitulationism and Wang Ming's leftist opportunism. The latter caused the Red Army to 
dwindle from a force of 300,000 persons to around 30,000 persons and caused the party's 
forces in the White area to be almost completely destroyed. Did our party become useless 
because it committed those mistakes? History has proved that this was not so. Our party 
continued to mature precisely amid mistakes and setbacks. After the Zunyi myeting, the 
rectification movement of 1942 and the adoption of the Resolution on Certain Historical 
Questions in 1945, the level of ideology was raised and the understanding of party members 
was unified, so that finally our party could lead the Chinese people to achieve victory 
in the democratic revolution. 
The same reasoning also applies to the current situation. Since the third plenary session 
of the Central Committee, our party has achieved tremendous successes in various aspects. 
This shows that our party has really become more mature. For example, since the third 
plenary session, there have been some controversies about our party's rural policies as 
well as some resistance to implementing these policies. However, on the whole, these 
policies have been implemented rather smoothly and within a short span of 2 years of more, 
we have achieved great success which is acknowledged globally. It can be imagined that 
if such policies were proposed before the "Great Cultural Revolution," the controversies 
would have been much more acute and the resistance much stronger. The reason is that the 
"Great Cultural Revolution" caused enormous disruption to agricultural production, so that 
people have gotten a deep impression of the harmful effects of leftist mistakes. Therefore, 
from the viewpoint of historical development and the Marxist theory of knowledge, although 
we paid an agonizingly high price in the "Great Cultural Revolution," today's progress in 
people's understanding and development in national agricultural production constitute 
a kind of compensation for that price. 
Chairman Mao said that under certain conditions, material things can become a spiritual 
force or the other way around. Our 32 years of practice is a kind of material thing which 
gives rise to a spiritual force when the practice is raised to the level of theory in writing 
the resolution. It can be believed that the resolution will certainly become a huge 
material force which will promote the vigorous development of our cause. In studying the 
resolution, we must adopt the dialectical-materialist stand, viewpoint and method, sum 
up the lessons of our own experiences of success and failure, continuously raise our own-
level of understanding, closely integrate the gist of the CCP Central Committee's directives 
with the actual situation in Tianjin, and more resolutely and consciously implement the 
line, principles and policies formulated by our party since the third plenary session. 
We must eliminate all sentiments and thoughts of pessimism, dejection and unwillingness to 
advance. We must rouse ourselves, temper our own revolutionary will and devote all our 
strength to building our country into a modern socialist power.

HIS FORMER PARTY AND CURRENT "ACADEMIC" POSITIONS 
MAKE THE DOCUMENT AN AUTHORITATIVE VIE* OF SOVIET

S. THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF THE DOCUMENT IS ITS 
APPRAISAL OF THE SOVIET UNION AS AN uNREALENTING 
IMPERIALISTIC POWER DRIVEN BY INTERNAL ECONOMIC 
CONTRADICTIONS AND A TYRANNICAL POWER STRUCTURE. 
STALIN, IT CLAIMS. "DESTROYED THE ROOTS OF SOCIALISM" 
IN THE USSR. KNRUSCHEV AND BREZHNEV FOLLOWED UP 
STALIN'S FOREIGN POLICY OF "GREAT POWER CHAUVINISM," 
WITH A FOREIGN POLICY OF ,HEGEMONISm. THE SOVIET 
UNION, THE DOCUMENT CHARGES "HAS BECOME AN IMPERIALIST 
COUNTRY WITH STATE MONOPOLIES. THIS IS SOCIAL 
IMPERIALISM." 
6. THE TERM "SOCIAL IMPERIALISM" WAS AN IMPORTANT 'PART 
OF BEIJING'S CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SOVIET UNION AFTER 
THE INVASION OF CZECHOSLAVAKIA AND BEFORE THE DEATH 
OF MAO, A PERIOD.wHEN SINOmPSOVIET POLEMICAL EXCHANGES

OF MAO'S CONTRTBUTIONS, THE TREATMENT OF THIS SUBJECT 
REFLECTS BEIJING'S NEW WILLINGNESS TO DEAL WITH DIFFICULT

7. THE LENGTHY TREATMENT OF THE SOVIET UNION'S ' 
DEPARTURE FROM THE SOCIALIST .PATH IN INTERNAL 4.NO 
EXTERNAL POLICIES AND ITS DENUNClATIoN OF SOVIET 
LEADERS INCLUDING STALIN HAVE NOT TET SURFACED IN THE 
CHINESE PUBLIC MEDIA, THEIR APPEARANCE IN THIS FOAm, 
HOWEVER, INDICATES THAT THE PARTY LINE MAY NOW BE 
ESTABLISHED. THEY COINCIDE WITH THE VIEWS wL.114.1.E 
HEARD IN PRIVATE -FROM  CHINESE ACACEPVT-CS AND MARxIST 
THEORISTS, INCLUDING  LX SHENGZHI.  
AMERICAN INSTITuTF ANDA LEADING MEMBER OF THE mARUAA:-
LENINIST INSTITUTE.  :SEEPAGE INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN 
OR A. MOPE FORTHRIGHT PUBLIC PRESENTATION OF THEIR 
THESIS MAY NOT BE.TAR_AWAr. 
8. IT IS NOTEWORTHY?IN THIS -REGARD THAT MOSCOW HAS 
LONG DENOUNCED CHINA'S .OWN INTERNAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
POLICIES. THE SOVIET MEDIA, 'HOWEVER, HAVE TET TO .47 
DEPICT CHINA 4c -_minN.cnriALIST COUNTRY, ALTHOUGH ? 
SOVIET THEORETICAL JOURNALS ARE WARNING THAT THE 
APPEARANCE OF CAPITALIST INFLUENCES IN CHINA 
COULD "GET OUT. OF HAND." IF ALLOWED To DEVELOP FURTHER. 
49. ANOTHER NOTEWORTHY -FEATURE OF THE DOCUMENT IS 
THE UNDERCURRENT OF TEAR ,REGARDING -SOVIET MILITARY 
INTENTIONS TOWARD-CH/NA. THE DOCUMENT MAKES IT 
CLEAR THAT CHINESE TEARS HAVE BEEN KEPT ALIVE BY 
THE CONTINUING SOVIET MILITARY BUILD uP ON THE SING-
SOVIET BORDER IN MONGOLIA AND SIBERIA, THE SOVIET 
INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN, AND THE SOVIET USE OF 
VIETNAM AND _POTENTIALLY INDIA TO ENCIRCLE CHINA. 
THE DOCUMENT CHARACTERIZES THE sovrET AGGRESSIVE 
THRUST IN THE WORLD AS NOT LINKED TO ANY INDIVIDUAL 
LEADER, OR TO MISTAKES MADE OVER A PARTICULAR PERLOD 
OF TIME BUT RATHER A$ A LEPPig---T-FIEFILALK.J'AikaiLLRELUN 
MOVING INEXORABLY FORWARD. LIU'S ATTENTION TO THE 
SOVIET EMPHASIS ON SIBERIA DURING THE 8REZHNEV ERA 
AS "OF MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE IN FACING CHINA" REVEALS 
BEIJING'S SENSITIVITY TO THE LONG TERM STRATEGIC 
IMPLICATIONS OF SIBERIAN DEVELOPMENT THAT RARELY 
APPEARS IN CHINESE -PUBLIC OR EVEN PRIVATE COMMENT.

10. THE DOCUMENT PRESENTS A DRAMATIC ESCALATION OF 
THE CHINESE CRITICISM 'OF STALIN. IT NOTES STALIN'S

UNMISTAKABLY CLEAR ANALOGY BETWEEN MAO'S STYLE OF

12. THE DOCUMENT CONCLUDES BY ADVOCATING THAT CHINA 
"THROw OFF THE FETTERS" OF THE SOVIET MODEL., PROCEED 
ACCORDING TO CHINA'S REAL SITUATION" AND CONSTRUCT A 
"CHINESE STYLE SOCIALIST ROAD," IT CALLS FOR A RESOLUTE 
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE USSR, "THIS HEGEMONGISTIC, 
IMPERIALISTIC COUNTRY WEARING SOCIALIST CLOTHES," 
AND DECLARES THAT SOVIET POLICIES MAKE. AN IMPROVEMENT

END SUMMARY. 
3. FOR THIRTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE DEATH OF MAO, BEIJING 
REGULARLY CASTIGATED THE USSR AS A HREvisipwlsi _STATEI" 
BUT wITH THEIR OwN POST-MAO REFORMS STRESSING INCENTIVES 
AND pROFIT-AND-LOSS ACCOUNTABILITY, THE CHINESE DROPPED THE 
SUBJECT. STILL THE QUESTION NAGGED; COULD THE SOVIET UNION 
AS A "SOCIAL-IMPERIALIST" ROWER IRRETRIEVABLY BENT ON WORLD 
HEGEMONY, STILL BE A "SOCIALIST" COUNTRY? 
4. IN /1979+ A GROUP OF CHINESE SCHOLARS IN -HEILONGJIANG 
PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN A LOCAL JOURNAL THAT CONCLUDED 
THAT SINCE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE MEANS OF -PRODUCTION 
STILL EXISTED TN THE SOVIET UNION, IT REMAINED A .SOCIALIST 
COUNTRy DESPITE ITS EXPANSIONIST POLICY. BEIJING QUICKLY 
REBUKED THESE ACADEMICS, AND DENG XIAOPING AND OTHER CHINESE 
OFFICIALS IN PRIVATE INTERVIEWS ASSERTED THAT THE SOVIE1 
UNION AS NOT A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. LIU KEMING SPECIFICALLY 
ASSERTS THAT STATE OWNERSHIP OF THE MEANS OF .PRODUCTION 
ALONE Is AN INSUFFICIENT BASIS FOR DETERmlNING WHETHER 
THE SOVIET UNION IS SOCIALIST. 
S. THERE HAS BEEN NO PUBLIC CHINESE TREATMENT OF THE 
ISSUE, BUT IN THE COLD HALLS OF BEIJING'S MARXIST-LENINIST 
INSTITUTE, AND ELSEWHERE IN THE ACADEMY OF SOCIAL 
SCIENCEs, LIRERAL MARXIST THINKERS CONTINUED TO CONTEMPLATE 
THE QUESTIONS OF JUST HOW THE SOVIET UNION WENT ASTRAY-. 
ONE OF THESE THEORISTS, LI SHENGZHI: A LEADING ? 
MEMBEk OF THE mAPxISTmLENINIST INSTITUTE AND NO HEAD 
OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE. IN A. PR1vATE CONVERSATION 
SOME TIME AGO PROVIDED AN ASSESSMENT oF SOVIET SOCIETY 
THAT ANTICIPATED MUCH OF THE ANALYS1s IN LIU'S TALK. IN 
SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS, LIu KEmING ALSO EXPLAINED TO US HIS 
VIE% AS TO WHY THE SOVIET UNION WAS NOT A SOCIALIST COUNTRY, 
HIS ADOPESS OP THE SUBJECT TO A UNIVERSITY AUDIENCE .AND 
THE PPI[JTING OF THE TEXT IN AN INTEPNAL DOCUMENT SuGGES1S

6? THE THEORY, AS EXPLAINED BY .LIU, IS STRIKING FOR ITS 
SHARP ATTACK ON,STALIN, WHOM THE CHINESE HAD PREVIOUSLY 
DEFENDED AS HAVING ACCOMPLISHED iu A LA MAO 4.. MORE GOOD 
THAN HARm, LIU ACCUSES STALIN OF HAVING CREATED "A GREAf 
EVIL." IN THE BUREAUCRATIC STATE, OF THEREBY DESTROYING 
THE PARTY AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF BURYING THE ROOTS 'OF 
THE SOCIALIST SYSTEMS AND OF SUPPRESSING DISSIDENT. 
7. BUT MODE IMPORTANTLY, LIU STATES THAT WHAT WENT WRONG 
IN THE SOVIET UN/ON WAS NOT SIMPLY A CASE OF 
THE EXCESSES OF CERTAIN .INCIVIDUALS? MOSCOW'S ERRONEOUS 
INTERNATL AND EXTERNAL POLICIES, HE ASSERTS, .SPRANG FROM THE 
BUREAUCRATIC STRUCTURE THAT WAS FOSTERED IN THE ,SOVIET UNION 
UNDER STALIN. AS LIU AND HIS COLLEAGUES SEE IT, THE EXCESSIVE 
CONCENTRATION oF pOwER IN THE USSR AND THE DESTRUCTION OF 
"SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY". LED 70 THE C--A---I-JN OF A EUREAUCRATIC 
POWER STRUCTURE. (OTHER CHINESE THEORISTS HAVE OCCASIONALLY 
SUGGESTED THAT THE SOVIET BETRAYAL OF SOCIALIST IDEALS 
BEGAN AS EARLY AS LENIN'S TIME.) IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN 
ITS RULE AND SPECIAL PRIVILEGES, THE POWER STRUCTURE 
STRESSED HEAVY INDUSTRY AND MILITARY POWER, WHICH 
GAVE RISE To. AN UNBALANCED ECONOMY AND INTERNAL CONTRA 
DICTIONS, THIS IN TURN REQUIRED EXTERNAL EXPANSION 
AS A SOLUTION. 
6. LIU CONCEDES THAT IT WAS LOGICAL FOR STALIN IN 
THE 20?S AND 30'5 TO EMPHSIZE HEAVY INDUSTRY AND MILITARY 
ARmAmENT BECAUSE OF THE "IMPERIALIST ENCIRCLEMENT" 
AND THE HFASCIST THEREAT" AT THE TIME, NEVERTHELESS,

WHAT STRikES US As MOST INTERESTING ABOUT LIU'S PAPER IS

CHINA HAS DESTROYED THE SOVIET MODEL AND IS DEVELOPING A 
"CHINESE STYLE SOCIALIST ROAD" BY REFORMING BOTH THE 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS. THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON 
HE DRAWS FROM THE SOVIET EXPERIENCE is THE NECESSITY TO 
ELIMINATE POLITICAL AND ECCNUmIc PRIVILEGES AND TO 
ESTABLISH A HIGH?LEVEL OF "SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY.." 
10. IN Pv:.I-v1,1'E. LID'S COLLEAGUE IN THE AcAnEmY uF

ITSELF. HAS BEEN GRAPPLING SINCE LIBERATION WITH. 
THE PROBLEM OF BUREAUCRATIZATION AND THE CONCENTRA-
TION OFPOWER. WHILE FREELY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT ?CHINA HAS A 
LONG WAY TO Go. HE INSISTS THAT THE COUNTRY IS 
MOVING SLOWLY IF SPORADICALLY TOWARD INSTITUTICNALI?
ZATION OF SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY, SPECIFICALLY BY RE-
VITALIZING .LOCAL .ELECTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ORGANS,QwORKERS 
CONGRESSES, AND PRESS CRITICISM OF OFFICIALDOm, AND 
BY DECENTRALIZATION OF DECISION MAKING. LI TOLD 
US RECENTLY THAT CHINA IS STYDYING THE YUGOSLAV AND 
HUNGARIAN EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING A NEW MORE 
DEmOcRtITC MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH THERE IS 
NO PREcEDFNT. HE DESCRIBED THE CHINESE APPROACH AS 
EXPEPImENTAL AND EXTREMELY PRAGMATIC AT THIS PUINTs? 
wITH'FOTURE. ULTIMATE CONFIGURATIONS STILL OBSCURE.
