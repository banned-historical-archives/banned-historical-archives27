 chance to act and impart our stamp of
 approval upon it.
 MONUMENT
 (Mr. HELSTOSKI (at the request of
 Mr. Moss) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD  and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. HELSTOSKI.  Mr. Speaker, on
 May 11, 1965, I had the distinct pleasure
 to be present at the White House when
 President Johnson Issued.a proclamation
 adding Ellis Island to the Statue of Lib-
 erty National Monument,
 In issuing this proclamation that this
 tiny island in New York Bay become a
 part of the Statue of Liberty National
 Monument,  President  Johnson  took
 cognizance of the fact that it has a deep
 significance for over 16 million immi-
 grants who first set foot upon American
 soil when they arrived at historic Ellis
 Island.
 This' event, at the White. House, was
 more than just an invitation to me to be
 present at a ceremonial event. It was
 a memorable occasion because my par-
 ents, both immigrants from Poland, first
 set foot upon the land of the free and
 the home of the brave, when they landed
 at,Ellis I0land,
 Ellis Island came into Federal posses-
 sion in the year 1800. The Federal Bu-
 reau of Immigration took over the facili-
 ties of the island in 1890 to develop it as
 an immigration station, and, between
 1892 and 1954, when the use of Ellis Is-
 land as an immigration depot was dis-
 continued, nearly 70 percent of all the
 immigrants coming to these shores used
 this island as a steppingstone to a better
 way of life.
 The greatness, of America has come
 in no small measure from the millions
 who passed through the gates and doors
 of Ellis Island. They came seeking free-
 dom, liberty and refuge from the un-
 settled condition of their homeland, with
 high hopes of finding peace of mind and
 heart.
 America has offered opportunity to all
 who dreamed and hoped for that one
 new and better chance to improve their
 lot, and found it waiting for them in
 America.  The immigrants who passed
 through Ellis Island and who have at-
 tained prominence in our country made
 a very significant contribution to the
 rise of the United States to a position
 of world power.
 America has grown to greatness be-
 cause its people have a full right to citi-                     eloquent language.  I take the liberty of

 which opened anew life for them.
 Standing as a beacon, inviting all peo-
 ple to come under the shelter of our Na-
 tion, the Statue of Liberty stands in ma-
 jestic glory as a symbol of freedom. To-
 gether with the added facilities of Ellis
 Island it will permit an easier access to
 this Goddess of Liberty.
 In this time of world stress it is proper
 that we repeat a portion of the poem of
 Emma Lazarus which is engraved upon
 a tablet within the pedestal of the statue,
 which so aptly describes this Nation's ac-
 ceptance of the many who still come to
 these shores each year.
 I quote the significant portion of the
 poem,
 Give me your tired, your poor,
 Your huddled masses yearning to breathe
 free,
 The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
 Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to
 me,
 I lift my lamp beside the golden door.
 A GREAT MAN IN MEXICO
 (Mr. GONZALEZ (at the request of
 Mr. Moss) was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. GONZALEZ.  Mr. Speaker, I take
 this welcomed opportunity to call the
 attention of my colleagues and the Amer-
 ican people in general about some of the
 great words of wisdom and courage re-
 cently spoken in Mexico by a man who I
 sincerely believe will go down in history
 as one of the most distinguished, in-
 spired, and intelligent leaders of the
 Americas.  I speak of President Gustavo
 Diaz Ordaz, of Mexico.
 Too often our news media overlooks, or
 just simply does not have the space, to
 bring us up to date about some of the
 transcendentally important doings in
 our neighboring country of Mexico.  I
 have been fortunate enough to have been
 receiving some of the publications widely
 read and disseminated in Mexico and
 have been greatly impressed by some of
 the doings and sayings of this great Pres-
 ident, Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, of Mexico.
 On June 7, Mexico commemorated
 Freedom of the Press Day and the Presi-
 dent of Mexico was the guest of honor at
 a luncheon marking this anniversary.  A
 distinguished Mexican journalist, Miguel
 Lanz Duret, on behalf of the Mexican
 press and journalists, made an intro-
 ductory speech honoring the President.
 The President, in his reply, had some
 priceless sentiments to express in most
 to this shrine of liberty; so that our,  I intend to have more to say about the
 younger people can visit the Goddess of  accomplishments ofrthis great leader, be-

 VALIDITY OF THE IMPORTANCE OF
 FARM ECONOMY TO THE TOTAL
 ECONOMY
 (Mr. HANSEN of Iowa (at the request
 of Mr. Moss) was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. HANSEN of Iowa.  Mr. Speaker,
 recently the Council Bluffs Nonpareil
 printed an editorial regarding the im-
 provement in the economic situation of
 farmers during the early part of 1965.
 The editorial is of value to legislators
 in determining validity of the impor-
 tance of farm economy to the total econ-
 omy of our Nation.  It also indicates
 the reason why a strong farm program
 is imperative if we are to maintain our
 current, farm economy. I commend this
 editorial to my colleagues as an indica-
 tion of the concern we must feel for
 vibrant and comprehensive farm pro-
 grams.  The editorial follows:
 AREA  Hoc  PRODucERS  ENJOYING  EXCELLENT
 PRICES IN 1965
 Most of the experts thought 1965 would
 be a good hog year but nobody expected any-
 thing like this.                                                                                                    Hogs at this writing have
 hit a top of $26 in both Omaha and Chicago,
 a new 11-year high.
 The new Government forecast shows that
 hog production for the balance of this year
 will continue far below normal.  Although
 it has often been said that it is easy to in-
 crease hog numbers with good prices, this
 year seems to disprove the theory.
 Actually, what is beginning to show up
 is the age of the Nation's farmers. Raising
 hogs is hard work and is no job for old men,
 With  most  farm  jobs  becoming   easier
 through- new  automated machinery,    the
 business of raising hogs still remains tedi-
 ous, dirty and time consuming.
 Right here in one of the heaviest hog pro-
 ducing areas in the entire country, there
 are many farms today that do not raise any
 hogs.   As farms are joined together, corn
 production remains high but the production
 of livestock does not increase proportion-
 ately.
 How high the hog price can go is any-
 body's guess.  It is about $3 or $4 per hun-
 dredweight higher than was predicted and
 statistics would tend to prove that slaughter
 numbers will remain low enough to cause
 a real good year.  Accustomed through the
 last 4  or  5 years to a marginal income,
 present-day prices are a welcome event.

 ing to follow Mr. FULBRICHT and the Bobby
 Kennedys, and It Mr. Johnson follows the
 Fulbrights and the Bobby lennedys he need
 not expect GOP support-or support around
 the Nation, either.
 But, Senator MANSFIELD tried to make it
 appear that the Republicans were making
 themselves "the war party." We don't think
 either party is "the war party."  But the
 clear facts. are that all of the wars we have
 fought in this century-and. there now are
 four, all overseas-came under Democratic
 administrations and we have been in no
 war in this century under a Republican ad-
 ministration except to the extent that the
 Korean war was inherited for a brief period.
 One TV network hammers. relentlessly at
 the President by constantly emphasizing, on
 its daily "news show," things which could
 arouse public emotions against the Presi-
 dent's course.  A little girl was killed acci-,
 dentally in Dominica.  It was on the net-
 work air endlessly with the blame placed on
 government forces which the United States
 was pictured as supporting, but which it was
 not supporting.
 Nothing is so precious as a child's life.
 But the United States knowingly killed tens
 of thousands of children and ' women and
 men-with one bomb, at Hiroshima.  The
 British,  with  conventional  bombs, killed
 more children in one German city than the
 United States did at Hiroshima.  They had
 to. We had to That was war. We have war
 now.
 In Vietnam, a TV broadcaster stood out
 in the jungle with half clad people around
 him and tallied about this hopeless war.
 Who is he to say that war being made by
 the United States of America against com-
 munism is a "hopeless war"?
 An "artist group" carries paid advertising
 in newspapers denouncing the President on
 Vietnam, as does a ministerial group, a col-
 lege faculty group, and another group which
 presumably would describe itself as Intel-
 lectuals.  They are Insignificant in numbers,
 unimportant in intelligence, but millions of
 people don't know it.  As long as they have
 money [where do they get it?] to pay for
 getting themselves heard, they get heard.
 Liberals and radicals play up-in horror-
 atrocities, and the "violation of democratic
 processes" ordered in Saigon.  They forget
 that democratic processes become meaning-
 less in time of wax.   Atrocities occur in all
 wars.  The Germans massacred more than 70
 unarmed  American prisoners  of  war  at
 Malmedy in World War II.  Seven American
 soldiers were found on a roadside in. the Ko-
 reanwar, their faces shot away with machine-
 gun fire, their hands tied behind them.                   In
 South Vietnam the people think it is wonder-
 ful when an enemy soldier or civilian is
 executed.  That is why  there have  been
 executions and will be many more in this war.
 If the liberals and the radicals have their
 way-if  they  win  the  war at  home-the
 Unite States will lose the war in Vietnam.
 It's allout time for the American people-
 American leadership,                             nationwide-to rise
 against these forces which want America to

 THE WILMINGTON MORNING NEWS,
 WILMINGTON,  DEL.,  LOOKS  AT
 THE WORLD IN TURMOII,
 The SPEAKER.  Under a previous
 order of the House, the gentleman from
 Delaware [Mr. MCDOWELL], is recognized
 for 10 minutes.
 Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, last
 week the Wilmington Morning News, of
 Wilmington, Del., published four edi-
 torials under the title of "World in
 Turmoil."
 The purpose, as its editors stated, was
 to "explain what we understand U.S.
 policy to be, why we believe, it is impor-
 16003
 tant that it go in the directions it is go-
 ing, and to point out where we believe
 certain changes in emphasis may be in
 order.  Every once in a while, it seems
 to us, a newspaper owes it to its readers
 and itself to pull back from the bustle of
 events and  examine  the intellectual
 foundation of its .day-to-day opinions."
 The editors of this leading newspaper
 came to these conclusions:
 First, there should be even more em-
 phasis on economic and social programs
 than there.is now.  The Organization of
 American States should have some stand-
 ing organization, staffed with economists,
 political scientists, and the like, that
 could be mobilized on short notice for
 situations such as that which occurred in
 the Dominican Republic.  The editors
 hastened to point out that this was not
 to say that the United States should not
 continue to maintain a strong and mobile
 military force in the hemisphere, but
 only that such a force will not solve most
 of the long-run problems the United
 States faces.
 Second, the United States should re-
 move itself as completely as possible from
 the business of bilateral aid dispensing.
 Third, the United States should be
 firm, both in its support for democratic
 institutions and in defense of its interests
 throughout the developing world.
 Fourth, the United States should be
 patient with the developing nations.
 The Wilmington Morning News con-
 cluded that:
 It is in this (developing) world, it seems
 to us, that the future of our civilization may
 well be determined.  And, while every effort
 should be made to resist the temptation to
 be overdramatic about the urgency involved
 in meeting the demands of the people of
 these areas, it would be a tragic mistake to
 underestimate the challenge their awakening
 presents to the United States.  We do not
 believe that special privilege is their just
 reward, but we do believe that deference and
 tolerance should characterize the U.S. atti-
 tude toward their aspirations.
 I found these four editorials informa-
 tive and rewarding reading, and very
 well thought out.  I commend the edi-
 tors of the Wilmington Morning News
 for presenting them, and I recommend
 them to my colleagues for their informa-
 tion and consideration.  I include them
 here as part of my remarks:
 [From the Wilmington (Del.) Morning News,
 July 5, 1965]
 WORLD IN TURMOIL-PART I
 On this, the 189th anniversary of the adop-
 tion of the Declaration of Independence by
 the Continental Congress, let us consider a
 few                                                                 flammatory  lines  from  a  very flam-
 matory  document.  We do so because we
 believe they are pertinent today, and be-
 cause they effectively set the tone for this,
 the first in a series of editorials on U.S.
 foreign policy.
 The, lines. "Ggvernments are instituted
 among men, deriving their just powers from
 the  consent  of  the  governed,  that  when
 ever any form of government becomes de-
 structive of these ends, it is the right of the
 people to alter or to abolish it, and to insti-
 tute new government, laying its foundation
 on such principles and organizing its powers
 in such form, as to them shall seem most
 likely to effect their safety and happiness.

 for light and transient causes; and accord-

 are sufferable, than to right themselves by
 abolishing the forms to which they are ac-
 customed.  But when a long train of abuses
 and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
 same object, evinces a design to reduce them
 under absolute despotism, it is their right,
 it is their duty, to throw off such govern-
 ment, and to provide new guards for their
 future security."
 The  language,  of  course,  dates  these
 thoughts as those of Thomas Jefferson. But
 change a phrase or two and they are as
 fresh as today; the words could easily have
 just been uttered in a basement in Caracas,
 or  rolled  off  a mimeograph machine  in
 Saigon.     One of the central facts of life in
 this year 1965 is that this message has spread
 to every corner of the globe, and men every-
 where are convinced, or ready to be per-
 suaded, that it is their right and duty to
 throw off a "long train of abuses and usurpa-
 tions" and "to provide new guards for their
 future security."
 Since the end of World War II, the world
 has litreally been turned upside down polit-
 ically.   Institutions that stood for cen-
 turies have been wiped away in a moment;
 values that had been cherished for genera-
 tions are now ridiculed to the cheers of
 millions.
 For Americans, these 20 years have been
 particularly disquieting, and instead of wel-
 coming what has been happening, the great
 majority of the citizenry of this land of Jef-
 fersonian heritage has looked upon what has
 been transpiring with bewilderment and, in
 many cases, alarm.  Why?  We leave that to
 the sociologists and psychologists, though we
 suspect that the answer is somehow related
 to America's long history of isolation and its
 material prosperity.  It is enough to say
 that for too many Americans the world has
 become a map on which nations are tinted in
 two colors, theirs and ours.
 Such thinking is perhaps the more prev-
 alent because of the success of the Soviet
 Union and its friends in exporting dialectic
 materialism. So adept have the Communists
 become at taking advantage of social up-
 heaval and economic disruption to serve their
 own purposes that a large body of Americans
 can maintain the fervor that all that is hap-
 pening is simply the execution of a plot by
 a clique oj' schemers seeking world domina-
 tion.
 U.S. foreign policy for the past 20 years has
 reflected  this  disquiet  among  Americans.
 With respect to the winds of change that have
 swept the world during that period, the
 questions for policymakers have been three:
 Does America oppose all revolution because
 it is being used as a tool by the Communists
 to further their aim of world domination?
 Does America tolerate revolution, but keep
 ever watchful for the real enemy-commu-
 nism--and sacrifice revolution when there is
 a chance it might serve communism?  Does
 America encourage revolution and identify
 with it, being convinced that to oppose it is
 a greater danger in the long run than com-
 munism ever will be?
 At various times, U.S. policymakers have
 answered yes to each of these questions.
 That the results of those responses has been
 varied is apparent by the unsatisfactory posi-
 tion in which the United States finds itself
 today in some parts of the world.  But in
 general, we believe it can be said that U.S.
 foreign policy has been most successful when
 it answered yes to the last question.  We
 say this, acknowledging that in a conglom-
 erate world there can never be only one
 solution for every international problem.
 Nevertheless, to say this is to suggest that
 there should be a reexamination of many of
 the precepts of U.S. foreign policy that have
 become axiomatic in the past 20 years.  This
 we intend to do in subsequent editorials on
 U.S. foreign policy -in relation to the Com-
 munist world, to the developed world, and to
 the underdeveloped world.
 Central to our thinking throughout this
 discussion is an optimism about the future
 of the United States, and a pride in the
 durability and flexibility of historic Ameri-
 can values.  We believe the world is a better
 place today than it was 20 years ago, a better
 place than it was 189 years ago. True, it still
 leaves a lot to be desired, but this is no cause
 for despair-it is rather, cause for rededica-
 tion and initiative.
 WORLD IN TURMOIL-PART II
 Ask 100 Americans what is the principal
 threat to the United States in the world
 today,                    and, we suspect, 99 will say com-
 munism.  But then ask what they mean by
 communism and the answers will be as dif-
 ferent as the answerers.
 This may not have been true 20 years ago,
 when the Soviet Union was the fountain-
 head of Communist ideology and the ac-
 knowledged military master of Eurasia.  But
 today  communism  is a bit of everything:
 Wars of liberation, the Russians, brainwash-
 ing, Titoism, Red China, commodity dump-
 ing.
 States  with  collective  political systems
 clearly  continue   to  threaten the United
 States, but they no longer present a unified
 threat, because there is no longer a unified
 Communist world.        The current difficulties
 between    Russia  and  China  are evidence
 enough of this.
 And yet, it must be admitted that there
 is still a strong sympathy among Communist
 states for each other, a sympathy which could
 lead to their joining together in the event of
 some international showdown.  But is it
 realistic to continue to conduct American
 foreign policy as if there were a unified
 threat, or as if a showdown is the most im-
 mediate threat?  We do not believe it is, in
 the face of the evidence of the past 10 years,
 when the U.S. main problems have been a
 guerrilla war here and a coup there.   But
 much U.S. policy continues to be built on
 the premise than the principal threat from
 the Communist world is a military one and,
 more particularly, a nuclear one.
 The lesson of the Cuban missile crisis of
 1962 was that this is no longer true, for the
 Soviet Union indicated quite clearly then
 that it was not willing to risk nuclear war
 to further its expansionist policies.
 But what of China, the only other Com-
 munist country which will have nuclear ar-
 maments in the conceivable future?   The
 answer is  not clear.  Mao Tse-tung has
 boasted of fighting a war with the West,
 losing 300 million people, and still winning,
 and there has been nothing from China to
 indicate that nuclear war is not in its plans.
 Yet this is not a wholly satisfactory answer
 from the U.S. point of view, for it is too
 Indefinite.   The United States is still left
 with the awful question:  Is or isn't nu-
 clear war with China a possibility?  China
 will not provide the answer, because it is to
 her advantage to keep her intentions a secret
 and keep her opponents off balance.
 We believe the United States should oper-
 ate on the assumption that such a war is
 not inevitable: if it were, the Government
 would be guilty of the greatest negligence
 if It did not fight that war now, when its
 chances of winning are best.  To say that it
 is not inevitable is not to abandon nuclear
 capability, and Is not to face the future
 without trepidation.  It is also, however, not
 to be without a sense of optimism for the
 future,  and an optimism with some basis
 -in experience.  Red China is a developing
 society, and the more developed a society, the
 more unthinkable nuclear war appears.
 But if the threat from communism in the
 future is neither a unified one nor a nuclear
 one, what is it?   To quote George Eennan:
 "The ideological contest, as the Communists
 see it, is not only an intellectual competition
 but a political competition.  It is a political
 competition that involves not only the minds
 of men, but also, their fears-a competition
 that does not entirely respect what is in
 men's minds because it does not fully recog-
 nize the organized expression of popular
 will."
 In such competition, anything goes: Wars
 of liberation, terror, subversion, propaganda;
 the real opponent is never directly involved.
 He depends, instead, on others to be on the
 platform or in the jungle, while he supplies
 the financial and moral support.  And, be-
 cause  the  opponent  never  shows  himself
 publicly, there is the ever-present danger of
 seeing him where he isn't or not seeing him
 where he is.
 Compounding the problem is the fact that
 this competition is taking place in a world
 that is already undergoing social revolution.
 Was the revolution in Santo Domingo a Com-
 munist affair, or was it a legitimate protest?
 And If it was legitimate was it in danger of
 being taken over by Communists or was it
 not?  The answers to these questions are- not
 certain 2 months after the event, yet they
 have great implication for U.S. policy.
 Perhaps the United States can afford to act
 as it did in one Santo Domingo, but what is
 to be done when the revolution is in a coun-
 try less accessible to U.S. power, or when
 three or four such events occur at once?
 Policy should be prepared for this eventual-
 ity, and it is clear that neither the older
 regional organizations of the world, like the
 Organization of American States, nor the
 newer treaty organizations developed by the
 late Mr. Dulles are adequate to do the job.
 They have not worked in southeast Asia, the
 Middle East, or Latin America.
 Because these organizations are geared to
 combat a threat that exists now in vastly
 altered form, they lack flexibility and are not
 particularly  susceptible to reorganization.
 And yet the United States, as powerful as it
 is, cannot win this competition alone.
 What then?  Consideration might be given
 to the gradual abandonment of these orga-
 nizations, and their replacement with new
 groupings which would have economic and
 social reform as their primary focus.  These
 new organizations could also be anchored
 by some other power than the United States.
 Serious study might also be given to the
 United  Nations  international  police force
 suggested by several European countries and
 endorsed by President Johnson.
 The steps in this direction  should       be
 studied and accompanied by political and
 economic policies that recognize and encour-
 age individuality among Communist states.
 To continue to think of communism in the
 terms  of  a  monolithic  world conspiracy
 promises the United States no benefits and
 possibly great harm.
 WORLD IN TURMOIL-PART III
 The United States is fond of looking east
 across the Atlantic and rubbing its hands in
 satisfaction at the fine job it has done in
 Western Europe.  The Marshall plan and the
 North Atlantic Treaty Organization, two of
 the greatest creations of American foreign
 policy, helped Europe out of economic chaos
 and pulled her away from the political brink
 so effectively that she is now a strong rival
 for her old benefactor.
 A consequence of this pride has been the
 development  in  the  United  States  of  a
 maternal attitude toward Western Europe,
 with all the attendant emotionalism.  When
 General de Gaulle questions U.S. policy in
 Vietnam, or Harold Wilson offers alternatives
 to American nuclear policy, the reaction in
 this country is much like that of the mother
 who discovers her child can think for him-
 self and that thinking for himself includes
 questioning mother: It had to come, but it
 isn't really welcome.
 But Europe has grown tall now and, as
 unpleasant as it may be, America must face

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROBERT B. DUNCAN
 OF OREGON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, July 13, 1965
 Mr.                     DUNCAN  of  Oregon.   Mr.
 Speaker, the applause can still be heard
 from the 140 million Americans who
 work and live in urban areas.  They are
 applauding the action of the House in
 passing the bill authorizing the new
 Department of Housing and Urban De-
 velopment.
 There are many problems facing the
 urban centers of this country which
 need the top-level representation they
 will receive when the Department of
 Housing and Urban Development be-
 comes law.
 The Eugene Register-Guard, a fine
 newspaper in my district, pointed out
 the need for such a Department in an
 editorial on June 18, 1965:
 America's most crucial domestic problem
 is no longer the farm economy but the prob-
 lem, of city living.  Our Nation is bulldozing
 1 million acres a year into the urban sprawl.
 The Nation just has to give increased at-
 tention to cities.
 1; support this editorial when it states
 that more attention must be given to
 urban areas. I hope the Senate will join
 with us in the House in supporting Pres-
 ident Johnson's proposal to create a De-
 partment of Housing and Urban Devel-
 opment, which will assist urban areas in
 getting the attention they need in the
 form of a Cabinet-level representation.
 With consent, I place the editorial in

 from time to time, engage in such operations.
 To employ force abroad without the declara-

 2. More specifically, to endow  American
 forces with a combat role-a phrase which
 could have been rendered so simply in Latin,
 and would have been understood by any em-

 to endow them with the same responsibility
 as once belonged to the Roman and the
 British soldiers on the frontiers of empire.
 That, American soldiers  in  farflung prov-

 seems peculiar only if one does not acknowl-

 Iii T11F HOtTSEOF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, July 13, 1965
 Mr; DEWINSKI,  Mr, Speaker, the
 President is under increasing pressure
 from the organized left and many in-
 nocent Americans who have,been caught
 in its web of propaganda aimed at our
 policy In Vietnam. An article by colum-
 nist William S.. .White, which appeared
 in the Saturday, July 3 edition of the
 Chicago Daily News, is especially appro-
 priate in its emphasis on the dangers of
 appeasing the Reds, a subject that
 should be thoughtfully studied:
 APPEASING  THE REDS
 (By William S. White)
 ~WASHUgGTON.-The big push is now on to
 compel the United States to submit to Com-
 munist blackmail in Vietnam In the name of
 a peace that would be a, Munich of the
 sixties-a surrender:, to the veiled blade of.
 Co{Itmunist aggression as Munich was to the
 naked blade of.Hitler.
 Voices In the Senate are joined by many
 "European voices in demands that this coun-
 try deal with and thus Iigitlmize the Viet-
 cong insurgents in  South  Vietnam  who
 are, in plainer words, the spearheads of a
 Communist  invasion  directed from Red,
 China by way of North Vietnam.
 ..
 4ll,the forces of international and unin-
 tentional,pacifism are gathering in supreme
 effort.  The sum of their case..is?  ,at the
 [Tnited States must  be more reasonable
 toward those who. break the world's peace
 by open military assault upon South Viet-
 nam.
 The nation that. now all but alone carries
 the burden. to resist the new Communist im-
 perialism finds itself attacked far more viru-
 lently, at home and in Europe, than are
 those who carry forward this cynical pattern
 of conquest.
 4 V.S. Senat6r, FRANK CHURCH of. Idaho,
 joins the clamor for what, however fuzzed
 over, would amount to recognition of the
 Vietcoh}g as though this marauding bandit-
 'Communist group had a legitimate place at
 any peace table. - He is saluted by other
 Democratic soft-liners in the Senate and is
 echoed by a. former British foreign minister
 still very close to the British Lai?or Govern-.
 mefht, Patrick Gordon Walker,
 ThG 13      s is prepared to allow the
 Vietcgng to sit at. any honest, peace table,

 The day we permit them real, participation
 would be the day we set the seal of consent
 upon the concealed-blade technique of Com-
 Yes, the Push is on,  And those prepared
 to take up their adult responsibilities in a
 tough world must face it that their only
 reward is likely to be the consciousness of
 duty done.  For the other side has all the
 appealing words-"peace" and all that.  And
 the hammering grows harder and harder from
 domestic politicians and foreign politicians-
 and much of the European press-who simply
 want out of Vietnam and out from under
 our solemn obligations there.
 One can see this pounding in the outcries
 at President Johnson for committing two
 dreadful crimes at the recent anniversary
 meeting of the United Nations.  One crime
 was to withhold an immediate promise to
 pick up even more of the tab for running
 the U.N. so that the Russians and others
 could continue to refuse to pay even a small
 share.  The other crime was the President's
 tactless determination not to cut and run in
 Vietnam and his even more tactless act of
 identifyin  the aggressor out loud.
 It is a strange world. Those who do their
 hard duty are denounced for it and those
 who wish to cut and ruff are the 'reasonable"
 men.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CHARLES A. VANIK
 or OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, July 13, 1965
 Mr. VANIK.  Mr. Speaker, during the
 past weeks since the excie tax reduction
 has taken effect, I have been attempting
 to call, to the attention of the American
 consumers and retailers the problems
 that have arisen in passing the reduc-
 tion on to the consumer.
 In this continuing effort, I wish to in-
 sert an article from the Fairchild News
 Service publication, Home Furnishing
 Daily, which outlines some of the prob-
 lem areas in connection with the excise
 tax reduction.
 Popular demand is the only course to
 the benefits ofthe tax-cut. While many
 of us can campaign for "truth in prices,"
 all of our efforts have little meaning if
 the  public  is  apathetic  about  the
 absorption of this tax.
 I again suggest that retailers take ad-
 vantage publicly of this excise tax re-
 duction by making clear statements in
 all of their advertising about lower prices
 on an item-by-item basis, as a result of
 the excise tax reduction.  Any retailer
 would be wise to take advantage of this
 splendid opportunity to show the con-
 sumer of his desire to be fair and not
 subject the consumer to the mercy of
 the marketplace.
 The Fairchild article follows:
 TAX REPEAL SPURS PRICE CRAZY QUILT, PUBLIC
 Is APATHETIC
 Repeal   of                                             Federal   excise   taxes   has
 brought-
 Consumer apathy.
 Some retail willingness to cut prices below
 levels provided by the tax repeal.
 A sharp attack on those producers who
 have not reduced their prices.
 A crazy mixed up condition in the electric
 housewares field where some manufacturers
 have been laggard on posting new prices.
 Since repeal went into effect Tuesday, a
 cross-the-Nation  spot  survey by Fairchild
 News Service Indicates:
 A3727
 Major appliances made modest gains, with
 more substantial increases expected. Air
 conditioners in several cities were still slug-
 gish because of continued cool weather, al-
 though New York reported gains.
 Electric housewares remained about steady,
 with gains of a more modest nature than
 major appliances expected in the future.
 Home  entertainment  products  remained
 stable, with gains predicted.
 In the New York area, customers aren't
 stampeding to their favorite store to buy any
 of the products with newly lowered prices.
 Sales  in  all  categories  remained fairly
 steady, and retailers failed to note any defi-
 nite gains that could be attributed to the tax
 removal.
 Bigger ticket items picked up modestly,
 and air conditioner sales have been brisk the
 past 2 days, although retailers credited hot
 humid weather rather than the tax elimina-
 tion.
 As several dealers commented, "we would
 have sold air conditioners during this period
 even if prices had gone up 6 percent, instead
 .of coming down.  When it gets this hot those
 who want one are not going to sweat out
 the weath.er just to save a couple of bucks."
 . Home   entertainment  volume  remained
 steady.
 In Cleveland fair improvement in sales of
 major appliances was noted by department
 and specialty stores as a result of the excise
 tax action.
 No great amount of increased business was
 noted, however, on sales of television and
 electric housewares which had been holding
 up well.  The weather apparently was con-
 tinuing to put a damper on any real activity
 on air conditioners.
 Major appliances, however, have been in
 the doldrums for the past 2 or S weeks, with
 many buyers and retailers indicating they
 believed this stemmed from the tax repeal
 talk.
 In St. Louis, retailers believe the potential
 lift to sales following removal of excise taxes
 is substantial, but they emphasize that it
 is much too early. to attempt measuring the
 results.
 There has been no mad rush to buy, al-
 though heavy rainfall Tuesday and Wednes-
 day and the likelihood of scattered showers
 through the remainder of the week were
 blamed with. holding down store traffic.
 In Atlanta, while there has been little con-
 sumer reaction to price reductions in hard
 goods, retailers are optimistic the tax repeal
 will give lagging sales a needed shot in the
 arm.
 All retailers agreed it is too early to de-
 termine what long range affect the repeal
 will have on the appliance-television busi-
 ness,  although they expect it to pick up
 within the next several days and accelerate
 into coming weeks.
 Air conditioning business has been mis-
 erably cool this season, but cool weather and
 not price is blamed.
 In Charlotte, N.C.,  retailers  are not  in
 accord on consumer reaction to the excise
 tax repeal, although all report there   was
 more reaction to prospects of the action 2
 Weeks ago.
 Some say the situation has made no no-
 ticeable difference in business, that this is
 a quiet season when attention is focused on
 vacations and not housewares purchases, and
 that the tax repeal will be a boon to future
 business.
 Others, however, say the repeal has had
 some effect, and will further spark customer
 buying in the future..
 Electric housewares ads tied to the tab
 have been almost nil as dealers await guid-
 ance from manufacturers.
 In Los Angeles,  excise  tax  repeals  had
 little or no positive effect on hard goods
 sales this week, retailers said.
 "The public still is confused," observed one
 key chain  official. "Many customers   still

 think they are entitled to 10 percent reduc-
 tions."
 Most retailers had reduced prices on many
 major appliances and home entertainment
 equipment in advance of a date the tax re-
 peals were made law.  These price cuts In
 most cases were based on early oxclse tax
 figurer circulated by suppliers.
 Distributors and retailers reported new-
 price posting by electric housewares manu-
 facturers has lagged, compared with major
 appliance and TV producers, but that new
 portable appliance prices steadily were being
 received this week.
 White Stores, Inc., in its anniversary sale
 ad continues to list some price comparisons,
 but most stores are content to talk savings
 generally  rather   than  price  specifics.
 White's anniversary sale ad lists a Catalina
 brand 15-cubic-foot "no-frost-refrigerator-
 freezer at a regular price of $349.95, with a
 tax reduction of $10 and a "new bell price"
 of $339.95. A trade-in offer in the ad, how-
 ever, brought the price down by a total of
 $51.07 to a low of $288.88.
 Some of the stores mention savings on
 last-year models in the air-conditioning line.
 Others push annual summer sales and spe-
 cial purchases throughout appliances and
 electric lines.
 Sales have yet to react too strongly to the
 tax repeal.  "It hasn't come yet but we think
 It will" is the opinion of many dealers.
 In Cincinnati, major appliance business
 has soared since the tax lift and home enter-
 tainment sales have shown moderate gains,
 but local retailers are thanking the weather-
 man, not the Government.
 The hottest day of the year (92) hit Tues-
 'day, bringing a sudden and long-awaited
 consumer rush on air conditioners, fans and
 iefrigerators, dealers reported.
 The upsurge has brought with it retailer
 optimism that customers looking for relief
 for what appears to be a sustained heat spell,
 will take advantage of the tax out while
 they're at it by making other purchases In
 both white and brown goods.
 At this point, retail prices are reflecting
 a greater reduction than provided for by
 the tax cut.  Most dealers are basing new
 prices on a new cost to them plus 10 percent
 markup.
 In Dallas its almost like a game of "but-
 ton, button, who's got the tax cut" as the
 trade advertises excise tax repeal, seasonal
 reductions, and special purchase buys In
 housewares, home entertainment and ap-
 pliances.
 One store reported a number of extremely
 irate customers who were expecting a full
 10-percent reduction at retail.  This store
 has been In sale events for the past several
 days, but the picture has been confused by
 consumer expectations for wide-scale 10-per-
 cent cuts.  "Our prices have been adjusted
 to reflect the tax cut," this dealer said,
 Several stores are going the complete limit,
 dealers reported, with reductions in home
 entertainment lines slashed drastically. One
 retailer,told of a $100 price cut on an upper
 end stereo that had only a $56 tax repeal.
 Housewares prices dipped somewhere from
 5 to 7 percent on the small electrics.
 Price promotions in appliances, for the
 most part, were confined to statements such
 as "passing on the tax cut savings" * *
 "reduced more than excise cut" " ? * "Fed-
 eral tax repealed-buy now and save."
 In Washington, the excise tax repeal did
 not produce an initial customer rush to the
 stores.  Some merchants said activity during
 the first few days following the  tax cut
 showed some improvement but they do not
 feel it resulted from the excise repeal..
 "It's too early to tell," said one buyer,
 who  added  that  business  has shown  no
 change. 'since the Tuesday effective date.
 Another said traffic has improved but at-
 tributes it more to the hot weather which
 has stimulated air conditioner business.
 One retailer pointed out that several stores
 advertised reduced prices prior to the effec-
 tive date to stall off a consumer buying
 cutback.  "We haven't noticed any increase
 in business since Tuesday, but we reduced
 prices early," said one.
 In San Francisco, there has: been little
 variation in sales volume since the repeal
 went into effect.
 Most retailers were too involved in their
 own confusing situations to give more than
 token recognition to sales.
 "I'm in no position to answer," One de-
 partment store buyer said; "I'm up to my
 neck in it." The buyer said his store's policy
 was to pass savings on fully to the customer.
 "In many cases we're giving more," he said.
 "We're giving too much and the prices were
 not established by us.  He said a legitimate
 $27 retail adjustment was coming out to $40.
 "This was another golden opportunity for
 us to stabilize our profit structure," he said.
 California Develops Farm Labor Surplus
 With Active Recruiting of Domestic
 Workers
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. EDWARD R. ROYBAL
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 8., 1965
 Mr. ROYBAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to
 take this opportunity to insert' in the
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a most encourag-
 ing article from the June 27, 1965, edition
 of the Los Angeles Times, which tells the
 remarkable success story achieved by the
 American economy this year in finding
 work for many thousands of U.S. citizens
 In the fields and on the farms of the
 West.
 The article, written by the Times' la-
 bor editor, Harry Bernstein, is primarily
 concerned with the highly successful
 transition California's agricultural in-
 dustry has been able to make from its
 former major reliance on a foreign labor
 supply, to an almost complete use of
 domestic workers this year.
 But it also illustrates the outstanding
 capacity of American agriculture gener-
 ally to shake off its past unhealthy de-
 pendence on imported foreign labor, and
 by improving wages and working con-
 ditions, to attract a sufficient number of
 skilled, dependable U.S. fieldhands to
 meet critical harvesttime labor need.
 The Times' article follows:
 SURPLUS  LOOMS  IN  FARM  LABOR,  TIEBURG
 PREDICTS
 (By Harry Bernstein)
 California will have a surplus of farm
 labor for the rest of the summer, State Em-
 ployment Director Albert Tieburg predicted
 Saturday.
 In an assessment of the State's multi-
 billion-dollar  farm  industry,  Tieburg  told
 the Times:
 "It now looks as though we will have a
 surplus  of  workers through the summer
 months.  The State's needs will sharply in-
 crease by the early part of September, but
 it is possible we may be able to get through
 even that crisis period without foreign work-
 ers."
 And Washington officials are now con-
 vinced that by next year there will be no
 need for any foreign workers.
 TOMATOES POSSIBLE
 Last year at this time there were 34,000
 foreign workers in California.  And by Sep-
 tember 16 of last year there were 63,900.
 Tieburg said his estimates are preliminary.
 and that he hopes to have more precise
 estimates of labor needs by July 15.
 The crop most likely to need foreign work-
 ers, he said, will be canning tomatoes.
 "But it is possible that the tomato harvest
 needs could be met if some drastic changes
 are made to make the jobs more attractive.
 "The tomatoes now are loaded in 50-pound
 boxes.  This pretty much eliminates hus-
 band-wife teams and women workers.  If
 the box sizes could be cut and rates on a
 piece-rate basis  raised  substantially, field
 sanitation increased and other benefits pro-
 vided, the labor needs might be met."
 But tomato harvesting, he noted, is an
 especially difficult job, compared with tree
 crops, and it will not be easy to attract
 enough workers especially because the peak
 labor need in the State comes just as young
 workers are starting to return to school.
 Nevertheless, Tieburg Said, the State may
 be faced with the paradox of having a sur-
 plus of farmworkers even in the fall, and
 still face a shortage of workers in the to-
 mato harvest.
 While the final estimates are not yet avail-
 able, it is known that the tomato harvesting
 machine is In part responsible for estimates
 that relatively few foreign workers, if any,
 will be needed for the early fall.
 The huge machines, which can pick 100
 tons of tomatoes a day, each replace about
 40 workers or more.
 Last year there were less than 100 such
 machines in ' operation in the State.
 This year, according to Robert Holt, presi-
 dent of the Tomato Harvesting Association.,
 the number is 262,  'and by next year it
 should be over 500 machines."
 CUT IN NUMBER
 This means the number of workers needed
 this season will be cut by over 6,000 from
 last year because of the machines.  And by
 next year, the machines will be able to re-
 place another 10,000.
 Also, the growers last year had planted
 143,000 acres of tomatoes.  This year the
 number has been cut to 110,000.
 Holt said he originally recommended the
 acreage cut because of a heavy carryover of
 canned tomatoes from last year.
 In other words, the original suggestions to
 growers that they reduce their acreage of
 tomato plantings by 23 percent this year
 was based on an oversupply of canned to..
 matoes, not on an anticipated labor shortage.
 But  Holt  said  the  canning  companies
 moved their carryover from last year much
 faster than expected, and so the acreage cut-
 back ended up being due in part to the ex-
 pectation of labor shortages.
 Workers are still pouring into California
 at an unprecedented rate, but Tieburg said
 the rate is decreasing rapidly and will be
 down sharply "as the word spreads that we
 have no urgent farm labor needs."
 Department of Agriculture inspection sta-
 tions  along California's borders  estimated
 that about 100 cars a day are coming into
 the State with farm workers, compared with
 about 25 a day at this time last year.
 COUNT DROPS
 Holt said the tomato growers are not nearly
 as optimistic as Tieburg, who said he is
 "hopeful" but not confident that the to-
 mato growers will be able to get by with
 only a few foreign workers, if any.
 Tieburg pointed out that the number of
 domestic farm workers in the State drops
 rapidly from early September to the middle
 of- October each year, and begins to drop
 even earlier because of a return to school.
 The aim this year, Tieburg said, is to keep
 in farm labor jobs the thousands'of workers
 who normally leave the farms just as the
