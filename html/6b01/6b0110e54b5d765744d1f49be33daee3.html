HIGHLIGHTS 
The USSR will probably endeavor to make its attack 
upon the Atlantic Pact the principal theme of the forthcoming 
UN General Assembly sessions which begin at Lake Success 
on 5 April. The Italian colonies question will be the only 
problem of major substantive importance to confront the dele-
gates; its solution will depend primarily upon the ability of 
the non-Soviet bloc to reach solid agreement (see page 3). 
Meanwhile, the mildness of the Soviet reaction to the western 
Berlin currency changeover continues to contrast with the 
vigor of the Soviet opposition to the Atlantic Pact (see page 5). 
The steady trend toward stabilization of the military 
situation in Palestine may be checked momentarily by the 
army coup in Syria, through delaying indefinitely the scheduled 
negotiations between Syria and Israel, but the over-all military 
situation in Palestine will not be materially affected by this 
delay (see page 9). The Syrian coup will probably not appreci-
ably damage US-Syrian relations but it may set off disturbances 
in other Arab states, particularly Iraq and Egypt, whose gov-
ernments probably could not survive a serious outbreak. 
A "peace conference" between representatives of 
the Chinese Communists and the National Government began 
in Peiping on 1 April. The Communist plan to present the 
Nationalists with a set of "eight demands," which Acting - 
President Li obviously Is not capable of meeting in full, will 
enable the Communists to retain the initiative throughout the 
conference (see page 11).

UNITED NATIONS 
The forthcoming session of the General Assembly 
will focus on the disposition of the Italian colonies, the 
Spanish issue, and probably on a Soviet attack on the Atlantic 
Pact. The Italian colonies question is the only important 
substantive matter, and its solution will depend primarily 
upon the ability of the non-Soviet world to reach agreement. 
However, both the Atlantic Pact and the Spanish case will 
offer fertile ground for Soviet propaganda attacks. Soviet 
obstructionism during the forthcoming session will thus be 
most prominent in the propaganda field. Minor issues to be 
discussed include Israeli membership in the UN, the Minds-
zenty trial, and South African discrimination against Indians 
In that country. 
Atlantic Pact The USSR may well introduce a resolution 
condemning the Atlantic Pact as threatening 
world peace and undermining the UN. Although the Soviet 
case is weak, the USSR will use the Assembly as a sounding 
board for the Soviet propaganda "peace" theme. Through 
this propaganda approach, the USSR will attempt to pose 
(especially for home consumption) as a defender of the UN 
and will try to weaken popular support for the Pact by stimu-
lating the doubts of those western elements who still believe 
the UN should be the sole bulwark of world peace. 
Spain If the Spanish case comes up in the Assembly, the 
subsequent discussion will resolve itself primarily 
into a propaganda battle which may link Spain to the Atlantic 
Pact and prove embarrassing to the US. Although Poland 
has announced that it will seek to withdraw its proposal for 
strengthening the 1946 GA resolution (which provided for the 
recall of chiefs of mission to Spain and a ban on Spanish

participation in UN specialized agencies), certain Latin 
American nations may seize the initiative and propose 
that these prohibitions be eased. The USSR would inter-
pret such a Latin American move as US-inspired and 
could accuse the West of having taken the initiative in 
aiding the Franco regime. Moreover, the USSR could 
attack any pro-Spanish moves as preliminary western 
steps toward admitting Spain to the Atlantic Pact. Liberal 
opinion in the US and Western Europe may prove particu-
larly susceptible to these charges. Although most Western 
European nations prefer to postpone discussion on the 
Spanish issue, introduction of a Latin American resolution 
would probably result in liberalization of the 1946 ban. 
Italian Colonies The outcome of GA voting on the disposi-
tion of the Italian colonies, particularly 
TripoMania, is impossible to predict at this time because 
of the many conflicting interests and alternative solutions 
(see Article, page17). The return of Somaliland to Italy 
and the US-UK proposal for ceding most of Eritrea to 
Ethiopia will probably be approved, however, although the 
vote on the latter proposal may be very close. Approval 
of UK trusteeship over Cyrenaica is a strong possibility, 
but an effort will be made to make it conditional upon re-
turn of Tripolitania to Italy. With regard to Tripolitania, 
one of the following solutions appears most probable: 
(1) Italian trusteeship, which is favored by most Latin 
American nations and some Western European countries, 
notably France; (2) US trusteeship, as proposed by the UK, 
which would undoubtedly appeal to the local Arab population; 
or (3) multi-power trusteeship which, although administra-
tively cumbersome, might have the most universal appeal. 
Any trusteeship will most likely be accompanied by guarantees 
of gradual local self-government and eventual independence.

Italy's prospects for Tripolitunian trusteeship are 
improved because of Italian participation in the Atlantic 
Pact and in other European unity projects; however, with-
out US-UK support, this solution could not be carried. US 
trusteeship would certainly meet with opposition from the 
USSR and probably from France, which fears the effect on 
its North African colonies. If a stalemate develops on 
Trip?Mania, the GA may vote to postpone this issue until 
the next session. It is even possible that certain Latin 
American states, in an attempt to use Cyrenaica as a ? 
bargaining point for obtaining Italian trusteeship over 
TripoMania, may insist that the disposition of all Libya 
be postponed. As an alternative, they may seek to have 
all of Libya included in any multilateral trusteeship.

WESTERN EUROPE 
GERMANY 
Berlin Currency The mildness of the initial Soviet reaction 
to the western sector currency change-
over in Berlin is probably the result of its gradual nature and 
the Soviet desire to await further developments. Under the 
currency directive issued by the western military governors: 
(1) certain time limits will be imposed upon continued use of 
the east mark in the western sectors; (2) western sector resi-
dents will be permitted to exchange 15 east marks for an 
equal number of west marks; and (3) the number of west marks 
in circulation in western Berlin has been increased. Because 
the east mark is still legal and can be used during the next 
few weeks for paying rents, taxes, and rations and because 
western sector residents working in the Soviet sector will, 
for the present at least, continue to be able to exchange part 
of their east marks for west marks, no reason exists for 
immediate Soviet retaliation. The Soviet Military Administra-
tion (SMA) has already promised that western sector residents 
will not be restrained from spending east marks for unrationed, 
luxury goods in "free shops" of the Soviet sector. Although 
the USSR can take retaliatory action at any time, it now appears 
that such action may be postponed until the effects of the cur-
rency reform become more apparent. Such counteraction may 
be timed to coincide wita increasing restrictions against the 
east mark in western Berlin. The USSR may decide to institute 
an east mark currency reform which would invalidate the 300-
400 million east marks now estimated to be in western sector 
banks. Current Soviet tactics in Berlin may reflect the reported 
recommendation of Soviet Political Adviser Semenov for a 
milder over-all Soviet German policy. In addition, the USSR 
may wish to avoid drastic retaliatory measures lest these 
measures: (1) boomerang against the USSR by further reducing 
economic activity in the Soviet zone and decreasing Communist 
popularity there; and (2) detract from present Soviet efforts to 
convince the world of the USSR's peaceful intentions.

UNITED KINGDOM 
Commonwealth Conference The hurriedly summoned con-
ference of Commonwealth prime 
ministers, which convenes in London on 21 April, will concern 
itself primarily with the constitutional problem raised by 
India's announced intention of becoming a republic. Some 
formula will be sought which: (1) will enable India, as a re-
public, to retain membership in a Commonwealth whose only 
formal tie is the crown; and (2) will not conflict with the 
desire of some older dominions (notably Australia) that nothing 
be done to impair the prestige of the crown. A principal 
reason for making concessions to India on this issue, and for 
speed in so doing, is the need of the UK (and Australia) to 
obtain Indian assistance in combatting the growing pressure 
of Communism in Southeast Asia. India's constitutional status 
must be clarified first, however, because Indian assistance in 
combatting Communism would probably be most effective if 
India joined Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Ceylon 
under Commonwealth auspices in some such "regicnal associa-
tion "as that suggested by UK Foreign Secretary Bevin at the 
1948 Commonwealth Conference. The 'regional association" 
idea is likely to be further explored in informal discussions 
at the April conference. 
Jet Aircraft The approaching necessity for decisions on 
military aid commitments under the North 
Atlantic Pact is forcing the UK to review the British jet air-
craft program. At present the UK must allocate its limited 
jet production to: (1) meeting existing export commitments 
to foreign countries; (2) aiding Benelux nations under the 
Brussels treaty; (3) doubling the jet fighter strength of the 
Royal Air Force; and (4) continuing token aid to friendly 
countries, whether Pact members or not. jet equipment is 
now a profitable item on the British export list. If strategic 
planning following ratification of the Atlantic Pact leads to a 
redirection of jet exports, thus reducing foreign exchange 
earnings, the British will probably ask the US to underwrite 
the loss.

IRELAND 
Foreign Policy Although the Irish Government has rejected 
membership in the North Atlantic Pact, 
opposition within the country to this isolationist stand is 
steadily increasing. The Government refused to Join the Pact 
because the Irish feel that the partition issue makes a mili-
tary alliance with the UK impossible. The Church and those 
who opposed severance of the Commonwealth link, however, 
are putting pressure on the Government to consider a more 
cooperative attitude toward the Atlantic Pact nations. Although 
there is no likelihood of a sudden modification of policy, it is 
possible that the Government may eventually be willing to nego-
tiate individual pacts with North Atlantic countries other than 
the UK or will seek to appease advocates for Irish participation 
In the Pact by emphasizing that Ireland will do its duty as 
"a christian nation" in the event of war. 
BELGIUM 
Belgian Elections Rapidly deteriorating relations between 
the two coalition parties (Catholic and 
Socialist) may result in a decision to advance the date of the 
general elections now scheduled for the autumn of 1949. 
Socialist-Catholic disagreement over methods of financing 
unemployment compensation, intensified by pre-electoral 
campaigning, is preventing constructive government action 
on other matters. Any electoral action before late May or 
June, however, is unlikely because: (1) most importantly, 
Premier Spaak is determined not to allow the dissolution of 
Parliament to interfere with ratification of the Atlantic Pact; 
and (2) the necessity exists for a prior decision by Parlia-
ment on the advancement of the date of the women's franchise 
and the reapportionment of parliamentary seats on the basis 
of the new census.

FRENCH NORTH AFRICA 
Anti-French Forces More effective opposition to French 
authority in North Africa will emerge 
If growing collaboration between the Communist and Nation-
alist parties results in the formation of a new political organi-
zation combining dissident and extremist elements from both 
groups. Both Communists and Nationalists are apparently 
inclined to look more favorably on a united approach: the 
Communists, because of the steady decline in their electoral 
strength; the Nationalists, because of their continued failure 
to achieve independence by persuasion. If the merger should 
take place, it would probably be guided by the able and intern-
gent Farhat Hached, Secretary General of the Tunisian nation-
alist labor union. 
SPAIN 
Monarchy Rumors Belief that he has failed to get a US loan 
may force Franco in the near future to 
make a decision on a royal successor. Franco's position is 
being threatened by the growing lack of confidence among his 
followers, as a result of the grave economic situation. (During 
recent weeks there has been a notable increase in the number 
of rumors conceLming Franco's intention to relinquish his job 
as chief of state; some of these rumors may have been deliber-
ately planted to test foreign and domestic reaction.) If Franco 
does decide that some move is necessary, he will most proba-
bly establish an interim regency in order to be able to name 
his successor while he is still in a position to dictate the terms.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA 
PALESTINE 
Military Stabilization Military stabilization in Palestine 
appears closer than ever. Israel 
and Lebanon have signed an armistice which provides not 
only for Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese soil but for main-
tenance by each side of only 1,500 troops as defensive forces 
In the border zone, thus allaying Lebanese fears of a new 
Israeli advance. Meanwhile, Israel and Transjordan have 
Initialed a secret agreement providing for Transjordan's 
assumption of responsibility for the Iraqi front in north-
central Palestine, and an armistice between the two govern-
ments may emerge soon. Although the recent coup in Syria 
may delay indefinitely the negotiations between Israel and 
Syria (the last of the Arab states in contact with Israeli 
forces), this delay will not materially affect the over-all 
military situation in Palestine. 
Progress toward military stabilization has focused 
attention on boundaries which will be delineated in a final 
peace settlement. By its recent foray into the Negeb, Israel, 
which had already seized substantial amounts of territory 
over and above the UN partition boundaries, completed its 
control of the lands allocated to it under partition; in its 
agreement with Transjordan, Israel is forcing Abdullah to 
yield additional ground in central Palestine. Under these 
circumstances, it is highly improbable that the Israelis will 
willingly cede enough territory now held by them to permit 
Implementation of the US formula. This formula calls upon 
Israel to make territorial compensation for lands they wish 
to keep outside the original UN partition boundaries.

which the US has an interest. Zaim, who is personally 
friendly toward the West, will probably be able to consoli-
date his control over the Government and by ruling with a 
strong hand may be able to solve many of Syria's internal 
difficulties. Zaim's coming to power, however, will check 
the scheduled Syrian-Israeli armistice talks. There will 
also be delays in the ratification of the agreement for the 
trans-Arabian petroleum pipeline and the French-Syrian 
financial agreement. Moreover, the danger exists that the 
Syrian coup may provoke disturbances in other Arab states, 
particularly Iraq and Egypt. The governments in these two 
countries are not sufficiently stable to insure their surviv-
ing a serious local outbreak. 
TURKEY 
Security Fears Announcement of the North Atlantic Pact 
has stimulated Turkey's desire to clarify 
Its own security position, and,during his forthcoming visit 
to the US as head of the Turkish UN delegation, Foreign 
Minister Sadak will undoubtedly be shopping for additional 
US assurances. The Turks have warmly welcomed the Pact 
Itself, but their exclusion from it has caused them concern 
lest the participating states be strengthened at the eventual 
expense of Turkey. Although Saclak may not press for mem-
bership in the North Atlantic group--even if the formation 
of another regional security agreement is ruled out--he will 
be under great pressure to obtain stronger US assurances 
than those already provided.

FAR EAST 
CHINA 
Peace Prospects Both the Communists and the National 
Government completed their preparations 
during the past week for the "peace conference" scheduled 
to begin in Peiping on 1 April. The Chinese Communist Party 
provided a troublesome overtone to the preparations by announc-
ing that its Central Committee had formally approved Chair!.. 
Mao Tse-tung's "eight demands" as the basis for the peace 
discussions and by notifying the National Government that its 
delegates should bring with them all data necessary for imple-
mentation of these eight points. The "eight points formulated 
by Mao Tse-tung are: (I) abrogation of the Chinese constitu-
tion; (2) relinquishment of the Kuomintang's prerogatives; 
(3) endorsement of Communist '`agrarian reform"; (4) cancella-
tion of "traitorous treaties"; (5) convocation of a political con-
sultative conference to transfer power to a "coalition" govern-
ment; (6) surrender of "war criminals"; (7) confiscation of 
bureaucratic capital; and (8) "reorganization" of Nationalist 
armies. If Li desires,the Government can comply with the 
first five demands; it can comply, in part, with the demands 
for surrender of war criminals and confiscation of bureaucratic 
capital. But Li's Government cannot possibly comply with the 
crucial demand for full surrender of the Nationalist armies, 
because it does not have control over all the remaining Nation-
alist military forces. Therefore, the Communists can either: 
(1) accept partial compliance from Li's Government and later 
move their armies south in the name of the new "coalition" 
government; or (2) force a breakdown in negotiations by in-
sisting upon full compliance with their terms and then resume 
full-scale military operations to the south. In view of their 
lack of trained administrators and their already tremendous 
task of consolidating occupied territories, the Communists may 
accept Li's terms provided they believe that Li has complied with 
Communist demands to the full extent,

JAPAN 
Japanese Resistance The procrastinatory maneuvers of the 
Japanese Government, which enabled 
the Government to shift to SCAP the onus for an unpopular 
budget,reflects a growing Japanese tendency to resist direc-
tion from the occupying authorities. The Yoshida Cabinet 
was committed by campaign promises to economic reforms 
favoring the vested conservative interests who supported the 
Democratic Liberal Party. Prominent among these reforms 
were loosening of economic controls, discontinuance of the 
transaction tax and government assistance for business re-
covery. SCAP is budget "suggestions," however, recommended 
strengthened economic controls and aroused a storm of protest 
among the more conservative leaders of the Democratic Liberal 
Party. By resorting to delaying tactics, the party finally forced 
SCAP to By
the Japanese Government to incorporate eco-
nomic control measures in the new budget. Thus the Demo-
cratic Liberals escaped the embarrassment of being directly 
responsible for advocating an "unpopular" budget. 
INDOCHINA 
Military Drive French military forces in north Indochina 
are apparently being so hard-pressed by a 
concerted Viet Minh drive that they may be forced to evacuate 
the state of Tonkin. The general commanding French forces 
in Tonkin has stated that, without supplies and reinforcements, 
his troops will be "driven into the sea." The resumption of 
extensive military operations along the China-Tonkin frontier 
has probably been timed in part to coincide with Bao Dai's 
expected return in late April, because the reinforcements re-
quired in the north are being held in southern garrisons to 
assure the ex-Emperor a favorable reception there.

SIAM 
Possible Coup Further public disorders or a coup may be 
precipitated in Siam by the general dissatis-
faction with the recently promulgated "royalist" constitution 
and the continuation of repressive measures designed to main-
tain the present Phibul Government in power. In addition, 
tension between the armed services is growing because of 
Premier Phibufs apparent failure to carry out his part of 
an understanding presumably reached with the navy for elimi-
nating General Kach, army "strong man" and deputy com-
mander-in-chief. The c ommander -in-chief of the navy, having 
carried out his part of the agreement, is embarrassed before his 
subordinates, some of whom are reportedly considering support-
ing the followers of former-Premier Pridi in any future attempt 
to overthrow the government. The probability of a forceful 
change in Fovernment has also been increased by the new 
"royalist' constitution, which limits the influence and profit-
eering opportunities of present political and military leaders 
as well as the means of effecting peaceful changes in the gov-
ernment through political maneuvering. 
INDONESIA 
Peace Progress Despite modification of the Dutch position 
toward restoring the Republicans to authority 
at Jogjakarta, there is little indication that the Dutch-are any 
less opposed to granting the Republic a dominant position in the 
projected Indonesian federation. Some progress has been made, 
however, toward the renewal of negotiations between the Dutch 
and the Republicans as a result of conditional Dutch acceptance 
of the invitation by the UN Commission for Indonesia (UNCFP to 
discuss with Republican leaders the restoration of Republica 
authority in jogplmrta. Although the Republic has not yet accepted

the way will be paved for convocation of the Dutch-proposed

again attempt to reach agreement on the transfer of Dutch 
sovereignty to a federated Indonesian government.

WESTERN HEMISPHERE 
Communist Activity In an effort to offset their declining 
power and numerical strength, Com-
munists in Latin America are now concentrating primarily 
on organizational activity. In Mexico, Chile, and Argentina, 
non-militant and ineffective Party members are being purged. 
Party reorganizations are under way in Ecuador and Mexico; 
In the latter country, moreover, Communist organizers are 
attempting to regain influence with labor by urging Party 
members to join local labor unions. Reports that special 
lists of militants are being prepared in Cuba, Argentina, and 
Uruguay suggest planning for underground activities. A Cuban 
Communist-front group for youths is reportedly driving for 
new members. Although these Communist activities may 
Improve the Party's position in a few countries where police 
repression is absent or counter-propaganda ineffective, there 
Is as yet no indication of a reversal in the general trend of 
declining Communist strength. 
ARGENTINA 
US Relations Recent Argentine overtures to the US for 
financial assistance, which have been dictated 
by economic necessity, will afford the US only a limited period 
In which to obtain Argentine concessions. The Peron regime 
Is taking a much firmer stand against Communism and has 
arrested and jailed as Communists many strikers who sought 
wage increases considered inflationary by the government. 
The administration's need for US goodwill, coupled with the 
current government drive against inflation, is already forcing 
a revision in Argentine foreign policy favorable to the US. For 
example, Peron has made some modification in his "third

position" foreign policy which, though ostensibly anti-
Communist and anti-capitalist, has been used principally to 
oppose US influence in Latin America. Peron's apparent 
willingness to make concessions to the US will probably last 
only as long as the new economic policies are successful 
and remain dependent on US aid. If economic stability is 
restored--with or without US aid?Argentine political and 
economic independence will revive, and Argentina can be 
expected to revert to its normal policy of combatting US 
Influence in Latin America. An economic debacle in the 
absence of effective US assistance, however, would intensify 
customary Argentine opposition to the US and make coopera-
tive action difficult even on matters not usually subject to 
rivalry between the two countries.

THE ITALIAN COLONIES QUESTION 
Of the numerous possible solutions open to the UN 
General Assembly on the Italian colonies question (see page 2), 
only those solutions involving Italys participation in the con-
trol of its former colonies have evoked any appreciable con-
troversy. The persistence of Italy's claims for control over 
its former colonies is matched by bitter Arab opposition to 
the re-establishment of Italian colonial rule in any form. 
Because a large measure of agreement has been reached on 
the disposition of Cyrenalca, Eritrea, and Somaliland, the 
major remaining controversy centers on the disposition of 
Tripolitania. 
The Italian Government alleges that its prestige would 
be seriously undermined if it were not awarded at least part 
of its former colonies. Italy banes its claims for trusteeship 
of its pre-Fascist colony of Tripolitania on assertions that 
the area would aid the Italian economy, especially with respect 
to future Italian emigration, If convinced that Italian trustee-
ship is not now or later feasible, the Italian Government, al-
though it would protest non-participation, would probably prefer 
US trusteeship to the establishment by the UN of a multi-power 
administration, particularly one which might include the USSR. 
The advantages of the US as a security force in North Africa 
and the Mediterranean would appeal to the Italians, especially 
as they might expect a friendly US to encourage Italian emigra-
tion to the area and US aid could be expected to contribute ? 
materially to the area's economic development. 
Italian trusteeship over Tripolitania would be unac-
ceptable throughout the Arab world and might cause sporadic 
violence in Tripolitania and neighboring Tunisia. A force 
considerably larger than the present British garrison in 
Tripolitania would be needed to maintain order. Even then, 
occasional outbreaks might occur and spread to Tunisia where 
sympathy is strong for the Tripolitanian desire for independence.

SECRET 
The danger of widespread disorder, however, may be lessened 
by the reported willingness of some Arab leaders in Tripoli-
tania to come to terms with the Italians once Italian trustee-
ship has become a fact. Experienced observers also emphasize 
that in view of Tripolitania's rapidly increasing population rate 
and limited economic resources, it could contribute little to 
the solution of Italy's emigration problem. Even if Italy could 
Implement the ambitious prewar plan to settle about 100,000 
Italians in Tripolitania, the situation would scarcely be alle-
viated in Italy,where there are 2,000,000 unemployed and an 
annual population increase of 400,000. Moreover, the expense 
of the large military force needed to maintain order in the 
area would reduce the Italian capability to develop the area's 
economy. 
Of the other solutions most likely to be considered 
by the General Assembly, Tripolitanian Arabs generally would 
prefer US trusteeship as guaranteeing the best opportunity 
for early independence and economic development. A five - 
power trusteeship, with Egyptian participation, would be less 
distasteful than Italian trusteeship, but would still be opposed 
by: (1) the Tripolilanians, who resent French and Italian 
colonial policy and believe five-power administration would 
be cumbersome; and (2) the Cyrenaicans, who fear that Egyptian 
participation would aid Egypt to press its territorial claims in 
Cyrenaica.
