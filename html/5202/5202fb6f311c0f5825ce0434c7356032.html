 Japan:
 Evolving Middle East Policy
 Reassessment of its Middle East policy is in line with
 Tokyo's growing recognition that it must play a role in
 the world commensurate with its economic strength.
 The bilateral and almost exclusively economic orien-
 tation of Japanese diplomacy in the region ended with
 the Iran hostage crisis and the invasion of Afghani-
 stan. Since then Japanese officials have shown an
 increasing interest in the Middle East peace process,
 and the visits of Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Ali
 and PLO leader Arafat were but the first in a round
 of high-level exchanges that will include a Middle
 East swing by Prime Minister Suzuki sometime next
 year. Japan will consider US views carefully when
 making policy choices, but will not automatically echo
 Washington
 Trade Ties
 Japan in the immediate aftermath of the 1973 oil
 crisis made hasty attempts to protect its energy
 lifeline. Policy throughout the 1970s continued to
 focus on two goals-safeguarding the energy supply
 and building trade with the Middle East in order to
 pay for oil. By following a cautious but steady pro-
 Arab course, the Japanese were able to secure their oil
 imports. Over 70 percent of their oil comes from the
 Middle East; Saudi Arabia supplies the bulk.
 The need to pay the oil bill, combined with the
 lucrative Middle East market, brought expansion in
 both the volume and value of Japanese exports to the
 region during the 1970s. Exports averaged an annual
 increase of about 40 percent from 1973 to 1979.
 Shipments to the Middle East jumped 40 percent in
 1980 despite sanctions against Iran, and Japan in-
 creased its share of OECD exports to the region from
 16 to 18 percent. Japan is now in a position to
 challenge the United States as the top exporter to the
 region. The lion's share of Japan's export trade has
 been with the OPEC members, Saudi Arabia in
 particular. Exports have been concentrated in the

 steel, motor vehicles, and plant exports accounting for

 Building Interdependence
 By the late 1970s, Tokyo sought to lock oil-producing
 Arab countries into a relationship that would influ-
 ence them to remain on good terms with Japan. To
 that end, Tokyo was committed to creating a depend-
 ency both on Japanese exports and on Japanese
 involvement in development projects. F__~    25X1

 In Saudi Arabia, for example, Japanese consortiums
 are involved in the construction of two major petro-
 chemical plants and Japanese firms will sell half the
 final product. Such joint ventures are not without risk,
 however, as demonstrated by the Bandar-Khomeini
 petrochemical complex in Iran. Rising costs, construc-
 tion delays, and the Iran-Iraq war are pushing the
 Mitsui group to withdraw from the project and file an
 $870 million claim against Japan's export insurance
 fund. Payment of the claim would make projects in
 Iran ineligible for future insurance coverage and, as a
 result, other Japanese firms would curtail dealings
 there.
 Aid and Comprehensive Security
 In 1980, Tokyo began to move cautiously into the
 political sphere by allocating aid to areas "bordering
 on conflict" to help maintain their stability. The
 Suzuki government sees this "comprehensive security
 policy" as its contribution to international security. In
 strategically located Oman, for example, Japanese
 economic aid is disproportionate to Japan's minimal
 economic ties and Oman's limited development poten-

 Egypt is another case in point. In the mid-1970s, the
 Foreign Ministry recognized Egypt's importance in
 the Middle East equation and was sympathetic to the
 US call for additional aid. Finance Ministry officials,
 however, continued to argue for channeling assistance
 to countries where Tokyo could expect a direct eco-
 nomic return. Now, Egypt ranks behind only ASEAN
 and China as a recipient of total Japanese official
 development assistance.
 ? Tokyo continues to support moderate Arab states
 such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
 and Jordan.
 ? Japan fully supports the Camp David Accords and
 has said that efforts to secure peace in the Middle
 East should continue to be based on that agreement.
 Nonetheless, the government will not limit its initia-
 tives to policies sanctioned by Washington. While it
 backs the Camp David peace process, Tokyo believes
 that the PLO must be involved if any Middle East
 Tokyo's preliminary decision last month to increase
 aid to Egypt, Oman, Sudan, and North Yemen
 reflected its concern for stability in the region follow-
 ing Sadat's assassination. The level of aid will be
 worked out in budget negotiations between the Minis-
 tries of Finance and Foreign Affairs.
 A Trend Toward Independence?
 As Tokyo moves further from the economic sphere in
 formulating its Middle East policy, it will often
 choose positions that coincide with those of the United
 States:
 ? Japan perceives a Soviet threat to regional security
 and oil supplies.
 peace negotiations are to succeed.
 This view was reflected in the decision to permit PLO
 leader Arafat's recent visit to Japan. Tokyo used the
 visit to encourage the PLO's current trend toward
 moderation and to urge Arafat to recognize Israel's
 right to exist. The Japanese also clearly hoped to win
 points with the Arab oil producers, who have prodded
 Tokyo to recognize the PLO and have long criticized
 what they describe as Japan's subservience to the
 United States. The Japanese are worried that the US
 attitude toward the PLO will drive it, and perhaps

 many of the Arab states as well, into the Soviet camp.
 Tokyo has also expressed growing concern about
 possible Soviet intervention in the area, particularly in
 Iran.
 Tokyo probably hopes to serve as a bridge between the
 PLO and the United States and perhaps even between
 the PLO and Israel. The Japanese have shown some
 interest in the Saudi eight-point peace proposal and
 have welcomed US statements that recognized some
 value in the plan. In an effort to maintain a balance in
 its regional policy, Japan may make some gestures
 toward Israel but will always tune relations with
 Israel with an ear to Arab reaction.
 Tokyo is moving to establish clear Japanese positions
 on foreign policy issues. Officials are increasingly
 conscious of Japan's economic power and frequently
 question the wisdom of US policies. Reflecting this,
 the Japanese Foreign Ministry white paper for this
 year emphasizes that Japan will not be content simply
 to follow US or Western initiatives
 The next step will be increased contacts with Middle
 East leaders. Saudi Crown Prince Fahd probably will
 visit Japan early next year. At that time, Tokyo will
 likely hold discussions on the Saudi peace plan. Prime
 Minister Suzuki wants to visit the region in 1982 and
 probably will go prepared with a solid acka a of
 economic and technical assistance.

 Japan:
 Aiding Depressed Industries
 The Japanese Government is considering measures
 that would violate the spirit if not the letter of its
 pledge at the Ottawa summit not to subsidize struc-
 turally depressed industries. Some of the policies
 being debated would contradict Japan's oft-professed
 support for free trade. Attempts to shelter the alumi-
 num, chemical fertilizer, pulp and paper, and petro-
 chemical industries from import competition could
 easily spark an international outcry, particularly dur-
 ing a period when Japan's trade surplus is headed
 toward record levels. There is a consensus within the
 government that some aid should be given, but sub-
 stantial disagreement exists on the international im-
 plications, revenue effects, and legality of the various
 proposals. The attitude of the United States could
 have a major influence on the outcome of the debate.
 Most of the decisions must be made before the budget
 is announced in late December.
 Impact of High Energy Prices
 The problems of the four troubled industries date
 back to the Arab oil embargo of 1973. Unlike other
 Japanese industries that overcame 1973 setbacks,
 these have never fully recovered because of their
 dependence on petroleum-based feedstocks or electric-
 ity from oil-fired thermal generating plants.
 Government and industry officials debating the future
 of the depressed industries recognize that production
 processes-particularly those requiring large inputs of
 energy and raw materials-would be done better
 elsewhere and that Japan's imports of aluminum,
 fertilizers, basic petrochemicals, and paper must in-
 crease. Japan would prefer to import under long-term
 contracts or from projects in which Japanese firms are
 involved. Many officials, nevertheless, argue that
 Japan should maintain some capacity to produce basic
 materials at home to ensure stable supplies at reason-
 able prices and the technological base they believe is
 essential to support development projects overseas.
 Another compelling, but seldom stated, reason for
 maintaining large domestic industries is the need to
 pay off the substantial debts of the companies in-
 volved.
 The Aluminum Smelting Industry
 Aluminum smelters are the principal industry seeking
 special relief. The aid it gets from the Japanese
 Government is apt to set a pattern for the other
 depressed industries. The industry's problems have
 been under discussion for several months within the
 Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
 and the Aluminum Committee of the Industrial
 Structure Council, an advisory board to MITI com-
 posed of academics, bankers, journalists, and busi-
 nessmen.
 The aluminum industry is clearly in trouble. Alumi-
 num prices have been declining since early 1980, and
 domestic production has fallen sharply since July
 1980. Inventories have soared from less than a
 month's output in mid-1980 to a record five-and-a-
 half times monthly output in September 1981. Indus-
 try losses now surpass $400 million and total debt
 exceeds $4 billion.
 These losses stem from higher oil prices, stagnant
 demand, and import competition. The cost of electric-
 ity has doubled since the Iranian crisis and now
 comprises over 40 percent of the industry's cost of
 production. Weak demand and lower cost imports
 have prevented smelters from passing along the full
 increase in electricity costs. The Japanese complain
 persistently about spot market purchases of US ingot
 and claim that the imported price is $1,600 per metric
 ton (c.i.f), well under the domestic price of $2,000 to
 $2,200.

 Impact of Proposed Countermeasures
 MITI, the Aluminum Committee, industry associ-
 ations, and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) have
 proposed to aid aluminum smelters through:
 ? Reduction of smelting capacity.
 ? Revision of the tariff on imports of aluminum ingot.
 ? An import surcharge with the proceeds distributed
 to domestic producers to assist in financing the
 rehabilitation of the industry.
 ? A prenotification system for imports to help MITI
 monitor the market.
 ? Reduction of electricity costs through indirect subsi-
 dies]
 The Aluminum Committee, reflecting views within
 MITI, recommends a permanent reduction in annual
 capacity from the present 1.1 million tons to 700,000
 tons. The committee forecasts that demand will rise
 5 percent annually to reach 2.16 million tons in FY
 1985, with annual imports of about 1.5 million tons.
 The source of these imports would be:
 ? 700,000 tons from facilities developed with the
 participation of Japanese producers.
 ? 500,000 tons under long-term contracts with foreign
 producers.
 ? A maximum of 300,000 tons from spot market
 purchases.
 Long-term supply contracts would reduce US access
 to the Japanese market. The maximum 300,000-ton
 share allocated to spot market purchases would hold
 US exports to current levels. US producers are reluc-
 tant to make long-term commitments and have only
 recently turned to spot market foreign sales to keep
 production up during periods of slack domestic de-
 mand. At least one US multinational producer bene-
 fits from the emphasis on long-term contracts by
 shipping to Japan from third countries, but other US
 companies not already in the long-term game may be
 shut out.
 In addition, the Ministry of Finance plans to raise the
 current 9-percent duty on aluminum ingot to 13 or 14
 percent. This increase, although not eliminating the
 cost advantage of US smelters, could reduce the gap
 enough to make Japanese buyers reluctant to abandon
 their traditional suppliers. MITI, on the other hand,
 advocates a tariff-quota system that would eliminate
 existing duties for the 600,000 tons of ingot that
 would be imported annually from overseas projects
 involving Japanese firms during the next three fiscal
 years. Buyers of imported ingot would be obliged to
 purchase a still-undetermined quantity of domestical-
 ly smelted aluminum. Elimination of the tariff is
 designed to win the support of ingot users, but the
 Finance Ministry protests that the $385 million dollar
 revenue loss under the tariff-quota scheme is too large
 in an era of tight budgets.
 Another aspect of the MITI plan would circumvent
 the pledge Prime Minister Suzuki made at the
 Ottawa summit not to subsidize depressed industries.
 This proposal would have a private trade association
 collect a 6-percent surcharge on the 600,000 tons of
 duty-free aluminum. The association would then fun-
 nel the money to domestic smelters.
 All parties agree that the aluminum industry's elec-
 tricity bills must be reduced. MITI's Basic Industries
 Bureau would have all industrial electric power cus-
 tomers pay a small subsidy to aluminum refiners. The
 average cost of electricity produced in oil-fired ther-
 mal power plants wholly or jointly owned by smelters,
 which together account for 80 percent of the alumi-
 num industry's consumption, is slightly higher than
 that purchased from electric power companies. Smelt-
 ers could lower their costs by selling their generation
 facilities to the electric companies and then purchas-
 ing electricity at the same rate as other industrial
 consumers. Other MITI officials would cut costs by
 converting power plants from oil to coal, but this
 approach requires time and perhaps low-interest gov-
 ernment loans as well. MOF would rather reduce the
 tax on imported fuel oil used to generate electricity
 for aluminum smelters.
 Chemical Fertilizers
 Chemical fertilizer producers suffer from the same
 basic problems as the aluminum industry, and MITI
 would like to solve them using roughly the same plan.
 The industry has been hard hit by rising oil prices
 because it is dependent on naptha as a feedstock in the
 production of ammonia. In the case of ammonium
 phosphate, the commodity of greatest concern to
 MITI, there is no tariff. A 10-percent duty would be
 imposed on imports exceeding a still-undetermined
 level. Almost all of Japan's $55 million in ammonium
 phosphate imports during 1980 came from the United
 _ 25X1

 Secret
 States. The purchasers of ammonium phosphate
 exempted from the new tariff would then be obliged
 to buy specified quantities of domestically produced
 fertilizer or pay a surcharge to an industry association
 that would funnel the money to domestic producers.
 The tariff would not eliminate the price advantage of
 imported fertilizer, but it would narrow the gap
 sufficiently for the domestic industry to retain most of
 its customers. As in the case of aluminum, the tariff
 quota would shift the burden of adjustment from
 domestic to US producers
 Over the long term, MITI acknowledges that ammo-
 nia producers must switch from naptha to non-
 petroleum-based feedstocks such as coke oven gas or
 coal. Two Japanese companies have already worked
 out plans for the changeover; MITI would like to
 encourage the process by arranging government-
 backed low-interest loans. Subsidies for the chemical
 fertilizer industry, whether in the form of low-interest
 loans or a surcharge on imports, would enable Japa-
 nese companies to sustain higher levels of capacity
 and production and would reduce the opportunity for
 US firms to export to Japan
 Pulp and Paper
 Although the high price of energy adds to the pulp
 and paper industry's difficulties, its primary problem
 is excess capacity. To curtail output and price cutting,
 the government has approved the formation of tempo-
 rary (three-to-six-month) cartels by producers of high-
 grade printing paper, coated paper, and low-grade
 kraft paper. In addition, MITI is contemplating a
 tariff-quota system to protect the entire industry. The
 ministry is also planning to use administrative guid-
 ance to halt construction of new production facilities
 for the next two years.
 Limitations on capacity could open new opportunities
 for US exports if Japanese demand for paper in-
 creases. In practice, however, a successful freeze
 would probably involve some form of domestic orderly
 marketing agreement among existing producers that
 would impede the access of US exporters. The Japan
 Fair Trade Commission believes such administrative
 guidance may constitute an illegal production cartel,
 and the threat of prosecution for violation of the Anti-
 Monopoly Law could make producers reluctant to
 follow MITI's lead
 Petrochemicals
 As in the chemical fertilizer industry, the problem is
 the cost of naptha, the petrochemical industry's basic
 feedstock. Also, the growth rate of domestic demand
 for petrochemicals has slowed. Moreover, US and
 Canadian producers, who enjoy access to cheaper
 natural gas feedstocks, have mounted an export offen-
 sive in Southeast Asia, the Japanese industry's tradi-
 tional market, and in Japan itself. Although controls
 on the price of natural gas in the United States and
 Canada contribute to the cost differential, Japan's   25X1
 aging, naptha-based petrochemical plants would still
 not be competitive even if controls were eliminated.
 The industry's problems are still under study and little
 is known about how much assistance Tokyo is likely to
 provide. MITI would like to place the industry under
 the Structurally Depressed Industries Law to facili-
 tate mergers. In MITI's view there are too many
 companies engaged in the manufacture of petro-
 chemicals and less competition would yield higher
 profits per company. Without higher profits MITI
 believes the industry will be unable to fund the      25X1
 research and development necessary for its survival.
 The Debate Goes On
 Although the government agrees that some aid must
 be offered, the ministries are still squabbling over the
 desirability of specific proposals and who should bear
 the costs:
 ? MOF is concerned about the potential loss of tariff
 revenue under the MITI plans and wants to raise
 tariffs instead.
 ? MITI believes that the MOF's tariff hike will not
 provide enough protection.
 ? MITI would reduce competition in some industries
 to strengthen corporate finances.
 ? The FTC believes the Anti-Monopoly Law must be
 enforced.
 Even within MITI there is substantial disagreement.
 The International Trade Bureau is worried that new
 trade barriers would precipitate protectionist actions
 by the United States and the EC
 For the government, however, the time of decision is
 quickly approaching. The FY 1982 budget, which
 begins on 1 April, is in the final drafting stage, and

 issues such as tariffs and low-interest loans must be
 worked out before it is submitted to the Cabinet in
 late December. MITI is trying to overcome MOF
 objections to a tariff-quota system for aluminum by
 securing US "understanding" of how the system
 works. In Washington, the Japanese are likely to
 emphasize formal tariff "cuts" but say little about
 informal surcharges or obligations to purchase domes-
 tic product. They may also neglect to mention that
 adoption of a tariff quota for aluminum will spur
 other depressed industries to demand similar treat-
 ment. A clear-cut US objection to tariff quotas or
 other like proposals would strengthen the hand of
 opponents in Japan. MITI, MOF, and the other actors
 will probably continue to jockey for position during
 November and early December. Final decisions are
 not likely until after the trade consultations with the
 United States on 7-9 December                                                                                 25X1

 The Philippines:
 Politics of Economic Reform
 A faltering economy is forcing President Marcos to
 institute reforms that could result in a major realign-
 ment of economic groups and alter the political
 balance in the early 1980s. Economic interests fa-
 vored by Marcos stand to lose as a result of foreign
 trade and financial reforms required to ensure con-
 tinuing credits from the World Bank, the IMF, and
 private foreign bankers. Influential industrial oli-
 garchs may seek to shift political loyalties rather than
 adapt to the new rules that reform could produce.
 Marcos, however, cannot defer the scheduled reforms
 without risking worse economic problems in the years
 ahead.
 The Setting
 Only the reconstruction after World War II and the
 foreign exchange crisis of 1969-70 forced radical
 economic policy changes. In between these crises, the
 elite used its political ties to protect vested economic
 empires.
 Recent economic performance could produce a third
 major shift in the domestic political balance. Public
 and private expansion of the foreign debt, which has
 fueled the 6-percent annual growth since 1970, is now
 producing financial strains. At the same time, the
 worldwide economic slowdown and a domestic liquid-
 ity crisis are beginning to touch interests close to
 Marcos. Early in 1981, a dozen large manufacturing
 firms, including several conglomerates run by
 Marcos's close allies, faced cash shortages because of
 slow sales and rising foreign debt service payments.
 Pressed to provide financial assistance in the form of
 loans, equity capital, and restructuring of short term
 obligations, Philippine banking authorities have been
 charged with overseeing both reform of the financial
 system and the management of the troubled corpora-
 tions. Manila is also reforming economic policies that
 support a lagging manufacturing sector in return for
 World Bank and IMF balance-of-payments financing
 (see table).                             25X1
 The reforms of trade and financial policies that have
 been pledged are producing economic dislocation and
 criticism of the government. Labor relations remain
 unsettled after a series of strikes last summer and a
 rise in unemployment to 9 percent, about double the
 rate a year ago. In the face of a worsening trade
 deficit and growing layoffs in several major industries,
 several prominent businessmen have urged that tariff 25X1

 reductions be postponed and have pressed the Central
 Marcos, Inc.
 Marcos's political allies tend to owe their financial
 success to palace influence, not business acumen.
 They control major sectors of the economy, benefiting
 from special legislation or selective enforcement of   25X1
 government regulations. Major government projects
 are contracted out to Marcos's associates, who also
 act as middlemen for businesses without direct con-
 tacts in the palace.
 Tariff reform and an end to import licensing will press
 Marcos's allies by exposing their interests to more
 efficient-and previously excluded-foreign competi-
 tion. Some associates could lose large sums from a
 policy of flexible exchange rates, which would boost
 the peso value of scheduled foreign debt repayments.
 The Marcos family itself, one of the richest in Asia,
 faces potentially large financial losses from its indus-
 trial holdings because of reforms pledged to the
 World Bank and the IMF.
 The Technocrats
 Manila's largely US-trained staff of economic techno-
 crats is to arrange the details of the reform program
 and to design and implement all economic policy. Its
 power derives solely from the backing Marcos gives it.

 technocrats to reassure nervous foreign investors and
 creditors about the economy's capacity to repay for-
 eign debt and maintain a predictable investment
 Cesar Virata, ex-Governor of the World Bank and
 Finance Minister since 1970, was named Prime Min-
 ister last July explicitly to meet Marcos's need to
 present an image of economic responsibility. Another
 respected economist, Central Bank Governor Jaime
 Laya, is overseeing reform of the Securities and
 Exchange Commission and is to handle the sensitive
 task of restructuring the empires of Marcos's associ-
 ates. The technocrats, who are in direct conflict with
 politically well-connected interests, recently lost a
 battle to suspend a politically sensitive levy on domes-
 tic coconut sales and exports.
 The Spectators
 Other domestic interest groups exert marginal influ-
 ence on economic decision making or perceive little
 stake in the reform package. The old oligarchy-a
 politico-economic elite of about 400 families tracing
 its roots to Spanish colonial days-has been neutral-
 ized through expropriation, intimidation, and, more
 often, cooption. Those with palace connections behave
 much like Marcos's cronies and probably oppose
 change. Others, although resentful of the favoritism
 shown Marcos's associates, appear content to protect
 their holdings through their extensive foreign business
 connections
 The million ethnic Chinese, who are well established
 in textiles and banking, have varied views on reform.
 Several Chinese firms recently benefited from rights
 conferred by Marcos making them marketing houses
 for Philippine exports. Textile firms will benefit from
 reform through access to loans for modernizing manu-
 facturing facilities but will face a profit squeeze from
 tariff reductions and the ending of foreign exchange
 controls. Financial reform also will open Chinese
 financial operations to greater scrutiny by Philippine
 banking authoritie
 Both the military and the work force of 18 million
 people are passive bystanders for the moment. The
 military has prospered under Marcos and should
 continue to do well even in a reformed, export-
 oriented economy. Although the work force will bene-
 fit when a postreform economy eases the job market
 and reverses recent declines in real wages, it will
 suffer short run dislocation from unemployment pro-   25X1
 duced by tariff reductions and a more flexible ex-
 change rate policy.
 The Foreigners
 Foreign firms and financial institutions-mainly in-
 ternational financial institutions, private commercial
 banks, and largely US industrial corporations-are
 the only economic power center beyond Marcos's
 control. Their influence grew as the two large OPEC
 price hikes necessitated growing borrowing to cover
 external payments. The Philippines' total foreign debt
 reached $15.4 billion by September 1981. Under the
 best of circumstances, annual repayment obligations
 could easily triple to $4.5 billion by 1985.
 25X1
 25X1
 The World Bank and the IMF require reforms aimed
 at the root of the payment imbalance-the home
 goods sector of domestic manufacturing, which in-
 cludes industries such as cement, steel processing,
 food processing, pulp and paper, and textiles. A $200
 million World Bank credit in 1980 for industrial
 restructuring calls for lower tariffs, an end to import
 licensing, and realignment of the domestic tax system
 to make the home goods sector internationally com-
 petitive. A recent $472 million, 22-month credit from
 the IMF's Supplementary Financing Facility requires
 a flexible exchange rate policy and reform of the     25X1
 financial system, tight money policies, and continued
 limits on commercial foreign borrowing pledged to
 secure earlier credits.
 Foreign commercial banks, mostly US, have been
 covering about half the economy's annual foreign
 exchange gap without formally insisting that Manila
 adhere to reform conditions. By the end of this year,
 US banks will be holding nearly $2 billion in medium-
 and long-term claims on Philippine borrowers and will
 be providing most of the economy's short-term financ-
 ing. Manila's dependence on these credits, coupled
 with the bankers' aversion to any sign of financial
 abuse, has served as another check on Philippine
 economic policy making. Private banks thus serve as
 important informal sponsors of economic reform.F_

 Looking Ahead
 Marcos is well aware of the political costs of the
 reform package. His sensitivity was demonstrated
 earlier this year when he announced that "grace
 periods" would be awarded several industries facing
 new foreign competition because of the reform meas-
 ures. Marcos, nonetheless, has implemented the first
 phases of trade policy reform by reducing the coun-
 try's highest tariffs. In January 1982, he is scheduled
 to implement the elements of tariff reform and foreign
 exchange decontrol that are most politically sensitive.
 25X1
 Marcos cannot avoid further reform whatever his
 political calculations. The economy's current account
 deficit will probably reach a record $2.7 billion this
 year or 6.5 percent of GNP. This level is not sustain-
 able for more than another two or three years if the
 Philippines is to maintain a favorable international
 credit rating. Should Marcos violate IMF and World
 Bank conditions, commercial financial assistance
 would be available only at prohibitive terms.F____1                                                      25X1
 Marcos's most critical task will be to find ways to turn
 the reforms to his advantage. The reforms could
 achieve the stability in the external accounts that
 Marcos wants as a legacy of his economic manage-
 ment. The reforms, however, may force Marcos to
 develop ties to a new and different politico-economic
 elite. If he cannot, by the mid-1980s he may be faced
 with a political and economic climate less congenial to
 his continued tenure or that of his family and friends.

 Briefs
 The leadership hopes Wang, who held a succession of key political and military
 posts in the province until he was purged in the Cultural Revolution, will be able to
 halt continuing unrest in this strategic region. Periodic fighting between national-
 istic minorities and ethnic Chinese, disturbances by rusticated Chinese, grumbling
 in Army units garrisoned there, and reported efforts by the Soviet Union to foster
 discord are troubling Beijing. And Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang also are
 concerned about lingering support in the provincial party committee for ousted
 Party Chairman Hua Guofeng~
 In the past, Wang, a tough, no-nonsense military man, has strongly advocated a
 moderate policy toward minorities-one very similar to that advocated by Hu
 Yaobang today. Still, Wang has not hesitated to take decisive action to maintain
 order among Xinjiang's restless minorities. In a speech at the time of his
 appointment in late October, Wang set out his priorities: maintain order
 strengthen border defenses, and see that central policies are enforced
 China's trade balance for the second quarter of 1981 rebounded sharply from a
 first-quarter deficit of $500 million to a surplus of $1.1 billion. Exports grew
 moderately-about 9 percent-while imports declined 20 percent. Both the
 direction and commodity composition of trade during the first half reflected
 economic readjustment policies favoring light industry and agriculture over heavy
 industry.
 High world prices and anticipated good harvests contributed to declining imports
 of cotton and grains. China relied on cheaper grain markets in Canada and
 Australia, avoiding expensive US sources. Reduced deliveries of manufactured
 goods, particularly machinery from Western Europe and Japan, also contributed
 to lower import costs.
 Chinese exports rose by $480 million to about $5.7 billion during the second
 quarter. All the growth came in non-Communist markets
 During the quarter, China repaid $35 million of the $553 million it drew from the
 IMF under its first credit tranche. China also retired $24 million of $380 million
 in IMF trust fund loans. By the end of June, China also repaid $1.4 billion of its
 record borrowing of $6.5 billion from foreign commercial banks.

 Improved Tank Demonstrates Interim Modernization
 An improved medium battle tank unveiled last month in the Beijing Military
 Region illustrates China's intention to upgrade selected weapon systems even in a
 time of economic austerity
 The improved tank-designated Type 69-appears to have capabilities similar to
 the Soviet T-62, the most advanced Soviet tank currently deployed on China's
 borders. Mounted on the same chassis as China's 1950s-vintage Type 59, the new
 tank is equipped with a larger main gun. It has better capability for firing on the
 move, advanced communications and target sighting equipment, and better night
 vision capabilities. The tank's smoothbore cannon-probably 105 mm--can fire
 conventional high-explosive or advanced armor-piercing ammunitions. The new
 gun probably has greater range and accuracy than those on other Chinese tanks.

 A parade last month near Beijing included 20 jeeps carrying missiles that appear
 identical to the Soviet Sagger AT-3-a manually controlled, wire-guided system
 designed to destroy tanks at distances up to three kilometers. Although the missile
 has been shown in the press and on television since 1979, PLA officials have
 admitted privately that the system is still in testing. The Chinese reportedly are
 having problems in producing the fine filament wire necessary for guidance.
 Deployment of such an antitank guided missile along the Soviet border would at
 least temporarily reduce the 2.6-to-1 Soviet advantage in numbers and effective-
 ness of tanks and antitank weapons. The missile probably is not effective against
 the more heavily armored T-64 and T-72 tanks that the Soviets are expected to de-

 developments in the Lockheed bribery trial that have hurt one of his supporters,
 faction leader Tanaka. Damaging testimony and the conviction of a close friend
 and financial backer have clouded Tanaka's political future
 Pyongyang Still Grappling With the Economy
 The North Koreans have reorganized the State Administration Council-the
 country's Cabinet-in an effort to strengthen centralized control of the economy
 and improve industrial coordination:
 ? Thirteen industrial ministries were merged into four committees in September;
 several other ministries were abolished.
 ? Agricultural and noneconomic ministries were not directly affected.
 ? Some functions of the ministries involved were turned over to the Economic
 Guidance Committees, which were established in each of the nine provinces and
 in four cities to oversee local economic activity.
 ? Chairmen of these provincial committees were given ministerial rank and sit on
 No purge of the bureaucracy accompanied this sweeping reorganization, although
 many high-level officials were reassigned. The changes may eliminate some local
 production bottlenecks, but they will do little to resolve broader economic
 problems and are bound to complicate drafting of the 1982 economic plan.
 Southeast Asia            Australia Beefing Up the Military Budget
 Australia's new military expenditure program is its largest ever. The $4.7 billion
 budget for the fiscal year ending 1 July 1982 represents an increase of 5 percent in
 real terms and will account for 10 percent of Canberra's total budget outlays. The
 defense budget provides for the construction of new military bases, the upgrading
 of existing ones, and new factories to produce military equipment and ammunition.

 Canberra appears determined to rebuild its military, which has been neglected
 since the Vietnam war. It plans to purchase 75 F/A-18 Hornets to replace 90
 aging Mirages as part of a reported $5.75 billion long-range military equipment
 acquisition program. The purchase, to cost $2.9 billion over the 1984-90 delivery
 period, will be the largest single defense equipment acquisition in Australian
 history
 Philippine Foreign Debt Climbing
 Foreign debt rose at an annual rate of 30 percent during the first three quarters of
 1981, reaching $15.4 billion at the end of September. The surge is largely an
 outgrowth of a poor trade performance that will probably push the deficit this year
 to a record $2.6 billion. The interest payment portion of debt service jumped 52
 percent in January-September and consumed nearly $1 billion in foreign ex-
 change, versus $638 million during the same period in 1980.
 Manila nevertheless has had little difficulty securing new foreign credits. The
 Central Bank has lined up a manager for the first loan in its 1982 Consolidated
 Foreign Borrowing Program, which in turn will be lent to private borrowers.
 Malaysia Accelerating Foreign Borrowing
 Arrangement of a $650 million foreign loan in mid-October reflects Kuala
 Lumpur's desire for an aggressive start on its ambitious Fourth Malaysia Plan
 (1981-85). Malaysian policymakers had hoped to tap multilateral agencies for
 financing the first few years of the development plan and to reserve heavy
 commercial borrowing for the plan's last years. This strategy was derailed by weak
 international commodity prices for rubber and tin and a glutted international oil
 market that have weakened the country's balance of payments
 The new loan will cover nearly half this year's estimated $1.5 billion current
 account deficit, thus sparing Kuala Lumpur from having to slow imports of capital
 goods for development programs or adjust the exchange rate. The international
 banking community apparently remains bullish on Malaysia's long-term economic
 prospects. The loan is among the largest secured by an Asian borrower this
 was fully subscribed within a week, and carried very favorable terms.

 Ne Win Steps Aside as President But Not as Policymaker
 San Yu assumed the presidency of Burma on 9 November, but Ne Win's election
 to another four-year term as party chairman at the August party congress ensures
 that the 70-year-old leader will remain the dominant political force. San Yu's role
 as president will be limited. He was dropped at the congress from the party
 Central Executive Committee-the premier decisionmaking body.
 Cooperation in the energy field has increased following agreement earlier this year
 for joint oil exploration and Indonesian liquefied natural gas exports to South
 Korea. Jakarta wants to diversify its LNG exports, which now go entirely to
 Japan, and Seoul stands to gain a more secure supply of energy imports.
 Pertamina (Indonesia's state oil company) and Kodeco (the government-owned
 Korean Development Company) are moving ahead with their joint venture to
 explore for oil offshore East Java. As part of its $60 million commitment on
 exploration during the next six years, Kodeco plans to drill eight exploratory wells
 by 1984 after completing seismic studies next May. South Korea's share of any
 commercial output will supplement the 15,000 b/d of crude oil it currently
 purchases from Indonesia.
 Both sides are proceeding with plans for the start of LNG shipments even though
 financing arrangements have not yet been settled and deliveries are not scheduled
 before 1985. Following President Chun's visit to Indonesia last June, Seoul agreed
 in principle to purchase 1.5 million tons of LNG annually (about 40,000 b/d oil
 equivalent) from the Arun field in North Sumatra and has already selected a site
 for an LNG import terminal.
