632, "Euro e from the Atlantic to the Urals"  
BACKGROUND: The size of sovereign states is circumscribed 
by upper and lower limits, above or below which no state can 
be expected to survive long: they will either collapse because 
of internal weaknesses and tensions 2r be destroyed by exter-
nal enemies. These upper and lower limits of viability have 
repeatedly changed throughout history, depending upon the de. 
volopment of military forces, economic resources, means of 
transport and communications, etc. The empires of Alexander 
the Great, Genghis Khan, Napoleon or Hitler could not last 
because they were too big and too unwieldy for their times. 
At the other end of the scale, the Greek city states could not 
survive Persian invasion, the divided feudal states of Spain 
had to unite before they could throw off Moorish rule and the 
small neighbors of Stalin, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, were 
unable to maintain their independence in World War Two, 
Sovereignty in the Nuclear Age, The lespDns of twoWorld 
Ware,. but partic'ilarly'ETVEUHnning of the nuclear age, par-
alleled by the rapid development of world-W14 masa communi-
cations, jet air travel, and vastly increased eco,gomic and 
cultural interrelations between all nations arid all continents 
have radically raised these minimum and maximum sizes once more. 
Today, most states sovereignty is still a legal-diplomatic 
assumption but no longer a political-military reality; even 
large, populous industrial countries must depend on friends 
and allies to maintain their independence (India's defense 
against Chinese aggression) and cannot act with true freedom 
in the internati'mal field (France's and Britain's withdrawal 
from Suez), 
Recognition of this harsh, but fundamental fact of inter-
national relations in the nuclear age is being impeded and 
delayed by several factors: 
a. the sufferings of World War Two in most of 
Europe and a major part of Asia have provided 
intense new impulses for natinnalist 
motivations, ;pride of national independence 
and hatred against foreign enemies; 
b. former colonial areas, upon reaching 
their independence, mostly developed fierce 
nationalist attitudes (and this involves at 
least one half of all mankind); 
c. the Comm.unists6 though dogmatically

formal national sovereignty (partly, in order 
to ward off "intervention" in what they claim 
to bs their internal affairs--see their opposi-
tion against UN investigation of the Hungarian 
revolution; partly, in order to facilitate 
their "salami tactics" in expanding their empire-
if Yinland, for instance, were more closely 
allied with the rest of Scandinavin, or even 
with all of free Europe, Soviet pressure against 
this little country would be less effective). 
International and Regional Groupings. Despite these for-
midable-nbstacles, considerable progress in world-wide and 
reginnal cooperation between governments and nations has been 
We since 1945. The UNITED NATIONS, with its auxiliary organ, 
4AtinnS (UNESCO, UNICEF, ILO, WHO, World Court, etc.), though 
still requiring much strengthening, has already proven far more 
pffecttve than the old League of Nations. Cooperative enter-
'4,riSeS fnr post-war reconstruction such as the Marshall Plan 
apd the colnmbo Plan, have been highly successful. .The US 
440 21,9rceMe its traditional aversion against "entangling 
allianqes", has joined (military, but partly also political) 
reginn41 defense organizations such as NATO, SEATO and OAS, and 
has participated in the military committee of CENTO. Even the 
CoMPAniPt Bloc developed such regional organizations as the 
W4rPMW Pact (military) and CEMA/COMECON (economic). 
European Integration. The need for close sunra-n_.ti)nal 
P?10t1fn was-5HirfferiThrly keenly felt in Enron-0, twice $31 
2Pth century the battlefield of devastating wars, In 
World War Two, most of continental Europe (except Sweden, 
Swtzerland, Spain, Portugal and Turkey) was swallowed up in 
fUrtl@r'S "Fortress Europe"--which was alsn intended to stretch 
fropt the Atlantic, which it did reach, to the Urals, which it 
Wrnwly missed. After these experiences and confronted with 
the tareat 
of an WcPanding Communist empire, advanced to the 
*lbe River in the heart of Germany, most Europeans recognized, 
044 ,PWressive speed and clarity, the need for close regional 
poollow4Tilp. A chain of organizations, always actively aided

the Soviet Union and the US, is by no means new. It has, how-
ever, gained new momentum and has developed from a somewhat 
abstract concept into a key issue of current European politics 
(11441 the last few months because: 
? 
Europe's prosperity makes her no longer dependent 
on V5 econoETT7Icrbut, on the contrary, has turned 
her into a major competitor on the world markets; 
b. the nuclear stalemate developing between the US

imposed won Moscow's elyansion plans by the set-

Europe's own defense; 
p, De Gaulle's termination of the war in Algeria and 
the popular man 'a e repea e y con erre upon him

hand in building up a French national nuclear f)rc

of th 'Nortfi Atlantic is beyond dispute: but whether it ex,

033. Mani, Takes the Offensive (People's Daily and 
25X1C10btod Viag Statements) 
BACKGROUND: In two major pronouncements, one an editorial 
in People's gaily of 27 February and the other a lengthy 
artiele in fhe 4 March issue of the theoretical journal Red 
Flag, the Chinese Communists have mounted a bold ideological 
offensive promulgating their own fundamentalist brand of 
communism and challenging Moscow's leadership of the 
Communist movement. 
The editorial in Peonle's Daily entitled "Whence the 
Differences?--A Reply to oomrade Thorez and Other Comrades" 
details in uncompromising terms the Chinese version of the 
origin and development of the Sino-Soviet dispute and 
establishes Chinese criteria for a rapprochement. The Rad 
Flag article, entitled "More on the Differences Between 
Comrade Togliatti and Us," running to approximately 63,003 
words, sets the framework of the Sino-Soviet dispute in 
absolute terms as the third great debate in the history of 
the international Communist movement. Both articles use 
proxy targets as an intentionally transparent guise for what 
is in effect a direct attack on Khrushchev and his policies. 
The latest stage in the Sine-Soviet dispute can be 
characterized as the increasingly aggressive attempts of 
both sides to out-maneuver the other, to line up support 
in the world Communist movement and to gain a decisive 
breakthrough. While the tactics employed in this contest 
vary and may result from time to time in a muting or 
exacerbation of public polemics, the stakes remain the 
same: direction of the Communist movement. During the 
satellite and Italian Party congresses which were held 
from October 1952 to January 1963, the Soviet side adopted 
more aggressive tactics accusing the Chinese by name, 
condemning both their theories and their methods and in 
general attempting to make it appear as if the Chinese were 
an isolated heretical minority challenging the entire 
Communist movement. At the East German Party Congress, 
the delegates went so far as to boo and hiss the speech of 
the Chinese representative while giving a rousing cheer for 
the Yugoslav delegate. Since then the Soviets, while 
continuing their criticisms, have steadfastly proclaimed

their readiness to meet hi-laterally with the Chinese in 
preparation for a general meeting of all Parties. In this 
way they attempted to place the Chinese on the defensive and 
to shift to them the onus of splitting Communist unity. 
Meanwhile, it appeared that some more serious form of bi-
lateral negotiations were being prepared. In early February, 
at a diplomatic reception, Khrushchev greeted the Chinese 
Ambassador with a hug and on 23 February Gromyko gave a 
luncheon for him. The same day the Soviet Ambassador in 
Peking was received by Mao, the first time in many years 
that Mao has received a Soviet representative. Both Parties 
publicized these meetings in an effort to stress that the 
intransigence was not on its side. Then, beginning 20 
February, Poking began reprinting on a daily basis a series 
of major Soviet, Italian and French statements relating to 
the Sino-Soviet dispute. The reason Peking decided to make 
public these attacks on the Chinese Party becomes evident 
in the light of the two articles under discussion. 
The first article, "Whence the Differences," is really 
a discussion of the un-Marxist-Leninist manner in which the 
CPSU has managed its relations with the other Communist 
Parties. The recurTent accusation is that the CPSU is 
guilty of "great-nation chauvinism," i.e of putting the 
national interests of the Soviet Union ahead of the interests 
of the international Communist movement: 
"Certain comrades place the resolutions of 
one party 75bviously a reference to the 22nd CPSU 
Program7 arove the Moscow Declaration which is 
the common program for international communism. 
No resolution of any party congress can be taken 
as the common line of the movement or as binding 
on other parties." 
And in this connection, they also accuse the pro-Soviet 
Parties of unworthy servility to the CPSU: 
"Twisting about in this way and following the 
baton so unconditionally cannot be regarded as 
indicative of normal relations of independence and 
equality." 
The document also makes an issue of Yugoslav revisionism 
referring to it as a major question of principle: 
"The question of the Tito clique is not one 
of interpreting the Moscow Declaration but whether 
or not to tear it up....it is a question net of 
helping comrades rectify mistakes but of unmasking 
and denouncing the enemies of Marxism-Leninism."

(633. Cont.) mimalmSmawimiWmn 11 March 1963 
Regarding the 1960 Moscow Declaration the Chinese state: 
"The Chinese Party will never allow the common 
agreement of the fraternal parties to be doctored or 
scrapped, will never allow traitors to be pulled 
into our ranks and will never agree to any trading 
in Marxist-Leninist principles." 
Detailing their conditions for ceasing polemics and agreeing 
to another international meeting, the Chinese demand that 
the Soviets confess their error: 
"...Do you or do you not consider the public 
attacks you have been making on fraternal parties 
were a mistake? Are you or are you not ready to 
admit this mistake and apologize to the parties 
you have attacked? Are you truly and sincerely 
ready to return to the proper course of interparty 
consultation on the basis of equality....not only 
must attacks on the Chinese Party cease, the 
attacks leveled at the Albanian Party and at other 
fraternal parties must also stop. However, it is 
absolutely impermissible to use the pretext of 
stopping polemics in order to forbid the exposure 
and condemnation of Yugoslav revisionists; this 
violates the provision of the Moscow Statement...." 
The Red Flag article returns to the framework of the 
dispute as well as to the substantive points at issue. 
In so doing, it not only explicitly challenges the right 
of the CPSU to interpret Marxism-Leninism for the movement 
but, by implication, indicates that the Chinese comrades, 
as the true inheritors of Marx and Lenin, are in a far 
better position to fulfill this function. Thus, the 
Chinese see the debate in terms of the future direction 
of the international movement and as a struggle between 
the defenders of the purity of Marxism-Leninism and the 
entire working-class movement versus "the revisionist 
trend which is the product of the imperialists." 
"In the last analysis one ideological trend 
is genuine...revolutionary Marxism-Leninism and 
the other is bourgeois ideology...that is anti-
Marxist-Leninist ideology." 
The article goes on to claim that the "modern revisionists" 
hope to abolish Marxism-Leninism at one stroke; liquidate 
the liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples; and save 
the imperialists and reactionaries from their doom.

(633. Cont.) 11041.11 r 11 March 1963 
"Marxist-Leninists have the duty to differentiate 
between right and wrong....The ideas of Togliatti 
and other comrades constitute a most serious challenge 
to the theory of Marxism-Leninism and an attempt to 
overthrow it completely....We will never allow a 
handful of people to keep on with their splitting 
activities." 
Evidently seeking to demonstrate both the importance of the 
stakes and their goal of total victory, Peking characterizes 
differences with the CPSU as the third great debate in the 
Communist movement, emphasizing the result of the first two 
in which Kautsky and Bernstein in the one case and Trotsky 
in the other were all banished to eternal damnation by Lenin 
and Stalin respectively, the representatives of the one and 
only true Marxism. 
Both, documents repeat the Chinese views on the basis of 
the substantive issues at stake in the dispute; however on 
this occasion Peking treats its readers to a detailed Marxist-
Leninist analysis of a number of basic questions. Those 
chosen for particular emphasis are the questions of defining 
the present epoch; the nature of contradictions; war and 
peace; means for seizing power; attitude towards the 
imperialists; and, above all, the question of how inter-
party relations should be conducted. From 1959 on: 
"The leaders of certain CP's went back on the 
joint agreement they had signed and endorsed; and 
made Tito-like statements; did their best to prettify 
US imperialists and turned....their struggle against 
the fraternal parties...." 
Tho "revisionists" are accused of substituting a "bourgeois 
supra-class viewpoint" in place of the Marxist-Leninist view 
of class struggle; of robbing Marxism-Leninism of its 
revolutionary elan; of "substituting bourgeois pragmatism 
for dialectical materialism." Togliatti "and others" are 
said to be guilty of attempting to substitute class 
collaboration for class struggle, "structural reform" for 
proletarian revolution and "joint intervention" for the 
national liberation movement. 
The Chinese documents emphasize the significance of the 
Chinese experience for the peoples' liberation struggles in 
Asia, Africa and Latin America and the need to support these 
struggles. They characterize the condition of these peoples 
thusly: 
"Fifty million people on earth are still 
groaning under colonial rule....although a number

of countries have won their independence in recent 
years, their economies are still under the control 
of foreign monopoly capitalism." 
The articles also make a very interesting distinction 
between the metropolitan CP's of the imperialist countries, 
i.e. the "haves," vs. the "have mots" of the developing areas: 
"The proletarian parties of the metropolitan 
imperialist countries are duty bound to heed the 
voice of the revolutionary peoples in these regions, 
study their experience, respect their revolutionary 
feelings, and support their revolutionary struggles 
....They have no right whatsoever to flaunt their 
seniority before these people, to put on lordly airs, 
to carp and cavil....The present situation is an 
excellent one for the..,oppressed nations and peoples 
in Asia, Africa and Latin America /ro act7..." 
Finally, the Red Flag article also denounces the CPSU 
and its followers T37 concealing the Chinese views from 
other parties: 
"The doughty warriors who claim to possess the 
totality of Marxist-Leninist truth are mortally 
afraid of the articles written in reply to their 
attacks by the so-called dogmatists, sectarians, 
splitters, nationalists, and Trotskyites whom they 
have so vigorously condemned. They dare not publish 
these articles in their own newspapers and journals. 
As cowardly as mice, they are frightened to death, 
they dare not lot the people of their own countries 
read our articles, and they have tried to impose a 
watertight embargo. They are even using powerful 
stations to jam our broadcasts and prevent their 
people from listening to then. Dear friends and 
comrades, who claim to possess the whole truth! 
Since you are quite definite that our articles are 
wrong, why don't you publish all these erroneous 
articles and then refute them point by point so as 
to inculcate hatred among your people against the 
heresies you call dogmatism, sectarianism, and anti-
Marxism-Leninism? Why do you lack the courage to 
do this, why such a stringent embargo? You fear 
the truth. The huge specter you call "dogmatism," 
that is, genuine Marn:ism-Leninism, is haunting the 
world, and it threatens you. You have no faith in 
the people, and the people have no faith in you. 
You are divorced from the masses. That is why you 
fear the truth, and carry your fear to such absurd 
lengths. Friends, comrades! If you are men enough,

step forward! Let each side in the debate pub-
lish all the articles in which it is criticized 
by the other side. And let the people in our own 
countries and the whole world think and judge who 
is right and who is wrong. That is what we are 
doing, and we hope you will follow our example." 
The article concludes with a disingenuous expression of 
the willingness of the Chinese Party to discuss these 
issues with the fraternal and workers' parties of all 
countries; however it notes that the "success of such a 
meeting would depend on the prior overcoming of many 
difficulties and obstacles and on the doing of a great 
deal of preparatory work..." 
Conclusions: The latest Chinese pronouncement amounts 
to consideral5ly more than just a rebuttal of Khrushchev's 
brand of communism; it constitutes in effect an initiative 
vis-a-vis all the various Communist Parties of the world--
and particularly the developing world--aimed at persuading 
them to transfer their allegiance to the true Marxist-Leninists, 
to a Party whose recent conquest of power has taken place in 
conditions similar to theirs, to a Communist Party which - 
promises to actively and aggressively assist them to seize 
power. For, while the Khrushchev, Tito and Togliatti inter-
pretation of Marxism-Leninism may correspond more closely 
to the reality in the advanced industrial societies of 
Europe, Mao's uncomplicated fundamentalism is certain to 
strike responsive cords in the hearts of many a zealous and 
frustrated Communist activist in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America. 
The terms advanced by the Chinese as the sine qua non 
for rapprochement amount to a demand for total capalatara 
by Moscow. In effect, Peking has cast the dispute in the 
following historic equation: Lenin plus Marxism-
Leninism plus the Communist movement vs. the Kautsky/ 
Bernstein revisionist; Stalin plus Marxism-Leninism plus 
the Communist movement vs. Trotsky; and now the Chinese 
Communists plus Marxism-Leninism plus the Communist movement 
vs. "a handful of people who keep on with their splitting 
activities" (i.e. Khrushchev and his followers). Such a 
framework is hardly conducive to reconciliation.

634. New Throats From Marshal Malinovsky  
BACKGROUND: In June 1957, Marshal Zhukov, then Soviet 
Minister of Defense, helped Khrushchev by using military 
transport to bring Khrushchev's Central Committee supporters 
to Moscow, thus enabling Khrushchev to defeat the "anti-
party group.'! But perhaps because he feared Zhukov's power, 
perhaps because he resented Zhukov's efforts to reduce the 
amount of time spent on indoctrinating the forces, or perhaps 
because Zhukov favored a more cautious policy in the then-
acute Syrian-Lebanese problem, Khrushchev sent Zhukov on a 
trip to Albania, and then removed him from office (October 
1957). Marshal Rodion Yakovlevich Malinovsky promptly 
denounced Zhukov as a "fresh-baked Bonaparte", and sooll 
thereafter was rewarded with Zhukov's old position. 
Malinovsky is one of the few surviving specimens of a 
type of general once found in many armies, the hard-drinking, 
bushy-browed, glorified top sergeant. Weighing some 303 
pounds, and with a nose which has been compared to a potato, 
he is now 65 years old, and has perceptibly aged in recent 
years; it has been reported that he is diabetic. In some 
ways, he is a military counterpart to N.B. Khrushchev himself. 
Like Khrushchev, Malinovsky was able to advance in rank 
largely due to Stalin's purges, and like most other senior 
generals in the Red Army, he held a command in the Stalingrad 
campaign. Later his Army Group captured Bucharest, Budapest, 
and Vienna, and after Hiroshima he conducted the "one week 
war" in Manchuria against the Japanese. His great virtue in 
World War II was that, like Marshal Joffre in World War I, 
nothing made him panic. In Malinovsky's frequent appearances 
on the speaking platform, he has the alarming aspect of an 
aging Mars, though somewhat gone to seed. 
After becoming Minister, Malinovsky quietly accepted 
greater Party participation in military affairs, and 
Khrushchev's temporary cut in troop strength. But Khrushchev 
has regularly used Malinovsky's gruff exterior whenever a 
little saber-rattling seemed to be called for. On 14 January 
1960, Malinovsky said that one Soviet rockot--and he implied 
that there were hundreds--could oqual all the devastation 
caused by Anglo-American bombing in Europe in World War II. 
When Khrushchev went to Paris for the abortive summit meeting 
in May 1960, following the U-2 incident, Malinovsky accompanied 
Khrushchev everywhere, even into private meetings with 
de Gaulle and Macmilian. (Khrushchev, on the other hand,

emMMVPIPPW4Pn 11 March 1963 
accompanied Malinovsky on a visit to Pleurs, S.E. of Paris, 
where Malinovsky had been billeted while serving with Russian 
forces in France during World War I.) It is now clear that 
the Soviet war lord was brought along for his intimidation 
value, and did not come (as some observers thought at the 
time) to watch Khrushchev on behalf of the military. 
Malinovsky declared on 30 May 1963 that Soviet rocket forces 
had been ordered to shoot down any intruding aircraft. 
During the height of the 1961 Berlin crisis, on 14 September 
1961, Malinovsky's name appeared under an article in Pravda, 
hinting that world war, while not fatally inevitable, would 
be a logical outcome to the class struggle. At the 22nd 
CPSU Congress in October 1961, the Marshal claimed that "the 
problem of destroying rockets in flight has boon successfully 
solved" by the USSR; he also predicted that in the event of 
general war, "whole countries will be turned into lifeless 
deserts covered with ashes! , On 16 October 1962, at an army 
ideological conference, Malinovsky stated that the Soviet 
forces had recently taken a major step, which had "further 
increased the military superiority of the socialist camp 
over the aggressive bloc of imperialist countries"; his 
listeners probably thought he meant some kind of bomb or 
rocket, but in retrospect, it seems likely that he was 
roferring to the Soviet buildup in Cuba. On 25 October, at 
the height of the Cuban crisis, this speech was reprinted in 
Red Star, the newspaper of the Soviet forces. 
The outcome of the Cuban affair indicated that Soviet 
anti-missile missiles had not really become operational, and 
that Soviet forces did not have the crushing superiority 
claimed by Malinovsky. Significantly, he spoke much less 
ominously on 7 November, and his order of the day for 
17 November even omitted all threats and stressed peaceful 
coexistence. But this mildness was not to last. With 
frictions arising in NATO, the Soviets began again to utter 
new threats, designed to intimidate the western nations, to 
reassure Castro, and perhaps to appease the Chinese Communists. 
At an Army Day meeting on 22 February, attended by Khrushchov 
in his Lieutenant General's uniform, Malinovsky warned that 
in case of war, the Soviets might use a 100 megaton "fireball" 
bomb on the United States. He asserted that the USSR had 
"several times" more missiles than the US, and added 
ominously: "We do not know of facts which would indicate a 
departure by the imperialist circles of the US from the 
policy of war';" The circling of Soviet ships by American 
submarines might, he said, "prove extremely dangerous." 
(Naturally he said nothing of similar action by Soviet ships 
and planes; one such Soviet action was disclosed by Secretary 
McNamara on 23 February 1963.) Malinovsky climaxed his 
threats by saying, 'we would like to warn the aggressive

11 March 1963 
circles of the United States that an attack on the Cuban 
Republic would mean a third world war. The Soviet Union 
will be in the first ranks of those who will come to Cuba's 
assistance." Malinovsky's latest statements did not unduly 
concern American leaders; Secretary Rusk said the speech was 
"just what you'd expect on the 45th anniversary of the Soviet 
Armed Forces,' But it discouraged those who had Loped that, 
after the Cuban crisis, international relations might be 
spared this kind of static. 
While Malinovsky's statements are doubtless approved 
by Khrushchev, there have recently been signs of potential 
trouble between the two men. Marshal Yeremenko, a wartime 
commander in what has now been renamed the "battle of the 
Volga" (see Guidance #546, 33 July 1962), has claimed in a 
book and an article (Pravda, 27 January) that he and 
Khrushchev first conceived of counter-offensive strategy 
at Stalingrad, took the initiative in planning a counter-
attack, and finally obtained the approval of a passive and 
unimaginative General Headquarters. Yeremenko heavily 
stresses the active role taken by Khrushchev and suggests that 
Khrushchev and he were close collaborators. Although Malinovsky 
was also on the Stalingrad front--and indeed probably owes 
his present position to his acquaintance with Khrushchev 
then--he also has an interest in asserting the leadership 
of the top command echelons. Malinovsky therefore replied 
to Yeremenko in a Pravda article of 2 February, sharply 
emphasizing the piTHEiTrcle of GHQ in conceiving and 
planning the counter-attack. Malinovsky (or his staff 
writer) suggests that Khrushchev's leadership in the battle 
was political, not military. Even more strikingly, 
Malinovsky praises Zhukov's role in the planning, mentioning 
him four times, three times as "Comrade." Zhukov has not 
received such favorable public mention since his downfall 
In 1957. While Malinovsky in no way praises Stalin or 
criticizes Khrushchev, his more accurate and loss sycophantic 
description is unlikely to endear him to Khrushchev, and the 
favorable mention of Zhukov suggests that the question of 
priority between professional-military and ideological 
considerations is not yet finally resolved. In a contest, 
Khrushchev would almost certainly get his way. But as with 
biology, philosophy, and agriculture, the political 
distortion of professional military thought, including 
military history, hampers effective performance; in this 
case it also weakens discipline.

635 NE, EE, g. The Kurdish Minority in Iraq 
25X1 C1 Ob 
BACKGROUND: The Kurdish people consist of largely 
nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes living in five countries: 
Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria (a few hundred thousand), and 
the USSR (less than one hundred thousand). They are known 
to have existed at least since 2,000 B.C. and some of the 
more ancient Kurdish tribes still exist--for example, the 
Baba (the Babans are one of the oldest tribes) in the new 
revolutionary government of Iraq. There are perhaps as 
many as 3 million in Turkey and possibly one and a half 
million each in Iraq and Iran; since there has never been an 
adequate census (the Turks, for instance, do not recognize 
that there is such a being as a Kurd; they call him a 
"mountain Turk") any figures given are most unreliable. 
Some of the Kurdish tribes, nevertheless, probably constitute 
the oldest still-extant aristocracy on earth. They have 
boon fighting to attain independence (and some of the 
tribes occasionally have succeeded for a while) virtually 
throughout their long history--through the empires, for 
example, of the Sumerians, the Hittites, Assyrians, Modes, 
Persians, Armenians, Turcomans, Ottoman Turks, Iranians 
and Iraqis. In sum, there aro about 5-13 million Lurds 
today; all of them, without exception, are part of a 
minority in the five countries where they reside; practically 
all of them still desire autonomy and independence, although 
some of them dare not publicly voice such a desire. In the 
twentieth century, they have even occasionally fought for 
it--e.g., in Turkey, Iran and Iraq. 
In the years 1925, 1930 and 1933, Kurdish uprisings in 
Turkey were put down with brutal repression on Ataturk's 
orders, whereupon many were taken from their natural habitat 
in eastern Turkey and re-located in scattered parts of the 
new republic. Similarly, Kurdish uprisings in Iran and Iraq 
after World War I were severely put down by the Shah's forces 
or those of the Hashemite dynasty in Iraq. A new power came 
into the picture after World War II, however: the Soviet 
state. In the northern portion of Iran which the Soviets 
had occupied during the war, the Soviets helped set up a 
de facto autonomous Kurdish Republic with its capital in

Mahabad and proceeded to exploit the Kurdish urge for 
independence, as they were doing simultaneously with the 
Iranian Azerbaijanis, a Turkic people. But, in accordance 
with their Tripartite Agreement, the UK and US forces had 
been withdrawn from Iran; through the UN, the USSR was 
pressured to do likewise and finally withdrew in May 1946. 
Iranian forces then marched upon the Kurdish Republic, 
subdued it and imprisoned or executed many of its leaders. 
One of these, who managed to elude the Iranian forces and 
escape into the USSR, was Mollah Mustafa Barzani, chief 
of the puissant Iraqi tribe of Barzani Kurds. He had 
fought the Iraqi government intermittently over a long 
period and had entered Iran with some of his followers to 
join forces with the newly-created government in that country. 
Barzani installed himself and those Kurds who escaped 
with him among the Kurds of the USSR in Soviet Armenia. 
Here, now styling himself general, he bided his time for 
twelve years, at which point the Iraqi revolution of 14 July 
1958 erupted. Barzani and his exiled fellow-Kurds were 
invited back to Iraq by the new Premier, Qasim, and 
transported by two Soviet vessels to a triumphal welcome in 
Iraq. Qasim had indicated that he wished to integrate all 
the Iraqis (Kurd or Arab) into a single nation, but as time 
passed the Kurds under Barzani became dissatisfied with 
their treatment. By 1961 the Barzani group were at war from 
their mountain fastnesses with Qasim's army; this did not 
include all the Iraqi Kurds, however, for--as is customary 
among the Kurdish tribes--they were at loggerheads with one 
another. Nevertheless, the Kurds managed to continue their 
guerrilla warfare against the Iraqi Army until the end of 
the Qasim regime on February 3, 1963. Since than there has 
been an armed truce and negotiations have been going on 
between the revolutionary successor regime and the Barzani 
Kurds. It is not known how extensive Barzani's demands have 
been but it is clear that the new Iraqi Government, with 
President Arif as its nominal head, is likely to be prepared 
to offer as many concessions, short perhaps of offering full 
autonomy and independence for the Kurds, as it feels it can. 
Meanwhil9,the Soviet bloc--with the USSR well in the 
foreground?has been waging a furious propaganda campaign 
to incite both the Iraqi Communists and the Kurds to resist 
the new government. On 13 February, for example, a 
clandestine transmitter located in Bulgaria but broadcasting 
in Persian and Kurdish (and later in Arabic) from studios 
in Leipzig, East Germany, urged Kurdish listeners to rise 
against the new regime in Iraq and to join the Communist 
fighters in the south. The Kurds, the broadcast said, must

fight for the establishment of a joint Arab-Kurdish regime. 
The Iraqis were incensed by this outrageous intrusion into 
their internal affairs, and no doubt not a little irritated 
by all the name-calling which accompanied it (see attachment). 
Al Fajr al Jadid in Baghdad on 26 February exposed Communism 
as a pha7sophy of violence, anarchy and bloodshedding, "a 
suppressive system drawing its elements from Marxist philosophy 
which is without any human attributes...the crimes of the 
(Iraqi) Communists were inspired by international Communism': 
All these Bloc polemics have helped neither the Kurdish nor 
the Communist cause in Iraq one whit, and the round-up of 
Iraqi Communists, which began after the revolution early in 
February, continues.

636 AF,FE,NE,WH. Brazil's Congress of Solidarity with Cuba 
BACKGROUND: 
"The Congress of Solidarity with Cuba can count on the 
full support and sympathy of the World Peace Mpvement." 
With these words, the Soviet-manipulated World Peace 
Council (WPC), the hey international Communist front organi-
zation, in its December Bulletin signaled its plans to mobi-
lize resources to exploit the Congress of Solidarity with 
Cuba scheduled for  Rio de Janeiro Brazil, gC0 March. This 
r5usress-THEfiiiiii calle-ff-d-YT5Htih3iiral" Congreso although 
invitations have been sent to Asia, Africa and Europe too) 
is scheduled to be preceded by a national (Braziliaril meeting 
In support of Cuba, 26-27 March. 
Announced objectives of the Congress are: "To defend 
Cuba against aggre:;infiT..; to defend the right of the pea-
sants to own the land they till; to defend the right of stu-
dents and intellectuals not to debase themselves." The 
agenda proposes to discuss self-determination and non-inter-
vention; solidarity with the people of Cuba; sovereignty and 
national emancipation; and peace and the policy of world 
domination of imperialism. 
The predecessor of the Congress, the Latin American Con-
ference for National Sovereignty, Economic Emancipation and 
Peace sponsored by the WPC in Mexico City in March 1961, was 
attended by more than 280 leftists who "rubber-stamped" WPC-
drafted proposals which promoted "peace" by calling for agita-
tion throughout the Hemisphere. The 1961 meeting endorsed 
the formation of national liberation movements which have 
bec)me the action arms of Latin America's domestic Communist 
Parties responsible for terrorism in Venezuela and other 
countries. 
The most prominent initiator bf the Congress of Solidarity 
with Cuba scheduled for-Rio is the rabble-rouaing president 
of the Brazilian Peasants League, Francisco JULIAO. His 
anneal for a conference which was published in Cuba's Commu-
nist Party organ, Hoy, on 22 September 1952, touched off ser-
ious e-orts to stage the Congress to support Cuba. General 
Luiz GONZAGA president of Brazil's Society of Friends 
of Cuba, was designated chairman of the preparatory committee. 
JULIA? declared in late 1961, "1 am a Communist and I will

press accounts of his statement. He is described as a crypto 
Communist or pro-Communist. In any event, he has made it 
clear that he believes in violence and agitation as a means 
to achieve his objectives and that he is an admirer of Fidel 
Castro and Mao Tse-tung. His Peasants League has become a 
strong force for revolutionary agitation among Brazil's rural 
population. While some Brazilian Communists criticize his 
advocacy of violence, they have cooperated with him. JULIANO 
gained a national forum for preaching agitation when he was 
elected to the Brazilian Congress in October 1962. 
General GONZAGA, identified as a leftist military reserve 
officer, reportedly maintained clandestine contacts with 
Italian Communist guerrillas while serving with the Brazilian 
Army in World War II. Some sources maintain that he is a long-
time member of the Communist Party. 
The Continental Congress of Solidarity with Cuba in which 
international partieipation was invited, was formally announced 
in October 1952. It wan originally schedule fil for Januaey 1963, 
but financial problems, opposition of the Brazilian Communist 
Party (the BCP was critical of JULIA0 as organizer and report-
edly desired broadening the announced purpose of the meeting 
in order to enlist wider support and avoid antagonizing Bra-
zilian officials), and other difficulties forced a postpone-
ment until 28-30 Wurch. A behind-the-scenes view of the or-
ganizing problems vas supplied by secret documents found among 
the papers of a Cuban delegation aboard a Brazilian Irarig air-
liner which crashed near Lima, Peru, or 27 November 1962. A 
letter written by Cuba's "man in Brazil" to his headquarters 
detailed some of the problems, asked for guidance on whether 
to push to hold the meeting in January as scheduled and ap-
pealed for more funds to support it. While Brazilian officials 
minimized the significance of the documents, others cited their 
revelation of Cuba's involvement in the Congess and support 
of subversive guerrilla operations in razii os seetTicient 
cause for severing relations with Cuba. 
These factors plus the general political climate in Brazil 
may influence the administration of President Joao GOULART to 
try to discourage the convening of the Congress of Solidarity 
with Cuba in Rio. There are some reports that he is not pleased 
with developments. Ebwever, even if the Congress were post-
poned again the national meeting scheduled to precede it may 
still be held and the attendance of international observers 
at this session could, in effect, make it an international 
Congress of Solidarity with Cuba. 
7riction among Communists  and their sympathizers man also

the open. The Varig 21ane crash documents revealed some short-
comings in the Cuban-financed efforts of the president of the 
Brazilian Peasants League, JULIA?, to organize the meeting 
and to organize subversive guerrilla units. He visited Cuba 
for pre-Congress discussions in late February and early March. 
Also present in Havana was the BCP president, Luiz Carlos 
IPESTES, who arrived after a trip to Moscow. One may draw 
the logical conclusion that the meeting of these two Brazil-
ians in Havana has a direct bearing on the Congress. It is 
possible that Soviet pressure may be exerted to postpone the 
meeting. On the other hand, Communist emphasis on the "six,-
port-of-Cuba" theme at recent national Communist Party Con-
gresses in Europe and general propaganda makes it likely that 
some form of international support-for-Cuba meeting will take 
place although the site and time may be altered.

EXAMPLES OF RECENT BLOC PROPAGANDA & OF THE IRAQI REACTION 
Clandestine broadcast in Kurdish by Peyk-e Iran in East Germany 
26 February 1963: 
"Dear brothers and sisters of Iraqi Kurdistan: We begin 
our talk today with a question: How long will this fighting 
last? Approximately one year and a half has elapsed since 
the beginning of General Qasim's bloody aggression against 
Iraqi Kurdistan. Such a catastrophe, which was brought about 
by Fraqi dictatorship during the past year and a half and 
which descended upon the Kurdish nation, is unprecedented. 
"What was the reason for the establishment of a dictator-
ship in Iraq? Why did General Qasim dare to attack Kurdistan? 
And why was he able to bring this catastrophe upon the Kurdish 
nation? The reason was that the Iraqi democratic forces did 
net maintain an internal unity. Those on the side of dicta-
torehip took advantage of this situation. First they attacked 
the Communist Party. After they crushed the Communist Party, 
they went after the Kurdish Democratic Party. Not content 
with this, they incited such people as Kholah Zibari and others 
against the Furds. With this excuse they used all their guns, 
planes, and artillery to attack the Kurds. 
"Now the heroic Iraqi Kurdish brothers and sisters, after 
all these catastrophes, have a right to ask: "How long will 
the fighting last? How long will the calamity and bloodshed 
last?" These are legitimate questions. How and by what means 
can the Iraqi Kurdish nation get logical, correct, and guar-
anteed results from all these sacrifices? 
"The Iraqi Kurdish nation must be given its legitimate 
national rights within the framework of a democratic Iraq. 
This is demanded by all the Iraqi people; this is demanded 
by all Iraqi democratic forces. The Iraqi Kurdish nation must 
unite with the Arab nation of this land and form a united dem-
ocratic national front against Abd as-Salam Arif's fascist 
(bandits?) and against colonialism, in order Co reach their 
sacred goals. Cooneration with and support for the Iraqi dem-
ocratic forces is tha anlya7ray to destroy the Baghdad fascist 
rule and te restore freedom to the Iraqi Kurdish nation."

Moscow Radio, broadcasting a Tass editorial on 21 February 1963: 
"One's blood runs cold on learning the dramatic news of 
the horrible terror now sweeping Baghdad and other Iraqi towns," 
F. SeyfulaMulamkov writes in TRUD today. "Troops, police, 
and fascist thugs are organizing mass searches, arrests, beat-
ings, and the murder of hundreds and thousands of absolutely 
Innocent people." 
The article notes that the terror is aimed primarily against 
the working class and the leaders of mass democratic and pa-
triotic organizations. Through this brutal massacre, the re-
actionaries are striving to deal a stunning blow to the demo-
cratic and patriotic movement of the Iraqi people. 
The author recalls that Iraqi communists have made great 
sacrifices in the struggle for the national interests of their 
peoele. Despite the bloody terror of the monarchist agents 
of the colonialists, the communists, with other patriotic and 
democratic forces of the country, accomplished the glorious 
anti- imperialist revolution and overthrew the rotten monarchy 
in July 1958. After 14 July 1958, the author continues, the 
democratic forces of Iraq, and first of all the communists, 
continued the selfless struggle to implement the goals of the 
anti-imperialist revolution. Now, after the overthrow of the 
regime of Qasim's personal dictatorship, the reactionary forces 
are trying to cover their attempts to massacre communists and 
democrats by contending that they were allegedly the backbone 
of that regime.

in full contradiction to the proclaimed policy of national unity, 
freedom, democracy, and social justice. Terrorizing the demo-
cratic forces only plays into the hand of the aggressive im-
perialist circles, which are dreaming of restoring their lost 
positions in Iraq. Iraq, the author writes in conclusion, 
"is living through a tragic time. But as history has shown, 
a policy of arbitrariness against the popular masses, a san-
guinary anticommunist terror, will invariably suffer a defeat. 
"The freedom-loving people of Iraq will doubtlessly find 
sufficient strength to administer, through rallied and concerted 
action, a rebuff to the crazed reactionaries."

Radio Peyk-e Iran (Clandestine) in Arabic to Iraq 1510 
GMT 2 March carries the text of a cable addressed by the secre-
tary general of the central united council of Iranian trade 
unions, Reza Rusta, to Iraqi President Abd as-Salam Arif strong-
ly protesting the "barbaric crimes" being committed by the 
Iraqi Government "on the pretext of fighting communism" and 
demanding a halt to such action. 
The radio further carries a five-minute appeal issued by 
a member of the secretarist of the Iraqi women's league call-
ing upon world women to struggle to put an end to "the fascist 
campaign of annihilation" launched against the women in Iraq 
and to "topple the bloody dictatorship." 
The program concludes with a talk entitled "The Kurdish 
people are called upon to unite their forces to struggle against 
the ruling fascist clique," condemning the new regime in Iraq 
as one which is hostile to the Kurds and calls upon the Iraqi 
Kurds to unite their ranks to struggle against the "rule of 
blood and tears" for the sake of establishing their own na-
tionalist democratic rule.

/Peky-e Kran (E. Germany) in Kurdish 18 February 1963: 
"What is the aim of the Kurdish nation's struggle in Iraq? 
The Iraqi Kurdish people demand their legal national and dem-
ocratic rights within the framework of a free, democratic, 
and independent Iraq. They demand to be delivered from the 
burdens of oppression and discrimination. The heroic Iraqi  
Communist Party has always defended the demands of the Kurdish 
people with clarity and lucidity. During the past two years, 
in which a despotic one-man rule burnt Iraqi Kurdistan with 
bombs and bullets, the only Iraqi organization which raised 
its voice in the defense of the Kurdish nation was the Iraqi 
Communist Party. And now only a (word indistinct) democratic 
government dependent on the Iraqi people can satisfy the nation-
al and democratic demands of the Kurdish people." Arif is 
the servant of colonialism and the enemy of the peoples. "This 
(corrupt?) element will suppress the liberating Kurdish revolu-
tion the first opportunity he finds. 
"Dear Iraqi Kurdish brothers: Do not lose the opportunity 
in vain. All Iraqi people--the Kurds and the Arabs--have the 
same fate and the same destiny. It is now incumbent for Kurds 
and Arabs to (word indistinct) in a united way, to enter the 
battle, to destroy the fascist government of Abd as-Salam Arif, 
and to establish a democratic government in their homeland. 
Do not forget this great historic duty."

Iraqi Communist movement which is considered thZ- strongest 
Communist movement in the Middle East and the tool for a first 
coup d'etat in favor of the Soviet Union in this area. 
"All the neutral states enjoying full sovereignty and the 
other states following Western and American policy have, na-
turally, refused for various reasons to allow the Soviet Union 
a foothold in this area. From the many documents which Ramadhn 
14 July 1958 revolutionary government seized, it was revealed 
that it was expected to establish the first full Communist 
rule in Iraq to be under the entire domination of the Soviet 
Union. 
"The setback of the Soviet Union was, no doubt, great when 
it found another large and deep-rooted popular movement up-
setting its plans and depriving it of the fruits of victory 
by establishing the first Communist prop in the Middle East. 
That is why we are not astonished at the mad campaigns follow-
ing this setback, for it is said that the rage will be more 
intense when the ripe fruit which is about to be swallowed is 
lost. 
"The Cuban adventure for both Russia and America has had 
some effect. We are now concerned with the Soviet Union only. 
"Soviet leaders found themselves accused of betraying the 
Communist principles which call for the defense of any other 
Communist state subjected to aggression by the American bloc 
states. 
"This accusation made by China has led the Soviet rulers

cowardice in front of the United States, whereas they came 
to our meek small nation to play the role of heroism. But, 
in fact, they lost the love and respect of both peoples, the 
Cuban and the Iraqi peoples, who have erased the name of the

Congress of Solidarity with Cuba 
Communist Appeals for Support 
Statements used by Communists in their pre-Congress 
publicity for the Congress of Solidarity with Cuba, scheduled 
for the 28th to the 30th of March in Brazil, include the 
following appeals and misrepresentation: 
"A large group of people, well-known in Brazil 
in the field of politics, science and arts ... 
took the initiative of convening a Continental 
Congress." 
"The people of Brazil welcome the Congress with 
enthusiasm and thousands from all walks of life 
are supporting it." 
"Eminent persons from all over the world ... 
will be participating." 
"The Congress is open to all people and 
organizations -- trade unions, peasants, 
cultural, humanitarian, political, youth and 
women's, etc." 
.., to show the collective will of all men and 
women of our continent." 
... men and women throughout the world.., whose 
one aspiration is the preservation of peace." 
See also the report of the security committee of the 
Organization of American States (released on 22 February 
and reported in many papers) warning against Communist 
subversion. This report of official opinion in the Western 
Hemisphere directly refutes attempts of the Congress of 
Solidarity with Cuba to speak for all the people of the area.
