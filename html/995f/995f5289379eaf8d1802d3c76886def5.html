 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD __ SENATE
 Welfare and the National Aeronautics and
 Space Administration, which he said are
 about to begin, in using communications
 satellites for an educational television net-
 work.  Further progress will be achieved if
 Congress accedes to the President's recom-
 mendation for congressional hearings on re-
 lated issues of public policy.
 Whether the full scope of the Carnegie
 commission's proposal-which is broader
 than Mr. Bundy's-can be realized will de-
 pend on support of the proposed tax on tele-
 vision sets or- some other means of raising
 comparable revenue. At this begi.ining stage
 the President's broad support of the corpo-
 ration idea is a constructive impetus.  We
 hope Congress is equally aware that our
 country has "only begun to grasp the great
 promise" of television, and equally concerned
 for that promise's fulfillment.
 [From the New York Times, Mar. 4, 1967]
 TELEVISION FOR THE PEOPLE
 President Johnson has responded swiftly
 and constructively to the proposals of the
 Carnegie Commission and the Ford Founda-
 tion for Federal action to spur the growth
 of educational television.
 In his message to Congress the President
 wisely steers clear of any attempt to preor-
 dain the shape of a noncommercial television
 system, the relative degree of responsibility
 to be allocated to network or individual sta-
 tions or the sources of financial support.
 Instead, he proposes the establishment of
 a Corporation for Public Television, with fif-
 teen board members to be appointed by the
 President but to operate free of Government
 control.  By emphasizing that diversity is
 the key to effectiveness for the new medium,
 Mr. Johnson makes it plain that he puts at
 least as much stress on the development of
 strong community stations as he does on a
 central apparatus to rival the established
 networks.
 The $i0-raliliori grant the Ford Founda-
 tion has made available to finance "imagina-
 tive experiments" next fall in noncommer-
 cial network programs will provide a demon-
 stration of the potentialities on the network
 side. The hope must be that some compar-
 able source of private financing will be found
 soon for comparable experiments. in origi-
 nality and service by community TV stations.
 Out of such demonstrations can come val-
 uable guides to the Johnson-proposed com-
 mission on the kind of interrelations that
 will best serve the end of "excellence within
 diversity" set forth so persuasively in the
 Carnegie report. The caliber of the commis-
 sion's own members and, equally important,
 of its choice for executive director will de-
 termine how useful a contribution it makes
 to shaping intelligent public policy in a field
 of limitless possbilities for cultural enrich-
 ment and public enjoyment.
 MIAMI, FLA., HERALD ENDORSES IN-
 TERSTATE LAND SALES FULL DIS-
 CLOSURE ACT OF 1967
 Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey. Mr.
 President, the Miami, Fla., Herald has,
 over the years, taken a leading role in
 exposing unscrupulous real estate pro-
 moters who sell undeveloped land across
 State lines. Only last year Fred Fogarty
 the Herald's real estate editor testified
 at hearings before the Senate Banking
 and Currency Committee on the need for
 additional consumer protection legisla-
 tion in this area-both on the State and
 Federal levels.
 I believe, therefore, that the Herald's
 editorial of March 1, 1967, entitled "It's
 Time United States Moved in on Pi-
 racy in Land Sales," will be of great in-
 terest to all Members of this body.
 In its editorial which endorses the In-
 terstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act,
 the Herald declares that-
 Even in states that have passed laws to
 protect the public, such as Florida, the job
 is not getting done. As we have pointed out
 so often in this business of states' rights,
 what the states refuse to do, the federal gov-
 ernment will do.
 The Herald ends its editorial by stat-
 ing:
 What Sen. Williams hopes to enact is a law
 patterned after the Securities Acts of 1933
 and 1934 that brought a level of honesty to
 the stock market. Those laws offer the pub-
 lic protection through full and accurate in-
 formation on which to make investment
 decisions.
 The Wall Street bucketshops have been out-
 lawed. It is time to do the same with the
 land pirates.
 I believe the Senate should have the
 benefit of the full text of this informative
 commentary; therefore, I ask unanimous
 consent that the editorial be printed in
 the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Miami Herald, Mar. 1, 1967]
 IT'S TIME UNITED STATES MOVED IN ON PIRACY
 IN LAND SALES
 There are 28 states without legislation to
 deal with the land pirates who separate
 people from their money in exchange for a
 piece of unusable real estate in the middle
 of a swamp, a desert, a flood control area, the
 side of a mountain or a remote arid plateau.
 Yet even in states that have passed laws to
 protect the public, such as Florida, the job
 is not getting done: As we have pointed out
 so often in this business of states' riglats,
 what the states refuse to do, the federal gov-
 ernment will do.
 That is the reason for the hearings that
 opened yesterday on the proposed Interstate
 Land Sales Full Disclosure Act. Spearheaded
 once again by Sen. Harrison Williams Jr. of
 New Jersey, this is an effort to establlish
 effective authority over mail order land sales
 to protect both the buyer and the legitimate
 seller against loss and injury.
 Evidence of widespread misrepresentation
 has been obtained by the Senate's subcom-
 mittee on frauds affecting the elderly. It is
 the person looking for an idyllic retirement
 home who so often fails victim to the
 swamp peddler.
 And Florida, despite its Installment Land
 Sales Board, has more than its share of the
 sleazy types who promise a paradise in the
 sunshine and deliver an inaccessible or un-
 usuable tract of swampy wilderness.
 Certainly it is true that the Florida :law
 demands that a property report be delivered
 to the purchaser. It is also true that many
 people put up a down payment despite avail-
 ability of a report disclosing that the land
 is subject to flooding 80 per cent of the year,
 that drainage is not feasible, that mortgaging
 would be difficult.
 But what happens to the concept of prop-
 erty report disclosure when a bucketshop
 operation is set up and the customer is
 romanced by long-distance telephone with
 phony stories of oil discoveries and expected
 price increases? These are the sharp prac-
 tices that Florida's law now countenances,
 What Sen. Williams hopes to enact is a law
 patterned after the Securities Acts of 11733
 and 1934 that brought a level of honesty to
 the stock market. Those laws offer the pub-
 lic protection through full and accurate in-
 formation on which to make investment
 decisions.
 The Wall Street bucketshops have been
 S 3835
 outlawed. It is time to do the same with
 the land pirates.
 CONCLUSION OF MORNING
 BUSINESS
 The PRESIDING OFFICER  (Mr.
 HOLLINGS in the chair). Is there further
 morning business? If not, morning
 business tconclude
 ONSULAR CONVENTION WITH THE
 SOVIET UNION
 The   PRESIDING  OFFICER. The
 Chair lays before the Senate the pending
 business, which will be stated.
 The ASSISTANT LEGISLATIVE CLERK,  A
 Consular Convention between the United
 States of America and the Union of So-
 viet Socialist Republics, together with a
 protocol relating thereto, signed at Mos-
 cow on June 1, 1964 (Ex. D., 88th Cong.,
 second sess.).
 The Senate resumed the consideration
 of the convention.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. The
 pending question is on agreeing to ex-
 ecutive reservation No. 2, offered by the
 Senator from  South  Dakota  [Mr.
 MUNDT] and other Senators.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I
 suggest the absence of a quorum, with
 the time to be taken out of this side.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. The
 clerk will call the roll.
 The assistant legislative clerk pro-
 ceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I
 yield 10 minutes to the distinguished
 Senator from Ohio [Mr. YOUNG].
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President,
 I rise to express opposition to the pend-
 ing reservation and to any reservation
 that would indefinitely postpone or kill
 the Consular Treaty, which should be
 ratified by the Senate. I plead for rati-
 fication as I did some years back for the
 limited nuclear test ban treaty achieved
 by our late, . great President John F.
 Kennedy, with the help of our present
 Ambassador at Large, Averill Harriman.
 In his plea for ratification of the lim-
 ited test ban treaty, President John F.
 Kennedy said:
 According to the ancient Chinese proverb,
 "A journey of a thousand miles must begin
 with a single step." My fellow Americans,
 let us take that first step. Let us, if we can,
 get back from the shadows of war and seek
 out the way of peace. And if that journey
 is one thousand miles or even more, let his-
 tory record that we in this land at this time
 took the first step.
 Mr. President, we all recall that prior
 to ratification of this Limited Nuclear
 Test Ban Treaty there were many who
 gave out dire warnings that it would
 mean capitulation to the Russians, that
 it would be a threat to American security,
 that they would immediately violate it,
 and so forth. Now, we have heard simi-
 lar arguments from those opposing rati-
 fication of the Consular Treaty with the
 Soviet Union-from those maintaining
 that this treaty is not in the best inter-

 S 3836                CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 gists of the United States. Very defi-
 nitely this treaty is in the best interest of
 our country. In addition, we have all
 been subjected to a forceful blitz of
 propaganda attacking  this proposed
 Consular Treaty, instigated by extremist
 rightwing groups such as the Liberty
 Lobby, the John Birch Society, and
 others of that ilk.
 M1,. President, I doubt that there is
 one among us who would maintain that
 the .imtted nuclear test ban treaty has
 in any way endangered the security of
 the United States in the 3112 years it has
 been in effect. In fact, having reduced
 the dangers of radioactive fallout, it has
 been highly beneficial and reassuring to
 the people of the United States, as well
 as to people the world over. Similarly,
 we would all find 2 or 3 years from now-
 even 6 months from now-that the Con-
 sular Treaty with the Soviet Union will
 also be of benefit to citizens of the United
 States.
 Mr. President, some in this Chamber,
 realizing that they will be unable to pre-
 vent ratification of the treaty, have re-
 sorted to other means which would lit-
 erally cancel the effectiveness of the
 treaty and in fact postpone its operation
 indefinitely. Such is the second reserva-
 tion proposed by the senior Senator from
 South Dakota [Mr. MUNDTI. His reser-
 vation, which would literally postpone
 the treaty's becoming operative until the
 end of our involvement In the war In
 Vietnam, would mean, in effect, the de-
 struction of the treaty. His argument,
 that it Is more important to protect the
 500,000 boys in Vietnam than to protect
 a few American citizens traveling In the
 Soviet Union, is a complete non sequitur.
 This treaty, whether it is ratified as sub-
 mitted to the Senate or with such a res-
 ervation, would not In any way affect the
 conduct of the war in Vietnam. Very
 definitely, I feel that the Senator from
 South Dakota and those others who are
 using this kind of argument are appeal-
 ing to irrational claims of the type which
 always flourish in time of war.
 In the course of this debate some of
 those expressing vigorous opposition to
 our ratification of the Consular Conven-
 tion have even asserted that the Russians
 have violated every treaty they have
 made with this country. Very definitely
 this is not true. Admittedly, while the
 cruel tyrant Stalin was dictator of the
 Soviet Union, he was constantly threat-
 ening aggression and violating agree-
 ments he made. The Soviet Union dur-
 ing his regime blockaded Berlin, posed a
 threat to Western Europe, and its leaders
 made belligerent statements and rattled
 their nuclear weapons. The two great
 Communist powers. China and the So-
 viet Union, seemed alined against the
 free world. That was many years ago.
 Stalin is no longer the dictator of the
 Soviet Union; yet, too many people think
 our foreign policy should be based today
 on what occurred 20 years ago follow-
 ing World War II.
 Times have changed. The Soviet Un-
 ion, now a "have" nation instead of a
 "have not" nation, Is definitely veering
 toward capitalism. Russian leaders of
 the Kremlin appear to genuinely seek
 friendship with nations of the free world
 and they speak of coexistence instead of
 coannihilatlon. Along its 6,500-mile com-
 mon border with Red China, the Soviet
 Union has been massing additional di-
 visions of its troops.  Bitterly hostile
 statements during recent months have
 come out of Peking denouncing the lead-
 ers of the Kremlin, and the antagonism
 between the Soviet Union and Commu-
 nist China seems to be-increasing and
 has been accompanied by violence and
 turbulence in some areas close to the
 common border. Also Premier Kosygin
 has repeatedly and violently denounced
 Communist leaders of mainland China.
 Mr. President. in October 1964, I did
 not often find myself in agreement with
 the distinguished Senator from Arizona,
 Mr. Goldwater. However, I recall at that
 time he made what I consider to be a
 very wise statement when he stated that
 within 10 years, if the United States
 should be at war with Red China, the
 Soviet Union would be fighting as an
 ally on the side of the United States
 against Red China.
 Obviously it would be a grave mistake
 were we to reject ratification of this
 Consular Treaty. Very definitely the ne-
 gotiations for this treaty, which extended
 over a period of several years and were
 carefully and intelligently conducted by
 our officials, who proposed this treaty to
 Soviet leaders, should result In ratifica-
 tion. The Soviet Union is obligated un-
 der this treaty to commitments highly
 advantageous to the many thousands of
 American tourists who will be traveling
 each year in the Soviet Union. In that
 regard, only a few hundred Soviet citi-
 zens visit the United States annually,
 The total this year of American tourists
 visiting Russia may exceed 18,000, The
 total of nationals of the Soviet Union
 visiting our country this year will cer-
 tainly be fewer than 2,000. This treaty
 is much more in our national Interest
 than In the interest of the Soviet Union.
 Patrick Henry on a historic occasion,
 as recorded In our colonial history of
 which we are so proud, said:
 There is but one lamp by which my feet
 are guided. That is the lamp of experience.
 I know of no way to judge the future except
 by the past.
 Concerning the Limited Nuclear Test
 Ban Treaty, the facts are the Soviet
 Union has meticulously compiled with its
 obligations.  Since ratification of that
 treaty, there has never been a whisper
 of any alleged violation on the part of
 the Soviet Union. Surely there is every
 reason to believe that the provisions of
 this treaty will be respected and complied
 with.
 It is Interesting to note that at the
 recent parliamentary election in the So-
 viet Union. Vyacheslav Molotov, who was
 the internationally known spokesman
 for Stalin throughout his years of power,
 when he walked publicly in Moscow to
 the polling place where he and Nikita
 Khrushchev both voted, received no
 cheers, no greeting whatsoever from the
 assembled Russians but was looked on
 somewhat disdainfully by the citizens
 gathered to vote or to look at celebrities
 who were expected to vote. In the few
 years following the close of World War
 U, Molotov was the right-hand man and
 March 15, 1967
 enforcer of the tyrannica Premier Josef
 Stalin.
 The low regard that leaders of the free
 world held toward him at the time and
 in retrospect seems matched by the pres-
 ent low regard and in fact contempt of
 Russian citizens.  At tre same time
 Nikita Khrushchev, who became Premier
 of the Soviet Union a considerable num-
 ber of years following the death of Stalin,
 was cheered and greeted enthusiastically
 and affectionately by thousands of Rus-
 sian men and women. Former Premier
 Nikita Khrushchev appeared surprised
 and happy over the enthusiastic and
 most cordial greeting.  According to
 newspaper reports he doffed his hat and
 said, "Let there be peace."
 We take an important step toward
 world peace in ratification of this Con-
 sular treaty.
 Peace hath her victories no less renowned
 than war-
 Wrote John Milton many years ago.
 It is even more true now than then. The
 great German poet, Frederic von Schil-
 lei', wrote:
 Peace is rarely denied to the peaceful.
 Our late great President John F. Ken-
 nedy said:
 While maintaining our readiness for war,
 let ut. exhaust every avenue for peace. Let
 us always make clear our willingness to talk
 if talk will help and our readiness to fight if
 fight we must.
 Mr. President, the benefits of this Con-
 sular Treaty are great. For us to ratify
 this treaty would be a smell step forward
 on tae "journey of              To
 change or amend it with crippling-
 res-ervations would indefinlt~ly postpone it
 and in fact would prove to be a rejection
 of the treaty. Were we to do this it would
 be taking a step backward instead of for-
 ward on that 1,000-mile tourney toward
 permanent peace.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I
 suggest the absence of a quorum.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. To
 whom will the time be charged?
 Mr. MANSFIELD. On this side.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will
 call the roll.
 The assistant legislat:.ve clerk pro-
 ceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out abjection, It is so ordered.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield myself 10
 minutes. Now that the Chamber is
 crowded, I think it is appropriate to
 make my remarks in op iosition to the
 pending reservation. [Laughter.]
 Mr. President, the reservation pro-
 posed by the distinguished Senator from.
 South Dakota stipulate; that instru-
 ments of ratification shall not be ex-
 changed until the President determines
 and reports to Congress that it is no
 longer necessary to assign American
 forces to combat duties in South Viet-
 nam, or that removing American forces

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 Does the Senator from South Dakota
 really believe that the Soviets are so anx-
 ious to have the Consular Convention
 enter into force that they would be will-
 ing to reduce their support to North Viet-
 nam? As I have pointed out before, we
 wanted the Consular Convention in the
 first place and we still want it-and
 want it now-because it provides for
 the increased protection of American
 citizens traveling in the Soviet Union,
 It is unrealistic, at best, to expect the So-
 viets to make a concession to us in order
 to obtain ratification of a treaty that we
 are more anxious to have than they
 are, and that appears to be more to our
 advantage than to theirs.
 The obvious effect of this reservation
 would be to strain our relations with
 the Soviet Union still further. It is quite
 true that the Soviets are supplying mil-
 itary assistance to North Vietnam.
 North Vietnam is a socialist country,
 and thus an ideological ally of the Soviet
 Union. But it is also obvious that we
 are providing not only military assist-
 ance but also half a million men to our
 ally, South Vietnam; and our military
 assistance to South Vietnam predates
 Soviet assistance to North Vietnam, and
 is much greater.
 The reservation is not designed to
 bring the war in Vietnam to an :end. I
 only with that it could. If it would, I
 would be the first to vote for it. But to
 pretend that there is the slightest chance
 that any action we take on the Consular
 Convention would have this result is, I
 think, either a delusion or a deception.
 Nor is the reservation intended to show
 the Soviets our concern over the situa-
 tion in Vietnam-a concern that they
 know and understand very well. The
 purpose of this reservation is, purely and
 simply, to kill the treaty.
 There are some in the Senate who
 want to kill the Consular Convention be-
 cause they are opposed to ratifying this
 agreement with the Soviets-or any
 agreement with the Soviets-on the
 ground that such action will be regarded
 as a mark of confusion by our allies and
 as a confession of weakness by our en-
 emies. I repeat at this point a para-
 graph from the statement made on the
 floor by the Senator from Arkansas, the
 chairman of the Committee on Foreign
 Relations [Mr. FULBRIGHT], on March
 7. He said:
 It is difficult for me to understand and
 accept the fact that there are some in the
 Senate who, given an opportunity to im-
 prove relations in some small way with the
 Soviet Union and of reducing the tensions
 that exist in our relations with that country,
 prefer that we not do so but that instead we
 keep relations frozen and tensions highly
 charged. I would certainly understand this
 attitude if it were motivated by an opposi.
 tion to appeasement-that is, if this con-
 vention, or any of the East-West measures
 that I have mentioned represented a sacri-
 fice to the Soviets designed to mollify them.
 But I cannot understand why any Senator
 would hesitate to seize an opportunity to
 voice his approval for an agreement with the
 Soviet Union which offers us certain benefits
 in protecting American citizens traveling in
 the Soviet Union which we sought in the
 first place. I do not see how ratifying such
 an `agreement could be construed as a mark
 of confusion or a confession of weakness.
 On the contrary, if I were the leader of
 North Vietnam I would be concerned at any
 sign of a rapprochement between an ally on
 whom I depended heavily and my opponent,
 especially if my ally and my opponent were
 the two most powerful countries in the
 world. And If I were an ally of the United
 States it would worry me to see the United
 States spurn an opportunity to reduce the
 tensions which might, if they are not re-
 duced, lead to a conflict in which I might
 become involved simply because I was an
 ally of one of the protagonists.
 The United States and the Soviet
 Union are the two most powerful coun-
 tries in the world. We must be able to
 regulate our normal affairs, as we have
 in the past 6 months by signing a Civil
 Air Transport Agreement and an agree-
 ment on fishing problems in the north-
 east part of the Pacific Ocean-both
 Executive agreements, I should add.
 Surely our objective in our relations with
 the Soviet Union-or with any other
 state-should be to reduce the areas of
 disagreement and enlarge the areas of
 agreement-not to permit our disagree-
 ments to widen and to embrace every
 aspect of our relations with the other
 most powerful nation in the world today.
 Mr. President, I understand that refer-
 ences were made yesterday, in re-
 sponse to the argument raised about
 affording protection to 18,000 Ameri-
 cans in the Soviet Union, in relation to
 the importance of protecting the 500,000
 men in Vietnam; or adjacent to it, and a
 correlation was made between the 18,000
 and the 500,000, and,the effects that the
 convention might have on them.
 What was not brought out yesterday
 was the point that the inclusion of a
 reservation tying the treaty to ending
 the hostilities in Vietnam, or even de-
 feating the treaty, would not accelerate
 by 1 day the conclusion of the war in
 Vietnam.
 I can only say that refusal to ratify
 this treaty or even to postpone its pro-
 visions and protections until the war in
 Vietnam is concluded would be simply a
 rejection of protection which, under the
 agreement now before the Senate, could
 be afforded to the projected 18,000 or
 more Americans who would be traveling
 in the Soviet Union this year, without
 improving the lot of one single person of
 the 500,000 now located in and around
 Vietnam.
 Mr. President, in response to my re-
 quest, I have also received another letter
 from the Secretary of State, relative to
 the pending reservation No. 2.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. The
 Senator's time has expired.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield myself 5 ad-
 ditional minutes.
 The letter is dated March 14, and is
 addressed to me. It reads as follows:
 In response to your inquiry, I am pleased
 to give the viewpoint of the Department of
 State regarding a proposed reservation to the
 US-USSR Consular Convention now before
 the Senate.
 This reservation would provide that the
 Consular Convention would not enter in
 force until the President advises Congress
 that there is "no longer a need for U.S.
 Forces in Viet-Nam" or that any war mate-
 rial and arms the Soviet Union is furnishing
 to North Viet-Nam are "not delaying or
 preventing a return of U.S, troops" from
 Viet-Nam.
 This reservation would preclude or sub-
 S 3837
 stantially delay the entry into force of the
 Consular Convention. We need the Conven-
 tion now, and without delay, to secure some
 elementary rights of consular access and
 notification for American citizens present in
 the USSR.
 Soviet nationals already enjoy the protec-
 tions of the U.S. Constitution and of our
 legal system in a free, society, should they
 be accused of a crime. But under present
 Soviet law, arrested persons can be held in-
 communicado for nine months or more dur-
 ing investigation of a criminal charge. The
 Consular Convention contains major "due
 process" concessions by the USSR. It speci-
 fies that U.S. officials will be notified imme-
 diately (within 1-3 days) when an American
 citizen is arrested or detained in the USSR,
 and it stipulates that these officials will be
 allowed to visit the American without delay
 (within 2-4 days), and it provides that ac-
 cess will be allowed on a continuing basis
 thereafter. These features will become op-
 erative without the opening of consulates.
 As soon as this treaty is ratified and en-
 ters into force diplomatic officers now at-
 tached to our Embassy in Moscow who are
 notified to the Soviet Government as con-
 sular officers will have these important rights
 of notification and access, whether or not
 consulates are eventually opened as the re-
 sult of separate negotiations.
 Please do not hesitate to call on me if I
 can provide any further information or
 assistance.
 So I would say in conclusion that we
 ought to separate the question of a con-
 sulate or consulates in both countries
 from the question of the protection of
 the projected 18,000 or more Americans
 who will visit the Soviet Union this year.
 The right to establish consulates is not
 before the Senate. That is a preroga-
 tive of the executive branch, and if it is
 done it will be done on a determination
 by the President. But the question of
 protecting American citizens in the So-
 viet Union is before the Senate, and that
 is the important factor of this conven-
 tion before us.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Who
 yields time?
 Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, I yield
 myself 10 minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  The
 Senator from South Dakota is recognized
 for 10 minutes,
 Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, while the
 distinguished majority leader is still in
 the Chamber, I would like to comment
 on the statement he has just made,
 which statement represents very actively
 and vigorously, certainly, the adminis-
 tration's point of view on this treaty.
 The first point the majority leader
 made was that the Soviets are not very
 anxious for this treaty and that there-
 fore we could not utilize this reservation
 which is now before the Senate, execu-
 tive reservation No. 2, as a tool in order
 to get from them certain concessions,
 because we want the treaty more than
 they do.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  The Senator is
 correct.
 Mr. MUNDT. The point is made that
 we want the treaty more than they do
 and consequently there would be no in-
 ducement for them to conform with
 the terms of the reservation.
 Mr. President, it is undoubtedly true
 that the immunity feature of this pro-
 vision in the treaty is something which
 the Russians want and which we are not

 so desirous about. We are desirous of
 the other two aspects-notification and
 consolation. On the basis of that one
 unprecedented feature they want and
 insist upon, it was agreed at the con-
 ferences on the two features of notifica-
 tion and consultation that we want.
 But, there is something you and I know
 that they want more than anything we
 want, and something they want much
 more even than the Immunity features
 of the treaty, and that is that they want
 the continuation and expansion of
 American exports to help shore up their
 stan,ering industrial economy.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President. will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MUNDT. I yield.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Personally. I think
 that American exports to Eastern Europe
 and the Soviet Union could have a very
 good effect as far as we are concerned.
 It is my understanding that the people
 in the Soviet Union are demanding more
 of their Government in the way of con-
 sumer goods.
 Mr. MUNDT. The Senator is correct.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. And if we can help
 to accelerate that demand, I think that
 we could lay the groundwork for a shift
 away from communism and thereby a
 shift toward capitalism, which I think
 would be in our interest.
 Mr. MUNDT. I Just do not see the
 relationship between those two. but I
 quite agree with the facts involved, that
 the consuming groups in Russia are eager
 to have additional consumer goods, and
 their country is unable to provide them,
 in part because communism is not a good,
 efficient, and effective economic and pro-
 ductive system, and primarily because,
 while they have developed some fine
 equipment and some good production
 plants, they are utilizing them primarily
 for making war supplies-war supplies
 which are being sent to Vietnam, in part,
 and war supplies which are being erect-
 ed and constructed in Russia in part be-
 cause of the uneasy and distrustful feel-
 ing which exists in terms of potential war
 between their part of the world and ours.
 It is war equipment which is very ex-
 pensive and difficult to make-for exam-
 ple, their antiballistic system around
 Moscow-so costly, in fact, that we in
 this country are importuned by the ad-
 ministration to say: "We can't afford to
 build one here."  However, they are
 building one there.  They have other
 kinds of intricate missile defense estab-
 lishments, perhaps not as effective as
 their antiballistic system around Mos-
 cow, but they have them around in other
 areas and communities of the U.S.S.R.
 as well.
 That, of course. puts a strain on their
 economy and makes it more difficult for
 them to satisfy their consumer goods,
 and because their consumers are becom-
 ing restive and because they are becom-
 ing embittered about the fact that they
 lag behind so much of the rest of the
 civilized world, the pressure Is on the
 politicians in the Kremlin to make more
 consumer goods available to the Russian
 people.
 If we make them available now to the
 Russians, that is important to them. It
 is something that they want and insisted
 upon and something that they will en-
 deavor to expand by means of the eco-
 nomic attaches who will come over with
 new the consulate or consulates.
 We do have available in this reserva-
 tion a diplomatic tool. We do have a
 negotiating wedge to use in saying to the
 Russians: "You want a treaty. We want
 a treaty. You want the immunity pro-
 vision. This is advantageous to you, but
 if you want to have the economic trade
 attached to it you will have to curb or
 cuinail your shipment of war supplies to
 Hanoi," And I hope the shipment of
 war supplies to Hanoi will be curbed.
 That is point No.1.
 This expectation is part of our reser-
 vation. It is something that we can use
 to get a concession from the Russians.
 And I think they can be induced, because
 I believe they desperately need this vast
 amount of exports that was opened up
 by President Johnson's Executive order
 of last October 12.
 The Senator was correct when he said
 that we want the treaty. They want the
 immunity and we want the two features
 of notification and consultation.
 Senators and constituents will have
 to weigh those two elements together to
 determine exactly who is getting the bet-
 ter of the deal; but in all events we get
 the right of notification and consultation
 for any of the 18,000 who might get In
 trouble over there-and they have aver-
 aged nine Americans per year. We get
 that and nothing else of importance to
 us.
 I would relate those points to the fact
 that we have 500,000 Americans in Eu-
 rope who are there in uniform and who
 are in big trouble In Vietnam because
 they are answering the call of the colors
 and responding courageously and bravely
 to the needs of the state.
 I do not think, therefore, that it is
 either a delusion or a deception to be-
 lieve that the reservation can help
 shorten the war. I think anything that
 can help slow down the shipment of
 equipment to the enemy in Vietnam-
 because they rely on these outside sources
 for their supplies-will tend to shorten
 the war.
 I honestly believe that anything that
 makes it more probable, makes It more
 likely, makes it easier for the Russians
 to send war supplies to Vietnam will
 prolong the war. I cannot escape the
 conviction, because it seems to me as
 clear as the path to the country school-
 house. that when we send supplies to the
 industrial economy of Russia, we free
 men, we free materials, we free machines
 to go into war production for their sup-
 ply lines to Vietnam, whether we ship to
 them consumer goods or strictly non-
 consumer goods.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MUNDT. I yield.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. I point out, as the
 Senator well knows. that we are not dis-
 cussing a trade convention. The matter
 before us has nothing to do with trade,
 nothing to do with the shipment of goods,
 but, purely and simply, is concerned with
 the protection of American citizens who
 may be traveling in the Soviet Union. Is
 that not a correct statement?
 Mr.  MUNDT. The Senator from
 Montana would have to modify that
 statement a little before I could give my
 affirmation to it. We would have to ask
 why they want a consular office in this
 country, in the first place. They want
 a consular office in this country, in the
 first place-and we would, have a con-
 sular office in Russia-becc.use it helps to
 stimulate  economic  trade. That  is
 written into the treaty.
 As the Senator from Oregon pointed
 out yesterday, all consula offices func-
 tion in large part to help stimulate eco-
 nomic exchange between the two coun-
 tries. In peacetime this might be good,
 but in wartime it expands the casualty
 lists suffered by American troops in
 Vietnam.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. But this conven-
 tion has nothing to do with the estab-
 lishmeant of consulates :ither in the
 Soviet Union or in the United States.
 That, as I have attempted to indicate, is
 purely an Executive function which the
 President can put into force at any time.
 Furthermore, before a consulate will
 be established in this cou atry-if one is
 ever (stablished-the Secretary of State
 has indicated that he will discuss this
 matter with the Committee on Foreign
 Relat.ons, with the leadership on both
 sides of the Senate, with interested Sen-
 ators, and with the chief municipal and
 State officers in any area where there is
 a possibility that a consulate will be es-
 tablished.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. The
 Senator's 5 minutes have expired.
 Mr MANSFIELD. Is that a correct
 statement?
 Mr MUNDT. That is a correct state-
 ment                                                                            I was in the room at the time of
 the hearing, when the Secretary made
 that statement, and I asked him this
 question :               -
 That is interesting. Does that mean that
 if a consular office is to be established, or
 several consular offices, and ;,ou consult with
 the members of the commitlee and with the
 leadership and they say, "No, we don't want
 one," does that mean that one will not be
 established?
 He refused to agree to that. He said:
 No. This is a presidential power.
 I believe we would be notified. I be-
 lieve we would get about the same pro-
 tecticn that an Americans traveler gets
 in Russia under this treaty.  We get
 notification and consultation, but we do
 not have freedom of action, and I be-
 lieve that is also in the rec)rd.
 It is an executive function, it is a pres-
 idential power, and the Secretary of State
 properly said that they would talk with
 us, they would consult with us, they would
 notify us, but he would not agree to put
 a consular office in a community that did
 not want it or to estabish one if the
 Senate did not approve of it.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator asked
 the Secretary of State a question which
 no man who is charged with that respon-
 sibility could answer definitely.
 Mr. MUNDT. He answered it honest-
 ly, and I believe definitively.
 Mr, MANSFIELD. He recognized, as
 does the Senator from South Dakota,
 that It is a prerogative within the power
 of the Presidency itself. But it would

 a greater distance with greater ease,
 Otherwise they would have had to take
 their heavy mortors through the brush
 in order to get closer to do their evil
 >ork. Now, with sophisticated rockets
 they can operate from a greater distance
 with greater ease.  This makes them
 more effective.
 If the Soviets are as interested in
 building bridges as we are they could
 start by not sending these Russian-made
 rockets to the Vietcong, as well as many
 other things that they send.
 Mr. MUNDT. The Senator is correct.
 The Senator has given a vivid, graphic,
 and a current bit of information in com-
 plete support of my position that if the
 Senate wants to do something to try to
 shorten the war-and I cannot guarantee
 that ~s going to happen-and if we want
 to try even to do something to make it
 less possible for the North Vietnamese to
 prolong the war, we have that opportu-
 nity in this vote.
 We would take that step in the form of
 a reservation which does not alter,
 change, or modify the treaty at all, ex-
 cept as to timing. We say to the Rus-
 sians: "If you expect to continue these
 war-aiding imports from the U.S.A. and
 have a consular office over here with eco-
 nomic attaches drumming up new busi-
 ness and finding new imports which you
 would like to have, you are going to have
 to discontinue your shipments of war
 materials to Vietnam."
 This rocket situation is in point, as
 well as the fact that the North Vietnam
 Communists get all of their petroleum
 from Russia. If that supply can be re-
 duced it would shorten the war.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MUNDT. I yield.
 Mr. MANSFIELD, I would most re-
 spectfully disagree with my distinguished
 colleague. I do not believe his reserva-
 tion would shorten the war one day. I
 do not think it would save one Ameri-
 can life in Vietnam.  I feel that the
 adoption of the Senator's reservation
 would kill this treaty, and would thus
 remove from the 18,000 Americans
 that travel in the U.S.S.R. annually, the
 protections provided under this treaty.
 The question before the Senate on the
 convention is not the 500,000 men in
 Vietnam or in its immediate vicinity, but
 it is the 18,000 Americans within the
 Soviet Union who are subject to Soviet
 law in a closed society.
 Mr. MUNDT. The Senator from South
 Dakota would like to consider both
 groups of Americans. with special con-
 sideration however being given to the
 500,000 in uniform. I realize that the
 18,000 tourists also deserve protection.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Every American
 citizen deserves protection,
 Mr. MUNDT. The Senator is correct.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  But the Senator
 wants to bring in the question of exports
 from this country to the Soviet Union,
 and he has several times. That question
 has no connection with the convention
 before us, which is tied exclusively to
 only one stipulation, and that is the
 protection of Americans who will be trav-
 eling in the Soviet Union.
 The distinguished Senator from Texas
 I Mr. TowER I has mentioned that the
 Vietcong-not the North Vietnamese but
 the Vietcong-are using Russian made
 rockets in attacks on the Marine air base
 at Danang in the north.
 I think that American bombers and
 other types of planes are using American
 made bombs and other types of weapons
 in the north.  You have a two-way
 street, with the Soviet Union aiding a
 Socialist ally and the United States aid-
 ing a democratic ally in South Vietnam.
 Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. MUNDT. I yield.
 Mr. TOWER. I wish to point out that
 I do not think the two situations are at
 all analogous. Let us remember that
 the United States does not choose this
 war as an instrument of national policy.
 We have been involved in four wars in
 this century, none of which we started,
 none of which we were prepared for, and
 each  of  which  we  entered  into
 reluctantly.
 Today in southeast Asia we are trying
 to bring an end to the war by convincing
 thole who do adopt war as an instrument
 of national policy that war is too costly
 an implement of national policy to
 further employ. That is why we are
 there. We did not start this war; they
 d;d. L^t them, by some overt act show
 us that they are prepared to reject war
 as an instrument of national policy;
 then, we can, perhaps, start building
 bridles of friendship, and I shall be the
 first to advocate it.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MUNDT. I yield.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. The distinguished
 Senator from Texas mentioned the pos-
 sibility, and I assume he was referring
 to the pending reservation, about "end-
 ing" the war shortly-and I put the word
 "ending" in quotation marks.
 The distinguished Senator from South
 Dakota has also said more or less that
 the adoption of his reservation could
 possibly bring about a shortening of the
 war.
 I -,nn not a military expert. I was only
 a seaman second class in the Navy, a
 private in the Army, and a PFC in the
 Marines, but I do have a pretty active in-
 terest in the Far East and southeast Asia
 based on spending some time out there,
 based on being a professor of history, if
 I may use that term without being
 lynched-,and I see one of my fellow pro-
 fessors rising-
 M-. TOWER.  If there is to be a
 lynching party with the distinguished
 majority leader, I believe that it would
 have to include me, because I was a pro-
 fesscr of political science.
 Mr. MUNDT, Let us not discuss the
 lynching of college professors, because
 then I would get myself involved as well,
 [Laughter.]
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I withdraw the
 reference.
 Mr. President, it is my belief that those
 who think there is a cheap or easy way
 to bring an end to the war in Vietnam
 are 'eery much mistaken.
 It is true that we cannot and will not
 be defeated militarily. We will not with-
 draw. We will make every effort to bring
 this situation to an honorable conclu-
 sion. But, until that negotiating table
 March 15, 1'967
 is reached, we have a long, hard row
 ahead of us in South Vietnam alone.
 What we shall see-and I believe and I
 know that my remarks will be taken in
 the proper spirit because I am not an
 expert-will be a reversion from phase
 3 of Mao Tse-tung's handbook on war
 to ph:ise 2, which will mean a return to
 guerrilla tactics and a slcwdown in the
 use of organizational uniti of any great
 size.
 But there are discussion., now-and all
 my information is obtained from the
 press--to the effect that we are con-
 templating a move into the Mekong
 Delta. I believe that articles appeared
 in the press which stated that elements
 of the 9th Infantry have )een sent into
 the Mekong Delta area. If I am not
 mistaken, the identificatijn was made
 becau:;e of a statement made by the
 distinguished Senator from Texas a
 month or so ago.
 Mr. TOWER. If the Senator from
 Montf.na will yield at that point-
 Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield.
 Mr. TOWER. No; that was conjec-
 ture on the part of the New York Times.
 At that moment, the 9th Division was not
 established in the Delta. It was simply
 announced that I would visit the 9th
 Division and would also visit the Mekong
 Delta, and the New York ''imes put two
 and two together. I did not know my-
 self woere the 9th Division was at the
 time. I doubt that we are contemplat-
 ing going into the Delta. We are there,
 sir. 'The U.S. Navy has been there for
 some time patrolling the river. I can
 speak with only slightly more knowledge
 than the Senator from Montana in that
 I am F. mate, bo'sun's third Class, in the
 U.S. Navy Reserve.
 Mr. MUNDT. If I may interpolate
 there, for those who read the RECORD, the
 distinguished Senator from Texas has
 just about 1 week ago returned from
 Vietnam where he spent-how much
 time?
 Mr. TOWER. One month in south-
 east A:;ia.
 Mr. MUNDT. How long was the
 Senator in Vietnam?
 Mr. TOWER. Six days.
 Mr. 1UNDT. Six days, looking at the
 situation firsthand around him. With-
 in the last week, I heard the Senator
 make .a very fine address on his observa-
 tions there. They were most pertinent
 and informative, so that the Senator
 does speak with recent, firsthand knowl-
 edge o' thesituation in Vietnam.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. I would underscore
 that. The Senator from Texas has spent
 several weeks in Vietnam and this is
 only one of many trips which he has
 made. However, I want to point out
 that all my information comes from the
 public prints, that in an incirect way the
 Senator from Texas was involved in my
 knowledge of the facts-and it is true-
 namely, that there are elements of the
 9th Infantry in the Mekong Delta. They
 were sent there around the latter part
 of 1966 or the first part of this year. It
 is my belief that those elements have
 been increased in recent days and that
 there are Navy boats patrolling the rivers
 and other waterways in the Mekong
 Delta; that if we are going to go into
 that area, it will be much more difficult

 Under those regulations, the secretary of
 state each year must give reasons for any
 travel ban.
 A full statement of the department's rea-
 sons for maintaining current restrictions will
 be listed in the Federal Register tomorrow,
 but Bartch summed up by saying travel was
 banned to North Vietnam because of armed
 hostilities there, and to North Korea, Cuba
 and Red China because "unrestricted travel
 to those countries would seriously impair the
 conduct of U.S. foreign affairs."
 In practice, newsmen have had no diffi-
 culty having their passports approved for
 travel to restricted area,  But except in rare
 instances, they have had great difficulty
 getting- visas from those countries. In the
 last year, the department also has permitted
 scholars and others with legitimate reasons
 for travel to have their passports authorized.
 Tiny Albania, an enclave in Eastern Eu-
 rope, has been Communist since 1945 and
 has not had diplomatic relations with the
 United States since 1948. It is isolated be-
 cause it has very poor relations with neigh-
 boring Yugoslavia and in 1961 broke relations
 with the Soviet Union.  It is Red China's
 closest ally in the world and relies on Peking
 to a great extent for economic aid.
 Bartch would not elaborate on reasons for
 maintaining the restrictions on travel to the
 other countries, saying, it Is "spelled out" in

 more charitable and a more clear-cut
 purpose of trying to achieve peace than
 that program of the President? To the
 people of South Vietnam up to the end
 of 1964 the United States has provided
 $2.1 billion of economic aid.
 I do not claim that everything our
 country does is right, but I do say, in the
 words of Decatur:
 Our country! In her intercourse with for-
 eign nations may she always be in the right;
 but our country, right or wrong!
 The war is going on. Ho Chi Minh
 refuses to go to the negotiating table.
 Let us take a look at what might have
 been some of the reasons why he refuses
 to go to the negotiating table. In this
 Chamber-and I am not saying that
 the Senator from Tennessee made this
 statement-statements have been made
 that our country is the aggressor. I
 wish to repeat what I said 20 minutes
 ago: that the only agency that made an
 investigation of the true facts in South
 Vietnam reported that North Vietnam
 sent in its infiltrators and subversive
 operators to create violence in South
 Vietnam.
 The Legal Committee of the Interna-
 tional Control Commission consisting of
 representatives of the governments of
 Canada, Poland and India in 1962 in-
 vestigated and reported:
 There is evidence to show that arms,
 armed and unarmed personnel, munitions
 and other supplies have been sent from the
 Zone in the North to the Zone in the South
 with the objective of supporting, organizing
 and carrying out hostile activities, including
 armed attacks, directed against the Armed
 Forces and Administration of the Zone in
 the South.
 There is evidence that the PAVN (People's
 Army of Viet Nam) has allowed the Zone
 in the North to be used for inciting, en-
 couraging and supporting hostile activities
 in the Zone in the South, aimed at the
 overthrow of the Administration in the
 South.
 Second. The statement was made,
 either on the floor of the Senate or in
 other places, that the United States has
 made prostitutes out of the women of
 South Vietnam. What does the world
 conclude when words of that character
 come from high ehcelon officials of the
 U.S. Government?
 Third, Statements have been made
 that the United States desires to estab-
 lish colonial domination over South
 Vietnam so as to exploit its human
 beings and its mineral resources. What
 good can South Vietnam do for the
 United States economically? Not a sin-
 gle bit of good. Yet, those are the words
 that have come out of this Chamber.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Mc-
 INTYRE in the chair). The time of the
 Senator has expired.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that I may proceed
 for 5 additional minutes.
 Mr. SPARKMAN,  Mr. President, I
 yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.
 Mr. LAUSCHE. Fourth. The charge
 has been made the United States is in-
 dulging in terrorism, taking the lives of
 innocent men, women, and children of
 South Vietnam. The statement was just
 made that the United States, by mistake,
 has destroyed the homes of innocent peo-
 ple in South Vietnam. That statement
 is true. But never can it be said that the
 United States by design, by plan, or by
 deliberation has taken the life of a single
 person, as far as I can understand, in
 South Vietnam.
 North Vietnam, through its Ho Chi
 Minh troops and through the Vietcong,
 has adopted a plan to deliberately and
 designedly maim people and kill them.
 Yet the charge is made that the United
 States is the country that is promoting
 terrorism. I cannot stand by and listen
 to that type of argument without raising
 my voice.
 Fifth. The argument is made that the
 United States is demanding uncondition-
 al surrender and that, therefore, Ho Chi
 Minh cannot go to the negotiating table.
 Let us take a look at the facts. Five
 times we have paused in the bombing,
 once for 37 days. On each occasion we
 continued the pause as an indication of
 our purpose to negotiate. On every oc-
 casion Ho Chi Minh adamantly stood by
 and never yielded for a moment. Our
 Government said, "We will quit the
 bombing; all we ask you to do, Ho Chi
 Minh, is to quit sending troops and mili-
 tary equipment into the South. If we
 quit bombing, we do not want you to use
 your military equipment to take the lives
 of American boys." Even that argument
 has fallen upon deaf ears.
 Mr. President, my only purpose in
 making this presentation is to give ex-
 pression to my honest judgment and not
 to stand silent while my country is being
 blackened and that of the Communists is
 being whitened. I would not be at ease
 at the end of the day if by silence I in-
 dicated my acquiescence in the denuncia-
 tions that are repeatedly being made
 about what our country has tried to do.
 We have sent, as I recall, more than
 $1 billion into South Vietnam, priln.ar-
 ily to help those people. I wish to men-
 tion one further fact, and I would be
 delinquent if I did not do so.
 Several months ago the statement was
 made that our Government was dressing
 its agents in Communist uniforms, and
 telling those agents to go out and rape
 South Vietnamese women and kill their
 men and their children for the purpose
 of putting the blame on the Communists.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. The
 time of the Senator has expired.
 Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield 2 additional minutes
 to me?
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr.
 President, I yield 3 additional minute. to
 the Senator from Ohio.
 Mr. LAUSCHE. I thank the Senator.
 Mr. President, that statement was
 picked up by Peking and Moscow and
 spread all over the world that a Member

 them on the floor of the Senate.
 I hold my friend the Senator from
 Tennessee [Mr. GoRE] in the highest
 respect. I recognize that he is attempt-
 ing to reach some avenue through which
 we may procure peace. I know that he
 understands, likewise, that I am seeking
 that same avenue.
 Mr. GORE. Mr. President, will the
 Senator from Ohio yield?
 Mr. LAUSCHE. I yield.
 Mr. GORE. I thank the Senator for
 his generous references. Perhaps if this
 exchange has served no other purpose,
 it has illustrated that both of us hold
 sincere views and that there is a great
 similarity, considering the objective and
 goal we have in mind.
 Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, I yield
 myself 3 minutes. Then I shall yield to
 the distinguished Senator from Texas,
 who wishes to make an address in con-
 nection with the pending reservation.
 We have been for the last hour lis-
 tening to an interesting colloquy, en-
 gaged in by three of my fellow members
 of the Committee on Foreign Relations
 who represent the Democratic Party.
 The division of opinion that has been
 manifested by them, the divided unity
 which exists, the acrimony, the criticism,
 and the uncertainty which have been
 expressing, all by able, diligent, and
 loyal Democratic members of the com-
 mittee, are, in my opinion most signifi-
 cant signs of our times. But they are
 going to shrink into insignificance com-
 pared with the growing division of
 opinion throughout the country, among
 the people generally, among the parents
 of the boys in Vietnam and of the young
 men and women who confront the pos-
 sibility of service there, and among the
 populace generally, if we do nothing dif-
 ferent, in the whole war picture in
 Vietnam from continuing the same
 monotonous, bloody formula in which we
 have been engaged, with comparative
 futility, for 5 long years.
 What is that formula? Draft boys,
 Draft men. Send them to fight in Viet-
 nam. Send strategic materials and sup-
 plies to Russia. Send over 400 items,
 different in nature, to Russia to relieve
 its consumer economy,&nd to strengthen
 its industrial complex. Do nothing to
 discourage the Russians from sending
 to Vietnam all of the modern weapons re-
 quired to kill the boys whom we draft and
 send there, and to continue to escalate
 our casualty lists. In the main, that has
 been the formula, at least for the last
 3 years, and increasingly since Oc-
 tober 12 when the President by Exec-
 utive order expanded our shipments of
 supplies to step up the capacity of Russia
 to supply additional armaments to our
 enemy in Vietnam. So I think we must
 try something different.

 where the punishment received by the
 North Vietnamese is probably not so
 large as the economic and military input
 they are receiving from their allies in
 Russia and China. But he is right when
 he says that a signal for peace could
 come from Moscow. This reservation
 might help promote that signal, because
 if this reservation should be attached, all
 we would need to shorten the war would
 be one telephone call from the men in
 charge of the Kremlin to the men in
 charge of the war in Hanoi. It could go
 something like this, to put It In Ameri-
 can laymen's language:
 "Hello, Ho. This is Kosygin talking.
 We are having a little trouble with our
 American friends. We are also having a
 lot of trouble keeping up our economy
 and manufacturing products as fast as
 we should like to. We must continue to
 get imports from the United States if we
 are going to utilize them in our econ-
 omy and be able to supply you with the
 weapons you need in this war. Now we
 are all for you, please be assured, but
 self-preservation is the first law of na-
 tions, Ho. You know that. So we are
 going to have to taper off with our war
 supplies to you. As a matter of fact, we
 are going to have to cut them off entirely,
 We are breaking this news to you gently.
 Make the best deal you can and move
 soon because we are no longer going to
 be your arsenal for war supplies."
 Mr. President, that is the kind of sig-
 nal for peace that could come out of
 Moscow, evolving from this kind of reser-
 vation. That is the kind of signal for
 peace which would be effective and bring
 Ho Chi Minh to the negotiating table
 mighty fast. I hope that we do not miss
 the opportunity to advise the State De-
 partment of this experiment which we
 would like to have them undertake, with
 no possibility of hurting anyone but with
 a great possibility of shortening the war
 in Vietnam.
 Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, would
 the Senator from South Dakota yield?
 Mr. MUNDT. I yield.
 Mr. TOWER It has been said that
 the Soviet Union has to supply aid to
 Ho Chi Minh so that Moscow can keep up
 its rivalry with Peking for Influence in
 Hanoi. But, does it not occur to the
 Senator from South Dakota, regardless
 of how much help the Soviet Union sends
 to Hanoi, that the dominant Influence
 there politically is now and by nature of
 things will be in the future Pekingese and
 not Muscovite?
 Mr. MUNDT. Of course it will, be-
 cause of the situation of geography, be-
 cause of race, and because of culture.
 That is inevitable.
 Mr. TOWER. Does it not occur to the
 Senator from South Dakota that the So-
 viets are aware of this and that, there-
 fore, the only reasoning they could have
 is that perhaps they want to keep the
 United States bogged down and involved,
 wasting men, materiel and money in
 pursuing the war in southeast Asia?
 Mr. MUNDT.  There is no question
 about it.  What is it costing the Rus-
 s.ans:?  They are short of many Indus-
 trial supplies but they are getting them
 from this country and Hanoi thus gets
 the arms it needs-via the Soviet Union-
 the arms will then eventually be used
 against our American troops in Vietnam.
 There are 400 different items we now
 make available to Communist Russia,
 some of them on credit. There is, for ex-
 ample, this new automobile factory which
 is going to be set up in Russia, under Fiat
 management from Italy, in part with
 money borrowed from our American Ex-
 port-Import Bank. Some of our exports
 will be exchanged for Russian imports
 which will drive down American raw
 material prices In our own economy, such
 as timber and fur's, the Importation of
 which will add to the price distress In
 this country for those products.
 What are we really doing to induce
 the North Vietnamese Communists to
 come to the peace table?
 Ho Chi Minh has a very good formula
 operating for him. Let us put ourselves
 in Ho Chi Minh's place, and we wonder
 why he has not answered any of the 36
 suggestions for peace negotiation which
 President Johnson states he has sent out
 to him?
 I believe that President Johnson Is
 telling the truth on this report of his
 repeated calls for peace.
 Will someone please indicate what we
 would have to do to make Ho Chi Minh
 come to the conference table, when the
 means of shipping him petroleum and
 materiel of war are shipped to him free
 from Moscow? This is good for Ho.
 He Impresses Into service many of the
 soldiers for his army who are not even
 for him. He picks them up In the north.
 He takes them away from the peasants
 in the Delta area of the south. He has
 something pretty good going for him
 there, He is safe and free from bomb-
 ing.  His people are not subject to the
 kind of bombing that the people of Ber-
 lin, Munich, and other German cities got.
 Ho tells his people, "Don't worry. You
 are not going to get bombed as the peo-
 ple of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were In
 Japan."
 We have got to induce him In some way
 to come to the conference table. We
 cannot do it unless we do something dif-
 ferent from what we have been doing
 these past 5 war torn years. Lyndon
 Johnson could not do it in 36 tries. I
 say that Kosygin can do It in one effort
 with one telephone call: "Hello, Ho.
 The deal Is all over, Ho. We have gotten
 ourselves in a bad spot.  Our people
 want a little bit more of those consumer
 goods. They have had a taste of it and
 we cannot continue to utilize our labor
 force, our materials and our machinery,
 to continue sending you all these war
 supplies. We are going to have to dis-
 continue our assistance. Good luck, Ho,
 old fellow, but count us out."
 We stand a chance to get the war
 pier In that way If our President and
 his diplomats will use this reservation
 as a device for influencing Russia to
 cease its effective program of prolong-
 ing the Vietnamese war.  That could
 shorten the war, Mr. President.  That
 N% III shorten it, In my opinion. President
 Johnson, having failed 36 times in try-
 ing for peace under prevailing conditions,
 I suggest the Senate make at least this
 one attempt of its own to open up a new
 approach to peace.
 The President can try for the 37th,
 the 38th, or the 39th time, but it is a
 maladroit system to seek peace by call-
 ing upon our enemy to come to the con-
 ferertce table while he thinks he is win-
 ning
 The other way I have just described
 seems to be a lot more realistic, positive,
 prac,ical, and workable procedure since
 It w1l convince our enemy he cannot
 win because his war supplies from Rus-
 sia have been shut off.
 I think that Senators should vote to
 Insist that we give our boys and our
 country that opportunity for peace and
 not deny it by saying, "No, we will just
 use the same old routine which, after 5
 year.), and 36 Presidential pleas, and
 50,000 casualties, has brought no pros-
 pects for peace."
 Today, the majority leader stated that
 the war in Vietnam could go on for many,
 many years.  I am afraid he may be
 right. This reservation, however, pro-
 vides a realistic opportunity to end it.
 Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, if in fact,
 the ratification of this Consular Pact
 could be that illusive first step towards
 an ?nd to our differences with the So-
 viets, that step which some felt was
 taken when administration-pressured,
 massive wheat shipments to Russia were
 agreed to, or again when we ratified the
 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, or more re-
 cently, when by Executive order of Octo-
 ber 12, 1966, the shipment of some 400
 new types of exports to Russia was au-
 thorized, if there were any concrete in-
 dication this could be that first step to-
 wards world peace, then I would take it
 unhesitatingly. But let us consider the
 facts.
 Recent efforts by Sovie=t Russia to un-
 derraine freedom, in particular in Viet-
 narn, need little documentation; they
 are well known to us all. Propaganda-
 wise, we are today labeled by the U.S.S.R.
 as an aggressor nation, World opinion
 mobilization against us Is an ever cur-
 rent Soviet tactic. Massive shipments
 by Russia of arms and ammunition and
 all manner of military supplies now
 going Into the North Vietnamese hands,
 are being deployed against our American
 and Allied troops this very moment.
 Mr. President, if ratification were in-
 deed that first step towards peace, the
 fact that the Soviets have generally
 never hesitated to disregard any or all
 pars of our agreements with them, when
 It was to their benefit to do so, might be
 overlooked.
 L'et us overlook almost all, Mr. Presi-
 dent, if the adoption of this measure
 would end present hostilities. Or if we
 were yet in that cold was period, perhaps
 this treaty ratification would be in the
 best. interests of world peace.
 But from everything we can see, this
 is' not that first step, and most certainly
 we are no longer in that cold war era.
 This is an extremely hot war era. The
 greatest number of American casualties
 suffered thus far in Vietnam in any
 7-diy period, occurred just last week.
 The January 12, 1967, issue of the Re-
 por~er contained a very interesting and
 enlightening article by Albert Parry en-
 titled "Soviet Aid to Vietnam."
 The article made specific reference to
 reports by a Soviet newsman and pic-
 tures taken by Soviet camermen who
 recently accompanied Vietcong guerrilla

 units operating within 35 miles of
 Saigon.
 It is from reports like these-
 Said Parry-
 that we get an impression of the growing
 Russian presence in Vietnam. The picture
 can be filled out by bits and pieces of infor-
 mation, some casual and scattered, yet sig-
 nificant, and the Soviet and other East Eu-
 ropean. press; the monitored texts of the sur-
 prisingly frequent broadcasts on the subject
 emanating from sundry East European radio
 stations; and the reports on the topics reach-
 ing us from a wide range of non-Communist
 diplomats, soldiers, seamen, newsmen, trav-
 elers, and other observers in Southeast Asia.
 And one thing is clear: the Russians are
 stepping up their aid to Vietnam.
 Despite the sheer, logistics involved,
 the Russians are shipping tons and tons
 of military supplies via the 7,500-mile
 sea lanes from Eastern Europe, The
 Soviets themselves claimed not long ago
 that more than half the vessels entering
 the harbor of Haiphong were ships of
 Soviet registry.
 I know, Mr. President, that on the day
 I left the fleet in the Gulf of Tonkin,
 where I was a visitor aboard the aircraft
 carrier Kitty Hawk some 4 weeks ago,
 there were 12 ships in Haiphong, one of
 which was of Hong Kong registry one of
 which was of Chinese registry, and 10 of
 which were of Soviet registry.
 Quoting further from the Reporter
 article, "Odessa-Mamma," as the Rus-
 sians fondly call the port, "is the fore-
 most source of all this traffic. An Eng-
 lish-language broadcast from Moscow to
 southern Asia on December 23, 1965,
 exulted :
 Odessa is the biggest port on the Black Sea.
 Its busiest route is the one leading to Hai-
 phong. A constant caravan of big merchant
 ships is plying this lane.
 Continuing with the article:
 In March 1966, in reply to Chinese charges
 that the Soviet help to Hanoi was all too
 scant, the Moscow leaders sent a confidential
 letter to all fraternal Communist parties.
 Carefully leaked out to the world at large
 via the East German Communists (who sent
 copies to their connections in Bonn), the let-
 ter stressed that in 1965 North Vietnam re-
 ceived from the Soviet Union arms and mili-
 tary equipment worth half a billion rubles
 ($555 million). The list included rocket in-
 stallations and conventional anti-aircraft
 guns, MIGS and other planes, and tanks,
 coastal artillery, and small warships.
 Since the fall of 1965, the number of con-
 ventional anti-aircraft guns in North Viet-
 nam has risen from fifteen hundred to at
 least five thousand; one unofficial estimate in
 Washington  puts  the  figure  at  seven
 thousand.
 Mr. President, I note at this point that
 North Vietnam has the most sophisti-
 cated air defense that any of our pilots
 has ever seen.
 I continue to read:
 In the fall of 1965 there were only four
 North Vietnamese batteries firing SAMS. By
 early October, 1966, this number had risen
 to twenty-five or thirty, each with six
 launchers.  There were then some 130 sites
 from which the batteries could operate;
 twenty per cent were occupied and active in
 any given time.
 Mr. President, the Soviets are not
 merely supplying arms, ammunition and
 other equipment,  Extensive training
 programs within Russia both for North
 Vietnamese civilians and military per-
 sonnel are an integral part of Soviet
 assistance, in addition to extensive tech-
 nical assistance by Russian experts domi-
 ciled in North Vietnam.
 I continue to read:
 The sheer numerical record is impressive.
 ... On March 15,  1966, Radio Moscow
 boasted that at that time nearly three thou-
 sand young Vietnamese men and women were
 studying in the Soviet Union, and that while
 a total of 2,300 Soviet experts worked in
 North Vietnam in the years 1955-1964, some
 4,500 Vietnamese experts had been trained
 in the Soviet colleges and universities by the
 spring of 1966.
 The most significant case in training in-
 volves the North Vietnamese air cadets now
 being taught by Soviet Air Force veterans
 to fly supersonic MIG-21 jets.
 The Mig-21 is the hottest interceptor
 that the Soviets have. As a matter of
 fact, it is a very, very fine intercepter,
 and one that our own aircraft and our
 own 'pilots have great difficulty in deal-
 ing with.
 I continue to read:
 One group of cadets succeeds another at
 graduation ceremonies ... .
 ... In mid-December western intelligence
 raised its unofficial estimate of the number
 of MIGS in Vietnam to 180 or even 200, the
 latest being some delta-winged MIG--21Cs
 and -2lDs.
 Mr. President, other Communist na-
 tions besides Russia, of course, are aid-
 ing North Vietnam, with certainly it lot
 of urging, advice, and assistance from
 the Soviets.
 I continue to read:
 Of the "people's democracies" contributing
 to Ho Chi Minh today, East Germany is
 probably the most active. Military aid .. .
 includes arms and electronic equipment
 especially made to stand up in tropical
 weather; also motorcycles and bicycles, so
 important for messenger service on North
 Vietnam's war-torn roads where automobiles
 cannot get through easily ....
 I point out that bicycles are a very im-
 portant war item for the North Viet-
 namese.
 By extending the handlebar and plac-
 ing a pole behind the seat and push-
 ing it along the road, a North Vietnamese
 can carry 500 pounds of rice. It does
 not take very long to figure how many
 bicycles it will take to move a ton of
 rice down the Ho Chi Minh trail.
 I continue to read:
 The major part of Ho Chi Minh's medical
 supplies seems to come from East Germany,
 and a hundred East German doctors are
 reported to be serving In North Vietnam.
 In addition to the eight hundred Russians
 reportedly already present in North Vietnam
 on air-defense missions, some East German
 officers and men are rumored to be em-
 ployed in North Vietnam's missile training.
 In goods and capital aid not directly of the
 war-materiel kind, Ulbricht's government is
 thought to have delivered to Ho Chi Minh
 from June 1965 to October 1966, a total of
 $4 million worth.... Besides, regular com-
 merce between East Germany and North
 Vietnam amounts to over a million dollars
 a year, consisting mostly of industrial wares
 going to North Vietnam and some food, and
 consumer goods being sent to East Germany.
 It is really interesting to note that
 with all of the hue and cry from some of
 our professional bleeding hearts in this
 S 3847
 country concerning how we are treating
 the North Vietnamese, it is interesting
 to note how the North Vietnamese are
 treating their own people.
 They do not have enough food to eat,
 and yet they export their food in ex-
 change for war material. I wonder why
 the bleeding hearts do not jump on
 them.
 I continue to read:
 But the bloc's largest economic aid to
 and trade with Hanoi is, of course, extended
 by the Soviet Union. Gathered at a summit
 meeting in Moscow in mid-October 1966, the
 Soviet Union and its eight allies agreed to
 give about $1*billion worth of additional
 help to Hanoi in materiel 'and money, of
 which $800 million is' to come from the
 U.S.S.R.  The  others'  contributions  are
 typified by the Polish pledge of $30 million.
 ... Although precise figures are difficult
 to obtain, it is estimated that in the ten
 years through 1964, Soviet economic aid to
 North Vietnam totaled some $350 million....
 Moscow's exports to North Vietnam rose
 from $47.6 million in 1964 to more than $74.8
 million in 1965-this of course in addition
 to some $555 million worth of arms sent in
 1965 alone....
 In its German-language broadcast to Ger-
 many on June 21, 1965, Radio Moscow de-
 clared that of the funds that North Vietnam
 was then getting from socialist countries
 (including China), nearly half came from
 the Soviet Union. A third of this Soviet aid,
 the broadcast said, was given free of charge.
 Some fifty industrial enterprises had by then
 been built or rebuilt with Soviet technical
 aid.  Such Soviet-assisted plants produced
 ... about ninety per cent of its coal and
 more than half of its machine tools.  The
 country's power, mining, engineering, and
 technical industries. were all helped or run
 by the Russian donors and advisers.
 From other Soviet sources we learn that
 the economic division of the Soviet embassy
 in Hanoi is in charge of all this aid.... An
 economist staff member (of the Soviet em-
 bassy) supervises Soviet engineers and other
 experts who serve in the expansion of the
 Haiphong port, at the Hanoi machine-tool
 works, in the construction of a large re-
 frigerating plant, at an electrical-supply
 factory, and at the coffee and tea planta-
 tions.  It is claimed that the machine-tool
 plant, covering fourteen acres, is entirely
 fitted out with Soviet equipment.
 I am hopeful that that machine-tool
 plant is one of the targets earmarked for
 destruction by our gallant Air Force.
 I continue to read:
 Another staff member of the Embassy's
 economic division is in charge of other Soviet
 engineering crews busy in North Vietnam's
 mines,  geological  exploration  for  more
 minerals and metals, and projects aimed at
 the expansion of certain of the country's
 large industrial enterprises, .. .
 The nation we are asked to sign this
 treaty with, Mr. President, is that nation,
 Soviet Russia, which has it within her
 power to end that war which has been
 responsible for the deaths of over 7,000
 Americans and for the infliction of over
 47,000 American casualties.
 Let the Soviet Union bring North Viet-
 nam to the conference table; let the So-
 viets discontinue their shipment of tons
 and tons of military supplies into North
 Vietnam and then let us consider this
 ratification.
 In the colloquy between the distin-
 guished Senator from South Dakota and
 me a few minutes ago, it was noted that
 what we are saying here is that we are

 not trying to preclude the establishment
 of bridges between East and West.
 What we are trying to do here is
 simply to say: "By some overt deed or
 act, show us that you reject war as an
 instrument of national policy. Show us
 that you will not foment the takeover
 of government by military means."
 If they want to sell communism on its
 own merits, I have no objection, because
 I do not think they can do so in any
 country that is relatively progressive and
 prosperous.
 Indeed, there has been no establish-
 ment of Communist governments in this
 world without resort to military force.
 I understand that some people in this
 country are concerned because the gov-
 ernment in South Vietnam is not a popu-
 larly elected government in the sense
 that we understand popularly elected
 government.
 I point out that there are no govern-
 ments behind the Iron Curtain that are
 elected in the sense that we understand
 an elected government, either.
 Mr. President, the opinion has been ex-
 pressed, and rightly so, that we should
 be concerned with the protection and
 well-being of American tourists travel-
 ing in Russia, The opinion has alsobeen
 expressed by many that vastly increased
 East-West trade will help bring an end
 to present differences.
 Perhaps so, perhaps not.  As I have
 pointed out, the Soviets will likely con-
 tinue to harass, mistreat, even arrest
 and imprison our citizens whenever It
 suits Soviet propaganda purposes.  In
 that connection, it is a little amusing that
 we are reluctant to allow Stalin's daugh-
 ter to seek political asylum in this coun-
 try because we are afraid it would upset
 our delicate relations with the Soviet
 Union.  If some member of a highly
 placed American family defected to the
 Soviet Union, does anyone think the
 Russians would waste any time in parad-
 ing that person in Red Square and mak-
 ing all possible propaganda capital out
 of the situation? Who is really serious
 about reducing tensions in the world?
 Arid there is no assurance that in-
 creased trade will ease tensions.
 While I am extremely concerned, as
 we all are, about the safety of our tour-
 ists, I believe that our primary concern
 should be for those American and South
 Vietnamese personnel and other Allied
 servicemen-the gallant Australians, the
 courageous Koreans, New Zealanders,
 and others-who are daily risking their
 lives in the cause of freedom, in order
 that Vietnam and other southeast Asia
 nations may determine by themselves,
 and for themselves, the form of govern-
 ment they and their peoples desire.
 First things first, Mr. President. As
 I have stated, let Soviet Russia help
 bring this war in Vietnam to an end. Let
 them bring an end to the loss of Ameri-
 can and allied lives. Let there be some
 tangible, meaningful move toward peace
 by the Soviets. Then let us consider this
 treaty.
 My able and distinguished colleague,
 the Senator from South Dakota, has of-
 fered a reservation to deter implementa-
 tion of the Consular Pact until peace or,
 in effect, concrete moves toward peace
 in Vietnam are forthcoming,  It is a
 wise reservation, and I strongly urge its
 adoption.
 If It were adopted, I believe I could
 reconsider my opposition to the ratifica-
 tion of this treaty. But unless this res-
 erv ation is adopted, I cannot reconsider
 my opposition to the ratification of the
 treaty.
 I cannot see why our gestures of
 friendship toward the Communist coun-
 tries must always be unilateral. Can we
 not. ask something in return? I do not
 believe it is too much to ask: "Stop kill-
 ing our people with your weapons. Stop
 killing the people of South Vietnam with
 your weapons. Reject war as an Instru-
 ment of national policy." The day the
 Communists reject war as an instrument
 of national policy, then we will In our
 tine see no war, and perhaps we will see
 no war for generations to come.
 Let us remember who started the war.
 Plainly, we are not the aggressor.
 I listened to some debate today with
 respect to whether or not we are the
 aggressor. The clandestine Infrastruc-
 ture for the conduct of war in South
 Vietnam was created by Ho Chi Minh,
 with the aid of Peking, before the French
 had left southeast Asia. Do not think
 for one moment that everybody who
 opposed the French now opposes the
 established government In South Viet-
 nam. I have been in the field with
 Vietnamese soldiers who won their battle
 spurs fighting against the French. They
 fought against the French because they
 wanted to create in Vietnam a climate in
 which they could determine and plot
 their own lives and their own destinies
 without outside interference. This they
 cannot do if & clandestine infrastructure,
 armed, possessed of main force units to
 fight, brings the people under complete
 subjugation. Then there will be no pop-
 ular decisions. Then everything will be

 Let us in the Senate say today to the
 Soviet Union: "We desperately want to
 establish these bridges with you. But
 before we do so, give us some justifica-
 tion. Show us a little good faith. We
 will overlook the 50-some-odd treaty and
 convention commitments that you have
 breached with us. We will overlook
 the misrepresentations, the scrap paper
 treatment that you have given us in our
 sacred commitments to each other, if
 you will simply, by an overt act, show
 us that you desire to see a world at
 peace."
 Mr. President, I suggest the absence

 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, If I
 may have the attention of the Senate.
 March 15, 1967
 I am about to make a unanimous-consent
 request.
 I ask unanimous consent that, im-
 mediately following the disposition of
 the Mundt reservation No. 2, the reserva-
 tion to be proposed by the distinguished
 Senator from Nebraska [Mr. CURTIS] be
 made the pending business; that there
 be a time limitation of 1 hour, the time
 to be equally divided between the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Nebraska [Mr.
 CURTIS], and the chairman of the Com-
 mittee on Foreign Relations [Mr. FUL-
 BRIGHT], or whomever he or they may
 designate.
 Mi. MUNDT. Mr. President, I have
 spoken with Senator CURris, the author
 of the reservation. He shares with me
 the optimistic hope that my reservation
 will be adopted, in which event his reser-
 vation will be unnecessary. But if the
 fates go against us and my reservation
 is rejected, he will then offer his reserva-
 tion Immediately following; and if he
 can i ave that consideration, he is willing
 to get along with that amount of time,
 and we have no objection.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection to the request of the Senator
 from Montana? The Chair hears none,
 and it is so ordered.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 suggest the absence of a quorum.

 RESERVATION POINTS UP THE "TIMING PROBLEM"
 OF CONSULAR TREATY
 Mr. MILLER.  Mr. President, the
 pending reservation to the proposed Con-
 sular Treaty with the Soviet Union pro-
 vides that there will be no exchange of
 instruments-in other words, that the
 treaty will not take effect-until the
 President of the United States deter-
 mines and advises the Congress as fol-
 lows: First, either that it is no longer
 necessary for the United States to main-
 tain Its combat forces in South Viet-
 nam-which, for all practical purposes
 would mean that the war in Vietnam is
 over-or, second, that the withdrawal of
 our combat forces from South Vietnam is
 not being prevented or delayed because
 of military assistance furnished North
 Vietnam by the Soviet Union.
 It will, therefore, be seen that adop-
 tion of this reservation will not require
 renegotiation of the treaty with the So-
 viet Union, as would be the case of an
 amendment to the treaty, and that the
 only thing affected would be the time the
 treaty became operative.  Once the
 President determines and advises the
 Congress that either of the two situa-
 tions exists, the treaty would go into
 effect.
 This reservation points up what I be-
 lieve to be the principal problem with
 the treaty. Perhaps this problem can be
 made more clear by asking whether my
 colleagues would have voted for this
 treaty at the time of the Cuban missile
 crisis. I doubt that they would have,
 and the reason, of course, would have
 been that public opinion would have been
 incensed over such action at a time when
 the Soviet Union, directly or through its
 military assistance to Cuba, was posing a
 threat to the lives of many of our people.
 I respectfully suggest that there is - a
 great similarity to the timing of this
 resolution of ratification, with the So-
 viet Union furnishing over 95 percent of
 the petroleum and all of the sophisticated
 weapons used by North Vietnam against
 our troops and those of our allies. These
 weapons do not merely pose a threat, as
 was the case of the missiles in Cuba.
 They are actually killing and wounding
 our people; and the Soviet leaders have
 made it abundantly clear that they pro-
 pose to continue to make this assistance
 available so that the killing and wound-
 ing of our people will go on,
 While it is true that this is taking
 place 12,000 miles away, whereas Cuba is
 only 90 miles off our shores, I simply can-
 not see that the mileage has anything to
 do with the essential nature of the sit-
 uation. The timing of the proposed rati-
 fication is, in my judgment, very bad.
 What is the justification for ratifying
 this treaty? I believe the basic reason
 was given by Secretary of State :Rusk
 when he said, as shown on page 41 of
 the hearings record:
 I think it is also important for us to try to
 find those points at which we can put rela-
 tions on a more normal and peaceful basis
 wherever possible.
 I am aware that there are some who
 say that the main reason for the treaty
 is to insure some measure of protection
 to the 18,000 U.S. citizens who travel in
 the Soviet Union. And it is true that
 upon ratification of the treaty by both
 the U.S. Senate and by the Soviet Presi-
 dium these tourists would be assured of
 notification going to our representatives
 of their imprisonment and of some vis-
 itation privileges by our representa-
 tives-although the extent of these visit-
 ations is somewhat nebulous. On the
 other hand, testimony of the Secretary
 on page 8 of the hearings record reveals
 that only about eight of our visitors to
 the Soviet Union per year have been de-
 tained; and it is in this context, rather
 than in the context of the total of 18,000
 tourists, that I believe this feature of the
 treaty's ratification should be considered.
 Viewed in this light, it is apparent that
 the Secretary of State's point that we
 should put relations on a more normal
 and peaceful basis wherever possible
 looms as the principal and overriding
 reason for ratification.
 May I say that I believe all Members
 of the Senate concur that we should
 strive to have more normal and peaceful
 relations with the Soviet Union. But
 this does not mean that we should take
 this action at all times-during a Cuban
 missile crisis or during the war in Viet-
 nam. There is a time for action and
 there may be a time when action might
 well cause reactions contrary to our na-
 tional interest. The Secretary's point is
 well taken, but it does not at all meet the
 problem of the timing of ratification. It
 may be suggested that the timing is es-
 sential to our national security. I have
 checked this point out very carefully,
 Mr. President, and I can state without
 equivocation that whether this treaty is
 ratified now, 6 months from now, or
 2 years from now will not have any
 material effect on our national security.
 In other words, there is no urgency at all
 for the ratification of this treaty. In-
 deed, even if it were ratified, we have
 been told by the proponents that it might
 not be for years that consulates would be
 established. No one has yet come for-
 ward with any reason or reasons why
 this treaty must be ratified now rather
 than, say, a year from now.
 There has been much discussion about
 building bridges. I want it understood
 that I will not take a back seat to any
 Member of the Senate as far as concerns
 a desire to build the right bridges at the
 right time. I supported the cultural and
 scientific exchange program. I believe
 the exchange program, on a people-to-
 people basis, will provide a means for
 greater understanding between the peo-
 pies of our two countries. But at the
 same time that I say I will support
 building the right bridges at the right
 time, and it may well be that this par-
 ticular treaty is a bridge-I do not know
 whether it is or not; no one really knows;
 we can all recognize its pluses and
 minuses-but assuming it is- a bridge,
 that does not mean this is the time for
 it.
 I remember the time of the proposed
 ratification of the limited nuclear test
 ban treaty in 1963, when it was heralded
 as a shaft of light in the darkness, when
 it was heralded as a step forward. I
 said, at the time I made my speech, that
 I would support ratification, but no one
 knew whether it was a shaft of light in
 the darkness or whether it was a step
 backward or a step forward. It would
 be years before we would know.
 I invite the attention of the Senate to
 a statement I made within my statement
 on the nuclear test man treaty ratifica-
 tion, in which I was pointing out that
 it seemd to me the ratification of the
 limited nuclear test ban treaty under
 those circumstances constituted an ac-
 commodation. policy with the Soviet
 Union, whereas, in my judgment, history
 had shown that a policy of firmness was
 more effective than a policy of accom-
 modation. I said at that time:
 I could be wrong when I say that a policy
 of firmness is the one to' follow, rather than
 a policy of accommodation, and I hope I am.
 I do know that when we have followed a
 policy of firmness-as we did in Berlin and
 as we did during the briefly imposed Cuban
 blockade-it has worked. But if a majority
 of my colleagues in the Senate feel that we
 should follow a policy of accommodation
 and ratify the treaty without a meaningful
 first step by the Soviet Union first, then
 I will go along-with this clear understand-
 ing: I want to see a meaningful first step by
 the Soviet Union, clearly demonstrating a
 change in policy, before ratifying any amend-
 ments to this treaty or any other treaties
 with the Soviet Union affecting the security
 of our country.
 The distinguished senior Senator from
 Ohio [Mr. LAUSCHEI stood on this floor a
 few days ago and said, "I want someone
 to show me one step--one meaningful
 step-the Soviet Union has taken toward
 a detente," and I do-not think a single
 Senator rose to answer him.
 I repeat those words. Since the rati-
 fication of the limited nuclear test ban
 treaty I have not seen a single step. As
 a matter of-fact, I suggest our relations
 with the Soviet Union are worse today
 than they were at the time of the rati-
 fication of the limited nuclear test ban
 treaty.. And I suggest that our relations
 with the Soviet Union may well be worse
 a year from now if we ratify this treaty
 at this particular time, because a
 psychological propaganda war will be
 waged by the Communist world and
 adopted by the Soviet Union as a result
 of the ratification of the treaty. I sug-
 gest it will weaken our position in the
 eyes of our allies and many neutral na-
 tions in the world if we, in the face of
 what is happening in South Vietnam
 today, ratify this treaty at this particular
 time.
 There is another aspect to this ques-
 tion, and that Is its. impact on the morale
 of the over 400,000 men representing

 this country in Vietnam, not to mention
 the men from our allied countries. I
 know it is said that about 18,000 Ameri-
 can citizens travel in the Soviet Union
 each year. I recently received a letter
 from a friend who was there last year,
 He said during his trip through Russia
 the train on which he was riding had
 been stopped. His party had been taking
 pictures. He said that for a few minutes
 there was anxiety, because they knew
 they might be thrown into a Soviet
 prison and it might be weeks or months
 before anybody would know about it.
 He said :
 I hope you will see fit to vote for ratifica-
 tion of this treaty, so that these anxious
 moments will not be gone through by future
 tourists to the Soviet Union.
 I have already pointed out that only
 an average of six persons a year have ac-
 tually been detained, according to the
 Secretary of State.  I am concerned
 about the anxious moments of our tour-
 ists in the Soviet Union, but I am much
 more concerned about the anxious mo-
 ments and the morale of the more than
 400,000 troops fighting in South Vietnam,
 who were ordered to go there, who did
 not go there voluntarily as our tourists
 go voluntarily to the Soviet Union,
 Mr. President, when I left Vietnam a
 year ago, I said that after visiting the
 wounded in the hospitals and after talk-
 ing to the troop leaders who have to
 write the letters home to the wives or
 parents of the boys who will not be com-
 ing back-"If we are going to make any
 mistakes, let us make a few mistakes on
 their side." If there is going to be an
 error about whether this treaty should
 be ratified now or a year from now, let
 us make a mistake in favor of the troops
 in South Vietnam.
 There are some who say that the Soviet
 Union really wants to be the great cata-
 lyst for bringing peace to southeast Asia.
 Perhaps that is so. There may have been
 some statements to that effect.
 But there have certainly been some
 statements not to that effect, Mr. Kosy-
 gin stated very bluntly that the Soviet
 Union was going to continue to furnish
 all the military support necessary for
 North Vietnam, that they were going to
 support fully the defeat of the "Ameri-
 can imperialists" in South Vietnam.
 That does not sound to me as though
 they have any intentions of serving as a
 great peacemaking catalyst in the war
 in South Vietnam.
 I might also point out that the policy
 of the Soviet Union has been, for a num-
 ber of years, as announced at the time
 of Mr. Khrushchev's tenure in office,
 that the Soviet Union was going to wage
 an economic war with the United States,
 and it was going to win that economic
 war. Incidentally, they will continue to
 maintain military might, so that if nec-
 essary they can use military power to
 defeat us; but their first choice appar-
 ently is to defeat us on the economic
 front.
 I ask, Mr. President, when the United
 States-the "enemy" according to Mr.
 Khrushchev and his successors on the
 economic front-is spending $20 to $30
 billion a year on the war in Vietnam, with
 more than 400,000 of its finest men In
 South Vietnam, and the Soviet Union is
 spending only $1 or $2 billion, with none
 of As manpower being used, does it not
 seem that this is a pretty good trade off,
 as far as the Soviet Union is concerned?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. The
 Senator's 15 minutes have expired.
 Mr. MILLER. I yield myself an addi-
 tional 5 minutes, Mr. President.
 If in fact they are interested in defeat-
 ing the United States on the economic
 front, I would say they will gain an ad-
 vantage by continuing the war in Viet-
 nam, rather than serving as the great
 peacemaking catalyst to bring it to an
 end. To me it is deeds that count. and
 not words. If the Soviet Union really
 wants to bring the war in Vietnam to an
 end, the best way to do that is to cease
 and desist from supplying the 96 percent
 of the petroleum and all the sophisti-
 cated weapons to North Vietnam. There
 are many of our military leaders who ad-
 vise that if that were to happen, the war
 in Vietnam would come to a very quick
 end.
 I think that we might do well to recog-
 nize that this treaty is desired by the
 Soviet Union.  Statements have been
 made that the United States took the
 initiative on the treaty. We did take the
 initiative, but not on this particular
 treaty. We took the initiative on a con-
 sular treaty back in the Eisenhower
 years; but there was nothing said at that
 time about providing immunity from
 criminal prosecution of consular officers.
 On the contrary, we have the testimony
 in the record that this particular pro-
 vision of immunity from criminal prose-
 cution-the first ever to appear in a
 Consular Treaty-was inserted in this
 treaty during the negotiations at the in-
 stance of the Soviet Union, not at the
 instance of the United States. That is
 one very big reason why the Soviet Union
 wants this treaty.
 I say that if they want the treaty, they
 should let us see a meaningful step on
 their part to bring the war in Vietnam
 to an end. If they do not wish to take
 that meaningful first step, Mr. President,
 I suggest that we are not going to get very
 far in meeting the objectives set forth by
 Secretary of State Rusk; namely, that we
 put relations on a more normal and
 peaceful basis whenever possible. Every-
 one wants to put those relations on a
 more normal and peaceful basis, but that
 will not arise because of ratification of
 this treaty, if the Soviet Union is not will-
 ing to take some steps to bring the war
 in Vietnam to an end.
 There is much confusion in the coun-
 try, Mr. President, regarding this admin-
 istration's policy on Vietnam. I happen
 to be one of the many Senators, from
 both sides of the aisle, who have sup-
 ported that policy from its inception. I
 voted for the Tonkin Gulf resolution, and
 I believe I knew what I was voting for at
 that time, even though there are some
 among us who voted for it, who now say
 they did not know what they were doing.
 My guess is that most of us knew well
 what we were doing.
 But I am concerned that there Is an
 apparent misunderstanding around the
 country, on the part of a good many
 people, over our policy In South Vietnam,
 One reason might well 1:  inconsistent
 actions and statements on the j X1 of the
 administration. Here we are, asiieu to
 ratify this consular treaty at the time
 the war in Vietnam is going on. The
 Secretary of State has come over and
 said that he thinks that this would be a
 plus, that it might be helpful in bring-
 ing about more normal and peaceful re-
 lationships; and yet you can pick up a
 publication from the Department of
 State, setting forth the Secretary's views
 and those of Gen. Maxwell Taylor, an ad-
 ministration  witness,  entitled  "The
 Heart of the Problem," relating to the
 war ;n Vietnam, and find such state-
 ment, as the following. I quote first
 some of Mr. Rusk's statements. On
 page the says:
 But we are in Viet-Nam because the Issues
 posed there are deeply intertwined with our
 own security and because the outcome of the
 struggle can profoundly affect the nature of
 the world In which we and our children will
 live.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  The
 Senator's time has expired.
 Mr MILLER. Another 5 minutes, Mr.
 President.
 If that is so, then since when are we
 entering into a Consular Treaty, a bi-
 lateral treaty, for the first time in recent
 years, with the chief supplier and equip-
 per of the enemy in South Vietnam?
 Secretary Rusk went on to say:
 What are our world security interests In-
 volved In the struggle in Viet-Nam? * *
 We must recognize that what we are seek-
 ing to achieve In South Viel -Nam is part of
 a prccess that has continued for a long
 time--a process of preventing the expansion
 and extension of Communist domination by
 the use of force against the weaker nations
 on the perimeter of Communist power.
 This is the problem as It looks to us. Nor
 do the Communists themselves see the prob-
 lem is isolation. They see the struggle in
 South Viet-Nam as part of a larger design for
 the steady extension of Ccmmunist power
 through force and threat.
 Th!n further on he says:
 But the Communist world has returned to
 Its demand for what it calls a "world revo-
 lutior," a world of coercion in direct con-
 tradiction to the Charter of the United Na-
 tions. There may be differences within the
 Communist world about methods, and tech-
 niques, and leadership within the Commu-
 nist world itself, but they E.hare a common
 attachment to their "world revolution" and
 to Its support through what they call "wars
 of liberation."
 Then General Taylor had this to say:
 Kosygin told Mr. Reston in his interview
 of last December:
 "We believe that national liberation wars
 are just wars and they will ontinue as long
 as there Is national oppression by imperialist
 powers."
 Bef)re him, Khrushchev, :n January 1961,
 had the following to say:
 "Now a word about national liberation
 wars. The armed struggle by the Vietnam-
 ese people or the war of the Algerian people
 serve as the latest example of such wars.
 These are revolutionary wars. Such wars are
 not only admissible but inevitable. Can
 such wars flare up in the future? They can,
 The Communists fully support such just
 wars and march In the front rank of peoples
 waging liberation struggles."
 These statements were made in 1966,
 and I must say that people who read
