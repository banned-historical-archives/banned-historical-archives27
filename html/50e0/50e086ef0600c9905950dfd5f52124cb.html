 ROLE OF JOINT OPERATIONS IN MODERN WARFARE DISCUSSED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 4 Feb 81 p 2
 [Article by army commander Cai Buchi [2580 2975 1062]:   "It Is Necessary To
 Further Define the Purpose of Basic Training"]
 [Text]   The public unanimously recognizes that the basic training program is
 important and that it is a self-evident fact.   However, they have failed to pay
 enough attention to the objective of basic training.  The importance and objective
 of basic training are two related but different issues.   Practice shows that
 whether the basic training program has a well-defined objective spells a big
 difference in the results of the training.   In my opinion, using existing
 equipment to extend the application of basic training to real wars and to shorten
 the period between training and combat-readiness in order to meet the needs of the
 joint operations of our armed forces is the starting point and ultimate objective
 of our basic training program.
 Does everyone clearly understand this objective?  Not really.   It must be said
 that formalism still exists to varying degrees in some of our army units when they
 undergo basic training.  For example, they emphasize basic maneuvers and neglect
 basic theories; they emphasize technical essentials and neglect tactical
 essentials; they emphasize the essentials of daylight operations and neglect those
 of night fighting; they emphasize the basic training of fighters instead of
 cadres; they emphasize the so-called "rigid targets" clearly indicated by
 numerals, meters and minutes instead of "nonrigid targets" which cannot be
 represented by any figures.   In sorth, they emphasize basic training under the
 general (normal) conditions and neglect basic training under the complicated
 conditions (simulating real wars).  The consequence of this attitude toward basic
 training is very bad.  While undergoing shooting training, some units often score
 outstanding successes at the firing ranges.   Their scores often drop markedly when
 the shooting is practiced under conditions simulating the tactical scenes of real
 war.   The signal corps can maintain communications under general conditions but
 would fail in their duties in the event of interference.  The artillery units can
 hit their targets under well-prepared conditions but-would miss them in times of
 an emergency callup.   It seems necessary to overcome formalism and championship
 mentality in order to achieve the well-defined objective of basic training.
 How to treat achievements is really a problem.   Should the training be treated as
 a mission to fight wars or as part of show business?  Do we want to score
 successes under general conditions or under conditions simulating real wars?

 Either a correct or misleading guiding thought of training would result from the
 answers to these questions.  The desire for some norms and conventions and for
 achievements does not conflict with the purpose of real wars.   But it should not
 depart from the general objective of treating the training as a mission to fight
 wars.  In recent years, the slogan "the training should be regarded as a mission
 to fight wars" is no longer shouted as loudly as before.  Today it seems necessary
 to renew this slogan.   The genuine realization of the concept of treating training
 as a mission to fight wars calls for a scientific training program.  To meet the
 needs of real wars, an overall evaluation of various basic training programs is
 necessary so that their execution can be arranged in the order of priorities or in
 the order of importance and urgency and treated in different ways.   Specific
 length of time and equipment should be allocated to guarantee the execution of
 badly needed important basic training programs in times of a real war, and high
 standards should be set for each of them.  Leadership of all levels should work
 hard to meet these standards.   Among them are the basic training of cadres in
 organizing the command system, the basic training of various arms and services in
 joint operations, combat shooting practice as part of marksmanship training, the
 antitank, the antiatomic bomb and antichemical defensive training under the
 "three-anti and three defensive operations" program.   On the other hand, standards
 should not be set too high for less important and not so urgently needed programs
 as training in bayonet fighting and hand-grenade throwing.   As long as we bear in
 mind the necessity of treating training as a mission to fight wars and devote our
 limited time for training to carrying out the most urgent, most difficult and most
 useful programs, we can certainly produce solid results in basic training.
 A further effort to define the objective of basic training calls for a vigorous
 study of and seeking of solutions for new problems resulting from basic training
 in fighting wars under modern conditions.   Some comrades say that it is dull and
 prosaic to engage in the same old basic training program year after year.   This
 idea results from the following three facts:   1.   Because the training is
 organized in a "hodge-podge" way, its content is "universally applicable," the
 basic training program has given the people the impression that "it is something
 new for the 1st year, overlapping for the 2d year and too old for the 3d year";
 2.   The content and demands of basic training have been assessed from an
 unchanging point of view;   3.   The mischievous idea of self-complacency is
 troublesome.   The three facts originate from this truth:   a lack of purpose and
 conviction in modern warfare.
 The allegation that the basic training program is "nothing new" seemingly sounds
 true.   For example, participants in the rifle and machinegun firing training
 should remember the "three points--the target, miss point and bull's eye--and one
 straight line" rule or the most rudimentary knowledge.   If the structure of rifle
 and machinegun remains basically the same, this "old rule" on shooting training
 would not be changed.   But we must see the constant changes that take place in
 basic training--changes in the targets to be fought, changes in the weapons and
 equipment used by ourselves and the enemy, the induction of new soldiers year
 after year and the constant turnaround of cadres.   These developments and changes
 are certain to add new elements to the content and demands of basic training.
 The extremely cruel nature of modern warfare and the constant changes in the
 situation on battlefields will also place new demands on the joint operations of
 the armed forces, the content of basic training, the political, technical and
 physical qualities of army units.   Great progress has been made by the enemy in

 areas of firepower, mobility, ability to mount surprise attacks, battlefield
 observation, equipment used in the command system in modern warfare.   This has
 also placed new demands on marksmanship training, and training in mobility,
 ecititmunications, command art, security arrangements, and joint operations.   To use
 inferior equipment to defeat an enemy armed with superior equipment, we must
 understand many strange problems and overcome many difficulties.   For example,  if
 cadres in command positions have no rich professional knowledge, no strategy to
 win victory by surprise attacks, no superlative command art, and no strong will to
 fight under complicated conditions, our armed forces will find it impossible to
 coordinate with each other in attacking the enemy.  More and more comrades have
 come to realize that the factor of time is crucial in modern warfare, and war
 preparations should be calculated by minutes and seconds rather than by days and
 hours.   Any delay in terms of a few minutes may cause tremendous changes in the
 situation on battlefields.   In a confrontation with the enemy mechanical and
 armored crops, the enemy artillery fire would quickly overcome us and the enemy
 tanks and armored cars would soon storm our positions if our first firing missed
 the targets.   If one of the services participating in a joint operation lacks
 solid basic training, it will find it impossible to coordinate with other
 services.   The cruelties of war may take a heavier toll than expected on
 battlefields.  If we lack versatile basic training, we will find it difficult to
 cope with the modern warfare and will find ourselves unable to use a variety of
 deployed weapons to the best advantage.  All of these demand that we overcome the
 "old concept" of basic training, and change the "universally applicable" content
 of training, and the "hodge-podge" approach to the organization of training.  We
 must do everything possible to avoid the unnecessary and overlapping practices in
 training.   Vigorous efforts must be made to develop the training program in a
 scientific way and to stimulate the enthusiasm of commanders and fighters for
 military training.  We must help them explore new methods of basic training
 through the discussion of new topics of modern warfare.
 Some comrades are concerned that emphasizing joint training this way may lead to
 the toning down of basic training.   This concern is unnecessary.  Why couldn't a
 joint training program materialize as a result of so many years of basic training
 which is supposed to help army units improve their basic skills in fighting?
 Although the reasons are manifold, the root cause of this problem is a lack of a
 clear declaration that the objective of basic training is to serve the joint
 operation of the armed forces.   In the final analysis, the basic training program
 is the basis of training in joint operations.   The purpose of this training is to
 make joint operations possible.   For this reason, the basic training program
 cannot depart from the guidelines of joint operations.   Just as in the case of
 laying a foundation for a multistory building, the construction of this project
 cannot get underway.if the foundation is not laid firmly.   It must be noted,
 however, that the foundation for a two-story building differs in requirements from
 the foundation for a six-story building.   Our desire to use the concept of joint
 operations to guide and enhance the basic training program has the objective of
 testing the basic training program in the tactical joint training and joint
 operations of the armed forces, and improving coordination between the basic
 training program and joint exercises.   Advocating the use of the concept of joint
 operation to guide basic training absolutely does not stem from a desire to
 promote any "leapfrog-type" joint training during the period of basic training.
 What we really want is a training program still to be carried out in accordance
 with related regulations.  Last year when we selected a:reinforced infantry

 regiment to participate in a joint training program, we began with the
 proclamation of a requirement for "laying a solid foundation and doing everything
 possible to serve the joint operations."  We devoted two-thirds or more, of the
 time allotted to this joint operation to the basic training.  The training was
 organized in a way that proceeded from an elementary course to an advanced course,
 from a simple course to a complex program, from the training in basic skills to
 their application, and from the training for individuals to joint training.   In
 addition to conscientiously grasping the basic training of army units, we
 concentrated attention on training cadres in basic skills.  As soon as the
 groundwork was laid for various professional detachments of a specific army unit,
 training in improving basic skills in coordinating infantry with artillery units,
 infantry units with tanks, and ground forces with air force units was added to the
 entire program.  As soon as the guidelines of joint operations were strengthened,
 we placed the basic training program under the guidance of an overall joint
 training program.   The result was great success in basic training.   Our
 achievements in major performances proved to be better than in previous years,
 thus laying a firm foundation for the subsequent joint tactical training program.
 Practice shows that the emphasis of laying groundwork for joint operations will
 result in strengthening rather than weakening the basic training program.  We
 should not pit basic training against joint training, and should not separate the
 former from the latter.   Only by integrating the two into a single effort in an
 organic way can we lend substance to the objective of basic training and provide a
 reliable guarantee for fulfilling the joint training program.   It is wrong to
 assume that advocating the use of the concept of a joint operation to guide the
 basic training program as an attempt to discard the basic training program or
 circumvent it to carry out the joint training program.   The application of the
 concept of a joint operation to guide the basic training program calls for a
 scientific training plan.   Our armed forces have different arms, services and
 professional detachments.   What they should do first, what should come next, how
 they can proceed with their basic training programs, how these programs should be
 arranged, and what standards should be set for these programs are tasks that
 should be specifically planned and carried out in accordance with related
 requirements.   These programs should be scheduled in an orderly manner and in
 sequences which advance from the low level to the high level and from the
 individual training to the joint training.   We should emphasize training in basic
 skills on the one hand and training in their application on the other.  While
 promoting professional training for individuals, we must attach importance to
 laying groundwork for joint training.   In addition to grasping the joint training
 of a single service, we must pay attention to the joint training of various
 services.   Only in this way, can we leave a mark every step of the way, and raise
 the basic training program to a new level during our march to the goal of a joint
 operation.

 MAJOR REFORM IN MILITARY TRAINING OUTLINED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 12 Sep 79 pp 1-2
 [Article by Lin Jian [2651 0494] et al.:   "A Major Change Is Needed in Our Military
 Training"]
 [Text]  Drill must become a "bloodless battle" and battle must become a "bloody
 drill."  In the 1st century A.D., Josephus made this statement when discussing the
 Roman training method, and it concisely and comprehensively lays bare the relation-
 ship between training and war.  The war of self-defense counterattack against Viet-
 nam that we waged at the
 end
 of the
 70's decade of
 the truth that training
 changeable.
 and
 war are
 interdependent,
 the 20th century proved again
 mutually permeating, and mutually
 The sound of rifles and cannon in the lofty mountains and jungle of Asia's tropics
 echoes throughout the whole army.   Having passed through a "bloody drill," the great
 number of officers and men are thinking deeply about a "bloodless battle."  How can
 they truly change the experience bought with blood in the war into wealth that
 guides training?  Does the training content and methods practiced for many years need
 a major change?   What is the way, in the final analysis, to achieve greater, faster,
 better, and more economical results in training for combat preparedness?  Should
 our training stick to old ways?  Should these old ways be slowly replaced or should
 they be vigorously eliminated and new ways be fostered so as to speedily get on the
 track of modernization?
 How are we to change our military training?  Introducing the discussion of the
 criterion for truth into the military realm (isn't this to talk'about "making up a
 missed lesson"?  This is a good subject relating to reality.), to look at training
 from the angle of actual combat, the following several questions directly enter our
 inquiry.
 We Should Make "Armed Defense of the Four Modernizations" the Standpoint of Training
 The war of self-defensive counterattack against Vietnam smashed the argument that
 we "prepared again and again against.a war that would never come," and deepened our
 concept of "armed defense of the four modernizations.  Hegemonism will not readily
 resign itself to our country's carrying out the four modernizations but will cer-
 tainly seek an opportunity to destroy them, and the biggest destruction is effected
 by instigating a war.   It is hard to imagine that our country's four modernizations
 will be peacefully carried out in an international environment free from the threat
 of war.  This view was confirmed by this war that we fought. From harsh reality we
 can only draw the conclusion:  the four modernizations must be defended by armed
 >t.ruggle.

 Making the armed defense of the four modernizations the standpoint of training is
 the embodient of defending the motherland and defending socialist construction,
 and is the demand raised by the general task of this new era with regard to training.
 For our training to make the defense of the four modernization its standpoint, we
 must have a clearcut guiding ideology so that we can maintain a correct orientation
 and arouse even more the enthusiasm for training.  "The training received in 1 month
 of combat action is superior to the training received in 1:year of peacetime."
 Why?  The principle is this.  If we take the training in this combat action to be
 that of a "small-scale action," then, no matter whether its distance in time from
 the outbreak of the next war is long or short, we might as well, during this period
 of time, look upon it as a "big-scale action."  Our training will.change with every
 passing day and the changes will be considerable.  The kind of peacetime training
 idea that "day. after day we go to the training ground but we are not preparing to
 go to the battlefield," that kind of work style "only thunder but no rain," i.e.,
 much said but little done and shouting strategic slogans as if they were tactical
 slogans, that kind of "cups and medals mania" tendency that the purpose of training
 is comparison and competition, that kind of bureaucratic practice that draws a
 circle about something but refuses to have the final say about it, and for a long
 time remains at the stage of "research"--in 8 or 9 cases out of 10 is a fault in
 training standpoint.
 We Must Make Education and Training Central
 The 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee unequivocally proclaimed:
 The focus of the entire party's work is to be shifted to the construction of
 socialist modernization.   In line with this historical shift, education and training
 should be made central in armed forces' work and the pace of the construction of
 modernization quickened.   If one is not clear about this point, the strategic
 position of training can only sink to the level of empty talk.   In the past, owing
 to the damage inflicted by Lin Biao and the "gang of four," there was created a
 situation in which only civil affairs were carried out and military affairs were
 ignored, and there was "military blindness" on the part of armed groups.   The units
 did not all receive training, those in principal charge of military administration
 withdrew to the second line, and many of those handling training were "back-
 benchers."  This situation was hard to reverse.
 In accordance with the theory concerning the principal contradiction in our country
 at the present stage put forward by the communique of the 3d Plenary Session and
 Comrade Hua Guofeng's "Report on the Work of the Government," and analyzing the
 current state of affairs in our armed forces, we can clearly see:  the degree of
 modernization in our armed forces is still very low and is far from meeting the
 demands of modern warfare.   To change all the rules and regulations, establishments
 and systems, leaders' work styles, work methods, and force of habit that do not
 suit the construction of modernization, and to rapidly raise the level of moderni-
 zation in strategy and tactics, is the principal contradiction that needs to be
 resolved by our armed forces at the present stage and is also the central task of
 our armed forces in this stage.   In order to resolve this contradiction, under con-
 ditions when we are not at war, we must mainly rely on education and training.
 Political work must be strengthened, and it must center on serve this central
 task.  We must not and should not again take class struggle as the key link or make
 political movements, central.   In order to strengthen the construction of the armed

 forces, the Military Commission [of the CCP Central Committee] convoked three con-
 ferences was to have the entire armed forces make preparations against war.   In
 phis process, a great amount of the daily work went into education and training.
 Facts in this war of self-defensive counterattack against Vietnam proved:   it makes
 a great difference whether training is carried out or not, it makes a great differ-
 ence whether training is good or otherwise, and it makes a great difference whether
 the cadres have been trained in military academies or schools or not.  Thus, it was
 natural and logical to shift the focus of the entire armed forces' work to the
 strengthening of modernization with education and training at the core.
 To judge whether education and training are truly at the core, we can study some
 items, e.g., whether the majority of units are being given and are truly being
 given all-round training; whether the principal persons in charge of military admin-
 istration in units being given all-round training devote their principal energy and
 time to grasping training; whether the personnel, time, content, and quality of the
 training are ascertained in advance; whether the situation has changed in cadre
 training so that key points are discussed, difficult points are grasped, and weak
 points are inspected; and whether, in. transmitting missions to the lower levels, the
 headquarters, political and logistical organizations work as one to grasp this core,
 and create by all means conditions for good training.  This last item is a very
 key item, and it must be resolved well.
 Prevent and Overcome the Practice in Training Guidance of "Cutting With One Stroke
 of. the Knife"
 Our armed forces are garrisoned in the vast territory of the motherland.   In each
 garrison area, the terrain is different, there is a_great disparity in heat and cold,
 the enemy's situation is different, and the mission is different.   Thus, in train-
 ing guidance, we must prevent and overcome simplification, i.e., "cutting with one
 stroke of the knife."  For example:. acting as if the northern and southern parts
 of the country were alike, as if the defense of the interior and the defense of the
 borders were alike, as if the strategy for first-line forces and the strategy for
 reserve forces were alike, as if field armies and regional forces were alike, and
 as if veteran soldiers and new soldiers were alike.   In the. distribution of specific
 topics and time for company training, to unify this distribution too rigidly is
 very detrimental to arousing the enthusiasm of the cadres and fighters.   For example,
 on an island where communications are handled by electric cable, to still demand
 that telephone soldiers erect telephone poles for pole-climbing training; in digging
 an antitank network, to demand that mountainous areas and plains be treated alike,
 so that the troops are forced to level a hilltop before digging the ditches.   The
 great number of officers and men sum up these phenomena by calling this training
 guidance "cutting with one. stroke of the knife."
 "Cutting with one stroke of the knife"--this product of subjectivism and bureaucrat-
 ism--has become more and more unworkable.   It replaces the specific with the general,
 uses the generality to obliterate the individual, "cutting" down the training
 focus," cutting down the initiative of the officers and men, and seriously divorcing
 training from actual combat.   If one is not trained in the requirements of war, one
 cannot act vigorously.   If a unit in mountains and jungles are not trained in map
 recognition and reading, then during a maneuver it cannot move according to the
 azimuth and it will go back and forth and finally return to where it originally

 started from, with the result that the unit will have proof that "the earth is
 round."
 Do you want, by seeking truth from facts and by proceeding from reality, to change
 this state of affairs of "cutting with one stroke of the knife"?  Then you will be
 going against the training outline; if you want to stick to the outline, then you
 will be separating yourself from reality.  Because the outline was promulgated by
 the upper level, the result will only be to do things in a Procrustean manner,
 making reality submit to the outline, the objective submit to the subjective.
 The bloody experiences and lessons of this war of self-defensive counterattack made
 people feel most sorrowfully that "cutting with one stroke of the knife" brings
 great trouble to others and, that we cannot let it continue.  Many units that took
 part in the war have suggested:  Either there should be a fairly large revision of
 the training outline or it should not be followed.  This outline was formulated on
 the unchanging foundation of an annual training period (90 to 120 days), with the
 result that there are many contradictions in it.  Whether it is possible or not to
 have the outline, for every year the headquarters of the General Staff issues a
 training directive containing the policy, principles, content, and demands for
 training, which provides the basis for education and training in the entire armed
 forces.  Each military man, each service arm, and each unit integrates its combat
 mission, paying attention to its own combat objective and its own terrain and cli-
 matic features, and drafts its training plan, which is then reported to the head-
 quarters of the General Staff.  Thus, our training guidance is unified but not
 rigidly so, is concentrated but not excessively so, and it possesses both general-
 ity and particularity.  What is displayed-is not the enthusiasm of one but of many,
 and the training moves-along like a gain of chess.
 The Single Service Arm Mentality Is Very Harmful
 There is this example of a battle:   The 1st Company of a certain unit was attacking
 a certain hill.   The company commander had put the weapons attached to his unit to
 one side, and let the infantry make 11 attacks in succession.  They fought for 9
 hours 44 minutes without success.  The company commander then thought of the heavy
 machineguns, flamethrowers, the engineer squad, and the recoilless rifles that had
 not yet been used.   By organizing their coordinated use, the battle was decided in
 only 20 minutes.   This battle example shows that it is truly inadequate for a com-
 pany commander,.as he did in the past, to brandish his Mauser pistol. and shout
 "Charge!"; that in peacetime if one is accustomed to think in terms of one service
 arm, then in fighting a war one will have artillery pieces but not use them, and
 the slogan "cannon cannot prevail over bayonets, so infantry decides the outcome of
 a battle," which is like 'a satchel charge in the mind, is out-of-date and should
 be changed to "cannon can prevail over bayonets and the outcome of a battle is
 decided by coordination of the service arms."
 The problems revealed by this kind of battle example are representative of those
 among commanders at all levels.   They regard the special arms attached to their
 units as "millstones around their necks," fiddle with them and do not think of using
 them, forget about them when organizing a battle, and by attending to one thing
 lose sight of another; they unconditionally let tanks charge ahead without opening
 a route for them; they want the flamethrower soldiers to throw flames but do not

 have command authority, and those who. have commandeauthority do not understand the
 special arms; and they unscientifically issue blind orders to technical service
 arms that exceed the capacity of these arms.  All these things invariably show that
 the single service arm mentality has gravely endangered combat operations and
 hindered training, and is harming out combat effectiveness.
 The single service arm mentality has become a kind of ideology.   It took shape for
 many reasons:  historical and current, ideological and organizational, and theoret-
 ical and practical.  It is deep-rooted and quite hard to change.  In the 1920's,
 the old Red Army carried knapsacks wherever it went and threw wooden-handled hand
 grenades; in the 1970's, the youths still carry knapsacks everywhere and the wooden
 handle of the hand grenade has not been cast aside.  The battle career over several
 decades of "millet plus rifles" deeply imprinted the single service arm mentality
 on the minds of many of our comrades.  The slogan "battles are decided by infantry"
 has become an unalterable theory for them.   In peacetime, very little training in
 combined arms operations is done, and some soldiers of the special arms become pro-
 duction soldiers and noncombatant-soldiers, while many leading cadres frequently
 concern themselves only with the infantry.   Our army has already changed from being
 a single service arm to being a combined arms force, and the number of special arms
 companies exceeds that of infantry companies, but these leading cadres still always
 consider infantry the "big boss."  In the military establishment and system in effect
 and the weaponry and equipment on hand, there remain many single service arm mal-
 practices, which are detrimental to carrying out combined arms operations.  There
 are now few materials on foreign armies provided, no organizing of visits to observe
 the advanced weaponry and equipment of units.   Irrational restrictions and fetters
 and security measures close people's minds so that they are ignorant and ill-informed.
 The outmoded, backward single service arm mentality departs far from the trend
 toward modernization of the armed forces.   To overcome it, to eliminate it, and to
 replace it with combined arms training and coordinated operations has become a task
 of top priority in fundamentally changing the features of trianing in our armed
 forces.
 Some tentative measures have already been found for preventing or overcoming the
 single service arm mentality:
 1.   The higher military academies and schools are to offer training courses for
 high-ranking cadres in which they will study modern'warfare, study the performance
 and function of modernized weaponry and equipment,-and study the organizational
 command of coordinated operations involving all service arms.  All ordinary cadres
 must enter, in turn, the academies and schools to pursue advanced studies.   The
 units must run well groups'for training cadres in rotation.
 2.   In deploying infantry and special arms cadres, "combined arms" groups are to be
 set up, thereby changing the state of affairs in which the membership of leadership
 groups are homogenous.
 3.   Every army is to organize and set up a combined arms regiment (battalion) con-
 sisting of infantry, artillery, tank and other service arms, first planting "ex-
 perimental plots," gaining experience, and then gradually popularizing them.
 4.   There will be more live tactical combined training in which all service arms
 will participate.

 Persons will, in a planned way, be sent out of the country for on-the spot investi-
 gations in order to learn about the experience of foreign armies in combined arms
 training and coordinated military operations.
 Break Away From the Dogmatic Attitude Toward Mao Zedong's Military Thought
 What is the basis for bringing up these questions?  Please look at the facts:
 In writing and compiling teaching materials, some people do not use the fundamental
 principles of, and the standpoint, viewpoint, and method for studying warfare in,
 Mao Zedong's military thought, but simply load their materials with the quotations
 [of Mao Zedong].  They do not think about forging ahead in the study of military
 theory, and thus strategic and tactical thought follows old regulations and living
 military principles are changed into dead articles.
 Study and research on military theory are insufficiently integrated with reality.
 The principles of fighting a battle of annihilation--concentration of military force
 being the condition, thrusting deep and outflanking being the method, and complete
 encirclement being the plan--can be thoroughly memorized but when applied can still
 be only 'a gleam on the horizon.
 They take principles to be the starting point for studying problems.   In summing up
 training and combat experiences, they do not want to investigate and study, do not
 want to make a concrete analysis, and simplistically reach triumphant conclusions.
 With regard to whatever Chairman Mao had said, no matter how the situation had .
 changed, the conclusions did not change.  At the end of 1945, Chairman Mao said,
 "With regard to training items, raising the technical level of firing, bayonet
 charges, and throwing hand grenades are still primary and raising the tactical level
 is supplementary."  Today, several decades later, they still take this statement to
 be the basis for life-risking bayonet charges and hand grenade throwing.   Some of
 the 10 major military principles that Chairman Mao talked about must be developed,
 and some of them must be revised, and specific ones have already become unsuitable.
 Some. comrades. still insist:   The 10 major military principles are completely suitable,
 suitable in the past, at present, and in the future.
 With regard to Mao Zedong's military thought, we can only discuss its application
 and dare not discuss its development.   Chairman Mao did not discuss many questions
 of modern warfare (e.g., concentrating military force, engaging in close combat and
 night combat, and attacking massed tanks), and so we dare not air his opinions.about
 them.   If one stubbornly wants to discuss them a little, then one will be using
 indiscriminate applications of realymade principles and formulas as a substitute for
 an earnest inquiry into academic military problems.
 From the abovementioned facts we see the shadow of the ."pinnace theory" and the
 vestiges of the two "whatevers" in the realm of military thought.   In short, they
 both make a mystery of and a formula of Mao Zedong's military thought.   If we take
 this dogmatic attitude, then we will not be able to understand completely and
 accurately Mao Zedong's military thought or grasp it in line with seeking truth
 from facts, and Mao Zedong's military thought cannot truly become a compass for
 our army's training and combat operations.

 Training requires for its correct guidance advanced, scientific military theory.
 Looking at this thought from the angle of modern features and developments, laying
 stress on studying the application of Mao Zedong's military thought under the
 conditions of modern warfare, and, by integrating theory with practice, answering
 and solving training and operational problems--this is the Marxist attitude toward
 military theory.  We can predict that, after this dogmatic attitude is thoroughly
 eradicated, our army's education and training will rapidly get on the right track
 and be able to pass the severe test of war.

 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 5 Sep 79 p 2
 [Article by deputy army commander Wang Gencheng [3769 2704 2052]:  "Preliminary
 Trials and Ideas About Training Examination Reform"]
 [Text]  Not long ago we organized a comprehensive tactical examination under field
 conditions and with soldiers using live ammunition in which 11 companies of infantry,
 artillery, and tanks took part, and conducted preliminary trials on how to make com-
 bat operations, training, and examinations consistent.   From the practice of this
 examination we saw that the following three aspects of examination reform need to
 be resolved.
 The Content of Examinations Must Embody Changes in the Key Points of Training
 At present, the unit's training has already shifted from the past when attacks on
 infantry were primary to making attacks on tanks primary, from training a single
 service arm to training in coordinating all service arms, and from stressing tech-
 niques to paying full attention to tactics.  This suits the demands of actual com-
 bat, and the examination content should embody the changes in the key points of
 training, so as to impel the unit to pay full attention to the training topics that
 are required by combat operations.
 Add to the proportion of the "three attacks and three defenses" in training exam-
 inations.   Everybody knows the importance of the "three attacks and three defenses,"
 but at present the proportion of this aspect in the content of examinations is still
 fairly small and needs to be bigger.  For this examination, we arranged for 10 out
 of the 19 training topics to include the "three attacks and three defenses" in the
 examination content.   For the firing at fixed and moving targets of the 85mm cannon,
 the 82mm recoilless rifle, and the 40mm rocket launcher--all against a background of
 actual combat--there were examined three different missions under different condi-
 tions and over different terrain.  In order to make this key point more prominent,
 we also increased the score proportion so that "three attacks and three defenses"
 topics counted for 65 percent of the total score.
 Strengthen the examination of tactical training.  Practice in the war of self-
 defensive counterattack on the China-Vietnam border showed us that it is extremely
 important to raise the tactical level of units.  However, owing to the fact that
 there exists among us, from top to bottom, the idea of attaching more importance to
 techniques than to tactics, there was little tactical content in examinations and

 the methods of this content were stereotyped, and the tactical training of units was
 done perfunctorily.  In order to,change this state of affairs, the army, the divi-
 sion, and the regiment need to organize their strength and carry out research to
 find out the content, standards, and ways to carrying out examinations on tactics,
 so that there will truly be good training in tactics and the training in this re-
 spect will be lively.  To this end, we organized an enhanced examination for in-
 fantry company tactics based on the demands of actual combat, on unfamiliar terrain
 and under complex conditions, which tested combat operations arranged by higher
 levels and tested the. organizational command and movement of detachments in carrying
 out a single combat mission, thereby comprehending tempering and improving the
 operational skills of the companies in marching, attacking, eating, bivouvacing, and
 concealing themselves and tentatively garnering for some experience in examining the
 unit's tactics.
 Examine well the training in coordinating all service arms.   Formerly this aspect
 was not examined, and there are still no clear-cut standards.  This situation re-
 quires great efforts both at the top and the bottom to find out in practice methods
 of examining this aspect.  Based on our preliminary practice, with regard to its
 content, there are three principal links in coordination training:   the degree of
 mastery by the commanders of a combined'arms force in applying the principles and
 the organizational procedural methods.with regard to the service arms; the handling
 of all sorts of situations; and the coordination of infantry-artillery, infantry-
 tank movements as. well. as the coordination of the movements of specialized detach-
 ments.  By centering on these three links we can fix standards and methods for the
 specific examination of commanders at all levels as well as the fighters.  At a
 trail point in the examination this.time, we attached technical arms under the
 regiment to infantry detachments.  The seven infantry companies that took part in
 this examination were each augmented with a platoon which had a 82mm recoilless
 rifle, a.82mm mortar and.a heavy,machinegun and with a team that had three flame-
 throwers.  For opposing airborne-forces, the companies were also strengthened with
 two howitzer companies, one 85mm cannon company, and consistently put into effect
 in the training examination.. The following points were examined according to the
 development of the battle:  First, the preparatory fire by long-range artillery and
 the organizational command of each unit from the time of its advance to the time of
 its launching of an assault on the enemy.  The coordinated operations of the directly
 aimed artillery's destruction of its target, the enemy armor, and the wiping out by
 all the infantry weapons firing at one time on the landed airborne enemy at a dis-
 tance of 250 to 500 meters.  Second, the coordinated operation of the tanks over-
 taking the infantry battle formation and.leading the infantry assault, and also,
 when advancing, stopping for a short time and firing, violently breaking through
 and cutting the enemy line and then compressing the enemy into a narrow space.  Third,
 the organizational command over the tanks in their original positions supporting
 the infantry assault, the short period-of.preparatory fire by mortars, and the
 simultaneous encircling and destruction of the enemy by 11 infantry, tank, and
 artillery detachments.   Through this kind of live soldier and live ammunition train-
 ing examination of the service arms, which tested the company-level commanders of
 the 11 companies that took part in the examination, an understanding was reached of
 their actual capacity to command combined arms operations.   This preliminary test
 was a way for us to find out how to strengthen future training examinations with
 regard to coordinating the service arms.
 With Regard to Examination Methods, We Must Be Adept at Creating Complex Conditions
 That Approximate the Battlefield, Designing Our Tests Based on War
 In order to train military units, some countries in the West have set up special
 "training centers" and "testing grounds."  Before the outbreak of the fourth Middle

 East war, the Egyptian army, in.order to break through the Bar-Lev defense line,
 picked out a river that had the same velocity flow as The Suez Canal and conducted
 over 300 training tests on it.  The creation by foreign armies of conditions that
 approximate actual combat is a very significant lesson for us.  Based on the know-
 ledge we gained from this training examination, of all the methods of reforming
 training, the most fundamental one is to provide testing conditions that approximate
 as closely as possible actual combat, designing our tests based on war.
 1.  Choose the site well so as to conduct the.tests in an.environment approximating
 actual combat.  In military operations great attention must be paid to terrain, and
 in peacetime training terrain should also be given full attention.  This time we
 chose a site that approximated the battlefield of a future war; it had the typical
 features of northern terrain.  Based on :different terrain features, a different
 content for the examination was arranged.  With the units far from the barracks and
 drillground, they were tested in the field where the terrain and roads were unfam-
 iliar and complex so that the environment approximated actual combat and they had
 to analyze and deal with problems.   This was much different from past examinations,
 and with regard to where to move and position even the simplest piece of artillery
 or single horse, terrain had to be taken into account and given earnest thought.
 2.  The form of the situation must, as far as possible, embody the complexity of a
 future war.  There are.good terrain conditions and there are also good situations.
 There are situations on the battlefield in which the enemy collapses at our first
 assault and in which the enemy is routed at our first attack, but they have no
 actual value in peacetime training examinations.  Therefore, the situation must be
 changed from that of the wishful thinking of the past so as to embody, as far. as
 possible, actual combat situations.   In the examination this time, in accordance with
 the enemy's tactical characteristics and the combat methods that could be adopted,
 as well as the missions that the various companies could shoulder in a future com-
 bat, we set up three training topics, viz, penetrating and cutting up the enemy,
 engaging the enemy, and attacking enemy airborne forces, with 19 training problems
 and 76 training contents.   There were many complex changes in the situation:   some-
 times one kind of situation would appear suddenly, and at other times many kinds of
 situations from many directions would appear at one time.   In a future war, all the
 possible situations we would encounter and all the possible methods and measures
 we could adopt with regard to the enemy were embodied in the training examination.
 This was beneficial for tempering and improving the unit's capabilities in actual
 combat.
 3.   Through strict examinations, set standards for actual combat.   Practice proves
 that with the "nursemaid" method of training and examinations the genuine skills
 and knowledge required by actual combat cannot be learned.   Formerly all types of
 firing were done on the shooting range and there were many conditions that assisted
 the firing.   But when it comes to application, this type of training does not com-
 pletely meet the demands-of actual combat.   This time for the live-ammunition firing
 examination, all sorts of targets-continually appeared at the front or on the flanks,
 on the top of hills, at different heights, in big and small groups, and the targets
 were extremely irregular.  Many targets were also concealed in thick growths of
 grass, making them hard to distinguish.   The gunners had to make calcualtions for
 whatever terrain they occupied.  The targets of fire were sometimes set at an angle
 of depression and sometimes at an angle of elevation, and for all of them the
 gunners had to estimate the distance themselves, set the rear sight themselves, and
 choose the point to aim at themselves.    All of this greatly increased the difficulty

 in firing, and although the number of successful hits, as compared with those on
 the drillground, fell slightly, it was a useful firing exercise that approximated
 the conditions of actual combat and was by comparison solid and down-to-earth.
 The Key to Reforming Examinations Is To Change the Leading Cadres' Ideas About
 Training
 How a given unit's training is grasped and how the examination of its training is
 done always has a close connection with the ideas of the unit's leadership, espec-
 ially the leading cadres in charge of training.  Therefore, if we want to make the
 content and methods of examinations meet the demands of actual combat, the key is
 for the leading cadres' ideas about guiding training to be correct, and this requires
 that the following ideological barriers be done away with:
 First is the idea of fearing a drop in examination scores.   Some comrades worry that
 examining the units according to the standards of actual combat will lower scores.
 If we look at this question purely from the standpoint of examination marks, then
 the scores of examinations conducted in the field under conditions approximating
 actual combat will be somewhat lower than the scores of examinations conducted on
 the drillground.  But the former scores actually reflect the unit's training level,
 and the unit learns true skills that it can use.   If the unit were to only pursue
 so-called good scores on graphs, then when war breaks out it would suffer and even
 not be able to fulfill its mission.
 Second is the negative idea of accident prevention.   Some comrades fear that, by
 taking a unit in the field with all its vehicles, artillery pieces, supplies and
 gear, and engaging in exercises with live soldiers using live ammunition, if the
 exercise is not done well accidents will occur and there will be complaints from
 top to bottom.  There should be a correct attitude toward this problem, and these
 comrades should recognize that in an examination conducted under conditions that
 approximate actual combat there is a greater possibility of accidents occuring than
 there is in a barracks, but one cannot, because of the fear of accidents occurring,
 bind one's own hands and feet.   In the past, our army organized and carried out
 between 10 and 20 live-ammunition, night-and-day tactical exercises, from the com-
 pany to divisional scale, without one accident that caused casualties.  Practice
 proves that if the exercise is well organized and positive measures are taken,
 accidents can be avoided.  We also see that only a unit that dares to'temper itself
 in peacetime can'reduce its casualties in wartime, paying a small price for a big
 victory.
 Third is the idea of seeking an' easy life and fearing trouble.  To organize a train-
 ing examination based on the standards of actual combat, one must beforehand go into
 the-field and survey the terrain, choose a site, scale mountains and ford streams,
 formulate a plan and concretely carry out a program, and judge standards.  The work
 is complex, the organization of the examination is difficult, and it requires arduous
 labor.   It will not do to seek an easy life and fear trouble.   We only need to know
 that whether a unit's training can be carried out in peacetime has a direct bearing
 on whether it can be led to victory in wartime, on whether it can complete the com-
 bat mission given to it by the party and the people.   By keeping the overall
 situation in mind, hardship and fatigue will not be things to fuss about.

 EDITORIAL CALLS ON PLA TO OBEY PARTY ORDERS
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 2 Feb 81 pp 1-2
 [Editorial: "Unify the Thinking and Actions of Army Units with the Party's Line,
 Principles and Policies"]
 [Text]   The PLA General Political Department is holding an all-army political work
 conference with the study and implementation of the guidelines of the central work
 conference as its central theme, calling for a thorough study of how to greatly
 strengthen army political work under the new situation, how to uphold the four
 basic principles and how to urge the army units to think and act in a way
 consistent with the party's line, principles and policies.  This is a very
 significant guarantee for cadres and fighters to take a step forward in the
 achievement of political unity with the party Central Committee, to fulfill
 successfully all missions assigned to our army by the party Central Committee and
 its Military Commission and to accelerate the building of a modern revolutionary
 army.
 Our army is a revolutionary armed group devoted to implementing the party's
 political task under the absolute leadership of the party.   How to make our army
 units think and act in a way consistent with the party's line, principles and
 policies is the basic objective of our army's political work and a reflection of
 our army's excellent tradition.   Since the day our army founded and developed this
 political work for the revolution, it has consistently emphasized the need to
 educate our army units in the party's program, principles and policies so that
 they will pledge their loyalty to the absolute leadership of the party.   This.
 point has been profoundly emphasized and set forth unequivocally in works by
 Comrade Mao Zedong and other revolutionaries of the older generation and in the
 regulations governing the political work of our army.   During the long period of
 struggle waged by our army, which spans over a half century, it has always thought
 and acted in a way pointed out by the party Central Committee and has never failed
 to obey its correct orders in action.   For this reason, it has become a powerful
 revolutionary army of total devotion to the people's cause such as has never
 before appeared in Chinese history.
 Today when we reach a new turning point in history, it is particularly significant
 .to emphasize the necessity of making all our army units think and act in a way
 consistent with the party's line, principles and policies and to take a step
 forward in achieving political unity with the party Central Committee.   Since the
 30 Plenary Session of the 11th party Central Committee, the party Central

 Committee has reaffirmed and set forth its ideological, political and
 organizational line, and promulgated a series of new policies in the political,
 economic and cultural fields.  Through practice, this line and principles and
 policies have been proven to be effective and completely correct, and therefore,
 have won the broadest support of our people and our army commanders and fighters.
 The major policy adopted by the central work conference last December with the aim
 of further readjusting the economy and bringing about greater political stability
 has also proved to be the only correct political and economical policy for our
 country at present.   In order to meet the new challenges, to keep ourselves
 abreast of the constant development of the new situation, to strengthen
 effectively political work, to use the line, principles and policies adopted since
 the Third Plenum to arm the minds of cadres and fighters, and to help our army
 units raise their consciousness to the need to implement the guidelines of the
 central work conference, we must consider it absolutely necessary and urgent to
 improve our army work.  We must consider organizing the study of the line,
 principles and policies adopted since the Third Plenum and their implementation,
 as well as the study and implementation of the guidelines of the central work
 conference to be the primary duty of party committees at all levels and leading
 cadres, and the central theme of our current political work and political
 education.
 While studying the central documents and trying to grasp their spirit and essence,
 we must concentrate special attention on grasping the general guiding thought of
 the Third Plenum, and deepen our understanding of the guidelines of the central
 work conference -in light of the developing and changing situation.  The guiding
 thought of the Third Plenum embodies the principles of "emancipating the mind,
 starting up the machinery, seeking truth from facts, uniting and looking forward,
 studying the new situation and seeking solutions for new problems."  The guiding
 principle of economic construction set forth by the Third Plenum actually resulted
 from an accurate review of experiences and lessons our country has accumulated in
 economic work during the past 31 years, and a full-scale assessment of the current
 situation of our country which takes into account such essential conditions as
 large population, a backward economy, and low-level science, technology, education
 and culture.   This guiding principle represents a step forward in implementing the
 guiding thought of the Third Plenum which calls for seeking truth from facts and
 correcting leftist errors, and is therefore entirely consistent with the series of
 policies adopted since the Third.Plenum.   Practice shows that as long as we grasp
 the guiding thought of the Third Plenum, we will be able to correctly assess the
 domestic economic and political situation, and accurately comprehend the policies
 adopted by the party Central Committee.   Only thus can we truly think in a way
 consistent with the party's line, principles and policies.
 It must be emphasized that the four basic principles--the socialist road, the
 people's democratic dictatorship or the dictatorship of the proletariat, party
 leadership and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought--are principles that have long
 been consistently upheld by our party.    Whether the four basic principles can be
 upheld will have a bearing on the future and destiny of our party and state.
 Since the Third Plenum, our party has put into effect an ideological line, a'
 political line and an organizational line and a series of principles and policies,
 all of which have been formulated in coordination with the new situation and under

 the guidance of the four basic principles and all of which are designed to better
 implement the four basic principles under the new situation.   Only by correctly
 assessing and firmly grasping the four basic principles and acknowledging
 consistency between the four basic principles on the one.hand and the line,
 principles and policies adopted since the Third Plenum on the other can we
 .thoroughly understand and better implement the party's line, principles and
 policies and convert them into a weapon to recognize, criticize and overcome all
 forms of erroneous ideology.  In this connection, our assertion that we must
 maintain political unity with the party Central Committee means firmly upholding
 the four basic principles, and acting in a way consistent with the line,
 principles and policies adopted since the Third Plenum.   For the time being, it
 means resolutely implementing policies approved by the central work conference.
 This is the aim and objective of our political work.   The current all-army
 political work conference has listed the study of how to publicize and implement
 the four basic principles as its basic guiding thought and main content of
 discussion.   This is indeed a very timely and necessary action.
 The key to success in making our army units think and act in a way consistent with
 the party's line, principles and policies rests with a conscientious effort to
 study and profoundly understand the spirit and essence of the party Central
 Committee documents, to wield these ideological weapons well, and to use them as a
 basis for maintaining rapport with reality, for carrying out work with a well-
 defined objective in mind, for solving problems effectively, and for strengthening
 the militant character of our ideological and political work.   The objective of
 thinking and acting in a united way cannot be achieved if we just echo what the
 books say, if we discuss matters of common interest in general terms, if we
 present our views in a purely philosophical way, if we do everything as a matter
 of formality, and if we fail to keep in touch with reality.   Our discussion on
 maintaining contact with reality means maintaining contact with specific units and
 departments, and especially with what one really has in mind with regard to work.
 How far we have gone in understanding the line, principles and policies adopted
 since the Third Plenum, what results we have produced from their implementation,
 what experiences and lessons we have drawn from this endeavor, and what
 shortcomings, misunderstandings and miscomprehensions, misgivings or even
 conflicts of interest we still have--all these must be reviewed and examined.  We
 must focus attention on eliminating the "leftist" influence, and overcoming other
 erroneous tendencies.  We must consider it necessry to launch criticism and
 self-criticism, so that we can think everything over clearly, and get everything
 done spontaneously.   We must give those comrades who do not understand well the
 party's principles and policies an opportunity to raise their political
 consciousness and permit them to reflect some of their opinions and suggestions to
 higher authorities.   In the course of study, we must keep our minds open, and
 improve our ways of thinking in a united way through the discussion and study of
 different opinions.   The principle that "the individual is subordinate to the
 organization, the minority is subordinate to the majority, the lower level is
 subordinate to the higher level, and the entire membership is subordinate to the
 Central Committee" should be strictly observed at all times.   No one should be
 permitted to criticize any decisions once they are made by the party Central
 Committee; nor should anyone be allowed to make critical speeches and spread
 antagonistic statements inside and outside the party.   We must clearly understand
 the effect that various social trends of thought may have on our army units.  We
 must actively take action to educate, criticize and wage the necessary ideological

 struggle against those who speak and act in violation of the party's line,
 principles and policies and the four basic principles.   These are violations that
 cannot be tolerated.
 In studying the central documents and in conducting education in the party's line,
 principles and policies, it is extremely important to educate cadres, especially
 leading cadres at the regiment and higher levels in this field.   Leading cadres
 are urged to study well and clarify their thinking.  Only in this way can they
 lead army units to study well, help them solve problems in connection with
 reality, and act as models in guiding them to firmly implement the party's line,
 principles and policies.   Education must be conducted on a level-by-level basis
 until cadres at all levels can take turns in receiving training.  Leading cadres
 must first study well before beginning a lecture tour of the army units explaining
 to them the party's principles and policies and answering questions raised by
 them.  We must teach cadres to firmly believe that the leadership provided by the
 party Central Committee and the party's line, principles and policies adopted
 since the Third Plenum are corrected.   It is necessary to resolutely implement the
 major policies approved by the central work conference to do everything, consider
 problems and carry out work from the standpoint of the overall interest of further
 readjusting the economy and bringing about greater political stability.   It is
 necessary to take into account this overall interest, subordinate local interests
 to it, and strive to meet and benefit this overall interest rather than impair it
 in the slightest way, no matter what we do.   Yielding local interests to
 revolutionary interests, putting the overall interest of the revolution above all
 else, and consciously implementing the party's line, principles and policies have
 become an excellent tradition of our party.   But following the 10 years of
 catastrophe, this tradition has been trampled underfoot.   Today, the moment has
 come for us to reeducate our army units, especially cadres, in this excellent
 tradition in conjunction with the new situation.
 To make the party's line, principles and policies truly take root in the army,
 party committees at all levels must persist in seeking truth from facts, and in
 upholding the mass line, and must abandon the general method of work.   Isn't it
 true that since the 30 Plenary Session of the 11th party Central Committee,
 repeated efforts have been made to promote the study of the new situation and seek
 solutions for new problems?  How much has been actually done by party committees
 at all levels should be conscientiously examined through the study of the
 documents on the central work conference.   Further efforts must also be made to
 study ways to thoroughly implement such documents.   The series of new policies
 adopted by the party Central Committee reflect a law and a remarkable spirit in
 this new period of history.  If we still think and act in the same old way, we
 will be unable to keep abreast of the developing new situation, nor will we be
 able to meet the needs of the party Central Committee's policy decisions.   Party
 committees and leading cadres at all levels must continue to emancipate their
 minds, stimulate their revolutionary spirit, carry forward the work style of hard
 struggle, maintain rapport with reality, keep in close touch with the masses,
 conduct investigations and study, understand and control the trends of thought
 among the army units, size up the new situation, seek solutions for new problems,
 and suggest effective measures for examination and implementation by army units.
 Only in this way can we implement the guidelines of the central work conference in
 coordination with the actual needs of our army units, and help them greatly
 improve their ways of thinking and rectify their work style.   Since the third

 Plenum, great changes have taken place and great progress has been made on the
 political and economic fronts throughout the country.   Both the economic situation
 and the situation of political stability have been faring better and better year
 'after year.  To us, an overall and correct understanding of this situation seems
 necessary.  Only by assessing it in the same way as the party Central Committee
 does, can we think and act in a way consistent with the party's line, principles
 and policies.   The PLA is a revolutionary army led by the CCP, a strong pillar of
 the people's democratic dictatorship or the dictatorship of the proletariat, which
 must assume the historical mission to defend the motherland and protect the four
 modernizations programs.  We must think and act in a way consistent with the
 party's line, principles and policies, obey orders of the party Central Committee
 in all our actions, and act as models in implementing the party's line, principles
 and policies, and in enhancing stability and unity.  Only in this way can we make
 a greater contribution to the party and people.

 CHINA PUBLISHES ENGLISH LANGUAGE DAILY
 Hong Kong ASIAWEEK in English 12 Jun 81 p 35
 [Text]
 Last week, China marked a milestone
 in its press history: the first English
 language  daily  newspaper  since  the
 founding of the People's Republic in 1949
 was launched on June 1. The China Daily,
 an eight-page broadsheet, is being dis-
 tributed outside as well as in China; it will
 serve as the Peking government's official
 organ in communications with the rest of
 the world. Primarily aimed at foreign
 residents and tourists in China, the paper
 will strive to avoid the heavy-handed
 ideological writing that dominates its
 sister publication, the People's Daily.
 The editors are determined to produce a
 first-rate, readable journal. Published five
 times a week, from Tuesday to Saturday,
 the China Daily gives prominence to
 international news, devoting the front and
 back pages to coverage of major domestic
 and foreign events. The second page is
 given to finance and economics, with
 special columns on such capitalist
 phenomena as stock and commodities
 markets. Opposite that is a page of
 domestic news, with a focus on'Peking,
 while the fourth page is reserved for
 editorial commentary and readers' cor-
 respondence. "The Arts," reads the
 banner across page five, and the last few
 pages are filled with features entertain-
 ment listings and sports news horn China
 and abroad.
 Overseeing the entire endeavour is Feng
 Xiliang, a former editor of the English-
 language Peking Review. Feng's staff is
 large. by non-Chinese standards: more
 than k 120 people, of whom 0 are
 journalists, and 22 correspondents dis-
 tributed around the globe. (The People's
 Daily, by comparison, has some 1,800
 staffers, 600 of whom are involved in
 editorial work.)
 The China Daily had been on the
 drawing board for.years. Last year, the
 People's Daily's managing director, Jiang
 Muyue, and general manager, An Wenyi,
 headed an executive team which visited
 the headquarters of Australian publishers
 David Syme & Company, owners of the
 influential Melbourne Age newspaper,
 where they prepared and printed a pilot
 "dummy" of the China Daily. In May,
 trial copies based on that original dummy
 were distributed in major Chinese cities.
 While in Melbourne, the Chinese also
 worked out  a deal  with  Syme  to
 "borrow" John Lawrence of the Age as
 the Chinese paper's editorial adviser.
 Lawrence, a former director . of the
 Nigerian Institute of Journalism, ex-
 plained that initially, the Chinese would
 be relying on foreign expertise in layout
 and production matters: Obviously, the
 Chinese lean on us. No one on the staff
 has experience of Western newspaper
 practice  or methods."  Syme  repre-
 sentatives have stressed, however, that
 the editorial decision-making is entirely in
 Chinese hands. Syme's top man, Ranald
 Macdonald, emphasised: "We will have
 no say - and would not want any - in
 the editorial policy of the paper."
 Until 'editor. Feng has built up the
 paper's reporting strength, he will be
 relying mostly on dispatches from China's
 official Xinhua News Agency. Chen
 ?Long, Xinhua's director in charge of
 external news services, told Asia week:
 "We're doing as much as we can, but of
 course, we are short of hands, and our
 emphasis on brief domestic stories for an
 international service isn't entirely suitable
 for the new daily." Admits Chen: "For
 many years during that long catastrophe

 [the untruths ltor the masses tat j home and
 abroad." But since the fall of the Gang of
 Four in 1976, claims Chen, Xinhua has
 "stopped feeding lies. We recognise it is
 important for our 'credibility that we
 uphold the truth."
 A glance through the China Daily's
 trial issues reveals that the editors are
 clearly striving to keep the paper from
 becoming a propaganda sheet. Yet they
 will encounter some problems. For ex-
 ample, a front-page article from the
 Apr. 19 issue, "Lashing Out at Kuomin-
 tang," says: "It is sheer day-dreaming for
 the Taiwan authorities to try to impose
 their reactionary rule upon the people on
 the mainland, local observers said."
 Despite these perhaps inevitable dif-
 ficulties, the China Daily is expected to
 attain a circulation of 50,000 by year's
 end from an initial run of 20,000. As
 Syme Media 'Enterprises (HK) Ltd. has
 concluded, it may prove a significant
 products forum; the subsidiary of
 Australia's Age group has secured rights
 to market up to 85% of the total
 advertising space available. (The rest will
 go to domestic producers.) The advertise-
 ments, selling for USS6.50 per column
 centimetre, will appear in fixed spaces
 over six pages of the newspaper; neither
 the front nor opinion pages will carry
 ads. Syme already distributes in China a
 magazine on technology. One executive
 CSO:  4020/375
 boasted that the  "biggest problem"
 for advertisers in that publication is
 "coping with the flood of replies gener-
 ated by every issue. The Chinese have
 a tremendous  thirst  for  knowledge,
 especially about technical matters."
 Itself not a step behind the times in
 things technical, the China Daily has a
 production system that utilises some of
 the most up-to-date equipment, such as
 U.S.-made Compugraphic photo type-
 setting machines. It is printed on the
 People's Daily's four double-width
 Metroliner web-offset presses, which are
 reputedly Capable of rolling off 400,000
 copies an hour. As its circulation' in-
 creases, the English daily may also make
 use of its  sister outfit's  impressive
 distribution network, which has 6-7m'
 copies of the People's Daily delivered
 each day to cadres and commoners from
 Shanghai to Xinjiang.
 The China Daily is an ambitious
 project, but one.unlikely'to fail. For the
 estimated 40,000 foreigners living in
 China and the 200,000 tourists who visit it
 annually, it is a welcome - and unique -
 opportunity 'to catch up with the outside
 world. And for the 25 million Chinese
 who are 'studying English, it not only
 offers a good chance to practise reading
 skills, but is an exciting symbol of their
 nation's new outward-looking approach
 to the world.                      ^
