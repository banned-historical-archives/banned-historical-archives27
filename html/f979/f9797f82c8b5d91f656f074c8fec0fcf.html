 Means to Many Ends
 Key Judgments      In the seven years since the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of
 Information available Cambodia, the Chinese have regularly initiated scattered, small-scale

 forced Hanoi to keep its best troops along the Chinese frontier and
 unavailable for duty in Cambodia. Over the past 18 months, however, we
 have seen a shift in Beijing's military strategy and a greater use of the
 clashes to meet other objectives such as influencing its relations with the
 United States, the Soviet Union, and members of the Association of
 Southeast Asian Nations.                                      25X1
 The new "strategy of a thousand thorns," adopted in April 1984, involves
 the battle for and occupation of small pieces of Vietnamese territory-
 action that has provoked the Vietnamese into protracted and bloody
 combat to regain lost territory:
 ? The fighting involves hand-to-hand combat from entrenched and bun-
 kered positions as well as heavy shelling of Vietnamese villages and
 military positions.
 ? The human and materiel price has been heavy. Hundreds of battles have
 been fought and thousands of lives lost. The burden of supporting from
 50,000 to 120,000 men in the field, moreover, has caused substantial
 dislocations to the local Chinese economy.                         25X1
 The Chinese have controlled the fighting carefully, however, limiting it to a
 small salient in a remote area. By doing so, Beijing avoids the international
 condemnation and steep military costs that would come with a major
 attack on Vietnam and, at the same time, plays to the strength of Chinese
 forces in that area-nonmechanized infantry operations that do not rely on
 long logistic lines or close air support.
 Beijing is aware that such limited warfare will not force Hanoi to alter its
 Cambodia policy; indeed, the Chinese at times appear as much interested
 in the experience gained for their military modernization program as in the
 pressure exerted on Vietnam:
 ? The fighting has provided a training ground for Chinese infantry forces
 and the recently rejuvenated officer corps. Units from nearly every
 military region have rotated to the border over the past 18 months, and
 many graduates from China's military academies spend their first tour
 there.

 ? The clashes also give the Chinese the opportunity to test new military
 equipment-some of it acquired from abroad-~
 The conflict over the past 18 months has increasingly become an integral
 part of Beijing's foreign policy, influencing its relations with the United
 States, the Soviet Union, and members of the Association of Southeast
 Asian Nations. It gives China a card to play in the strategic triangle-by
 manipulating the level of fighting during high-level US or Soviet visits,
 Beijing can graphically display a congruence with US policy interests in
 Asia or, alternately, a willingness to further the dialogue with Moscow.
 The pressure on Vietnam also strengthens China's relations with ASEAN
 nations supporting the resistance effort in Cambodia
 Because Beijing believes its actions along the Vietnamese frontier meet
 important domestic and foreign policy needs, we expect the fighting will
 continue indefinitely. But we do not look for China to expand the scope of
 the fighting substantially-although it maintains the force strength and
 capability to do so-without a significant provocation, such as a major
 Vietnamese incursion into Thailand. We also believe that Hanoi will accept
 the costs of the conflict rather than escalate the tension; as long as the
 fighting remains under control, the Vietnamese will not be forced to alter
 their policy in Cambodia..

 Chinese Thorns Along
 the Vietnamese Border:
 Means to Many Ends F
 Beijing's Strategy of a Thousand Thorns
 In search of ways to continue to press Hanoi militarily
 without engaging in a politically risky and economi-
 cally debilitating full-scale war with Vietnam, Beijing
 in the spring of 1984 adopted a "strategy of a
 the strategy calls for the occupation of small
 segments of Vietnamese territory to force the Viet-
 namese to try to dislodge the occupying Chinese
 forces. By thus engaging Vietnamese forces in limited
 but protracted and bloody combat, China rejuvenated
 its Vietnam policy in a way that serves a multitude of
 functions without the international condemnation or
 financial and manpower costs that would result from
 a major Chinese attack:
 ? Border clashes compel Hanoi to keep its best divi-
 sions-at a high state of readiness-in northern
 Vietnam and unavailable for duty in Cambodia.
 ? Threats of wider warfare require Vietnam to main-
 tain a large standing army in the north, an act that
 Beijing believes bleeds the Vietnamese
 economically.
 ? Tensions with Vietnam serve as instruments of
 Chinese foreign policy, proving to the world that
 China actively opposes Vietnam's occupation of
 Cambodia and Hanoi's "collusion" with Moscow.
 ? Harassment of the Vietnamese allows Beijing to
 point to a congruence with US foreign policy in East
 Asia and has created new bonds with Thailand and
 opened doors to improving relations with other
 Southeast Asian nations.
 ? Finally, limited warfare tests the mettle of Beijing's
 rejuvenated armed forces and reminds China's
 youth of their military obligation.
 The Cambodian Connection
 Politically, China's "unheralded war" is motivated by
 a variety of factors including rival regional ambitions,
 chagrin at Hanoi's turn toward Moscow, anger over
 Vietnam's ingratitude for China's assistance during
 the Vietnam war, territorial disputes, and ethnic
 animosity. But since 1978 the "explicit" reason of-
 fered by Beijing for Sino-Vietnamese tensions has  25X1
 been the presence of Hanoi's troops in Cambodia.
 Beijing implies that Chinese-Vietnamese relations ca125X1
 be normalized-diplomatic relations have never been
 severed-only if all Vietnamese forces are withdrawn  25X1
 from Cambodia. This policy line serves Beijing well as
 it casts China's antipathy toward Vietnam in an
 international light-as opposed to simply a quarrel
 between neighbors-and reassures ASEAN and the
 Cambodian resistance of China's continued opposition
 to Vietnamese domination of Indochina
 Strategic Concerns
 Beijing first implemented its strategy on 28 April
 1984 at the height of Vietnam's 1983/84 dry season
 campaign (November-May) in Cambodia by seizing
 at least five hilltops 1 to 2 kilometers inside Vietnam's
 Ha Tuyen Province. But, even at that juncture, we
 believe Beijing had broader strategic objectives than
 Cambodia in mind:
 ? The assaults-the first division-sized attack against
 Vietnam since 1979-were timed to coincide with
 President Reagan's visit to Beijing. Reminiscent of
 China's invasion of Vietnam in 1979 on the heels of
 Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's visit to Washing-
 ton, the assaults were manipulated by Beijing to
 suggest tacit US support.
 ? Beijing also was responding to an uprecedented joint
 Soviet-Vietnamese amphibious exercise in the Gulf
 of Tonkin conducted in mid-April.
 ? Finally, Beijing signaled Moscow that it was not
 intimidated by the growing Soviet military presence
 at Cam Ranh and in the South China Sea and was
 prepared to jeopardize the planned visit of Soviet
 First Deputy Premier Arkhipov to Beijing-sched-
 uled for early May-to prove this point. Arkhipov

 These broader strategic calculations have continued
 to be major factors in China's calculus of military
 action against Vietnam. In fact, the level of fighting

 Having improved their security relation-
 ship with the United States, we believe the Chinese
 thought they were in a better position to make a few
 gestures to Moscow. Moreover, analysis of speeches
 by Chinese leaders at the time strongly suggests
 differences within the Chinese leadership, with some
 senior party figures-including Chen Yun and Peng
 Zhen-advocating a more accommodating stance to-
 ward Moscow in order to improve relations with the
 Soviet Union.
 Once Arkhipov departed China, however, Chinese

 18-month campaign in retaliation for Vietnamese

 Serving Military Modernization
 In addition to foreign policy goals, Beijing has found
 the Malipo battlefield an excellent place to advance a
 national modernization objective-the rebuilding of
 the People's Liberation Army (PLA) into a modern
 fighting force. Concerned by the deficiencies apparent
 in PLA commanders, weapons, tactics, command and
 control, and logistics during the 1979 border war,
 Deng Xiaoping is using today's battles on the Viet-
 namese border as proving grounds for the rejuvenated
 officer corps, China's better educated soldiers, and
 improved weapons.
 Careers, in fact, have already been made and lost on
 the Malipo front. Fu Quanyou, commander of Nan-
 jing's 1st Army, apparently drew Beijing's approval
 for his forces' performance in fierce battles with the
 Vietnamese in the first three months of this year. A
 Sichuan provincial newspaper reported that Fu re-
 placed Chengdu military commander Wang
 Chenghan in June. Subsequent to military region
 realignment in September, Fu was given larger re-
 sponsibility for all of southwestern China, including
 the Yunnan front on the Vietnamese border. Chinese
 press reports highlight two more junior officers who
 have received national acclaim and risen quickly
 through the ranks because of exemplary combat
 records on the Vietnamese front:
 ? Liao Xilong, 43, reportedly handpicked by Deng
 Xiaoping to be the youngest army-level commander
 in China. Liao, who probably commands the 14th
 Army in Yunnan, was commander of the division
 that first seized the Vietnamese hills in early 1984.
 ? Zhang Youxia, 34, son of a PLA general and a
 deputy division commander, probably in the 14th
 Army. He is currently studying at the prestigious
 PLA Military Academy near Beijing, the finishing
 school for China's general officers.

 Instilling Revolutionary Fervor in China's Youth
 The (Jinan) cadets displayed their fearless revolution-
 ary heroic spirit during combat. "The Chinese race
 cannot be humiliated. Our sacred territory cannot be
 abandoned." "Willingly we shed our youth blood to
 build a new great wall for defending our country". . . .
 The merits achieved by these cadets are the pride of
 the motherland .... This makes us feel that the
 youths of the 1980s are not the so-called `fallen
 generation"nor the "generation having lost faith"but
 instead are the warm-blooded sons and daughters of
 ideals and are ardently in love with the motherland.
 Jinan's Dazhong Ribao
 16 April 1985
 Dearest father and mother, I am now the only person
 left at the post and may have to sacrifice myself for
 the nation at any time .... I am not the slightest bit
 timid or afraid, because after my death there will
 still be the great motherland. . . . After my "glory"
 do not be sad for me, but be proud that I died a
 glorious martyr's death.
 Zhou Shenhui, 18-year-old awarded
 first-class honors for bravery during
 August fighting
 Hongqi, No. 21
 1 November 1985
 Early on the morning of 11 September, he and his
 comrades-in-arms were intercepted by fierce enemy
 artillery fire while moving toward position 211. Al-
 though his left arm was injured, he led the fighters to
 continue the advance .... When the enemy launched
 a further artillery bombardment, he ordered the
 fighters of the whole squad to retreat into a tunnel so
 as to reduce casualties, while he stood at the tunnel
 entrance observing enemy movements. Enemy fire

 In addition to testing officers, the border fighting is a
 useful propaganda tool to remind Chinese youths that
 they have an obligation to serve in the military. Senior
 PLA officers worry that the new opportunities avail-
 able in China's expanding economy and the lower
 prestige accorded military service recently will lead
 China's best and brightest youths away from military
 careers. Thus, a national campaign has been under
 way for the past six months-probably orchestrated to
 offset the negative publicity of the current million-
 man reduction in force-highlighting the contribution
 and sacrifices of young Chinese soldiers.
 China's choice of battlefields reflects the carefully
 calibrated pressure Beijing wishes to bring to bear on
 Vietnam. A remote and mountainous area opposite

 Three Unspoken Rules of Engagement at Malipo
 1. Chinese and Vietnamese airpower is used only for
 defensive patrols and reconnaissance, not ground
 attack or offensive strikes.
 2. Chinese artillery fire is directed against civilian
 and military targets north of Ha Giang but never
 against the city itself.
 3. Vietnamese units counterattack against Chinese
 units and military lines of communication inside
 Vietnam, but refrain from any major incursions into,
 or long-range shelling of, Malipo County.
 Malipo County, the Malipo front has hilltops that are
 of no strategic value and are not on a major invasion
 route into Vietnam. The Chinese claim, according to
 the US defense attache in Beijing, that they took the
 hills because the Vietnamese were using them to shell
 Chinese hamlets and farms. In fact, their only tactical
 significance is to provide Chinese gunners excellent
 positions from which to rain fire down on Vietnamese
 villages and troop positions.
 The 10-kilometer-wide and 5-kilometer-deep Malipo
 front does provide a veiled threat of a small "second
 lesson," for it is only 17 kilometers from Ha Giang-
 one of the provincial capitals occupied during the
 1979 invasion. But Beijing ensures that until that
 decision is made Chinese actions do not disturb the
 town of Ha Giang.
 Beijing
 appears to be concerned that artillery fire directed at
 Ha Giang might prompt the Vietnamese to mount
 major counterattacks or large artillery bombardments
 into Malipo County

 Trench Warfare
 Since April 1984, in hand-to-hand combat from en-
 trenched and bunkered positions, Chinese and Viet-
 namese infantry forces have attacked and counterat-
 tacked for control of three or four of the more
 vulnerable hilltops. A senior Vietnamese general, in
 an interview with a Western journalist, last spring
 estimated that China had fired half a million rounds
 of artillery and mortar shells into Vietnam's Ha
 Tuyen Province over the past year. Today, Chinese
 forces retain control of most higher peaks in this area
 of the border. Many of the smaller hills have traded
 hands several times

 Chinese forces have fought hundreds of battles for the
 Although the Chinese are using 122-mm, 130-mm,
 and 152-mm artillery pieces to shell the Vietnamese,
 the vast majority of rounds are fired from shorter
 range weapons such as 60-mm, 82-mm, and 120-mm
 mortars and recoilless rifles used by Chinese infantry
 regiments. The mortars have a maximum range of 6
 kilometers and are ideal for the close-infighting
 typical along the Malipo front.

 and Chinese casualties must run into the thousands.
 Anecdotal reports                     tend to
 confirm significant Chinese losses:
 A Chinese provincial radiobroadcast in June 1984
 reported on a newly designed military ambulance
 that had evacuated 500 wounded from the Malipo
 front in the first two months of fighting alone.
 Disruptions to the local Chinese economy-support-
 ing from 50,000 to 120,000 men in the field over the
 past 18 months-also appear to be substantial.
 The bloodiest fighting appears to have taken place in
 February, when the Chinese threw two divisions-or
 24,000 men-into the fray.

 If Malipo has been costly for the Chinese, Vietnam
 also has paid a high price for its stalwart defense of
 Ha Tuyen Province. Vietnamese forces-which we
 estimate to number 30,000 in the area-have not
 retreated in the face of overwhelming Chinese tactical
 superiority.
 The border also is providing an excellent proving
 ground for new equipment, some of it acquired from
 abroad. Chinese television broadcasts over the past
 summer have shown Chinese soldiers near Malipo
 using hand-held laser rangefinders and short-range
 radios produced by the Israeli defense manufacturer,
 And Military Benefits
 The Chinese military press increasingly is highlight-
 ing the Vietnamese border fighting both for its value
 as a training ground for Chinese infantry forces and
 as an international political statement. A 7 April
 article in the Liberation Army Daily boasted that the
 border fighting. has "trained a new generation of
 reliable soldiers."
 Using the Vietnam conflict as a training ground is, in
 fact, Chinese military policy. China's aging high
 command is well aware of the lack of combat experi-
 ence in the ground forces and appears to relish the
 chance to test the mettle of its recently rejuvenated
 officer corps.

 to open up any new salients.2 There would be little
 additional political mileage to be gained because
 Beijing seeks to avoid criticism that it is the aggressor;
 also, a new front would create an additional drain on
 Chinese economic resources. A new front in Guangxi
 Province would also be closer to traditional invasion
 routes, and, given Vietnamese sensitivity, China can-
 not be sure that it could control a conflict in that area.
 The Chinese military, moreover, needs no new south-
 ern training ground because it has been able to rotate
 sufficient units and officers through Malipo. Finally,
 the tenacity with which the Vietnamese have fought
 against numerically superior forces for the hilltops of
 Ha Tuyen Province will give the Chinese leadership
 pause before contemplating the opening of any new
 "running sores" along the Sino-Vietnamese frontier.
 The Chinese will, however, periodically conduct
 saber-rattling operations along the length of the bor-
 der to remind Hanoi that China has other options and
 perha s to test Vietnamese defenses.
 Short of a major Vietnamese incursion into Thailand,
 however, China is unlikely to expand the scope of the
 real fighting beyond Malipo. Beijing cannot afford to
 sidetrack its economic modernization program with
 an expensive "second lesson" against Vietnam. More-
 over, with the major increase in Vietnamese troop'
 strength since 1979 along the China-Vietnam bor-
 der-and the marked improvement in equipment and
 training supplied by the Soviet Union-Beijing would

 The View From Hanoi
 0
 We believe that Vietnamese forces will continue to
 react strongly to Chinese forays on the tactical level.
 The "thousand thorns," however, are likely to have
 little effect on Vietnamese policy. Beijing's actions did
 not deter Hanoi's largest dry-season offensive in six
 years, and we detect no effort now to move additional
 Hanoi's leaders appear to be gauging correctly the
 limits of the Chinese strategy and display confidence
 that local commanders can successfully manage the
 pressure. We foresee no Vietnamese effort to match
 the Chinese buildup opposite Ha Tuyen Province, an
 area of limited strategic significance. China's policy
 of keeping border tensions within carefully controlled
 bounds-not building up, for example, along tradi-
 tional invasion corridors-has not been lost on Hanoi
 who has no compelling reason to respond in kind to
 Chinese provocations.
