 The USSR is continuing to play down the threatening
 aspects of its Berlin policy.                                                                             Soviet propaganda welcomed
 statements by President Eisenhower and Prime Minister
 Macmillan on a summit meeting but pictured the United
 States as having been forced into negotiations.                                                                                      In a
 major shift in Bonn's foreign policy, Chancellor Adenauer
 has indicated his willingness to extend de facto recogni-
 tion to East Germany in exchange for a guarantee of the
 status quo in Berlin.  The four-month truce in West German
 politics on foreign policy was ended by the publication
 of a new Social Democratic plan for unification and Euro-
 pean security.                  Adenauer's sharp rejection of this plan
 may provoke the first major foreign policy debate in West
 Germany since the beginning of the Berlin crisis.
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS .
 Iraq's withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact meets one of
 the Iraqi Communist demands and undercuts Nasir's charge
 that the Qasim regime was still attached to the "imperi-
 alists."  Nasir's anti-Communist campaign continues un-
 abated and is receiving widespread support in other Arab
 countries.  However, various Afro-Asian neutrals have
 become disturbed by the UAR-Iraq split, and a number of
 offers of "good offices" have been madle to restore friendly
 relations.  Moscow has continued to meet Nasir's attacks
 head on, but Soviet leaders apparently hope that the po-
 lemics will subside without a further deterioration in
 relations with Cairo.  Various elements in Jordan apparently
 are continuing to maneuver in the absence of King Husayn
 THE SITUATION IN TIBET .  .  .  .

 The unrest which erupted in Lhasa on 20 March appears
 to have quieted.   While Peiping will undoubtedly increase
 its efforts to wipe out the remaining Tibetan dissidence,
 guerrilla activity in outlying parts of Tibet and western
 China is expected to continue for some time.  The Dalai
 Lama was headed for the Indian border on 26 March.  The
 Indian Government is gravely concerned over the situation
 in Tibet, fearing its relations with Communist China will
 be endangered.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 DEVELOPMENTS IN FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALAND .  .  .  Page 1
 The ruling white minority in the Federation of Rho-
 desia and Nyasaland has reacted to the challenge of local
 African nationalism by demonstrating a determination to
 maintain its position.   In Southern Rhodesia, the govern-
 ment has put into effect regulations which infringe on
 civil rights and is enacting legislation to make them
 permanent.  The white voters in Northern Rhodesia have
 given overwhelming support to federal Prime Minister
 Welensky's firm racial policies.  The recent events
 seem likely to increase the doubt of both the Africans
 and the British in the present federation's ability
 to handle independence in 1960.
 .  Page 2
 Despite the exchange of recriminations between Moscow
 and Cairo over Nasir's anti-Qasim campaign, the Soviet
 Union is continuing to meet its obligations under its
 various economic and military assistance agreements with
 the UAR.   Soviet leaders probably want to avoid the effect
 which an abrupt move to cut off further aid to the UAR
 would have on other Asian and African states.   Should
 Nasir persist in his present tactics, however, Moscow
 might retaliate by threatening to withhold aid or stalling
 on the implementation of the aid agreements.
 AFRO-ASIAN ECONOMIC CONFERENCE .  .
 Sentiment is growing among the "Bandung countries"
 for an Afro-Asian economic conference,, first proposed two
 years ago by Ceylon's Prime Minister Bandaranaike.  Repre-
 sentatives of the five Colombo powers---India, Pakistan,
 Ceylon, Burma, and Indonesia--are to meet in May to plan
 such a conference, which Bandaranaike hopes will be held
 later this year.  The conference would deal with a wide
 range of economic topics but no "political" issues.
 ISRAELI-FRENCH RELATIONS .  .
 Israel's extreme rightist Herut party, which is
 calling for a formal alliance with France, apparently
 hopes to make this an issue in the Israeli parliamentary
 election campaign this year.  French Deputy Premier
 Soustelle has in the past advocated an alliance as a
 means of countering Nasir's support of the Algerian
 rebels.  The French and Israeli governments, however,

 The USSR on 19 March agreed at the Geneva talks tothe
 Western draft articles on duration of the proposed treaty
 for cessation of nuclear testing and on periodic review of
 the control system.      The Soviet leader:  probably believe
 this demonstration of willingness to make concessions in
 important East-West negotiations will increase pressure
 on the West to agree to Soviet demands on the agenda and
 composition of high-level East-West talks.       They probably
 also believe their concession on these important points
 will place the USSR in a better position when the talks
 reconvene on 13 April to demand concessions from the
 West on the issue of voting in the control commission.
 BRITAIN'S PROBLEM IN MALTA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 5
 Britain is making only slow progress toward a new
 constitution for Malta, site of its principal Mediterranean
 naval base, and toward diversifying the crown colony's
 economy.  Following former Prime Minister Mintoff's
 repeated rejection of British plans for constitutional
 reforms short of outright independence, London has been
 ruling the island directly while attempting to introduce
 much-needed fiscal reforms.  During the transfer on 30
 March of the naval dockyards to a civilian firm, Mintoff
 may try to further his independence campaign by inciting
 the dockworkers--whom he closely controls--to violence.
 PORTUGAL TIGHTENING INTERNAL SECURITY   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 6
 The recent creation of new top posts in the Portuguese
 security forces indicates that the government is seeking
 to strengthen its ability to deal with subversive action.
 Premier Salazar is probably especially anxious to ensure
 political stability in the event he should decide to des-
 ignate a successor soon.

 the USSR State Planning Committee (Gosplan) and the

 downgraded from deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers
 to minister.
 GOMULKA DOMINATES POLISH PARTY CONGRESS   .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  Page  8
 Gomulka succeeded at the third congress of the Polish
 Communist party in establishing himself as undisputed mas-
 ter in the party.  The congress cleared him and his ad-
 herents of the charges of "right-wing nationalist devi-
 ations'" brought against him in 1958, and men who opposed
 Gomulka in the past either made their peace with him or
 were dropped from important party positions.  The moderate
 Polish internal policies adopted at the congress contrast
 markedly with domestic policies elsewhere in the bloc,arid
 this may lead to renewed friction with other Communist
 regimes.
 SOVIET DELEGATION COMPLETES INDIAN VISIT .         .  .  .  .  .  Page 10
 The Soviet Government delegation which completed a
 three-week visit to India on 19 March sought to assuage
 recent frictions and to survey political and economic
 conditions.   It does not appear, however, to have made
 a significant impact on either official or public opin-
 FRENCH POSITION IN INDOCHINA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 11
 President de Gaulle views the former French terri-
 tories in Indochina as a sphere in which French prestige
 and influence should be expanded. His goal seems to be
 an association of Laos and Cambodia-with the new French
 Community.  France, while refusing to cooperate with
 the United States in training for the Laotian Army, has
 offered to send additional military instructors to Laos.
 PLOTTING AGAINST CARIBBEAN DICTATORSHIPS .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  Page 11
 Two long-time militant enemies of Latin American
 dictatorships, Venezuelan President Betancourt and former
 Costa Rican President Figueres, have grave misgivings
 concerning the methods and objectives of the latest
 leader of the crusade against dictator, Cuban Prime
 Minister Fidel Castro.  Figueres went to Havana on 20
 March in an apparently unsuccessful effort to dissuade
 Castro from supporting pro-Communist Nicaraguan and

 for his own revolutionary plans.   Basic differences be-

 THE NEW COLOMBIAN CABINET   . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 12
 The appointment on 23 March of a new Colombian cabi-
 net with broader Conservative representation will probably
 strengthen the eight-month-old National Front government
 of Conservatives and Liberals and may reduce the political
 tension and uncertainty of the past few weeks.  President
 Lleras' recent declaration that he would resign if the
 coalition failed has evoked a reaffirmation of support for
 the National Front from his own Liberal party.
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 NATO'S TENTH ANNIVERSARY OUTLOOK .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 NATO's basic problem continues to be its members'
 tendency to deal with domestic political pressures at the
 expense of the alliance's military preparedness.  Belgium
 and Denmark are preparing to reduce conscription periods,
 similar moves may occur in Luxembourg and the Netherlands,
 and Britain plans to end conscription in 1960.  As NATO
 enters its second decade--an event coincident with the
 foreign ministers' 2-4 April meeting in Washington--basic
 assumptions of the alliance are being challenged for the
 first time by a series of French actions, including the
 withdrawal of the French Mediterranean fleet from NATO
 command.

 PART III (continued)
 THE RISE AND FALL OF THE POLISH WORKERS' COUNCILS   .  .  .  .  Page
 The Gomulka government dealt the Polish Workers'
 Councils a final blow as a potentially effective instru-
 ment for worker participation in industrial management with
 the passage on 20 December 1958 of a law on Worker Self-
 Government Conferences.  The councils, created in the
 revolutionary fervor of 1956 prior to Gomulka's take-over,
 failed to fulfill the overoptimistic and unrealistic expec-
 tations of the workers, contributed little to productivity
 and labor discipline, and rarely developed into organs for
 the effective participation of rank-and-file workers in
 industrial management.  The party could not safely tolerate
 the growth of organizations that might develop into inde-
 pendent power centers.
 PEIPING'S DOCTRINAL CLAIMS AND SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS .  .  . Page    9
 The ideological disagreement between Peiping and
 Moscow over the imminence of pure Communism in China and
 the role of communes as a device for attaining that goal
 culminated last month in Chinese pronouncements that the
 USSR still sets the pace and the pattern throughout the
 orbit for progress toward the ultimate state envisioned
 by Marx, Engels, and Lenin.  The junior partner, probably
 bitter over the forced retreat, retains its communes, not
 as an internationally applicable breakthrough toward
 Communism itself, but as a peculiarly Chinese innovation
 required by local conditions.

 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST NEGOTIATIONS
 While awaiting the Western
 replies to the Soviet note of
 2 March, Soviet propaganda
 media,  following the line set
 in Khrushchev's press confer-
 ence on 19 March,  are playing
 down the threatening aspects
 of the USSR's position on Ber-
 lin and emphasizing the favor-
 able prospects for negotiations
 created by Moscow's initiatives.
 Moscow  claims  that Pres-
 ident Eisenhower acid -Prime
 Minister Macmillan have, under
 the pressure of world opinion,
 at last accepted the Soviet pro-
 posal for a                     summit  meeting.
 Soviet  media  also   stress
 alleged differences   between
 American and British views and
 state  that   the "main result"
 of the talks between the two
 Western leaders was Macmillan's
 success in persuading Presi-
 dent Eisenhower to agree to
 summit talks independent of the
 outcome of a preliminary for-
 eign ministers' conference.
 Moscow  is   seeking   to
 create a picture of a reluc-
 tant United              States  being
 forced into summit talks against
 its  will.  A TASS dispatch
 states that Washington views
 negotiations with Moscow "more
 as an inevitable evil than as
 a necessary means for the peace-
 ful settlement of European prob-
 lems."
 .  While welcoming the Eisen-
 hower-Macmillan statement on a
 summit meeting as a "favorable
 development," Soviet propaganda
 complained that the two leaders
 failed to advance any new pro-
 posals on Berlin  or  other
 international problems.   Izves-
 tia warned that any attempt to
 link a summit meeting with the
 outcome of a foreign ministers'
 conference would "complicate"
 the task of summit talks and
 might even doom them to failure.
 A Czech newspaper said,  "It is
 obviously illusory to expect
 the foreign ministers to reach
 agreement on outstanding issues
 prior to a meeting at the sum-
 mit."
 Bloc propaganda has also
 criticized the West's alleged
 position on the composition of
 East-West meetings.  Moscow
 charged that  President Eisen-
 hower and Prime Minister Mac-
 millan "took the  line  of
 discrimination" in  insisting
 that Polish and Czechoslovak
 representatives could  partic-
 ipate                                                         in a foreign ministers'
 conference only as observers.
 Warsaw radio dismissed these
 terms as "definitely unaccept-
 able" and said Poland and Czech-
 os].ovakia expect "full member-
 ship."  Khrushchev, however, in
 his recent press conference was
 careful not to foreclose the
 possibility of a compromise on
 the parity question. He.refused
 to  answer  a  question on this
 issue, stating, "It is a matter
 for discussions between govern-
 ments."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 March 1959
 General business conditions
 in West' Berlin have not changed
 markedly over the past week and
 there are some signs of a re-
 cent slight upturn in economic
 activity.   American officials in
 Berlin continue to receive fur-
 ther reports that orders for
 heavy industry are declining.
 A steel company, for example,
 Iraq
 Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim
 has explained that Iraq with-
 drew formally from the Baghdad
 Pact 11 months before the ex-
 piration of the pact's  first
 five-year term only after long
 study and much concern.   As
 Qasim has said, however, with-
 drawal from the pact was one of
 the original aims of the 14
 July revolution, and it would
 seem that other  motives  led
 Qasim to make the move at this
 time.  Qasim has recently been
 pressed by both the Communists
 and President  Nasir to make
 this break--the Communists pre-
 sented it as one of their de-
 mands which could  no longer
 wait, and Nasir cited Iraq's.:
 membership in the pact as evi-
 dence that Qasim is a party in
 the "Zionist-imperialist-Com-
 munist-opportunist" conspiracy
 against the Arabs.
 If Communist pressure was
 the decisive factor,. Qasim may
 soon accede to other more sig-
 nificant  Communist  demands,
 which include  arming  the Pop-
 ular  Resistance  Force   (PRF)
 and executing imprisoned lead-
 ers of the former Nuri govern-
 ment.   Arms are beginning to be
 seen in the hands of PRF mem-
 bers in Baghdad, but it is not
 confirmed that the arms have
 been regularly issued.
 Regarding the fate of the
 imprisoned "traitors," UAR re-
 ports                                                                     that  some individuals
 have  been  executed  have not
 been proved.  However, Commu-
 nist                                                             pressure  is  believed
 to  be responsible. for  a de-
 cision  last                                                               week  to. bring
 to  trial  certain  members of
 the Nuri-government  who  had
 been released  on  bail, and
 who it was  thought  might go
 free,  Proceedings for  their
 trial, however,   have been in-
 terrupted    by                                                                the  trial  of
 officers  engaged in the  Mo-

 dence of a resumption of serious

 by 50 percent in April and even
 more in May, putting the firm

 Other firms in structural steel
 report that they are receiving
 no benefits from Bonn's program
 of giving new orders to Berlin.
 An increasing number of small
 firms are applying for permits
 to ship their equipment out of
 Berlin.
 The'latest banking figures
 show further declines in savings
 and time deposits.   Some of this
 is attributable to withdrawals
 of savings by East Germans. Sav-
 ings are now $4,500,000 under
 the level of 31 October 1958.

 disorders anywhere in Iraq, the
 Qasim regime evidently remains
 apprehensive. An area around
 the town of Khanaquin, near the
 Iranian border and athwart the
 only direct route from Iran to
 Baghdad, was declared a prohib-
 ited area to vehicular traffic
 early this week.
 USSR-UAR Relations
 Moscow has continued to
 meet Nasir's anti-Qasimr, anti-
 Communist attacks head'on, but
 Soviet leaders apparently hope
 that the polemics will subside
 without a further deterioration
 in relations with Cairo. Khru-
 shchev, in response to a ques-
 tion at his 19 March press con-
 ference regarding differences
 with the UAR over Iraq, stated
 that the Soviet Union can main-
 tain friendly relations with
 both Arab countries because of
 its policy of "nonintervention"
 in the internal afffairs.of
 other states.
 Khrushchev went on, how-
 ever, to criticize Nasir's reac-
 tion to his earlier statement
 of.16 March on the subject,
 charging that the UAR President
 --whom he described as "young
 and passionate"--"went into a
 passion."  Western journalists
 who were present report that
 Khrushchev observed that Nasir
 has taken on "more than his
 stature permits," and that he
 thereby "might strain himself,"
 but these remarks were subse-
 quently toned down in the TASS
 version of Khrushchev's remarks.
 One Soviet broadcast in Arabic
 also softened his remarks by
 pleading that they were made
 "under the pressure of other
 considerations."
 Soviet commentaries on
 Nasir's charges against Qasim
 and Arab Communists stress that
 they can only aid "imperialism"
 and Israel, and welcome Arab
 League offers to mediate Cairo's
 differences with Baghdad. Mos-
 cow's broadcasts to Arab audi-
 ences also charge that Khru-
 shchev's remarks on the subject
 are being distorted by UAR of-
 ficials and propagandists in an
 effort to worsen UAR relations
 with the Soviet Union.
 Nasir continued to conduct
 his anti-Communist campaign from
 Syria, which some observers feel
 may become the most important
 arena in his struggle with
 Qasim.  Nasir's most telling
 barbs last week were aimed at
 Moscow, however.  On 20 March
 he stated publicly for the first
 time that the Soviet warning to
 the West at the time of the
 Sues, war did not help the UAR,
 and that the USSR would not
 have! acted forcefully against
 Western intervention in Iraq.
 A Soviet broadcast in Arabic on
 24 March called this statement
 a "lie."
 Nasir also  replied  to
 Khrushchev's description of him
 by asserting that were it not
 for these qualities in.the Arab
 people there would today be in
 the Arab states Western missile
 bases aimed against the Soviet
 Union.
 The religious leaders of
 Al Azhar University in Cairo
 have been persuaded to denounce
 "thee instigators of chaos, de-
 struction, and atheism," and
 the sheik of the university
 has  declared  a  "holy  war"
 against the "campaign of athe-
 ism and corruption."

 also using the anti-Communist
 campaign as an opportunity for

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 a general tightening of se-
 curity in the Syrian region.
 On 24 March the secretary
 general of the Syrian  trade
 unions announced that the unions
 .had decided to expel the Com-
 munist elements from membership
 so that the unions could join
 other organizations and better
 participate in the "struggle"
 against Communism and "faction-
 alism,"  This may be a concealed
 effort by the government to
 bring about a reorganization
 of the Syrian trade unions along
 lines which have transformed
 the Egyptian unions into a kind
 of "popular demonstration" arm
 of the Nasir regime.
 Nasir's anti-Communist cam-
 paign has received almost unan-
 imous support in other Arab
 countries;   The degree of en-
 thusiasm has ranged from re-
 strained approval to violent
 demonstrations of support.  An
 outstanding exception, however,
 is Jordan, where "Nasirism" re-
 mains officially the paramount
 threat to the established order.
 Four days of intense anti-
 Communist, anti-Iraqi demonstra-
 tions in Tripoli, Libya, from.
 18 to 21 March ended in near
 riots requiring police inter-
 vention and the posting of extra
 guards around the Soviet Em-
 bassy.   The crowds presumably
 were inspired and organized
 by pro-UAR elements.
 In Tunisia, where Presi-
 dent Bourguiba is involved in a
 long-standing dispute with Nasir,
 the state-controlled Tunisian
 radio has categorized develop-
 ments in Iraq as a blow to "Nas-
 ir's expansionist designs." The
 Arabic-language press in Moroc-
 co, published by the conserva-
 tive faction of the ruling Is-
 tigial party, has expressed
 fear that the dispute may lead
 to civil war and foreign inter-
 ference in the Middle East.
 Yemeni Crown Prince Badr,
 according to the Cairo press,
 has deplored "Iraq's deviation
 from the right path" and af-
 firmed Yemen's support  for
 Nasirr's positive neutrality and
 nonalignment.   The Persian Gulf
 state of Bahrein  officially
 permitted pro-Nasir parades on
 19 March, the first political
 demonstrations held there since
 1956.   The conflict has even
 erupted in Israeli villages,
 where Arab supporters of Nasir
 reportedly clashed with Commu-
 nist sympathizers.
 A Saudi offer of good offices in
 the dispute has been criticized by the
 Communist press in Iraq.   The
 new government of the Sudan has
 asked the Arab League to take up
 the subject, and a special meet-
 ing of the league's political
 committee has been called for
 31 March in Beirut.
 IL.i Lebanon, Moslems appear
 wholeheartedly behind Nasir,
 but some Christian elements are
 reported "gleeful" at his dis-
 comfiture over the  abortive
 Iraqi uprising,   The Beirut
 press is continuing attacks on
 both Baghdad and Moscow.   Com-
 munist press and cultural in-
 stallations in Beirut were bombed
 on 15 and 22 March, and govern-
 ment security forces have been
 posted around the Soviet Em-
 bassy.   The Lebanese Government
 is officially neutral,

 and Nasir held their long-planned

 border on 25 March.  An ostensible

 strife.
 THE SITUATION IN TIBET
 The unrest in Lhasa  ap-
 pears to have quieted following
 several days of intense fight-
 ing between Chinese forces and
 Tibetan rebels which began on
 20 March.  The Chinese Commu-
 nist-operated radio in Lhasa--
 which has been silent since 19
 March--has still not resumed
 broadcasting.  Peiping radio
 continues to ignore the Tibetan
 situation.
 Little reliable informa-
 tit            is available on the scope
 of the fighting; press reports
 of the Communist  bombing of
 monasteries in Lhasa and the
 rebel capture of the 'trade 'town
 of Gyangtse cannot be confirmed.
 While Peiping will undoubtedly
 increase. its efforts to wipe
 out the remaining Tibetan dis-
 sidence, guerrilla activity in
 outlying parts of Tibet  and
 western China is expected  to
 continue for some time.
 The Dalai Lama, who  fled
 Lhasa on 17 March with a party
 of 12 Tibetans,. is in southern
 Tibet headed for the Indian
 border.  He expects to be met
 by a Tibetan sent from a resist-
 ance group in India.  Peiping.
 has listed the 'Dalai Lama among
 the delegates to the forthcoming
 National People-'s Congress--
 an  indication that the Chinese
 had expected him to attend the
 Congress meeting in Peiping on
 17 April.
 The Indian Government is
 gravely concerned over the sit
 uat;ion in Tibet, fearing that
 the consequences of rebel ac-
 tivity will endanger its rela-
 tions with Communist China.
 They Dalai Lama's presence in
 India or in Indian-protected
 Bhutan, representing a virtual
 Tibetan government-in-exile,
 would be highly embarrassing
 to New Delhi.   However, while
 Nehru is reluctant to become
 involved in an "internal" Chi-
 nese problem, he probably would
 not refuse some kind of asylum
 to the Dalai Lama.
 New Delhi is equally ap-
 prehensive over the possibility
 that Chinese troops, in an at-
 tempt to wipe out guerrilla ac-
 tivity, will eventually pursue
 fleeing rebels into Indian or
 Bhutanese territory and thus
 engage Indian border forces.
 Frontier checkposts have stand-   25X1
 ing instructions to deny ad-
 mission to dissident Tibetans.
 Nehru publicly reiterated
 his government's hands-off policy
 toward the "Tibet region  of
 China" before  an  aroused Par-
 lianient on 23 March.  His state-
 ment by implication  put                                                              Pei-

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 DEVELOPMENTS IN FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND I' I'A.SALAND
 The ruling white minority
 in the Federation of Rhodesia
 and Nyasaland has reacted to
 the challenge of local African
 nationalism by demonstrating a
 determination to maintain its
 position.   In Southern Rhodesia,
 the government has invoked tem-
 porary regulations which in-
 fringe on civil rights and is
 acting legislation to make
 them permanent.   The white vot-
 ers in Northern Rhodesia have
 :iv n overwhelming support to
 federal Prime Minister Welensky's
 firm racial policies.   In Ny-
 asaland.there have been only
 scattered incidents,  although
 the situation throughout the
 protectorate is still tense.
 The recent events seem likely
 to increase the doubt of both
 the Africans and the British
 in the present federation's
 ability to handle independence
 in 1960.
 In the self-governing
 colony of Southern Rhodesia,
 the settler-controlled govern-
 ment proclaimed a state of
 emergency on 26 February in an
 e:"fort to ;.,revent a spread of
 African nationalist disorders
 from Nyasaland.   Regulations
 promulgated under these powers
 permit the government to con-
 trol the movement of persons,
 to ban meetings of more than
 three people,  and to search
 premises without a warrant.
 Press censorship has also been
 imposed.
 The four African National
 Congress organizations operat-
 in;g in the federation are out-
 la-wed in Southern Rhodesia and
 penalties are imposed for hold-
 ing membership or office in
 them.   Furthermore,  the minis-
 ter of justice can detain any
 person   he considoi   dauigerous.
 Almost 500  Af r ca -s >:.ad been
 detained  by 5 March,
 Although the emergency
 proclamations were implemented
 without significant criticism,
 the    government's plan to pass
 a preventive detention bill
 permitting a person to be held
 for five   years without trial
 aroused considerable public
 opposition,  and the bill   has
 been withdrawn for rewriting.
 In London,  Joshua Nkomo,  presi-
 dent of the   banned Southern
 Rhodesian African National Con-
 gress,  has urged Britain to
 veto Rhodesian legislation
 which outlaws his organization.
 In Northern   Rhodesia,
 European settler support for
 the   federation government's
 firm handling of the racial
 crisis   was shown in the legis-
 lative council elections on
 20 March.   The white   voters
 gave heavy backing to pro-
 Welensky candidates in 13 of
 ;:Lie 14 European constituencies,
 and,   in the remaining one,
 they backed a segregationist.
 Despite this overwhelming set-
 t'..e:r support,  however,                                                                   Welensky's

 26 March 195w
 SOVIET-UAR ECONOMIC RELATIONS
 Despite the exchange of
 recriminations between Moscow
 and Cairo over Nasir's anti-
 Qasim, anti-Communist campaign,
 the Soviet Union is continuing
 to meet its obligations under
 its various economic and mili-
 tary assistance agreements with
 the UAR.   Soviet leaders prob-
 ably want to avoid the effect
 which an abrupt move to cut
 off further aid to the UAR
 would have on other Asian and
 African states.   Should.Nasir
 persist in his present tactics,
 however,  Moscow might retaliate
 by threatening to withhold aid
 or stalling on the implementa-
 tion of the aid agreements.
 The bloc--primarily the
 Soviet Union--has extended
 since 1955 more than $1 billion
 in economic and military aid
 to the UAR.   The USSR is start-
 ing more than 50 industrial
 projects in the Egyptian region
 under a $175,000,000 economic
 and technical aid agreement
 designed to promote Egypt's
 five-year plan.   Under an ad-
 ditional $100,000,000 credit,
 the USSR has begun the prelim-
 inary survey work for construct-
 ing the first stage of the
 Aswan High Dam.   The Soviet Un-
 ion has, in addition, completed
 surveys for the various irriga-
 tion, transportation, and geo-
 logical projects called for un-
 der the Soviet-Syrian economic
 development aid agreement and
 now is preparing to begin their
 implementation.   Some of them
 have been subcontracted to the
 European satellites.
 The bloc has extended
 about $500,000,000 in military
 aid to the two regions of the
 UAR.   The Syrian region, which
 has received about $200,000,000
 of this, has taken delivery on
 most of the items it ordered
 from the bloc.   Although there
 are :indications that the Soviet
 Union is not as lenient in
 agreeing to the UAR's requests
 as formerly, negotiations for
 additional arms purchases,  co-
 ordinated under Cairo's control,

 Malaya,  Singapore,  and other nations not among the Bandung countries may
 have been approached about attending the Afro Asian economic conference.
 Bandaranaike hopes will be held
 later this year.
 The purpose of the confer-
 ence would be to discuss a wide
 range of economic issues,  in-
 cluding establishment   of                    an
 Afro-Asian bank,  stabilization
 of  prices  of  primary  export
 products,  formulation of com-
 mon policies regarding private
 foreign investment, and possibly
 establishment of free-trade or
 common-market  zones  between
 certain countries in the area.
 Means of furthering regional
 cooperation in economic devel-
 opment planning, food produc-
 tion,  shipping,  and population
 control would also be discussed.
 Bandaranaike has specified that
 political issues would be ex-
 cluded.
 Many of the 30-odd coun-
 tries concerned have reserva-
 tions about the conference,
 however,  and extensive prepara-
 tions at the committee level
 probably will be required be-
 fore Bandaranaike's conference
 plan is finally accepted.   Some
 countries question whether sub-
 stantial advantages would be
 gained from discussions among
 nations representing such a
 wide variety of economic in-
 terests.   India's Prime Minis-
 ter Nehru still appears rela-
 tively unenthusiastic about
 the plan.   Japan is also luke-
 warm, and Tokyo apparently would
 prefer to have the proposed
 agenda items discussed by ex-
 perts rather than at a full
 conference.
 Communist attempts to ex-
 ploit any conference that en-
 sues; from the planning meeting
 in May probably would prove un-
 successful in view of the re-
 sentment caused among the Ban-
 dun  nations by Moscow's and
 17eiping's efforts to identify
 their policies closely with
 the "spirit of Bandung.'/

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 March 1959
 Israel's extreme rightist
 Herut party, which advocates an
 aggressive foreign policy, is
 calling for a formal Israeli-
 French alliance.   During the par-
 liamentary election campaign this
 summer and fall, Herut leaders
 apparently intend to accuse Prime
 Minister Ben-Gurion of jeopard-
 izing Israeli security by fail-
 ing to secure a regular treaty.
 The government maintains
 that a formal alliance is not
 desirable  at this time because
 it would restrict Israel's free-
 dom                 of action, and that all the
 assistance which could reason-
 ably be expected from France has
 been forthcoming under the ex-
 isting relationship.  Furthermore,
 it contends that the French Gov-
 ernment likewise sees no particu-
 lar advantage in an alliance at
 present.
 The Herut party has chal-
 lenged the government to pro-
 duce evidence to support its po-
 sition,
 Recent visits
 --o prance by Foreign Minister
 Meir and the director general
 of the Defense Ministry may also
 be related to this effort to
 minimize the election signifi-
 cance of the issue.
 The appointment of Jacques
 Soustelle as deputy premier in
 the Debr6 cabinet has undoubted-
 ly encouraged the Herut campaign.
 Soustelle, who has close rela-
 tions with the Herut party, has
 long advocated a formal French
 Israeli alliance, although his
 motivations are primarily anti-
 Arab, and particularly anti-
 Nasir, rather than pro-Israeli.
 He reportedly believes a strong
 Israel would keep the Arab world
 preoccupied and permit France
 to resolve its problems in North
 Africa with a minimum of Arab
 interference.   French Foreign
 Ministry officials, on the other
 hand, have apparently convinced
 De Gaulle that France should
 tone down its relationship with
 Israel and that a pact with Is-
 rael would endanger French-Arab
 relations,
 Meanwhile, quiet military
 cooperation between France and
 Israel is continuing.
 The USSR on 19 . March agreed at
 the Geneva talks to the Western
 draft articles on duration of
 the proposed treaty for cessa-
 tion of nuclear testing and on
 periodic review.of the control
 system.   As late as 16 March,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 March 1959,
 terms of reference, the USSR
 could not agree to a treaty.
 He had contended at the confer-
 ence that the American duration
 article had been designed to
 make withdrawal from the treaty
 "as easy as possible" and there-
 fore was "harmful and dangerous
 to international relations."
 Tsarapki:--:z stated that link-
 ing the right o.=' withdrawal from
 the treaty t-:.. the effectiveness
 of the control system was unac-
 ceptable to the USSR and that
 the only violation of the terms
 of the treaty in the Soviet view
 would be a nuclear test itself.
 Soviet propaganda had also strong-
 ly criticized the American draft
 duration article before 19 iv,^.rch,
 calling it another effort "~.imed
 at preventing at any cost a to-
 tal, unconditional, and perma-
 nent cessation of tests."
 The Soviet leaders probably
 believed this demonstration of
 willingness to make concessions
 in important East-West negotia-
 tions, occurring during Prime
 Minister Macmillan's Washington
 visit, would increase pressure
 on the West to agree to Soviet
 demands on the agenda and com-
 position of high-level East-West
 talks.
 The Soviet leaders probably
 also believe their concession
 on these important points will
 place the USSR in a better po-
 sition to demand concessions
 from the West on the issue of
 voting in the control commission.
 Soviet propaganda since 19 March,
 while failing to exploit Mos-
 cow's concession, has focused
 on the "impasse" it claims has
 been created by the West's "un-
 realistic" position on voting
 procedures in the control com-
 mission and on the composition
 of the control bodies.
 In another effort to dis-
 credit the Western attitude to-
 ward the talks, Moscow also
 charged that the...three-week recess,
 proposed by the West "can in: no
 way cause satisfaction" and "runs
 counter to public sentiment,"
 noting that the Soviet delegation
 had urged that the talks continue
 uninterruptedly.
 On 24 March, Moscow published
 Khrushchev's reply of 20 March
 to a letter on the test cessation
 question from 22 well-known Amer-
 icans.   He charged the United
 States and Britain with "doing
 everything they can to prevent
 an agreement" and stated that
 the  talks  therefore are "now
 faced ;with failure."  .He made
 no mention of the USSR's accep-
 tance of the Western article on
 duration    Moscow has furthe:c
 asserted that the Mnerican an-
 nouncement at this time of its
 September high-altitude tests
 is calculated "to undermine the
 authority of the Geneva experts'
 conference and therefore to make
 the reaching of agreement on
 stopping tests more difficult."

 The recent creation of new

 should decide to designate a
 successor soon.
 On 9 March, Colonel Arnaldo
 Schulz, whose appointment as
 interior minister last November
 was generally interpreted as
 presaging toughness toward po-
 litical opposition, placed a
 close army associate in the new-
 ly created position of chief of
 staff of the National Republic
 Guard.   About the same time, he
 installed a captain attached to
 the General Staff in another
 newly created post--chief of

 companied by inadequate economic
 aid.   He has repudiated his own
 earlier proposal for economic
 and political integration with
 Britain, and insists on inde.pend-
 ence for the tiny, overpopulat-
 ed island.   The British are now
 seeking to devise a new formula
 for the island's future polit-
 ical status, hoping in so do-
 ing to undercut Mintoff,  who
 remains by far the most popu-
 lar leader.
 The Colonial Office may
 try to obtain local acceptance
 of a constitution by letting
 the Maltese participate in the
 drafting via a revival of the
 historic Malta Assembly--a body
 representative of interest groups
 rather than political parties.
 There is reason to believe
 Min:toff might go along with
 this approach.   He may, however,
 pursue his independence cam-
 paign by inciting the dock-
 workers---whose full support
 he can command--to violence,

 transfer on 30 March  of
 the  dockyard from  the  Ad-

 (Gosplan) and the appointment
 of his predecessor,  I. I. Kuz-

 apparently intended to strength-

 of the 18 persons dropped from

 many.of the freedoms permitted

 Stalinists dropped were the am-

 Gomulka in 1951; and former po-

 Gomulka opponent Franciszek
 ,Tozwiak.
 The present composition of
 the central committee confirms
 Gomulka's tight grip on the.party
 apparatus and reflects his in-
 tention to extend full confidence
 to all Communists who now "stand
 -firmly on the party line, " re-
 gardless of whether they may have
 committed the error of dogmatism
 or revisionism in the past.   All
 the Stalinists were not dropped.
 Boleslaw Ruminski, Eugeniusz

 be assumed that they have arrived
 at some understanding with Go-

 to be no open persecution of
 the Catholic Church, but the
 church must confine its activities
 to matters of faith and "renounce

 The Soviet Government dele-

 to assuage recent frictions and
 to survey political and economic
 conditions.   It does not appear,
 however, to have made a signif-
 icant impact on either official
 or public opinion there.
 The bland joint communique
 issued at the close of the visit
 stated that the delegation had
 talks with Prime Minister Nehru
 and other leading officials in
 New Delhi on a number of inter-
 national "problems," including
 disarmament, Germany, Berlin,
 and the bilateral defense pacts
 recently signed by the United
 States with Paki$tan, Iran, and
 Turkey.  The communique said
 that the two sides agreed to
 continue efforts to reduce in-
 ternational tension and that
 both favor an agreement for the
 immediate suspension of nuclear
 tests.
 Originally, the delegation
 was to have been headed by So-
 viet President Voroshilov, but,
 because of illness, he was re-
 placed by A. A. Andreyev, a
 member of the Presidium of the
 Supreme Soviet.   Andreyev, how-

 PLOTTING AGAINST CARIBBEAN DICTATORSHIPS
 Two long-time militant
 enemies of Latin American dic-
 tatorships, President Romulo
 Betancourt of Venezuela and
 former Costa Rican President
 Jos4 Figueres,have grave mis-
 givings concerning the methods
 and objectives of the latest
 leader of the crusade against
 dictators, Cuban Prime Minister
 Fidel Castro.   Both are alarmed
 at Castro's demagoguery and
 his tendency to support pro-
 Communist Nicaraguan and Domini-
 can revolutionaries.
 ,On his visit to Cuba, be-
 ginning on 20 March, Figueres
 is believed to have tried to
 dissuade Castro from actions
 that would increase Communist
 capabilities in the area and to
 secure his support for Figueres'
 own plans for ousting the re-
 gimes in Nicaragua and the Do-
 minican Republic.
 Basic differences, which
 appear likely to prevent effec-
 tive cooperation between the
 two :Leaders, were emphasized

 resignation of President Lleras'
 former cabinet,   which followed
 closely on widespread violence,
 suggested that serious dissen-
 sion was developing within the
 government.
 The National Front was in-
 augurated last August following
 Conservative-Liberal agreement
 to rotate the presidency and to
 share on a parity basis all ap-
 pointive and elective offices
 for a 16-year period.   It has
 been weakened by the opposition
 of minority Conservative groups,
 the resurgence of   Communist
 agitation,  the plotting of the
 followers of former dictator
 Rojas,  and reported growing op-
 position of Liberals to rotation
 of the presidency.   The coordi-
 nation process within the coal-
 ition has also apparently slowed
 down government decisions and
 programs.
 The cabinet now is composed
 of six holdovers and seven new
 members, including two repre-
 sentatives of the important "Re-
 publican" faction of Conserva-
 tives which had refused to co-
 operate with the government.
 Their participation now may con-
 stitute a major initial step
 toward   a rapprochement between
 the principal elements of the
 long-divided Conservatives,
 The President's position
 has also been improved by the
 ratification of the coalition
 agreements at a recent convention
 of his own Liberal party--a step
 which followed his earlier warn-
 ing that he would resign if ro-
 tation of the presidency were not
 upheld,   Moreover, the end of
 Rojas'  trial by the Senate, with
 his conviction of misconduct
 during his 1953-57 presiden-
 tial term,   may   remove   a dis-
 turbing                                                                      element   from  the
 political scene and undercut
 any further plotting by his
 supporters.
 The government thus far has
 been successful in carrying out
 its stabilization program, de-
 signed to conserve foreign ex-
 change, control inflation, and
 pay the heavy commercial debt
 inherited from the dictatorship,
 However,  any drastic drop in the
 present low price of coffee, on
 which Colombia depends for al-
 most 80 percent of its foreign
 exchange, might,threaten this
 program and lead to economic
 conditions readily exploitable
 by opposition groups.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 At the NATO 2-4 April min-
 isterial meeting, which coin-
 cides wi'.b the treaty's tenth
 anniversary, most questions
 facing the ministers reflect
 the allianc-_)'s continuing prob-
 lem of achieving Western unity
 in the face of increasingly
 divisive tendencies of national
 interests.   Although the Cyprus
 settlermen!.: has begun to heal
 the rift among Greece, Turkey,
 and Britain and has helped to
 alleviate concern over the risk
 to NATO's southeastern flank,
 other issues still generate
 discord among alliance members.
 The Dutch have long been
 concerned over the supply of
 military equipment to Indonesia
 and on 11 March they warned the
 North Atlantic Council (NAC)
 that if Italy sells four de-
 stroyers to Indonesia, they
 might redeploy some naval ves-
 sels earmarked for the NATO
 area.   Strong reaction in Ice-
 land to continued incidents in
 the fishing dispute with the
 British could jeopardize the
 continued use of important
 northern bases there.   The out-
 standing example of these di-
 visive tendencies is the recent
 series of French moves culminat-
 ing '.n the announcement that the
 Mediterranean f leet
 would not be placed under NATO
 command in the event of war.
 The French Problem
 is De Gaulle move, taken
 without prior consultation, pro-
 vo! ed expressions of grave con-
 cern in member countries.   Al-
 though the NAC has deferred full
 debate until the military au-
 thorities' views are received,
 British, Dutch, Norwegian, Greek,
 and Turkish representatives
 have spoken of the adverse psy-
 chological impact the move
 would have.
 Other comments indicate
 fear that a precedent might be
 set for future unilateral West
 German action.   The Belgian
 representative said his govern-

 a real danger in future years
 by encouraging nationalistic
 Paris has also been the
 chief obstructionist for the
 last two months over the de-
 fense program approve:! at the
 December ministerial meeting.
 De Gaulle, by his strong oppo-
 sition, has held up approval of
 the first steps toward integrat-
 ing NATO's  air-defense system.
 He  has thus  far refused French
 concurrence  in the  common
 financing of  missile sites
 and  of nuclear stockpiles and
 has  suspended bilateral nego-
 tiations  on the provision of
 American missiles.   He  claims
 that   France, which is about
 to become a nuclear power, does
 not have an adequate voice in
 deciding on use  of .these
 weapons.
 De Gaulle questions NATO's
 structure and its geographic
 scope.
 it should be reorganize  with
 the accent on cooperation
 rather than integration.  His
 idea of a looser coalition with
 military forces primarily un-
 der national command and his
 opposition to the integration
 principle and to giving weight
 to   the views   of smaller na-
 tions  are  strikingly  at
 variance  with NATO's basic
 principles.
 French spokesmen have made
 clear that these views and ac-
 tions stem from De Gaulle's

 ers the lack of Allied support
 for French policy in Algeria,
 and-from irritation at lack of
 response to his November 1958
 memorandum to President Eisen-
 hower and Prime Minister Mac-
 millan requesting tripartite
 policy coordination on a glo-
 bal basis.   De Gaulle probably
 regards NATO as the most vul-
 nerable area in which he can
 exert pressure on Britain and
 the United States to accede to
 these demands.
 More bolts from Paris can
 be expected.   One such may be
 foreshadowed in Foreign Min-
 ister Couve de Murville's state-
 ment on 19 March that France
 wishes to have  all  French
 forces at its,own disposal in
 case of war in order to carry
 out national missions.   Article
 12 of the North Atlantic Treaty,
 providing for review of the pact
 after ten years if any member
 so requests, offers another op-
 portunity for French revision-
 ist efforts.
 The Military Situation
 Many members still fail to
 meet NATO military goals,   The
 MC-70 study, setting forth the
 minimum military requirements
 program considered essential
 through 1963, was not adopted
 as a commitment but only "ap-

 and other members  would  not
 agree to be bound by the allotted
 force goals.  The result, ac-
 cording to the 1958 Annual Re-
 view of NATO's defense status,
 was a return to the military
 shortcomings MC-70 had been de-
 signed to correct.

 unfavorable trends which caused

 ment unless American aid fills
 the gap.
 There are also pressures in
 the Netherlands and Luxembourg
 for   lowering  the  military

 will take effect in September.
 Denmark's parliament is likely
 to approve a defense reorganiza-

 scribed in 1955.   Archbishop
 Makarios has indicated that he
 will not oppose the legalization
 of AKEL in the independent re-

 The present size of the
 Communist party on Cyprus is
 not definitely known, but is
 usually estimated at between
 5,000 and 10,000 card-carrying
 members.  The party has made
 great strides sine; its found-
 ing, but its appeal has always
 been almost exclusively to the
 Greek Cypriot population.   In
 the municipal elections of 1953,
 the last elections on the is-
 land, Communist-backed candi-
 dates secured 42 percent of the
 popular vote of the Greek Cyp-
 riot. community but attracted
 few votes among the Turkish
 Cypriot minority.   The municipal
 councils of three of the six
 cities on the island now are
 controlled by the Communists.
 Ziartides, an extremely
 able, Moscow-trained labor
 leader, is the island's lead-
 ing Communist.   He is not
 known to be an officer of the
 party at this time but derives
 his power from his position as
 secretary general of the is-
 land's largest trade union,
 the 40,000-member Pan Cyprian
 Federation of Labor (PEO).   The
 PEO has rapidly expanded during
 the past five years and now
 dwarfs in size and influence
 the anti-Communist labor union
 sponsored by the Greek Cypriot
 nationalists.  While the PEO
 leadership has worked effectively
 for improved labor conditions,
 the leaders of the anti-Commu-

 their major efforts to the po-
 litical struggle for enosis--

 copies daily.   No other news-
 paper on Cyprus has a larger

 The Greek Nationalists
 The Greek Cypriot national-
 ists and Turkish Cypriots are
 in uncoordinated opposition to
 the Communists.   The enosis-
 minded Greek Cypriot national-
 ists, led by the Greek Orthodox
 Church, are made up of conserv-
 ative  elements with much of
 their strength among the peas-
 antry.   They are loosely organ-
 ized, and independence may pro-
 vide the impetus for a splinter-
 ing of this political grouping
 into several parties.   At the
 very least, efforts are ex-
 pected to be made to create
 some form of political center
 as an alternative to the Com-
 munists and the reactionary,
 church-dominated nationalists.
 Such unity as exists among
 the  Greek nationalists  is
 largely  the result  of wide-
 spread devotion to Archbishop
 Makarios.   The leaders of the
 Greek Orthodox Church have
 dominated Cyprus politics for
 centuries, and Makarios, who
 signed the recent Cyprus ac-
 cords on behalf of all Greek
 Cypriots, has brought  this
 supremacy to unprecedented
 heights.   His power was won in
 part by acquiring the aura of
 martyrdom through hl.s three-
 year exile from Cyprus and
 through the forfeiting of lead-
 ership by the lay leaders of
 the nationalist movement.   The
 enormously popular Greek Cypriot
 underground leader Grivas, in
 his farewell message to the peo-
 ple of Cyprus, issued a strong
 call to support Makarios.
 Makarios staked his repu-
 tation on the Cyprus accords
 and is personally determined to
 make them work.   However, de-
 spite his talent at political
 compromise, he has little time
 to produce satisfactory answers
 to the various economic and po-
 litical problems of Cyprus, and
 there is some question whether
 his approach to these problems
 will be progressive enough to
 meet popular demand.   Moreover,
 he has inherited a legacy of
 ill will between the Turkish and
 Greek Cypriots which will take
 years to erase.   Finally, the
 nationalists, who have concen-
 trated their energies on the
 national struggle for enosis,
 do not have the reputation for
 good local government which the
 Communists have developed through
 their scrupulous attention to
 local affairs.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 March 1959
 The Turkish Cypriots
 The Turkish Cypriots, a
 Moslem minority comprising 18
 percent of the population, may
 hold the balance of power in
 future governments if the Greek
 Communists and conservatives
 become roughly,  balanced in
 strength.   The Cyprus agree-
 ments allow the Turks to hold
 30 percent of the seats in the
 legislature--enough for them to
 control the operation of gov-
 ernment.                     They are implacably
 anti-Communist.
 The Turkish Cypriot leader,
 the astute Fazil Kuchuk, has in-
 dicated that he is prepared to
 work with Makarios for the cre-
 ation of a Cypriot republic;
 Makarios is expected to be
 president and Kuchuk vice pres-
 ident.   Kuchuk, however, has
 also given notice that he will
 jealously guard the rights
 granted the Turks in the Cyprus
 agreements.  There remains,
 therefore, a possibility of
 continued tension between the
 Greek and Turkish communities
 which the Communists can be
 expected to exploit.  The in-

 THE RISE AND FALL OF THE
 The Gomulka government,
 with the passage on 20 Decem-
 ber 1958 of a law on Worker
 Self-Government Conferences,
 dealt the Polish Workers'
 Councils a final blow as a po-
 tentially effective instrument
 for worker participation in
 industrial management.   The
 first Polish Workers' Councils
 were based on the Yugoslav
 model which Tito established
 in 1949 and 1950 to gain
 greater support for his regime
 and were formed in the summer
 of 1956 by the "labor intelli-
 gentsia" as part of a campaign
 against Stalinist methods of
 factory management.
 The basic aim of those who
 led the struggle in Poland was
 a more rational economic sys-
 tem that would permit better
 management at the individual
 factory level. As the council
 movement spread, it became
 an integral part of the "lib-
 eralization" process that
 brought Gomulka to power in
 October 1956.
 Comparison With Yugoslav Model
 In Yugoslavia the councils
 were established by the party

 One controversial aspect
 of the Cyprus settlement is
 the ;power of veto given the
 Turkish vice president and the
 Turkish members of the legisla-

 be a serious impediment to the

 much of the effect a rapid rise
 in Communist strength would have

 backed initially by the work-
 ers themselves.   The Yugoslav
 councils are, in theory at least,
 the basic management authority;
 in Poland, they were permitted
 only to "co-manage" the enter-
 prises.
 In general, the Yugoslav
 councils have wider powers than
 the Polish version ever had.
 Workers' Councils in Poland
 were limited to individual en-
 terprises;  in Yugoslavia they
 extend upward to a coordinating
 agency at the national level.
 The Polish enterprise director
 retained much more authority
 than his Yugoslav counterpart.
 The leaders of the Polish
 Workers' Council movement be-
 lieved that many of the tradi-
 tional functions of the entre-
 preneur could be transferred
 to the councils within the frame-
 work of the socialist system.
 Their idea was that since the
 workers of an enterprise had
 the necessary material interest
 in its operation, they could
 be relied on to assume the re-
 sponsibility for its co-manage-
 ment.   Such a system seemed to
 conform to the socialist con-
 cept of direct worker participa-
 tion in the management of pro-
 ductive activity and was ex-
 pected to improve the efficiency
 of both management and workers,
 as well as to enhance labor
 discipline and eliminate waste.
 Establishment of Councils
 The first Polish Workers'
 Councils were inspired and con-
 trolled by technical and admin-
 istrative personnel rather than
 by workers with a long history
 of trade unionism.   As a polit-
 ical necessity, the Gomulka
 regime accepted the principle
 of Workers' Councils,  but found
 itself committed to a concept
 without any clear notion of its
 potential political and economic
 consequences.   Gomulka himself
 is said to have felt from the
 beginning that the councils
 were anarchist and syndicalist
 in nature and should be rendered
 ineffective as quickly as pos-
 sible.
 The law establishing the
 councils in November 1956 was
 frankly experimental.   There
 was no provision for coordinat-
 ing the activities of a number
 of councils, nor did the coun-
 cils have sufficient authority
 to take actions that migh   have
 alleviated some of the short-
 comings inherited from the pre-
 ceding decade of mismanagement.
 Under different conditions,
 the councils might have devel-
 oped into an effective movement
 capable of improving Poland's
 industrial situation and elim-
 inating  some of the worker
 dissatisfaction.   Their history,
 however, shows that Polish labor-
 ers are not sufficiently inter-
 ested to participate actively
 in management and to cooperate
 voluntarily with measures aimed
 at increasing productivity un-
 less there are adequate eco-
 nomic incentives.
 Worker Disillusionment
 When the councils did not
 prove to be a panacea for all
 the gills besetting the Polish
 economy, there was widespread
 disi]Llusionment.   They were
 hampered from the beginning by
 lack of agreement on their proper
 status and functions and by the
 conflicting interests of the
 councils, workers, managers,
 and the party.
 The fact that the leaders
 of the councils were, in the
 main, the technical and admin-
 istrative intelligentsia rather
 than the workers proved to be a
 major cause of difficulty.   The
 intellectuals were able to see
 the blunders and absurdities of
 the doctrinaire party function-
 aries and welcomed the oppor-
 tunity to exercise leadership.
 Many rank-and-file workers, how-
 ever, soon charged that the
 "technological elite" had more
 in common with management than
 with workers.

 CURRENT INTELL]:GENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Party Objections
 Production problems fre-
 quently arose as a result of
 administrative confusion and
 rivalries among the councils,
 trade unions,  the party, and
 factory management.   These
 were combined with the general-
 ly narrow interests of many
 councils themselves and their
 inability to cope with the com-
 plexities of industrial man-
 agement.   The party from the
 beginning had been critical
 of the idea that the councils
 should have substantial powers
 over the administration of
 industry.   Party leaders felt
 they could not tolerate any
 organization which might com-
 pete for power with the party.
 At the party central com-
 mittee's plenum in May 1957,
 Gomulka took great pains to
 criticize the "false concepts"
 that had appeared in public
 discussions of the councils'
 role.   He maintained that man-
 agement of the enterprises by
 the councils would mean the
 destruction of the planned
 economy.   The organization of
 the councils on an industrial
 and nationwide basis, he argued,
 would do nothing to improve
 efficiency but would merely
 foster the concept of an anar-
 chist utopia and the prolifera-
 tion of duplicating administra-
 tive bodies.   He implied that
 the councils had no functions
 that could not be  'performed
 as well by other existing organs.
 Gomulka's concept was that
 the councils should be limited
 to reducing production costs,
 assisting in fuller exploitation
 of plant capacity, planning for
 the constructive use of sur-
 plus manpower, advising on ap-
 pointments to supervisory posi-
 tions, combating theft, bribery,
 and other dishonest practices,
 and dealing with matters of
 labor discipline and distribu-
 tion of surplus funds.
 Gomulka proposed at the
 Fourth Trade Union Congress in
 April 1958 establishment of
 Workers' Self-Government Con-
 ferences(WSGC),   The councils
 would become organs of the
 WSGC, lose their autonomous
 status, and in fact become sub-
 ordinate to the party and trade
 unions.
 The regime inaugurated an
 intensive drive to establish
 WSGC in individual enterprises
 on a "voluntary" basis, and by
 mid-February 1959 more than
 8,000 had been formed.
 New Law
 Under the complicated
 statute passed by the Sejm on
 20 December 1958, the WSGC is
 to be an instrument for the
 control of labor by the party
 and its subsidiary organization,
 the trade-unions; the range of
 worker self-government activities
 is to be carefully circumscribed;
 and the "binding principle of
 one-person management" is strong-
 ly affirmed, thus ruling out any
 effective worker participation
 in industrial management.  While
 leaving the councils legally in
 existence, the law in fact for-
 malizes their demise and pro-
 vides a procedure for their
 abolition.
 The new law merges the
 Workers' Councils into a quadri-
 partite body--council leaders,
 party functionaries, union of-
 ficiaals, and management repre-
 sentatives.   Furthermore, the
 law does not even make Workers'
 Councils mandatory, merely stat-
 ing that they "may" exist or be
 formed.
 While it is still theoreti-
 cally possible for the Workers'
 Councils to have an effective
 voice in the WSGC, voting pro-
 cedures have been stacked a-
 gainst them.   They will be in
 a minority from the beginning,
 as the trade unions are merely

 rector is dependent on the
 party for his position.
 Should a Workers' Council
 attempt to maintain its in-
 fluence in the direction of a
 factory, the party and trade
 union representation in the
 WSGC could easily be enlarged
 or the factory director could
 always use his veto power.
 Furthermore, the law makes it
 easy for party and trade union
 members to infiltrate the
 Workers' Councils and to gain
 control if necessary.   A system
 of checks and balances will also
 serve to keep the councils in
 a subordinate position.   The
 presidium of the council must
 include union, party, and man-
 agement representatives, who
 will thus be in a position to
 control the presidium's deci-
 sions.   Moreover, council elec-
 tions will be controlled and
 supervised by the trade unions.
 Prospects
 The reorganization of the
 system offers the party every
 opportunity to increase its
 activity and influence among
 industrial labor.   While the
 roles of the unions and manage-
 ment have been enhanced, the
 party will gain most.
 Prospects for true worker
 participation in policy and

 PEIPING'S DOCTRINAL CLAIMS AND SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS
 Faced with strong Soviet
 opposition,  Peiping's retreat
 from the early ideological
 claims made for  the Chinese
 communes culminated last month
 in Chinese pronouncements that
 the USSR still sets the pace
 and the pattern throughout the
 orbit for progress toward the
 ultimate state envisioned by
 Marx, Engels, and Lenin.   The
 junior partner, probably bitter
 over the forced retreat, re-
 tains its communes, not as an
 SECRET
 economy are virtually nonexistent
 There are already indications
 that the WSGC is to be used
 largely as a propaganda forum
 for exhorting workers to great-
 er productive efforts, since
 existing conferences are push-
 ing worker competitions and
 pledges to exceed planned goals
 and quotas.   The same worker
 indifference to party propaganda
 which characterized the general
 attitude toward the Workers'
 Councils and hastened their de-
 terioration, however, is likely
 to impede efforts to use the
 WSGC to raise productivity.
 The WSGC does offer the
 prospect of improving adminis-
 trative coordination among groups
 responsible for the organization
 of production, but they are
 likely to be overburdened with
 petty details,  and the interests
 of individual factories rather
 than those of the entire econ-
 omy are likely to be emphasized.
 Management will gain greater
 authority, responsibility, and
 reward under the new system.
 Workers' Councils probably
 will continue to exist only
 where they have active worker
 support and are economically
 effective.   Since they are even
 less likely to meet these cri-
 teria, under the WSGC than be-
 fore,  it is likely that most
 councils will  gradually  die
 away,   probably  with little
 objection   from  the workers.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 March 1959
 internationally applicable
 breakthrough toward Communism
 itself, but as a peculiarly Chi-
 nese innovation required by lo-
 cal conditions for the "building
 of socialism" and the eventual
 transition to Communism.
 The episode is typical of
 several occasions since 1953
 on which Peiping has independ-
 ently claimed the discovery of
 new ideological truths, only to
 be forced subsequently to aban-
 don or scale down its claims.
 Mao Tse-tung and his colleagues
 will probably continue to seek
 enhanced prestige as "creative"
 Marxists, but the communes con-
 troversy indicates that they
 consider the Sino-Soviet alli-
 ance too valuable to be jeop-
 ardized by doctrinal disagree-
 ment.
 When the Chinese Communists
 first instituted the communes
 program last July,  it was with
 the claim that "Communism is
 not far distant in China."  Bas-
 ing their claims on quotations
 from Marx, Engels, some of Le-
 nin's early writings, and even
 works of Utopian Socialists,
 they said the "Chinese people,"
 in seeking to "grope out a con-
 crete road" to Communism, had
 discovered under the guidance
 of Mao and the Chinese party
 that the commune, a qualitative
 improvement over collectiviza-
 tion, was the best means of
 transition.   Soviet theorists
 since Lenin were not even men-
 tioned in passing.
 The ideological claim may
 have been motivated by the need
 for a psychological incentive
 during intense reorganization,
 a conviction that Soviet stand-
 ards could not realistically
 be applied to China, and Mao's
 own desire to refurbish his
 prestige as an independent in-
 terpreter of Marx after the
 about-face on his "hundred f low-
 ers" thesis.   Practical economic
 necessity  appears to have dic-
 tated the commune program and
 its retention today shorn of ma-
 jor doctrinal pretensions.   Liu
 Shao?-chi, Mao's chief lieutenant,
 has stressed that essential
 rapid industrialization depended
 on a revolution in agriculture,
 a revolution which could be
 achieved only through regimenta-
 tion and complete control of the
 labor force.
 The Chinese were aware that
 the 'USSR had experimented brief-
 ly with communes, but they ap-
 parently believed that Peiping
 could exploit peasants more in-
 tensely than Moscow because Chi-
 nese peasants had less to lose,
 their resistance had been more
 completely broken, and they had
 gone through decades of war and
 social anarchy.
 The commune program not
 only contradicted earlier Soviet
 experience, however, but in its
 role as a shortcut , to Commu-
 nism flew in the face of the So-
 viet dictum that considerable
 material abundance and highly
 developed technology are pre-
 requisites for the entry into
 this final stage of Marxism.
 Possibly rationalizing away the
 impossibility of meeting these
 requirements in China in the
 immediate future, the Peiping
 theorists seemed to imply that
 these considerations had some-
 thing in common with bourgeois
 materialism, and harked back to
 the original Marxism "To each
 according to his needs."
 Recent Soviet doctrine,
 recognizing  the need     for in-
 centive,   holds that                                                                   each
 should receive "according to
 his effort."  But  the Chinese,
 unable to  deliver even the
 beginnings of material  abun-
 dant,e  during                                                                  the  drive to.

 substitute for material incen-
 tives the vision of reaching the
 ultimate goal, no matter how
 grim the short cut, within the
 not-too-distant future.
 Mao and his colleagues
 may have felt they were shielded
 in this independent ideological
 pathfinding by the 12-party Mos-
 cow declaration of November
 1957, which Mao helped draft.
 This provided, as an alterna-
 tive to "separate roads to so-
 cialism," that the individual
 parties would use "creativity"
 in applying the general build-
 ing codes of socialism, "in ac-
 cordance with the concrete con-
 ditions of their countries."
 But developments made it clear
 that the Kremlin was angered by
 the Chinese claims of
 progress toward Com-
 munism, and that the
 Soviet leaders  were
 less than gr'clous in
 showing their  pique
 and indicati,~" that
 the claims we:.?~s pre-
 sumptuous.
 The independence
 and boldness of  the
 Chinese claims suggest
 that Peiping did  not
 expect a severe re-
 buff from Moscow, but
 rather concurrence
 that the Chinese par-
 ty is competent to
 discuss the building
 of socialism and Com-
 ments for completing the build-
 ing of socialism in a few years;
 furthermore, he may well have
 implied that China might find
 it increasingly di:ft:z.cult to
 get them.   In a speech on 6 No-
 vember in Peiping, Yudin had
 nothing to say about the communes
 and much to say about high-level
 industrialization and the dawn
 of Communism in the Soviet Un-
 ion.
 The degree of Sovii.t. i:i-
 ritation with the Chinese is
 indicated by Khro,hchev's will-
 ingness to disparage them before
 Westerners.  He told Senator
 Humphrey that the communes were
 in fact simply a method of using
 massive amounts of labor in agri-
 culture.   He also said that the
 Soviet Union had found the prin-
 munism.   The continuation of
 Chinese claims through September
 and October further suggests
 that Moscow at first attempted
 to use silence to indicate its
 growing displeasure, hoping that
 the Chinese leaders would take
 the initiative in moderating
 their statements.   When this
 approach failed to dampen Chi-
 nese  enthusiasm, the  Sov1e1
 leaders apparently decided to
 object more directly.
 Soviet Ambassador Yudin
 probably informed the Chinese
 leaders frankly that China did
 not have the material require-
 ciple Of "to each according to
 his need" impractical--that in-
 centives were necessary.
 Faced with blunt Soviet
 disapproval, Peiping's claims
 on the imminence of pure Communism

 were sealed down.       The retreat
 on the issue of incentives, how-
 ever, was also dictated by prac-
 tical domestic considerations;
 the 10 December resolution of
 the Chinese Communist party
 central committee plenum called
 for stress on incentives to spur
 "production" and indicated that
 the principle of distribution
 of money and supplies "accord-
 ing to work" would be the re-
 gime's policy "for a long time
 to come."
 The ideological retreat
 was embarrassing to the Chinese
 party and required a rationali-
 zation.   Chinese writers provid-
 ed this by stating that the rev-
 olution could neither "stand
 still" nor dash forward without
 adequate material foundations.
 In effect, however, Mao's the-
 sis of "uninterrupted revolu-
 tion" was modified by acknowl-
 edging the need for "revolution-
 ary stages."   In January the
 party's theoretical journal,
 Red Flag, reasserted the point
 iii a      ao 20 years ago  that
 "the political and social revo-
 lutions cannot be accomplished
 at one stroke."
 The extent of Peiping's
 public retreat is emphasized
 by two major commentaries on
 Khrushchev's report on the So-
 viet 21st party congress.
 People's Daily on 5 February
 and  a     aag on 16 February ac-
 cepte-rus chev's "clarifica-
 tions" and made no attempt to
 blur the doctrinal points at
 issue between Peiping and Mos-
 cow.
 The major points acknowl-
 edged by the editorials were
 that:   (1) common "laws" pre-
 clude a separate path to social-
 ism;                (2) Communism requires an
 abundance of goods and must be
 erected on a highly industrial-
 ized base  which will require
 decades to build;  (3) remunera-
 tion "according to work" is
 still the basic principle of
 distribution under socialism
 and will continue to be "for a
 long time to come," and (4) China
 will not move toward the USSR's
 advanced position at a rate
 faster than that of the satel-
 lites.
 Chou En-lai, attempting to
 mollify the Soviet leaders, told
 the Soviet party congress that
 the communes were Chinese for-
 mations evolved from and for
 Chinese conditions and, by im-
 plication,   that Peiping did
 not intend to export the idea.
 The Chinese persist, however,
 in the obvious contention  that
 the commune is more than a form
 of collectivized agriculture--
 it is a unit of society differ-
 ing significantly from the So-
 viet model.
 The Soviet leaders contin-
 ued to be sensitive to this con-
 notation of "commune";   for ex-
 ample, Khrushchev and Yudin
 failed to mention it in their
 speeches at the congress. Yudin,
 who advised that those who want
 to know "what Communism is" must
 study documents of the congress,
 referred only to China's "so-
 cialist transformation of rural
 communities."
 There is no reliable evi-
 dence that the Soviet Union made
 any concessions to obtain the
 Chinese recantation.   Long-term
 aid and technical assistance
 may have been used either as a
 weapon or a bribe, but the Sino-
 Soviet economic agreement signed
 on February does not seem to
 extend Peiping special considera-
 tion".   In the ideological area,
 Khrushchev's thesis that the so-
 cialist countries would "more
 or less simultaneously pass to
 Communism" removes the earlier
 hints that the European Commu-
 nist countries would achieve
 this goal first.   While this
 may represent a concession to
 Chinese pride, it also pulls
 Peiping back to travel with and
 not ahead of the satellites.

 the congress that "countries

 the experience, cooperation, and
 mutual assistance of other So-
 cialist countries" appears to
 be a reminder that Peiping's
 aspiration to status of a major
 industrial power depends on So-
 viet aid.   In this, Khrushchev
 is relegating China almost to
 the level of the satellites,
 who continue to stress the role
 of Soviet aid in their advance
 toward socialism.
 Mao's prestige as a theo-
 rist in the bloc  particularly
 in Eastern Europe--if zot dam-

 the forced ide(,~ogicai retreat

 lowing                                                      a  pattern  which marked
 earlier ventures      in the doc-
 trinal  field.
 The Chinese Communists con-
 tinue to consolidate the com-

 "best; form for China to make the
 transition from socialism to
 Communism,"  Regardless of the
 ideological retreat, the com-
 munes involve major modifica-
 tions of Peiping's economic
 pattern, which originally was
 based on the Soviet example.
 In the event that Mao issues
 a thesis on the subject, he
 will probably apply it to "Chi-
 na's concrete conditions" in
 order to avoid a direct chal-
 lenge to Moscow's ideological
 leadership in the bloc.   More-
 over, any independent doctrinal
 claims he advances will probably
 be on a modest scale and with
 more ambiguity than those the
 Chinese made in 1958.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 March 1959
 ANNEX
 SINO-SOVIET BLOC ACTIVITY IN TUNISIA, MOROCCO, AND ALGERIA
 1.   General Bloc Policy:
 The over-all aims of  ino- oviet
 bloc policy in North Africa
 continue to be disruption of
 Western interests, establish-
 ment and expansion of lasting
 political and economic rela-
 tionships,  and encouragement
 of an anti-Western neutralist
 posture in the area.   In the
 last six months,  the bloc has
 enlarged the modest scope of its
 trade relations.   Soviet First
 Deputy Premier Mikoyan declared
 in January that the USSR, with-
 out attaching political strings,
 would be "always disposed to
 study" any Tunisian requests
 for economic development loans.
 Moscow scored an initial break-
 through in the political field
 by exchanging ambassadors with
 Morocco, and Morocco has also
 given  agrement for a Chinese
 Communist ambassador, who ap-
 parently will be a Chinese Mos-
 lem.   Soviet propaganda through-
 out the period called for im-
 mediate American withdrawal from
 air bases in Morocco.
 2. The bloc has furnished
 political and propaganda support
 for the Algerian provisional
 government established in Cairo
 in September, but Moscow and the
 European satellites, eager to
 preserve good relations with
 France, so far have stopped
 short of recognition.   China and
 the Asian satellites, on the
 other hand, have recognized the
 provisional government.   The
 bloc is interested in stimulat-
 ing anti-Westernism and nation-
 alist regionalism throughout
 North Africa, and bloc govern-
 mental activities in this regard
 often parallel those of the UAR.
 3.   Diplomatic Activity:
 The Soviet Embassy in Rabat,
 opened in October and now staffed
 with 33 nationals, is the only
 bloc diplomatic post in the
 area.   In February Morocco named
 an ambassador to Moscow.   The
 USSR and Czechoslovakia main-
 tain trade missions in Tunis,
 and the USSR, Czechoslovakia,
 and :Poland have trade missions
 in Casablanca.   Soviet officials
 in Rabat have moved quickly to
 make initial contacts both with
 Moroccan society and with the
 Mauritanian and Algerian nation-
 alist movements.   The Polish
 trade mission in Casablanca,
 and to a lesser extent the Soviet
 and Czech missions there,   are
 actively expanding social and
 propaganda activities and ef-
 forts to promote trade.   Tunisia
 is committed in principle to an
 eventual diplomatic exchange
 with both the USSR and Communist
 China.
 4.   Economic Activity:   In
 recent months the bloc has in-
 tensified its efforts to increase
 commerce with North Africa, but
 trade with the bloc continues
 to be only a small fraction of
 the total foreign trade of Tu-
 nisia and Morocco.   Bloc commerce
 constitutes about 4 percent of
 Morocco's total trade,  somewhat
 over 2 percent of Tunisia's to-
 tal trade, and one percent of
 Algeria's trade carried on with-
 in the French economic frame-
 work..
 5.   If recently concluded
 agreements between Morocco and
 bloc countries are fully imple-
 mented, a substantial increase
 in the present small amount of
 trade will occur  in 1959. Agree-
 ments with Communist China and
 Czechoslovakia call for an in-
 crease of roughly 100 percent
 in trade turnover.   In Tunisia,
 recent trade accords, especially
 those with the USSR and Commu-
 nist China, foreshadow a con-
 siderable increase in 1959.  The
 agreement with China calls for
 $2,000,000 in trade each way

 compared with total exchanges
 in 1957 of only $600,000. Both
 the Casablanca and Tunis trade
 fairs continue to       be   focal
 points for bloc promotional
 activities.   The USSR will ex-
 hibit for the first time at the
 Casablanca trade fair in April.
 6.        Morocco has experienced
 great difficulty in its trade
 with Peiping because of China's
 unwillingness or inability to
 absorb Morocco's traditional
 agricultural exports.   In 1958
 China's large exports of green
 tea to Morocco were balanced
 by Chinese imports from France.
 A Chinese trade delegation re-
 cently spent three months in
 Rabat and worked out a series
 of triangular trade transac-
 tions as well as Chinese pur-
 chases of phosphates in an ef-
 fort to correct this imbalance.
 9.   Cultural and Propaganda
 Activity:  Peiping installed a
 New China News Agency represent-
 ative  and opened information
 offices in Rabat in November,
 immediately following the Mo-
 roccan-Chinese agreement  in
 principle to establish diplo-
 matic relations.  The USSR is
 reported to have tentative
 plans to open a cultural center
 in Rabat and it will reportedly
 include a secondary school
 staffed with Arabic-speaking
 Soviet teachers.   In Tunisia,
 the USSR and Czechoslovakia
 are the most active bloc coun-
 tries in local propaganda di-
 recited at the press and theaters.
 The USSR has recently attempted
 direct mailing operations;  it
 has provided a free and un-
 solicited supply of Arabic-
 language literature to Tunisia's
 largest Arabic book wholesaler.
 However, there appears to be
 no widespread public distribu-
 tion of bloc publications.
 10.   Subversive Activity:
 om-
 The Tunisian and Moroccan
 munist parties have apparently
 been unable to penetrate the
 nationalist movements and domi-
 nate political parties which
 they support publicly.   Domi-
 nant nationalists still regard
 the Communist parties as for-
 eign organizations, since party
 leadership has been in the past
 predominantly European.   Commu-
 nist parties in all three areas
 have, however, substantially
 "Arabized" themselves in the
 last several years.   In Tunisia,
 there are about 300 hard-core
 Communists; in Morocco, where
 the party is formally illegal
 but tolerated, less than a thou-
 sand; and in Algeria, where it
 is also illegal, between 5,000
 and 10,000.   Several higher
 level Moroccan government offi-
 cials,  including the director
 of mines, are Communists.   In
 addition a considerable portion
 of the French teachers supplied
 to both Tunisia  and Morocco
 are Communists or Communist
 sympathizers, and this is   a
 potentially serious source of
 Communist influence.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 March 1959
 Soviet Embassy in Rabat, North
 African Communists may receive
 some degree of direct guidance.
 The three parties are apparent-
 ly in consultation with each
 other on regional questions,
 and they have maintained covert
 contacts with a number of Euro-
 pean Communist parties, espe-
 cially those in Italy, France,
 and Belgium.   Direct contact
 with Moscow through visits of
 party leaders is the mechanism
 for basic guidance.
 12.  Reaction to Bloc Ac-
 tivities:  The governments of
 'Morocco and Tunisia have cau-
 tiously accepted a wider meas-
 ure of bloc relations, but they
 have been slow to do so and they
 have rejected many bloc initia-
 tives.   Both are sensitive  to
 the dangers posed by a growth
 in bloc influence.  Their se-
 curity services tend to dis-
 count the potential of local
 Communists,  and the services'
 concern over UAR, French and,
 especially in Tunisia, Algerian
 activities tends to push the
 Communist question into the
 background.   Given their pre-
 occupation with organizational
 and political questions and
 their present capabilities, the
 security services probably could
 not cope effectively with sub-
 stantial Communist subversive
 operations.
 13.  President Bourguiba
 has used the threat of limited
 arms procurement from the bloc
 to induce Western aid.   Al-
 though the Tunisian Government
 indicated in July that it would
 exchange ambassadors with both
 Moscow and Peiping,  the govern-
 ment has ignored Soviet over-
 tures and it has apparently
 dropped the question for the
 time being.
 14.   Both Morocco and, to
 a lesser extent, Tunisia ad-
 vocate a foreign policy of "non-
 dependence" which the bloc, for
 reasons of its own, has so far
 heartily endorsed.   Both gov-
 ernments, particularly Tunisia,
 tend to  be  Western  oriented
 and to be proud of their veneer
 of French culture.    Political
 factions in both countries ad-
 vocating disengagement from the
 West were apparently strength-
 ened in 1958 by rising North
 African dissatisfaction over the
 continuing war with Algeria,
 Western failure to meet Tunisian
 arms demands, and the continued
 presence of American, French,
 and Spanish bases in Morocco.
 15.   The Algerian rebels'
 contacts with the bloc, primarily
 made through Cairo, but also
 through Rabat and Bengasi, have
 increased during the past year.
 The Algerians have attended in-
 ternational Communist-front
 meetings and a delegation visited
 both Moscow and Peiping.   Both
 Morocco and Tunisia continue to
 seek to influence the provision-
 al government along moderate
 lines, but their concern over
 foreign influences on the move-
 ment is directed at the UAR rath-
 er than the bloc.
 16.  The Outlook:  The bloc
 will probably-continue to make
 slow progress in broadening its
 political and economic relation-
 ships with North Africa and, if
 circumstances permit, it will
 move on into the field of eco-
 nomic aid.   Trade turnover be-
 tween Morocco and Tunisia and
 the bloc will probably increase
 but will remain within the range
 of the present small percentages.
 Future bloc efforts will con-
 tinue to be affected to a large
 degree by the course of the Al-
 gerian war and by the periodic
 crises that recur in France's
 relations with Tunisia and Mo-
 rocco.   The Tunisian and Mo-
 roccan governments would prob-
 ably be inclined to accept bloc
 economic assistance to supple-
 ment American, other Western,
 and UN aid.

 nist parties have improved some-

 they have "Arabized" themselves
 and have continued to identify
 themselves with the cause of
 national independence.         Any
 significant extension of their
 inf ?,uence in domestic policy
 depends on the extent to which
 the position of the leading con-
 servative political figures is
 further eroded by internal crises
 or by the lack of visible gains
 resulting from cooperation with
