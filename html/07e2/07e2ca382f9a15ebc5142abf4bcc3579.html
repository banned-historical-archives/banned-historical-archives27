 THE MOSCOW CONFERENCE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTIES
 (November 1960)
 Most of the leaders of the world Communist movement gath-
 ered in Moscow in November 1960 to discuss questions of world
 Communist strategy and of authority and discipline in the move-
 ment itself--and, if possible, to paper over the Sino-Soviet
 dispute on the basis of an uncompleted draft declaration pre-
 pared by a multiparty committee in October.  There were dele-
 gations from 81 Communist parties, of the 87 claimed to exist;
 but they did not include Mao Tse-tung and Kim Il-sung.
 As the delegates arrived in early November, they were re-
 portedly given a copy of the draft declaration, plus a copy or
 summary of the Soviet party's letter of 5 November to the Chi-
 nese party, plus a briefing in which the Soviet party asked
 for their support.   In circulating the 5 November letter, the
 Soviet party made clear to everyone that it had not abandoned
 or appreciably modified its positions, i.e., that the agree-
 ments reached thus far were nominal agreements.  Beyond this,
 the Soviet party, in reviewing the entire case against the Chi-
 nese, seemed to be soliciting massive support for an effort to
 get at least one hard agreement--on the principle of majority
 rule for the world Communist movement.
 The preparatory committee in October had devised accept-
 able language, in the draft declaration, for almost all ques-
 tions of Communist strategy--by stating both the Soviet and
 Chinese positions or by evading the issues.  The committee
 had been unable to find acceptable language, however, on sev-
 eral issues relating to authority and discipline in the move-
 ment.   the "cult of the individual," relevant to de-Staliniza-
 tion and the status of both Khrushchev and Mao; endorsement
 of the theses of the 20th and 21st CPSU congresses, entailing
 the issue of whether the Soviet party could speak for the
 world Communist movement; and of greatest importance, "unity"
 and "factionalism" in the movement, these being the terms in
 which the Soviet party sought to establish the principle of
 majority rule.  At the meetings of the 26-party preparatory
 committee in October, the Chinese had led the dissidents on
 each of these questions, supported on almost all points by
 the Albanians and on others by various combinations of the
 delegations of Australia, Indonesia, Japan, North Korea, and
 North Vietnam.  As the November conference developed, the

 Chinese also objected strongly, with some support, to certain
 of the passages in the draft referring to "nationalism" or
 "national Communism"--passages which the Chinese correctly
 regarded as being aimed at them.
 On 10 November, the first day of the conference, Khru-
 shchev opened the discussion with a systematic defense of
 Soviet positions, including all of the Soviet positions com-
 promised in the draft declaration.   (An authorized version
 of this speech, although not presented as that, was to appear
 as Khrushchev's 6 January report on the conference.)   On 14
 November, after some 18 speeches in support of the Soviet
 party and only one speech (the North Korean) stating an
 equivocal position, Teng Hsiao-ping of the Chinese delegation
 spoke for four hours, replying both to the Soviet party's 5
 November letter and to Khrushchev's 10 November speech.
 Khrushchev had begun by expressing a. hope of resolving
 differences.   He had then reaffirmed the Soviet assessment
 of the balance of power, contending that the balance was "in
 favor of" socialism but that the West was still strong.   He
 had reiterated his belief in the bloc's increasing (not ab-
 solute) ability to deter the West from initiating either a
 world war or local wars which might lead to world war, and
 he had contended that "peaceful coexistence" would favor so-
 cialism.
 In reply, Teng began by rebuking the Soviet party for
 bringing up all of the issues again.   He then defended Mao's
 formulation of the balance of power in terms of the East Wind
 prevailing--a figure used by the Chinese to imply a greater
 degree of bloc superiority than asserted by Moscow.  Teng
 criticized the Soviet party for curbing "revolutionary strug-
 gles" at the same time that it proclaimed bloc superiority,
 and he defended Mao's concept of the Western "paper tiger"--
 long used to disparage Western strength--as one necessary to
 maintain revolutionary will.  Teng recognized the possibility
 of averting a world war, but he wanted equal emphasis on the
 continuing danger of a Western-initiated world war.   He ob-
 jected to the Soviet interpretation of "peaceful coexistence,"
 contending that this concept should include the building up
 of the entire bloc as rapidly as possible and the provision
 of the utmost possible support to revolutionary struggles
 all over the world.   Teng argued at one point that such strug-
 gles would not increase the possibility of world war, and at

 another point that even if they did lead to world war the
 imperialists would be wiped out in such a war.
 Khrushchev had enlarged on the Soviet position on types
 of wars--world war, local wars, and "liberation" wars.   He
 had given some detail on the disastrous consequences of nu-
 clear war.   He had stated his opposition to a world war--a
 war necessarily involving the United States and the Soviet
 Union--and his belief that the West would be wary of ini-
 tiating such a war.  As for local wars, i.e., small-scale
 wars between states, wars also Western-initiated (e.g., the
 Suez crisis), he had spoken of these as a diminishing pros-
 pect, and he had said that the Communist objective should
 be to deter such wars or to halt them before they could ex-
 pand.   As for "liberation" wars, i.e., wars by indigenous
 forces against colonial powers or against their own inde-
 pendent governments (he specified Algeria and Cuba), he had
 agreed that such wars were "inevitable" and he had affirmed
 an intention to support them, but he had evaded the ques-
 tions of the kind and degree of support.
 In reply, Teng denied that Peiping envisaged the triumph
 of socialism through general war, but he reiterated that it
 was a mistake to emphasize the dreadful consequences of nu-
 clear war; he reaffirmed Mao's view that half the world's
 population would survive a world war.   He dissented strongly
 from Soviet views on local and liberation wars.   Reaffirm-
 ing the inevitability of Western-initiated local wars, he
 pointed to the Korean war again as a "just" local war which
 had been not halted but fought, to the bloc's advantage. He
 cited various liberation wars as having also been advanta-
 geous; he was critical of Soviet evasiveness on the question
 of support for liberation wars and uprisings, and he called
 for much greater support.
 In discussing the consequences of nuclear war, Khrushchev
 had reaffirmed the value of the effort toward disarmament and
 toward negotiations with "sober" forces in the West.  Teng
 was scornful of these views.   He called for the bloc--includ-
 ing China--to develop superiority in nuclear weapons, and he
 contended that the "hope of peace" rested not on talks with
 the West but on the progress of the revolutionary struggle
 everywhere.

 wil
 With respect to the national liberation movement (colonial
 areas and underdeveloped states), Khrushchev had contended--
 contrary to Peiping--that the West was increasingly deterred
 from military intervention and that its other coercive devices
 were generally ineffectual, a line related to the Soviet posi-
 tion on the decreasing importance (despite their  inevitabil-
 ity) 'of liberation wars.   He had emphasized the importance--
 minimized by Peiping--of.bloc aid to underdeveloped states
 and he had invited attention to the new Soviet concept of
 "national democracy"  as a transitional stage to socialism
 for these states.   He had reaffirmed that Communist parties
 in both underdeveloped states and developed Western countries
 might sometimes come to power by non-violent means.
 In reply, Teng emphasized the importance of armed strug-
 gle in colonial areas and Western successes in preventing the
 independent countries from achieving true independence. Con-
 trary to the earlier Soviet emphasis on protracted coopera-
 tion with bourgeois nationalist leaders in the independent
 countries and the reflection of that line in the new concept
 of "national democracy," Teng reaffirmed the Chinese line on
 the importance of striving for early Communist domination of
 independent governments, and he indirectly criticized the
 concept of "national democracy" on grounds of ambiguity.   He
 reiterated that the Soviet party had grossly exaggerated the
 prospects for peaceful accession of the Communist parties to
 power, in both underdeveloped and developed countries, and,
 referring to the Soviet formulation about not exporting rev-
 olution, he again charged the Soviet party with failing to
 give adequate support to revolutionary movements.
 Early in his 10 November speech,   clearly aiming at
 the Chinese, Khrushchev had reviewed Soviet principles for
 building socialism and Communism and had called for better
 coordination of bloc economies.   In reply, Teng defended
 the Chinese practice of emphasizing "ideology and morality"
 rather than material incentives, denied that Peiping was
 trying to find a shortcut to Communism, praised the "leap
 forward"  and commune programs, and, reaffirming the Chinese
 aim of autarky, observed that each country should develop
 its own economy and could later cooperate on a voluntary
 basis.

 Discussing the critical questions of authority and dis-
 cipline in the movement--i.e., the most important of the un-
 completed portions of the draft declaration--Khrushchev had
 related the two offenses of "revisionism" and "nationalism,"
 in effect turning the Chinese charge of Soviet revisionism
 into, a Soviet charge of Chinese nationalism.   He had reit-
 erated the Soviet party's abjuration of leadership of the
 world Communist movement, but he had strongly reaffirmed the
 Soviet party's support of the principle of majority rule in
 the movement, including the reflection of this principle in
 the draft declaration's passages on unity and factionalism.
 In reply Teng protested the Soviet effort to find a
 "nationalist deviation" in Chinese policy, denied a relation-
 ship between nationalism and revisionism, noted that the cam-
 paign against "sectarianism" had been aimed at the Chinese
 party and led by Moscow, contended that Sino-Soviet differ-
 ences were a reflection of Soviet unconcern with revisionism,
 reaffirmed Peiping's poor opinion of the Soviet handling of
 de-Stalinization, and denied that the "cult of the individ-
 ual" was a concept applicable to Mao.  With respect to achiev-
 ing unity, Teng expressed suspicion that the Soviet party had
 not genuinely renounced leadership of the movement; he said
 that Peiping recognized the Soviet party as the center, but
 that there could be "no leaders and no led," no father-son
 relationship, no interference in other parties, and no im-
 position of views--such as the Soviet effort to make the
 theses of the 20th and 21st CPSU congresses binding on otherrd
 parties, and Soviet statements of support for leaders opposed
 to the dominant leaders in the Chinese and Albanian parties.
 Teng contended that unity must be achieved through consulta-
 tions, prolonged to unanimity; decisions could not be taken
 by majority vote.  While the principle of major ti y rule was
 applicable to the central committees of individual parties,
 Teng said, it was not applicable to the world Communist
 movement which had no such central committee; this being so,
 it was improper to pose the question of factionalism.
 Teng in his 14 November speech also took up issues be-
 tween the Soviet and Chinese governments, as the CPSU's 5
 November letter had done but which Khrushchev in his 10 No-
 vember speech apparently had not done.   Teng observed that
 Sino-Soviet differences had become more serious after Khru-
 shchev became the Soviet leader, and that the relationship
 had deteriorated considerably in autumn 1957 when the USSR

 Approved For Release 2001/0 AM- -

 attempted to establish Soviet-controlled radio and radar sta-
 tions in China and made other unspecified demands (reported-
 ly for Soviet naval bases in China and/or a Sino-Soviet navy
 or naval component).  Teng gave a long list of instances of
 unacceptable Soviet behavior in the period from autumn 1959
 to the current conference, including Khrushchev's criticism
 of Chinese policies and programs, Khrushchev's attribution
 of decent motives to Western leaders, Soviet attacks on the
 Chinese at the Bucharest conference and Soviet threats against
 Peiping in the public press, the withdrawal of Soviet tech-
 nicians, and a Soviet protest of Chinese border encroachment.
 Teng contended that past Soviet aid, while helpful, was only
 to be expected, had been repaid by Chinese sacrifices in the
 Korean war, and was no greater than Chinese aid to other
 countries.   He held that Chinese criticism of Soviet "great-
 nation chauvinism" was justified.
 Almost all of the delegations which bad not spoken prior
 to Teng's 14 November speech were drawn into the dispute in
 the next seven sessions of the conference.   The most interest-
 ing of the speeches reported were:  the Albanian (Hoxha's)
 speech of 16 November, supporting virtually all Chinese po-
 sitions and making some strong charges against the Soviet
 party; the Polish (Gomulka's) speech and the Italian (Longo's)
 speech of 17 November, both strongly supporting the Soviet
 party; the North Vietnamese (Ho Chi Minh's) speech of 17 No-
 vember,a. masterpiece of evasion and conciliation, but lean-
 ing to the Chinese on the key question of majority rule; and
 the Indonesian (Lukman's) speech of 19 November, generally
 in support of the Chinese.   Although the great majority of
 the delegations had put themselves on record, by the end of
 the 22 November session, as Soviet supporters, those parties
 which had expressed themselves as favoring majority rule ap-
 parently did not yet constitute a majority.
 Khrushchev spoke again on 23 November in reply to Teng's
 speech on 14 November and Hoxha's of 16 November.   He again
 defended the Soviet positions relating to world Communist
 strategy--as he was again to defend them strongly in his 6
 January report--which he had been forced to compromise or
 qualify in the draft declaration.   He chose to emphasize
 the importance of the assessment of the balance of power and
 the conclusion that the prevention of a world war was the
 "main task."  Rejecting Chinese charges, he affirmed that
 this task would not entail surrender, submission to blackmail,

 TOP SECRET ,.w
 failure to be vigilant or to build military strength, or re-
 nunciation of armed struggle.   He also gave considerable at-
 tention to the liberation movement, insisting that Soviet
 gradualist policies were correct and that the Chinese were
 foolishly militant.
 Khrushchev in this second speech emphatically reaf-
 firmed Soviet favor for the principle of majority rule. Fur-
 ther, citing the majorities which had developed at Bucharest,
 and in the preparatory meetings in October, and now in this
 conference, be strongly implied that concessions to the Chi-
 nese--concessions made in the interest of unanimity--were
 now at an end.   He asked the Chinese to reconsider their
 "dangerous" course and apparently asked them and their sup-
 porters to sign the draft declaration as it stood.  The
 Chinese, the Albanians, and the North Koreans reportedly
 remained seated during the standing ovation for Khrushchev?.s
 speech.
 Teng Hsiao-ping replied on the following day (24 Novem-
 ber).  With respect to questions of world Communist strategy,
 he stated the essentials of the Chinese position as these:
 the balance of power would permit an arduous struggle; such
 a struggle could be waged within the terms of peaceful co-
 existence; there was a possibility of avoiding world war
 but it was  neither possible nor desirable to avoid other
 types of war; and peaceful accession to power was very rare.
 He went on to defend Chinese actions during 1960 in pub-
 licly criticizing Soviet actions.   He stated that no Chi-
 nese errors had as yet been revealed, and he defended Chi-
 nese and Albanian behavior at this conference.
 In this second speech, Teng reiterated that the Soviet
 party could not expect other parties to support Soviet ac-
 tions taken unilaterally, that the road to unity was through
 consultation, and that consultation must lead to unanimity
 and not to the imposition of majority will.  As for those
 portTonns of the draft which reflected these questions of
 authority and discipline, Teng replied to Khrushchev's
 ultimatum by stating flatly that the Chinese party would
 "never" agree to an explicit endorsement of the theses of
 the 20th and 21st CPSU congresses or to the references to
 "nationalism" and "factionalism."  If these passages were
 excised, the Chinese would sign the document and the world
 movement would "once again" be united.

 Led by the French delegate (Thorez), some 23 delegations
 called upon the Chinese to submit to the will of the majority.
 Some 13 of these apparently had not previously declared their
 favor for the principle of majority rule, and these 13 brought
 the total to at least 43 parties which had so declared--a ma-
 jority of the 81'parties represented.   However, the next step
 was apparently not that of a majority demand for an immediate
 vote on . whether E e draft was to be signed as it stood. The
 conference decided to refer those portions of the draft still
 in dispute to a committee for a final effort to find accept-
 able language.  The conference adjourned to 1 December.
 At the time of the conference's adjournment on 24 Novem-
 ber, there were at least 62 delegations in the Soviet camp,
 in terms of supporting Soviet positions--on questions of
 world Communist strategy and/or on questions of authority
 and discipline--either strongly or on balance.  The only
 strong supporter of the Chinese party had been the Albanian
 delegation, but those who seem on balance to have been Chi-
 nese supporters were the delegations of North Korea, North
 Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, and Malaya, plus possibly Ghana.
 Several others bad been too evasive to permit a judgment or
 had represented split parties.   In terms of areas:   of theour
 12 countries of the bloc, eight were in the Soviet camp, f
 were in the Chinese camp (China, Albania, North Korea, North
 Vietnam); of the parties of the European community, 21 were
 in the Soviet camp, none was in the Chinese, and four were
 apparently neutral; of the parties of non-bloc Far Eastern
 countries, two were in the Soviet camp (India--the dominant
 wing.--and Ceylon); three were in the Chinese camp (Indonesia,
 Burma, and Malaya); and three were neutral (Japan, Nepal,
 and Thailand); of the parties of the Near East and Africa,
 12 were in the Soviet camp and one reportedly in the Chi-
 nese (Ghana); of the countries of Latin America, 19 were in
 the Soviet camp, none was in the Chinese camp, and two were
 neutral (Panama and Peru).
 Ho Chi Minh led the forces of conciliation after 24 No-
 vember.   He and like-minded figures arranged a conference be-
 tween Khrushchev and Liu Shao-chi on or about 25 November.
 Soon thereafter, evidently with new instructions from Khru-
 shchev and Liu, Soviet and Chinese representatives worked
 out some new formulations for the draft declaration.

 The 6 December declaration made pretty clear what took
 place in the meeting between Khrushchev and Liu, at least
 with respect to the draft declaration.       In the critical final
 section, relating to authority and discipline, the parties
 compromised on the question of endorsing the theses of the
 20th and 21st CPSU congresses--the 6 December declaration in
 effect endorses those of the 20th but not of the 21st, while
 nodding to the unspecified contributions of other parties;
 and the Chinese won their case completely with respect to
 omitting the references to "nationalism" in this context and
 to "factionalism" in any context.  With respect to the lat-
 ter point, the Chinese held out for, and got, language which
 can be plausibly presented by the Chinese as establishing
 the principle of unanimity.
 The 6 December declaration also gave an ironical cast
 to the question of what concessions Khrushchev made to the
 Chinese to induce them to agree to sign the declaration.
 That is, it was primarily Khrushchev, not Liu, who was in-
 duced to compromise.   Nevertheless, there are unconfirmed
 reports that the Soviet party had to make yet more conces-
 sions--e.g., promising to hold another world Communist con-
 ference within a year or two, and to return or to discuss
 returning the Soviet technicians.
 rushchev-Liu meeting answered the question, posed
 in terms of the two parties playing "chicken,"
 MOW e  er either party would be willing to swerve at the
 last moment.   In fact both swerved, but the Soviet party
 swerved much more.
 We cannot be sure why Khrushchev swerved, after so
 heavily committing his personal prestige against swerving,
 on these key questions of authority and discipline, ex-
 pecially that of majority rule.  There are at least four
 considerations;   that there seemed no prospect  of Chinese
 agreement to the principle of majority rule, no matter how
 long the conference continued; that the Chinese were not
 isolated, their camp consisting of seven or eight parties,
 possibly with additional supporters on the question of ma-
 jority rule; that there was a significant amount of neutral-
 ist sentiment; and that almost all of the parties hoped to
 avoid the kind of showdown that would be expressed in a vote,
 then revealed in the failure of the minority to sign the
 declaration, which would formalize and tend to perpetuate

 the split in the movement.  There is the possible fifth fac-
 tor--about which nothing is known--of pressure on Khrushchev
 by other Soviet party leaders.  We think that Khrushchev,
 having done his best, finally acted on his recognition of
 a situation which, in general, he had anticipated.
 When the conference reconvened on 1 December, Liu made
 his only reported speech, expressing particular satisfaction
 with the provision for further conferences of this type.
 Khrushchev made the concluding remarks of the conference,
 saying, in effect, that the conference had at least suc-
 ceeded in preventing an open split in the movement but that
 he did not know whether Sino-Soviet relations would improve.
 As both the Soviet and Chinese parties had made clear during
 the conference, and as both of them were to make clear in
 their very different. presentations of the 6 December declara-
 tion, the agreements were nominal agreements and the dispute
 would continue.

 The Issues
 Most of the leaders of the world Communist movement gath-
 ered in Moscow in November 1960 to discuss questions of world
 Communist strategy and of authority and discipline in the
 movement itself--and, if possible, to paper over the Sino-
 Soviet dispute on the basis of an uncompleted draft declara-
 tion prepared by a multiparty committee in October.
 There were delegations from 81 Communist parties,* of
 the 87 claimed to exist.  The Chinese delegation was headed
 by Liu Shao-chi, and included Teng Hsiao-ping and Peng Chen.
 Mao Tse-tung, who had attended the similar conference in No-
 vember 1957, on this occasion chose to underline his dis-
 agreement with and dislike for Khrushchev, and his unwilling-
 ness to associate himself personally with any compromise with
 Khrushchev, by staying home.   Kim I1-sung was the only other
 bloc party leader who did not attend.
 As the delegates arrived in early November, they were re-
 portedly given a copy of the draft declaration which had been

 left uncompleted by the preparatory committee when it broke
 off its work on 22 October, plus a copy or summary of the
 Soviet party's letter of 5 November to the Chinese party,
 plus a Soviet briefing in which the Soviet party asked for
 their support at the conference.
 The Soviet party letter of 5 November had reviewed the
 record of Chinese misbehavior and Soviet propriety, had re-
 affirmed Soviet substantive positions in the dispute in
 strong terms, and had demanded that the Chinese party re-
 spect majority opinion.*  It has sometimes been asked why
 the Soviet party, in circulating this letter before the con-
 ference began, brought up again the entire list of issues
 in the Sino-Soviet dispute when there were only four or five
 passages in the draft declaration yet to be worked out. One
 part of the answer is easy:   the Soviet party wanted to make
 clear to everyone that it had not abandoned or appreciably
 modified its positions, that the agreements reached thus far
 were nominal agreements.  The other part of the answer is
 uncertain, but seems to be this:   that the Soviet party was
 working for At least one hard agreement within the welter
 of nominal agreements.  That is, the Soviet party, while
 recognizing that it would have to settle for nominal agree-
 ments on most questions of authority and discipline as well
 as on questions of strategy, wanted badly to establish the
 principle of majority rule--the need for which principle
 was emphasized in the 5 November letter and in speeches by
 Soviet delegates at the conference.   By reviewing the entire
 case against Peiping, Moscow might reasonably have hoped for
 massive support for its effort to establish the principle of
 majority rule--a principle which would be much less suscepti-
 ble to subversion than were the equivocal and.evasive formula-
 tions on strategy, and which, while not obliging the Chinese
 to change their minds on questions of strategy, would oblige
 them to refrain from public attacks on Soviet policy and
 from other forms of "factional" activity.  The record indi-
 cates that the Soviet party did indeed have a hope of es-
 tablishing this principle until the final days of the con-
 ference, when, finding that a majority of parties supported
 the principle of majority rule itself but a significant minor-
 ity (led by the Chinese) did not, Moscow retreated from it.

 The preparatory committee had made remarkable progress
 in finding acceptable language for the draft. declaration with
 respect to questions of world Communist strategy.   It had
 done this, as the declaration issued on 6 December was to make
 apparent, by stating both the Soviet and Chinese positions on
 the issue or by offering evasive formulations.   As of 10 Nom
 vember,'the only such substantive question for which accept-
 able language had not been found related to the slogan of a
 world without arms and without wars as a Communist objective--
 a slogan opposed by the Chinese, Albanian, and Indonesian
 parties, and perhaps also by the North Vietnamese.
 The preparatory committee had been unable to find ac-
 ceptable language, however, on several critical questions
 relating to authority and discipline in the world Communist
 movement.   One of these was the declaration's treatment of
 the "cult of the individual"--no language yet proposed had
 been acceptable to the Chinese, Albanians and Indonesians.
 Further, the Chinese and Indonesians had opposed the proposal
 that the declaration endorse the theses of the 20th and 21st
 CPSU congresses--a proposal more revelant to the question of
 authority in the movement than to questions of strategy, as
 the theses had already been endorsed, with Chinese qualifiers,
 in discussions of particular questions in the draft declara-
 tiono   Finally, and of greatest importance, the Chinese par-
 ty had opposed any discussion of "factionalism" in the draft;
 the Chinese had been supported in this by the Albanians,
 while the North Korean, North Vietnamese, Japanese and Aus-
 tralian  parties had wanted a different treatment of this
 concept. The question behind this question was clearly that
 of whether the world Communist movement was to operate on
 the principle of majority rule, and a Cuban-Brazilian amend-
 ment to the draft may have put it in just those terms--i.e.,
 may have proposed that the declaration explicitly endorse
 the principle of majority rule and condemn factionalism?
 However, the weight of evidence indicates that the draft as
 of 10 November did not contain an explicit endorsement of a
 majority rule but rather made this point indirectly in dis-
 cussing "unity" and condemning "factionalism."
 The record shows that the Chinese, in the course of the
 conference, objected strongly also to certain passages in the
 draft concerned with "nationalism" or "national Communism."
 The reporting of Khrushchev's 10 November speech indicates
 that there were references to "nationalism" in the draft

 declaration at that time (just as there were in the declara-
 tion issued on 6 December) in the section on relations among
 bloc countries, and also further references to "nationalism"
 or "national Communism" in the final section of the draft
 declaration (which did not appear in the 6 December declara-
 tion), the section dealing with authority and discipline in
 the movement.  Teng Hsiao-ping's speech of 14 November re-
 ferred to "nationalism" in discussing this latter section,
 but the Chinese had apparently not put on record their ob-
 jection to this discussion as of 10 November.
 Khrush.chev's 10 November Speech
 The conference opened on 10 November with a welcoming
 address by Khrushchev.  The meeting was apparently scheduled
 to occupy no more than 10 days, as several of the delegates
 (including.Soviet leaders) had important engagements begin-
 ning on 20 November.  As it developed, the conference ran
 through 1 December.
 Following Khrushchev on 10 November, Suslov reported
 on the work of the preparatory (drafting) committee.   He
 reviewed the draft declaration, which seems to have been
 organized much as the 6 December declaration turned out to
 be, discussing the nature of the epoch, the building of Com-
 munism and the development of the bloc, questions of war and
 peace, the national liberation movement (the colonial areas
 and the underdeveloped states), the prospects for peaceful
 accession to power, and question of authority and discipline
 in the movement.
 Suslov also reviewed the issues on which, as summarized
 above, the preparatory committee had been unable to find ac-
 ceptable language--relating to a world without war, the "cult
 of the individual," the theses of the 20th and 21st CPSU con-
 gresses, and "factionalism" in the movement.   Of the 26 par-
 ties represented on the preparatory committee, the CCP had
 led the opposition on all these points, supported by the
 Albanians on three of the four, by the Indonesians on three,
 by the North Vietnamese on either one or two, and by the
 North Koreans, Japanese, and Australians on one.   As the
 conference proceeded, as issues were re-examined and other
 parties were heard from, these Chinese supporters turned out
 to support the Chinese position on other issues as well, and

 the Chinese and their supporters picked up additional sup-
 porters on various issues.
 Khrushchev then returned to open the discussion.   He be-
 gan by expressing his satisfaction with the assemblage and
 his hope that differences could be resolved.   He described
 the draft declaration as a sound Marxist document, and he
 went on to offer comment on all parts of it.*
 As for the Soviet assessment of the balance of power,**
 Khrushchev reaffirmed the Soviet position that socialism
 was gaining and the West declining, that the balance of
 forces was "in favor of" socialism, but that imperialism
 was still strong and in particular still possessed a power-
 ful military establishment.   One source has reported that
 Khrushchev at this point reiterated, for Peiping's benefit,
 that the West was not a "paper tiger."
 Khrushchev went on to reaffirm the bloc's increasing
 ability--deriving from its increasing strength-to deter the
 West from initiating either a world war or local wars which
 might lead to a world ware   He argued again that the absence
 rus c ev s    January report is an authorized version
 of this 10 November speech, although not presented as that;
 the report and the speech are very similar in both structure
 and detail.   However, the 10 November speech, made to a gen-
 erally qualified audience, contains a number of things Khru-
 shchev was unwilling to state publicly.
 **The question of assessing the balance of power has been
 argued by Moscow and Peiping in terms of defining the nature
 of the "epoch," terms which often tend to obscure the ques-
 tion: of. the Soviet formulation that this is a new epoch,
 an.epoch of.:the. disintegration of imperialism and the transi-
 tion from capitalism to socialism, versus the (occasional)
 Chinese formulation that'this is still the epoch of imperial-
 ism, wars, and proletarian revolution.   Such formulations might
 suggest that the Soviets regard the West as weak and the Chi-
 nese regard the West as strong; in fact it is the Soviets who
 have emphasized continuing Western strength.  The question
 which derives from the basic assessment, and which is not
 stated clearly in the formulations just given, is whether the
 balance of power commends a strategy of steady progress pri-
 marily by non-military means (the Soviet view) or of attempt-
 ing to make spectacular gains primarily through violence (the
 Chinese view.)

 of wars was not to the West's advantage, or, in positive terms,
 that peaceful coexistence favored socialism, and not, as "some"
 /the Chinese7 said, capitalism.   In this connection and in con-
 nection with his second topic, he reaffirmed the importance of
 long-range economic competition with the West.
 Khrushchev reviewed Soviet positions on principles of build-
 ing socialism and Communism, reportedly rejecting certain Chinese
 principles embodied in the "leap forward" and commune programs.
 He evidently called for better coordination of bloc economies,.
 in contrast to the Chinese aim of autarky.
 Khrushchev then offered a fairly full discussion of wars
 --world war, local wars, and liberation wars--along the lines
 of the Soviet party's 5 November letter and even closer to the
 lines which were to appear two months later in his long 6 Jan-
 uary,report.*  As for world war, necessarily involving the
 * t  s necessary here to offer a tedious recapitulation of
 Soviet and Chinese past positions on wars, becausetthe issue of
 attitudes and policies toward different types of war is so impor-
 tant in the dispute.  Although we do not have a full account of
 the Soviet party letter of 21 June, what we do know of that let-
 ter indicates that the Soviet party tended to avoid making a sharp
 distinction between "local" wars and "liberation" wars.  While
 Moscow affirmed its intention to support "just" wars in both
 categories, it tended to emphasize the bloc's ability to deter
 the West from "war" in general (not simply from world war), and,
 while affirming its intention to support "just" wars among local
 wars and liberation wars, it suggested a fear that wars of all
 kinds could get out of control and a reluctance to become substan-
 tially involved in wars of any kind. The Chinese apparently in-
 terpreted Soviet pronouncements in much the same way: the Chinese
 party's 10 September letter emphasized the need to distinguish
 between types of war, insisted on the inevitability of local wars
 and liberation wars, and called upon Moscow to adopt an appropri-
 ate revolutionary attitude toward all types of war; the letter was
 very scornful of what it took to be Soviet advice to the "people"
 everywhere not to undertake%. actions which might develop into lib-
 eration wars or local wars which might in turn develop- into a
 world war. In. that letter and in the October preparatory meeting
 for the November conference, the Chinese contended that some "lo-
 cal" wars; and all "liberation" wars were positively to We wel-
 comed, and thatfiere should be a 1es4,evasive statement of bloc
 support for these "just" wars.  Thus pushed into a corner, the So-
 viet party in its 5 November letter agreed that it was necessary
 to distinguish types of war, and it described liberation:  wars in
 colonial areas as both admissible and inevitable; however, the
 letter did not concede that local wars were inevitable, it appar-
 ently emphasized the bloc's ability to deter the West from local
 wars and from a maximum effort in liberation wars, and it con-
 tinued to evade the question of the kind and degree of bloc sup-
 port for "just" wars in both categories.

 United States and the Soviet Union, Communists must abso-
 lutely oppose world war, he said, and he reiterated that
 the West would be wary of initiating a world war.  As for
 local wars, defined as small-scale wars between states, wars
 also initiated by imperialism, Khrushchev said that Commu-
 nists must also be opposed (he may have said "equally op-
 posed") to local wars, owing to the danger of their expan-
 sion; he conceded that the West might undertaken such wars,
 but he did not concede that they were "inevitable," and in-
 deed he contended that such wars would occur less frequent-
 ly than in the past; citing the soviet action in the Suez
 crisis of 1956, he affirmed the objective of deterring or
 halting local wars before they could expand.*  As for the
 third category, wars of "national liberation" such as (he
 specified) the Algerian war-i ..e o , `wars by indigenous forces
 against colonial powers on their own independent governments
 --Khrushchev agreed that such wars were "inevitable" as long
 as.imperialism existed; he apparently described these wars,
 as he did in his 6 January report, as beginning in "popular
 uprisings" (he specified Cuba) and he reportedly went=.on,
 as in the 6 January report, to observe that such wars must
 not be equated (the verb used by Pravda is otozhdestvlytt")
 with wars between states (i . e o , 1:ocal wars) ; an     na ;-y, he
 described these wars, both in their early stages as ""popular
 *The implication remained that the Soviet party would
 engage in local wars if necessary, e.g., to protect an in-
 dependent government against a Western power if warnings
 proved ineffectual; Khrushchev in his 6 January report al-
 so left room for such intervention, noting that Communists
 were "in general" opposed to local wars, iee., wars be-
 tween states.

 uprisings,:  and their later stages as full-blown "liberation"
 wars, as "just" wars to which the bloc would give substantial
 assistance, including material assistance.*
 At this point, as in his 6 January report, Khrushchev
 reportedly reaffirmed the Soviet position on the disastrous
 consequences of general war, citing a Western scientist to
 the effect that up to 700 million people would die within
 two months of the first nuclear attack in a world war.   He
 reiterated that Communists had no right to put in jeopardy
 the bloc and the world's working-class.   In this connection,
 he'reaffirmed the importance of "peaceful coexistence" (en-
 visaging all forms of struggle except initiation of war) and
 of the effort toward disarmament.   He reportedly criticized
 those (the Chinese and others) who rejected the "slogan" of
 a world without arms and without wars.   He also reaffirmed
 the Soviet position that there were sober as well as irra-
 tional forces in the West and that it was worth while to
 meet with representatives of these sober forces--a position
 he reiterated in his 6 January report.
 in our discussion (pages 22-24) of, the
 passag   on war in    rushchev's 6 January report, we treated
 "popular uprisings" as a fourth category of,wars, i.e,. as
 civil wars, wars by indigenous forces against their independ-
 ent non-Communist governments.   However, re-examination of
 the 6 January report, of the Soviet party's letter of 5 No-
 vember, and of Khrushchev's 10 November speech, indicates
 that he has tended to describe these wars also as "libera-
 tion" wars and to employ the term "popular uprising" to des-
 ignate the earliest stage of a "liberation" war, whether in
 a colonial country like Algeria or in a country like Cuba
 regarded (until Castro's accession to power) as a semi-colo-
 nial country, one indirectly controlled by the imperialists.
 Perhaps Khrushchev will eventually make, in the interest of
 clarity, the kind of distinction--a distinction of type rath-
 er than one of degree of advance--which we originally thought-
 he was making,  We cannot tell whether Khrushchev means the
 concepts of "popular uprising" and "liberation" warn. to ap-
 ply also to civil wars in developed Western countries, coun-
 tries not (not thus far, at:least) regarded as ^- -part of the
 "national liberation movement"'; a distinction for the sake
 of clarity would seem proper here too.

 Turning then to the national liberation movement, Khru-
 shchev, as in his 6 January report, did not discuss here the
 importance of armed struggle in the colonial areas; be had
 said what he had to say in the earlier discussion of "libera-
 tion" wars--namely, that such wars were inevitable and would
 be supported.  He made indirectly here his point that mili-
 tary action was less important than other forms of action in
 gaining independence, by contending that the West was increas-
 ingly deterred from military intervention in the liberation
 movement. as a whole--i.e., in both colonial areas and the un-
 derdeveloped states--and that its other methods of seeking
 to maintain domination were in general ineffectual.  Giving
 most of his attention in this section of the speech to the
 independent states, he reportedly emphasized the importance
 (minimized by Peiping) of bloc aid to these states, contend-
 ing inter alia that such aid helped to develop the proletariat
 there.   He invited attention to the concept of "national dem-
 ocracy" as a transitional phase for the underdeveloped states,
 and,, pre-empting Chinese criticism of excessive cooperation with
 and flattery of bourgeois nationalist leaders, he called for
 "exposing" bourgeois leaders who progressive talk was only
 talk.*
 Taking up the question of prospects for peaceful acces-
 sion to power in both underdeveloped and developed countries,
 relating this question particularly to the question of tac-
 tics for Communists in developed Western countries, ** Khrushchev
 reaffirmed that the road to power might be either peaceful,
 which was desirable, or non-peaceful if the imperialists re-
 sisted by force.***  He went on to make the points, as he did
 oviet party letters to the Chinese party had insisted
 that Soviet policies toward bourgeois nationalist leaders had
 been successful, that these leaders were serving the objec-
 tives of bloc foreign policy, that they were not backsliding
 toward imperialism, and that the world Communist movement
 should not attempt to effect their early overthrow.
 **This is also An issue as regards the underdeveloped
 countries; Peiping holds that it is always necessary to "smash"
 the bourgeois state machine.
 ***He is not reported to have maintained in this speech,
 as the Soviet party had earlier, that there were increasing
 possibilities for peaceful accession to power; but be firmed the latter position in his 6 January report.

 in his 6 January report, that the Communist parties in the
 West faced great difficulties* and that these parties them-
 selves were the best judges of what tactics to employ, al-
 though he would advise them all to put more effort into at-
 tracting youth.
 Khrushchev then discussed "revisionism and dogmatism."
 "Yugoslav revisionism" was presented as a continuing danger
 (not, apparently  as the "main" danger), "whlle'.?"doatiSm" and
 "sectarianism" apparently as
 Albanian and other7 could become /s

 danger" at one time or another.  As in his 6 January report,
 Khrushchev related, through Yugoslavia, the two offenses of
 "revisionism" and "nationalism," observing here that the
 Yugoslav revisionists were using "national Communism" to
 separate themselves from the bloc.**
 Khrushchev gave most attention and emphasis to the need

 nese and other!) who objected to''the emphasis on "unity" in
 the draft declaration,   He reaffirmed the Soviet party's sup-
 port of the Cuban-Brazilian proposal on "factionalism" (no
 report has made clear bow this proposal was stated), which
 he immediately linked to the need for majority rule in the
 world Communist movement, a principle which the Soviet par-
 ty had been advocating strongly since the Bucharest confer-
 ence in June; the principle of majority rule was certainly
 the point, if not the manifest content, of the Cuban-Bra-
 zilian proposal.***

 not now revolutionary situations in the West, that the masses

 Khrushchev reiterated the Soviet party's abjuration of
 leadership of the Movement,* specifying that the parties were
 equal and independent, responsible to'the movement as a whole
 --an indirect and rather ineffectual way of reaffirming the
 principle of majority rule.  He reportedly made this point
 again indirectly in answering the question of how disputes
 between the parties were to be decided; he said that such
 decisions would be reached by discussions and exchanges of
 opinions, after which the parties must abide by the deer
 sions.**  He reportedly made the point yet again'in declar-
 ing that the parties must synchronize their watches (a fig-
 ure he had used twice before an similar contexts, and was to
 use again in his 6 January report), and that they must set
 them according to the draft declaration which had been ac-
 cepted by the majority of parties.
 *The Soviet party had first stated its wish to eliminate
 the concept of Soviet "leadership"--for tactical reasons--
 during..a meeting with other parties before the 21st CPSU con-
 gress in February 1959; Khrushchev had reaffirmed this posi-
 tion in the preparatory meetings in October 1960.
 **It may have been at this point that Khrushchev made
 his reported reference to Lenin on the principle of "unity
 in absentia," later (13 January) quoted by Red Star (see
 p. 33).  Lenin's point, in the origTnaT, was that
 ovie      party decisions were to have binding force on other
 parties if they reflected the majority will of the world
 movement, even if the Soviet party could not again consult
 with those parties.  The Soviet party at the November confer-
 ence presumably used this quotation in the absence of any
 statement by Lenin asserting more flatly that the world Com-
 munist movement should operate on the principle of majority
 rule, just as the Soviet:, party had used Lenin's statements
 on the need for democratic centralism in individual. parties
 to support the contention that democratic centralism applied
 to the world movement as well.  The Red Star presentation of
 the Lenin quotation, in the context 6Tdiscussion of the Mos-
 cow conference and the need for unity in the movement, made
 it quite clear that the Soviet party continued to favor the
 principle of majority rule, the principle it was unable to
 establish in the 6 December declaration.

 The Chinese Response
 The conference resumed on 11 November with a pro-Soviet
 and anti-Chinese speech by the Canadian delegate (Buck), fol-
 lowed by similar speeches (praising the Soviet party, crit-
 icizing the Chinese, with occasional reservations) by the
 Argentine delegate (Ghioldi), the Bulgarian (Zhivkov), the
 Iraqi (DOuri), the Cypriot (Papaionnou), the Lebanese (Shawi),
 the Swiss (Vincent), the Uruguayan (unknown), the Danish
 (Norlund), the Mexican (unknown), and the Dutch (De Groot).
 The pattern on 12 November was much the same, with all
 of the speakers supporting Soviet positions in general and
 most of them cirtici'zing the Chinese.  Those speaking were
 the Hungarian (Kadar), the Colombian (White), the Luxembourger
 (Urbany), the Greek (Koligiannis), the Nepalese (Raimajhi),
 the South African (?Khama?), and the Venezuelan (Faria).
 There was apparently no meeting on 13 November, a Sunday.
 On 14 November the first speaker was the North Korean
 (Kim Ii), whose speech was the first which  couldnn, not  b
 counted as one in support of Soviet positions; Kim was care-
 fully balanced, praising both the Soviet and Chinese parties,
 suggesting favor for one on some points and the other on
 other points, and emphasizing the need for unity.*  Kim was
 followed by Teng Hsiao-ping of the CCP, with a hard-hitting
 speech in his usual style.
 Teng reportedly spoke for four hours, replying both to
 the Soviet party's 5 November letter and Khrushchev's 10 No-
 vember speech.   After echoing Khrushchev's hope for eventual
 agreement on a draft declaration, he observed that he would
 be speaking in the name of the CCP central committee and Mao
 Tse-tung, and he said that the Soviet party's action in dis-
 tributing a 127-page document--the 5 November letter--on the
 eve of the meeting, a document which he described as a "vio-
 lent attack" on the CCP and Mao, had made it more difficult
 to achieve unity.   He added that the Soviet party was abusing
 the circumstance that the conference was being held in Moscow.
 *An assessmen  of the positions of all of the delega-
 tions whose speeches have been reported--79 of the 81 dele-
 gations--will be offered later in this paper, in a discus-
 sion of the situation which obtained at the conclusion of
 the debate on 24 November, at which time the conference ad-
 journed to permit the princips.ls to try to work out an agreed
 declaration.

 Turning to the first substantive issue, the balance
 of power, Teng defended Mao's past assessments of the world
 situation, protesting that the views attributed to Mao in
 the 5 November letter were not correct.*  It was perhaps at
 this point that the Chinese delegation distributed extracts
 from Mao's speech to the Moscow conference of November 1957.**
 Teng denied that the CCP looked on the epoch simplisti-
 cally, i.e., "merely" as an epoch of wars and revolutions.
 He reportedly said that Mao had "taught us" neither to under-
 estimate nor to overestimate the enemy, that Mao had agreed
 that world war was not inevitable and had "taught us" how to
 prevent war.   (He went on to make clear that Mao's teaching
 was the exhortation to struggle.)
 *The   November letter had charged the CCP, rather than
 Mao personally, with "erroneous views" on the nature of the
 epoch (i.e., the balance of power), views deriving from
 failure to recognize the strength of the camp, the profound
 changes in the balance of power, etc., so that the CCP put
 forth such mistaken theses as the thesis that war was inevit-
 able so long as capitalism existed.; this section of the 5
 November letter had charged Mao personally with offering a
 useless definition of the epoch in his concept of the East
 Wind prevailing over the West Wind,
 **The principal points made in the extracts circulated by
 the Chinese were reportedly these:   there was a "new turning-
 point" in the international situation (as of November 1957);
 the West was in a "state of panic" over Soviet successes in
 military technology; Peiping desired 15 years of peace, after
 which the bloc would be invincible; general war should be
 avoided if possible; however, half the people of the world
 would survive a general war, and one must not be "afraid"
 of war; revolutionary movements were justified in regarding
 the enemy as a "paper tiger," considered strategically over
 the long-term.   (Other sources have reported that Mao did
 indeed make these points in his November 1957 speech.)

 Teng then listed a number of developments favorable to
 the Communist cause since 1957, among them events in Iraq,
 Cuba, Venezuela, Colombia, Algeria and elsewhere in Africa,
 Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Vietnam, Argentina,  India, Western
 Europe and the United States.   This was preliminary to de-
 fending Mao's concept of the East wind prevailing, a con-
 cept criticized on several grounds in the 5 November letter.
 Teng derided the Soviet party for curbing "revolutionary;
 struggles" out of fear of a world war, a fear which he ap-
 parently dismissed as baseless.*  He went on to defend Mao's
 concept of the "paper tiger."   In reply to Soviet criticism
 of this concept in the 5 November letter, Teng reaffirmed the
 CCP view that it was necessary to have such a concept if
 revolutionary will were to be maintained.   He said that the CCP
 still held, as Mao had said in 1957, that the bloc should
 *This is the real point of the Sino-Soviet dispute about
 the nature of the epoch (balance of power).  The Chinese had
 previously argued, and may have argued again here, that there
 is not a new epoch but a new situation, a situation of deci-
 sive Communist superiority, a situation "unprecedentedly favor-
 able" for proletarian revolutions; that the struggle must not
 be renounced under cover of "prattle" about a new epoch; and
 that an aggressive prosecution of the struggle, in view of
 bloc superiority, will not lead to world war,  The Soviet party
 had not seemed to see a sTtuation of decisive superiority,
 and for this reason its discussions of   e  epoch" (balance of
 power) had contended both that (a) Soviet deterrent power
 permits the world Communist program to advance and prosper,
 and (b) the West is still strong enough so that the bloc
 does have to fear the consequences of a world war.

 strive for 15 years of peace,* and he denied the charge that
 Peiping envisaged the triumph of socialism through war.  How-
 ever, Teng continued, it was wrong to emphasize the dreadful
 consequences of nuclear war, because the effect would be to
 advocate surrender.   Teng reportedly reaffirmed Mao's assess-
 ment that half the population of the world would survive a

 in Khrushchev's speech of 10 November.   He denied that these
 wars could lead to world war.   Reaffirming the inevitability
 (not just the possibility) of further local wars, Teng
 reiterated that it was wrong to state an unqualified op-
 position to local wars and to affirm the objective of
 deterring or halting all such wars; he apparently cited again
 the Korean war as an example of a "Just" local war which had
 been not halted but fought, to the subsequent advantage of
 the bloc,*  As for "liberation" wars, Teng apparently reaf-
 firmed the entire Chinese case, welcoming the Soviet agreement
 that wars of this type were inevitable, pointing to the
 Chinese,  Indochinese, and Cuban wars as having turned out
 very much to the advantage of the bloc, criticizing Soviet
 evasiveness on the question of the kind and degree of bloc
 support of such wars, and calling for a much more ambitious
 program of bloc support of such wars.
 Turning to Khrushchev's point that it was worth while
 to try to negotiate with the West, Teng said that Communists
 should rely for "peace" chiefly on the world revolutionary
 movement (the bloc, the colonial and underdeveloped countries,
 Communist parties and sympathizers elsewhere), not on a "few
 bourgeois statesmen."  He reaffirmed that while exchanges or
 visits were acceptable, the "hope of peace" rested not on
 negotiations** but on the positive progress of the revolu-
 tibnary struggle everywhere, a struggle which would finally
 "impose" peace.   In this cbnnection,protracted struggles
 might lead to "soave" disarmament,*** but the bloc must  develop
 *He may have gone on to state, as Red Flag was son to
 contend publicly, that the Soviet party wasmuch exaggerating
 the dangers involved in participation in a local war, as
 such wars could be contained in the geographical area in which
 they began and the danger of expansion would become operative
 only if the West were permitted to win such wars.
 **The Chinese view of negotiations had been stated
 publicly:  that the only legitimate use of negotiations with
 the West was to play "revolutionary tricks."

 that Soviet disarmament proposals were useful only as a
 stratagem to isolate the United States,

 superiority in nuclear weapons,* and in any case the slogan of
 a world without arms or wars prior to the complete triumph of
 socialism was nonsensical.
 As for "peaceful coexistence," Teng went on, the Soviet
 concept of it as a state of coexistence between countries
 with different social systems was simply one of three
 principal features of coexistence:  the concept also
 entailed building up the strength of the entire bloc as
 rapidly as possiblb and providing Cab Peiping had long con-
 tended)the utmost possible support to revolutionary struggles
 all over the world.  Teng reiterated that a "cold war" had in
 fact existed since World War II, and he pointed out that any
 conceivable coexistence with the West would be "war of a sort."
 Whereas Teng had earlier dealt with the Soviet caveat that such
 struggles should not lead to world war by reaffirming the
 Chinese view   iat such a struggle could not lead to world war,,
 at this point he apparently argued-That even if an aggressive
 program were to incite imperialism to'war    ie impbrialis.ts.
 would be wiped"out in-such a war  and he applauded the,.i.nclu-
 sion of this point in,the draft declaration.**
 *As        P had long contended that the USSR itself already
 had superiority in nuclear weapons, Teng's formulation implied
 that other bloc countries--especially China--must develop such
 supery.
 **Some of these points were made publicly in a People's
 Daily commentary of 21 November on the November 1957 mee ing
 the Communist parties.  The editorial, illuminatingly en-
 titled "Give Full Play to the Revolutionary Spirit of the
 1957 Moscow Declaration," observed inter alia that the "famous
 dictum of Comrade Mao Tse-tung three years ago--that 'the
 East Wind prevails over the West Wind'--is perfectly
 correct"; that "any view that overestimates the strength of
 imperialism and underestimates the strength of the people.  .  .
 is completely incorrect"; that peace can be safeguarded only
 by "incessantly strengthening the socialist camp, the
 hepnational
 liberation movement, the people's struggles in
 countries,.  .   and by waging a joint struggle"; that "views
 which set in opposition the revolutionary struggles of the
 various peoples to the struggle for defending world peace
 are.  .  every wrong"; that "revisionists of different hues always
 make use of a certain /upposed?7 new situation to distort
 and adulterate Marxist=Leninist-revolutionary theory so as
 to lure the working class away from the correct path of

 Turning to the national liberation movement, Teng
 reportedly contended that if the Communist parties in both
 colonial areas and underdeveloped countries could reach the
 masses, they would be able to set up "people's regimes" ' there.
 As for the colonial countries, he reaffirmed the importance of
 "armed struggle" in those countries, although he did not deny
 that other forms of action could be effective.  As for the
 politically independent countries, Teng apparently chose to
 emphasize (contrary to the Soviet emphasis) Western success
 in preventing these countries from achieving true independence.
 Again,-"although he did not assert that Communist cooperation
 with bourgeois nationalist leaders was a mistake, he reaffirmed
 the Chinese line on the importance of striving for early Com-
 munist domination of the movement in this "democratic"' stage.*
 In this connection, while he is not reported to have explicitly
 criticized the ambiguous concept of "national democracy," he
 reiterated the Chinese emphasis on the unreliability of the
 national bourgeoisie, and he sought a clear distinction between
 progressive and reactionary bourgeoisie /at any stagW.and be-
 tween Communist alliance with the bourgeoisie in early stages
 and organization of an alliance against the bourgeoisie later.
 Further, he apparently cited the  n onesian Communist party as
 having the right attitude toward the bourgeois nationalist
 Sukarno government (i.e., the party was participating in a
 united front with the national bouregoisie while "exposing"
 the reactionary bourgeoisie and supporting solidarity with
 Communist China), and he specified the Soviet party
 *The     nese have- -a so held' that the Communists should if
 possible attain hegemony of the movement even before political
 independence is achieved, and, indeed, have emphasized the im-
 portance of armed struggle in achieving independence in part
 because such struggle affords the Communists the best oppor-
 tunity to take over the movement; the reporting of Teng's 14
 November speech does not indicate that he reaffirmed this posi-
 tion here, although he might have touched on it in his early
 remarks on Communist;  prospects for setting up "people's regimes"
 in colonial areas.

 Nor
 and Indian party as having the wrong attitude toward the bour-
 geois nationalist Nehru government, which was anti-Communist
 and anti-Chinese and had regrettably been supported by the So-
 viet and Indian parties in the border dispute with Peiping.
 Taking up the question of prospects for peaceful acces-
 sion to power and the related question of tactics for Com-
 munists in the West, Teng conceded that the circumstances
 of the parties in the West were difficult, and he apparently
 retreated from the Chinese call for revolutionary overthrow
 of Western governments.   He stated the CCP's favor, however,
 for a more aggressive effort within the united fronts to ad-
 vance Communist goals and to educate the proletariat for the
 coming struggle.   In this connection, he said, the Soviet
 party had grossly exaggerated the prospects for peaceful ac-
 cession to power, prospects which if anything were diminish-
 ing,.
 The Soviet letter of 5 November at this point had linked
 the prospects for peaceful accession to power with the asser;4
 tions that bloc power would increasingly deter imperialist
 "export" of counter-revolution-and that Communists for their
 part had no need to export revolution.  Teng at this point
 charged the Soviet party with taking refuge in the formula
 of not exporting revolution and, consequently, with failing
 to give adequate support to revolutionary movements everywhere.
 Teng then turned his attention to an earlier portion
 of Khrushchev's 10 November speech in which the Soviet lead-
 er, discussing the balance of power, had offered some remarks
 on principles of building Communism and socialism and had
 criticized some Chinese views.  Teng defended the Chinese
 practice of emphasizing "ideology and morality" rather than
 material incentives, denied that Peiping was "skipping stages"
 in its program, defended the "leap forward" and commune.:.    -
 grams, and demanded that the Chinese not be regarded as if
 they had the "plague."  Replying to Khrushchev's call for
 betterncoordination of bloc economies, Teng observed that
 each country must develop its own economy* and could later
 cooperate on a "voluntary basis."
 ne source reports that Teng said:   "We will continue
 to count on ourselves."

 Approved For Release 2001/04TOPAL,?IL7 ffBl27A   600040002-8
 Teng began his discussion of authority and discipline
 in the movement with a protest against Soviet efforts to find
 a "nationalist deviation" in Chinese policy.           This remark ap-
 parently reflected passages in the draft declaration to
 which Teng later was to make strong objectiofl.
 Moving from the denial of Chinese "nationalism" to an
 attack on "revisionism," Teng derided those who tried to
 "prove that Marxism-Leninism is outmoded," and he maintained
 that "any ambiguity" on these principles was dangerous.
 Taking note again of an effort by "some" to turn the Chinese
 charge of Soviet revisionism into a Soviet charge of Chinese
 nationalism, Teng denied that nationalism was a feature of
 revisionism; revisionism, he said, was simply the effort to
 disarm the proletariat and conciliate imperialism.*
 Teng conceded that the movement must also combat dogmat-
 ism and sectarianism, took note that campaigns against sectar-
 ianism were actually aimed at the Chinese party, alleged that
 the Soviet party had led this anti-Chinese "struggle," and
 contended that Sino-Soviet differences had in fact arisen
 when the Soviet party eased its struggle against revisionism.
 Teng went on to review Mao's long struggle against dogmatism
 in the Chinese party, and he apparently r.gpl ie;d. to the charge
 in the 5 November letter of "Chinese Marxism" by contending
 that Mao had creatively adapted Marxism-Leninism to China,
 in line with Lenin's own observation that Marxism had not
 been completed.**  As for Mao himself, the Chinese opposed the
 "cult of the individual" but continued to believe that the
 Soviet party had handled
 totrecognizeuthe?meritSAtl~.eadersly'
 that it was only proper
 and that parties needed leaders with prestige.
 *The CCPfs-10 September letter had observed that revision-
 ism was still important in the bloc, in the form of bourgeois
 influence in internal affairs and fear of imperialism in foreign
 affairs.
 **The Chinese had sometimes gone beyond? this to assert that
 Mao's thought was Marxism-Leninism in its "most fully developed"
 form.

 Finally, Teng had a good deal to say, as had the Soviet
 party in its 5 November letter and Khrushchev in his 10 November
 speech, on the question of achieving and maintaining "unity,"
 Unity was to be achieved, Teng said, through consultations,
 prolonged until unanimity could be reached; decisions could
 not be taken by a ma or  ty vote.  The Soviet party was mis-
 i en, Teng went on, in regarding Chinese criticism of So-
 viet positions and actions as a threat to unity; such critic-
 ism aimed at strengthening unity.*
 Returning to the question of majority rule, the ques-
 tion given the greatest emphasis in both,-.the 5 November letter
 and Khrushchev's 10 November speech, Teng observed that the
 principle of majority rule was correct for individual parties,
 as the parties operated by democratic centralism and the
 inferior organs must obey the central committee, which could
 reach its decisions by majority vote.   However, the world
 Communist movement was not hierarchical, all parties were
 equal, there was no central committee for the movement.   In
 this connection, Teng pointed out, the Soviet party's 5
 November letter had falsely attributed to Lenin the view that the
 principles for the conduct of intraparty affairs applied also
 to the world movement.**  Teng said that the Soviet party should
 criticize itself for this distortion.
 Teng reiterated that, if the parties could not reach
 agreement at this conference, they could leave the verdict
 to history.   In the meantime, while history was in the pro-
 cess of vindicating the righteous, the parties should con-
 tinue to consult, and perhaps within a "few months" the move-
 ment could affirm a new program.   In this connection, con-
 sultations should be conducted like the November 1957 Moscow
 conference, not like the vicious and rude" Bucharest conference.
 s was aC so ew a t more polite way of 'reaffirming, the
 Chinese position that unity could be achieved if the Soviet
 party would renounce' its erroneous views;
 **Teng was correct in this charge; however, Teng ignored
 the text from Lenin which Khrushchev had used on 10 November,
 one which did imply Lenin's favor for majority rule in the
 world movement; moreover,  the Comintern in its early years
 apparently did operate on the principle of majority rule.
