Chief, Operations Group 
SUBJECT: Trump-Conn Report 
1. For the first time in FBIS history we asked two consultants 
from the journalism world to take a look at how we do business on the 
Daily Report. The review of editorial procedures was conducted by 
Christopher Trump, Assistant Dean of the Columbia School of Journalism, 
and Stephen Conn, a free lance writer and former N.Y. Times corres-
pondent, now a consultant at Columbia. Their report is attached. 
2. Nhny of their observations and recommendations may not ring 
true to you, but keep in mind they had only two weeks at Headquarters 
and three days at Panama to gather their data. I think you will find 
the report interesting in any case as a look at FBIS from the 
"outside," a "journalistic" look at our editorial work. 
3. I have asked the Chief, DRD to evaluate the report and make 
appropriate recommendations by 15 November. Please ask all of your 
editors to read this report and forward comments to C/DRD by 
15 October. Similarly, you should of course comment. 
4. The report is not classified, but because there are numerous 
references to our parent agency, you should take care in handling it 
at the bureau.

Trump-Conn Report 
7 September 1979 
Don and Jerry: 
1. Attached is the Trump-Conn report. It is an interesting 
outsiders' view of the Daily Report and how we do business. Some 
of the ideas are naive, some are old hat, some have already been 
implemented (but presumably they wanted to affirm that they approved 
of them). Some are also worth serious consideration. 
2. Mbst significant are the recommendations as to how we 
publish the Daily Report, such as: 
+ Establish a true Managing Editor; 
+ Divorce the role of true editors (judgmental) from 
copy readers (preparing copy for the printer); 
+ Establish a separate desk where substantive editing 
would be handled; 
+ Stagger shifts to avoid typing bottlenecks; 
+ Perk up the "editing environment." 
3. There is much food for thought. I recommend as a starter, 
that Daily Report management be tasked to comment on the recommendations 
and came up with a plan for implementing the more significant ideas. 
I believe every editor, as well as bureau chief, be asked to read the 
report and forward comments to C/DRD. 
4. The last chapter, "Summation," stands pretty well alone 
and you may wish to forward it to DDS&T.

Dear 
August 28, 1979 
Attached is our Report of findings and recommendations based on our 
study of the FBIS operations in Rosslyn and Panama. We hope that you find 
at least some of our suggestions feasible and beneficial to your organization's 
mission. 
As we mention in our Report, we found this to be an extremely fulfilling 
undertaking for us and were impressed not only with the quality of the 
individuals working on the Daily Report but with the product as well. We feel 
strongly that if sone of the attached findings and recommendations could be' 
implemented, not only would the Daily Report benefit but so too would the 
performance, morale, pride in product and acceptance by consumers, which is 
already high. 
Please let us know if there is more we can do to be helpful, for example, 
in connection with the FBIS overseas editors' conference in October. In 
several areas, such as recruitment and training by professional journalists, 
we both hate had extensive experience. Consequently, we would be more than 
happy to work with FBIS in the future here or anywhere else that you and 
your colleagues think we milt be of assistance. 
We found this assignment challenging and stimulating. We welcome a continuing 
association, both on a personal and professional level, with the many members 
of your organization without shove cooperation and help this report would not 
have been possible. 
Please extend our thanks and appreciation to them all. Many contributed to our 
final Report by making themselves readily available and discussing FBIS's 
strong and weak points with complete frankness. The blame or credit for the 
final product, of course, rests with us alone. 
Sincerely,

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION 
In a period covering nearly two weeks in the Rosslyn (Va.) 
headquarters and three days at the Panama Bureau, we observed 
first hand the operation of the Foreign Broadcast Information 
Service (FBIS) and the production of its Daily Report. 
While we conclude that the production of such a comprehensive 
and professional product is indeed a "daily miracle," we also 
feel there is considerable room for improvement, both in the 
utilization of personnel and in the Daily Report itself. It 
should be noted that the Daily Report receives uniformly high 
ratings among consumers, both here and abroad. It is indis-
pensable to the work of many and in some instances, such as 
in the case of analysts of the Soviet bloc and the People's 
Republic of China, it is often the primary if not the sole 
source of information. 
It became apparent that the main attraction for editors work-
ing for FBIS is an overseas assignment. In the words of one 
editor, "In the entire editorial operation the worst job any-
one could be assigned to is the Daily Report. Anyone going 
from the field to Washington dreads this." Yet the majority 
of those being rotated back from field duty will go to the 
Daily Report. 
It is our contention that by improving the quality of the 
Daily Report and making the work of editors on the publication 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
2 
more challenging and more of an editorial function rather 
than merely one of punctuation and capitalization, a vast 
improvement in morale of stateside editors and in the qual-
ity of the Daily Report will result. 
The basic problem is that editors on the Daily Report are 
not being challenged and consequently have little or no 
pride in their product. This results in boredom, restless-
ness, and discouragement. The main objective for the edi-
tors becomes one of getting back overseas as soon as possi-
ble rather than one of turning out the best professional 
product. 
There are evident problems at headquarters, which directly 
affect the performance of the editors and the quality of the 
Daily Report. They include such dilemmas as: What should be 
done with editors who have rotated back to headquarters? 
What can be done to improve the strained relationship between 
editors and analysts so that they work together harmoniously 
and productively? What can be done, not only to recruit the 
best possible personnel, but also to retain them once they 
join FBIS? What can be done to restore the esprit de corps 
of bygone days that we heard spoken of repeatedly? What can 
be done to make the Daily Report a more professional looking 
publication, while still preserving its primary function of 
providing consumers with all the information necessary for 
them to fulfill their missions? What can be done to challenge

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
3 
and stimulate editors in their work, primarily in headquar-
ters, but also in the field bureaus? 
There are other questions that must be answered and we shall 
make recommendations here as well. They include: Where 
should the primary editing be done, in the field or at head-
quarters? How many levels of editing should there be? What, 
if anything should be done about indexing and cross referenc-
ing? What can be done to improve communication between the 
field and headquarters? What can be done to improve communi-
cation between management and the editorial operation? What 
effect will automation have on the editorial operation and 
the final product? How can recruitment and training be 
improved? What, if any, additional training should be re-
quired of editors? How can the delivery time of the Daily  
Report to consumers be cut so that the information is more 
timely and useful? How can the copy flow be improved? What 
can be done to improve a situation where, regrettably, the 
number of typists available and production plant limitations 
dictate the number of pages in the Daily Report? What 
devices can be employed to improve morale, the sense of pro-
fessional fulfillment and engender both a spirit of coopera-
tion and friendly competition among Daily Report editors? 
How can the image of this totally overt objective and pub-
licly available product of the Central Intelligence Agency 
be improved?

These are among the important questions we hope to answer in 
the sections that follow. Our recommendations are based not 
only on our 
also on our combined 
Christopher G. Trump 
periods of observation in Rosslyn and Panama but 
experience with related situations. 
is a contributing editor of Atlas World 
been a dean at the Columbia Graduate 
since 1965, working extensively in such 
Press Review and has 
School of Journalism 
areas as admissions and curriculum development. Stephen R. 
Conn, a former by-line correspondent for The New York Times, 
part of whose military service [Army Intelligence] was as 
the youngest officer in charge of the Information Office of 
the U.S. Army Intelligence Center, is a communications con-
sultant and free-lance writer. 
We consider the most significant areas of concern to be: 
1) the utilization of editors at headquarters and in the 
field and 2) the appearance, content and production of the 
Daily Report. Consequently we will concentrate our report 
in these areas. But we shall also discuss such topics as 
recruitment and training and the views of consumers regard-
ing the Daily Report. 
It should be apparent that while we were quite impressed 
with the personnel and the product, we feel there is room 
for improvement in terms of both. Even if FBIS were attract-
ing the best possible candidates under the present arrange-
ment, these individuals are not being challenged, utilized

or trained in the optimum manner. Through proper training 
and utilization both they and the final product, the Daily  
Report, will benefit and consequently, so will FBIS's cli-
entele here and abroad.

CHAPTER II RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING 
It strikes us that the principal need FBIS faces is the 
recruitment of editors for overseas assignments, the Daily  
Report and the wire service. The two-page flyer dated 
August 24, 1973 tends to dilute this urgency by also citing 
the "punditry" jobs available for those who would like to 
be analysts and the linguist positions open to those who 
know foreign languages. Frankly, that is not where the shoe 
hurts. 
Given the rotational imperative, which at one time may have 
been an attractive option to new employees, the dominant 
objective of FBIS recruitment should be for editors. The 
flyer should be discarded in favor of a brochure which hon-
estly spells out what an FBIS editor is expected to do; that 
the assignments overseas largely mean living, not traveling  
abroad and that Bahrain and Abidjan are as much on the sched-
ule as Vienna and London. We note the recent UPI report 
that the CIA had advertised in The Washington Post for a few 
good people: "One in a thousand maybe. You're a bright, 
self-reliant, self-motivated person we need to help us gather 
information. . 
Assuming some of the figures that were 
shared with us are reasonably on the mark, this means that 
ads such as this will garner 90,000 applications annually 
for some 1,600 CIA jobs. FBIS is in competition for the best 
of these applicants with other agency units. It ought

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
7 
aggressively to pursue them and a brochure that presents an 
honest description of work with the wire room, the Daily  
Report and overseas monitoring stations might make a dent in 
the rather large attrition rate that appears to hamstring 
the operation at present. 
Consider: We learn that average annual turnover of FBIS 
editors is 10-12, but that last year it was 20. This is a 
rather horrendous attrition of close to 25% of all editors. 
It may become a fact of life unless efforts are made to face 
the facts candidly: Overseas assignments are no longer as 
desirable because young people have already junketed around 
the world on cheap flights in their college days, tax lia-
bilities and inflation have eroded fiscal rewards and two-
career families find it impossible to cope with rotation. 
A brochure, coupled by personal follow-up consultation with 
fairly young editors (the believability quotient for such 
peer counseling is rather high, as we have found in our re-
cruitment efforts at the Columbia Graduate School of Jour-
nalism) will do much to target candidates with a greater 
likelihood of staying on. 
The other side of the coin is that FBIS, too, wants more 
than just a bright person, probably with an advanced degree, 
who thinks that travel is a marvelous way to spend a career. 
The August 1973 memo leads with the line that "FBIS editors 
are journalists as well as intelligence officers. . ? ?

Given this statement, a recruiting effort should be made for 
broadly educated persons with a potential for journalism. 
Work on a school newspaper, at the least, should figure 
strongly into such a background. The quality of the program 
pursued by the applicant should be reviewed as carefully as 
the grades received. In addition it would be well to request 
letters of reference, which when coupled with a personal 
interview, would probe the applicants' breadth of view, curi-
osity, persistence, resourcefulness and initiative. The 
final criterion is also the most elusive one: Motivation. 
The most highly educated person is essentially worthless as 
an editor if the pressures of the job, the constant rotation 
and the daily deadlines are incompatible with that individ-
ual's mindset. One question that should be probed of all is 
the one UPI asks its candidates for a job: Would you be 
willing to live and work anywhere? Any hesitation should be 
noted immediately -- a missed cue at this point means time, 
energy and dollars expended on training a potential washout. 
The final hurdle, the editor test currently in use for appli-
cants, is well structured and provides an excellent basis 
for making a final decision. However, since the nature of 
journalism is working under pressure, we would urge that the 
time limits be cut in half to 15-15-30 minutes. 
To sum up: Recruitment should be made a high-priority objec-
tive, with a brochure, programmed visitation to campuses and 
other central locations for interviews and a rigorous review

of all qualifications before an offer is made. Given the 
current high attrition rate, this should be a permanent 
effort for the foreseeable future, since some of those fin-
ally selected will not make it based on health and security 
screening. 
There are many potentially outstanding journalists -- in our 
better schools, news organizations and elsewhere -- who would 
be excited by the prospect of challenging editing work, serv-
ing the nation, overseas duty, excellent security (government 
service offers that) with good retirement benefits and the 
opportunity to use their skills, languages, studies and other 
professional and academic training. 
As one FBIS executive told us, "I got tired of being a starv-
ing wire service reporter." People should not be forced to 
leave the profession they love because they can't make ends 
meet. FBIS offers professional fulfillment, security and 
good pay for those who stick with it and perform. Based on 
current federal pay scales, FBIS is highly competitive in 
the journalistic marketplace. 
Our review left us with the impression that training is not 
as intensively programmed as it might be. We would urge the 
"cabin boy routine" used by the Norwegian merchant marine: 
no young recruit who aspires to an officer's position can do 
so without first serving as a cabin boy. For FBIS this means 
that all new editors would begin their careers in Washington 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3

learning copy editing on the Daily Report, while at the same 
time learning editing -- that skill which involves not only 
learning the FBIS editorial handbook (with testing along the 
way to measure progress!), diplomatic and cabinet lists, the 
GPO style book but also what news judgment is all about. An 
editor should be so trained that a blooper such as ". . 
reported by (?nodding) Carter" would be impossible. 
One young editor noted that within a year he had no less 
than five supervisors responsible for his training. While 
that may be fine to teach one to roll with a variety of 
punches, it is ruinous from the standpoint of a structured 
training program. Each new editor should be under the wing 
of a single mentor, who would work with him or her consis-
tently and make a progress report to management. 
In addition, news judgment should be taught by professional 
editors. For example, editors from the foreign desks of 
The Washington Post and Star could offer a course of instruc-
tion meeting once a week, conceivably in the evening. The 
experience of learning from such professionals is without 
parallel and has become institutionalized at Columbia. All 
of our editing courses are taught by newsmen drawn as adjunct 
instructors from New York's media. 
Once this phase of the training has been completed, the new 
editor should be exposed to the wire service, which offers 
more of the pace and excitement that will be confronted in 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
11 
the field. At the same time all new editors should be 
enrolled in at least one State Department FIS course and 
should develop a relationship of understanding with AG, as 
we shall discuss in Chapter V. 
In our judgment the present practice of sending new editors 
to TDY for three months' training in Panama or Okinawa is an 
excellent one it is the logical culmination of the inten-
sive training in Washington. The three-month tour is good 
as a target; but based on our investigation, it should be 
flexible -- some are ready for a full tour immediately, 
others may need a return to headquarters before being moved 
again to the field. 
The essence of our recommendation is that FBIS editors be 
treated as the professionals they are. This mindset should 
be reflected in how they are recruited and trained and in 
the development of their further careers at FBIS. For this 
reason we strongly urge that no editor returned from the 
field be put to work on the Daily Report as a copy marker, 
capitalizer, word counter and proof reader. These initial 
"cabin boy" functions are a misuse of their talents, the 
much more important work they could be doing for FBIS and, 
in the final analysis, the high salary they are paid. In a 
later chapter we shall make recommendations as to how the 
copy editing of the book should be professionalized, albeit 
with a lower level of personnel. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
12 
The primary personnel need of FBIS, as we see it, is for 
editors. Training on a programmed basis is essential to mak-
ing them the best possible editors to serve the mission, and 
most importantly -- there must be a progressive increase 
in responsibilities and duties to retain the ?n and work 
satisfaction of these editors. In the best of worlds they 
are the FBIS elite -- generalists in a world of specialists, 
savvy in a broad area, able to fix priorities quickly and to 
be cool under pressure. Duty in Washington should not be 
structured as a stay in purgatory, as appears to be the case 
now. 
Those returned from their first tour should be employed in 
training new editors at the Daily Report desks, revising the 
recruitment brochure, visiting colleges and other centers 
foy recruitment and meeting with applicants, taking another 
ir 
7TS course and continuing structured meetings with analysts. 
In addition it might be helpful if these editors could begin 
exercising some of the judgmental work on the book -- doing 
excerpts, condensations, cross references and placement of 
items. 
More senior editors would of course be employed as Daily  
Report book editors and branch chiefs. In addition they 
would supervise the training and carry on substantive revi-
sions of such major works as the editorial handbook. Also, 
editors on this level should each week prepare a critique 
for field offices of what it was that was sent in, how much

revision it needed; what was right with the copy and what 
was wrong. Apparently this was once common practice, but 
it has fallen into disuse. 
Finally, thought might be given to an eccentric rotational 
mode, discussed at greater length in the next chapter.

CHAPTER III UTILIZATION OF EDITORS: AT HEADQUARTERS AND 
IN THE FIELD 
The use of editors, both in headquarters and in the 13 over-
seas bureaus, is in our opinion at the heart of FBIS's prob-
lems. The best recruitment and training procedures are for 
nought if the individuals are not challenged and their tal-
ents and capabilities used in the best and most productive 
manner. We found this most pronounced at headquarters. 
Indeed the term "editors" is a misnomer. The headquarters 
function is not an editorial one. It is, in the words of 
one, merely "changing a word here and a word there, checking 
spelling and punctuation." As someone in the Panama Bureau 
put it, "The worst job anyone in FBIS could be assigned to 
is the Daily Report. Anyone going from the field to 
Washington dreads this. They dread the silly pencil marks." 
We feel that the drudgery at headquarters is one of the 
prime reasons for the high attrition rate, a loss of 12 out 
of 80 editors per year, with 20 lost in 1978. One solution 
to making the work for book editors more interesting is of 
course to make the Daily Reports more interesting and we'll 
deal with this in the next chapter. 
In this section we will consider how to use the editors to 
maximum effect once they have been recruited and trained. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3

15 
A. Editors at Headquarters  
Managing Editor  
We recommend a managing editor, executive editor, or editor-
in-chief to oversee and coordinate the work of the editors 
and the production of the Daily Report. This person would 
decide style based on the Style Book and GPO manual and 
would supervise the training of newly hired editors. The 
individual would also play a key role at the daily morning 
editorial meetings and would determine what is published in 
each book and the number of pages allotted to each. In con-
junction with the branch chiefs, he would also be the coun-
terpart of the Chief of the AG section. The Managing Editor 
would also determine the general priorities of stories. 
While on the topic we should like to call attention to 
several glaring misnomers used by FBIS. At present the 
"managing editor's" spot is vacant. While there is a chief 
of the managing editor's staff, the individual is actually 
the head of the typing pool. Editors at headquarters are 
called "information officers," but in fact are copy markers. 
Better to call them editors and have them perform editorial 
functions. The teletype operator is called a "communica-
tor." We want individuals to have titles that accurately 
reflect their duties and duties that accurately reflect 
their talents and capabilities. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3

16 
Branch Chiefs  
The duties of the branch chiefs should be expanded to 
include training of new editors. With new formats for the 
Daily Report, the branch chiefs will have greater latitude 
in layout, story selection and placement, makeup and general 
appearance of the books. In the succeeding chapter we rec-
ommend such innovations as editorial cartoons, boxes, sub-
heads and a summary at the beginning of each country sec-
tion. This will provide the branch chiefs as well as the 
book chiefs and the individual editors with greater oppor-
tunity to function as true editors and exercise editorial 
judgment. 
One of the major reasons for a reluctance to return to head-
quarters from the field is a lack of a challenge and suffi-
cient work. With a new format and greater emphasis on for-
malized training for new editors the branch chiefs will have 
plenty to do and simultaneously will be relieved of such 
trivia as copy marking. The branch chiefs, with their exten-
sive knowledge of the requirements for editors in the field 
and at headquarters, can be valuable participants in the re-
cruiting of FBIS editors and should be part of the interview 
process for new editors. 
Book Chiefs  
They should perform many of the functions of the branch 
chiefs with regard to layout, story selection, makeup and 
general editorial duties. There is a need for more querying 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
17 
of information from and suggestions to the field. Individ-
ual editors should have the authority to take part in this 
two-way communication with field editors, with such communi-
cations going through the book chiefs. As in any major 
newspaper operation, which is what the FBIS Daily Report  
production should be, coordination should come from the 
executive or managing editor. But the individual editors 
should have the authority and indeed should be encouraged 
to communicate directly with the field and with analysts in 
AG and elsewhere. 
Editors  
Editing should continue to be done primarily in the field. 
That still leaves a critical editing function in headquar-
ters. As one analyst observed, "Good editing at headquar-
ters is looking for the little mistakes that the editor or 
the monitor in the field would make." And the analyst adds 
that editors who have not been trained to look for such 
errors will only repeat their mistakes in the field. People 
abroad do err, often because they don't see the big picture 
as editors at headquarters might. Consequently, editors in 
Washington have the final responsibility for assuring that 
both the sense and the context of news items are accurate. 
One observer complained that all too often garbled passages 
in the Daily Report are labeled "indistinct" by the editor. 
Editors must be trained to query the field rather than taking 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
18 
the "indistinct," or easy, route. There is the danger that 
this passive approach to editing will also be repeated later 
overseas. 
But with the increased duties and responsibilities and oppor-
tunities for innovation there should not only be enough for 
the editors in headquarters to do, but the nature of the work 
should also change dramatically from what it is now -- that 
of capitalizing, checking spelling and punctuating -- to the 
more challenging and interesting tasks of putting stories 
and events in perspective, cross referencing, indexing, add-
ing editorial notes and in the case of minor straight news 
stories, rewriting. 
Morale  
All indications are that morale is at something of a nadir. 
In the words of one employee, "In the old days (1966, 1967) 
there was a pride in the product. That just doesn't exist 
any longer." Where editors now may be "clock watchers," in 
the words of one, "they used to come in at 6 A.M. and stay 
until 5 or 6 or until the job was finished." 
The decline in morale can be attributed largely to the lack 
of challenge in the work. Our observation of the editing 
process revealed it to be largely mechanical, primarily 
punctuating, capitalizing and pushing the copy that came in 
from the field through as fast as possible with very little 
editing, cutting, revising, rewriting and a minimum of querying. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
19 
We realize that most consumers want the major copy exactly 
as it was transmitted, but in the case of some minor stories 
(see attached non-edited and edited copy of story on pro-
cessing of secondary raw materials in East Germany) some 
editing and rewriting would be helpful. This would also 
enable a greater number of stories to be included in the 
books. 
The work at headquarters is by its nature tedious. Editors 
have to proof their own copy, a rarity in the news business. 
Doing so is not only demoralizing, but also a misuse of 
their talent. 
To have pride in one's product, one has to have participated 
in creating it. There is little or no creativity involved 
in the work at headquarters, aside from the selection of 
stories to run in the book and the sequence in which to run 
them. 
Staggering Hours  
To avoid long periods of non-productivity, maintain constant 
and up-to-the-minute copy flow, avoid a rush to meet daily 
deadlines and assure that typists have material to be typed 
when they arrive in the morning, we would suggest staggered 
hours for editors. For example, some editors might remain 
beyond 3 or 4 P.M. to sort incoming copy so that typists 
arriving at 8 A.M. the following day would be able to begin 
work. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3

20 
Rotation  
A key problem is what to do with editors who return to head-
quarters from the field. These experienced individuals must 
not be put "on the treadmill awaiting another overseas 
assignment," as one editor put it. They must not be reas-
signed to jobs that they have already performed. Rather 
they must

Among these would be helping

exists at headquar-
to recruit new editors 
by visiting college and university campuses, training new 
recruits, working with editors being sent to the field, par-
ticularly with those being stationed at the bureau where the 
recently returned editor has served, helping to update and 
revise style manuals and performing editorial functions that 
are demanded in the production of a genuine editorial product. 
We also recommend an eccentric rotation of editors, with per-
haps 60-70 percent overseas and 30-40 percent at home at any 
given time. The managing editor would be an individual with 
extensive book and field experience who would serve as M.E. 
for an extended period, thus giving stability and continuity 
to Daily Report production. 
When rotating to the field, editors should be sent to areas 
of specialization. They should have preparation for the 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
21 
bureau to which they're being assigned by having served on 
the book of the area, taken courses, such as FSI at the 
Department of State and language training at Langley and 
thus having acquired a basic knowledge of the area, its his-
tory, culture, mores, traditions, language, etc. While a 
good editor will go anywhere his publication wishes to send 
him, choice and qualifications rather than chance should be 
the guiding principle in assignments. 
Our conviction that additional area training and work on the 
book to which an editor will be deployed would be helpful is 
supported by comments such as the following: 
"Sometimes a new editor in the field will make a change [in 
copy] and an analyst at headquarters will think there's a 
new policy." 
"The Daily Reports are remarkably good . . . given the quali-
fications of the personnel," implying that the background and 
training of the editors are limited. 
"There is too much moving around among books. I know of one 
person who had been with three different books in four months." 
This constant moving around and deployment of individuals to 
areas with which they have little or no familiarity can re-
sult in editing errors, errors of fact and books that do not 
reflect the accuracy and dependability and authority for 
which FBIS has become known. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
22 
The rotation among books and overseas appears to be one of 
the main causes of the often tense relationship between 
editors and analysts. As one observer said: "The feeling 
among the analysts is what the hell do the editors know 
about the area?" 
The limited knowledge of the book editors on the particular 
countries can sometimes lead to embarrassing editing, accord-
ing to one analyst, who illustrated with a recent report of 
Moshe Dayan meeting in Alexandria with "Rais," which an edi-
tor in the field translated as "Israelis." But "Rais" is 
Arabic for "Chief," which was the manner in which Nasser 
used to be referred to and is now sometimes used to refer to 
Sadat. So the Report had Dayan meeting in Alexandria with 
the Israelis, which is ridiculous. 
Morning Editorial Meetings  
We feel the morning meetings would be more productive if 
there were a greater exchange among editors of story ideas 
and developments in their areas, particularly as they might 
affect each other's books. We'd also like to see the stories 
put in better perspective. 
As preparation the editors should have read The New York  
Times and Washington Post prior to coming to the meeting 
and listened to a recent morning newscast. Last-minute 
developments can change the importance of a story and even 
date it. This should be part of the effort to make the

23 
Daily Report as current as possible. We also urge that the 
Daily Report for the previous day be available for critique 
and reference at the meetings. 
We recommend that a senior analyst attend the morning meet-
ings to help provide guidance regarding AG's needs and facil-
itate the determination of editorial selection and priori-
ties. This is also an opportunity for the branch chiefs to 
coordinate their efforts, leading to a more equitable dis-
tribution of pages

and relating of events to each other in 
the world. It will also aid in cross 
duplication of items, help to put events 
generally affect editorial judgments for 
The editorial meetings also provide the setting for the 
competition we'd like to see among the books. And this is 
where the chief of the Daily Report could decide, based on 
the relative merits of the stories discussed, how many pages 
should be alloted to each book. This would encourage edi-
tors to dig up good stories, ferret for news in their 
areas, and generate copy that will help make a superior pro-
duct and one that is even more useful -- and indispensable 
-- to consumers. 
One of the highlights of the editorial meetings should occur 
when the page allotments are announced by the chief of the 
Daily Report. This should be strictly an editorial decision 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
24 
based solely on the importance of the news and not the 
number of typists available to produce copy on any given 
day. 
Environment  
All areas of the editing operation, not just the wire room 
(the busiest editorial facility in headquarters), should hum 
with the activity of a big city newsroom. There should be 
constantly ringing phones, editors seeking additional infor-
mation from analysts, consumers and the field. The editor-
ial operation is now much too passive. Pride must be engen-
dered in the importance of the headquarters operation as a 
world news center. 
B. Editors in the Field  
Qualifications  
FBIS editors are hired primarily for assignment to the field. 
Their recruitment and training should be undertaken with that 
in mind. Consequently, FBIS should be looking for individ-
uals who are "hungry for journalism," hard working, self-
starters, eager to get the proverbial scoop or big story, 
and eager to beat the competition. They should have good 
general liberal arts backgrounds and a thirst for current 
events. A fluency or near fluency in the language of the 
area to which they may be eventually assigned would be help-
ful but not necessary. This would be most beneficial regard-
ing life in the particular country and deriving the maximum 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
25 
from living among the native population and absorbing the 
culture, history, tradition, mores and whatever else the 
country may offer. Editors who are to serve abroad should 
also exhibit flexibility and versatility, be cool under 
pressure, be able to supervise and work well with people, 
be able to establish priorities and be able to adapt easily 
to new and strange environments. 
Duties  
Since the primary editing is done in the field bureaus, edi-
tors serving abroad should have received thorough training 
at headquarters from seasoned FBIS editors who have served 
in the field and adjunct editors from news organizations in 
the Washington area. All editors should have training on 
the wire in headquarters prior to field service, and during 
their TDY stints in the field they should be exposed to 
every situation they will encounter when assigned abroad. 
Field editors and monitors should work very closely on 
stories, particularly with regard to assessing their impor-
tance, putting items in perspective, and selecting stories 
for transmittal back to headquarters in order to assure that 
the best items are being transmitted. With a total of 
300,000 words filed from the field daily and just above 
200,000 words published, it is important that the priority 
items are filed. To best assure this, coordination among 
monitor, editor and bureau chief is mandatory. A field 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
26 
editor's primary responsibility is to assure that the 
monitor is faithful to the original material. 
In addition to the most accurate translations possible, the 
headlines must correctly reflect the stories. Subheads may 
be left for editors at headquarters, who do the final selec-
tion of stories to run in the books, the packaging and the 
final checks. 
We observed the Panama bureau during an obvious lull, but 
we feel that based on what we observed the bureaus probably 
have more than enough editors and monitors. One of our rec-
ommendations is to have "flying squads" of editors at the 
ready in headquarters, to be dispatched to any bureau in the 
event of an emergency or particularly big story development. 
These editors should be ready to react swiftly -- without a 
lot of red tape -- to requests for aid from the field. The 
potential saving in a slot or two might more than offset the 
increased travel budget, while the excitement of being "on 
call" may very well appeal to certain editors who in fact do 
prefer to travel more than live in any one place for too 
long a time. 
One of the veteran monitors in Panama acknowledged that 4 to 
5 monitors per shift would probably be adequate, rather than 
the customary 6 to 7. Obviously, in addition to monitoring 
of radio and TV broadcasts in the bureaus, monitors could 
review more of the area's newspapers as sources of news and

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
27 
other developments. Monitors also could be kept in reserve 
since the bureaus seem to resemble a "fire department" in 
many respects, waiting for the big story to break. 
Just as at headquarters, editors must develop good sources 
of stories, similar to the manner in which a professional 
journalist develops reliable news sources. It's also impor-
tant to maintain contact with consumers, not only to keep 
abreast of their needs but also to keep them as potential 
news and information sources. 
It was pointed out to us in Panama that the biggest differ-
ence between editors in the field and those at headquarters 
is that "the raw copy is here. A lot of editors in Washington 
would fall on their face if they had to handle copy in the 
field." This, according to the speaker, is a result of the 
new editors in Washington not being taught really how to 
edit. Another recommendation would be to have the editors 
in headquarters handle raw copy as an exercise during their 
formal training. 
An interesting project for the Panama editors, which we would 
hope the other bureaus have adopted, is a periodic survey of 
radio and TV stations evaluating them for accuracy, their 
editorial and political slants, their programming, hours of 
broadcast, frequency of newscasts, reliability of newscast-
ers, etc. This is helpful in assessing the credibility of 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
28 
various stations and their commentators. The survey should 
also be extended to newspapers and magazines. This would 
not only be a tremendous help to editors in the field in 
evaluating their sources but would also provide similar 
service to consumers here and abroad and to the FBIS editors 
and analysts in Washington. 
A number of interviewees felt a greater need for negative 
FYI's from the field. As has often been said, the most im-
portant thing a person can tell you is what he does not 
tell you. 
As a result of better and more comprehensive training on 
the editorial and substantive levels at headquarters, edi-
tors in the field will be more qualified to perform the 
duties of a foreign correspondent, which are to keep on top 
of all the news in his or her area, have reliable sources 
available at all times and not be surprised by sudden events. 
In summation, regarding the use of editors at headquarters 
and abroad, we recommend: 
1) Hiring persons with a potential for professional journal-
ism and having all new editors (regardless of background or 
professional qualifications) start at the lowest editorial 
rung and work their way up. 
2) Improved training as detailed in chapter two. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
29 
3) Experienced editors working as mentors on a one-to-one 
basis with new editors. 
4) Mastery by all editors of the style book and GPO manual. 
5) Encouragement of editors at home to query field editors, 
analysts, sources and other experts in their area when ques-
tions exist, so that the Daily Report is as accurate as 
possible. 
6) Relieving editors at headquarters of proofreading, free-
ing them for more creative work. 
7) Using editors who have been rotated back to headquarters 
for more important editorial roles than those they had prior 
to going overseas, such as training, supervision, produc-
tion of a "News in the Week in Review," for each of the 
books, which puts the week's events in historical perspec-
tive (see the following chapter). 
8) Where possible, rotation of editors to the area of the 
book on which they have worked. In addition, a longer per-
iod of service on a book would benefit both the editor and 
the editorial product. 
9) Staggered hours for editors and staggered deadlines for 
copy to improve copy flow and facilitate typing. 
10) Greater interchange at editorial meetings so that each 
branch chief will be apprised, knowledgeable and appreciative 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
30 
of the others' editorial needs, with full participation 
daily by a senior staff member from AG. 
11) Greater cultivation of sources both in the field and at 
headquarters to help facilitate obtaining the best and most 
accurate material for the Daily Report. 
12) Training of all editors on the wire before overseas 
assignment.

CHAPTER IV THE BOOK 
The overall impression of our analysis of the Daily Report  
is that it is indeed a daily miracle, the synthesis of hun-
dreds of millions of words of news monitored worldwide annu-
ally and turned out five times weekly in 8 books a day num-
bering some 400 pages of type, for an annual total of more 
than 50 million words. These are mind-boggling figures, 
made all the more remarkable by the fact that the Daily  
Report is the product of some 80-90 editors in a hand-hewn 
operation -- not counting the two envelope stuffers at the 
end of the line in Langley. It is by any measure an impres-
sive accomplishment -- journalistic because it is news and 
because it is printed. 
Yet we would submit there is much that can be improved. 
Because it is primarily archival material for use by the 
intelligence community, there is little that can be done 
with the material to transform it into a journalistic pro-
duct in the accepted, mass circulation sense of the term. 
Therefore editors working on the book suffer from restric-
tions that make them feel more as "paper shufflers" or 
"funnels" than as editors who truly shape their output. 
Over and over again we heard the expressed desire of editors: 
"We want to take pride in our work." How to achieve this? 
It seems to us that the recently created joint publications 
review committee is an excellent step in the right direction 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
32 
to begin to grapple with this issue. The presence of AG 
within FBIS has the merit of keeping the editors on the mark 
-- attuned, if you will, to the needs of the intelligence 
community. The drawback is that AG's concern is solely with 
communist propaganda. Page after page in the editorial 
handbook is concerned with mandatory texting. While we are 
not in a position to quibble with that which is mandated, it 
would seem that some of the larger forest is being ignored 
for the shrubs and brambles in the foreground. For example, 
B.81 mandates that all "Soviet appointments down to the 
USSR oblast first secretaries . . ." be published. Not 
denying the importance of this, would it not be just as 
helpful if the daily appointment schedule of the Japanese 
prime minister were also published? (A point mentioned by 
a consumer.) 
On another level, there are enormous forces at work in the 
world that go well beyond communist leadership polemics. 
What we are saying is that the Daily Report seems to be 
mired in a plethora of minutiae -- page after page of textu-
al material which, while faithfully recorded, translated 
and printed, misses some of the larger issues in the world. 
While not detracting from the nuances that might be extrac-
ted from four versions of a 15,000-word Politburo member's 
speech, we submit that other voices bearing messages of 
ominous dimensions are being broadcast and printed in the 
world and may not be receiving acequate coverage by the 
Daily Report. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
33 
Consider the Third World, largely ignored by the established 
media. FBIS really affords the most significant flow of 
information from this part of the world, yet these particu-
lar books are the smallest in scope. Ought that situation 
be reexamined? Egypt built the Aswan to feed an additional 
4 million mouths, yet had a population gain of 10 million by 
the time the dam was completed. At its present rate of re-
production, in 100 years Mexico's population will exceed 
that of the entire world today. In nine years the worldwide 
catch of fish has remained stagnant while population has 
increased 13%. In 25 years land under cultivation globally 
has declined 24% per capita. It is issues such as these, 
often ignored by editors, that trigger events that later 
seem to have hit from the blue. Not to belabor the point, 
it would seem that new ways might be found to make the 
published Daily Report a more comprehensive, less repetitive 
product while at the same time meeting the needs of AG with 
special wire supplements. 
Editors in the field together with the Daily Report staff 
in Washington could play a key role in enhancing the sub-
stance of the book, and through this very process improv-
ing enormously the quality of the product. But management 
must take the lead (through such forums as the publications 
review committee) in forging an effective liaison with AG --
in casting a broad net for coverage, through increased 
cruising, translation of additional daily newspapers on a 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
34 
more immediate basis and broader exercise of editorial 
judgment. 
A quality product in terms of substance is one that indeed 
serves as the eyes and ears of the world. It would cover 
completely broadcasts and press reports of closed societies, 
such as the Soviet Union and China, but shift gears in pro-
viding more reaction and editorial analysis from open soci-
eties, such as western Europe and Japan. Finally, a very 
large effort should be made to expand coverage in Africa, 
the Arab world and Latin America. Again, management must 
provide the impetus. If signals from Honduras and El Salvador 
are too weak to pick up in Panama, then steps should be taken 
to cover these nations gripped in social unrest with monitors 
on the site (as was done in the sixties when the Dominican 
Republic was in turmoil) or by asking embassies to forward 
selected press clippings on a rush basis for review and pos-
sible translation. If there is a Panamanian reaction to the 
Bolivian election debacle, this should be run, not ignored 
because Bolivia is in Asuncion's area of coverage. 
We strongly urge a "News of the Week in Review" section for 
each book as a means of stitching together seemingly unre-
lated events in various parts of the world. Such a section 
done weekly on a "space available" basis would provide a 
handy, pull-out index section for consumers. It would be a 
challenge to the best editors to synthesize and build bridges 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
35 
between their books that appeared in a five- or seven-day 
span. It might encourage consumers to glance through a few 
pages of such solid data for the larger picture they might 
derive from such exposure. The best journalists are gener-
alists -- aware of all that is taking place. The review sec-
tion would strongly make this point as well, better serving 
consumers. 
A better book will inevitably mean a healthier mindset on 
the part of the editors as they approach their work. With 
accurate, carefuly edited material coming in from the field, 
editors in Washington can then concentrate on selection and 
placement, on editorial notations and much more extensive 
cross referencing. The latter is something the reports are 
deficient in. To achieve it may mean that the morning edi-
torial meeting will have to take place a bit later and 
involve a much more substantial discussion of what is going 
into the books. Given the 420-page limitation daily for all 
eight books, cross referencing could well mean the differ-
ence between repetition and deletion of other material, or 
tightening the copy and being able to run something more than 
the 50-60% of the wire copy flow that is run at present. 
The most obvious problem with the Daily Report is that there 
seem to be insufficient hands to type the pages. The fact 
that the daily editorial meeting awaits word on how many typ-
ists may have shown up is absurd on the face of it and 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
36 
demands immediate attention by management. No newspaper 
worthy of the name could survive if the daily editorial meet-
ing depended on the pressmen to come in and say that only 20 
pages could be run that day because too few printers showed 
up for work. In examining the June schedule of page requests 
and the number of typists appearing for work on each day of 
the month we note that in all cases the number of pages re-
quested exceeded the limit placed on the books by Langley --
ranging from 490 to 562. Only on two occasions were 20 typ-
ists on hand and on one occasion only 9. On the Monday when 
562 pages were requested only 13 typists were available. It 
is a credit to the managing editor's staff that 342 pages 
were typed and that for most of the month close to 400 pages 
were typed daily. 
In our view management should correct this situation by 
either moving to an all in-house capability or farming the 
entire operation out. Budgetary constraints may preclude 
bringing the in-house complement back to the 1972 level of 
37 typists. But the present arrangement of half the typists 
on the 11th floor and half in the Kelly pool in the lobby 
area leads to confusion and worse. Each half of the opera-
tion in effect counts on the other, with frustration on both 
sides when targets cannot be met. Our recommendation is to 
contract out the entire typing operation, calling for bids 
that require daily typing of 400 pages within a specified 
period of time. It might be a tall order for a smaller 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
37 
community, but certainly in Washington it is not beyond the 
realm of probability. Given the fact that the material 
should be edited carefully before it is in the hands of the 
typists, the contract should also include proofing. 
Following this move, the managing editor's staff -- as the 
title implies -- could devote itself to the copy editing of 
the book. This function, as distinct from manuscript edit-
ing, involves word counts, capitalization and copy marking. 
We were impressed with the performance of the part-time con-
tract editors we observed and had a chance to interview. 
They are persons of intelligence and dedication. To recruit 
more like them would finally free book editors of the dismal 
chores of knitting and tatting and which, in effect, keep 
them too busy to be concerned with the overall quality of 
the Daily Report. This description of copy editing is not 
meant to demean the function, but simply to acknowledge that 
it is different work -- just as the copy desk of The New York  
Daily News is different from the national desk, which selects 
and edits stories from a judgmental standpoint before they 
are passed on to the copy desk for final editing and word 
count. 
Further, such a professionalization would tap a new pool of 
talent -- persons interested in the world about them, in the 
FBIS mission, but not necessarily in travel abroad. Such 
individuals could provide an element of stability and 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
38 
continuity to the editing of a book simply because they 
could remain with it for an extended period of time. And 
such experience will have a remarkable effect on the final 
product, in addition to freeing the book editors for more 
important work. 
This recommendation would institutionalize what necessity 
has apparently already mandated. At the time we made our 
inspection the editor with the longest tenure in residence 
was a contract employee with 1 1/2 years experience. One 
such person for each book would be an excellent way to put 
the recommendation to a test. It should be noted that fis-
cal exigency forced us to use part-time staffers at Columbia 
Journalism, and on the whole we found that there are well-
qualified people out there eager to work in an interesting 
environment. 
In fact, once stability has been brought to the vital pro-
cess of the copy editing, typing and proofing, the managing 
editor can devote time and attention to the appearance of 
the book. In part, book editors will contribute to this 
effort by providing maps and cartoons. Given the intrinsic 
worth of many political cartoons (recall some of the best of 
Krokodil) and the clarity afforded by maps, their use would 
provide much more than visual impact. We are not calling 
for a New Yorker magazine. But in keeping with the archival 
role of the Daily Report, surely judiciously selected 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
39 
visuals would enhance its worth as well as its appearance 
(see appendix for cartoon used in Atlas World Press Review) . 
In our view the book would be greatly improved if a two-
column format were used. The technical difficulties posed 
by present typewriters appear to have been resolved by the 
QYX units under consideration. Both from the standpoint of 
readability and aesthetics, the two-column would lift the 
product from the level of a tenants' newsletter. For the 
same reason we recommend that upper-lower case typing be 
continued, but that the micro-elite typeface be replaced by 
something more readable, such as letter Gothic 12 -- a 
crisp, clear, sans serif type that lends itself well to the 
15% photographic reduction of pages contemplated for future 
issues. We append a copy of a Daily Report page in two-
column prepared by the managing editor's staff on an IBM 
electronic typewriter. Even though the type is standard 
size, there was no loss of wordage from the original. In-
deed, we have added a sub-head to improve readability. We 
recommend that reports in the future have boldface heads and 
sub-heads, to distinguish them clearly from the copy that 
that has been faithfully translated. We also suggest that 
italics be used for the key word indexing code (see section 
on automation) . Finally, the use of boxes for briefs, cross 
references and editorial notations would break up the pages 
and lead the reader's eye to items of importance. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
40 
The cover seems to have undergone a change since we first 
embarked on this project. Graphically the move from the 
rather fuzzy, cross-hatched type to a boldface format was 
a good one. While cost may preclude any changes in the 
rather anemic color scheme used to differentiate the books, 
we suggest that a logo stylizing the geographic areas of the 
various books be considered. 
Granted, many satisfied consumers of the Daily Report told 
us that they would read it even if printed on plain brown 
wrapping paper. But there is no denying that all who have 
a hand in its production will take a greater pride and find 
more joy in working on a product that each day is not only 
readable but also pleasing to the eye. Some consumers were 
adamant in keeping the full-page format because that is how 
their files were set up. It is our hope that the eventual 
introduction of an indexing system (see chapter on automa-
tion) will make it possible to retrieve full texts on display 
terminals and, if desired, in hard copy, thereby obviating 
the need for clipping and manual storage.

CHAPTER V COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION 
We saw evidence of a greater need for communication and 
coordination both in headquarters and in the field. 
A. AG/Editor Relationship  
Analysts should not be viewed as Molochs to whom young edi-
tors are fed, but as the principal consumers of the Daily  
Report. There seems to be an uneasy relationship between 
analysts and editors, which has an adverse effect on the 
final product. In a sense, as will be noted in the next 
chapter, AG is not -- as was mentioned to us half-facetiously 
-- "the equivalent of the New York Public Library telling The 
New York Tines what to print," but rather more like the pub-
lisher of The New York Times. The liaison between editors 
and analysts ought to be much closer. 
In the words of one editor, "The editors think the analysts 
are dictatorial and arrogant and the analysts think that 
editors are ignorant." These judgments stem largely from 
the fact that analysts are experts in their areas and edi-
tors tend to be generalists with little area expertise. We 
have already recommended additional area and language train-
ing for editors. Beyond that we endorse the concept of 
"taking an analyst to lunch." 
One of the most confident editors we interviewed literally 
took an analyst to lunch now and then, mainly because long 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
42 
experience on the Daily Report in Washington had built up 
a level of confidence that helped make for such meetings on 
equal terms. It is an ideal we would like to recommend as 
an objective -- as something to be built into the training 
program. 
On major newspapers, i.e., The New York Times and The 
Washington Post, each foreign correspondent generally has 
counterpart on the foreign copy desk who edits his copy, 
queries and TWX's him and in this sense works together with 
the reporter on the story. This is the sort of relationship 
we'd recommend for FBIS. The book editors should work with 
specific analysts on a regular and continuing basis to 
assure accuracy and also to be certain that proper judgment 
is exercised in story selection and play in the book. 
a 
There should be frequent briefings of editors by analysts 
and closer continuous contacts between the two. Conversely 
when an editor rotates back to headquarters from an overseas 
assignment, he should brief the appropriate analysts on recent 
developments in the area. One reason for the infrequent con-
sulting among editors and analysts seems to be the fact that 
editors would feel intimidated as a result of their lack of 
expertise and knowledge. A closer working relationship 
between both would help to eliminate this. We also observed 
that analysts often request specific information after the 
fact: they want material that has not been published in the 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
43 
Daily Report. It would help if analysts were more aggressive 
in alerting editors to some of the material they need ahead 
of time. 
One editor told of the time that AG wanted all the speeches 
of each member of the Soviet Politburo as reported by TASS, 
Pravda, Izvestia and the provincial papers. This came to 14 
speeches from four sources and all the speeches were at least 
10,000 words long. The Daily Report was unable to meet this 
request since the editors had not received sufficient advance 
notice from AG. "We need better liaison with the AG so that 
we can plan in advance for something like this," the editor 
said, "and it must be done over several days." 
Most analysts at Langley do not know how to reach editors 
at FBIS. One of the reasons for this must be the relative 
anonymity of the editors. As one observer noted, "I know 
who all the analysts are. But I don't think I know the name 
of one editor on the Middle East Book." This problem can be 
eliminated through a closer working relationship between 
editors and analysts. 
B. Management Supervision  
One editor complained of a lack of contact with management 
and suggested that morale might be improved if occasionally 
a top FBIS manager strolled through the Daily Report area 
and spoke briefly with the editors. "Basically the people 
in the Daily Reports are ignored by the higher ups," aaid 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
44 
this editor. "I've seen a lot of editors come and go because 
they feel ignored and frustrated." 
As a corollary to this a "Winners and Sinners"-type publi-
cation published on a regular basis and praising good edit-
ing would improve esprit. Editors would be identified by 
name for good work, while lapses would be identified by 
example. At the discretion of book editors we would also 
suggest running the initials of the individuals in the field 
(monitor and editor) and at headquarters (editor) at the con-
clusion of certain items in the Daily Report. In this way 
people will feel their work is being recognized and they are 
receiving credit for their efforts. 
Just as on many major newspapers the publisher sits in as an 
observer on editorial meetings, we would recommend that man-
agement occasionally attend the morning editorial meetings. 
This would be part of the process of assuring editors that 
their efforts were central to the mission of FBIS. 
Much duplication could be avoided if headquarters informed 
the field ahead of time concerning the type of items they 
are interested in. As one field editor commented, "If they 
told us never to send certain things, then we wouldn't." 
This would of course eliminate a lot of duplication and unnec-
essary work and make for better quality control.

45 
C. Relations with Consumers  
A closer relationship of editors with the consumers is 
necessary so that both their needs are better served. As 
one observer said, "The editors must be up to date with the 
current thinking in a country," and to assure this frequent 
contact with the consumers is needed. There should be a 
greater two-way communication so that editors and consumers 
are better aware of each other's needs. In the field moni-
tors might be detached periodically to review the publica-
tions available to the embassy for information. The train-
ing program for new editors should include briefings on the 
lateral consumers regarding the kind of information that is 
most important to them. This would help editors in their 
selection and play of stories in the field. 
Just as foreign correspondents develop their sources among 
government and other officials, so must the editors in the 
field develop sources and contacts, so that they rely not 
only on radio, television, magazines and newspapers, but 
also primary sources. This would also help editors to evalu-
ate more effectively the material they receive from the moni-
tors and would ultimately guarantee better and more accurate 
reporting in the Daily Report.

CHAPTER VI PROSPECT FOR AUTOMATION 
The gross numbers tell the story -- millions of words 
annually -- FBIS is a natural for automation. Management 
saw this opportunity when it attempted the switch to RAPID 
(Radio and Press Information Dissemination) in 1975. That 
the move proved abortive in no way detracts from the legiti-
macy of the concept. In essence it was simplicity itself: 
incoming copy would be captured and placed in storage. The 
wire editor would get the incoming messages by priority --
with headlines on menu -- and call up material on a screen 
for review and further transmission to consumers. The field 
would have a code to switch the material to the appropriate 
desk, which would make selections, place them in the proper 
sequence, edit, cross reference and make up the pages. The 
results on tape would then be fed electronically to Langley. 
Automation would eliminate communicator and typing positions, 
thereby making editors directly responsible for the material 
in the Daily Report and freeing them of the onerous chore of 
proofreading. At the time it was felt that the $1.75 million 
investment for automation would be amortized over 6-7 years 
through personnel savings. 
There is no doubt in our minds that automation will prove a 
boon to the Daily Report. Of the 6-7 million words monitored 
and read daily in the field, 300,000+ are fed to FBIS in 
Washington. Of these, 30,000 or so are re-transmitted to 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
47 
50 prime consumers and 200,000 are synthesized by Daily  
Report editors for daily publication. Consider all of the 
typing and re-typing that is done on a single story: a 
monitor types the translation of a broadcast, it is handed 
to the editor in the field who reads and edits it, the 
field communicator types it for transmission to Washington, 
where it may be re-typed by a communicator for a direct feed 
to prime consumers and also tapped by an editor for inclu-
sion in a book, which means re-typing on a page proof for 
reproduction by Landley after it has been proofed at head-
quarters. 
Automation means that any given item is typed only once. 
With the story on tape it can be retrieved either on a 
screen or in hard copy. An editor in the field can make 
corrections, punch a button and be assured that the correc-
ted copy is speeding on its way to Washington. No further 
proofing is required. 
It is our recommendation that a feasibility study be con-
ducted to launch an automated system in the field, pre-
ferably at two training centers -- Panama and Okinawa. Not 
only are the technical facilities available, but trainees on 
TDY could also begin to familiarize themselves with the new tech-
nology. A prototype VDT we saw in Panama is an excellent 
beginning upon which to build. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
48 
In Washington FBIS should make the move to automation one 
book at a time, using a six-station ATEX VDT system (this 
would be compatible with equipment at Langley and our own 
assessment that ATEX is at or near the top of the field). 
While automation eliminates mechanical functions, such as 
typing and pagination, it does represent a psychological 
hurdle for persons used to working with hard copy and pencil. 
But there is a certain inevitability to its adoption univer-
sally -- at present 60% of the nation's newspapers have 
automated their newsrooms. The new technology is obviously 
the wave of the future. 
One of the priceless fringe benefits of automation would be 
the reality of a full-text index. If each article in the 
Daily Report were slugged with three key words, a computer 
could easily provide access to the stories in a variety of 
modes -- alphabetically, chronologically, topically, etc. 
Our investigation showed that one of the most advanced 
indexing systems in the country is at The Boston Globe, pre-
sided over by George M. Collins, librarian. He allowed that 
his system was not sophisticated -- he said that was nothing 
more than a code word for adulterated -- rather, it was 
simple. He noted that The New York Times had paid $ 3 1/2 mil-
lion for an information system that yielded only abstracts, 
while The Globe's $82,000 system delivered full text. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
49 
Collins said that The Globe hadn't clipped a paper in two 
years and yet could instantly retrieve any story it wanted, 
based on editors' computer notations of headline, date, page 
and column. He has indexed his system with words, not sym-
bols, simply because one should be able to find things in 
the way one thinks. Old newspaper librarians, he noted, 
ran morgues in a way as to make them indecipherable, thereby 
insuring their jobs for all eternity. He has a staff of 
three persons classifying all stories with three key words 
to make them retrievable in any logical mode of request. 
Collins is justifiably proud of his system and invites visits 
from interested parties. 
While we have not seen his system, it strikes us as remark-
ably close to the SAFE (Support for Analysts' File Environ-
ment) now at FBIS headquarters. Again, we can only point the 
way in this area, but do so by strongly urging that both 
automation in producing the Daily Report -- starting slowly 
on a limited scale -- and in compiling an index be put on 
management's agenda.

CHAPTER VII THE CONSUMER VIEW 
The Daily Report is widely praised for its indispensability, 
utility, accuracy and comprehensiveness by consumers here 
and abroad, and among officials at other government agencies, 
scholars, journalists and analysts. While consumer com-
plaints are quite rare, there are some reservations and rec-
ommendations for improvement. 
A. Analysts  
There is the general suspicion among analysts that the edi-
tors merely mark copy and know little of substance about the 
area on which they work. We have already discussed how this 
situation can be remedied through training, study and a 
closer editor/analyst working relationship. The AG general-
ly wants everything, particularly regarding communist poli-
tics and polemics. Here editing is at a minimum. However, 
other items in the book can be intelligently edited without 
changing their meaning and substance. AG's need for "every-
thing from the communist world" would be satisfied by get-
ting it discards rapidly. 
One analyst complained, "Things that are supposed to be in 
mandatory texting simply aren't in the Daily Report . . 
I was horrified." But according to AG, mandatory texting 
comprises no more than 15% of the Daily Report, even in the 
communist countries. Other analyst comments included: 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
51 
"The Daily Reports could be a bit brighter . . . the print 
is terrible." 
Recommendation: See Chapter 4 on the Daily Report for 
suggestions on improvements of the Report's appearance. 
"We want it to be an archive. And we want it to be right. 
And the words must be spelled right." 
Recommendation: More extensive formal training, fre-
quent querying, contact with consumers, editors in field, 
reference to GPO manual, style book, lists of officials. 
"The editing should be done in the field. God help us if it 
is done here." 
Recommendation: Most of editing to be done in field. 
But headquarters must be the final check and the site 
where non-mandatory text copy is prepared. 
"I don't trust the summaries of texts. I need the whole 
text." 
Recommendation: Aside from mandatory texting, full 
texts tend to be soporific and preclude publication of 
other material. We recommend intelligent editing and 
a speedy transmission of discards to AG. 
2. State Department  
The State Department analysts agreed that for free press 
countries, it was much more important to publish analytical 
pieces. In the case of the communist countries, the Daily  
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
52 
Report is indispensable as a result of limited sources in 
the country. "It's hard to see how we could do without it," 
said the China analyst. And he added, "When you're dealing 
with a controlled press, you look for the nuances. It's 
important for us to be as close to the exact words and 
phrases as possible." 
The State Department analysts were unanimous in thinking an 
index would be invaluable. They also agreed that in agencies 
such as the Departments of Commerce and the Treasury, the 
Daily Report was even more valuable since these organizations 
did not have access to classified material. 
They all favored a brighter format, with two columns, heads 
that stand out from the copy, sub-heads, political cartoons 
and charts. All felt that the editors could do more to 
alert the consumers to major stories, speeches and texts that 
were upcoming. They felt there was a need for the editors 
and consumers to consult more frequently and bemoaning the 
plight of the editors in the current system, one analyst 
said: "I wonder how the editors just don't lose their minds. 
They just pass paper along and there's absolutely no crea-
tivity in their work." 
In urging indexing of the articles, it was suggested that the 
use of three key words at the conclusion of each entry would 
provide for the best and most accurate retrieval. This would 
also help eliminate clipping for filing purposes. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3

53 
Matthew Nimetz, Counselor to the State Department, would 
not want to see translations tampered with since he sees the 
value in keeping the original flavor and tone. He stressed 
the importance of "completeness, immediacy and accuracy" and 
urged that the Daily Report not be held up for better edit-
ing. Nimetz felt that certain countries, such as those in 
Western Europe, Latin America, the Third World and the Free 
World, were not getting their fair share of FBIS 
"The communist countries are predictable and one 
said. 
"The Third 
World and democratic countries 
coverage. 
line," he 
have vary-
ing viewpoints in their media and these should be monitored 
and reported on. He illustrated with the Lopez Portillo 
speech in which the Mexican President castigated President 
Carter and the United States for not having better relations 
with his country. "This came as a complete shock to Ameri-
cans and shouldn't have. If we had done a better job of 
monitoring the Mexican press and radio and TV, we would have 
expected such a speech." He also cited the Nicaraguan situ-
ation as another instance where better monitoring and report-
ing could have alerted us to developments. The conclusion 
is that in the Free and Third World countries, the Daily  
Report should be alert to reporting dissenting voices. 
B. Voice of America  
R. Peter Straus, Director -- Straus is very high on the FBIS 
wire and the Daily Report, commenting that not a week goes 
by that three or four items from FBIS are not used as news 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
54 
items or as leads for pursuing stories. He said the Daily  
Report was mentioned regularly in the morning daily news 
meeting at the VOA. He felt the VOA would not be the place 
for FBIS were consideration given to transfering it from the 
Agency; but if such a move were to be contemplated, he 
thought that INR at State would be an ideal place for it. 
Straus believed that since FBIS was a primary source of news 
it should not be boiled down or edited out of shape. 
William Wade, senior news analyst, VOA -- Wade thought that 
FBIS gave a feel for what the opposition was saying and pro-
vided him with a sense of audience for his broadcasts. The 
Soviet and China books consequently were most important to 
him and he explained he discerned from them a sense of 
Soviet befuddlement on the SALT II treaty Senate debate and 
could then assemble a broadcast to explain how the process 
worked here. He said the books were most helpful in his 
broadcasts to primary audiences, those that were politically 
and economically deprived. He said about the Report, 
"They're so voluminous that I sometimes wonder if a daily 
summary would be helpful." He referred to the two-page 
summary the BBC would lead with, giving a flavor of what was 
to come. And like others with whom we spoke, he felt that 
perhaps a summary at the beginning of each country's section 
in the Daily Report might be helpful in speeding up the read-
ing and information gathering process.

55 
C. Journalists  
William Beecher, Chief Diplomatic Correspondent, Boston  
Globe -- He consults it at the State Department when he has 
time. He's much in favor of a short description of what 
each article contains. This summary would come at the begin-
ning of the country coverage in the Daily Report. Said 
Beecher, "A summary sounds like a small thing but it would 
be a big step editorially." 
Eric Pace, The New York Times -- He was one of the few jour-
nalists who belittled the Daily Report's value to journal-
ists, saying that he had his own sources at the highest 
levels of government when he was overseas (Iran, Egypt, 
Lebanon) and didn't need to get the "propaganda line." He 
felt,as did many other consumers, that the Report should be 
delivered much faster than is now the case and half face-
tiously suggested: "Tell the CIA to hire trucks and deliver 
the Reports under the door of correspondents every hour on 
the hour. Then it would really be valuable." 
Jay Mathews, China Correspondent, The Washington Post -- He 
has the Daily Report sent directly to Hong Kong and finds it 
"invaluable." He thought FBIS should have an index. He said 
a big problem was that the Daily Report arrived two to three 
weeks late and for late breaking stories he relied on the BBC 
"green sheet," which is only five days late. He asked why 
the Report couldn't be air mailed and would like to see the 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
56 
wire feed made available from the FBIS station. He said 
The Post and three or four other newspapers "would pay any-
thing" for a direct feed. 
Peter Osnos, foreign editor, The Washington Post -- He said 
the Daily Report was "a steady, consistent source of primary 
material" and he had never felt that it omitted something of 
importance or that it had been incomplete in its coverage. 
He felt it should be "simple to read and as easy to digest 
as possible." In terms of editing he said, "readability 
should not be the criterion if in the end you lose in accu-
racy." As an example he cited a TASS report that had 
Gromyko accuse the United States of a "cheap maneuver." 
Osnos, who was in Moscow at the time, said that the original 
was closer to "shady maneuver." These nuances in language, 
as others have pointed out, can be critical. Osnos recom-
mended that such changes in language be made only if the 
editor had the original copy and understood the language. 
D. U.S. Embassy in Panama  
Ambler Moss, U.S. Ambassador to Panama -- "I'm a great fan 
of FBIS. We use it regularly at the embassy. When I re-
ported to Washington about preparations for the Panama 
treaties I relied heavily on FBIS. A lot of our reporting 
came right out of FBIS. The Daily Report saves us a tremen-
dous amount of work." Moss said he saw all the Daily Reports  
and as we spoke he said, "I have anFBIS report in front of 
me right now." It was a report on the jurisdictional 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
57 
regulations dealing with the upcoming October 1 transfer of 
the Canal and it was quite complicated, according to Moss, 
who said, "Thank heavens FBIS translated them for us." He 
said that the Daily Report arrived a bit late for some pur-
poses and like other consumers he would like to see its 
delivery speeded up, if possible, but he said the lateral 
feeds (which are invaluable to the embassy's work) arrived 
on time. He said that the embassy would occasionally indi-
cate to FBIS things they should cover for the embassy and he 
said, "We haven't got the time or personnel to cover these 
ourselves. I don't know how we'd do some of these things 
without the Daily Report and FBIS." 
Ruth Hansen and Jim Murphy, political officers -- Like most 
other consumers, they felt that the Daily Report should be 
raw data and should not be tampered with. They were sur-
prised that more people didn't read the Daily Report and 
that in an effort to get the people at the State Department 
to use the book more a colleague was writing messages to 
State, "referring to such and such an item in FBIS." They 
also noted heavy readership by congressional staffs, with 
many Report items triggering queries from representatives 
and senators. 
Both felt that the layout and format of the books could be 
improved and Murphy called it "deadly." When we suggested 
that perhaps a monitor could assist at the embassy to provide 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
58 
additional monitoring of newspapers and magazines, they 
thought this might be quite helpful. "We'd be lost without 
FBIS," Hansen said at one point. This approximately sums up 
the feeling of many consumers. 
From the point of view of the consumers we would make the 
following recommendations: 
1) Much speedier delivery of the books. 
2) Take pains to guarantee precise and accurate transla-
tion. 
3) Guarantee further accuracy by queries, frequent checks 
between headquarters and the field, closer working rela-
tionships between editors and analysts in headquarters. 
4) Improve the appearance of the books by going to two 
columns, headlines, sub-heads, boxes, political cartoons 
and more imaginative makeup. 
5) Give representation to dissenting media in the books, 
particularly of the Western and Third Worlds. 
6) Index the articles for easy retrieval. 
7) Have a more clearly defined and accurate Table of 
Contents.

CHAPTER VIII SUMMATION: MAJOR FINDINGS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Daily Report is both unique and impressive. To its 
users it is archival, authoritative and fast. To our knowl-
edge there is no other publication like it anywhere that 
shares with readers on a daily basis what the world is saying 
and writing. 
It is the only publicly circulated daily publication by the 
CIA -- as such it is a standard bearer that at its best re-
flects the vital service that complete and immediate intelli-
gence gathering provides the nation. Although not authorized 
to peruse the National Intelligence Daily, we were able to 
see its cover from a distance. It struck us that the FBIS 
Daily Report was -- from a visual aspect -- but a pale 
shadow. Is this the way it should be? Somehow it seemed as 
though the Agency were wearing its best suit in the yard 
and lounging clothes in going out. Both in terms of its 
intrinsic worth, its broader circulation and the psychology 
of putting one's best foot forward in public, we would urge 
a dressing up of the Daily Report. 
But by far more importantly, we feel that a massive recommit-
ment should be made to the Daily Report as a substantive 
record. While it enjoys a high credit rating among consum-
ers, there is a feeling that was expressed to us that the 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
60 
Daily Report could be running more on fewer pages. One 
consumer remarked: "Send us more of everything, but we pre-
fer 10 pages of good stuff to 20 pages of fluff." 
This brought us to grips with the basic problems faced by 
the Daily Report: 
*management 
*rotation and constant turnover of 
editors 
*quality control 
In our view all are interrelated. Management must make a 
commitment to the Daily Report in terms of both fighting for 
an adequate budget and in occasionally strolling through the 
newsroom to let editors know that their work mattered and 
that their product was paramount to the mission of FBIS. In 
turn, management commitment to a comprehensive recruitment 
and training program would bring in and nurture editors who 
would contribute to the production of a quality book. Too 
often this last aspect is diluted by using editors and even 
branch chiefs in copy editing roles simply because no one has 
spelled out the difference between an editor who judges the 
substance of the material -- a full-time job -- and a copy 
editor who finishes the material for the printer -- also a 
full-time job. 
Consequently, the major complaints we heard from editors were 
that there was no challenge in the Daily Report, that the 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
61 
staff was too small and that there was too great a volume. 
We also heard from management that there was too little to 
do for the editors, that the real job was out in the field, 
and that at least copy editing kept them busy while back in 
Washington. Indeed, one person asked us: If editors didn't 
edit, count words and proof copy, what else would we do with 
them here? 
As apoint of beginning, we believe that editors are the back-
bone of the Daily Report and should be employed in a judg-
mental capacity. To the extent that the field provides the 
immediacy of contact with news sources, we not only assure 
that this is the ideal role for them, we would urge that 
primary editing responsibility for all copy be in the field. 
However, we do see the merit in rotation back to headquar-
ters, not only because it provides the book with expert edi-
tors who can bring their experience in the field to bear on 
the product, but also because the sustenance at the wellhead 
(to say nothing of assessment for promotion) could not be 
achieved by remaining constantly in the field. We believe 
that a more intelligently applied rotational system -- one 
that would also consider the wishes of the editors -- might 
evolve an eccentric system that would permit longer tours 
overseas and shorter ones in Washington, the reverse for those 
few who would prefer to stay longer at headquarters (probably 
less than 10%, based on our interviews).

62 
Daily Report manuscript editors (as differentiated from copy 
editors) should be recruited in a systematic way for the 
immediate future, given the massive attrition rate in 1978. 
As a first step a brochure should be prepared that spells 
out the mission of the Daily Report and FBIS; the role of 
the editor in both its positive and negative aspects. 
Despite the fact that overseas rotation has lost some of its 
appeal and fiscal reward, we would submit that there are 
still recent graduates out there who would leap at the oppor-
tunity -- to say nothing of their staying if the editorial 
role were indeed developed along the lines others in FBIS 
have suggested and which we are recommending. 
Persons selected should have a broad liberal arts education, 
knowledge of a foreign language, a keen interest in the 
world about them and a nose for news. Some journalistic 
experience either on campus or professionally would there-
fore be desirable. Recruitment should be an "outreach" 
operation for the foreseeable future. Campuses should be 
visited, preferably by recent journeymen editors who relate 
well on a peer basis. The role of the Daily Report should 
be stressed -- that it is overt, credible and important --
a service to other journalists, scholars, planners and 
policy makers. 
The editing test currently in use by the Daily Report is a 
good one if set to a tighter time limit. All new editors 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/19: CIA-RDP94-00798R000200140025-3 
63 
should have one experienced editor as a mentor, preferably 
for the first year. They should be trained in copy editing, 
news sources, reference checks and source books; they should 
be exposed to an intensive course in editing, as opposed to 
copy editing, by professional adjunct instructors drawn from 
Washington area daily newspapers. The stress in this pro-
gram should be on news values and judgment. Once editors 
have proved proficient -- and we urge some sort of testing 
mechanism -- then they should be trained by the wire service 
staff. The present policy of sending fledgling editors over-
seas on TDY to Panama or Okinawa is a good one and should be 
continued. 
Editors back from the field should not be returned to copy 
editing. This is not only a misuse of their talents, but 
rather stultifying for a professional who has so much more 
to offer. The Daily Report needs editors who can distill, 
make editorial notations, make intelligent queries to the 
field, critique material sent from the field, make cross 
references, consult with consumers and train new editors. 
FBIS ought not to use such talent in marking copy, figuring 
out capital letters, counting words and proofing. These 
chores should be taken over by a second tier of profession-
als -- albeit at a lower salary level -- who do not rotate 
overseas. By remaining for a longer period on one book 
pursuing a specific set of copy editing functions, these 
copy editors will impart a quality to the book that will

complement the qualitative improvement brought to it by 
editors who are devoting full time and attention to the 
substance of the material. 
Additionally, the managing editor should be freed of having 
to worry about how many typists show up and concentrate on 
the overall style and appearance of the book (just as the 
Daily Report chief is concerned with the overall substan-
tive quality of the book). We recommend that all typing be 
placed under contract to free the staff from the burden of 
having to cope with vagaries of no-shows to dictate the scope 
of the book. Further, once automation is in place, such a 
contract will be easier to shed than a permanent staff with-
in the organization. 
On the matter of substance, a primary goal should be to use 
as much of the material sent in by the field as possible, 
if not in its entire length, then with editorial notations 
and cross referencing. Some thought should be given to 
establishing a separate editors' desk, where this substan-
tive editing could be accomplished. This might involve 
staggering the times of editors coming in, so that a group 
could be at work in the afternoon preparing copy for the 
following day's books. At present the copy flow is all 
jammed into one period of the day, which necessarily leads 
to bottlenecks. It is essential that AG be involved in the 
daily editorial meetings so that mandatory texting can be

sorted out. Management should actively encourage judgment 
and substantial editing of the remaining copy. Editors 
should be adept at writing good, accurate heads; compact sum-
maries of stories that deserve such treatment and in placing 
material within the books that will better serve the needs 
of consumers. A very close relationship should prevail be-
tween editors and analysts in the same areas. Editors should 
be able to alert analysts to upcoming news, just as the lat-
ter can alert editors to areas they would like to see 
covered. 
The editing environment on the llth floor of FBIS desper-
ately needs perking up. The newsroom should hum with the 
same excitement as the wire room, with editors at work on 
the substantive end of the book, copy editors on the prepar-
ation of copy for the typists and the managing editor a vis-
ible presence to put the whole product together. Also, 
editors at headquarters should be concerned with critiquing 
reports sent from the field, while management should re-
institute the "winners and sinners" flyer that once served 
as a psychological boost to editors of the Daily Report. 
Automation is something that is inevitable for the Daily  
Report. We believe the first steps should be taken in the 
field, with a gradual introduction at headquarters, one book 
at a time. Automation offers the prospect of more material 
being processed quickly, without the inordinate delays of 
constant re-typing and proofing. This time around care

should be taken not to dismantle a proven operation until 
all of the components of the new system are in place and 
functioning smoothly. 
In the course of our investigation it was clear to us that 
much of what we have recommended in this report has been 
considered at one time or another. On the basis of our 
interviews, observations and personal experience we have 
prepared a critique that we hope is both constructive and 
workable. There are constraints -- budget, personnel, 
tradition -- that may work against its usefulness. But the 
very fact that we were invited to undertake this assignment 
makes us hopeful that the Daily Report will continue to be 
at the cutting edge of reporting in a world of change, with 
a renewed perception of the issues and news that must be 
covered and the wisdom to recruit and utilize the talent to 
do the job.

The use of cartoons could add both a visual and substantive 
dimension to the DailT Report, as the attached article in 
The Wall Street Journal illustrates. 
Tighter editing of non?m,ndatory text material would make 
passible the inclusion of more copy in the books and greater 
readability of the material. We include one East German 
broadcast, which had been edited at Headquarters and which 
we refined further. Non?political, non?polemical material 
should lend itself to such editing. The article on micro?
chips in the latest issue of Atlas World Press Review is 
34 column inches distilled from 124 column inches in Die Zeit. 
Again, the essence of this essentially technical report was 
recorded in infinitely less space. Note the three?column 
type (very readable) and the judicious use of a cartoon. 
The sample two?column page could be enhanced with boldface 
heads and sub?heads. The three key words for indexing are 
circled in red. 
One possible use of a logo on the front page of the Daily Report

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 23, 1979 
Chinese Cartoons: 
Less Politics, 
More Fairy Tales 
By BARRY KRAMER 
SHANGHAI?Try to imagine this: U.S. 
government officials are so angered by the 
animated-cartoon antics of Mickey Mouse 
that they punish the Walt Disney studio 
artists by sending them all to the country-
side for three years to raise pigs. 
That gives some idea what happened at 
? Shanghai Animated Film Studio, China's 
sole cartoon movie production facility, 
when China was run by radicals now 
known and reviled collectively as the Gang 
of Four. 
Today, the studio is back in business, 
turning out cartoons that make fun of the 
Gang of Four or that retell ancient Chinese 
folktales, which were forbidden as "poi-
sonous weeds" during the radical years. 
But it will be many years before the studio 
regains the skills of the early 1960s when it 
made some of the world's most beautiful 
animated features. 
Ho Yuwen, the studio president, talks 
calmly of the three years she spent on a 
farm commune near Shanghai growing 
rice and vegetables and tending hogs. "I 
wasn't very good at farming when I went 
there, so I actually learned something," 
says the soft-spoken Mrs. Ho. 
Today, a tour of the studio finds artists 
busy on a full-length cartoon feature based 
on a Ming dynasty fairy tale called 
"Monkey God Wreaks Havoc in the Under-
sea Crystal Palace." It will be China's first 
wide-screen animated cartoon when fin-
ished in October. 
* * * 
At their drawing desks, artists grimace 
in front of mirrors to catch the proper fa-
cial expressions for the characters they 
draw. Other staff members paint colors on 
individual clear plastic "cells," each to be 
photographed in sequence to produce ani-
mation. 
It wasn't always so. The studio began in 
1947 as a propaganda mill in Communist-
controlled Manchuria turning out simple 
cartoons against Chiang Kai-shek's Nation-
alist government. After the Communist ' 
victory, the studio moved to Shanghai in 
1950. At first, it produced black and white 
children's cartoons using traditional fables 
to instill basic themes such as bravery and 
hard work, but with few political over-
tones, Mrs. Ho says. 
But in the late 1960s, with the advent of 
the Great Cultural Revolution, traditional 
fables were outlawed. "Everything we 
made had to stress the class struggle and 
so-called reality," says Mrs. Ho. As a re-
sult, the cartoons were very dull and peo-
1.4 
The cartoon studio; of course, wasn't 
alone. During the Cultural Revolution, all 
of China's traditional arts suffered from 
the radical rigidity enforced by Jiang Qing 
(Chiang Ching), the wife of Mao Tse-tung. 
For seven years, from 1965 to 1972, not 
a single foot of film emerged from the 
Shanghai Animated Film Studio. Aside 
from the three years on the farm, four 
more years were spent in "political discus-
sions." Recalls Mrs. Ho, "The only thing 
we did every day was hold meetings and 
(self) criticisms." 
Now the studio staff is getting revenge. 
Last year, they turned out a highly amus-
ing color cartoon full of symbolism famil-
iar to every Chinese, which attacks the 
Gang of Four with the same viciousness 
the Gang once reserved for the cartoon stu-
dio and other artists. 
The film, called "One Night in an Art 
Gallery," portrays the know-nothing activi-
ties of a hat (the Gang is accused of put-
ting "hats," or labels, on everyone) and a 
club (representing dictatorship in the cul-
tural field). The hat and club are shown 
slinging mud and ink over art works in a 
children's art gallery, only to have the pic-
tures restored by the children and animals 
in the paintings, which come to life at 
night. 
* * * 
At film's end, with the defeat of the club 
and the hat, flowers bloom until they fill 
the screen. Any Chinese knows the symbol-
ism of that: China's current leaders have 
urged their countrymen to let "a hundred 
flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of 
thought contend." But they'll need more 
than animated cartoons to convince 
China's masses, for most know about the 
previous "hundred flowers" campaign of 
the late 1950s when Chinese who expressed 
their opinions were later punished. 
Mrs. Ho blames the Gang of Four pe-
riod for lasting damage at her studio. 
"Neither the quantity nor the quality of our 
films has regained previous high levels," 
she admits. 
Many Chinese who have seen the latest 
cartoons agree with Mrs. Ho's assessment. 
"The pictures from the early 1960s were 
much better," confides an official from the 
Foreign Ministry. 
As if to point that out, Mrs. Ho guides 
some foreign visitors into a darkened thea-
ter where a 1963 production of the Shang-
hai Animated Film Studio flickers onto the 
screen. 
The cartoon, a- simple children's story 
about tadpoles who try to find their frog 
mother, isn't a literary classic. But the art-
work makes it a film classic, for it brings 
to life one of China's most brilliant art 
forms, ink-brush painting. 
The studio artists in those less-political 
,days, copied faithfully the delicate ink-
brush painting techniques of Qi Baishi (Chi 
Pal-Shill, a famous contemporary artist 
whose works use a minimum number of 
brush strokes to portray animals and 
plants in traditional Chinese style. Tradi-
tional Chinese music ? not the martial 
strains so associated with the China of the 
past decade?provides appropriate accom-
paniment to what must be a memorable 
animated cartoon for anyone. 
It also provides a goal for the studio's 
artists as they emerge from years of 
limbo, along with the rest of China's artists 
and performers. 
Mr. Kramer is a Wall Street Journal re-
porter based in Hong Kong.

The utilization of secondary raw materials is of concern not 
only to a country deficient in raw materials, but to all nations. 
Thus Sweden and Finland increasingly are using scrap wood despite 
rich forest resources. In Great Britain and West Germany more 
than 40% of the paper and cardboard is made from scrap paper. 
These are but two minor examples. The more a nation is indus-
trializted the greater its need for raw materials. We face the 
question with worn out or even obsolete machines or consumer goods: 
Discard or recycle? It is easily answered: Why smelt expensive ore fo: 
steel when 1,000 tons of less costly scrap will yield the same 
result as pt000 tons of Imported ore and 500 tons of imported 
coke. Annually our economy accumulates 70 million-tons of nearly 
400 types of such raw material. Thus the directive of the ninth 
SED Congress to increase the use of secondary raw materials by 
30% by 1980 makes a lot of economic common sense. It seems to 
me that using an important resource that is already available 
in large quantities is vital to increasing production of high-
quality machines and modern consumer goods. Its importance cannot 
be underrated in view of the steep price increases in raw materials,

such material. New processing plants must be built and collection

Richard Gaul is Economics Editor and 
Thomas von Randow is a reporter for the liberal 
weekly "Die Zeit" of Hamburg, from which 
this is adapted. 
proponents of microelectronic won-
ders see them as the engines of 
economic growth in the coming de-
cades. Others see them as the precursors of 
unemployment for millions of workers. 
The debate in the 1980s over these seem-
ingly irreconcilable views may be as ve-
hement as that over nuclear power. 
Miniature electronic circuits do more 
at ever lower costs. There seems to be no 
end to their use wherever something is 
guided, measured, or regulated. They can 
transmit information instantly, accurate-
ly, and cheaply, and their product re-
liability is astounding ? the electronic 
watch is one example. Or consider the old 
calculating machine: bulky, plugged into 
a wall outlet, noisy, and capable of basic 
arithmetic only. Microelectronics made 
possible pocket calculators capable of 
incredibly complex operations. 
Computer companies love to set up dis-
plays in their lobbies in which the first 
item is a component the size of a part of a 
computer of the early 1950s. Next to it is a 
postcard-size plate, which represents the 
state of computers twenty years ago. Next 
is a block of plastic no bigger than a sugar 
cube, which does as much as the original 
computer did. Finally we come to the 
present, a silicon chip visible only under a 
magnifying glass. 
? This tiny component is the most ver-
satile unit ever produced by science, ca-
pable of doing what a machine a mere 
generation ago could do only if it filled a 
fair-sized room. It is inexpensive because 
its main ingredient is silicon. It uses only a 
few watts of electrical power. Simply 
stated, it performs assignments in logic, 
answering basic questions with either yes 
or no. That, in principle, is all there is to 
the new technology. 
The latest advance is the microproces-
sor. The size of a Chiclet, it can perform 
the most complex operations in logic. It is 
24 Atlas World Press Review/September 1979 
the nerve center for storage units, pro-
cessing on command data it has received 
into the form desired by the user. The 
commands can be stored so that they can 
automatically run a sewing machine. 
The microprocessor is at the center of 
the minicomputer, which is the size of a 
typewriter and costs about $1,000. It can 
perform infinitely more than the legend-
ary Univac computer, which occupied the 
entire floor of a building. Almost daily, 
new uses are being developed, and en-
gineers continue to speed up its operation. 
As the capacity and miniaturization of 
computers have improved since World 
War II, their use has soared. Until the 
early 1970s, the rationale was that there 
were no workers to fill the jobs which 
microcomputers ostensibly eliminated. 
Today, with some 900,000 unemployed in 
Germany, this argument no longer is 
valid. Now computers are seen as a means 
of improving the nation's. competitive 
position in world trade, of speed ing up the 
flow of information, and of rescuing prod-
ucts threatened with extinction by out-
moded methods of manufacture. 
Manufacturers claim that the new tech-
nology will not lead to the loss of jobs, but 
rather to new jobs based on new uses. 
Microelectronics already provides essen-
tial components in television sets, tape 
recorders, record players, and household 
appliances. ,Waiting in the wings are 
many innoviiions, such as an electronic 
hOme in which all appliances can be 
controlled from:a console, with a small 
computer for proKi-amming their use. 
In the automobile of the future, micro-
electronic equipment will regulate fuel, 
emissions, and lights. A warning system 
will alert drivers when they are too close to 
another vehicle. Hans L. Merkl, head of 
Robert Bosch Co., Germany's largest 
manufacturer of electrical components for 
cars, says, "In the second half of the 1980s, 
every car with an internal combustion 
engine will be equipped with an electron-
ic steering mechanism." 
Electronic units will insure a more 
uniform flow of traffic, regulating traffic 
lights and advising drivers of congested 
areas ahead, with a quick advisory on 
alternate routes. The same technology 
can help make public transportation, such 
as buses, more responsive to passenger 
needs, thus making them more com-
petitive with automobiles. 
Bank customers already encounter 
computerized "tellers" that can identify a 
customer by his voice and complete sim-

pie transactions. In stores, an electronic 
device can "read" the price of a product 
so that the cashier no longer has to record 
the sale manually. Soon the customer 
won't even go to the store, but will shop 
from his home by way of an electronic 
terminal. His television will display mer-
chandise and he will order by phone. 
Computers have also invaded offices, 
not as secret machines in some remote 
room, but as video display terminals. 
Nixdorf, a German computer firm, offers 
a unit that can "understand" 250 spoken 
commands. Experts predict that within 
ten years computers will be able to absorb 
whole sentences spoken in a normal tone 
of voice and give spoken responses. Al-
ready they are able to translate simple 
foreign texts. 
These computers will be able to absorb 
letters, speed them on their way elec-
tronically, and deliver them orally at their 
destination. They can serve as simul-
taneous translators in conversation. The 
future is likely to be without paper, with 
information stored on tapes and trans-
mitted from one picture screen to another. 
File cabinets will disappear, data will be 
retrieved with the push of a button. 
True, the new technology has made 
some jobs obsolete. The German watch 
industry employed 32,000 in 1970; by 
1977 that number had dwindled to 
18,000. Cogs and springs have been re-
placed by silicon chips not much larger 
than a pinhead and imprinted with the 
works of a watch. Without this new tech-
nology, it might be argued, the German 
watch industry would have disappeared 
entirely, with the loss of all its jobs. 
Advocates of the new technology claim 
that to ignore it is to insure economic 
stagnation. 
The biggest fears over job obsolescence 
do not focus on assembly lines, but on 
"Disappearance 
of several million 
office jobs. .." 
11111111111?1111111111MIMIIIIIMMIN=M11.10111 
clerical and administrative personnel. 
Computers are viewed as their nemesis. 
Union leaders talk of the disappearance of 
"several million" office jobs?a figure 
that management disputes. But the realis-
tic prospect is that someday fully auto-
mated systems will turn out products 
without human intervention. 
IBM in Europe is moving rapidly in 
that direction. New orders are run 
through a central computer in Great 
26 Atlas World Press Review/September 1979 
Frankfurter Rundschau/Franklurt 
Britain, which calculates how many parts 
are needed from various facilities. These 
data are fed into a computer in Mainz, 
Germany, which registers the current 
inventory of parts and, if necessary, orders 
new ones through another computer at 
the parts factory in Boblingen. This com-
puter schedules and then activates a fully 
automatic assembly line to make the 
required parts. Manpower is involved 
only in a control function, to see that the 
automated equipment maintains its per-
fect record of keeping the flow of parts to 
the right place when they are needed. 
Another employment worry?and one 
of the most dramatic aspects of micro-
electronics ? is in the greatly reduced 
number of parts in a given piece of 
equipment. A mechanical cash register 
contains 28,000 parts; an electronic unit 
has 6,000. National Cash Register in 
Augsburg reduced its workforce from 
8,300 in 1970 to 3,700 in 1977. Producers 
of electronic parts often discover that they 
can easily assemble the final product, be it 
an appliance or a gadget, themselves. 
The real danger for the 1 980s is not that 
there will be too many workers, but that 
too few will have the necessary qualifica-
tions. What is needed is a program of 
continuing education for all workers. 
Werner Andexser, a prominent indus-
trialist, says, "We can no longer cram all 
learning into one period. 
Remarkably, as microelectronics prod-
ucts grow smaller their cost falls. In 1960 a 
trahsistor cost 54 cents; today it costs .0005 
cents. By the same standard a Volkswagen 
beetle which cost A2,717 at that time 
would cost only $2.72 today. The market 
in the Western world seems limitless, with 
the small size of the components practical-
ly eliminating transportation costs. 
The U.S. dominates the field, manu-
facturing half the chips made each year; 
Western Europe and Japan make up the 
balance. The Soviet bloc lags far behind, 
though it is gaining. 
German industry attributes U.S. 
leadership to the enormous American in-
vestment in military and space hardware. 
To remain competitive, companies such 
as Bosch, Siemens, and Nixdorf have 
signed cooperative agreements with U.S. 
companies?and, says one executive, 
"Today we Germans are fully competi-
tive." So is Japan, which apparently 
surpasses Europe in computers and leisure 
appliances. The future lies with indus-
tries that are willing to commit their 
products to the electonics revolution. NI

[Text] Beijing, July 5 (AFP)--Former 
Kampuchan head of state Prince 
Norodom Sihanouk wants to take part 
in the Geneva conference of refugees 
and speak on behalf of the "genuine 
Khmer people and country." Prince 
Sihanouk made the statement today in

OUTHEAST ASIA & PACIFIC 
On June 20 Prince Sihanouk called 
on the nonalined countries to save 
Kampuchea from extinction by taking 
some of the Kampuchean refugees now 
in Thailand. He "begged" Thailand 
on June 25 not to expel his compa-
triots back to their own country 
where they would face certain death 
and promised Thailand he was doing 
everything possible to get the ne-
cessary international aid to keep 
the refugees temporarily in Thai-
"The immense majority of Kampuchean 
men and women living outside the 
country have just designated me as 
their sole representative to speak 
and act in the world in the name of 
the genuine Khmer people and coun-
try." "To begin with, these com-
patriots are going to ask the forth-
coming international conference on 
Indochinese refugees to allow me to 
speak in Geneva, the telegram said. 
Urges Thai Acceptance of Refugeesl: 
The prince's reference to the "gen-
uine Khmer people and coutry" is an 
allusion to his rejection of both 
the ousted Khmer Rouge regime of Pol 
Pot and its supporters now waging a 
guerrilla war, and the pro-Vietnamese 
Heng Samrin regime now in power in 
Phnom Penh. Referring to the trail 
the Heng Samrin regime has said it 
would hold judge the former Kampu-
chean monarch, Prince Sihanouk said 
sarcastically: "I am delighted to 
learn that the Heng Samrin regime, 
lackey of Hanoi, has decided to judge 
me." 
Prince Sihanouk, and his wife, 
Princess Monique, are in North Korea 
as guests of North Korean President 
Kim II-song.

[Text] Beijing, July 5 (XINHUA)--
Many Kampuchean people in enemy 
occupied areas and members of the 
security force armed by Vietnam have 
gone to the liberated areas since 
early June because they could not 
endure the Tyrannical rule of Viet-
namese aggressor troops, announced 
Radio Democratic Kampuchea. 
Over 1,000 people and members of the 
security forces in Santuk County, 
Kompong Thom Province, rose in revolt 
on June 15, turning their guns 
against the Vietnamese aggressors. 
They killed or wounded over 50 Viet-
namese invaders, raided an enemy 
warehouse and, taking their weapons 
with them, joined the guerrillas in 
fighting against the Vietnamese 
aggressors. On June 20, 13 members 
of the security force in Prek Prasap 
County, Kratie Province, killed ten 
Vitnamese invaders and then went to 
the liberated areas to the warm wel-
come of the revolutionary army. 
Members of three "village committees" 
in Thmar Puok, Battanbang, set up 
forcibly by the Vietnamese aggres-
sors, led 150 residents to the lib-
erated areas on June 5.
