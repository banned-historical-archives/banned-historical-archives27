 The cwcr s the at Monitor and Protect
 The nation's intelligence system is un-
 questionably large but it is anything
 but monolithic. It is a loose aggrega-
 tion of agencies, each with a specific
 role and place, wary of any encroach-
 ments on its prerogatives. The prin-
 cipal members:
 CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.. Di-
 rector-designate: William Colby. Esti-
 mated number of employees: 15,000.
 Estimated budget: $750 million. Es-
 tablished by the National Security Act
 of 1947 to replace the World War II
 Office of Strategic Services. Officially
 supervised by four congressional com-
 ruittees, but largely autonomous and
 excused by a 1949 law from any ac-
 counting of the funds it gets or spends.
 In charge of espionage and clandestine
 operations abroad as well as overt in-
 telligence-gathering activities; forbid-
 den by law to exercise any police, sub-
 poena or law-enforcement powers, or
 internal security functions in the U.S.,
 but has occasionally interpreted these
 laws freely. Grown somewhat fat over
 the years, was ordered this year to cut
 its staff by 10%, but cuts are still not
 completed.
 The director of the CIA also serves
 ex officio as chairman of the U.S. In-
 telligence Board, which reports to Pres-
 ident's National Security Council (see
 diagram). The hoard coordinates and
 supervises major American intelligence
 activities, and exercise's supervisory
 control  over  every  other  security
 system.
 DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. Ditec-
 lor: Vice Admiral Vincent P. dePoix.
 Number of employees: 5,000. Budget:
 $129,300,000. Set up by Robert S. Mc-
 Namara in August 1961, after the CIA
 intelligence for Bay of Pigs invasion
 proved disastrously inadequate, and be-
 cause the three military services' op-
 erations suffered from a lack of over-
 all evaluation. The agency operates
 under the direction of the Secretary of
 Defense. Charged with assessing the
 worldwide military situation, the De-
 fense lutelligencc Agency coordinates
 the conflicting and not infrequently self-
 serving intelligence operations of the
 three armed services-Army's G-2, Of-
 fice of Naval Intelligence and Air
 Force's A-2. DIA men tend to view CIA
 men as the spoiled darlings of the in-
 telligence community. The CtA, which
 once dealt directly with military in-
 telligence services, resents DIA's role
 as middleman. and tends to look upon
 pprovec to-rii      e'' 0 3 f01
 172
 its members as minor-league spies.
 NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY. Direc-
 tor: Lieut. General Samuel Phillips,
 U.S.A.F. Employees: 25,000. Budget:
 classified. Created in 1952 as a sep-
 arate agency within the Defense De-
 partment. Makes and breaks codes, de-
 velops techniques for electronic sur-
 veillance of foreign troop and ship
 movements and construction of military
 facilities (NSA equipment was used on
 the U-2 spy plane shot down over Rus-
 sia in 1960).
 BUREAU OF INTELLIGENCE AND RE-
 SEARCH. Director: Ray S. Cline. Em-
 ployees: 33"5. Budget: about $8,000,000.
 Intelligence arm of the State Depart-
 ment since 1947. Charged with gath-
 ering and analyzing information essen-
 tial to U.S. foreign policy. Staffed by
 economists and academicians. Prepares
 studies on subjects as diverse and es-
 oteric as Albanian public health sys-
 tem and the clove industry in Zan-
 zibar. Generally considered a "clean,"
 as opposed to "dirty" or covert oper-
 ation.
 ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION. Direc-
 tor: Dr. Dixy Lee Ray. Total employ-
 ees: 7,000. Overall budget: $2,500,000,-
 000. Established in 1946 to govern
 development of atomic energy. Also
 maintains a constant watch on the
 atomic capabilities of other countries,
 detecting and identifying nuclear tests.
 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. Direc-
 tor: George P. Shultz. Total employees:
 117.462; 100-200 directly involved in
 intelligence. Oversees Bureau of Cus-
 toms and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
 and Firearms. Thus responsible for nar-
 cotics investigations. Department also
 includes Secret Service, which protects
 President and other top officials, main-
 tains liaison with Interpol, the inter-
 national criminal police organization.
 FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.
 Director: William Ruckelshaus. Em-
 ployees:  19,857 (including 8,700
 agents). Budget: $336,300,000. Number
 of field offices: 59. Established in 1908
 as investigative arm of the Justice De-
 partment, the closest U.S. equivalent
 to a national police force. r-BI has ju-
 risdiction over wide range of crimes
 from assassination of a President to
 hank robbery, kidnaping and transpor-
 tation of stolen cars. Since 1936, has
 had jurisdiction over espionage and sab-
 otage within the U.S. J. Edgar Hoo-
 ver, director from 1924 until his death
 last year, expanded FBI authority to in-
 vestigate Communists, Ku Klux Klans-
 men, radical students and other ele-
 ments he considered a threat to national
 security. The bureau's latest assign-

 THE CIA AND DECISION-MAKING
 By Chester L. Cooper
 "The most fundamental method of work . . . is to determine our working policies ac-
 cording to the actual conditions. When we study the causes of the mistakes we have made,
 we find that they all arose because we departed from the actual situation ... and were
 subjective in determining our working policies    The Thoughts of Mao Tse-tung."
 N bucolic McLean, Virginia, screened by trees and sur-
 rounded by a high fence, squats a vast expanse of concrete
 and glass known familiarly as the "Pickle Factory," and
 more formally as "Headquarters, Central Intelligence Agency."
 Chiselled into the marble which is the only relieving feature of
 the building's sterile main entrance are the words, "The Truth
 Shall Make You Free." The quotation from St. John was
 personally chosen for the new building by Allen W. Dulles over
 the objection of several subordinates who felt that the Agency,
 then still reeling from the Bay of Pigs debacle, should adopt a
 somewhat less lofty motto. (In those dark days of late 1961, some
 suggested that a more appropriate choice would be "Look Before
 You Leap.") But Dulles had a deeper sense of history than
 most. Although he was a casualty of the Bay of Pigs and never
 sat in the Director's office with its view over the Potomac, he
 left a permanent mark not only on the Agency which he had
 fashioned but on its building which he had planned.
 Allen Dulles was famous among many and notorious among
 some for his consummate skill as an intelligence operative
 ("spook" in current parlance), but one of his greatest contribu-
 tions in nurturing the frail arrangements he helped to create to
 provide intelligence support to Washington's top-level foreign-
 policy-makers.
 Harry Truman, whose Administration gave birth to both the
 National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency,
 recalls that, "Each time the National Security Council is about
 to consider a certain policy-let us say a policy having to do
 with Southeast Asia-it immediately calls upon the CIA to
 present an estimate of the effects such a policy is likely to
 have....' President Truman painted a somewhat more cozy
 relationship between the NSC and the CIA than probably
 existed during, and certainly since, his Administration. None
 the less, it is fair to say that the intelligence community, and espe-

 cially the CIA, played an important advisory role in high-level
 policy deliberations during the i95os and early 196os.
 To provide the most informed intelligence judgments on the
 affects a contemplated policy might have on American na-
 tional security interests, a group especially tailored for the task
 was organized in i95o within the CIA. While this step would
 probably have been taken sooner or later, the communist victory
 in China, the Korean War and growing East-West tensions stimu-
 lated the Truman administration's interest in obtaining care-
 fully prepared intelligence assessments and projections. The
 Office of National Estimates (ONE) was headed initially by
 Professor William Langer, eminent diplomatic historian, lead-
 ing authority on the American duck and master of prose-style.
 Under his brief stewardship he established guidelines for crisp,
 objective assessments that have been maintained for two decades.
 Since its inception, the Office of National Estimates has main-
 tained its independence within the hierarchy of the CIA, within
 the intelligence community, and within the national security and
 foreign policy elements of the government. Each National Intel-
 ligence Estimate is written after due consideration of contribu-
 tions submitted by intelligence analysts both within and outside
 the Agency, but the final wording bears the unmistakable stamp
 of ONE's style of composition and analysis.
 Estimates, about 5o a year, are written on a variety of subjects
 relevant to situation or policy considerations affecting the na-
 tional security interests of the United States-from such elab-
 orate, highly technical examinations as Chinese communist nu-
 clear capabilities as they may develop over the next several
 years, to more speculative judgments about, say, the probable
 course of Japanese-Soviet relations in the light of evolving
 American foreign and economic policy.
 The estimates are, by their very nature, a projection into the
 future: "What will be the effects of ...?" "What are the prob-
 able developments in ...?" "What are the intentions of ...?"
 "What are the future military capabilities of ...?" When Pravda
 has been scanned, the road-watchers' reports from Laos checked,
 the economic research completed, Pham van Dong's recent
 speeches dissected, radar signals examined, satellite observations
 analyzed, and embassy cables read, the estimatgrs set about
 their task. What emerges reflects a mass of distilled information,
 a painstaking search for the mot just and an assiduous effort to

 THE CIA AND DECISION-MAKING
 coordinate the views of all appropriate elements of the intelli-
 gence community. And,when all is said and done, what emerges
 is an opinion, a judgment. But it is likely to be the best-informed
 and most objective view the decision-maker can get.
 The ten men on the National Estimates Board and the twenty
 or so on the National Estimates Staff (the Board and Staff make
 up the Office of National Estimates) have virtually unlimited
 access to classified and unclassified information concerning the
 political, military and economic situations of foreign countries.
 Their access to high-level White House, Defense or State policy
 thinking is much more limited; the fear of leaks which has per-
 vaded the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations has
 tended to seal off even such elite intelligence groups as the Office
 of National Estimates from advance knowledge of sensitive
 "options" under serious consideration by the President. On occa-
 sion, now less frequent than in previous years, the Estimates
 folk are given an inkling of closely held courses of action that
 may be under high-level review through requests from the
 White House or the NSC to undertake a "Special" National
 Intelligence Estimate on "The Consequences of Certain Possible
 Steps the United States May Take Toward (let us say) Cash-
 mania."
 The position of the men and women in the Office of National
 Estimates, particularly those on the Board, is unique in the gov-
 ernment (their closest counterparts were members of the Policy
 Planning Staff of the Department of State prior to the recent
 reorganization of that staff). They are among the most senior
 civil servants in the government, but unlike their peers else-
 where in the CIA or in other agencies and departments, they have
 no managerial or administrative responsibilities, they are not
 obliged to concern themselves with the painful and mundane
 matter of the annual budgets, they are not asked to appear be-
 fore congressional committees. Their assigned responsibility
 is to brood about the world's problems and to project their views
 about how these problems are likely to affect American national
 security interests. No one has ever tried to cost out the production
 of a National Intelligence Estimate. Even if the dollar costs
 could be determined, who is to weigh the nondollar value of a
 considered, objective judgment, based on all relevant available
 information, on a matter important, perhaps vital to American
 security? At a time when government officials of whatever

 stature find themselves so harried that thinking time is at a pre-
 mium, a group of experts that has an opportunity to ponder is a
 scarce and precious national asset.
 The salad days of CIA's Office of National Estimates were
 during the Eisenhower administration. It was in this period
 that the estimators sensed that they had a direct, or at least dis-
 cernible, participation in the policy process. The National Se-
 curity Council then played a more important role in the formu-
 lation of national security policy than it did under its creator,
 President Truman, or has under any subsequent administration,
 including the present one. Anxious to make the NSC a more
 orderly and effective body, President Eisenhower established a
 Planning Board charged with "staffing out" policy reviews and
 recommendations prior to consideration by the Council itself.
 The Planning Board was chaired by the President's Assistant
 for National Security Affairs and its membership included
 representatives from the departments and agencies which com-
 prised the NSC. The State Department member, for example,
 was the chairman of the Policy Planning Staff. The CIA ad-
 viser (both the CIA and the Joint Chiefs are nominally, at least,
 "advisers" rather than "members" of the NSC) was the Deputy
 Director for Intelligence to whom the Office of National Esti-
 mates was then responsible'
 The typical Planning Board arrangement involved assigning
 to the State Department's Policy Planning Staff the task of writ-
 ing a "position paper" on the issue at hand and to the intelligence
 community, through the Office of National Estimates, the chore
 of preparing a National Intelligence Estimate. In due course,
 a Planning Board draft would be prepared incorporating the
 essence of these two documents and appropriate contributions
 from the Bureau of the Budget, the Department of Defense or
 other member groups.
 While this was a far cry from having a firm assurance that the
 President and his advisers personally read the National Intelli-
 gence Estimates, it provided a built-in arrangement for gearing
 intelligence guidance into the policy-making process. Moreover,
 Allen Dulles, then Director, included a summary of relevant
 Estimates in his weekly briefings to the Council. This did not
 mean that every Estimate was heeded or even taken very seri-

 ously by the policy-makers. But the estimators had some con-
 fidence, then, that their views were at least considered prior to
 a National Security Council position and a presidential decision.
 President Kennedy was more interested in dealing with se-
 lected individuals than with formal institutions. He abolished
 the Planning Board together with other subordinate groups
 that had mushroomed under Eisenhower's NSC and, like Presi-
 dent Johnson later, used the Council primarily as a vehicle for
 communicating decisions already reached in smaller, more con-
 genial forums. There were still high-level, sometimes urgent,
 requests for Estimates directly addressing pending policy deci-
 sions,s but ONE's umbilical cord to the policy-making process
 was severed with the disappearance of the Planning Board. The
 fact that John Kennedy was a "reading" President was, of
 course, some compensation. (He is reported to have once called
 a startled young member of the Estimates Staff about a point in
 an estimate on Indonesia.)
 Aside from momentary diversions into the Caribbean and the
 Middle East, the Johnson administration's foreign policy con-
 cerns were dominated by Vietnam. It is revealing that President
 Johnson's memoirs,' which are replete with references to and
 long quotations from documents which influenced his thinking
 and decisions on Vietnam, contain not a single reference to a Na-
 tional Intelligence Estimate or, indeed, to any other intelligence
 analysis. Except for Secretary McNamara, who became a fre-
 quent requester and an avid reader of Estimates dealing with
 Soviet military capabilities and with the Vietnam situation, and
 McGeorge Bundy, the Office of National Estimates had a thin
 audience during the Johnson administration. This is not to say,
 of course, that "current intelligence" on crisis situations was
 ignored. It is to say that Estimates, think pieces and in-depth
 analyses were far from best sellers.
 Early in its tenure the Nixon administration publicly em-
 phasized its determination to restore the National Security
 Council to its place at the pinnacle of the policy-making pyramid
 and to establish a more orderly process of policy planning and
 review. But the system that evolved relegated the National Esti-
 mates to but a tiny fraction of the studies, analyses, position

 generated by the large new NSC staff murmuring the magic
 words, "The White House wants immediately.. . ." How much
 of this deluge of paper has ever been read and assimilated by
 even those NSC staffers who originally requested the material
 is a well-kept secret and understandably so. How much ever went
 beyond their overflowing desks to Mr. Kissinger's busy deputy,
 to the harassed Mr. Kissinger or to the even more harassed Presi-
 dent can only be imagined. A safe bet would be precious little.
 Most Americans concerned about foreign affairs have long
 had to accept on blind faith that our government takes pains
 to provide its highest officials with the best possible intelligence
 guidance-and then to squirm under our private suspicions that
 this advice is, all too often, regarded with indifference. Thanks
 to Daniel Ellsberg, those of us who have not seen a National
 Intelligence Estimate for many years, or who have never seen
 one, can address the matter with somewhat more confidence than
 we could have a few months ago. Although it probably did not
 cross Ellsberg's mind when he released the "Pentagon Papers"
 to The New York Times, he succeeded in doing what the
 Agency, on its own, has rarely been able to do for more than 20
 years: he made the CIA "look good" through what inhabitants
 of the Pickle Factory themselves would call a "highly credible
 source."
 By some stroke of prescience, President Truman singled out
 Southeast Asia as his example of a problem area where the
 National Security Council would call for intelligence guidance
 for policies under consideration. Since Truman wrote his mem-
 oirs, this troubled part of the world has given rise to a fair share
 of NSC deliberation, intelligence analysis and policy decisions.
 While the "Pentagon Papers" tell us little about what actually
 happened in the White House Cabinet Room, they do reveal
 much about the intelligence guidance made available to the
 policy-makers. The record, recently amplified by President John-
 son's memoirs, gives us some insight into the extent to which such
 guidance was reflected in policy decisions. A review of the rec-
 ord is disquieting.

 THE CIA AND DECISION-MAKING
 a shield against further communist expansion in Asia. Secretary
 Dulles, especially, was determined to develop a strong anti-
 communist government south of the 17th parallel in Vietnam
 and to replace the French economic, military and political influ-
 ence in that area with our own. The man the United States
 counted on to establish strong anti-communist rule was Ngo
 Dinh Diem. By mid-summer, the issue of American support for
 Diem's fledgling and untried government was high on the NSC's
 agenda. The CIA was requested to prepare an Estimate on the
 viability of a Western-supported, anti-communist government in
 Vietnam. According to the "Pentagon Papers," the National
 Intelligence Estimate of August 3 warned that "even with Amer-
 ican support it was unlikely that the French or Vietnamese
 would be able to establish a strong government and that the
 situation would probably continue to deteriorate." The NSC,
 nevertheless, recommended American aid for the frail and
 untried Vietnamese government, a recommendation that was
 soon followed by President Eisenhower's fateful letter to Diem
 offering American support.
 This estimate has long since been validated and it seems clear
 that the United States would now be better off if President
 Eisenhower had paid more heed to that warning and less to the
 strong pressures that were being exerted by his Secretary of
 State and hard-line members of Congress. But this would prob-
 ably be asking too much, considering the atmosphere in Wash-
 ington during the summer of 1954. In any case, the Diem
 regime proved reasonably effective and stable until 1959, four
 years after .the estimate-a period about as long as any intelli-
 gence judgment can be projected with confidence and any par-
 ticular policy can be expected to be viable. It is probably a moot
 point, therefore, whether the estimators or tLe policy-makers
 were right in terms of what they knew and what they said and
 did in 1954. What is worth noting for our purposes here is the
 readiness of the estimators to send forward a point of view very
 much at variance with the current policy "line." This attribute,
 comes through time and again over the succeeding years.'

 nedy and Johnson administrations on the course of events in
 Vietnam. In August 1960, according to the "Pentagon Papers,"
 the National Security Council was told that unless Diem's gov-
 ernment took "more effective measures to protect the peasants
 and to win their positive cooperation" the Vietcong would
 expand their areas of control. If adverse trends were not
 checked, the estimate noted, "they will almost certainly in time
 cause the collapse of Diem's regime." Six months later officials
 in the new Kennedy administration were given an even sharper
 warning: "An extremely critical period . . . lies immediately
 ahead." Diem's "toleration of corruption" and his reliance on
 "one-man-rule" cast doubt on his ability to lead the government.
 And in October 1961, when Kennedy's NSC was considering
 deploying SEATO (South-East Asia Treaty Organization)
 ground forces to Vietnam, it was cautioned that, "The commu-
 nists would expect worthwhile political and psychological re-
 wards from successful harassment and guerrilla operations
 against SEATO forces. The DRV (North Vietnamese Govern-
 ment) would probably not relax its Vietcong campaign against
 the GVN (South Vietnamese Government) to any significant
 extent." In November 1961, shortly after General Taylor and
 Walt Rostow returned from their trip to Vietnam recommend-
 ing, inter alia, that the United States "offer to introduce into
 South Vietnam a military Task Force," a National Intelligence
 Estimate warned that any escalation of American military activi-
 ties in Vietnam would be matched by a similar escalation by
 Hanoi: "the North Vietnamese would respond to an increased
 U.S. commitment with an offsetting increase in infiltrated sup-
 port for the Vietcong." Kennedy turned down the recommended
 "Task Force," but approved a substantial increase in American
 military advisers.
 In June 1964, CIA analysts challenged the validity of the
 hallowed "domino theory." According to the "Pentagon Pa-
 pers," President Johnson asked the Agency: "Would the rest of
 Southeast Asia necessarily fall if Laos and South Vietnam came
 under North Vietnamese control?" "With the possible excep-
 tion of Cambodia," the President was told, "it is likely that no
 nation in the area would quickly succumb to Communism as a
 result of the fall of Laos and South Vietnam. Furthermore, a
 continuation of the spread of Communism in the area would not
 be irreparable. . . ." So long as the United States retained its

 offshore bases in Asia, China and North Vietnam could be de-
 terred "from overt military aggression against Southeast Asia
 in general." But, as President Johnson himself confides, the
 "domino theory" continued to dominate his thinking about
 Vietnam: "... from all evidence available to me it seemed likely
 that all of Southeast Asia would pass under Communist control,
 slowly or quickly, but inevitably, at least down to Singapore but
 almost certainly to Djakarta . . ." if the United States "let South
 Vietnam fall to Hanoi."'
 Intelligence officers apparently have been consistently bearish
 about the effectiveness of American bombing of North Vietnam.
 During late 1964, when a group of contingency planners were
 examining the costs and advantages of bombing North Vietnam,
 intelligence analysts took issue with those who maintained that
 bombing would force Hanoi to cease supporting the insurgency
 in South Vietnam: "We do not believe that such actions [i.e.
 bombing the North] would have a crucial effect on the daily
 lives of the overwhelming majority of the North Vietnam popu-
 lation. We do not believe that attacks on industrial targets would
 so exacerbate current economic difficulties as to create unman-
 ageable control problems.... [The Hanoi regime] would prob-
 ably be willing to suffer some damage to the country in the course
 of a test of wills with the United States over the course of events
 in South Vietnam." As the Pentagon historians note, this view
 had little influence on the contingency paper which emerged.
 In November 1965, after eight months of American bombing
 without any discernible effect on Hanoi's ability to continue the
 war, there was a quest for more "lucrative" targets. The Joint
 Chiefs proposed bombing North Vietnamese petroleum storage
 facilities, and Secretary McNamara asked for the views of the
 Board of National Estimates. "Hanoi would not be greatly sur-
 prised by the attacks," the Board responded. "Indeed . . . it
 has already taken steps to reduce their impact.... We believe
 that the DRV is prepared to accept for some time at least the
 strains and difficulties which loss of the major POL facilities
 would mean for its military and economic activity." After the
 petroleum storage facilities had been bombed in June 1966, it be-
 came clear that Hanoi had pre-positioned adequate oil caches
 throughout the country.
 A month later, McNamara asked the Board to estimate the
 181

 Approved For Release 2003/10/16 : CIA-RDP80R01731 R002100030026-2
 effect on Hanoi of a substantial escalation of American ground
 and air activity. There must be many officials of the Johnson
 administration who now wish they had taken more cognizance
 of this in late 1965: "Present Communist policy is to continue to
 prosecute the war vigorously in the South. The Communists
 recognize that the U.S. reinforcements of 1965 signify a deter-
 mination to avoid defeat. They expect more U.S. troops and
 probably anticipate that targets in the Hanoi-Haiphong area
 will come under air attack. Nevertheless, they remain unwilling
 to damp down the conflict or move toward negotiation. They ex-
 pect a long war, but they continue to believe that time is their
 ally and that their own staying power is superior." "An escala-
 tion of the bombing would not be decisive: the DRV would not
 decide to quit; PAVN [North Vietnamese Army] infiltration
 southward would continue. Damage from the strikes would make
 it considerably more difficult to support the war in the South,
 but these difficulties would neither be immediate nor insur-
 mountable."
 Throughout 1966 intelligence analysts were to continue to
 maintain that the American bombing of North Vietnam would
 not produce "either a military victory or early negotiations."
 During a sober moment of rethinking about the bombing in the
 spring of 1967, McNamara requested three intelligence assess-
 ments on this issue. According to the "Pentagon Papers," one
 CIA study concluded that 27 months of bombing "have had re-
 markably little effect on Hanoi's overall strategy in prosecuting
 the war, on its confident view of long-term communist prospects,
 and on its political tactics regarding negotiations." Another de-
 scribed North Vietnamese morale as one of "resolute stoicism
 with a considerable reservoir of endurance still untapped." And
 a third noted that although the bombing had "significantly
 eroded the capacities of North Vietnam's industrial and military
 bases," the damage had "not meaningfully degraded North Viet-
 nam's material ability to continue the war in South Vietnam."
 The snippets of intelligence guidance which the "Pentagon
 Papers" reveal may not, of course, be the whole story of intelli-
 gence judgments offered and intelligence judgments heeded.
 The complete text of the documents which were cited may have
 couched the conclusions in a more tentative form; Intelligence

 THE CIA AND DECISION-MAKING
 Estimates and memoranda tend to be generously sprinkled with
 "on the one hand and on the other hand" and "on balance we
 believe." The Pentagon historians refer to other documents
 which countered or at least dissipated the effect of those pre-
 pared in the intelligence community as a whole or within the CIA
 itself. For example, the "Pentagon Papers" frequently refer to
 assessments of American bombing submitted by the joint Chiefs
 which were typically more bullish than those generated within
 CIA or produced by the Office of National Estimates with con-
 tributions from and the concurrence of the Defense Intelligence
 Agency. The extent to which Defense Intelligence analysts had
 a hand in the joint Chiefs' assessments is unknown, but one must
 assume that they played some role. Secretary McNamara may
 have become concerned about this apparent schizophrenic ten-
 dency within the Defense Intelligence staff because he tended,
 increasingly, to rely on the Board of National Estimates or other
 components within CIA for their own, uncoordinated, views on
 current or projected U.S. courses of action regarding Vietnam.
 Who besides McNamara was influenced by the CIA judgments,
 and who by the JCS, the "Pentagon Papers" do not say.
 But they do indicate that the CIA's estimators and analysts, if
 not those within the Pentagon, appear to have passed the test of
 time, the sternest test of all. Confronting one of the most passion-
 laden, persistent and dangerous foreign crises the United States
 has confronted since World War II, they consistently seem to
 have kept their cool, they remained impeccably objective, and
 they have been right. But if the record was so good, why wasn't
 anyone Up There listening?
 Sherman Kent, a seer among the professional intelligence
 analysts and a long-time Chairman of the Board of National
 Estimates, has said, "The nature of our calling requires that we
 pretend as hard as we are able that the wish is indeed the fact
 and that the policy-maker will invariably defer to our find-
 ings. . . ." He feels that his associates' concern about their influ-
 ence is misplaced; "no matter what we tell the policy-maker, and
 no matter how right we are and how convincing, he will upon
 occasion disregard the thrust of our findings for reasons beyond
 our ken. If influence cannot be our goal, what should it be?
 ... It should be to be relevant within the area of your compe-
 tence, and above all it should be to be credible."'

 This exemplary admonition must be satisfying to Mr. Kent's
 co-professionals, but it is less than nourishing to those of us who
 are not as lofty-minded nor so high above the battle. Intelligence
 judgments on Vietnam, we now know, were both "relevant" and
 "credible" but were ignored or cast aside. Why? Because, since
 at least the early 196os, they ran counter to the mood prevail-
 ing in the upper reaches of the policy-making community.
 With the notable exception of Secretary McNamara (whose
 eventual change of view on the wisdom of our Vietnam policy
 may in no small part have been influenced by the seriousness
 with which he regarded CIA's assessments), senior officials seem
 to have dismissed the intelligence judgments as "just another
 opinion." It would be surprising if President Johnson had actu-
 ally read the intelligence documents referred to in the "Penta-
 gon Papers." Indeed, as he points out in his memoirs, the "Wise
 Men" he had assembled to examine American policy alternatives
 following the communists' 1968 Tet offensive were receiving
 "gloomier" assessments of the situation in Vietnam than he had
 been aware of. On important and sensitive political questions,
 intelligence judgments were virtually excluded from considera-
 tion. The State Department's Intelligence Bureau, for example,
 was cut off from the distribution of telegrams dealing with
 negotiations initiatives in 1966 and 1967, and thus was precluded
 from playing any useful role in this area. Intelligence analysts
 were thus banished to the darkness of official indifference. We
 know much less about the disposition of the Nixon administra-
 tion, but it is no secret that the word has been passed down that
 Nixon officials are interested in "facts, not opinions."
 IV
 What can we realistically strive for in closing the yawning
 gap between the ultimate analytical product of an elaborate and
 costly intelligence structure and the tight if not always orderly
 process of arriving at national security and foreign policy de-
 cisions? Obviously, it is unrealistic to expect that policy-makers
 should be bound by the advice of intelligence analysts or even
 that intelligence judgments or guidance should be influential in
 every major decision; we already have acknowledged that other
 considerations may override intelligence assessments concerning
 the probable risks or advantages in a particular course of action.
 But the operative verb should be "override," not "disregard."

 THE CIA AND DECISION-MAKING
 We do have a right to expect that the findings of Intelligence
 Estimates be put forward in policy councils, pondered upon and
 then accepted or, by conscious decision, set aside.
 The policy-making process comes into final focus and de-
 cisions are ultimately reached through oral rather than written
 communication. It is at this critical juncture that officials should
 perceive, as clearly as possible, "the effects a policy is likely to
 have." And it is at this point that the men whose metier it is to
 render such judgments should be directly involved. But long-
 standing practice has insulated the estimators from face-to-face
 confrontation with those who grapple with policy issues and
 options. Clearly if they are to play a more direct and useful
 role, the estimators must be brought out of their cloister into the
 real world. They must, in short, engage the policy-makers.
 If not the Board of National Estimates, a Board should be
 given a broader charter which would assign it responsibilities
 well beyond that of presiding over National Intelligence Esti-
 mates. In effect, Board members should function within their
 special areas of experience and expertise as senior intelligence
 advisers to the policy community. The issues they should under-
 take or be called upon to examine and the nature of their partici-
 pation obviously call for discrimination. The value of their
 contribution will stem from their unique opportunity to form
 considered judgments and to maintain cool objectivity; indis-
 criminate participation in every policy discussion is likely to
 erode both of these precious attributes to the point where they
 are just one more group in Washington living by its wits in an
 atmosphere of advocacy and passion.
 The recent reorganization of the intelligence community pro-
 vides an opportunity to increase the prestige and the influence of
 an Estimates Board. The Director of Central Intelligence has
 been relieved of his day-to-day responsibilities for running the
 Central Intelligence Agency and has been given greater authority
 over all the government's intelligence services. The Director in
 his new role will need a strong, knowledgeable policy support
 staff experienced in extracting, digesting and using the informa-
 tion and analysis available throughout the intelligence com-
 munity. One way of meeting this need would be to provide the
 Director with a senior personal staff which would work closely
 on issues under consideration in high policy councils and repre-
 sent him in consequential, subordinate forums,

 Approved For Release 2003/10/16 : CIA-RDP80R01731 R002100030026-2
 Another, more draconic alternative for giving a greater em-
 phasis to intelligence judgments would be to remove the esti-
 mating responsibility from the Central Intelligence Agency and
 place it within the National Security Council structure. In
 essence, this would expand the role of the new Net Assessments
 Staff created by the recent reorganization. Broad political and
 economic judgments as well as more quantitative assessments of
 the strategic balance could then be channeled directly into policy
 forums. Such a move would also give the estimators a more sen-
 sitive feel for policies under consideration. Close association
 with the policy element of the National Security Council would
 permit an Estimates Board to initiate intelligence analyses and
 estimates that would squarely confront national security issues
 in their early stages of review. Under these cirmumstances, esti-
 mates would be more relevant as well as more influential.
 But what about objectivity, the quality that has distinguished
 the estimates over the years? The risk of sacrificing this in the
 quest for influence cannot be dismissed lightly. Obviously the ob-
 jectivity-influence trade-off must be closely examined before
 giving the National Security Council ultimate responsibility in
 making intelligence judgments. On the assumption that the ob-
 jectivity issue can be resolved, direct access to an Estimates Board
 by the President's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs
 and, on occasion, the President himself, would make available
 what every President since Truman has said he wanted, but
 what none of them has been able to obtain on a routine basis-
 the best possible first-hand intelligence judgments on critical
 international problems.
 A move of this kind would obviously involve consequential
 changes in organization and' philosophy within Washington's
 intelligence and policy, hierarchies. It would also add to the in-
 fluence on foreign policy exerted by the White House-an influ-
 ence already a matter of congressional criticism and State De-
 partment concern. But, the price would appear tolerable if a
 more thoughtful and prudent approach to the world was the
 result.

 (Nate:  Mr. Prouty is a retired Air Force colonel.)
 Fletcher Prouty, a briefing officer from 1955 through 1963,
 was one of the focal points for contacts between the CIA and the
 DoD on military support of CIA's "special operations."  In this
 unique position, he became extremely well informed about the covert
 activities carried out by CIA agents throughout the worli1.   The men
 who receive the secret intelligence reports and make the decisions
 to undertake "special operations,"  are the members of the "Secret
 Team."  Some of them are in Government, some in uni5,orm, soi,,e in
 industry or in education, rotating in and out of official jobs but
 never losing their power to make or influence such decisions.
 Together, says Prouty, they have damaged the coherent conduct of
 foreign and military affairs, often to the detriment of American
 interests.
 This book seeks to undermine their pervasive influence by
 exposing their activities.   It is filled with startling assertions
 and a wealth of detail, obviously based on considerable research and
 a background of authentic experience.   Moreover, it exposes a number
 of incidents in recent experience which were engineered by the
 ""secret team,"  though outwardly there was no indication of such
 involvement.   The celebrated "Pentagon Papers,"  for example, which
 played a major role in influencing national policies on Indochina,
 were not genuine Pentagon papers at all, but rather papers prepared
 mainly by people outside the Pentagon.
 Prouty discusses at some length the organization and evolution
 of the CIA,  from its original establishment in the post-World War II
 period to the present.   Its intelligence coordinating functions,
 including the evaluation and dissemination of this information to
 proper authorities, have long since been expanded to include both
 the active collection of intelligence and the conduct of secret
 operations.   The nature of these clandestine activities is also
 discussed at length, with the Cuban Bay of Pigs affair cited as a
 prime example of the manner in which the secret team can commit the
 US to a course of action without sufficient debate or study of the
 possible consequences.   Over the years,  these activities have
 expanded to the point where President Truman, who set up the CIA,
 assigned it specific missions, and made it organizationally subor-
 dinate to the Secretaries of State and Defense, as well as the White-_

 House, conceded some time after he left office that it had gone far
 beyond its original purpose.
 President Kennedy, too, became convinced that the CIA was
 exceeding its authority in many ways, but by that time the Agency
 had become so adept in exercising its power and influence that all
 attempts to control it were futile.   The instructions and directives
 he issued, designed to place stricter controls over the CIA's
 activities, were simply taken over by the Agency to suit its own
 ends or ignored when they conflicted with its own objectives.   In
 fact, all the Presidents since Truman have had to learn to live with
 the "nightmare"  of CIA, and with the realizaticin that they are
 almost powerless to control it.   This "secret team,"  says Prouty
 must be "exposed, bared, and silenced;"  above all, it "should be
 limited to the function of intelligence--and not a bit more."

 THE I TELLIGENCE COMMUNITY: time for revie ?
 The following report is reprinted from the De-
 ember, 1972 F.A.S. Newsletter, publication of the
 Federation of American Scientists. The Federation,
 founded in 1946, is a national organization of nat-
 ural and social scientists and engineers concerned
 with problems of science and society. It counts more
 than 25 Nobel Prize winners among its. members.
 1hiE  INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY, and its budget,
 pose many problems of traditional concern to
 the Federation of American Scientists: governmental
 reform, morality, proper use of high technology and
 defense expenditures. In the last quarter-century
 inteigence agencies have proliferated. The United
 States has established an agency that goes beyond
 intelligence collection and, periodically, interferes
 in the internal affairs of other nations. Technology
 molted to the invasion of national and personal pri-
 vacy has been developed apace. And the $4-6 billion
 being spent for intelligence might well be termed
 the largest "unreviewed" part of the defense budget.
 'Twenty-five years after the passage of the Na-
 .ional Security Act of 1947 (NSA) seems a good
 time to consider the problems posed by these devel-
 opments.
 Of least concern in terms of its budget but of
 overriding significance in its international political
 impact is the Directorate of Plans of the Central
 Intelligence Agency, within which clandestine polit-
 ical operations are mounted. This [latter aspect] is
 the issue discussed in this newsletter. More and
 :shore, informed observers question whether clandes-
 sirte political operations ought to be continued on a
 "business as usual" basis. In the absence of an inves-
 tigation, a secret bureaucracy-which started in the
 Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during a hot war
 and which grew in the CIA during a cold war-may
 simply continue to practice a questionable trade.
 Clandestine "dirty tricks" have their costs not
 only abroad but at home, where they are encour-
 aged only too easily. And is not interference in the
 eventually destroy free institutions." We would see,
 he predicted: pressure for defense expenditures, ex-
 pansion and centralization of government, with-
 holding of information, general suspicion, an under-
 mining of press and public opinion, a weakening
 of political parties, a decline of the Congress and of
 the courts.
 Today, with the Cold War waning, it seems in
 order to re-examine our institutions, goals and
 standards. Which responses to the emergency of
 yesterday can we justify today?
 The National Security Act of 1947 created the
 CIA and gave it overall responsibility for coordinat-
 ing the intelligence activities of the several relevant
 government departments and agencies interested in
 such matters. Today, the CIA is reported to have a
 budget of about $700 million to $i billion and a
 staff of perhaps 18,ooo people, or about 8,ooo more
 than the Department of Statel (This advantage in
 size gives CIA an edge in interdepartmental -meet-
 ings for which others may be too rushed to fully
 prepare, or not be able to assign a suitable person.)
 The National Security Act authorized the CIA to:
 perform for the benefit of the existing intelli-
 gence agencies such additional services of com-
 mon concern as the National Security Council
 (NSC) determines can be more effectively accom-
 plished centrally;
 perform such other functions and duties related
 to intelligence affecting the national security as
 the NSC may from time to time direct (italics
 added).
 These clauses clearly authorize clandestine i'itel-
 ligence collection, but they are also used to justify
 clandestine political operations.  However, over-
 throwing governments, secret wars, assassination
 and fixing elections are certainly not done "for the
 benefit of the existing intelligence agencies," nor
 are they duties "related to intelligence." Someday
 a court may rule that political activities are not au-

 Clandestine Operations
 The "white" part of CIA is, in a sense, a cover
 for the "black" side. CIA supporters and officials
 invariably emphasize the intelligence, rather than
 the manipulation, function of CIA, ignoring the
 latter or using phrases that gloss over it quietly.
 The public can easily accept the desirability of
 knowing as much as possible. But its instincts op-
 pose doing abroad what it would not tolerate at
 home. And it rightly fears that injustices committed
 abroad may begin to be tolerated at home: how
 many elections can be fixed abroad before we begin
 to try it here? The last election showed such a de-
 generation of traditional American standards.
 The present Director of Central Intelligence,
 Richard Helms [since publication, Mr. Helms has
 been replaced by James Schlesinger], is working
 hard and effectively at presenting an image of CIA
 that will not offend. In a recent speech, he said:
 "The same objectivity which makes us useful to our
 Government and our country leaves us uncomforta-
 bly aware of our ambiguous place in it.... We
 propose to adapt intelligence to American society,
 not vice versa." Even construed narrowly, this is
 no easy job, and adapting clandestine political op-
 erations to American ideals may well be quite im-
 possible.
 At the time of the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy
 gave serious consideration to breaking the CIA into
 two pieces: one piece would conduct operations and
 the other would just collect intelligence. The dan-
 gers were only too evident to Kennedy of letting
 operations be conducted by those who were ac-
 cumulating the information. Allen Dulles insisted
 on a united operation, arguing that separation
 would be inefficient and disruptive. But there are
 many arguments on both sides, and the issue de-
 serves continuing consideration.
 In particular, there is something to be said for
 ticle I, Section 9, Clause 1) that:
 No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but
 in consequence of appropriations made by law;
 and a regular Statement and Account of the Re-
 ceipts and Expenditures of all public Money
 shall be published from time to time (italics
 added).
 Not only CIA expenditures but the distorted bud-
 get reports of other agencies would seem to violate
 this provision. The petitioners call for a functional
 breakdown showing general categories of uses of
 CIA funds and a breakdown by nation showing
 where funds have been spent.
 Certainly, there is little justification for hiding
 the total figure of CIA expenditures from the public
 and the Congress. This figure reveals less to any
 potential enemy than the size of the Defense De-
 partment budget-which we freely reveal. Releasing
 at least this overall figure would make unnecessary
 the hiding of the CIA budget in other agency bud-
 gets. This would stop an authorization and appro-
 priation procedure that systematically and peren-
 nially misleads Congress and the public.
 CIA's four divisions concern themselves with sup-
 port, science and technology, intelligence, and plans.
 Press reports suggest that the personnel in these di-
 visions number, respectively, 6,ooo, 4,000, 2,000 and
 6,ooo.
 The Intelligence Division examines open and se-
 cret data and prepares economic, social and polit-
 ical reports on situations. It is in the Plans Division
 that clandestine operations are undertaken. Former
 Deputy Directors for Plans have been: Allen Dulles,
 Frank Wisner, Richard Bissel and, after 1962, Rich-
 ard Helms-now the Director of CIA itself.
 The most dramatic clandestine operations obvi-
 ously have the approval of the President. But, as
 any bureaucrat knows, it can be hard for the Pres-
 ident to say "no" to employees with dramatic ideas
 that are deeply felt. The U-2 and Bay of Pigs oper-
 ations-both under the guidance of Richard Bissel

 underdeveloped world. This would have the a
 tage of protecting America's reptitation-and that
 of its citizens doing business there-from the con-
 stant miasma of suspicion of CIA involvement in
 the internal affairs of other countries. Open, sources
 would continue to supply the US with 8o 'percent
 of its intelligence. Further intelligence in the under-
 developed world could be collected by State Depart-
 ment officials through embassies. This polic would
 enforce the now-questioned supremacy of the State
 Department in dealing with the nations involved.
 Arguments against this policy include these: the
 area is too important to US interests to permit such
 withdrawal, and the credibility of the withdrawal
 would be hard to establish, at least in the short run.
 (2) Permit covert activities in the underdeveloped
 world only for information, not manipulation. This
 policy would prevent the fixing of elections, the
 purchase of legislators, private wars, the overthrow
 of governments, and it would go a long way, toward
 protecting the US reputation for noninterference
 in the affairs of other countries. One might, for ex-
 ample, adopt the rule suggested by Harry Howe
 Ransom that secret political operations be used
 only as an alternative to overt military action in a
 situation that presented a direct threat to US se-
 curity.
 Of course, the mere existence of a covert capabil-
 ity for espionage would leave the US with a capabil-
 ity for manipulation; the same agents who are se-
 cretly providing information could secretly try to
 influence events. But there is still a large gap be-
 tween buying "assets" for one purpose and for the
 other.
 Also, large scale operations would not be con-
 ducted under this rule. According to some reports,
 the committee, chaired by Maxwell Taylor, that
 reviewed the Bay of Pigs episode recommended to
 President Kennedy (who apparently agreed) that
 the CIA be limited to operations requiring military
 equipment no larger or more complex than side
 arms....
 (g) Require that [appropriate] representatives of
 Congress be consulted before any clandestine oper-
 ations, beyond those required for intelligence col-
 In tacit agreement with this, CIA Director Helms
 recently said:
 America's intelligence assets (sic), do not exist
 solely because of the Soviet and Chinese threat,
 or against the contingency of a new global con-
 flict. The United States, as a world power, either
 is involved or may with little warning find itself
 involved in a wide range and variety of problems
 which require a broad and detailed base of for-
 eign intelligence for the policy makers.
 Thus, . . . the present justification for intelligence
 activities in the underdeveloped world springs ever
 more only from America's role as a "great power."
 Moreover, the word "assets" above is significant.
 If information were all.that were at issue, a strong
 case could be made for getting needed information,
 when you need it, through open sources, embassies
 and reconnaissance. But if clandestine political ma-
 nipulation is at issue, then one requires longstand-
 ing penetration of institutions of all kinds and a
 great deal of otherwise unimportant information
 necessary to plan and hide local maneuvers.
 Because political operations are so sensitive, and
 potentially so explosive, it is imperative that the
 agents be under strict control. But is this really pos-
 sible? To each foreign movement of one kind or
 another-no matter how distasteful-the CIA will
 assign various operatives, if only to get information.
 In the process, these operatives must ingratiate
 themselves with the movement. And since they are
 operating in a context in which subtle signals are
 the rule, it is inevitable that they will often signal
 the movement that the US likes it, or might support
 it. Indeed, the agents themselves may think they are
 correctly interpreting US policy-or what they
 think it should be-in delicate maneuvers that they
 control. What, for example, did it mean when CIA"
 agents told Cambodian plotters that they would do
 "everything possible" to help if a coup were mount-
 ed. (See Philadelphia Inquirer, April 6, 1972, "CIA
 Role Bared in Sihanouk Ouster.")
 What Are the Alternatives?
 No one who has ever tried to control a bureaucracy
 will be insensitive to the problems to which these
 situations give rise. These problems would be dra-
 matically diminished, however, if the CIA were re-
 stricted to information gathering and were known
 to be. The movements would then cease to look to
 the CIA for policy signals.
 What alternative positions might be considered
 toward CIA involvement abroad? There are these
 alternative possibilities:
 lection, are undertaken. It is an unresolved dispute
 between the executive and legislative branches
 whether and when the executive branch may under-
 take operations affecting US foreign policy without
 consulting Congress. If a clandestine political oper-
 ation is important enough to take the always high
 risks of exposure, it should be important enough to
 consult Congress. These consultations can produce
 a new perspective on the problem-which can be
 all important. The chairman of the Senate Foreign
 Relations Committee was one of the few who pre-
 dicted accurately the political consequences of the
 Bay of Pigs operation.

 sentatives of CIA. But this authority is variously
 interpreted and might be periodically clarified and
 strengthened. One method of policing the order
 would involve occasional visits by Congressmen or
 Congressional staff, who would quiz the Ambassa-
 dor to be sure that he knew at least as much as they
 did about local covert activities. Another control
 would require that Assistant Secretaries of State
 know about the covert activities in their region. In
 all cases, political oversight and political perspective
 would be injected into operations that would other-
 y dise be largely controlled by an intelligence point
 of view.
 One morally and politically important imperative
 seems clear: Adopt and announce a firm rule against
 murder or torture. There are repeated and persis-
 tent reports that this rule does not exist. There was
 the murder by a Green Beret. There is the Phoenix
 Program involving widespread assassination of "Viet-
 cong agents"--many of whom, it is reported, were
 simply the victims of internal Vietnamese rivalries.
 Some years ago, The New York Times quoted one
 of the best informed men in Washington as having
 asserted that "when we catch one of them" [an
 enemy agent], it becomes necessary "to get every-
 thing oat of them, and we do it with no holds
 barred.
 There is also this disturbing quotation from Vic-
 tor Marchetti-
 The director would come back from the White
 I-louse and shake his head and say "The Presi-

 that the only solution was.    . But of course,
 that's impossible; we can't be responsible for a
 tilin,ig like that."
 The second man would say the same thing to
 the third man, and on down through the station

 Infiltration and Manipulation
 After the 1966 revelations that the CIA had been
 financing the National Student Association, a vari-
 tsv of front organizations and conduits [about 250]
 were unravelled. The CIA gave its money directly
 to foundations that, in turn, passed the secret funds
 along to specific CIA-approved groups, organiza-
 tions and study projects. These, in turn, often sup-
 ported individuals. The organizations included the
 National Education Association, African-American
 Institute, American Newspaper Guild, International
 Development Foundation and many others.
 The way in which these organizations were con-
 trolled was subtle and sophisticated in a fashion ap-
 parently characteristic of many clandestine CIA op-
 erations. Thus, while distinguished participants in
 the Congress for Cultural Freedom and editors of
 its magazine, Encounter, evidently believed that
 the organizations were doing only what came nat-
 urally, the CIA official who set the entire covert
 We had placed one agent in a Europe-based
 organization of intellectuals called the Congress
 for Cultural Freedom. Another agent became an
 editor of Encounter. The agents could not only
 propose anti-Communist programs,  but they
 could also suggest ways and means to solve the
 inevitable budgetary problems. Why not see if
 the needed money could be obtained from
 "American foundations"? (Saturday Evening Post,
 May so, 1967.)
 President Johnson appointed a panel headed by
 Undersecretary of State Nicholas deB. Katzelpbach
 to review this aspect of CIA operations. The other
 panel members were HEW Secretary John Gardner
 (a former OSS employee) and CIA Director Helms.
 The panel was to study the relationship between
 the. CIA and those "educational and private volun-
 tary organizations" that operate abroad and to rec-
 ommend means to help assure that such organiza-
 tions could "play their proper and vital role." The
 panel recommendations were as follows:
 (1) It should be the policy of the United States
 Government that no Federal agency shall pro-
 vide any covert financial assistance or support,
 direct or indirect, to any of the nation's educa-
 tional or private voluntary organizations..
 (k) The Government should promptly develop
 and establish a public-private mechanism to pro-
 vide public funds openly for overseas activities
 or organizations that are adjudged deserving, in
 the national interest, of public support.
 On March 26, 1967, President Johnson said he
 accepted [the first recommendation] and directed
 all Government agencies to implement it fully. He
 said he would give "serious consideration to [the
 other] but apparently never implemented it.
 When these operations were first proposed by
 Braden, Allen Dulles had commented favorably on
 them, noting, "There is no doubt in my mind that
 we are losing the Cold War." Twenty years later,
 though we are no longer in any risk of "losing the
 Cold War," some would like to continue despite
 the regulations.
 At least one influential former CIA official's think-
 ing was simply to move to deeper cover, ... [but]
 what could such deeper cover be? ... Commercial
 establishments or profit-making organizations are
 exempt from the ban. Hence, with or without the
 acquiescence of the officials of the company, CIA
 agents might be placed in strategic positions. It is
 possible also that organizations that seemed to be
 voluntary were actually incorporated it,. such a way
 as to be profit-making. Other possibilities include
 enriching individuals by throwing business their
 way and having these individuals support suitable
 philanthropic enterprises.
 To the extent that these arrangements touch vol.
 untary organizations, they pose the same problems
 that created the distress in 1966. In short, the policy
 approved by President Johnson was sensible when
 it proscribed "direct or indirect" support. More-

 In each house of Congress, the Armed Services
 and the Appropriations Committe have a subcom-

 CIA. In the House of Representatives, even the
 names of the Appropriations subcommittee mem-
 bers are secret. In the Senate, the five senior mem-
 bers of the Appropriations Committee form a sub-
 committee on intelligence operations.
 The subcommittee of Armed Services on CIA has
 not met for at least two years-although Senator
 Symington, a member of the subcommittee, has
 sought to secure such a meeting. In  1971, Senators
 John Stennis and Allen Ellender-then the Chair-
 men of the full Armed Services and Appropriations
 Committees (as well as of their CIA subcommittees)
 said they knew nothing about the CIA-financed war
 in Laos-surely CIA's biggest operation! (Congres-

 Congressmen are understandably reluctant even
 to know about intelligence operations. Without
 publicity, and public support, there is a limit to
 their influence over the events about which they
 hear. And if they cannot appeal to their constitu-
 encies, the knowledge of secrets only makes them
 vulnerable to the smear that they leaked a secret or
 Mishandled their responsibilities.
 Approximatey 15o resolutions have been offered
 in the Congress to control the CIA and/or other
 intelligence functions. The most common resolu-
 tion has called for a joint committee on intelli-
 gence, and there is much to be said for it. Such a
 renewal of Congressional authority to review such
 matters might strengthen Congressional oversight.
 '14o more recent efforts, both sponsored by Sen-
 ator Symington, have tried different tacks. One res-
 olution called for a select committee on the coordi-
 nation of US Government activities abroad; such
 a committee would have authority over CIA and
 DOD foreign activities in particular. Another ap-
 proach called for limiting the US intelligence ex-
 penditures of all kinds to $4 billion.
 Senator Clifford Case has sought to control the
 CIA by offering resolutions that simply apply to
 "any agency of the US Government." These resolu-
 tions embody existing restraints on the Department
 of Defense (DOD) that CIA was circumventing: e.g.,
 he sought to prevent expenditure of funds for train-
 ing Cambodian military forces. In short, Senator
 Case is emphasizing the fact that CIA is a statutorily
 designed agency, which Congress empowered and
 which Congress can control.
 Congress has . . . given the executive branch a
 blank check to do intelligence, but it has not even
 insisted on seeing the results. The NSA requires the
 CIA to "correlate and evaluate intelligence relat-
 ing to the national security and provide for the ap-
 propriate dissemination of such intelligence within
 the Government . . ." (italics added). As far as the
 legislative branch of "government" is concerned,
 this has not been done. On July 17, 1972, the For-
 eign Relations Committee reported out an amend-
 ment (S. 2224) to the NSA explicitly requiring the
 CIA to "inform fully and currently, by means of
 regular and special reports" the Committees on For-
 eign Relations and Armed Services of both houses
 and to make special reports in response to their re-
 quests. The Committee proposal, sponsored by Sen-
 ator John Sherman Cooper, put special emphasis
 upon the existing precedent whereby the joint
 Atomic Energy Committee gets special reports from
 DOD on atomic energy intelligence information. f7

 WHY "SPY" AGENCIES
 ARE BEING SHAKEN UP
 Drastic changes are aimed at
 ending rivalries and improving
 the usefulness of U. S. intelli-
 gence. One result: Some inner
 workings are being disclosed.
 The supersecret U. S. intelligence ap-
 paratus is being rocked from within on
 a scale never before so visible to the
 public.
 What set off the tremor is a major
 overhaul, no'.v in progress, of the ma-
 chinery that produces the worldwide
 intelligence assessments on which crucial
 national decisions are based.
 Under James R. Schlesinger, the new
 Director  of the  Central  Intelligence
 Agency and overseer, also, of the vast
 U. S. information-gathering net-,vork-mil-
 itary  as              well  as civilian-significant
 changes are being made. They have
 these objectives:
 ? To shake up the whole system and
 sharply improve its usefulness to the
 President and his top advisers.
 ? To process vital intelligence more
 effectively, at less cost.
 Mr.  Schlesinger cracked  down  on
 CIA, his home base, first. Now he is
 expected to focus on other parts of the
 intelligence  community-military and
 civilian.
 Payroll reductions. In the reorga-
 nization process, wholesale firings have
 occurred at the CIA-a cutback, sources
 say, of perhaps more than 1,000 of the
 agency's estimated 15,000 employes.
 Some professionals assert that Mr.
 Schlesinger is bent on rooting out an
 "intellectually arrogant" clique that has
 been riding high in the CIA hierarchy
 for years.
 Others counter that the chief purpose
 of the housecleanings is to enable the
 Nixon Administration to "politicize" the
 intelligence mechanism to its own ideo-
 logical shape-and use Mr. Schlesinger
 to do it.
 Both charges are vigorously denied
 by responsible people on all sides. In-
 stead, the charges are cited as examples
 of the bitter bureaucratic infighting go-
 ing on in Washington-and spreading
 into the intelligence system.
 On one front, heated feuding between
 Pentagon intelligence specialists, trying
 to regain control of assessing military
 threats to the U. S., are citing what they
 characterize as examples of blunders and
 bias by the CIA.
 The military critics admit that their
 own mistakes a decade and more ago
 obliged the Government to turn to the
 civilian CIA for the main assessments
 on military threats. But now, the mili-
 tary men contend that DIA has been
 revamped, is more objective-and less of
 a lobby designed to scare Congress into
 voting higher defense budgets.
 Against that background of turbu-
 lence,  Mr. Schlesinger is moving to
 carry out the sweeping reorganization
 of the U. S. intelligence community orig-
 inally ordered by President Nixon a
 year and a half ago-in November, 1971.
 Knowledgeable sources say that Rich-
 ard Helms, now Ambassador to Iran,
 was replaced by Mr. Schlesinger as CIA
 Director because he failed to carry out
 the overhaul mandate to Mr. Nixon's
 satisfaction.
 A top man in the intelligence network
 put it this way: "The President and his
 national-security  adviser,  Henry  Kis-
 singer, just didn't think they were getting
 their money's worth."
 The reorganization plan, in fact, is
 Mr. Schlesinger's own handiwork. He
 drafted it while serving as Assistant
 Director of the Office of Management
 and Budget.  Later, he was named
 Chairman of the Atomic Energy Com-
 mission-the job from which he was
 transferred to his present post as Amer-
 ica's "superspy."
 Like  Mr.  Helms before  him,  Mr.
 Schlesinger is not only Director of the
 CIA but also Director of Central Intel-
 ligence-DCI. That makes him boss of
 all American intelligence operations.
 New   faces.  One thing  that  Mr.
 Schlesinger has done is to put together
 what he calls the intelligence communi-
 ty staff, with offices on the top floor of
 the CIA headquarters building in a
 Virginia suburb of Washington.
 Significantly, two military-intelligence
