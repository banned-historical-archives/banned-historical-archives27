STATEMENT BY 
MR. ALLEN W. DULLES 
DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE 
to the 
SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE 
ON 31 MAY 1960 
The duty of the Central Intelligence Agency under 
statute and under National Security Council directives pursuant 
to statute, is to provide the President and the National 
Security Council with evaluated intelligence relating to our 
national security. 
The Agency has no pollcy or police functions. 
In addition, however, the Agency has the duty, within 
policy limitations prescribed by the President and State 
Department, to do whatever is within its power to collect and 
produce the intelligence required by the policy makers in 
government, to deal with the dangers we face in the world 
today, a nuclear world. 
Increasingly over the past ten years, the main target 
for our intelligence collection has been the U.S.S.R., its 
military, its economic, and its subversive potential. 
The carrying out of this task has been rendered extremely 
difficult because the Soviet Union is a closed society. 
Great areas of the U.S.S.R. are curtained off to the 
outside world. Their military preparations are made in secret. 
Their military hardware, ballistic missiles, bombers, nuclear 
weapons, and submarine forces, as far as physically possible, 
are concealed from us. They have resisted all efforts to 
realize mutual inspection or "open skies." 
The ordinary tools of information gathering, under thee 
circumstances are not wholly adequate. These ordinary tools 
include both the normal overt means of obtaining information, 
and the classical covert means generally referred to as. espionage. 
It is true that from these sources and from the many Soviet 
defectors who have come over to the Free World and from 
disaffected and disillusioned Soviet nationals, we obtain very 
valuable information.

However, these Sources and other sources developed 
through the application of various scientific techniques, 
while very helpful, did not give us the full intelligence 
protection this country required against the danger of 
preparation for surprise attack against us, from bases which 
might remain unknown and by weapons, the strength and power 
of which we might not be able adequately to evaluate. 
Almost equally serious had been our lack of knowledge 
of Soviet defense measures against our retaliatory striking 
power. 
Shackled by traditions, we were seeing the power of 
.attack grow while the ability to secure the intelligence 
necessary for defense against attack was slipping, bound down 
in part by tradition. 
For example, while Soviet spy trawlers can lurk a few 
miles off our shores and observe us with impunity, the Soviets 
cry "aggression" when a plane, invisible to the naked eye, 
flies over it some fifteen miles above the ground. 
Either, theoretically, could carry a nuclear weapon. 
The trawler could deal a much more serious nuclear blow than 
a light reconnaissance plane. 
But, of course., as we well know, no one would think of 
starting a nuclear war with either an isolated plane or ship. 
In this age of nuclear peril we, the Central Intelligence 
Agency, felt that a new approach was called for in the whole 
field of intelligence collection. 
This was the situation, when in 1954, almost six years 
ago, consultation was initiated on new intelligence collection 
techniques. We consulted with a group of highly competent 
technicians in and out of government. From our discussions 
there emerged the concept of a high-flying, high performance 
reconnaissance plane. In the then state of the art of aeronautics, 
it was confidently believed that a plane could be designed to 
fly unintercepted over the vitally important closed areas of 
the Soviet Union, where ballistic, nuclear, and other military 
preparations against us were being made.

We also believed, as a result of these consultations, 
that the art of photography could be so advanced as to make 
the resolution of the pictures taken, even at extreme altitudes, 
Of very great significance. On both counts the accomplishments 
exceeded expectations. ? 
While the developmental work for this project, pursuant 
to high policy directive was in process, there came the Summit 
Conference of July 1955. 
Here, in order to relax the growing tentions resulting 
from the danger of surprise attack, the President advanced the 
open skies" proposal. Moscow summarily rejected anything of 
this nature, and Soviet security measures continued to be 
reinforced. 
Accordingly, the U-2 project was pushed forward rapidly, 
and about a year after the 1955 summit meeting the first 
operational U-2 flight over the Soviet Union took place. For 
almost four years the flight program has been carried forward 
successfully. 
Speed in 'getting the program underway had been a top 
priority. We were then faced, that is in 1955-1956, with a 
situation wherethe Soviets were continuing to develop their 
missiles, their heavy bomber and bomber bases, and their nuclear 
weapons production without adequate knowledge on our part. 
This was considered to 'be an intolerable situation; 
intolerable both from the viewpoint of adequate military 
preparation, on our part to meet the menace; intolerable from 
the point of view of being able effectively to take counter-
measures in the event of attack. 
It was recognized at the outset that this U-2 project 
had its risks and had a limited span of life due to improvement 
of counter measures; that a relatively fragile single-engine 
plane of the nature of the U-2 might one day have a flame-out 
or other malfunction in the rarified atmosphere in which it 
had to travel. If that resulted in a serious and prolonged 
loss of altitude, there was danger of failure and discove-y. 
To stop any enterprise of this nature because there are 
risks, would be, of course, in this field to accomplish very 
little. 
While air reconnaissance is an old and tried method of 
gaining intelligence, a peacetime operation of this particular 
type. and on this scale was unique.

But I submit that we live in an age when old concep 
of the limits of "permitted" techniques for acduiring informa-
tion are totally outdated. They come from the horse and buggy 
days. 
I see no reason whatever to draw an unfavorable distinction 
between the collection of information by reconnaissance at a 
high altitude in the air and espionage carried on by individual:3 
who illegally operate directly within the territory of another 
state. 
In fact, the distinction, if one is to be drawn, would 
favor the former. The illegal espionage agents generally 
-attempt to suborn and subvert the citizens of the countries 
in which they operate. High level air reconnaissance in no 
way disturbs the life of the people. It does not harm their 
property. They do not even notice it. 
be 
I believe these techniques should/universally sanctioned 
on a mutual basis and become an accepted and agreed part of our 
international arrangements. 
The USSR has known a good deal about these flights for 
the last four years. It has studiously refrained from giving 
the people of the Soviet Union the knowledge they now admit 
they had. 
With respect to the U-2 project, I am prepared to support 
and document these conclusions:--
First, that this operation was one of the most valuable 
intelligence collection operations that any country has ever 
mounted at any time, and that it was vital to our national 
security. 
Second, that the chain of command and authority for the 
project was clear. 
Third, that every overflight was carefully planned, fully 
authorized, and, until May 1, 1960, effectively carried out. 
Fourth, that the technical and logistic support was prompt 
and efficient. 
Fifth, that the security which was maintained for this 
project over a period of more than five years has been unique.

I shall deal with these points in the inverse order in 
which I have presented them. 
First - security. The project was run by a small, 
closely knit organization at headquarters and in the field. 
Knowledge of the operation was restricted to a minimum. Over 
more than five years, since the inception of the project, 
there has never been any damaging disclosure to interfere 
with the program. 
The existence of the U-2 aircraft was, of course, well 
known, though its full .capabilities, particularly the altitude 
and range were not disclosed. It had important weather and 
Air sampling capabilities which were effectively used and which 
afforded natural cover for the project. These weather capabilities 
were open and publicized. 
For example, as far as I know the U-2 is the first aircraft 
that has ever flown over the eye of a typhoon. It was used very 
effectively out in the Far East to.learn about typhoons which 
cause so much damage, and we have a very extraordinary series 
of pictures of the U-2 looking right down at the eye of a typhoon 
from several miles above the top of it. Of course, the U-2 also 
had very valuable characteristics as a reconnaissance plane for 
peripheral flights. 
With regard to technical and logistic support:--from the 
inception of the project, CIA has called on the United States 
Air Force for support in the form of technical advice and 
assistance in those fields where the Air Force has the most 
expert knowledge. These included advice on aircraft design and 
procurement, operational training of air crews, weather, 
aero-medicine and communications. I may say the Air Force 
liberally gave all this support to us. 
The CIA also drew on the technical knowledge and advice 
of those members of the United States Intelligence Board with 
particular competence in the field of intelligence priorities, 
targeting and the like. Each mission was carefullY planned 
with respect to the highest priority requirements of the 
Intelligence Community. 
The project has been directed by a senior civilian in 
CIA with high competence in this area of work. He was 
responsible directly to me and, of course, to General Cabell. 
Since the inception of CIA - going back for ten years - 
:personnel from the military services, including the Air Force, 
have been detailed to CIA for tours of duty. We have had as

8 or 9 hundred of them at one time. These personnel take their 
orders from CIA, not from their parent service, during their 
period of detail. The U-2 project, under its civilian director, 
drew upon both the military and civilian personnel of the Agency. 
They were assigned to duties in headquarters and in the field 
staffs which were responsible for carrying out the technical 
functions of the program. They were chosen in view of their 
particular qualifications for this particular project. 
Third, every overflight, from the inception of the project, 
and every phase of it, was carefully planned and staffed. 
From time to time intelligence requirements were reviewed, 
and programs of one or more missions were authorized by higher 
authority. 
Within the authority thus granted, specific flights 
could then be carried out on the order of the Director of 
Central Intelligence, as availability and readiness of aircraft 
and of pilot and as weather conditions permitted. 
On the afternoon of 30 April last, after carefully 
considering the field report on the weather and other determining 
factors affecting the flight then contemplated, and aftea-
consultation with General Cabell and other qualified advisors 
in the Agency, and acting within existing authority to make a 
flight at that time, I personally gave the order to proceed with 
the flight of May first. 
There was no laxity or uncertainty in the chain of command 
in-obtaining the authority to act or in giving the order to 
proceed. With respect to the flight authorized on April 30, 
the same careful procedures were followed as had been followed 
in the many preceding successful flights. 
NoiALI wish to discuss the value to the country of these 
flights from the intelligence viewpoint and from the viewpoint 
of national security considerations. I shall do this within 
the limitations of what I. think both you and I feel are the 
necessary security restrictions. 
Under the law setting up the Central Intelligence Apency, 
as Director,. I am enjoined to protect "intelligence sources and 
methods from unauthorized disclosure." Naturally I recognize 
this Committee as an authorized body to whom disclosures can 
properly be made that should not be made publicly. In so doing 
I wish to keep within the bounds of what I believe you would 
agree to be in the national interest to disclose, even here.

I feel that you should share ?the facts which I confidently 
believe justified the obvious risks of this project. '1,1ch risks 
were recognized and evaluated at all stages of the project. 
For many years, the United States Intelligence Community 
has been directing its efforts to provide the information which 
would help to meet the threat of surprise attack. Every 
available means in the classical intelligence field have been 
utilized, and over recent years these have been valuably 
supplemented by the highly technical electronic and other 
scientific means to which I have referred. 
Our main emphasis in the U-2 program has been directed 
Against five critical problems affecting our national security. 
These are: the Soviet bomber force, the Soviet missile program, 
the Soviet atomic energy program, the Soviet submarine program. 
These are the major elements constituting the Soviet Union's 
capability to launch a surprise attack. In addition, a major 
target during this program has been the Soviet air defense 
system with which our retaliatory force would have to contend, 
in case of an attack on us and a counterattack by us. 
Today, the Soviet bomber force is still the main offensive 
long range striking force of the Soviet Union. However, the 
U-2 program has helped to confirm that only a greatly reduced 
long-range bomber production program is continuing in the Soviet 
Union. It has established, however, that the Soviet Union has 
recently developed a new medium bomber with supersonic capabilities 
The U-2 program has covered many Soviet long-range bomber 
airfields, confirming estimates of the location of bases and the 
disposition of Soviet long-range bombers. It has also acquired 
data on the nuclear weapons storage facilities associated with 
them. 
Our overflights have enabled us to look periodically at 
the actual ground facilities involved. 
With respect to the Soviet missile test program -- this 
I shall illustrate graphically by showing you the photograph 
of these facilities, including both their ICBM and their IRBM 
test launching sites which could, of course, also become and 
may well be, operational sites. 
Our photography has also provided us valuable insight 
into the problem of Soviet doctrine regarding ICBM deployment. 
It has taught us much about the use which the Soviets are making 
of these sites for the training of troops in the operational 
use of the short and intermediate range ballistic missiles.

The program has provided valuable information on the 
Soviet atomic energy program. This information has been Lncludca 
in the estimate which we give periodically to the Joint Committee 
on Atomic Energy, but without referring to the actual source of 
our data. This has covered the production of fissionable 
materials, weapons development and test activities, and the 
location, type, and size of many stockpile sites. 
The project has shown that, despite Mr. :hrushchev's 
boasts that the Soviets will soon be able to curtail the 
production of fissionable materials for weapons purposes, the 
Soviets are continuing to expand fissionable material capacity. 
The Soviet nuclear testing grounds have been photographed 
more than once with extremely interesting results. The 
photography has also given us our first firm information on 
the magnitude and location of the USSR's domestic uranium 
ore and uranium processing activities, vital in estimating 
Soviet fissionable material production. We have located 
national and regional nuclear storage sites and forward storage 
facilities. 
In general, the program has continued to give useful data 
on the size and rate of growth of Soviet industry. 
The material obtained has been used for the correction 
of military maps and aeronautical charts. 
Among the most important intelligence obtained is that 
affecting the tactics of the United States deterrent air strike 
force. We now have hard information about the nature, extent, 
and in many cases, the location of the Soviet ground-to-air 
missile development. We have learned much about the basic 
concept, magnitude, operational efficiency, deployment, and 
rate of development of the Soviet air defense system, including 
their early warning radar development. 
We have obtained photographs of many scores of fighter 
air fields previously inadequately identified, and have 
photographer various fighter-types vainly attempting to 
intercept the U-2. All of this has proved invaluable to SAC 
in adjusting its plans to known elements of the opposition it 
would have to face. 
As a result of the concrete evidence acquired by the U-2 
program on a large number of targets in the Soviet Union, it 
has now been possible for U.S. commanders to make amore 
efficient and confident allocation of aircraft, crews and weapons.

U-2 photography has also made it possible to provide 
new and accurate information to strike crews which will make 
it easier for them to identify their targets and plan their 
navigation more precisely. 
We have obtained new and valuable information with regard 
to submarine deployment and the precise location of their 
submarine pens. 
In the opinion of our military, of our scientists, and 
of the senior officials responsible for our national security, 
the results of the program have been invaluable. 
The program has had other elements of value. It has 
. . 
made the Soviets less cocky about their ability to deal with 
what we might bring against them. 
They have gone through four years of frustration in 
having the knowledge since 1956 that they could be overflown 
with impunity, that their vaunted fighters were useless 
against such flights, and that their ground-to-air missile 
capability was inadequate. 
Khrushchev has never dared expose this to his own 
people. It is only after he had boasted, and we believe 
falsely, that he had been able to bring down the U-2 on May 1 
by a ground-to-air missile while flying at altitude, that he 
has allowed his own people to have even an inkling of the 
capability which we possessed. 
His frustrated military, many of whom know the facts, 
are far less confident today than they otherwise would have 
been. 
At the same time, in competent military circles among 
our allies, the evidence of American capability demonstrated 
by the present disclosure of the U-2 flights has given a new 
and better perspective of odr own relative strength as compared 
with that of the Soviet'Union. 
At this point I propose to show you some photographs 
to support my presentation regarding the intelligence value 
of the project. 
Now I shall present the facts with regard to the dispatch 
of the May 1 flight and the ensuing developments insofar as the 
intelligence aspects are concerned and insofar as they are known 
to us.

As to the timing of the fllght, there is, of course, no 
good time for a failure. 
I have already presented thc ei-rcumtancc undcr wh ch I 
assumed direct responsibility fo di,3pncUing 11115 flight. 
If this flight had been a success, we ,imuld iir covred 
certain targets of particular significance and wu would, in the 
?normal course, have wished to analyze its results before 
scheduling a further mission. When it failed, it was obvious 
even before..we received instructions that we would not .try 
. 
again before studying the cause and effects of failure.- In 
either eveht, success or failure, after this flight we were 
snot preparing to fly again for several weeks and until further 
policy guidance was received. 
With respect to the timing of the flights, the President, 
in his speech of May 25, had this to say: "As to the timing, 
the question was really whether to halt the program and thus 
forego the gathering of important information that was essential 
and that was likely tq be unavailable at a later date. The 
decision was that the program should not be halted. 
"The plain truth is this: when a nation needs intelligence 
activity, there is no time when vigilance can be relaxed. 
Incidentally, from Pearl Harbor we learned that even negotiation 
itself can be used to conceal preparations for a surprise attack." 
I would point out, also, that if you turn off all flights 
for months before international meetings and then for some time 
after such meetings and before trips to the Soviet Union of high 
American officials or trips here of Soviet officials; if you 
also estimate that in times of tension flights should be stopped 
because they might increase the tension, and in times of 
sweetness and light they should not be run because it would 
disturb any "honeymoon' in our relations with the Soviet Union; 
if, on top of this, you take into account that in much of the 
Soviet Union most days of the year are automatically eliminated 
because of weather and cloud cover and low Arctic sun, - then 
you can understand the problem of timing of flights. 
If you asked me whether or not a flight would have been 
made after this particular flight, I cannot give you the answer 
because I do not know. At the time, we had no authority for 
any mission other than the one that was then undertaken. 
With respect to the flight itself, when the aircraft did 
not reach its destination within the flight time and fuel 
capacity given it, it was presumed to be down. But at first 
we did not know where. It could have been within friendly

territory, in hostile desert, or in uninhabited territory, 
or within hostile territory where if alive the pilot would 
have been quickly apprehended as was the case.. We did not 
know whether the plane was intact or destroyed, the pilot 
alive or dead. 
I shall deal in a moment with the statements which were 
issued during this period of uncertainty. 
The question of course arises as to what actually 
happened to cause this aircraft to come down deep in the 
heart of Russia. 
Let me remind you first that the returns are not yet 
all in, and so our picture is not complete. However, we do 
lhave a considerable body of evidence that permits a reasonable 
judgment with a high degree of confidence. 
Our best judgment is that it did not happen as claimed 
by the Soviets. That is, we believe that it was not shot 
down at its operating altitude of around 70,000 feet by the 
Russians. We believe that it was initially forced down to a 
much lower altitude by some as yet undetermined mechanical 
malfunction. At that lower altitude, it was a sitting duck 
for Soviet defenses, whether fighter aircraft or ground-to-
air fire or missiles. 
As to what happened at the lower altitude, we are not 
sure. The pilot may have bailed out at any time or he may 
have crash landed. The aircraft was equipped with a destruction 
device to be activated by the pilot as he leaves the aircraft. 
Again we do not know whether or not he attempted to do so. It 
should be noted, however, that no massive destruction device 
capable of ensuring complete destruction could be carried in 
this aircraft as weight limitations were critical, and every 
pound counted. 
Thus, whether or not the destruction device was used, 
one might expect sizable and identifiable parts of the aircraft 
and its equipment to remain. 
As to the nature and cause of the suspected malfunction, 
we are not prepared to pass judgment. But let me remind you 
that this aircraft and this pilot had proven their high degree 
of reliability in many technically similar flights, inside and 
outside friendly territory. When operating as in this case, 
about 1200 miles within unfriendly, heavily-defended territory, 
. there can be no cushion against malfunction.

There has been much comment and qpestioninp; ,A_th l'e7ard 
to the pilot and his behavior after apprehension. Of cource, 
we only have the Soviets' report on all of this, and we should 
accept it with caution. 
All of the pilots engaged in th-J. ?;:el most 
carefully selected. They were highly trained, highly motivated, 
and, as seemed right, well compensated financially. But no one 
in his right mind would have accepted thece fo money alone. 
Since the operational phase of the program stalA:ed, the 
reliability record of the plane; for a craft of this character, 
was little short of phenomenal. It was a tribuLc to ,,;he high 
skill of the designer, the maintenance crews, and the pilots, 
.Until the May first flight, over about a four-year period of 
operations, no plane had been lost over unfriendly territory 
in the course of many, many missions. Several were lost during 
the training period at home and in friendly territory abroad. 
Francis Gary Powers, the pilot on the May 1 flight, is 
a fourth generation American citizen, born in Jenkins, Kentucky, 
about 31 years ago. He received a BA uegree from Milligan 
College, Tennessee, in September 1956. Scholastically he was 
high average. He joined the Air Force in the fall of 1950, as 
a private and served in an enlisted status until November 1951, 
when he was discharged as a Corporal in ordo: to enter the 
Aviation Cadet School to train as a pilot. He attended the 
Air Force Basic and Advance Pilot Training School at Greenville, 
Mississippi. Upon completion of this trainl'Ig in December 1952, 
he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. 
His first duty assignment was as an F-84 Commando Jet 
Pilot with the 468th Strategic Fighter Squadron at Turner Air 
Force Base, Georgia. He resigned his Air Force Reserve Commission 
under honorable conditions in May 1956. The reason for such 
resignation was to join the project we are discussing. 
His record with the Air Force had been uniformly good. 
He was given a special security screening by the Air Force 
and also a supplemental check by the security office of the 
CIA. 
During his Air Force career, he received training with 
respect to his behavior and conduct in event of capture, and 
after entering the employ of the Agency, he took the Agency's 
escape. and evasion course at our training station here in the 
United States in June of 1956. He had subsequent training in 
escape and evasion after his assignment to his overseas post 
. in August 1956..

worked with the U-2 pilots during their training in the United

Approved For Release 20 mvil :pcla-RDP9OT00782R000100020001-1 
and continuously during their stay overseas, had this to say 
in regard to Francis Powers, "....During the period of my 
assignment as Flight Surgeon at Adana, I not infrequently 
shared a room with Mr. Powers and participated in social, 
flying, and mission duties with him. In my opinion 'Mr. Powers 
was outstanding among the pilots for his calmness under pressure, 
his precision, and his methodical approach to problems. I have 
flown considerably in jets with Mr. Powers. I would consider 
him temperate, devoted, perhaps more than unusually patriotic, 
and a man given to thinking before speaking or acting." 
. It should be remembered that Powers was a pilot, navigator, 
a well-rounded aviator trained to handle himself under all 
conditions, in .the air or if grounded in hostile territory. 
He was not trained as an "agent" as there were no foreseeable 
circumstances, even the present ones, where he would act as such. 
Furthermore, such training would have been incompatible both 
temperamentally and with the strenuous technical demands of his 
flight missions. 
The pilots of these aircrafts on operational missions, 
and this was true in the case of Powers, received the following 
instructions for use if downed in a hostile area: 
First, it was their duty to ensure the destruction of 
the aircraft and its equipment to the greatest extent possible. 
Second, on reaching the ground it was the pilot's first duty 
to attempt escape and evasion so as to avoid capture, or delay 
it as long as possible. To aid him in these. purposes and for 
survival he was given the various items of equipment which the 
Soviets have publicized and which are normal and standard 
procedure, selected on the basis of wide experience gained in 
World War II and in Korea. 
Third, pilots were equipped with a device for self 
destruction but were not given positive instructions to make 
use of it. In he last analysis, this ultimate decision has 
to be 'left to the individual himself. 
Fourth, in the contingency of capture, pilots were instructed 
to delay as long as possible the revelation of damaging 
information. 
Fifth, pilots were instructed to tell the truth if faced 
with a situation, as apparently faced Powers, with respect. 
to those matters which were obviously within the knowledge 
of his captors as a result of what fell into their hands. 
In addition, if in a position where some attribution had to 
be given his mission, he would acknowledge that he was working 
for the Central Intelligence Agency. This was to make it clear 
that he was not working for any branch of the armed services, 
and that his mission was solely an intelligence mission.

Approved For Release 2005/C15/1.3 dr11-PIDP90T00782R000100020001-1 
These instructions were based on a careful study of our 
experience in the Korean war of the consequences of brain-
washing and of the extent of information which could be 
obtained by these and other means available to the Soviets. 
Whether or not in this instance the pilot complied with 
all of these instructions, it is hard to state today with 
the knowledge we have. However, a careful review of what he 
has said does not indicate that he has given to the Soviets 
any valuable information which they could not have discovered 
from the equipment they found upon the pilot's person or 
retrieved from the downed aircraft.. 
I would warn, of course, against putting too much belief 
in what Powers may say, particularly if he is later put on 
trial. By that time they will have had a more thorough oppor-
tunity for a complete brain-washing-operation which might well 
produce a mixture of truth and fiction. 
I will .now deal with the "cover story" statements which 
were issued following May 1. 
When a plane is overdue and the fact of its takeoff and 
failure to return is known, some statement must be made, and 
quickly. Failure to do so, and, under normal conditions, to 
start a search for the lost plane, would in itself be a suspicious 
event. 
Thus, when the U-2 disappeared on May first and did not 
return to its base within the requisite time period after its 
takeoff, action was required. 
For many years, in fact since the inception of the 
operation, consideration has been given to the cover story 
'which would be used in the case of the disappearance of a plane 
which might possibly be over unfriendly territory. 
Because of its special characteristics, the U-2 plane 
was of great interest to the U.S. weather services and to the 
National Advisory Committee for .Aeronautics, the predecessor 
of NASA. NASA was very much concerned with the scientific 
advances which operations of these U-2s could make towards 
greater knowledge of the upper atmosphere and for other 
scientific purposes. As already indicated, U-2s have now 
Undertaken many weather andrelated missions and their functions 
in this respect have been publicized by NASA, and this publicity 
has been distributed freely to the world. 
It was therefore natural that NASA's operations be used 
to explain the presence of -U72s at various bases throughout

the world, although NASA did not participate in the development 
of intelligence devices, nor did- they participate in the, planning 
and conduct of any intelligence missions. 
Accordingly, when the May first flight was lost, an initial 
statement was issued on May 2nd by the Base Commandant at Adana 
that a U-2. aircraft, engaged in upper air studies and operating 
from the base was down, and oxygen difficulties had been reported. 
This was identified in the press as a NASA plane. A search for 
the plane was initiated in the remote areas of eastern Turkey. 
On May 5, early in the day by our time, Khrushchev made 
his Claim that "an American aircraft crossed our frontier and 
continued its flight into the interior of our country... and... 
.was shot down." At that time, Khrushchev gave no further details 
of significance. 
Apparently as an attempt at deception, Khrushchev followed 
up his speech the next day by distributing photographs of a 
pile of junk -- according, to experts, pieces of an old Soviet 
fighter plane -- possibly for the purpose Of making us think 
that the U-2 plane had been effectively destroyed. Since the 
fake wreckage was quickly identified for what it was, this 
particular ruse had no effect. 
The NASA statement which followed the Khrushchev speech 
of May 5 developed somewhat further the original cover story. 
Also on May 5, the Department of State issued a further release 
which generally followed the cover story. Mr. Dillon has covered 
this in his testimony before this Committee on May 27. 
? At this time - on 5-6 May - we still did not know whether 
the plane or any recognizable parts of it or the pilot were in 
Soviet hands, or whether the pilot was dead or alive. 
Furthermore, then we did. not know whether Khrushchev desired 
to blow up the incident as he later did, or put it under the 
rug and spare his people the knowledge that we had been 
overflying them. 
Hence, in this situation, there seemed no reason at that 
time to depart from the original cover story. 
These two press releases attributed to NASA were worked 
-out in consultation between CIA and NASA and after conferring 
with the Department of State. 
- These statements did not come out of any lack Of fore-
thought or attention to their preparation or lack of coordination. 
The basic cover stOry had been developed some years ago for the

exigency of a failure, and this Original cover story was on 
May 5 modified to meet our then estimate of what was best to 
say in the light of what little we knew about the details of 
the May 1 flight failure. 
Subsequently, on May 7, Khrushchev adduced evidence that 
? he had the pilot alive, and quoted his purported statements. 
He also produced certain of the contents of the plane and 
later various parts of the plane itself. This clearly disclosed 
the true nature of the mission on which the plane was engaged. 
- The cover story was outflanked. 
The issue then was whether to admit the incident but 
deny high level responsibility, or to take the course which 
was decided upon and clearly expressed in Secretary Herter's 
statement of May 9 and in the President's statement of May 11, 
and his address of May 25, 
In Mr. Herter's appearance before this Committee, he has 
dealt with the statements which were issued during the period 
after May 6, except for the two statements involving NASA which 
I have covered. 
I would only add that in my opinion, in the light of 
all the factors involved, the decision taken to assume 
responsibility in this particular case was the correct one. 
Denial, in my opinion, over the long run would have been 
tortuous and self defeating. 
Those who took this decision knew that I was ready to 
assume the full measure of responsibility and to cover the 
project.as a technical intelligence operation carried out 
on my own responsibility as Director of CIA. This alternative, 
too, was rejected because of the many elements making it hardly 
credible over the longer run. 
This concludes my statement respecting the intelligence 
aspects of the U-2 project

complete because unless there is such candor it is most difficult for the 
Senate to discharge its responsibilities in the field of foreign policy. 
As you know, the committee has agreed that these sessions are to 
be executive. However, in order to make the maximum amount of 
information available to the public, which must in the final analysis 
understand our policies if they are to be supported by the people, we 
have arranged for a high ranking official of the executive branch to de-
lete from the executive transcript any statements or information 
which might in any way jeopardize the national security. Should 
any question arise as to whether such deletions go beyond those neces-
sary to protect the national security, I will appoint a bipartisan sub-
committee to consider such questions. 
I have urged members to limit their questions to those directly 
relevant to the recent summit conference and incidents related thereto. 
Although the committee has not considered fully all witnesses it may 
wish to hear, I have expressed the personal opinion that there is no 
occasion for private witnesses to be heard on the matter before the 
committee. 
Finally, as you know, the committee has decided that members 
should for the first time around, at least, limit their period of ques-
tioning to not to exceed 10 minutes each. 
FOCUS OF STUDY 
It is my hope, Mr. Secretary, that our study can be focused on four 
principal areas: first, the events and decisions resulting from the U-2 
incident; second, the effect of these events and decisions upon the 
summit; third, the policy of our Government regarding the summit 
meeting; and fourth, the policy of the United States in the future and 
possible improvement in the execution thereof. 
INTEREST IN HEARING 
Mr. Secretary, we have some guests from the Senate who have 
requested to come as observers. I wish to admonish them that this 
is an executive session, and that they are not to disclose on their own 
responsibility anything that takes place in these hearings. I might 
also call to the attention of the committee that it was noted in the 
press that Tass, the official governmental news agency of Soviet Rus-
sia, was the first applicant to purchase a copy of the transcript which 
will be later released, so we might keep this in mind. The staff of 
the committee has compiled a set of background documents on events 
incident to the summit conference. Those documents will be printed 
as an appendix to the hearings when they are published. 
I suggest, Mr. Secretary, that you proceed with your statement for 
the information of the committee. The Secretary has a statement 
prepared which will be the presentation of his point of view.

4 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SITMMIT CONFERENCE 
This statement is guided very much as indicated by the chairman in 
the remarks that he has just made in the next to the last paragraph 
with regard to divisions; namely, the genesis of the summit; the TJ-2 
incident; the events in Paris and the future. 
TIIE THREAT TO BERLIN 
I. The genesis of the summit 
In order to understand what happened in Paris, we need to look 
back over the preceding 18 months. 
In November 1958, the U.S.S.R. began a new strategy directed 
toward altering the situation in Berlin and East Germany in its favor. 
If the Western Powers refused to give up their present position in 
Berlin and make West Berlin a so-called free city, the Soviet Union 
stated its intention to proceed unilaterally at the end of 6 months, 
turning over full sovereignty to the so-called GDR and thereby con-
fronting the Allies with the alternative of capitulation or resort to 
force which would be met by Communist force. 
Though the strategy as it unfolded proved to be more flexible than 
its original statement, it is still the official policy of the U.S.S.R. Its 
force hes in the Soviet ability to threaten Berlin, where we are morally 
committed, but physically exposed. 
The Western Powers, of course, promptly rejected the Soviet pro-
posal and reaffirmed their determination to stand by Berlin. 
In the months that followed, while the U.S.S.R. elaborated and 
pressed its strategy, the Western Powers concerted their plans to meet 
it. They sought to engage the U.S.S.R. in negotiations, thereby 
clarifying its intentions and either attaining solutions acceptable to 
the West, or as a minimum, convincing it that unilateral action against 
Berlin would not be sound. 
ENGAGING TIIE SOVIET UNION IN NEGOTIATION 
It was by no means a foregone conclusion that the U.S.S.R. would 
negotiate on an acceptable basis. In January 1959 the U.S.S.R. pro-
posed a conference to adopt a peace treaty with the two parts of an 
indefinitely divided Germany. 
The Western Powers continued to maintain that a peace treaty 
could be negotiated and signed only with a united Germany, hence 
that the reunification of Germany must be settled first. 
They also maintained that the only proper solution for Berlin lay 
in its becoming the capital of a unified Germany, and therefore, they 
were unwilling to discuss Berlin as an isolated issue. But the U.S.S.R. 
had held for some time that reunification was solely the business of 
the Germans and therefore refused to discuss it. 
The West persisted during February and March in its efforts to 
get the Russians talking somehow. It proposed a meeting of Foreign 
Ministers, with the prospect of a possible summit meeting when due 
preparations had been made. The U.S.S.R. had repeatedly indicated 
a desire for that summit meeting since 1956. Finally, a compromise 
agenda, which did not prejudice the substantive views of either side, 
was adopted for a Foreign Ministers' meeting and a date was set in 
May shortly before the expiration of the original Soviet deadline for 
meeting their arbitrary demands on Berlin.

EVENTS INCIDENT Tu MBE 
FOREIGN MINISTERS' DEADLOCK 
During the intensive preparations for the meeting the Western 
Powers developed a new version of their basic position regarding 
Germany, which was submitted at Geneva as the Western peace plan. 
It consisted in approaching the unification of Germany through a 
series of stages, thereby offering the U.S.S.R. a chance to adjust 
its position gradually to the eventual loss of its hold on East Ger-
many which free elections would presumably bring. 
The plan showed flexibility and imagination; it appealed to world 
opinion ? but its rejection by the U.S.S.R. was none the less flat. 
The -U.S.S.R. stuck adamantly to its previously announced pro-
posals for a peace treaty with a divided Germany. Thus, the basic 
positions remained totally unreconciled. 
Finding no progress possible on Germany, the Western Powers and 
the U.S.S.R. explored the possibility of an interim agreement on 
Berlin which, without contemplating a basic solution of Berlin as a 
separate issue would do something to mitigate difficulties which the 
U.S.S.R. professed to find there. Though some progress was made 
in this direction, the U.S.S.R. insisted on language which would have 
implied the eventual erosion of the Western position in Berlin. 
Accordingly, despite the labor of 3 months with only one short ad-
journment, the Foreign Ministers' meeting ended in deadlock. 
HIGH LEVEL TRIPS 
The failure of the Foreign Ministers' meeting did not 
result in a war crisis, however, because a _parallel train of events had 
meanwhile brought hope in a different direction. We took the op-
portunity of Mikoyan's visit to the Soviet Embassy here in January 
to arrange informal exchanges of views between the Soviet leader. 
and top U.S. officials. 
This was followed in Juno and July by further visits and ex-
changes of Kozlov to this country and the Vice President to the 
U.S.S.R. The fact that these visits took place without public inci-
dent and made possible somewhat more realistic communication than 
usual with the Soviet leadership seemed to offer a possibility?only 
a possibility, of course?that means of avoiding war and eventually 
getting Soviet-Western relations into somewhat dangerous shape 
might found by developing these informal contacts. 
Accordingly the President decided to go ahead with a move which 
he and his advisers had long had in mind when the time seemed right. 
He invited Chairman Khrushchev to visit this country, and the visit 
was announced before the Foreign Ministers ended. their Geneva 
meeting. 
During that visit no progress was made, or indeed expected, on 
resolving outstanding problems, but a somewhat greater degree of 
mutual understanding was seemingly attained, particularly on the 
need to settle international questions by peaceful means rather than 
by force. There was also a suspension, later publicly acknowledged, 
of whatever was left of the Soviet ultimatum on Berlin.

PREPARATION FOR THE gummrr 
After the Khrushchev visit it was judged feasible and desirable by 
the Western Powers to move toward renewed discussion, this time at 
the summit. Some flicker of hope for progress on Berlin had ap-
peared at Camp David, whereas Geneva had ended in deadlock. Dur-
ing his American visit Khrushchev had also evinced an interest in the 
equally vital field of disarmament, and even though disarmament talks 
were to start in the Committee of Ten at Geneva it was felt that 
Khrushchev might reserve his constructive moves, if any, for the 
summit. 
Accordingly, after due consultations among the Western heads of 
government, an invitation to a summit was sent to Khrushchev and 
accepted by him and after some difficulty over earlier dates the time 
was finally set for May 16. This move found broad support in West-
ern public opinion. 
There ensued an intensive and protracted series of preparations 
on the Western side, involving repeated meetings not only of the 
Foreign Ministers and of NATO but even of the heads of govern-
ment. Within our own Government we also studied most carefully 
the possibilities of making progress not only on Berlin and Germany 
but most particularly in disarmament, as well as other aspects of 
general Soviet-Western relations. 
At the December meeting of Western heads of government a con-
sensus emerged that the May summit might well be only one of a series 
of such meetings, and that it would be largely exploratory. Some 
modest progress was hoped for, but no major solutions on any front. 
But if a beginning could be made, the series of talks, possible in a 
gradually improving atmosphere over the years, might do substan-
tially more. 
SUMMIT PROSPECTS DIMMED 
In the first weeks after the Khrushchev American visit there was 
a general improvement of atmosphere and people began talking, partly 
in hope, partly in some confusion, about "detente." There were com-
paratively conciliatory speeches on each side ? there was progress in 
the test ban talks at Geneva; a new Soviet-United States cultural 
agreement was signed November 21, and on December 1 the United 
States, the U.S.S.R., and other powers signed the Antarctic Treaty. 
But clouds began to gather even then. One of the earliest signs 
was the strong Soviet protest on November 11 against West German 
plans to build a broadcasting station in West Berlin. Another was 
the Khrushchev speech on November 11 which was harder in tone, 
boasted again of Soviet missile prowess and began a concentrated 
attack oeAdenauer and the German Federal Republic which later 
increased and seemed to be a central feature of Soviet presummit tac-
tics. The reason for this attack is still a matter for speculation. 
Perhaps they thought it would undermine the Western position on 
Berlin by helping to divide the Western Allies. It had no such effect 
of course, but naturally rallied us to speak out in defense of our Ger-
man ally. 
Khrushchev as early as December 1 also began repeating his 
threats to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany. He repeat-
ed these threats in his speech to the Supreme Soviet on January 11

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 7 
and in his remarks during his visit to Indonesia and other countries 
in January. On February 4, the Warsaw Pact powers issued the first 
formal blocwide commitment to sign a separate GDR peace treaty. 
Thus Khrushchev's threatening Baku speech of April 25, though it 
was the most sweeping since February 1950, was only a harsher 
version of what he had been saying for months before. I shall make 
full documentation on his speeches available to the committee. 
Not until April did we reply at length to this mounting crescendo of 
Soviet statements. We did so in order to keep the record straight?
notably in the speeches of April 4 and 20, which Khrushchev attacked 
for starting arguments that he in fact had begun. 
The unity of the four Western Powers on Berlin meanwhilepre-
sumably signaled to the U.S.S.R. that prospects for eroding the est-
ern position or obtaining Soviet terms on Berlin remained slight. 
President de Gaulle and other leaders were quite firm in discouraging 
expectations on this front. The NATO Council in Istanbul May 2 1 
also reaffirmed the Western position on German reunification and re-
gretted Soviet refusal to discuss specific practical measures of dis-
armament. Thus as the summit drew near the prospects for important 
agreement seemed slender, so long as the U.S.S.R. remained com-
mitted to driving the Western Powers out of Berlin and to dis-
cussing disarmament in terms of general principles rather than con-
crete steps. 
The Western outlook consistently remained, however, that the sum-
mit would be worthwhile. It would afford an opportunity for an ex-
change of views which would clarify each side's position; it might con-
tribute to some reduction of tensions over Berlin and narrow some of 
our differences on disarmament. It could be at least a small first step 
in a long process of improving Soviet-Western relations. 
IT-2 INCIDENT 
H. The U-2 incident 
On May 1 occurred the unfortunate failure of an intelligence mis-
sion. The U.S.S.R. at once seized on it to complicate the approach 
to the summit. With regard to the role of the U.S. Government in 
this matter, I cannot hope to improve on the lucid and straight-
forward account which the President gave to the Nation Wednesday 
night. I will, therefore, not attempt to go into detail, although I am 
of course ready to answer questions concerning my responsibilities. 
CENTRAL POINTS IN PRESIDENT'S ACCOUNT OF 17-2 INCIDENT 
Here I would only like to reemphasize four central points which 
stood out in the President's account: 
1. The U-2 program was an important and efficient intelligence 
effort. We knew that failure of any mission under this program would 
have serious consequences, ?but we considered that the great benefit 
derived justified the risks involved. 
2. The decision not to suspend this program of flights, as the sum-
mit meeting approached, was a sound decision. Conditions at a later 
season would have prevented obtaining very important information. 
There is never a "good time" for a failure of an intelligence mis-
sion. We believe it unwise to lower our vigilance because of these 
political negotiations.

8 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
3. Initial statements by the U.S. Government properly sought first 
of all to protect the pilot, his intelligence mission, and everything 
connected with it that might still be kept secret. But when it be-
came clear that plane and pilot were in Soviet hands we believed 
the Congress and. the American people should be given the facts. 
Thus up to May 7 U.S. statements followed the general line of the 
cover story, and thereafter were adjusted to the situation as it de-
veloped. 
4. Since the U-2 system had been compromised, it was discontinued 
as any other intelligence mission would be in such a case. An-
nouncement of its discontinuance was withheld until the President 
'could convey the fact personally in Paris. 
Based on these four points, I believe most Americans will agree 
that the main course of our actions, given what we knew at any 
particular time, was sound. In _particular, I have doubts that any 
alteration in the language of U.S. statements would have made any 
difference in the arbitrary Soviet demands which followed. 
KHRTTSIICI-IEVIS ARRIVAL IN PARIS 
III. The events lin Paris 
I should like to give you an account of the major developments at 
Paris. I shall be as brief as possible, since the details have been 
widely publicized. But I would like to tell you of those events which 
in my opinion had a determinant effect there, and particularly those 
which influenced the decisions of the President. 
On my arrival in Paris on Friday, May 13, there was already con-
siderable speculation at the news that Mr. Khrushchev was arriving 
in Paris on Saturday rather than on Sunday, the day on which the 
President and Mr. Macmillan were due to arrive. 
Mr. Khrushchev's statement on arrival at Orly Airport gave no 
indication of his subsequent position. It was mild in character and 
conveyed the distinct impression that he would proceed with the 
summit conference despite the U-2 incident. Subsequent events 
showed that this was deliberately designed to conceal his real purpose. 
PREMIER KIIRUSIICHEVIS CALLS ON PRESIDENT DE GAI7LLE AND PRIME 
MINISTER MACMILLAN 
On Sunday at 11 a.m., at his request, Mr. Khrushchev, accompanied 
by Foreign Minister Gromyko and Marshal Malinovsky?which is in 
itself an unusual procedure which I shall revert to later?called on 
President de Gaulle at the Elysee Palace. 
During this meeting he left with President de Gaulle a memoran-
dum setting forth the conditions which would have to be met by the 
United States before Khrushchev would be prepared to attend a 
summit conference. The French delegation provided a copy of this 
memorandum to the American delegation early that afternoon. The 
memorandum was subsequently presented by Mr. Khrushchev' with-
out change' as the opening part of his statement to the Four Power 
meeting on Monday morning, May 16. 
After visiting President de Gaulle Sunday morning, Khrushchev 
called on Prime Minister Macmillan at 4:30 p.m. on the same day 
and read the same statement of position to him.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
The copy of the statement received from the French delegation was, 
of course, the subject of immediate consultation with the President 
and with members of the American delegation as to its significance 
and meaning. 
BINDING NATURE 01' DECISIONS MADE PRIOR TO KIIRUSIICIIEV'S DEPARTURE 
FROM MOSCOW 
It was our general conclusion, subsequently borne out by the facts, 
that the position and totally unacceptable demands set forth in this 
document had been drawn up in Moscow prior to Mr. Khrushchev's 
departure. In this sense it represented a fixed Soviet governmental 
position from which even Mr. Khrushchev would not have the au-
thority to depart while in Paris. 
I might digress here to observe that it had been our experience at 
previous conferences with the Soviets, at least since the death of 
Stalin, that the Soviet representative, no matter how highly placed 
he might be, was bound by the collective decisions on basic policy 
matters made prior to his departure from Moscow. Any substantive 
changes in these positions apparently required reference back to Mos-
cow before they could be undertaken. 
PRESIDENT'S POSITION AT FIRST CONFERENCE MEETING 
I should like to emphasize the opinion which was thus unanimously 
arrived at in the American delegation, since it bore directly upon the 
position which the President took at the meeting on Monday morning. 
It was out of the question, of course, that there should be any ac-
vase' ceptance by the President of the humiliating and arrogant conditions 
of Mr. Khrushchev. We had very much in mind, however, the im-
portance of showing the world that it was Mr. Khrushchev, and no 
one else, who was placing this summit conference in peril. 
The president, therefore, decided before the Monday meeting that 
the proper course of action, consonant with the great responsibility 
which he bore and the seriousness of the issues which were to have 
been discussed at the conference, was for him not to engage in vituper-
ation with Mr. Khrushchev but to demonstrate the restraint and 
dignity which was incumbent upon the office he holds and which be-
fitted the leader of a great country. 
FIRST MEETING OF SUMMIT CONFERENCE-ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
SUSPENSION OF U-2 FLIGHTS 
In connection with this decision, the President resolved to announce 
to the conference his previously taken decision to suspend further 
flights of U-2 aircraft over the Soviet Union. 
Although the original intention had been to restrict the first meeting 
of the conference at the summit to the chiefs of state and heads of 
government and to their interpreters, the President, on learning 
that Mr. Khrushchev wished to bring Foreign Minister Gromyko 
and Marshal Malinovsky, asked Secretary Gages and myself to ac-
company him to this meeting. 
I do not need to describe this meeting in detail beyond saying that 
Mr. Khrushchev read a statement which, with interpretation, took

10 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
fully an hour. He read this entire statement from a prepared text 
before him. The first part of this statement was the memorandum 
which he had left with President de Gaulle, plus certain additions 
which were in the same vein as regards the United States and which 
referred to Soviet willingness to hold a summit conference within 
6 to 8 months. The major addition was the cancellation of the in-
vitation to the President to visit the Soviet Union. 
Apart from his statement, which was made public, the President 
only once joined in the ensuing discussion?in order to make clear to 
Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues that the suspension of the U-2. 
flights was not merely for the duration of the conference, but for as 
long as he was in office. 
The balance of the discussion at this meeting, which I should point 
out was the only one during the entire period in Paris at which the 
Soviets were present, was largely devoted to attempts by President de 
Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan to dissuade Mr. Khrushchev 
from the irrevocable step of publishing his abusive statement, whose 
unacceptable conditions would render impossible any conference at 
the summit, and to Khruslichev's adamant insistence that he would 
publish this statement and do so at a time of his own choosing. The 
meeting broke up on the basis of a suggestion by President de Gaulle 
that the conferees should reflect on this matter for 21 hours and then 
examine the situation. 
BINDING NATTJRE OF DECISIONS MADE PRIOR TO KIIRUSIICIIEV'S DEPARTURE 
FROM MOSCOW 
This meeting completely confirmed our conclusion of the night 
before that Mr. Khrushchev was operating within the fixed limits of 
a policy set before his departure from Moscow. It is significant in 
this connection that the statement he issued later that day, Monday, 
May 16, which was identical with the one he had made at the confer-
ence, took no cognizance whatsoever of the discussion at the conference, 
and in particular of the President's statement concerning the suspen-
sion of U-2 overflights. 
FINAL PROCEEDINGS IN PARIS 
Secretary HERTER. The rest of the proceedings in Paris were anti-
climactic. It was apparent to all the Western representatives that 
there was no possibility of a summit conference short of a changed 
position on Mr. Khrushchev's part. On Monday, Mr. Macmillan 
visited Mr. Khrushchev in a fruitless effort to persuade him to with-
draw his impossible demands. 
On that same day, President de Gaulle decided, with the agreement 
of the President and Prime Minister Macmillan, to call a session of 
the summit conference for 3 p.m. on Tuesday, May 17, which was after 
the 24-hour recess which he had proposed on Monday. He sent invi-
tations in writing to the three other participants. 
The President'', in accepting, made clear his view that acce-Dtance by 
the Soviet representative would mean that the Soviets had abandoned 
the demands which the President had previously found completely 
unacceptable.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 11 
Mr. Khrushchev did not show up at the appointed time for the 
Tuesday meeting. After a great deal of telephoning between the 
Soviet Embassy and the French Foreign Office it became clear that 
he was refusing to attend a summit conference and would only join 
in what he termed a preliminary meeting to ascertain if conditions 
could be created for a summit conference. By this reference to "con-
ditions" he obviously meant the acceptance by the United States of all 
of the conditions he had set forth previously, and indeed he so stated 
in a written communication to President de Gaulle later that same 
day. 
THE TRIPARTITE COMMUNIQUE 
In the light of Mr. Khrushchev's refusal to attend the summit 
conference, except on terms which all three Western representatives 
deemed unacceptable, the three Western heads of government met 
briefly at 9:30 p.m., on May 17 to approve the final tripartite com-
munique, a copy of which I should like to insert in the record, at 
this point. 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes; it may be done. 
(The tripartite communique referred to appears on p. 235 of ap-
pendix 1.) 
TrarmarrE MEETINGS TO ASSESS SITUATION 
Secretary HERTER. Thus the summit conference was ended by 
Soviet intransigence before it began, without addressing the great 
international issues with which it was supposed to deal. 
The following day, Wednesday, May 18, was marked by tripartite 
meetings of the Western heads of government and their foreign min-
isters to consider the situation. In these meetings we soug;ht to 
analyze the reasons for the Soviet attitude, prospects for the future, 
and the measures that the three Western Powers might adopt. 
PREMIER KIIRLISIICIIEV'S PARIS PRESS CONFERENCE 
This day was also marked by Mr. Khrushchev's press conference, 
which was fully reported by press, television, and radio. It was 
apparently an unparalleled performance of vituperation, abuse, and 
loss of temper. It should be noted, however, that despite the appar-
ently uncontrolled nature of his remarks and actions at this press 
conference, Mr. Khrushchev was very careful not to commit himself to 
any specific course of action in the international field. 
ANALYSIS OF SOVIET ACTION 
We have naturally given a great deal of thought to the reasons for 
this extraordinary action by the Soviets in coming all the way from 
Moscow to Paris for the sole purpose of sabotaging the conference. 
I should like to say right off that there are many obscure aspects 
of this Soviet behavior and that we do not know all considerations and 
factors which went into its determination. We probably never shall. 
I hardly need to emphasize here to the members of this committee 
the complete secrecy in which decisions are arrived at in the Soviet 
Government and in the hierarchy of the Communist Party, which is 
the effective ruler of that country. It is only possible to try to deduce

12 EVENTS lNCH)ENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
from Soviet actions, after they are taken, the considerations which 
brought them about. What I give you now, therefore, is at best a 
tentative estimate of why the Soviet Union behaved as it did, an 
estimate which may have to be revised i a the light of further informa-
tion and future events. 
DECISION TO WRECK CONFERENCE MADE PRIOR TO KHRUSTICHEV'S DEPARTURE 
FROM MOSCOW 
There is one thing, however, that can be regarded as certain: This 
is that the decision to wreck the conference was made prior to Khru-
0-whey's departure from Moscow. At no point during his stay in 
Paris?neither when he disclosed his true intentions to General de 
Gaulle at 11 a.m. on Sunday the 15th nor subsequently?did Khru-
shchev deviate one inch from his demands that the United States (1) 
denounce the overflights, (2) apologize to the Soviet Union, (3) 
punish these flights. Neither the statement made by the President at 
the one meeting held on Monday nor the serious and responsible efforts 
of General de Gaulle and Mr. Macmillan in bilateral talks with Mr. 
Khrushchev before and after the President's announcement of sus-
pension of flights could persuade him to withdraw these unacceptable 
demands. Indeed, it is a logical deduction from his behavior in Paris 
that he had no authority to modify his position to any significant 
degree. 
SIGNIFICANCE OF GROMYE 0 AND MAI:INOVSKY ACCOMPANYING 
KIIKUSIICH EV 
The fact that he was accompanied everywhere, and literally every-
where, by Foreign Minister Gromyko and Marshal Malinovsky is an 
interesting sidelight on this point. There is much speculation as to 
this change from his previous attitude during his visits both to the 
United States and France, when he insisted upon having meetings 
alone with the President and with President de Gaulle, with only 
interpreters present. The best guess as to the significance of this new 
factor is that (1) in view of the brutal and threatening attitude he 
adopted at Paris it was considered desirable to have some tangible evi-
dence of Soviet armed strength in the person of Marshal Malinovsky. 
Secondly, Gromyko and Malinovsky would be able to testify upon 
return to Moscow that he had stuck strictly to the agreed position. 
DECISION TO CANCEL INVITATION TO PRESIDENT EISENHOWER; SOVIETS' 
EXTREME POSITION 
It also seems certain that the decision to cancel the invitation to the 
President was made before Khrushchev left Moscow. 
As to what led the Soviets to this extreme position, in regard to the 
summit meeting which had previously appeared so much desired by 
Mr. Khrushchev, we enter into the realm of pure speculation, as I 
indicated earlier. The most we can hope to do in the absence of 
reliable information is to evaluate the elements and factors which 
appear to have entered into this decision. I shall try to list them 
briefly.

SIGNIFICANCE OF KHRUSHCHEV'S DOUBTS OF SUMMIT SUCCESS ON 
SOVIET TERMS 
1. There was considerable indication, particularly during April 
that Mr. Khrushchev had concluded that there was little likelihood 
of his having his way, particularly in regard to Berlin, at the summit. 
Evidence of 'Western determination and unity on this point in speeches 
and statements by Western leaders appears to have brought him to 
this conclusion. Thus in his Baku speech on April 25, he not only 
reiterated with the utmost finality his position on Berlin, including his 
intention to conclude a separate peace treaty with the East German 
regime, but he also began for the first time seriously to cast doubts 
upon the success of the summit. By this of course he meant success on 
Soviet terms. 
SOVIET HIERARCHY'S VIEWS OF KIIRUSIICHEV'S FOREIGN POLICY AND 13-2 
INCIDENT 
2. Although the evidence is highly inconclusive there are a number 
of indications that Mr. Khrushchev's conduct of Soviet foreign policy, 
particularly his overpersonalization and in Communist eyes over-
commitment through personal visits to the United States and France, 
was arousing at least serious questioning if not opposition to the So-
viet hierarchy. It would seem a logical deduction that some of the 
opposition to his conduct of foreign relations which was openly 
voiced by the Chinese Communists found a sympathetic response 
among some of his associates, and very probably among the Soviet 
military. 
3. It was against this background that the U-2 incident occurred. 
WEIGHING THE FACTORS RESULTING IN CONFERENCE DISRUPTION 
A combination of these three factors in our judgment is what re-
sulted in the definite and brutal decision to disrupt the Paris con-
ference. To determine how each of these factors should be weighed 
is, for the moment, beyond our reach. 
The U-2 incident was most certainly seized upon and magnified 
beyond its true proportions as a justification for this decision. It is 
debatable whether it would have been possible for Mr. Khrushchev 
to devise another pretext for so radical and violent a position. 
It might well be that a lack of success at the summit would have 
confronted Khrushchev with a much more difficult choice, from his 
point of view, than no conference at all. Ile and his associates may 
have therefore much preferred to avoid facing the consequences of 
failure of negotiation by the simple expedient of torpedoing the 
conference. 
BASIC MISCALCULATION IN SOVIET THINKING 
It may seem incredible to you that responsible leaders of a great 
power should have come all the way to Paris merely for the purpose 
of wrecking the conference, thereby incurring worldwide condem-
nation of the Soviet Union and enhancing the sense of unity and pur-
pose among not only the Western Powers represented there but also 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and free nations everywhere.

t EVENTS IN C I DENT CO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
I believe the answer lies in a basic miscalculation in Mr. Khru-
slichev's and the Soviet's thinking. 
Mr. lihruslichey undoubtedly hoped?and. this explains his early 
arrival in Paris?to divide the allies and isolat'e the I nit ad St WI CS. 
Ile anticipated that the United States would refuse the demands he 
had set forth and that the conference would then collapse, with the 
United States -Iva ri rig responsibility for the rupture before world 
opinion. 
His plans miscarrie,4 I because our two allies stood sol idly and loyally 
with the United States a nd refused to be parties to Mr. _Khrushchev's 
scheme. The result, as t he whole world knows, was that the position 
which Mr. Khrushchey brought to Paris resulted in the complete 
isolation of the Soviet 'Union rather than the United States and in 
placing the responsibility for the disruption of the conference squarely 
where it belongs?on his own shoulders. 
This estimate of the reasons for Mr. Khrushchev's behavior is 
strongly supported by the attack which he made at his press confer-
ence on General de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan for what he 
termed their lack of objectivity, lack of will and subservience to the al-
lied relationships-4n other words, in plain English, for their solidarity 
with the United Slates, their loyalty to our common purpose, and their 
refusal to play the Soviet game. 
SIGNS Oi \O RADICAL ALTERATION IN SOVIET POLT(71Y 
117. The future 
What conclusions should we draw for the future? 
1 believe the signs are that there has been as yet no radical altera-
tion in Soviet, policy, though we can expect the continuance of a propa-
ganda effort designed to split off the United States from its allies. 
This conclusion is supported by Mr. Khrushchev's Paris statements, 
including those at his press conference. It is supported, somewhat 
more specifically and definitely, by the statements which he made in 
Berlin on his way home. 
We must remember, however, that, given the nature of the Soviet. 
state, the men who run it can meet in secret at any time and change 
existing policy without public debate or even foreshadowing any such 
change. It is for this reason that any statement about a phase of So-
viet policy must be regarded as qualified, with no certainty that it will 
remain valid in the future. 
Thus, though the world's hopes have been keenly disappointed by 
the fact; that the summit conference was not held as plan tied, the signs 
so far are that the basic realities of the world situation have not been 
greatly changed. Whether this continues to be so depends, as I have 
indicated, on actions of the leading Communist countries. 
1)1 cwrioNs Ft E .5. EOM CV 
Provisionally, however, I conclude that the implication for IT.S. 
policy is that the main lines of our policy remain sound and should be 
continued. The lesson of Paris is that we should prosecute those lines 
with renewed effort. Proponents within the Communist bloc of an 
aggressive course must not be encouraged by signs of weakness on our 
part. Proponents of a peaceful course should be encouraged by our

readiness to get on with outstanding international business in a sober 
and rational manner. 
We must remain prepared to withstand aggressive pressures, not 
only in Berlin but also elsewhere. I trust that our evident readiness 
will deter such pressures. 
FRESH REALIZATION OF THE DANGERS WE FACE 
Among the lessons of Paris, the most important for the free world, 
including ourselves, it seems to me is fresh realization of the dangers 
we face and consequent need for Closing of ranks and moving ahead 
with our own and our allies' programs for strengthening the free world. 
We came back from Paris with a keener sense of what it means to have 
allies, and I am sure that our alliances will take new life from this ex-
perience. 
At the same time I would stress equally the need to expand imagi-
natively and generously our collaboration with the newly developing 
countries. 
On both accounts, I hope the Congress will give wholehearted sup-
port to our mutual security programs as authorized by this committee, 
which are now more important than ever. 
SEEKING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS WITH THE SOVIET 
UNION 
We must continue, as the President has said, to seek in a businesslike 
way to make progress on outstanding problems with the Soviet Union. 
We intend to go ahead with existing negotiations, to stand by our com-
ls/ mitments, and to foster open communication and peaceful exchanges. 
Above all, we shall not cease from the most determined, patient, re-
sourceful endeavor to find ways to bring the arms race under con-
trol and thus to meet the nuclear menace that hangs over mankind. 
MAINTAINING A VIGILANT, CALM, AND RESOLUTE POSTURE 
I believe in this period it is incumbent upon us, all of us, to keep 
a calm and steady gaze on the world scene and to avoid actions, state-
ments, and attitudes which might tend unnecessarily to increase inter-
national tension. If such an increase is to occur, it should be clearly 
the fault of the Soviets and we should not do them the favor of 
providing pretext for action by them which would have this effect. 
We should not define as "hard" or "soft" our attitude or policy 
toward the Soviet Union. To do so is not only to deflect our gaze 
from the grim reality that confronts us, but even more to plunge us 
inevitably into fruitless and damaging domestic recrimination. We 
must now, as in the future, maintain a vigilant, calm, and resolute 
posture and, insofar as it lies in our power to do so, be accurate in 
our estimates and effective in our actions. 
I would close in expressing the hope that we will not become so 
fixed in preoccupation with the Soviet challenge as to lose sight of 
our own constructive purposes?which are larger and more im-
portant than merely resisting or reacting to external threats. We 
have our own vision of the future toward which we want to see the 
world evolve. We have our own programs for helping to bring that

Mr. Reporter, I have the documentation mentioned by the Secretary 
on page 4, which wil I be inserted in the record at this point. They are

(The documentation referred to is as follows:) 
STATEMENTS DY KITRUSHCHEV SINCE VISIT TO UNITED STATES 
'orinued by the Department of Statel 
The following is a collect ion of public statements made by Khrusbehev from 
the time of his departure from the United States until May 5, 1960, which are 
offensive or threatening in nature vis-a-vis the West, particularly the United 
States. The statements are arranged under the following headings: (1) Berlin.-
ermany ; (2) United States and Western policy; (3) the summit ; (4) com-
ments on West during Asian tour. They have been extracted from the following 
statements and speeches: 
Speech in Moscow, upon return from United States, September 28, 1959. 
Speech in Vladivristoh. October 8, 1959. 
Speech to Supreme Soviet, October 31, 1959. 
Speech to Soviet journalists., November 14, 1959. 
Speech at Hungarian Party Congress, 1)ecember 1, 1959. 
Speech to Supreine Soviet, January 14, 1960. 
Letter to Chancellor Adenauer, January 28, 1964). 
Speech to Indian Parliament, February 11, 1960. 
Speech at Delhi (a vi c reception, February 12, 1960. 
Speech at Bhilai, February 15, 1960. 
Speech at Calcutta dinner, February 15, 1960. 
Speech at JogjaLarta, February 21, 1900. 
Speech to Indonesian Parliament, February 26, 1960. 
Press conference at. Jakarta, February 29, 1960. 
Press conference at Jakarta, March 1, 1960. 
Speech at press luncheon. March 25, 1960. 
Speech in Rheims, March 29, 1960. 
Press conference at Rambouillet, April 2, 1960. 
Speech in Moseow, upon return from France, April 4, 1960. 
Speech in Baku, April 25, 1960. 
It should be noted that this collection does not include private statements and 
criticisms of West Germany. On occasion, Khrushchev has been especially 
offensive and threatening in private talks. The Federal Republic and Chancel-
lor Adenauer personally were the chief targets of offensive public statements on 
Khrushchev's part during this period. Beginning with his November 14 speech 
to Soviet journalists, Klirvishchev launched a vigorous campaign of slander 
against the FRG and Adena her designed to discredit them and isolate the FRG 
from the West. At times these public statements were truly scurrilous, liken-
ing the Chancellor to Nazis, to Hitler, calling him senile, etc. 
It is also important 10 note that in his December 1 speech in Budapest, after 
a lapse of 31/4 months. Kbrushehey renewed his threat of a separate peace 
treaty without any provocation on the part of the West. Apparently Khru-
slichev then concluded that the West would go ahead with a summit conference 
and that it was therefore timely to begin exerting pressure on the West on the 
key issue of Berlin. Moreover, Khrushchev's threat of a separate treaty, in 
terms of the consequences for the allied position in Berlin, became more explicit 
and menacing with each succeeding major speech after the December 1 speech, 
culminating in his April 25 Baku speech threat that the allies would thereby 
not only be deprived of a legal basis for maintaining access, but would have 
no right to maintain troops in Berlin.

BERLIN-GERMANY 
"The only way [to settle the Berlin problem] is to sign a peace treaty with 
Germany, and we have submitted a proposal to that effect. There is no evading 
a peace treaty for anyone, if the other countries on whom the signing of a peace 
treaty depends stand for peace and coexistence. The vestiges of World War II 
must at long last be removed, since they constitute a source that nourishes the 
instigators of a third world war. We are not forcing a solution of the West 
Berlin problem in point of time; we are setting no deadlines, issuing no ultima-
tums; but at the same time we shall not slacken our efforts to come to terms 
with our allies. 
"If we? try all means and they do not lead to the desired results, we shall have 
no other way out except signing a peace treaty with whichever of the two Ger-
man states wants it. And in such a case we shall bear no responsibility for the 
refusal to sign the peace treaty. It will he borne by those who had an unrea-
sonable approach to the solution of this problem, who did not take the road of 
easing tension in relations between states but, on the contrary, wanted to 
preserve the dangerous source threatening the outbreak of a third world 
war * * * 
"We are doing our utmost to make the Soviet proposals acceptable. We do 
not impose them, but wish to reach agreement through negotiations, though we 
have every right to sign a peace treaty with the GDR if the Government of 
the Federal Republic of Germany does not wish to sign a peace treaty. 
"We have before our eyes the example of the United States of America, which 
has signed a peace treaty with Japan without us. However, it cannot be held 
that one side can unilaterally sign treaties while the other cannot, though a 
peace treaty with Japan was signed earlier to its detriment. * * * 
"The liquidation of the occupation regime in West Berlin will undoubtedly be 
conducive to this [improving relations]. We wish to reach agreement with all 
our former allies. This is why we do not fix any time limits. We want the 
solution of this question to improve, not worsen, our relations. The Soviet 
Government is ready to try out any conceivable peaceful means to secure a 
reasonable solution of the German problem, to promote the improvement of the 
international atmosphere, and to create conditions for disarmament and the 
NNW' establishment of eternal peace on earth for the sake of mankind's happiness. 
"But if we do not meet with understanding, if the forces backing Chancellor 
Adenauer obstinately insist on the 'positions of strength' policy, we shall have 
no other choice left but to sign a peace treaty with the GDR. The Soviet Union 
does not intend to connive with those who are for the continuation of the 
`positions of strength' policy. We and our allies would readily sign a treaty 
with West Germany, but if we do not succeed in this, we shall be compelled to 
sign a unilateral treaty with the GDR." (Speech at Hungarian Party Con-
gress, December 1, 1959. Khrushchev's first public threat to sign a separate 
peace treaty with the GDR after his U.S. visit.) 
"The Soviet Government considers that a peaceful settlement with Germany 
is an urgent international question, a question of the very foremost importance. 
We shall make every effort to have this question solved at last. We sincerely 
strive to find a solution for the German question together with our allies in 
the struggle against Hitler Germany. We consider that along with this the 
question of West Berlin too will be settled on an agreed basis. If, however, 
all our efforts to conclude a peace treaty with the two German states fail 
to be crowned with success after all, the Soviet Union, and other willing states, 
will sign a peace treaty with the GDR with all the consequences proceeding 
from this." (Khrushchev Supreme Soviet speech, January 14, 1900.) 
"But what if we do not meet understanding? Could it be that we should live 
forever without a peace treaty, and forever resign ourselves to an abnormal 
situation in West Berlin? 
"Of course, we cannot reconcile ourselves to such a situation. If the Soviet 
Union does not meet understanding it will have no other recourse but to sign 
a peace treaty with the GDR with all the ensuing consequences, including those 
for West Berlin. That treaty would settle the frontier questions of Germany 
with the Polish People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic. With the 
signing of a peace treaty it would be clear to all that to strive to alter the exist-
ing frontiers means nothing else but to bring matters to a war. We shall not 
abet aggressive forces which cherish the dream of pushing German frontiers

to the east. If some states refuse to sign a peace treaty it will also be clear 
to all what they stand for peace or war, for relaxation of tension and friendly 
relations or for cold IVO r." (Letter to Adeaauer, January 2.i9;0. 
"AP (loiatEseoNntaxT. laid you actually say that you will insist on a 'Western 
withdrawal from West Berlin regardless of the concessions they may make 
to Russia's position on disarmament? Did you make this statement to Presi-
dent Gronehi of Italy? 
"K H RES IICHEV. The question is put in a not too correct way. The Western 
powers are allegedly to make concessions to the Soviet Union on questions 
of safeguarding peace, while we are to make concessions to the West with 
regard to Berlin. This is incorrect. These are two independent questions, 
each of which requires a separate solution. 
"Is it only the Soviet Union and the socialist countries that are interested in 
disarmament, in safeguarding peace? All the peoples are interested in safe-
guarding peace. This is why it is necessary to consider the disarmament ques-
1,ion and solve it in a way beneficial for all countries, for alt the peoples, for 
the cause of peace. 
"The question of West Berlin is entirely different. This is a question whose 
solution has been dragged out for 15 years since the end of the war. How 
much longer can we wait? A summit conference will meet shortly to strengthen 
peace, but: the leftovers of the last war have not been done away with yet. 
This situation contradicts commonsense. This is why we shall strive to wipe 
out the hangovers of war, shall try to convince our allies of the last war to 
sign a peace treaty with the two existing German states. If they fail to under-
stand this need or if they realize it but refuse to agree, then we shall sign a 
peace treaty with the GDR. 
"When a peace treaty with the GDR is signed, all the consequences of the 
war against Germany will 'ease to exist on the territory of the GDR and with 
regard to West Berlin as well. West Berlin is on the territory of the GDR." 
t Djakarta press conference. February 29, 1960.) 
"Question of FRANCE-0nR correspondent MICHEL GORDET. YOU are regarded 
as an advocate of peaceful coexistence and territorial status quo between East 
end West. If this really is so, why do you question the status quo in Berlin 
where the military positions of the Western powers are weak?

stood, we shall unilaterally sign a peace treaty with the GDR. This will settle 
i he problems connected with the liquidation of the remnants of the war le the 
territory of the GDR which will sign the peace treaty with us: the problem 
of liquidating the occupation regime in West Berlin will also be settled.'" 
t'Diplomatic Press Association luncheon in Paris, March 25. 1960.) 
"We are doing and shall continue to do our utmost to achieve understanding 
for our policy and to secure the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. 
repeat, we shall do our utmost to this end. If the Western powers do not 
understand our peace-loving position, we shall have to conclude a peace treaty 
with the GDR." (Rheims luncheon, March 29, 1960.) 
"Fontaine of LE MONDE. Mr. Chairman, you more than once intimated that the 
:-;oviet Union would sign a separate treaty with the GDR if the summit meeting 
did not lead to the conclusion of a German peace treaty. (solid you say more 
precisely to what extent such a treaty would affect the communications between 
ilie Western garrisons in Berlin a ml West Germany? 
"K ii ntruciii,:v. If we do not meet with understanding on the part of the lead-
ers of those countries with which the Soviet Union fought against Hitler Ger-
many, we shall have to conclude a peace treaty with the GDR alone. However, 
ihis is very undesirable for us; we should not like to do so. But if there is no 
other way out, we---a not only we but a number of other countries that fought 
against Nazi Germany- --will be impelled to sign a peace treaty with the GDR 
alone, and all rights arising from the surrender of Nazi Germany would then 
necome invalid on the entire territory under the sovereignty of the GDR. Hence, 
all countries now having garrisons in West Berlin on the basis of the surrender

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
"We shall do everything to solve this question [German peace treaty] on a 
basis acceptable to the Western powers. But if our efforts are fruitless, then 
the Soviet Union will conclude a peace treaty with the GDR. And we are sure 
that all those who understand the necessity of removing the abnormal situation 
in the center of Europe will sign it along with the Soviet Union. 
"We are also convinced that, despite the efforts of Chancellor Aclenauer, the 
Western powers, sooner or later, will arrive at the same conclusion we have. 
Life itself will compel them to understand that the conclusion of a peace treaty 
with the two German states is the only correct solution insuring normal condi-
tions of peace and tranquility in Europe." (Lenin Stadium speech on return 
from France, April 4, 1960.) 
"So that nobody should have any illusions, I would like to state sincerely 
and directly: those who think this, and those who are going to follow such a 
policy, are going to be disappointed. The Soviet Government, for its part, will 
do everything to make our position clear, and will spare no effort to convince 
our partners of the need to conclude a peace treaty and set up a free city in 
West Berlin. But if, in spite of all our efforts, the Western powers show them-
selves unwilling to seek together with the Soviet Union an agreed solution of the 
question of a peace treaty, and, contrary to common sense, ignore this question, 
then we shall of course go our own way and will conclude a peace treaty with 
the German Democratic Republic. 
"I think that the Soviet Union will not be alone in concluding this peace treaty. 
Along with us, it will be signed by many other states which are also convinced 
of the need for a peaceful settlement with Germany. 
"The supporters of an aggressive course where the socialist countries are 
concerned often reason that allegedly even after the signing of a peace treaty with 
the GDR, the three Western powers would retain the right as before to the main-
tenance of their troops in West Berlin. I must say that this is an incorrect 
Interpretation, and a policy which is based on such calculations is doomed 
to failure. 
"It is generally known that the signing of a peace treaty will put an end to 
those conditions which were brought about by the capitulation of the country. 
Therefore, when a peace treaty is signed with the GDR, on the whole territory 
^ Which is controlled by the government of this state, the conditions brought 
about by the surrender will no longer obtain. Thus in relation to this territory, 
the rights which the Western powers obtained as a result of the surrender of 
Hitlerite Germany will also lose effect, including the right to the further main-
tenance of the occupation regime in West Berlin. 
"Some politicians say that they, allegedly, do not recognize the GDR, and 
therefore they do not want to have anything to do with it. It even gets to the 
point where they call for insuring the stay of the troops of the three powers 
In West Berlin, and their rights in relation to that city, as based on the sur-
render and with the aid of force. 
"I must warn such hotheads, that when appeal is not made to right and 
? law, when force is invoked, it is natural that force should be opposed by the 
force of the other side, a force which will rest on law, on right, and will conse-
quently win the moral support of all countries. It cannot be otherwise. 
"Our policy is based on concrete conditions. The Soviet Government is 
guided by the good intentions of liquidating the remnants of World War II, 
of removing the occupation regime in West Berlin, and of giving West Berlin 
the status of a free city. Contrary to the assertions of unscrupulous propaganda 
in the West, nobody intends to encroach upon the freedom, property, and rights 
of the inhabitants of West Berlin. They will be given every opportunity and 
every condition for a free choice of the political and social system they desire. 
"But West Berlin lies within the territory of the GDR, and obviously when 
a peace treaty is signed, the GDR will exercise sovereign rights over its entire 
state territory. If, therefore, the Western powers should not wish to sign a 
peace treaty with the GDR, that would not preserve for them the rights on 
whose preservation they insist. They would then obviously lose the right of 
access to West Berlin by land, water, or air." (Khrushchev speech at meeting 
in Baku, April 25, 1960.) 
U.S. AND WESTERN POLICY

would mean showing weakness in the struggle against these evil forces, against 
these evil spirits. 
"* * I have gained the impression that there are forces in the United States 
which act not in the same direction as the President. These forces want a 
continuation of the cold war and the armaments race. Whether these forces 
are big or small, influential or not influential, whether the forces which support 
the President can win?and he is supported by the absolute majority of the 
U.S. people?are questions to which I would not hasten to give a final answer." 
(Speech in Moscow, upon return from U.S. visit, September 28, 1959.) 
"Some militant American generals are trying to frighten us. They are 
making many speeches with threats against us * * *. 1 have already said many 
times that to make militant speeches in our day, when terrible means of de-
struction have been created, is an extremely dangerous business." (Speech in 
Vladivostok, October 8, 1950.) 
However, the most bellicose leaders in the West cannot in any way give 
up the old methods. Echoes of the past are still heard here and there. Take 
for example the lamentable decision of the U.S. Congress to hold a so-called 
'captive nations week' and to offer prayers for their liberation!' 
"* * * Herter and Assistant Secretary of State Dillon in speeches began 
something in the nature of psychological attack against the Soviet Union, trying 
deliberately to distort the character of relations between our country and China 
* * *. I do not know how it sounds in English, but in Russian attempts of this 
kind may be called 'bovine logic.'" (Speech to Supreme Soviet, October 21, 
1959.) 
Our policy is not a position of strength policy * * *. By the way, I shall 
reveal?and let people abroad know it, I am making no secret of it?that in one 
year 250 rockets with hydrogen warheads came off the assembly line in a factory 
we visited. This represents millions of tons in terms of conventional explosives. 
You can weli imagine that if this lethal weapon Is exploded over some country 
there will be nothing left there at all." (Speech to Soviet journalists, November 
14, 1959.) 
"During our talks in Washington I told Mr. Eisenhower that his position 
differed from mine, of course. I was authorized by the Soviet tiovernment, in 
conformity with the desire of our people, to immediately sign an agreement on 
disarmament * * *. I believe that the President also wants this, but apparently 
he cannot do it because there are still strong quarters in the U.S. that oppose 
disarmament. We must not be deceived in this respect. Yesterday I read Mr. 
Nelson Rockefeller's statement * * *. But Messrs. Imperialists, if you try to 
return to the positions of the cold war, Rockefeller will not save you, just as 
Dulles could not save you." Speech to Soviet journalists, November 14, 1959.) 
"Even now the enemies of socialism are not abandoning their plans for 
smashing the socialist camp and are, of course, looking for the weak links in it. 
They want to rout the socialist countries one by one. We must bear this in mind, 
because it is real, and we must do everything to deprive our enemies of these 
hopes, thwart these hopes." (Speech to Hungarian Party Congress, December 
1,  
'Thirst for profit is pushing some imperialistic circles toward continuing the 
arms race and maintaining the cold war. These circles are sufficiently influential 
to harm the cause of easing international tension in certain conditions. Those 
political leaders who have joined their interests with the policy of the arms race 
are afraid of the easing of international tension and regard it as unthinkable 
that this easing could become a fact * * *. It is clear that the imperialists will 
try again to rally the forces of the advocates of cold war." (Speech to Supreme 
Soviet, January 14, 1960.1

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENL;E 
those aspects of this or that problem which, if attention is focused on them, 
cannot further the search for mutually accepted solutions. It goes without 
saying that such an attitude does not help the search for ways of solving im-
portant international issues. On the contrary, it leads to a maintenance of 
tension and consequently hinders the normalization of relations between states. 
"There is no need to look far to find an example. Let us take a speech, 
recently made by the U.S. under secretary of state, Dillon, and offered as a 
summary of U.S. policy before the summit conference. This speech positively 
smelled of the spirit of the cold war. Dillon's speech reminds us, if anything, 
of a collection of prefabricated arguments, against the USSR and socialist 
countries, rather than of a responsible political statement. He kicked up a 
hullabaloo about the constant communist threat to peace, proposed that the 
conception of peaceful coexistence be thrown overboard, and crassly distorted 
the Soviet proposals on disarmament, the conclusion of a German peace treaty, 
and on West Berlin's transformation into a free city. 
"Dillon tried to introduce a stream of unfriendliness and mistrust on the 
very eve of the summit conference, when it is so important to be consistent, 
to create and support an atmosphere of trust between states. Dillon described 
the summit conference as a check on the sincerity of the intentions of the 
USSR. He tried to make out that the outcome of the conference depends entirely 
on the USSR and not on all the participants. But nobody will succeed in 
undermining the trust in the good will of the USSR, the policy of which is 
clear, is permeated by love of peace and has gained the firm sympathy of the 
peoples. 
"In the eyes of the peoples, the summit conference is truly a serious testing 
of the policies of the states represented at that conference, perhaps, most of 
all, of the policy of the United States itself. The peoples will judge sincerity 
of intention on what each of the four powers brings with it to the conference, 
and what contribution each power is ready to make to the cause of the lessening 
of international tension. 
"But if one goes by the statement of Mr. Dillon, who understandably is not 
an outsider to government circles in the United States, it turns out that the 
U.S. Government is ready to come to an agreement on the disarmament ques-
tion and on the improvement of relations between the states of East and West 
only if its own viewpoint is accepted on the Berlin question. 
"Why did Dillon have to make a statement which is obviously out of harmony 
with the atmosphere established between the Soviet Union and the United 
States after my talks with President Eisenhower at Camp David? Maybe this 
is simply a manifestation of pugnacity by a diplomat who has got it stuck in 
his head that if one attacks the other side before talks begin, the other side 
will become more yielding? One would like to say to Mr. Dillon, and to those 
who may share his opinion, that such methods are most unsuitable in dealing 
with the Soviet Union." ( Speech in Baku, April 25, 1900.) 
TIIE SUMMIT 
"Some in the West claim that the Soviet Union has changed its policy and, 
therefore, it has become easier to talk with us. This is wrong, of course. We 
were born Communists, we live as Communists, and will not die, but will con-
tinue to march onward as Communists." (Khrushchev speech at Soviet journal-
ists' meeting, November 14, 1959 (referring to a de Gaulle statement made at a 
November 10 press conference) .) 
"We have recently reached an agreement * * * on convening a conference 
of heads of government on May 16 in Paris. It is envisaged that this conference 
will be followed by a number of summit meetings. It would be improvident to 
try to guess beforehand the possible results of the forthcoming conference * * * 
(Khrushchev speech to Supreme Soviet, January 14, 1960.) 
"As for the imminent summit meeting * * * naturally we must not think that 
all controversial issues can be regulated in one or two meetings between the 
leaders of Western and Eastern powers." (Khrushchev speech at Paris press 
luncheon, March 25, 1960.)

0010 TS ON WEST DURING ASIAN TOUR 
"Everyone sees how the plans of the reactionary circles of certain Western 
powers which pursued a foreign policy 'from positions of strength' are coming 
to grief. Common sense and the understanding that the policy of 'brinkmanship' 
lS a fatal policy under present conditions are beginning to gain ground. 
"It is known that there are circles in the West who are unwilling to reconcile 
themselves to the beginning of the relaxation of international tension and seek 
to reverse the march of time and revert the world to cold war times. Especially 
dangerous in this respect are the activities of the military blocs of NATO, 
SIIATO, and CENTO, the holding of military maneuvers in various parts of the 
World and the establishment of new bases, including those for nuclear-tipped 
rockets. In this connection it is impossible to overlook the actions of the 
Japanese ruling circles, which are a danger to the cause of peace. 
"The question of peace is the main question of our time. Closely connected 
with it is the question of the abolition of the colonial system. The sooner the 
colonial powers are deprived of their colonies?and the colonialists will then be 
unable to plunder and oppress other nations?the quicker peace on earth will be 
established * * *. 
"In our time, the colonialists cannot act as they did in the past when the 
destinies of people throughout the world were decided in European capitals. 
They are casting about for new ways and means of enslaving countries which 
recently achieved independence * * * 
"Especially dangerous to the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America are 
various forms of collective colonialism. It is impossible not to mention such 
manifestations of colonialism as military-political blocs. 
"Provocations against Indonesia, Cambodia and Laos are but a few of 
the shameful deeds of the SEATO bloc operating in your area." (Speech to 
Indonesian Parliament, 'February 26, 1960.) 
"The struggle for strengthening peace is not an easy job, for still active in 
softie countries are influential forces interested in the continued arms race, 
and in wrecking the prospect now in evidence of a decrease in international 
tmision and in rekindling the cold war. 
"SOIDO of the Western countries are advanced just because those of Asia, 
Africa and Latin America are underdeveloped. It would be only fair for the 
Western nations to repay at least a portion of the looted wealth to the peoples 
whom they held in bondage:" (Khrushehey speech to Indian Parliament, 
February 11, 1900.) 
-Whereas all the peace-loving peoples want a further relaxation of inter-
national tension, the cold and hot war advocates continue galvanizing such 
aggressive blocs as NATO. SEATO and CENT'170." (Khrushchey speech at Civic 
Reception in Delhi, February 12, 1960.) 
The Soviet Union and the West have two different approaches to aid. The 
Soviet Union strives to achieve economic aid which promotes economic inde-
pendence. But some people in the West utilize assistance as ii weapon of new 
colonial policy." (Khrushchey speech at Bhilai, February 1.5, 1960.) 
"t do not think all of you understand when we show bitterness toward colonial-
ists. For some ages you have been oppressed by colonialists, but still you do 
not feel as strongly as we do, though we have never in the strietest sense been 
a colony." (Khrushcbev speech at a dinner in Calcutta, February 15, 1960.) 
"Peace is also sought by the greater part of the peoples of the capitalist 
states in Europe and North America, even in the United States of America 
whose people for long have been influenced by the propaganda of those on the 
side of the cold war, where expressions of agreement with peace are considered 
almost akin to traitoronq acts towards the interest of the state. * * *" Ichru-

underdeveloped countries." (Khrushchev speech to Indonesian parliament,

"[Afro-Asian countries] are important suppliers of raw materials for the 
Western powers. The supporters of aggression understand that when the

gressive plans." (Khrushchev speech to Jogjakarta University, February 22, 
1960.) 
"The capitalist states are guided by the law of their society?no cheating, no 
sales?in other words help the weak today so that tomorrow the weak will again 
come to you for assistance. " * This is not assistance, but striving to hook 
by the ear and drag into slavery, to make one or another country the object 
of exploitation by a state or group of persons." (Khrushchev press conference, 
Djakarta, February 29, 1960.) 
ADDITIONAL KIIEUSIICHEV STATEMENTS 
The following Khrushchev statements all made after his return from the US, 
do not fit easily into the four categories listed above. They serve, however, to 
illustrate his interpretation of "peaceful coexistence," "detente," "capitalism," 
"exchange of ideas," etc. 
"There were very good things [in the US], but we must not forget the bad 
things. This little worm, or, rather, giant worm is still alive, and can display 
Its vitality in the future as well." (Moscow Speech on return from US, September 
28, 1959.) 
"We must realize clearly that the struggle for the consolidation of peace will 
be a long one. Peaceful coexistence must be understood correctly. Coexistence 
means the continuation of the struggle between two social systems, but of a 
struggle by peaceful means, without war, without the interference of one state 
Into the domestic affairs of another state. One should not be afraid. We must 
struggle resolutely and consistently for our ideas, for our way of life, for our 
socialist system. The partisans of capitalism too will not, of course, abandon 
their way of life, their ideology, they will fight. We hold that this struggle must 
be economic, political, and ideological, but not military." (Novosibirsk speech, 
October 10, 1959.) 
"He who does not recognize peaceful coexistence wittingly or unwittingly slips 
down into the positions of the cold war and the armaments race, of deciding 
international problems by force of arms and not by way of peaceful negotiations. 
Hence it is clear that it is essential to tear off the masks from all those who 
wish to embellish the policy of the imperialist state who continue the arms race. 
Things must be called by their names. The aggressive circles of these countries 
are striving to decide disputed international questions by means of war. All the 
pacts and alliances set up by the imperialist states are camouflaged by false 
statements to the effect that they are allegedly defensive, against the threat of 
communism. But such statements are not new and have been repeatedly exposed 
by life itself." (Novosibirsk speech, October 10, 1959.) 
"The supporters of capitalism are trying to put a new coat on the decrepit 
capitalist system, but nothing will come of it; just like a horse, you know, that 
is getting old and is unable to keep its tail up like a young spirited horse. So, 
the moribund capitalist system will not see a new surge of energy." (Vladivostok 
speech, October 8, 1959.) 
"In the course of these talks [during the Khrushchev ITS visit] certain Ameri-
can representatives repeatedly spoke about the so-called free dissemination of 
Ideas. They tried to convince me of the need for wider dissemination in our 
country of books and films especially selected by them, and of the need for free 
broadcasting. They want to foist upon us all kinds of trash that would poison

the minds of Soviet people. Can we agree to this? Of course not. Our people 
do not want to consume bad food poisoned with the venom of bourgeois ideas." 
(Kransoyarsk speech, October 9, 1959.) 
In his October 31, 1959 speech to the Supreme Soviet, Khrushchev assessed 
the relative relaxation of international tension and gave his interpretation of 
the causes for it. These remarks were not directly linked to his US trip, but 
it was clear that this was his intention. 
"Only recently, the foreign policy of some Western powers was built on openly 
aggressive calculations, on the 'positions of strength' policy. The inspirers of 
this policy wanted to impose their will on the peace-loving peoples"--i.e., the 
communist bloc countries. "Sometimes this approach to international affairs 
was styled a 'policy of pushing back' or 'rolling back,' but the essence remained 
the same * * *" The advocates of this policy "meant direct military interven-
tion in the affairs of the socialist and other peaceable states. From this stemmed 
the policy of a continuous arms race, illusory hopes of building up 'nuclear 
supremacy,' etc * * * Now times have changed. Even some of the active 
exponents of the 'position of strength' policy see its futility * * * At the present 
time a more sober evaluation of the situation, a more reasonable understanding 
of the balance of forces on the international scene is gaining ascendancy in the 
West." This "inevitably leads to the conclusion that plans involving the use of 
armed forces against the socialist world should be relegated to oblivion. Life 
itself demands that the states with different social systems should know how 
to * * * coexist peacefully * * * the main reason [for these recent changes] 
lies in the growing might and international influence of the Soviet Union, of all 
countries of the world system of socialism." 
Khrushchev's remarks made clear that Moscow regarded the detente (and 
prospective high-level East-West talks) as a consequence, and not a repudiation 
of its position of strength policy. Furthermore, by claiming that the improved 
international atmosphere was due mainly to the West's accommodation to grow-
ing Soviet power, Khrustichev implied that there would be further improvement 
only if the West made further concessions. 
WHEN WAS DECISION MADE TO SUSPEND OVERFLIGHTS? 
The CHAIRMAN. Proceeding, Mr. Secretary, under our agreed regu-
lations, can you tell the committee when the decision to suspend any 
further flights over Russian territory was taken? 
Secretary HERTER. My impression is that it was taken on the Thurs-
day before the President went to Paris. 
Phe CHAIRMAN. That would be Thursday, is that it, the 12th? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. What were the considerations which led to the 
decision taken on Thursday, the 12th of May, that there should be no 
further flights over the--
Secretary HERTER. Mr. Chairman, I think I answered that in my 
own statement, in Which I said that since the T7-2 system had been 
compromised, it was discontinued as any other intelligence mission 
would be in such a case. 
The CHAIRMAN. It had been compromised sometime before the 12th, 
hadn't it? 
Secretary HERTER. No, sir. 
(Subsequently the Department of State informed the Committee 
that the reporter had misunderstood the Secretary's 'answer to this 
question, which had been "Yes, sir.")

The CHAIRMAN. You would know of it if it had been taken, wouldn't 
you ? 
Secretary HERTER. I am sorry? I couldn't hear the question, Mr. 
Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Was any moratorium on the flights agreed upon 
prior to May 1, to be effective at any time after May 1 ? 
Secretary HERTER. I have heard reports to that effect, but of my 
own knowledge I do not know. 
The CHAIRMAN. Was such a moratorium ever discussed or consid-
ered by anyone in the State Department ? 
Secretary HERTER. Not by Mr. Dillon nor myself. 
The CHAIRMAN. Or anyone? 
Secretary HERTER. I don't know of anyone. 
The CHAIRMAN. Do you know whether the CIA considered such a 
moratorium? 
Secretary HERTER. I do not, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Did Mr. Dulles or anyone else order a suspension 
of flights after the loss of the plane on May 1? 
Secretary HERTER. That, sir, he will be able to testify to. I can't 
tell you as of what date he did that. 
PREVIOUS U-2 FLIGHTS 
The CHAIRMAN. Were any other planes lost on these same ventures 
prior to May 1? 
Secretary HERTER. [Deleted.] Not over Soviet territory. 
The CHAIRMAN. None had been shot down or lost over Soviet 
territory? 
Secretary HERTER. No. 
The CIIAIRMAN. The flight referred to, that Chairman Khrushchev 
referred to on April 9, you were aware of that, were you? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. It was a successful overflight? 
Secretary HERTER. It was. 
DELAY IN ANNOUNCING SUSPENSION OF OVERFLIGHTS 
The CHAIRMAN. If the President decided to suspend the flights 
prior to Monday, May 16, which you stated he did on the 12th., why 
was this announcement delayed until the meeting with Chairman 
Khrushchev on the 16th? 
Secretary HERTER. Because the President reserved that decision to 
make the announcement in Paris. 
The CHAIRMAN. What was the reasoning for doing that? 
Secretary HERTER. I cannot give you the answer, sir. 
EFFECT OF U-2 INCIDENT ON SOVIET WRECKING OF CONFERENCE

man Khrushchev came to the conference determined to wreck it. Do 
you believe that the U--2 incident contributed to this determination

The 01AIRMAN. You have said that Chairman Khrushchev came

as I tried to explain in my statement. 
The CHAIRMAN. Do you think  
DELAY IN A NNOLNCING SUSPENSION OF OVERFLIGHTS 
Secretary HERTER. Mr. Chairman, might I for a Rio-meat go back 
to the previous question you had asked as to the President's delay in 
announcing the suspension of the flights? 
You may recall that he at the summit or at the so-called meeting 
in Paris coupled that with the offer of bringing into the United Na-
tions a proposal for general overflight program superintended by the 
United Nations and wanted to couple those two things together. 
WHY DIDN'T PRESIDENT DISCLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR II-2 FLIGHT? 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, why do you think Chairman Khru-
slichev left, a way out for the President by suggesting in one of his 
earlier statements that he believed the President did not know about 
these flights? 
Secretary HERTER. I can there, of course, only speculate that he 
had committed himself very strongly in Russia with regard to his 
friendship for the President, and wished to in that way continue the ,oek? 
possibility of the President disclaiming any responsibility for the 
flight. 
The CHAIRMAN. What was the reason for not accepting this way 
out on our part? Why didn't we accept that suggestion? 
Secretary HERTER. Mr. Chairman, that was a question, as you know, 
of judgment. 
The CHAIRMAN. That was what? 
Secretary HERTER. It was a question of judgment. As to when the 
essential facts had been revealed by the capture of the pilot and the 
plane with all its instrumentation intact, the U.S. Government should 
admit the fact that this overflight had taken place, that it was an intel-
ligence overflight, and that decision was made, of course, by the 
President himself. 
QUESTION OF WISDOM OF THE HEAD OF A STATE ASSUMING RESVONSIBILITY 
FOR ESPIONAGE 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, you are a longtime devotee of in-
ternational relations and thoroughly familiar with precedents in this 
field. Is the public assumption of responsibility for espionage by the 
head of a state the usual and customary practice among nations? 
Secretary HERTER. No; the general practice has been. I think, for a 
long period of time to deny any responsibility whatever. 
The CHAIRMAN. Do you know of any precedent in our history or in 
the history of any great nation in which the head of state has assumed 
personal responsibility for espionage activities?

Secretary HERTER. No; I do not know of any firsthand. It may be 
that there have been some. On the other hand, I would point out, 
Mr. Chairman, that this particular incident was of a very unusual 
nature. 
The CnnirimAN. As a general policy, do you believe it is wise for 
the head of state to assume responsibility for espionage activities? 
Secretary HERTER. Well, very frankly, I don't think it makes a 
great deal of difference from the public point of view. 
On the other hand I believe in a case of this kind the telling of the 
truth was the better course than getting deeper into fabricating 
excuses or disavowing responsibility. 
CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO PRESIDENT'S ASSUMPTION OF RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR ESPIONAGE 
The CHAIRMAN. What precisely were the reasons that persuaded 
you to depart from precedent in this case? What were the unusual 
circumstances you referred to? 
Secretary HERTER. The unusual circumstances were the facts that 
the materiel and the statement of the pilot, not every bit of which was 
accurate, but a great part of which was accurate, had been revealed, 
and could have been presented to impartial tribunals for examination. 
Under those circumstances, which was very different from the 
ordinary espionage case I think it would have become extremely 
evident and was extremely evident that this incident had taken place. 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, in our spy cases, isn't it a fact that the 
evidence of the particular person being a spy, of some of those we had, 
was not in question. The difference is in whether or not the head of 
state takes responsibility for it, not that it was convincingly evident 
he was a spy. Isn't that the difference? 
Secretary HERTER. That is a difference. 
The CHAIRMAN. We often catch a spy. We have ourselves, it has 
been related, and there is no doubt he is a spy with all the. parapher-
nalia which usually accompanies a spy, but the point I thought that 
would be very interesting to the committee to know is why in this 
particular case, in spite of the convincing nature of the evidence: that 
he was a spy, that the President. and the head of state should assume 
responsibility for it. 
Secretary HERTER. The first was that it was obvious from the facts 
as to .what had occurred., Second was that the situation which had 
led to this entire activity was the one which is probably disturbing 
the peace of the world the most, and leads to the greatest tensions 
in the world; namely the danger of surprise attack, and ther.:secrecy 
behind the Soviet Union. 
SOVIET DELETION IN MAGAZINE OF REFERENCES TO PRESIDENT'S EXPECTED 
VISIT TO RUSSIA 
The CHAIRMAN. Was it not after the President said that he did 
know and took full responsibility for these flights that Gil:urinal:1 
Khrushchev became completely intransigent and wrecked the confer-

28 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Secretary HERTER. That is very difficult to determine. If I may, I 
would like to cite at this point just one piece of evidence that I 
mentioned yesterday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
On May 6 the Soviet Embassy in Washington, before any statement 
had been made accepting any degree of responsibility, before the 
President had made any statement, this was on May 6, canceled from 
the magazine which is published in the United States similar to the 
magazine which is published by the United States in Russia., called 
the U.S.S.R., stopped it press run of that magazine and took out of 
it Al references to the coming visit of the President to Soviet Russia. 
The magazine had in it a welcome to the President in his visit to 
Russia, pictures of the places that he was going to, and a good many 
photographs indicating what a great success his visit was going to 
be. That was canceled and taken out of the magazine entirely. 
The CHAIRIVIAN. My time is up. Senator Green. I recognize you 
for 10 minutes. 
EXECUTIVE COORDINATION ON IT--2 INCIDENT 
Senator GREEN. May I ask a few more questions about the same 
matter because I do not understand, and perhaps it is my fault, how 
far the President acted alone, and how far the State :Department 
acted alone before they came together and agreed on the situation ? 
Secretary HERTER. Well, I would say that there was consultation 
right through this period. 
Senator GREEN. I didn't understand. 
Secretary HERTER. I would say there was consultation right through 
in this period. May I make this observation, Mr. Chairman? From 
the point of view of :firsthand knowledge on these matters, asked 
Mr. Dillon to come up with me because until May 6, I was out of the 
United States. He was acting Secretary of State and some of the 
questions that may be directed to that period when I was out of the 
country he can answer from firsthand information, whereas I would 
have to do it only from secondhand information. 
The CHAIRMAN. We would be very glad to have Mr. Dillon sup-
plement the statement whenever you would like. 
Senator GREEN. Mr. Dillon, then will you take up the answer to 
my question ? 
Mr. DtmoN. I can say is that in the period that I had responsi-
bility: we were in contact regularly with the President with full 
coordination. 
Senator GREEN. Well, the division of authority seems to have re-
sulted in a great many understandings which have been spread well 
in the press, and the people are anxious to be informed on how it 
happened; what was the lack in organization or otherwise that was 
responsible. If you an explain it, I would be glad to have you do so. 
ISSUANCE OF COVER STORY ON OVERFLIGHT 
Mr. PritoN. If it would be helpful, I will be glad to explain 
briefly the course of events in the few days after the plane was 
missing.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
We first received news that this plane was missing, was overdue 
at its home base on Sunday, which was the day that the Soviet Union 
later said the plane was shot down. 
At that time, it was determined that a cover story would be used 
as was stated by the President the other night, which had been pre-
viously preparea for such instance. 
There was full coordination on this. I knew that the cover story 
was to be issued and it was discussed that it would be issued as usual 
when a plane was lost at the base from which the plane was lost. 
There would be no statement from Washington, and this information 
was given to the people who would be in charge of the flight at the 
base where it flew from in Turkey. [Deleted.] In due course, the 
statement was put out there that a plane was missing. The general 
content of that statement by the base commander at Adana at Tur-
key was that a U-2 aircraft on the weather mission originating at 
Adana, Turkey, was missing; that the purpose of the plane's flight 
had been a study of clear air turbulence; that during the flight in 
southeast Turkey the pilot reported he had oxygen difficulties; that 
the last word heard from MDB at 7 o'clock Greenwich time; that 
the aircraft did not land at Adana, as planned; and that it could only 
be assumed that it was now down. 
A search effort, he said, was underway in the Lake Van area and 
that the pilot's name was being withheld pending notification of the 
next of kin. 
After that statement was made no further action was taken here 
because we did not know the circumstances of how the plane had been 
lost, where it had been lost, whether it had been actually lost over 
Soviet territory or not, although the presumption was that it had 
been lost over Soviet territory, because that was apparently where it 
was going to be the greater part of the time in the flight. 
EVENTS LEADING TO STATE DEPARTMENT MAY 5 STATEMENT ON MISSING 
PLANE 
The next incident occurred on the morning of Thursday, the 5th 
of May when we heard of the first speech by Mr. Khruslichey in 
which it was stated that they had shot down a plane. They didn't 
say where the plane had been shot down, but they said that an Ameri-
can plane was shot down. This required action and statements on 
our part. The news of that was received by me during the course of 
a meeting, a regular meeting of the National Security Council which 
was being held that day as you will remember, somewhere out of 
Washington, as a part of a civil defense exorcise. 
A series of civil defense exercises were underway at that time which 
had been long scheduled. When we heard that news, it was decided 
that the State Department would handle all questions regarding it 
and taking part in the discussion at that time, present at that time 
were myself, Secretary Gates, and Mr. Allen Dulles. So we were all 
three aware of this decision. 
Meanwhile, back in Washington, members of the State Department 
were meeting with members of the Central Intelligence Agency to 
try and work out a proper statement. 
As soon as we returned to Washington, that statement was finalized 
in agreement with the Central Intelligence Agency and the White

30 EVENTS INCIDI,NT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
'louse was obviously kept informed of the contents of the statement, 
and the statement was then put out at 12:45 in the State Department. 
The text of that statement was this: 
The Department has been informed by NASA that as announced May 3 an 
unarmed plane, a U-2 weather research plane based at Adana, Turkey, piloted 
by a civilian has been missing since May I. During the flight of this plane, Om 
pilot reported difficulty with his oxygen equipment. Mr. Khru.shebev has an-
nounced that a U.S. plane has been shot dawn over the U.S.S.R. on that date. 
It may be that this was the missing plane. It is entirely possible that having 
a failure in the oxygen equipment which could result in the pilot losing con-
sciousness, the plane continued on automatic pilot for a considerable distance and 
accidentally violated Soviet airspace. The United States is taking this matter 
up with the Soviet Government, with particular reference to the fate of the 
pilot. 
PREPARATION OF GUIDELINES ON MISSING PIA NE 
Meanwhile, prior in that, in the days immediately before hat, there 
had also been conversations between t he State Department and the 
Central Intelligence Agency regarding information that might be 
given to NASA in case tliere were further questions of them in Wash-
ington, for confirmation of statements regarding where the plane 
was down, something of fiat, nature. 
General guidelines on this were prepared. This was prior to the 
5th, in the period of the 2d and 4th, and these, I understand, were 
transmitted to NASA by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
The State Department, at no time worked directly with NASA on 
any of this publicity or anything regarding these flights. 
Senator GORE. Did you say did, or did not? 
Mr. DILLON. Did not. This is part of the cover operation. 
[Deleted.] 
N ASA STATEMENT OF MAY 5 
So then the next item on this was that shortly after this statement, 
NASA was asked a lot of questions about the plane, and they, follow-
ing the cover story that had been prepared earlier, put out the state-
ment which appeared in the press that same day. f think that clone 
out about three-quarters of an hour after our statement. They ap-
parently utilized the general guidelines which they liad been given, 
to answer questions and put them toget her into a statement, which was 
then put out. 
Senator Mime] tarv. What was the date of that? 
Mr. Dit,no.N. This was done on May 5. This was right after Mr. 
Khruslichev.,s first speech_ in which he said a 1)1 am; was down some-
where and this was-----p-al will recall also at that time the Soviets 
printed a photograph of a plane that was supposedly a wreck and we 
very rapidly learned, I would say within 24 hours, that this photo-
graph was a fraudulent photograph and was not a photograph of the 
17-2 wreckage, but was a photograph of some Soviet type plane.

Senator GREEN. I would like to have the witness proceed and finish 
his statement. 
Mr. DILLON. Yes; could I finish this statement? 
EVENTS LEADING UP TO STATE DEPARTMENT STATEMENT OF MAY 7 
Almost immediately, I would say on Friday the 6th, we were aware 
that this was a fraudulent picture, and so that gave us some concern 
that the Soviets might have a greater knowledge regarding the air-
craft than we had previously suspected, and that maybe they had in 
their possession more of the aircraft and possibly had the pilot in 
their possession. So this was then followed on Saturday morning, the 
7th by Khrushchev's speech in which he stated that they did have 
the pilot, and gave for the first time actual information as to where it 
was shot down and so forth. 
The Secretary returned to Washington on the afternoon of Friday, 
May 6, from Istanbul and Greece, and I reported to him on the situa-
tion as of that time, and at that time he naturally took over. There-
fore, on Saturday morning, we met with him to determine what to do 
next, and at that moment as we met, we were faced with this new 
Soviet statement saying that they had the pilot, and a new situation 
had arisen, and his action at that time the Secretary has explained. 
But that was when the decision was made to reveal the fact that this 
was an American plane. 
Senator GREEN. If I understand you correctly  
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator has run considerably over his time. 
Senator GREEN. May I ask one more question? 
The CHAIRMAN. We, are under a time limitation. 
Senator GREEN. I thank you for what you have said. As I under-
stand it, your explanation is that too many cooks spoil the broth. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Wisconsin. 
TIMING OF SOVIET DECISION TO WRECK CONFERENCE 
Senator WILEY. I want to congratulate you, gentlemen. 
It seems to me that the facts as developed this morning, plus the 
President's address, give us what we have practically all known from 
the newspapers as descriptive of this situation. I want to ask just a 
few questions, Mr. Secretary. 
In your opinion, do you think that when Khrushchev went to Paris 
he had already made up his mind to blow up the conference? 
Secretary HERTER. I do, sir, and I think that the bulk of the evi-
dence indicates that he was under instructions to do so. 
Senator WILEY. In your opinion, is the matter of using what we 
have used in the past, the U-2's, for a mere period of years, all in 
the interest of preserving the integrity of the United States and the 
integrity of the West? 
Secretary HERTER. I do indeed. 
Senator WILEY. And, in your opinion, if the U-2 incident hadn't 
happened?this is sort of a duplication of the question but I want to 
get to the main question?would Khrushchev have had an adequate 
excuse or would he have drummed up ono? 
Secretary HERTER. That can only be a matter of speculation. I 
think that Mr. Khrushchev, as indicated by his Baku speech, felt

that from his point of view the summit would not, turn out satis-
factorily, and that the incident, was a convenient handle, for him 
to use to torpedo the conference. 
SOV1 ET KNOWLEDGE OF 13-2 OVERFLIGHTS 
Senator WILE-v. Isn't it a fact that from his remarks that he made 
in his talk in Berlin he knew that we were using what has been 
called spy planes, and had been using the same for some time? 
Secretary HERTte. It certainly does, and that was repeated yester-
day by Mr. Gromyko in the statement that he made at the iInited 
Nations in which he said they had known of this for some time, that 
they had known of it at the time that Mr. Khrushchey was at Camp 
David. [Deleted,j1 
PRIOR EXPECTATIONS OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS AT SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Senator Waxy. Then because of previous conferences, as you have 
outlined in your remarks, it is very clear that there was no real 
reason to think that a conference could have accomplished anything, 
because isn't it a fuJ, that both parties were adamant? 
Secretary HERrea. That is true, sir, insofar as Berlin and the 
German situation was concerned. It might have been possible to 
work out some interim agreement for Berlin. I am rather doubtful 
whether it would have been. There was some hope that in the field 
of disarmament, the East and the West could have agreed on direc-
tives to those who were negotiating in Geneva to get down to specific 
disarmament measures to make a start, and to break away front the 
deadlock that had occurred over pure generalities. That is a hope 
that we had, that something of that kind might come out, of the Paris 
conference. But, as you may recall, in our public statements we had 
made it very clear that people should not expect, not have too grew: 
hopes of what might conic out of it. But as the President has himself 
said, ho had hoped perhaps from this and perhaps from succeeding 
summit conferences there might be some easing of the overall at-
mosphere, which in time would lead to a solution of some of these 
problem s. 
KI IRV'S H S'1' A '1'EATE N T ON A FUTURE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Senator WI:LEI-. What do you think is the reason that if Khrushche,v 
was as heated up as he claims he was, that he said in 6 or 8 months 
there AVORld be another opportunity for a conference? 
Secretary HEirtre. I think with the admonition that we have been 
given earlier in the day with regard to not bringing political matters 
into this discussion, the inference would have to be drawn by each 
individual for himself on that. 
PRESID}INT'S SPEECH OF MAT 25 
Senator Wit,Ey. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to take more time

fact that we are asking ourselves certain questions about, let us say, 
where do we go from here, and that is my last question, I ask that 
this be incorporated in the minutes of this meeting. 
The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
(The speech referred to appears on p. 249 of appendix 1.) 
FUTURE U.S. RELATIONS WITII TIIE SOVIET UNION 
Senator WILEY. Now where do We go from here? 
Secretary HERTER. Sir, I tried to indicate that in the last part of 
my statement. As the President has said, we hope to continue to do 
business on a businesslike basis with the Soviet Government. We 
intend to continue with the negotiations that are now underway. We 
intend to continue with our exchange agreements. One thing [might 
put in the record at this point. From such information as we have 
received from our embassies in Moscow, and from our missions in 
other Soviet bloc countries, the attitude toward our people has re-
mained unchanged. There has been no indication of hostility on a 
people to people basis that has been evidenced in any way from what 
happened in Paris. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Minnesota. 
SOVIET FEAR OF SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO WEST GERMANY 
Senator Huirtrimyr. Mr. Secretary, on page 4 of your statement, 
you indicate under the subtitle "Summit Prospects Dimmed," a series 
of developments that you believe indicated a change in the position or 
a possibility of a change in the position of the Soviet representatives, 
particularly Mr. Khrushchev, about the summit. 
In the third paragraph you say "But clouds began to gather even 
then," referring to some developments in the Soviet Union. 
If you will recall that period, isn't this about the same time that 
the United States was considering offering nuclear weapons again to 
West Germany? 
Secretary HERTER. I can't recall that we have ever done that. 
Senator HowtriiRET. Well, there has been considerable talk about 
the offering of nuclear weapons to our allies. 
Secretary HERTER. We have not been offering them to our allies  
Senator HUMPHREY. I know you have not been offering them. 
Secretary HERTER. Under the law we cannot do that. 
Senator HUMPHREY. I understand that. There has been consider-
able discussion here in the United States of changing the law and 
offering weapons to our NATO allies. 
Secretary HERTER. There may have been discussions on that subject, 
Senator, but we never made any specific proposal on that point. 
Senator HUMPHREY. Are you denying there has been any discussion 
of it, Mr. Secretary? 
Secretary HERTER. Oh, no; I said there was some discussion. 
Senator HUMPHREY In official circles. 
Secretary HERTER. We have never made any specific proposals of 
any kind. 
Senator HumritanY. There was enough talk about it so that resolu-
tions have been introduced into the Congress, and the House of Repre-
sentatives, as you know, to make sure that this didn't happen.

My question rehttes to this: Is there not a, great fear in the Soviet: 
Union of the possibility of the spread of nuclear weapons to Western 
Germany? 
Secretary tharEn. I think that is true. I am not sure that it is con-
fined to Western Germany. I think that it applies to I he spread of 
nuclear weapons in other nations and it might well include Commnnist. 
China. 
Senator HUMPHui Ir. Yes; indeed. 
PROPA GANDA NATURE OF KHRUSIIC 1-1[EV'S STATEMENTS PRIWEIBNG 
SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Is it not possible that during this period of the dimming of the 
summit prospects that you referred to that you are saying here was a 
little counteroffensive on the propaganda level by the Soviet.? 
Secretary II.EarEa. Yes; that is possible. On the Other hand, may 
I say this: The summit conference itself was not agreed upon until 
December after the President, Nfessrs. Macmillan, de Gaulle, and 
Adenauer had met in Paris and a note was sent to the Soviet Govern-
ment suggesting that. a summit conference be held and the date was 
not agreed upon until later than that, the date of May 16. 
Senator Ifirmvunny. Mr. Secretary, I want it quite, clear 1 happen 
to believe, RS you indicated, that the Soviets made up their minds to 
scuttle this conference in light of certain developments, such as the 
visit of Mr. Khrushchey to President de Gaulle; and when be found 
out that the Americans, the French, and the British were not going 
to back out on Berlin, and were not going to agree to a separate 
settlement in Germany, I think that Mr. Khrushchey did come to 
the conclusion, as you have indicated, that the summit conference 
could not be a success and therefore, he wanted to get out of it. 
But the point that. I am raising in light of your staternent is, would 
we not expect Mr. Khrushchey to blast off, so to speak, on such subjects 
as Berlin and a separate treaty with Germany? Isn't this and hasn't 
this been a part of his general line for a considerable period of time.? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes; it. is not confined to Mr. Khrushchey. It 
has been almost a standard technique, before any conference, to take 
a very adamant position before the conference. 
Senator HUMPIIREY. Yes. 
Well, I only bring this up because while I recognize, there was evi-
dence of what you say, possibly a shift of opinion in the Kremlin, 
there was always a reason for this and there may very well have been 
the reason that the Soviet leaders constantly want to wage the 
propaganda, war on this nuclear-weapons distribution inoblem.

I will be glad. to submit this record which includes not only the state-

DEFENSE DEPARTMENT'S NEWS RELEASE OF MAY 5 
Senator HUMPHREY. Did the Department of Defense give out a 
release before you did; that is, the State Department? 
Mr. DILLON. The Department of Defense's news release was really 
only confirmation and repetition of the release that had been given 
out by the airbase commander at Adana, Turkey, and added nothing 
to that. It merely repeated that that was accurate and that was the 
one that is in this document. 
WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR 11-2 FLIGHTS? 
Senator HU1VIPHREY. Mr. Secretary, what agency or who is the per-
son in, the official in, this Government, who is in charge of these flights, 
such as the IJ-2flights? 
Secretary HERTER. The Central Intelligence Agency. 
Senator Hummanv. Do you have constant information, do you have 
continuing information, in the State Department, as to the number 
of these flights, the course of these flights, the purpose of these flights? 
Secretary HERTER. The general programs had been gone over with 
the Department. Obviously it is impossible to tell when these flights 
are going to take place because they are so dependent on the season 
of the year and on weather conditions. 
The _Agency has to plan numbers of alternatives so we never know 
at any particular time or any particular flight. But the general ap-
proval of the program had been received from the State Department, 
of course, as one of the advisers to the President in this matter. 
Senator Huminumy. Did you know of this specific flight ahead of 
time? 
Secretary HERTER. I did not; no. I didn't know it was in the air 
even when I was overseas nor do I think any of us did until it came 
down. 
Senator HUMPHREY. Is that your understanding, Mr. Dillon? 
Mr. DILLON. I was not aware that it was in the air until I was 
informed that it was?it was overdue as I stated previously. 
WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR COVER STORY? 
Senator IffixtrtniEv. When something goes wrong on one of these 
flights, who is responsible for giving the cover story, the coverup 
story, so to speak? 
Mr. DILLON. Central Intelligence Agency, but we are also responsi-
ble for agreeing with them that this is a reasonable story, and it is 
proper in the circumstances, but they have the responsibility for 
executing it.

POSSIBILITY OF UNIDENIIFIED AIRCRAFT FLYING OVER THE UNITED STATES 
Senator HUMP) IREY. Mr. Secretary, what do you think would hap-
pen in the United States if on our radar screen we should discover 
a plane flying at high altitude over our territory in this age of the 
fear of surprise attack? 
Secretary HERTER. I think we would do everything we could do to 
identify it right away. 
Senator HUMPHREY. Just identify it? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, identify it. We have the wherewithal, I 
think to do that,. 
Senator HUMPH CY. In other words, would we dispatch inter-
ceptors? 
Secretary HERTER. I think so. 
Senator HUMPHREY. What would be our view of such a flight? 
Secretary HERTER. Certainly there is very little that such a flight 
could 'ascertain that would worry us much. Every bit of information 
that, we have got in this country seems to be available through public 
means to anyone who wishes to collect documents. In fact in the 
whole Russian espionage system they have collected maps, documents, 
and photographs of every part of the I Tnited States. 
Senator HUMPHREY. I realize this, but in light of the danger of 
surprise attack this is what .11 am getting at. This is a, little different, 
may I say, from a spy working in the railroad yard or taking photo-
graphs or even a submarine off our coast even though this gets to be 
a little serious, too. But in the light of danger of surprise attack 
by air power,
there is some difference, is there not? 
Secretary HERTER. There is some difference. On the other hand I 
think we could identify it very quickly. This is the type of plane 
that no one could possibly mistake for a bomber when you get close 
enough to look at it. This is entirely an Unarmed glider type of 
plane. 
? , 
Senator HumeintEv. Have we ever shot down any Soviet planes 
over American territory or over any friendly territory' in which we 
have bases or alliances? 
Secretary HERTER Not that I am aware of. 
Senator Humphrey. Have we ever intercepted any Soviet planes, 
in Korea, for example? 
Secretary HERTER. I think we have been able to identify them from 
time to time. Whether we could say that they were deliberate espio-
nage planes or whether they wandered over the line from the border 
or not. I can't tell you. 
Senator HUMPHREY. Have we ever shot any down? 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator's time is up. 
Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Iowa. 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 17-2 AFRPLANE 
Senator HicKENEoorEn. Mr. Secretary, we hear a great many state-
ments about this plane being shot down. What is the best evidence 
on that? Was it shot down from its maximum height or did they 
consider that it had a flameout at that height and then came down 
to a lower altitude or what?

Secretary HERTER. Senator, there has been a good deal of specu-
lation on that point. I think that we are very skeptical as to whether 
it was shot down from a very high altitude. [Deleted.] 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. Well, I think there is considerable differ-
ence in a situation where this plane might have been shot down at 
60,000 Or 70,000 feet, or whether it was shot down or shot at at 5,000 
or 7,000 feet. 
Secretary HERTER. We are very skeptical and there are certain 
evidences that it was not shot down from that altitude. [Deleted.] 
SOVIET KNOWLEDGE OF U-2 OVERFLIGHTS 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. Now, I think it has been quite well-estab-
lished from Mr. Khrushchev's statements, that the Russians were 
aware for some time in the past that flights of this kind had gone 
over their territory. 
I say I think it is quite evident that Mr. Khrushchev was aware or 
the Russians were aware that flights of this kind had gone on over 
their territory. At least they claim they were. Did they ever file a 
protest with the U.S. Government? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, but not with respect to this type of flight. 
WILL THE UNITED STATES BE PERMITTED TO INTERVIEW THE PILOT? 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. I understand that we have requested in 
Moscow that representatives of this Government be permitted to inter-
view the pilot. Have we had any replies from those requests? 
Secretary HERTER. As yet they have not given us that permission. 
They have said that "When we have finished interrogating him we 
will give consideration to it." 
HEALTH AND PLACE OF IMPRISONMENT OF PILOT 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. Do we have a reasonable idea as to where 
he is being held? 
Secretary HERTER. That I can't tell you. We have been assured 
that he is in good health, and beyond that I can't tell you whether we 
know where he is held or not. Perhaps one of my colleagues knows 
that. I don't think we have any information on that. 
DEFENSIVE VALUE TO UNITED STATES OF U-2 OVERFLIGHTS 
Senator HIGKENLOOPER. Would you care to give an opinion on the 
value to this country, in our defensive posture, of these flights, this 
series of flights which have gone on over Russian territory for the last 
several years ? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, sir, I will give you this opinion. It is a 
layman's opinion rather than an expert's opinion, but I think they 
were of very great value to us. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. Isn't it a fact that these flights have en-
abled us, through the knowledge that we have acquired, to reorient our 
defensive posture and our equipment and attitudes from time to time 
because we have been able to find out exactly, in many instances, what 
the Russians were apparently doing or proposing to do by way of 
armaments and weapons and installations?

EFFECT OF SO VI ET INABILITY TO STOP U-2 FLIGHTS 
Senator HICKENLOO PER. Mr. Secretary, have you had any opportu-
nity to get a reliable cross section reading on what other nations of the 
world think about the vulnerability of Russian defenses; in other 
words, on the theory that perhaps a part of Mr. Khrushclutv's and the 
Krendin's infuriation about this matter is an exposition to the world 
that they knew about these flights and that they could not stop them 
from going over the Russian territory with any consistency? 
Secretary HERTER. _I think that undoubtedly that played a con-
siderable part in his own state of mind with regard to the whole 
incident, the feeling of frustration that they had not been able to stop 
these during a period of 4 years. 
Senator FITuKENL00PER. And that that exposure to the Russian 
people and to many other nations of the world that had been 
propagandized perhaps into thinking that the Russians were in-
vulnerable may very well have had some effect on the attitudes within 
the Kremlin ? 
Secretary HERTER. It may well have had very real effects. 
Senator lIfoxENnoorEit. I think that is all, Mr. Chairman. 
Thank you.

DOES RI HAVE A LAND-Al It MISSILE? 
Senator MORSE. Mr. Secretary, do our experts believe that Russia 
has a land-air missile? 
Secretary URETER. 1 think you are having both the Secretary of 
.Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency that can testify to that 
better than I could. 
Senator MORSE. Have they ever informed you as to what their 
opinion is as to whether or not Russia has a land-air missile? 
Secretary HERTER. We, I think, assume that they do. 
Senator MORSE. We assume that they do. Is it on the basis of that 
assumption that they have been asking Congress for some time for 
a speedup in our land-air missile program, because of the asstunption 
that Russia may have one? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, sir. I am being purposely cautious for 
security reasons as you understand. 
Senator MoRsE. I understand. 
Secretary HERTER. And possibly in executive session when you have 
talked to Mr. Dulles you could get further information on that point. 
Senator MORSE. And yet, 1 think from the standpoint of our own 
security, it is rather important that we have some information as to 
the possibility, on the line of Senator Hickenlooper's question, the 
possibility of whether or not this was shot down by a land-air missile.

Gromyko. 
Senator MoRsE. When? 
Secretary HERTER. Mr. KhrGSilelleV made it a number of times. 
He did so in his statements in Paris. He did so, I think, in his state-
ments that he made to the Central Committee of the Presidium in 
Moscow before he left. 
Mr. Gromyko made that statement again yesterday. 
RIGHTS OVER CAPTURE OF SPIES 
Senator MORSE. What international law rights do we have, Mr. 
Secretary, over capture of American spies by foreign governments? 
Secretary HERTER. Excuse me, sir? 
Senator MORSE. I repeat it. What international law rights do we 
have over American spies that have been captured by a foreign 
government? 
Secretary HERTER. We have no rights over them that are in con-
travention of domestic law. We have no international right. 
Senator MORSE. Therefore, Russia is under no international law 
requirement to make this American spy accessible to American Gov-
ernment officials in Moscow. 
Secretary HERTER. I do not think SO. 
COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA ON THE 11-2 OVERFLIGHTS 
Senator MORSE. Mr. Secretary, do you think the public knowledge 
now of these American spy plane flights over Russia has played into 
the hands of Communist propaganda with the Russian people them-
selves by increasing the fear, no matter how unfounded we know it 
is, the fear of the Russian people that our real objective is to make 
war against Russia? 
Secretary HERTER. I think that the Russian Government will do 
its very best to work along that line in its propaganda. 
As I said earlier, the evidence we have so far is that the attitude 
of the Russian people toward our officials, whether in Moscow or in 
our missions in the Soviet bloc countries, has shown no change.

Secretary HERTEL What the situation may be at the time of the 
General Assembly meeting is a matter of speculation. The fact_ thn'-, 
as I indicated in my prepared statement, he had gone through_ th is 
extraordinary press conference in Paris using very extreme language, 
but that he did not make any threats of any specific action; that he 
then went to East Berlin and called off a mass meeting there, and 
only invited people to a meeting on the following day and then made 
a statement with -regard to the Berlin situation indicating that there 
would be no action taken for sonic time, may well indicate that his 
position on specific things has not changed. However, only time will

Senator MoasE. To what extent, if any, do you think Red China 
has put pressure on the Russian leaders to follow this adamant 
course of action? 
Secretary HERTER. That again, sir, is a matter of speculation. 
Senator MORSE. You have no evidence?

Star magazine, which is their official publication, have been of such 
a highly critical nature of the whole policy of so-called peaceful co-
existence, the whole detente policy that Mr. Khrushchev seemed to 
have been following, t hat they may well have had a considerable 
influence. 
RED CHINA'S MILITARY ACTIVITIES 
Senator MoRsE. Do you have any reason to believe that we may be 
confronted with a diversionary movement now in Asia by Red China 
stepping up military tie iv ities in Asia seeking to embarrass us? 
Secretary Hmeriaz. I think we should be very alert to that.

EFFORTS TO INTERVIEW PILOT 
Senator AIKEN. Mr. Secretary, one of the missing links in that

Has every effort been_ made on our part to see the pilot of the IT-2

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENcE 
SOVIET PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE 
Senator AIKEN. But Mr. Khrushchev very evidently, very obvi-
ously, undertook to substantiate his first statement with a false photo-
graph, and then, as I understand it, he later showed another fake 
photograph to the Russians, claiming that was taken from films de-
veloped from the camera in the 11-2 plane. 
Secretary HERTER. I am not quite so sure that second one was a fake. 
Senator AIKEN. You are not so sure?well, I am not referring to 
the supposed remains of the 11-2, but to the photograph of the planes 
lined up on the ground and claimed to be photographs of Russian 
planes. 
Secretary HERTER. Even so, that could have been a genuine develop-
ment of film from the plane. 
Senator Ara-PN All right. 
PREVIOUS RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS TO DOWN A U-2 PLANE 
Isn't it a fact that the Russians had previously undertaken to se-
cure a 11-2, both by interceptors and rockets? 
Secretary HERTER. I can't tell you about that. 
Senator AIKEN. Don't you know anything about that, or don't you 
want to talk ? 
Secretary HERTER. I can't tell you about rockets. I think there 
probably have been occasions when they might have tried by inter-
ceptor planes, but they couldn't reach that altitude. 
UNLIKELIHOOD THAT U-2 WAS BROUGHT DOWN BY A ROCKET 
Senator AIKEN Than you have no comment to make about an un-
dertaking to get one by rockets? 
Secretary HERTER. No, I think I can point out one bit of evidence 
that perhaps will be supplemented when Mr. Dulles testifies here, 
and that is that the picture of what seemed to be the genuine 11-2 
plane had bullet holes in the wings and they are not likely to have 
bullet holes from any rocket. 
Senator AIKEN. No. 
Does it seem unlikely to you that the 17-2 was brought down with 
a one-shot rocket? 
Secretary HERTER. It seems to HS Very unlikely. 
Senator .AIKEN. Leaving the pilot and much of the equipment intact 
as has been claimed? 
Secretary HERTER. It seems to us very unlikely. 
Senator AIKEN. Wasn't the list of equipment which was given out 
by Mr. Khrushchev such equipment as would have been naturally 
carried on any plane that was undertaking to secure information of 
this type? 
Secretary HERTER. That is right. 
Senator AIKEN. Of any country? 
Secretary HERTER. That is correct.

spot so untenable, that he found it virtually neces,...sary to senate the

Secretary linatrEtz. That, of course, again is a matter of specula-
tion. He had committed himself so strongly on these subjects that 
certainly under cireturtstances in most free countries, if the chief 
executive had committed himself to that, extent it would have been 
very hard for him .to retreat, from that position. Whether or not be,

A ND U.S.S.R. SPY SYSTEMS 
Senator AIKEN (coni holing). Since the incidents of recent weeks. 
Yesterday, I got, a tette]. from a lady who I thought was somewhat 
misinformed, prolably not indoctrinated, just misinfOrmed, stating 
that it was the U.S. spy system that forced Russia to maintain a spy 
system. Do you go along with that theory? It seems to be. shared 
by a good many people, and seems to be a theory which is quite 
generally distributed thuo olt not believed in certain quarters. 
Secretary HERTEN_ I would think, sir, that going back into history 
that Russia has had a much longer history than the United States and 
a spy system has been an integral part of Russia's history. [Deleted.]

system before. we did.

of a system up until now.

. EFFECT OF UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT 
One other thing that seems to bother some people is this: 
Would you agree with anyone who stated that if the United States 
would disarm unilaterally Russia would promptly follow suit? 
Secreary HERTER. If we disarmed unilaterally ? 
Senator AIKEN. If the United States would disarm unilaterally as 
an example to the world, Russia would promptly follow suit? 
Secretary HERTER. I do not. 
Senator AIKEN. That is all. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Long? 
PLANS IN EVENT OF SOVIET DOWNING OF U-2 
Senator LoNer. Mr. Secretary, I believe that U-2 flights should have 
been made. I have said that publicly and I have stayed by that 
statement. 
I wondered if the Department and those responsible had not 
planned well in advance just what we were going to do when the 
Soviets ultimately got one of these U-2's. Had there been such plans 
made? 
Secretary HERTER. I believe they had. [Deleted.] 
Senator LONG. Yes. But that also involves your responsibility be-
cause you would be the one who would give the explanation. 
Secretary HERTER. That is correct. 
ESPIONAGE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 
Senator LONG, While I don't sea how the great powers can avoid 
conducting espionage and military intelligence, as a practical matter 
as long as it is conducted on the other person's soil, isn't that a viola-
tion of international law? 
Secretary HERTER. All espionage is a violation of sovereignty, all 
forms of espionage. 
? [Deleted.] 
However, the Chicago Convention, which is: the principal conven-
tion dealing with this, has never been accepted by the Russians nor 
have they accepted any bilateral agreement with regard to airspace 
over their country.

DEVICES CARRIED BY PILOT 
Senator LONG. Are these statements about this poison needle and 
the self-destruction devices correct?

testimony of Mr. Dulles would be more accurate than anything I 
could give.

Curtain? Do you believe that we have adequate information, or do 
you believe it is far from adequate as to what we feel we need to know 
about a potential oppiment? 
Secretary HERTER. Well, I think I can answer that in only one way. 
I think that we are doing the best we can to secure such information 
as we consider vital. No intelligence service is ever considered per-
fect. No intelligence service is ever considered completely adequate. 
I think we are doing, as I said in connection with this particular 
operation I felt we were doing, a prudent and efficient job. 
ADMISSION OF ESPIONAGE FLIGHT 
.Senator lioNo. Well, I believe I had some information about these 
flights prior to this time, not as a member of this committee, 
but this is information I have run across from tune to time as a 
Senator of the United States. I did not seek to be informed officially 
and did not want to I:now directly any more than the hearsay infor-
mation I had on the subject. 
But the thought that occurs to me is this: Would it not be the 
original plan that this Nation would not under any circtunstances 
admit that it was sending those planes behind the Iron Curtain in the 
event that one of those planes was captured? 
Secretary HERTER. I think that, as Mr. Dillon has explained, a cover 
story was prepared for that contingency. I think the actual circum-
stances turned out to be rather different from anything t hat had been 
an( icipated in the preparatory work that had been done. 
Senator LONG. Well, the previous planning had been that we would 
not admit it; is that correct? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
Senator LONG. Now, of course, the Russians are in no position to 
put us on trial. They won't go before the World Court on anything 
with us, will they? 
Secretary HERTER. They have not. 
Senator LONG. As a matter of fact, have we not previously tried 
to get them before the World Court on the shooting down of our 
planes? 
Secretary HERTER. We have tried to got Bulgaria before the World 
Court and have offered to take one of the cases, the border cases, to 
court, and they have refused. 
Senator LONG. And they have declined? 
Secretary HERTER. They have declined. 
Senator LONG. In the absence of any admission on the part of this 
Government, how could they have possibly placed us in a position to 
force us to admit that that plane was deliberately sent there? 
Secretary HERTER. Well, the other cases were all borderline eases 
of incursions over the edge of the border. This particular ease, the 
plane was shot down in the very center of Russia, some '2,000 
kilometers inside of Russia. 
Senator LONG. But the point I have in mind, Mr. Secretary, is that 
I don't see how they can force you to take the fifth amendment be-
cause they wouldn't get you before a tribunal to do it because they 
wouldn't go before it themselves. And I don't see how they could 
have forced you to concede that that was an authorized mission un-
less somebody, the President or you, elected to make that adinission.

BRINGING INSTANCES OF ESPIONAGE BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS 
But do you see any way that the Soviets could have compelled you 
to admit that that espionage mission was a calculated plan and de-
liberately undertaken? 
Secretary HERTER. No, sir, the alternative for us was to continue 
denying any responsibility whatsoever for it. They would undoubt-
edly as they said they would do, take it before the United Nations, 
submit all the evidence to the United Nations, and we would have dug 
ourselves in deeper and deeper in a denial of something which was 
perfectly self-evident. That was the choice that we were faced with. 
Senator LONG. Well, a denial of espionage; but you also would have 
considerable indication that they would be denying espionage on their 
part that you are in position to fairly well prove could you not? 
Could you not try your espionage cases before the -United Nations as 
well as they could? 
Secretary }TEETER. We can. But espionage cases we try before our 
own courts. 
Senator LONG. Yes, but if they wanted to try this ease before the 
United Nations, couldn't you just as well have insisted on trying the 
cases of their espionage in the United Nations simultaneously? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, we could, but in that particular case the 
issue was a rather different one. 
EFFECT OF PLEADING GUILTY OF ESPIONAGE 
Senator LONG. Here is the thought that occurs to me. Under the 
Russian system if the leader admits he made a mistake he has to 
resign more or less as Malenkov did or more or less throw himself 
on the mercy of the party. But when we plead guilty to espionage 
in this case, how can we plead guilty on the one hand and contend 
that there is no punishment in order when we plead guilty to violating 
international law? 
Secretary HERTER. We have said we admitted it entirely on the 
ground that for ourselves and for the free world it was essential for 
us to get information with regard to dangers of surprise attack or 
aggression. 
Senator LONG. The thought that occurs to me is that; and I am not 
sure that we are in a position to be completely self-righteous about 
passing judgment on ourselves in our own case; that is what your 
own people have said, that we judge our own case and do not let the 
World Court decide these matters. I, for one, have been holding 
back because I am not sure we have a fair court. But how do you 
throw yourselves on the mercy of the Court and deny the Court the 
right more or less to judge what the penalty should be? 
Secretary HERTER. Senator, the eases to which you are referring, 
of which there have been quite a number, have all been border cases 
where there was no espionage involved, where it was a question of a 
border patrol or weather patrol or something of that kind where the 
issue was as to whether or not there was an intentional overflight or 
not which is entirely different from this particular case. 
Senator LONG. Yes, but the thought that occurs to me is that we 
didn't have to plead guilty to anything. I know lawyers repre-
sent guilty clients. Now, as with the lawyer, when you plead guilty,

aren't, you more or less in a position that you do have either to apolo-
,oize or take corrective action, or even under our system of law more 
or less offer to take your punishment if you are going to plead guilty? 
Secretary IIIERTER. As you may recall, the President had stated that 
hehad taken corrective action. Ile has characterized this as a re-
grettable incident. When a demand wa,s made on him, these other 
demands on him, I don't think you, sir, or anyone else could have 
accepted those dentands. 
Setrat or LoNG. I doil't require my part of your examinat imt be made 
a part of the public record, Mr. Secretary. I don't insist on it, all, 
but I don't, very well see how we can take the attit ide that, we are 
going to plead guilty in the matter and then take the attitude that 
no apology is forthcoming. 
Secretary HERTER. 1 think this, sir, the circumstances which re-
quired our admission are the most important thing of all. 
Senator GORE. Would you restate that, please, sir? 
Secretary ITERTER. That the circumstances which required our tak-
ing this action of espionage, namely the tremendous importance to 
the whole free world and to ourselves of having some knowledge as 
to whether a sudden surprise attack is going to hit us or what -form 
of aggression was likely to be perpetrated, justified the action.

EI,VEN1_111 OF 1( IIRUSFICIIEV ACTIONS ON FUTURE U.S. INTELLIGENCE-
GA THEM NG ACTIVITIES 
Senator (lAinkso-N. -Mr. Secretary, I want to ask questions on two 
items that if have selected from the mail I have received on the summit 
coIn ference. 
The first is that people that write me are concerned because of the 
fact that Mr. Khrushchev hurled such epithets at us, our President 
and the Nation, as they have?a coward, a bandit, and aggressor. 
Will that influence our course of action in getting information that 
is necessary for our security? 
Secretary HERTER. I think we will do whatever we feel is essential 
for our security. I am not saying in that respect that we are going 
to deliberately utilize the U---2 again. I have never said that. 
Senator (lAnt.sow. That, is one of the questions that concerns our 
people' at, the present time. 
was wondering?can we assure the American people that despite 
all this tirade, there will be no slackening in our efforts to secure, by 
MIN' measures or means, the information that is necessary for the. 
security of this Nation 
Secretary HERTER. I think both the President?I think the Presi?
dent in particular, has made that very clear. 
QUESTION OD' 'MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO IN BERLIN 
Senator CARLSON. L have selected from the mail this question : 
Can Mr. Iiihrushchev be counted on to keep his word on maintaining-
the status quo in Berlin until another summit, meeting ?

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONIPhRhAut, 
Secretary HERTER. That is one, sir, that I cannot answer. 
Senator CARLSON. That is one of the questions that we are getting. 
Now, we are treaty-bound to protect Berlin. Furthermore, we have 
in recent months assured West Berlin that we will never forsake 
them. Mr. Khrushchev has said plainly that he would meet force 
with force in Berlin. 
Can the American people be assured that the United States has 
the full cooperation of our allies in maintaining our position on the 
Berlin status? 
Secretary HERTER. Senator' one of the most impressive things that 
I have ever seen was the meeting of NATO that took place after the 
aborted, so-called summit conference. I have never seen such una-
nimity, such firmness, such determination as exhibited at that meeting. 
Senator CARLSON. That statement should be at least encouraging 
to those of us who are concerned about the situation. 
CONTINUED EFFORTS TOWARD DISARMAMENT AND SUSPENSION OF 
NUCLEAR TESTS 
Another thing that I have picked from my mail is this matter that 
the people are concerned about. 
Will the United States continue to press for controlled disarma-
ment and nuclear test suspension? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, sir. I have indicated in my prepared 
statement that we will continue to do this. 
As you know, however, the conditions that we have always adhered 
to is that the controls have got to be controls that one can rely upon. 
%we In other words, reliable controls on both sides. 
I think that with the very real danger that exists in the world 
today of accidental events that may lead to a nuclear war, that we 
should pursue the course of doing whatever we can to minimize that 
danger, within the bounds that we have stated; namely, that of re-
ciprocal and effective control. 
Senator CARLSON. Mr. Secretary, do you feel that we are making 
any progress on these nuclear test suspensions at the Geneva Confer-
ence and other places? 
Secretary HERTER. During the last few weeks, really the last few 
days, they have been meeting in Geneva examining a coordinated 
program of research for improving instrumentation so that small 
shots can be detected underground. 
Those conferences have moved, I think, pretty satisfactorily. They 
are halted at this moment, awaiting some instructions from Moscow. 
In the next few days we should know better whether or not there 
has been any radical change of position on the part of the Russians 
or not. There is some chance of reaching agreement. It will be a 
limited agreement at best, but that again depends on -full agreement 
with regard to the control mechanisms. 
As you know, those talks have been going for a long time. Until 
they are shown to be hopeless, I think we will continue with them. 
Senator CARLSON. That is all, Mr. Chairman.

TH REE CRUCIAL QI7ESTIONS 
Senator GORE. Mr. Secretary, it seems to me that three crucial 
questions here are these: 
One. Was there a failure in policy? 
Two. Who, if anyone, was in charge? 
Three. Was there a lack of coordination and a breakdown in ad-
ministrative procedure? 
Senator WILEY. A little louder, please. 
Senator GORE. Would you like me to repeat all of them? 
I said that there were three questions, it seemed to me,, three crucial 
questions. 
One, was there a failure of policy? 
Two, who, if anyone, was in charge? 
Three, was there a. lack of coordination and breakdown in adminis-
trative procedure? 
I should like to explore these three questions in inverse order. 
RECEIPT OE FIRST INFORMATION THAT U-2 PLANE WAS DOWN IN RUSSIA 
When did the Department first receive information that the U-2 
flight was down in Russia? 
Mr. Dimply. Senator, since I was Acting Secretary at that time, I 
think it is proper for me to answer that. 
That information was received in the Department during the day, 
on Sunday, the 1st of May, at about the middle of the day, our time. 
Senator Go. What was the nature of that information? 
Mr. Dit,LoN. The nature of the information as conveyed to me, 
which had been received in the Department through the Central Intel-
ligence Agency, was that this plane was overdue at its destination, 
and that the time beyond which its fuel supply would carry it had run 
out; and so, therefore, it was presumed down somewhere. 
Senator GORE. The question I ask is, When did you first have some 
notice, some information, some hint that the plane was actually down 
in Russian territory? I was not referring to your presumption that 
because of its flight pattern and the amount of fuel that it must 
be down. 
When did you actually receive some intelligence, some hint, that the 
Soviets had the plane? 
Mr. DILLON. That, the Soviets had the plane?I think the first in-
formation we received on that was at the time Mr. Khrushchev made 
his statement on Thursday morning before the?I think it was the 
Supreme Soviet on the, 5th day of May. 
Senator GORE. Are you sure you received no hint, no information, 
re) report from either your Embassy in Russia or the Central Intelli-
gence Agency that the plane might actually be down in Russia? 
Mr. Dpi,oN. Since rirost of the flight pattern of the plane, its mis-
sion, was to spend most of its time over the Soviet Union, it was our 
assumption, right from the first word, that when the plane did not 
return that it was most likely that it was down in the Soviet Union. 
But we did not receive any specific information that, it was down 
in the Soviet Union, that the Russians had either the plane, the pilot, 
or any parts of it, until Mr. Khrushchev made the statement on 
Thursday morning.

RECEIPT OF FIRST INFORMATION THAT PILOT HAD BEEN CAPTURED 
Senator GORE. When did you first receive some hint, some informa-
tion, some indication that the Soviets might have the pilot alive? 
Mr. DILLON. The first information we received on that was received 
in the Department in the afternoon of the 5th day of May, after we 
had put out our first statements. 
This was in the form of a report from our Embassy in Moscow 
saying that various other foreign diplomats had heard at cocktail 
parties or receptions from various Soviet officials that this plane was 
down and at one time, to one of these foreign diplomats, a Soviet 
official said that they had the pilot and that report reached us. 
We didn't know whether it was accurate or not, but it gave us 
pause. That reached us the afternoon of Thursday, and I think it was 
on Friday that we identified the fact that a photograph of the wreck-
age as put out by the Soviets was a fraud and so then at that time 
we assumed, we acted on the assumption from then on, that they 
probably had the pilot and that they possibly had a good deal of the 
plane. 
Senator GORE. A member of your Department informed me in the 
offices of the committee on Friday morning of the 6th that the De-
partment did, in fact, have information indicating that the Soviets 
might have this pilot alive. 
Mr. DILLON. That was probably reporting the information which 
I said was received the afternoon of the 5th regarding that. 
BASIS FOR STATEMENT OF STATE DEPARTMENT'S NEWS DIRECTOR 
LINCOLN WHITE 
Senator Goun. Yes. Now you say that you knew of the flight, you 
knew of the flight pattern, and you assumed that the plane was down 
in Russia. 
You say now that on the 5th you received this information that 
the pilot was probably alive and yet, on the afternoon of the 6th, 
this Mr. Lincoln White, official spokesman for the Department, said 
this: 
There was absolutely no?N-0, no deliberate attempt to violate Soviet air-
space. There has never been. 
Did you authorize that statement? 
Mr. AIIILLoN. No, not specifically. Mr. White was not one of those 
in the Department of State that had any knowledge of these 
operations. 
The statement which we authorized the day before, which is in the 
record, was not that categoric. But I don't think that there was 
any reason why he shouldn't have made such a statement. He drew 
that conclusion from the NASA statement of the day before and 
when he was asked questions?he didn't volunteer this statement. 
He was being questioned apparently in a press conference and he 
made that statement. 
We did not authorize a statement, specifically. He did not ask 
us for it, but he thought he was carrying out the NASA story.

of this intelligence operation any more than the people who made 
the press statements for NASA were informed of the l'acts of t. 
Senator Goan. Do ,you call that responsible and coordinated per-
forma,nm ? 
DILLoN. We are 4.!etting at this stage, Senator, into another 
quostion, the key question of intelligence. When you have something 
as important and secret an this, it is important to limit he knowledge 
to the 'minimum number of people and this was strictly limited 
throughout the Government and we did limit it in the State Depart-
ment. 
;Ve did not think it, was proper to inform our press people. There 
was a special procedure for people who were informed of this, and 
the press peojde were not st) in formed. 
Senator (hoah. Mr. Secretary, I am not questioning you about the 
initial cover statement issue you had in Turkey. I n in asking you 
ab int art official falsehood on May 6, after you say the 1)epartment 
know of the flight pal tern, assumed the plane was down, a whole day 
afier you received information that the pilot was probably alive and 
in the afternoon of the day after oven I had been informed. I ask 
you again if you think this is an example of the coordination which 
pat earl ler told its the Department had. 
Mr. Dri,i,ox. Senator. I will answer that. I t hink it, took a major 
effort which was reached the following day that we were going to 
abandon our cover st try and tell the truth. That decision could not 
be reached rapidly and quickly. It was reached afte,r long sessions 
with the Secretary on Saturday and until that was reached, we saw 
no reason to inform our press officer of anything but lie cover story 
wIlich is what we were standing by up until that time.

The CHAIRMAN. Senator, may I interrupt? I didn't understand 
why Mr. White wasn't, required to clear his statement, at this time

Mr. DILLON. I am glad to answer that. Mr. White sees the press 
CA cry day, and be does not know in advance necessarily the detailed 
yiestions that lie may be asked. 
If a question comes that he thinks he does not know the answer to, 
lie does clear it with its. 
Now, the day before, when we put out our statement, it was given to 
him and he followed exactly what he had been told. Ile did not make 
any statement that was quite as categoric as this statement be made 
t lie following day.

Mr. DILLON. This was just an answer to a question. Why he did it, 
he thought he was telling the truth. I think he acted perfectly all 
right. He did not think that this was a new question. He thought 
he was following the cover story, which he was. So he made this 
statement.. It wasn't a statement; it was in answer to a question. I 
want to emphasize that.. 
The CHAIRMAN. It was a very categorical statement that went far 
beyond the other statement. That is what begins to complicate your 
situation, doesn't it? 
Mr. DILLON. Possibly to some extent, yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Ohio. 
IMPORTANCE OF INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING ACTIVITIES 
Senator LAUSCHE. First of all, I want to pursue this question. 
Shall we abandon or modify our efforts of gathering intelligence, 
covering the military activities of potential aggressors? 
First, I ask Mr. Herter this question. At any time during the ap-
pearance of Mr. Dulles, the Central Intelligence Agency Director, 
before this committee do you know of him at any time being chal-
lenged or asked about how he acquired intelligence? 
Secretary HEIRTER. That I cannot answer at firsthand. My impres-
sion is that there was a very small group in the Senate with whom he 
conferred. He has got this responsibility under the law, which was 
written by the Congress. 
Senator LATTSCHE. You have answered my question. Have you ever 
heard of any member of this committee or any member of the Con-
gress asking the Central Intelligence Agency to discontinue acquiring 
intelligence or to modify its methods? 
Secretary HERTER. No, 0, I do not. 
May I qualify that to this extent? I think that Senator Mansfield 
had introduced a measure which would provide for a different method 
of coordinating with the Congress. That is the only thing I do 
know of. 
Senator LAI-SORE. Would it be right to assume that at this very 
moment there is great probability that there are Soviet intelligence 
agents operating in our country? 
Secretary HERTER. I would assume SO. 
Senator LAITSCIIE. Do you know of any member of our Defense De-
partment in a responsible position, or any person in any government 
who is responsible for security, taking the position that intelligence 
of a potential enemy's conduct is not essential for the proper develop-
ment of a nation's own defense.? 
Secretary HERTER. I do not. 
Senator T_JAITSCHE. Do I understand that you subscribe to the state-
ment made by the President that for the protection of the security 
of our country it is essential that intelligence of potential enemies' 
conduct be acquired? 
Secretary HERTER. I do. 
Senator LAITSCHE. Now then, this question: Do you feel that it 
would be wise for our Government in the face of the discussions about 
peace and disarmament and banning of nuclear tests to discontinue 
our intelligence activities?

Secretary HERTER. T do not. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Would it be a danger to our country if at this 
moment while we are discussing disarmament and banning of nuclear 
tesi s we scuttle the Central Intelligence Agency? 
Secretary HERTER. E certainly would not advocate anything of the 
Senator LAUSCHE. What is :it historically concerning men in a re-
sponsible position for the protection of a country, beginning from the 
earliest days of recorded battles about the use of scouts and intelli-
gence agents, so as to properly guide a country in what it ought to do? 
Secretary HERTER. It is a custom, sir, that has grown up, I imagine, 
ever since warfare began. 
KM it ISO Cli E DECISION NUT TO PARTICIPATE IN SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Senator LAUSCI1E. Now then, the second question: Is it your con-
sidered opinion that when IC hrushchey came to Paris In had already 
deP ided not to participate in the summit conference ? 
Secretary HERTER. That is our best judgment. 
Senator IJAUSCIIE. And that judgment is formulated not upon 
what he lias said but what he has done; is that correct? 
Secretary HERTER. It is a combination of both. But. it. is mostly 
in what he has said, and the assumption is that he had received his 
orders before he went to Paris. 
Senator LArrsonE. Is it a fact that beginning in December 1959 
and going down into April, he has made statements indicating that 
the probability was that there would never be a conference? 
Secretary HERTER. Not the probability that there would never be 
a conference but that if a conference were held it would not turn out 
to his satisfaction. 
Kii RI rS ICJ IEV 'S iIEETINGS wrin DE GAULLE AND AIAGMIL LAN 
Senator LAUSC in. He was scheduled to arrive in Paris on Sunday, 
May 15; is that correct?

Senator LAuscitE. But instead of coming there on Sunday, May 
15, he came there on Saturday, May 14. 
Secretary HERTER. ['hat is right. 
Senator LAusoirE. And on Sunday morning be, with Malinovsky, 
at the early hour of ii o'clock already had made an appointment to

Senator LA-luso:RE. And at that meeting this vigorous statement 
about what they expected of Eisenhower if Khruslichey were to at-
tend the conference was read. 
Secretary HERTER. Yes; that was not only read but a copy of it was 
given to General de Gaulle. 
Senator LAuscnn. Why do you think that he came there before his 
scheduled visit of Sunday and made it Saturday? 
Secretary HERTER. Wh3., he came to Paris at all is the real question. 
That is a question that General de Gaulle asked him at the time of 
the one meeting when the four were present and to which the answer 
wa, completely unsatisfactory.

Senator LAiiscHE. So that at 11 o'clock in the morning he met with 
de Gaulle and laid down these four demands upon Eisenhower. 
Secretary HERTER. That is right. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Then at the hour of 4:30 in the afternoon he went 
to Macmillan and to Macmillan repeated those demands, that unless 
they were met he would not attend the conference. 
Secretary HERTER. That is right. 
Senator LAU SCHE. Did anything happen between his arrival on 
Saturday, his action at 11 o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and 4:30 
on Sunday, that would have caused him to change his mind from 
what he was thinking when he left Moscow? 
Secretary HERTER. Not a thing. 
PREMIER KHRUSHCHEVIS DEMANDS 
Senator LAUSCHE. Now then, Mr. Secretary, getting down to these 
demands that he made i 
that s, he demanded that Eisenhower de-
nounce the overflights; is that correct; and two, that he apologize to 
the Soviet Union. 
Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
Senator LAU SCHE. And three, that he punish those directly respon-
sible. 
? Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
Senator LAU SCHE. And four, that Eisenhower promise not to repeat 
these flights. 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, may I add there, sir, that the demand for 
the apology was added; it was not in the original document. It was 
one that was added by him while he was in Paris as a fourth condition. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Can we assume that Khrushchev honestly ex-
pected that these demands that he made upon Eisenhower would be 
complied with? 
Secretary HERTER. He could not have possibly. 
Senator LAurscHE. That is additional proof confirming the assump-
tion that when he left Moscow he never intended to participate in the 
conference. 
Secretary HERTER. You are quite right, sir. 
WHY DID KIIRUSHCHEV GO TO PARIS? 
Senator LAuscin. Why couldn't he have issued this statement while 
he was in Moscow, and why did he go to Paris instead of making the 
statement in Moscow? 
Secretary HERTER. There it is a matter of speculation but I think 
that the desire to dramatize himself, the fact that there would be 3,000 
correspondents in Paris, that he would have a larger audience in that 
place, led him to take this particular route. 
SOVIET MISDEEDS

Senator WILEY.Ihit there are different rules that apply, too, are

Senator WILET. Just this one thing. Now, then, if the first law of 
human nature is the law of self-preservation then the best means 
that we can use to preserve the freedom of self-preservation,
the CIA has 
been using when it has been using the overflight, the 7U-2 means; is 
that right? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, sir. 
Senator WILEy. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. We will 
return here at 2 :30. 
Secretary HERTER. 2:30. 
The CHAIRmAN. Yes, Sir. I may say to the committee that the 
Secretary has very kindly agreed to go on today and, if the ques-
tioning is not completed, to come back in the morning. We will 
determine that at the end of today's session. 
I hope we can make progress. 
(Whereupon, at 12 :45 p.m. the hearing was recessed, to reconvene 
at 2 :30 p.m. of the same day.) 
AFTERNOON SESSION 
Present: Senators Fulbright, Humphrey, Mansfield, Gore, Lausche, 
Wiley, Hickenlooper, Aiken, Carlson and Williams. 
The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order. 
Mr. Secretary, there are one or two statements in your own state-
ment I would like to have developed a bit for clarification. 
COURSE FOLLOWED BY PREMIER KIIRL-SIICHEY 
On page 12, at the bottom of the page of the mimeographed state-
ment you say as follows: 
Proponents within the Communist bloc of an aggressive course must not be 
encouraged by signs of weakness on our part. Proponents of a peaceful course 
should be encouraged by our readiness to get on with outstanding international 
business in a sober and rational manner. 
In which of these groups do you include Mr. Khrushchev ? 
STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTIAN A. HERTER, SECRETARY OF 
STATE?Resumed 
Secretary HERTER. That I think would be very difficult to answer 
categorically. 
There have been a good many estimates made as to whether or not 
he really means some of the things that be has said with regard to 
peaceful coexistence, with regard to disarmament and other matters. 
There is another group that feels that this is a front for the same 
power line that Stalin used to take. 
I don't think it is possible yet to answer that categorically. 
I think that events are likely to show which of those groups he 
belongs to. 
The CHAIR-mAN. Who did you have in mind when you wrote that? 
Maybe you can't categorically for all time designate him, but what 
has been your view an the view of the Department as to which group 
he belongs in? I think that is rather important as to how we treat 
him. Is it in our interest to discourage him? If he were a member

56 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
of the aggressive course group, I suppose it would be. If he is a 
member of flw group who are proponents of the peaceful course, then 
it would be to our advantage to encourage or be cooperative within 
limits. I wondered why you put that in there if you didn't have 
some idea of who does belong to these groups or how they are 
constituted. 
Secret aiy HEIZTER. What I was trying to describe here we s in effect 
a middle course. Insofar as Mr. Khrushchev is concerned, I think 
those who have dealt with him directly were, convinced that he was 
genuinely in favor of a, disarmament program, that he genuinely 
wanted, for the sake or developing the economy of Russia, a reduction 
both in expense from a monetary point of view and from a human 
point of view, of the groat burden of armaments. 
Certainly there I ould put him in the second category. His more 
recent behavior, however, has shaken my belief that this is entirely 
genuine, and, as I sac. I think that only the events of the next few 
months and possibly even of the next few years cart give a final 
answer to what you have asked. 
IDENTIFICATION WITH TRENDS IN THE SOVIET UNION 
The CHAIRMAN. Can you identify any other members or any people 
you had in mind in citing i hese groups?' 
Secretary HERTER. No. I would rather have those who are real 
Russian experts do that kind of identification, those who are familiar 
with the individuals, more familiar than I am. 
There, is no question but what there are still  
The CHAIRMAN. Would you care to have Mr. Bohlen comment on 
this question? 
Secretary HERTER. I would be very glad to have him, if you wish 
to. 
The CHAIRMAN. It would be very good to have him comment. He 
is recognized, is he not, as one of our best Russian experts? 
Would you care to comment on this, Mr. Bohlen? 
Mr. BOHLEN. Mr. Chairman, my experience has been that it is not 
always possible to identify a trend in the Soviet Union with individ-
uals. As the Secretary said earlier we literally know nothing of what 
goes on in the hierarchy. My impression of the statement the Secre-
tary made is that it is possible to detect trends. You cannot identify 
people with them. My experience with the Soviet officials is that they 
follow whatever the agreed line is, whether it is hard or whether it is 
soft, with great consistency, and they just do not reveal sufficiently to 
any foreigner what their inner thoughts are to identify one individual 
with one trend or another. But I think the indications are that both 
trends exist. 
COURSE Et 'ILO WED 11Y PREMIER IIHRITSHCHEV 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, don't you think we know more about Mr. 
Khrushchev than any other Soviet leader? More of us have seen him. 
He has been around more than any other. Don't you have any view 
as to which of these groups Mr. Khrushchev would be identified with? 
Mr. 13011LEN. Well, my acquaintanceship with Mr. Khrushchev was 
when I was in there as Ambassador when he was not quite as promi-

4014 
Vpproved ForuMeAs?Afilf#15/13 ;rEA-Rmi-ggpaR,M10002%0/01-1 
nent as he is now. I would merely say that he, along with all of them 
are excellent actors [deleted] and are able to maintain whatever the 
common line is in their dealings with foreigners. I think also there 
is a question of time. I think, as the events of Paris showed, that 
there have been certain shifts of emphasis inside the Soviet Union 
which were manifested in part by what they did in Paris. 
Therefore, it is conceivable that Mr. Khrushchev could have been 
entirely serious in the lino he was pursuing prior to Paris, and be 
equally serious in pursuing one diametrically opposite to it. 
The CHAIRMAN. If I may interpolate, do you mean that prior to 
the U-2 incident Mr. Khrushchev may have been identified with the 
second group; that is, proponents of a peaceful course? 
Mr. BoHEEN. I would not segregate out the U-2 incident alone, 
Mr. Chairman. I think, as outlined in the Secretary's statement, 
there seemed to us to be three elements involved in this matter, and 
I think it is difficult to assess the value of each. But, certainly, I 
would say his doubt as to the success from his point of view of the 
summit conference, that some of the views voiced by the Chinese 
Communists had probably supporters within the Soviet hierarchy, 
and the 11-2 incident together brought about this change. 
I have no difficulty  
IDENTIFICATION WITH TRENDS IN THE SOVIET UNION 
The CHAIRMAN. I didn't wish to make you review all that was 
said there. I was merely trying to find the inner meaning of this 
particular statement. I thought that I could elicit some clarifica-
tion since many of us don't know about these proponents of these 
courses or about any of these groups of people. 
Mr. BormEN. The answer, Mr. Chairman, is that I think we don't 
know. That you cannot tell whether X, Y, or Z in the Soviet hierar-
chy, what particular line he advocates, because he never reveals any 
difference, oven a shade of difference publicly, with what is the 
agreed line. It is quite impossible, I believe, for anybody to tell who 
within the leading group stands for one trend or the other. You 
can only detect from external evidence that there appear to be cer-
tain divergent trends and the individuals may not remain the same. 
WAS THERE A DECISION NOT TO SUSPEND FLIGHTS AS SUMMIT MEETING 
APPROACHED? 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. One other statement, Mr. 
Secretary, on page 5, point 2: 
The decision not to suspend this program of flights, as the summit meeting 
approached, was a sound decision. 
Can you tell us who made that decision, and when, and of the 
circumstances? 
Secretary HERTER. That is a decision that I think has been carried 
over the whole 4-year period. Here, sir, we get into certain technical 
aspects of when these flights would properly be conducted and could 
not be conducted, but I think the technical reasons had better be kept 
in executive session. 
The finding of a good time for a flight of this kind in relation to 
current events is almost impossible if you had known in advance that 
it is going to fail.

rOS EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
The real issue AVIIS how urgent was the information and is there 
tiny one time that, is note favorable than another ? From a technical 
point of view the time AV as more favorable at that tinw than another. 
ft-ron i a diplomatic en it of view, it seemed to ine that with the 
l'resident, scheduled to go to Russia later, there wouli I have been the 
difficulty; when K kruslichev was here there was the same diffi-
(nay, in effect one would run into one time after another where 
diplomatically it would have been a bad time. 
The, CD A IRMAN. I I ion't think I make myself clear. _I anderstood 
f corn your previous statement and others that the program was agreed 
upon, anti it was running along without being suspended. But this 
statement seems to leave the implication that a specific decision was 
ff.kon not to suspend them in view of the conference approaching. 
Was such a decision taken ? 
Secreta ry IIntraat. That I can't toll you. I was not a party to that. 
The CI !AIRMAN. Well, this says: 
The decision not to suspeod this program of flights, as the summit meeting 
aoproached. was a sound decision. 
Was thieve any decision taken not to suspend it? 
Secretary Htiirrtin. I know that when the matter came before me, 
which was some time previous from the point of view a the continua-
tion of the program, when conditions were appropriate, I did not inter-
ise any objection to it because of any diplomatic event that was com-
ing up. 
'rho Ci [AIRMAN. IL-3 it fair to say then that DO specific decision not 
stispent I h(911 WaS taken ? It was allowed to go along without any 
decision_ being taken to suspend them. 
Secretary lInitTnn. I t1 ink that is correct. 
The CHAIRMAN. Therefore, the other way around is that, no positive 
decision was taken not to suspend them; is that correct? 
Seeretary HiarrEn. That is right. 
The Ci 'AIRMAN. That, statement, I think, needs clarification. I 
I hink, to me, it, means that at some point prior to May 1 a speeific 
decision was taken not to suspend them in view of the summit. Isn't 
that a legitimate interpretation of that sentence? 
Secretary HERTF7,1Z. I think that is correct,. May I read what the 
I 'resident, said on that subject ? He said : 
A8 to the liming, the question was really whether to halt the program and thus 
forego the gathering of important information that was essential and that was 
likely to be unavailable at. a later date. 
The prograni went forward. 
The CHAIRMAN. Then that decision was made by the President. 
Secretary HERTER. Oh., he was certainly consulted with regard to 
the continuation of the program. 
The CI IA 'RATAN. 1 o you know when that decision was made? 
Secretary HERTEn. No. 
The ChAIRMAN. Was it prior to May 1_ ?

The CHAIRMAN. So that there was not, as far as you know? 
Secretary HERTER. As far as I know, there was not. 
PRESS SECRETARY HAGERTY'S KNOWLEDGE 
The CHAIRMAN. I refer to this matter that Mr. Lincoln White did 
not know that Powers might be alive, the last question before we 
recessed. Did Mr. Hagerty know whether or not he was at that 
point? 
Secretary HERTER. That I will have to ask Mr. Dillon to answer. 
I have no direct information. 
Mr. DILLON. I have way of knowing whether Mr. Hagerty knew 
or not. In the ordinary course of business, a telegram such as the one 
which informed us of this rumor?it's only a rumor that we had 
received through other diplomats in Moscow such a telegram would 
have been transmitted for information to the White House staff. 
Whether Mr. Hagerty knew about it or not, I don't know. 
QUESTION OF SOUNDING OUT PREMIER KHRUSIICIIEV'S FEELINGS 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, was any effort made on the part of 
our Ambassadors or anyone from the Department, after the incident, 
to pursue Mr. Khrushchev's feelings? 
Was anyone instructed to approach him and express any regret or 
in any way to reconcile him to forgive or overlook this incident? 
Secretary HERTER. No, I don't know of any such thing. 
Tho CHAIRMAN. No approach was made? 
Secretary HERTER. No. 
IMPLICATION THAT FLIGHTS WOULD CONTINUE 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, what were the considerations which 
led to the decision, not only to assume responsibility for the flight, but 
to imply that the flights would continue in the future? 
Secretary HERTER. I have to take responsibility for t.he statement 
that was interpreted and if I may, I would like to read you exactly 
what was said on that score. 
This is a statement that was interpreted that we were going to con-
tinue the flights: 
The Government of the United States would be derelict to its responsibility 
not only to the American people but to free peoples everywhere if it did not, in 
the absence of Soviet cooperation, take such measures as are possible unilaterally 
to lessen and to overcome this clanger of surprise attack. In fact the United 
States has not and does not shirk this responsibility. 
That is the statement that was interpreted that we were going to 
continue the flights, and it seems to me it was a pretty far-fetched 
interpretation. 
The CHAIRMAN. Then do you mean in that statement you did not 
intend to convey the view or the possibility that the flights would be 
continued; is that correct? 
Secretary HERTER.. No; what I was saying there was just what I 
have testified to today; that from the point of view of our own in-
terests and that of the. whole free world, it is essential for us to do

whatever we properly can in order to acquire information to avoid 
surprise attack or to be prepared for it. 
The CHAIRMAN. But in view of that statement, do you think that; 
Mr. Khrushchev could accept it and continue the conference? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes; I certainly do, if he had wanted to. 
The CHAIRMAN. Do you think our President would accept such a 
statement from any oilier power? 
Secretary HERTER. If he wanted to go to a conference? Certainly. 
The CHAIRMAN. My time is up. 
Senator Wiley? 
KIIRUSIICHEV'S KNOWLEDGE OF FLIGHTS 
Senator Waxy. Now in relation to that last question, the President 
has suggested time and time again an open skies arrangement, hasn't 
he? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
Senator WILEY. That means that planes would be flying over our 
country and over every other country where it, is necessary. Again. 
I go to the subject that I think is most important, because some quoted 
and I quo ed on the floor of the Senate the other day the Biblical verse 
that a little child shall lead them. I had a group of children from 
Oshkosh, Wis., that I was talking to. After I talked to them, I opened 
myself to questions. One of these girls said, "Senator, if we stop 
taking these flights, how are we going to get the information that is 
going on back of the Iron Curtain ?" 
Well, I. think all America is asking that question, and I am satisfied 
that if we are realists, as I think we are becoming more and more, that 
we are not going to go up a lot of blind alleys about this and that, and 
about what was or what wasn't said. We are going to face the situ-
ation head on and simply say we want defensively to be adequately 
prepared and alert and we want the Kremlin to know the facts as they 
have been now for, I I hunk, about 31/, years, that we have been sending 
these planes over. Khrushchey knew it at the time that he was up 
at Camp David, and certainly having the knowledge then could have 
interfered with his interest in holding the meeting if he had wanted 
it to. Do you think my conclusions are correct in that respect? 
Secretary HERTER. I do. 
SOVIET REFUSAL TO PERMIT PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S TRIP 
Senator Wri.Ey. I. didn't get the import of the questions when I 
came in that apparently referred to some different groups. What is 
the name of the young man who defected the other day? I guess 
that is what you call it. Ile testified on  
Senator LAttscdE. Meet the Press. 
Senator WILEY-. Meet the Press. It is a long, Russian name. I put 
what* he said into the record today. But one of the important things 
be brought out, and I would like to get the former Ambassador's at-
tention on this, was that there is a group of young people growing up 
in Russia who have different ideas, and he was about to go into detail 
on it when time ran out:. But among other things, he is the one who. 
said--and this is important?he said some months ago that Khru-

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
shchev and the powers in being would not permit the President to 
come to Russia, that they would find some excuse. 
Now, that is all in what he said over the radio here a couple of 
weeks ago. That confirms, I presume, your own idea that when 
Khrushchev came to Paris, he had already decided that he was 
going to throw the bombshell, and he would refuse to invite the 
President, and so forth; is that right? 
Secretary HERTER. That is right. 
Senator WILEY. So this is something that didn't result from the 
downing of the plane. 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 13-2 PLANE? 
I want to ask you a question. Have you any definite information 
as to whether or not this young Powers is alive? 
Secretary HERTER.. No, sir. We have no information other than 
that which the Russians have furnished to us. 
Senator WILEY. If that plane had been shot down, do you think the 
instruments that he had with him would have remained intact? 
Secretary HERTER. There, sir, I am not skilled enough in the tech-
nique of shooting down planes. But I should think it is very doubtful 
if he was hit by a rocket whether either he or the plane would have 
come down intact. 
Senator WILEY. Is there any thought that perhaps they have the 
plane? They claim they have the instruments and they have shown 
something which wasn't the plane. Do you think they have that 
intact? 
Secretary HERTER. They have shown a later photograph of a plane 
which those who built the plane feel is the plane itself. They have 
also shown pieces of the plane in Gorky Park in Moscow when they 
invited all the diplomats to come and look at it, and I think our people 
feel that that is a genuine part of the plane. 
INTERNAL CONDITIONS IN RUSSIA 
Senator WILEY. I want to ask the former Ambassador if it is true 
that the youth in Russia, the new class of youth, is growing up like 
this fellow said. Someone said if he had been privileged to carry on 
his answer he would have said they are not satisfied with their standard 
of living, that they are not satisfied with the little opportunity they 
have to express themselves in the political life of Russia. Do you. 
know whether that would be true or not? 
Mr. BOHLEN. I think it is a fair assumption, Senator. Of course, 
as you know, the possibilities for contacts in there during the period 
I was there were considerably less than they are now. The country 
is still totally controlled by the mechanism of the Communist Party, 
of the Soviet Union. They control all modes of expression by press, 
meetings, or anything else, so it is very difficult to get any overt signs 
of the feelings of the youth or any other section of the population. 
But there are certain indications that the youth are looking forward. 
at some time in the future to considerably different circumstances: 
They hope for better material conditions and also undoubtedly hope 
for a period when they will have more freedom of expression and 
more ability to participate in the political life of their country.

Senator MA-Ns-FIELD. Mr, Secretary, it has been reported that at the 
House hearings, you slid there were. indications that even before 
May 0 the Russians planned to scuttle the conference.. 
Now, it seems to tre if we are going to estimate the. importance of 
the iia'ide.nt in flat collapse of the summit, we need to fix the date 
when these indications in any significant fashion beo-an to appear. Ii 
would appreciate., then, in the interest of saving time, yes or no answers 
to certain questions which T tun about to ask unless there is a need of 
an elaboration. 
The first, question I Are you aware whether any member of the 
Cabinet or the President had any reason to believe before. May 15 
when Khrushchev made his demands for an apology and so forth, 
that he would come to Paris and leave as he did? 
Secretttry HERTER. No. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Were there .any indications that, Khrusbehev 
planned to scuttle the conference before the 11-2 plane was shot down 
On May 1?

much in the spirit of Camp David or would you say it was an excel-
lent, forthright and anti-( 'ommunist .statement somewhat, oblivious 
to the spirit of Camp 1-)avid, the kind of speech which any official of 
the State Department might have made before that historic meeting?

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Secretary HERTER. That I can't qualify with a yes or no answer, 
Senator. 
Senator MANSFIELD. YOU can go into detail there. 
Secretary HERTER. I would say this, that Mr. Dillon's speech was 
almost a requirement as an answer to the allegations that had been 
made by Mr. Khruslichey against Adenauer and the Germans and 
his continued repetition which I have given the chronology of, of the 
fact that they were going to take this unilateral position sooner or 
later without its being an absolute ultimatum on the subject of Berlin, 
Germany. 
Senator MANSFIELD. In other words, Mr. Secretary, speeches which 
you and Mr. Dillon made were a counteraction to the gradual harden-
ino. of Mr. Khrushchev's speeches in the period preceding that? 
ecretary HERTER. Entirely. 
? QUESTION OF STATE DEPARTMENT KNOWLEDGE OF U-2 FLIGHT 
Senator MANSFIELD. Did Secretary Dillon propose that a U-2 
flight be undertaken prior to the summit conference? 
Mr. DiLnoN. No. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Dillon, as acting Secretary, were you 
aware beforehand of the scheduling of the U-2 flight over the Soviet 
Union on May 1? 
Mr. DILLON. No, I was not aware of it. 
I was aware that there was a program of flights that might take 
place at some time when the weather was right but I think I was 
informed of that maybe a month or two before this actual time, and 
I had nothino?'' to do with it afterward because I didn't in the ordinary 
course of my duties. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Your knowledge was, in effect, general 
knowledge? 
Mr. DILLON. Yes. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Herter happening to be out of the country 
at the time was, I assume, unaware of any specific flight but per-
haps had general knowledge that these flights were being undertaken 
and had been over a period of years. 
Secretary HERTER. I didn't know there was a flight underway. The 
first knowledge I received was when I was in Ankara. All I heard 
was this same report that a plane was down. 
PRESIDENT'S ASSUMPTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FLIGHT 
Senator MANSFIELD. Now, both of you have had general knowledge 
of this: Would it be a fair assumption to say, despite the fact that 
the President undertook, in a certain sense, personal responsibility for 
this particular flight, that he, too, likewise, had only general knowl-
edge but that because of his position as the Chief of State, he would 
be held responsible under any circumstances because of his position 
of responsibility? 
Secretary HERTER. That is correct. 
Might I just qualify one thing? When you say he was familiar 
with this particular flight and his timing, so far as I know all of us 
were familiar with alternate possibilities of flights but not this par-
ticular flight as such.

Secretary HERTER. That is correct. 
STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR FLIGHTS 
Senator MANSFIELD. From what legislation or Executive orders, or 
both, was the authority for these flights of deep penetration derived? 
Secretary HERTER. Well, presumably from the fact that I have here 
before me?I am told that this applied to two specific acts. The one 
that I am particularly familiar with, that I had a moment ago, is the 
one creating the Central intelligence Agency. The other is the Na-
tional Security Act. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Would it be possible to have copies for the 
record at this point? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
Senator MANSFIELD, Mr. Chairman, I ask that they be included in

OI:LAL DIRECTIVE SUSPENDING FLIGTITS 
Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Secretary, by what authority have these 
flights now been suspended? 
Secretary HERTER. Senator, I have now got. before me the National 
Security Act of 194-7, anti if you wish we to read the pertinent para-
graph I will be. gl ad to do. so, 
Senator MANSFIELD. No; I would just like to have the pertinent 
parts incorporated in the executive record. 
Secretary. HERTER. Right-. 
Senator MANspoun. Now the, question, to repeat, is by what au-
thority have these flights now been suspended? 
Secretary HErrrnit. By direction of the. President. 
Senator MANsninto. By a Presidential directive. Could we have a 
copy of that for the record? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes; I assume so. I don't know whether it was 
given in writing or whether it, was done by word of mouth. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Well, will you look into it end see what you 
can do to comply with the request? 
Secretary Martin. Yes. 
(It was later reported by the Department of State that the directive 
was oral.) 
tuTa ATI? X OF ORDER SUSPENDING FLIGHTS 
Senator MANsFinto. Will this order suspending the flights auto-
matically remain in force after President Eisenhower leaves office 
and until it is superseded by another order of some future President? 
Secretary HERTER. It could be. The President's responsibility as 
Commander in Chief which gives him the right, to give an order of 
this kind would, of course, expire with him. It would only be 
through some treaty obligation that there would be a binding commit-
ment on the part of the United States to carry beyond his term. 
Senator MANsyttAti. Do I understand you correctly, then, to state 
that this order would automatically die with the leaving of office by 
President Eisenhower, and to become. effective again would have to be 
once again initiated by the next President.? 
Secretary HERTER, I believe another President would be free to do 
as he sees fit. 
EFFECT OF 15-2 INCIDENT ON KIIRUSTICHEV'S POSMON TN RUSSIA 
Senator MANSFIELD. Have Russian experts in the executive branch 
suggested the possibility that Khrushchev's position at home may have 
become seriously undermined?

EVENTS INCIDENT TO TEE SUMMIT UONF tat H.M..a, 
Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Do you believe that the U-2 may have been a 
contributing factor to this undermining2 
Secretary HERTER. It may have been. May I elaborate on that? 
It may have been in the sense that it must have been a great shock 
to both the military and to the civilian leaders in Russia to find that 
they had been as open as they were for such a long period of time. 
, Senator MANSFIELD. And to him RS well. 
Secretary HERTER. To him as well. 
POSSIBILITIES OF CHANGE IN SOVIET LEADERSHIP 
? Senator MANSFIELD. If Khrushchev should be forced out of power, 
is it the thinking of the Russian experts in the Department that his 
successor is likely to be a man more amenable to friendly and peaceful 
dealings with the West? 
Secretary HERTER. That, sir, I cannot answer categorically. I 
think that that is a pure matter of guesswork. 
Senator MANsriELD. All right. 
What, in the view of our Russian experts, is the most probable 
coalition of influential forces in the Soviet Union and in world corn-
inunism that could bring about Khrushchev's downfall? 
Secretary HERTER. There, sir, I am afraid of my own knowledge I 
cpul cl not answer that. If you would like Mr. Bohlen to answer that, 
be is as good an authority as we have on the subject. 
Senator MANSFIELD. If you will, Mr. Bohlen. But before you do, 
T' would like to throw out indications that perhaps the military, the 
Chinese Communists and forces of that kind, might be considered. 
13oHLEN. Senator, I honestly in all sincerity think it is not 
possible to answer that question. I think in dealing with the Soviet 
Union in view of the general secrecy prevailing in the Communist 
bloc it is only after the event that you can hope to trace them back 
and see what particular influences have seemed to have brought about 
given decisions. There is literally no way in which a foreigner can 
ascertain what the varying degrees of influence of all factors which 
go into the making of any particular event. If I might I will give 
you one illustration of secrecy. I was not there but in June 1957 for 
10 days the Presidium of the Central Committee and the Central 
Committee itself met in a violent inner row which resulted in the 
expulsion from both of those bodies of Molotov, Kaganovich, Malen-
kov, and several others. 
This went on for 10 days in Moscow and no foreigner in the capital 
and mighty few Russians knew anything about it. 
We had trained observers there. There was an extremely alert 
U.S. press corps and not one of them got any inkling of this major 
development. This I merely cite to show the degree of secrecy and 
if you are trying to get these things you are in truth looking into a 
crystal ball and a very cloudy one at that. 
Senator MANSFIELD. What you have said, Mr. Bohlen, is a reinforce-
ment of thoughts you have previously stated in response to questions 
propounded to, you by the Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. BOHLEN. That's right, sir.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Senator MANSFIELD. And, once again, that secrecy is so great there 
that it is impossible for a westerner to find out What goes on in many 
instances until after the fact is accomplished. 
POSSIBILITY OF SOVIET RETURN TO DEPTHS OF THE COLD WAR 
Senator MA/ism:Li). Is it the view of the experts in the Department, 
the Russian experts, that Khrushchev, even if he remains in power, 
will now take a harder line, a reversion to cold war type tactics in 
dealing with the Western nations? 
Mr. BOBLEN. The indications at present are, and I am speaking at 
present, that this will not necessarily be so. 
I think we can expect a propaganda campaign. The indication 
from his own statements and from such information as we have re-
ceived from Moscow, is that there seems to be no determined policy to 
return to the depths of the cold war at this time. 
Senator MANsrunt?. Would you say that if that reversion does take 
place, taking the opposite tack from what you have just said, and is 
pushed by the Kremlin or Khrushchev or his successor, that it will 
make more difficult the maintenance of peace? 
Mr. BoutEx. It would if it returns to a line that we would call 
the lowest phase of the cold war, it most certainly would, Senator. 
However, there are degrees in this thing of return to the cold war sit-
uation which are impossible to assess and which might not materially 
increase the danger of war. But if it went all out, sealed off the 
Soviet Union and the Communist bloc from contact with the outside 
world, attempted to exert pressures wherever they thought they could 
do so, I think undoubtedly a much more dangerous world situation 
would be created. 
Senator MANstat,ro. Mr. Chairman, I have other questions but I 
don't want to take too much time. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hickenlooper ? 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. I don't have any questions at this time. 
he CHAIRMAN. Senator Humphrey did I overlook you? 
Senator HUMPHREY. I came in late, Senator. If any other Senator 
wants to go ahead, it is all right. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Morse, are you ready? 
Senator MORSE. I will yield to Senator Humphrey. 
SECRETARY HERTER'S KNOWLEDGE OF FLEGITTS 
Senator HUMPHREY. If the question I ask, Mr. Secretary, has al-
ready been asked, just brush it aside. I don't want to take any of 
your time on that. 
Did anyone ask as to whether or not you had any personal knowledge 
of the 1.3-2 flight? 
Secretary HERTER. Of the program? 
Senator ilitarruarly. No, of the particular flight. 
Secretary Hillanut. It was included, I said it was included?I am 
sure it was included in a group of flights that I had been asked 
whether I had any objections to them. 
Senator HUMPHREY. If you wanted to, could you have effectively 
vetoed such a policy? 
Secretary HERTER. No; I could only have given my advice to the 
President.

VICE PRESIDENT'S KNOWLEDGE OF FLIGHTS 
Senator HUMPHREY. Would the Vice President be aware of these 
decisions.? 
Secretary HERTER. I think that as a member of the National Secu-
rity Council, he was aware of the program in the larger sense. I doubt 
if he was familiar with any of the individual flights as such, but he 
may have been. 
Senator HUMPHREY. The reason I asked that question was that the 
Vice President intimated on a television program, I believe the day 
before the President's announcement in Paris, that the flights should 
continue. The next day the President announced that he had already 
canceled them. 
The Vice President said they would continue, and the next day the 
President announced that they had been suspended. 
What I am asking is, would the Vice President, as a member of the 
Security Council, have any opportunity of knowing the decision that 
had been made by the President? 
Secretary HERTER. There, the days followed so quickly one on an-
other that I just couldn't answer that, whether that opportunity would 
have been offered or not. 
Senator HUMPHREY. What I am trying to get at is the policy-
making machinery. 
We have a subcommittee as you know, that is studying the policy-
making machinery of the Government, the Jackson subcommittee. 
I am a member of that subcommittee. We had recently before the 
subcommittee Mr. Kennan. We have had many of the prominent 
officials of Government and former officials of Government. 
The program of the reconnaisance flights was an established pro-
gram, and apparently was agreed upon by the Security Council; is 
that correct? 
Secretary HERTER. The Security Council was aware of it, yes. 
Senator HUMPHREY. The Vice President is a member of the Secur-
ity. Council? 
Secretary FIERTER. Yes. 
Senator HUMPHREY. If the Vice President states on a television 
program that he understood that the flights would continue, yet the 
President announced the next day in Paris that as of the previous 
Thursday they had already been suspended, do you think there was 
any lack of communication between the responsibile officials of this 
Government? 
Secretary HERTER. There, sir, I am trying to think of the dates. 
The Thursday on which the President gave that order was the day 
that I went to Paris. I went to Paris that night. 
The President followed 2 nights later and whether or not in that 
2-day interval anything had been distributed with regard to that 
order, I just don't know. 
IMPACT ON SUMMIT DIPLOMACY OF RECENT EVENTS

retary, as to the value of the so-called summitry diplomacy as a

wroveil,FHgeltmpoltogra :sqmpFewp,RAR000l000nal 
Secretary HERTER. I think as a method of carrying out negotiations 
it has taken a hard knock. 
Senator IITTAIPITEEY. Have you any idea as to how we are going to 
proceed in the months ahead? I heard the President's address. It 
was a good address. Ile gave a good accounting. He talked about, the 
necessity of maintaining?I believe the word was businesslike relation-
-ships?or at least normal relationships insofar as we can with the 
Soviet Union. 
Is there any project ed plan as to how we will proceed with our 
contacts with the Soviet -Union? 
For example, we have the Geneva Conference still in session on 
the nuclear testing. I suppose the Disarmament Conference is still 
a reality. 
Ts there to be any adjustment, in these conferences, any changes? 
Are they to proceed according to the past? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, the President, I think, made that very clear 
in 11 is statement. 
Senator IIITMPTIRET . Are there any plans for any type of a high 
level Foreign Ministers' conference or conference of sub-Cabinet 
officers? 
Secretary HurrEtt. As of now, there is not. I may add this with 
regard to the summit ; that the four nations that were involved in the, 
summit, were the four nations who, as a result of the decisions and 
agreements reached after the war, were the four nations that have 
the responsibility for Berlin and for the final settlement of the whole 
German question, and that is the reason for those four, essentially, 
get i ing together. 
It is possible that again they-will have to get together. Whether 
normal diplomatic changes would make progress or Foreign Ministers' 
meetings in advance would make a program so that it would be worth-
while for them to come together, I just, can't tell you. That is always a, 
possibility. But almost an y other subject, there are many other nations 
thil are involved beside those four, and it is a great question in my 
mind whether or not that method of coming together for the resolution 
.of oroblPinq would be fruitful in the future. 
Senator Humettativ, in other words, what you are indicating is that 
a summit. conference merely ought to be the ratification, essentially the 
ratification, of decisions that have been tentatively arrived at, at the 
non-nal diplomatic levels. 
Secretary HERTER. In my opinion, that is the most desirable thing. 
CO rill\ DICTORY SOVIET ACTIONS 
Sena tor TITT1IPITEEY. 1 egree, How do you explain, or is there any 
explanation for what appears to be a contradictory bit f evidence of 
Gromyko's blustering up at the United Nations on the Soviet resolu-
tion and, yet, of the apparent conciliatory behavior of the Soviets 
in recent days with resoeet to the quick release of our plane and flyers 
who strayed into East Germany and the recent broadening of Soviet-
Ameri can exchange projects? 
Secretary ITEnTER. There again, you have got one of those contradic-
tions. As T was saying earlier, the fact that the attitude of the people 
in Moscow and even the oflieials with whom our Embassy officials have 
to deal, have been entirely normal since this incident.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SIJMMIT CONFERENCE 71 
It is very hard to reconcile with the very harsh words that both 
Khrushchev and Gromyko have uttered. 
SOVIET OBJECTIVES 
Senator IliarminEY. Do you lay any credence to the doctrine, or 
at least an observation that has been made, that while the Soviet 
tactics may change for awhile, that insofar as their general overall 
strategy is concerned, it will remain pretty much the same as it has? 
Secretary HERTER. Certainly as far as their objectives are con-
cerned. I think it was quite clear from some of this documentation 
that will be put into the record, that is the speeches that were made 
by Mr. Khrushchev, that he had laid greater and greater emphasis 
on. the eventual triumph of communism over the world, and that he 
put particular emphasis on that in recent months before the summit.. 
PREDICTIONS OF SOVIET ACTIONS 
Senator HIIMPIMEY. I have a letter from a gentleman who is a pro-
fessor emeritus of a university, up at Bennington College, who has: 
had an uncanny record in my years of acquaintanceship with him in-
understanding what goes on in the Soviet Union. His name is Dr, 
Bernard Tauer. He is a former Social Democrat of some 35 years 
ago from Austria' a professor of political economy, now retired. He 
monitors Soviet broadcasts, studies Soviet literature, particularly 
photographs and what-have-you. Just to give you a little back-
ground, he predicted to me some 3 weeks, I guess it was, before it 
luso happened, the removal of Beria. I have a letter here from him right 
before me, and it is a letter telling how Mr. Khrushchev was going 
to scuttle the summit conference, written on April 25, this letter is. 
And I also have a letter from him here in which he says: 
The Soviet leader will now do everything possible to prove that Eisenhower 
is a warmonger and an imperalist aggressor and not a man of peace, in action 
not merely in words. We must, therefore, prepare ourselves for all kind$ of 
provocations all around the world. 
His thesis is that Khrushchev had been selling the Soviet people 
upon the idea that President Eisenhower was a man of peace and 
a man with whom he could deal. I don't mean deal, in the sense of 
the crudeness of that word, but one with whom he could conduct 
reasonably good negotiations, and that when the President accepted 
the responsibility for the flights and didn't accept the opportunity, 
at least what some people say was an opportunity of removing himself 
from that responsibility, that Mr. Khrushchev took this as a very 
personal matter, since he had staked his reputation in the Kremlin 
and in the councils of the Communist Party upon the fact that he 
could work with Eisenhower. Then Mr. Khrushchev felt that Eisen-
hower had not only upset the diplomatic applecart, but, more impor-
tantly, from a subjective point of view?Khrushchev's?put Khru-
shchev in a very difficult position with the Communist Chinese, with 
the rightwing Stalinists in the Soviet Union, so that Khrushchev is 
now making a personal crusade out of attacking the President. 
1- What is your view of this? I am going to give you this letter. I 
have a whole series of these, and this is a very remarkable man, may 
I say.

72 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
For example, I have a letter from him 2 weeks before the recent 
shakeup in the Soviet; Union which was not too fundamental, but indi-
cating- some of the changes that were going to be made, by a very care-
ful analysis of broadcasts and meetings and literature. I had this 
man down to see the late Senator Walter George, some of you may 
recall, and he was very helpful at one time. What is your view of Mr. 
IKhrushcbey's reactions lately to the President, the personal venom 
that he seems to ex hi bit ? 
Secretary HERTER. I am particularly interested in two things, Sen-
ator, in the letter that you have just read; one, the .fact that it was 
written before the JI-2 incident. 
Senator Ili huriinny. Yes. 
Secret ary linnerna. In which this authority cites the fact that Mr. 
Khruslichev was going to scuttle the conference. 
Senator Hu MP I IR EY. 1. think that substantiates essentially what you 
were saying this torn ing, your own observations on this. 
Secretary I IERTER. Yes. The second has to do with the fact that 
the President didn't, accept the way out which Mr. .K hrushchev ap-
peared to offer him. Nly own feeling with regard to that second mat-
t or is that it was very much of a trap. That what Mr. Khrushchey 
thought might happen is that the President would disclaim personal 
responsibility and that then Mr. Khrushchey would say, "The situa-
tion is even more dangerous than I thought, because this means that 
I hat same, little frantic group in the Pentagon"?and that is the, phrase 
that he used in his press conference?"is running the Government. of 
the United States without the President knowing about it, and that 
makes our situation even worse" and he would have inveighed in 
exactly the same terms and asked the President for exactly the same 
apologies and punishments which he asked for later. 
I think that the element of personal pique certainly played a part in 
the whole show.

OTHER COUNTRIES REACTIONS TO SI TMMIT CONFEREN CE COLLAPSE 
The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry, the Senator from Vermont.. 
Senator AIKEN . I won't take long. 
Speaking of the reaction of the rest of the world, have you made 
any analysis of the reaction of the other countries of the world rela-
tive to the collapse of the summit meeting? 
Secretary IInirrnit. Yes, I think we have. It isn't, of course, com-
plete. This will mean a, study from a. great many nations and bring 
this altogether in one place. 
I think that, perhaps, the best indication has been the attitude 
among the representatives at the United Nations where you have got 
a cross section from the rest of the world. From the very outset of 
the, Russian complaint there it was very obvious they weren't; going 
to be able to get any votes from their calling this an aggression, 
except Soviet bloc votes. 
Some of the smaller countries, two of them, abstained in the final 
vote for reasons that were of a rather different nature.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 73 
But, by and large, we have heard no sympathy from the point of 
view of what you might call the uncommitted nations or the free 
nations of the world for the attitude that Mr. Khrushchev took. 
Senator AIKEN. Are you satisfied we have not lost prestige 
throughout the world as a result, or lost more than Russia has? 
Secretary HERTER. May I say, sir, that in my opinion our alli-
ances are firmer than they have ever been. 
SOVIET HIERARCHY 
Senator AIKEN. What was the significance of the shakeup in the 
Russian Government prior to the 111-2 incident, I believe last April, 
was it not, when Mr. Kozlov was promoted; and coupled with that 
question_, why don't we hear anything about Mr. Mikoyan any more? 
Has he been isolated or just gotten out of the news, or what has hap-
pened with him? 
Secretary HERTEL Mr. Bohlen, who is our expert, is also the cen-
sor of the document, so I am afraid he has gone out of the room at 
the moment. 
With regard to the disappearance of Mr. Mikoyan, we have been 
told this is just a normal vacation he has taken down to the Black 
Sea. It is true in years gone by he had taken rather extended vaca-
tions there, and whether this is true or not we can't say. 
With respect to the shakeup, I think the only significance that it 
had were that two of the strongest members of the central committee 
were sent to other responsibilities and this may have been a personal 
strengthening of Mr. Khrushchev's power within the committee 
itself. But it was not considered very highly significant. 
Senator AIKEN. That is, Mr. Kozlov's promotion is not significant? 
Secretary HERTER. I don't think so. I didn't know that he as such 
had been promoted. 
[Deleted.] 
A long time ago I think when. Mr. Averill Harriman was visiting 
in Russia he reported that Mr. Kozlov had been pointed out to him by 
Mr. Khrushchev as his successor, saying that he and Mikoyan were 
too old to carry on and that Kozlov was the No. 2 man. But there 
was no telling whether he was saying that seriously or whether he was 
being flattering about it because Mr. Kozlov was there at the time. 
Senator AIKEN. I thought he made the best impression of any of 
our Russian visitors last summer. At least when he came before this 
committee, I thought he did. 
I have no further questions.

FUNCTION OF NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 
Senator MORSE. Mr. Secretary? I think it would be helpful for this 
record if you made a statement in regard to the functions of NASA, 
and the part that NASA played in connection with the U-2 flight. 
I don't think the record is very clear as to what are the functions of 
NASA, and what jurisdiction, if any, the State Department has over 
NASA and what the relationship between NASA and the National 
Security Council is, and the State Department.

74 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Secretary HERTER, NASA, as you know, is an agency devoted en-
tirely to the peaceful development of satellites and outer space ve-
ii
ides of one kind or another. 
Its operations have now been separated out from what were called 
purely military operations, although it is always inevitable in the 
development, of boosters that there should be an interrelationship 
between the two, because the military vehicle and the peaceful vehicle 
have got the same problems of propulsion to get. up into the air. The 
w itnesses of NASA, of course, will be before the con infi ttee. 
[Deleted.] Most of the I7-2's are used by NASA in connection 
with purely scientifie work, meteorological work. Actually, the 
Japanese Government -foufal them tremendously valuable in tracing 
the course of tornadoes last year, and 1 think that NASA put out. at 
least three publications on their findings from the II-2 weather 
ol yservations.

NASA, I am sorry to say that-, I can't give you firsthand information. 
Perhaps Mr. Dillon can supplement. that as ii, occurred while I 
WaS overseas and when M r. Dillon was in charge. 
Mr. IntEoN. All 1 can say is as far as I know the State Depart-

and the relationships that there were, were handled by the Central 
Intelligenee Agency i deleted], so either Mr. Dulles or the NASA 
witnesses I hemselves will lw able to inform you on that. 
Senator MORSE. Why would NASA make a statement in regard to 
this plane if it was under the. jurisdiction of CIA ? 
Mr. ilii,EoN. On the cover story it was in the open, the plane was 
under the. jurisdiction of NASA. Actually for this operation it was 
under the jurisdiction of CIA. [Deleted.] 
Senator MORSE. Therefore, NASA, in your opinion, was acting 
within the proprieties when it issued the statement that it issued. 
Mr. DILLoN. I think so; yes. 
Senator MoRsn. You think it had cleared that statement. with CIA 
or had authority Irani CI A to issue it.

ment, CIA, Pentagon Building, and now NASA, and that there may 
be a need for a centralization in the State Department of the authority 
to authorize any statement by any of these agencies in regard to a 
situation such as this, because of some possible reason to believe that 
if this had been centralized more we would not have been having 
different statements coming from different agencies. 
Mr. DILLON. We were not aware, actually, of the fact that NASA 
was going to make as formal a statement as this, and it was somewhat 
of a surprise. 
The CHAIRMAN. I could not hear that answer. 
Mr. DILLoN. I say we were not aware of the fact that NASA was 
going to make such a formal statement as this, and I am not sure 
that the Central Intelligence Agency was either. 
All the relationships as I said in my original statement, there was 
coordination, there was a decision that the statements were going to 
be made by the State Department. 
That decision was taken and made known to the other agencies 
concerned, which were the Department of Defense, and the Central 
Intelligence Agency then on the morning of May 5. 
The Central Intelligence Agency had the relationships with NASA 
and undertook to pass that on. We had no relationships with NASA. 
They didn't know we were in this thing, and somehow this statement 
was put out by NASA somewhat more complete than we expected 
but it was along the lines of the material that they had been furnished. 
VICE PRESIDENT'S KNOWLEDGE OF FLIGHTS 
*1800 Senator Mons& Turning to a question that Senator Humphrey 
asked?and may I assure you that I am quite nonpolitical in raising 
that?I am only seeking to find out who had knowledge of what in 
regard to the matter. Prefer to the May 27 issue of the Washington 
Post, in an article by Mr. Chalmers Roberts in the course of which 
he said : 
Nowhere in the 31/2-hour television program did Nixon refer to any Presidential 
direction in the U-2 crisis, other than his approval of the flights some years 
earlier. Nor was there any reference to his own part in the affair. Nixon, of 
course, sits in the National Security Council. Nixon did say that he was 
"privy" to the U-2 reconnaissance policy "and I do endorse it." He also said 
that "I knew about this flight." 
Now, my interpretation, Mr. Secretary, of your testimony is that 
neither you nor the President knew this specific flight was going to be 
taken at the time that it was taken, but that you did know that there 
Was a general program for such flights and that this flight could be 
considered as a part of that program. 
, NOW I ask you, do you have any reason to believe that Nixon knew 
anything that you and the President did not know and that maybe it 
is just an unfortunate use of language when he says "I knew about this 
flight," and that he probably means that he knew about the general 
program of reconnaissance? 
Secretary HERTER. I would assume it was about the general pro-
gram rather than about the particular flight.

N tr( I,EAR ARMAMENT RACE 
Senator MORSE. One filial question at this round, Mr. Secretary: As 
you know I, along with everyone else, I think, who has the interest of 
peace at heart, am very much concerned about long continuation of 
tit is nuclear armament raee. 
Do you think that the 1Tnited States and the Western Powers on the 
one hand and Russia on the other can continue this nuclear armament 
race with its constant increase and acceleration for another 10 years 
and not create the great probability of war? 
Secretary HERTER. I don't know about the great probability of war, 
Senator, but I would say certainly increase the chances of war. 
Senator MORSE. I know we are of one mind but I want the record to 
show this particular one mind: Do you agree with me that our genera-
tion simply has the responsibility in history to find some honorable 
way to end this nuclear armament race? 
Secretary HERTER. I agree with you completely on that. 
Senator MORSE. Do you think that we ought to do everything that 
we can to try to get the United Nations to exercise greater jurisdic-
tional authority in connection with this whole matter of armament 
race than we have been able to get it to do so far? 
Secretary HERTER. Senator, some time ago I made a speech in con-
nection with disarmament in which I stated my views as to the great 
necessity in the following years to finding some answer to this, and 
at, the same time finding an answer within the framework of the 
United Nations of an authority which could maintain the peace with 
law, and I still feel that just as strongly as I did at the time I made 
that speech.

(The following information was subsequently furnished for the 
record:) 
STATEMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE: INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE 
CONTENTIOUSCASES PROPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES AGAINST SOVIET-BLOC 
COUNTRIES 
1. The United States has proposed to the Soviet Union the adjudication of four 
separate cases concerning aerial incidents. In each of these cases, the United 
States has filed with the Registry of the International Court of Justice an 
application instituting proceedings. These were the following cases: (a) Treat-
ment in Hungary of aircraft and crew of United States of America (United 
States V. ; (b) aerial incident of October 7, 1952 (United States V. 
U.S.S.R.) ; (c) aerial incident of September 4, 1954 (United States v. U.S.S.R.) ?, 
and (d) aerial incident of November 7, 1354 (United States v. U.S.S.R.). Each 
of these four cases has been dismissed by the Court for lack of jurisdiction. 
The Court lacked jurisdiction because the Soviet Union has never accepted the 
compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under article 36(2) of its statute nor 
agreed to jurisdiction specially In any case. 
2. The United States also instituted proceedings before the International Court 
of Justice in cases against Hungary and Czechoslovakia. These were: (e) 
Treatment in Hungary of aircraft and crew of United States of America (United 
States v. Hungarian People's Republic) ; and (f) aerial incident of March 10, 
1953 (United States v. Czechoslovakia). Each of these cases was also dis-
missed by the Court for lack of jurisdiction. Again, the reason was that neither 
Hungary nor Czechoslovakia has ever accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in 
any way. 
3. The United States also instituted proceedings before the International Court 
of Justice in a case against Bulgaria, the aerial incident of July 27, 1955 (United 
States v. Bulgaria). This case differed from those above in that Bulgaria had 
accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the former Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice in 1921, and it was the contention of the United States that 
Bu'garia was subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the present International 
Court of Justice by virtue of article 36(5) of this Court's statute. Bulgaria 
challenged the jurisdiction of the Court on several grounds, including a decision 
of the Court in another ease arising out of the same aerial incident that Bulgaria 
is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court, and a reciprocal invocation of the 
United States domestic jurisdiction reservation. The United States has moved 
to discontinue the case. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Kansas. 
DEVALUATION OF SOVIET CURRENCY 
Senator CARLSON. Mr. Secretary, recently one of our Nation's finan-
cial writers, writing on the conditions in Russia, wrote that Mr. 
Khrushchev was proposing a devaluation of the currency as of Janu-
ary 1, and he stated that no nation tampers with its currency unless 
it is in financial difficulty. 
What do we know about the financial and economic condition of 
Russia that would lead us to believe or know that he is planning on 
devaluating the currency? 
Secretary HERTER. This I hadn't heard at all. I hadn't seen that 
particular statement and I have seen nowhere in any report any indi-
cations that they were planning to devalue their currency. 
There is no question but that their foreign exchange rate, their 
official rate, doesn't correspond with reality. They have two rates, 
one an official rate and one a tourist rate. They are very far apart. 
One is 4 rubles to the dollar and one is 10 rubles to the dollar. But 
from the point of view of their internal financial situation, I have 
heard no reports they were planning to devalue the ruble.

INTERNAL CONDITIONS IN SOVIET IJNION 
Senator CARLSON. We have had evidence that there is social unrest 
among the people, that they are thinking that they are entitled to 
better living conditions, better homes and housing. 
Do we have any evidence, of that? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes; 1 think there is. But this is a matter that 
Mr. lett testified to a, few moments ago. 
Senator CARLSON. That there is? 
Secretary HERTER. There is evidence of that. As Mr. Bohlen said, 
it is impossible to get documentary evidence, as such, because of the 
secrecy and the discipline in their society, but I think that every 
visitor to :Russia who has had a chance to talk with the workmen or 
the students at the university and so on, has come back with that. 
feeling. 
After all, Mr. Khrushchev has made a good many statements about 
the necessity of increasing the standard of living of their people. 
In their incentives that they offer from the point of view of their 
-workers, better living conditions in these housing projects is one of 
the principal incentives that they have been offering in the past,. 
giving people priority if their particular sections of a plant do par-
ticularly well from the point of view of production, they will be 
advanced to better living quarters. 
think that the lure for better living quarters and a better stand-
ard of living, more consumer goods, is a very real one. 
SOVIET REDUCTION IN ARMED FORCES AND LABOR SIIORTAGE 
Senator CAutsox. Does the State Department have any evidence of 
a labor shortage in Russia based on a statement that was recently 
made that Mr.Khrushchey reduced his military strength because it 
was necessary to get some of the people back into the labor market?: 
Secretary :HERTER. Yes. Very recently there has been a study that 
think will be made available to you, made on the whole question of 
the labor problem in Russia. 
(The, study referred to appears on p. 283 in appendix ) 
It' is an extremely interesting one :from the point of view of the 
present situation and the relationship of women at work compared 
with men and the very large excess number of women over men that 
exists in Russia today. 
There is certainly every reason to believe that Mr. KThrushchey's 
announced reduction of the armed forces was an effort to increase the 
male labor force by taking the extra men out of the armed services 
when he said he was planning to reduce from sonic 3,600,000 down to 
2,400,000; that the principal purpose of that was to get a larger' 
working force.

QUESTION OF PRESS SECRETARY FIAGERTY'S KNOWLEDGE OF SUSPENSION OF 
FLIGHTS 
Senator GORE. On this question of coordination or lack thereof, in 
addition to NASA and the State Department, to which Senator Morse 
referred, there is the State Department, CIA, NASA, Mr. Hagerty, 
and officials within the Department and perhaps others. 
Did Mr. Hagerty operate in this field strictly as press secretary or 
did he undertake son me Executive function? 
Secretary HERTER. I know of no Executive function that he 
assumed. 
ISSUANCE OF STATE DEPARTMENT AND NASA STATEMENTS OF MAY 5 
Senator GORE. Mr. Dillon, on May 5 Mr. Hagerty, I understand, 
told a press conference that the State Department and NASA would 
issue statements. Were you aware of this? 
Mr. IDuktox. I have very recently learned that he indicated that 
NASA would issue a statement as such. 
It was decided that the State Department would issue a statement. 
I hadn't been aware that he had said we were. But it had been de-
cided and he knew it had been decided that we were going to do it. 
Senator GORE. You say you very recently learned this. How 
recently? 
Mr. DILLON. I think a day ago or 2 days ago that someone from the 
press said that he had told the press when they were there that 
NASA would issue a statement, so that they could get their infor-
mation from NASA. 
Senator GORE. Did Mr. Hagerty suggest to you that the State De-
partment issue a statement? 
Mr. Dumox. No, it was decided when we first heard of this, this 
news, as I said earlier this morning, at this National Security Council 
meeting or right after it that was held outside of Washington, that 
the State Department would handle the publicity on this, and that 
we would make any statement that would be made, and it was known 
at that time that we would make a statement. 
Now Mr. Hager i y was not at the Security Council meeting, but 
he was at that area out there where this exercise was taking place 
and so he was aware of the fact that the State Department would 
be making a statement at noon that day at our regular press con-
ference time. 
Actually, the statement was delayed 45 minutes. It was made at 
12 :45 when our regular daily press conference took place. 
Senator GORE. Was it decided there that NASA would make a 
statement also? 
Mr. Dittox. It was not to my knowledge, no. It was not decided 
there that NASA would make a statement. 
Senator GORE. Who made that decision? 
Mr. Dittox. I think that you have to ask NASA. I don't know 
who made any such decision. 
The fact is, as I have said earlier, I thought that NASA would 
answer questions. 
I didn't know they were going to make a statement until I saw it.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT cora htsziNt,z, 
Senator GORE. You don't know whether NASA or whether Mr. 
Hagerty made that decision? 
Mr. DILLON. I have no idea no. I would assume NASA made it 
because we did know that NA SA would have to answer questions 
because this was a NASA plane that was lost and the reporters were 
going to find out how high the plane flew, what kind of a plane it 
was, anything they knew about it, and we had given them?the Intel-
ligence Agency had given them good answers on how to answer such 
questions. 
Senator GORE. You say you assume this. You did not know it? 
Mr. DILLON. I knew they had given them that material. I knew 
that as a fact, but we did not know that they were going to use that 
and put in into the form of a statement as it actually came out. 
Senator GORE. But Mr. Hagerty did know that a statement by 
NASA would be made? 
Mr. DILLoN. I don't know that what he said meant that he knew 
they were going to make a formal statement or whether he was just 
using that as a phrase, indicating that they would answer questions. 
He may have thought they were going to make a statement. I just 
don't know that. He may have called them up and asked them. I 
don't know. 
Senator GORE. Did, in fact, both the State Department and NASA

PREMIER KHRUSIICHEV'S KNOWLEDGE OF OVERFLIGHTS 
Senator LAUSCHE. When did the Camp David meeting take place 
with Khrushchev ? 
Secretary HERTER. I am terribly sorry?
Senator LAUSCHE. When did the Camp David meeting take place 
with Khrushchev ? 
Secretary HERTER. That was in September as I recall it. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Did Khrushchev, before May 1, make any state-
ments indicating that the Soviet had knowledge of American recon-
naissance planes over their territory? 
Secretary HERTER. None. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Based upon his statements and upon the knowl-
edge which he claims the Soviet possess, what day was it that he 
understood the first American plane flew over the Soviet? 
Secretary HERTER. I can't identify that. My recollection is that 
when he was in Paris he made the statement that he knew about these 
overflights at the time that he was at Camp David and that he thought 
there was something fishy about President Eisenhower at that time. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Well, then at Camp David he did state that at 
that time he knew that our planes were flying over the Soviet.

Secretary linurER. That is what he said later when he got to Paris. 
senator LA USCI1E. When he got to Paris? 
Secivtary HERTER. When he got to Paris. Ile never mentioned it 
at Camp David or at any time between Camp David and Paris. 
Senator .1,Atsci IE. Well, if he knew at Camp Dav id that our recon-
naissance planes were flying over the Soviet, and he said nothing about 
1.1., can you give any reason for his remaining silent, on the subject? 
Seerotary _HERTER. Ile was asked that question in a press confer-
ence in Paris. 
1 haven't got 'here, the exact words of response but T think we could 
dig them out for you, and tell you just what he said in answer to that 
hinisolf, but as I recollect, he said he felt that this was an inat-ipro-
pri ate moment to bring it up but that he did think there was some-
thing fishy about the President at that time. 
Seal or LAUS(11 IE. Then at Camp David, when fie, knew that our 
planes were flying over his land, he was discussing what was to be 
the summit conference; is that correct? 
Secretary llturrErt. What he hoped would be the summit conference. 
Senator 14.11.7S(11 E. And if we take him at his word, at that time he 
hoped to have, a summit conference although he knew then that we 
were supposedly committing a :flagrant transgression against his 
rights. 
Secretary linfrinu. That is correct., from his own later testimony. 
Senator LAuscun. Can you reconcile those two positions as both 
being true, one that he honestly intended to attend a summit confer-. 
ence and, two, that he knew our planes were flying over his land? 
Secretary HERTER. No, it would be very difficult to reconcile the two. 
It is very difficult particularly to reconcile the tremendous issue that, 
he made of it later when he knew about it all the time, according to 
his own statement. 
Senat or A IKEN. Will the Senator yield? You will find on page 16 
of the Background Docume.nts Khrushchev's statement that Twining, 
the then Chief of Staff, sent a plane over Russia which went over 
Kiev the day after he. left Russia. It is the third paragraph on page 
16. (See appendix 1, p. 191.) 
Senator LAnsen K. Yes. Your recollection is that the meeting took 
place last September. 
Secretary Iluartin Yes, sir. 
Senator LAusoun. Now then, from September to May 14, was that 
the day he came to Paris, he said nothing about this knowledge that 
he had, was supposed to have had while he was at Camp David. 
Secretary }TEETER. That is my recollection. I would want to check 
on that. It is possible that he may have said something at the Presi-
dium meeting before he left Moscow. My expert; here tells me he did 
not, and that, was my recollection that he had never nientioned it, until 
he got to Paris. 
Senator LA TISCH E. Can one, rationalize the furor of his resentment 
in May of 1960 compared to his admitted silence at Camp David about 
similar flights? 
Secretary Man-En. No; one cannot.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
INFORMATION GATHERING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN 
TIIE U.S.S.R. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Now then, last January 18, Allen Dulles ap-
peared before our committee, and at that time he merely scratched on 
the surface what I thought was a very vital question: the compara-
tive ease with which the Soviet gets information in the United States-
and the impregnable wall that bars us from getting news in the Soviet. 
I ask you the question, Mr. Herter, to give your understanding of 
the facility with which we get information out of the Soviet, and that 
which they get out of the United States. 
Secretary HERTER. Senator, as you know, we have what we call an 
open society. We are very proud of it in which we have complete 
freedom of the press, in which, except for matters of highest security,. 
very freely talked about, and a great deal is published. 
Our technical magazines publish a great deal from the point of view 
of vital military information. Our installations in this country, while 
no direct overflights are permitted, can be photographed with com-
parative ease from an angle of one side. 
Generally speaking we have had no restrictions at all on travel 
in the United States except for a few very small circumscribed areas, 
like the Atomic Energy Agency plants, and we have had restrictions 
on Soviet citizens traveling in this country which have been taken 
entirely as a retaliatory measure because of the limitations put on the 
travel of Americans in Russia. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Right. 
Secretary HERTER. The Soviet society, as you know, is a closed 
society, where one moves and goes only where they tell you you can 
go or when they tell you you can go. 
Senator LAUSCHE. This morning in answer to a question, assuming 
that a Soviet plane was over the United States and what we -would 
do about it, you said that there is no need of them sending planes for 
reconnaissance purposes because they can get the information without, 
going through that effort. 
Secretary HERTEL That is quite so. 
Senator LAUSCIIE. That is, they can go to Cape Canaveral and 
pretty simply see what is going on there. 
Secretary HERTER. Well, sir, there are newspaper men down at Cape 
Canaveral all the time and a good many visitors. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Now the fact is that: 
The Soviets still consider that secrecy and the security of everything relating' 
to their military operations is one of their great assets, and they have no 
Intention whatever of changing that. Moreover they have no intention of letting 
us into areas of miltary importance. 
Those are the words of Dulles. 
That is, there is a difference between the Soviet getting information 
here and our getting it in the Soviet. 
Secretary HERTER. Oh, a very gTeat difference. It is the whole 
difference between an open and a closed society.

PROPOSED PASSPORT LEGISLATION 
Senator LAUSCHE. You have been asking for this Congress to pass 
a bill that would give the State Department some, limited control 
over Communists going to the Soviet Union. Is that correct? 
Secretary HERTER. That is correct. 
Senator LAUSCHE. And why have you asked that? 
Secretary HERTER. Because we felt that we ought to have some 
control--these are American citizens traveling abroad?that we ought 
to have some control over those who may be going to various parts of 
the world in interest inimical to those of the United States. 
Senator LAUSCHE. And you asked that because you have in mind 
the grave dangers that, lie in the ability of a Communist to distribute 
information in the Soviet Union when he makes the visit, if he so 
desires. 
Secretary IIERTim. Yes, sir. 
Senator LAUSCHE. That bill has not been acted upon; is that correct.? 
Secretary HERTER. That is correct. 
POWERS OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
Senator LAUSCHE. Is there any type of legislation that you feel that 
we ought to pass with respect to the curtailment of the duties and the 
powers of the Central Intelligence Agency or the expansion of them. 
If you have given that subject no thought, you can state it. 
Secretary HERTER. I have given it no thought. I hope there would 
be no change so far as the activities are concerned. [Deleted.] 
Senator LAUSCHE. That is all I have. 
ALLEGED FRENCH NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT OF OVERFLIGHTS 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, there was one statement that I was 
told when I was in Paris that an account of overflights of the Russian 
territory had been carried in a French newspaper some 30 to 60 days 
prior to that. 
Have you ever heard of such account? 
Secretary HERTER. I think I heard the same reports in Paris but I 
never saw any documentary proof of it. 
The CHAIRMAN. Have any of your people tried to confirm it? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, but I have not heard it mentioned by any-
OPO except when I was over in Paris, too. I had not heard a word 
before that. 
KHRUSHCHEV'S MAY 5 REFERENCE TO OVERFLIGHTS 
The CHAIRMAN. [ 1)eleted.] 
In his speech of May 5, Mr. Khrushchey referred to the U.S. over-
flights of July 2, 1956, April 9, 1960, and May 1, 1960. He said that 
the April 9 flight caused concern within the Soviet G-overnment and 
resulted in admonishments to the Soviet military not to let it happen 
again.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE Id 
KHRUSHCHEVIS INTERPRETATION REGARDING CONTINUANCE 
OF OVERFLIGHTS 
The CHAIRMAN. This, again raises this point that puzzles me very 
much. The evidence is quite Clear that Mr. Khrushchev, if he didn't 
know positively, certainly suspected that it was our planes that were 
going across his territory, didn't he 
Secretary HERTER. That is what I assume. 
The CHAIRMAN. And it comes back to this point that he hadn't 
raised such a terrible fuss about it until this one, that is, the May 1 
flight, which was shot down. And, you said you couldn't reconcile 
the difference in his attitude toward the prior flights to the attitude 
toward the May 1 flight. But doesn't the reconciliation, if it is ex-
plainable at all?I am just asking you if there is one?does it not lie in 
the fact that our Government did take the position regarding the May 
1 flight and this program, that this is a deliberate program which we, 
the President, takes responsibility for, and which we intend to 
continue? 
Secretary HERTER. Not which we intend to continue. That has 
never been said. 
The CHAIRMAN. He interpreted it as such. Mr. Khrushchev in his 
statement, which I have a copy of here?this is his language. He 
says?this is a quote from part of our Background Documents (see 
p. 204, appendix 1) which says: 
At his press conference, Herter made an outrageous statement. Far from 
feeling guilty and ashamed of aggressive actions, he justifies them and says 
that this will continue in the future. Only countries which are in a state of 
war can act in this way. * * * Herter's statement has made us doubt the cor-
rectness of our earlier conclusions that the President, the American Government, 
did not know about the flights. Herter's statement says that this intelligence 
plan was endorsed by the Government. 
At least that is the way he interpreted it, and, as we said before--
Senator LAusenn. Who is "he"? Who interpreted it? 
The CHAIRMAN. This is a quote from Mr. Khrushchev's statement. 
Ile is interpreting what Mr. Herter said as speaking for the Govern-
ment. But is this not at least a possible reconciliation of the differ-
ence in attitude between the prior flights and the May 1 flight? 
Secretary HERTER. It might be if one wanted to interpret the words 
that I spoke that way. There was no need of his interpreting those 
words that way. Certainly from what I said, that is a very far-
'fetched interpretation. I think he was interpreting it for his own 
purposes that way. I think that the one reconcilable feature between 
those two things is that in one case he had specific evidence and in the 
other case he did not. 
The CHAIRMAN. Then it is your position that neither your state-
ment nor the President's press conference can legitimately be inter-
preted as an endorsement and justification of the flights and a policy 
of pursuing them in the future? 
Secretary HERTER. Certainly not the policies of pursuing them in 
the future. The President's statement that was made in Paris said 
it was perfectly clear from what I had said and from what he had said 
that there was nothing that allowed that inference. 
The CHAIRMAN. Did you in your background news conference in 
Paris on Sunday, May 15, repeat the same statement that you had 
made prior thereto in Washington?

Secret ary HERTER. I was asked at that background_ press conference. 
whether or not I had made a statement that we would continue doing 
tins. _I repeated the very words that I had used in my statement. I 
said I stood on those. That, did not imply -that we would continue. 
The CHAIRMAN. Prior to that second statement, Mr. Khrusbehev 
had so interpreted it. Were you aware that, he had so interpreted it 
in his statement to the Presidium? 
Secretary HERTER. I think I may have been, but, if one took cog-
nizance of every interpretation of his of everything that happens in 
this country one would be spending all one's time trying to correct 
his statements. 
The CHAIRMAN. You believe that it is an unreasonable and far-
fetched interpretai ion of your statement or the President's in his press 
conference. that these would be continued; is that correct ? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, I do. 
The CHAIRMAN. IS it or is it not a fact that the press in this country 
interpreted it, in that same fashion ? 
Secret ary HERTER. I am told that some did am I some, did not. 
The CHAIRMAN. It might have been wise for us to clarify at. that. 
time so that we interpreted it. properly; don't you think? 
Secretary HERTER. That, as I think T have indicated earlier, re-
ferred to the cessation of the flights and not resuming the fliohts. 
Tho President had reserved to state, in Paris in conlunction with the 
fact that he was going to offer at the United Nations his plan for 
aerial supervision of all nations that would be willing to submit to it. 
The Cr:FA-tint-AN. Do vou believe ti iat any head of sinte,, of any 
important, nal ion a ( je. 4, could proceed with negotiations at a eon-

The CHAIRMAN. For the record, in order that, it is clear what is? 
lavolved here, I would like to rettd one sentence, the one that is 
referred to by Mr. Ichrushchev, which I think you clarified. I quote 
from, the statement, that: was made by the Department of State on 
May 7 (see p. 187, appendix l) : 
The necessity for such activities as measures for legitimate national defense' 
is enhanced by the excessive secrecy practiced by the Soviet nion in contrast 
to the free world. 
think that is the statement that led to the interpretation, don't 
Von? 
Secretary HERTER. I am sorry, sir. I have, got before me, now the 
statement of May 7. Which were those words? 
'The CHAIRMAN. It appears on page 12 of the background docu-
ments prepared by the staff, the first paragraph at: the top of page 12. 
Secretary HERTER. That does not in any way intimate that: they 
would go on. 
The CHAIRMAN. You do not believe that that could reasonably be 
interpreted as meaning that they will continue? 
Secretary HERTER. No.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
KHRUSIICHEV'S SPEECII AT BAKU 
Senator WILEy. Mr. Secretary, I have listened to this examination, 
and as you brought out, Mr. Chairman, I think that what we had 
better do is get down to what I think is the basic issue, not what 
was said or particularly done, but let's see what Khrushchev did. 
On April 28, in what has been called the speech at Baku, an exam-
ination of that speech shows clearly that the Soviet Government had 
come to the conclusion that it would get nowhere at the summit 
conference. Now, listen to this: 
Overnight all the Government-controlled radio stations?
and get the date, May 25?
all the controlled radio stations and newspapers in the Soviet Union began 
to prepare the people for a summit failure, and flatly blamed the West. The 
same bitter tones which Khrushchev used in Paris is to be noted in what he 
said at Baku. 
And Baku was days before. 
In a violent attack in Baku on Secretary IIerter and Under Secretary Dillon, 
.on that same day, the Soviet Premier intimated that he planned to use military 
power to enforce the prospective seizure in the West. 
I quote Khrushchev: 
If, therefore, the Western Powers should not wish to sign a peace treaty 
with the German Democratic Republic, that would not preserve for them the 
rights on whose preservation they insist. They would then obviously lose the 
right of access to West Berlin by land, water, or air. 
In another portion of his speech, the Soviet Premier practically 
admitted that he had no hope of reaching any agreement at the sum-
VW :mit conference. 
He said:. 
The nearer May 16, the day of the meeting of the heads of Government, ap-
proaches, the more one-sided becomes the approach of certain statesmen of 
the Western Powers to the problems the participants of the conference will 
have to face. 
Then he goes ahead and gives examples attacking Herter and 
KIIRUSIICIIEV'S DECISION TO SCUTTLE CONFERENCE 
Now- I want to quote this. This morning I called your attention to 
this young Russian that stepped out from the intelligence department 
of the Russian Government, who was heard on the radio. He said, 
.and I quote: 
The Soviet Communist regime is in no way interested in allowing so popular 
:a man as the American President to come to the Soviet Union. They are 
definitely afraid of the impact such a visit can make on the people. 
Now if the issue is what caused Khrushchev to shoot his wad, so 
to speak, I think it is very clear that when he found out, one,
that he 
couldn't make an impression upon his associates who were to be at 
the conference; two, that Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese were un-
happy and Mao Tse-tung laced him up and down about this confer-
ence, as the record shows, when -he found Out that they didn't want it; 
three, that he was having trouble with his own gang in Russia; and, 
four, that the youth of Russia were simply getting all fed up?he

decided before he went to Paris that he was going to let the balloon 
go up. 
It wasn't the question of 15-2. That may have given him the os-
tensible opportunity to blow his top, but, as a matter of fact, he was: 
all ready to go days before. 
PROCEDURAL DISCUSSION 
Now if that is the fact, and I think it is sustained by the people 
who weigh the evidence, then there is no need of our inquiring into, 
what some folks feel. They may be a little remiss hither and yon in 
our own public service. They were laboring under deep pressure. 
When you put yourself in the President's boots and go over there 
and see what he took, you have to say, "God bless him. He held his 
temper and he handled himself so that he made, all America and all 
the world proud," and the result was as suggested, as the record now 
shows. Look at the U.N., look at Britain, what they say about it.. 
And the answer, I think, is that we should just about stop our in-
vestigation and not try to ball up further the issue. 
The CHAIRMAN. For the record I will say that the President, yes-
terday morning, heartily endorsed this inquiry. 
Sell at( yr Win EY. That what? 
The CHAIRMAN. The President himself said in my presence that 
he I Wall ily endorsed this inquiry, and if the Senator wishes to take 
issue with the President, why I suggest he talk to him about it. 
Senator WILEY. Oh, no. I heard him say that. I am not disputing 
his saying it. I am just simply saying that where do we go from here 
now? 
Are we going further, are we going to try to ball up the agency 
that gets the information, that has done such a tremendous job, that 
for 31?; years has given us information. 
[Deleted.] 
The CHAIRMAN. I. think the Senator misunderstands the purpose of 
this meeting. It is not, to ball up anything. It is to try to clarify a 
Situation for the benefit of the committee and the Senate and the. 
country. And I know of no one who has the slightest purpose, of ball-
ing up anything. 
Has the Senator completed his questions? 
Senator WILEY. Yes, I am sorry that I used that expression. What 
I meant was "confuse," and if there is going to be further evidence, 
would you mind telling me who the next witness is? 
The CHAIRMAN. There will be no other witnesses this afternoon. 
Senator WILEY. Well, do you expect to call some later on? 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes, Mr. Dulles is coming on Tuesday. 
Senator Mansfield?is the Senator through? 
Senator WILEY. No, that is the point I am making. I want to state 
in all sincerity, gentlemen, it is your responsibility if you want to call 
this man who has created this agency under the mandate of the Con-
gress, that we have appropriated money for, and have not tied his 
hands and he is the one who brought about this; let 'us be frank.

of testimony is going to go in the public record. There was no inten-

top, but I am simply telling you in the interests of my country, I think 
you should not call in this other agency. I think that these gentlemen 
have told what the public knows now, but to bring in this other 
agency, I think would be a mistake.

you want to know what is going on what have they got the television 
out there for and you are quoted every day as appearing before it. 
Let's be frank. This is not the only committee where they spill the 
beans. But I am talking about the Central Intelligence Agency, 
gentlemen. I happen to know something about it, and I know what 
it means, and people over in the House know what it means, and I

JURISDICTION OVER THE AIRSPACE AND THE HIGH SEAS 
Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Secretary, in an attempt to clarify some 
of the confusion which exists in some of our minds I would like to ask 
vs) some questions: 
What is your present official interpretation of international law as 
regards the extension of national sovereignty skyward? 
Secretary HERTER. I don't think we have any. 
Senator MANSFIELD. We have no international law in that field as 
yet? 
Secretary HERTER. That I know of. There is no definition as to 
what is considered the atmosphere above the air. There is no ac-
cepted interpretation or verbiage when they are talking about the 
atmosphere. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Would you think it advisable to have an inter-
national conference or conferences to decide the question of sover-
eignty in the air over a country and also the possibility of regulating 
the seas in a more orderly fashion? 
? Secretary HERTER. Well, as you know, we have tried for over a 
year to get the United Nations to get the outer space committee 
organized and underway. 
Senator MANSFIELD. At our suggestion? 
Secretary HERTER. At our urging. We have been urging that this 
be done. We have been pressing it. We have not been able to make 
any headway because the Russians refused to go along. There have 
been further discussions of this proposal but we have been unable to 
agree on who should carry it out. I think we are making progress 
but it is still one of those things where there is a constant dispute as 
to what should be done. 
Not only that but we had hoped to get it adjusted in time so that

cause you're dealing with, new matters that the scientists are expert 
ID that the layman is not and the Soviets were unable even to allow 
the, calling of that congress. 
Senator MANSFIELD. No. ln other words, as yet there is no clari-
fieation of this particular matter. 
Getting back to my statement concerning reguilation of the seas, 
of course, operate under the doctrine of freedom of the seas. 
But what I have in mind is the fact that it is my understanding that 
the Soviet Union ran launch missiles anywhere it wants to up within,, 
say, three miles of our coastline if it is in our vicinity, and we have 
the same. right under international law to fire missiles up to 3 miles, 
say of Vladivostok. Is that correct.? 
Secret ary HERTER. Yes, and it depends again on what one takes as 
the territorial waters. Three miles have been the generally accepted 
territorial limit. The Soviet Government has claimed 12 miles and, 
as yon know, the recent Geneva, Conference failed in reaching agree-
ment among the nations as to what should constitute the territorial 
water of different, nations. 
Sonic nations have gone ranch farther than that, particularly 
with regard to fishing rights. 
Serertor \I 'i That's right, but what I have in mind is that 
tunes have changed eonsiderably, even in our generation. 
Mir. Chairman, inay we have order in the committee ? 
The (11AutmAN. It is d filen t to have order. 
Senator MANSFIELO. The fact is that we, have these satellites going 
skyward hundreds of Miles and we have these missiles going thousands 
of miles into the ocean. It was because of these new' factors that I

STATE DEP. \ R'rAl EN T'S KNOWLEDGE OF IT-2 ELIO I ITS 
Mr. Secretary, Secret ary Dillon testified this morning that he 
did not know of this particular flight, and to time best of my memory 
yOH said you were away at the time and did not know of this particular 
fiiht. 
Secretary HERTER. I knew of the program. I made that clear in 
which the flight was included but not that particular flight. 
Senator GoRE. I was specifying this particular flight. Did I cor-
rectly understand bot h of you ? 
Mr. Dtr,r,oN. Yes, Senator. I had hoard about 6 weeks earlier that 
a series of flights would be undertaken and I had not heard anything 
since that time but it was not in my regular order of business. 
Senator GORE. Would you repeat what you said? I did not under-
stand it, 
Mr. Dit,LoN. I said I was informed about 6 weeks before the date 
of this flight, I say, that there was a program of particular flights 
of which this one could have been a part, and I did--

Senator GORE. It could have been but you did not know of this 
particular one. 
Mr. DILLON. No; I did not know any more than that of this par-
ticular flight. 
QUESTION OF DECISION NOT TO HALT PROGRAM OF I1-2 FLIGHTS 
Senator GORE. The President, in his statement to the American 
people, the other night, said this: 
As to the timing, the question was really whether to halt the program and 
thus forego the gathering of important information that was essential and 
that was likely to be unavailable at a later date. The decision was that the 
program should not be halted. 
Now, as I understand your reply to the chairman of the committee, 
you did not participate in the making of a decision to halt or not to 
alt this particular flight. 
Secretary HERTER. I had approved of it. 
Senator GORE. On this particular program. 
Secretary HERTER. And approved of it as a part of the program. 
The question of the halting of it was not in issue at that time although 
I knew that the summit conference was coming. 
Senator GORE. Well, my specific question is this: Did you partici-
pate in a conference or were you aware of a decision; did you make 
a decision? What is the full extent of your knowledge of a decision 
that the flight would not be discontinued? 
Secretary HERTER. I know of no conference at which that matter 
was discussed. 
440 Senator GORE. Then would it have properly been  
Secretary HERTER. The only matter that came before me was the 
approval of this program. 
Senator ? GORE. How long ago did you approve the program? 
Secretary HERTER. I can't tell you exactly, but it was some time 
prior to the time I went abroad. 
Senator GORE. IS it a matter of weeks? 
Secretary HERTER. A matter of weeks. 
Senator GORE. Would such a decision have been properly within the 
province of the State Department? 
Secretary HERTER. No. The State Department would not have a 
final decision in the matter. The State Department would have an 
advisory position in the matter, and the CIA did consult with us 
about it. 
[Deleted.] 
PROCEDURAL DISCUSSION 
Senator GORE. I understood the purpose of this hearing was to de-
velop the facts insofar as we were capable of doing so, and to the extent 
that security would permit, to make available the facts to the Ameri-
can people. 
Do I correctly understand the purpose of the hearing? 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Tennessee understands it as I 
understand it in spite of the opinion of the Senator from Wisconsin. 
Senator LAUSCHE. May I ask, is it?
Senator WILEY. You might as well just now.

Senator LAUSLIIE. Is it confined to what our Government has done 
or are we concerned about what the Soviet has done? 
The CHAIRMAN. I certainly am concerned about what the Soviet has 
done. 
Senator LAusicm:. It hasn't been manifested here today. 
(Procedural discussion.) 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Tennessee has the floor. 
Senator WILEY. May I just say one thing? 
The CHAIRMAN. Does: the Senator yield to the Senator from Wis-
consin ? 
Senator WILEY. I realize when I bit the ceiling before that I was 
probably not as coherent as I should be. I want to say to you with the 
conviction of a man who has lived lona, that the business of a com-
mittee like ours is to develop facts for legislation, facts that are 
necessary to bring out curative legislation, or if you please, if you 
want to investigate all individual, that is another thing. We had the 
McCarthy hearings. We know what that did, but here is another 
angle. 
It is not the business of this committee to expose to the people of 
this country a mechanism that is so important to preserve the life and 
integrity of this country, and I mean the CIA, I know what it means. 
I happen to know something about what it has done I deleted] and to 
me, at least, and as I say, as a young man of past 70 summers, please 
remember that when you go into this thing, as you are going into it, 
you are going to expose a mechanism that is as vital to the life of this 
country as anytbino- you can think of. 
It is that mechanism that made possible this series of three and a 
half years of exploratory missions over the Soviet I-Tnion [deleted]. 
If that is what von are going into, just count your words. 
Senator GORE. Mr. Chairman? 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Tennessee. 
Senator GORE. I )calirg with the CIA is not a new experience for me. 
I happen to have handled in the House of Representatives the ap-
propriation bill for the Atomic Energy Commission for 5 years before 
I was elected to the U.S. Senate. 
was party to the appropriation for the atomic energy program 
when the atomic bomb was being built in my State. No one ever heard 
those secrets from my lips. Every year for the past 141 have listened 
to the testimony of the CIA from one to two or three or more times.. 
don't think that it is necessary that we violate the security of tins 
country in order to hear Mr. Allen I Mlles' testimony. 
The CHAIRMAN. Will the Senator yield? Mr. Dulles said to this 
committee when he was asked if he would appear, that be would be 
very pleased to appear. He thought it would serve a useful purpose. 
He had no objection. 
Senator GORE. I. am aware that I am pursuing very important 
questions that reflect upon the effectiveness of our country and the 
prestige of our country. That is all the more reason why they should 
be pursued. 
I thought this was the purpose of the hearing, to develop the facts, 
and insofar as they could be revealed to the public, to do so. 
The CHAIRMAN, The Senator is quite right.

QUESTION OF DECISION NOT TO HALT PROGRAM OF U-2 FLIGHTS 
Senator GORE. To return to the question, insofar as either of you 
know, or any official of the Department, no actual decision to proceed 
with the flight or not to proceed with the flight was made. 
If such a decision was made, it was beyond your knowledge. Is 
that a correct statement ? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes ? I think that I ought to say this. When the 
matter came before me, I had an opportunity of disapproving it and 
did not do so. Not it, but the program. 
Senator GORE. But this particular flight did not come before you? 
Secretary HERTER. It came as one of a group. 
[Deleted.] 
NOTICE TO SECRETARY HERTER OF PLANE'S MISFORTUNE 
Senator GORE. When did you first learn of the plane's misfortune? 
Secretary HERTER. I received word in Ankara, Turkey, that a plane 
was down. That is all. 
Senator GORE. From whom did you receive it? 
Secretary HERTER. It was handed to me from a slip of paper that 
Mr. Livingston Merchant had. He was sitting behind me at a NATO 
meeting and he handed me a slip of paper, "word has come that 
[deleted] a plane is missing." 
I don't think he said in Russia. I didn't know which one of the 
flights it was. 
Senator GORE. It is your presumption that this was a communica-
tion within the Department? 
Secretary HERTER.. Oh, yes. I assume it was either in the Depart-
ment or from CIA sources with whom we are constantly in touch 
overseas. 
Senator GORE. I believe my time is up. I will return to this.

PARIS PRESS BRIEFING BY AMBASSADOR BOHLEN 
The CHAIRMAN. You had one question of Mr. Bohlen. He was 
called back at your request. 
Senator GORE.. Yes. If I may digress a moment, I have been told 
several times, Mr. Bohlen, that in your press briefing at Paris I 
believe on this 16th, you expressed the view that except for the 1J-2 
plane, there would have been a summit conference. 
Will you relate to us what you said at this briefing in this regard? 
Mr. BOHLEN. I don't recall, Senator, honestly that I made that 
statement?
Senator WILEY. A little louder' please. 
Mr. BOHLEN. I don't recall that I made that statement. The press 
briefing that I held on the 16th was an open press conference on the 
record, and I do not recall any statement of that kind because my 
view then as now is that the U-2 was one of the factors that nr?y have 
led to the particular Soviet behavior at Paris. 
I really do not recall any such statement of that kind. It's all on 
the record. This was an open press conference.

Senator Gout:. You did not hold ;tit off-the-record background 
briefing? 
Mr. lion LEN-. I hob.' a background later in which I outlined at, that 
conference the three factors that I believed and still do entered into 
the formulation of i he Soviet position. 
Senator GORE. Was a transcript made of that background briefing? 
Mr. BOHLEN. 11 ?vottld have to check on that, sir. I think there 
probably was. 
Senator GORE. W011id you supply it to the committee if there was? 
Mr. BoffLEN. If there is (De, 1 would have no views on it. 
Secretary HERTER. I would have, no objection. 
(The transcript, referred to was subsequently furnished for the con-
iden ti al use of the, con 'nil ttee.) 
Mr. Bouf,EN. If I here is a transcript of it, but I recall the circum-
stances very well in this, in that three factors that 1 mentioned earlier, 
the Soviet pessi mist 11 as regards the outcome of the suntinit front their 
point of view; the possible opposition or questioning of its conduct 
and the T--2 matters were the three factors that appeared to me to 
have entered into Si wiet decision to torpedo the conference. 
I might add, Senator, for clarification on this, we have used the 
words "scuttle the conference" quite often. 
There, are various ways of scuttling a conference. You can scuttle 
a conference before it begins or you can sabotage it from within 
[deleted]. 
[ Subsequently, N1 r. .1 oh len made, available to the Committee the 
following statement of views he held in Paris at the time the Sum-
mit Conference came to an end :1 
would like to just briefly note?this is a personal opinion--that there 
were three elements in this situation: 
One, I think, was the situation in Moscow, whereby there were some people 
who were a little bit concerned about the manner in which Khrushehev was 
conducting the foreign relations of the Soviet Union, for reasons already 
totalled on. 
The second was that I believe that he came to think?or the Soviet Gov-
ernment came to think?that the prospects for any agreement at the sum-
on Berlin particularly, which is one that he had committiml himself so 
deeply to, were very dim indeed. Before the plane incident. they were visibly 
preparing the usual tactic of placing the onus in advance upon the Western 
Powers for any expected failure. But had there been no plane incident, I 
believe the conference would have run its full course. There would have 
heel' discussions. There would have been the normal, if you want to call it 
that, the normal type conference with the Russians, of which we have had 
many in the last 15 years, hut without results. 
The plane incident the whole development connecting with that, moved 
things into a totally new dimension. And I think that the evidence is (.011-
elusive, that he came here to Paris with the idea of either torpedoing the 
conference or conceivably?because you cannot read their full minds--the 
hope that somehow or other that the pressure from our Allies would force the 
United States to capitulate. I think he makes this very plain. And this is 
where he made his major miscalculation. Our Allies stood with us solidly--
wonderfully well. 
01 course, it is easier to say that now than it was before, 
Mr. DRYDEN. I was told that these statements had been cleared by 
Mr. DRYDEN. The GIN people with whom we were dealing, sir.

DUTIES OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
Senator LAUSCHE. Mr. Herter, I have in my hand the National 
Security Act of 1947, and I have read from page 5 that part of the ? 
material which deals with the duties of the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
Are the duties enumerated in this section complete? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes; I think those are enumerated in that 
section. 
Senator LAUSCHE. This section didn't place any directions on how 
intelligence is to be obtained. 
Secretary HERTER. No.

PRESIDENT'S ASSUMPTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR U-2 FLIGHT 
Senator LAUSCIIE. Based upon the questions that have been asked 
here today, one set implied that the President should not have told 
the truth.- The next set implied that one of the men lied. And the 
third set implied that there was an inability to coordinate the views. 
Now, my question is off the record. 
The CHAIRMAN. Take it off the record. 
We will make a special dispensation, whatever the Senator wishes.. 
Does he wish it on or off? 
Senator LAUSCIIE. Let it be on. Has anyone given any thought 
about the peculiar position that the President of the United States 
is placed in in connection with the paradoxical situation that he is 
supposed to be a man of truth, and moral character, and yet requested 
to he about these matters, if they are within his knowledge? 
Secretary HERTER. I am not sure whether that is a rhetorical ques-
tion or whether you are asking me that question. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Well, take it both ways. [Laughter.] 
Senator GORE. Rhetorical or oratorical. [Laughter.] 
Senator LAUSCHE. Well, let's assume that you were the President, 
Mr. Herter, and you were faced with the dilemma of telling a lie 
about what happened or telling the truth. In either event you are 
hooked. What course would you follow? 
Secretary HERTER. I can answer that one so far as I myself am 
concerned. 
The CHAIRMAN. He followed both. 
Senator LAUSCHE. I don't know. I am beginning to wonder if what 
the Central Intelligence Agency is doing ought not to be a matter 
left with them and without the knowledge of the President. 
I have no other questions. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, I just want to make a comment. 
The Senator from Ohio has put his finger on the very point that 
perhaps I didn't make clear to him earlier in my inquiry. This is, in 
my opinion, a central important question about this whole matter, 
the wisdom of the policy of involving the President in this kind of 
business, that is, espionage, which traditionally involves lying and 
cheating and murdering and violating the sovereignty of countries 
with which a country is not at war and all of this. And what the Sen-
ator has said is?perhaps I didn't make it clear?is exactly the point 
that I was seeking to raise and to elucidate in the first line of questions 
that I asked. And I agree with him this presents a very difficult

dilemma, and the question is the wisdom of departing from the tra-
ditional historical practice of not involving the head of the state in 
any espionage responsibilities that he is above and apart from. We 
follow that in the Congress, as you have just stated. [Deleted.] We 
treat it differently, and I was suggesting and raising the question of 
whether it is wise to depart from the traditional practice that all 
important states throughout history, without exception in accordance 
with the Secretary's testimony, have followed. That is the very point. 
I don't think the Senator understood what my point was. 
Senator LAuscri?. I knew if I were President--
Senator WII,Ey. You would tell the truth. 
Senator LAUSCIIE. I would tell the truth. 
Senator WILEy. So did he. 
The CHAIRMAN. He did and this is the answer. 
Senator LAUSCHE. And could you expect him to do anything else? 
Senator WILEy. That is right. 
Senator LAUSCHE. And the only way you could enable him to per-
form his duty to his country was not by having him know what was 
done and if he didn't know the question would be pursued why 
didn't he know. 
Senator WILEY. He taught the world a lesson in 1960, new diplo-
macy, by telling the truth, and I think that it will echo down through 
the years. 
Senator LAuscir?. So I don't know which group to follow. 
The CHAramAN. It is echoing down the years already. This is the 
principal echo that has arisen from this whole matter. 
Senator LAUSCIIE. The tragedy is that this is made the principal 
echo but all of the misdeeds of the Soviet are looked upon as incon-
sequential.

statement. He draws conclusions that are not justified by the record 
or any statement that I have heard before the committee.

Senator MANSFIELD. Yes. I think we have the program here. But 
could somebody On the staff find it right away so that, I could read it

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Secretary HERTER. Well, as I say, this had not been cleared with us. 
The CHAIRMAN. He is an employee  
Secretary HERTER. I think it is very possible that a prepared state-
ment had been cleared, but not an answer to a question. There is no 
way of clearing that, until one knows what question is asked. 
The CHAIRMAN. What I asked this for is because later on it seems 
to me one of the important things that might come out of this commit-
tee hearing is a tightening of the policy which gives the Department 
of State and the Secretary of State a much closer control over public 
statements by other agencies. It strikes me that we would get in 
much less trouble if all these people would clear with you or with 
whoever is Secretary of State of the Department, we will say. Don't 
you think that would minimize the chances of inconsistent state-
ments being made by members of the Government? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, that is so. But I think that anything that 
he may have said in a prepared statement on that TV program at that 
time had been cleared. Insofar as answers to questions are con-
cerned, there is no way of clearing them without knowing the ques-
tions and in that way he was on his own. 
The CHAIRMAN. It is his responsibility, then, when he goes beyond 
anything that had been cleared? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Chairman, on page 35 of the Background 
Documents on the summit conference, about 7 or 8 lines up from the 
bottom of the page Mr. Allen, in response to a question from Miss 
Dodd, states the following: 
There are a lot of different definitions of "spying" and I don't want to try to 
quibble, but I do think I ought to point this out and that more people ought to 
recall it: When he went down he told exactly what his mission was and exactly 
What he was expected to do, and he was under instruction to do that. 
Now, the answer to the question, I just thought ought to be in the 
record, because there was some confusion about this statement in view 
of information which had been given to a group previously in the 
Capitol. Again, I want to say, Mr. Chairman, that I am through 
with my questions of Mr. Herter, but I want to express my thanks 
to Secretary Herter, to Secretary Dillon and to Ambassador Bohlen 
for their candor and frankness today and to assure them that I, for 
One, appreciate what they had to say, and I think they have made a 
real contribution to clearing up a confused situation which confronted 
the committee as a whole. 
Secretary HERTER. We are very grateful for that, Senator. 
Senator WILEY. Of course, on this side of the aisle, I have praised 
your statement in the beginning and I will praise your conduct in 
the conclusion. You all did very well. 
Senator GORE. Mr. Chairman? 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Gore. 
Senator GORE. I do not wish to unduly tire the Secretary, but I am 
perfectly willing to come back after dinner or to come back tomorrow. 
I do have many more questions. 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, it is my understanding the Secretary?he 
looks very well to me?would prefer to go on tonight. He does not 
wish to run over to next week.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECISION TO DISCONTI NUE FLIGHTS 
The CHAlIMAN. The Senator may proceed. 
Senator GORE. Fine. 
1 wish to resume my inquiry with respect to this particular flight. 
I am perturbed that you say it would not be. within the province, of 
the, Department, of State to make the decision to discontinue these 
flights: I hat this would be a decision for Mr. Dulles to make. 
Secretary HERTER. No, I never said that at, all. 
Senator GORE. I beg your pardon? 
Secretary I IERTER. I never said that at all. T said he was the opera-
tonal man who had to plan things, and then submit them for approval. 
Senator GORE. Well, what. would be the proper agency to consider 
whether these flights should or should not be discontinued ? 
Secretary HERTER. If the question of discontinuance had come, up, 
if that was a decision to be made, we would have. been asked advice on 
it. We were not asked for advice, on it. We. gave approval to carry 
on with the routine planning that, had been done from the point of 
view of flight,. 
Senator GORE. Some weeks prior? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes, and had given that approval. 
Senator Go RE. Did that approval--
Secretary HERTER. That approval, as I say, is advice. 
Senator GORE. Was advice? 
Secretary HERTER. Is advice. The President himself took the re-
sponsibility for any final decision. 
Senator GORE. Did your approval involve continuation of the flight 
through and during the period of the summit conference? 
Secretary }TEETER. Not specifically as such. The approval con-
stituted going ahead when conditions were appropriate for carrying 
I hem out. 
Senator GoRE. Did you give no consideration to diseontinuance at a 
I ime prior to the summit, meeting or during the summit conference? 
Secretary HERTER. Senator, I answered that question before when I 
said that there is no good time, for a failure, that if the summit. con-
ference had debarred carrying out, these flights the President's visit to 
Russia may have been the next thing that, might have debarred them. 
It may have been debarred when R hrushehey was at Camp David; 
it may Lave been (lobo rred when Mr. Khrushchev was visiting in 
France. 
Tliere may have been any number of diplomatic reasons why they 
shouldn't be conducted at a given period of time. 
In my opinion, the value of the information and the necessity of 
carrying out, these flights under given conditions warranted their 
going ahead. 
Senator GORE. I ani t rying to be, specific in my quest ions, and I am 
trying to elicit, from you whether at the time you gave your approval 
for the general program some weeks prior to this partic,ular flight, 
von gave specific consideration to the question of continuance or dis-
continuance during or near the time of the summit conference. 
Secretary :HERTER. Certainly. The summit, conference was very 
much on my mind as it was on everybody's mind, at that time. 
Senator GORE. And you gave your approval then ?

COMPARISON OF STATEMENTS MADE BY PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY OF STATE 
Senator GORE. Another statement which the President made, I 
would like to read: 
Of course we had no indication or thought that basic Soviet policies had 
turned about. But when there is even the slightest chance of strengthening 
peace, there could be no higher obligation than to pursue it. 
Now, on page 4 of your statement here today, I would like to read. 
This is on page 4, beginning "Summit prospects dimmed." 
Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the second, third, 
fourth, and fifth paragraphs on page 4 be reprinted at this point in 
the record. 
The CHAIRMAN. Without objection it is so ordered. 
NW/ (The paragraphs referred to follow:) 
In the first weeks after the Khrushchev American visit there was a general 
improvement of atmosphere and people began talking, partly in hope, partly in 
some confusion, about "detente." There were comparatively conciliatory 
speeches on each side; there was progress in the test-ban talks at Geneva; a 
new Soviet-United States cultural agreement was signed November 21, and 
on December 1 the United States, the U.S.S.R., and other powers signed the 
Antarctic treaty. 
But clouds began to gather even then. One of the earliest signs was the 
strong Soviet protest on November 11 against West German plans to build a 
broadcasting station in West Berlin. Another was the Khrushchev speech on 
November 14 which was harder in tone, boasted again of Soviet missile prowess, 
and began a concentrated attack on Adenauer and the German Federal Republic 
which later increased and seemed to be a central feature of Soviet presummit 
tactics. The reason for this attack is still a matter for speculation. Perhaps 
they thought it would undermine the Western position on Berlin by helping to 
divide the Western Allies. It had no such effect of course, but naturally 
rallied us to speak out in defense of our German ally. 
Khrushchev as early as December 1 also began repeating his threats to sign 
a separate peace treaty with East Germany. He repeated these threats in his 
speech to the Supreme Soviet on January 14 and in his remarks during his visit 
to Indonesia and other countries in January. On February 4, the Warsaw 
Pact powers issued the first formal blocwide commitment to sign a separate GDR 
peace treaty. Thus Khrushchev's threatening Baku speech of April 25, though 
it was the most sweeping since February 1950, was only a harsher version of 
what he had been saying for months before. I shall make full documentation 
on his speeches available to the committee. 
Not until April did we reply at length to this mounting crescendo of Soviet 
statements. We did so in order to keep the record straight?notably in the 
speeches of April 4 and 20, which Khrushchev attacked for starting arguments 
that he in fact had begun.

100 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Senator GORE. You will see from this statement, Mr. Secretary,. 
that you contradict the President's statement, do you not? 
The President says: 
We had no indication or thought that basic Soviet policies had turned about. 
From what I have just read, you list one, two, three, four occasions 
where the Soviet policy had, in fact, changed. 
Do you wish to comment? 
Secretary HERTER, Yes, I would be very glad to comment. 
I don't think that there is any essential disagreement in the two 
Points of view. 
I am talking primarily in my statement in regard to Berlin. and 
Germany. 
The President was talking about a series of things in which he spoke. 
of disarmament, mutual inspection, atomic control, and then he added 
Germany and Berlin. 
As I testified earlier in the day, I think we all had hopes that there. 
might be a possibility of making some progress, oven though not in. 
the German-Berlin situation but in the disarmament field, and as a. 
corollary possibly in the nuclear testing field where it was not a sum-
mit problem, but it would have been a three-power problem that could 
have been discussed in Paris. 
For instance, so long as there was any hope of making any progress,. 
the President was willing to go. 
Senator GORE. I didn't question the President being willing to go, 
so long as there was any hope of progress. 
What I was asking you to comment on was what appears to me to. 
be a contrast between the President's statement that there is no indi-
cation that basic Soviet policies had turned about, and where you give 
almost a full page indicating that they had turned about. But you 
have finished your comment on that. 
Secretary HERTER, Yes, there was some talk here about basic policy' 
and tactics in connection with the summit. I don't think the President 
felt events such as I cited necessarily mean that Soviet basic policy 
had changed. 
I think as he said after Camp David, he hoped that there was a 
mutuality of interest, particularly in the disarmament field, which 
-Would allow the great powers getting together in order to make prog-
ress in disarmament. 
That had always been the area in which he hoped, because of the 
mutuality of interest, hat we might make progress. 
I don't think that there is anything fundamentally opposed in these 
two statements. 
};XTENU OF PREMIER K FIRITSIICHEV'S rowna 
Senator GORE. Now, I want to ask a few questions which relate to 
the first of the three questions on which I wish to examine your opin-
ion; that is, whether the diplomatic failure in Paris represented a 
failure in policy. 
You recall that I submitted certain questions to you here on March 
22. At that time I asked you: 
Do you think it wouid have been more prudent to have had an understanding

4"Approved For Release 2004/05/13 : CIA-RDP90T00782R0010003B901-1 
EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENcE 
about the subjects to be considered at a summit conference before agreeing to 
have one, or do you think this is the proper way to keep the store? 
Secretary HERTER. It is a gamble. I don't know. 
Senator GORE. You are gambling with high stakes, and it seems to me In a 
reckless manner. I am disturbed to have the Secretary of State make the 
statements that you have made today about the summit conference; that there 
is no plan, no purpose, no understanding as to what will be discussed and what 
we hope to attain there. 
Secretary HERTER, Mr. Senator, I view this as essentially a matter of ex-
ploration. We have the situation where an individual, Mr. Krushchev, is the 
man who makes the decisions so far as we know, for the Russians. 
Later on, I asked you: 
Is there any reason why the Russian dictator could not delegate the same 
power to his Foreign Minister as President Eisenhower should or does delegate 
to you? 
Senator HERTER. None. 
Senator GORE. Then isn't that a fallacious argument? 
Secretary HERTER. Not necessarily, because you are dealing with an indi-
vidual personality who many believe wants to be the negotiator. 
Now, I read those things because one of the principal, if not the 
principal, justifications for going to the summit and for the exchange 
of visits was that Mr. Khrushchev and he alone spoke for the Russian 
people, but today you tell us on page 7: 
I might digress here to observe that it had been our experience at previous 
conferences with the Soviets, at least since the death of Stalin, that the Soviet 
representative, no matter how highly placed he might be, was bound by the 
collective decisions on basic policy matters made prior to his departure from 
Moscow. Any substantive changes in those positions apparently required refer-
ence back to Moscow before they could be undertaken. 
And then on page 8, you say: 
This meeting completely confirmed our conclusion of the night before that 
Mr. Khrushchev was operating within the fixed limits of a policy set before his 
departure from Moscow. 
Secretary HERTER. There appears to be an inconsistency in those 
two statements. 
When I was testifying here before, the visits of Mr. Khrushchev in 
which sometimes he had an important person with him and sometimes 
he did not  
Senator GORE. In which what, sir? 
Secretary HERTER. Sometimes in which he had an important person 
with him and sometimes he did not, indicated that his situation at 
home was such that he had a great deal more leeway than had pre-
viously been the case. 
When he went to Paris, and I think this has been brought out, he 
had with him Gromyko and Malinovsky, General Malinovsky, 
Marshal Malinovsky, who never left him for one moment at any time. 
This was a departure from previous occasions. This is why we said 
they had gone hack to their standard policy of taking directions from 
home. 
Prior to that time I had believed he had greater leeway than was 
clearly indicated here in Paris. 
Senator GORE. SO the assumption proved to be erroneous. 
Secretary HERTER. It is.

Usti Al, oirrAy.u.d, [lc PROCEDURES YEW.; t SU-a:VITT CoNFERENCEti 
Senator tioRE. I Eielieve you testified before the House, acNirding 
To press reports yesterday, that summitry as a diplomatic, method 
had had some hard i !locks. 
Secretary IlparrEL:, Yes, I did. 
In answer to a question from Senator Humphrey, I repeated the 
same tiling today. 
SellarTOP GORE. A ad in recommending, which I. eertaittly endorse, 
continuing businesslike negotiation wit li the Soviets, you have in mind 
the more usual processes and procedures of diplomacy. 
Secretary HERTEL:. That is correct. 
Senator GORE. Negotiations. 
Secretary I h.a'rra. The one thing t hat I did point out, however, 
is that with regard to the Berlin situation, Great Britain, France, 
the United States and the Soviet. I 7/lion have responsibility. This is 
the carryover from the war, 
Senator GORE. Y 
Secretary H ERTEL!, Anil that there, there must be agreement,. This 
is a thing we have, been lighting all the time, that unilateral action by 
the Russians cannot talie, away those rights and obligations which 
I hey as well as ourselves had acquired as a result of the war. 
That it must be done, by the consent of the four. 
So that whether or not in the future the discussions to reach agree-
ment Lonong the four should take place through diplomatic channels, 
through ambassadorial level, through foreign minister or not, I would 
not say which would be the level, but 1 think that it, is much better 
to see if we cannot, is we did in the, foreign ministers' conference, and 
failed, try to reach a large measure of agreement prior to the meeting 
of a summit conference, so that there might be one or two small un-
resolved issues that could be resolved there rather than trying to 
negotiate when you know that you are very far apart at a summit 
fere:nee. 
Senator GORE. Well, t hope that you will persist., and that the 
President will persist in the businesslike undertakings. I will not 
ask you to say that summitry apart from diplomacy failed. I aM 
content with your statement. in that regard. I am sorry that I think 
it, did fail. 
Secretary HERTER. I would differ with you, sir, on the question of 
personal dipornacy as against summitry. I think that, visits are., on 
the whole, useful things. 
I wouldn't, say that that, was something that should be discarded 
completely. I think it is particularly true that visits of ministers 
of foreign affairs, and visits of heads of state from time to time ean 
accomplish a great deal of good. But I believe very strongly that 
insofar as heads of state are concerned that is not the place to begin 
negotiations. It is the place perhaps where there should be the 
culmination of nego ations. 
Senator GORE. I `A ill agree with you in that statement. The, ex-
change of visits offers opportunities. But the, formalization of a head 
or state conference, where severe international tensions are involved, 
without, precise plan ni rn,, without assurance that, at least limited

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
agreements can be reached, is, in my view, a dangerous process, and 
a policy upon which we should never have embarked. 
Of course, it is easier to say that now than it was before. 
Hindsight, of course, we learned a long time ago, is better than 
foresight. 
The CHAIRMAN. Would the Senator yield for a moment? I have 
one or two questions and then he may come back to it. 
Senator GORE. Good. 
AUTHORIZATION FOR U-2 FLIGHTS 
The CHAIRMAN. These I think have been covered but for clarifica-
tion, I might ask them again. Was there ever a time when the Presi-
dent authorized each flight in this program; that's never been the 
practice. 
Secretary HERTER. It has never come up to the President. 
The CHAIRMAN. Nor of the National Security Council. 
Secretary HERTER. No. 
The CHAIRMAN. It has always been under a blanket authority 
understood? 
Secretary HERTER. That is my impression. 
The CHAIRMAN. Is this blanket authorization under review, either 
constant or periodic review? 
Secretary HERTER. In my experience the CIA has planned a num-
ber of alternate flights at a time. [Deleted.] 
BACKGROUND OF NASA STATEMENT 
The CHAIRMAN. When the Department brought Mr. Bohlen back 
from Manila, and he was well-known as an expert on Soviet behavior, 
and this was, I thought, in anticipation of these summit meetings 
which had been discussed a long time, did he or any other of our 
Russian experts advise you or the President to wait and see what Mr. 
Khrushchev knew about the TJ-2 flight before making the NASA 
statement? 
Mr. DILLON. The people in the Department who were familiar with 
Soviet policy took part in discussions with the CIA which led to the 
coordination and the agreement on the guidelines which were given 
to NASA, and those included the people who were familiar with all 
aspects of our policy. 
However, as we said 'before we did not know that there was going 
to be a full statement by NASA. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Bohlen was not consulted about the NASA 
statement. 
Mr. DILLON. Nobody in the State Department was consulted about 
the statement as a statement. 
The CHAIRMAN. Nobody. 
What puzzles me about this is why was there such compulsion, if 
there was, to make such an immediate reaction? I have wondered 
why there was any necessity for immediately reacting to the first 
Khrushchey statement. 
It would seem to me much more normal to wait a while and see 
what developed. 
Was there anything that was compelling you to answer almost 
immediately?

104 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Mr. DilLow. Yes, I would say so. It was such an unusual and re-
markable statement when Mr. Khrushchev said that American plane 
had been shot down over the Soviet Union, that we were not in the 
position to not make any comment whatsoever. 
As a result we had to make some comment, and we made the very 
bland statement whieh was put out on the 5th. 
The CHAIRMAN. I didn't mean that. You misunderstood me. I 
accept the necessity for tile cover story, the statement. 
Mr. Ihnnow. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. it is the second one that went into such detail. It 
would seem to me that it would be commonsense not to follow up too 
quickly in the matter of timing. What was the reason for that? 
Mr. DumoN. The Stale Department's second statement was innocu-
ous too. It didn't go into any detail, any more detail than the original 
cover story did. There was great?if any detail, that was the state-
ment that was put out by NASA. 
The CHAIRMAN. is it not true that the NASA statement itself is 
what put you in a position of having to make a further statement? 
Is that true ? 
Mr. DILLON. The further statement, I think, was the next state-
ment in this series, was the one that was put out on Saturday which 
was made only at the time when we knew that the Soviets probably 
had the pilot, which was new information, and then the Soviets had 
already said they had him, and had said where he was shot down, 
and the probability was that they had certain parts of the airplane 
because the picture which they had first put out turned out to be a 
fraudulent picture. 
BACKGROUND OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S STATEMENT OF MAY 7 
The CHAIRMAN. Perhaps I don't understand the timing of it. 
It seems to me, if I do understand it, that you could have stood 
noon the cover story for some time before the necessity of any further 
atement, awaiting developments. 
Mr. DuzoN. -You mean, your question is why we made the state-
ment on Saturday, May 7, which was the first time we departed from 
the cover story. 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. 
Secretary HERTEIZ. That, as I think I have testified before, was a 
decision that was made in the light of the very full revelation of 
Mr. Khrushchev in giving out, both as to the pilot's testimony, and 
as to the parts WIC equipment, that had been recovered. That was 
when we had to make the decision were we going to keep on lying 
about this or were we going to tell the truth? 
The CriAllnitAx. Why there wasn't a third alternative is what I 
am_ trying to get at? 
Why didn't you just be quiet and say nothing? You don't have 
just, the alternatives of either continuing to lie or to tell the trut 
Yon could have said nothing. I was just curious. 'Was it ever 
considered that you didn't, have to react? 
Secretary ilhurrEtz. A good many statements were already being 
made in Congress, a good many statements were already being made 
r required of us almost.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE bumiviir  
The press was hounding everybody, "What do you say now after 
-what Mr. Khrushchev had said," it was a very difficult time in our 
.society, our form of society to have said nothing. 
The CHAIRMAN. I believe that was the statement in which you 
said "it has been established that insofar as the authorities are con-
cerned, there was no authorization for any such flights." Is that 
correct? 
Secretary HERTER. That is right. 
The CHAIRMAN. Which was not a truthful statement at that point, 
-was it ? 
Secretary HERTER. No, this was still partly cover. 
The CHAIRMAN. Still partly cover? 
Secretary HERTER. Still partly cover. It was not until Monday, 
after the briefing had taken place before the congressional leadership 
here on the hill that the full statement was made. 
The CHAIRMAN. It was after that statement that the full statement 
was made? 
Secretary HERTER. That is correct. 
BACKGROUND OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE STATEMENT OF MAY 9 
The CIIAIRMAN. That full statement, if I understood it?I think 
you have testified?was only after complete and thorough consulta-
tion with everyone concerned, and had the unanimous support of 
State and the President; is that correct? 
Secretary HERTER. It is, yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Gore, go ahead. 
Senator GORE. Well, when you made the final statement that the 
President did approve, he was responsible?I am not undertaking to 
quote you exactly?you also made it plain that he did not approve 
.specific flights? 
Secretary HERTER. Yes. 
[Deleted.] 
BLOW TO UNITED STATES' MORAL POSITION 
Senator GORE. I will wait until Mr. Dulles' testimony. 
Now, I wish to make my own feelings explicit. I have not intended 
to suggest, nor do I believe the chairman or anyone else has intended 
to suggest, that the President or any other official of the U.S. Govern-
ment tells a falsehood. I don't know of any requirement in Anglo-
Saxon jurisprudence or any other jurisprudence stemming from 
Roman law that a citizen is required to incriminate himself. I know 
? of no requirement that a nation is required to incriminate or denigrate 
or defame itself. I do not claim any sense of morals or sensitivity to 
moral standards greater than the average American, but I want the 
record to show that I was humiliated with official falsification, and I 
think millions of Americans were humiliated. I can agree with you 
that our alliance stood firm. I am happy that it did, but I think we 
would be deluding ourselves if we did not realize that this unfortunate 
incident has dealt a severe blow to the moral position of the United 
States. I think we should begin to mend it. The way to mend it is 
to ferret out our errors and our mistakes, correct them, and thereby 
demonstrate to the world our will and our capacity to survive this 
kind of blow?and I hope be stronger thereafter.

The Cu-Aunt-AN Mr. Secretary, there was one point that I over-
looked. I had heard that Chairman Khrushohey had directly or in-
directly made SOIM' inquiry about the possibility of meeting Mr. 
Eisenhower before the summit meeting. Do you know whether or 
not, that is so? 
Secret ary I FERTER. No. I know of no such effort. 
Tim Cu AIRMAN. No effort ? 
Secretary Iltarrnit. Actually, Mr. Khrushchev, when he came to 
Paris or just, before he came to Paris, sent a note to the British and to 
the French, I think. largely on a procedural matter; no such note to 
as. When the l'resident, arrived in l 'anis, there was just as nu tch op-
port unity for Mr. k hrnshchey to seek a meeting with him as with the 
others; and no such effort was made from any Russian source.

when one is faced with certain, events at a _given time. I think obvi-
ously we should be giving serious consideration to the very best 
method of the handling of anything of this kind that might happen in 
the future; and I think from that point of view, as the President said, 
we welcome this inquiry. We welcome a full disclosure as far as we 
could from the point of view of responsibilities and coordination. I 
thank you for your patience here today. 
The CHAIRMAN. I want to thank you for your patience and your 
frankness and candor. I think you and your associates?Secretary 
Dillon and Mr. Bohlen?have been most cooperative in this whole 
hearing. I like to think that out of this one?as you know, rather pet 
project of mine?is that the State Department itself be given greater 
prestige and authority in controlling and coordinating all matters 
relating to our foreign relations?as I have tried in the case, for ex-
ample, with the recent instance of control of the black nutrket in 
Turkey. I think your Department, the Department of State, ought 
to have more authority than we have in the past accorded it. I am 
sure that some of our troubles do not relate to any fault on your part, 
but to the sort of institutional practices that have grown up--and 
people assuming authority to make statements without consulting you 
and the Department. I feel at this stage of the proceedings that this 
may be one of the good things that will come out of these hearings; 
that the prestige and authority of the State Department will be 
enhanced. 
Secretary HERTER. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator GORE. Could I join you in commending the Secretary and 
his assistants for their candor and their patience and their diligence 
here today. 
Secretary I-Inurrnu. Thank you. 
Senator WILEY. May I also join you the third time by saying, in 
my humble opinion the evidence and the statement you made and 
the statement that Dillon made and the President's speech show con-
clusively that the breakup of the summit conference was due to Khru-
shchev and no other cause. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.

which was begun by the National Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics (NACA). It is a part of?as far as NASA is concerned, it 
it a part of the aeronautical activities transferred to NASA in ac-
cordance with the National Aeronautics and Space Act. 
In this program, which began in 1956, there have been 200 weather 
flights of TJ-2 aircraft with NASA and air weather service instru-
mentation covering flights extended over about 264,000 miles. Ninety 
percent of this flight time was above an altitude of 40,000 feet, and 40 
percent of it, or about 100,000 miles, was above 50,000 feet; and these

110 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCF 
flights have been conducted in the Western United States, Western 
Europe, Turkey, and Japan. 
I may recall to your PI inds that the function of NACA. was that, 
of an iierointutical researth agency to support the Government's pro-
m.) in the development, of civil aircraft and military aircraft. 
RESEARO I t INFORMATION PM OUCED 
Iiroduced only research information used in the design of air-
planes. 
One important, part of this research information which certainly 
is brought to your mind by some of the twent accidents to aircraft 
is that of loads on the aircraft due to atmospheric disturbances or 
gusts. l'Itere are two types of problems: one, illustrated .by the ex-
perience of the airplane which recently got caught in thunderstorm 
activity is that of the maximum load Which the airplane may reach 
wi lel? mmy lea r the wings from t be body. 
The other and more insidious type of niading is the repeated load 
(Inc to gustiness or rough air that many of you have often encoun-
tered in flying. These repeated loads produce a type of brittle failure 
which . we call fatigue failure. This has, as you may recall, been 
encountered in one or two types of t..irplanes and remedied at con-
siderable cost. 
Now. it has been the function of NACA to carry on a program to 
furnish t ho designer information on the magnitude of atmospheric 
gusts encountered by airplanes, the frequency of occurrence of loads 
of different magnitudes. We have been engaged the general type 
of activi( v since 1933 and have data OP all of the, civil transports from 
that, date,. 
A RR A NGEMEN TS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON AIR TURBULENCE 
That, of course, gives you a record of experience with the perform-
ance capabilities of present airplanes, but it was our responsibility 
to I ry to get this information for airplanes yet to be built. This meant 
that in practice we were always seeking the highest and fastest air-
planes to get; information of this kind from, so as to be in advanee 
of i he development of the commercial 'aircraft. 
To do this we made arrangements to get information from military 
airplanes. 
For example, at the close of World War IT we installed our instru-
ments in the B-36 airplane used then by SAC?' arid during their 
training operations these. instruments continued to record gusts aid 
the data were sent to us for analysis. 
Now tile prittern of operation with the commercial airlines and with. 
the military has been the same throughout. We meet with the owners 
and operators of the airplanes?whether an airline, or the military 
service-- come, to an agreement with them that, our instruments can 
be installed on their airplanes. 
1-11 the early stages we send our instrument technicians to visit and 
supervise the installation of the instruments. We train employees of 
the airlines or the GI's in military  
The en AnimAx. Dr. Dryden, does any of this have any relevance 
to the inquiry which this committee is concerned with?

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 111 
Mr. DRYDEN. It does. We will come to this immediately. We train 
our technicians to change the film and send the information to NASA 
for analysis. We have no detailed knowledge of the flight plans until 
after the fact; and as a matter of record, we obtain information 
needed to analyze the data. Observations extend throughout the 
world. At the present time we have instruments on Pan American 
and TWA jets which, of course, go around the world. We have co-
operated with foreign governments and airlines by lending instru-
mentation. 
U-2 OPERATION 
Now the U-2 operation is in the same general pattern of operation. 
This project was organized in 1956 when [deleted] the capabilities of 
this new airplane were brought to our attention. It was able to fly at 
altitudes very considerably higher than any existing airplane. 
The program has been carried on entirely openly. There have been 
three reports issued, unclassified; there have been press releases on 
these operations from time to time. 
The program was unclassified except that the data which revealed 
the airplane could go higher than 55,000 feet were classified. They 
will now be declassified since the potentialities of the airplane have 
become known. 
[Deleted.] 
NEED FOR DATA AT RIMIER ALTITUDES 
I must take you back to the atmosphere at the time. These were 
the clays when the airlines had had DC-6's and DC-7's, and Constel-
lations. At that time we knew the 707, the DC-8, and the Electra 
were under design. We were told that the first of these airplanes 
would be developed early in 1959. All of our previous data with air-
planes had been at altitudes generally not too much above 20,000 feet 
where these airplanes operated. The new airplanes would operate at 
35,000 to 40,000 feet, and the military services were interested in 
supersonic airplanes which traveled at much higher altitudes, so that 
there was at this time a great pressure on us to find methods of obtain-
ing data, and the presence of the capabilities of the U-2 airplane 
seemed to us to give the answer. Some of our advisory committees 
at the time were bringing to our attention the great need for this 
information. I will simply read one extract, if I can find it quickly 
for you, and this committee called our attention to the fact that we 
did not have suitable airplanes available. 
There are three basic regions within which data are available, below 25,000 
feet, up to 30,000 feet with military vehicles, up to 55,000 where meager data 
are available from balloons and rockets and inference from meteor trails. Exist-
ing research vehicles are reaching to higher altitudes?
and so on. 
It is recommended that emphasis be placed on obtaining quantitative infor-
mation on air turbulence at the highest altitudes reasonably obtainable with 
existing research vehicles. 
[Deleted.] 
Now this program was carried on from 1956 through the present 
time. NASA was established in October October 1, 1958, and this was 
one of the programs carried over into NASA.

112 EVENTS INUIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
I might recall to you that NACA was not extensively involved in 
aeronautical activities, that NASA, at present, is engaged in inter-
national space activities. So far we have not had any adverse reac-
tions on the part of people with whom we are cooperating abroad in 
space programs. 
I think this gives the general background and I would be glad to 
respond to questions or to continue with the NASA chronology of the 
week of May 1, as you desire, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Perhaps we ought to proceed with questions.. 
[I.)eleted.] 
LINE OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM NASA TO THE PRESIDENT 
Do you report directly to the President? What is your relation-
ship to the rest of the Government? 
Mr. DRYDEN. At that time the NACA was managed by a committee 
of 17 persons appointed by the President who did report directly to. 
him. 
I was the chief executive officer reporting to the committee at the. 
time this project was started. 
The CHAIRMAN. In 195?? 
Mr. DRYDEN. 1956. 
The CHAIRMAN. Al that time the agency was known as the NACA1 
Mr. DRYDEN. That is correct. 
The CHAIRMAN. When did it change its name to NASA? 
Mr. DRYDEN. On October 1, 1958, it not only changed its name but 
was collected with other parts of the Government into a completely Olt 
new agency, the NASA. 
The CHAIRMAN Does it report to the President? 
Mr. DRYDEN. It reports directly to the President, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN There is a committee of 17 you say? 
Mr. DRYDEN. There is not a committee in NASA. There is an Ad-
ministrator and Deputy Administrator appointed by the President 
with the advice and consent of the Senate. 
The CHAIRMAN. Is there anyone on the staff of the White House 
who is given the duty of receiving your reports? 
Mr. DRYDEN, Doctor Merman reports and talks very frequently 
with the President himself. He does keep the Science Adviser fully 
informed of our activities in space. 
The CHAIRMAN. Who is the Science Adviser? 
Mr. DRYDEN. Dr. Kistiakowsky. 
The CHAIRMAN. So if anyone has the direct responsibility within 
the White House, the office of the Presidency, it is Dr.-----
Mr. DRYDEN. Kistiakowsky. He is the President's adviser on 
science and technology. He has no line responsibility. He is an ad-
viser to the President. 
REPORT OF IJ-2'S LOSS 
The CHAIRMAN. The first that you knew of this was the loss of the 
11-2 plane on May I? 
Mr. DRYDEN. May 1 it was reported to the Administrator and my-
self that aU-2 had been lost, without further detail.

ANTICIPATION OF INQUIRIE? S ABOUT LOSS 
The CHAIRMAN. Did CIA consult with you as to the precise lan-
guage of the release of May 5? 
MT. DRYDEN. What was?
The CHArRmAN. Who drew up that language? 
Mr. DRYDEN. It was discussed in consultation. The questions the 
press asked were: who is the pilot, where was the airplane going, what 
information do you have about it? 
So that between CIA and ourselves, a list of these questions which 
we had received was recorded, and the general nature of the answers 
to these questions decided upon. Now, let me tell you about the so-
called release of the statement. On the morning of Thursday, May 
5, was Khrushchev's announcement that the plane was shot down. 
Somewhere between 11 and 12 o'clock, I believe, the President directed 
an inquiry and public report on the missing plane, and as reported 
in the Herald Tribune?I do not have any other stenographic record?
in quotes, it says: 
At the White House, Mr. Hagerty announced at the direction of the President 
a complete inquiry is being made. The results of these inquiries, the facts as 
developed will be made public by the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration and the Department of State. 
BACKGROUND OF THE MAY 5 NASA RELEASE 
The reporters who had listened to Mr. Hagerty, many of them, 
came immediately to our public information office to obtain further 
information. We ourselves thought it was better to take the agreed-
upon answers to the questions, to write them into a statement, and 
give it to them all at once, rather than engage in a general free-for-all 
on this subject. I would like to emphasize that the text of that state-
ment as issued was not cleared with CIA or anyone else, although 
the information in it, the answers to the questions that are contained 
within it, were cleared with CIA, and I am told by them with State. 
The CHAIRMAN. You discussed all of the substantive facts and state-
ments in that with representatives of the CIA? 
Mr. DRYDEN. This is correct. It was not intended to give out a 
statement. We were confronted with a large group of reporters who 
wanted the facts. We could either engage in a general free-for-all 
discussion?we thought it preferable to take these facts, put them in 
a piece of paper and give it to all of them at once. 
CLEARANCE OF MAY 5 STATEMENT 
The CHAIRMAN. After consulting with CIA, you prepared this state-
ment, and they knew what the statement was? 
Mr. DRYDEN. I tried to say before that the statement itself or the 
facts that were collected in a statement was not cleared with anyone. 
The CHAIRMAN. With anyone ? 
Mr. DRYDEN. With anyone but ourselves. The substance of it had 
been cleared. The fact that it was written down in a statement on a 
piece of paper was not cleared with anyone. 
The CHAIRMAN. Before you issued this to the press, did you have 
anyone from the Department of State look at it and approve it?

Mr. DRYDEN. We had no contact with the Department of State. 
tut- direct contacts were solely with the CIA. 
The CHAIRMAN. Has no one ever advised you that the Department 
of Stale should be consulted when statements affecting our foreign 
pol icy are made ? 
Mr. DRYDEN. I was told that these statements had been cleared by 
CIA with State. I did not independently check that, fact. 
The Cl [AIRMAN. Who told you that? 
Mr. DRYDEN. The CIA people with whom we were dealing, sir. 
REASON FOR MENTTO NINO OTHER 13-2 BASES IN MAY 5 RELEASE 
The CHAIRMAN. What was the reason for saying in your statement 
I hat these planes were being used in Japan and Turkey and California. 
Why were you so specific about Japan and California ? 
Mr. IDuynEN. We were asked by the press, "How many 11-2 planes 
does NA SA have in its weather program? Where are they operat-
ing?" Now, much of this had been published in these documents to 
which I referred which had been publicly released. To take a specific 
one, one released just a few months ago in June 1959, this has 
been released generally, you will find in this that these operations--
The ComamAN. I don't wish you to read that memorandum. I 
only want to know your thinking. You issued this without checking 
it with i the State Department. Why did you state that they were 
operating out of Turkey? 
Mr. Daynnx. This published report ? 
The CHAIRMAN. YOU had already published it? 
Mr. DityDEN ( continuing). Had said, "These flights were made from 
base,s at Watertown Strip, Nevada." 
The CI [AIRMAN. I know, but those were weather flight s.

Senator MANSFIELD. Dr. Dryden, have all our 13-2's been recalled 
since the President's order of Thursday, a week ago, that there would 
be no further overflights of the Soviet Union? 
Mr. DRYDEN. Not to my knowledge, sir. I believe at the present 
time the airplanes are grounded. But T think this is a question again 
that the operating people will, have to answer. 
INCIDENT IN JAPAN 
Senator MANSFIELD. Do you recall the incident which occurred in 
Japan some months ago when a U-2, I assume, landed at Atsugi and 
GI's landed from a helicopter and ordered the Japanese civilians in 
the area to leave? 
Mr. DRYDEN. I remember the newspaper accounts of it. I have no

Time magazine 2 or 3 weeks ago. I was seeking collaboration of that 
story. But you have no personal knowledge whether it was true or 
false?

primarily observation and calculation concerning weather conditions?

Senator MANSFIELD. What is Dr. Glennan's position? You are 
the Administrator of NASA. 
Mr. DRYDEN. I am the Deputy Administrator. I appear because 
I was hero in 1956 through this program, from the beginning.

in Istanbul on Tuesday, May 3. The statement which we issued re-
cording the agreed-upon answers to questions was on Thursday, May 
5. If I might just continue this on Friday, May 6, a NASA 11-2 air-
plane was flown at Edwards Air Force Base, exhibited to the press, 
they saw the instruments that were used. They took movies of the 
airplane. On Saturday, May 7, Mr. Khrushchev reported that he, 
had the pilot. At 6 p.m. State issued a statement admitting the recon-
naissance flight. 
At 6:30 NASA directed all further inquiries to the State Depart-
ment.

I he result of previous interrogation by the press. 
Mr. DRYDEN. That is correct. 
Senator WILEY. When you issued it, you did not consult with Cen-
tral Intelligence? 
Mr. DRYDEN. Not on the statement itself but all of the questions 
had been taken up with them. We had no source of information. We 
asked how shall we reply to the name of the pilot, to the flight plan 
of the airplane, and the answers as given us are incorporated in the 
statement, although (he exact text was llot read back to CIA. 
PUBLIC RELEASES ON 11-2 WEATHER FLIGHTS

think you said, in 1959. 
Mr. DRYDEN. Well, the first press release on our "II-2 project was 
released on May 7, 1)56.

Mr. DRYDEN. Yes. 
Senator Winny. On what pages is the part you referred to, because 
I want it in the record. I want to try to get this story simple and 
clear. 
Mr. DRYDEN. On page 3 of this NASA memorandum which car-
ries a number, 4-17 591,, the flights were made from bases at Water-
town Trip, Nov., Lakenheath, England, Wiesbaden, Germany, Adana, 
Turkey and at Atsugi, japan. Two additional flights were made 
from a base in Alaska and these data have been combined with those 
from Japan in the statistical treatment.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
REASON FOR NASA STATEMENT 
Senator GORE. In response to a question by me, Secretary Dillon 
testified as follows: 
No, it was decided when we first heard of this, this news, as I said earlier this 
morning, at this National Security Council meeting or right after it that was 
held outside of Washington, that the State Department would handle the pub-
licity on this, and that we would make any statement that would be made, and 
it was known at that time that we would make a statement. 
That leads me to wonder why NASA was making a statement at 
all. 
Mr. DRYDEN. This information, this decision of which you speak 
was not transmitted to us. I would like to remind you that this is 
all within a few hours. The information we had was a statement 
made at the White House which I read to you that the reporters were 
referred to NASA and the State Department for the facts and this was 
the extent of my knowledge when the statement was issued. 
NASA UNAWARE OF DECISION TO LET STATE DEPARTMENT 
HANDLE PUBLICITY 
Senator GORE. Then you did not know that a high level decision 
had been made that the State Department would make whatever 
statement was made with respect to this. 
Mr. DRYDEN. That is correct. Within the 3 hours or so of this inter-
val, this was not passed to us, and I would again say that so far as 
we were concerned the cover story was in effect as the result of the 
collaboration with CIA for the period from May 1 to May 7, and we 
did nothing, we said nothing contrary to the agreed on facts relating 
to the cover story. 
Senator GORE. When did you first learn of this high level decision 
that the State Department would make whatever statement was made 
and would handle the publicity on this matter? 
Mr. DRYDEN. I think that after the statement was issued, there were 
some calls as to?I do not know how to place the time. The only 
thing I have been able to find in our records is an instruction to our 
people as of Saturday to refer all inquiries to the State Department. 
I believe that before that time, there had been some discussions of 
why the statement had been issued by us, and I have explained the 
reasons for that. 
Senator GORE. I will get to that in a moment. When did you first 
know that the decision had been made to which Mr. Dillon referred, 
that the State Department would make statements and would handle 
the publicity on this matter? You say you were not informed that 
the decision had been made at the time you made your statement. 
Mr. DRYDEN. It was subsequent to the day of May 5, May 6, or 
May 7. I have a record of May 7. After the State Department's 
statement at 6 p.m., that NASA would refer all inquiries to the State 
Department, I believe we were informed, probably on Friday the 6th, 
but I have no specific record. 
Senator GORE. Who informed you? 
Mr. DRYDEN. I think it was a telephone call. I just do not have 
a specific recollection whether it came as a telephone call or a contact 
with Dr. Glennan at lunch at the White House. I just do not recall, 
sir.

We can perhaps clear that up for the record after consultation, sir. 
Senator cl-oun. think it would be. well if you can do so. 
The following information was subsequently furnished :) 
STATEMENT BY DR, D RYDEN ON WHEN NASA WAR NOTIFIED as DECISION TO HAVE 
DEPART M EN T OF STATE HANDLE PUBLICITY ON tr--2 
The telephone logs: of Dr. Glennan and myself show no calls to or from the 
State Department on May 6 or 7, but it is my best recollection that we did learn 
of the decision on May B. 
QI 'ESTI )NS A NO ANSWERS PREPARED T() HANDLE INQUIRTES 
You have referred several times to questions and answers, or the 
answers to questions as the case may be, supplied to you by CIA. Do 
you have a copy of that question and answer series? 
Mr. DRYDEN. We may have some rough notation. What we did 
was record the types of questions that the press was asking us. We 
then took these types of questions to the CIA and discussed them with 
them as to the answers. 
[Deleted.] 
Senator (low:. -Was there not a typewritten copy ? 
Mr. DuynEN. To tlw best of my knowledge, no. 
Senator Gorm. But you do have some notes. 
Mr. DRYDEN. The statement itself enables you to reconstruct the 
questions. They are generally who was the pilot, what was the flight 
plan, where was the airplane supposed to go, what was the route, how 
many airplanes does NASA operate on weather missions, from what 
bases have these airplanes been operating? I think you can reconstruct 
the questions from the statement itself. I am not sure whether we 
can find the notes that someone may have written down to refresh his 
memory in discussing it. 
IN SIlO 'CT I o NS TO NASA / MAKE STATEN ENT 
Senator Gout:. Who instructed your Agency to make a statement.? 
Mr. DRYDEN. We were instructed to answer questions. 
Senator Gonn. By whom ? 
Mr. DuynEN. By the CIA, who said that this had been coordinated 
with the State Department. 
Senator Goan. And the CIA gave you instructions to respond to 
iluestions? 
Mr. DtivoEx. 'We asked for information. The operation was not 
ours. We had no knowledge of the operation itself. We said, "How 
shall we reply to I hese questions? You realize the, fact that we did 
not know very much about, where this airplane was, whether the 
Russians have the airplane, whether they have, the pilot. What do 
you want, us to say in this interim period ? Can we find out more 
about it ?" 
Senator GORE. You felt the burden of saying something, did you? 
Mr. I)WYDEN. We felt the burden of answering questions because 
for 4 years the existence of this NASA weather flight program had 
been known.

Mr. DRYDEN. The discussions I referred to, the visits of the press, 
were made within an hour or two of the making of that decision at a 
place outside of Washington, and it was not communicated to us 
within that 2-hour period. 
Senator GORE. You have told us it wasn't communicated to you at 
all. 
Mr. DRYDEN. Until the following day. 
Senator GORE. Until after you had made a statement? 
Mr. DRYDEN. A statement. To get the chronology again, this meet-
ing to which you refer, at which the decision was made, was on the 
morning of May 5, somewhere between 11 and 12 o'clock. A decision 
was made and Mr. Hagerty informed the press at the direction of 
the President that the facts would be obtained through NASA and 
State. The reporters came immediately over to our public informa-
tion section wanting to know some of these facts. 
Senator GORE. Do you know whether either Mr. Hagerty or Presi-
dent Eisenhower had been informed of this decision reached outside 
Washington? - 
Mr. DRYDEN. I think the President was outside Washington at the 
time. 
Senator GORE. It seems to me that I recall the President participated 
in this conference. 
Mr. DRYDEN. I just do not know the details of that. I think it was 
given in the testimony of the Secretary of State. 
Senator GORE. Wasn't that a meeting of the National Security 
Council? 
Mr. DRYDEN. I do not know that, to my knowledge. The statement 
was made that Mr. Eisenhower was at secret Civil Defense Head-
quarters. 
Senator GORE. Will you repeat that? 
Mr. DRYDEN. I say the statement says that President Eisenhower 
was at his secret Civil Defense Headquarters. 
REFERENCE TO MR. DILLON'S TESTIMONY REGARDING NASA'S ROLE 
Senator GORE. I will read from Mr. Dillon's statement: 
Now, Mr. IIagerty was not at the Security Council meeting, but he was at 
that area out there where this exercise was taking place and so he was aware 
of the fact that the State Department would be making a statement at noon 
that day at our regular press conference time. Actually, the statement was 
delayed 45 minutes. It was made at 12:45 when our regular daily press con-
ference took place. 
Senator GORE. Was it decided there that NASA would make a statement also? 
Mr. DILLON. It was not, to my knowledge, no. It was not decided there 
that NASA would make a statement. 
Senator GORE. Who made that decision? 
Mr. Dir,Lox. I think that you have to ask NASA. I don't know who made any 
such decision. 
So you say you decided upon instructions of CIA? 
Mr. DRYDEN. NO.

Senator GoittE. Just, how do you state it? 
Mr. DRYDEN. I stated that we had received word of the White 
House announcement, that the facts will be made public by NASA 
and the Department of State. Now, his means 1 suppose that within 
this 2- or 3-hour period this information was not transmitted to us. 
I do not know the reasons. 
Senator Gorm. Do you know if Mr. Hagerty called you or Mr. 
Bonney or anyone in the Department suggesting that a statement be. 
made? 
Mr. DRYDEN. Not, to my knowledge, sir. 
Senator GORE. My time is up. 
The CETAIRMAN. Yes. Senator Hickenlooper ? 
NASA ACTION BASED ON PREVIOUS UNDERSTAN DING WITH CIA 
Senator IlicKriNfoormi. Dr. Dryden, when the newsmen came to 
the information Department of NASA, did the Information Depart-
ment act on its Own ? 
ME. DRYDEN. No, I hey did not. They acted in consultation. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. With you? 
Mr. DRYDEN. With me; yes, sir. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. Was it in connection with that cork.ulta-
lion, based upon the information which you then had about Mr. Hag-
erty's statement, that you authorized the issuance of the statement by. 
the Information Service of NASA? 
Mr. DiryDEN. It was called a memorandum to the press. I did not 
attribute sufficient importance to the distinction between answering OW 
questions of reporters and giving them the same information on 
piece of paper. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. After you had made the statement, or your-
Information Department issued this statement, was this statement 
sent to the CIA or the State Department? 
Mr. DityDEN. It was sent--I do not know exactly what time. 
Senator IlicKENLoornit. And was the statement which was issued' 
by your Information Department?perhaps you have answered this, 
question?cleared with CIA in its context or with the- State Depart-
ment prior to the issuance by your Information Service?" 
Mr. DitynEN. I have answered that. The statement, as written,. 
was not cleared. 
The information in the statement had been previously cleared by 
CIA, with State. 
Senator II ICKTIN LOOPER. So that the statement was based, then,, 
upon the understandings which had previously been had? 
Mr. DRYDEN. This is correct. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. With CIA? 
Mr. DitynEN. This is correct. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. And with the State Department? 
Mr. Dliviwic. Nothing?no substantive information was added to it.. 
Senator HICK E N LOOPER. just to get this cleared up a little bit, after. 
you learned of the statement of Mr. Hagerty?which I believe was 
the source of your determination to make the May 5 statement?after-
von had learned of that, statement of Mr. Hagerty that NASA and 
the State Department, could give information on this matter, did you

Mr. DRYDEN. I did not. I say I perhaps erroneously did not see 
the difference between answering questions of a large number of 
reporters and putting the same thing down on a piece of paper. It 
is the same information. 
Senator HicKENLoorEa. I believe that is all, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Lausche ? 
Senator IIICTCFNLOOPER. I wanted to ask you for a copy of that

The CHAIRMAN. It is in the background documents. 
(See appendix 1, p. 180.) 
NO WRITTEN MEMORANDUM OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
Senator GORE. Also, I believe you were going to supply to the chair-
man the question and answer series. 
Mr. DRYDEN. I was going to see if there is around, a penciled 
memorandum of the c uestions. I am not sure that there is. 
Senator GORE. If t lere is? 
Mr. DRYDEN. If there is, I will supply it to the chairman. 
(The following information was subsequently furnished:) 
No memorandum Of questions and answers was made; the discussion was 
entirely oral.

Senator LAusonE. At the time you issued your statement you did 
not have knowledge of what the Soviet knew about it and what actu-
ally happened? 
MT. DRYDEN. We did not. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Did you have knowledge of the instructions that 
were given to the pilot? 
Mr. DRYDEN. No, sir. No knowledge about the operations. 
Senator LAUSCHE. And that is?
Mr. DRYDEN. We heard Khrushchev's press announcement, of 
course, that morning. 
Senator LAUSCHE. I think that is all that I have with this witness. 
The CHAIRMAN. You think that your position as an international 
weather gatherer has been compromised by this U.-2 incident? 
Mr. DRYDEN. Not so far. [Deleted.]

ROLE ;110 Iris DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN THE OVERFL1 GITT PROGRAM 
Elements of the Department of Defense gave technical advice, to 
the project. No military aircraft were used for these flights 
nor were the pilots military personnel. 
From time to time, the Director of the CIA, after obtaining the 
---eurrence of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, 
mine tided a series of programs to the President. 
lore p?riflcally, I reviewed program proposals embracing sev-
I priority missions, one or more of which it was proposed to 
execute in I he near future. Responsibility for the operational con-
duct of r ire program rested with the CIA. 
We obviously were interested in the results of these flights as we 
are in all of our Nation's intelligence collection results. 
]LIG I ITS GAVE VITAL INToalVIA7LION 
For example, from these flights we got information OD airfields, 
aircraft, missiles, missile testing and training, special weapons stor-
age, submarine production, atomic production and aircraft deploy-
ments, and things like these. 
These were all types of vital information. These results were con-
sidered in formulating our military programs. We obviously were 
the. prime customer, and ours is the major interest. 
TEST OF MILiTARY CO Al NIT I NICA TIONS 
Second ly, on a separate subject : 
One incident, and one over which: I assume full responsibility, is 
the calling of a test of the readiness of our military communications 
from Paris. In view of the fact that my action in this matter has 
been subject to some speculation, I would like to give you the facts. 
First; of all, our military forces are always on some degree of alert. 
So it is merely a matter of moving this degree or condition of alert 
up or down the scale. On Sunday night, Mny 15, we were already 
aware ofthe sense of the statement which Mr. Khrushehe,v was going 
to make the following morning. The conditions which he had set 
for his partioipation in the conference made it apparent even at the 
time that, he deliberately intended to wreck the conference. 
This communications alert was not an act that was either offensive 
or defensive in character. It was a sound precautionary measure,. 
It did not. meal] Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine personnel from 
leave. There was no Moveinent of forces involved. However, I want 
to emphasize that it did make certain that, if subsequent developments 
made neeessary a. higher state of readiness, such action could be taken 
promptly and convincingly. 
Under i he circumstances it seemed most prudent to me to increase 
the awareness of our unified commanders. Moreover, since the com-
mand and individuals concerned in the decision process, including 
the President, the Secretary of State, and myself, were overseas, it 
was important to check out our military communications. At about 
midnight.. Paris time, Sunday night, I requested that a quiet increase 
in command readiness, particularly with respect to communications 
be instituted without public notice, if possible.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 125 
One phase of our testing is to call no-notice exercises of our com-
mand communications. While some commands went further in exe-
cuting the instructions issued by the JCS as a result of my message 
than I had anticipated, I consider the order proper and absolutely 
essential. In similar circumstances I would take exactly the same 
action. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. 
PRESUMMIT DISCUSSION REGARDING SHSPENSION OF FLIGHTS 
Mr. Secretary, did you or any of your aides participate in any con-
ference prior to May 1 regarding the U-2 flights? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I was some weeks before 
May 1 briefed on the preliminary results of the April 9 flight. At 
that time, I was informed of a program of possible flights, one of 
which would be selected to be flown, and I gave my approval of that 
program. 
The CHAIRMAN. Was anything said at that time about a moratorium 
in view of the summit conference? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Who participated in that conference? 
Secretary GATES. That conference was in my office in the Pentagon, 
and was between myself and a man from CIA. 
The CHAIRMAN. Was anyone in the State Department present? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Do you know whether the State Department was 
Nape advised specifically of the plans for the May 1 flight? 
Secretary GATES. I don't know from my own knowledge, but I am 
perfectly certain that the Secretary of State was advised of the pro-
gram as I was. 
The CHAIRMAN. You didn't advise him nor was he represented at 
that meeting? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. And no one raised the question of whether or not 
there should be a suspension? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. In this conversation, it was a private 
conversation between the CIA representative and myself, and I was 
asked for my advice or approval of the program and I gave it. 
The CHAIRMAN. I understand that, but I merely meant that the 
question of whether or not there should be a suspension in view of the 
upcoming summit was not raised; is that correct? 
Secretary GATES. Not raised between the two of us, no, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Was it raised at any time? 
Secretary GATES. I didn't have any other discussions about the 
flight with anyone, Senator Fulbright. 
The CHAIRMAN. Then so far as you know, it was not raised? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
QUESTION OF ANY PRIOR SUSPENSION OF FLIGHTS 
The CHAIRMAN. To your knowledge, were any flights prior thereto 
ever suspended because of political meetings, that is, other than 
weather or military considerations? 
Secretary GATES. I have no knowledge of any suspension of any 
flights for those purposes.

The CHAIRMAN . There was no suspension to your knowledge when 
the ( Tanip David ;fleeting took place? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN Nor was there any suspension, so far as you know,

precisely whether during that period we flew any flights, Mr. Chair-

Secretary GATES. Yes, air. 
The CHAIRMAN. Do you regard it as an important loss that the 
flights have now been suspended? 
Secretary GATEs. I think that, through becoming compromised, we 
have lost an important source of intelligence. It has been a very 
suecessful program over the past. 
The CHA LIMAN. Then it is a great loss from your point of view not 
to have available ;my further Bights; is that. correct ? 
Secretary GATES. I think if we had been able to continue them with-
out. having been caught and therefore compromised the source, it 
would have been most useful.

Secretary GATEs. I believe that be did, Mr. Chairman, but I don't 
believe anyone. could specifically prove it. But I believe that he did. 
I believe he told tile truth. 
The enAiramAisi. If he knew about it, why did the incidents of May

were [deleted] aircraft high in his sky.

INITEA I. STATEMENT BY MR FORCE IN TURKEY 
The CHAIRMAN. how did it happen the Air Force. made the initial .1.1k 
statement of the missing plane? 
Secretary GATES. That. was a part of the cover story that was de-
cided upon and they issued this statement from the base in Turkey 
about a plane being missing. 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, does that indicate that you had arrived ahead 
of time in concert with the CIA upon proper procedure to be followed 
in case of a mishap? 
Secretary GATES. I was not familiar with the details of how a cover 
story would be executed. I was aware of the fact that a cover story 
e.xisted, and I imagine that when the details of it were put into 
operation, the Central Intelligence Agency went to work.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFEichiNuft 
Senator GORE. Was the cover story discussed there? 
Secretary GATES. No [deleted], Senator. 
There was a meeting of the small group after the NSC meeting?
Senator GORE. Did you participate? 
Secretary GATES. Where we discussed the Khrushchev statement. I 
participated with the President. It was not at the NSC meeting. 
Senator GORE. At this conference in which Mr. Khrushchev's speech 
was discussed, was the cover story discussed? 
STATE DEPARTMENT TO HANDLE RELEASES ON SUBJECT 
Secretary GATES. Well, I think it was discussed in a general manner 
but not in detail. It was decided at that meeting that the responsi-
bility for all releases pertaining to this matter would be handled by 
the Department of State. 
Senator GORE. Was there any discussion at this meeting of the 
advisability of telling the truth? 
Secretary GATES. I think I made a statement in that meeting, some-
thing to the effect that the prestige of the Presidency should not be 
involved in an international lie particularly when it would not stand 
up with respect to the facts. But that was the extent of the discussion. 
There was no decision. 
STATE DEPARTMENT'S COVER STORY 
Senator GORE. After this observation on your part, the State 
Department did issue a statement that was not true; is that the case? 
Secretary GATES. I think  
Senator GORE. Well, the record shows  
Secretary GATES. I think they issued a statement, that is right. I 
think they issued a part of the cover story statement after that meet-
ing; yes, sir. 
senator GonE. So there was no decision?although the question of 
involvement of the Presidency in what you call an international lie 
was discussed, and you expressed your view that it would be an unwise 
thing to involve the President in the cover story or in an interna-
tional, an official falsehood? 
Secretary GATES. If it turned out that Mr. Khrushchev had all the 
facts, which we subsequently found out that he had; yes. 
QUESTION OF THE PRESIDENT ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY 
Senator GORE. How did you think his involvement or his association 
with this incident in its ramifications could be avoided by an assump-
tion of responsibility by the President for the program? 
Secretary GATES. I believe the President did assume responsibility, 
and I believe he should have assumed responsibility. 
Senator GORE. Let me see if I understand you correctly. I cer-
tainly do not wish to make any implication at all. I do not wish to 
impute to you any meaning which you did not intend. Did I correctly 
understand you to say that this question was discussed at a small 
meeting following the NSC meeting on the 5th at which you partici-
pated as did the President? 
Secretary GATES. That is correct, Sin 
Senator GORE. Who else participated?

believe you deseri bed it. 
Secret ary GATES. 'lint is right. This depended on what, Mr. Khru-
shchev knew, when he knew it and. if he knew everything that he 
claimed to know. It turned out later he did. I believe, that the 
President should take t he responsibility for the truth, for telling the 
I ruth. That is my opinion. I did not know specifically at that, time 
the extent of Mr. Kinruslichev's knowledge. 
Senator Got:E. Yon have a mended your  
Secretary Al is. I didn't mean to he evasive, Senator. 
Senatt GonE. I muterstand, but, von have mmv amended, and I 
would like to clar'.'ify, if I may. I know you are not trying- to be 
evasive and I assure you that I am only seeking to develop the facts 
its they existed. The Government, has full leeway, so far as II am 
concerned, to exercise censorship for se,curity. 
Now, when you 'xpressed the view that the Presidency should not 
he involved in an unemotional lie, did you at that I line, outhe 5th, 
suggest the, President should assume responsibility, or was this on the 
7th or the 9th that von expressed that additional view ?

17,1E OF DISCUSSIONS ON MAY 5 
Senator GORE. Did you express 1he view on the 5th that the Presi-

t he 9th ? 
Secretary GATES. .1 expressed the view on the 51,11 flint if Mr. Khru-
shchev had the complete information and the pilot, that the President 
should assert the true story. 
I expressed it again on the 9th when we knew that ha had the plane 
and the pilot,. [Delet ed. 
Senator GoRE. You were informed that Mr. Khruslichey had made 
the public, speech with respect to the plane, that it was shot down or 
that it came down iii the vicinity of Sverdlovsk ? 
Secretary GATEs. Yes. I am not sure of my timine, Senator. We 
tale:W some informal ion on the 5th, but we knew a great deal more a 
day later. He didn't report the full story until the 7th.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Secretary GATES. That is correct. 
Senator GORE. A decision to tell the truth was not reached at this 
meeting on the 5th? 
STATE DEPARTMENT TO HANDLE ALL GOVERNMENT RELEASES ON 
SUBJECT 
Secretary GATES. That is right, Senator. The only decision that 
was reached at that meeting was that all the statements pertaining to 
the incident would be handled by the Department of State. 
Senator GORE. What information was the State Department to give? 
Was it specifically understood at the meeting that the cover story 
would be continued? 
Secretary GATES. Yes; I think it was assumed that the cover story 
'would be continued at that time. 
Senator GORE. And the cover story was untrue? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. It turned out to be untrue. I mean, 
yes, because it was untrue. We didn't have the full facts that we 
had 2 days later. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator's time has expired. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Senator WILEY. Mr. Secretary, I have listened to this interroga-
tion. Now see if you can't tell us the story without questioning, 
starting in when you first became acquainted with the facts, who was 
there, what was said, and then go on. 
For instance, we have heard so many statements about something 
not being true. Now this release on May 5 was the cover story, 
wasn't it 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator WILEY. When did you first get acquainted with the situa-
tion? Start in the beginning and give it consecutively so that it 
will be clear. 
CHRONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT 
Secretary GATES. I first got involved in the situation when the 
airplane did not return to base. I knew an airplane was down, pre-
sumably because it hadn't come back and it had taken off. That 
was on May 1. 
I had no other relationship with it until the morning of Thursday, 
which was May 5 when we had a [deleted] meeting of the NSC at 
a remote location under a. civil defense exercise. 
On that morning, there was the preliminary statements of Mr. 
Khrushchev that we had been flying over his territory, and so forth. 
After the NSC meeting' there was a small meeting at which I have 
listed the members present, in which we discussed this matter. 
Senator WILEY. Who was there? 
Secretary GATES. Mr. Dillon of the State Department, Mr. Allen 
-Dulles, Mr. Gordon Gray, General Goodpaster, and myself and the 
President. We discussed this whole matter. We made the decision 
there that the matter would be handled by the Department of State, 
and we adjourned. 
I had no further participation or discussion concerning the incident 
until the following Monday morning. 
Senator WILEY. What date?

132 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Secretary GATES. Which was the 9th. I at that time participated 
in. a meeting in the office of the Secretary of State, and he issued his 
complete statement. 
Senator WILEy. llave you got one of these pamphlets in front of 
you? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator WILEY. See if we can't get into the record that which is on 
page 4 for the press. That is the cover story up at the top? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator WILEY. A nd. that is the one that had been said was a lie? 
Secretary GATES. This was a cover story; yes, sir. 
Senator WILEY. This was issued when you had only part of the 
facts; isn't that ? 
Secretary GATES. Thai, is right. 
Senator WILEY. On May 9, if you will turn to page 5, you have. 
the Department of State's release. 
Senator WILEY. Was there one issued on May 9? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
THE PRESIDENT ['RESENT ONLY AT MAY 5TH MEETING 
Senator WILEY. At any of these meetings, was the President there? 
Secretary GATES. The only meeting the President attended was the 
meeting of May 5th, after the NSC meeting. 
Senator WILEY. I didn't understand. Was he there on the 5th ? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir; after the NSC meeting. That is the only 
meeting at which he was present. 
DECISION ON ALERT 
Senator WILEY. When it was decided to have the alert, was that the 
judgment of all that, it was in the interest of the national defense? 
Secretary GATES. It was my judgment and. I was responsible. 
Senator WILEY. You had in mind, did you, what the condition of 
this country was at, the time of Pearl Harbor, how we were asleep? 
Secretary G's. I certainly did. 
Senator WILEY. During negotiations. 
Secretary GATES. I did, indeed. 
Senator WILEY. is it your judgment from the. facts that when 
Ichrushchey went to Paris that he had already made up his mind to 
call off the summit meeting? 
Secretary GATES. Yes; it is my judgment, Senator. 
MEETING ON MAY 5 
Senator WILEY. Something was said by yourself in the cross-exami-
nation to the effect that you claimed they should tell the truth. When 
was that, on the 5th ? 
Secretary GATES. I said on the 511i, if it proved that Mr. Khrushchey 
had the pilot, had the equipment, had the full and complete story, it 
later turned out that he had, that I believed we should tell the truth 
at that time. 
Senator WILEY. That is all, Mr. Chairman.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT UOINFEBEN 
REFORMS IN DEFENSE DEPARTMENT 
Senator MANSFIELD. Mr. Secretary, since you have become Secre-
tary of Defense, you have made it a point to sit in on the meetings 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and if an agreement could not be reached 
you make the final decision. 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator MANSFIELD. In that period you have also brought about re-
forms and increased the efficiency of the centralized purchasing 
system. 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator MANSFIELD. In that period you have also brought about a 
centralization of the communications system. 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator MANSFIELD. For all those you are to be most highly com-
mended because I think they were reforms long overdue and it was 
about time they were put into effect. 
REASONS FOR ALERT 
Now, at the time you issued your alert of the communications system 
in Paris did you have any information that Soviet forces were massing 
or mobilizing? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Did any one person or any group ask you to 
order the alert? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. 
Senator MANSFIELD. YOU did that entirely on your own respon-
Now sibility ? 
Secretary GATES. That is correct, Senator. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Did the alert order which you issued put the 
forces of this country at a war readiness level? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. 
Senator MANSFIELD. There was no call back of Reserves or cancel-
lation of leave to any extent. 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. There were in one or two instances some 
people who interpreted the JCS order as meaning that they would 
have a couple of more aircraft on alert, and in that case, they, on their 
own, recalled, I believe some pilots who were home or off duty to have 
approximately two more airplanes on an alert status. But this was 
done on their own, testing their own alert procedures under the broad 
order that was issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
It was not the intention of this order to move forces in any way. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Now, that JCS order was in response to your 
order? 
Secretary GATES. That is right, Senator. 
Senator MANSFIELD. Is there any connection between this communi-
cations alert and the recent centralization of the communications 
system? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir, because that will not be in effect in its 
entirety for approximately 9 months. 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT 
Senator MANSFIELD. Now, during the course of your responses to 
Senator Gore, you mentioned the following words, "The prestige of 
the Presidency should not be involved."

134 EVENTS IN CI DEN T TO THE SUMMIT CONyu1ENCE 
Isn't it true that in almost any undertaking, in a general .way the 
prestige of the Prosidency is always involved under our constitutional 
system of government ? 
Secret ary rta i 
Senator MANSf !ELI). What I am getting at there is this: That 
whether or not he had any specific knowledge of this particular flight 
or of this particular order, which you issued, that nevertheless under 
our system he is generally responsible for actions undertaken by the 
head of the CIA and for actions and orders issued by the Secretary 
of l)efeitse; is that correct ? 
Secretary GATEs. lie is the head of the executive branch and he, is 
Commander in Chief, Senator, so of course lie ,s responsible in that 
sense. 
Serial or MANsrifio. Yes. he is generally responsible.

story and the fact that it is not truthful. Well, isn't a cover story 
by its very nature, almost a I ways a, lie ? 
Secretary (3,1TES, Ye:--;, Sc t cit or.

repeated shit omen, s from the Kremlin in the last weeks, months, or 
iwen years that contained threats of what the Kremlin is ready to do 
to the West generally or to the United States under a variety of 
i'onditiolis; isn't that correct ? 
Secretary GATEs. Yes, it is. 
Senator IlicKENtoorra. I believe Ali% Khrusluhev has been quoted 
as saying that lie .,.vould bury us--whether he meant economically or 
militarily might be argued --and I believe, he slated that they have

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 135 
Secretary GATES. I don't know of any flights over East Germany 
recently, but, of course, they have some 20 divisions in East Germany. 
Senator IIICKENLOOPER. I don't know whether this Comes within 
your time or not, but I have heard in one way or another in times 
past that they have repeatedly had large air forces in the air over 
East Germany. 
Secretary GATES. They have large air forces stationed in East Ger-
many. 
Senator ITICKENLOOPER. I mean in the air. 
Secretary GATES. They have had maneuvers, yes, sir. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. They have had maneuvers toward the West 
German border which come very close to the West German border 
on occasion? 
Secretary GATES. They have had them regularly; yes, sir. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. Sometimes these are rather massive maneu-
vers in the air? 
Secretary GATES. I believe that is correct; yes, sir. 
JUSTIFICATION FOR ALERT 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. Well, now, recently we have heard a great 
deal of discussion and argument about keeping all of our strategic 
Air Force planes or a great many of them in the air all the time. 
There have been some that have advocated that and criticized us for 
not keeping our airplanes in the air more than we have. 
Secretary GATES. I am very familiar with this argument, with the 
Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee. 
Senator IlickENLoorEn. I presume you do not see anything un-
warranted about this air alert which you ordered, but I will ask you 
the question anyway. Do you see any reason for criticism because of 
a demonstration by your Department of a worldwide air alert of our 
forces? 
Secretary GATES. I stated when I got off the airplane and was 
asked the question by the press on my return, I said it was incredible 
to me that anybody would question it. 
Senator I ICKENLOOPEll. Well, I agree with that statement, but 
there seems to be SOITle criticism nevertheless. 
ADVIS ABILITY OF OVERFLIGHT BEFORE SUMMIT CONFERENCE A POLITICAL 
QUESTION 
Now, on the question of whether or not, that is from your view-
point, in your Department, the particular IT-2 flight should have been 
cancelled on the 30th of April, or the 1st of May, or whenever it 
'occurred, isn't that a political question and not a military question? 
Secretary GATES. Yes. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. That is in view of the so-called summit 
'conference? 
Secretary GATES. Yes. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. That becomes exclusively a political ques-
tion as to whether or not it was advisable at that time from the stand-
point of the summit conference?

Senator Iftexmv toOPER., And I take it that from the standpoint 
of primary responsibility you have nothing to say about whether it 
would be cancelled or not as a political gesture in view of a political 
conference ? _ 
Secretary GATES. Well, 1, of course, knew of the date of the sum-
mit meeting, and if I_ had had a strong conviction about it I would 
have said it even though I didn't have the responsibility for the 
decision. I was in an advisory capacity, but I believed that there 
was really no good time to stop the collection of important informa-
tion. There is always some international conference or something. 
Senator HICKEN LoopER. What I am trying to get itt :is whether you 
have any primary responsibility for making political decisions, or is 
your responsibility military decisions? 
Secretary GATES. No, my responsibility is with the Departmens of 
Defense. 
VALUE OF U-2 FLIGHTS 
Senator fficanNtooetat. Now, these 15-2 flights have been extreme-
ly valuable in the securing of intelligence, have they not? 
Secretary GATES. They have indeed, Senator. 
Senator HicianNtoorm. They have also been very valuable in secur-
ing weather information, have they not? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. [Deleted.] 
A 1 WI SABILITY OF ALERT 
Senator fficknictoornit. Do you believe that, in view of the general 
tensions that exist and the rather jingoist statements, let's say, that 
have been emanating from the Kremlin from time to time, it was a 
beneficial thing to have this air alert as not only a show of strength 
but as an assurance to our friends and allies over the world that we 
had a readiness capability? 
Secret cry GATEs. I do. It was not an air alert, Senator. 
Senator IThroanNnoorna. Sir? 
Secretary GATES. It was not an air alert. I think you miss--tech-
nically, you said air alert. It was a command readiness and com-
munications alert. I agree, however, with what you said that it was 
a good thMg to do. 
Senator flickENtoortat. I shall adopt your description for my 
question, then, on that point. 
But anyway, it was a show of ability on our part in connection 
sith our alertness, general alertness, and our ability to put a defensive 
'force, into the air in a short time? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, mid we could go from there to further meas-
ures if we needed to, but this was primarily a measure of checking 
command and checking communications, particularly, as I said in 
my statement, in view of the fact that the persons involved in im-
portant policy decisions were out of the country. 
Senator llacKENamorna, Would you agree that it either does have, 
or should have, a certain degree of comforting effect upon not only 
our own country but upon our allies that we do have these capabilities?

Secretary GATES. I Would hope it would, Senator. It seems to 
me this is our responsibility, to be ready and alert under these 
circumstances at all times, and we always are. 
This was merely a matter of degree. It was a little increase in the 
degree of alertness. We are in an alert condition at all times. 
ANOTIIER COMMUNICATIONS ALERT ORDERED 
As of midnight last night we are having another communications 
exercise, starting at 11 o'clock last night, and it is going for several 
days. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. This fact that we may be always alert some-
times is not fully appreciated except on occasional demonstrations of 
that. 
Secretary GATES. That is right, and the Joint Chiefs, as a result of 
this experience and critique of it have recommended to me that we 
have these alerts on a no-notice basis more frequently. 
Senator HICKENLOOPER. Thank you. My time is up.

QUESTION OF ADVANCE PLANNING FOR ACTION IN EVENT U-2 PLANE 
DOWNED 
Senator LONG. Did you advise or consult as to whether we were to 
admit that we authorized these flights if and when the Soviets did 
succeed in bringing one of our planes down? 
irsof Secretary GATES. If we should continue them or not? 
Senator LONG. No, no. What I meant is this: As a matter of fore-
handedness?I see a naval officer sitting behind you?they taught 
me the definition of that word as a midshipman?I am sure that you 
anticipated that sooner or later they were going to bring one of our 
planes down. 
Secretary GATES. We knew it was a dangerous occupation; yes, 
Senator. 
Senator LONG. You could anticipate that sooner or later one of 
these planes was going to fall into enemy hands? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator LONG. There was a distinct possibility at any moment, 
and had you advised and consulted as to how this matter should be 
handled if and when such an event materialized? 
Secretary GATES. No; I had not, Senator. I was only aware of 
the fact that a cover story existed, but I had no part in it. 
Senator LONG. And you had not been advised as to what the position 
of this country was going to be in the event that that happened? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir; this was not my responsibility. 
Senator LONG. Senator Young passed up two questions he would 
like for me to ask. I will just ask them on my time since I have no 
further questions. 
He says if it were essential

be made for years, right up to and including May 1, is the defense of

t ;on that we were gathering with the I flights? 
Secretary GATES. We need a continuity of this information, I think, 
Senator. 
Senator LONG. Then if that be the case, in your judgment was it 
essential or advisable that the flight of May 1 should not have been

time the Communists might be considering or planning surprise action 
ii any part of the world? 
Secretary GATEs. No, sir, I felt that the situation was one that was 
at best, not very constructive. We knew the sense of Mr. Khrushches,7's 
remarks, but I did not anticipate a surprise attack. 
1 didn't order that kiml of an alert. 
Senator AtkEN. In other words, it seemed like a good thing: to do 
at the tire?

missile to that base. What is your judgment as to the seriousness of 
that threat? 
Do you think it is a bluff or do you think that he means it? 
Secretary GATES. Well, Senator' this is awfully hard to know. lle 
must know that if he did such a thing that we have allied commit-, 
ments. If it was an allied country, for example, he would be starting, 
a very major problem for himself. 
Senator MORSE. That is the point I want to raise. 
Secretary GATES. And this would only be done with the assumption, 
that he would take the consequences of an act that would probably 
start a general war. [Deleted.] 
Senator Mousu. Doesn't it seem to imply, Mr. Secretary, that if he? 
is not bluffing, that they thereby mean to start a general war over ? 
espionage activity on the part of the United States or any other for-- 
eiom power that sends a spy plane- over their territory? 
Doesn't that seem to be  
Secretary GATEs. If I understand your question, Senator, I think' 
he must take the responsibility for starting a general war or very - 
likely starting a general war if he hits one of our Allied bases for any ? 
reason. 
Senator MORSE. Could it possibly imply that the Russians are of the: 
opinion that our power of both defense and aggression is such that 
they are willing to take it on? To put my question a different 
way  
Secretary GATES. I doubt very much that they are willing to take. 
it now. I think they absolutely know they will commit suicide the 
Nue moment they try it because I think they are fully informed in every. 
way possible about, practically, the exact defense posture of the 
United States. 
Senator MORSE. If that is true, and I think it is true, that they ought 
to know that if they get involved in a nuclear war there can't be any 
victory for them, and I doubt if there could for us, but apparently 
this type of military mind in Russia possessed by their air marshal is 
ready to start a nuclear war. Wouldn't that be a fair deduction -from, 
this threat unless it is a bluff? 
Secretary GATES. Senator Morse, I think it is a part of a stepped-
up, cold war aggressive, propaganda campaign. That is what I think. 
it really is, because I don't believe that Mr. Khrushchev wants to, 
start a war which he knows will be the end of his country. 
Senator MoRsE. I am inclined to think that is probably true of. 
Khrushchev. But the reason I am asking this line of questions is. 
to find out from you if the leaders in our country have reason to 
believe that Khrushchev is being pushed in Russia by a preventive 
war group that entertains the point of view that sooner or later they. 
are going to have to fight the United States, and that they think. 
probably now is a better time to do it than later. 
Do we have any intelligence information that would justify our. 
belie-vino- that a military group in Russia is now taking over and, 
pushing Khrushchev to the side? 
Secretary GATES. We do not have. We can at this time only 
speculate. It might be possible that the military- group has come, 
into more power in Russia or that Mr. Khrushchev may have hadl 
some of his power diluted. This is, however), ilD5t speculatiOn? anct

it, is, I suppose, rather dangerous to speculate, but we do not have any 
hard facts on the subject. 
LN ELDEN CE OF, A ND DANGER IN, SOVIET MILITARY IIIERARCITY 
Senator MORSE. I understand they have. some 2:")0,000 military 
officers, army and naval and air. Could it be possible that within 
Ole military in Russia they see the possibility of reaching an agree-
ment on total disarmament which means that they would be moved 
out of the very favored position in Russian society they now occupy, 
and that we need, to be on the alert to the possibility that a great 
military change is taking place in Russia in the form of a military 
hierarchy taking over control from the Communist leadership ? 
Secretary GATES. Well, I_ couldn't agree with you more, sir, that 
we should certainly be Oil the alert to t his possibility and continuously 
so. I agree that we must consider this as one of the possibilities. 
Senator MORSE. AVbat concerns me is that as far as their leadership 
is concerned and as far as I have any reason to believe, based upon 
be briefings we have had from our own American leaders, we are 
dealing with a group of very amoral leaders in Russia. And when 
you get amoral leaders among the military establishments, such as they 
have, I think we ha Ve cause for concern as to whether or not even in 
desperation they might not be willing to start a war. And if this is 
more than propaganda, if this is more than bluff, if this is more than 
what you suggest might be the case of a new step-up in the cold war 
to try to frighten our allies, then we have to take a long look, it seems 
to me, as to our responsibility to history in respect to following an 
espiona,ge course that might cause these amoral men in desperation 
to start a war because i here is always the hope on our part that we 
may be able to contain them until we can negotiate through the 
United Nations a workable and enforceable total disarmament 
program. 
NEED FOR INFORMATION BALANCED AGAINST POTENTIAL DANGER 
I have raised this question because I don't think that in terms of 
history we can completely ignore our responsibility in dealing with a 
group of desperadoes such. as I think the Russian military people are, 
and so it raises the quest ion how far we can justify going morally, in 
connection with MI espionage system such as the E.-2 system, when we 
know we are dealing with a group of amoral military leaders in Russia 
who might start a nuclear war because of their completelagtk of appre-
ciation for the value of human life. 
It puts us :in a difficult position, it seems to me. I'Ve have our own 
security to protect, we luwe our duty to gather information, but the 
nature of the "beast" with whom we are dealing--in quotation marks 
.1 put the word, of course?nevertheless puts upon us some responsi.-
1,ility, it seems to me, to not go too far in our own espionage program 
r by going a certain distance might indirectly put us in a position 
where history might record that we knew we were dealing, with -Hutt 
kiml of a gang and knowing it we nevertheless followed an espionage 
course of action that they considered so violated their sovemign rights 
hat they were willing then to take that last step into a nuclear war.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Secretary GATES. Well, the Senator can speculate more intelligently, 
I am sure, than I can on military people. 
Senator MORSE. Not at all. 
Secretary GATES. But basically military people are conservative, 
worldwide and basically they are well informed on military matters, 
and therefore, the military in the Soviet Union should know better 
than the political leaders that they will be lost, and slaughtered and 
devastated in a nuclear war. 
On the other question, it seems to me again as a lay person that our 
survival is at stake. If he threatens us, I have repeatedly testified in 
Congress, that I didn't think he intended to make any significant 
concessions at any meeting, that we have not prepared our defense pro-
gram on that basis, that we had to keep it under continuous review, at 
all times, and with a completely closed country, and our survival 
threatened, if he builds up a capability for a surprise attack, it seems 
to me absolutely vital that we obtain all the information we can from 
every source. 
Senator MORSE. Thank you very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Indiana. 
Senator CAPEIIART. I have DO questions except I will say I think 
you did the right thing by ordering the alert. 
I hope that you will continue to be on alert. I hope you will con-
tinue to get intelligence on Russia in every conceivable way we can. 
The CHAIRMAN. IS that all? 
The Senator from Ohio. 
SECRETARY GATES' SERVICE IN DEFENSE DEPARTMENT 
Senator LAUSCHE. Mr. Gates, how long have you been the Secretary 
of Defense? 
Secretary GATES. Only since last December, sir. 
Senator Lauscuu. Were you in the Department prior to that time? 
Secretary GAITS. Yes, sir; I have been there since 1953, in the De-
partment. 
Senator LAuscllE. In what capacity? 
Secretary GATES. I was Under Secretary of the Navy, then Secre-
tary of the Navy, then Deputy Secretary of Defense. 
SOVIET KNOWLEDGE OF OVERFLIGHTS 
Senator LAUSCHE. Based upon your knowledge, when did the Soviet 
hierarchy first know of the fact that there were foreign planes flying 
over the Soviet? 
Secretary GATES. I don't think we can confirm, Senator. We just 
have to take Mr. Khrushchev's statements at face value. 
I think that it is debatable how much he knew. I assume he knew 
that there were planes flying. He said he knew. He says he had 
known since he was here in the United States. But I don't think we 
,can definitely confirm this. 
Senator LAuscuE. Testimony has been given by some witness 
that, I think on July 2, 1956, he made a protest that there was a plane 
overhead in the Soviet.

a public protest of overflights in July of 1956.

ment that he knew al., the time that he was at Camp David that planes 
Were flying overhead ? 
Secretary GATEs. sir; he did. 
Senator LAtiscitn. Then the proof indicates that at the time he was 
invited to the 11114(41 States, at the time he went to Camp David, and 
at. the time, that, he arranged for the summit eonfereiwe, he knew of-

Senator LA-usco E, Now, then, what, in your opinion, motivated him 
in agreeing to ha ve a summit conference, accepting our invitation to 
come to the I Tinted States, meeting with the President., while he knew 
that this supposed grave transgression of his rights was taking place? 
Secretary GrATES. 1 can only hazard again a, personal opinion, Sen-
ator. My opinion is that he believed that fie could not make any 
pi ogTess at the summit meeting., and he made it pre-posit ioned, he took 
a pre-posit ion?made a, brief on it and came to Paris to wreck the 
summit quite apart from the I .1-2 incident.

Secretary GATES. Or from the FBI. 
Senator LAUSCHE. In the Soviet, all things are hemmed in against 
an individual getting into proximity of their bases. Am I correct in 
that? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
.Senator LAUSCHE. Does that situation prevail in our country? 
:Secretary GATES. It certainly does not, Senator. 
'Senator LAUSCHE. Then there is a tremendous difficulty in the ability 
,of obtaining intelligence by our agents in the Soviet as compared to 
:their ability, through their agents in our country? 
Secretary GATES. That is correct; and there is obviously no reason 
for him to overfly the United States. 
IMPORTANCE OF U-2 FLIGHTS 
Senator LAUSCIIE. Based upon the knowledge that you acquired 
through the U--22's, what would be your opinion about our intellectual 
:ability to pursue properly the development of our national defense? 
Secretary GATES. I think we had a responsibility to take every 
means we could. 
Senator LAUSGIIE. That is not my question. My question is, If you 
did not ha.ve the knowledge acquired through the U-2's, could you 
have intelligently developed your national defense to cope with the 
actual, potential military power of the Soviet? 
Secretary GATES. Not as well, Senator; by no means. 
Senator LAUSCHE. By no means whatsoever? 
Secretary GATES. We have other means. 
Senator LAUSCIIE. Yes? 
Secretary GATES. That gives us other information, but this was a 
very importance piece of information. 
Senator LAUSCHE. If you didn't have that information, do you feel 
that the security of our country in all probability would have been 
affected because of our inability to develop properly our military 
!strength? 
Secretary GATES. I think this was?I want to be careful in my an-
swer because this is one source of several sources of intelligence. It 
is a very important one. I think it would have been affecting our 
ability to properly defend the United States if we didn't have this 
information. 
DEMANDS PRESENTED BY IiIIRUSIICEIEV 
Senator LAUSCHE. Now, getting down to the matter of the May 16 
meeting, have you formulated any opinion as to whether Khrushchev, 
when he left Moscow, already had prepared these four unacceptable 
demands that he made upon the President with respect to the U-2 
incident? 
Secretary GATES. Everyone is entitled to a personal Opinion, Sena-
tor. I have an opinion, yes, sir, that he had very definitely, because 
the moment he arrived in Paris he presented these conditions to Mr. 
,de Gaulle along with a copy already in French. 
Senator LAUSCUE. That is?the fact is that he was supposed to go 
to Paris on May 15; Sunday? 
Secretary GATES. Yes; he came on Saturday night, I believe.

Senator LATTSCHE. This is merely asking for your opi nion.

Secretary GAtEs. I certainly do not. I certainly believe he could 
Dot, I guess, would be a better answer. 
Senator LATTSCHE. I am of the opinion that when Khrushehev left 
Moscow he knew there was not to be a summit conference. He pre-
pared his paper. He had his mode of operation completely outlined. 
Secretary GATES. I. share that point of view, Senator. 
SifOITLD TT-2 FLIGHTS ItAVE BEEN SUSPENDED BEFORE SUMMIT CONFERENCE? 
Senator LATISOHE, Now, you have stated that you did not feel that 
we could, in the face of these discussions about a summit conference. 
suspend our activities with respect to the security of the country; 
is that right? 
Secretary GATES. [hat is right, sir. 
Senator LAUSCHE. H there was to be a temporary suspension of 
these IJ-2: flights, when should they have begun? This is speculation. 
am just trying to search it out. The discussions for a summit confer-
ence preceded by far the September visit in the United States, and 
then from Sept ember to May 16 practically 9 months elapsed. Should 
we, last September, have discontinued our U-2 flights? 
Secretary GATES. Not in my judgment, Senator. 1 think it would 
have been most incorrect to have suspended them. 
Senator LATTSCHR. DO you believe the Soviet, because of the ar-
entged summit conference, discontinued its activities?

QUESTION OF ALTERNATIVES TO MAY 9 STATEMENT OF STATE DEPARTMENT 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, referring just a moment to a pre-
vious question, on the May the 9th meeting in which the issuance of 
the statement by the Department was considered, were there any alter-
native statements proposed and considered to the one which was 
issued? 
Secretary GATES. Not in principle, Senator Fulbright. 
The CHAIRMAN. Not in principle? 
Secretary GATES. But there were, of course, various language ver-
sions considered. 
The CHAIRMAN. Did anyone at that meeting raise the point that 
for the President, the Chief of State, to assume personal responsi-
bility would be a departure from the historical practice of this 
country? 
Secretary GATES. I think this was understood, Senator, and I be-
lieve that we felt the circumstances were different from anything 
that had prevailed heretofore. 
The CHAIRMAN. But the point was raised and discussed? 
Secretary GATES. I can't accurately say that it was raised and dis-
cussed but it was certainly in my mind and I believe it was obvious 
to all of us that it was a departure from precedent. 
The CHAIRMAN. It was a departure from precedent in this coun-
try. Do you know of any other country that has followed this 
policy? 
Secretary GATES. No; I do not. 
The CHAIRMAN. Was anyone concerned that this might have far-
reaching implications for the future of our intelligence operations? 
Secretary GATES. Well, we knew that it already had marked the 
end of this particular method of collection of intelligence because of 
its being compromised [deleted]. 
The CHAIRMAN. Did I understand you to say that to your knowledge 
there was no time in the last few years, in which you are familiar 
with our activity, that IT-2 flights were suspended for political reasons. 
Secretary GATES. Not to my knowledge, Senator; that is correct. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, were you over consulted with regard 
to the wisdom of holding a summit conference? 
Secretary GATES. No; I was not, Senator. 
POSSIBILITY OF AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA ON DISARMAMENT AND NUCLEAR 
TESTING 
The CHAIRMAN. Do you personally believe there is any reasonable 
hope for any agreement with the Russians with regard to disarma-
ment? 
Secretary GATES. I think it is extremely doubtful, Mr. Chairman. I 
think that the Soviets are playing off-and-on-again tactics; some-
times cool, sometimes cold, sometimes hot.

Captain JOHNSTON. By the committee, Senator. 
The CHAIRMAN. May I ask the stair, did you release it? 
Mr. MA_Roy. No, Mr. Chairman, this will just be released in the

and, unless they took any portion of it out, it went to the public. 
The CHAIRMAN. I just was wondering. 
Secretary GATES. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, I considered it your 
prerogative. I have no objection one way or the other. 
The CHAIRMAN. It usually follows the same procedure. You make 
the statement and then it goes through the record if the censors wish it. 
Was this statement cleared with the State Department before you 
made it? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator LAUSCHE. Mr. Chairman, may I suggest that we find out 
whether a copy got in the hands of the newspapermen other than 
through normal sources here. 
Mr. MARcy. No, sir, that did not happen, not through the commit-
tee. Everything goes through the regular process, through the cen-
sors, and so on. 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, I asked the clerk a moment ago if you had

TIMING OF KIIRUSIICHEV'S DECISION TO WRECK SUMMIT 
The CHAIRMAN. You stated very positively that you believed the 
Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Khrushchey, before he 
came to Paris, had already made up his mind to wreck the summit. 
Can you tell us how and why you arrived at that opinion? 
Secretary GATES. Well, I felt, and again speaking personally, I 
felt that the fact that he arrived on Saturday night and asked for 
these appointments with President de Gaulle, and Prime Minister 
Macmillan, and he arrived with a position paper translated in French 
in the case of de Gaulle and given orally by translation in English 
to Macmillan, a position paper that he used almost verbatim as the 
first part of his text the following morning, was pretty good indica-
tion that he had a preconceived plan at the summit meeting and was 
planning to, in my judgment again, and used the fact that there were 
3,000 newspapermen in Paris and he had a platform to issue all of 
these statements from. Then I believe there were indications in other 
speeches that he made prior to the summit that he was going to adopt 
later on. 
The CHAIRMAN. What in your opinion caused him to arrive at this 
conclusion to wreck the conference?

1.18 EVENTS IMIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Secretary GATES. Why, I believe that he found that he had been 
unsuccessful in creating any disunity among the allies. That he was 
not going to get any substantive concessions himself, according to his 
(JaIns, on Berlin and other critical issues that he might consider im-
portant, and that he wasn't going to get a blanket disarmament cheek 
ithout controls, and so .forth. And I believe he felt that he was not 
goin g to make any pro ;;Tess at the summit. 
EFFECT OF T "II- 2 INCIDENT ON KHRUSIICHEV'S SUMMIT ACTIONS 
The CHAIRMAN. 100 you believe the U-2 incident contributed to 
that belief? 
, Secretary GATES. .1_, frankly in my judgment it did not, Senator 
Fulbright. I believe it gave him, it contributed to his public case, but 
don't think it contribined to his position. 
The CHAIRMAN. on don't think that was a significant element in 
,,uusing him to arrive at this conclusion? 
Secretary GATES. .f .(vally do not; no, sir. I believe it was a factor 
in his, an important fact or in helping him make his case, but I don't 
think- it lad anything to do with his policy decision. 
The CIE AIRMAN. Why do you think he would be better off and what 
reasoning leads you to this conclusion? Why is he better off having 
f.(Alowed the course he (lid, than having gone to the conference and 
raving it result in no concessions? 
Secretary GATES. 014 he can answer that, Senator. 
The CHAIRMAN. Why do you think he left in his initial statement 
what is called an "out" for the President, by saying he thought the

Secretary GATES. I believe he Was, sir. 
Senator WILEY. And, in other words, he knew that if he went to the 
.conference and couldn't get his way, which would be very apparent, 
that wouldn't sit so well with the people of Russia? 
Secretary GATES. I think that is a good speculation. 
Senator WILEy. So, it seems to be the consensus of those people who 
claim to know, including yourself, that the U-2 incident would give 
him something to hang on his previous determination and that he 
utilized. Do you agree to that? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, I think he used the 13-2 as a tool rather than 
as a matter of principle. I think he decided that there was no 
progress for him at the summit. 
SOVIET KNOWLEDGE OF OVERFLIGHTS 
Senator WILEy. Well, there is just this one other question. I think 
you have answered it, but see if I can't get it out into the open and get 
it so there won't be any question: Is it your opinion that he had known 
of the U-2 incidents for a long time?I mean the U-2 flights? 
Secretary GATES. I think I believed him when he said that he knew 
we were overflying the Soviet Union. I don't believe he knew their 
capabilities. But I think he knew that unidentified aircraft were over 
his territory. 
Senator Waxy. That is all, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Morse? 
RELATIONSHIP OF 11-2 FLIGHTS TO SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Senator MORSE. Mr. Secretary, I want to pursue a bit further the 
line of questioning that I was conducting when my time was up 
because I think you have got to deal also with the problem of where we 
go from here, in view of Russian attitudes at the present time. 
We have the air marshal's statement now which has not been coun-
termanded as far as we know by Khrushchev, that if an American U-2 
plane flies from any base, goes over Russia, they will fire a missile 
:against that base. 
Your testimony, I think, justifies my concluding that if they fire at 
that base, that under our commitments under NATO, our obligations 
to defend our allies, we will meet that force, and that that may very 
well start general war. 
As I understand also your testimony, you share my doubt as to 
whether or not the air marshal is bluffing, whether or not this is 
propaganda in the cold war or whether or not this is an announcement 
of a definite decision as to what they are (ming to do. 
So we have to discuss this hypothetically from this point on. Let's 
assume that he means exactly what he said, and because of my fear of 
the type of military mind they have in Russia as contrasted with our 
own, namely, the difference between amoral military leaders and moral 
military leaders, I am very fearful that the group in control of the 
Russian military at the present time means exactly what it says. 
They will fire a missile at any base from which an American U-2 
plane flies. Doesn't that put squarely up to us then the question as 
to whether or not we can justify being a party indirectly to the start-

that the President's statement was a statement made in eonnection

it does not follow that that statement of the President now continues

Seeartary (4-ArEs. I am not, a lawyer, Senator, butl think you could 
take the legal point of view that the, President had no commitment 
because of the blowup of the summit conference, but from it national 
point of view, prestige and the, standpoint, of the honorable point of 
view, I think the United States has made a commitment, regardless 
of the technicality of the timing of the decision, so in my judgment 
we have made a, comni it went not, to fly 1F-2 during the administration 
of this President.. 
Senator Ifousn. I don't care to get into any argument, over seman-

not the President's speech to the Nation the other night means that 
we may continue U-2 flights. 
In view of the statement of the air marshal of Russia as to what 
they are going to do if they do continue, my question is this: Should 
not our Government restate its position in regard to the continuation 
of U-2 flights and give the world assurance at the present time that 
we do not intend to continue U-2 flights and thus risk the possibility 
that the Russians may send a missile to the air base from which any 
U-2 flight might leave ? 
Secretary GATES. Senator, I have in my hand the President's state-
ment in Paris in which he said: 
In point of fact, these flights were suspended after the recent incident, and are 
not to be resumed. Accordingly, this cannot be the issue. 
That is a, categorical statement that they are not to be resumed, 
This is what I understand our position is. 
Senator MORSE. The President didn't say that in his speech to the 
.Nation the other night. There isn't anything in the President's 
,speech to the Nation the other night that categorically and unequivo-
cally assures to the world that we are discontinuing, as a matter of 
espionage policy, the flying of any U-2 planes over any foreign 
territory. 
All I seek to do at this point in the record, and please let me assure 
you of this, is to raise this point so that our Government can remove 
any suspicion or fear in other parts of the world in view of the 
Russian air marshal's statement, that the world doesn't have to be 
,concerned -about a nuclear war being started by us by sending a U-2 
plane from any foreign base over Russia. 
I think the world is entitled to that assurance at this moment in 
order to produce the relaxation that I think is necessary for the con-
tinuation, through the United Nations I hope, of a good faith, this 
attempt to reach some understanding with Russia. 
Secretary GATES. It may well need clarification, Senator. I didn't 
think it did. I thought it was perfectly clear to me that we had made 
:a commitment so long as the President is in office, not to fly the U-2 
airplane, and everyone understood it. If they don't, perhaps it should 
be reexamined. However, you are now faced with making another 
.statement in face of a threat, and I don't know whether this is a wise 
move or not. 
Senator MORSE. I think it is a wise move if we honestly believe 
that this is more than a threat, that this is an announcement of mili-
tary policy that they intend to deliver on. 
WORLD OPINION ON U-2 CrVERELIGIITS 
I don't intend to argue the point. I think the judgment of the 
world will be against us if, in view of what you call this threat, we 
'should continue U-2 flights, because I think we have to share joint 
responsibility with Russia then for starting a nuclear war, because 
I seriously question whether world opinion will ever be with us on 
-this kind of espionage conduct. 
I think that world opinion is against our sending a IT-2 flight over 
:any foreign territory, because I think most people in other parts of 
the world consider it a form of constructive aggression.

The t.,11/1TRINIAN. Senator Hic,kenlooper, do you have any further. 
questions? I think you are next. 
Senator IlicKricnoorall. Mr. Secretary, with reference to the dis-
cussion which you have just had with Senator Morse -----I think per-
haps I only have a continent because my comment will go to a mat-
ter of personal opinion.- -as I understand the line of questioning that 
has been going on here, and as I think it probably will be interpreted, 
the United States is required to take the burden for all the ills of the 
world and take the responsibilities for all the mistakes in the world; 
that we must do everything, including complete submission to the 
demands and the threats od the Kremlin; and that the opinion of the 
world is apt to be slanted against us unless we do this at this time. 
have heard from so many sources over the country that we have. 
to do this or that or t he other thing as a gesture that; We are not 
war-minded or that we are not warmongers, or that we really have; 
some interest in our fellow man. 
RECORD OF THS I TEL) STATES AS A PEA CEF1 J14 N TTI 
Now, if the record of the United States over the last good many 
years of humanitarian activities, of fantastic expenditures of billions. 
of dollars for peace, of fostering all kinds of conferences, of making 
all kinds of offers to meet all kinds of reasonable propositions for 
aeace, based only upon reasonable agreements for their assurance of 
Jet tig carried out--if that isn't an assurance to the world. LE personally 
think that to humble ourselves further by yielding to this threat of 
this military man in Russia would certainly not add to our prestige, 
in the least, and it prebably would be of little use in the eyes of the 
world, at least to thi.}se that we would expect to stand by us in an 
emergency. 
I can't. follow that line of reasoning, especially in view of the past 
record of the United States. 
We started out at the end of World War II with the sole and 
exclusive possession of the atomic bomb, the ability to blow any na-
tion off the map and a nyhody else if We wanted to if we were war--
minded. Nobody else had it. We offered to give it up to an inter-
national agency to get out of the atomic business, to turn over all 
fissionable materials to an international agency; all we asked was that 
reit sonal de inspect i o ; , reasonable assurance, w out be given that; 
the international agency would have control and that no nation would 
cheat on this obligation. 
Never in the history of the world, as far as I know, has a nation, 
possessing the exclusive ;ibility and the exclusive power to destroy 
any other nation in the. world, have they ever given that up or offered 
to give it; up voluntarily. 
We go from that step by step with vast amounts of money, with all 
kinds of humanitarian oilers, with all kinds of peaceful offers, with. 
all kinds of peaceful efforts in the world and I just want to make 
my position clear; we have stated we are not going to ov;erfly Russia, 
at least, so far as President Eisenhower's administration is concerned, 
wit h. 13-2's?that has beeil stopped. If we did continue it sometante. 
in the future in the. interests of the security of this country; I think

the security of this country comes first in our responsibility, and we 
must take whatever reasonable means we have and whatever calcu-
lated risks that may be involved in order to secure essential informa-
tion and in order to secure and maintain our proper defensive posture. 
I feel that very deeply and I am not questioning you about it. 
You don't have to agree or disagree. I merely wanted to make 
that statement in view of the fact that I don't agree that we have 
continually to humble ourselves in the eyes of the world, because I 
think it can do nothing but destroy the confidence, in many cases, that. 
other Nations have in us if we continue to bow to the threats that 
emanate periodically from the Kremlin, and we have had just as bad 
threats in the past as this one. As I pointed out in my previous ques-
tions, where they said they have rockets pointed at our bases, they 
have rockets on the pads pointed at other countries in Europe; 
they know how many rockets they are going to put on Paris and 
that they are going to bury us one way or another, and so on, and I 
think there comes a time when even the world has to turn and stand 
fast. That is all I have to say.

KHRUSHCHEV'S CHANGING VIEWS ON A SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Secretary, I don't want to labor this too long, 
but I am interested in your reasoning. I didn't get to finish that ques-
tion. Let me go back. Do you think when Chairman Khrushchev 
was in the United States last September that at that time he had an 
intention to have a summit conference? 
Secretary GATES. I would only be speculating, Mr. Chairman. I 
think he did. 
The CHAIRMAN. I want to know what happened between then and 
May 15, in your opinion, that caused him to take the firm decision 
which you stated a moment ago you believe he had. 
Secretary GATES. I really don't know the value of my opinion, Mr. 
Chairman, but my opinion is that he has tried for many years to 
divide our allies from us. He has tried to divide the NATO member-
ship in particular. He has resented the bases that surround his coun-
try, and he has had, I think, as a No. 1 objective the division of our 
security and collective alliances. I think he found during this inter-
vening period that he couldn't make a dent in the solidarity and 
unity of these relationships, that he couldn't get anybody to change 
their -position on Berlin. He found the British and the French and 
the United States stalwartly together on that subject, and that he 
found the NATO alliance in good shape and strong, and that he was 
going to run into a position where he would make no progress, and 
as someone else has remarked, I believe, during this testimony, he 
would probably lose some face at home if he couldn't make any 
progress.

Secretary GATES. This, pieced together and repeated and associated 
with other sources of intelligence builds up, un folds a story that defi-
nitely disclosed a military posture. 
It, builds up a story t hat gives you a judgment on a capability for 
a surprise attack. It gives you a judgment on important installations. 
It g,ves you some judgment on production. It gives you some judg-
mem on logistic backup and actual military sites, so that, I would say 
it gave you a very definite look-see at their military posture.

than they advertised.

when I started to testify in January, I repeatedly stated we didn't 
expect to have any sign i fieant or substantive concessions. We believed 
there was a tactic on the part of the Soviet Union. We didn't know 
so long long it, would last and we are not basing our military programs on 
tI 5premise and I also said that we should keep them under continuous 
review and as late as April we went back with it major revision in our

POSSIBLE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE ALERT 
The CHAIRMAN. One inference I wish you would comment on that 
might have been drawn from the ordering of the test on May 15 is, I 
believe: Would it be fair to draw the inference that you had any 
doubt about the readiness of our Armed Forces. 
Secretary GATES. No, sir, but it is a very good move and we should 
do it more frequently to have a no-notice alert communications and 
command readiness test, and we hope to do this, I say we started one 
again last night which has been long planned, it is going to be about a 
7- or 8-day exercise. 
The CHAIRMAN. It has been long planned. 
DECISION TO ORDER ALERT 
Was the one on the 15th long planned ? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. When did you first think of doing that? 
Secretary GATES. There was another one planned for about that 
period of time, as a matter of fact, I made the decision to do this 
myself. 
The CHAIRMAN. After you arrived in Paris? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. Do you think that that might have been construed 
as a provocative act under the circumstances that then existed in 
Paris? 
Secretary GATES. No, sir, it was made after midnight on Sunday 
night. It was not intended nor was it worded as a provocative mes-
sage. The first word in it was "Quiet," and the last words in it were 
"minimum need to know." 
It was not meant as provocative. It was not meant as either an 
offensive or defensive alert. 
In fact it was not issued as such. If we were going to go on that 
kind of an alert we would have had a higher degree of readiness than 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued. 
The CHAIRMAN. I didn't mean you intended it as such. Don't you 
think reasonable people might have regarded it as a provocative act? 
Secretary GATES. I think reasonable people would have regarded 
it as a prudent act. 
The CHAIRMAN. But not as a provocative act? 
Secretary GATES. That is right.

down. These volunteers may have been Soviet, but, as far as I know, 
any identified as a Soviet aircraft has not been shot down.

POSSIBILITY OF A GENERAL WAR 
Going back to my hypothetkal, assuming that we should fly a spy 
plane out of some foreign base and assuming that the Russian air mar-
shal makes good on his threat and strikes that airbase with Russian 
missiles and starts a general war, do you think we could win it 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator MORSE. You think we could destroy Russia and have enough 
of the United States left so that we could remain a power? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir; because in this case he would, by initiat-
ing this attack, give considerable warning to our retaliatory forces 
and with that warning, we would move in. 
Senator MORSE. Your view then is that the United States could win 
a nuclear war? 
Secretary GATES. If it is started under those circumstances.

Senator MORSE. Do you think that the Russian military are aware 
of the fact that we could win a nuclear war if they started that war

might fly? 
Secretary- GATES. I think theyare well aware of it. 
Senator MORSE. Do you think then that if he kept his threat of 
sending a missile to a foreign air base from which a spy plane might 
be flown, he probably would go much further than that and send mis-
siles elsewhere and if he knows it is going to lead to a general war, 
start a complete general war? 
Secretary GATES. I think he would have to. 
Senator MORSE. In your opinion, could we win that war? 
Secretary GATES. Well, we could do what we call in the military, 
prevail in general war, but there would be great damage to the United 
States. 
Senator MORSE. There would be terrific mutual destruction in a 
general war? 
Secretary GATES. Yes; terrific damage. 
Senator MORSE. Therefore--
Secretary GATES. But everything depends, Senator, on a lot of fac-
tors. If you vary any part of the equation you vary the answer. In 
other words, time of warning, reliability of missiles, ability to fire .ft 
salvo of missiles worldwide against deployed and -U.S. forces at home 
and abroad. These factors and the accuracies of these weapons?any 
one piece of this equation varies the answer. 
INTERPRETATION OF PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON SUSPENSION OF U-2 
FLIGHTS 
Senator MORSE. Therefore, referring most respectfully to Senator 
llickenlooper's observation, do you think that we would be showing a 
sign of weakness, that we would be guilty of appeasement, that we 
would be surrendering to threats if we removed any doubt in the 
world at the present moment by notifying the world that we have no 
intention of using military aircraft espionage tactics henceforth either 
by CIA, by NASA, by the Defense Establishment or by any other 
agency of the American Government?

158 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Secretary GATEs. Well, I wouldn't know quite how to answer your 
question, Senator, because maybe some of us that live o close to these 
things have a different, understanding than the public, has. It is so 
clear in my mind t hat the President has made a commitment not to 
thy these airplanes during his administration that I believe that the 
question becomes hypothetical, and I believe if it is clear to other 
people as it is to me that this is so, then it would be, I believe, stepping 
ii p to a threat. But if it, is not clear, and I an incorrect. in this, then. 
think we ought to take a look at it. 
Senator MoRsE. l am so anxious to see to it that we make it crystal 
clear because I am very much concerned about world reaction to our 
present posit ion. I hink we are living in the moment now where we 
can stop an adverse world reaction, and I think we are living in a 
moment where thieve is great, danger that a substantial segmeni of 
world opinion is going io go against us, unless we are willing to make 
cryst al clear that, we are not going to, through any agency If our 
'Government, resort to aircraft espionage, because we :ire dealing here 
when we are dealing with espionage, as you so very well, 1 think, 
described it yourself, with a form of activity that is a pretty ugly 
business. 
Socretftry GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator MoasE. .1.nd we all know that it, isn't based on principles 
41f I ci it It. In espionage, yciu do what is nec.essary to protect y(Air 
country, iticluding. deception and engaging in immoral acts. [De-
leted.] 
Now, I don't think -we, humble ourselves. Jo the contrary, I. think 
we, put, them on flak defensive in world opinion if we say to the world : 
Listen, we want the Ittissians to understand that they are going to have to 
;,1..;sunie full responsibility for any starting of a war. We have said and e re-
peat to the world that we have no intention of using aircraft in espionage work 
over foreign territory. 
Volt think it is perfectly clear. I have just come from across tIme 
country and I can give you assurance that it isn't in my j udg,anent 
clear in American public opinion today, and you have really got a 
seautent of public opinion in this country that wants that assurance 
from the, Presid.ent, because they take note of the fact that, in his 
speech the other night he wasn't even as definite as he was at Paris 
in regard to this matter. 
NEED FOR AS .41RA NCE OF CESSATION OF AIR4 R.F 1ESPItuNAGE 
Secretary GATES. Senator, under the American tradition: :I would 
say hat the President says he isn't going to overfly Russia during 
his administration, any circumvention of that statenient would not be 
in cliaracter with either the President or our country. To me, it is 
completely clear, but I respect your judgment. 
Senator MORSE. I may be completely wrong. My only point is that 
we can afford, it seems to me, as a Nation that does seek peace, to re-
assure the world as many times as that When assurance might help the 
muse, of peace, and in doing so I don't think we humble ourselves. 
To the contrary, [ think we put Russia on the defensive. Ti will help 
us in my judgment to win the so-called battle of propaganda for 
peace and strengthen its in getting these issues into the United Nations.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 159 
Of course I would say this. I think the President is to be commended 
for making clear in Paris that he is suspending 17-2 flights?that is 
What he said; U-2 flights. 
I think he is to be commended for that, and I hope that those who 
seek to replace him will give the world assurance immediately that 
when any one of them is elected President that will be their policy, 
too, because if all this is a. moratorium for a few months, it is not 
going to strengthen America's position in world opinion. They want 
to know whether or not this is (ming to be the policy of the United 
States, because, in my judgment, if you continue espionage work by 
way of aircraft, you are going to lose the world opinion in southeast 
Asia, Latin America, and Africa, the opinion of which America has 
got to win in the decades ahead to survive, because if that part of 
the world goes against us, it is only a matter of a few decades before 
we will cease, in my judgment, being a Nation. 
You have got to win to the cause of .freedom those hundreds of 
millions of people, and you are not going to do it in my judgment if 
you let Khrushchev get by with a propaganda drive now that we are 
the ones that are committing a form of aggression by carrying out an 
espionage program. We don't like to face up to it but in my judgment 
that is croin.gto be the verdict of those people. 
The CAIRMAN. The Senator's time is up. 
Senator Gore? 
SECRETARY GATES' PARTICIPATION IN ISSUANCE OF STATEMENTS 
Senator GORE. Mr. Secretary, I understood you to say that the 
decision on the 9th that the President should assume full responsibility 
was a unanimous decision. Did I correctly understand you? 
Secretary GATES. The statement that was issued was a unanimous 
paper. I think I am answering you yes. 
Senator GORE. I wanted to give you an opportunity to affirm that, 
and you so do now. 
You. did not participate, I believe you told me, or you told the com-
mittee, in any conference between the 5th and the 9th. 
Secretary GATES. That is correct. 
Senator GORE. So you did not participate in a conference or in a 
communication between the Department of State, the President at 
Gettysburg, or otherwise, with anyone regarding the issuance of the 
statement which was issued on the 7th by Mr. Herter? 
Secretary GATES. No, I did not. 
Senator GORE. Which partially acknowledged the mission of the 
plane. 
Secretary GATES. That is correct. I had no participation in that 
in any way. 
Senator GORE. I believe that concludes my questions, Mr. Chairman.

by him a conciliatory att dude for a period of about a month or two? 
Are you able to answer that? 
Secretary GATES. My impression is about the same its \lours. Sen-
ator, that there was sort, 4d a tone of cot 'ciliation in the air. 
Senator LAITSCHE. We have had before this committee. the Ant-
arctic Treaty that has been recommended. 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senatorl,miscrw. lint was signed hv the Soviet and I w the I.Tnited 
States. 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator LA USCI I E. And that, I think, was last December 1. And 
there was progress nui(le. or a period on the matter of ha 'ming nuclear 
tests. 
Secretary GATES. Y es: there was progress made. 
Senator LAuscnn. In fact, there was more progress made, during 
that period than there 'find been at any other time, on that, subject. 
Secretary GATEs. I think that, would be fair to say, that it looked 
more hopeful. 
Senator LAESCHE. On November 14 in a speech Rh rush c hev brutally 
attacked Adenauer and the German Republic. 
Secretary GATES. r Fen iember the speech. 
Senator LAusonE. You remember that speech? 
Secretary GATES. Yes, sir. 
Senator LAuscriE. And there was some, speculation iii the minds of 
the people in our Government as to what, his purpose was in making 
that attack when ostensibly there was to be a conference to reach some 
agreement on West Germany and Berlin. 
Now than, on December 1, he began repeating his threats that he 
would sign a, separate peace treaty wit h East ( ermany. Is it not, a 
fact that his attack inapt Adenauer and upon the German Republic 
and his purpose to sign a separate peace treaty, was confirmation of 
the immovable posit ion lie took before he niet at Camp David about 
lArest Berlin and East Germany? 
Secretary GATE,s. Yes; I think it was. 1 think his position was well 
advertised, and. we felt in the I)epartment of Defense that we were 
living under a threat of a separate peace treaty at drat lime. 
Senator LAITscit E. Then he has the Baku speech of April 25 in which 
he gave a, harsher version of what he had been saying for months 
about East Berlin, West Berlin, and the German -Republic. That is 
in April, pretty close to May 16, and then we have those. circumstances 
it which you point oni that, he, had a translated paper originally 
written in Russian into Elwell translation so that he gave it to-- --
Secretary GATEs. Ih? 
Senator .LAUSCITE. De Gaulle. How did he present his paper to 
Macmillan? 
Secretary GivrEs. Aly understanding, Senator, was that he didn't 
leave a paper with -Macmillan. He talked from the same paper and 
it, was translated through all interpreter to Macmillan verbally. This 
is my understanding. 
Senator LAuscun Isn't it also a. fact that during all of this time and 
especially in the several months preceding the conference, the sup-
posed Con ferenc.e. the four powers stated that there wonld be no yield-
on West. Berlin. md our rights in West, Berlin?

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CON I, him 
KHRUSIICHEV'S SUMMIT CONFERENCE AIMS 
Senator LAUSCHE. In your opinion, what was the primary thing that 
he was aiming for in the conference? I am speaking of Khrushchev. 
Secretary GATES. You mean when he- agreed to go to a, summit 
conference? 
Senator LAUSCHE. And down to the end. 
Secretary GATES. I testified that I think he thought he would have 
his way and make some peace treaty in Berlin with some kind of give 
on the part of our allies and our allies refused to give. 
REASONS FOR REVOKING INVITATION TO PRESIDENT EISENHOWER 
Senator LAUSCHE. All right. Now then, have you given any 
thought to why he revoked the invitation to the President to come to 
the Soviet laud? 
Secretary GATES. Well, again we speculate but in my opinion the 
last thing he wanted was for the President to travel around his coun-
try and be acclaimed and received by the population of Russia. 
Senator LAusonE. Do you think that he had flashes in his mind 
about the acclaim that Nixon got in Poland, and in other places? 
Secretary GATES. He probably did. 
Senator LAUSCHE. And do you think that he kind of thought that 
there would be demonstrations for the President of the United States 
by the Russian people unparalleled anywhere? 
Secretary GATES. I believe there would have been. 
Senator LAusonE. That is my honest conviction, that he did not dare 
have the President meet the Ukrainian people and the normal Russian 
people, excluding the Communists, in that trip to the Soviet and that 
is why the invitation was revoked. 
Senator WILEY. Will the Senator yield? 
Senator LAUSCHE. I yield. 
POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS ON KIIRUSIICHEV'S 
THINKING 
Senator WILEy. I think there are some other facts there that fit 
into the picture that you have very dramatically given us. 
Do you remember after he came to America he went back and he 
canvassed individually the various heads of the various states, and 
then he made a trip out east and he met Mao Tse-tung? 
It was after that that he made that Baku speech. He made several 
other speeches, and if you remember, the papers were pretty well filled 
with the thoughts that the Chinese Communists were telling him, and 
that at the time that he did go to Paris, that conditions were such that 
the evidence indicated the Chinese were in Russia. Now all this 
bolsters the conclusion that the Secretary has made, that it wasn't the 
I1-2 incident. That was just something that he got hold of as an 
ostensible reason. 
The other was that he couldn't get his way and that, I understand, is 
your position. 
Senator LAUSCHE. I have nothing more to ask you. Thank you 
very much, Mr. Gates.

[TEE( 'IF Or DENIAL t )vr( atTIT NI TY FOR PRESIDENT TO VI S IT SOVIET ONION 
Senator Goux. If the Senator would yield, I would like to observe 
that. I was in the Far East at the time President Eisenhower made his 
visit to India and other countries, and there was i tremendous favor-
able reception. It served, the cause of our country magnificently well. 
I lii ink it is a great loss 10 us that the President has been denied 
the opportunity to visit hi the Soviet Union. It would have, in my 
view, lieen a great, eentribution. He is unquestionably a great, exem.-
plary influence for America, and I agree with you, Senator liausche 
and Senator Wiley. that, the denial of the opportunity of this visit is 
great loss to us. 
I do not know whether Mr. Khrushchev wanted it or did not want

cHALmEns ROBERTS' CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS 
Senator GORE. Now I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the 
record a chronology of events which I found exceedingly well done by 
Mr. Chalmers Roberts. 
The CHAIRMAN. Without objection it is SO ordered. 
(The chronology referred to follows:) 
[From the Washington Post, May 27, 1960] 
CHRONOLOGY OF U-2 INCIDENT TRACED IN TANGLED WEB or SUMMIT DISPUTE 
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE? 
(By Chalmers M. Roberts) 
Who was responsible for the incredible assortment of conflicting statements 
and contradictory assertions when the Eisenhower administration was con-
fronted with the 17-2 spy plane crisis? 
This is the most immediate question in the tangled web of the U-2 affair 
and the subsequent collapse of the Summit Conference in Paris. What follows 
is a detailed examination of the facts about the Administration's handling of 
the 15-2 case. 
It should be noted beforehand, however, that there are other important parts 
?41?10' to the whole story: The apparent public hardening of American policy toward 
the Soviet Union prior to the 13-2 affair ; Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev's 
reaction to that hardening; Khrushchey's reactions to the American accounts of 
the U-2 case; and the internal Soviet pressures on Khrushchev, before and 
after the spy plane was downed, because of his year-old policy of trying to do 
business with President Eisenhower. 
Whether or not Khrushchev would have scuttled the Summit, had there been 
no U-2 incident, is not now clear; there are divided opinions in the Adminis, 
tration on that. A good many diplomats do tend to agree with what President 
Eisenhower said to the congressional leaders yesterday?that Khrushchev 
may have scuttled the conference because he was under "pressure by the 
Stalinists," those in Moscow suspicious of any dealing with the West, "and the 
Chinese" Communists who have openly disagreed with Khruslichey's 
But that question is only indirectly related to the handling of the U-2 affair 
by the Eisenhower Administration. 
The chief figures in the U-2 drama in Washington were President Eisenhower, 
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter, Under Secretary C. Douglas Dillon, Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency Chief Allen W. Dulles and White House Press. Secretary 
James C. Hagerty. 
It is evident from the record that much of the confusion sprang from the 
fact that no one acted in supreme authority in directing the Administration's 
actions. 
Here is the chronological record as far as it is known today: 
May 1.?The 15-2 flight of pilot Francis G. Powers took place on this date 
because of a clear weather forecast. That forecast also indicated that such 
good weather probably would not be repeated for some weeks; that is, until 
after the Summit Conference, then 2 weeks off. CIA officials say the equip-
ment carried by Powers, including the tiny poison needle, is standard equipment 
carried by all Strategic Air Command crews. It is designed to help a crewman 
escape if downed in enemy territory. Powers never was ordered to use the 
needle to avoid capture; it was for use to avoid torture, if captured, according 
to CIA officials. The pistol was not for murdering Russians but for shooting 
small game, it is contended.

164 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Second flight 
The day of Powers' flight, there was a Second U-2 flight from Turkey. This 
was a meteorological flight outside the Soviet Union, the kind of flight the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration unwittingly thought all U-2's were 
making. NASA was, of course, the "cover' for the clandestine flights over the 
Soviet Union. 
These penetrations of Soviet air space had been going on for four years with 
results highly gratifying to Ameriean intelligence officials. There had been a 
great many of these flights and the Powers mission was not the :first designed to 
cross the Soviet Union. Others had succeeded when he failed. 
So detailed were the protographs brought back by the IT-2s that at one time 
the State Department's Policy Planning Staff considered a proposal to show them 
to Khrushchev. The idea was to use them in an effort to break down his resist-
ance to inspection and control for various disarmament schemes. 
The proposal was re;iected, however, partially on the grounds that Khrushchev 
already knew of the flights and that such a move might lead him to make such a 
public row that they would have to be discontinued. 
Cutoff planned 
CIA officials contend that there was to be a cutoff of 11-2 flights before the 
Summit, that the question was how much time constituted a margin of safety. 
Nevertheless, the Powers mission was permitted to take place two weeks before 
the Summit. In his speech on Wednesday the President implied he fully ap-
proved of that. 
Mr. Eisenhower said that, as to complaints over the timing of the flights so 
close to the Summit, "there is no time when vigilance can be relaxed." By im-
plication, he meant there was no reason to cancel the flight because of the im-
pending conference with the Russians. 
However, this has not always been the President's policy. In September, 195(, 
in the midst of the Sues crisis negotiations with the Russians as well as the 
Egyptians?the President did order a halt to the U-2 flights. Then he apparently 
wanted to avoid an iniddent which would make negotiation more difficult. 
There is no evidence, however, that the President was aware beforehand of 
this particular flight or that either the State Department or the CIA thought his 
specific approval necessary. He had delegated authority for the flights, once hav-
ing approved the entire U-2 scheme following Soviet rejection of his "open skies" 
plan at the 1955 Geneva Summit conference. 
May 1-4.?During this period the CIA and the State Department knew that 
Powers was missing; ihey hoped he had crashed and that pilot and plane had 
left no tell-tale evidence. The initial confusion over the missing plane, as to 
whether it was Power: or tin' legitimate met eorologica I flight in Turkey the same 
day, was soon clearer mi. There is no evidence that the Administration laid 
oat any plan of how to it:11)01e the possible disclosures later fatale by Khrushchev. 
.:11-ny horn been misled. 
The Administration may have been misled into thinking Khrushchev would 
remain silent because id' Sm jet action over the expected visit ti the United States 
of tin' hogs of the Soviet Air Force, Air Marshal K. A. Vershinin. 
On May 2 the Soviets: asked for a 45-hour postponement of he announcement 
the visit. BM on May 4 hey agreed to a joint United States-Soviet announce-
ment and it was made that day. The visit was canceled on May 13 after Kbru-
shchev's Us2 disclosure. 
On May 3 it, was aanommed from Istanbul, Turke: that a single-engine Air 
Force plane was missing near Lake Van, not far from the Sm let border. It was 
described as a high all limb, research plane belonging to NASA. 
The report said the Mane was one of two which had taken gift from the United 
States base at incrilik near Adana. Turkey, on a weatlier reconnaissance mission. 
The other plane returned safely but the pilot of the missing craft was said to 
have reported his oxygen equipment was out of order. 
Stantla ra .story 
This was the standard sett of "cover" story for the missing U-2. issued in the 
Ropes that it would suffice. It was not known here whether Powers' U-2 went 
down or why. To this date, in fact, there is only Khrushehev's word that it was 
downed near Sverdlovsk, deep inside the Soviet Union. 
May 5.- -Khrushchev timmuneed to the Supreme Soviet in Moscow the bare de-
tails -of the U-2 flight, deliberately (he said later) withholding information

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 165 
which would have let Washington know that Powers was alive and that much 
of his equipment had been captured intact. He set a trap into which the Eisen-
hower Administration fell. 
In his Wednesday speech, Mr. Eisenhower contended that the "covering state-
ment," as he called it, was imperative "to protect the pilot, his mission, and our 
intelligence processes at a time when the true facts were still undetermined." 
On May 5 Secretary Herter was in Athens, en route home from a NATO for-
eign ministers conference in Turkey. In charge of the State Department was 
Under Secretary Dillon. 
Dillon's responsibility 
Under the President's delegation of authority, it was Dillon's responsibility 
for what next occurred until Herter's return late on May 6. It was on May 5 
and 6 that the administration allowed itself to be entangled in a series of lies 
about the U-2. 
When newsmen went to Press Secretary Hagerty for comment on Khrushchev's 
speech, Hagerty was careful to say only that the President did not know of the 
news story about the speech. 
News of the speech arrived here just after the President had left by helicopter 
for a National Security Council meeting at a secret hideout, part of a civil de-
fense exercise. There is no evidence on whether the President at that meeting 
discussed what to do about the Khrushchev disclosure. The subsequent record 
Indicates that he left it to Dillon and the State Department. 
State Department spokesman Lincoln White, who received his instructions 
personally from Dillon, said that "it may be" that the plane Khrushchev referred 
to was the missing so-called NASA aircraft. It was also announced that the 
President had ordered an immediate inquiry into Khrushchev's accusation. 
Trouble convpounded 
This semi-lie was aggravated by NASA's press chief, Walter T. Bonney. Un-
aware that NASA was being used as a "cover" for the spy flights, Bonney said 
at a press conference that the plane was on a wholly peaceful mission. He gave 
details of the plane's Adana take-off, its route within Turkey and the pilot's 
alleged report of his oxygen trouble. The Administration's story thus was that 
a peaceful flight outside Soviet borders might have by accident transgressed the 
Soviet-Turkish border. 
There is no evidence that the President or Dillon, or anyone else in authority 
in the Administration, took charge of the whole affair and told NASA to say 
nothing. There have been subsequent hints from the White House, however, 
that some such order went out to NASA but was overlooked or disregarded. The 
record here is not clear. 
May 6.?In Moscow it was claimed the U-2 was shot down by a rocket on 
Khrushchev's personal order, but other details still were withheld. However, 
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko termed the American explanation 
"nonsense." 
"Full facts" asked 
The State Department said it was asking the "full facts" in Moscow. White, 
still acting under Dillon's orders, declared that "there was absolutely no?n-o?
deliberate attempt to violate the Soviet airspace." The lie thus was compounded. 
Around dinner time Herter arrived home from Greece to take charge of the 
State Department. 
The strongest evidence that the handling of the U-2 affair was left by the 
President to the State Department?first to Dillon, then to Herter?comes from 
Vice President Richard M. Nixon. On a May 15 television show Nixon gave this 
explanation, putting part of the blame for the fumbling on the insistent demand 
of newsmen for the facts: 
"Now, let's look at the problem with which our people in the State Department 
were confronted when this information developed. They did not know at the 
outset what the Soviet Union knew. They did not know that the pilot had been 
recovered and that they had obtained information from him or otherwise which 
made it imperative we acknowledge that these flights had taken place. 
Alternative question 
"Now, some would say then, 'well, why then didn't we keep our mouths shut 
and say nothing and wait until we found out what they knew?' 
"And here again we have the problem of the open society. We have newsmen 
in Washington. The newsmen descended upon the State Department and other

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CON FERENCE 167 
Administration wanted to pin the blame on him to avoid blaming the President, 
he would .agree. But this idea was not accepted as being practical in view of 
Khrushchey's disclosures. 
Herter read the draft statement on the phone to the President in Gettysburg. 
He approved it without changing a word. 
In part, at least, Herter's decision to tell the lie that no one in Washington 
authorized the flight also was based in the slim hope that somehow Khrushchev 
would accept it. The Secretary and his aides had noted Khrushchev's acceptance 
of what he had taken as Hagerty's disclaimer of any Eisenhower responsibility. 
May 8?While the world assessed the seemingly incredible American admission 
that the U-2 had indeed been on an espionage flight, President Eisenhower re-
turned to Washington and met with Herter at the White House. 
Notes to Britain, France 
The same day Khrushchev sent notes to Britain and France about the forth-
coming summit conference. In them he complained about the 11-2 but gave no 
indication it would be used to wreck the conference as was to be the ease. 
By- now Hagerty was alarmed at the implications of the admission statement, 
implications that the President did not know what was going on. He was 
insistent to Herter that this should somehow be eliminated. It is not clear 
whether the President said the same thing to Herter directly but if he did there 
would seem to have been no reason for IIagerty to do so. 
May 9?After another State Department conference, Herter put out a state-
ment in his name saying that "penetration" by the U-2s of the Soviet Union had 
been going on for four years, that this had been done by presidential orders 
"since the beginning of his Administration" in order to gather intelligence. But 
Herter added that "specific missions of these unarmed civilian aircraft have not 
been subject to presidential authorization." This, at last, appeared to be the 
truth. 
Unaware of implication 
This was the statement which left the implication that such 11-2 flights would 
be continued over the Soviet Union. But there is reason to believe that none of 
those involved at State Department was conscious of any such implication when 
they drafted the statement. They took the view, shared by the CIA, that the 
11-2 setup now was "a blown agent" to be discarded, that other intelligence 
gathering methods would continue, however. 
Nonetheless the implication was there and neither State nor the White House 
did anything to correct it until the President himself told Khrushchev in Paris 
a full week later that "these flights were suspended after the recent incident 
and are not to be resumed." 
The President said Wednesday he wanted no public announcement until he 
met Khrushchev in Paris. American officials also claimed the flight suspension 
was ordered the previous Thursday, May 12, which is at cross-purposes with the 
claim that no implication of further flights was contained in Herter's May 9 
statement. 
Nixon unaware 
Indeed, Nixon in his May 15 television appearance seemed unaware that the 
flights had been cancelled. Ile then said: 
"The first responsibility of the President of the United States * * * is to 
protect the security of this country and of free peoples everywhere from the 
devastation that would result from a surprise attack. Now, that is why these 
flights were made in the first place. That is why an indication has been made 
that such activities may have to continue in the future * * *" 
Herter and Dulles appeared on May 9 before a specially arranged closed-door 
Congressional leadership meeting. To at least some of those present Herter 
left the clear implication that the flights would continue. 
May 10.?The Soviet news agency, Tass, described Herter's statement as "a 
frank attempt to legalize and justify violation of the state frontiers of other 
nations for espionage purposes." A Soviet note to the United States avoided 
blaming President Eisenhower personally but, in referring to the May 7 state-
ment by State, said it did "not correspond to reality." It charged that the 11-2 
flights "are carried on with the sanction of the Government of the United States 
of America."

168 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
'Welcome doubted 
May 11.?At an exhibition in Moscow of the U-2 wreckage and equipment, 
Khrushchev said Herter's May 9 statement made him doubt "Our earlier conclu-
sion" that the President himself did not know of the flights. Be said he doubted 
the President would be welcome in Russia during his scheduled June visit there. 
When asked whether the U-2 incident would conic up at the Sunindt Confer-
ence, Khrushchev replied; "it is already the subject of worldwide discussion. 
Therefore 1 believe there is no need to put it on the discussion schedule at the 
Summit Conference." 
The same day at his press conference here President Eisenhower took full 
responsibility for the 1:-2 tights, said nothing to counter the implication that 
they. would continue, remarked that "no one wants another Pearl Harbor." 
May 12-44.?During this period Khrushchev went to Paris a day early, arriv-
ing on Saturday, May 14, Herter arrived on May 13 but there was no United 
Slates-Soviet contact. On the 13th the Soviet Union sent protest notes to Nor-
way, Pakistan and Turkey warning against further use of their territory for 
such missions as those of the U-2 which Khrushchev had claimed look off from 
Pakistan with the expectation of landing in Norway. 
On the 12th the United States sent a note to Moscow which said the United 
States had "fully stated its position" about the U-2 incident in the May 9 Herter 
statement. 
By now President Eisenhower's responsibility for the U-2 flights, if not for the 
specific Powers mi&sion, had been firmly established on the public! record. 
.Way 15.- --The President arrived in Paris just before Khrrisheliev's call on 
Prench President de Gaulle. The President considered Iwo possible moves in 
this final day before the Summit Conference was to open : To ask for a bilateral 
Meeting with Khrushchev and to announce publicly that no more flights would 
Is! made. 
But the President deeided against either step. He did so chiefly on the basis 
of de Gaulle's report of the hard stand taken by Khrushchev in their talk that 
morning. His aides told him they deduced from Khrusliebev's words with de 
Gaulle that the Soviet leader had come to Paris bound by a prior Moscow deci-
sion by the ruling Presidimit, that he therefore could not be swayed by either 
suggested Eisenhower move. 
Allen statement 
On this same day in Washington George V. Allen, chief of the U. S. Informa-
tion Agency, said on a television show that Herter "has not said that we are 
going to continue to fly" U-2 missions, that "he hasn't said one way or another." 
This statement surprised State Department officials who now say Allen was talk-
ing entirely on his own, that he had consulted nobody in advance. 
May 16.---At the only Paris confrontation between President Eisenhower and 
Khrushchev, the Soviet, leader said the United States had "torpedoed" the con-
ference. He demanded that the I'resident apologize for the flights, call off 
ft rther flights and punish those responsible for Powers' mission, These were 
the same demands of which he had informed de Gaulle the day before. He 
charged the President with making "treachery" the basis of his policy toward 
the Soviet 17nion. 
To this the President responded by terming Khrushchev's demands an "ulti-
matum" which "would never be acceptable to the United States." He also told 
Khrushchev that U-2 flights had been suspended and would not be resumed. 
The two men parted in anger. The Summit had collapsed before it had begun.

[From the Congressional Record, May 25, 1960, pp. 10234-102371 
THE COMMUNIST INFILTRATION IN THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN MOVEMENT 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in his statement of January 22, J. Edgar Hoover 
warned that Nikita Khrushchev's visit to this country had resulted in the 
reinvigoration of the American Communist movement and that the FBI was 
receiving increasing evidence of stepped-up Communist activities at many points. 
Among other things, Mr. Hoover warned that non-Communist organizations 
dedicated to causes that command popular support could expect Communist 
efforts to infiltrate their ranks. 
Evidence that has come into the hands of the Subcommittee on Internal 
Security indicates that the Communist Party has made the nuclear test ban 
movement the chief target of its infiltration operations. I think it important 
that this evidence be placed before Congress and before the public so that we 
may have a better understanding of the methods by which the Communists 
operate and of the goals they seek to achieve. I should like to detail to you 
some of the evidence of this infiltration, and to suggest the outline of a self-
defense program for all organizations whose purposes make them particularly 
vulnerable to Communist infiltration. 
I do not accept the thesis that if one happens to hold a position that enjoys 
the support of the Communist Party on any issue, one is, ipso facto, either a 
pro-Communist or a fellow traveler. The Communists are opposed to the poll 
tax: does that make all people who oppose the poll tax Communists? The 
Communists support the Forand bill. Does that make the many millions of 
Americans who have endorsed the bill Communist sympathizers? Obviously not. 
But on a foreign policy issue of overriding importance like the test ban, if a 
legitimate organization adheres to a policy which coincides with Communist 
policy, then it must be prepared to expect a concerted effort at infiltration by the 
Communist termites. The more urgent the issue, the more respectable the 
organization, the more illustrious the names on its letterhead, the greater the 
temptation from the Communist standpoint. 
The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy is headed by a group of nationally 
prominent citizens about whose integrity and good faith there is no question. 
Among them are people like Norman Cousins, of the Saturday Review, Mr. 
Clarence Pickett of the American Friends Service Committee, Mr. Norman 
Thomas, and so forth. They advocate a point of view which some of us consider 
unrealistic or utopian, but it is, nevertheless, a significant point of view on an 
issue of life and death importance. For the personal motivations of most of 
those associated with the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy I have the most 
sincere respect. The point of view they represent deserves a hearing?indeed, 
it must be heard. 
Last Thursday evening, May 19, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy held 
a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Many eminent persons 
attended this rally. The speakers included Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, Mr. Alfred 
Landon, Mr. Walter Reuther, Gov. G. Mennen Williams, of Michigan, and Dr. 
Harold Taylor, former President of Sarah Lawrence College. At this meeting, 
the speakers urged that another summit meeting be convened for the purpose 
of attempting to arrive at an agreement banning nuclear tests. 
Because I esteem the sincerity of the original founders of the Committee for 
a Sane Nuclear Policy and the sincerity of the speakers I have named, it was 
for me an unpleasant duty to have to notify them that the unpublicized chief 
organizer of the Madison Square Garden rally, Henry Alroms, was a veteran 
member of the Communist Party; that there was also evidence of serious 
Communist infiltration at chapter level throughout the Committee for a Sane 
Nuclear Policy; that the Communist Party and its front organizations had done 
their utmost to promote the meeting; that the Communists provided much of 
the organizing machinery for the meeting because they planned to use it as 
a pressure instrument in support of Soviet nuclear diplomacy. 
This information was confirmed by the Subcommittee on Internal Security 
only several days before the Madison Square Garden meeting was scheduled to 
take place. Because I wished to be fair to all the decent and prominent people 
who were associated with the meeting as sponsors or as speakers, I had some 
doubt about the advisability of rushing into print with my information only

170 EVENTS IN CI DE NT 'PO THE SUMMIT CONFE It ENC E 
4S hours in advance of the rally. Instead, I decided to comunicate the informa-
tion, or at least certain essential portions of it, to Mr. Norman Cousins, the 
chairman of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. Mr. 0011S:1'1S came to 
Washington to see me and we had a long and frank discussion about the problem. 
The directors of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, it turned out, had 
some inkling of the existence of a Communist infiltration and were extremely 
unhappy about it. When the Communist affiliations of the chief organizer of 
the Madison Square Garden meeting were brought to Mr. Cousins' attention, 
he immediately suspended the organizer in question. This was 2 days -before 
Ii meeting. It is my understanding that the national committee of the organ-
tion intends to take some further measures against Communist infiltrators. 
If I have any criticism to make, it is that the directors of the organization 
have moved so slowly to confront the problem arid that the measures they 
have taken have been inadequate. I was, for example, surprised to discover 
that 0110 of the officers of. the committee, Mr. Norman Thomas, had, as early as 
lost January, expressed seritais suspicion about the individual who later became 
organizer of the Madison Square Garden meeting?but that no action had been 
taken on Mr. Thomas' warning. 
To me it is appalling that the Communists should be able to infiltrate and 
manipulate a movement founded on sincere humanitarian and pacifist motiva-
tions, and headed by so many reputable citizens. Perhaps this is a situation in 
which. remedial legisliC ion is indicated, a situation in which private citizens 
mist have the assistance of Government to cope effectively with a movement that 
operates by stealth and 'iry secrecy. 
;n accorilance with the subcominittee'S mandate from the Senate, it was 
clear that our duty required that we do everything in our power to get at the 
facts. In presenting the information we have gleaned to the Senate, it is my 
hoie that I will be able to do so in a manner that will avoid injury to the 
ITO locellt and will point the way to a constructive course of action by Govern-
ni.ent and private organizations. 
The test ban has for several years now been the chief objective of the Com-
monist propaganda apparatus. Of this there is ample documentary evidence. 
in his speech before the congress of the Soviet Communist Party on January 
27. Nikita Khrushebev, in his most militant rhetoric, called for it permanent 
bait on nuclear tests. 
The main political resolution adopted by the 17th congress of the Communist 
Ps rty of the U.S.A., in February 19W) said : 
"The demand that the administration end nuclear testing and ban the H-bomb 
hos fmind a widening response in cont ill unity meetings, peace talks, petitions, 
and. sermons from the pulpit," 
111 14'eli1tia1?y iii, Mitt en Communists foreign language newspapers took 
inil-page advertisement in the New York Times and called on the President--
To proclaim the achievement of total, universal, and controlled disarma-
ment as the goal of National I T.S. 
-2. To restore lthe moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons and to do 
evirything in your power ti insure early agreement on the banning of all nuclear 
tes s. 
-3. To oppose the sharing of nuclear warheads with NATO allies." 
'The rontrnittee for a Sane Nuclear Policy has not solicited the praise of the 
0,oununist movement, and most of its leaders, I am certain, would be much 
happier if they received no plaudits from Communist sources. The fact, never-
theless, remains that the committee in recent years has been the recipient of 
consistent and generous praise from the Communist press. The Communist 
ors:ari, New World Review, for April of this year, for example, carried these 
paragraphs under the caption "Peace Groups in the United States": 
"No amount of conspiratorial silence can wipe out the forces for disarma-
ment and peace; hut it can leave them isolated from each other and ignorant 
of he efforts their fellows are making.

country working toward these ends, beginning in this issue * * * with a descrip-

Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, and Clarence Pickett, executive secre-
tary emeritus of the American Friends Service Committee, and with the sponsor-
ship and support of many noted Americans, SANE provides an elastic organiza-
tion and comprehensive program through which ordinary people can be effective. 
"Local committees of SANE exist in many cities, towns, counties and small 
communities throughout the United States. Their membership policy is flexible 
and they generally welcome additions to their forces, whether for one particular 
campaign or on a long-term basis." 
Mr. President, to anyone who is familiar with the language of communism, 
the paragraphs I have just quoted constitute a clear directive to members of the 
Communist Party to enter into the ranks of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear 
Policy. These paragraphs, I might point out, were not the haphazard product of 
a novice or intellectual dilettante. They were written by the editor of the. 
magazine, Jessica Smith, a hardened oldtime Communist. 
As for the Madison Square Garden meeting, the Communist organ, the 
Worker, in a series of its own advertisements, called upon all the Communists 
faithful to turn out in strength. The masthead of the Worker for May 15 
carried a banner headline "For Sanity in Foreign Policy?All Out to Madison 
Square Garden, Thursday, 7 :45 pan." 
Given this background, it was only natural to anticipate that the Communists 
would attempt to find their way into the organizing mechanism of the meeting. 
The name of the Communist Party member who served as chief organizer 
of the Madison Square Garden meeting is Henry II. Abrams. As I have pointed 
out, Mr. Norman Cousins suspended Mr. Abrams several days before the meeting, 
when I brought the matter to his attention. Until the date of his suspension, 
however, Mr. Abrams devoted virtually full time to the organization of the 
meeting for many weeks. He did so, moreover, without remuneration. 
On March 16, 1960, Mr. Abrams attended a meeting of the executive committee 
of the Greater New York committee of the National Committee for a Sane 
Nuclear Policy. Let me read just two sentences from the minutes of that meet-
ing, which clearly illustrates the central role this Communist agent has played: 
"Dr. Lear reported that Gov. G. Mennen Williams has accepted our invitation 
to speak at Madison Square Garden. Henry Abrams then gave the rest of the 
Madison Square Garden report." 
Henry Abrams' residence at 11 Riverside Drive, New York City, and his tele-
phone number of Trafalgar 4-7769, is the address and telephone number used 
by the headquarters of the Upper Manhattan Sane Nuclear Policy Committee. 
Abrams has served as an accountant for both the Upper Manhattan Committee 
and the Greater New York Committee of the National Committee for a Sane 
Nuclear Policy. From these facts it emerges that his association with the 
Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy was a long and fairly prominent one. 
Now let us look at Henry Abrams' Communist record. 
In 1939, he resided at 972 East 14th Street, Brooklyn, N.Y. In that year he 
signed a Communist Party nominating petition from that address which ap-
peared on page 4091 of the election records. 
He was a member of the 11th Assembly District Club of the Communist Party 
which met at 2744 Broadway, New York City. On Tuesday, February 15, 1944, 
it was announced at a meeting of this Communist club that Henry Abrams 
would give a class for Communists on the preparation of income tax forms. 
Henry Abrams was a member of the Young Communist League and later of 
the upper West Side section of the Communist Party of New York City. He has 
been a consistent financial contributor to the Communist Party, U.S.A. 
As recently as September 28, 1958, the official Communist Party newspaper, the 
Worker, printed a letter from Henry Abrams endorsing the candidacy of Ben-
jamin Davis for State senator in the 21st senatorial district of New York City. 
Benjamin Davis is national secretary of the Communist Party, and is, in fact, one 
of the most notorious of native Communists, a fact which is well known to most 
Americans. He was one of the leading members of the party convicted in the 
famous Foley Square Smith Act trials of a dozen years ago. He spent several 
years in jail for advocating the overthrow of the U.S. Government by force 
and violence. 
Mr. Abrams has served as an accountant for the American Communist Party, 
for the Emergency Civil Liberties 'Committee, amid for the late Congressman 
Vito Marcantonio. 
Abrams has carried out Communist policies in many ostensibly non-Commu-
nist organizations which have, in fact, served as fronts for the Communist

Party. Among the organizations promoted by the Communists in which he 
has played an active role are the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, the 
American Committee ft tr the Protection of the Foreign Born, the Hiroshima Com-
memorative Committee, the National Committee of the American Forum for 
Socialist Education, the American Labor Party, the United Independent Socialist 
Conference Committee. 
I state all these things as facts, Mr. President. On Friday, May 13, Henry 
Abrams was given the opportunity to deny them in a hearing of the Senate 
Subcommittee on Internal Security. He invoked the fifth amenthnent in reply to 
all questions regarding his years' long record of service to the Communist con-
spiracy. 
The obvious and declared purpose of the Madison Square Garden meeting 
was to influence American policy on the nuclear test; ban. It is one thing when 
American citizens comae together, in accordance with their rights, for the pur-
pose of urging a specific policy on their Government. It is an altogether differ-
mit thing when such a meeting is infiltrated by the Communists and when the 
chief organizing role falls into the hands of a member of the j'ommunist Party, 
which, as we all know. is a quisling instrument of Soviet policy. Such a sit-
nitim an important bearing on American security, because it is axio-
matic that all actions if the Communist Party are planned to subserve the ends 
tif Soviet diplomacy. 
Let me say here, patent hetieally, that this is by no means the only occasion of 
Communist machinations in the field of nuclear policy. At a previous hearing, 
Nve established that A vrahm G. Mezerik, a man with a long Communist ree-
ord, act unity managed :t so-called Amerivan Nobel Anniversary Forum arid Din-
ner. held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City on January 11, Pt58, 
which concentrated on t he theme of an American ban on nuclear testing. it. was 
brought out in this hearing that, this gathering while managed by a Commu-
nist. W:1S financed by a prominent American capitalist, who was unaware of 
Mezerik's Communist record. 
With all tins interest in the subject, the Internal Security Subcommittee 
summoned Mr. Abrams to appear and testify. Through his attorney, Leonard 
Bowfin. of New York, Mr. Abrams pleaded illness, and asked to be excused from 
coming to Washington to testify. We then arranged to hear him in New York 
City. He showed up with tt doctor's certificate that he was suffering from heart 
disease, and moved a further continuance on the ground 1hat his condition 
was so serious that being questioned might cause him serious harm. Since the 
committee was aware that Mr. Abrams had continued right up to that day to 
carry a heavy load as the man in active charge of arrangements for the May 19 
meeting at Madison Square Garden, we were not impressed by these claims. 
We had a New York City Public health Service doctor present, and asked 
Mr. Abrams if he would consent to be examined then and Howe. Ile refused, 
so we denied the request for a continuance and went ahead with the hearing, 
which was in executive session. 
As I have indicated the hearing had been called in the hope that we could 
learn front Mr. Abrams the full story of Communist infiltration of and partici-
pation in this movement for a nuclear test ban, as a basis for determining what, 
if any, legislation may he indicated in this area. 
The subcommittee has received evidence, much of it still of a classified na-
ture, that Henry Abrams is not a lone infiltrator, that there exists in fact a 
serious Communist infiltration in the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. 
What, specifically, are the Communists attempting to achieve by their in-
filtration of the test ban movement, including their recent all-out support of 
the Madison Square Garden meeting? The answer to this is, I believe, obvious. 
The Communist purpose in supporting the test ban agitation and in going all 
out to make the Madison Square Garden meeting a success is to exert pressure on 
the administration to make still further concessions to the Soviet, viewpoint in 
order to arrive at a test ban agreement ; to create a climate of public opinion 
which will make it impossible for the administration to resume small under-
ground tests, even though there may be every reason to believe that the Kremlin 
is conducting such tests; to enervate the free world so that it becomes incapable 
of responding with appropriate measures to challenges at Berlin and at other 
points. 
In the test ban negotiations that are now going on there are major differ-
ences between the Soviet position and our own. These differences hinge around 
he question of inspection. In my own opinion, we have already conceded too

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 173 
much, especially by agreeing in principle to a further voluntary moratorium on 
undetectable underground tests. But for those tests that are subject to detec-
tion, we still take the stand that here should be an inspection system based on 
an adequate number of fixed stations, with at least 20 or 30 onsite inspections 
per annum. The Kremlin wants a minimum of inspection. It wants as few 
stations as possible, and its spokesmen have indicated that they would not be 
willing to accept more than a few onsite inspections per annum. 
The Kremlin apparently attached major importance to the Madison Square 
Garden meeting as a pressure operation in support of its nuclear objectives. 
This, I believe, is conclusively demonstrated by the generous and sympathetic 
coverage of the meeting in the Soviet press. I think this is interesting. Ac-
cording to an AP dispatch of May 21st, Pravda headlined its account of the 
meeting with the words "We Want To Live in Friendship With the Soviet 
Union," while the Izvestia headline read "Rebuff to Advocates of War." 
I believe that the heads of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy have a 
serious contribution to make to the great debate on national policy. But they 
can only make this contribution effectively if they purge their ranks ruthlessly 
of Communist infiltration and if they clearly demarcate their own position from 
that of the Communists, first, by stressing the need for adequate inspection, sec-
ond, by reiterating at every opportunity their opposition to the tyranny of 
communism 
On the basis of the evidence that has come to me, I do not believe that the 
Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy has taken the necessary measures to cre-
ate a climate that is inhospitable to Communist infiltration. At the Madison 
Square Garden rally, for example, there was much direct and inferential criti-
cism of American policy, but, according to the press accounts and reports from 
private sources?persons who were present at the meeting?there was almost no 
criticism of Khrushchev or of his arrogant, insulting, gutter-level behavior in 
Paris. On the contrary, the speakers called for an immediate effort to renew 
the summit conference. 
Let me digress briefly for a comment on this last proposal, which has, un-
fortunately, not been confined to the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. 
Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but to me it seems that after the President of the 
United States has had to endure a barrage of the crudest insults ever leveled 
at a head of state, a petition to Khrushchev for another summit meeting would 
constitute a total abandonment of national dignity. The only conceivable politi-
cal consequences of so craven an action would be to encourage Khrushchev to 
further arrogance and further demands. 
As I have said, I have found no serious evidence that the Madison Square 
Garden meeting was organized and conducted in a manner which would have 
discouraged Communist participation. It was not surprising, therefore, that 
the Communists and their sympathizers turned out in force. Although no 
Gallup poll or breakdown was possible, I am convinced from reports that the 
Communists were responsible for a very substantial percentage of the overflow 
turnout. A number of well-known Communists, including Alexander Trachten-
berg, a top party member, were observed in the audience. Outside the meeting, 
the Communists brazenly distributed literature in their own name. 
If decent organizations like the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy wish to 
protect themselves against the danger of Communist infiltration, I cannot em-
phasize too strongly the need for an organizational climate that is openly 
inhospitable to Communists. This is a situation where a tepid declaration of 
devotion to democracy simply will not suffice, while a neutral silence is an open 
invitation to disaster. 
I can think of other things that can and should be done by the directors of 
the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy and of other non-Communist organi-
zations which must contend with the problem of Communist infiltration. At 
top level, control is relatively easy. One can more or less assume that the 
people who are elected to a board of directors or to a national committee have 
enjoyed public visibility over a period of years so that their records are known. 
At the local level, not even the FBI with all of its resources could offer a 100 
percent guarantee against infiltration. However, I think it is possible for 
organizations to exercise a good deal of control by carefully examining the 
personal records and bona fides, first, of all those who volunteer to help estab-
lish local organizations; second, of those who are elected to office in local 
organizations; thi rd of all those assigned to organizing activities.

174 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
If any effort had been made to do these things, the Madison Square Garden 
shut:then might have been avoided. But for 25 years, Henry Abrams has been 
a tlommunist. Without looking up his record, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear 
Polley allowed him to become the chief organizer of the rally in New York City. 
That was not taking the necessary precautionary measures. 
I think it is not too much to ask that all such committees, which are headed 
by good people and made up of thousands of good people, might to give considera-
tbm to the question whether Communists like Abrams are taking a part in the 
running of their meetings. Many of these committees have been doing good 
work. But it is little womier that they become infiltrated by Communists if 
tiny do not take the pains and the time to ascertain who sonic of their people 
are, before they allow them to become officers or chief organizers of mass rallies. 
I believe it is not too much to ask our fellow citizens who are organizing 
committees for the purpose of exerting influence on Congress?as they have 
every right to do---to make a preliminary, cursory check of the persims who tire 
working in their organizations, especially before they hold snob meetings. 
This would not be an easy task. But there is much that can lie done. It will 
not always be possible to obtain accurate personal information. because many 
Communists operate underground as secret party members. But la the case of 
a !min like Abrams, who has a public record of membership, the facts should 
I. e available without too much effort. 
Derhaps this is a situation in which private organizations can in some way he 
assisted by Government. This is a problem that the Subcommittee on Internal 
Sol:Lilly is at present exploring. 
Mr. President, in closing my remarks, I wish to pay my personal tribute to 
Mr. Norman Cousins, Gm chairman of the Committee for a 'Sane Nuclear Policy, 
for the manner in whieb he has reacted to the revelations of the subcommittee. 
Mr. Cousins has been a neighbor :mil a friend of mine for many years. I have 
the highest regard for i imit. That is why I alled him ute and told him what. I 
it it 'wabout Abrams. Ile ?Vflti good enough to come to Washington to see me-
I said. "T don't want to release this material 24 hours before your meeting. 
Ti ii lin re your plans all mad". But many innocent people will be present, and 
a number of them will be prominent people. Why haven't you checked on peo-
ple like Abrams? Norman Thomas said in January that he Wa S doubtful about 
the man's background. Ben, it is the middle of May, on the eve, of your meet-
ing. and you have not yei done anything." 
Mr. Cousins WAS lipSCt. about the matter. Tie immediately suspended Abrams. 
Net only did he do this, but he told me he wits glad we had informed him about 
Abrams. Ile offered to open the books of his organization to the subcommittee 
ant to ce/merate in OVOTY Way to rid his organization of Communists. 
assure Mr. Cousins and other persons connected with his committee that the 
Subcommittee on internal Security is ready to cooperate with them to help to 
prevent a repetition of the Madison Square Garden situation. 
think it is not too much to say that the subcommittee is desirous and willing 
to help any other organization to avoid infiltration by subterranean elements 
who are not there for tiny good purpose, and who are certainly not interested, 
as are the good people who make up the bulk of their membership, in the welfare 
of the United States.

APPENDIX I 
BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS ON EVENTS 
INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
I. PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV'S REMARKS ON U.S. PLANE 
[From the New York Times, May 6, 1960] 
LONDON, May 5 (Reuters)?Following, in translation, are excerpts 
from the section of Premier KItrushekev's address today referring to 
the shooting down of a United States plane Sunday, as broadcast from 
Moscow: 
On instructions of the Soviet Government, I am duty bound to 
report to you on aggressive acts directed in the last few weeks by the 
United States of America against the Soviet Union. 
What form did these aggressive acts take? The United States 
sent its planes, which violated our state frontier and intruded into 
the airspace of the Soviet Union. 
Its last but one aggressive act was perpetrated by the United States 
of America on April 9,1960. 
A United States plane intruded into the airspace of our country 
from the Afghanistan side. Of course, no man in his right senses 
can think and assume that this violation was done by Afghanistan, 
a country which is friendly with us. 
We are convinced that this plane belonged to the United States of 
America and obviously was based somewhere on the territory of 
Turkey, Iran or Pakistan, which are linked with the U.S.A. by obli-
gations under the aggressive CENTO bloc. 
[Mr. Khrushchev said the Soviet Government decided against mak-
ing a protest but ordered military commanders to act if another plane 
intruded.] 
American military men apparently liked this impunity as it hap-
pened on April 9, and they decided to repeat the aggressive act. 
INCIDENT ON MAY DAY 
Selected for this was the most festive day for our people and the 
workers of the world?the day of May the First?the international 
holiday of fraternal solidarity of the working class. 
That day, early in the morning, at 0536 hours, Moscow time, an 
American plane flew over our frontier and continued its flight into the 
interior of the Soviet land. A report on this aggressive act was im-
mediately given to the Government by the Minister of Defense.

176 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
The Government had stated this: Since he realizes what he comes 
up against when intruding into a foreign territory, if he gets away 
ith it he will attempt fresh provocations. Therefore, the plane must 
be shot down. 
This task was fulfilled and the plane was shot down. 
According to first information, it has transpired that the plane 
belongs to the United States of America although it bears no identifi-
cation signs. 
Now an expert commission is studying data that fell in our hands. 
It has been established that this plane that crossed the state frontier 
of the Soviet Union was coming either from Turkey, Iran or Pakistan. 
After the study of all materials that are now at our disposal, the 
Soviet Government will lodge with the United States of America a 
strong protest and will warn it that if similar aggressive acts against 
our country continue, we reserve the right to respond to them with 
measures we shall find necessary in order to insure the safety of our 
country. 
We shall also give the most serious warning to those countries that 
put their territories at the disposal of the United States of America 
for aggressive acts directed against our country. 
The following conclusion comes to mind: Aggressive imperialist 
forces in the United States in recent times have been taking the most 
active measures to undermine the summit or at least to hinder any 
agreement that might be reached. 
"WHO SENT THIS AIRCRAFT?" 
The question then arises: Who sent this aircraft across the Soviet 
frontier? Was it the man who is Commander in Chief of the American 
armed forces who, as everyone knows, is the President ? Or was this 
aggressive act carried out by Pentagon militarists? 11 f such actions 
are taken by American military men on their own account, it must 
be of especial concern to world opinion. 
Perhaps it was a result of the friendship that is now forming be-
tween the United States and Franco that the American militarists 
decided to act independently, as did the Spanish military junta, which 
rose up against the legal Spanish Government. 
Thus, in the so-called free world, military dictators not seldom set 
up their regimes using the methods of Franco. But the peoples are 
beginning to understand where true freedom is and where there is 
tyranny. 
Take, for instance, the events in South Korea. The head of the 
puppet Syngnian Mee regime, the best friend of the United States 
and the father of his country as someone or other called hita in Amer-
ica, has IIONV been overthrown by the people and is now a political 
corpse. And it was not the Communists who were behind these events; 
even American politicial leaders have had to admit. 
The sufferings of the Korean people led them to rise up against the 
bestial yoke, and the peoples understand that it was not only a question 
of Syngman Rhee himself who was to blame but all those who sup-
ported him and hung him round the necks of the South Koreans. 
It is no coincidence that the free world sees so many popular demon-
strations demanding freedom.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 177 
Comrade Deputies, the impression is being formed that the aggres-
sive actions newly undertaken by the United States against the Soviet 
Union are a foretaste of the summit meeting. 
Are they taken in order to exert pressure on us and to attempt to 
frighten us with their military superiority in order to undermine our 
determination to work for easing tension, to eliminate the cold war 
and to put an end to the arms race? 
All these missions are sent in order to prevent any agreement on 
vexing questions, for we cannot say that this aircraft was a harbinger 
of peace, that it was on a goodwill mission. No, it was a real bandit 
flight with aggressive intentions. 
We can say to those gentlemen who sent the aircraft that if they 
think they can bend our knees and our backs by means of such pres-
sure, this will have no effect on us. The Soviet Union has every means 
to give a rebuff to those who want to exert pressure in order to achieve 
a solution convenient to aggressors. 
In the name of the Soviet Government let me express thanks to the 
men of the military units who carried out with honor the task laid on 
them in defending the frontiers of our motherland. 
Comrades, the Soviet people and Government have always expressed 
their peaceful intentions and friendly feelings toward the United 
States, but in answer to this we have black ingratitude. 
"FEELINGS OF INDIGNATION" 
It is understood that this has aroused feelings of indignation against 
the activities of the American military men. But we must control this 
feeling and must be ruled not by our emotions, but by reason. 
Government leaders interested in preserving peace must soberly con-
sider the consequences of such actions and think what they might 
lead to. 
Hitler's aircraft before the war used to intrude into our airspace. 
The Soviet Government would protest, but Hitler refused to pay at-
tention and then attacked us. And where did that all end? 
How do we assess the incursion of American aircraft?as a precursor 
of war or a foreshadow of attack, of the repetition of what Hitler 
did? The Soviet Government thinks that all the same there is no 
reason to draw such conclusions. 
There is another relationship of power in the world, and in this the 
people's will to peace plays a great part and this is why we do not con-
clude that this is a prewar trial of strength or a reconnaissance made 
to try our nerves, preserve the atmosphere of the cold war so that the 
imperialists can continue to bind their people with taxation, to carry 
on the arms race, and to keep their people in a state of fear of war and 
to continue to impose their will. 
The Soviet Union has no aggressive intentions, we do not want the 
cold war, we want disarmament and our proposals made to the United 
Nations on this subject remain in force still. Once again, we, repeat 
that disarmament is the right way to preserve peace and in such condi-
tions no country would be able unilaterally to arm and attack another. 
The Soviet Government once again calls on the Government of the 
United States to end the cold war. All states must act peaceably so 
that calm, peace and happiness can prevail.

2. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT NEWS RELEASE, MAY 5, 1960 
[No. 509-60] 
For the Press: 
The U.S. Air Force confirmed on May 3, 1960, that a NASA 13-2 
aircraft is missing in Turkey. It was on a weather mission originating 
at Adana, Turkey. Purpose was a study of clear air turbulence. Dur-
ing the flight in SE Turkey the pilot reported oxygen difficulty. Last 
word heard at 9 a.m. 1st of May, Turkish time (3 a.m.. 1 May (WA.) 
over emergency frequency. 11-2 aircraft did not land at Adana as 
planned and could only be assumed down. A search effort is underway 
in Lake Van area. 
The missing TT-2 is a National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion aircraft. The pilot is an employee of Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 
under contract to NASA. 
The U-2 program was initiated in 1955 to perform high altitude 
weather research. 
The flight was a joint NASA/AF Air Weather Service Mission.

Mr. WirtTE. Now, he Department has been informed by NASA 
that 1,s announced May 3 an unarmed plane, ft 17-2 weather research 
Pilule based at. Adana, Turkey, piloted by a civilian has been missing 
since May I. During the flight of this plane, the pilot reported 
difficulty with his oxygen equipment. Mr. Khrusitchev has an-
nounced that. a I T.S. plane has been shot. down over the 1. T.S.S.R. on 
hat date. It may be that, this was the missing plane. It is entirely 
possible that haying a failure in the oxygen equipment, w Lich Mild 
result, in the pilot 1, tsi og consciousness, the plane com limed on auto-
ntatic pilot for a, eonsiderable distance and ttocident a lly violated Soviet; 
airspace. The United States is taking this matter up with the Soviet 
4lovernment, with partitular reference to the fate of the pilot. 
That, is the, end of the statement. 
Q. What was the plane doing, weather nwormaissa nee? 
A. NASA is briefing reporters on the full details of that. 
Q. When you say yon are taking this matter up with the Soviet 
Government, do you mean you are asking for information on the 
pilot, or making a protest about the plane? 
A. This matter is being taken up with the Soviet!, Government,

4. NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE A DMINIST RA-
TION NEWS RELEASE, MAY 5, 1960 
[NASA Release No. 60-193] 
Memo in the Press: 
One of NASA's U-2 research airplanes, in use since 1956 in a 
continuing program to study gust-meteorological conditions found 
at high altitude, has been. missing since about 9 o'clock Sunday morn-
ing (local time), when its pilot reported he was having oxygen diffi-
culties over the Lake Van, Turkey, area. 
The airplane had taken off from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. The 
flight plan called for the first check point to be at 37 degrees, 25 
minutes, North: 41 degrees, 23 minutes, East, and for a left turn to be 
made to the Lake Van beacon, thence to the Trabazon beacon, thence 
to Antalya, and return to Adana. The flight scheduled was estimated 
at 3 hours, 45 minutes, for a total of 1,400 nautical miles. Takeoff 
was at 8 a.m. local time. 
(The above-given tin res are the equivalent of 3 a.m. Sunday, and 
2 a.m., eastern daylight time.) 
About 1 hour after takeoff, the pilot reported difficulties with his 
oxygen equipment. Using emergency radio frequency, he reported he 
was heading for the Lake Van beacon to get his bearings, and that 
he would return to Adana. 
As indicated above, his flight plan called for him to make a left turn 
at the Lake Van beacon. His last report indicated he was attempting 
to receive that beacon. It is believed he probably was on a north-
easterly course, but there was no further word. 
An aerial search was begun soon after receipt of the last communi-
cation. The Lake Van area is mountainous and very rugged. No 
evidence has been sighted of the aircraft having crashed. 
If the pilot continued to suffer lack of oxygen, the path of the air-
plane from the last reported position would be impossible to de-
termine. If the airplane was on automatic pilot, it is likely it would 
liave continued along its northeasterly course. 
The pilot, as are all pilots used on NASA's program of upper at-
mosphere research with the U-2 airplane, is a civilian employed by 
the Lockheed Aircraft Corp., builders of the airplane. 
When the research program was begun in 1956 by the National 
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (predecessor to NASA), the 
Federal agency did not have a sufficient number of pilots to operate 
the program, and so a contract was made with Lockheed to provide 
t he pilots. 
Overseas logistic support for NASA's continuing use of the U-2 is 
provided by Air Weather Service units of the USAF. 
NASA has procured a total of 10 U-2 airplanes. The airplane 
was originally built as a private venture by Lockheed to :serve .as a 
"flying test bed." It is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney .1-57

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 181 
The U-2 airplanes are presently being used in California (Ed-
wards AFB, one) , Japan ( tsugi, three) and Turkey (Adana, four). 
The instrumentation carried by the U-2 permits obtaining more 
precise information about clear air turbulence, convective clouds, 
wind shear, the jet stream, and such widespread weather patterns as 
typhoons. The airplane also has been used by NASA to obtain 
information about cosmic rays and the concentration of certain ele-
ments in the atmosphere, including ozone and water vapor. 
Instrumentation carried includes: Angular velocity recorder, to 
measure the airplane's rate of pitch; modified VGH recorder, to 
measure and record head-on gust components in flight; flight recorder 
Model BB, continuous recorder of indicated airspeed., pressure alti-
tude and normal acceleration; airspeed and altitude transducer to 
measure pressure altitude and indicated airspeed; temperature and 
humidity measuring set AN/AMQ 7, to measure indicated free air 
temperature and indicated relative humidity; and vortex thermometer 
system, to measure true free-air temperature within one-half degree 
centigrade at high speeds. 
5. DEPARTMENT OF STATE PRESS RELEASE, MAY 6, 1960 
[No. 249] 
The following is the text of a note delivered today by the American 
Embassy at Moscow to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs: 
The Embassy of the United States of America by instruction of its 
Government has the honor to state the following: 
iftsoi The United States Government has noted the statement of the Chair-
man of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
publics, N. S. Khrushchev, in his speech before the Supreme Soviet 
on May 5 that a foreign aircraft crossed the border of the Soviet Union 
on May 1 and that on orders of the Soviet Government, this aircraft 
was shot down. In this same statement it was said that investigation 
showed that it was a United States plane. 
As already announced on May 3, a United States National Aeronau-
tical Space Agency unarmed weather research plane based at Adana, 
Turkey, and piloted by a civilian American has been missing since May 
1. The name of the American civilian pilot is Francis Gary Powers, 
born on August 17,1929, at Jenkins, Kentucky. 
In the light of the above the United States Government requests the 
Soviet Government to provide it with full facts of the Soviet investi-
gation of this incident and to inform it of the fate of the pilot. 
6. EXCERPTS FROM PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV'S REMARKS 
ON U.S. PLANE INCIDENT, MAY 7, 1960 
[From the New York Times, May 8, 1960] 
Following are excerpts from the concluding speech to the meeting 
of the Supreme Soviet in Moscow yesterday by Premier Khrushchev, 
as provided in English in New York by Tass, the official Soviet press 
agency:

182 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 
Soviet people. Numerous inquiries and appeals are being received 
by the session and the Soviet Government. In view of this permit me 
to dwell on this question once again and to furnish certain new data. 
After my report to the Supreme Soviet, in which I dwelt on this 
fact, the United States Department of State claimed in an official 
press statement that t he point in question was a violation of the Soviet 
State Frontier by an American aircraft of the "Lockheed U-2" type, 
which allegedly was studying weather conditions in the upper layers 
of the atmosphere in the area of the Turkish-Soviet frontier. 
This plane had allegedly strayed off its course because the pilot had 
oxygen trouble. The State Department asserts that the pilot lost 
consciousness and, steered by its automatic pilot, the plane flew into 
Soviet territory. According to the Department of State, the pilot 
only had time to report back about the failure of his oxygen equip-
ment to the Turkish airdrome in Adana, whence it flew, an airdrome 
which allegedly does not belong to the military but to the National 
Aeronautics and Space Research Administration. 
Soon after that, the National Aeronautics and Space Research 
Administration issued a statement with a view to confirming the State 
lfepartment's version. 
"141ANY SILLY THINGS" 
Comrades, I must tell you a secret. When I was making my report 
deliberately did not say that the pilot was alive and in good health 
and that we have got, parts of the plane. We did so deliberately be-
cause had we told everything at once, the Americans would have 
invented another version. 
And now, just look how many silly things they have said--Van 
'Lake, scientific research and so on and so forth. Now that they know 
that the pilot is alive they will have to invent something else and they 
will do it. 
[Mr. Khrushchev read from the United States statement issued 
alter his first, announcement: it was printed in the New York Times 
last Friday.] 
These are the official versions put into circulation by American 
officials to mislead the public opinion of their country and the world. 
I must declare, comrade Deputies, that these versions are completely 
untrue and calculated for gullible people. 
The authors of these versions supposed that if the plane was shot 
down, the pilot most probably perished too. So there will be nobody 
to ask how everything actually happened, there will be no way to 
check what sort of plane it was and what instruments it carried. 
"ALIVE AND IN GOOD HEALTH" 
First of all, I wish to announce that the pilot of the shot-down 
American plane is alive and in good health. He, is HOW in Moscow. 
13rought here also are t he remains of this plane and its special instru-
mentation, discovered daring the investigation. 
The name of this pilot is Francis Gary Powers. He is 30 years old. 
Ile says he is a first lieutenant of the United States A ir Force, where 
he served till 1956, that is, to the day when he went over tot he Central 
Intelligence Agency.

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 183 
Francis Powers reported, incidentally, that while serving with the 
American Air Force he used to get $700 a month, but when he went 
over to the intelligence service and started carrying out spying as-
signments to glean secret information, he began getting $2,500 a 
month. That is how capital buys lives, buys people. The flier testi-
fied that he had no dizziness, nor had his oxygen apparatus failed. 
He was flying along the assigned course, accurately executing his 
chief's orders, switching on and off the equipment over the pre-
selected targets for gleaning intelligence on the Soviet Union's mili-
tary and industrial establishments, and flew on until the very mo-
ment his piratical flight into this country's interior was cut short. 
I want to tell something about the results of the examination 
of the plane that has been shot down and its equipment, as well as of 
the questioning of the pilot. The inquiry still continues, but the pic-
ture is fairly clear already. 
PLANE TYPE CONFIRMED 
To start with, this was, indeed, a high-altitude, low-speed "Lock-
heed IT-2." They banked on its high altitude and believed that this 
plane cannot be brought down by any fighter or antiaircraft artil-
lery. That is why they thought it could fly over Soviet territory with 
immunity. In fact, the plane flew at a great altitude and it was hit 
by the rocket at an altitude of 20,000 meters [65,000 feet]. And if 
they fly higher, we will also hit them! The plane was in no way 
equipped for "upper atmosphere research" or for taking "air sam-
ples," as official American spokesmen assert. 
Not at all. This was a real military reconnaissance aircraft fitted 
with various instruments for collecting intelligence and, among other 
things, for aerial photography. 
The competent commission of experts, which examined the wrecked 
plane, has established from the documentary evidence that this Amer-
ican plane is a specially prepared reconnaissance aircraft. The task 
of the plane was to cross the entire territory of the Soviet Union from 
the Pamirs to the Kola Peninsula to get information on our coun-
try's military and industrial establishments by means of aerial photog-
raphy. Besides aerial cameras the plane carried other reconnaissance 
equipment for spotting radar networks, identifying the location and 
frequencies of operating radio stations and other special radio en-
gineering equipment. 
Not only do we have the equipment of that plane, but we also have 
the developed film showing a number of areas of our territory. Here 
are some of these photos. Here are photos of these airfields. Here 
are two white lines. They are lines of our fighters. Here is another 
airfield and also planes on it. All these films we developed ourselves. 
CAMERA IS PRAISED 
Here are photos of petrol stores. It must be said that the camera 
is not a bad one and the photo is very accurate. 
But I must say that our cameras take better pictures, are more 
accurate, so that we gained little in this respect. 
These photos here show industrial enterprises.

;-,4 EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFEHENCE 
There is also a tape recording of the signals of a number of our 
ground radar stations. These are incontestible evidence of the spying 
done by the American plane shot down in the vicinity of Sverdlovsk. 
That is what. "air samples" American reconnaissance took, and it took 
them not, over Van Lake in Turkey but quite elsewhere. 
The only thing that. is true is that this plane was stationed at the 
A merican-Turkish air base at Incirlik east of Adana. As Powers, the 
tiler, testified, he was serving with the 10-10 unit, which, for the, sake 
of disguise, is under control of the National Aeronautics and Space 
A dministration, but in reality, conducts high-altitude military recon-
ha issance. 
In his depositions. Powers mentioned the names of several officers 
he had served with at the American military base in Turkey. Ac-
cording to Powers' testimony, the commander of the American i10-10 
unit is Col. William Shelton and his deputy is Lieut. Col. Carol Funk. 
Before his flight, Powers had long trained himself for flying into 
the, depth of this country and, as he said himself, he had flown along-
the Soviet frontier many times in order to study the radar system 
of the Soviet Union. 
"POWERS, THE SCOUT" 
On April 27, Powers, the scout, flew over from the Turkish city 
o 1 Adana to the Peshawar airfield in Pakistan on orders from his 
superiors. And it was, I herefore, front Pakistan's territory, that is. 
from the Peshawar a irlield?and not from the Turkish airfield outside 
Adana, as stated in the I Tnited States State Department's version?
that Powers took oft on May 1 with instruction to fly along the course 
indicated on his map over the Aral Sea, Sverdlovsk and other points 
and reach Archangel and Murmansk, before landing at the Thule air-
field in Norway. 
Now we can say where he was flying to. I must, admit. that we knew 
it already when I was reporting this fact. We did not. say anything. 
at that time in order to see what the Americans would invent. Now 
that they have made their invention, we report how everything actually 
Ii appened. 
This is what Powers said when questioned about the task of his flight 
over Soviet territory. 
"I was to take off from the Peshawar airfield in Pakistan, cross the 
national frontier of the U.S.S.R. and fly across Soviet territory to 
Norway. I was to fly over certain points of the U.S.S.R., of which I 
remember Murmansk and Archangel. During my flight over Soviet 
territory I was to switch on and off the equipment over certain points. 
indicated on the map. I believe my flight over Soviet, territory was 
meant for collecting information on Soviet guided missiles and radar-
stations." 
I want to ask the gentlemen from the, State Department: :Is it. such 
"air samples over Lake Van" that the spy flier Powers was to take?' 
IRAQI REVOLT RECALLED 
I say nothing of the fact that by flying along this course, the Ameri-
can scout plane grossly violated the national sovereignty .of Afghan-

EVENTS INCIDENT TO THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE 185 
istan by having flown across that country's territory without permis-
sion. But there is, perhaps, nothing extraordinary in this for the 
morals of American militarists. Such actions of theirs have long been 
known. 
Suffice it to recall the flight of American military aircraft over the 
territory of Austria, when the aggression was being prepared against 
Iraq, where a revolution had just taken place. The Austrian Govern-
ment protested against the treacherous violation of Austria's sover-
eignty by American military aircraft and against that blatant act of 
disrespect for her neutrality sealed by the signatures of the United 
States, among others. 
If one believes the version that the pilot lost consciousness owing to 
oxygen trouble and that the aircraft was subsequently controlled by 
the automatic pilot, one must also believe that the aircraft controlled 
by an automatic pilot flew from Turkey to Pakistan, touched down at 
Peshewar Airport, stayed there three days took off early in the 
morning of May 1, flew over the territory of Afghanistan, crossed the 
Soviet frontier, flew more than 2,000 kilometers over our territory for 
a total of some four hours. 
All the time of the flight over our territory the aircraft was under 
observation and was brought down as soon as the order was received. 
When our anti-aircraft rocket battery intercepted and brought down 
the plane, the pilot, it must be believed, soon regained his conscious-
ness because he bailed out by parachute; you just note he was not 
ejected by the automatic device but left through the upper canopy 
designed for emplaning. The question arises why did he do this if 
there are devices for rapid ejection? 
'lame He did this possibly because there was an explosive charge in the 
aircraft which was to have blown up the plane as soon as the pilot was 
ejected. The pilot knew this and possibly was afraid that he would be 
killed in the explosion. Clever enough! 
"NOT THE ONLY PRECAUTION" 
But the installation of the infernal machine was not the only pre-
caution taken. To cover up the tracks of the crime the pilot was told 
that he must not fall alive in the hands of the Soviet authorities. For 
this reason he was supplied with a special pin. He was to have pricked 
himself with this poisoned pin, resulting in instantaneous death. 
What a barbarism! Here is this instrument?the latest achievement 
of American technology for the killing of their own people ( a photo-
graph is produced). 
But everything alive wants to live and when the plane was brought 
down the pilot bailed out by parachute. And when he landed he did 
not follow the advice of those who sent him on his anti-Soviet preda-
tory assignment but remained alive. 
It is alleged that the flight was made for scientific purposes to in-
vestigate the upper layers of the atmosphere. The question arises why 
the pilot then had to be armed with a noiseless pistol. He was given 
it for some emergency, not to take air samples but to blow people's 
brains out. All this we shall present to the public as material evidence. 
This is what, so to say, such Christians are like.

He was given this pistol after making low bows as they do in 
churches. And yet they call us godless atheists. Yet we have never 
committed such crimes against humanity and never will. If the pilot 
was given a pistol to de-fend himself against wild beasts in case of a 
forced landing, the question arises, why a pistol with a silencer? This 
also shows what so-called scientific purposes were pursued by the 
plane. 
The pilot who was supposed to explore the atmosphere was given 
.7,500 rubles in Soviet currency. The question arises, when and 
where was he to have spent them and for what purposes, for he did 
not fly to exchange old rubles for new? 
4;1)1.1) FRANCS, GUI I) RINGS 
The pilot was also given French gold francs. I have seen these gold 
francs with my own eyes. And you can see them here in. the photo-
graph. They are covered with cellophane on both sides of the coins. 
I tone in a cultured, American way. But what did the pilot need these 
francs for? also had West G'ennan, Italian, and other currency. 
Besides his own watch he was also given for his trip another two gold 
watches and seven gold rings for ladies. Why was all this necessary 
in the upper layers of the atmosphere? Or, maybe, the pilot was to 
have flown still higl ter to Mars and was going to lead astray Martian 
ladies? 
You see how thoroughly American pilots are equipped before setting 
oil on a flight to take samples of air in the upper layers of the atmos-
phere. Thus, no concocted version can save the reputation of those 
Nvho bear the responsibility for this perfidious act. 
Thus, no concocted version can save the reputation of those who bear 
the responsibility for this perfidious action. They were caught red-
handed as organizers of the incursion in the airspace of the Soviet 
Union not long before the meeting of the heads of government in 
Paris, not long before the visit, to the Soviet Union of the President of 
the United States. I believe that this is a bad preparation for serious 
talks on easing :in tort rational tension. 
I am now reading in the Western press comments on these events 
and 1 here are some people who accuse us, Khrushchev, of wanting to 
undermine the stunnit meeting because otherwise he would not have 
presented this fact ;it the session of the Supreme Soviet but raised it 
through some other channels but what did you expect, gentlemen? 
You are accustomed to make mischief and some people regard this as 
all but a good thing and keep silent. No, we are not such kind of 
people: if you made mischief bear the responsibility for this openly.

self off. But there is another country, the country of socialism, where 
law protects the state, protects society, protects everyone living in this 
state.

Comments on True Magazine Version of U-2 Incident  
1. Statement: "Other spy planes had penetrated deep into 
Ruseia, one sneaking within a few miles of Moscow. But Powers 
was to be the first to cross the vast Soviet land mass from the Aral 
to the Barents Seas. His main checkpoints: 
"I? Tyura Tam, the great Soviet missile center in the 
desert east of the Aral Sea. 
. The Sverdlovsk rocket sites. 
"3. The Soviet air and submarinebases at Archangel 
and Murmansk. 
"His touch-down on friendly soil would be at Bodo, Norway." 
Comment: The Russians released to the world very shortly 
after the May lit incident photographs a the mission route map carried 
in the cockpit of the aircraft which contained the check points noted in 
the above quotation. In addition, an enlarged photograph of this map 
was on display throughout the public exhibition of the aircraft in Moscow 
at Gorki Park. This was the first planned South-north flight_ 
2. Statement: "It was known that a monster missile, twice the 
sise of .America's 107-foot Atlas, was poised on a launching pad at Tyura 
Tam. The Central Intelligence Agency desperately wanted photographs 
of this new missile. They suspected it might be used for a long-hinted 
May Day apace spectacular." 
Comment: Tyura Tam was not the primary objective of the 
1 May mission. However, it was considered to be a valuable en route 
bonus target. There was no knowledge of any "monster missile" being 
in place on the launching pad, although there was some conjecture that 
the Soviets might attempt a space launching on I May for propaganda 
purposes.

. Statement: The weather on May Day was perfect. 
Comment: The weather on May Day was not perfect. The 
first portion of the route, to a point approximately 150 nautical miles 
south of Sverdlovsk, and including Tyura Tarn, was predicted to be 
cloud covered. The pilot was instructed to turn his camera on over 
Tyura Tam just as a precautionary measure in the event that holes 
In the undercast might permit some coverage of value. The area of 
primary interest, northwest of Sverdlovsk to the Kola Peninsula, was 
predicted to be clear and it was on this basis that the decision to go 
was made. Subsequent analysis of actual weather conditions substantiated 
the pre-mission forecast. 
4. Statement: "Nor would any other flights across Russia have 
been attempted until President Eisenhower had completed his visit to 
Russia in mid-June. May 2 had been set as the beginning of a mora-
torium on such aerial espionage, and for at least *ix weeks there would 
be no more. 
Comment It is true that authorisation for this particular 
overflight would have expired after 1 May: however, the six-week 
moratorium has no bests in fact. While there has been considerable 
conjecture about "deadlines", the above information was never disclosed, 
even in Congressional hearings. 
5. Statement: "Powers was not piloting the only U-2 in the air 
that day. Simultaneously, another U-2 had taken off from Incirlik to fly 
conspicuously along the Soviet border as a decoy. The pilot deltSerately 
sent meaningless messages over his radio to attract attention and to lure 
Soviet radar and monitoring stations into following him while Powers 
slipped into Russia unnoticed. The decoy would continue over Pakistan, 
then return to Incirlik. The Pakistan authorities who knew nothing of 
Powers secret mission, would be notified that a U-2 had arrived and 
they would aslUirle it Was Poly/Ors." 
Comment: The diversionary aircraft maintained radio 
silence throughout its mission. It was not intended as a decoy but was 
designed to substantiate the cover story and protect the pre-strike base 
in the event the mission aircraft was lost, particularly if it were

lost in proximity to the border. The diversionary mission did not go 
beyond Iran before turning and proceeding back to Turkey. 
The only other public reference we find to a second U-2 
flight was in an article by Chalmers Roberts in the Washington Post 
of 27 May 1960, which included the following statement: "The day of 
Powers' flight, there was a second U-2 flight from Turkey. This was 
a meteorological flight outside the Soviet Union, the kind of flight the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration unwittingly thought all 
U-2's were making. NASA was, of course, the 'cover' for the 
clandestine flights over the Soviet Union." 
6. Statement: It soon became clear, however, that the Ruse us 
had not been fooled by the decoy. American listening and watching stations 
picked up the frustrated comments of the Soviet defenders who had dis-
covered Powers but were unable to do anything about him. 
"Soviet jets leaped and snarled at the spy plane which 
hovered high out of their reach. For a tantalising moment one inter-
ceptor managed to reach the intruder's level. Our monitors could hear 
the Russian screaming like a banshee with the fury of his effort."

7. Statement: "To those daring young men who flew the U-2s, 
over Sverdlovsk was pretty much a triiik.run. They called the 
rk of domed rocket launchers below the "House of David." 
Comment: No overflight of the USSR was ever considered 
a "milk run" either by the pilots or anyone else associated with the 
project. The reference to the "House of David" is apparently* cor-
ruption of the term "Little David*" applied to the SAM sites by photo 
interpreters at PIC because of their geometric resemblance to a Star 
of David. This descriptive term WAS adopted by the Intelligence Com-
munity but was not supposedly known to the public.

but could not knock it down. Their anti-aircraft rockets fell short

Comment: This statement is true, with the exception 
of that portion referring to anti-aircraft rockets falling short at 
60,000 feet. There is no evidence that rockets were fired at the 
U-2 on any of its overflight. prior to I May. 
A statement by Khrushchev at the Czechoslovak Stubassy 
reception (reported in the New York Times, 10 May 1960) included the 
following:

3taff of the u. S. Air Force, arrived here we welcomed 
him as a guest and entertained him. He left our country 
by air and next day sent a giant flying at great altitude to 
our country. This plane flew as far as Kiev." 
The fact that one of the first Russian overflights 
penetrated deeply into the Soviet Union was widely publicized as a 
result of the official Soviet protest of 1 uly 1956. This note protested 
overflights on July 4, 5 and 9, 1956 by a "twin engined medium bomber' 
and cited that in one case a penetration of 320 kilometers had been 
achieved. The note did not mention Kiev, which was in fact covered 
on a mission on 9 July.

been at least two missions aimed at Sverdlovsk. The first went only 
half way, then turned back bemuse, the clouds made photography 
difficult." 
Comment. There had been only one mission to Sverdlovsk 
prior to the 1 May i . However, there was a mission targeted to 
own by Frank Powers, which did turn back prior to 
reaching the target because of cloud cover.

In response to your request I enclose a memorandum 
containing comments on the significant statements in the article in 
True Magasine for September 1960, entitled 
"Exclusive! Inside Story of Pilot Powers and his 
Secret U-2 Spy Flight. Official Air Force documents 
and secret reports reveal for the first time the true 
facts behind the spy-in.-the-sky misiiions. By Drew 
Pearson and Jack Anderson," 
As you will note, the title of the article refers to official 
Air force documents and secret reports as a source for the story. 
In the text of the article itself there ie reference to the story being 
"based on official Air Force reports." 
I also enclose a report of the radio interview of Drew 
Pearson by Patty Cavin on August 23, 1960, bearing on the 
Pearson-Anderson article in which Pearson claims "that we had 
access to the Air Force records in this flight". In another portion 
of the irtterviow Pearson refers to information that the Air force 
has. 
I am sending a copy of the enclosed report to General Walsh, 
Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence of the Air Force to ascertain 
whether he can throw any light on these references to the Air Force 
which of course may be a blind to divert attention from the real source 
of the information.

While there are a very large number of inaccuracies and

INTERVIEW WITH DREW PEARSON 
Patty Cavin at 12:15 P.M. over WRC (Washington): 
Miss Cavin interviewed columnist Drew Pearson, and the following was heard: 
CAVIN: "Columnist Pearson and his partner. Jack Anderson have the exclusive 
inside story of what really happened on May D y, 1960, when Lockheed pilot Francis 
Gary Powers took off in his sleek U-2 on,what'Iseemed to be an innocent weather 
flight. The account is published for the first time n the September issue or True, 
and seems to be backed up- today by statements made last night by. CIA Chief Allen 
Dulles. We'll have word with Drew Pearson first up on our 
"Page 34 of the September issue of the man's magazine True has a rather 
startling headline. It says, *Exclusive Inside Story of Pilot Powers and his Secret 
U-2 Spy Flight." The byline belongs to Drew Pearson and his partner Jack Anderson. 
We have Mr. Drew Pearson at our NBC microphone nob, and, Drew, I was fascinated and 
somewhat appalled to read this account of what really happened for the first time) 
because it differs rather considerably from the reports that we have had sine May 
Day on the Powers flight and what really did happen from the newspapers' standpoint. 
How come?" 
PEARSON: 'Well, I don't know, Patty, except that we had access to the Air Force 
records in this flight, and they very carefully monitored everything that Powers did, 
both at the time and then they had to reconstruct what happened afterwards, and, for 
Instance, when his plane was displayed at Gorki Park in Moscow, the propeller blade* 
were bent back, which wouldn't mean very much to you and me but to the Air Force it 
meant a great deal. It meant his plane had stalled in the air at a flight--at an 
altitude actually of 70,000 feet, and the plane never crashed. It came down to a 
landing whieh didn't break up the plane too much." 
CAVIN: "As you and Jack Anderson say in True magazine, to a belly-scraping 
landing." 
PEARSON: "Your words are better than mine. I see that you've really read that 
article." 
GAVIN: "Well, I couldn't put the article down, I must admit. Actually, Draw 
Pearson, let's go back and start at the findings that you and Jack Anderson began 
with. You traced the beginning of IJ-2'e." 
PEARSON: "Yes, we went back to approximately five years ago, perhaps a little 
bit before that. These flights have been taking place for a long time, not merely 
by the U-2 planes, but at first the United States various intelligence forces had 
attempted to get inforisation by balloon, and had sent balloons at a very high alti-
tude across Russia with photographic equipment. 
"Well, this ran into trouble. Later we sent planes across with pilots who were 
Americans of other origins who could speak Russian very well, and then i.e Switched 
finally to the U-2 plane after it was developed by Lockheed. We gave orders--there's 
no secret about any of this now--it's pretty well come out?we'd given orders that 
we had to have a U-2 plane ?it wasn't called U-2 originally?which could fly at a

terrific altitude so that no Russian plane could knock it down. 
"Nov there's one thing I might point out, that nur story differs. from the 
testimony of Francis Gary Powers in one respect, and it's a rather important respect. 
We say in this article that he--hie engine stalled at 700)0 feet. He says he was 
shot at and hit at 68,000 feet. I'm not quibbling about the 2,000 feet, that doesn t 
make much difference." 
GAVIN: "It's the shot-at area that you are qeibbling on. 
PEARSON: "That's right. In other words, he testified that the Russians shot 
him at 68,000 feet. The information that the Air Fore* has, and it is definitely 
official information--no, I don't think--and we repeat it there-- ie that he was not 
shot at, that the Russians have no missile or plane that could hit or fly that high. 
Ind, when, as we recount in this article) at approximately 70,000 feet-eit could 
have been 68,000--he turned on the emergency radAo in hie cockpit and shouted 
'Flame-out', which means stalled--his engine had stalled. And this was picked up in 
Turkey by one of our monitoring stations. And at that point he coasted down, Net 
as you would your car down a hill to start your engine again." 
COIN: "You say in your article he spiraled down to 1,0,000 feet." 
PEARSON: *That's right, in order to get his engine started. The atmosphere 
at 70,000 feet is so rarefied that you can't do anything with it, and dawn lower you 
can get started, but at that point he WO shot. Now the question is, why is the 
testimony different from what we believe to be the facts?" 
CAVIN: "Well, couldn't that possibly be the effect of the RussianS' questioning 
and whatever they have done to Francis Gary Powers eince he's been in their hands?' 
PEARSON: *Yes, that is definitely my opinion. I think they treated him with 
great skill, I don't believe that he was brainwashed, as you and I usually think 
of the -word brain-washed, but his defense attorney, who was an able defense attorney' 
undoubtedly got in there with him, and quite rightly told him that if he testified 
along certain lines, he would be dealt with more leniently. 
"And the very important thing is that the Russians didn't want anyone to know 
that they had a plane--that an enemy or a potential enemy rather, or any foreign 
country is a better way to put it, could fly over their country and not be shot at, 
and I think that's the reason for his testimony." 
GAVIN: "Well, new, Drew, you brought out a very interesting point also, which 
we have beard some facts on, and I'm interested in your interpretation. You said 
that May Day dawned perfectly, the weather on May Day was perfect, either for 
picnicking or for U-2 spying, and that the sky over Russia had to be cloudless to 
give the cameras a clear view, the upper atmosphere had to be dry so that the plane 
would not form giveaway (ton trails) (?). If the weather had not been ideal, Powers 
yould not have made that May Day flight, now weld any other flights across Russia 
have been attempted until President Eisenhower would have completed his visit to 
Russia in mid-June?Nay 2--had already been set as the day for him--the last day--

CAVINt *Now, you state that the weather was perfect, Mr. Powers took off, and 
It the SaMe time in another part of the country another plane, as a decoy, was taking 
Off, auppoiledly to lure the Russian radar and all the Russian trackers into thinking 
that this was Powers. Would you give us a few facts on that?" 
PARSON: "Well, the other plane took off from--1 think it was Adana--at least 
it WAS along the Turkish border--and flew toward Pakistan from Irene along the Iranian-
Pakistan border. The reason for that, as you've indicated, was that the emerican 
bases in Turkey could communicate with Powers and the Russians would think-ewe hoped 
they would think we were communicating with the weather plane. The weather plane was 
not violating Russian territory; we fly- those all the time. 
"However, in this particular case, we did not know that the Russian were wise 
to what had happened, and they had sighted a previoun plane about April 1--" 
GAVIN: "A 1)471 
PEARSON: "A U-2," 
GAVIN.: "Which had also gone deep into the interior of Russia?" 
PEARSON: "Which had gone deep into the interior of Russia, and they were com-
pletely aware that this plane on May 1 was coming, and they were waiting for it. They 
were waiting for it for a couple of reasons. One was the reason I just mentioned, 
that this other plane had come along on the first of April. The other was that they 
knew that we were worried about these very important bases of theirs in Central 
Russia, around the Caucasus, where they have their bie missile bases, they are Benue 
facturing some of their biggest rocket projects, and obviously that's what we need 
to see." 
GAVIN: 'Una this all goes right into the story which Allen Dulles, the Director 
of CIA, made last night when he spoke before members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
Mr. Dulles said that the Kremlin is jealously guarding the physical areas of the 
Soviet Union where it is building up in secrecy its formidable military weapons. 
Dulles declared that the Russians have repeatedly refused to accept a meaningful form 
of inspection, the best guarantee that disarmament can be honest, and Dulles then 
charged that Russia believes it is free to prepare in relative security for its 
spying on, their bases inside, and that this is our only method of getting pictures 
--aerial pictures--right?" 
PEARSON: "That was the only method we had, and unfortunately the most tragic 
aftermath of all this is that we now don't know what is going on inside Russia., and 
we do know--we have pretty good reason to believe that they are transferring these 
bases to other parts of Russia, and even have some of their missiles on railroad care 
so they can be transferred in a hurry." 
CAV1Nt *Drew, you made another point, when Mr. Powers was actually captured, 
some of the material that be had with him, including a hypodermic syringe with poison 
which killed a Russian dog in 30 seconds, was found, and there is a question in ley 
Mind after reading your article, written with Jack Anderson, as to why Francis Geer 
Powers didn't uSe the hypodemic needle, because, as you point out, &moms who works 
for Lockheed but reports to CIA, and one is in a position sore of a pilot than a 
app.-didn't necessarily balm to pledge that he would dispose of himself if be were 
caught, but he can't expect government backup if he is caught."

PEARSONt "Quite right. Well, the reason apparently that he didn't ow that 
needle was that, in the first place, he had instructions that if he was caught, he 
should tell the truth. The reason for those instructions is very simple, that if a 
man is captured, well, with modern methods of brainwashing and so on, there isn't 
anything that you can do to prevent some kind of a story coming out, and usually 
it's a cook and bull story if you're under torture. Now, he probably didn't have 
time to use that needle and perhaps he never would have used it--I don't know. 
*There have been some theories that somebody got to Powers--that the Russians 
got to him before he left Turkey--I don't believe that. The lir Force doesn't 
believe it. I think he's--was a guy who was doing his best, he was just an ordinary 
guy--" 
CAV1/1: "And he decided he wanted to live." 
PEARSON: "And decided he wanted to live, right." 
CIVINt "Well, the final paragraph of the Pearson-Anderson article on what 
really happened to Francis Gary Powers on this fateful U-2 flight, concludest 
'Whatever the solution, the age of satellite spying will come, but will it come 
soon enough? The hope is that it will arrive before the U-2 pictures, which we al-
ready have in our po3session? of Russia, are too far out of date. Otherwise, an even 
worse tragedy may result from our May Day disaster.' 
"Drew, that's food for thought, and we hope that everybody gets TRUE magazine 
this September and checks through the details which we haven't had time to cover. 
Congratulations on an awfully good story, and one final question, Mr. Pearson. Any 
truth to the rumor that you are currently working with NBC on a special film project?" 
PARSON: "Tea, I've been working very, very hard out of the city for that 
purpose, and doing a one-hour documentary as part of the public service program of 
NBC on the history and current work of the Quakers, and I hope and believe that it 
will be a wonderful film."

Reportage on Conference 
Moscow, Soviet Home Service, Sept. 6, 1960, 1300 GMT--L (UNCLASSIFIED) 
(Report on the press conference given by two former employees of the 
National Security Agency) 
(Text) Long before the beginning of the press conference in the marble 
hall of the Central House of Journalists numerous representatives of the 
Soviet and foreign press assembled and also radio and televiaion 
representatives. What was the topic of the press conferenceV This 
question interested everyone without exception. 
An answer to the question was given by the head of the press department 
of the USSR Foreign Ministry, Kbarlamov, who opened the press conference., 
(Kharlamov recorded statement): Gentlemen, comrades. As you know, in 
the press of the United States, Britain, and other countries at the 
beginning of August a report was published by the U.S. Defense Department 
concerning the disappearance of two workers of the U.S. National Security 
Agency. Ths, report mentioned in particular that the FBI and civil 
police organizations had begun searching for two employees of the 
supersecret National Security Agency who disappeared at the end of June. 
It was also reported that these workers were Bernon Mitchell and William 
Martin, who for a considerable time worked in the National Security Agency 
of the United States. 
The workers of the National Security Agency who disappeared are now 
in Moscow and have requested that they be allowed to appear at a 
press conference for Soviet and foreign jourraliets. Mitchell and 
Martin have decided to break with the United States and for political 
reasons to ask for political asylum from the Soviet Government. 
The Soviet Government has granted Mitchell and Martin the right 
of political asylum. The Soviet Government has complied with the 
request of Mitchell and Martin concerning the adoption of Soviet 
citizenship, and they are now Soviet citizens with full rights. Allow 
me to present to-you William Martin and Bernon Mitchell. 
Interpreter: Bernon Mitchell wishes to rend to those present a joint 
statement left by them in a bank in the town of Laurel in the United States. 
Mitchell: We ought to explain to relatives, friends, and mothers who may 
be interested why we sought citizenship in the Soviet Union. Since 
going to work for the National Security agency in thesummer of 1957 
we have learned that the U.S. Government knowingly makes false and 
deceptive statements both in defending its own actions and in 
condemning the actions of other nations

(Text) A press conference for Soviet and foreign newsmen was given in 
Moscow Sept. 6. Press statements were made there by the former employees

and William Martin, who also read a copy of the statement they left behind

the full texts of these statements. 
The parting statement of Martin and Mitchell: June 22, 1960, a parting 
statement. We hope to explain to our relatives, friends, and others who 
may be interested, why we have sought citizenship in the Soviet Union. ' 
Since going to work for the National Security Agency in the summer of 
1957, we have learned that the U.S. Government knowingly makes false 
and deceptive statements both in defending its own actions and in condemninc 
the actions of other nations. We also learned that the U.S. Government 
sometimes secretly manipulates money and military supplies in an effort 
to bring about. the overthrow of governments which are felt to be unfriendl 
to the United States.

Finally, an instance came to our attention where the U.S. Government 
gave money to a code clerk working in the Washington embassy of a 
U.S. ally for supplying information which assisted in the decryption 
of that ally's coded messages. These activities indicate to us that the 
U.S. Government is as unscrupulous as it has accused the Soviet Government 
of being. 
Many people working in the Department of Defense and in the intelligence 
agencies of the U.S. GovernMent know the truth of What We have asserted. 
However, if anyone were to Verify any portion of it without official 
permission he would be subje'ct to heavy penalties. 
The recent U-2 incident had nothing to do with our decision to defect, 
for this decision was made more than a year ago. The U-2 incident was 
merely an instance where the truth was too obvious to be permanently 
suppressed or altered. 
In making these revelations we are not seeking excuses for our action. 
Neither do we wish to discourage the American people. There are 
individuals of great integrity and resourcefulness in America who, if 
given a chance, can rectify some of the tragic acts of the U.S. Government 
in recent years. 
Besides the disillusionment and concern which we have voiced over 
certain U.S. policies, other factors have strongly motivated us to go to 
the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, our main values and interests 
appear to be shared by a greater number of people. Consequently, we 
feel that there we will be better accepted socially, and will be better 
able to carry out our professional activities. Another motivating 
factor is that the talents of women are encouraged and utilized to a much 
greater extent in the Soviet Union than in the United States. We feel 
that this enriches Soviet society and makes;Soviet women more desirable 
as mates. 
What are the important issues which divide the people of the United States 
and the Soviet Union? One cannot argue convincingly that the Soviets 
are evil because they have corrupted Christian virtue. If most Soviet 
citizens do not accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior, that is 
their business. 
The important issues, we believe, concern which economic and political 
practices best serve the interests of mankind. A disadvantage of 
capitalist society is that its science and technology cause needless 
human suffering by contributing to technological unemployment. It is 
no wonder that so many people in America feel resentful toward 
intellectual and creative activities.

Sept. 6, 1960 
We hope to beeome scientific workers in the Soviet Union, and we 
believe that we will be able to engage in scientific investigations 
there without roar of contributing to the economic hardships of others. 
Some people in the United States who are er)osed to communism have 
advocated a preventive war with the Soviet Union. They seek a kind of 
security which involves the annihilation of people with views opposed 
to thelr awn, Such a war would at best leave them emperors over the 
graveyard of civilization. 
Rather than devoting their energies to the development of newer and more 
powerful means of destruction, we hope that both the United States and 
the Soviet Union will divert their efforts toward competition in the 
ideological arena. 
One means of achieving this would be to widely publish in both countries, 
in mutually agreed-upon volume, unedited debates about economic and 
political theory and practice. It is difficult to appreciate one's own 
propaganda without having listened to the propaganda of others. As a 
means of increasing mutual understanding, we feel that the exchanges 
already under way between the two countries of cultural,scientific,and New 
industrial delegations should be continued and expanded. 
This statement has been made without consulting with the government of 
the Soviet Union. The reasons for this are that we feel that we owe 
the Amorican people an explanation in such a way that it cannot be 
construed later as a propaganda statement inspired by the government 
of the nation in which we have asked to be allowed to make our homes.

political asylum.

Sept. 6, 1960 
Reports in the American press indicate that U.S. authorities gained 
access to the safety deposit box and found our statement. But they did 
no.k., fulfill our request to publish it. We can explain this only by 
assuming that the Eisenhower-Nixon administration does not wish certain 
aspect of its policies to become known to the American people. 
At this press conference, which has been arranged at our request, we would 
like to explain, especially to the American public* our reasons for leaving 
the United States. de were emj?loyeen of the highly secret National 
Security Agency, which gathers dotmuactitions intelligence from almost 
all nations of the world for udd by the U.S. Government. However, the 
simple fact that the "united States is engaged in delving into the secrets 
of other nations had little or nothing to do with our decision to defect. 
Our main dissatisfaction concerned some of the practices the United States 
uses in gathering intelligence information. We were worried about the U.S. 
policy of deliberately violating the airspace of other nations, and,thet 
U.S. governmentts practice of lying about such violations in a manner 
intended to mislead public opinion. Furthermore, we were disenchanted 
by the U.S. Governmentts practice of intercepting and deciphering the 
secret communications of its own allies. Finally, we objected to the 
fact that the U.S. Government was willing to go so far as to recruit 
agents from among the personnel of its allies. An instance of this 
'practice, involving payment to a code clerk of a U.S. ally, was mentioned 
- in our first statement. 
At 
At this time we would like to Make some general comments relative to 
our reasons for leaving the United States. Before joining the National 
Security Agency, we had a high degree of confidence in the honesty of the 
U.S. Government, and we considered ourselves to be loyal supporters of 
the American way of life. But-the policies mentioned above, which have 
been. carried out by the U.S. Government.in recent years, raised serious 
doubts in our minds as to whether the causes these policies are intended 
Lo support are actually worthwhile. It was a difficult and painful 
e2,Terience. to laue our native country, families, and friends. Yet, 
we felt that the U.S. Government, in carrying out policies dangerous to 
'world peace, should not be allowed to rely upon these emotional attachments 
to guarantee the loyalty of its citizens. 
In the statement which we left in the United States, we expressed the 
opinion that a preventive war would be futile. It should be evident 
that those who contemplate unleashing wars constitute a grave threat to 
humanity. Should another world war occur, there would probably be no 
further opportunity to build communism, capitalism, or any other form of 
society.

However, some people in the United States disagree on this matter. For 
instance, Gen. Thomas Power, commander in chief of the U.S. Strategic 
Air Command, made the following statement, which was published in the 
United States in testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives 
Committee on appropriations during debate on the 1959-1960 military 
budget. He said: I would like to leave the deterrent role for a moment 
and talk about the philosophy of initiation of a war and the tremendous 
advantages that accrue to the man who starts a war... (PASS ellipsis). 
You always have a capability to strike fist, because obviously if these 
people thought we never could start a war, why, then they could just take 
this world, away from us by piece, because they would know that as long 
as they do not strike as, we could never do anything about it. 
General Power's statemett involves the dangerous presnuption that the 
United States owns the worldl.and implies that emulation of the Soviet 
Union represents taking something away from the United States. His 
proposal to strike first in an attempt to prevent the trend toward 
socialism sounds to us like a more suicidal thaneeffective policy. 
Senator Barry Goldwater, chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign 
Committee, made a speech in Chicago on the eve of the Republican 
National Convention, in which he said, we must not agree to a further 
ban on nuclear testing, nor disarmament in the near future. In this 
same speech he also said: To our undying national shame, there are among 
us those who would prefer to crawl on their bellies to Moscow, rather than 
to face the possibility of an atomic war. 
We do not hesitate to include ourselves in the company mentioned by Senator 
Goldwater. In fact, we would attempt to crawl to the moon if we thought 
it would lessen the threat of an atomic war. General Power and Senator 
Goldwater occupy important posts in American society, but we do not 
believe that they reflect the attitude of the majority of the American 
people 
After the U-2 incident, the U.S. Government admitted .its? policy Of 
deliberately violating the airspace of the Soviet Union. U.S. 
officials, particularly Vice President Nixon, tried to justify this 
policy by claiming that it was the only way to forestall a surprise 
attack by the USSR. Vice President Nixon did not mention that much 
of the information gathered on these flights could be useful only in an 
attempt to penetrate the ?Olefenses of the Soviet Union. In connection 
with this, the statements of General Power take on ominous meaning. 
They could forestall a surprise attack by the Soviet Union by striking 
first. It is very difficult for the Soviet Union and other nations to 
assume that General Power was only expressing his private opinion: in 
his official teatimony before congress.

Besides its attempts to contain communism in the eastern hemisphere, 
the United States recently declared that it would not tolerate communist 
influence in the western hemisphere. Perhaps U.S. hostility toward 
communism arises out of a feeling of insecurity engendered by communist 
achievements in science, culture, and industry. If this is so, such 
feelings of insecurity are a poor excuse for endangering world peace. 
The ring of U.S. military bases surrounding the Soviet Union seems 
to indicate that the U.S. Government thinks it can effectively combat 
the ideas of communism by military means. If the United States and 
the Soviet Union were to improve communications between their peoples, 
perhaps there would not be so,.much antagonism, and conditions might be 
created which would make possible a large-scale diversion of military 
funds to peaceful purposes. 
Let us now consider the aerial intelligence policies of the U.S. 
Government. Our first acquaintance with these policies was during 
the time that we served with the U.S. Navy, from 1951 to 1954. We 
both served as communications technicians at several U.S. Naval 
radio intercept stations during this period. The U.S. Government has 
recently admitted carrying out intelligence flights around and over 
the borders of communist nations, but only during the last four years. 
However, we would like to state that these flights were also being 
conducted in the period 1952-1954 when we were serving at a U.S. Naval 
radio intercept station at Kami-seya, Japan, near Yokohama. In 
advance of a reconnaissance flight of a U.S. military plane along the 
Chinese or Soviet far eastern borders, a top secret message would be 
sent to Kami-seya and other communications intelligence stations, 
informing them as to the flight time and the course of the plane. 
At the designated flight time, monitors at these stations would tune in 
on the frequencies used by radar reporting stations of the target 
country, that is the Soviet Union or Communist China. At the same 
time, radio direction-finders would tune in on these frequencies to seek 
out the locations of the radar reporting stations. Information 
gathered in this manner would then be forwarded to the National Security 
Agency. There, analysts study the communications and code systems used 
by the radar stations. The National Security Agency is then able to 
estimate the degree of alertness, accuracy, and efficiency of the radar 
defenses of the target nation, and it is also able to collect information 
about the organization of command within the target nation's internal 
defense system. 
After going to work for the National Security Agency, we learned about 
another type of aerial intelligence mission which involves incursion 
into the airspace of the target nation. These missions, known as 
elint missions (electronics intelligence--TASS) consist of flights in the

immediate proximity of radar Installations of the Soviet Union and 
other countries to obtain data about the physical nature of radiations 
from radar transmitters. This information is used in an attempt to 
find ways to render the radar defense system ineffective, for instance 
through the use of radar-jamming devices operating from bases close to 
the Soviet borders. Flights of U.S. planes along and over the borders 
of the Soviet Union are routine operations and the number of such 
flights is far greater than is generally supposed by the U.S. public. 
In order to clarify the nature of such flights, we would like to discuss 
one of them in detail. 
In September, 1958, a U.S. C-130 plane flew over the Turkish border 
into Soviet Armenia. This plane never returned. The U.S. Government, 
as it invariably does in such cases, issued a cover story claiming that 
the plane was engaged only in gathering scientific information and 
that the crossing of the Soviet border was accidental. The United States 
claimed that the 0-130 had been shot down over Soviet territory without 
provocation. The Soviets confined itself to a statement that the 
plane had crashed. 
In February, 1959 the State Department relased a recording in Russian 
which it claimed substantiated its contention that the 0-130 had been 
shot down inside the Soviet Union. However, the State Department said 
nothing about the actual reason that this plane was flying over the 
Soviet Union. 
In connection with this incident, we would like to make the following 
comments. 
Late in the afternoon of the same day that the State Department released 
the above recording, Lt. Gen, John Samford, director of the National 
Security Agency, speaking on the NSA internal broadmasting system, 
suggested that NSA personnel refrain from discussion of any questions 
pertaining to the 0-130 flight. It is clear that if the 0-130 had 
really flown with the sole intent of gathering scientific information 
NSA -would have had nothing to conceal. 
Despite General Samford's suggestion, NSA employees did discuss among 
themselves the possible far-re.ac.hing c(mnequences of the 0-130 incident 
for the United States. A high official of NSA told William Martin that 
this particular C-130 plane was carrying electronics specialists and 
special equipment for receiving at close range the signals of Soviet 
radar transmitters. This official added that the Turkish-Armenian 
border had been dniberately crossed in order to get into the immediate 
proximity of Soviet radar installations.

It should be clear even to a layman that information about radar defenses 
has no bearing whatsoever on the problem of ascertaining whether or not 
the Soviet Union is preparing for a surprise attack. This information 
can be utilized only for the purpose of determining the defense potential 
of the Soviet Union. 
Meanwhile, various U.S. officials condemned the Soviet Union for allegedly 
shooting down the 0-130 without sufficient leason. Hubert Humphrey 
said in effect that the Soviet Union should not have shot down the 
0-130 and should refrain from molesting U.S. planes in the futute. His 
arguments assumed that the State Department's statements regarding the 
incident were truthful and that the United States was the injured and 
innocent party. 
Thinking that Senator Humphrey and perhaps most members of Congress were 
ignorant of the facts, we decided to speak privately with a congressman 
and see if this was the case. In February, 1959, we obtained an 
appointment with a congressman who had publicly expressed concern over 
the State Department's concealing from congress pertinent facts about 
the 0-130 incident. During this appointment, we discussed the statements 
of Hubert Humphrey and commented on the failure of the executive branch 
to keep Congress correctly informed. We explained to him the nature of 
the C-130 intelligence mission) and indicated that we felt such 
violations of the airspace of other nations were dangerous to world 
peace. 
Our conversation was interrupted when the congressman received a 
telephone call from the Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional 
Relations, Mr. William Macomber, who requested him to refrain from 
further public discussion of the 0-130 incident. Again, it is clear 
that if this plane had been engaged solely in gathering scientific 
information) the State Department would have had no reason to be concerned. 
Further corroboration that the United States has a policy of conducting 
overflights was obtained when a high official of NSA told Bernon 
Mitchell that the United States had intentionally violated the Chinese 
communist borders on aerial intelligence missions. 
We hope that the American public will bring pressure to bear against 
the U.S. Government's policy of violating the airspace of other nations. 
A single incident or misinterpretation concerning the purpose of planes 
involved in these flights could be the cause of war. 
It is difficult to understand how U.S. officials can maintain an attitude 
of indignation when the Soviet Union takes defensive action against 
U.S. planes flying over its terlitory.

The Soviet Government has shown great forbearance with respect to these 
flights, and has repeatedly called upon the U.S. Government to ce4se them. 
Mbreover, so far as we know, the Soviet Government has refrained from 
making any retaliatory flights around and over the United States. 
We have purposefully stressed in detail the intelligence flights of 
American planes over the territory of the Soviet Union and other countries 
because this practice might be the cause of a great catastrophe. 
The connection of the National Security Agency with aerial intelligence 
missions has already been described Now, -in order to give a bet or
perspective of NSA, we would like to add the following details. 
Some information concerning NSA's activities is given in the book 
"Central Intelligence and National Security" (Harvard University Press, 
1958--TASS). The author correctly states: The NSA specializes in 
communications intelligence. It operates as a semiautonomous agency 
of the Department of Defense, under the supervision of the Secretary of 
Defense's Office of Special Operations. In addition to maintaining its 
own professional staff for technical operations, NSA exercises broad 
supervision overioand coordination of, the Army Security Agency and 
similar communications intelligence groups within the Navy and Air Force. 
Further, Ransom states: ...(TASS ellipsis) NSA plays a major, if 
unobtrusive, role in the national intelligence community...(TASS ellipsis) 
at any rate, through the National Security Agency and related units, the 
American Government is again engaged in communications intelligence on a 
world-wide scale. 
NSA headquarters is located at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland, about 
25 miles north of Washington, D.C. The NSA building at Fort Meade is 
second in size only to the Pentagon among U.S. Government buildings. 
Approximately 10,000 people work there, under the direction of Air Force 
Lt. Gen. John A. Samford. About 100 million dollars a year are spent 
to maintain the NSA headqnarters at Fort Meade, the basement of which 
contains a large number of electronic computers. The network of radio 
intercept stations which supply information to NSA extends throughout 
the world and keeps in continuolls operation more than 2,000 manual iLtercept 
positions, which are staffed by more than 8,000 arMe3 :forces intercept 
operators. A smaller number of additional peroonnel operate eqgdrment 
for the interception of radioteletype transmissions.

Some intercept units are located on ships and planes, but most of the 
intercept activity is carried out at U.S. military radio stations located 
in foreign countri08. Both enciphered and plain-text communications are 
monitored from almost every nation in the world, including the nations 
on whose soil these intercept bases are located. 
To maintain this extensive network of intercept stations and to forward 
intercept material to NSA headquarters costs about 380 million dollars a 
year. Thus, including the cost of operating NSA headquarters, the 
United States spends almost half a billion dollars a year for 
communications intelligence. 
NSA headquarters is subdivided into four main offices: 1) the office of 
production (PROD), 2) the office of research and development (R/D), 3) the 
office of communications security (COMSEC), and 4) the office of security 
(SEC). The major functions of PROD are to receive intercept material 
from the stations, to perform cryptoanalysis and traffic analysis, and to 
analyze the resulting information. R/D carries out research in the fields 
of cryptoanalysis, digital computing and radio propagation, and carries 
out the development of new communications equipment. COMSEC is responsible 
for the production and security of U.S. cipher systems,, SEC conducts 
low investigations of NSA personnel, gives lie detector tests, and passes on 
the loyalty and integrity of NSA personnel. 
Major subdivisions within PROD and R/D are as follows: 
PROD 
1--ADVA: Studies high level Soviet cipher systems and diplomatic codes. 
2---GENS: Studies Soviet military code systems and medium level cipher 
system. 
3--ACOM: Studies the code and cipher systems of Asian communist nations. 
4--ALLO: Studies the code and cipher systems of U.S. allies, neutral 
nations, and some communist nations. 
5--MPRO: Provides electronic digital computing and data processing services 
to other divisions of NSA. 
R/D 
1--REMP: Conducts crylAoanalytical research and works on applied 
cryptoanalytic problems without restriction as to country, provides 
consulting services to other divisions of USA, and carries out research 
Awe in computer componentry.

3--8TED: Studies possible weakness of cipher machines in general, 
assists CONSEC in the design of cipher machines for U.S. use, and studies 
the process of enciphering speech. 
Successes obtained by the National Security Agency in reading the code 
and cipher systems of ether nations are due primarily to the skillfulness 
of cryptoanalysts, frequently aided by electronic digital computers. 
However, success in at least one case has also been faciliteted by the 
fact that the U.S. supplied to other nations cipher machines for 
which it knew the construction and wiring of the motors. As we have 
said before, the success, concqrning one of the U.S. allies, was aided 
by the fact that the United States paid money to a code clerk of that 
country for his information, 
The National Security Agency includes a special group, the United Kingdom 
Liason Office (MO), which is staffed by British citizens. 
Likewise, in the British communications intelligence organization 
called GCHQ, there is a corresponding NSA liason group. Britain and 
the United States exchange information as to cryptoanalytic methods 
and resalts in reading the code systems of other nations, and their 
respective networks of radio intercept stattons supplement Qte another. 
Besides the United Kingdom: the United States mdlintains close cooperation 
with Ccnada in the field of communications intelligence. As we know 
from our previous experience in working at NSA, the United States 
successfully reads the secret communications of core than forty nations, 
including its own a114es. Besides what we have said above, other factors 
in our decision to defect were the suppression of informatinn, 
restraints on the freedom of expression and political activity, and 
the discrimination against people who are not theists.which exithts in the 
United States. 
For instance: accordIng to U.S, press reports, the federal government 
each year confiscates 50 million pieces of mail entering the United 
States, frequently without notifying the addressees that nay seizure 
has taken place. In the State of Marylnnd, where we lived, in order 
to hold any post whatsoever with the state government it is necessary to 
take an oath to the effect that one is a theist. People whose political 
convictions are unpopular with those who determine U.S. policy are frequently 
called before investigating committees, harassed, fined, imprisoned, 
and denied jobs.

Victims of this practice have won some court battles, but the State

and in addition the Soviet Government has offered us the choice of

of continuing our education and assistance in finding jobs in our

Honorable Franc Le E. Walter 
House of Representatives 
Washington 25 D. C. 
Dear Francis: 
I have given a great deal of thought to your letter of 
2 September 1960. 
One purpose of ray telephone call to you on 2 September, 
was to thank you for inserting in the Congressional Record the full 
text of my address before the Veterans of Foreign Wars at Detroit 
on 22 August 1960. 
Another purpose was to call attention to an AP report of a 
statement which you made to the press on 1 September, and which 
was widely circulated throughout the country, that "The FBI gave 
the CIA certain information which certainly should have deterred 
the hiring of at least one of those two men," referring to the two 
NSA defectors. The AP added "He declined to amplify." 
I feel sure that this statement was made on the basis of a 
misunderstanding since it has no basis in fact. No such Information 
was given to the CIA by the FBI, or by anyone else, and there was no 
particular reason why it should have been so given since the question 
of the screening of these two men for employment by NSA was not a 
matter over which the CIA had jurisdiction or responsibility.

Subsequentlyon September 7, 1960 Department of 
Justice gave out the following statement: 
"Reports that the FBI had furnished unfavorable 
Information to the Department of Defense of Mitchell 
and Martin prior to its employment of them are erro-
neous. The pre-employment investigation of these men 
was conducted by the Department of Defense and not by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In response to the 
normal inquiry made by the Department of Defense in the 
course of its investigation, the FBI reported that it had no 
information in its files concerning these men. 
In my telephone call to you, I also expressed regret that your 
statement was tied in closely to another statement attributed to you 
by the Associated Press that "The CIA will be the first target of 
inquiry." 
I sincerely hope that you will find occasion to correct the record 
as regards the prior furnishing of information to this Agency about the 
NSA defectors. 
I should welcome an opportunity to discuss with you certain 
other comments in your letter, rather than attempt to deal with them 
by correspondence. You and I have had many good talks together, and 
since we have both spent many years of our lives in trying to expose and 
defeat the subversive communist menace, it is unfortunate there should 
be the misunderstanding which your letter indicates. 
There is one further point, however, that I would wish to clarify. 
This relates to the statement in your letter regarding CIA'reluctance 
to convey to the Congress any information regarding its personnel, as 
well as its activities in the field of national security. . . 
The Congress itself has set up, in the Senate and the House, 
subcommittees of the Appropriations Committees and of the Armed 
Services Committees, for CIA matters. We have appeared many times 
before these committees and certain other committees to which we have 
responsibilities, such as the Joint Atomic Energy Committee. In 1959

8 such appearances and so far in 1960 16 appearances. 
orrnly responded to requests from these committees, 
Imes I have taken the initiative in asking the committees 
to hear me, I do not recall a single instance during appearances before 
these committees when we have failed to answer fully and frankly their 
questions with respect to CIA activities. I feel sure that if you would 
inquire of Representative Cannon or Representative Kilday, the re-
spective chairmen of the two subcommittees I have mentioned, they 
would beer out what I have said. 
Certainly I agree with you that there can be no monopoly what-
soever in the mobilization and deployment of the resources of the 
country in meeting the Communist menace. In my speech at Detroit, 
which I gather you viewed favorably, I tried to emphasize this view-
point and the need for a far broader understanding by the country of 
the grave issues which face us.

HOLD FOR RELEASE UPON INTRODUCTION OF RESOLUTION 
COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES 
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
Congressman Francis E. Walter (D-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on 
Un-American Activities today introduced a resolution in the House of Repre-
sentatives calling for a full and complete study of each intelligence agency 
of the United States. 
Commenting on his resolution, Congressman Walter stated, "I have long 
felt that the Congress of the United States should be more fully informed 
respecting the several intelligence agencies of the Government which are 
vital in the life-and-death struggle in which we are engaged with the interna-
tional Communist conspiracy. 
"While I believe that the Committee on Un-American Activities presently 
has jurisdiction and the authority to conduct the study which I propose, 
because of the nature of the subject matter and also to avoid any questions 
of possible partial overlapping in jurisdiction with other committees, I feel 
that it is sound practice for me to submit a resolution to the House in which 
the Committee on Un-American Activities is specifically directed to make this 
study. 
"I want to point out that the resolution requires that extreme caution 
be taken in order to avoid any possible disclosure of confidential information 
or of techniques employed by our intelligence agencies. 
"Is there duplication or conflict in the powers, jurisdictions and 
functioning of our intelligence agencies? Are there areas in which there 
should be either an extended activity or a withdrawal of activity by these 
agencies? How can their efficiency be improved? Is the information acquired 
adequately safeguarded from unauthorized disclosures? Is this information 
made available for maximum practicable utilization by policy-making agencies 
of the Government? 
"These and other questions ought to be carefully and judiciously explored 
by the representatives of the people. In my judgment, the Committee on 
Un-American Activities is specially equipped to make this study and I 
accordingly expect to press for early approval by the House of my resolution." 
The resolution reads as follows: 
RESOLUTION 
"To authorize the Committee on Un-American Activities 
to conduct a full and complete study of each 
intelligence agency of the United States. 
AppritemsVettReditaiet209VINaltgAclingiNiaaNii0MKGRZW-lacting as

-2-
and complete study of each intelligence agency of the United States 
in order to analyze the organization and operation of each such agency 
for the purpose of determining the efficiency of such organization and 
operation and to determine whether such efficiency can be improved 
through elimination of duplicate activities and functions, or in any 
other manner. As used in this resolution, the term 'intelligence agency 
of the United States' means any executive department or agency of the 
United States conducting intelligence activities and any unit within 
any executive department or agency of the United States conducting 
intelligence activities. 
"In the conduct of the study authorized by this resolution, the 
committee or subcommittee shall exercise extreme caution so as not 
to reveal any information with respect to the organization or methods 
of operation of any intelligence agency of the United States, or any 
other information, the revelation of which may impair the continued 
effectiveness of the operations of such agency or may be detrimental 
to the security of the United States. 
"For the purpose of carrying out this resolution the committee 
or subcommittee is authorized to sit and act during the present Congress 
at such times and places within the United States, including any Common-
wealth or possession thereof, or elsewhere, whether the House is in 
session, has recessed, or has adjourned, to hold such hearings, and to 
require, by subpena or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such 
witnesses and the production of such books, records, correspondence, 
memoranda, papers, and documents, as it deems necessary; except that 
neither the committee nor any subcommittee thereof may sit while the 
House is meeting unless special leave to sit shall have been obtained 
from the House. Subpenas may be issued under the signature of the 
chairman of the committee or any member of the committee designated 
by him, and may be served by any person designated by such chairman 
or member. 
"The committee shall submit a progress report to the House as soon 
as practicable during the present Congress, together with such conclusions 
and recommendations as it deems advisable. Any such report which is 
made when the House is not in session shall be filed with the Clerk of 
the House."

Inquiry Set 
Vinson Committee 
Acts as Walter 
Schedules Hearing 
By John G. Norris 
Sports Reporter 
Chairman Carl Vinson 
(D-Ga.) of the House Armed 
Services Committee named 
a three-man special subcom-
mittee yesterday to conduct 
a "complete investigation" 
of Government intelligence 
agencies. 
Stressing that his Commit-
tee has jurisdiction over the 
Pentagon's intelligence units 
and the Central Intelligence 
Agency, Vinson seemed to be 
suggesting to the House Un-
American Activities Commit-
tee that it stay 0.14 of the case 
of the two National Security 
Agency defectors. 
Chairman Francis E. Wal-
ter (D-Pa.) of the Un-American 
Activities group, already has 
announced plans to call NSA 
officials Sept. 16 for question-
ing about the defectors. 
President Eisenhower, com-
menting on the incident, said 
it means that the Administra-
tion must review its "entire" 
security procedures "to see if 
there is any one way we could 
better it." "We must be always 
on the alert, very alert," he 
told a news conference. 
Congressman Walter, how-
ever, told newsmen that the 
President "has made it abun-
dautly clear he doesn't want 
to cooperate" with his group 
in trying to eliminate subver-
sives from Government. He 
cited a White House refusal to 
furnish the names of many 
Federal "security risks," hold-
ing non-sensitive, non-policy-
making jobs, who were fired 
earlier hut reinstated as the 
result of a Supreme Court de-
cision. 
Administration officials pri-
vately have expressed concern 
over the possibility of a free-
wheeling House Un-American 
Activities Committee probe 
into the defection of NSA code 
clerks Bernon F. Mitchell and 
William H. Martin. They fear 
that a renewal of a McCarthy-
type loyalty investigation?
involving top secret intelli-
gence agencies this time in-
stead of the State Department 
?could do untold harm. 
Vinson's announcement that 
three veteran members of the 
House Armed Services Com-
mittee who already are privy 
to many defense secrets nd 
procedures will inves 
case was viewed as to 
conduct a "more 
and pertine 
the whole station, 
compromising vital 
secrets. 
Meanwhile, . it developed 
that the Rep. Wayne L. 'Hays 
(D-Ohio) may have been the 
Congressman Mitchell and 
'Martin said they visited 18 
months? ago to warn that the 
Unite,40*Ates "was sending 
pla Crier RusSi,a.' 
s, interviewed by tele-

that more than 1000 "security , 
risks" now hold Government 
jobs, and that President Eisen-
hower has refused since last 
January to supply their names. 
He showed neWsmen corre-
spondesice he has had with 
the White House, in which he 
has tried to obtain the names 
of all employes ? who were 
separated from the service 
under the loyalty program but 
rehired after a 1956 Supreme 
Court decision which per-
mitted the restoring of em-
ployes fired from non-sensi-
tive jabs.

correspondenceNtitter,?!: Presi-
dent Eisenhower told a news 
conference 'that no problem 
has engaged his attention over 
the years more kbanf making 
airtight the NatioYs?security 
proceedings. 
Walter said that on Feb. 19, 
1960, David W. Kendall, spe-
cial counsel to the President, 
refused his request for the 
names of those rehired after 
the 1956 decision, declaring 
that the President "has con-
cluded that it would not be in 
the national interest." 
Again on April 19, Walter 
said, the White House again 
refused to furnish the names 
on the same ground as before. 
He said that many of those 
rehired hold what he consid-
ered sensitive jobs, some in 
the Pentagon. 
In calling the persons in-
volved "security risks," Walter 
defined the term as coveri ? 
members of Communist', 
Communist front organiz* 
tions, homosexuals, alcoholics 
and persons who associate 
with known Cominunists. 
Kendall, in declining to re-
lease the names, said the dis

Of the 20 standing committees of Inc House

apt for such an undertaking; and of all the 437

to be the least qualified to direct the study. For 
one thing, this committee is a partisan in the cold 
war waged by the FBI against the CIA. For an-
other, too often it has been a hunter of heresy, 
not a student of security in the broad sense. Fresh 
evidence of this was offered by Mr. Walter's asser-

Thank you for forwarding a copy of the letter of 
Z6 Augst 1960, which you received from Mr. Wallace Taft Berry, 
complaining of an approach made to hint by a representative of 
This Agency prior to Ms visit to the Soviet Union this summer. 
I have ascertained that Mr. Berry was indeed visited in May of 
this year by a CIA representative, but that he was not requested 
to make observations in our behalf nor to secure information of 
any kind. 
directives under which we operate includes 
the duty ott obtaining within the United States from institutions and 
from private individuals who are potential sources of foreign intel-
ligence, inform.ition which might be of value to our national security. 
Accordingly, on a selective basis, our representatives do occasion-
a.Uy call upon travellers to certain areas of the world with a view to 
determining their itinerariee and capacity for observation as Li. basis 
for possible interview upon their return. Information of this kind 
obtained in the normal course of travel has provided data of sub-
stantial value, particularly in areas where access is occasional or 
limited. 
In the case of Mr. Berry, our records are clear that 
initial interview, which I have mentioned, disclosed that 
is qualifications nor his itinerary were such as to make

Questionable Timing 
ea REVELATION of Robert Berlin, s 
young Chicago business executive, that 
two years RR() he rejected s Central intelli-
gence Agency request to spy during a tour 
of Russia leaves at, least one pertinent ques-
tion imanswered 
From the evidence at nand it does not 
appear that he was exited to do anything 
very sneaking or coinplicated but only to 
make certain mental observations and submit 
a written report. But if he considered the 
activity spying, his refusal 'cannot he criti-
rtzed ?it was a matter between him and his 
conscience 
Entirely another matter. however, was his 
timing in disclosing the incident. ',Why It 
was necessary, or even artvisatbk, for him to 
mention it at all isn't clear, since he, bad 
refused the request?one. Incidentally, which 
the CIA was quite as justified in making as 
he was in declining He could have closed the 
case without the fanfare. and the puzzle is 
why he didn't. 
Mr. Berlin explained he revealed the con-
tact lust now because the U.S. Government 
has protested that some American tourists'in 
,Russia have been called spies and ejected: 
It seems inconceivable that he Intended to 
'aid the Soviet Union in any way. Yet, since 
his statement tends to uphold the Red con-
tention, It seems equally inconoelvable.that 
he should not have recognized that the prin-
cipal effect of his belated announeernent

CIA-Tourist Incident 
I am amazed that a citizen 
of the United States feels he 
is above doing something for 
his country during these 
times. Robert Berlin report-
ed that he was asked by the 
CIA to ''keep his eyes open" 
while on a tour in Russia. 
He knows the record of Rus-
lana entering our country. 
The Russian feels honored to 
so serve his , country. But 
apparently Mr. Berlin feels 
his citizenship does not and 
should not make any ,de-
mands on him. We are at 
war?the most vicious type 
ever devised by a group of 
men little if any above ani-
mals. It is time every citi-
zen feels It is an honor and a 
cluty to help his country in 
every way he can by "keep-
ing his eyes open" every-
where he goes, and pass any 
helpful bits along to the right 
authorities. Some great man 
has said?"When we are at 
peace we have privileges anti 
responsibilities: when we are 
at war we have only responsi-
bilities." According to Mr. 
Berlin, Le was not asked to 
spy in the real meaning of 
that word, but to "keep his 
isms open." In other ?words, 
he was asked to observe life 
In the USSR. '

He sbowed credentials stat-

Berlin said that the caller 
"asked me if I would con-
sider making certain mental 
observations while I was 
traveling in Russia, and he 
asked if I would submit a 
copy of my itinerary for the 
trip." ToUrists, the man told 
hint, often were better at tic-
qUirint 'information than 
trained agents. 
After a daY.to think it ovgr, 
Berlin said, he decided 
against accepting the sisal 
merit for several reasons, 
the main one being the risk 
involved. He said he told the 
agent that he did not feel it 
was right for a tourist to spy. 
Berlin said the miltterwas 
not preksed and he neve 
heard from the. roan again.
