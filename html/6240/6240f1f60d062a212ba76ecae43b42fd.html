 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 SINO-SOVIET TACTICS ON EAST-WEST ISSUES    .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 In his letters of 5 August to the three Western
 headsof government, Khrushchev no longer called for
 an immediate five-power summit conference on the Mid-
 dle East but demanded that this problem be considered
 by a special session of the UN General Assembly as
 soon as possible.  He sought, however, to offset any
 negative free world reaction by reaffirming his desire
 for summit talks on general East-West problems, as first
 proposed last December.  This shift in tactics prob-
 ably reflects Khrushchev's recognition of the failure
 of Soviet efforts to force the United States and Brit-
 ain to accept Moscow's terms for five-power talks on
 Lebanon and Jordan and his desire for an immediate
 world forum in which to denounce American and British
 actions in the Middle East before the crisis atmos-
 phere dissipates further.
 The Chinese Communists had endorsed Khrushchev's
 call for "big-power" summit talks on the Middle East
 in the communique of 3 August following the Khrushchev-
 Mao talks in Peiping.  Khrushchev, however, apparent-
 ly decided to drop this line after studying the latest
 British and American notes.  The Chinese Communists on
 6 August promptly supported his new proposals for a Gen-
 eral Assembly session and a summit conference on general
 world problems.
 Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung probably coordinated
 Sino-Soviet policy on general East-West issues and dis-
 cussed intrabloc problems.  Peiping is maintaining pres-
 sure on the Chinese Nationalists by moving air units in-
 to Fukien Province opposite Taiwan.  Any Nationalist
 counteraction could be used by the Communists as grounds
 for insisting on the inclusion of the Taiwan issue on
 the agenda of any future summit conference.  The Chinese
 Communists, however, are unlikely to start major hos-
 tilities in the near future, although there is a pos-
 sibility of serious air clashes in the area.

 PART I (continued)
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS .  . .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  Page  5
 The Lebanese opposition is still using terrorism
 and minor military harassment to press for the immediate
 resignation of President Chamoun and his pro-Western
 cabinet and for the withdrawal of American troops. King
 Husayn's position in Jordan is being undermined rapid-
 ly, despite increased security precautions, by deteri-
 orating economic conditions and growing sentiment that
 he should abdicate to permit a rapprochement with the
 UAR.   Iraqi leaders say they are still studying the
 question of Iraq's relation to the Baghdad Pact, but
 they probably will withdraw eventually.  Nasir is re-
 ported to be concerned over continuing problems in
 Svr is .
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 GENEVA TECHNICAL TALKS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 The Soviet delegation at Geneva has outlined an in-
 spection system for detecting nuclear tests that is much
 more comprehensive and detailed than any previously sug-
 gested by the USSR but falls short of what the West de-
 sires.  Moscow appears willing to implement such a system,
 and eager to have the conferences end with a wide measure
 of agreement.   If the experts at Geneva fail to resolve
 the major points of difference, the USSR probably expects
 that its proposals appear reasonable enough to make a .
 strong impression on public opinion and to make it diffi-
 cult for the West to insist on a more effective system.

 Presidium member Averky Aristov appears to be assum-
 ing major responsibility for the direction of the party
 bureau for the Russian Republic.  The revitalization of
 the party apparatus by Khrushchev has added to the im-
 portance of the RSFSR bureau, which, through its six de-
 partments, oversees the entire range of party activities
 in the republic. Long associated with the industrial and
 agricultural development of Siberia, Aristov apparently
 holds an important but unpublicized role in the top lead-
 ership.

 PART II (continued)
 SOVIET MILITARY PERSONNEL CHANGES   .  .  .  :  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  4
 Since Marshal Malinovsky was appointed Soviet de-
 fense minister in October 1957 to replace Marshal Zhu-
 kov,                 there; have been a number of changes in military
 district and external commands,  Eleven of the 18 mil-
 itary districts have changed commanders.  Most of the
 former commanders had served at least three years in
 their posts, however, and could be considered due for
 reassignment.  During the same period headquarters per-
 sonnel remained relatively unchanged.
 PEIPING CLAIMS SPECTACULAR ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS .  .  .  .  .  Page  6
 Peiping's statistical report for the first half
 of the year shows industrial production up 34 percent
 over the same period of 1957, construction activity
 well over the previous high in 1956, and bumper early
 harvests.   The leadership professes to believe that
 these achievements are but a prelude to oven greater
 progress in the second half of the year.   It clearly
 feels this growth vindicates its "giant leap forward"
 economic policies which have been regarded as too haz-
 ardous by an unidentified "gloomy clique."
 HUNGARIAN REGIME FORCES CONDITIONAL SURRENDER OF WRITERS .  Page  7
 As a follow-up to the execution of Imre Nagy, the
 Kadar regime has intensified its efforts to force Hun-
 garian intellectuals to associate themselves with the
 regime.  The remaining leaders of the intellectual re-
 sistance--the highly respected "populist" writers--
 have decided on limited cooperation and will begin con-
 tributing to regime publications.  Concurrently, the
 government is reported to have arrested a number of
 secondary school students who allegedly had bden in-
 fluenced by the writers and had planned a demonstra-
 tion following the Nagy execution; it has also Contin-
 ued retrials of convicted "counterrevolutionaries,"
 some of whom are,intellectuals, who had previously re-
 ceived light sentences.

 FRENCH REACTION TO DE GAULLE'S DRAFT CONSTITUTION   .
 The French press and political parties are con-
 .  .  Page  9
 cerned over the increased powers of the president and
 the reduced powers of the National Assembly provided
 for under De Gaulle's draft constitution, just sub-
 mitted to a special consultative committee for review.
 The public's attitude, however,  is "let De Gaulle see
 what he can do," and the final draft--although it may
 incorporate some changes--will probably be approved by
 a large majority.
 FINNISH POLITICAL SCENE CONFUSED .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  9
 The difficulties delaying formation of a majority
 government in Finland may lead to a continuation of
 the nonpolitical caretaker government of Reino Kuuskoski,
 who, contrary. to usual practice, did not offer his res-
 ignation when parliament convened on 29 July.                             Inclu-
 sion of the Communist-front Finnish People's Democratic
 League, the largest party in parliament, is still un-
 likely.
 BOLIVIAN REGIME THREATENED BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY  .  .  .  Page 10
 The protracted rift between the left and right
 wings of the governing Nationalist Revolutionary Move-
 ment (MNR) in Bolivia may develop into open conflict
 if moderate President Siles carries out his most recent
 threat to resign.  Former President Paz, titular head
 of the party, who returned to Bolivia last May as a
 self-styled moderator, has thus far failed to reconcile
 the two hostile MNR factions.   Siles' resignation would
 weaken the US-backed stabilization program in Bolivia.
 ARMED FORCES DISAFFECTION THREATENS CUBAN GOVERNMENT .  .  .  Page 11
 Cuba's prolonged political crisis and the govern-
 ment's inability to put down the Castro rebellion in
 Oriente Province have led to an increase in disaffection
 among military personnel.

 13TH UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENCY  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page 13
 Lebanese Foreign Minister Charles Malik's position
 favoring the landing of American troops in Lebanon  has
 raised considerable doubts among UN members, particular-
 ly Latin American countries, about his suitability for
 the presidency of the 13th UN General Assembly.        Malik
 seemed assured of the office prior to the Middle East
 crisis, but now other countries are offering candidates.

 African nationalists at a regional party congress
 on 27 July demanded immediate independence, reflecting
 the growing opposition in French Tropical Africa to the
 proposed French constitutional amendments.  The slogan
 of independence is likely to have an electrifying effect
 on the Africans and may force the political pace faster
 than desired by moderate leaders, who are appreciative of
 French West Africa's economic and administrative depend-
 ence on France.

 RIVAL LEADERS IN PAKISTAN MAKE ELECTION PACT .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 16
 Some improvement in political stability in Paki-
 stan may result from the agreement reached on 3 August
 between President Mirza and his chief rival, former
 Prime Minister Subrawardy, to cooperate in Pakistan's
 first national elections, now expected to be held in
 February.  Under the pact, Mirza would appoint Suhra-
 wardy prime minister in the new government but their
 agreement will remain subject to the strains of their
 continuing competition for power and could be modified
 by changing political conditions.
 COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT IN INDIA'S KERALA STATE UNDER FIRE      Page 17
 The Communist government in Kerala State in India
 has come under increasing fire as a result of a series
 of clashes between state police and non-Communist agi-
 tators.  While Communist control in Kerala does not ap-
 pear seriously endangered, this first challenge to the
 Communist regime has strengthened and united the opposi-
 tion.  Prime Minister Nehru has thus far resisted pres-
 sure for the national government to intervene.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 LEBANESE PRESIDENT-ELECT GENERAL FUAD SHIHAB .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  4
 General Fuad Shihab, recently elected president of
 Lebanon, was born in 1903 and is a member of the Maronite
 Christian branch of one of Lebanon's leading families.
 Other Shihabs are Moslems and Druze, which may be a factor
 accentuating the general's natural tendency for compromise
 in a country in which all political matters are decided
 on a sectarian basis.   In both the 1952 disorders and the
 present crisis, Shihab has maintained a conciliatory at-
 titude-toward the antigovernment forces.  Believing that
 "Nasirism is the wave of the future," the President-elect
 probably will soon reach an accommodation with the UAR.
 TRENDS IN INDIA'S FOREIGN RELATIONS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  6
 During the past year, developments within the Sino-
 Soviet bloc have led India to adopt a more critical at-
 titude toward the Communist world.                      At the same time,
 Indo-American relations have improved.  Recent events
 in the Middle East apparently have not yet significant-
 ly altered this situation.   India is not likely to de-
 viate from its policy of nonalignment or abandon its
 opposition to defense pacts and nuclear testing; at the
 same time, India will probably retain its questioning
 attitude toward the bloc.

 PEIPING'S ATTITUDE ON POPULATION GROWTH   .  .  .       .  .  .  .  Page 11
 The Chinese Communists now proclaim that an im-
 mense population is their greatest resource and pre-
 sents no obstacle to their "giant leap forward" in
 economic development.        In late 1956 and early 1957,
 Peiping began but did not fully develop a propaganda
 campaign to popularize birth control.  This campaign
 was quietly dropped last year when the program for
 political liberalism was reversed and optimistic eco-
 nomic planning resumed.  The present policy contem-
 plates the continuation of the current population
 growth which would bring China's population from the
 present 650,000,000 to 720,000,000 in 1962 and over
 810,000.000 in 1967, and to over a billionaround
 1975.

 Khrushchev's Letters
 time for preparation of a "new
 attack on the Arab peoples."
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev
 called on 5 August for a special
 session of the UN General As-
 sembly to discuss the withdraw-
 al of Western forces from Leba-
 non and Jordan.   His  letters
 to the three Western heads of
 government reflect Moscow's de-
 sire for an  immediate    world
 forum in which to  denounce
 American and British actions in
 the Middle East before the cri-
 sis atmosphere dissipates fur-
 ther.
 Khrushchev's tactical
 shift away from his stand of
 a week ago for an immediate
 conference on the Middle East
 within the Security Council
 framework of the Big Four heads
 of    government,   plus Indian
 prime Minister Nehru and UN
 Secretary General Hammarskjold,
 represents at least a temporary
 suspension of Moscow's efforts
 to exploit the divergence of
 Western views on immediate sum-
 mit.talks and probably reflects
 Moscow's views that the sense
 of "extreme emergency" is di-
 minishing despite Soviet dip-
 lomatic and propaganda attempts
 to maintain this atmosphere.
 Moscow may feel that Brit-
 ish and American  recognition
 of the new Iraqi Government re-
 duces the plausibility of its
 allegations that a Western-in-
 spired attack on     Iraq is im-
 minent.   However, Moscow is
 attempting to keep this fear
 alive with reports of addition-
 al Western troop movements and
 charges that Western recogni-
 tion of the new Iraqi Govern-
 ment is only a tactic to gain
 Although Khrushchev's pre-
 vious note on 28 July had not
 closed the door to a compromise
 formula for a summit meeting
 within the UN framework, his
 notes of 5 August repeated his
 earlier objections to an "or-
 dinary" meeting of the Security
 Council, which he attacked as
 practically a "committee" un-
 der American domination with
 China represented by a "politi-
 cal corpse."  On the same day
 the Soviet premier stated that
 it was "unthinkable"  that he
 sit at a conference table
 with Chiang Kai-shek.
 Khrushchev's 5 August let-
 ters also renewed the Soviet
 call for  a  summit  meeting
 on    world  issues  as  first
 suggested    last  December.
 He    urged   that        it  be "com-
 posed                                                              as     we  had  earlier
 proposed"--parity    between
 Western and bloc  countries,
 but not including  Communist
 China.
 Soviet UN delegate A. A.
 Sobolev in the Security Council
 deliberations on the  Lebanese
 crisis in July had indicated
 that Moscow would hold off
 pressing for an immediate as-
 sembly meeting pending West-
 ern response to Soviet pro-
 posals for a summit  meeting.

 that General Assembly discus-

 that Moscow's vigorous diplo-
 matic measures protected the
 Arab world from further West-
 ern intervention.
 In the event of a with-
 drawal of Western troops from
 Lebanon and Jordan, the USSR
 could also claim credit for
 forcing such a move.   Moscow
 appears to believe there is
 little danger now of an attack
 on Iraq or the UAR and probably
 is more interested in diplo-
 matic and propaganda exploita-
 tion of the continued presence
 of British and American troops
 than in "forcing" their early
 withdrawal.
 Soviet notes on 1 August
 to Italy and Israel protesting
 the use of their territory or
 air space for facilitating the
 movement of troops and military
 supplies to Western forces in
 Lebanon and Jordan were designed
 to keep alive public apprehen-
 sion over recent Western mili-
 tary moves and to put pressure
 on pro-Western elements in these
 governments for their "com-
 plicity" in Western military ac-
 tion in the Middle East.   Mos-
 cow earlier had protested to the
 governments; )6f Turkey, Greece,
 West Germany, and Austria in
 an attempt to harass Western
 defense arrangements by attempt-
 ing to exploit each country's
 peculiar national interests.
 Khrushchev-Mao Talks
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev's
 talks with Mao Tse-tung in Pei-
 ping were the fourth top-level
 Sino-Soviet discussions held
 since the establishment of the
 Chinese Communist regime.   The
 two partners, who claimed they
 reached full agreement, dis-
 cussed, according to their joint
 communique, the strengthening
 of the Moscow-Peiping alliance
 and "mutual assistance."  The
 Chinese and Soviet defense min-
 isters were in attendance.
 They apparently also co-
 ordinated Sino-Soviet views on
 East-West issues, summit talks,
 and the long-term problem of
 cementing bloc unity and com-
 bating the threat of "revision-
 ism," particularly as embodied
 in Tito's heresies. The  Chi-
 nese Communists endorsed Khru-
 shchev's call for "big-power"
 summit talks in the communique.
 Khrushchev, however, apparent-
 ly decided to drop this line
 after studying the latest Ameri-
 can and British notes, which
 arrived in Moscow during his
 absence.   On 6 August Peiping
 promptly supported his new pro-
 posals of 5 August.
 it is clear that one
 of the important reasons for
 Khrushchev's visit was the
 need to discuss intrabloc re-
 lations.                                                                   Included in the-del-
 egations were Boris Ponomarev
 and Wang Chia-hsiang, both
 leading specialists in bloc
 affairs.   The communique agreed
 that the fight against "revision-
 ism," termed the most serious
 bloc problem at the moment,
 would continue.   Tito's heresies
 were condemned, and attention
 was probably given to the prob-
 lem of the future handling of
 the potentially divisive poli-
 cies of Gomulka and Kadar.
 The "mutual assistance"
 phase of the conference pre-
 sumably centered on military,
 and perhaps scientific, sub-
 Jects.   There  was  no  known
 participation by  economic
 experts.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 August 1958
 an earth satellite will
 e launched "in the near future"
 from China,   and        Peiping's
 spokesmen have intensified
 their call for Chinese achieve-
 ments in nuclear, electronic,
 and missile fields.
 Chinese Communist Moves
 Prior to Khrushchev's
 visit, Peiping had begun mov-
 ing jet fighters to coastal
 bases opposite Taiwan and',had
 been giving a new emphasis to
 its propaganda urging the "lib-
 eration" of Taiwan.   The Sino-
 Soviet chiefs and their defense
 ministers almost certainly dis-
 cussed the Taiwan question, but
 the  communique  contained no
 reference to this or any other
 Far East issue, and Peiping has
 drastically reduced its propa-
 ganda barrage since the talks
 ended.   Peiping's air moves
 along the coast appear to have
 been prompted primarily by a
 professed concern that the Chi-
 nese Nationalists are planning
 military action against the
 mainland and by the need to
 tighten coastal air defenses.
 Peiping, with Moscow's
 knowledge, may have planned; the
 air unit movements, hoping to
 provoke Chinese Nationalist re-
 action which would contribute
 to the atmosphere of crisis
 and demonstrate that Far Mgt-
 ern tensions are proper sub-
 jects for summit discussion
 along with other international
 issues.
 Chinese Military Situation
 the Com-
 munists are w l1 ng to  incur
 some military risks to achieve
 their  objectives
 The  Communists may
 e  eve, particularly in view
 of the present situation in the
 Middle East, that the United
 States will restrain the Na-
 tionalists.
 Despite the Chinese Nation-
 alist view that occupation of
 these fields is a direct of-
 fensive threat to Taiwan, the
 move  is  apparently  being
 undertaken ostensibly for de-
 fensive reasons.                                                                No bombers
 seem to be involved, and the
 deployment falls into a pat-
 tern of actions taken recently
 to deny the air space over the
 Chinese mainland to the Nation-
 alists.
 The Nationalists are con-
 tinuing air patrols over the
 strait with protective  high
 cover and with instructions to
 avoid engagement.   However, the
 aggressiveness of Chinese Com-
 munist air patrols conducted
 against daily Nationalist recon-
 naissance flights since the oc-
 cupation  of the coastal air-
 fields may lead to clashes by
 forces of squadron strength. An
 air battle on this scale could
 develop into an engagement in-
 volving Taiwan air space, with-
 out either side so intending.
 There has been no evidence
 of large-scale troop movements
 in East China.   The ground forces

 opposite the off shore islands
 have not been noticeably aug-
 mented.  No additional troops
 are needed, however, to take
 the Matsu Islands near Foochow,
 where the Communists already
 have a two-to-one superiority.
 Attack against the Quemoys,
 near Amoy, on the other hand,
 would necessitate a troop
 build-up as the Nationalist
 forces there are about equal
 to the Communists.   The re-
 cently completed Yingtan-Amoy
 railroad could permit a rapid,
 and perhaps undetected, Commu-
 nist build-up in this area.
 The Communists could try
 to take the offshore. islands by
 means short of an outright as-
 sault.   They have the capability
 of interdicting Nationalist sup-
 ply lines by air and sea attack
 and by shore-based artillery
 and rocket fire.   They  also
 could undertake to probe Ameri-
 can and Nationalist intentions
 through a limited attack against
 the lesser islands, Tatan or
 Erhtan.  An  assault  against
 Taiwan proper seems highly im-
 probable at this time because
 of the presence of the Seventh
 Fleet, the shortage of Communist
 landing craft, and insufficient
 supply build-ups in mainland
 port areas.
 There is thus little evi-
 dence that the Communists in-
 tend to initiate any major hos-
 tile action at the present time,
 but the possibility of in-
 creased air clashes makes the
 situation volatile.
 Chinese Nationalist Position
 At present, there are no
 positive indications that the
 Chinese Nationalists intend to
 take  preventive  air  action
 against the Communist-occupied
 airfields.   However,
 25X1
 a high-level
 conference - a   ng      with  this
 subject was held on 5  August
 and a decision is expected by
 9 August.   The conference was
 called by Chiang Kai-shek to
 decide whether to attack or to
 live with a situation in which
 Communist air ..superiority. Would
 extend over the offshore is-
 lands and the entire Taiwan
 Strait.
 Chiang Kai-shek stated he woul
 continue to honor his treaty com-
 mitments to the United States,
 which require consultation be-
 fore ordering air attacks against
 mainland targets.   However,
 Chiang also termed-  occupation
 of the airfields a "great threat"
 and possibly a prelude to an in-
 vasion of Taiwan. Chiang probably
 would at least inform United
 States officials of his inten-
 tions and seek the tacit approval
 of Washington before ordering
 air attacks.
 Although genuinely con-
 cerned, the Nationalists are
 also exploiting the situation
 to obtain more American arms.
 Chiang already has requested
 provision of Sidewinder air-
 to-air missiles for his  air
 force, replacement of his ob-
 solete F84G aircraft with newer
 F-86F's, a show of force by the
 US Seventh Fleet, and permanent
 stationing of F-100D's on Tai-
 wan.   Minister of Defense Yu
 Ta-wei has requested Admiral
 Smoot to transmit to Presi-
 dent Eisenhower a request for
 the President to issue a pub-
 lic statement to the effect that
 he would consider an attack on
 Quemoy or Matsu at this time to
 be a threat to Taiwan.

 7 August 1958
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELDPMENT S
 Lebanese rebels are still
 pressing for an immediate po-
 litical victory. Throughout
 negotiations this week they
 have continued to assert they
 will not lay down arms until
 American troops are withdrawn
 and President Chamoun and Prime
 Minister Sulh have resigned or
 left the country.  To obtain
 these objectives, they are con-
 tinuing sporadic terrorism in
 the towns in order to intimi-
 date merchants into maintain-
 ing the political "strike"
 started last May, and are keep-
 ing up minor military harass-
 ment.   Christian Lebanese ap-
 parently are most often the
 victims of the military activi-
 ty, and this has created some
 fear of a  "massacre"  in the
 Christian community.  A flare-
 up of religious fighting could
 occur if the Christians become
 convinced that a rebel politi-
 cal victory would be followed
 by further action against them.
 General Shihab is groping
 for some compromise solution
 which will leave all the fac-
 tions reasonably satisfied.
 The general's real opinions on
 all current subjects are ob-
 scure since he is obviously try-
 ing to be all things to all men.
 On their side,   Chamoun
 and Sami Sulh appear to have
 decided to try to stick it out
 until Chamoun's term legally
 ends on 23 September.
 Syria closed its border
 with Jordan on 3 August, thus
 cutting the latter off economic-
 ally from practically all con-
 tact with the outside world.
 All bulk imports must now come
 through the port of Aqaba and
 be transported over difficult
 terrain.   The petroleum situa-
 tion in Jordan remains touchy.
 The country has not retrieved
 some 45 tank trucks caught in
 Iraq by the coup there and may
 not get them back until POL
 previously supplied by Iraq is
 paid for.  The  Amman  money
 changers have also felt the ef-
 fect of isolation, and the value
 of the dollar has fallen there
 because of their inability to
 sell dollar holdings on the
 Beirut market.
 Iraq
 Iraqi leaders still fear
 that the British and American
 troops threaten   their regime.
 This fear has probably been en-
 couraged by the Egyptian "ex-
 perts"  who  have  flocked  to
 Baghdad.  However, a leading
 member of the new government in-
 quired "unofficially" this week
 whether the United States would
 be willing to continue to sup-
 ply arms to Iraq.   The leaders
 of the government still contend
 they are giving serious study
 to the question of Iraq's role
 in the Baghdad Pact, but it
 seems almost certain that they
 will decide to withdraw at the
 first  opportunity  to  do  so
 without unduly offending the
 United States and Britain.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 GENEVA" .TECUNICAL TALKS
 The Soviet delegation at
 Geneva has been outlining       a
 proposed international inspec-
 tion system for detecting nu-
 clear tests that is much more
 comprehensive and detailed than
 the USSR has ever suggested in
 years of intermittent disarma-
 ment negotiations, but one still
 considerably less effective
 than the West considers neces-
 sary.   Moscow appears acttaally
 willing to implement such a
 system, and eager to have the
 conference end with a wide
 measure  of  agreement.! -If
 the experts at Geneva fail to
 resolve the major points of
 difference, the USSR probably
 expects that its proposals ap-
 pear reasonable enough to make
 a strong impression on public
 opinion and to make it diffi-
 cult for the West to insist
 on a more elaborate system.
 The Soviet delegation made
 a number of concessions to the
 West, and agreement was reached
 relatively quickly in July on
 conclusions concerning  the
 effectiveness of various detec-
 tion methods.   This conciliatory
 tactic was probably motivated
 by a desire to expedite the
 conference and to have on the
 record a wide measure of agree-
 ment on technical details. More-
 over,  the Soviet delegation be-
 lieved that the agreements on
 detection methods were of sec-
 ondary importance because it
 intended to seek an inspection
 system that was not strictly
 based on these conclusionsre-
 garding methods.
 The key issue in determin-
 iag the size of a control sys-
 tem is the problem of detecting
 underground tests and distin-
 guishing them from earthquakes
 by seismic methods.   The Soviet
 delegation proposed a system
 that would have 100 to 110
 stations throughout the world.
 Although it claimed these could
 detect all nuclear explosions
 of more than one kiloton, it
 has now admitted that they
 could not distinguish under-
 ground tests of about one kilo-
 ton from earthquakes.   To do
 this, the USSR is relying on
 existing seismic stations to
 augment those of the inspection
 system.  A Polish delegate has
 hinted, however, that the So-
 viet delegation would compro-
 mise on a larger figure, approxi-
 mately 150 or 200 stations.
 The Western delegation,
 which has argued that as many
 as 650 stations would be theo-
 retically necessary to dis-
 tinguish between earthquakes
 and explosions of one kiloton
 or more, has proposed a system
 of 170 stations designed to
 serve the more limited purpose
 of assuring that five-kiloton
 underground explosions can be
 distinguished from earthquakes.
 This proposal appears to have
 aroused strong Soviet interest.
 Perhaps a more controversial
 problem is the use of inspec-
 tion teams when detection equip-
 ment registers an unidentified
 explosion.   While the USSR ap-
 parently believes such teams
 would be used only rarely and
 wants ad hoc teams set up on
 each occasion, the West antici-
 pates a much larger number of
 occasions demanding inspection
 and wants a number of permament
 inspection teams.   The West is
 relying heavily on inspection
 teams to take the place of a
 more elaborate system of con-
 trol posts.  The USSR, which
 is probably most sensitive
 about mobile inspection, may

 seek to reduce Western demands
 for such teams in return for
 concessions on other aspects
 of an agreement, such as the
 number of stations.   In an in-
 formal meeting on 6 August, the
 Soviet delegation made slight
 concessions on some questions
 but flatly opposed the Western
 proposals for inspection teams.
 While the Soviet delegation
 has been pressing for agreement
 on certain political issues,
 such as the nationality of per-
 sonnel manning inspection posts
 and priority areas of the world
 for inspection, it has indicated
 informally it will not press for
 such settlements in view of West-
 ern insistence on avoiding po-
 litical issues at Geneva.   The
 main Soviet aim is still to get
 as wide a measure of agreement
 there as possible.
 Nevertheless, Moscow is
 preparing for the possibility
 that the conference will end
 with some disagreement on the
 scope of an inspection system,
 at which time it would have to
 convince world opinion that its
 proposed system was perfectly
 adequate.   The Soviet announce-
 ment that stations in the USSR
 had detected 32 American tests
 in the Pacific over a three-
 month period was designed, as
 TASS said, to prove that "any
 nuclear explosions may be traced
 and recorded with the help of
 observation stations which al-
 ready exist."  In addition, Mos-
 cow emphasized that the AEC,
 which had only announced 14,
 was trying to conceal from world
 opinion the intensity of the
 American testing program.
 Other examples of increas-
 ing propaganda on nuclear tests
 were a Khrushchev statement re-
 iterating that the Geneva con-
 ference must lead to a termina-
 tion of tests and a Pravda claim
 that the United States was break-
 ing its promise by continuing
 tests after reaching agreement
 with the USSR on methods of de-
 tection.
 Since the Soviet Union
 has permitted the Geneva talks
 to make considerable progress
 in the apparent hope of bring-
 ing an end to  tests, Moscow
 will certainly spare  no  ef-
 fort  in  the   political  and
 propaganda  fields  to force
 Britain  and  the United
 States  to  stop  tests  if
 the  Geneva  conference  reaches
 agreement or even   near agree-
 ment.                                                                        (Concurred in

 Khrushchev's program to
 revitalize the party and to
 rely on it heavily in execut-
 ing his sweeping industrial
 and agricultural programs has
 enhanced the importance of the
 central committee's Bureau for
 the RSFSR, established in 1956.

 as an arbitrator of serious
 disputes arising in the adminis-

 go  beyond  the ? bounds  of
 governmental   adjudication.
 THROUGH RSFSR PARTY BUREAU
 A decree of the party cen-
 tral committee published this
 spring identified several hither-
 to undisclosed departments of the
 bureau,  bringing the known total
 to six.   It is now clear that
 responsibility for day-to-day
 central party administration
 has been divided between the
 RSFSR bureau and its depart-
 ments which conduct the affairs
 of the Russian Republic and
 the departments of the central
 committee for the union repub-
 .lics.which oversee   the  af-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 August 1958
 Active leadership of the
 bureau had been conducted by
 its deputy chairman, Nikolay
 Belyaev, until his transfer to
 Kazakhstan as  party        boss in
 December 1957.  While no  re-
 placement as deputy chairman
 has been announced, there are
 good indications that central
 committee secretary and presid-
 ium member Averky Aristov has
 assumed these duties.
 Aristov, who has an  ad-
 vanced engineering education,
 is one of the younger generation
 of Soviet leaders who combine
 political adeptness with eco-
 nomic  administrative  skills.
 He has had experience in a wide
 variety of central and regional
 posts, including stints as par-
 ty secretary in the mining and
 metallurgical centers of Sverd-
 lovsk and Chelyabinsk  in  the
 southern Urals, Krasnoyarsk Kray
 in central Siberia, and Khab-
 arovsk Kray in the Far East.
 At the 19th party congress
 in 1952, Aristov was elected to
 full membership in the expanded
 party presidium and secretariat
 of the central committee, but
 lost both jobs immediately fol-
 lowing Stalin's death.   He sub-
 sequently regained them, how-
 ever, and was reappointed to
 the secretariat in July 1955,
 and to the presidium in June
 1957 following the ouster  of
 the "antiparty group."
 It has recently been re-
 vealed that during his term on
 the secretariat in 1952  and
 1953, Aristov was also head of
 the central committee's Depart-
 ment for Party,   Trade                                                             Union,
 and Komsomol Organs, where one
 of his major duties was over-
 seeing personnel appointments.
 There is no evidence, however,
 that he has special responsi-
 bility for appointments  now,
 beyond enjoying the patronage
 perogatives of a central commit-
 tee secretary.
 Aristov has apparently kept
 his ties with those areas where
 he once served as party secre-
 tary.                                                               During the past year he

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 August 1958
 Although little is known
 about the distribution of func-
 tions among the ten central
 committee secretaries, and al-
 though the full range of Aris-
 tov's activities is still un-
 clear, the fact that he is
 personally involved in the
 agricultural and industrial
 development of the vast area
 of the RSFSR extending from
 the southern Urals to the Pa-
 cific marks him as -a man of con-
 siderable influence.
 On 2 April it was announced
 that Aristov had delivered the
 major address at a conference
 of regional officials called by
 the RSFSR bureau to discuss
 spring sowing.   This is a func-
 tion that former Deputy Chair-
 man Belyaev performed in the
 spring of 1956 and 1957.
 Aristov still appears as
 one of the lesser stars on the
 pages of Pravda and Izvestia,
 but this is probably more r-
 cause of the nature of his work
 than his position and authority
 within the top leadership.
 SOVIET MILITARY PERSONNEL CHANGES
 Since Marshal Malinovsky
 was appointed Soviet defense
 minister in October 1957 to re-
 place Marshal Zhukov,there have
 been a number of changes in
 military district and external
 commands, but the headquarters
 command staff inherited from
 Zhukov has remained remarkably
 stable.
 Eleven out of the 18 mili-
 tary districts have changed
 commanders.   The Soviet Group
 of Forces, Germany,  the North-
 ern Group of Forces in Poland,
 and the Pacific Fleet also have
 new commanders.   With two ex-
 ceptions, all of the former com-
 manders had served at least
 three years in their posts and
 were probably due for reassign-
 ment under normal procedures.
 Six of the former military dis-
 trict commanders have not as
 yet been identified in new
 positions, and the identity of
 the present commander of one
 military district has not been
 established.                   ILLEGIB
 Colonel General (tank
 troops) A. L. Getman, who was
 recently appointed commander of
 the Carpathian Military District,
 was a commander of tank units
 during World War II.   There is
 scant information on his ac-

 PEIPING CLAIMS SPECTACULAR ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS
 The leadership in Peiping
 clearly feels that the State
 Statistical Bureau's report show-
 ing an "unprecedentedly rapid"
 economic growth during the first
 half of 1958 vindicates its
 judgment that the Chinese econ-
 omy was ready for a "giant leap
 forward" in economic develop-
 ment.   The official People's
 Dail says the report complete-
 ly   validates the views of the
 "gloomy clique," which has held
 that the year's final accounts
 would justify the view that the
 "leap" policies were overly
 hazardous.
 "Some people" had held, the
 daily says, that the larger the
 industrial base, the slower the
 rate of growth, but the "facts"
 released in the statistical re-
 port show that they are  com-
 pletely wrong.   The report dis-
 closes that the total value of
 industrial production was 34
 percent above the same period
 last year, as compared with a
 15-percent increase called for
 in the official plan and a 33-
 percent increase pledged under
 the regime's leap forward pro-
 gram.   No firm figures were
 given for the output of individ-
 ual industrial items, but the
 percentage increases indicated
 seem within the range of possi-
 bility.   Investment in new con-
 struction, according to the re-
 port, was more than 40 percent
 above the midyear level of the
 record construction year of 1956.
 "Some people," the daily
 goes on, had held that agricul-
 tural production could not be
 increased more than about 5 per-
 cent a year, but the "facts"
 prove them wrong.   The statisti-
 cal report claims that the win-
 ter grain and early summer crops
 already harvested or about to
 be harvested recorded a remark-
 able 69-percent increase over
 the same crops last year.   The
 claimed increase in these early
 crops is some 11,000,000 tons
 greater than Peiping's estimate
 of the total increase in food
 grains achieved during the en-
 tire period of the First Five-
 Year Plan (1953-1957).  Wheat,
 formerly a low-yield crop, is
 said to have become a high-yield
 crop, and the harvest this year
 will top that of the United
 States for the first time in
 history.
 These claims may be ex-
 aggerated, but Peiping probably
 did achieve substantial produc-
 tion increases through more in-
 tensive cultivation of these
 early crops, improved water con-
 trol measures, and an extensive
 application of fertilizer--a
 claimed 48.5 tons per acre, com-
 posed mainly of mud and organic
 fertilizers.

 These statistics claim
 phenomenal progress and remain
 to be substantiated.   The tone
 of the People's Daily commentary
 on the report suggests that the
 "gloomy clique" has been further
 isolated and that. Peiping may
 move against the as yet uniden-

 leadership, which has shown
 occasional misgivings about
 the "leap" program now seems
 satisfied that  the  pace

 HUNGARIAN REGIME FORCES CONDITIONAL SURRENDER OF WRITERS
 As a follow-up to the ex-
 ecution of Imre Nagy, the Kadar
 regime has intensified its ef-
 forts to force the Hungarian
 intellectuals to associate them-
 selves with the regime.   As a
 result, the remaining leaders
 of the intellectual resistance
 --the highly respected "populist"
 writers--have decided to co-
 operate with reservations and
 to begin contributing to regime
 publications.   Concurrently,
 the government is reported to
 have arrested a number of sec-
 ondary school students who al-
 legedly had been influenced by
 the writers and planned a demon-
 stration following the Nagy ex-
 ecution; it has also continued
 retrials of convicted "counter-
 revolutionaries," some of whom
 are intellectuals, who had pre-
 viously received light sentences.
 gime is reliably reported to
 have begun the trial of Istvan
 Bibo, a close associate of the
 "populists" for his part in the
 Nagy government.
 The regime, however, was
 careful to give the writers a
 face-saving device.   At the
 same time that the press  was
 bitterly attacking them, culture-
 boss Gyula Kallai sent letters
 to the four leaders of  the
 "populists"--Laszlo Nemeth,
 Aron Tamasi, Peter Veres,and
 Gyula Illyes--outlining the
 party's cultural policy and
 asking for their comments on it.
 This was followed by an offer
 granting the "populists" the
 right--at least ostensibly--to
 publish anything they wished in
 certain periodicals.   A similar  25X1
 offer was also made to Laszlo
 Lajtha, a leading composerr_as
 The decision to increase
 pressure on the "populist" writ-
 ers apparently was reached at a
 central committee meeting on 6
 June and was followed in late
 June by an extremely detailed
 attack in Social Review, party
 ideological months?n paral-
 lel press attacks, the "popu
 lists" were accused of such
 crimes as preparing the  ideo-
 logical foundation for the 1956
 revolt,  anti-Semitism, bourgeois
 nationalism, opposing collec-

 garian youth, any one of which
 would be justification for po-
 lice action.                    Finally, the re-

 were given rather light prison
 sentences last year after Euro-
 pean intellectuals intervened
 on their behalf.   The regime is
 reported to have demanded the
 death penalty for Obersovszky
 at least.
 The regime probably hopes
 that a capitulation of recalci-
 trant writers would pave the
 way for the capitulation of the
 technical intelligentsia, also
 under pressure to cooperate in
 return for forgiveness for past
 "mistakes."? In this case, how-
 ever, the regime is handicapped
 by a severe shortage of tech-

 and it must attempt to salvage
 as many of those remaining as

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 August 1958
 FRENCH REACTION TO DE GAULLE'S DRAFT CONSTITUTION
 The French press and polit-
 ical parties are concerned over
 the increased powers of the
 president and the reduced powers
 of the National Assembly pro-
 vided for under De Gaulle's
 constitution just submitted to
 a special consultative committee
 for review.   The public's atti-
 tude, however, is "let De Gaulle
 see what he can do," and the
 final draft--though it may in-
 corporate some:-changes--Will
 probably be approved by a large
 majority.
 The draft attempts to over-
 come chronic French governmental
 instability by increasing the
 power of the executive at the
 expense of Parliament.   Presi-
 dential authority would extend
 to appointing the premier and
 dissolving the assembly, nego-
 tiating treaties, assuming full
 control in emergencies, and
 calling for referenda to break
 deadlocks between the government
 and Parliament.
 The National Assembly's
 legislative powers are restrict-
 ed to "major" fields,   and:
 it    can  no    longer eas
 ily   overthrow  governments...
 Moreover,   the  Senate"s  pow-
 ers                  would altost equal those!
 of the assembly, and, for the
 first time in modern French
 history, there would be a con-
 stitutional court which would
 have wide powers to pass on
 legislation.
 The provisions on relations
 with France's overseas posses-
 sions are purposely vague.  The
 Algerian settlers read in them
 a promise of integration of Al-
 geria into France, but West
 African nationalists are already
 protesting the omission of an
 option for independence.
 Press reaction to the draft
 has so far been cautious,  but
 fear is evidenced that the new
 constitution might permit the
 rise of a "strong man."  Le
 Monde sees "a presidentialmon-
 arrc y in the decor of a parlia-
 mentary republic," and expresses
 concern about the period after
 De Gaulle.   Andre Siegfried
 writes in Le Figaro that none
 of the consTi u  oval provisions
 should give rise to any basic
 objections except in the case
 of the very limited legislative
 functions, although the power
 of the president to "take meas-
 ures required by circumstances"
 is described as scarcely accept-
 able and contrary to a century
 of liberal tradition.
 The political parties are
 similarly critical of the "in-
 ordinate power for the president
 and the straight jacket around
 the assembly," and will probably
 sharpen.their attacks.   Both the
 Socialists and Radicals have ex-
 pressed fears the draft contains
 "grave dangers for the republic."
 Nevertheless, disgust with the
 Fourth Republic, faith in De
 Gaulle, and fear of a coup
 d'etat if the constitution is
 rejected combine to make pas-
 sage of the final version a
 virtual certainty.   The Septem-
 ber-October referendum will be
 more a plebiscite for or against
 De Gaulle than a measure of the
 merits of the proposed constitu-
 tion.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUNURY
 7 August 1958
 SKDL, as the largest party
 in parliament, was given the
 customary first chance at form-
 ing a majority government.   It
 failed, as did the Social Demo-
 crats and the Conservatives.
 President Kekkonen on 7 August
 asked the Agrarians,  Social
 Democrats, and the Social Demo-
 cratic Opposition together to
 try to form a majority govern-
 ment.
 The ultimate possibility
 of a coalition cabinet with
 FINNISH DIET
 1958 QUADRENNIAL ELECTIONS
 SKDL participation depends on
 the willingness of the Agrarians
 and the dissident Social Demo-
 crats to enter into such an ar-
 rangement.   This has not been
 ruled out by dissident Social
 Democratic leader Aare Simonen
 and by some Agrarians, but the
 latter party is divided over the
 question, since some of its dep-
 uties strongly oppose cabinet
 collaboration with the SKDL.
 Without their support such a
 coalition would lack a majority.
 The possibility of a certain
 amount of collaboration in par-
 liament among the SKDL, the
 Agrarians, and the dissident
 Social Democrats was, however,
 demonstrated on 29 July when
 the three parties joined forces
 to elect an Agrarian speaker
 and a Communist first vice
 speaker.
 Inability of the various
 parties to reach an agreement
 could lead to a pro-
 tracted continuation
 of the caretaker         25X1
 Kuuskoski regime. The
 Agrarians are not dis-
 pleased with his per-
 formance.
 Formation of an
 effective, democratic
 majority government
 depends on abatement
 of the bitter animosi-
 ties between the
 Agrarians and the So-
 cial Democrats and
 within the litter party:itself.
 Failure to form an effec-
 tive government capable of deal-
 ing with the formidable economic
 problems, principally unemploy-
 ment and marginal farming, by
 an economically sound program
 of economic expansion and in-
 dustrialization will benefit
 the Communists.
 BOLIVIAN REGIME THREATENED BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY
 The protracted rift between
 the left and right wings of the
 governing Nationalist Revolu-
 tionary Movement  (MNR) in Boliv-
 ia may develop into open  con-
 flict if moderate President
 Siles carries out his most re-
 cent threat to resign.    Former
 President Paz, titular head of
 the party, who returned to Bo-
 livia last May as a self-styled
 moderator, has thus far failed
 to reconcile the two hostile
 MNR factions.   In the event

 ened to do several times in the

 in Bolivia will probably be con-
 siderably weakened.
 Bolivia's present political
 crisis is focused on the compo-
 sition of the cabinet.                    The
 leftist MNR element, headed by
 labor leader Juan Lechin,,has
 demanded the removal of some of
 Sales' reliable moderate and
 rightist supporters.   Probably
 to back up his demands, Lechin
 has threatened to call a strike
 of the powerful  mine workers'
 union, which he largely controls.
 Meanwhile, Paz has insisted that
 Siles appoint a cabinet with an
 equal number of rightists and
 leftists.   Siles, however, has
 rejected both demands and has
 reportedly threatened to resign
 on 6 August in favor of Alvarez
 Plata,  Senate president and MNR
 national political committee
 chairman.   Formerly considered
 a backer of Sales, Alvarez now
 is believed to have drifted into
 the ranks of Lechin's leftist
 followers.
 Neither Paz nor Lechin has
 indicated any willingness to
 assume the presidency, although
 Paz, who left Bolivia on 4 Au-
 gust, may be seeking to rule
 the country from behind the
 scenes through Alvarez.
 Sales advised American Am-
 bassador Bonsai on 2 August
 that prior to taking an indefi-
 nite leave of absence shortly
 after 6 August, he will organize
 a new cabinet favorable to the
 US-backed stabilization program
 begun in late 1956.   This sug-
 gests he may be wavering in his
 decision to resign and that a
 solution to the MNR internal
 conflict may be found short of
 his retirement.   The possibili-
 ty exists, however, that the
 deep split in the MNR could pro-
 voke a concomitant division
 among the army, police, and mi-
 litia and result in serious vio-
 lence.
 ARMED FORCES DISAFFECTION THREATENS CUBAN GOVERNMENT
 The Cuban armed forces are
 increasingly restive because of
 the government's inability to
 quell the Castro rebellion in
 Oriente Province or to resolve
 the ptolonged political crisis,
 a fact which could impair Pres-
 ident Batista's chances of main-
 taining himself in power.   The
 military has traditionally been
 the bulwark of the Batista re-
 gime.
 Disaffection among enlisted
 men has been marked in Oriente
 Province, where troops fighting
 the Castro rebels have been
 forced to cope with unfamiliar
 terrain and guerrilla tactics
 and many officers have flagrant-
 ly engaged in graft.   Increased
 and apparently relatively suc-
 cessful rebel activity during
 recent weeks has contributed
 to the demoralization of the
 army.
 The inability of the armed
 forces to put down the Castro
 rebellion could serve to con-
 vince some high-ranking military
 elements of the need to oust
 Batista in order to restore
 peace.

 divided as a result of Duvalier's
 purges of senior officers, the
 army is no longer the traditional

 politics.
 The political climate has

 since Duvalier assumed office

 the government has requested
 the United States to establish
 air and possibly sea patrols
 along the Haitian coast and to
 supply the government with arms.
 Duvalier's control over
 the political situation seems
 precarious at best.   His great-

 civilian partisans.   Although

 13TH UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENCY
 Lebanese Foreign Minister
 Charles Malik's position on fa-
 voring the landing of American
 troops in Lebanon has raised
 considerable doubts among UN
 members about his suitability
 for the presidency of the 13th
 General Assembly which opens on
 16 September.   Although prior
 to the crisis Malik seemed as-
 sured of the office--usually
 bestowed by a substantial ma-
 jority as an accolade for pre-
 vious UN activities--Middle
 Eastern events have encouraged
 other countries to offer candi-
 dates to the detriment of Malik's
 chances.
 When Malik withdrew his
 candidacy at last year's Gen-
 eral Assembly in favor of Munro
 of New Zealand, UN members gen-
 erally conceded that the office
 should go to him in 1958.   Al-
 though this session begins be-
 fore President Chamoun and his
 foreign minister are scheduled
 to leave office, Malik's close
 association with the old regime
 has led some UN members to
 question whether he would be
 "representative" of the new Leba-
 nese Government.   Many members

 doubt that incoming president
 Shihab would even appoint Malik
 as a UN delegate.
 Reports from Beirut, how-
 ever, indicate that Shihab might
 regard the election of Malik
 as assembly president and the
 appointment of Chamoun as chief
 delegate as a convenient means
 of getting both men out of Leb-
 anon.   Even if the Shihab gov-
 ernment should send Malik to
 the UN, support for him person-
 ally has seriously declined.
 many Latin American delegations
 would not vote for  Malik  be-
 cause  "he  had  dome  out in
 favor of  foreign   interven-
 tion."
 Yugoslav Foreign Minister
 Koca Popovic's announcement of
 his candidacy on 1 August could
 seriously encroach on support
 for Malik.   On 8 July the Yugo-
 slav UN delegate told Ambassador
 Lodge that Belgrade believes it
 can draw more support than Malik.
 The Yugoslavs see this as an
 ideal time to demonstrate the
 number of their friends in the
 present struggle with the USSR.
 They believe they would gain
 backing from the West, Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America.
 Czechoslovakia has offi-
 cially announced the candidacy
 of its chief UN representative,
 Jiri Nosek.    Unless a serious
 deadlock develops between Malik
 and Popovic,however,  election of
 any satellite representative to
 the presidency seems unlikely.
 NATIONALIST PARTY DEMANDS INDEPENDENCE FOR FRENCH WEST AFRICA
 African nationalists at a
 regional party congress on 27
 July demanded immediate inde-
 pendence, reflecting the grow-
 ing opposition in French Tropi-
 cal Africa to  the  proposed
 French constitutional amendments.
 The slogan of independence is
 likely to have electrifying ef-
 fect on the Africans and may.
 force the political pace faster
 than desired    y  moderate
 leaders,   who.   appreciate.-
 French West Africa's economic
 and administrative dependence
 on France.
 The major nationalist par-
 ties in French West Africa--the
 African Democratic Rally (RDA),
 which controls the government
 of four of the eight territories,
 and the Party of the African Re-
 groupment  (PRA), which dominates
 three--oppose the proposed amend-
 ments to the French constitution
 because they do not recognize
 the "right to independence" for
 dependent territories under a
 federal system.   The voters in
 the autumn referendum will have
 the following alternatives for
 which to express a preference:
 retention of the present coloni-
 al status, integration with
 metropolitan France as depart-
 ments, or association in a fed-
 eral system.
 Many Paris officials are
 resigned to early independence
 in Tropical Africa but fear the
 effect that an independence
 clause would have on Algeria.
 According to an unconfirmed
 press report, De Gaulle favors
 conditional independence for
 France's Tropical African pos-
 sessions in a-loose federation
 in which Paris would handle for-
 eign affairs.   Such an offer
 would appeal to moderate na-
 tionalist leaders but may not
 satisfy extremists who have
 gained strength recently.

 IRAQ'S NEW ECONOMIC ORIENTATION
 The conservative approach
 to Iraq's economic development
 program followed by prerevolu-
 tionary governments is being
 abandoned by the new Iraqi re-
 gime.   The Development Board,
 the chief instrument for chan-
 neling 70 percent of oil reve-
 nues into economic projects, is
 being overhauled, and members
 appointed by former governments
 have been dismissed.   The posi-
 tion of Western consultants to
 the board is in doubt.
 Large numbers of Egyptian
 economic specialists, who quick-
 ly responded to Baghdad's re-
 quests for assistance shortly
 after the revolt, are now in a
 position to exert influence on
 the expenditure of oil revenues
 set aside for development. These
 funds are presently accumulating
 at about $150,000,000 per year.
 Based on the precedent of the
 Egyptian revolution, these ad-
 visers can be expected to press
 for a large-scale redistribution

 of land--a move which would
 greatly enhance popular support
 for the present government.
 The new government's policy
 toward the oil industry is com-
 ing into sharper focus. Despite
 public assurances that the gov-
 ernment is favorably inclined
 toward maintaining the status
 quo before the revolt, consid-
 erable departure from existing
 arrangements probably will oc-
 cur.   Baghdad is seeking sup-
 port and guidance from Nasir
 on economic matters, and Egyp-
 tian petroleum experts have al-
 ready arrived in Baghdad.
 Pressure on the Iraq Pe-
 troleum Company (IPC) to build
 a new pipeline through Syria
 will probably begin soon, since
 Baghdad apparently sought agree-
 ment with Nasir for permission
 to build such a line.   The IPC
 concession, which covers almost
 all of Iraq, may be reduced sub-
 stantially and the released
 areas opened to other companies,
 probably on the pattern of the
 75/25 profit split and joint-
 management scheme recently con-
 cluded in Iran.   Demands that
 IPC alter its existing 50/50
 profit split, which had been
 put forward by the former gov-
 ernment,, probably will be pressed
 with more vigor by the new gov-
 ernment.   It is also likely
 that Iraq will attempt to get
 large retroactive p4yments from
 the oil companies.
 Iraq's attitude toward eco-
 nomic relations with the Commu-
 nist bloc countries may be pat-
 terned after those adopted by
 Cairo.   Baghdad's statement to
 Peiping that Iraq "will estah-
 lish political, commercial, andt
 economic relations with all na-
 tions of the world without any
 discrimination" suggests the
 government would not be adverse
 to supplying petroleum to Com-
 munist China and the Soviet Far
 East.   Presently oil for these
 areas is supplied chiefly from
 the western USSR and shipped,
 at high cost, by way of the
 Trans-Siberian Railroad.

 must be treated with reserve,
 however.   His pact with Suhra-
 wardy, moreover, will be sub-
 ject to the strain of their con-
 tinuing competition for power
 and could be modified by chang-
 ing political conditions.
 Mirza's willingness to re-
 sume his cooperation with Suhra-
 wardy, whom he ousted from of-
 fice in October 1957, may be
 prompted by his shock over de-
 velopments in Iraq and also by
 increasing signs that his sup-
 port among the Pakistani Army
 and other influential groups
 is waning.   In considering the
 alternatives open to him to
 protect his future position,
 Mirza may have been persuaded
 by these trends that his in-
 terests would be better served
 by cooperating with Suhrawardy,
 who is capable of effectively
 defending  the  government's
 pro-Western foreign policy,
 than by attempting  to  assume
 a  more   dictatorial   role.
 COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT IN INDIA'S KERALA STATE UNDER FIRE
 The Communist government
 in India's Kerala State has
 come under increasing fire as
 a result of a series of clashes
 between state police and non-
 Communist demonstrators.  While
 Communist control in Kerala
 does not appear to be serious-
 ly endangered, this first effec-
 tive challenge to the Communist
 regime has served to strengthen
 and unite the non-Communist
 opposition.   Prime Minister
 Nehru has thus far resisted
 pressure for the national gov-
 ernment to intervene.
 Recurring incidents and.
 strikes during recent weeks
 involving opposition agitators
 have resulted in police action
 in which seven people have been
 killed and a large number in-
 jured.   There have also been a
 number of political murders,
 apparently aimed at terrorizing
 the opposition.   Reliable sources
 report that anti-Communist sen-
 timent among large sections of
 the public in Kerala has sharply
 increased as a result of the
 continuing agitation.
 The police firing has
 drawn protests from a top lead-
 er of the all-India Communist
 party as well as from Congress
 party officials.   S.A. Dange,
 leader of the Communist group
 in the national Parliament,
 stated on 27 July that the party
 would inquire into the Communist
 government's action in Kerala
 with regard to the maintenance
 of law and order, and instruct
 it to avoid such violent in-
 cidents in the future or be
 asked to resign.
 Dange on 3 August invited
 the two main Socialist parties
 in Kerala to join the Communists,
 who have only a bare majority
 in the state assembly, in form-
 ing a united-front government.
 It is not yet clear whether
 Dange's statements reflect the
 official view of the party,
 which formally adopted a "peace-
 ful" approach to power in April.

 The Kerala Socialists, who have
 been actively cooperating with
 the Congress party in opposition
 to the Communist ministry, are
 unlikely to be interested in
 Dange's proposal.
 There has been growing con-
 cern in New Delhi  recently
 over the Communists' new tac-
 tics of violence and intimida-
 tion in Kerala,  particularly
 over references by Chief Minis-
 ter Namboodiripad to the possi-
 bility of "civil war" in  the
 event Congress leaders form a
 front with  other opposition
 parties.   New Delhi's apparent
 unwillingness to intervene con-
 stitutionally in Kerala prob-
 ably stems in part from its re-
 luctance to undercut efforts
 toward organizing a united op-
 position.   Local Congress and
 Socialist politicians are likely
 to continue to foment disturb-
 ances, possibly in an effort
 to force the national govern-
 ment to establish emergency
 President's Rule as a step to-
 ward ousting the Communists.

 At a time when Lebanon is
 faced with its most critical
 problems since World War II,
 the country's politicians have
 turned to a military man, Gen-
 eral Fuad Shihab, who insists
 he is no politician,  to lead
 the country.
 Shihab, born in 1903, is
 a member of the Ma-
 ronite  Christian
 branch of one of Leb-
 anon's leading fami-
 lies.                  Other Shihabs
 are   Moslems and
 Druze,  a fact which
 may accentuate the
 general's natural
 tendency for compro-
 mise in a country in
 which all political
 matters are decided
 on a sectarian basis.
 French-educated,Shi-
 hab received his mil-
 itary training in
 the French Levant
 Army  when  Lebanon
 was under French man-
 date. After receiv-
 Free French and British troops

 he was appointed commander in
 chief of the Lebanese Army by
 President Bishara al-Khuri.
 When the Palestine War

 hab remonstrated against engag-
 ing his inadequately armed forces,
 but followed orders.
 Within  .a  few  days
 Lebanese forces were
 pushed back into Leb-

 War   College.    When  World
 War II threatened,  he was as-

 eral Shihab was given "full re-

 the nation" and was ordered to
 arrest the opposition leaders.
 He refused to do so, however,
 stating that he could not guar-
 antee the president's safety,
 and suggested that Khuri resign.
 Shihab's  excuse  was  that
 there  was  "insubordination"
 in the army which he could not
 control.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 August 1958
 Khuri resigned on 18 Sep-
 tem>ber 1952, whereupon the press
 .! lxd certain elements of the pub-
 lic called on Shihab to assume
 the presidency.   He refused,
 saying that he was not inter-
 ested in a political career.
 Later, when pressed by Prime
 Minister Karame to sign  a de-
 fense pact with Syria, he re-
 fused to consider it because he
 believed it would be dangerous
 to be allied to a weak Syria.
 The general first clashed
 with President Chamoun in the
 summer of 1955 when  unruly
 tribes in northern Lebanon car-
 ried out widespread smuggling
 activities--mostly hashish and
 arms--and were robbing travelers.
 The President ordered Shihab to
 send troops to the area to re-
 store order, which Shihab re-
 fused to do on the ground that
 it was a police problem.  Shihab
 reached an accommodation with
 the chief tribal leader   and
 promised to secure government
 assistance for the dissident
 tribes.   Shihab won much acclaim
 from the residents of that area
 for his attitude, and Chamoun
 was forced to rescind the order.
 During the present Lebanese
 rebellion, General Shihab's re-
 luctance to utilize the army's
 full resources against the oppo-
 sition stemmed in part from a
 dislike of President Chamoun
 and a fear that his "brittle"
 instrument would shatter if or-
 dered to strike hard because of
 the political divisions within
 it.   Throughout the rebellion
 Shihab has maintained contact
 with rebel leaders and  has
 reached understandings which he
 claimed would ward off sectarian
 warfare.
 This policy has preserved
 some of his popularity among
 moderate opposition elements,
 but at the same time has weakened
 the position of pro-Chamoun ele-
 ments.   This attitude apparently
 has convinced the opposition
 that he is a man who can be in-
 duced to compromise to their ad-
 vantage, and it has resulted in
 Shihab's having made almost no
 influential political enemies.
 Shihab warned American of-
 ficers against Syrian-Egyptian
 unity and the threat to- Near
 Eastern peace that it would
 bring.   He also has expressed
 concern over the rise of Soviet
 prestige in the Middle East at
 the expense of the United States.
 Although critical of Amer-
 ican policy in the Middle East,
 Shihab has been friendly toward
 the United States.   He has crit-
 icized American policy for not
 doing "something positive" about
 the Palestine situation and has
 claimed that only the US could
 influence Israel to a compromise
 which would "save Arab face."
 More recently Shihab has
 said he believes that Nasirism
 is the "wave of the future,"
 and, because of his political
 outlook and personality, may
 well lead Lebanon out of the
 Western camp into the UAR sphere
 of influence.   Nasir in fact
 recommended Shihab as a "com-
 promise"candidate for the presi-
 dency some two months ago.

 TRENDS IN INDIA'S FOREIGN RELATIONS
 During the past year, de-
 velopments within the Sino-So-
 viet bloc have led India to
 adopt a more critical attitude
 toward the Communist world.  At
 the same time, India's relations
 with the United States have im-
 proved.   Recent events in the
 Middle East, including the land-
 ing of American troops in Leb-
 anon, produced a more restrained
 reaction from Prime Minister
 Nehru and his government than
 might have been expected, and
 American relations with India
 apparently have not deteriorated
 significantly to date.   This
 does  not  mean that Nehru is
 likely to alter his basic policy
 of nonalignment with the two
 power blocs or that he will
 abandon his opposition to de-
 fense pacts and nuclear tests.
 It does suggest, however, that
 Nehru will probably remain cau-
 tious in his tactical approaches
 toward the Sino-Soviet bloc.

 New Delhi's assessment of
 the USSR's position in world
 Doubts as to the prospect
 for continued liberalization
 within the bloc were soon en-
 gendered by the harsh treatment
 accorded the Yugoslav Communist
 party by  Moscow  and Peiping.
 In his first such direct state-
 ment, Nehru condemned the ideo-
 logical rigidity of 'interna-
 tional  Communism  and  re-
 proached both                                                                 Moscow and Pei-

 liberalization and  the "hun-
 dred flowers" thesis.   He

 as an example of interference

 other country.
 affairs has been conditioned
 by three major developments dur-
 ing the first half of 1958: par-
 ty chief Khrushchev's assump-
 tion of the Soviet premiership,
 the bloc campaign against Tito,
 and the execution of Imre Nagy.
 The Indian press--probably re-
 flecting official reaction--
 recognized Khrushchev's move
 as a resumption of one-lean
 rule, but observed that a re-
 turn to "undiluted Stalinism"
 was unlikely.

 The execution of the Hun-
 garian rebel leaders also had
 a strong impact throughout India.
 In contrast to the hesitant and
 mixed reaction to the 1956 up-
 rising, there was an immediate
 public outcry against the ac-
 tion.   This was followed by a
 prolonged and nearly universal
 condemnation.  Official reaction,
 as in 1956, lagged somewhat be-
 hind the outraged response of
 the press and public.   Party
 and government statements--al-
 though guarded and generalized--
 were clearly  critical,   how-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 August 1958
 Nehru's deputy, Home Af-
 fairs Minister Pant, in two pub-
 lic speeches condemned the "mur-
 der" of Nagy in the strongest
 terms yet applied by top Indian
 officials to bloc affairs.
 Amplifying an earlier
 statement of 23 June, Nehru
 told a press conference on 3
 July he was "shocked and wor-
 ried" by the development, but
 hedged his comments, apparently
 to avoid unduly offending Mos-
 mind as to how far the prin-
 ciples are being acted on by
 people who talk about them.
 This constitutes his first pub-
 lic admission that the  prin-
 ciples may not in practice be
 honored by the Communist coun-
 RStalintam is once again alive.  Countries which
 had given people freedom are taking it back.  The urge
 for i deperdenee in 9angary and Poland has been thwart-
 ed.  Me slogan of Plot a hundred flowers bloom' is now
 dead.... Communists in ihdia also recently pledged to
 adopt peaceUi methods, but what we have seen *how*
 that they--Communtats all over the world--have swerved
 from that path.  The most recent saawpie was the murder
 of M. lhw Fogy. m
 major part of India's foreign
 policy tactics has turned on
 Nehru's conviction that an im-
 portant relaxation of controls
 was under way inside the Soviet
 realm and should be encouraged
 by withdrawing outside pres-
 sures, this revision of Nehru's
 own assessment could have pro-
 found effects on India's inter-
 national policies.
 Another indication that
 Nehru was reappraising the basis
 of his foreign policy came in
 his comments during a press con-
 ference in early July on the
 validity of the Five Principles
 of  peaceful coexistence,  of
 which noninterference in inter-
 nal affairs is the cardinal
 point.  Nehru confessed that
 a question had arisen in his
 tries which so frequently es-
 pouse them.
 The fact that Moscow did
 not move troops into the Middle
 East to counter Western inter-
 vention was received in  New
 Delhi with approval and relief..
 Khrushchev's proposal  for a
 summit meeting on the crisis
 accorded with Nehru's frequent
 appeal for top-level negotia-
 tions and gained his immediate
 support.   Soviet insistence on
 Nehru's participation in the
 summit talks also impressed New
 Delhi.   Nehru was reported to
 be keenly disappointed, however,
 that Moscow refused his request
 to support the Japanese UN res-
 olution on Lebanon.
 Relations with Peiping
 While reaction in India
 to recent bloc developments
 has been focused largely on
 Soviet responsibility, the role
 played by neighboring Commu-
 nist China has not gone un-
 noticed.   Peiping's stand on
 the Yugoslav and Hungarian is-
 sues has, in fact, come as a
 revelation to large segments
 of Indian opinion,, official
 and unofficial, and may have
 more significant implications
 in the long run than the reac-
 tion against Moscow.

 7 August 1958
 Indian policy has been
 based largely on the assumption
 that China, as a sort of com-
 rade in the Asian nationalist
 movement, could not be consid-
 ered an integral part of the
 Sino-Soviet bloc.   Russian Com-
 munism and Chinese Communism
 have appeared to most Indians
 as two quite different phenomena..
 Similarly, New Delhi has not
 considered Peiping subject to
 the doctrinaire outlook associ-
 ated with Moscow or identified
 with the more repugnant aspects
 of Stalinism.
 Mao's experiment with the
 "hundred-flowers" concept, os-
 tensibly allowing a freer in-
 tellectual atmosphere, confirmed
 many Indians' view-that Pei-
 ping's approach to Communism
 was not identical with that of
 Moscow.   Its subsequent shift
 to a  crackdown on intellectual
 dissidents had relatively lit-
 tle impact on Indian attitudes,
 however.
 On the other hand,   Pei-
 ping's unqualified support--at
 times even leadership--of the
 bloc's recent attack on Tito
 and its endorsement of the Hun-
 garian executions came as a
 considerable shock to many In-
 dians, and Chinese prestige in
 India has been damaged.  Offi-
 cials in New' Delhi--including the
 prime minister--will probably
 feel it necessary to revise
 their estimates of Peiping's
 position in the Communist world,
 as well as in Asia.
 Relations With the US
 A gradual improvement in
 New Delhi's relations with Wash-
 ington began toward the end of
 1955.   It was enhanced by the
 American stand on the Suez cri-
 sis in 1956, by Nehru'.s personal
 talks with President Eisenhower
 in December of that year, and
 by stepped-up American economic
 assistance to India in 1958.
 Official and public opin-
 ion in India has been strongly
 critical of Western interven-
 tion in the Middle East, con-
 tending that Arab nationalism
 is a force that cannot be con-
 tained by the West with armed
 force.    To attempt to do so,
 in Nehru's privately expressed
 view, merely provides the USSR
 with propaganda capital.   In-
 dia's official reaction, how-
 ever, has been restrained, in
 contrast to the bitter denuncia-
 tion in 1956 of the British-
 French intervention in Suez.
 New Delhi's more reasonable at-
 titude is illustrated by Nehru's
 reportedly pleased reaction to
 President Eisenhower's letter
 explaining US motives and by
 the general readiness among of-
 ficial circles to credit US
 good intentions.
 This reaction is consistent
 with a noticeable shift in In-
 dian attitudes during the past
 year toward a more sympathetic
 position vis-a-vis the United
 States.   During this period,
 Indian officials--from Nehru
 on down--softened their criticism
 of US policies and showed a
 greater responsiveness to Amer-
 ican arguments, both in New
 Delhi and at the United Nations.
 A major--though probably
 not decisive--factor in the es-
 tablishment of closer relations
 has been India's increasing de-
 pendence on the United States
 for essential economic assist-
 ance.   By 1957 it had become
 clear to New Delhi that the ful-
 fillment of even the "hard core"
 of the Second Five-Year Plan
 (1956-6l)--on which the polit-
 ical and economic future of
 India hang--would be impossible
 without substantial aid in the
 form of foreign exchange.   It
 was equally clear that the only
 acceptable source for most of
 this vital assistance was the
 United States.   Aid on such a
 scale from Moscow apparently

 was ruled out by New Delhi for
 political reasons--nor was it
 certain that the bloc would be
 willing to provide it.
 By May 19 58 it had become
 apparent that India faced a far
 more severe financial crisis
 than originally anticipated, and
 the need for greatly increased
 foreign assistance during the
 remaining three years of the
 plan period was emphasized.
 Relations with Neutralist Leaders
 Indications of a sharper
 Indian awareness of cold-war
 realities are also evident in
 New Delhi's reaction to recent
 developments in the Middle East
 and Southeast Asia, even though
 its traditional policy of non-
 alignment and mediation has
 been consistently maintained.
 Nehru's relations with
 Yugoslavia, the UAR, and Indo-
 nesia show that he continues
 to place a high premium on the
 strengthening of nations which
 are not aligned with either ma-
 jor bloc in the hope that more
 independeAt leadership will
 prevent the division of the
 world into two warring camps.
 At the same time, Nehru main-
 tains his opposition to  the
 formation of any new "bloc,"
 preferring to extend the "area
 of peace," i.e., nonalignment.
 Fearing that his presence
 would be interpreted as formal-
 izing a new relationship, Nehru
 has resisted suggestions for a
 "neutralist  summit  meeting"
 with Tito, Nasir, and Sukarno,
 and has limited his support of
 these leaders largely to behind-
 the-scenes efforts.
 Indian officials' bias in
 favor of the UAR's position on
 issues in the Middle East was
 strengthened as a result of
 Western intervention.  Nasir's
 leadership of Asian nationalism
 in the Middle East, opposing
 the Baghdad Pact of which Paki-
 stan is a member, will probably
 earn him continued support from
 New Delhi, even though Nehru
 has misgivings about Cairo's
 expansionist objectives.
 Nehru's reaction to the
 events in Indonesia  demon-
 strated fear that a Communist
 take-over might occur in this
 strategic area flanking  the
 Indian subcontinent,  either
 through internal  dissension
 or through foreign intervention.
 Early in May, New Delhi appealed
 privately to the United States
 for support of a Sukarno-Hatta
 realignment as the best hope
 of preventing Communist gains.
 Prospects
 Nehru is not likely to
 abandon his long-established
 policy of nonalignment.   He
 will almost certainly continuo
 to oppose US policy on  such
 issues as regional  military
 pacts and cessation of nuclear
 testing, and refrain from tak-
 ing                                                       a  more  positive  stand
 against bloc actions in  the
 interest of promoting his maid
 objective of an East-West rap-
 prochement.
 However, the considerable
 alienation of  Indian  good
 will  toward Moscow  and Pei-
 ping in the wake  of the Yugo-
 slav and  Hungarian develop-
 ments,   combined with India's
 growing need for American eco-
 nomic  assistance, has almost
 certainly  left its  mark on
 New Delhi's  foreign relations.
 The  result could be  a tac-
 it moderation  of India's
 previous   policies.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 August 1958
 PEIPING'S ATTITUDE ON POPULATION GROWTH
 The Chinese Communists now
 proclaim that an immense popu-
 lation is their greatest re-
 source and presents no obstacle
 to their "giant leap forward"
 in economic development.   In
 late 1956 and early 1957, Pei-
 ping began but did not fully
 develop a propaganda campaign
 to popularize birth control.
 This  campaign  was   quietly
 dropped last year when the pro-
 gram for political liberalism
 was reversed and optimistic
 economic planning resumed. The
 present policy contemplates
 the continuation of the cur-
 rent population growth which
 would bring China's population
 from the present 650,000,000
 to 720,000,000 in 1962 and over
 810, 000, 000 in 1967, and to
 pass the billion mark around,
 1975.
 Tse-tung himself said private-
 ly that he would like to limit
 the population to 700,000,000.
 Initial public discussion
 of the subject was entrusted
 to non-Communists, one of whom
 suggested in 1954 that the re-
 gime set a ceiling on the pop-
 ulation and maintain it through
 birth control.   He argued this
 was necessary to protect the
 health of babies and mothers.
 The Ministry of Health, he
 said, had drawn up measures on
 contraception and birth con-
 trol in July 1954 but had not
 publicized them.   The ministry
 did begin a program of popular-
 izing birth-control methods
 shortly thereafter, but the
 party gave it no public support
 at the time.
 Population Growth
 As in all peasant economies,
 birth rates in China have been
 traditionally high.  After  the
 Chinese Communists  came  to
 power in 1949, death rates, be-
 ing more susceptible to con-
 trol, fell sharply as hostili-
 ties ceased,  the economy was
 stabilized, and elementary pub-
 lic health programs were inaug-
 urated.   Birth rates remained
 high and the rate of population
 growth increased steadily be-
 tween 1950 and 1957, when it
 reached around 2.5 percent per
 year. China's population is in-
 creasing now at a rate of some
 16,000,000 annually.
 Population Policy
 Before it took its first
 national census in 1954, Pei-
 ping had no population policy.
 When the results of the census
 disclosed, however, that the
 country's population--580,000,-
 000--was far larger than es-
 timated, a number of Chinese
 leaders, both inside and out-
 side the party, began to advo-
 cate population control.   Mao
 It was only after the eco-
 nomic setbacks of 1956 that the
 party leadership publicly iden-
 tified itself with birth con-
 trol, admitting the economic
 necessity for promoting it.
 Speaking for the party central
 committee, Premier Chou En-lai
 reported in the fall of 1956 `:
 that the Ministry of Health had
 been ordered to publicize a
 birth-control program.   The of-
 ficial press asserted that a
 "moderate degree" of birth con-
 trol was needed in order to
 raise living standards.
 By the spring of 1957,
 birth control had become a ma-
 jor topic, official and pub-
 lic.                                                             A session of the China
 People's Political Consultative
 Conference in March was told
 that the nation needed a birth-
 control program to overcome
 employment problems, shortages
 of investment funds, and other
 economic difficulties.   It was
 also told that legal restraints
 on induced abortion and steril-
 ization were being, eased--a
 policy which; immediately ran
 into heavy opposition.
 In the same period, a re-
 search committee was set up to

 7 August 1958
 look into the various means of
 limiting the birth rate, and
 clinics were established in
 many parts of the country to
 educate people in the practice
 of birth control.  Articles
 began to appear in the press
 to instruct those interested
 in the approved techniques.
 After the publication in
 June 1957 of a revised version
 of Mao Tse-tung's ' "contradic-
 tions" speech, the subject of
 birth control was played down,
 and public discussion encouraged
 to follow, with only minor
 modifications, the line set
 forth in that speech.   Mao
 chided those who thought that
 "the fewer people and the small-
 er their world the better." He
 declared that China's 600,000,-
 000 people were an asset, even
 though the figure did give rise
 to some "difficulties."  He
 made no statement advocating
 birth control, as he reportedly
 had in his original speech.
 The shift in approach was
 dramatized when several promi-
 nent, but non-Communist, demo-
 graphers, and sociologists were
 denounced as "rightists" in
 the second half of 1957 for
 having taken the "Malthusian"
 stand that China's huge popula-
 tion definitely limited the
 rate of economic growth.   They
 were charged with using the
 population question to sow
 doubts about the possibility
 of building China into a strong
 socialist power and about the
 ability of China's socialist
 economy to meet the needs for
 producer and essential consumer
 goods.
 Reassessing its economic
 potentialities, Peiping decided
 by late 1957 that the pace of
 economic development could be
 stepped up and that the time
 was ripe for a "giant leap for-
 ward."  New economic programs
 were grafted onto existing
 plans with a view to making a
 virtue out of the necessity of
 supporting this immense man-
 power.
 Most importantly, some
 phases of industrial, commercial,
 and financial activities were
 shifted from Peiping to the low-
 er administrative levels, a large
 number of small and medium-sized
 plants were constructed through-
 out the country, and the vast
 underemployed rural manpower--
 bolstered by additions from the
 cities--was put to work on stag-
 gering numbers of water conserv-
 ancy projects.   In essence, Pei-
 ping's hopes for marked produc-
 tion increases in the new pro-
 gram rest on the success of more
 intensive exploitation of labor.
 Propaganda support of this
 "leap forward" program has re-
 quired that Peiping take an op-
 timistic public stand that China's
 huge population can, in Liu Shao-
 chi's phrase, do "anything within
 the realm of human possibility."
 In its extreme form this propa-
 ganda asserts that the rapid
 growth of population presents
 no problems which cannot', be
 solved through increased pro-
 duction:   "The greater the pop-
 ulation, the better off we will
 be, because man is the most fun-
 damental productive force."
 As the "leap forward" prol
 gram has progressed, Peiping in
 fact has argued that a serious
 labor shortage has developed
 requiring immediate solution.
 Liu Shao-chi has contended that
 the argument has been "blown
 sky high" that a big population
 impedes accumulation of capital
 and that China's agriculture
 cannot make quick progress.
 Peiping's present line on the
 population question is probably
 best summed up in a recent
 People's Daily assertion, "We
 are not promo ers of regress
 who worry about China's popula-
 tion....We are revolutionaries
 ...and promoters of progress."
 Population Prospects
 The present de-emphasis
 of the question  does not mean
 that the regime has dropped
 the         idea  of  controlling

 ILLEGIB
 population growth.   Even when
 virtually denying the existence
 of a problem, Peiping usually
 keeps the door open for a 're-
 versal of its stand.   The writ-
 er of a 6 June article in the
 People's Daily on population
 closed  iti a -warning against
 "unrestricted and blind" pop-
 ulation growth.    "Planned in-
 crease of population," he said,
 is demanded in a planned econ-
 omy.
 Peiping will probably suc-
 ceed to some extent in breaking
 down the traditions which en-
 courage high rates of reproduc-
 tion in China,  by reducing the
 social and economic value of
 large families through such de-
 vices as paying the collectiv.
 ized peasant only for his labor,
 regardless of the size of his
 family and abolishing special
 family  allowances  for  urban
 workers.   It is likely;  that
 the birth-control clinics are
 still operating and that re-
 search into the various birth-
 control techniques is continu-
 ing against the day when a dif-
 ferent program on birth con-
 trol may be needed.
 Among the techniques be-
 ing studied are delayed marriage,
 contraception, induced abortion,
 and sterilization.   Delayed
 marriage, the least expensive
 expedient, is encouraged in
 speeches.   Peiping has given
 principal attention to contra-
 ception.   A tardy realization
 that it was not in a position
 to produce enough of the neces-
 sary equipment at prices with-
 in the reach of the average Chi-
 nese probably contributed to
 the withering away of the 1956-
 57 birth-control campaign.  A
 plant capable of turning out
 100,000,000 contraceptive de-
 vices a year is being built in
 Shanghai, but even when the
 problems of production and dis-
 tributionare solved, there will
 remain the problem of persuad-
 ing millions of Chinese to
 change their mores,  in an area
 not easily susceptible to coer-
 cion.   The development of an
 inexpensive oral contraceptive
 would simplify and facilitate
 acceptance of contraception,
 and development of such a meth-
 od may have high priority in
 Peiping's research.
 Peiping is aware that
 legalization of induced abor-
 tion and sterilization in 1948
 enabled Japan to reduce birth
 rates at a dramatic and unpre-
 cedented pace.   In the ten
 years which followed, Japan's
 birth rate was cut in half,
 from 35 per thousand to 17.
 Japan shifted to these measures
 only after others had failed.
 There may be a similar sequence
 of events in China.   Peiping
 did ease legal restrictions on
 the two operations in March
 1957, but at present the nation
 lacks sufficient qualified medi-
 cal personnel to promote a suc-
 cessful program based on them.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUVMARY
 7 August 1958
 During the present Five-
 Year Plan (1958-1962), China ? s
 rate of population growth will
 probably remain fairly steady
 at the 2.5-percent rate at-
 tained in 1957.   Birth rates
 in urban areas may, in the lat-
 ter part of the period, show a
 slight tendency to drop.   But
 since only 15 percent of the
 total population  lives  in
 cities,   the over-all decline
 will be   minimal and  will
 be  offset  by  a  further
 slight  decrease  in  the
 death rate.

 There is no assurance that
 the present muted program will
 continue through the period of
 the present plan.   Economic
 failures would probably re-
 kindle a sense of urgency over
 the population problem and
 might encourage the regime to
 undertake strong measures--in-
 cluding sterilization and abor-
 tion.                      (Prepared
