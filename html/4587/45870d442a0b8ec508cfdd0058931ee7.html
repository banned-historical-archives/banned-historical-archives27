 tions on the Soviet Union's southwestern
 flank. Word leaked out that the U.S. and
 Egypt had conducted joint air exercises,
 and that the British had agreed to permit
 the U.S. Navy to beef up its depot on Diego
 Garcia in the Indian Ocean. In Washing-
 ton, the Pentagon was busily ironing out the
 last wrinkles in plans to acquire new mili-
 tary "facilities" in Kenya, Somalia and
 Oman. And in Peking, Defense Secretary
 Harold Brown and China's Deputy Prime
 Minister Deng Xiaoping were exploring
 new, "down-to-earth" ways of countering
 Russian expansionism in Asia.
 The assorted  military  maneuvering
 ranged from the China Sea to the Mediter-
 ranean (map), leading some to wonder
 Dinner was over, and the East Room at the
 White House grew quiet. The guests-80
 senior congressmen and senators--craned
 forward as Jimmy Carter began his brief-
 ing on Iran and Afghanistan. The Presi-
 dent sat in a Hepplewhite armchair, his
 foreign-policy counselors arrayed at his
 sides, a colored map of Southwest Asia on
 the easel at his back. Roughly 6,500 miles
 to the east, the 50 American hostages
 languishing at the U.S. Embassy in Tehe-
 ran were approaching their twelfth week in
 captivity. And just over the border in
 Afghanistan, 85,000 Soviet troops, looking
 very much like they meant to stay, were
 clearing the roads westward from Kabul
 toward the Iran border. So the President
 didn't mince any words last
 week. Looking at his guests,
 he said: "The Soviet invasion
 of Afghanistan is the greatest
 threat to peace since the sec-
 ond world war."
 The language was harsh and
 perhaps a bit hyperbolic; no
 Korea, Cuban missile crisis or
 Vietnam seemed at hand. But
 transfixed by the unraveling
 chaos  in  Southwest  Asia,
 the President clearly meant
 to change his approach to
 the Soviet Union. Along the
 U.S.S.R.'s southern periphery,
 he sketched the first outlines of
 a tough new posture. Last
 week Turkey agreed to let the

 whether Carter was dusting off Truman-
 Eisenhower-era notions of containment.
 Asked about that last week, a senior Ad-
 ministration official refused to coin a new
 catchword. "I don't want to talk about
 drawing lines or not drawing lines," he said.
 But the President did seem determined to
 put an end to America's Vietnam self-
 doubts and to counter the unchecked for-
 eign-policy adventures that have pushed
 the Soviet Union over the past five years
 from Angola to Ethiopia to Cambodia to
 Afghanistan. The most immediate casualty
 of the new get-tough strategy was Carter's
 once bright hope of putting arms control
 ahead of all the foreign-policy objectives.
 The sea change in Carter's world view
 promised to carry him farther
 away from what White House
 hard-liners deride as "the
 romantics" of the State De-
 partment toward the trust-no-
 Russians diplomacy favored
 by national-security adviser
 Zbigniew Brzezinski.
 S W IPES: The President's mani-
 fest intent was to encourage the
 Russians to think twice before
 adventuring any farther in
 Southwest Asia. Toward that
 end, he tightened his vise eco-
 nomically and diplomatical-

 Assembly, U.S. Ambassador

 troops from Afghanistan, a symbolic ges-
 ture if nothing else. In a second swipe at
 Soviet amour-propre, Carter encouraged
 speculation that the U.S. might boycott the
 Summer Olympics in Moscow, or try to
 move the Games to another country. He
 extended his trade embargo to all agricultur-
 al produce, not just grain; he suspended all
 licenses for technology exports
 pending a review of U.S.-Soviet
 relations. And his men let it be
 known that in the future he

 pressure if Soviet behavior grew significant-
 ly worse. Still, Tass dismissed his campaign
 as "a hopeless undertaking" bound "to
 flop"; and the Russians showed no inclina-
 tion to budge from consolidating their grip
 on Afghanistan (page 34). Soviet Ambassa-
 dor Oleg Troyanovsky also threatened to
 veto a U.S. resolution calling for U.N.
 sanctions against Iran, and the U.S. hos-
 tages remained imprisoned in Teheran
 (page 36). But for all the show of Russian
 defiance, the evidence suggested that lead-
 ers in the Politburo had underestimated
 Third World anger over the Afghanistan
 invasion-and Carter's own resolve. "They
 feel they have gained more than they lost,"
 said one candid Soviet source in Moscow.
 "But they lost more than they expected."
 A NEW COURSE: The President's long-range
 gamble was that his sanctions would work a
 change in the Kremlin's thinking-if the
 embargo lasted long enough. That depend-
 ed in part on the state of the Soviet economy
 and the whims of the Politburo, in part on
 it, they will withdraw and invite you to dine
 genially that same evening." That sense of
 suspicion led to the Truman Doctrine and
 the Marshall Plan and was borne out dur-
 ing the Cuban missile crisis. But as a policy,
 it collapsed during the late'60s. "The end of
 the global policy of containment came with
 Vietnam," says a Pentagon topsider. "The i
 public and Congress got fed up with the
 war; the trouble was, they got fed up with
 the policy, too."
 ARGUMENTS: The result, hard-liners con-
 tend, was to leave the Soviet Union unchal-
 lenged through a string of operations that
 ran from Czechoslovakia in 1968 to Af-
 ghanistan now. Henry Kissinger tried to
 slow the drift of things by demanding good
 behavior from Moscow in exchange for the
 benefits of detente: arms control, trade
 deals, technology sales. Rejecting "link-

 Coast Guard Vice Adm. Robert Scarborough maps the curb on Soviet fishing, a boycotted Russian ship in Baltimore
 maintained that detente did not bar the
 Soviet Union from helping "progressive"
 governments. abroad, a euphemism for
 crushing dissent in the Soviet bloc and fan-
 ning revolution in the Third World. Hawks
 now argue that with the fall of Saigon, the
 passing of Kissinger and the arrival of Presi-
 dent Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus
 Vance, the last vestiges of linkage disap-
 peared: the Soviets dispatched their Cuban
 surrogates to the Horn of Africa, their
 North Vietnamese allies to Cambodia-and
 their tanks to the streets of Kabul.
 The problem all along has been to find a
 way to counter such aggressive thrusts,
 without risking a nuclear Armageddon.
 The Administration was trying not to use
 the cold-war buzzword "containment" to
 describe its objectives. "The basic reality of
 our policy remains the same," Brzezinski
 insisted. But he added: "It's important to
 contain Moscow's expansive drives, and
 this has now become a more urgent issue."
 Brzezinski uses the word "contestation" to
 describe the emerging U.S.-Soviet relation-
 ship in the 1980s. The outlook for increas-
 ing strain in the years ahead contributed to
 the Administration's decision to increase
 the U.S. defense budget by an average,
 after-inflation 5 per cent during each of the
 next five years; to install a new generation
 of medium-range nuclear missiles in Eu-
 rope, and to build a rapid-deployment force
 of 100,000 troops for quick action in flash
 points like the Persian Gulf.
 TOUR: Even before the Afghanistan inva-
 sion, the U.S. policy of evenhandedness to-
 ward the Russians and Chines was in tat-
 ters,but Secretary ofDefense Harold Brown
 tilted further toward Peking last week.
 Brown's eight-day trip was the first visit by
 an American Secretary of Defense to China
 since the Communists took over in 1949. "If
 somebody told you a year ago you would be
 walking through a Chinese submarine yard
 with a U.S. Secretary of Defense, you
 wouldn't have believed it," chuckled one
 member of Brown's party during a tour of
 the Wuchang boatyard in Wuhan. Brown
 spent hours conferring with Deputy Prime
 Minister Deng, Foreign Minister Huang
 Hua and Chairman Hua Guofeng. He
 toured the Great Wall; he peered into an
 aging tank of China's Sixth Armored Divi-
 sion. "Have you ever been abroad?" a mem-
 ber of his party asked one Chinese tank offi-
 cer. "Yes-to fight in Korea," the officer re-
 plied, adding quickly, "But that is history."
 The trip's main value was a symbolic
 warning to the Russians that- the Soviet
 Union's eastern flank was badly exposed;

 but at least one intriguing deal was closed.
 The U.S. agreed to sell the Chinese a
 ground station for the Landsat-D earth-
 surveillance satellite, which has tape re-
 corders and computers that could have
 military applications. The Chinese quickly
 agreed not to put them to any such use, but
 the sale of advanced technology to China at
 a time when the lid is on with Russia could
 hardly be missed in Moscow. The U.S. may
 respond to further Russian challenges by
 increasing technology transfers to China. A
 final trump is direct arms sales. U.S. offi-
 cials insisted that the subject of such. sales
 didn't come up during the trip, but did not
 rule them out in the future. "They are
 probably only a matter of time," said one
 U.S. official.
 At the other end of the Muslim world,
 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israe-
 li Prime Minister Menachem Begin wound
 up a four-day summit in Aswan as far apart
 as ever on autonomy for the Palestinians-
 but with a sense of common cause against
 the Soviet Union. Egypt vowed to show
 support for the U.S. by reducing the 300-
 man contingent of Russian diplomats and
 technicians in the country, cutting ties with
 Syria and Marxist South Yemen and throw-
 ing open camps to train Afghan insurgents
 to fight the Russians. Both Egypt and Israel
 publicly offered to let the U.S. use military
 facilities on their soil. The U.S. politely
 declined, in part to protect Sadat against
 Arab outrage and in part to avoid stirring
 up the Muslim world over. Israel.
 LEAKS: As it turned out, the U.S. had been
 using Egyptian facilities secretly for some
 time. In Washington and Jerusalem, word
 leaked out that Egypt and the U.S. had
 conducted joint air exercises last month i
 from an air base near Luxor on the Nile. By
 one report-quickly denied all around-the
 aircraft were high-altitude American SR-71

 reconnaissance planes, overflying the Mid-
 dle East and the Persian Gulf. Egypt's De-
 fense Minister Kamal Hassan Ali said the
 planes were American AWACS command
 and control jets, served by about 120 ground
 personnel. Crammed with sophisticated
 electronic scanning gear, the planes can
 detect fighters and ships more than 230
 miles away or direct a naval blockade-
 handy resources if Iran deteriorates into
 armed conflict. All conceded that the exer-
 cises were "to make it easier for the air forces
 of the United States to cross over our skies,
 and to land at our bases."
 DIEGO GARCIA: To make it easier to patrol
 the Indian Ocean, a new zone of competi-
 tion with the Soviet Union, the U.S. also
 had plans to beef up its base on the tiny,
 British-owned island of Diego Garcia. Brit-
 ish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
 defense position with help from Turkey and
 Pakistan. With the Soviet Union flexing its
 muscles, and with the government in Anka-
 ra a bit weak on its legs, Turkey agreed to let
 the U.S. stay in 26 bases temporarily until a
 final understanding can be drawn up. Paki-
 stan posed a more difficult problem. For one
 thing, Congress has banned military aid to
 the Pakistanis, who are alleged to be build-
 ing a nuclear bomb; for another, a Pakistani
 mob killed two Americans and torched the
 U.S. Embassy in Islamabad seven weeks
 ago. To mend fences and discuss arms, Paki-
 stan's President Muhammad Zia ul-Haq
 sent Agha Shahi, his foreign-policy adviser,
 to Washington for talks with Carter.
 The U.S. President was set on pushing
 arms for Pakistan, and perhaps even ex-
 ploring ways of funneling weapons to Af-
 ghan insurgents surreptitiously. Given the
 recent U.S. embarrassments in the region,
 Congress was more likely to countenance
 way they did," said one high-ranking U.N.
 officer. "It was really antediluvian, an
 eighteenth-century imperialist move." The
 corridors and the delegates' lounge even
 began rumbling with rumors that Soviet
 Ambassador Oleg Troyanovsky had had
 doubts about the wisdom of the invasion.
 McHenry's tactics called for keeping the
 U.S. in the background while the Third
 World carried the battle to the Soviet'
 Union. In the Security Council, six Third
 World nations sponsored a resolution call-
 ing for the withdrawal of all foreign troops
 from Afghanistan-without mentioning
 the U.S.S.R. by name. Troyanovsky called
 the tame measure "a flagrant intervention
 in the internal affairs of a sovereign state"
 and vetoed it. Mexico and the Philippines'
 then sponsored a "Uniting for Peace" reso-
 lution-a procedural device first used to
 side-step a Russian veto during the Korean
 War. That ploy took the measure to the
 veto-proof General Assembly.
 As one country after another
 rose at the U.N. to denounce the
 Russian invasion, a quiet sense of
 triumph settled over the Ameri-
 can Mission. "The Russians are
 being shown .up for what they
 are-aggressive, expansionist, a
 power Third Worlders and every-
 one else have to be wary of," said
 an American diplomat. A West
 European ambassador agreed.
 "The Afghanistan situation may
 have revived nonalignment in its
 true sense," he said. "Before,
 there was a lot of pro-Soviet nona-
 lignment. I think Afghanistan has
 opened some eyes. Maybe nona-
 lignment will become nonalign-
 ment again."
 'WILL':  President Carter also
 moved ahead on a third major
 front-lining up U.S. allies be-
 hind his program of sanctions
 against the Soviet Union. He
 worked the phones; he twisted
 arms; he was encouraged by his'

 promised Carter than the British would

 Somalia, Oman and Kenya have also
 shown interest in granting the U.S. military
 facilities. None of the prospective sites was
 ideal. In return for the use of an old (and
 unfinished) Soviet base at Berbera, the So-
 malis will probably demand U.S. weapons,
 including F- 15 fighters, for their border war
 with Soviet-backed Ethiopia. The commer-
 cial port of Mombasa ip Kenya is so far from
 the gulf that some Pentagon officials wonder
 whether it's worth much. Oman, controlled

 sure, could turn into a miniature Iran. "All
 of these should be handled with some care,"
 cautioned one U.S. official. "The U.S.
 shouldn't let its press releases get ahead of
 its policy."
 U.S. strategists counted on shoring up the
 eastern and western flanks of a forward U.S.
 covert operations than in the past. It
 seemed possible that Congress would re-
 peal the Hughes-Ryan amendment, which
 has effectively blocked secret missions by
 requiring the CIA to report to no fewer
 than eight separate Congressional commit-
 tees first. In recent weeks, patience has
 worn thin around the Hill for the long,
 thoughtful process of intelligence review
 and. oversight that Carter himself advocat-
 ed when he first took office.
 'ANTEDILUVIAN: The second major compo-
 nent of America's get-tough strategy was a
 full-scale diplomatic campaign designed to
 persuade the Third World that the Soviet
 Union had shown its true colors in Afghani-
 stan. At the U.N., U.S. Ambassador Don-
 ald F. McHenry energetically sought to
 portray the Russian invasion as a threat to
 the security of all Third World nations. He
 had a 'good deal of success. "I'm amazed
 that the Soviets went into Afghanistan the
 first results. Canada, Australia and the
 European Common Market all agreed not
 to make up the Soviet Union's 17 million-;
 metric-ton shortfall in grain. And when a
 West German reporter testily asked White
 House press secretary Jody Powell what
 might be accomplished "by destroying the
 American economy piece by piece," Powell
 replied confidently: "The American econo-
 my and the economy of Western Europe
 can easily withstand the sacrifice. The situ-
 ation that confronts the free world is not a'
 question of ability-it's a question of will."
 The key question was whether the allies
 would choose to sell the Soviet. Union the
 very technology that Carter had put under
 embargo. The main concern was that, as
 happened after the 1968 Czechoslovakian
 invasion, business would return to nor-
 mal within a few months. The allies
 universally lent their moral support to the
 President's campaign. But in practice,

 Afghan demonstrators march in New York: Hoping to stop the Soviets at Kabul
 Japan was not eager for a showdown with
 Moscow, and many Western European
 leaders seemed to put a higher premium
 upon detente than upon sanctions. France
 and West Germany made it clear that they
 would not impose sanctions on Moscow
 that -might hurt their own economies. A -
 top French official complained privately
 that his country's position "smacks of
 Munich." Despite their condemnation of
 Soviet aggression, many West Europeans
 did not want to force an East-West
 showdown on their own continent. "You
 cannot win in Berlin what you lost in
 Afghanistan," said a senior West German
 official.
 CASKETS: Outwardly, the Soviet Union
 seemed optimistic about riding out any
 boycott. "Marxism understands capitalism
 better than you do," one Soviet analyst told
 an American acquaintance. "For most
 Western countries, it is more difficult to
 refuse to sell to us than not to; we are very
 good buyers." Even so, Moscow seemed
 surprised and puzzled by the furor over
 Afghanistan. For ordinary Russians, the
 shortage of information about the fighting
 provoked anxieties and hurt morale. Mos-
 cow churned with rumors of high, casual-
 ties; there were report? of a shortage of
 metal caskets-all the available ones hav-
 ing been shipped to the front. "IQ's not like
 Czechoslovakia, which most people here
 knew about," said one troubled Soviet intel-
 lectual. "Nobody knows anything about
 Afghanistan. It's far away, and it's difficult
 to understand why Soviet boys are dying
 there."
 The Soviets' underestimation of the
 Western and Third World reaction to the
 invasion led some diplomats to wonder
 who was really in charge of Moscow. From
 Bonn to Washington, there was specula-
 tion that Brezhnev, 73 and ailing, had been
 outvoted by hard-liners within the Politbu-
 ro. Experienced Kremlinologists doubted
 it. A believer in consensus politics, Brezh-
 nev has always avoided putting himself out
 on Politburo limbs. He is -a blunt, aggres-
 sive man close to the Soviet Union's own
 military-industrial complex, and he spon-
 sored the move into Czechoslovakia in
 1968. In Moscow, some diplomats specu-
 lated that with the Afghanistan imbroglio
 heating up, there might be pressure to
 replace Brezhnev, who can no longer work
 ten-hour days. U.S. strategists hoped that
 Carter's military and economic measures
 would prod a post-Brezhnev generation of
 Russian leaders to rethink the Brezhnev
 doctrine-and the politics of massive
 intervention.
 PARANOIA: That hope may he a bit naive.
 Since the time of the czars, the Russians h ave
 tried to expand beyond their borders, devel-
 oping their own domino theory along the
 way. Client states are held at all costs. As the
 theory runs, an unchecked uprising in Af-
 ghanistan could invite more trouble in Po-
 land, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, perhaps
 even the Ukraine and among the 30-million-
 plus Muslims along the Soviet Union's
 southern borders(following story). This tra-
 ditional defensiveness, bordering on para-
 noia, may have prompted the Afghanistan
 invasion. A darker scenario saw the Soviets
 working on a grand design that would put
 their fighter planes within easy striking
 distance of the Strait of Hormuz. While
 Afghanistan -represented a watershed in
 Jimmy Carter's perceptionsand foreign pol-
 icy, it was probably just an extension of
 classic Soviet policy: grab and hold.
 Carter's get-tough strategy will not
 change things overnight. Pessimists say the
 sanctions won't work at all; optimists
 maintain that the troubled state of the
 Soviet economy has given the President an
 advantage. The CIA now believes that
 Moscow's $1 trillion economy has entered
 a recessionary mode with serious problems
 o energy and labor shortages and sluggish
 productivity that could last a decade. The
 Afghanistan expeditionary force will re-
 quire the diversion of scarce transport,
 fuel, high-quality steel, chemicals and tex-
 tiles from other uses. "The Soviets will
 have an increasing problem allocating
 their resources," predicted an East-West
 trade expert in Moscow. "There already,
 are strains imposed by running two sepa-
 rate economies-the military and the
 civilian."
 HoGS: The President's embargo on the
 feed grains and technology, limited though
 it was, could yet tip this already delicate
 balance. The Soviets appeared taken aback
 by the toughness of the grain embargo; the
 U.S. had continued to ship grain to Iran,
 and the Soviets believed Carter would not
 risk angering farmers on the eve of the Iowa
 caucuses. Now, for want of feed grains, the
 Soviets will probably have to slaughter
 hogs, poultry and beef, producing a long-
 range crisis in meat and milk production
 and a setback for the Politburo's standing
 promise to improve the country's meager
 diet. The embargo on oil-rig machinery also
 was likely to hurt, since the Soviet Union
 has been plagued with a marked fall-off in
 petroleum production.
 If Carter's new get-tough strategy doesn't
 work, even more steely measures may lie
 ahead. The worst-case scenarios for South-
 west Asia were unsettling: that the Soviets
 might cross the Afghan border into Pakistan
 under the pretext of chasing Afghan insur-
 gents; that Iran might fall - into civil
 war, inviting a Russian march into Iranian
 Azerbaijan; that Moscow would violate the
 gentleman's understanding to observe
 SALT II, touching off a new arms race.
 Given the risks, themost sensible course was
 to save the toughest U.S. options--restoring
 the draft, for example, or canceling the
 existing grain-sale agreement-for later.
 "We are not burying detente; we are not at
 war," said State Department spokesman
 Hodding Carter. "Much hinges on the
 future action of the Russians." If those
 actions don't improve, the President may
 eventually be forced to reconsider the kind
 of containment Harry Truman and Joseph
 Stalin understood so well.
