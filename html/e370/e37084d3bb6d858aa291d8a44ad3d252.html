					   	[Text]    	The  armored  division's  two  mechanized  regiments  are  its  multi-
					  	purpose  elements.    	They  each  have  a  powerful  array  of  antiCank  weapons,
					   	their  own  organic  reconnai~sance  and  support  units  and  are  capable  of
					   	conducting  a  wide  variety  of  operations.without  reinforcement.    	They  are
	     	i			    	always  employed  as  part  of  the  division,    	That  employment  uaually  involves
	     	;			    	preparing  and  facilitating  the  employment  of  the  division's  tank  regiments
	     	i			    	and  completing  their  action.    	The  mechanized  regiments'   	capability  to  per-
					   	form  this  mission  was  recently  substantially  enhanced  through  reorganiza-
	     	;			    	tion  and  such  new  equipment  as  the  AI~QC30   	[battle  tank],  AM}C10  [armored
	     	I			    	personnel  carrier],  VAB   	[Forward  Area  Armored  Vehicle],  Milan  [antitank		    	~
	     	!			    	missile],   	120~-mm  mortars,   	89-mm  LRAC  [antitank  rocket  launcher~,  FAMAS
	     	,			     	[5.56-mm  assault  rifleJ,   	etc.    	The  mechanized  regiment's  power  and  its
					   	effectiveness  in  a  meeting  engag ~nent  with  enemy  armor  stem  especially
					   	from  its  two  AI~C30  tank  companies~    	This  means  that  in  coping  with  the
	     	~			    	major  threat,  namely  the  armored  threat,   	the  armored  division's  cotmnanding
	     	!			    	general  will  be  able  to  retain  longer  and  more  often  his  tank  regiments
	     	'			     	for  employment   	in  the  more  decisive  phases  of  an  operation.
					   	Forces  Tailored  to  Missions
					   	The  mechanized  regiment  is  organized  into:
	     	,			    	a.    	'I~ao  mechanized  companies  equipped  with  AM~C-10's.    	Each  company  has		     	~

					 	necesaitatea  employmenC  of  infantrymen  on  foot  and  with  aupporting  fire
	   	I			     	from  the  tanks.    	But  the  relatively  small  number  of  dismounted  infantrymen	     	�
	   	~			     	the  regimenC  can  provide--about  250--limits  ita  capabilities  in  such
	   	~			     	operations.
	   	I
	   	~			     	In  summary,   	therefore,   	the  mechanized  regiment~  heavily  armed  with  anti-
	   	i			     	tank  weapons,   	can  conduct  shock-action  producing  attacks  day  and  night
	   	j			     	against  point  targets.    	When  it  is  absolutely  necessary  to  employ  the
					 	regiment's  infantrymen  in  a  dismounCed  role,   	they  are    	dismounted  as  close
	   	!			     	to  the  ob3ective  as  possible  and  supported  by  all  available  weapons.    	Thia
	   	~			     	is  the  only  way  to  maintain  the  tempo  suited  to  the  armored  division.
	   	;			     	Single  Mission
	   	'			     	The  mechanized  regiment,   	suppor.ted  by  artillery  and  usually  reinforced
					 	with  an  engineer  unit,   	is  generally  employed  in  the  first   	(attack)   	echelon
					 	with  a  single  mission.    	This  mission  may  be:
					  	a.    	In  the  offense:    	gather  tactical  intelligence,   	seek  and  destroy  the
					  	enemy's  antitank  weapon  systems;
					  	b.    	In  the  defense:    	slow  up  the  enemy's  advance  by  delaying  action,
					  	counterattacks,   	and  if  required,  establish  a  defense  in  place.
	 	-					Its  scheme  of  maneuver  is  essentially  mobile  and  characterized  by  brief
					  	and  repeated  atta~ks  or  swe.eps.    	The  mane~iver  develops  rapidly  while
					  	remaining  bound  to  the  terrain  as  closely  as  possible.    	The  regiment
					  	engages  the  enemy  on  a  front  of  some  5  to  6  kilometers  in  a  zone  of
					  	action  which  often  extends  from  12  kilometers  in  width.
					  	In  combat,   	it  usually  deploys  homogeneous  units  operating  within  compart-
					  	ments  of  terrain  suited  to  their  weaponry,  but  it  can  deploy  mixed  units
					  	commensurate  with  the  mission  and  terrain,   	for  instance,  on  the  approach
					  	march  and  in  combat  within  wooded  or  urban  areas.

					 	[ArCicle  by  Colonel  Rene  Soulier,   	commanding  officer,   	9th  Engineer  Regiment,
						6Ch  Armored  Division:    	"Help  our  Mobility,  Hinder  the  Enemy's"]
					 	[Text]    	Turning  to  his  engineer  officer,   	the  division  commander  asks  him:
					 	"What  support  can  the  engineer  furnish  the  scheme  of  maneuver  I  have
						~ust  formulated?"
						This  question  could  be  viewed  as  a  sign  of  concern  or  condescension,
						depending  on  the  mood  of  the  division  engineer  officer~    	Actually,   	the
					 	question  would  reflect  a  purely  intellectual  a~titude  which  holds  that
					 	the  action  of  a  combat  support  element  is  merely  ~uxtaposed  with  the
					 	action  of  the  infantry-armor  combined  arms  team.
					 	The  real  procedure  is  altogether  different.    	In  fact,   	if  an  optimum
					 	economy  of  force  operaCion  is  desired,   	ft  is  essential  to  integrate
					 	engineer  action  into  the  scheme  of  maneuver  in  the  same  way  as  the  action
					 	of  other  combat  arms,   	and  do  thfs  during  the  plann3ng  stage.
	  	;			     	The  armored  division's  effectiveness  depends  essentially  on  the  rapidity
	  	'			     	with  which  it  maneuvers,   	its  firepower  and  its  ability  to  change  posture
					 	frequently.    	These  characteristics  cannot  be  fully  effective  unless
					 	throughout  the  period  of  combat  operations  the  division  retains  its
					 	freedom  of  movement  while  the  enemy's  freedom  is  impeded.
					 	Consequently  the  armored  division  engineer  regiment's  two  primary  missions
	  	~			     	are:    	help  enhance  the  division's  mobility,   	and  take  measures  to  hinder
					 	the  enemy's  mobi~i.ty.    	Its  organization  was  designed  on  the  basis  of
	  	~			     	its  equipment  which  gives  it  new  capabflities  fnffnitely  greater  than

	  	,					small  obstacles   	(heavy  equipment  is  maintained  at  corps  level),  on  the		    	-
	  	;					other  hand,   	the  regiment's  route  clearing  and  repair  capabiLities  are
	  	I					substiantial  in  that  Chere  are  28  ma~or  items  of  equipment  capable  of  doin~
	  	~					such  work:    	16  EBG's,   	four  grader  tanks   	(with  bulldozer  blades),   	and
	  	~					eight  MPG's.
					 	The  high~speed  drills~  the  mtne  "buXie~r~'"  ~nQ  "dispensers,"  are  all  highly
	  	i					efficient  machines  which  give  the  regiment  a  most  satisfactory  obstacle
					  	consCruction  capability.
     	y~~					Although  the  engineer  regiment  allocates  all  of  its  resources  to  helping
	  	;					enhance   	the  division's  mobility,   	it  can  also  operate  simultaneously:
					  	a.    	In  the  forward  area:    	to  clear  the  six  to  eight  routes  necessary  to  Che
					  	advance  of   	two  to  three  armored  or  mechanized  regiments.
					 	b.    	In  the  rear  area:    	to  repair  or  maintain  Cwo  to  four  main  supply
	  	i					routes  within  the  armored  division's  zone  of  responaibility.
	  	i
					 	With  its  obstacle  crossing  capabilities,   	the  regiment  caii  restore  Class  40
					  	crossings  over  eight  short  gaps.    	This  class  of  bridging  is  sufficient
					  	to  carry all  the div'ision'sauthorized  equipment.    	The  regiment's  crossing
					 	capabilities  are  greater  for  lower  class  vehicles.    	The  authorized
	  	I			     	MLF  equipment  allows  some  50  Class  14  vehicles  to  cross  within  1  hour.
	  	'			     	Employed  as  a  bridge  over  an  obstacle  with  a  maximum  width  of  90  meCers,
					  	it  can  handle  an  average  traffic  flow  of  150  Class  20  vehicles  per  hour.
					 	As  for   	impeding  the  enemy's  mobility,   	the  engineer  regiment  can  attach  its
	  	'					two  armored  companies  to  the  lead  regiments.    	These  companies  can  then
					 	assume  responsibility  for  construcCion  of  point  obstacles   	(mined  road
					 	blocks,   	abatis)   	on  eight  routes  simultaneously.    	It  can  establish  obstacles
	  	'					in  line  or  in  ~rea  patterns   	toward  ~he  rear  for  a  defense  fn  place  or  on
	  	~			     	a  flank  to  cover  the  division.    	As  an  example,   	in  1  hour,   	the  mechanized
					 	company,  reinforced  with  the  six  mine-laying  machines,  can  lay  a  2,000-meter
					 	strip  having  a  density  of  1.2.
					 	Lastly,   	the  regiment's  earth-moving  machinery  can  perform  certain  organiza-
					 	tion  of   	the  ground  tasks  of  limited  scope,   	such  as  preparing  field
	  	~			     	fortifications  and  gun  emplacements  on  the  final  protective  line,   	for
	  	;			     	example.    	The  regiment  can  also  form  assault  teams  armed  with  special-
	  	,			     	purpose  weapons   	(flamethrowers,   	special  explosives)   	trained  to  participate

			   	whenever  ma~or  planning  and  operational  decisions  are  being  made.    	Tn  fact,

			   	capab ilities  Caken  inCo  c.onsideration  and  incorporated  in  the  scheme  of
			   	m~neuver.
			   	One  example  will  suffice  ro   	illuatrate  this  principle.    	Assume  that  the
			   	scheme  of  maneuver  adopted  by  Che  division  requires  holding  an  aggressive
			   	enemy  on  a  final  protecCive   	line  for  a  definite  period  of  time  and  that
			    	Chis  operation  necessitates   	the  employment  of  two  armored  or  mechanized
			   	regiments.   	By  improving  the  defensive  strength  of  the  area  wiCh  the			     	�
			   	mechanized  engineer  company  reinforced  by  obsCacle  building  and  earth~
			   	moving  personnel  and  equipment,   	it  is  possible,  providing  there  is
			    	sufficient  time,   	to  employ  only  one  regimenC,   	and  the  second  regiment
			    	can  thus  be  assigned  to  another  operation.    	Hence  the  engineer  regiment's
			   	work  makes  a  greater  economy  of  force  possible  and,   	thereFore,   	constitutes
			    	an  importanC  component  of  the  division's  scheme  of  maneuver~
			    	The  engineer  commander  deploys  his  troops  and  equipment   	in  conformity  with
			    	the  priorities  assigned  him.    	It  must  be  realized,  however,   	that  the
			    	regiment's  units  are  "preoriented"  because  of  the  very  nature  of  their
			    	equipment:    	Che  armored  companies  will  be  chiefly  employed  in  direct
			    	support  of  the  forNard   	re~iments   	whereas  the~mecfiRn~zed  company  will
			    	raCher  operate  farther  back  in  the  division  area.
			    	To  give  a  quite  simple  illustration,   	the  following  deployment  and  missions
			    	of   	the  regiment's  units  are  highly  conceivable:
			    	a.    	One  armored  company  is  attached  to  the  leading  regiments  with  the
			    	mission  of :
			    	1.    	In  the  offense:    	facilitating  Cheir  advance  by  clearing  routes;
			     	2.    	In  the  defense:    	supporting  the  delaying  action  by  emplacing  point
			     	obstacles.																			 	-
			     	b.    	The  mechanized  company  is  told  to  await  further  orders  and  will  most
			     	likely  be  assigned  such  missions  as:
			     	1.    	Repair  and  maintenance  of  divisional  lines  of  communication;
			     	2.    	Establish  obstacle  areas  (barriers)   	in  the  division  rear  or  on  a

					    	The  armored  division  engineer  regiment's  action  is  largely  forward-area
					    	oriented  in  support  of   	the  division's  scheme  of  maneuver.    	However,   	the
					    	division  cannot  be  entirely  self-sufficient.
					    	In  particular,   	for  the  crossing  of  large  obstacles,   	the  corps  will  have  to
					    	either  reinforce  the  division  with  the  necessary  troops  and  equipment  or
					    	take  over  all  or  part  of  the  crossing  mission.
					    	Furthermore,   	Che  corps  will  often  have  to  coordinate  its  barrier  plan  with

					    	The  gathering  of  terrain  intelligence  is  the  responsibility  of  all  arms

					    	intelligence  is  one  of  the  responsibilities  of  the  engineer  commander
		 	;			    	at  each  level  of  command.    	The  synthesis  of  such  intelligence  will  enable
		 	~			    	the  combined  arms  commander  to  take  the  terrain  factor  into  account  in
		 	!			    	fozznulating  his  scheme  of  maneuver.
		 	i
					    	The  task  of  gathering  technical  intelligence  is  assigned  particularly  to
		 	~			    	the   	three  DLRG's   	(Engineer  Liaison  and  Reconnaissance  Detachment)  deployed
		 	;			    	as  far  forward  as  possible.
		 	~
					    	The  continuous  effort  to  obtain  greaCer  efficiency,   	and  the  priority  given
					    	to  the  support  of  forward  units  made  it  necessary  to  extensively  mechanize
		 	,			    	the  armored  division  engineer  regimenC's  units.    	In  a  brief,  sudden,  and
		 	~			    	hard-hitting  engagement,   	the  regiment's  action  will  always  be  governed  by
		 	'			    	the  principle  of  rapid  reaction  snd  execution  at  the  expense  of  the
					    	lasting  character  of  whatever  it  builds,  repairs,  emplaces,  etc.

					    	With  the  advice  of  his  engineer  officer,   	and  by  employing  the  engineer
		 	~			   	regiment's  capabilities  to  their  maximum,   	the  commanding  general  of  the
					    	armored  division  will  be  able  to  retain  his  freedom  of  action  as  far  as
		 	~			   	mobility  is  concerned,  while  at  the  same  time  thwarting  his  adver~ary's
					    	mobility.

			   	'		(Text]    	In  his  historical  novPl,  "August  i4  "  Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn  quiee
				  	properly  notes  that,  unknown  t~  the  belligerents,   	the  beginning  of  the  Great
				  	War  marked  the  advent  of  a  new  zodiacal  era.

				   	the  great  writer,  wiCh  the  clarification  that  for  us  thia  era  is  one  of
				   	total  strategy.
				  	As  a  matter  of  Pact,   	64  years  ago  the  leaders  of  the  two  camps  thought  they
				  	were  confronting  a  classiEal  war  for  which  they  congidered  themgelvee   	to
				  	be  normally,   	intellectually  and  materially  ready.    	It  could  not  occur  to
				   	them  that  "the  goin~,  to  extremes,"  described  by  Clausewitz  and  accepted  by
				   	the  varioue  war  colleges,  was  not  going  to  be  limited  to  voilence  in  the
				   	purely  military  sector  and  that  the  conflict  was  to  degenerate  rather
				   	quickly  into  a  total  war.    	No  one--not  event  the  strategisCsiof  the  Germaa
				   	General  Staff--was  in  a  position,  in  1914,   	to  imagine  the  essence  of  this
				   	inexpiable  confrontation  which  ignored  all  the  prohibitions  and  set  its
				   	sights  on  the  annihilation  of  Che  enemy  as  a"collective  self"  by  striking
				   	at   	(civilian]  populations  in  the  same  Way  as  at  his  armed  forces,  by  under-
				  	mining  national  cohesior  and  by  reopening  the  question  of  Che  foundations
				   	of  his  political-administrative  order.
				   	How  could  it  have  been  foreaeen  at  the  time  that  this  total  ~ar,  among  other
				   	things,  was  going  to  facilitate  the  appearance  of  an  original  phenomenon:
				   	Leninist-Marxist  totalitarianiam  which,  building  on  the  rubble  of  the  former
				   	Russian  Empire,  was  to  formulate  and  implement  a  total  strategy  imposing  upon
				   	the  rest  of  the  worid  a  permanent  conflict  whose  most  dramatic  episode  is
				   	probably  World  War  II  and  upon  which  the  nuclear  reality  was  subsequently
				   	to  confer  a  new  and  agonizing  dimension.
				   	The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  unfortunately--for  reasons  that  we  will  aet  forth
				   	later--there  is  very  little  interest  in  our  timea  in  the  nature  of  this  total

		    	Today,   	iC   	is  obvious  eo  a  serious  hisCorian  that,  withoue  the  unleashing  of
		     	totul  war  from  1914  eo  1917,   	efie  Bolshevik  putgch  of  November  1917  would
		     	have  been  unChinkable  in  Russia~    	On  the  oCher  hand,   	it  is  less  obvious  for
		     	u  lgrge  nvmber  of  apecialists  tliar  ~t  was  equally  tfie  total  cliaracter  of
		     	World  War  I  which,   	in  great  measure,   	influenced  the  specific  characteristica
	  	"	   	of  Leninist-Marxist  totalitarianism,   	facilitated  rlie  victory  of  the  Reda  in
		     	ehe  civil  war  and  conditioned  the  elaboration  of  the  Bolshevik  total  atrategy.
		     	In  support  of  these  staCements,   	let  us  recall  first  the  easential  characteris-
		     	tics  of  total  war.    	The  passing  of  clxssical  war  into  total  war  was  effe~ted
		     	at  one  and  the  same  time  thanks  to  the  cumulative  utilization  of  the  various
		     	aspec[s  of  technical  progress  in  the  military  sector,  properly  speaking,  and
		     	the  incorporation in  the  strategic  package  of  all  the  other  resources:
		     	psychological,  economic,    	financial,   	scientific  and  technical,  envisaged
		     	henceforth  not  only  as  auxiliaries  of  the  armed  forcea  but  also  as  weapons
		     	per  se.
		     	A  double  process  was  to  resule  therefrom,   	in  appearance  a  contradictory
		     	process  of  diversification  of  multiple  forms  o!  war,  each  having  its  own
		     	characreristics,  and  of  integration  of  the  latter  in  a  totality  to  the  degree
		     	that  a  total  wgr  was  involved.    	Thus  it  is  that  in  the  military  sector  we  see
		     	added  to  the  classical  concepts  of  ground  and  naval  warfare  those  of  air  and
		     	sub;narine  warfare,  not  Co  mention  the  subdivision  of  ground  warfare  into
		     	categories  which  at  times  are  questionable,  such  as  trench,  movement,  atCri-
		     	tion  or  even  "gas"  warfare.    	As  for  the  nonmilitary  means,   	they  give  rise  to
		     	psychological,  economic,  etc.  warfare.    	From  another  standpoint,   	the  integra-
		     	tion  of  all   	these  forms  of  warfare,   	required  by  the  mandatory  on~nesa  of
		     	purpose  of  the  very  notion  of  total  war--variously  achieved,  moreover,
		     	according  to  the  countries--implied  a  new  approach  to  tfie  phenomenon  which
		     	was  summed  up  by  Clemenceau's  jesC:    	"War  is  too  serious  a  matter  to  entrust
		     	to  the  military."    	Of  course,  within  this  totality  tending  in  tfie  direction

		     	Europe  and  the  ill-considered  vse  of  the  Red  Army  as  the  vangard  of  the
		     	r~volution  on  the  march  was  abandoned.    	A  totally  new  etrategy  was  developed.
		     	'Cl~is  indirecC  revolutionary  atrategy  was  placed  in  operation  from  1921  to
		     	1929.    	It  was  based  on  the  following  view  of  the  a~orld:
		     	--the  capitalist  countries  are  not  ripe  for  socialist  revolntion  because  of
		-	    	the  fact  of  their  colonial  empires.    	The  plundering  of  colonial  wealtfi
		     	furnishes  super-~enefits  permiCting  tfie  capitalists  to  gi've  small  increasea
		     	to  the  workers,   	the  better  paid  of  whom  become  middle  cl~ss  and  lose  their			     	'
		     	class  consciousness.
		     	Consequently,  it  was  a  question  of  aiding  the  colonial  or  dependent  countries
		     	to  free  themselves  from  tFie  impeYialtst  yoke  to  restore  the  will  to  struggle
		     	to  the  proletariat.
		     	Moreover,   	the  very  existence  of  a  proletar~an  state  constitutes  for  world
		     	capitalism  a  danger  which  it  cannot  tolerate,  aBove  all  if  the  state  is
		     	successful  in  delivering  appreciaBle  blows  against  tfie  i~rperialist  system.
		     	Because  of  this  fact,  an  attack  by  the  forces  ot  capitalism  aimed  at
		     	destruction  of  the  proletarian  state  is  irevitable  over  tfie  ~aore  or  less
		     	long  term.    	It  is  important  tfiat  this  evencuality  be  delayed  as  long  as
		     	possible  by  undermining  tfie  foundations  of  the  enemy's  system,  by  thoroughly
		     	exploiting  its  contradictions,  by  demoralizing  its  armed  forces  and  by
		     	mobilizing  the  proletariat  so  that  on  the  day  the  inevitable  attack  takea
		     	place,   	such  an  attack  will  be  nothing  more  than  "the  reflex  of  a  mortally
		     	wnunded  beast,"  the  prelude  to  tfie  ~inal  victory  of  the  proletarian  canip.

				    	it   	is   	too  "civilian"  for  the  latter  who  call  it  "subversive  action."
				    	Both  of  them  have  stuck  by  Clausewitz  and  continue  to  distinguisfi  peace-
				    	time  from  wartime,  without  understanding  that  the  Kremlin  is  seeking  to
				    	transform  "peace"  into  a  new  kind  of  total  war.    	In  the  psycho-polttical
				    	sector,   	this  "war"  gives  rise,  however,   	to  a  strange  phenomenon:    	the
				    	appearance  here  and  there  of  ultranationalisC  movements  "of  tfie  left"  which
				    	will  subsequently  be  dubbed  "of  the  right"  for  the  purposes  of  the  cause.
				    	In  Italy,   	a  movement  of  this  kind  went  so  far  in  1922  as  to  se~ze  power
				    	and  radicalize  the  ICalian  monarchy.    	In  Germany,  on  the  other  hand,  an
				    	attempted   	puCsch   	fomented  by  the  small  party  of  one  Adolph  Hitler  failed

				    	of  the  new  chief  of  the  Kuomintang:    	Gen  Chang  Kai-shek.

		     	movement,   	finalLy  came  up  wieh  ehe  definitive  formula  for  a  total  strategy					;
		     	which  was  much  more  that  of  an  empire  with  universaliaC  aspiraCions  Chan
				that  of  a  revolutionary  proleCarian  state.
		     	Stalin,  ~ust  Che  opposiCe  of  Lenin,  was  much  more  a  monomaniac  of  abaolute
		     	powerz  than  of  revoluCion.    	The  USSR,  of  which  he  was  at  one  and  the  same
				Cime  the  god,  pontifical  sovereign  and  emperor,  was  noC  for  fiim  "the  bastion
		     	of   	tlie  revolution"  but  the  empire  which  was  called  upon,  at  the  end  of  an
				inevit~ble  world  war  from  which  it  was  to  come  out  victorious,   	to  impoae
				its   	total  hegemony  upon  the  rest  of  the  world.
		     	The  sPtback  suffered  in  Germany--the  responsibility  for  which,  I  might  add,
		     	no  one  dared  impute  to  him--confirmed  for  him  the  idea  that  a  revolution
				could  only  be  Che  result  of  a  lost  war.    	It  was  at  the  state  level  and  not
	  	_	   	that  of  the  communist  parties  that  the  princ~pal  thrust  of  total  strategy
		     	was  thenceforth  to  be  directed.    	Total  strategv  would  seek  its  fellow
				travelers  among  nations  and  not  among  political  movements.    	From  the  Qutside,
				the  Soviet  Union  would  have  to  be  seen  as  a  stat~~,   	if  not  a  classical  state
		     	at  least  one  which  totally  accepted  international  rulea.    	Hitler's  Germany
				on  that  occasion  served  as  Tiis  rationale.    	In  countries  where  they  officially
		     	exist,  communist  parties--while  remaining  totally  subordinated  to  the
				Krer~lim--are  themselves  to  play  the  parliamentary  game  also.    	Moreover,   	the
				Comintern  was  no  longer  the  General  Staff.  of  the  preceding  phases.    	Its
				prerogatives  and  resources  had  been  traiisferred  to  the  Secretariat  of  the
				Central  CommiCtee  and  the  Soviet  Special  Services.    	Its  agents  were,  more-
				over,  reduced  to  the  role  of  agents  of  these  special  services.3    	Action  in
				colonial  countries  was  practically  abandoned.    	Tfie  civil  war  in  China  was
				arranged  by  Stalin.    	The  USSR  parsimoniously  aided  the  Cfiinese  communists
				and  mainCained  discreet  contacts  with  Chang,  while  w.aiting  for  Japan  to  get
		     	bogged  down  in  a  deadend  war  in  China,   	to  tfie  great  satisfaction  of  the

				    	interesting  experiments  in  the  aectors  of  operational  sCrategy  and  military		 	-
				    	tactics.
				    	His  earlierhope  of  seeing  Che  outbreak  of  a  war  berween  the  French-Britiah
				    	and  the  Germans  over  Czechoslovakia  having  6een  dashed  in  Munich  in  1938,  he
	   	,			 	decided  in  the  spring  of  1939  Co  opt  for  Hitler  against   	the  bourgeois
				    	democraciea.    	The  German-Soviet  agreement  o�  26  August  1939  surprised  the
				    	latter  and  seemed  to  confirm  the  excellence  of  Stalin's  strategy.    	The
				    	Soviet  empire  became  larger,  while   	the  USSR  remained  on  the  perimeCer  of
	   	,			 	the  Europe~n  war.
				    	The  Cerman  attack  on  22  June  1941  surprised  Stalin  and  seems  to  have  once
				    	again  brought  the  toCal  strategy  inCo  question.    	The  enemy  was  the  first  to
				    	resort  to  arms  and,  what  is  more,   	the  myth  according  to  which  Che  proletar-
				    	ians  would  never  agree  to  participate  in  a  war  agafnst  the  USSR  vanished.
	   	'			 	In  order  to  come  ouC  of  the  total  war  victorious,  Stalin  found  himself
				    	reduced  to  the  invocation  of  the  "bourgeois"  clickes--which  were  scorned
				    	by  Lenin--of  Russian  patriotism,   	to  reestabl~sh  the  patriarcby  of  Moscow
				    	and  accept  massive  material  aid  from  the  capitalist  countries  wfiicfi  had
				    	become  his  allies.    	Fortunately  for  him,  his  former  ally,  Hitler,  made
				    	mistake  after  mistake;  and  abetted  by  the  unheard  of  heroism  of  his  soldiers,
				    	the  citory  caused  Stalin's  initial  errors  to  be  overlooked.    	Moreover,   	the
				    	"generalissimo"  did  not  wait  for  German  capitulation  to  take  up  at  Yalta,
				    	in  February  1945,   	the  next  battle  in  which  his  allies  of  the  moment--if  not
	   	,			 	fellow  travelers--were  to  become  enemies.
				    	The  appearance  of  the  nuclear  weapon  in  1945  was  to  stregnthen  even  further
				    	the  deterrent  aspect  of  the  Total  Strategy  by  keeping  the  current  conflict
				    	at  the  level  of  "peaceful  coexistence,"  and  occasionally  aC  a  harsher  level
				    	from  which  derives  ttie  term  "cold  war,"  occasionally  somewhat  more  relaxed,
				   	which  explains  the  world  "detente."
				   	That  said,   	this  confrontation  at  the  world  level  over  the  last  34  years  has
				    	involved  t6ree  phases  characterized  by  different  configurations,  each  with
				   	a  basic  antagonism.    	Also,  after  the  fashion  of  the  Balkan  wars  at  the

		    	result  in  setbacks.    	The  diversion  in  Greece  was  to  fail  because  of  the				     	;

				    	Uuring  these  6  yeare,  Khruschchev'  vainly  sought  to  impose  Soviet  rule
				     	upon  Che  Chineae,to  coneolidate  tihe  Empire~   	to  extend  ~Ce  influence  in
				     	the  Third  Wor1d  and~~cr;~bre~k  up  Che  Aelantic  Alliance  by  presenting  the
				    	United  5tatias  and  iCs  par~ners  wiCh  a  series  of  irrevereible  conceasiona.
				    	To  aCtain  thie  lase-named  ob~ective,  he  attempred  to  arrange  a  deciaive
				     	auAnniC  conf~rence,  using  ae  leverage  firet  the  Berlin  pr�~b1em  (1958-1961)
				    	and  Chen  Cuba   	(1~62).
				    	This  package  of  maneuvers  resulted  in  a  aeries  of  setbacke,   	tfie  moet  serious
				     	of  which  was  that  of  Cuba  in  October  1962  and  in  a"de  facto"  armiatice
				    	between  the  USSR  and  the  Un~ted  States  in  the  form  o~  the  Moscow  accords,
				     	in  August  1963,  and  the  definitive  break  between  China  and  the  USSR.
				    	World  War  IV  (1963-1969)   	esaentially  set  China  againat  the  two  auperpowers~
				    	This  led  to  a  certain  amount  of East-West  "detente"  and  increasing  tension
				    	between  Peking  and  Moacow.    	At  the  outseC,  China  directed  ita  strategy
				     	toward  the  developing  countries  of  the  southern  hemisphere,   	to  draw  inCo
				    	its  camp  the  revolutionary  nationalisms  of  the  Third  World.    	At  Che  eame				_
				     	time,   	Japan--up  to  then  under  U.S.   	influence--adopted  a   	poaition   	of  some
				    	aloofness  and  6egan  an  extraordinary  process  of  economic  penetration  while
				    	waiting  to  become  a  great  political-strategic  power.

	  	_			 	C		 	+		N					    	(U.S.  �  E)				(R  �  S)...J?
				    	China		  	Revolutionary										  	(Japan)
								 	nationalisms  of
								 	the  Third  World
	    	~			 	The  symbols  appearing  in  the  two  sets  of  parentheses  indicate  growing
	    	i				misunderstandinga,  on  the  one  hand  between  the  United  States  and  its
	    	j			 	European  allies  and,  on  the  other  hand,  within  the  Empire  where  a
	    	i			 	satellite--Romania--was  attempting  to  preserve  its  relative  independence.
				    	The  Chinese  offensive  bore  fruit  in  1964  and  culminated  on  14  Octuber  of
	    	'			 	that  same  year  in  the  fall  from  power  of  Khrushchev  and  his  replacement  by
	    	~			 	a  new  collegial  directorate.    	However,   	in  1965,  Peking  in  turn  experienced		  	_
				    	a  series  of  aetbacks  whicfi  were  in  part  rooted  in  the  "Cultural  Revolution."
				    	At  the  beginning  of  1966,   	Soviet  strategists  resumed  the  initiative  on  the
	    	!			 	occasion  of  the  Havana  Conference.    	The  USSR  got  a  foothold  in  South  Yemen
	    	;				and  Somalia.    	The  Black  Sea  fleet  assigned  a  permanent  squadron  Co  the
				    	Mediterranean  and  utilized  the  port  facilities  offered  to  it  in  that  area
	    	~				by  Syria,  Egypt  and  Algeria.
	    	~				The  symbol  �  also  appear~  between  C  and  N;  however,   	the  cultural  revolution
				    	plunged  China  into  semi-chaos  Iiordering  on  a  generalized  civil  war.    	But  the
				    	USSR  demonstrated  its  inability  to  exploit  these  difficulties  and,  on  the
				    	contrary,   	in  1967,  had  a  series  of  serious  setbacks:    	stirrings  among  the
				    	satellites,  defeat  of  its  Arab  allies  in  the  June  1967  war,  refusal  of
	    	~				Romania  to  break  diplomatic  relations  with  Israel  and,   	finally,   	the  fall

				The  year  1969  was  a  watershed  beginning  the  passage  from  World  W~r  IV  to
				World  War  V.    	It  was  marked  in  particular  Fiy  tfie  coming  to  power  of  President

				  	the  role  of  the  KGR  within  the  Soviet  system  and,  on  the  orher  hand,   	the  rise
				  	of   	the  secreCary  general  himself  above  his  colleagues  in  rhe  "collegial
				  	directQrate."
				  	At  the  same   	eime,   	the  escalation  in  Soviet-Chinese  antagonism  was  accentuated
				  	and  culminaCed  in  rtarch  1969  in     	highly  exploaive  aiCuation.    	For  the  first
				  	time,   	in  rtoycow  as  in  Peking,   	there  was  really  Chought  of  a  toCal  war  between
				  	the  two  former  allies.    	Only  discreeC  preasure  from  the  U.S.  administraCion
				  	prevenked  a  caCasCrophic  soluCion  to  their  differences~
				  	However,  with  the  Libyan  revolution,   	tfiere  appeared  in  the  person  o�  Colonel
				  	Qadhdhafi  a  leader  of  a  new  kind  on  Cfie  international  scene.    	At   	the  beginning
				  	an  unquestioning  disciple  of  Colonel  Nasir,  after  the  disappearance  of  his
				  	masCer  in  the  fall  of  1970,  he  utilized  all  Che  resources  of  his  country  to
				  	reestablish,  under  the  aegis  of  Libya,  a  pure  and  hard  Islamic  line  designed
				  	to  sweep  modernism  liberalism  and  atheism  out  of  all  Muslim  countrtes.    	The
				  	passage  from  the  equation  of  World  War  IV  to  that  of  President  Nixon's
				  	strategic  plan  lasted  3  years  and  culminated  in  a  situation  of  equilibrium
				  	in  the  spring  of  1972,  as  the  result  of  the  trip  by  the  chief  of   	the  White
				  	House  first   	to  Peking  and  Chen  Co  Moscow.    	Thus  what  was  to  become  "World
				  	War  V"  got  its  start  with  a  vision  quite  close  to  real  peace.
				  	World  War  V
				  	Of  course,   	at  the  time  President  Nixon  managed  to  progressively  construct
				  	his  system  of  the  two  triangles,   	the  war  in  Vietnam  had  not  yet  ended;   	ancl
	  	,			 	the  situation  in  the  Middle  East  continued  to  be  highly  explosive--despite
				  	the  disappearance  of  Colonel  Nasir.
				  	However,  in  the  spring  of  1972,   	the  beginning  of  a  reconciliation  between
	  	,				China  and  Japa.n  was  observed.    	Encouraging  talks  took  place  between  the  two
				  	Koreas  and,   	in  Vietnam,  progress  was  made  toward  a  peaceful  solntion.
				  	Thus,  what  we  are  calling  "World  War  V"  started  with  a  short  phase  of
				  	equilibrium;  and,  in  January  1973,  President  Nixon  felt  that  he  conld  speak			-
				  	of  an  "era  of  peace."
	  	i				However,  his  illusions  were  of  sfiort  duration.    	The  Watergate  scandal,  a
				  	few  months  later,  shattered  the  Wh~te  House  general  staff  and  forced  the
	  	i				president  into  a  hopeless  fight  against  Congresa,   	the  press  and  the  public

		     	apart;  and  thus  the  first  6  montiis  of  1975  were  no  less   	catastrophic  for
		     	tiie  Western  world,  and  that  without  the  total  Soviet  strategy  playing  a
		     	predominanC  role,
		     	In  the  Middle  East,   	Secretary  of  StaCe   	Henry   	Kissinger  was  not  able  to

			;				In  ttie  meantime,  within  the  Empire,   	it  was  a  question  of  maintaining  Moscow's
				     	hold  on   	the  "sister  countries,"  of  reestablisfiing  the  psycho�-political

				     	This  overall  plan  was,  of  course,  perfectly  logical.    	It  was  still  necessary
						to  correctly  determine  the  principal  direction  of  the  new  strategic  maneuver.
			~				In  our  opinion,   	it  is  Chere  that  the  Soviet  strategists  made  a  serious
			'				mistake  by  settin~  up  the  combination  "Middle  East-Africa"  as  tfie  principal
						theatre,  while  being  forced  to   	take  massive  action  in  Asia.
			;				The  origin  of   	this  mistake  in  the  first  place  was  tfie  fact  tfiat  Moscow  was
				     	not  always  able  to  accept  the  idea--and  this  in  spite  of  the  1969  events--that
						the  principal  enemy  of  the  USSR  was  China.    	Prisoners  of  their  legend  of

				  	caused  i'ekin~  to  Cake  direcC  action  against   	this  inveteraCe  ally  of  the
				  	USSR.    	This  time  it  was  no  longer  a  question  of  a  quick-strike  operation,
				  	as  against  India  in  1962  but  of  a  real  war--that  is,  of  a  new  approach  to
				  	total  strategy,  which  had  up  to  now  excluded  "gambles."    	By  taking  the  risk
				  	on  this  occasion  or  resorting  to  force,   	the  Chinese  strategists  apparently
				  	were  aiming  at  a  triple  ob~ective:
				  	--to  take  their  revenge  on  the  Vietnamese  leaders  who  had  caused  them  to
				  	lose   	face  by  invading  Cambodia;
				  	--to  sCrike  a  blow  at   	the  prestige  of  the  USSR  which  reportedly  was
				  	dissuaded  directly  by  the  Chinese  nuclear  potential  and  indirectly  by  the
				  	United  States;
				  	--to  precipitate  the  evolution  of  World  War  V  in  the  direction  of  an

		    	be   	forced  Co  withdraw,   	thus  giving  Vieenameae  propaganda  an  opportuniCy  to
		     	claim  viceory.
		     	In  such  an  eventuality,  which  would  be  effectively  equivalent  to  a  serious
		     	defear,  China  could  very  we11  experience  a  new  domestic  crieis  with
		     	consequences  that  are  difficult  to  foresee.
		     	That  said,  whatever  the  ouCcome  of  thia  Sino-Vietnameae  war,  one  tbing  seema
		     	certain  to  us,  namely  that  World  War  V  has  now  enCered  an  excessively
		     	criCical  phase.    	As  a  matter  of  fact,  Moscow  ia  convinced  that  since  the				    	~
		     	end  of  the  last  year  a  real  alliance  existe  bet~aeen  the  Western  countries
		     	and  the  Sino-Japanese  pa:i.r  and  that  the  total  Chinese  atrategy  is  manipulat-
		     	ing  the  totality  against  the USSR.    	For  lack  of  ability  to  repudiate  ita  own
		     	view  of  the  world,  which  would  have  permitted  it  to  deCacfl  tfie  United  States			    	~
		     	and  Europe  from  their  disturbing  Asian  allies,  the  Muscovite  oligarchy  can
		     	only  intensify  tbe  struggle  at  tfie  world  level.
		     	Without  speaking  of  Asia  where  Che  sitnaCion  can  only  worsen,  we  must					  	_
		     	because  of  this  fact  expect  a  renewal  of  tension  in  the  Middle  East,  new
		     	pockets  of  conflict  in  Africa  and,  above  all,  a  serions  crisis  in  Europe
		     	where  it  is  highly  proba6le  tfiat  Che  USSR  will  be  induced  to  take  Romania
	  	~	   	back  in  hand  and  perhaps  to  even  intervene  in  Yugoslavia.    	This  would  pro-
		     	duce  complicaCions  of  the  most   	dangerous   	kind  to  the  point  that  the
		     	possibility  of  a  Soviet  power  strike  against  Western  Europe  cannot  be  excluded.
		     	Even  though,  at  thisjuncture,  that  is  an  extreme  hypothesis,   	it  is  not  so
		     	improbable  as  it  might  seem  at  first  sight--a1L  the  more  so  becauae  th~
		     	Western  alliance  is  far  from  constituting  a  coherent  deterrent  entity.
		     	Of  course,  a  dramatic  development  in  the  conflict  now  in  progress  could  be
		     	modified  by  the  consequences  of  a  possible  power  strnggle  in  the  Kremlin,
				in  tbe  event  Leonid  Brezhnev  and  other  leadere  are  forced  to  resign,  for

			 	they   	are  not   	yet   	ripe   	for   	an  overall   	alternative  to  the  DC.     	Ours
			 	is   	a   	democratic   	strategy,   	a   	strategy   	of   	progress.     	With   	a  weak			   	~
			 	PSI,   	there  will  be   	in  the   	long  ruri  destabilization  not   	only   	of

			 	initiative  without   	broader   	support   	in  the  nation,   	but  there  will

			  	rity  behind  a  narrow   	government,   	such   	as  the   	Social   	Democrats

					 	you  tell   	the   	voters  wha~   	those   	reason   	are   	right   	now?
					 	[Answer]     	I   	don't   	have   	the   	file   	in  my   	drawer;   	since  the   	DC   	is
					 	no~   	pusl~ing  it,   	I'm  not   	pushing  it   	either.     	I   	shall  tell  the
					 	voters   	what   	I   	think   	in   	political   	terms.     	It   	is   	not   	true   	that,   	in
					 	a   	democracy,   	power   	erodes   	those   	who   	do   	not   	have   	it.     	This   	is
					 	true   	in   	a   	sick  democracy,   	one  that   	is   	depressed,   	bogged  down   	in
					 	the   	sticky  mire   	o�   	patronage.
					 	I  think  that   	the  new  government   	must   	have  new   	leadership.     	The
					 	current   	leadcrship  .is   	clearly  tired   	and  worn   	outy     	There   	is  no
					 	punitive   	intent   	here.     	There   	is   	a  need  for  change  which  we  call
					 	attention  to,   	as  others  have   	as  well.     	Nor   	is   	it   	true  that   	a  name
					 	is   	indissolubly     	linked  with   	a  political   	line.     	Andreotti  has   	lent
					 	his  name   	to  many  different   	formulas   	and  different   	political   	lines.
					 	One   	need  only   	read  the   	history   	books  from  1947   	onward   	and  think
					 	back   	over   	the   	political   	events   	of   	recent   	years.

	   	,			     	"nobody  defends  the  theses  of  the  28th  congress  anymore.    	The  radicals

					  	When  they  saw  that  they  were  forced  to  provide  an  alternative,   	they
