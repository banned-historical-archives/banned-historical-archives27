						GENERAL  KIR'YAN  DYSCUSSES  THE  ~CHINESE  THItE.~T'
						Turin  LA  STAMPA  in  Italian  28  Dec  79  p  3
					 	jInterview  with  Soviet  Ma~  Gen  Mi.khail  Rir'yan,  in  Moscow,  bp  Bernardo
						Valli,  date  nut  given:    	"Moscow's  Night.:nare--a  Chinese-Japanese-U.S.-
					 	European  Axis--Bei~ing's  Diabolical  Plors"]
					 	[Text]    	The  USSR  is  afraid  o~  being  encircled  by  a  tri.continental  allianc..
					 	She  puts  the  West  on  guard  against  an  unpredicatable  China  which  allegedly
					 	dreams  cf  en~e-rging  as  the  sole  m$ster  fro~  the  smoking  ruins  of  the  world.
					 	A  general  says,   	"It  is  imposaible.  to  destxoy  her  entire  nuclear  arsenal."
					 	The  Soviets  do  not  trust  Carter,  and  even  less  do  they  trust  his  adviaer		     	-
					 	Brzezin~ski.
					 	The  prospect  of  a  Chineae-Japaneae-United  Statea--European  Western  axis
					 	continues  to  be  Moscow's  permanent  nightmare.    	Zt  will  continue  to  be  her		~
					 	specter  in  the  1980's,   	too.    	Such  a  trlcontinental  agreement  would  mean
					 	"encirclement,"  wi~Lh  all  the.consequences,  fears  and  anxieties  the  word  has
	    	-			   	implied  since  1917.    	It  is  w~thin  thi,s  obsessive  framework  that  the  frenetic	     	_
					 	diplomatic  activi,ty  be3,ng  touched  o�f  3,n  all  directio~s  by  Moscow  must  be
					 	seen:    	in  the  West,   	the  o~fensi,ve  aga~nst  the  Euro~ean  missiles  and  on  behalf
					 	of  the  American  rati~ication  o~  SALT  II  (the  treaty  on  strategic  nuclear
					 	weapons),  and,  in  the  F~ast,  the  simultaneous  negot~ations  with  Bei~ing  for
					 	the  purpose  of  arriving  at  an  agreetnent  between  the  two  nations.    	The  USSR
					 	already  feels  the  vise  tightening  and  is  trying  to  loosen  its  grip.
					 	The  numerous  unknowns  of  the  fesred  equation  (in  which  the  human  masses  uf
					 	the  Ch3,nese  and  the  technology  o#  the  cavit$lists  would  be  placed  side  by
					 	side  like  two  algebraic  expxessions~  are  i,nsi.stently  stressed.    	The  greatest
	    	-			   	of  these  unknowns,  which  is  pointed  out  in  conversat~ons  wi,th  Westerners with
					 	the  intention of dissuading them frombecoming  fziendlywith  the  Chinese,  is  the
					 	"unpredictability"  of Be~ijing.   	"Be careful,"  the  Sovietssay,in.substance,
					 	"playing  the  Chinese csrd againstthe.USSR could be dangerous.   	Tomorrow it might
	    	~			   	be  used  against  you."
					 	This  theme  is  not  flattering  toti~e  Chinese,  who  are  depicted  as  exploiters
					 	who  would  like  to  make  use  of  their  anti-Sovietism  to  assist  the  West

			  	but  tomorrow  would  be  willing,   	for  all  practical  purposes,   	to  change  their
			  	attitude  if   	they  thought  it  would  be  advantageous  for  them.    	In  order  to
			  	bring  the  "four  modernizations"   	(industry,  agriculture,   	defense  and  educa-
			  	tion)   	into  being,  Beijing  is  in  need  o�  foreign  aid  in  the.form  of  capital
			  	and  technology.
			  	According  to  the  Soviet  experts  in  Far  Eastern  affairs,   	the  industrialized
	   	a	   	countries  with  market  economies--and  particularly  the  United  States,  Japan
			  	and  the  FRG--distributed  $23  billion  to  the  PRC  in  the  form  of  various  types
			  	of  credit  after  the  fighting  between  China and Vietnam.    	But  the  assistance  �
			  	allegedly  amounts  to  very  little  by  comparison  with  the  boundless  Chinese
			  	ambition.    	However,   	that  generosity  leaves  the  successors  of  Mao  indifferent,
			  	for  they  are  not  inclined  in  the  slightest  to  ad~ust  their  aims  permanently
			  	to  Western  aims.
	     	_	   	The  Chinese  are  allegedly  aiming  at  obtaining  the  leadership  of  the  Third
			  	World,  and  in  order  to  accomplish  that  pro~ect  successfully  "they  are  seeking
			  	to  aggravate  the  contradictions  existing  between  the  two  different  world
			  	systems  for  the  purpose  of  pr~voking  political  and  miiitary  incidents--that
			  	is,  an  armed  conflict  between  the  USSR  and  the  United  States."    	I  read  those
			  	words  in  a  publication  concerned  with  post-Mao  China.    	The  authors,  T~eonid
			  	Gudoshinov  and  Rostislav  Neronov,  both  from  the  Far  Eastern  Institute,
			  	assert  that   	the  leaders  in  Beijing  are  plotting  4  diabolical  conspiracy  on
			  	a  world  level.    	According  to  these  two  Muscovite  Sinologists,  HUA  Guo-feng,			  	'
			  	DENG  Xiao-ping  and  company  are  dreaming  of  emerging  from  the  smoking  ruins
			  	of.  tl-ie  world  as  the  sole  masters.
			  	A  warning  to  the  West  emerges  from  this  apocalyptic  interpretation  of  Chinese		    	;
			  	thought:    	Do  not  let  yourselves  be  fooled,  do  not  be  so  naive,  msrch  along-
			  	side  us  to  contain  the  Asiatic  masses!    	Stripped  of  all  pxopagandistic
			  	tinsel,   	the  Soviet  message  is  clear:    	Let  us  return  to  the  bipolarity  which,
			  	in  the  past  few  decades,  has  made  it  possible  fox  us  to  build  the  relaxation
			  	of  tension  which  now  is  treatiened.
			  	I  spokE  of  the  "Chinese  peril"  with  General  Mikhail  Kir'yan,  and  authentic
			  	major  general.    	He  has  an  impeccable  uniform,  decorations,  high  boots,  well-
			  	combed  short  hair,  a  regular  profile  and  grayish-t~lue  eyes.    	In  an  American
			  	uniform,  he  could  appear  in  a  Hollywood  war  znovie.    	But  his  hands  clash  with
			  	the  rest  of  his  appearance;   	they  are  stumpy  and  knotted,   	the  hands  of  a
			  	peasant.    	They  are  reassuring.    	I  cannot  successfully  imagine  them  pushing
			  	the  buttons  for  the  third  world  war--the  nuclear  one.								    	~
			  	General  Kir'yan  has  gond  sense.    	He  speaks   	Lhe  simple  language  of  military			  	;
			  	people.    	"Certainly,"  he  says,   	"China  does  ~~ot  have  a  force  comparable  with			 	~
			   	rhe  Soviet  or  the  NATO  forces,  but  one  cannot  ignore  the  presence  of  such  a
			  	neighbor  as   	that."   	For  that  reason,  a  conspi.cuous  part  of  the  Red  Army  is
			  	deployed  in  the  East.    	The  general  is  particularly  concerned  with  numbers.
			  	He  imagines  fanatical  hordes.    	i  ask  him  whether  it  would  be  possible,					 	_
			  	without  too  great  a  risk  and  at  a  sinl~le  blow,   	to  destroy  the  entire  nuclear

					     	In  spite  of  the  fact  that  China  has  a  deterrent  force  which  is  inferior

					     	It  is  very  probable  that  the  Soviets,  like  the  Americana  before  their

					     	military  nuclear  materiel.    	But  they  no  longer  can  consider  doing  that.
					     	They  have  to  take  into  account  the  development  involving  Chinese  missiles
		   	_			  	pointed  at  the  USSR,  even  though  that  is  a  slow-moving  denelopment.    	The		     	~
					     	general  did  not  say  that,  but  that  is  the  conclusion  I drew from  his  discourse.
					     	I  also  asked  him  whether  the  possibility  of  a  Soviet  intervention  on  behalf
					     	of  Iianoi  had  been  confronted  during  t1-~:  recent  fi~hting  between  China  and
		   	'			  	Yietnam.    	He  replied  that  the  question  was  not  raised  after  it  became  evident
					     	that  the  valor  of  the  Vietna.mese,  encouraged  by  the  possession  of  Soviet
					     	weapons,  had  sufficed  to  check  the  Chinese  masses,   	"driven  by  fanatici~.~"		   	~
		  	-			  	and  leci  by  generals  "lacking  in  knowledge  of  the  military  arts."
		  	,			  	I  persisted~,  asking  him  whether  a  direct  Soviet  intervention  was  possible
		   	_			  	in  theory.    	In  responding,  he  added  a  bit  of  diplomatic  ability  ~to  his
					     	peasant  good  sense.    	"We  act  in  such  a  way  as  to  localize  b~.ttles  and  prevent
					     	large  conf3.icts.    	Certainly,   	if  a  war  gets  larger,  nor~e  of  the  big  powers
					     	can  stay  out  of  it.    	We  cannot  leave  our  brothers--let  us  say,  our  younger
		   	,			  	brothers--alone  and  exposed  while  the  ,Amer~,cans  can  assist  the  other  side.
					     	Taking  such  a  step  can  lead  to  a  world  war.    	Ar?yway,   	I  repeat  that  when
					     	fighting  starts  we  try  to  limit  it."
					     	I  asked  the  general  what  he  thought  of  the  possibility  of  concerte  military
					     	assistance  to  Bei.jing  by  the  United  States?    	He  said  that  the  IIni,ted  States
					     	would  like  to  have  a  strong  China,  but  at  the  saame  time  they  do  not  know
					     	"in  what  direction  she  will  move  in  the  future."    	The  fact  is  that  they  dc+
					     	not  trust  her  too  much,  and  therefore  they  a~void  prov:Lding  her  with  conr_rete
					     	military  assistance.    	Like  the  politi,cians  and  the  experts,  the  military
					     	also  con3ider  China  to  be  a  treach~rous  terrain  for  the  Amexicans,  $nd
					     	therefore  in  a  certain  sense  :it  is  capablE  of  being  recovered  by  the  Soviets,	   	~
		   	~			  	or  at  least  we  let  thezn  think  so,  with  the  hope  that  ~Tash~ngton,  assai,led
					     	by  do.ubts,  will  not  bet  too  heavi.ly  on  the  Chinese  card.
					     	The  first  phase  of  the  Sino-So~iet  negotiations  in  Moscow  ended  in  a  stale-
					     	mate.    	After  days  of  exhausting  negot~ati,ons,   	the  princip.le  of  the  useful-
					     	ness  of  and  the  need  for  dialog  was  recogn~,zed..   	That  was  not  too  outstanding
					     	a  result,  but  it  is  one  whi,ch  le$~es  a  number  of  possibilities  and  contin-
					     	gencies  open--that  is,  it  lea~es  the  So~3.ets  a  certain  amount  of  room  for
					     	maneuvering.
					     	The  factor  of  China  continues  to  quali~y  Moscow's  opi.nions  to  a  large  extent.

				   	Banner  All-Union  Volunteer  Saciety  for  Assista,nce  to  the  Ar~y,  Air  Force
				   	and  Navy  [DOSAAF]  has  carried  out  enormous  work  in  the  area  of  propagandiz-
				   	ing  and  actua.l.~.y  realizing  Lenin's  ideas  on  the  de~ense  of  the  socialist
				   	fatherland.    	During  the  years  ~f  its  exi'stence,   	it  has  become  a  truly  mass
				   	patriotic  organization  of
										   the  Soviet  people.
				   	The  DOSAAF  or~ranization  of  Uzbekistan  is  one  of  the  det~,chments  of  this
				   	society.    	In  its  rank~:  are  more  than  5  million  persons  who  are  members  of
				   	20,000  primary  organizations.    	The  basic  work  in  the  area  of  ideological
				   	tempering  and  military-patriotic  indoctrination  of  the  workers,  and  partic-		 	.
				   	ularly  the  younger  generation,   	is  concentrated  in  these  organizations.
				   	The  republic  DOSAAF  each  year  provides  the  army  and  navy  with  thousands  of
				   	skilled  drivers  of  motor  vehicles  and  tractors,  electricians,  parachutists,
			  	~	 	radio  operators,  equipment   	operators  and  other  specialists.    	At  present  one
				   	out  of  every  three  ind.uctees  receives  a  military-technical  specialty  in  the
				   	DOSA.4F  training  organizations.    	In  the  activities  of  the  DOSAAF  organiza-
				   	tions  a  great  place  is  givE~i  to  the  training  of  specialists  for  the  ma,ss
				   	technical  ~rofessions  in  the  national  econorqy  and  having  a  military  appli-
				   	cation.    	The  military-technical  types  of  sports  are  being  developed,  and
				   	these  foster  in  the  young  people  such  qualities  as  endurance,  discipline,
				   	steadfastness  and  courage.
				   	Within  the  system  of  the  Uzbek  DOSAAF  there  are  8  sports  federations  and
				   	16  types  of  sports  are  supported.    	At  present  around  2.5  ni~illion  young  men
				   	~nd  women  are  pemanently  engaged  in  parachuting,  motor  veh.icle,  motorcycle,
				   	radio,   	underwater,  boating  and  shooting  sports,  as  well  as  model  making.
				   	The  Uzbek  DOSAAF  carries  out  all  work  in  the  area  of  indoctrinating  and
		    	,	     	training  the  young  people  in  the  DOSAAF  schools  and  clubs,   	in  their  ideo-
				   	logical  and  moral  temperir~g  and  in  the  acquiring  of  military-technical
		    	�	     	knowledge  and  military  specialties  in  close  cooperation  with  the  other  re-
				   	public  social  organizations.    	This  helps  to  so]_ve  comprehensively  the  prob-
				   	lems  of  both  the  indoctrination  and  training.of  future  military  personnel,
				   	as  well  as  to  achieve  definite  successes  in  carrying  out  complicated  tasks.
				   	The  achievements  of  the  republic  DOSAAF  in  the  military-patriotic  indoctrin-
				   	ation  of  the  workers  and  on  the  occasion  of  the  50th  anniversary  of  the
				   	zormation  of  DOSAAF  were  recognized  by  the  Diploma  of  the  Presidium  of  the
				   	Uzbek  Supreme  Soviet  and  the  Jubilee  Honorary  Insignia  of  the  USSR  DOSAAF.
				   	This  is  a  great  honor  for  us.
				   	A  great  deal  has  been  done,   	and  definite  successes  have  been  achieved.    	But
				   	conceit  and  complacency  are  alien  to  us.    	Life  does  not   	stand  still,  and
				   	the  high  results  are  good  only  for  today,  but  tomorrow  they  will  not  meet
				   	the  increased  demands.
				   	V.   	I.   	Lenin  taught  that  one  must  not  be  satisfied  with  what  had  been
				   	achieved,  but  rather  one  must  "go  constantly  onwards,  achieve  continuously
				   	more,   	and  move  constantly  from  the  easier  tasks  to  the  more  difficult  ones."

				 	Centra.l  Committee  as  wel'1  as  the  oblast,   	city  and  rayon  DOSAAF  committees
				 	have  carried  out  a  number  of  ineasures  to  strengthen  the  primary  organiza-			    	_

				 	These  questions  have  been  repeatedly  discussed  at  the  presidiums  and  plen-

				    	The  republi~  DOSAAF  coIInnittees  together  with  the  trade  union  and  Komsomol

				    	2'he  DOSAAF  collectives  ~f  Ferganskaya,  Namanganskaya  and  Andizhsnskaya
				    	oblasts  have  been  models  of  professional  cooperation  with  the  trade  union,
				    	Komsomol,,sports  and  other  organizations.    	They  not  only  maintain  constant

				    	In  our  republic,  ties  with  the  civil  defense  [CD]   	staffs  a_re  t;eing  constant-

				    	for  the  purposes  of  explaining  to  the  population  their  duti2s  in  caxrying

				    	in  the  conducted  CD.months,  weeks,  10-day  periods  and  days,  as  well  as  in

				    	training  centers  for  basic  militaxy  training,  and  the  training  organiza-		     	~

				    	Gen  S.  Akhundzhanov,  as  well  as  staff  workers  have  repeatedly  spoken  to  the

				    	training  the  DUSAAF  leadership.									 	~
				    	Recently  ma,ny  republic  DOSAAF  co~ittees  have  improved  their  organizational

				    	activities  in  a  professional,  efficient  and  skilled  manner,  as  well  as  to
				    	carry  out  a  co~enced  matter  to  its  end.    	Characteristie  for  such  committees

				    	think  out  a  decision  to  the  last  details,  and  to  choose  the  best  *.aays  and

			    	As     	whole  we  have  developed  an  effective  system  for  training  the  regular

			    	an  enormous  detachment  of  activists.

				   	We  give  great  significance  to  efficiency,  accounting  and  reporting.    	The

				   	on  all  the  activities  of  DOSAAF,   	including  organizational  ones.							,
				   	There  has  been  a  noticeable  increase  in  organizational  work  at  the  Fergan-

		  	_		 	schools,   	sports-technical  clubs,  and  provide  them  with  practical  help.
				   	As  an  example,  let  us  take  the  DOSAAF  committee  of  Ferganskaya  Oblast.    	In-
				   	herent  to  it  is  a  constant  desire  to  improve  the  style  of  leadership  over
				   	the  inferior  organizations,  professionalism,  and  a  creative  approach  to
				   	solving  the  pending  tasks.    	Here  they  skillfully  organize  the  competition,
				   	they  effectively  direct  the  fulfillment  of  the  assumed  obligations,  and
				   	propagandize  their  results  in  the  verbal  and  visual  agitation.    	Checks  and
		  	-		 	reciprocal  checks  are  organized  on  the  fulfillment  of  obligations,  and  pub-

				   	mittee,  and  above  all  in  the  area  of  leading  the  rayon  and  city  committees
				   	and  the  primary  DOSAAF  organizations.    	This  has  helped  to  intensify  their			    	`

				   	the  Leninskiy,  Kirovskiy,   	Ordzhonikidzevskiy  and  Pskentskiy  rayon  commit-

						Introduction
						Ensuring  high  effectiveness   	is  one  of  the  urgent  problems  in  the  development
						of  military  equipment  and  armament.    	The  literature  on  the  theory  and  prac-
						tice  of  evaluating  armament  effectiveness  contains  no  established  definition
						of  the  term  "combat  effectiveness":   	i.n the narrow sense,   	it  is  an  evaluation
						of  the  firepower  or  effectiveness  of  the  fire  of  individual  models  of  arma-
	     	=				ment  whicfi  are  intended  for  the  destruction  of  ground  targets,  and  in  the
						broad  sense--reconnaissance,   	firepower,  combat  readiness,  mobility,   	fire
		  	~		    	control,  material-technical  support,  enemy  counteraction,  and  so  forth.    	In		  	~
						this  booklet,   	the  combat  effectiveness  of  ar~illery  armament  is  considered
					 	in  the  narrow  meaning.
					 	In  the  creation  and  operation  of  armament,   	the  nece~sity  arises  to  employ
						quantitative methods  for  evaluating  its  combat  and  econotnic  effective~ess				-
						which  permit  the  deternination  of:
					 	--at  the  designfng  stage--the  most  efficient  design  versions  and  the  most
						economical  methods  for  their  creation.
					 	--in  thP  course  of  prov~ng  ground  and  troop.tests--the  actunl  values  of  ef-
			,			 	fectiveness  indices  of  armament  models  as  well  as  information  necessary  to
					 	ensure  effectiveness  in  series  production  and  when  put  into  operation;
					 	--at  the  operating  stage--the  qualitative  substantiation  of  decisions  adopted	    	-
					 	by  the  command  in  questions  of  the  operation  of  specific  axmament  models  and
					 	planning  their  combat  employment.
					 	Since  the  methods  for  combat  employment  of  armament  models  are  worked  out  on
					 	the  basis  of  an    	estimate    	of  combat  effectiveness,  an  understanding  of  the
					 	essence  of  quantitative  effecti:veness  indices  and  the  ability  to  conduct  at
					 	leas~  elementr~ry  calculations  for  their  eva~luation  are  required  for  their
					 	study  and  successful  practical  use.
					 	Combat  effectiveness  indices  have  a  probability  nature  and,  therefore,   	the
					 	practical  recommendations  which  are  worked  out  on  their  basis  are  ~ustified
					 	only  on  the  average  with  their  repeated  eraployment.    	Methods  for  evaluating
					 	combat  effect3.venes~  are  especially  valuable  when  comparing  individual  models
	     	-			 	and  methods  for  their  combat  employment.    	As  regards  absolute  estimates  of
					 	combat  effectiveness,   	they  possess  less  accuracy  and  reliability  than  rela-
					 	tive  estimates.    	Therefore,   	they  should  be  considered  only  as  initial  data
				'		 	for  making  decisions,  ar.d  not  as  finished  decisions.
					 	Quantitative  metfiods  for  evaluating  the  combat  effectiveness  of  field  artil-
					 	lery  should  be  used  with  consideration  of  combat  experience  i~  employment.

					An  understanding  of  the  principles  in  evaluating  the  combat  effectiveness
					of  field  artillery.fire,   	the  norms  of  shell  expenditure  on  the  accomplishment
					of  combat  mis~ions.,  and  methods  of  fire  is  a  mandatory  condition.for  the

					conduct  of  combat  operations.
					Tasks  and  General  Principles  for  Evaluating  Combat  Effectiveness     	.					   	'
					The  degree  of  conformance  of  possible  or  obtained  results  from  the  combat
					employment  of  armament  to  the  necessary  or  required  results  is  called  the
					/combat  effectiveness  of  this  armament/   	[in  boldface].    	Combat  effectiveness
					is  the  basic  characteristic  of  any  arnament's  quality.
					The  /evaluation  of  combat  effectiveness/   	[in  boldface]   	is  a  scientific  metMd	  	�
					for  determining  combat  effecEiveness  indices  for  armament  which  are  neces-
					sary  for  workir.g  out   	tactical-technical  requirements  for  ne~ly  created  arma-			 	'
					ment  and  evaluation  during  its  operation.
					The  basic  methods  for  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  armament  were  worked
		     	-	 	out  in   	the  works  of  Russian  and  Soviet  scientists-artillerymen.    	The  first
					of  them  was  the  work  by  the  outstanding  Russian  artilleryman,  V.  N.
					Shklarevich,   	"On  Means  for  Establishing  the  Correct  View  on  the  Properties
					of  Firearms,"  which  was  published  in  1871.    	It  provided  an  evaluation  of  the
					effectiveness  of  field  artillery  fire  and  the  principles  for  the  use  of  its
					quantitative  indices  as  properties  of  firearms.    	The  evaluation  of
				 	ef.fectiveness  as  a  scientific  method  for  the  study  of  questions  in  artil-
					lery  fire  was  employed  from  the  moment  of  conception  of  the  theory  of  fire
				 	(the  science  of  artillery  fire).
					An  especially  significant  role  in  evaZuating  the  effectiveness  of  fire  was
					played  by  the  works  of  Academician  A.   	N.  Kolmogorov  and,   	in  particular,
					"The  Number  of  Hits  with  Several  Shots  and  General  Principles  for  Evaluating
					the  Effectiveness  of  a  Firing  System,"  which  was  published  in  1945.    	These
					methods  received  their  further  development  in  the  works  of  Soviet  scientists
					G.   	I.   	Blinov,  P.   	A.   	Gel'vikh,  V.   	G.   	D'yakonov,  and  others.
					The  evaluation  of  combat  effectiveness  can  be  divided  arbitrarily  into  the
				 	follo~aing  stages:																		     	~
					--formulation  of  the  evaluation  tasks  and  determination  of  the  initial  data
					necessary  for  their  accomplishment;
					--selection  of  combat  effectiveness  indices  and  the  method  for  their  deter-			  	~

						presentation  in  a  farm  ~hich  is  practicahle  for  use  in  the  accomplishment
						of  practical  tasks.
						Formulation  of  the  tasks  is  the  most  difficult  element  in  evaluating  combat
						effectiveness  and~consists  of  obtaining  numerical  values  of  selected  coffibat
						effectiveness  indices  for  a  model  of  armament  being  cansidered  with  accuracy
						and  reliability  sufficient  for  practical  purposes  and  with  the  mi~iimum  ex-
						penditure  of  personnel  and  equipment.    	The  task  should  be  posed  in  such  a
						manner  that  its  accomplishment  is  possible  using  the  indices  which  can  be
						determined  by  relatively  simple  methods  and  that  all  necessary  data  are  ob-
						tained  as  a  result  of  its  accomplishment.
						The  selection  of  combat  effectiveness  indices  requires  an  analysis  of  the
						basic  properties  of  the  indices  being  considered,  the  disclosure  of  the  ties
						between  them,  and  the  selection  of  their  most  effective  combination  which
						ensures  obtaining  the  maximun  possible  amount  of  information  for  the  solutial
						of  practical  tasks.    	Not  only  the  complexity  and  duration  of  the  studies,
						but  also  the  correctness  of  the  solution  of  practical  tasks  depend  on  the		     	~
						effective  selection  of  the  indices.
						Selection  of  the  method  for  deterce.ining  combat  effectiveness  indices  depends
						on  the  time  for  the  conduct  of  computational  work  and  the  cost  price  of  the
						work  to  be  accomplished.    	The  basic  method  of  determination  is  the  computer
						method  with  the  employment  of  electronic  computers  which  is  not  always  pos-
						sible  among  the  troops  where  the  deternunation  of  the  indices  should  be  based
						on  very  simple  computational  means.
						When  using  the  results  of  the  evaluation  of  live  firings  it  should  be  remem-
						bere~i  that  combat  effectiveness  indices  are  probability  characteristics  and
						contain  far  from  cdmplete  information  on  the  actual  combat  effectiveness  of
						armament.    	Many  factors  whicfi  exert  a  subs~antial  influence  on  effECtiveness
						do  not  submit  at  a11  to  mathematic.al  description.    	Therefore,   	tr~eir  numpri-
						cal  values   	should   	also  be  looked  upon  as  initial  data  which,   	along  with
						other  data,   	can  be  used  in  making  decisions  relative  to  the  combat  effective-	    	-
						ness  of  armament  and  the  methods  for  its  combat  employment.

				   	Introduction		     	~
				   	The  victory  of  the  Great  October  Socialist  Revolution  proclaimed  the  birth
	 	_			 	of.  a  new  Soviet  society  which  pr~pounded  as  its  main  foreign  policy  aim
				   	the  freeing  of  mar,kind  from  war  and  providing  a  lasting  peace  in  the  world.
				   	For  more  than  60  years  the  Soviet  Union  has  Poug?~t  consistently  and  con-
				   	stantly  to  achieve  this  goal  proposed  by  the  founder  of  the  Communist  Party
				   	and  the  Soviet  state,  V.   	I.   	Lenin.    	The  peace-l~ving  goals  of  Soviet  foreign
				   	policy  have  gained  the  force  of  the  basic  state  law  and  have  been  offi-
				   	cially  set  down  in  the  new  USSR  Constitution.							  	~		  	_
				   	The  realization  of  these  high  and  noble  aims  has  been  the  goal  of  the  spe-
				   	cific  foreign  policy  initiatives  undertaken  by  the  Soviet  Union  within  the
				   	framework  of  the  Program  for  the  Further  Struggle  for  Peace  and  Inter-
				   	national  Cooperation  and  fcr  the  Liberty  and  Independence  of  Peoples  ap-
				   	proved  by  the  25th  CPSU  Congress.    	The  active  and  puxposeful  policy  of  the
				   	USSR  and  the  entire  socialist  co~nonwealth  has  contributed  to  the  positive
				   	shifts   	in  the  world  situation,  to  the  ever  stronger  es~cablishing  of  the
				   	principle  of  peaceful  coexistence  in  the  practices  of  international  rela-
				   	tions,   	and~to  a  lessening  of  international  tension.
				   	The  good  changes  in  the  world  which  have  been  particularly  noticeable  in
				   	the  1970's  have  been  primarily  a  consequence  of  the  change  in  the  balance
				   	of  forces  in  the  world  in  the  favor  of  socialism,  and  an  outgrowth  of  its
				   	greater  economic  and  military  might  and  increased  political  authority.
				   	They  have  also  been  the  result  of  the  successes  achieved  by  the  inter-
				   	national  workers  movement  and  by  the  forces  of  national  liberation.    	An
				   	understanding  of  the  new  realities  by  a  portion  of  the  ruling  circles  in
				   	the  capitalist  world  has  also  played  a  definite  role  in  realizing  a  lessen-
				   	ing  of  international  tension.
				   	The  historical  initiative  in  the  global  conflict  of  the  two  sociopolitical
				   	systems  has  shifted  into  the  hands  of  socialism.    	One  after  another  world
	 	_			 	imperialism  is  losing  its  positions  and  can  no  longer,  as  before,  with  im-
				   	punity  control  the  course  of  world  events  or  impose  its  will  on  the  peoples
				   	following  a  path  of  independent  development.    	A  narrowing  of  the  possi-
				  	bilities  of  imgerialism  does  not  mean,  however,  that  its  aggressive  essence
				   	has  changed.    	Althou~h  a  lessening  of  tension  is  steadily  becoming  the

		     	l~ading  trend  in  world  development,  it  would  be  premature  to  feel  that  the
		     	threat  of  a  world  thermonuclear  war  is  past.			~
		     	By  its  very  nature,   	imperialism  is  a  reactionary  system  which  contains  the
		     	sources  of  aggression  and  predatory  wars.    	Lenin's  evaluation  of  the  basic
		     	content  of  imperialist  policy  as  a  policy  aimed  at  the  winning  of  global
		     	hegemony  remains  valid.    	"World  domination,"  wrote  V.   	I.   	Lenin,   	"is,  to
		     	put  it  br~iefl~,  the  content  of  imperialist  policy,  the  continuation  of
		     	which  is  imperialist  war."1    	The  Marxist  approach  to  an  evaluation  of  im-	     	~		  	-
		     	periglism  makes  it  possible  for  us  to  feel  that  the  positive  changes  in
		,	     	the  world  cannot  serve  as  grounds  for  complacency.
		     	The  cumplex  intertwining  of  positive  and  negative  trends  in  the  development				'
		     	of'  the  intex~national  situation  and  the  greater  attempts  by  influential  re-
		     	actionary  circleG   	in  the  United  States  and  the  other  NATO  countries  to
		     	force  the  world  back  to  the  times  of  the  Cold  War  show  that  the  process  of
		-	    	a  lessening  of  tension  is  no  guarantee  against  momentary  delays  or  even
		     	possibly  a  titrning  back.    	As  was  pointed  out  by  Comrade  L.   	I.  Brezhnev  in
		     	his  report  at  +,he  joint  session  of  the  CPSU  Central  Committee,  the  USSR					,
		     	Supreme  Soviet  and  the  RSFSR  Supreme  Soviet  on  2  November  1977,   	"inter-
		    	national  relations  are  presently  at  the  crossroads  l.eading  either  ~,.o  a
		    	growth  of  confidence  and  cooperation  or  to  a  growth  of  mutual  fears,   	sus-
		    	nicions  and  the  stockpi_ling  of  weapons--paths  leading  ultimately  either  to
		    	a  lasting  peace  or  at  best  to  a  balancing  on  the  brink  of  war."2
		    	Under  present-day  conditions,   	imperialism  has  not  abandoned  the  idea  of					'
		    	military  force.    	The  bourgeoisie  continues  to  view  the  arn~y  as  a  powerful
		    	weapon  of  class  rule  and  aggressive  policy.    	The  cult  of  force  was  and  re-			  	~
		    	mains  a  distinguishing  feature  of  the  practice  ~,nd  ideology  of  the  exploit-
		    	ing  classes.    	In  the  definition  of  F.   	Engels,   	"violence  merely  preserves
		    	exploitation."3    	V.   	I.   	Lenin,   	in  emphasizing  that  an  approach  of  force
		    	stems  from  the  very  essence  of  capitalism,  pointed  out  that  "under  capital-
		    	ism,  any  other  basis  or  any  other  principle  of  sharing  except  force  is  im-
		    	possible."4    	The  role  allocated  by  imperialism  to  the  factor  of  force  pre-
		    	determines  the  hi~h  place  of  military  policy  in  the  arsenal  of  ineans  used
		    	by  the  monopolistic  bourgeoisie  for  the  attaining  of  its  class  goals.				    	'
		    	The  sphere  of  military  policy  in  the  imperialist  states  includes  legisla-
		-	   	tive  enactments  and  practical  measures  which  encompass  two  areas.    	Tn  the
		    	first  place,  the  use  of  military  force   	(or  the  threat  of  using  it)  for			  	~
		    	achieving  the  aims  of  stat~  policy  in  peacetime  and  wartime.    	Secondly,  the			     	~
		    	direct  organizational  development  of  the  arrned  forces  as  a  basis  for  en-
		    	suring  that  imperialism  will  successfully  carry  out  its  missions  with  the			    	~
		    	aid  of  force.
		    	The  aims  of  imperialist  military  policy  are  determined  by  the  interests  of
		    	the  mor~opolistie  bourgeoisie.    	Prior  to  the  Great  October  Socialist  Revolu-
		    	tion  and  the  formation  of  two  ~pposing  systems  in  the  world,  the  chief  aim			  	.
		    	of  imperialistic  military  policy  of  any  dev~loped  state  was  to  ensure  mili-

						domiriation,  markets  and  a  sphere  for  the  investment  of  capital.    	After			  	-
						Great  October,   	in  accord  with  the  view  of  V.   	I.   	Lenin,  "the  reciprocal
						relations  of  peoples  and  the  entire  worldwide  system  of  states  are  deter-		    	_
				     	mined  by  the  struggle  of  a  small  group  of  imperialist  nations  against  the
						Soviet  movement  and  the  Soviet  states  headed  by  Soviet  Russia."5    	Thus,  at		  	-
			 	'	    	the  basis  of  the  present-day  military  policy  of  imperialism  lies  a  reac-
						tionary  idea,  the  essence  of  which  is  to  eliminatP  the  world  capitalist
						system,  to  enslave  the  developing  nations  economicalJ.y  and  politically,
	   	_			  	and  t~  neutrali.ze  the  communist  and  workers  movemen~  i~  the  developed  capi-
						talist  states.
	  	1
	   	_			  	The  anti-Soviet,  reactionary  essence  of  the  military  policy  of  imperialism
						is  manifested  most  vividly  in  the  c~ynamics  of  military  expenditures.    	Dur-
						ing  the  time  which  the  NATO  bloc  has  existed,  with  its  mai.n  task  being  the	    	�
						preparation  for  war  against  the  USSR  and  the  other  socialist  countries,   	its
				     	members  have  spent  2.218  trillion  dollars  for  military  purposes.    	In  1976,
	    	-			  	the  militaxy  allocations  of  the  NATO  states  surpassed  by  37-fold  the  corres-
						ponding  expenditures  of  all  countries  of  the  ~orld  in  1929.    	Here  the  maxi-
				     	mum  increase  of  military  expenditures  has  occurred  in  recent  years.
						The  ideologists  and  politicians  of  imperialism  have  endeavored  to  ~ustify
						the  unprecedented  growth  of  military  allocations  by  false  assertions  of
						the  supposed  "Soviet  threat."    	Various  fabrications  have  been  concocted
						that  the  USSR  was  supposedly  preparing  actively  to  start  a  nuclear  war  or
						was  excessively  increasing  its  weapons.
						True  reality  shows  the  falseness  of  all  these  fabrications.    	The  improving
	   	_			  	of  Soviet  defenses  is  a  matter  forced  on  us  and  caused  by  the  necessity  of
						defending  the  victories  of  socialism.    	Here  Soviet  expenditures  on  defen~e
	   	_			  	have  declined  both  in  absolute  figures  and  in  relative  terms  for  the  entire
				     	total  of  the  state  budget.    	While  in  1971,  these  expenditures  were  17.8.
				     	billion  rubles,  in  1974,  they  were  17.6,  while  in  1976,  they  had  declined		   	~
						to  17.4  billion  rubles,  and  in  1977  and  1978,  to  17.2  billion  rubles.    	Cor-
						respondingly,  the  share  of  military  outlays  in  the  Soviet  budget  over  these
				     	years  was  11,  9.1,  7.8,   	7.2  and  7.0  percent.
						::o  "3oviet  threat"  exists.    	"`PhiS  is  all  a  monstrous�lie--from  start  to
						finish,"  said  Comrade  L.   	I.   	Brezhnev  at  the  25th  CPSU  Congress.    	"The
						Soviet  Union  does  not  intend  to  attack  anyone.    	The  Soviet  Union  does  not
						need  a  wa,r.  �The  Soviet  Union  is  not  increasing  its  military  budget....
						Our  nation  has  consistently  and  unswervingly  fought  for  peace,  and  has  con-
						stantly  come  forward  with  specific  proposals  aimed  at  reducing  weapons  and
						at  disarma.ment . "6

					 	The  military-industrial  complex  which  brings  together  militaristic  group-
					 	ings,  the  national  and  international  monopolies  producing  weapons,  govern-
					 	mental  and  scientific  circles  involved  with  military  programs,  and  other
					 	supporters  of  the  Cold  War,   	employs  the  most  refined  means  to  thwart  or  at
					 	least  hold  up  the  process  of  detente.    	They  have  not  abandoned  the  criminal
					 	ideas  of  unleashing  a  nuclear  war  and  for  the  sake  of  their  sel~ish  class
					 	interests  are  ready  to  sacrifice  tens  and  hundreds  of  millions  of  lives.
					 	Nor  have  the  economic  roots  of  the  military  danger  been  eliminated.    	In  the
	     	_			  	capitalist  world  private  ownership  of  the  means  of  production  still  exists.
					 	In  a  situation  of  inflation,   	stagnation  and  crisis  phenomena  in  the  ecorio~y,
					 	with  an  unchecked  rise  in  prices  for  vital  necessities  and  with  the  survival
					 	of  mass  unemployment,   	sociopolitical  contradictions  become  ever  more  acute.
					 	The  reaction  of  the  capitalist  countries  sees  the  way  out  of  the  dead  end
					 	which  has  arisen  in  the  ftizrther  militarization  of  all  life  of  society.    	An
					 	unrestrained  arms  race  is  viewed  as  the  most  reliable  source  of  enrichment.
					 	The  so-called  "Soviet  military  threat"  has  been  proposed  as  the  pretext  for
					 	forcing  the  population  to  pay  for  the  new~military  outlays.    	The  true  aims
					 	of  the  organizers  of  the  hullabaloo  in  the  West  over  the  question  of  the
					 	supposed  "military  threat"  from  the  soeialist  states  are.to  create  a  sort
					 	of  propaganda  screen  for  concealing  i.mperialist  policy.    	The  leaders  of  our
					 	party  and  state  have  spoken  repeatedly  on  the  complete  absurdity  of  such
					 	assertions.    	In  an  interview  with  the  West  German  newspaper  VORWARTS,   	Com-
	     	-			  	rade  L.   	I.   	Brezhnev  pointed  out:    	"The  Soviet  Union  for  its  sake  feels  that
	     	-			  	approximate  equality  and  parity  are  sufficient  for  the  needs  of  defense.
					 	We  have  not  se~  for  ourselves  the  goal  of  achievin~  military  superiority.

					 	day  enormous  arsenals  of  already  stockpiled  nuclear  weapons  and  de].ivery
					 	systems."1
					 	In.the  West  military  force  is  viewed  as  one  of  the  most  important  means  for
					 	~nsuring  imperialist  interests  in  wars  and  military  conflicts.    	It  is  view-

					 	on  call  as  well  as  those  which  can  be  deployed  in  the  event  of  wa.r.    	It  is

		  	~			The  brunt  of  the  aggressive  policy  of  imperialism  is  aimed  primarily  against
				 	the  Soviet  Union,  the  bulwark  of  universal  peace  and  social  progress.    	The
				  	reactionary  forces  of  capitalism  see  in  the  Soviet  Union  and  all  the  socisl-			 	-
		 	-			ist  co~nonwealth  the  basic  obstacle  on  the  path  to  realizing  their  aggres-
				  	sive  plans.    	The  main  strike  ~orce  of  world  reaction  is  the  military  in-			     	;
				  	dustrial  complex  of  the  United  States,  the  most  powerful  capitalist  power			   	,
				 	which  has  a  determining  influence  on  the  shaping  of  the  overall  strategy  of
				  	imperialism.    	Military  force  remains  the  basic  instrument  in  the  list  of
				 	means  used  by  the  American  ruling  circles  for  carrying  out  the  tasks  of
				  	their  global  policy.    	A  constant  increase  of  military  might,  the  desire  to
				  	strengthen  U.S.   	positions  throughout  the  world  by  consolidating  ties  with
				  	allies  and  activating  a  bloc  policy,  and  the  toying  with  the  surviving  con-
				  	flict  and  crisis  situations--all  of  this  involves  the  permanent  threat  of
				  	the  outbreak  of  new  wars  and  military  conflicts.
				  	U.S.  military  policy  is  based  upon  a  principle  of  "intimidation"  which  has
				  	provided  the  "power"  base  for  American  foreign  policy  beginnin~  with  the
				  	Cold  War  period.    	This  is  seen  in  the  updating  of  old  aggressive  strategic
				  	concepts  and  the  developing  of  new  ones,  and  the  preparation  of  American
				  	armed  forces  for  a  broad  range  of  wars,   	from  nuclear  to  the  so-called
				  	"counterinsurgency,"  from  the  increase  in  the  number  of  army  divisions,					;
				  	and  the  higher  military  potential  of  the  Air  Force  and  Navy.    	Precisely
				  	U.S.   	military  policy  as  the  basis  of  the  overall  political  course  of  this
				  	country,   	is  the  basic  brake  on  the  further  development  of  Soviet-American
				  	relations  and  international  detente.    	As  a  whole,  the  military  policy  of			    	!
				  	American  imperialism  is  characterized  by  a  constant  desire  to  find  new  ways
				  	and  means,   	forms  and  methods  for  using  military  force,  regardless  of  the				 	-
				  	development  of  detente  in  the  political  relations  between  the  two  social
				  	systems.
				  	At  the  beginning  of  the  1980's,  the  aim  of  the  peace-loving  forces  is  to
				  	achieve  a  triumph  of  detente  everywhere  in  the  world.    	One  of  the  most  im-
				  	portant  tasks  on  this  level  is  the  working  out  of  a  new  Soviet-American
				  	agreement  on  the  limitation  of  strategic  weapons   	(SALT-2).    	Such  a  treaty,			  	'
				  	should  it  be  signed,  ratified  and  put  into  force,  will  create  a  definite			    	,
				  	barrier  on  the  path  to  the  further  stockpiling  of  the  most  destructive  and
				  	expensive  types  of  weapons.    	Here  the  tre~.ty  will  express  the  principle  of
				  	the  equality  and  equal  security  of  the  parties.    	The  coming  into  force  of
				  	the  treaty  will  mean  that  the  process  of  damping  down  the  arms  race  which
				  	has  been  started  upon  the  initiative  of  the  Soviet  Union  is  to  continue.
				  	The  trzaty,  undoubtedly,  will  have  a  beneficial  influence  on  the  inter-
				  	national  climate  as  a  whole.														    	,
				  	Recent  facts  show  that  U.S.   	policy  has  been  characterized  by  zig-zag  de-
				  	velopment,  that  is,  from  the  securing  of  Americ~,n  national  security  by  talks,
				  	as  can  be  seen  from  the  achieving  oP  an  agreement  on  the  basic  questions  of
				  	SALT-2,  to  the  use  of  threats  and  the  increase  of  tension.    	The  American
				  	government  peri.odically  whips  up  the  arms  race,  and  proposes  to  increase
				 	military  force  over  a  period  extending  beyond  the  next  decade.    	Attempts
				  	have  not  ceased  to  intervene  in  the  internal  affairs  of  the  social.ist  states

					   	under  the  cover  of  hypocritical  campaigns  over  the  supposed  "violations  of
					   	hurnan  rights"  in  the  socialist  countries.    	Such  attempts  are  a  flagrant
					   	violation  of  the  generally  accepted  standards  of  international  law,  as  well
					   	a::  a  viol~.t;ion  of  the  lett~.er  and  spirit  of  the  T~'ina]   	Act  approved  in
					   	Flelsinki.
					   	A~gressive  blocs  are  the  basic  instrwnent  of  imperialism  in  carrying  out
					   	its  react'ionary  military  political  aims,  and  among  these  blocs  the  most  im-
					   	port~.n1:  place  is  assigned  to  the  North  Atlantic  Alliance.    	Since  the  moment
					   	of  its  birth,  this  imperialistic  alliance  has  headed  an  active  campaign  of
					   	struggle  against  the  socialist  commonwealth  by  carrying  out  the  strategy
					   	of  "intimidation."    	The  political  and  military  circles  of  NATO  have  been
					   	concerned  not  with  preventing  the  outbreak  of  nuclear  war  in  Europe,  but
					   	rather  what  moment  is  more  advantageous  for  them  to  squeeze  the  nuclear
					   	trigger.
					   	The  aggressive  rssence  of  the  North  Atlantic  bloc  can  be  seen  in  the  grow-
					   	ing  flow  of  alloca.~?ons  for  military  purposes,  in  the  streng-thening  of  its
					   	aggressive  potential,  and  in  the  planning  of  the  arms  race  for  years  to
					   	come.    	The  main  aim  of  the  steps  undertaken  by  the  NATO  leadership  is  to
					   	torpedo  the  process  of  detente.
					   	In  the  middle  of  the  1970's,  within  NATO  tendencies  began  to  be  clearly				"
					   	manifested  for  a  strengthening  of  the  bloc  in  political,   	economic  and  mili-
					   	tary  terms.    	For  solving  this  problem,  the  militaristic  circles  of  the  West
					   	have  endeavored  to  tie  the  Western  E~.iropean  bloc  members  even  more  closely.
		 	.			  	to  the  United  States,  to  broaden  its  membership,  and  extend  the  zone  of  its
					   	activities  beyond  Western  Eurape  and  the  North  Atlantic.    	The  NATO  leader-
					   	ship  has  pai.d  close  attention  to  the  flanks  of  the  bloc:    	in  the  south  of
					   	~  roFe  it  has  intentionally  not  allowed  a  further  strengthening  of  influ-
					   	ence  of  the  leftist  forces,  and  in  the  north  it  has  endeavored  to  extend
					   	the  military  presence  of  the  bloc.
					   	The  decisions  of  the  May  (1978)  session  of  the  NATO  Council  have  become
					   	particularly  dangerous.    	At  this  session  of  the  Atlantic  militarists,  a
					   	"long-range  weapons  program"  was  approved  running  up  to  1993�    	In  accord
					  	with  this  program,  the  member  nations  of  this  aggressive  bloc  assumed  an
					   	obligation  year  after  year  to  increase  their  military  expenditures,   	and
					   	prima.rily,for  ever  more  costly  weapons.    	In  the  course  of  the  session,  the
			_			   	intention  was  affirmed  to  extend  the  "sphere  of  responsibility"  of  this
					~	  	bloc  to  vast  regions  extending  far  beyond  the  limits  outlined  in  the  treaty			_
					   	on,the  setting  up  of  the  North  Atlantic  Alliance.    	Finally,   	during  the  talks
					  	between  the  leaders  of  the  aggressive  alliance,  American  officials  for  the
					   	first  time  overtly  proclaimed  the  link  between  their  interests,  the  inter-
					   	ests  of  NATO  and  the  interests  of  the  Chinese  leadership  which  had  been
					  	against  the  policy  of  detente  and  called  for  preparations  for  war.    	In  the
			-			  	press  of  the  nations  of  the  North  Atlantic  bloc,  China  is  called  the  "16th
					  	member  of  NATO."    	This  phrase  is  to  the  liking  oP  the  Bei~ing  leaders.    	In
					  	endeavoring,to  gain  access  to  the  NATO  military  arsenals,  the  Chinese
			,			  	leaders  in  every  possible  way  have  advertised  their  hostility  to  the  Soviet

					rurope,   	no  specific  results  as  yet  have  been  achieved.    	The  reason  for  the
