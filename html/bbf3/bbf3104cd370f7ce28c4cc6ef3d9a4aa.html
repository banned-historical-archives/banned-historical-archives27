 COMMUNIST CHINA THROUGH 1961
 THE PROBLEM
 To examine the present situation in Communist China and its international re-
 lations, and to estimate probable developments during the next five years.
 CONCLUSIONS
 1. The Chinese Communist Party will al-
 most certainly continue to exercise ef-
 fective control over mainland China dur-
 ing the period of this estimate and will
 press forward with its program of creat-
 ing a powerful industrialized Communist
 state. Through a combination of incen-
 tives and repression the regime will prob-
 ably be able to prevent popular discon-
 tent from becoming a significant factor
 in retarding the momentum of its pro-
 gram.  (Para. 19)
 2. The Chinese Communists will probably
 continue to make substantial progress in
 industrial development but agricultural
 production will probably increase at only
 50 percent of the planned rate of increase
 and thus will tend to restrict, the rate of
 overall economic growth.  (Para. 37)
 3. Communist China has placed great
 emphasis upon maintaining and develop-
 ing its armed forces as a basic aspect of
 national power. With Soviet assistance,
 its military capabilities have become far
 greater than those of any other Asian
 power and will probably continue to in-
 crease during the next five years. (Paras.
 38-39)
 4. The position of the Chinese Commu-
 nists in the Communist world has been
 greatly enhanced as a result of develop-
 ments since the death of Stalin and par-
 ticularly because of the prominent role
 they have played in Bloc affairs in the
 past year.  Peiping will probably further
 increase its influence within the Commu-
 nist Bloc and will have an important
 voice in matters, affecting the Bloc as a
 whole.    Communist China will continue
 to rely on the Bloc for the bulk of its
 military and economic imports. Although
 it is probable that some conflicts of in-
 terest and disagreements will develop be-
 tween Moscow and Peiping, it is highly
 unlikely that either will permit such con-
 flicts to impair Sino-Soviet solidarity.
 (Paras. 40, 43)
 5. Communist China's influence has in-
 creased markedly in the non-Communist
 world, and its presence is especially felt
 in Asia.  The Chinese Communists have
 been able to create the impression in
 much of non-Communist Asia that Com-
 munist China is a dynamic, permanent,
 and perhaps not unfriendly world power,
 which it is unwise to offend by too close

 alignment with the West. At the same
 time, however, there is apprehension con-
 cerning Communist China's real inten-
 tions and a recognition, though seldom
 voiced publicly, of the importance of the
 US in restraining Communist China from
 overt aggression.  (Paras. 44, 54, 57-58)
 6. The replacement of Western influence
 by Communist influence in Asia will con-
 tinue to be a major Chinese Communist
 objective.  In its approach to this ob-
 jective and other international problems,
 Peiping will probably try to avoid courses
 of action which it believes would pro-
 voke US military intervention.  It will
 remain hostile to the US, and will not
 offer major concessions on basic issues.
 Nevertheless, it will probably endeavor
 to appear conciliatory and flexible on in-
 ternational issues. At the same time,
 it will continue its subversive efforts, and
 will take advantage of opportunities for
 Communist expansion, possibly includ-
 ing the extension of support to armed
 revolts against non-Communist govern-
 ments.  Peiping will remain determined
 to obtain control of Taiwan, but will al-
 most certainly not attempt to seize Tai-
 wan by force so long as the US is commit-
 ted to its defense.  (Paras. 59-60, 62, 64)
 DISCUSSION
 1. DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN COMMUNIST
 CHINA
 7. During the past seven years the Chinese
 Communists have brought mainland China
 under effective control and have established
 a strong central government, aligned with
 the USSR and hostile to the West.  By delib-
 erate use of terror and by persuasion and
 social pressure, they have drastically changed
 many basic features of Chinese society.  They
 have made considerable progress toward de-
 veloping an industrial base and in increasing
 output in other sectors of their economy. The
 Chinese Communist armed forces are being
 modernized, with Soviet support, and their
 military capability on the Asian mainland
 and in adjacent waters has been greatly in-
 creased.
 The Political Situation
 8. The Chinese Communist Party is in com-
 plete control of the government.  Most im-
 portant government posts at both national
 and local levels are held by members of the
 party, and the party structure parallels that
 of the government down to the, smallest polit-
 ical division.  Orders from Peiping are trans-
 mitted through both governmental and party
 channels.  The party cadres have the impor-
 tant functions of supervising the operation of
 provincial and local governments and of pro-
 viding leadership for the implementation of
 major projects such as the socialization of
 agriculture.  Non-party members occupy a
 few cabinet and subcabinet positions but are
 there either as window dressing or in order
 that their skills can be exploited.
 9. Party membership has more than doubled
 since 1952, and now probably exceeds 11 mil-
 lion.  The majority of party members con-
 tinue to be' drawn from the peasant class
 (about 69 percent), but the proportion of
 urban workers has now increased to about
 14 percent.  About 10 percent of the members
 are women.
 10. The top leadership of the Chinese Com-
 munist Party has continued to demonstrate
 a remarkable degree of continuity, unity, and
 stability.  The Eighth Party Congress, which
 met in September 1956, confirmed the domi-
 nant position held by Mao Tse-tung and his
 closest lieutenants, Liu Shao-chi, Chou En-lai,
 Chu Teh, and Ch'en Yun.  These four men
 serve as vice chairmen of the Central Com-

 mittee and as members of the newly formed
 six-man Standing Committee of the Politboro,
 the most powerful organ of the party.  Mao
 himself remains chairman of the Central Com-
 mittee and of the Politboro and its Standing
 Committee.  His personal prestige and power
 have not been diminished by the Soviet attack
 on the "cult of personality."
 11. At the same time, the party has brought
 some new blood into the higher party echelons.
 One hundred three new members and alter-
 nates have been added to the. Central Com-
 mittee from among provincial and municipal
 party committees, central government and
 party agencies, and the high-ranking officers
 of the armed services.  By giving added rep-
 resentation to provincial party organizations
 and key.elements of the civil government and
 the military, the party has strengthened its
 control over these segments of government
 and administration.    The most notable in-
 dividual promotion was the appointment of
 Teng Hsiao-p'ing, Secretary-General of the
 Central Committee and apparently the lowest
 ranking member of the old 13-man Politboro,
 to the Standing Committee.
 12.- During the next five years, the leadership
 of the party will probably be able to maintain
 unity. and cohesion.  In the event of Mao's
 death or disability, jockeying for power might
 develop which could reduce the effectiveness
 of the leadership.   Mao would probably be
 succeeded as chief-of-state by the aged vice
 chairman, Chu Teh. However, effective power
 would probably initially reside in a collective
 body made up of the senior party members.
 13. The Chinese Communist Party will be en-
 gaged in a continuing drive to maintain and
 tighten party discipline.  It will probably con-
 tinue its efforts to improve party control in
 the army and in economic enterprises, in order
 to prevent the emergence of a caste of non-
 political specialists.                        There will also be an
 effort to adjust relations between local and
 central organs within both party and govern-
 ment, in order to encourage local initiative
 while enforcing central control and also to
 prevent the development of local satrapies.
 Although administrative efficiency will prob-
 ably improve, the regime will continue to be
 hampered by a shortage of trained party ca-
 dres and administrators.
 Popular Reaction to the Regime
 14. We believe that the regime is faced with
 considerable dissatisfaction, engendered in
 part by rigid controls, enforced social changes,
 and imposed austerity, and in some areas
 such as Tibet, with open defiance.  On the
 other hand, the regime has the positive sup-
 port of some groups, in part as a result of
 its promises of a new industrialized and pros-
 perous China and its claims of growing pres-
 tige and influence in the world.  The bulk
 of the people, however, probably respond to
 the regime in a resigned manner because of
 their conviction that it can effectively exercise
 its power over them and that little is to be
 gained by opposing it.
 15. The regime, concerned by the adverse ef-
 fects of the continuing lack of general positive
 support, sought, in the spring of 1956, to relax
 domestic tension engendered largely by the
 radical social changes embodied in the col-
 lectivization drive of 1955. The regime sought
 to counteract the rigidities of its policies and
 to create a more positive response to its pro-
 grams, and promised some amelioration of
 the harsh conditions of life to almost every
 social group in Communist China.  In partic-
 ular, the regime has adopted some measures
 designed to improve conditions for the intel-
 lectuals and to increase incentives for peas-
 ants and urban workers.  This recognition of
 what the Chinese Communists subsequently
 termed the "human factor" in production and
 social  reorganization  apparently  stemmed
 from a desire to consolidate the considerable
 social change which had occurred.
 16. These tactics have not involved any sig-
 nificant increase in personal freedoms.                                                                    De-
 spite an announced emphasis on. material in-
 centives for peasants and workers, these in-
 centives will be limited since the regime's
 long term program will inevitably require
 the retention of austerity and harsh economic
 policies.  Moreover, the incentives granted to
 private entrepreneurs participating in joint
 state-private enterprises are admittedly tem-
 porary.                                                                      The toleration and even encourage-

 ment of intellectual diversity, in certain fields,
 designed to elicit the maximum efforts of Com-
 munist China's limited numbers of intellec-
 tuals and trained technicians, will not be car-
 ried to the point where attacks on basic pol-
 icies and doctrines of the regime will be per-
 mitted.
 17. Even if the regime is unsuccessful in elicit-
 ing greater positive support, it will probably
 be able to maintain firm control throughout
 China and to implement sweeping social
 changes.  It has large and well-disciplined
 police, militia, and security organizations,
 supplemented by a network of informers and
 local "residents' committees" which provide
 surveillance over individual family groups.
 Party control is further reinforced by a system
 of mass organizations, organized along social
 and occupational lines, which mobilize various
 groups in the population behind Communist
 programs and serve as channels for propa-
 ganda and indoctrination.  The rapid expan-
 sion of agricultural cooperatives and collec-
 tives during 1955 and 1956 has probably
 strengthened Communist control over the
 peasantry and reduced the likelihood of large
 scale peasant revolts. Behind this control
 mechanism stands the large Chinese Commu-
 nist military force.
 18. The Chinese Communists have admitted
 the existence of unrest among some minority
 nationalities on the borders of China proper,
 requiring military suppression and a policy
 of gradualism in imposing Communist institu-
 tions.  The most serious recent armed clashes
 appear to have been with the Tibetans.  Al-.
 though the Chinese Communists were able
 to establish a military regime in Tibet in 1951,
 it was not until May 1956 that they took the
 first step toward establishing Tibet as an
 "autonomous region" of Communist China.
 The regime, in recognition of strong Tibetan
 resistance to change, has indicated that social
 changes will be imposed gradually.
 19. Barring involvement in a major war, dur-
 ing the period of this estimate the regime's
 control over the population will probably be-
 come increasingly effective as socialized enter-
 prises become more firmly established.  The
 regime will probably continue to have diffi-
 culties in imposing its policies in minority
 areas, such as Tibet, where changes will have
 to be instituted slowly and carefully.  How-
 ever, the imposition of Communist control in
 these areas will probably be facilitated as
 communications and party organization im-
 prove, and as the policy of moving Han Chi-
 nese into these areas is implemented.                                                                  There
 appears to be, during the period of the esti
 mate, little likelihood that the existence of
 the regime or its control over the mainland
 will be threatened by popular dissidence, or
 by the almost inevitable local eruptions of
 discontent.  The regime will probably be able
 to elicit a somewhat more positive support
 from certain privileged groups, such as skilled
 workers, technicians, and scientists.
 The Economy of Communist China'  2
 20. The transformation of agrarian China
 into a "modern socialist industrial" state is
 an avowed major objective of the Peiping re-
 gime.  During the initial four years of the
 First Five-Year Plan (1953-1957), the regime
 has achieved considerable progress in its pro-
 gram of industrialization.  Gross national
 product has probably been expanding at an
 average annual rate, of seven to eight percent,
 a growth rate comparable to that of Japan in
 recent years and well above that of other
 Asian countries.  This growth was achieved
 under considerable strain, involving enforced
 austerity and adjustments to shortages in
 transport, power, and other sectors.  Indus-
 See Appendix A for additional discussion of the
 current economic situation.
 2 The analysis in this section is based on estimates
 which are largely dependent on Chinese Com-
 munist statistics.  Although these statistics often
 cannot be confirmed by independent sources,
 careful examination and comparison with in-
 dependent data that are available strongly sug-
 gest that these figures constitute the basic eco-
 nomic data available to the regime and that
 in most instances there appears to have been
 no motive to inflate these data.  Where in-
 accuracies exist, they appear, for the most part,
 to be the result of ambiguous definitions of the
 data, deficiencies and inexperience in data col-
 lection, provisional reporting, pressure to re-
 port fulfillment of plans, and incomplete and
 selective reporting of the data to support cer-
 tain policy points of view.

 trial expansion appears to have exceeded the
 original goals of the First Five Year Plan,
 while the growth of agriculture has been con-
 siderably less than the planned rate.  The
 rate of investment has approached 20 percent
 of GNP and industrial output has increased
 at an estimated average annual rate of nearly
 17 percent.  The output of steel ingots is esti-
 mated to have increased from approximately
 1.35 million tons in 1952 to about 4.5 million
 tons in 1956 and the limited electric power
 production has doubled.  Agricultural output
 has increased at an estimated average annual
 rate of nearly three percent.
 21.. This relatively rapid rate of economic
 progress was facilitated by the comparatively
 inexpensive rehabilitation of the modest in-
 dustrial base, built largely by the Japanese
 and concentrated in Manchuria and, to a less-
 er extent, in North China and Shanghai. Po-
 litical unification of mainland China, for the
 first time in decades, provided generally peace-
 ful domestic conditions which enabled the
 regime to integrate the previously fragmented
 economy and to organize resources -and pro-
 duction on a national basis.  In addition,
 the regime has received from other Bloc coun-
 tries, over the four-year period 1953-1956,
 capital goods, raw materials, and military
 equipment in the amount, of over six billion
 dollars.  Of this, some 1.5 billion dollars was
 covered by Soviet economic and military cred-
 its and the balance financed by exports.  The
 Bloc has apparently fulfilled Chinese Com-
 munist essential import requirements, espe-
 cially for machinery, though with occasional
 delay in delivery, and has provided consider-
 able technical assistance.
 22. One of the most important factors con-
 tributing to the regime's economic program
 has been -its. success in establishing effective
 controls over the economy without causing
 a major slump in production.  These per-
 vasive controls effectively restricted consump-
 tion as output increased, resulting in the for-
 mation of capital which was concentrated in
 expanding heavy industry, and in the ac-
 cumulation of commodities to exchange for
 vital imports. The agricultural sector, which
 contributed nearly two-thirds of GNP in 1950,
 presented the critical problem because of the
 difficulty of establishing control over the out-
 put of nearly 450 million peasants farming
 millions of tiny farms.  The problem of estab-
 lishing control over industry was less difficult
 because the regime was able to assume owner-
 ship of a major portion of heavy industry di-
 rectly from the National government, though
 it was faced with the problems of organizing
 production.
 23. In the early stages of establishing control
 over the country, the regime permitted a large
 segment of private enterprise to continue and,
 for the most part, exercised indirect methods
 of control through fiscal, banking, and trade
 channels.  It ruthlessly enforced compliance
 with its regulations and eliminated the major
 potential sources of resistance.  The regime
 concurrently applied education, propaganda,
 and social pressures in an effort to induce the
 people to accept the end of private enterprise
 and began on a small-scale to impose socialist
 control through a series of transitional stages.
 However, by forced acceleration of socializa-
 tion in the winter 1955-1956, the regime
 virtually eliminated private capitalism and
 gained direct control over practically all in-
 dustry and commerce.
 24. To ease the transition to socialism in the
 agricultural sector, the Chinese Communists
 at first adopted a step-by-step approach which
 was to move from a simple pooling of labor
 and tools, through agricultural producers co-
 operatives, to full scale collectives.  The Chi-
 nese peasant, by incentives, including the
 promise of higher income, and by noncom-
 pliance penalties, was induced to accept con-
 stantly increasing state control.  Concurrent-
 ly, the regime moved more rapidly to gain
 control over the marketing of the .main agri-
 cultural products, and established price con-
 trols, rationing, and controls on agricultural
 loans.  During the early part of the present
 Five Year Plan (1953-1957), progress toward
 collectivization was slow, irregular, and rather
 uncertain. By October 1954 less than two per-
 cent of the peasant households were in coop-
 eratives and an insignificant percent in col-
 lectives.

 25. Following a speech by Mao in July 1955,
 the rate of collectivization was abruptly ac-
 celerated. Mao called for more rapid socializa-
 tion through energetic leadership, and cas-
 tigated. those who had urged a slower pace.
 By November. 1956, the Chinese Communists
 claimed that 96 percent of the total peasant
 households in China were in some kind of
 agricultural producer cooperative, and of those
 83 percent were completely. collectivized.  We
 believe that almost all peasants have now been
 assigned to collectives, but that many of these
 collectives have not yet been consolidated.
 26. It is too early to judge the ultimate effects
 of these organizational changes.  While the
 regime has claimed that in most instances
 production has increased in agriculture and
 industry and that trade has expanded, it has
 admitted that the "mistakes and defects were
 not few" in the socialization program. Among
 the major shortcomings admitted were:  (a)
 waste and faulty planning, (b) neglect of live-
 stock and rural handicraft industries, and (c)
 defective organization due to "rapid advances
 of the movement."  In addition to the prob-
 lems inherent in such a large undertaking,
 many mistakes resulted from inexperience and
 lack of training on the part of the cadres
 responsible for the drive.  Nevertheless, in its
 approach to socialization and particularly the
 collectivization of agriculture, the regime has
 to date avoided most of the disastrous conse-
 quences experienced by the Soviet Union.
 27. Planning for the Second Five Year Period.
 We estimate that many of the First Five Year
 Plan targets for 1957 were achieved by the
 end of 1956, but at the cost of depleted mate-
 rial stockpiles and an untenably low level of
 working capital.  As a result, the year 1957
 will be a period of adjustment and consolida-
 tion before the more ambitious Second Five-
 Year Plan (1958-1962) is begun.  The regime
 has evinced growing concern over the inter-
 related problems of consumption and incentive
 and the total amount of capital available for
 investment.  It has recognized the dangers:
 (a) that a shortage of consumer goods will
 cause difficulty in maintaining price stability,
 (b) that prices paid to the farmers for many
 of their products are too low to encourage
 peasants to increase production, and (c) that
 an insufficiency of light industry products will
 decrease worker's incentives and lower pro-
 ductivity as well as reduce the state's profits
 and its resources for investment in heavy in-
 dustry.  Although the regime has recently an-
 nounced its intentions to maintain industrial
 investment in 1957 at about the 1956 levels,
 it has admitted that cuts in nonindustrial in-
 vestment will be necessary.  A program of
 austerity in other government spending has
 also been introduced.
 28. Although such considerations will prob-
 ably lead to some modifications in the invest-
 ment program of the recently announced
 Second Five Year Plan, the regime will prob-
 ably still try in the second five year period to
 achieve a rate of economic progress about
 equal to that achieved in the first five year
 period.  The announced targets of the Second
 Five Year Plan call for about an 80 percent
 increase in industrial production above the
 level expected for 1957 and an increase in
 agricultural production about one-third over
 the expected 1957 output.  (See Tables A II
 page 17 and A III page 19.) 3  If these goals
 were met GNP would increase by about 45
 percent.
 29. A major weakness of the proposed Second
 Five Year Plan is its assumption that agri-
 cultural output can be increased at a rate of
 six percent annually.  We estimate that even
 with considerable effort the growth in farm
 output will be only on the order of three per-
 cent, and, therefore, will probably involve not
 only the curtailing of planned increases in
 personal consumption 4 but also some reduc-
 tion in planned investment.
 30. Major Economic Problems.  In view of
 the difficulties of increasing the amount of
 land under cultivation, the regime's success
 in increasing agricultural production will de-
 In key sectors, by 1962 the Chinese Communists
 plan to increase production above the probable
 1957 levels by the following percentages:  cot-
 ton yarn 52 percent, basic food crops 40 percent,
 cotton 38 percent, coal 71 percent, steel 107 per-
 cent, electric power 131 percent, crude oil 245
 percent, and chemical fertilizers 435 percent.

 of population growth.

 pend largely on its ability to raise yields. The
 quality of the soil and the supply of water are
 adequate to support a substantial increase in
 output per acre, provided a heavy investment
 is made in fertilizers and irrigation. However,
 we believe the total investment in agriculture
 included in the Second Five Year Plan (1958-
 1962) is inadequate for achieving the agri-
 cultural goals.  State investment is largely
 limited to some large scale flood control and
 irrigation projects.  The bulk of the invest-
 ment, which will be for local projects, is to be
 provided by the collectives from their own
 production, over and above their contribution
 to the national budget.
 31. Whether the collectives will fulfill their
 goals will depend in part on the peasants'
 reaction to collectivization.  During the first
 year of full scale collectivization (1956), peas-
 ant reaction was not unduly adverse, probably
 because of the prospects for a good crop year.
 We believe a continuation of this attitude will
 depend largely on whether the regime is able
 and willing to permit some increase in the
 real earnings of the peasants.  The prospect
 for a rising peasant income will rest on the
 regime's decisions regarding total national
 expenditure and investments, and on the
 weather.  We believe that the regime, recog-
 nizing this problem of peasant incentive, will
 probably make some concessions to the peas-
 ants, and cadres have already been instructed
 to limit the investment, welfare, and reserve
 fund allocations from the income of the col-
 lectives in order to maximize direct payments
 to the peasants.  This situation will tend to
 limit the additional resources for investment
 which the regime can hope to mobilize
 through its collectivization program, and in
 addition will render the program vulnerable
 in the event farm output fails to increase.
 32. Even with adequate progress in capital
 formation, the regime will still have the con-
 tinuing problems of planning and of proper
 allocation of investment. , As the industrial
 sector becomes integrated, orderly progress
 will depend on timely, realistic, and accurate
 planning which avoids mistakes such as those
 which in 1956 resulted in shortages of cement
 and steel, shortfalls in petroleum production,
 low quality of output in many industries, and
 shortages of commodities for export.  The
 planners must also act to end the serious
 congestions and delays which have occurred
 on various sections of the railroads.5
 33. The shortage of trained personnel will con-
 tinue to be another problem of major propor-
 tions.  The increase in investment, the pro-
 jected completion of new plants, and the pro-
 gressive integration of industry, are certain
 to accelerate the requirements for trained
 personnel in industry.  In particular, the
 Communists admit that the development of
 necessary skills is the critical factor in the
 establishment and expansion of such indus-
 tries as chemical, telecommunications equip-
 ment, and precision machinery.  During the
 Second Five Year Plan period the educational
 system will find it difficult to provide both
 for its own expansion and for the needs for
 trained personnel in industry and agricul-
 ture.  Moreover, the shortage. of scientific
 manpower will continue and scientific re-
 search and development will remain limited.
 34. There will also be the problem of satisfy-
 ing the increasing requirements for essential
 imports of machinery and other commodities.
 Further increases in production in almost all
 industries will depend upon installations of
 new productive capacity, much of which
 is to be furnished by the Soviet Bloc, but
 some of which will come from the West. Dur-
 ing the period of this estimate, the Chi-
 nese Communist ability to import will be ad-
 versely affected if, as it now appears, the
 Soviet Union extends no further credits.. It
 will also be adversely affected by the need to
 repay outstanding Soviet credits and by the
 extension of grants and credits to Asian Com-
 munist and non-Communist countries.  Ex-
 ports will therefore have to be increased even
 more than imports, which will be difficult in
 view of present problems in squeezing out ag-
 ricultural' goods for export.  Moreover, devel-
 opments within the Soviet Union and the
 European Satellites may have an important
 adverse impact on the volume of imports from
 the Bloc and the timing.of their arrival. De-

 cussion of transportation.

 lay or curtailment of scheduled installations
 as a result. of stresses within the Bloc could
 have a seriously depressing effect upon the
 Chinese Communist rate of industrial growth.
 However, if Western trade controls were re-
 laxed the regime's dependence on the Bloc
 would be reduced and its import problems
 eased .6
 35. There will also be the continuing drain
 on resources to maintain the large military
 establishment, which is scheduled to account
 for 13 percent of the budget during the Sec-
 ond Five Year Plan, as against 18 percent in
 the First Five Year Plan.  In absolute terms,
 the plan provides that military expenditures
 will remain approximately at 1956 levels. Not
 only does military spending reduce the funds
 available for other purposes, but it also com-
 petes for commodities in short supply such
 as steel and trucks, and takes a large share
 of the earnings from exports to finance mili-
 tary imports.
 36. Prospects.  We believe that many of the
 targets of the Second Five Year Plan, as it
 now stands, are unrealistic and cannot be
 achieved.  It is likely that the regime, which
 appears to recognize this situation, will re-
 duce some of the goals. However, despite the
 existence of the difficult problems discussed
 above, the Chinese Communists have demon-
 strated an ability to cope with similar prob-
 lems in the past, have achieved considerable
 momentum, have further strengthened their
 control mechanism, and will probably con-
 tinue to make progress.
 37. Barring a series of natural disasters or
 the outbreak of war in the Far East, we be-
 lieve that the gross national product will in-
 crease at an annual rate of six to seven per-
 cent during the period 1956-1962, as compared
 with an annual rate of increase of approxi-
 mately seven to eight percent during the
 period 1952-1957. This increase will result in
 a total increase in GNP of 35-40 percent dur-
 ing the period 1958-1962 as compared with the
 45 percent envisaged in the proposal for
 the Second Five Year Plan announced in Sep-
 tember 1956.  Agricultural output will prob-
 ably increase at an average annual rate of
 about three percent rather than the planned
 rate of six percent.  Since the regime will
 have to compensate for the shortfall in agri-
 culture, the Chinese people, especially the
 peasants, will be placed under heavy strain.
 However, it is not likely that the regime dur-
 ing the five year period will push the invest-
 ment program to the extent that no increase
 in per capita consumption is possible, al-
 though they may do so for short periods to
 make up for temporary setbacks.
 The Military Establishment'
 38. The  Chinese  Communist  regime  has
 placed great emphasis upon maintaining and
 ,developing its armed forces as a basic aspect
 of national power. With Soviet assistance, it
 has become by far the strongest Asian mili-
 tary power. The ground forces of the People's
 Liberation Army total 2,500,000, many of
 whom are battle tested and most of whom are
 fairly well trained.  The air arm, including
 naval aviation, is estimated to have 395 jet
 light bombers and 1,475 jet fighters.  The
 naval forces include four destroyers and 13
 submarines, with additional units under con-
 struction, and an estimated 315 aircraft.                                                                     Of
 the latter, 160 are jet light bombers and 30
 are jet fighters.
 39. The armed forces probably will not in-
 crease their personnel strength in the next
 few years, but the power of these forces will
 grow as the ground force and the air arm
 are more completely equipped with improved
 weapons, and as the navy completes or ac-
 quires additional submarines and large patrol
 vessels.  Communist China will remain de-
 pendent on the USSR for most major items
 of military equipment and a large part of
 its POL supplies during the period of this
 estimate.

 death of Stalin and particularly because of
 the prominent role they have played in Bloc
 affairs in the past year.  Communist China's
 initial reaction to Soviet criticism of Stalin
 was one of aloofness and noninvolvement,
 with Peiping taking care to point out Stalin's
 "strong points" as well as his "weaknesses."
 However, as a result of the Polish and Hun-
 garian crises, Peiping has become increasing-
 ly involved in Eastern European affairs.  It
 has asserted the necessity for each Commu-
 nist country to develop with due regard to
 its own political and social backgrounds, has
 pointed out that no one Communist country
 is entitled to adopt an attitude of superiority
 over other Communist countries, and prob-
 ably has favored a more flexible approach in
 Soviet relations with the Satellites.  Commu-
 nist China has so far not joined in Soviet
 criticism of the Polish press and there is
 some evidence of Sino-Soviet differences on
 Poland. On the other hand, it supported the
 Soviet use of force in Hungary and has in-
 sisted that the first duty of all Communist
 countries is loyalty to international proleta-
 rian solidarity under the leadership of the
 Soviet Union.
 41. The tone of authority in the Chinese Com-
 munist statements and the need apparently
 felt by the Kremlin for Chinese support on
 Eastern European issues have made a deep
 impression on the Communist world, and have
 further weakened the concept that Moscow is
 the only, authoritative interpreter of Commu-
 nist ideological guidance. The actions of the
 Chinese Communists would appear to suggest
 an awareness of the need for some concessions
 to nationalism in the interests of Bloc soli-
 darity.
 42. The Chinese Communists, in many cases,
 are the channel through which Asian Commu-
 nist parties receive guidance, although most
 of these parties probably look to the Soviet
 Union for leadership.  The Chinese Commu-
 nists exercise substantial influence in North
 Vietnam and North Korea. Communist China
 has extended a credit of $320 million to each
 of these countries, continues to maintain large
 forces in North Korea, and is the principal
 supplier of military assistance for North Viet-
 nam.  Communist China is developing in-
 fluence in Outer Mongolia, which until recent-
 ly was an exclusive preserve of the USSR. In
 1956, the Chinese Communists extended a
 $40 million credit over a four year period to
 assist the Mongolians in the construction of
 light industrial facilities, and supplied a large
 number of technicians.
 43. During the period of this estimate, Peiping
 will probably further increase its influence
 within the Communist Bloc and have an im-
 portant voice in matters affecting the Bloc
 as a whole.  However, Communist China will
 continue to rely on the USSR and the Com-
 munist Bloc as the chief source of the im-
 ports, aid, and technical assistance essential
 to its military and economic programs.  In
 addition, Peiping will almost certainly con-
 tinue to rely on Soviet military guarantees
 as its chief insurance against what it regards
 as the danger of US attack.  Although it is
 probable that some conflicts of interest and
 disagreements will develop between Moscow
 and Peiping, it is highly unlikely that either
 will permit 'such conflicts to impair Sino-Soviet
 solidarity.
 III. COMMUNIST CHINA'S RELATIONS WITH
 THE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD
 44. Communist China's influence has in-
 creased markedly in the  non-Communist
 world, and its presence is especially felt in
 Asia. It has formal diplomatic. ties with less
 than one-third of the countries of the world,
 but these include India, Burma, Indonesia,
 Ceylon, and Pakistan.  There is a growing
 pressure for normalization of relations with
 Communist China, especially in Japan, in
 Western Europe, and in the British Common-
 wealth.  US influence has been the major
 factor in preventing a much greater number
 from  recognizing  Communist  China  and
 agreeing to its admission to the UN. 8
 45. Communist China has broadened' its con-
 tacts, even with those countries with which it
 does not have diplomatic relations.  It has
 expanded trade with many countries in the
 non-Communist world and has regularly par-
 ticipated in trade fairs.  There has been a

 munist China.

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 steady increase in the exchange of official and
 unofficial delegations and Chinese Commu-
 nists have frequently cultivated specific tar-
 gets such as professional, intellectual, and re-
 ligious groups and offered them free tours to
 mainland China.
 46. In order to promote trade ties with under-
 developed countries, Communist China has in
 several cases selected items for trade because
 of their political impact. For example, despite
 a shortage of steel in Communist China, 37,000
 tons were exported to Egypt in the first half
 of 1956.  Other examples have been the rice-
 for-rubber deal with Ceylon, the Sino-Burma
 trade ageement, and the suggestions to Japan
 that large amounts of coal and iron ore would
 be available in exchange for machinery and
 steel.
 47. The Chinese Communists have also used
 economic assistance to gain influence.  The
 Sino-Cambodia aid agreement, which was
 signed in June 1956, provides for a grant-
 in-aid of about $22.4 million during 1956 and
 1957 in the form of technical assistance, con-
 struction materials, and merchandise.                         Both
 countries have stressed the "unconditional na-
 ture" of this aid. Under an agreement signed
 in October 1956, Nepal is to receive grants
 totaling approximately $12.6 million over a
 three year period.  The Lao government has
 not yet acted on Chinese Communist offers of
 assistance.
 48. The Chinese Communists have demon-
 strated interest in developing the Asian
 African Bloc as an instrument to weaken
 Western economic and political influence in
 underdeveloped areas.  At the 1955 Bandung
 Conference Chou En-lai took a leading part
 and actively supported the "Bandung spirit
 of peaceful coexistence."  This has since be-
 come one of the main slogans of Chinese Com-
 munist foreign policy, designed to convince
 non-Communist Asian nations of the peaceful
 intentions of Communist China and to facili-
 tate an increase in Communist influence in
 these areas.
 49. Emphasis on the "Bandung spirit of peace=
 ful coexistence", however, has not caused the
 Chinese Communists to cease their efforts to
 gain the allegiance of Overseas Chinese com-
 munities, or to abandon subversive activities
 in Southeast Asia.  Moreover, the buildup of
 Chinese Communist military capabilities and
 occasional border incursions constitute a con-
 tinuing pressure on neighboring countries.
 50. Peiping is attempting to increase its in-
 fluence, and eliminate that of Nationalist
 China, in the Overseas Chinese communities,
 especially those of Southeast Asia.  It is at-
 tempting to obtain control of local Chinese
 schools, newspapers, organizations, and lead-
 ers, and is conducting a large scale propa-
 ganda campaign to revive interest in Chinese
 culture.  In mainland China, preferential
 treatment has been promised to Overseas Chi-
 nese students and to relatives of Overseas
 Chinese. Although these efforts have resulted
 in some increase in Communist China's influ-
 ence among Overseas Chinese, the bulk of the
 latter still appear to be intent on improving
 their positions in their resident countries, and
 seek to avoid involvement in the struggle for
 their allegiance.
 51. The Chinese Communists are giving covert
 support to indigenous Communist groups in
 Asia.  This policy has been followed even in
 the neutralist countries despite its adverse
 effects on Chinese Communist relations with
 the governments concerned.  In Burma, the
 government is concerned over the assistance
 given by the Chinese Communist Embassy
 to the local Communists. Many Indonesians,
 particularly in the army and the Moslem par-
 ties, are disturbed by the ties between the
 Indonesian Communist Party and Peiping.
 The Indian government is concerned by the
 probability that the Chinese Communists are
 giving assistance to the Communists in Nepal
 and the possibility that the Naga tribes have
 received arms from Communist China.
 52. The Chinese Communists have continued
 to increase their military capabilities in the
 Taiwan Strait area, although Chinese Com-
 munist propaganda speaks almost exclusively
 of the intention to "liberate" Taiwan by
 "peaceful" means.  Peiping has adopted a
 "moderate" attitude toward the Nationalists,
 offering potential defectors positions in the
 Peiping regime corresponding to those of ex-
 Nationalist collaborators in Communist China.
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Peiping propaganda directed toward Taiwan
 attempts to create the impression that the
 US is an unreliable ally for the National gov-
 ernment and that the latter will inevitably
 collapse. Despite Peiping's seemingly concili-
 atory attitude toward Taiwan, the Chinese
 Communists continue to reject categorically
 any suggestions for a compromise solution
 to  the  Taiwan  problem  involving  "two
 Chinas"; they equally reject suggestions for
 a meaningful renunciation of force in the
 Taiwan area.
 53. The attitude of Communist China toward
 the US continues to be one of hostility and
 mistrust and its policy is directed toward de-
 stroying the US position in the Far East.
 Peiping portrays -the US as the chief threat
 to peace in Asia and the world and the source
 of most of the problems facing the countries
 of Asia.  Nevertheless, the Chinese Commu-
 nists have made some gestures to create the
 impression that current Communist "peace"
 tactics apply also to relations with the US.
 These gestures, however, appear to be directed
 not at improving relations with the US, but
 at undermining US policies and creating a
 belief, particularly in Asia, that a shift in the
 US attitude toward the Chinese Communists
 is imminent.
 The Asian Impression of Communist
 China
 54. The Chinese Communists have been able
 to create the impression in much of non-
 Communist Asia that Communist China is a
 dynamic, permanent, and perhaps not un-
 friendly world power, which will exert a major
 influence on the course of events in Asia.
 Many Asians are impressed by the effective
 control which the Chinese Communists exer-
 cise over the tremendous area and population
 of mainland China, by the sweeping socializa-
 tion of the country, by the steady and sub-
 stantial increases in military capability and
 industrial capacity, and by the growing abil-
 ity of Communist China to trade with and to
 extend economic assistance to other countries.
 55. These achievements are of particular sig-
 nificance to the people and leaders in many
 countries of non-Communist Asia because
 they too are seeking to make profound social
 and economic as well as political changes,
 and the Chinese Communist pattern appears
 in certain respects to offer a solution to many
 of their problems, which they are tempted to
 adopt.  Many of the people and leaders in
 these countries are inclined to pay more at-
 tention to the apparent material progress in
 Communist China than to the methods by
 which it was attained.
 56. Many Asians, in part because of their con-
 tinuing distrust of Western intentions, have
 been impressed by Communist China's anti-
 colonialist propaganda and do not believe
 that the Chinese Communists intend to ex-
 tend their control throughout Asia.  Their
 receptivity to this propaganda is encouraged
 by the tendency in Asia to equate capitalism
 and  private  enterprise  with colonialism.
 There is also a tendency among many Asians
 to accept the Communist charges that the
 US program of developing military pacts and
 bases is a colonialist policy which threatens
 the independence of Asian countries. and in-
 creases the danger of war.
 57. Although Communist China has been able
 to exploit Asian distrust of Western intentions,
 there is also an undercurrent of apprehension
 regarding Communist China's real intentions.
 This apprehension has been caused by Com-
 munist China's role in international Commu-
 nism, particularly its connections with the
 support of indigenous Communist movements
 in individual Asian countries, and by mistrust
 in many Asian countries of historical Chinese
 expansionism.  Peiping's efforts to exploit the
 Overseas Chinese communities in most South-
 east Asian countries have also created fears
 of its intentions, as have Communist China's
 activities in border areas, and its support of
 recent Soviet repression in Hungary.
 58. Asians realize that Communist China is
 now the strongest Asian military power, and
 that they are dependent upon the US for
 defense against a possible Communist attack.
 Because of their dislike of such dependence
 and their concern as to the effectiveness of
 US action in their defense, many prominent
 Asians, especially in South and Southeast
 countries, have come to believe that they
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 should show discretion in some form of neu-
 tralism or at least a willingness to be friendly
 and to reciprocate Chinese Communist over-
 tures, and finally, that if a trend toward Com-
 munist success should develop, they should not
 be the last to attempt some form of political
 accommodation. Many Asian leaders seem to
 have confidence that, even though they in-
 crease their political and economic contacts
 with Communist China, they will be able to
 resist attempts to encroach upon their politi-
 cal independence. These factors exist to some
 extent even in many of the countries aligned
 with the US. At the same time, even in non-
 aligned neutralist countries there is a wide-
 spread, though seldom publicly voiced, recog-
 nition of the importance of the US in restrain-
 ing Communist China from overt aggression.
 IV. PROBABLE CHINESE COMMUNIST
 EXTERNAL COURSES OF ACTION
 59. The Chinese Communists, in their ap-
 proach to international problems, will prob-
 ably endeavor to appear conciliatory and flex-
 ible, but joint Sino-Soviet policy will in fact
 permit no major concessions to the West on
 basic issues such as Taiwan or the status of
 North Korea and North Vietnam.  Commu-
 nist China will continue to encourage the
 neutralist,  anticolonialist,  and nationalist
 sentiments in Asia and will continue its efforts
 to discredit US actions and motives and to
 seek a reduction in Western influence and
 military power in Asia.  It will encourage
 wherever possible the formation of govern-
 ments in which the Communist influence
 could be expanded.  Communist China will
 almost certainly increase its official and un-
 official contacts with the governments and
 people in non-Communist Asia, and will prob-
 ably continue to increase trade with non-Com-
 munist countries, especially with Japan and
 other Asian countries. ? Peiping will also prob-
 ably offer economic assistance to selected non-
 Communist countries and will propagandize
 the "nonpolitical" nature of such assistance.
 Peiping will continue its attempts to acquire
 influence over, and the support and allegiance
 of, the Chinese residing in non-Communist
 Asia. Peiping will continue to seek admission
 to the UN.
 60. Despite a "soft" . policy toward its Asian
 neighbors, Communist China will continue its
 subversive efforts, will probably apply pres-
 sure on a selective basis to remind the Asians
 of its power, and will take advantage of oppor-
 tunities for Communist expansion, possibly
 including the extension of support to armed
 revolts against non-Communist governments.
 During the period of this estimate, Peiping
 will probably try to avoid courses of action
 which it believes would provoke US military
 intervention. However, the possibility cannot
 be excluded that the Chinese Communists will
 step up military action against the offshore
 islands, or will attempt to seize one of- the
 smaller islands, to test US intentions and to
 increase external pressure on the US to bring
 about  a Nationalist  evacuation  of  these
 islands.  If the Chinese Communists became
 convinced that the US would not assist in
 the defense of these islands with its own
 forces, they probably would attempt to seize
 them.  Should the Communist regimes in
 North Vietnam or North Korea be subject to
 external  attack the  Chinese Communists
 would almost certainly give material support
 to the Communist regimes in these countries
 and would if necessary commit "volunteer"
 units to avoid a defeat. However, the Chinese
 Communists would probably seek to limit the
 area of conflict and to obtain a cease fire.
 61. The US.  Communist China recognizes
 that the US is the chief obstacle to its ambi-
 tions in Asia.                                                                Its efforts will almost certain-
 ly continue to be centered on neutralizing
 sources of US support, isolating the US from
 its allies, and, ultimately, destroying the US
 position in Asia.  However, in its. "peace"
 strategy, Peiping may make conciliatory ges-
 tures relating to peripheral questions in an
 effort to create the impression of reasonable-
 ness.  Peiping will almost certainly continue
 to press for a meeting with the US at the
 foreign ministers' level, and will exploit oppor-
 tunities for other contacts that may present
 themselves.
 62. Taiwan.  Peiping remains determined to
 obtain control of Taiwan.  However, the Pei-
 ping regime apparently recognizes that its
 military forces will not be able to seize Tai-
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 wan against US military opposition. In con-
 sequence, Peiping is attempting to reduce
 morale on Taiwan, in the hope that National-
 ist leaders may ultimately be induced to nego-
 tiate with Peiping over Taiwan's assimilation
 into Communist China. A major objective in
 any conference with the US would be to in-
 duce the removal of US military protection
 from Taiwan.  The Chinese Communists will
 continue to improve their military capabili-
 ties in the area opposite Taiwan and the off-
 shore islands, but they will almost certainly
 not attempt to seize Taiwan by force so long
 as the US is committed to its defense.  (See
 paragraph 60.)
 63. Korea. The Chinese Communists, in com-
 mon with the USSR, hope to secure a with-
 drawal of UN forces from Korea and even-
 tually to eliminate the ROK.  As a means of
 putting pressure on the US to withdraw its
 troops, there may be additional withdrawals
 of Chinese Communist forces, but they will
 almost certainly maintain adequate forces in
 Manchuria to permit immediate reinterven-
 tion.  The Communists will almost certainly
 refuse any settlement in Korea which en-
 dangers Communist control of North Korea.
 64. Japan.  Communist China in conjunction
 with the Soviet Union will continue to seek to
 neutralize Japan and prevent its re-emergence
 as a major military and political power in
 Asia. It will attempt to weaken Japan's links
 with the US by exploiting US-Japanese policy
 differences.  The Chinese Communists will
 seek to increase the tolerance for Communism
 among the Socialists and other groups. They
 will probably also offer trade inducements,
 seeking both to increase Sino-Japanese trade
 and- to induce Japan to break the CHINCOM
 embargoes.  Communist China will also seek
 to increase significantly cultural and other
 semiofficial contacts with Japan, anticipating
 the establishment of formal diplomatic rela-
 tions.  These policies will contribute to the
 weakening of Japan's willingness to support
 US policy toward Communist China.
 65. Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.  Peiping
 will continue to support the Vietnamese Com-
 munists in their efforts to extend Communist
 control to South Vietnam and will probably
 act in concert with Hanoi to expand Com-
 munist influence in Cambodia and Laos.
 Through pressure, subversion, and overt prop-
 aganda the two Communist regimes will at-
 tempt to discredit and undermine the author-
 ity of the Diem government.  The Chinese
 Communists probably will not encourage
 North Vietnam to initiate open hostilities
 against Diem, but might encourage Hanoi to
 initiate guerrilla activities.  In the event a
 weak government came to power in South
 Vietnam, Peiping might adopt a conciliatory
 approach in order to encourage a neutralist
 development.  Toward Cambodia and Laos,
 the Chinese Communists will continue their
 gestures of friendship and goodwill and will
 probably not engage in overt hostile propa-
 ganda, at least so long as the authorities in
 these two governments reciprocate. Commu-
 nist` China will probably expand its relations
 with both.countries and formal diplomatic re-
 lations are likely to be established.
 66. Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines.
 Although Chinese Communist efforts have
 thus far concentrated on the uncommitted
 nations, the coming years are likely to see
 greater emphasis on the states allied with
 the West, including Pakistan, Thailand, and
 the Philippines as the Asian members of
 SEATO. Peiping will seek to exploit growing
 sentiment for trade with the mainland, will
 encourage "informal" contacts as an entering
 wedge, and will attempt to exacerbate politi-
 cal disputes within these countries over na-
 tional policies concerning relations with the
 West.
 67. Indonesia.   The  Chinese  Communists
 probably estimate that the capabilities of the
 Indonesian Communist Party, the strongest
 indigenous Communist Party in non-Commu-
 nist Asia, will continue to be maximized if
 they themselves maintain a friendly attitude
 toward the Indonesian government. The Chi-
 nese Communists will continue to give covert
 support to the Indonesian Communists.
 68. Malaya and Singapore. Peiping will prob-
 ably continue to encourage Malayan Commu-
 nists to work for popular front governments,
 to extend control over Chinese youth and the
 labor movement, and, at the same time to
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 maintain in being their guerrilla organization.
 Following the achievement of independence
 in Malaya (expected in August 1957) and self-
 government in Singapore, Peiping will seek
 to obtain recognition by these governments
 and will try to promote greater Chinese politi-
 cal influence in relation to the Malay popula-
 tion.
 69. India.  Although Communist China will
 seek eventually to supplant Indian influence
 in Asia, it will probably continue, at least for
 the next few years, to strengthen friendly re-
 lations with India and to encourage India's
 efforts to bolster a neutralist sentiment
 throughout Asia and the Middle East.  But
 this general approach will probably not cause
 the Chinese Communists to cease their efforts
 to increase their influence in the Indo-Tibetan
 border area.
 70. Burma.  Peiping will continue its efforts
 to woo the Burmese government while at the
 same time encouraging the Communist ele-
 ments in the country. Communist China will
 probably be willing to agree to a settlement
 of the boundary dispute on terms that appear
 conciliatory but is unlikely to cease its sub-
 14
 versive activities among the ethnic minorities
 in the border region.
 71. Hong Kong  and Macao.   Communist
 China is committed to *the ultimate incorpora-
 tion of Hong Kong and Macao in its terri-
 tory although this has not been stated as ex-
 plicitly as in the case of Taiwan.                                                               However,
 for the period of this estimate the Chinese
 Communists will probably not attempt to seize
 these colonies by force. Non-Communist
 Hong Kong and Macao have a certain utility
 to Peiping as points of contact with the West;
 furthermore, Peiping probably believes that
 an attack on Hong Kong at least would in-
 volve hostilities with the UK and possibly
 with the US as well. Nevertheless, during the
 period of this estimate, Communist China will
 attempt to exploit frictions which arise over
 Hong Kong and Macao.  Peiping will almost
 certainly continue unabated its campaign
 through outright subversion and "peaceful
 penetration" to increase its political and eco-
 nomic influence in Hong Kong and Macao,
 to reduce the effectiveness of these areas as
 Western listening posts, and to undermine
 the resolve of the UK and Portugal to main-
 tain their positions.

 APPENDIX A
 THE ECONOMY OF COMMUNIST CHINA
 Industry
 1. The. regime during the First Five Year
 Plan has concentrated its investment on heavy
 industry, especially machine building, metal-
 lurgy, power, and armaments.  As a result,
 industrial production (excluding individual
 handicraft) has expanded at an average an-
 nual rate of about 17 percent while the output
 of heavy industry has attained a rate of in-
 crease of about 20 percent.  (See Table A I.)
 Although the regime has announced a policy
 of decentralizing industry, investment in in-
 dustry in the First Five Year Plan has not
 altered the basic concentration of production
 in the established industrial areas of Man-
 . churia, North China, and Shanghai.
 2. Engineering Industries. Communist China
 is seeking to develop engineering industries
 which will ultimately be capable of producing
 its. own requirements of machinery, equip-
 ment, and armaments.  The engineering in-
 dustries have become self-sufficient in the pro-
 duction of textile machinery, and are increas-
 ing the volume of the production of some types
 of machine tools (after Soviet Bloc proto-
 types), agricultural equipment, and transpor-
 tation equipment.  (See Table A II.) . In Sep-
 tember 1956 the Communists announced the
 assembly (probably at Mukden North Airfield)
 The analysis in this appendix is based on esti-
 mates which are largely dependent on Chinese
 Communist statistics.  Although Chinese Com-
 munist statistics often cannot be confirmed by
 independent sources, careful examination and
 comparison with independent data that are
 available strongly suggest that these figures con-
 stitute the basic economic data available to the
 regime and that in most instances there ap-
 pears to have been no motive to inflate these
 data.  Where inaccuracies exist, they appear,
 for the most part, to be the result of ambiguous
 definitions of the data, deficiencies and in-
 experience in data collection, provisional re-
 porting, pressure to report fulfillment of plans,
 and incomplete and selective reporting of the
 data to support certain policy points of view.
 of a jet aircraft, but they almost certainly used
 Soviet components. We believe their ability to
 produce aircraft and their components will
 probably increase markedly during the period
 of this estimate.  The Chinese Communists
 still must depend largely on imports for chem-
 ical and refining equipment and for electron-
 ics machinery, although the completion of the
 telecommunications production center near
 Peiping in late 1958 will enable them to pro-
 duce a sizable quantity of electronics com-
 ponents and some of the more complicated
 electronics and telecommunications equip-
 ment.  Although the armaments industry is
 advancing along with general industrial de-
 velopment, production capacity has not been
 established for most heavy military end-items.
 3.. Metallurgy.  The Chinese Communists are
 making rapid progress in expanding their
 steel production and are estimated to have
 raised steel ingot output from 1.35 million tons
 in 1952 to 4.5 million tons in 1956.  However,
 in 1956 they still had to import 15-20 percent
 of their total supply of steel products. Steel
 production continues to be hampered by low
 quality coking coal and iron ore, and by a
 deficiency of the alloying elements, chromium
 and nickel.  While there has been some prog-
 ress in the production of other metals, there
 is a continuing deficiency in the production
 of copper and aluminum.
 4. Electric Power and Coal.  Although elec-
 tric power production has been increasing at
 an average rate of 20 percent annually since
 1952, it has not quite kept pace with industrial
 demand.  Coal production, despite announced
 shortages, generally has been adequate to
 meet essential domestic demand and even to
 allow for limited exports.
 5. Petroleum.  The production of petroleum
 and petroleum products in 1956 equalled about
 one-third ' of domestic consumption, -and siz-
 able imports of crude oil and refined products

 The values given are for estimated income originating in 1955 prices.  The figures differ from gross value
 figures given in Communist reports in that the figures in the table exclude indirect taxes and the costs of
 raw materials and fuel to avoid double counting, The indices also differ because they are based on phys-
 ical production estimates for specific commodities including the production estimates given in Tables A II
 and A III.

 INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT - COMMUNIST CHINA
 (Estimated for 1952-1957 and Chinese Communist goals for 1962)
 NOTE: The figures in this table should be used with caution (see footnote on page 1 of this Appendix). The
 estimates are subject to varying margins of error, some of which might be considerable. The estimated pro-
 duction of industrial products projected for 1957 depends upon construction or improvement of capacity, the
 assimilation of advanced techniques by the Chinese Communists, and continued importation of capital goods
 from the West and the Bloc at approximately present levels.  The figures for 1952 are the mid-points in the
 ranges given by the Chinese Communists in their Second Five Year Plan.  We believe the investment plan
 needed to attain these goals is not feasible. The Chinese Communists apparently recognize this situation and
 there are indications that they are presently revising their program which will probably result in a down-
 ward revision of a number of the goals.

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 continue to be necessary.  The quality and
 variety of petroleum products have been im-
 proved and a relatively complete line is now
 produced.  The major exceptions are aircraft
 fuels and high grade lubricants, which in 1955
 constituted about one-fourth of the total im-
 ports of POL.  Deficiencies in refined prod-
 ucts will be partially corrected when the
 Lanchou refinery comes into production, prob-
 ably in 1958, and when the Yumen refinery
 begins production of the high quality lubri-
 cants which it has been testing.  Plans were
 announced in September 1956 to increase an-
 nual crude oil production (natural and syn-
 thetic) from the 1956 level of about 1.2 million
 tons to about five or six million tons by 1962.
 Much of this increase depends on higher pro-
 duction in the Yumen fields, and exploitation
 of newly discovered, but incompletely proven,
 fields in the Tsaidam and Dzungaria Basins.
 Even with substantial attainment of the 1962
 targets, it is probable that Communist China
 by 1962 will still have to import substantial
 quantities of aviation fuels and high grade
 lubricants.
 6. Other Industry. The chemical industry has
 not been developed significantly, and over two-
 thirds of the very modest state investment
 in this field has probably been for fertilizer.
 Chemical fertilizer output probably will be in-
 creased significantly in the next few years
 though large imports will still be required.
 The cement industry, despite remarkable ad-
 vances since 1949, was not able to meet the
 high domestic demand in 1956 in part because
 of exports to the USSR.  The Chinese Com-.
 munists have announced plans to double the
 1956 output by 1962.
 7. The growth of light industry has been and
 will continue to be limited by a low investment
 priority and by shortages of agricultural raw
 materials. However, the Chinese Communists
 probably over-fulfilled their 1956 goals in the
 cotton textile industry, which accounts for
 about one-third of the total value of light in-
 dustry.  Chinese light industry is generally
 plagued with the problem of poor quality.
 This results from the absence of effective qual-
 ity controls and from the pressure to stretch
 raw materials and to increase output per
 worker.
 Agriculture
 8. Agricultural production has expanded at
 an annual average rate of nearly three percent
 during the period 1952-1956.  (See Table
 A III.)  Output per unit of land has been in-
 creased, primarily through greater use of fer-
 tilizers and increased irrigation.                                                                Some addi-
 tional land has also been brought under culti-
 vation.
 9. The expansion of major crops does not ap-
 pear to have been hindered by the wholesale
 collectivization of agriculture in 1955-1956,
 although the output of other farm prod-
 ucts has apparently been adversely affected.
 Farmers have traditionally produced such
 items as tung oil, tea, silk, hogs, and other
 commodities as a supplementary activity. But
 the winter construction programs and other
 duties assigned by the newly organized col-
 lectives reduced the time available for, and
 the incentive to engage in, such activity.
 Transportation
 10. Communist China's transportation sys-
 tem relies heavily on railroads, which present-
 ly carry the bulk of total inland traffic ' and
 the major share of trade with the USSR. 2
 There is an extensive inland waterway sys-
 tem operating primarily in Central China.
 There is important coastal traffic from Shang-
 hai north, a substantial share of which is car-
 ried by the Chinese merchant marine.  The
 road system is generally poor, although in-
 creasing emphasis is being placed on road
 improvement and on the construction of stra-
 tegic roads.  Communist China is entirely
 dependent on foreign vessels for ocean ship-
 ping, which in 1955 carried over 50 percent of
 ' The Chinese Communists have announced that
 the railroads originated 193.4 million tons of
 freight in 1955, or about 10 percent less than the
 plan goal.  We believe that the actual tonnage
 originated may have been less than the an-
 nounced figure. *
 *The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The
 Joint Staff, does not agree with the above
 footnote which could be read to imply that the
 difference between the actual tonnage ini-
 tiated and the Chinese Communist announced
 figure may be slight.  He believes that there
 is insufficient evidence to judge the degree of
 error involved.

 'Estimates of physical production in the agricultural sector are subject to serious limitations in statistical
 reporting and coverage.  Agricultural output data seem to show a substantial upward bias believed to
 reflect in part increased statistical coverage as local reporting is improved and in part the unreliable
 sampling procedures on which the crop reporting is based.  The tonnages involved are very large and
 changes in total production are small in relation to the level of production.  The estimated trends in
 physical production for the basic food crops are based primarily on increases in cultivated land, land
 under irrigation, and capabilities of fertilizer.  Production trends are considered somewhat more reliable
 than the level of production in any one year.

 its total foreign trade.  (See Table A V.)  The
 civil air fleet plays a very limited role.  The
 telecommunications net is poorly developed.
 11. Railroads. The railroad network (see map
 at the end of the estimate) is largely con-
 centrated in the east and northeast where it
 connects important industrial and population
 centers.  Traffic consists largely of the move-
 ment of a few bulk commodities from a rel-
 atively small number of places of origin to
 a few principal destinations.  Transport of
 coal, the most important single item shipped,
 makes up more than one-third of the total
 rail traffic, while agricultural products and
 construction materials each make up about
 one-fifth.
 12. The railroads received some 13 percent of
 total state. investment during the period 1953-
 1957.  About one-half of this was allocated
 to the construction of additional lines, about
 3,000 miles of which have been completed,
 principally in western areas.  The opening of
 the Trans-Mongolian link with the Trans-
 Siberian railroad in January 1956, the con-
 struction of the line westward from Lanchou,
 via Yumen and Urumchi to connect with the
 Soviet system near Aktogay, and the comple-
 tion of the projected line into the Tsaidam
 (oil) basin, all will have an important impact
 on the opening of new areas in the west and
 will facilitate trade with the USSR.  Work is
 also underway on sections of track which will
 provide an additional north-south .trunk line
 parallel to, and west of, the Peiping-Hankow-
 Canton line.  This line will pass through Pao-
 tou, Lanchou, Chengtu, Chungking, and Kun-
 ming, and will ultimately provide a Chinese
 inner belt line linking North Vietnam and the
 Soviet Union.  Other new lines such as the
 Litang-Fort Bayard line and the recently com-
 pleted Yingtan-Amoy line have greatly in-
 creased Chinese Communist military logistic
 capabilities in these strategic areas.
 13. The other half of the total investment in
 railroads was devoted to improving the physi-
 cal plant and equipment of existing rail lines.
 The program included the construction and
 restoration of double tracking, the develop-
 ment of yard facilities, the installation of
 communications  equipment,  a sizable in-
 crease in the rolling stock inventory of higher
 capacity freight cars, and the adoption of a
 new central system of administration.
 14. Despite the increased capacities and in-
 tensive utilization of facilities and equipment,
 there have been indications since 1954 that
 the development of rail facilities has not kept
 pace with the increase in the volume of traffic.
 In 1956 as a result of the sharp increase in
 demand arising out of the rapid acceleration
 in industrial development, the inadequacy of
 line capacities became a major transport prob-
 lem.                                                            In particular, during the past year there
 have been increased references to the general
 lack of adequate transportation and to con-
 gestion, particularly on key sections of such
 rail lines as the Peiping-Hankow, the Lunghai,
 and the Shihmen-Taiyuan railways, and at
 important border transloading points.
 15. We believe that the railroads, though over-
 strained, have met most of the requirements
 of the economy.  However, railroad capacity
 will be an increasingly critical factor as the
 economy shifts from a decentralized agricul-
 tural economy to an increasingly industrial-
 ized economy.  To deal with this problem the
 regime will have to increase its investment in
 rail transportation, particularly in expanding
 the capacities of existing lines.
 16. Shipping. The small merchant marine,
 estimated at 112 ships of over 1,000 gross
 registered tons (GRT) (287,300 dead weight
 tonnage (DWT)), is restricted to coastal runs
 from Shanghai north except for a small ex-
 port trade to North Vietnam.  It, however,
 shares control with Poland over the services
 provided by Polish vessels on the China run.
 17. There was an increase of almost 20 per-
 cent in the gross registered tonnage of the
 ships arriving in Communist China in 1955.3
 (See Table A IV.)  Communist China con-
 tinued to be heavily dependent on non-Bloc
 shipping, much of it chartered, which ac-
 counted for 81 percent of the tonnage of all
 1955 arrivals.  Moreover, non-Bloc shipyards
 render important shipbuilding and repair
 fl Incomplete data indicate an even greater in-
 crease in tonnage arriving in 1956, with non-
 Bloc shipping increasing by about 26 percent.

 mainder of non-Bloc arrivals originated in
 Eastern European or South Asian ports.  Voy-
 ages of Soviet Bloc shipping engaged in trade
 with China originated largely from Bloc ports,
 especially Poland and the Soviet Far East.
 In 1955 there was a sharp increase in the
 number of Bloc tankers from Europe which
 unloaded POL in the Soviet Far East before
 proceeding in ballast to Communist China to
 pick up return cargoes.  As a result, 59 per-
 cent of Bloc ships arriving in Communist
 China came from the Soviet Far East, but
 only 39 percent of Bloc ships leaving Commu-
 nist China went to that area.  .
 19. A number of ships under non-Bloc flags
 were  engaged  intermittently  in  domestic
 coastal trade for the Chinese Communists in
 1955 and contributed a valuable service not
 reflected in arrival figures. Bloc ships gener-
 ally do not engage in coastal shipping.
 Foreign Trade
 20. Programs to industrialize the economy
 and to increase the military capabilities con-
 tinue to be highly dependent on imports of
 machinery and of military equipment.  To
 meet these requirements, the regime has pro-
 gressively increased its exports of agricultural
 products (which account for four-fifths of
 total exports) and of industrial raw materials
 including  minerals.  By  1955, Communist
 China's total foreign trade was estimated to
 be about $4.5 billion, 30 percent above 1954
 and about 250 percent above 1950.  (See Table
 A V.) About 80 percent of Communist China's
 trade was with the Bloc, with imports of about
 $2 billion and exports of about $1.5 billion.
 The import surplus was probably covered in
 large part by loans from the USSR covering
 both economic and military equipment.  Com-
 munist China exported about $450 million to
 the non-Communist countries and imported
 about $420 million from those countries.
 Communist China's ability to export will be
 hampered by increasing domestic demands
 for agricultural products, the poor quality of
 processed goods, and a fall-off in the pro-
 duction of subsidiary farm products.

 21. About two-thirds of the value of imports
 from the Soviet Bloc in 1955 consisted of
 machinery, equipment, and essential supplies
 such as POL, nonferrous metals, fertilizers,
 and other chemicals, and the bulk of the re-
 mainder was probably military equipment in-
 cluding the transfer of Soviet military equip-
 ment and facilities in China.  Imports from
 non-Communist countries were textile raw
 materials (29 percent), drugs and chemicals
 (26 percent), metals and machinery (18 per-
 cent), rubber (7 percent), and miscellaneous
 items (20 percent), mainly foodstuffs, coconut
 oil, and paper.
 22. Preliminary data indicate that Commu-
 nist China's trade in 1956 was about $4.3 bil-
 lion. Compared to 1955, trade with the Soviet
 Bloc appeared to have declined by roughly
 10 percent.  However, if the value of Soviet
 military goods and installations located in

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Communist China, transferred to that country
 in 1955, is excluded from the 1955 figures,
 trade in 1956 with the Bloc probably increased
 slightly.
 23. Preliminary reports indicate that trade
 with non-Bloc countries in 1956 was consid-
 erably above the corresponding 1955 level.
 Imports under the CHINCOM "exceptions pro-
 cedures" increased sharply during 1956. The
 amounts licensed for shipment were approxi-
 mately $70 million, as compared with a total
 of about $15 million for the four year period
 1952-1955.  If goods licensed in 1956 were
 delivered, they would represent about 16 per-
 cent of total. imports from non-Bloc countries.
 Two categories, iron and steel products and
 motor vehicles and equipment, accounted for
 over half of the exceptions shipments. Other
 significant categories were tinplate, excava-
 tors and cranes, metal-working machinery,
 and power equipment. The principal export-
 ers were the UK, West Germany, France, Italy,
 and Japan.
 24. The maintenance of effective multilateral
 trade controls would continue to hamper Chi-
 nese Communist economic and military devel-
 opment by complicating import problems, in-
 creasing costs, and reducing flexibility.  Fur-
 thermore, present unilateral US financial con-
 trols will continue to deny to the Chinese Com-
 munists remittances as well as a significant
 former export market.  Although increased
 trade with the Free World would almost cer-
 tainly. develop if CHINCOM controls were re-
 laxed to the level presently maintained with
 the European Bloc, such increases would prob-
 ably not constitute a substantial reorienta-
 tion of Chinese Communist trade. We believe
 that such a relaxation of controls could in-
 crease Communist China's annual import ca-
 pabilities and would increase its flexibility in
 planning, procurement, and shipment. How-
 ever, Communist China's basic foreign and do-
 mestic policies would probably not be signifi-
 cantly changed in either case.
 25. The Suez closure is having an adverse ef-
 fect on Communist China's seaborne foreign
 trade.  Cargo shipments have been curtailed,
 although alternative,, costly rail facilities are
 being used for the most important items. Of
 total trade, over 40 percent by volume is nor-
 mally carried through the Suez canal. If the
 canal should remain closed for a prolonged
 period, the Chinese Communists would suffer
 from delays, dislocation, and increased costs
 for many of their imports.  Moreover, they
 would be faced with a difficult problem in
 storing agricultural products, the export of
 which would almost certainly be delayed. Po-
 tentially the most serious impact upon the
 Chinese Communists would develop if non-
 Bloc vessels (which in 1955 provided 81 per-
 cent of tonnage arrivals in Communist China)
 were diverted to other trade.
 Science and Technology
 26. Communist China is severely handicapped
 in the economic sphere by its extremely limit-
 ed research and development capability, by a
 severe shortage of scientific and technical
 manpower, and by the poor quality of train-
 ing.                                                            It plans, during the next 12 years, to
 increase the number of experienced technical
 and professional personnel from the current
 100,000 to about one million, particularly in
 such fields as engineering, agriculture, medi-
 cine, and education. These plans provide dur-
 ing 1958-1962 for the graduation of about
 40,000 annually in engineering and physical
 science, or numerically slightly more than
 those graduated in this field in the US in
 1955.  However, a large proportion of these
 graduates must be retained as teaching per-
 sonnel. We estimate that shortages of skilled
 personnel available to industry will become
 particularly acute during the Second Five
 Year Plan.
 Population.
 27. The population of Communist China was
 recorded at 583 million in the 1953 census and
 the regime officially estimated it at 603 mil-
 lion in 1955, showing an indicated rate of
 increase of 1.75 percent per annum. Commu-
 nist spokesmen have recently claimed a 2.2
 percent natural rate of increase during 1955-
 1956.  At that rate the population in 1962
 would total over 700 million.  Such a rate of
 growth would impose a considerable burden
 on the economy.  Within the past year the
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Communists have shown increasing concern
 about their population problem.  A directive
 promoting birth control has been issued and
 articles have appeared recommending later
 marriage.  It appears probable that the re-
 gime will step up its campaign to control the
 growth of population; however, the outcome
 of any such campaign is uncertain. The Com-
 munist planners have stated that six to seven
 million jobs in industry will be created during
 the Second Five Year Plan.  It follows that,
 if the ranks of the unemployed are not to be
 increased, the majority of the entrants into
 the labor force. over the next five years will
 have to be absorbed by the agricultural sector,
 which is characterized by slowly rising out-
 put, or in other nonindustrial pursuits where
 productivity is low.  In any event, the rising
 population is likely to operate as a brake on
 any projected rise in per.capita consumption.

 APPENDIX B
 THE CHINESE COMMUNIST MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT
 Ground Forces
 1. Total Chinese Communist ground forces
 are estimated at 2,500,000 men, of whom 1,-
 800,000 are organized in 36 armies and sup-
 porting units. This primary combat force in-
 cludes 114 infantry divisions, 3 armored divi-
 sions, 1 and possibly as many as 3 para-
 chute divisions,  3  cavalry divisions,  and
 22  artillery  divisions.  Most  armies have
 about 50,000 men and most infantry divi-
 sions have about 15,000 men.  (TOE strengths
 are about 60,000 and 19,000 respectively.)
 Infantry division organization includes an
 artillery regiment with 24 field pieces and
 12 heavy mortars, an AA battalion of 12
 light AA guns, and a tank regiment of 800
 men and 36 medium tanks.  At present only
 15 to 20 percent of the infantry divisions
 are believed to have tank regiments. An anti-
 tank battalion with 12 x 45/57mm AT guns
 has been reported as organic to 9 infantry
 divisions. An armored division includes about
 6,000 men, 80 medium tanks, 10 heavy tanks,
 and 8 self-propelled guns.  Parachute divi-
 sions are estimated at 7,000 men. The break-
 down of the 22 artillery divisions and their
 TOE equipment is as follows: 12 field artillery
 divisions, each armed with 108 pieces of cali-
 bers up to 152mm, 2 rocket launcher divi-
 sions armed with 72 x 132mm multiple rocket
 launchers each, 3 antitank divisions each
 armed with 72 antitank guns, and 5 anti-
 aircraft divisions armed with 108 light and
 medium guns each. Most ground force units
 are estimated to have about 85 percent
 of TOE.
 2. About 25 percent of the total strength of
 the ground forces is stationed in Manchuria
 and North Korea.  Another 25 percent is in
 the triangle bounded by Shanghai, Hankow,
 Canton, and the southeast coast, and about
 14 percent is retained in North China in the
 provinces of Shantung, Hopei and Shansi.
 Part of the remainder of the force is in posi-
 tions of coastal defense in the areas north of
 Shanghai and southwest of Canton, and the
 balance is disposed in central, western, and
 northwestern China as a general reserve and
 border security force.
 3. Morale in the ground forces is good, be-
 cause of preferential treatment afforded mem-
 bers of the armed services and because the
 Chinese Communist soldiers are developing
 a sense of pride in their army and their
 country.  A fixed annual training cycle is
 developing which begins with basic training
 for recruits in the spring and appears to
 progress to regimental and divisional size
 maneuvers by the following winter.. A service
 school system for officers and noncommis-
 sioned officers is also operative, and higher
 level staff colleges have been established.  To
 supplement indigenous training, numbers of
 both junior and senior officers are sent to
 appropriate level military schools in the Soviet
 Union.
 4. The Chinese Communist ground forces are
 making efforts to create a better balanced
 force through an increase in the proportion
 of support units to infantry units, and are
 considering a shift in tactical doctrine to
 meet problems posed by, nuclear warfare.
 A number of atomic warfare exercises have
 been held which have emphasized the employ-
 ment of individual protective measures similar
 to those of the Soviet Army and which prob-
 ably foreshadow some change in Chinese Com-
 munist ground combat tactical doctrines in-
 volving the abandonment of concentration
 and mass attack in favor of greater mobility
 and dispersion.
 5. The Military Service Law of 1955 requires
 a three year term of service in the ground
 force, and provides for a reserve made up, in
 part, of conscripts who have completed their
 three years' service.  This will add an esti-
 mated 800,000 men annually to the trained
 reserve, and will in any year after 1958 result
 in a reserve of up to 2,400,000 men who have
 undergone active military service within the
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 three previous years. The quality of person-
 nel available for service in both the active
 and reserve components has been improved
 by the institution of reserve training in high
 schools and universities.  Other preservice
 training is carried on in the National Defense
 Athletic Club and the New Democratic Youth
 League, which have extensive military sports
 training programs for civilians.
 6. The bulk of the heavy equipment for the.
 Chinese Communist ground force, especially
 armored vehicles, artillery, and complex elec-
 tronic equipment, is being supplied by the
 USSR.  The Chinese Communists produce
 most of their present requirements for small
 arms, mortars, recoilless rifles, rocket launch-
 ers, and ammunition for these weapons. The
 general increase in Chinese Communist in-
 dustrial production during 1956 has consid-
 erably increased the Chinese Communist ca-
 pacity to produce greater quantities of muni-
 tions, but the ground force will continue to
 depend upon the Soviet Union for most of its
 heavy equipment during the period of this
 estimate.
 Internal Security Forces
 7. The Ministry of Public Security and the
 Ministry of Defense share the responsibility
 for internal security. The Ministry of Public
 Security controls the People's Armed Police, a
 national police force of approximately 500,000
 which  supports  local  civil  governments
 throughout  China.   The  Public  Security
 Forces, which are still an integral part of
 the army and under the control of the Minis-
 try of Defense, are responsible for dealing
 with internal or border security problems that
 exceed the capabilities of the police. The
 Public  Security  Forces  have          an  over-all
 strength of about 200,000 organized into a
 minimum of 20 divisions and 13 independent
 regiments. These units are smaller and more
 lightly armed than comparable line units, but
 they nevertheless contain the service and fire
 support elements necessary for independent
 operations in the field.
 Air Forces
 8. Communist China's air arm is heavily de-
 pendent upon the USSR for planes, equip-
 ment, supplies, and training.  The Chinese
 Communist Air Force (CCAF) and the Chi-
 nese Communist Naval Air Force (CCNAF)
 together are estimated to have 87,000 per-
 sonnel and 2,600 aircraft of all types in oper-
 ational units, including 1,870 jets. They con-
 stitute a reasonably well developed air arm
 with modern aircraft, and concepts of em-
 ployment are improving. The personnel are
 young and vigorous, with excellent esprit
 de corps.  The forces are organized into bomb-
 er, fighter, attack, and transport units, and
 operate from a large complex of air bases
 which permits launching attacks from many
 points  on  Communist  China's  periphery.
 They also have a fairly well developed recon-
 naissance capability.
 9. The major strength of the Chinese Com-
 munist bomber force is estimated to consist of
 395 light ?jet bombers (BEAGLES). and 220
 piston light bombers (BATS). The BATS are
 being replaced by BEAGLES in a conversion
 program supported by the USSR.  The BEA-
 GLES, with 4,400-pound bomb loads, have a
 maximum speed of 450 knots and an unre-
 fueled combat radius/range of 745/1,400 nau-
 tical miles when operating at an altitude of
 35,000 feet.  Operational effectiveness of the
 bomber force is reduced by factors such as
 electronic equipment of limited capability,
 which under other than visual or ideal radar
 conditions affects bombing accuracy, and the
 lack of combat experience.
 10. The Chinese Communists are estimated
 to have in operational units 1,475 jet fighters,
 and about 180 piston fighters.  Most of the
 fighter strength is deployed near, industrial
 and population centers, with the Shanghai
 area most heavily defended. Replacement of
 piston fighters by jet fighters is progressing
 steadily, and piston fighters should be phased
 out completely by the end of 1957. Air inter-
 ception capability is hampered by a shortage
 of adequate GCI radars, a serious shortage of
 airborne intercept equipment, by inadequate
 pilot experience in night and all-weather fly-
 ing, and by only fair but improving standards
 in the ground control of interception proce-
 dures.  However, the CCAF-CCNAF would
 pose a substantial threat to bombers attack-
 ing under conditions of good visibility.  The
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 SECRET
 ability of the CCAF to support ground opera-
 tions is being enhanced through operational
 training.
 11. The bulk of the Chinese Communist air
 defense is concentrated in certain areas con-
 taining major military and industrial targets.
 They have a radar system which covers the
 entire coast and major industrial and popu-
 lation centers.  This provides fair to good
 capability to detect penetration of coastal
 and major target areas, except by aircraft at
 very high altitudes.  Although a central con-
 trol exists, the defense system is in essence
 an "island" system because of, the long dis-
 tances and the relatively poor communications
 facilities.
 12. The Soviet-supported modernization and
 training programs are progressively improv-
 ing Chinese Communist air power.  By mid-
 1959 piston light bombers will probably be
 completely replaced.  The piston medium
 bomber force will probably rise to 60 aircraft
 by 1960, at which time we believe that piston
 medium bombers will begin to be phased out
 as jet medium bombers phase in.  We esti-
 mate that by 1962 the total fighter strength
 will increase by about 22 percent and the
 proportion of all-weather fighters from less
 than two percent to about 30 percent.  As the
 all-weather jet fighter program expands and
 communications improve, the air-defense sys-
 tem will improve significantly.
 Naval Forces
 13. The Chinese Communist Navy has an esti-
 mated strength of 4 destroyers, 13 subma-
 rines, 229 patrol vessels (including 118 motor
 torpedo boats), 25 minesweepers, 64 amphibi-
 ous vessels  (including  10 utility landing
 craft), and 250-300 small patrol craft and
 armed motor junks. Most of the destroyers
 and submarines have been obtained from the
 USSR since 1953.  Most of the larger naval
 vessels operate from Hangchow Bay north-
 ward, the greatest concentrations of naval
 strength being based at. Shanghai and Tsing-
 tao.             Only small patrol vessels and harbor
 craft are operational in the area opposite Tai-
 wan.             The Naval Air Force has about 30 jet
 and 40 piston fighters and about 160 jet and
 60 piston light bombers concentrated in sev-
 eral areas of East and Northeast China. This
 small, recently organized force has shown
 steady growth and improvement.
 14 The navy, though small and principally a
 coastal defense force, is the most effective in-
 digenous Asian navy.  It can inflict losses on
 an enemy in Chinese Communist waters with
 submarine attacks, air attacks, mine warfare,
 and destroyer and torpedo-boat attacks.  The
 greatest offensive potential probably lies in
 short range amphibious operations (includ-
 ing the employment of joint sea-air-ground
 forces) utilizing not only conventional am-
 phibious types, but also merchant shipping,
 junks, and other small craft.  The navy's
 capabilities are limited by lack of major com-
 batant units plus the age and motley origins
 of their vessels. These conditions will prevail
 until overcome by the indigenous Soviet-
 assisted building program now in progress.
 15. The Chinese Communists have demon-
 strated a reasonable degree of proficiency in
 amphibious assaults against coastal islands.
 As a result of periodic exercises, they probably
 are continuing to improve their techniques.
 Through the maximum employment of avail-
 able conventional amphibious vessels and un-
 der favorable conditions they have the capaci-
 ty against the Offshore Islands for the follow-
 ing lift variations: (a) 40,000 to 70,000 lightly
 armed troops, (b) 20,000 to 25,000 troops
 supported by an armored division and an
 artillery division with reduced motor trans-
 port, or (c) two divisions each of armor and
 artillery, also with reduced motor transport.
 Eighty-nine available merchant vessels (ex-
 cluding 23 otherwise committed) with a ca-
 pacity of 260,000 DWT together with coastal
 craft plus motor and sailing junks provide
 an additional short-haul lift for 200,000 troops.
 Against Taiwan, however, it is estimated that
 various factors would limit their initial assault
 force to approximately 75,000 to  100,000
 troops.  Completion of the Amoy rail line, and
 the near future completion of the Foochow
 branch greatly enhance the logistic support
 capability in the Taiwan Strait area. Against
 the Nationalists alone the Chinese Commu-

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/05/10: CIA-RDP98-00979R000400490001-4
 nists have the capability to seize and main-
 tain control of the air and sea in the Taiwan
 Strait and can organize, launch, and support
 a large scale amphibious assault against
 Taiwan.
 16. The USSR is providing most of the mate-
 riel support for the navy, particularly ma-
 chinery, electronic gear, ordnance, and fuel.
 Under the supervision and direction of Soviet
 ship building experts, the Chinese Commu-
 nists have recently expanded their naval con-
 struction program to include submarine, large
 patrol vessels, minesweepers, and motor tor-
 pedo boats.  However, in spite of Chinese
 Communist industrial growth, the navy will
 continue to depend in large measure on the
 USSR for support through the period of this
 estimate.
 Nuclear Energy Program
 17. Communist China does not have a suffi-
 cient number of qualified nuclear scientists
 to support a significant atomic energy pro-
 gram.  Through the Soviet atomic aid pro-
 gram and the Joint Nuclear Research Insti-
 tute, Communist China is receiving help in
 the training of her scientists in basic nuclear
 physics and the application of atomic energy
 techniques to medical, agricultural, and in-
 dustrial research.  Even with this aid it is not
 likely that Communist China will be able, dur-
 ing the period of this estimate, to support an
 independent atomic energy program.  How-
 ever, if the USSR were to provide the necessary
 equipment and technicians, the Chinese Com-
 munists could in a short time achieve the ca-
 pability to use nuclear weapons.
