 THE COMMUNIST CAMP
 The vast assemblage of foreign Communist dignitaries in Moscow
 for the 50th Anniversary CqQ_ebration served to underscore its portray-
 al by the Soviets as a massive, unified Communist movement rallying
 to the support of the Soviet Union and the CPSU.   However, the absence
 of several luminaries of the Communist world, MAC) Tse-tung, Ho Chi Minh,
 and Fidel Castro, and of representatives of several Communist parties
 such as those of Holland and the non-bloc countries of the Far East
 except Australia, detracted from this impression of massive unity.
 The big question in the Communist movement, that of an inter-
 national Communist conference, was apparently still not definitively
 resolved during the Moscow celebrations, although several leaders
 did suggest publicly a meeting, or preparatory meeting, in 1968 and,
 according to one clandestine source, delegations from 17 or 18 parties
 will foregather in Budapest possibly late this year-or early next.
 The prospect of such.a meeting remains.a very corrosive issue in'the'      50X1-HUM
 Communist movement, for the reasons discussed in the enclosed note on
 Principal Developments in World Communist Affairs.

 Cubans Sponsor Cultural Congress.  The forthcoming Havana Cultural Con-
 gress, scheduled for 4-11 January 1968, is being touted by the Cuban
 Government as being as important as the TriContinental Conference of
 1966 and the LASO meeting held in summer 1967.  About 2000 invitations
 are said to have been issued to artists, writers and scientists from
 Asia, Africa and Latin America.  Well known leftists such as Alfara
 Siquieros, Jean Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and others are expected
 to attend.  It is doubtful that the Congress will live up to the grand-
 iose claims of the Cubans but it undoubtedly indicates the Cuban Govern-
 ment's intention to extend its subversive operations in the cultural
 field.  As we have little evidence to substantiate the inflated announce-
 ments from Havana we do not wish to give undue attention to the conference.
 Rather, the field should be alert to the potential for trouble-making
 within the Communist parties and fronts which this event may create.
 (Attached are a news article giving further details on the Congress
 .and excerpts from a statement issued by a preparatory seminar in Havana
 which concluded, among other things, that "The cultural event par
 excellence is revolution.")
 Recall of Peking's Ambassadors.  In December 1966 Peking had 47 diplo-
 matic establishments abroad of which 42 were embassies headed by full-
 fledged ambassadors.  Today, Peking has two embassies headed by ambas-
 sadors -- those in the UAR and Albania -- and at this writing the ambas-
 sador to Albania is not at his post.  In addition to the ambassadors,
 almost 1,000 other Chinese officials have been recalled for reasons
 never explained to the outside world.   Today at least 40 of Peking's
 embassies are headed by charges, first or second secretaries, or even
 lower ranking officers.  It appears the Cultural Revolution has claimed
 another victim.  Before MAO Tse-tung completely destroys what remains of
 his foreign service, perhaps he would do well to reflect on the value of
 an experiment which, in a single year, has made shambles of an entire
 diplomatic corps.

 New Communist Front Group in Africa and Asia.  Since early this year the
 Soviet Union and its Bloc allies have been quietly building up a corps
 of young people who are trained and dispatched abroad ostensibly "to aid"
 developing countries.  According to the attached news article, they are
 actually selected and trained by the KGB and Bloc intelligence services
 for espionage and, when they arrive at their posts abroad, their activi-
 ties are supervised by local Soviet and Bloc intelligence agents.  The
 youth corps, with headquarters in Budapest, has been named "The Inter-
 national Youth Service of Solidarity and Friendship."  Young people,
 male or female, go abroad as teachers, nurses, and as specialists in
 various fields -- mainly to Afro-Asian countries -- where they'are
 accepted as genuine volunteers.  According to a recent article in Prague's
 RUDE PRAVO, one thousand such "volunteers"-'have already been sent out
 and plans call for a total of 2,500 by the end of this year.
 Hanoi's Problems with Elongated Supply Lines.  North Vietnam's recruit
 ing in South Vietnam is down from some 7,000. new soldiers a month-to-
 around 3,500 today -- and still declining.  As a"result, Hanoi has been
 forced to send more PAVN (Peoples' Army of Vietnam) units south to fill
 out the ranks of what Hanoi persists in calling "an indigenous guerrilla
 force".  North Vietnamese soldiers now fighting in. the south total over
 100,000, more than half of the Communist fighting forces in Vietnam.
 Getting supplies to these men is becoming increasingly difficult for
 Hanoi because the Allies are gradually gaining control of the rice-growing
 regions in South Vietnam, and Allied bombing of supply routes from North
 to South Vietnam has seriously interfered with the southward movement of
 food, clothing and military supplies.  In fact, there seems little doubt
 that one of the major reasons for the Viet Cong proposal for three holiday
 truces (3 days each at Christmas and New Year and 7 days over the Vietna-
 mese New Year - Tet) is to give Hanoi a breather during which she can get
 more materiel into the supply channels for her soldiers fighting in
 South Vietnam.

 FOR BACKGROUND USE ONLY
 Principal Developments:' in World Communist Affairs
 (18 October to 16 November 1967)
 1.   The Soviets' celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Bolshe-
 vik Revolution was a milestone in the development of Communism in that
 country and a major event for the entire Communist camp.   Its effect
 on a prospective world Communist conference and on Soviet-Cuban relations
 are discussed in separate paragraphs below.   Other notable aspects of
 the Moscow celebrations include:
 a.   The clear ascendanc3 not Leonid Brezhnev over the other
 two members of the Brezhnev-Kosygin-Podgorny troika.  It was he who
 dedicated the new Lenin statue in the Kremlin, made the major
 addresses in Moscow 3_1 November and Leningrad on 5 November, and
 acted as principal host and speaker at the Kremlin reception..  He
 received deferential treatment in speeches by all the republic first
 secretaries -- some so extravagantly personally laudatory they were
 not carried subsequently in the central press.   Even Marshal
 Grechko. pointedly toasted "the Central Committee, CPSU, the.Polit-
 buro, and the General Secretary of the Central Committee Leonid
 Ilyich Brezhnev."  Minimal attention was given by. speakers to
 "collective leadership."  While Brezhnev pledged continuation and
 strengthening of this principle once briefly and in passing, no
 other speaker touched this point.
 b.  As was to be expected, the speakers conscientiously white-
 washed the Soviet past.  Brezhnev's keynote address dwelled almost
 exclusively on the positive achievements of the Soviet system.
 Lenin bulked large in his account but Stalin and Khrushchev remained
 =named; moreover, no reference is even made. to the "cult of the
 personality" or "subjectivism" -- the terms normally used to des-
 cribe their reigns.
 c.   The vast assemblage of foreign party dignitaries served to
 underscore the portrayal of the event by Moscow as a massive,
 unified display of the Communist movement rallying to the support
 of the USSR and the.CPSU.   Podgorny's speech at the opening of the
 3 November gathering greeted by name 74+ "Marxist-Leninist" delega-
 tions and 25 "progressive" groups, representing a total of 95
 countries.  PRAVDA and?IZVESTIYA carried articles by top party
 leaders from all the bloc countries represented at the celebration
 except Cuba and North Korea.
 d.   However there were absences and flaws which served to
 underscore certain gaps in this "massive unity."  Apart from China
 and Albania, whom.nobody.expected anyway, the Dutch Communist. Party
 was not represented nor were any non-bloc Communist Parties from
 the Far East except Australia's.  Japan was represented by the
 Socialist Party of Japan and not by the Japanese Communist Party.
 The North Korean delegation was led by the head of state, while
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2
 other bloc delegations except Cuba's, were led by their party
 leaders.   Cuba was represent~rd neither by its party leader nor
 government chief, but. by its ? Minister of. Health.
 e.  Even some of those who did attend did so with misgivings.
 Yugoslavia, for'example, was wary of possible efforts to take advant-
 age of the presence of these Communist.-leaders by the Soviets to
 convene some sort of rump conference of Communist and workers'
 parties.   Several articles in the Yugoslav press also disparaged
 Moscow's efforts to press its position as "first among eciual$"'and
 even hinted that perhaps the Soviets might learn a bit from the
 Yugoslav example.  President Tito was reportedly irritated with
 the Soviets for censoring an article he wrote before it was re-
 printed by PRAVDA, which deleted -- among other things -- critical
 references by Tito to the Comintern's policy toward Yugoslavia in
 the Stalinist period.
 f.  A one-sentence greeting from the Chinese National People's
 Congress and the CPR State Council to the Supreme Soviet and the
 Soviet Council of Ministers pointedly igno:+d the CP
 SU and thus,
 by implication, demonstrated that the Chinese do not acknowledge a
 party-level relationship with the Soviets.  The Chinese greeting
 was not included in a collection of messages printed by PRAVDA on
 7 and 8 November.  Conjointly the Chinese mounted an intensified
 propaganda campaign to denigrate the Soviet regime at the time of
 its jubilee celebrations.  The campaign had two basic dimensions:
 to indict the Soviet leadership -- supported by a flood of attacks
 constituting a bill of particulars against the regime's policies
 -- for having betrayed the revolution and restored capitalism,
 and to claim that Mao Tse-tung is the supreme Marxist~Leninist
 mentor of the present era and Peking the capital of world revolu-
 tion.
 2.   Soviet-Cuban relations took a turn for the worse as a result
 of the Moscow anniversary celebrations.  Although the leaders of other
 .ruling Communist parties (excepting North Korea, China, North Vietnam, and
 Albania) represented their countries in Moscow, Castro stayed in Havana,
 sending the Minister of Health, Jose R. Machado, instead.  :Additionally,
 Castro failed to send an article in praise of the Soviet Union to be
 published in_-,PRAVDA along with those of everyone else except China and
 Albania; the Cuban Ambassador in Moscow failed to attend the 6 November
 reception for''chiefs of diplomatic missions given by Soviet President
 Podgorny;   and Machado failed to make a congratuihtory address at the
 Kremlin celebration (it's not clear whether he refused to, or wasn't
 asked to).   The world's press buzzed with rumors of s.Soviet-Cuban
 "split" as a result of these snubs, and almost universally failed to
 note that Castro, Dorticos and the entire leadership of Cuba turned up
 at th'e.Soviet Embassy's reception on 6 November and enjoyed themselves
 immensely.   The press also paid little attention to the speech-by the
 Soviet charg6e d':affaires- in Havana who pledged his country's continued

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2
 economic and military support to Cuba.   Undoubtedly Castro's calculated
 snubs did irritate the Kremlin, but it is doubtful they will pack up
 and leave that tropical isle.just because Fidel didn't come to their
 party.
 3.   The question of. an eventual world Communist conference was ver1
 much in the air in Moscow.   Several luminaries, such as Czechoslovakia's
 Novotny and East Germany's Ulbricht,openly called fora meetin( in 1968.
 Agence France Presse on 8 November quoted "foreign .ommunist sources"
 in Moscow to the effect that there-is a growing. likelihood df an inter-
 national Communist conference being held in Budapest in the first quarter
 of 1968, but cites "doubt"''among these same sources as to whether this
 will be "the big conference" or merely a preparatory one.  The sources
 are quoted as saying that a poll of world parties revealed "a majority
 of 70" in favor of a conference .- the figure used by V. Polyanskiy in.
 a talk broadcast by Radio Moscow .on 21 October.   The Soviets' position
 in requesting a conference was-strengthened.by an article by Italian ,
 Communist Party Secretary General Luigi Longo on 27 October in which 1e
 said that the rejection by the Chinese Communists of Soviet proposals for
 joint aid to Vietnam has led the Italian Party to abandon its past
 reserve on the need for a new international Communist conference "to
 increase unity."
 As viewed by a Communist, the proposal is loaded with problems
 such as:  In Europe such a conference would revive the danger of the
 Red peril, evoking the ghosts of the Comintern and the Cominform, pro-
 viding material for all the anti-Communists and disrupting the advances
 already made toward unity with the Social Democrats in many countries.
 In many countries of Africa and the Middle East the Communist parties
 are insignificant and the leading revolutionary parties are not Commu-
 nist; thus the conference would not even be representative of the
 revolutionary movement in those areas.  In certain areas in Latin America
 the revolutionary movement is div'ded between two or more contenders;
 choosing only the Communist Party could thus overlook a major part of
 the revolutionary forces.  .In the Far East the problem of Vietnam would
 provoke a major crisis by forcing the North Vietnamese to choose, against
 their will, between Moscow and Peking -- a choice. which might be fatal
 either way.   Furthermore., pre-empting the pro-North Vietnam position
 would risk alienating many other supporters of-that country who. have no
 desire only to follow a Communist lead..  Finally, although some parties
 seem to believe the conference could be held without discussing the role
 .of Communist China in the international Communist movement., this seems
 absurdly unlikely; on the other hand discussing Communist China would
 irremediably solidify the. schism in the.Communist world.

 Of Our Latin Ameripa Staff
 The Cuban  government,
 obsessed with what it calls
 the U.S. "penetration in the+
 field  of  Latin American {
 culture," is preparing to do
 something about it.
 The Castro regime has
 announced it will sponsor,
 an  international cultural
 congress 'in Havana Jan. 4
 11 with the purpose, among,
 other things, of blocking an
 alleged "Imperialist cultural
 offensive. "
 The  congress,  according
 to t he  government - con-
 trolled . press,  will  bring'
 together an estimated 500
 ?1 e f t-of-center "scientists,
 technicians and artistic and
 literary creators" from
 Asia,  Africa and Latin'
 America.
 Cuba says It has Invited
 both "socialist" and "capi-
 talist" Intellectuals, fore-'
 most among them British
 philosopher
 sell. Those onr the caps-
 talist world are described
 as   "progressive   intellec-
 tunas,"  a Communist syno-
 nym for the far left.
 j  "Together, these men will
 discuss the role of the in-
 tellectual                  in      the   insurrec-
 tional struggle, which is to

 (Excerpts from statement issued by a seminar organized by the Cuban
 Prepatory Committee for the Havana Cultural Congress as reported by
 PRENSA LATINA, 3 November 1967)
 The cultural event par excellence is revolution.   Only revolution
 makes it possible for underdeveloped countries to conceive of a truly
 national culture, a cultural policy returr{ing to the people their real
 identity and a chance to advance sciepce and enjoy art ....
 The right to insubordination should not then be preached,but prac-
 ticed.   Only through concrete action does the intellectual become so-
 ciety's conscience, an expression of its critical thought, a forecast
 of what will one day be reality, and in this sense a factor in creating
 and developing the subjective conditions necessary for the liberating
 rebellion.   No example is better than the one given by Che to bear out
 this fact ....
 Mass communications media serve to distort development in colo-
 nized countries and promote development in countries engaged in revo-
 lution.  In the first case, they are a tool of the broadest and most
 persistent penetration by the interest of the tutor state .... Skill=
 fully handled by imperialism and the national bourgeoisie, they are
 inimical to the essential function of current history:  wars of lib-
 eration ....
 Even in this situation, occasions and differences must be seized
 on so that mass media can contribute to the task of decolonization and
 liberation of our peoples.   Clandestine publications and movies and
 radio broadcasts, for instance, have a vital function to perform in
 the processes of national liberation:  that of political orientation....
 This is the historical and social context surrounding the task
 of forming new intellectual cadres that retain those traditions,
 create new ones, and forge a communist consciousness.   To undertake
 national liberation is to rend imperialism, and this involves first
 of all preparing all the people for the most violent manifestation
 of culture:   the popular war in defense of their freedoms ....

 Mr. Sato appeared on the scene

 This means two battalion .groups now will
 { be in the line while one is resting. Prime
 Minister allrold E. Holt, announcing his gov-
 ?,ernment's decision, said that in Vietnam
 "thv'tide of Communist expansion is being
 checked and turned."
 In short there is no stalemate, in his. opin.
 .ion. Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor stressed the
 same point during his July talks here with
 ,,the Australian Government.
 Thereds no doubt that the latest Australian,
 troop increase is due to the Taylor mission.
 ? While the question of any troop increase was
 publicly played down at that time, Mr. Holt
 described General Taylor's briefing as "very
 informative."                    .
 .,increase its Vietnam task force from 8,30
 to more than 8,000 men will double its actual
 As Mr. Holt's latest statement to Austra-
 lia's House of Representatives shows, this
 information made clear that "military pres-
 sures must ble sustained and indeed in-
 creased" in Vietnam.
 Negotiations sought     ?
 This. build-up was necessary, as Mr. Holt
 put it, "if we are to secure even more
 .decisive results in the field-results which
 might lead North Vietnam to negotiations.".
 This view also explains. the Australian
 Government's continuing strong support for
 the United States bombing policy. And as
 Australian  Treasurer William  McMahon
 recently put it to Americans, "Where you,
 go, we will go."
 In the Vietnam air war, this is literally.
 true.Jrt_the late.S.t,&,4'tr.4liantropp increase,
 I Autralian Air,Force pilots are `being made?
 available for... service with " United States .
 attack squadrons.            ? .        y '
 But as Australian External- Affairs Min-.
 fort Australia could make in Vietnam it
 would be necessary to take into account
 `any. provision Australia would need to make
 in Malaysia and elsewhere in Southeast,
 Asia.
 Since no new forces have been committed
 elsewhere, the Holt government appears to
 be relying on increasing the national draft
 if more forces are needed outside Vietnam.
 In Australia's present "forward defense".
 planning, the aim is to build up troop
 'strength until a full division can be deployed
 overseas at any time. But just how the
 ',present limited draft policy would be shaped
 ,to this end remains to be seen.
 Draft expansion issue?
 In his latest troop increase, Mr. Holt has
 set the stage politically for a new draft ex.
 pansion. Next anonth the Australian Govern.
 anent will face the Senate elections. And its
 new Vietnam troop increase has ensured
 these will develop into "khaki campaign."
 Vietnam will be the central issue. And-a:
 government victory could be interpreted
 fairly by Mr. Holt as public support for any
 'required draft expansion.
 Most Australians realize that their coup
 ,try's stand in Vietnam is as much for them
 as it is for the South Vietnamese people. The
 stress which the Australian Government
 places in this context on the aggressiveness
 of.-Communist China means that in Austra-
 lian official eyes the Vietnam war is a delay-
 ing action.
 Accordingly,  any . acceptable  solutions
 which the Chinese people themselves may
 produce in the face of the problems imposed
 on them by the Peking Communist regime
 will be of great importance to Australia.
 Equally important is the increase in power
 and strength.of the free peoples of Southeast
 Asia.

 In a surprise mass exodus hundreds of Tibetans
 have crossed into India to escape a local Red Guard
 movement which is " attempting to purify Tibet with
 Mao's thoughts " in form of religious persecutions.
 Nearly 500 refugees have already' escaped across'
 the mountains and report that thousands more will.;
 cross if they can evade Chinese border patrols in
 western Tibet. With them conks the first glimpse of'
 the cultural revolution in the most effectively sealed,

 500 FIND SHELTER..IN
 INDIAN CAMPS
 From PETER IlAZELHURST--Bijnar Aug. 27
 In Tibet the cultural revolution
 has  been  particularly directed
 against lamas, religion and old
 traditions which appear to be a
 symbolic substitute for revision-
 ists,                        Liu . Shao-chi  and. anti-',
 'Maoists in the struggle in China`
 .proper.
 In       the  Indian  Government
 refugee camps at Ilijnor and Pilib-
 !hit                        it re  500  Tibetans, who,
 ,crossed  the  snowbound bor-i
 der      passes   after  the  thaw'
 in June.        They describe the Red
 Guard reign of terror, humilia-
 tion of lamas and a fanatical cam-
 paign to wipe out the last traces of
 religion in the country.
 A strict ban has been placed
 on worship, any form of owner-
 ship, and contact with traditions.
 The cultural revolution and Red
 Guards made themselves felt in
 western Tibet only in February
 this year. With the formation of
 lied  Guards struggle  meetings
 have  hccn  called  in villages.
 monasteries razed to the ground
 and ancient Lamai%t scriptures
 burnt. The Red Guards, recruited
 from the poorest sections of the
 community by the Chinese and
 'Tibetan officials, forced villagers
 to shave the traditionally Jong-
 plaited hair, wear Chinese clothes,
 and emitlate chairman Mao.
 But Peking appears to have
 underestimated the strong rcligi.
 OUS  tics that still exist in Tibet
 after 14 years of Chinese rule.
 Under the forceful direction of
 Tibetan Red Guards-the Gening
 Rrrknch-villagers submitted, de-
 stroyed their monasteries, accepted
 Mao's little red book, and then,
 overnight,  slipped  away  under
 Peking s nose.
 Waiting for the snows to thaw,
 they_ crossed into India in -their_
 hundreds    bringing with themlamas, hidden scriptures, sacred
 objects, and cattle.
 Relative peace
 This largest exodus out of Tibet
 since  1962  indicates  that the
 western  borders arc not well
 patrolled by the Chinese, contrary
 to what had been believed.     o
 spontaneous antagonism developed
 by the cultural revolution can be
 ,seen in the numbers attempting to
 cross the border, when it is realized
 ,that only 35 Tibetans had previ-
 ously defected in this area since
 11962.
 Contrary to past reports, the
 !western Tibetans say that until
 February this year they have been.
 left in relative peace. One of the
 leaders  of  the mass  exodus, ;
 ;Chhamba Dhawa, unaware that he.
 had been experiencing the cultural'
 revolution, said until February' the
 Chinese had not intcrtcred with
 worship or rites. " When they first
 came they said they were going to
 change the country into a place
 ;like Russia. We would be able to
 ilvorship but there would be demo-
 cratic changes.
 "Nothing . happened   until'
 February this year. when we saw
 the Chinese forming groups of
 people from the poorest acctions.'
 of the community in all the
 Villages. At the head of the group
 the  Chinese  placed  Tibetan
 people who worked .in their offices.
 They all wore red arm bands.
 " At the end of the month they
 called all heads of families to the
 district headquarters and said that
 the old ways were not the thoughts
 of chairman Mao. We were told
 that the Dalai Lama was reaction-
 ary and that old things must be
 destroyed. Chinese officers were at
 these meetings but (hey did not
 take part. We were told that we
 had not understood the thoughts
 of chairman Mao and the only
 true followers were the poorer
 people who had formed the new
 group called Genlog Rukach.
 " We were told things were now'
 going to change. All worship must
 stop and monasteries and scrip-
 tures were to be burnt. Men were
 told to dress like Mao Tse-tung
 and shave their long hair.
 " To be pure according to chair-
 man Mao's thoughts, one should
 not possess anything and even
 those who owned two head of
 cattle were capitalists ".

 noticed a change in the Tibetan:

 A 70-year-old monk, Niyang

 worship and have our monasteries.

 dreds of Tibetans still escape
 to l:idia and Nepal     every

 Mr.  Thondup hailed  the
 three  separate resolutions
 adopted by the U.N. General
 Assembly to date (1959, 1961,
 19651 calling for. independence
 in Tibet, He regretted that
 "neither the call of the Uni-
 ted Nations nor the tears of
 the Tibetan people could de-
 ter the Chinese   from their
 aggressive and , expansionist
 designs," He said that China's
 main interet in Tibet is its
 "militarily stratkgic location."
 In his summary of current
 Communist Chinese actions in
 Tibet, Mr, Thondup noted that
 the  Cultural Revolution  h ;s
 spread well Into his country.
 He said that Red   Guards,
 mostly  teenagers, have fan-
 nrd out across Tibet destroy-
 ing religious works of art and
 objects and carrying on acts
 ,of vandalism in monasteries,
 homes and historic places.
 Public trials
 "The Red  Guards  have
 punished every Tibetan who
 showed the slightest indica-
 tion of adhering to the Tibe-
 tan religion a:;d customs," he
 said.
 He said man? Tibetans have
 been accused as class enemies
 and brought to public trials
 "and beaten severely for the
 crimes trumped   up against
 them by the Red Guards,"
 He said that two  Chinese
 Conlmun;.st factions-the Cul.
 tural Revolutionary  Rebe s
 and the Great Alliance-one
 to support and one against the
 charges and  counter-charges
 against one         another, It is
 ,believed there   Was conflict
 among the rank and file of
 the military      itself both in
 China and Tibet," he said.
 By September   1967, Mr
 Thondup maintained:     "the
 situation in Tibet had deterlo-
 .rated into continuous                                                                                                          open
 violence consisting of bloody
 beatings and killings, between
 the two rival groups."
 He also called attention to
 the deteriorating living and
 political conditions of , the
 Tibetan people. "They cannot
 enjoy the   fruits of their
 labour. Their daily consumption
 Is strictly rntloned," A major
 share of the food production
 within Tibet is   shipped ,to

 He cite deplored the fact
 that Tibetan children are bit.

 irrted entirely from their par-

 27 September 1967
 Dalai Lama Comes to Japan
 The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan leader since 1959 in exile
 In India, arrived in Tokyo on Monday night for a two=week
 visit to Japan.
 Sometimes referred to as the "god-king," the Dalai Lama
 Is regarded by most Tibetans as their lawful ruler; be is,
 also the head of the Lamaist form of the Buddhist religion
 which Is found mainly in Tibet. He was invited to Japan
 by the Buddhist Missionary Association In Tokyo, and the
 Japanese Government agreed to his visit here en condition
 that he did not engage in any political activities while in
 Japan.
 The Dalai Lama has, of course, no religious jurisdiction;
 over Japanese Buddhists, and the form of Buddhism 'he',
 professes is considerably different from those forms current,
 In Japan.  Nevertheless, he is honored as a devout and,
 courageous Buddhist and also as the representative of a.
 country which has suffered a cruel fate at the hands of
 Chinese Communists.
 So severe has been, and still is, this persecution that. Red
 China has been' freely accused in various quarters o' the;
 crime of genocide.
 This visit to Japan is the Dalai Lama's first visit abroad
 since he fled from his homeland eight years ago, and he is
 expected on his return journey to India to stop for a few
 (lays in Bangkok, another Buddhist center-this time of -
 the Hinayana faith. While his trip is not intended to have
 any political significance, as he was once endowed with'
 sovereign powers and has suffered much anguish on behalf,
 of his unfortunate country, his visit is bound to excite'
 interest and sympathy.
 The severity of the Peking Government's treatment of
 the Tibetan people appears to have been mainly promoted;
 by the ordinary Communist zest for destruction, but, the.
 fact that their land was largely undeveloped, yet contained
 underground mineral wealth, was undoubtedly a factor.:
 Recent reports indicate, too, that despite the harshness of
 the climate and the high elevation of much of the country,
 the Chinese Communists have been pouring in colonists of
 their own race to take the place of the native Tibetans..
 This process is said to have had a good deal of success
 although the Chinese do not take readily to the climatic
 conditions of Tibet.
 One political consequence of the flight of the Dalal Lama
 and the sinicization of Tibet has been increased friction
 between India and Red China.
 Last March, the Foreign Ministry in Peking formally
 accused the Indian Government of permitting the Dalai
 Lama to set up a government-in-exile in India. The Peking
 note described the Tibetan leader as a "traitor." It declared
 that India had given shelter to "elements of the traitorous
 Dalai clique and a large number of traitor bandits, and
 openly helped them to establish in India a so-called govern-
 ment-in-exile and to publish a so-called Tibetan Constitu-
 It even accused India of giving Tibetan refugees "mill-
 tary training" while referring to'the "new Tibet" as becom-
 ing a "joyful land of socialism."
 India, of course, has consistently pointed out that it
 does not permit Tibetans In India (including the Dalai Lama
 himself) to participate in anti-Chinese activities.  The
 Indian motive obviously has been humanitarian in character.
 Tibetans, persecuted in their homeland by the Chinese
 Communists, and fortunate enough to get away, have per-
 forcq. had to find new homes, and India, the nearest free
 country, could have hardly refused them a refuge.   Some
 Tibetans have, of course, proved able to escape to Europe,
 and a number have found refuge in Switzerland in, areas
 which are somewhat reminiscent of their own mountain
 land.
 Not only have the Tibetan people received cruel treat-
 ment but it appears that many monasteries have been ruth.
 lessly plundered and their cultural treasures dissipated.
 The actual rulers in Tibet appear to be the Chinese
 military' who take scant care respecting anybody's rights
 and act in an arbitrary fashion. Earlier this year, the Tibet
 Garrison of the "People's Liberation Army" issued a direc-
 tive saying that anyone opposing the Army takeover would
 be regarded as a "counter-revolutionary and dealt with
 accordingly."
 Red Chinese, actions in Tibet reveal, if nothing else does,
 the true nature of a type of communism which will stop at
 nothing to gain its ignoble ends.  Its pretence to be con-
 cerned with the welfare 'of the masses is only valid within
 its own narrow Ideology, and even excites criticism from
 nations that have accepted the main principles of socialism.

 The Problem of Tibet
 The currant visit to Japan of His Holiness the-Dalat:
 Lama has spotlighted one of the most vexing legal and-.
 moral problems in today's troubled world. Whether Com-
 munist China. has the right to occupy Tibet and rule the'
 three million Tibetans Is one aspect of the problem. And
 whether it is right for the Chinese Communists to destroy,
 Tibetan. culture and erase the identity of the Tibetan
 people Is another.
 The Tibetans became Identified as a nation in the seventh c
 century when a number of ferocious Himalayan tribes
 united under the leadership of a strong chieftain.  The1
 united tribes defeated China and imposed humiliating
 terms, but in the process acquired Buddhism, which, while:
 keeping the tribes united, pacified them.
 Eventually, the Buddhism became Lamaism, and Tibet'
 became a theocratic state.  The Grand Lama-or Dalai
 Lama, as he finally was called-headed ? the nation and,
 maintained a "spiritual temporal" relation with China.,
 After some centuries, the Chinese came to look upon Tibet;
 as a vassal state which they had generously permitted,
 self-government.
 Early In this century, the British were the dominating'
 Influence in that part of the world. The Tibetans, exasper-
 ated at the Chinese attitude, had succeeded in ejecting
 even the pretence -of 'any Chinese authority over their
 affairs.
 In niid-1914, a meeting between Tibet, China and Britain
 was held in Simla, India, for the purpose of establishing
 Tibet's borders. The border between India and Tibet was
 easily agreed upon, but the Chinese would not accept the
 Article II of the Convention described Tibet as being
 "under the suzerainty, of China."  This recognized a tradij
 son rather than any legal or de facto relationship. More-
 over', "suzerainty" was not to he confused with' "saver..
 ,rignty."  It meant, in effect, that China was to remain
 Tibet's protector and as such was permitted a strong`
 voice in Tibet's foreign relations.  It did not mean that.'
 China had any voice whatever in Tibet's internal affairs.
 In addition, the same Article II of the Convention speet
 ;led that, the Chinese were "not to convert Tibet into a,

 Peking Radio assails
 Dalai Lama
 NT 7W DELHI. October 13: The
 Dalai Lama was today again the
 target of the fury of Peking Radio
 which reported his  derarture fat
 India on Tuesday after a two-week
 visit to Japan.
 1 ho Tibetan  spiritual head was
 called by the radio the "Tibetan
 bandit leader" who  took part in
 "treacherous activities" In Japan in
 collusion with the 'reactionary Sato
 Government:
 The radio said: "The reactionary
 Sato Ciovcrtiment's action to allow
 "Chinese province"
 Finally, the Tibetan' declared that, ,if the Chinese did
 .rot ratify the Convention, Tibet's status reverted back to
 .that of "an independent nation recognizing no allegiance
 to..China."
 i- ? In October 1950, In a sneak attack, 40,000 Chinese Com=
 munist troops crossed Tibet's eastern borders and engaged
 .the tiny Tibetan army. The Tibetans fought bravely, but
 were overwhelmed.
 The Chinese rationalized the aggression on the basis
 that, because the British had participated in the Simla
 Convention, it was automatically imperialistic and there-
 fore ?to be rejected.  Moreover, even the imperialistic"
 British had recognized China's suzerainty over Tibet,
 and this was now conveniently interpreted as "sover-
 eignty."
 Since ?then, whenever the Tibetan issue has risen in
 world affairs, the Communists) indulge in legalistic hair-
 splitting over "suzerainty", and "sovereignty," and they
 reinvoke the immorality of. British imperialism until the
 issue is drowned in a verbal deluge.
 Meanwhile, the best land of the three million Tibetans'
 has been confiscated and given to Chinese settlers.  Their
 religious practices are suppressed, and their religious
 establishments are being methodically destroyed.     Their.
 art, literature, folkways, traditions and even their language
 are being obliterated.  Forced labor is the fate of tens of
 thousands of Tibetans. Public torture Is a common method
 of enforcing Peking's authority.
 Since 1959, more. than 90,000 Tibetans have been killed
 in the Chinese attempts to put down Tibetan resistance
 and uprisings.  Many more than this number have died of
 starvation. No matter how the word "'genocide" is defined,
 the evidence is overwhelming that the Chinese Communists
 are guilty of it.
 In early 1959, the present Dalai Lama escaped from
 Lhassa to India. He made the dangerous journey in order
 to tell the world what was happening in his country and
 to seek help. for his peopId.  Severel thousands of his
 subjects have managed, to evade Chinese patrols and ;coined

 It took objection to the publica.
 tion of a pamphlet by "Yomiurl
 Shimbun" carrying a letter from the
 Dalai Lama to organisers of the
 Tibetan exhibition  there naming
 Tibet "at par with India and Japan
 as three countries."
 The radio commented that the
 publication of this statement by the
 Dalai Lama Is "obviously a hero.,
 ous crime of the Sato Government
 which follows U.S. Imperfalism."--

 out  th:,t  on  September 26  Dalai
 presided over the opening ceremony
 of a so-called "Tibetan Trea"ures Ex-
 hibition"                                                              in  Tokyo  sponsored by
 Yomiuri Shimbun. On the map hung
 in the exhibition hall and in the
 pamphlets sold there, Tibet was de-
 lineated as a separate "country," and
 "Tibetan masses" and the nationals
 of Japan and India were lumped
 together as "civilians of the three
 countries."  This was a vain and
 crude  attempt  at  interfering  in
 China's internal affairs and splitting
 China's sacred territory, as well as
 an open political provocation against
 China. Besides NIatsutaro Shoriki,
 director of Yoiniuri Shimbun, offi-
 cials of the U.S. Embassy in Japan
 and the Japanese Foreign Ministry
 and the Indian Charge d'Affaires in
 Japan also took part in this sinister
 activity.
 "Yomiuri Shimbun" Correspond-
 ent in Peking Disqualified
 The representative of  the Liao
 Cheng-chih Office of China called in
 the representative of the Tatsunosuke
 Takasaki Office of Japan in Peking
 on   October  12.  He  severely  de-
 nounced the responsible members of
 the  Japanese  newspaper     Yomiuri
 Shimbun for following the orders of
 the  U.S.-Japanese  reactionaries in
 the anti-China campaign and making
 arrangements,  together  with    the
 Japanese Association for Preaching
 Buddhism, for China's arch Tibetan
 traitor Dalai to travel from India to
 Japan on September 25 to carry out
 criminal  anti-China  activities. He
 informed the Japanese representative
 that he was authorized to announce
 the  cancellation of the  right  of
 Yomiuri Shimbun, as of that day, to
 accredit a correspondent to Peking.
 It is reported that after his stay
 in Tokyo Dalai also went to Kyoto
 and other places for sinister activities.

 The Chinese representative pointed
 out that it was an undeniable fact
 that  the  responsible  members of
 Yontittri  Shirnbun  had  arranged
 Dalai's trip to Japan for anti-China
 activities. It was new evidence that
 the  reactionary Japanese  Govern-
 nnent'was following U.S. imperialism
 and collaborating with the Indian
 reactionaries in pressing ahead with
 its anti-China policy.  It was also a
 big exposure of the ugly features of
 the responsible members of Yomiuri
 Sliintbun as pawns of the reactionary
 Sato government in opposing China.
 The  representative  pointed  out
 that the vicious political aim of these.
 manoeuvres was particularly evident
 since they occurred at a time when
 Sato. had just concluded his "visit"
 to Taiwan and was on his anti-China
 mission  to some  Southeast Asian
 countries and regions, and when the
 General  Assembly  of  the  United
 Nations, a tool of the United States,
 was in session.  The Chinese people
 would never tolerate this.

 DIE PRESSE, Vienna
 24 October 1967
 The Chess Player Was A Soviet Agent
 Background of the Anasov Case -- Diplomat found his victim in a
 Coffee House.
 Vienna.  The case of the accredited Soviet Attache in Vienna, M.A.S.
 Anasov, has created a sensation with the Austrian public.  As reported, the
 diplomat, a member of the Soviet civilian intelligence service, attempted
 to bribe a Vienna municipal official and was caught in the act.  How Anasov
 proceeded to reach his objective has now become known in detail.
 The attache approached the municipal official at a chess club, located
 in'a coffee house in the Seventh District.  The municipal official is a mem-
 ber of this chess board -- a coincidence which the diplomat had cleverly
 controlled.  In order to_ secure the good will of the official, he [the dip-
 lomat] surprised him first with small gifts; sometimes the gifts were
 theater tickets and at other times books.  That was last year.  In the spring
 of 1967, Anasov let his real intentions show through for the first time.
 He first carefully questioned the official, who worked in Municipal Depart-
 ment 61 for Citizenship Matters, about his type of work and one day he
 openly stated what he wanted.
 There are two versions about this: Vienna City Hall officials surmise
 that the content of specific citizenship records:  other sources believe
 that he intended to get his victim to make false file cards and to smuggle.
 them into the records.  This would have made it possible for the Soviet
 Intelligence Service to supply an agent with Au,trian documents.  The agent
 would not have to had to do anything buc apply for a proof of citizenship
 record, which would have most probably been issued to him on the basis of
 the false material inserted in the files.
 There are also two interpretations about what happened after Anasov
 made his proposal to the municipal official.  While it is explained in the
 City Council that the offic.ia1 became suspicious when this chess partner
 suddenly went beyond his cus6omary attentiveness and attempted to press
 money on him -- a fact the official immediately reported to his superiors --
 other sourceb claim the official took the money.                  A total of about 4,000
 shillings was reportedly involved.  The official is said to have last his
 nerve at the last moment and reported the matter.   He informed the City
 Council, which reported the matter to the state police.

 The Home Ministry     security

 conclusion that   in some cases
 too much money  appeared to
 have been spent, which  could
 not possibly have come  from
 the candidate     himself or his
 political party.
 But what their Investigations
 also unearthed    was   that the

 Referring to  the attitude of
 the KGB to Kerala, the Home

 the conclusion  that at election

 goodwill by supporting some of
 the Left  Congress  candidates
 who were described in this con-
 fidential report as "EMS's fav-
 ourites".
 YOUNG        INDIA  comments
 that "most curious is the KGB's

 Sangh candidates."  How Soviet
 IIntelligence  felt It advantagc-
 tous to assist so communalist a
 party as the Jan Sangh is a mat-

 would indicate that the KGB's

 (By a "Daily News" r.j orter)
 -Sunil Hewage, one of the three 'wanted men'
 the February Plot investigation, has  deep
 and devious connections with  the    Communist
 Party (Moscow), the 'Daily News'  reliably un-
 terstands.
 'Mr. Hewage is said to have been  mentioned
 1`b y suspects who are now under detention in the
 February t Plot investigation.
 ;'Among the allegations made  against  him, reliable
 sources said, is that he had been responsible for  pre-
 paring identity discs  to  be worn by  the      conspirators
 on their  operational day, and provided    the    cons-
 ipirators with foreign know-how. He has not                 yet     been
 traced by the police however.
 In February 1962, Mr. Hewage was elected Vice-Presl-
 ;dent of the All-Ceylon Federation of Communist        Pro-
 gressive Youth Leagues, a Communist Party             (Moscow)
 front organisation.
 In the same year, he helped
 to found the Comrnittee for
 Solidarity with Cuba, and is
 said to have teen associated
 with the pu;bl:c: tion. of pam-
 phlets by this Curnrn,tee.
 Later in 1562, Oc-

 He 1i believed `to have edited
 the Sinhala   publication  of
 "Soviet   Land'    throughout
 that year.
 In   December 1964,  Mr.
 Bewage was elected     Deputy
 Secretary  of the   Executive
 Committee, Ceylon    National
 Federation of Communist and
 Progressive Youth'   Leagues.
 Last year, 'reliable political

 Che Guevara Proves Latin America Rejects Castroism
 Guerrillas in Bolivia
 On 9 October 1967 Ernesto Che Guevara, guerrilla leader and chief
 proponent of Fidel Castro's doctrine of armed revolution, was ignomini-
 ously shot to death by Bolivian army forces in the mountainous area of
 southeastern Bolivia.   His death may mark a turning point in the tide of
 Castro's insurgency program in Latin America, for it seems to demonstrate
 that imported revolution in Latin America lacks essential popular sup-
 port.   Guevara's lack of local support in Bolivia contrasts sharply with
 Castro's situation in Cuba during his Sierra Maestra campaign, when he
 received help from both the middle class and the wealthy landowners --
 in the form of arms, food, transportation, safehavens, and, above all,
 vital intelligence on the movements and condition of Batista's army.
 Guevara had none of this kind of assistance -- the upper classes wanted
 no part of him and the peasants were at best apathetic and, in many
 cases, reported his movements to the army.   In fact, Guevara and his
 band existed in almost total isolation from the few scattered peasants
 who were his neighbors in the rugged, mountainous terrain he chose as
 his base of operations.   These illiterate rural people had little in
 common -- either intellectually or emotionally -- with the band of adven-
 turers from the outside, and little feeling for the cause they repre-
 sented.   They were, as Guevara stated in his diary, "as impenetrable as
 stone."  Other significant factors contributing to Guevara's downfall
 were the swift improvement of the Bolivian counter-guerrilla forces
 and the.guerrilla band's remote location from their Cuban base of sup-
 plies.  After Guevara's death, Government units soon mopped up the
 remainder of the poorly equipped band, except for a handful who, short
 on food and ammunition, have been rendered ineffective.
 Guerrillas Elsewhere in Latin America
 Castro's "lucha armada" has fared no better in other Latin American
 countries.   In Venezuela, after the brutal kidnap-slaying in March 1967
 of Dr. Julio Iribarren Borges, brother of the Foreign Minister, by the
 underground branch of the Cuban-supported Venezuelan Armed Forces of
 National Liberation (FALN), authorities intensified their drive against
 the insurgency, killing or capturing more than a dozen terrorists includ-
 ing a number of high-ranking Cuban Army officers.   In Colombia the army
 and police have to contend with two separate guerrilla movements, the
 Castro-supported Army of National Liberation (ELN) and the Revolutionary
 Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).   Both groups have been driven from their
 home bases into the jungle and have been relatively quiescent for the
 past six months.   In Peru three Castro-backed guerrilla bands were
 knocked out of action by efficient Peruvian security forces within seven
 months of their first foray two years ago and have not been able to
 reorganize since.   Two rival insurgency groups in Guatemala, the Cuban-
 backed Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) and the orthodox Communist Party (PGT)
 forces, have suffered severe losses since the government's  intensified
 counterinsurgency campaign began in late 1966.  And in Nicaragua., since

 last August, the National Guard has inflicted heavy blows on the guer-
 rilla arm of the local pro-Castro Sandinist National Liberation Front
 (FSLN).   Nicaraguan guerrillas, like those in Bolivia, have not received
 sufficient support from the populace tb be able to act effectively.
 Latin American Communist Reactions to Guevara's Death
 Until Fidel Castro officially acknowledged Guevara's death on
 radio and television on the night of 15 October with a great show of
 emotion and expression of sadness, thereby setting the pace for later
 Communist press eulogies, the leftist press in Latin America confined
 its coverage of the guerrilla leader to speculation on whether or not
 he was actually dead.  After Castro's speech, however, the leftist press
 loosed a flood of articles praising Guevara as a hero of the revolution
 who died a martyr's death.   Even many of the non-Communist Latin Ameri-
 can newspapers echoed his praise as a "man of conviction who practiced
 what he preached."  Privately, however, comments of Moscow-oriented
 Latin American Communists ranged from calling Guevara's death the con-
 clusion of a series of errors on the part of the Cuban leader to out-
 right attacks on Castro's theory of armed revolution -- usually implying
 that the fiasco in Bolivia would never have occurred under orthodox Com-
 munist leadership.                             In mid-October the editor of the left-leaning Peruvian
 newspaper Expreso summed up the view held by most orthodox Latin American
 Communists:
 Guevara's death proves the Moscow thesis that guerrilla-led
 revolutions will not succeed in Latin America.  The reason
 for their failure is simple:   Castroites believe rather naively
 that the conditions of Batista's Cuba will carry over to
 South America, but the conditions are not remotely similar.
 In this regard, it is paradoxical that the Castroite ideolo-
 gist Debray should harshly criticize the traditional Communist
 parties for exporting foreign experiments to Latin America
 when he and Guevara made the same error --' trying to apply the
 Cuban experience on the Andean countries.
 Latin American Communist Attacks on Castro and Debray
 Expreso's sweeping criticism of all three revolutionary leaders in
 one article is rare.   However, strong Communist; attacks against their
 concepts of revolution began after the publication in Havana in early
 1967 of Debray's controversial pamphlet entitled "Revolution Within the
 Revolution?    which raised a storm of protests from the Moscow-oriented
 Latin American parties.   Its concept that revolution can be exported
 and that armed action can be taken 'without the necessary conditions
 existing first and without the leadership of the Communist Party, belied
 everything that the Latin American parties stood for, and they were
 quick to publish their rebuttals.   In July 1967 the Communist Party of
 Argentina (PCA) published a 39-page document ("There Can Be No 'Revolu-
 tion Within The Revolution'') by Rodolfo Ghioldi, the "military expert"

 The revolutionary current which emerges on a "petit bourgeois"
 basis usually underrates the proletariat and the Communist
 parties, is more disposed toward nationalism, adventurism
 and terrorism, and sometimes permits anti-Communist and anti-
 Soviet attitudes.
 The Soviet endorsement of Corvalan's article is in line with the
 stress they place on the question of proper timing in revolutionary
 strategy in Latin America.   The Soviets are not against Castro's theories
 per se, but believe that the forces of the revolutionary left are
 generally too weak in Latin America at this time to make armed revolu-
 tion against the established governments practical.   Consequently the
 strategy of the Moscow-oriented Communist parties is to build up their
 strength and influence against the day when seizure of power will be
 feasible.   Their general feeling is that Castroism -- especially because
 of its sucession of failures in Latin America -- has damaged the cause
 of Communism by making even the more permissive governments wary of the
 Communist threat -- resulting in the development of more restrictive
 measures against Communism (anti-Communist laws in Brazil, for example)
 and the buildup of anti-Communist military forces.   The Soviets are
 particularly embarrassed by Castro's activities at this time when they
 are emphasizing "peaceful coexistence" in an effort to build up confi-
 dence among the Latin American countries with whom they wish to estab-
 lish trade and cultural exchanges.   It should be borne in mind, however,
 that the Soviets are willing to put up with a great deal of embarrass-
 ment from Castro in order to retain Cuba -- as evidenced by the continued
 flow of their large-scale military and economic assistance to that
 country.
 Annoyed by Castro's latest "adventure" in Bolivia, but not wishing
 an open break with him, the Soviets have "saved face" by encouraging a
 series
 ~~of mildly critical press articles against "petit bourgeois adven-
 turism  without actually naming either Castro or Guevara as targets.   On
 25 October Pravda carried an article by Rudolfo Ghioldi, secretary of
 the outlawed Argentine Communist Party, which states, in part:
 Maoism and related currents advertise extreme adventurism,
 adapting the "offensive theory" to any situation regardless of
 the presence of objective and subjective conditions.   They pro-
 pose that a revolution can be initiated from the outside and
 artificially stimulated across the borders, considering the
 nature of revolution isolated from the process of class struggle
 in the countries involved....   The most violent criticism is
 directed against the Soviet Union which is planning and
 actually carrying out the building of communism.    ...Petit-
 bourgeois nationalists are also stubbornly insisting it is
 necessary for Latin American countries to proceed directly to
 socialist revolution, spurning the preliminary stages of
 agrarian, anti-imperialist and democratic revolutions.   In the
 narrow aspiration to prove the "weakness" of invincible

 of the PCA, attacking Debray's thesis by a.seerting that it is the working
 class led by the Communist Party which, having gained the support of
 the peasants and students, will bring about revolution by force of arms
 or by other means.   Thus the Party defends its policy of the via Pacifica,
 or peaceful way to power, and insists on the primacy of the established
 Communist Party and the urban proletariat in the revolutionary process.
 In September 1967 the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB) joined the
 offensive against Castroism by attacking Debray in an article by Simao
 Bonjardim entitled "The Revolution and the Revolution of Regis Debray"
 (Voz Operaria, Issue No. XXXI).  The PCB article introduces some new
 elements into its rebuttal of Debray's concepts.   It denigrates Castro
 as a product of the Cuban revolution rather than its guiding spirit and
 points out that his success there was owing in no small measure to the
 help he got, directly and indirectly, from the United States -- affording
 a favorable climate for revolution which does not exist in Latin America,
 now that Washington is alerted and is supporting anti-guerrilla forces.
 Bonjardim further belittles Castro's armed struggle in Cuba by attempt-
 ing to prove that the success of the revolution in that country derived,
 not from the force of arms, but from the concentrated pressure of the
 great masses of the Cuban people -- with external support from the world
 socialist camp.   Since Debray's book is widely regarded as an expression
 of Castro's thinking, these sharp attacks on Debray may be viewed as
 attacks on Castro himself.
 Soviet Reactions to Guevara's Death and to Castro
 Although Guevara received some mild eulogies in the Soviet press
 at the time of his death, there were no commendations "for a dead hero"
 at Soviet ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union.
 The Soviet press was also significantly quiet on the subject.  The Soviets
 are obviously annoyed with Castro these days and they undoubtedly view
 the Guevara affair as a setback to their ambitions in Latin America --
 not because he attempted to foment a guerrilla war, but 'because he failed.
 However, the Soviets are willing to endure the personal faults of the
 Cuban leaders in favor of the greater prize --- retention of their Commu-
 nist outpost in the Caribbean.   Instead of showing their annoyance by
 publicly attacking Castro, they have resorted to their favorite tactic
 of using others to voice their views for them.   On the eve of the :recent
 LASO meeting, for example, Pravda (30 July 1967) published a long dis-
 cussion of revolution in Latin America, written by the Secretary General
 of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Chile (PCCh), Luis
 Corvalan.  Although the piece was entitled "The Alliance of Revolutionary
 Anti-Imperialist Forces in Latin America" and in its original form (dis-
 tributed in Chile) was a skillful blend of favorable and. unfavorable
 comments on Castro and Cuba, it set the pace for later, sharper, Moscow-
 inspired criticisms of Castro, which appeared after the LASO meeting and
 again after Guevara's death.   In his piece Corvalan uses the favorite
 Soviet term for supporters of Castro's brand of revolution -- "petit
 bourgeoisie:"

 Marxist-Leninist positions they are attempting nothing other
 than to repudiate the basic proposition of the unity of the
 world socialist system, of the proletarian movement in capi-
 talist countries and of the national liberation movement in
 dependent countries.
 After the death of Guevara, Luis Corvalan resumed his role of spokesman
 for Latin American Communist orthodoxy.   In a Pravda article of 27 October
 1967, he writes:
 From 1918 to 1922 the Communist parties of Argentina, Brazil,
 Mexico,. Uruguay and Chile were created...   In all seriousness
 it can be said that these parties are the offspring of their
 own peoples and the result of the social development of their
 corresponding countries...   In several circles of Latin America
 one usually speaks of these parties as traditional, orthodox
 and moderate.  And this is only because they are true to the
 principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism,
 true to an actually traditional friendship with Lenin's party,
 and they long ago rejected the phraseology of revolutionary-
 ism.   These parties incite the hatred of enemies and give
 rise to great fear among them.   Namely these parties in any
 situation form the most reliable detachment of the revolutionary
 movement on the continent.
 The above passages are typical Soviet reactions to Castro's extrem-
 ism -- mild rebukes through the medium of a third party without ever
 referring to Castro by name.  Well aware that the Soviets are prepared
 to endure much embarrassment from him, Castro sometimes pushes them to
 the limit -- as he did on the recent occasion of the Kremlin ceremonies
 marking the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union.   The Soviet Government
 had expected Cuba to be represented by President Osvaldo Dorticos;
 instead, Castro sent low-ranking Minister of Health Jose Ramon Machado,
 accompanied by a provincial party secretary.   The Soviets reacted by
 refusing to ask Machado to speak at the ceremonies on 3 and 4 November
 -- although he was the only representative of a major Communist party
 (except those of China and Albania, which boycotted the festivities)
 who did not take the rostrum.   On the other hand, the speakers included
 delegates from the Chilean and Uruguayan Communist parties, both out-
 spoken in their criticism of Castro's revolutionary concepts.
 In this manner the Soviets continue their triple-game -- criti-
 cizing Castro to mollify the orthodox Communist parties, supporting
 revolution in Latin America by supplying Castro with arms, equipment and
 money, and finally attempting to establish economic and cultural agree-
 ments with the very Latin American states they are at the same time try-
 ing to subvert!

 French Marxist Regis Debra
 On 17 November a Bolivian military court sentenced Regis Debray,
 author of "Revolution Within the Revolution?" to 30 years in prision the maximum penalty in Bolivia -- for his part; in the guerrilla movement
 led by Che Guevara.  Excerpts from Guevara's diary were used by the
 military prosecutor to help convict Debray of complicity in murder, sub-
 version, robbery and other crimes arising from his. association with
 Guevara.   There is a certain irony in the exposure of Debra;y by the
 dead man's diary, since it was actually Debray, at the time of his
 arrest last April, who gave the authorities their first clue that Guevara
 was alive and operating in Bolivia.  This knowledge encouraged them to
 intensify the campaign against the the guerrillas that ultimately led to
 Guevara's death.

 Guevara Legacy
 Castroite Rebels in Latin America
 Find Troubles Deepening
 By NORMAN GALL
 CARACAS-The death nt Ernesto "Cho"
 Guevara, Latin America's most glamorous
 guerrilla warrior, Is but one more step in the
 deterioration of the conditions of guerrilla
 warfare in the hemisphere.
 While Fidel Castro continues to trumpet
 armed revolution throughout Latin America,
 and in the Negro slums of the U.S. as well,
 Communist guerrilla insurgencies formed in
 recent years with Castro's aid and Inspiration
 are sinking Into deeper and deeper trouble.
 These reversals have come swiftly in
 Peru. Bolivia (where Guevara was killed),
 Colombia and Guatemala. And here In Vene-
 zuela, after seven years of terrorism and
 guerrilla warfare, the colossal  drama of
 armed. Communist Insurrection seems to be
 entering its final stages. Shrunken, divided
 and deeply Infiltrated by government agents,
 the insurrectional movement has been stag-
 gering through a psychological depression. Its
 crippled capacity for action contrasts sharply
 to the cyclonic urban terrorism of 1962-63 and
 the expanding rural guerrilla activity of three
 years ago.
 Over the years the Castro Communist Fuer-
 zas Armadas de Liberation Nacional (FALN)
 has shown amazing resilience in the face of
 military and police pressure, and its surviv-
 ing-though fragmented-elements are still
 capable of spectacular strikes. But these ac.
 lions are becoming more and more infrequent
 and are being met, increasingly, with crush-
 ing blows from the army and police. More-
 over, the "orthodox" Venezuelan Communist
 Party, once the hard core of the. FALN guer-'
 rills, and terrorist organization, is suing for
 peace.
 `Repugnant Opportunism'
 The party's switch, to coexistence tactics
 was animated by hopes for profitable alli- ;
 antes in next year's presidential election
 campaign, and for preserving its trained ca-
 dres against suicidal destruction at the hands
 of the' police. However, Castro has branded
 these tactics "cowardice and repugnant op-
 portunlem" while plugging for continuation of
 the "armed struggle" under his own banner.
 Attacking  Moscow-line  Communists  In
 Latin America (and Russian soft-pedaling In
 the hemisphere) in probably his most impor-
 tant theoretical statement to date, Castro said
 in a March 13 speech at the Unfverslty of Ha-
 vana:
 "Our position  toward  Communlt parties
 will be based on strictly revolutionary princi-
 ,pies. To the parties ... that take a consis?
 tently revolutionary position, we will give
 total support. But in any country where those
 that call themselves Communists do not know
 how to fulfill their (revolutionary) duties, we
 will support those who, though not labeled
 Communists, behave like true Communists in
 action and struggle. This is because all true
 revolutionaries, who carry within themselves
 revolutionary vocation and spirit, will always
 terminate in Marxism I"

 -In Pent: three Castroite guerrilla bands
 were knocked out of action in 1965.66-their
 ,leaders either killed or jailed-within seven
 months of executing their first ambush.
 -In  Guatemala,  two  rival     insurgency
 rnovemcnte that had been gaining ground
 steadily for four years have been decimated
 over the past year by an army campaign of
 ,rural slaughter in which peasants have been
 impressed into right-wing vigilante organiza-
 tions (using weapons supplied in the U. S.
 military aid program) that have burned vil-
 )ages and killed roughly 2,000 persons in the
 Guatemalan guerrilla zone.
 -In Bolivia, last spring a large guerrilla
 training base (disguised as a farm) was acci-
 dentally discovered in the jungle along with
 evidence indicating the presence of Guevara,
 who had not been seen publicly since 1965.
 The guerrillas in Bolivia, including some
 Cuban army officers, apparently have dis-
 'persed after a few clashes with Bolivian army
 patrols in which both sides have suffered
 heavy losses.
 -In Columbia, the army has driven two
 separate guerrilla movements from home.
 !bases into marginal jungle areas from which
 they have not been heard in six months. In
 Ecuador, Paraguay and Argentina, entire
 guerrilla units have been captured while still
 training and before they could execute a sin-
 gle attack.
 It is quite possible that most of these guer-
 rilla movements would have met little politi-
 cal or military resistance it Latin American
 regular armies had not been backstopped by
 nearly $2 billion of U. S. arms donations and
 training since 1950. While some of the major
 ,objectives of the Alliance for Progress have
 not been achieved, there has been a steady
 liberalizing trend among Latin American gov- student, Luis Vera Bctancourt. The initial
 ernments and in some cases a notable im-blast sent "Loco Fabricio" leaping through a
 provoment in peasant living standards. But,window and onto the roof of the next house,

 the tremendous social tensions in the region court, a veteran delegate at world youth con-
 rould drive important sectors of the military,
 even officers trained in the U. S., into collabo-

 "Fresh outbursts of warfare will arise in
 'these and other American countries, as has
 ,already occurred in Bolivia." Guevara an-
 nounced in the last public statement attrib-
 uted to him. "Many will die, victims of their
 own errors. Others will fall in the difficult
 combat that is near. New fighters and now
 leaders will emerge in the heat of the revolu-

 that revolutionaries should avoid procedures
 that become an instrument for the enemy:
 Killing a man after kidnapping him. We never
 did this, whatever our indignation at the
 ferocities of the enemy."
 And the three principal party leaders who
 organized the "armed struggle" and who only
 three weeks before escaped from the San Car-
 los Military Prison in Caracas condemned the
 deed as "playing into the hands of the'coun-
 try's most reactionary forces, blocking the re-
 cuperation of the people's movement and' de-
 pressing it further."
 Scrawl on the Tiles
 At 2 p.m., "Loco Fabricio" was about to
 eat lunch in a small house in a working class
 district when the building was blasted by ma.
 chine gun fire from political police agents
 surrounding it. With him was a former law

 wrecked by gunfire, where he scrawled on the
 wall: "I am wounded and helpless." His body

 to his wife a few days before his death.
 "Sometimes I think that nothing in the world
 is worth the price I have paid. I am sustained
 only by the idea that I am fighting for the lib.
 erty of my people."
 The death of these two men was the cli-
