 THE VIETNAM SITUATION                                                          r
 A US air strike on 15 March heavily damaged Phu Qui
 ammunition depot about 100 miles south of Hanoi.
 South Vietnamese aircraft had hit military barracks on
 Tiger Island on 14 March.  No Chinese Communist or
 Soviet military reaction to either strike has been
 noted.  The Chinese, however, are trying to encourage
 neutral pressure against stepped-up US military action,
 and private Soviet approaches to US officials are stress-
 ing  Moscow's interest in a negotiated settlement.-                25X1
 In South Vietnam government forces

 and the Quat administration is facing its usual problems
 of countering political intrigue.

 US aircraft struck deeper
 into North Vietnamese territory
 during the past week,  hitting
 a target about a hundred miles
 from Hanoi on 15 March.   This
 attack followed a 14 March air
 strike by South Vietnamese
 planes on Tiger Island.   No
 military reaction by either
 Communist China or the USSR has
 been noted since the air strikes.
 In South Vietnam the govern-
 ment is clearly on the defensive
 in most of the countryside. More-
 over, the administration of Pre-
 mier Quat is facing its usual
 problems of countering political
 intrigue.
 South Vietnamese aircraft
 struck the Hon Gio military bar-
 racks on Tiger Island on 14
 March.   Poststrike photography
 revealed that of the nine admin-
 istration and storage buildings
 in the target area, one was
 partially destroyed, another
 severely damaged, and three more
 sustained some roof damage.   No
 aircraft were lost on this raid.
 The Hon Gio attack was fol-
 lowed on 15 March by a US attack
 on the Phu Qui ammunition depot
 approximately 100 miles south of
 Hanoi.   Poststrike photography
 indicates that the target area
 suffered heavy damage.   Eighteen
 of the buildings were completely
 destroyed and 11 severely dam-
 aged.   One aircraft and pilot
 were lost at sea returning from
 the mission.
 Recent analysis of
 photography of the Phuc
 Yen airfield revealed that 19
 dummy aircraft were parked there
 along with 34 MIG-15/17 fighters.
 There apparently has been no ad-
 ditional deployment of fighter
 aircraft into North Vietnam
 since August 1964 when a regi-
 ment of 36 fighters first oc-
 cupied Phuc Yen.
 Developments in the DRV
 ~  Noting
 that the 15 March strike pene-
 trated "deeper into our territory
 than before," a 16 March party
 daily editorial exhorted the
 people and the armed forces in
 the north to "always stand ready
 ...in coordination with the lib-
 eration forces in the south" to
 "defend... the airspace, territo-
 rial waters, and territory of
 our country."
 The regime in Hanoi is also
 attempting to bolster the con-
 fidence of its people by assert-
 ing that "volunteers" from all
 over the world stand ready to
 come to the defense of North
 Vietnam.   According to a Hanoi
 radio domestic broadcast on 16
 March, many youths from the
 Soviet Union, Communist China,
 and other nations have volun-
 teered for service in Vietnam.

 Chinese Communist Activities
 Peiping reacted sharply to
 the 15 March strike, warning
 in a17 March People's Daily edi-
 torial that "the further U                       im-
 perialism goes in expanding ag-
 gression," the "more impossible
 will be the prospect of bring-
 ing about a political settle-
 ment."  The editorial hinted
 darkly that "the wa.r of aggres-
 sion must be countered with a
 war of antiagression."
 While Peiping's public
 posture on Vietnam remains in-
 flexible, the Chinese have been
 putting out mixed signals in
 private, apparently in an ef-
 fort to encourage confusion
 abroad as to their intentions.
 They sent the China. correspond-
 ent of Agence France Presse
 (AFP) on a.n unsoli ite    rip
 between 16 February and 1 March
 which included stops in Kunming
 and Nanning and a, rail journey
 from Kunming to a point near
 the Vietnamese border.  The cor-
 respondent claims to have seen
 "no military activity whatso-
 ever" and told officials in the
 US Consulate General at Hong
 Kong that a. medium-level Chi-
 nese official in Kunming had
 made the point explicitly that
 Chinese troops were not prepar-
 ing to intervene in Vietnam.
 Similarly, during talks in
 Peiping with President Ayub and
 other Pakistani officials early
 this month, the Chinese appar-
 ently made another attempt to
 encourage neutral pressure
 against stepped-up US military   25X1
 action in Vietnam by  present-
 ing themselves as reasonable
 and willing to talk.
 Peiping prob-
 a.bly calculates that talks                                                                             25X1

 conducted on this basis might
 relieve the pressure on Hanoi
 while permitting the Viet Cong
 to continue their campaign un-
 hindered.
 Peiping continues to ex-
 ploit events related to Vietnam
 in the Sino-Soviet conflict.
 Four of the Chinese students al-
 legedly injured by the Soviet
 police during the anti-US riots
 in Moscow on 4 March received
 a. hero's welcome when they re-
 turned to China, on 14 March.
 The Chinese have "categorically
 rejected" Moscow's 12 March
 note justifying Soviet actions
 and have accused the USSR of
 attempting to "reverse right
 and wrong."  The People's Daily
 has flatly charged that t    So-
 viet Government has placed it-
 self "under the thumb of US im-
 perialism," and Peiping has given
 wide publicity to its 16 Ma.rch
 diplomatic note to Moscow which
 reiterates charges of police
 brutality and once again demands
 Soviet apologies.
 Although the USSR is hold-
 ing to a. public position of un-
 compromising support for North
 Vietnam, private Soviet approaches
 to US officials continue to
 stress Moscow's interest in an
 eventual negotiated settlement.
 Moscow has rejected the
 British proposal of 20 February
 for joint action by the Geneva
 co-chairmen to explore a. peace-
 ful settlement and has published
 its own draft of a. co-chairmen
 message which condemns alleged
 US violations of the Geneva.
 agreements and demands that US
 forces stop "aggressive actions"
 against North Vietnam and with-
 draw from South Vietnam.
 In contrast to this un-
 yielding public posture, private
 approaches to US officials stress
 Moscow's desire to a.void involve-
 ment in the Vietnam conflict
 and to cooperate with the US in
 moving toward a. political set-
 tlement.
 The Soviet ambassador to
 Luxembourg--a past source of
 Soviet trial ba.lloons--told his
 US colleague on 15 March that
 the US and the USSR, as the
 "only na.tions which really count,"
 should be able to work out a
 solution which would remove the
 risk of wa.r.   He contended that
 Peiping, not Hanoi,  is the  "real
 obstacle" to a settlement and
 argued that air attacks against
 North Vietna.m would not bring
 a solution because Ha.noi is "not
 the problem."  The Soviet a.mbas-
 sa.dor repeated earlier private
 warnings tha.t, if the conflict
 escalates, the USSR ma.y not be
 able to avoid involvement.
 In discussing possible
 terms for a. settlement, the So-
 viet ambassador indica.ted that
 an arrangement involving the
 withdrawal, under appropriate
 gua.ra.ntees,  of all foreign forces
 from South Vietnam,  including
 the North Vietnamese,  "seemed
 reasonable."  The US ambassador
 recalls that this same Soviet
 official made a similar approach
 regarding the desirability of a
 :nuclea.r test ban treaty "very
 early in the game."

 In his farewell call on
 Ambassador Bohlen in Paris on
 12 March, departing Soviet Am-
 bassador Vinogradov took a
 similar line.   He repeated
 several times that a continua-
 tion of hostilities is pushing
 the Vietnamese toward Peiping.
 Vinogradov asserted that there
 could be no thought of a con-
 ference so long as US bombard-
 ment of the DRV continued.   He
 expressed the hope that the
 USSR could work with the US to
 bring about peace in Vietnam.
 Viet Cong Military Action
 In the northern and cen-
 tral provinces of South Viet-
 nam, the Communists continue
 their efforts to consolidate
 their gains and reduce govern-
 ment control to areas around
 isolated towns and major pop-
 ulation centers.   Binh Dinh
 Province remains the focal
 point of Viet Cong operations
 in the central coastal regions,
 while increased guerrilla ac-
 tivity in the highlands of
 Kontum Province lends credi-
 bility to the recent reports
 of a build-up of enemy forces
 in the northwestern portion of
 the province.   Sabotage and
 interdiction of land lines of
 communication remain widespread,
 extending from the provinces of
 Quang Tri and Thua Thien in the
 north through the coastal prov-
 inces  of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai,
 Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and Khanh
 Hoa.   Control of the coasts by
 the Viet Cong would facilitate
 flexibility in logistical and
 offensive operations, while sus-
 tained denial of coastal high-
 ways and railways to government
 forces would seriously reduce
 the mobility of these forces and
 their capability for quick re-
 action.
 To the south, Communist
 military pressure remains in-
 tense in the provinces east of
 Saigon,  and in the tactical
 areas of the government's 5th
 aiad 25th Divisions,  immediately
 to the west and south of Saigon.
 In the delta, the pattern of
 Viet Cong activity continues to
 suggest a holding operation,
 with the insurgents consolidat-
 ing their forces, refraining
 from major attacks, but apply-
 ing steady pressure on the
 countryside in the form of ter-
 rorism, harassments, and road
 sabotage.

 Developments
 Uneasiness has persisted
 in Saigon over a projected for-
 mal military meeting on command
 changes and over rumors of a
 possible prior move by one or
 another military faction.   No

 coup plotting has been noted,

 FUTURE OF UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS REMAINS MUDDLED
 The 33 members of the UN
 Special Committee on Peace-
 keeping Operations, appointed
 by Assembly President Quaison-
 Sackey four weeks ago,  have
 consulted endlessly with each
 other without coming to grips
 with the problem or even de-
 ciding on committee procedures.
 The committee is expected to
 hold its first organizational
 meeting about 26 March and,  if
 all goes as Quaison-Sackey
 plans, will adjourn for about
 two months to permit further
 private consultations.   The
 committee's report is due to
 the General Assembly by 15
 June.
 The special committee con-
 sists of the Big Four--Nation-
 alist China was left out in
 order to get the USSR's cooper-
 ation--plus six countries in
 Africa, six in Asia, five in
 the Soviet bloc,  five in Latin
 America,  and seven in Western
 Europe and the Commonwealth.
 Opposition to an early meeting
 of the committee by both the
 US and the USSR is being in-
 terpreted by many Africans and
 Asians as further evidence
 that Moscow and Washington in-
 tend to strike a bargain be-
 tween themselves on the future
 of peacekeeping operations.
 These countries fear that the
 committee will then be asked
 only to rubber-stamp approval
 of an agreement which,  to be
 acceptable to the USSR, would
 be bound to detract from the
 assembly's powers in the peace-
 keeping field.
 One of the thornier issues
 under discussion is the question
 of whether the committee should
 discuss past and present UN
 peacekeeping operations or con-
 fine itself to considering prob-
 lems related to future under-
 takings.   France has threatened
 to attend meetings only as an
 observer if the committee goes
 into past and present operations.
 Paris maintains that once the
 future conduct of peacekeeping
 operations is settled the prob-
 lem of past debts will be re-
 duced to manageable proportions.
 The USSR tends to take much the
 same line.
 On the problem of settling
 financial arrearages, partic-
 ullarly the Soviet and French
 debts,  it now seems evident that
 the discussions will avoid em-
 phasis on Article 19 and con-
 centrate on the "restoration of
 the UN's financial solvency."
 The UN is presently in the hole
 approximately $120 million.   The
 prevalant feeling is that if
 the USSR contributes a sum that
 will bring its arrears below the
 two-year limit allowed by Ar-
 ticle19, the remaining Soviet
 debt could "lie dormant on the
 books."   The British UN dele-
 gation,  however,  considers that
 the whole slate of arrears must
 be wiped clean if adequate vol-
 untary contributions are t
 f orthcomine

 The Soviet leaders are appar-
 ently preparing to hold a meeting
 of the party's central committee,
 possibly within the next three
 weeks.   Rumors that a meeting was
 imminent have been noted in Moscow,
 and Prague Radio announced on 8
 March that a plenum of the Soviet
 party body would be held soon.   A
 Mongolian party-government delega-
 tion has apparently been told not
 to arrive in Moscow before 10
 April, suggesting that the plenum
 would be held earlier.
 During the latter years of the
 Khrushchev era, central committee
 plenums were usually announced
 several weeks in advance.   The new
 leadership may feel, however, that
 such notice leads to premature dis-
 cussion and polemics.
 According to the Prague Radio
 announcement the Soviet central
 committee will discuss agriculture.
 With the 1965 growing season ap-
 proaching, agriculture certainly
 seems the most.likely topic.   Al-
 though the new regime has made
 some changes in agricultural pol-
 icy and leadership,  it has yet to
 define a new program to replace
 the policies discredited following
 Khrushchev's ouster last fall.
 The US Embassy in Moscow has
 rioted signs of "forced draft" de-
 liberation on means to improve
 the operation of the economy, sug-
 gesting that the plenum might con-
 sider proposals for changes in
 the economic system.   From the
 course of the discussion thus far,
 however,  it seems unlikely that
 the Soviet leaders will be pre-
 pared to embark on a new program
 of economic reform for several

 USSR TO BUILD GAS PIPELINES FROM CENTRAL ASIA TO MOSCOW
 Construction will begin this
 year on the ambitious and expen-
 sive project of linking the Moscow
 industrial area with natural gas
 fields in Central Asia.
 Initiation of this project
 suggests a growing confidence on
 the USSR's part in its ability to
 fabricate larger quantities of 40-
 inch-diameter pipe domestically.
 It also demonstrates that the gov-
 ernment continues to prefer to con-
 centrate energy-intensive indus-
 tries in the European USSR--at the
 cost of transporting fuel great
 distances--rather than to locate
 new plants in remote, but fuel-
 surplus areas.
 Initially the system will
 consist of two parallel 40-inch
 lines, each capable of carrying
 10 billion cubic meters of gas an-
 nually.                                                                                  These two lines, accord-
 ing to the Soviet press, will use
 4,240 miles of pipe.   The first,
 scheduled for completion by 1967,
 will. require almost a million met-
 ric tons of steel pipe and a cap-
 ital investment of more than $300
 million.   Eventually the USSR
 plans to build a second and third
 system--each apparently consist-
 ing of two parallel pipelines--
 along the same route and to ex-   25X1
 tend the supply of Central Asian
 gas to the Baltic and Leningrad

 The Communist World
 ANTIREGIME HOAX UNDERSCORES PEIPING'S PROBLEM WITH YOUTH
 Chinese Communist leaders
 are angered and worried by the
 success of an audacious anti-
 regime hoax that appeared in
 the last 1964 issue of China
 Youth magazine.   Their surpris-
 nnggly strong reaction denotes
 a deep-felt--and probably jus-
 tified--suspicion that the
 younger generation is unenthu-
 siastic about the Maoist brand
 of Communism.
 China Youth--the major
 journal    r i.n octrinating
 youth--reproduced a painting
 which contains several clever
 antiparty devices concealed in
 an otherwise acceptable motif
 typical of socialist realism
 (see facing page).   Millions
 of copies had apparently been
 distributed to all parts of
 China weeks before enraged of-
 ficials discovered the decep-
 tion and recalled all copies.
 Peiping's sensitive reac-
 tion can be explained in part
 in cultural terms.   China's in-
 tellectuals have traditionally
 expressed antiregime sentiments
 in the guise of safe-seeming
 art, but this is the first known
 important recurrence of the
 usage under Communist rule.
 Far more disturbing to party
 leaders, however, are the grow-
 ing signs, such as this hoax,
 that the regime's massive indoc-
 trination efforts directed at
 young people have failed.   These
 efforts have been stepped up dur-
 ing the past two years in an at-
 tempt to rekindle some of the
 zeal lost after the failures of
 the Leap Forward.   The regime
 Is attempting to counter the
 considerable disaffection which
 :Lies beneath youth's surface con-
 formity.
 Mao himself,  in recent com-
 ments to visitors, has openly
 displayed his increasing personal
 distrust of China's youth.   Re-
 flecting this distrust are the
 major changes that have been put
 into effect over the last year in
 the organization and leadership
 of youth bodies.   In a notable
 example this February, Hu Yao-
 pang, YCL head since 1952, was
 shipped out to regional part
 duties in northwest China

 CHANGES ON RUMANIA'S INTELLECTUAL SCENE
 The Rumanian regime in re-
 cent weeks has taken some im-
 portant steps toward meeting the
 growing desires among intellec-
 tuals for fewer controls over
 their activities and for contact
 with the West.   The regime's ac-
 tions in the long run could lead,
 despite cautious implementation,
 to pressures for broader policies
 of relaxation benefiting the en-
 tire population.
 A most significant step was
 the choice of a reported moder-
 ate, Demostene Botez,  to replace
 old-guard Stalinist Mihai Beniuc
 as president of the Writers'
 Union.   The shift was accompanied
 by a central committee message
 to the union endorsing greater
 freedom of expression.  The mes-
 sage implicitly attacked past
 union leadership for "ignoring
 the specific character of artis-
 tic creativity," and called for
 the "stimulation of a broad ex-
 change of opinions."
 Prior to these developments
 the regime had been urging at-
 tention to Rumania's national
 literary heritage rather than
 to that of the USSR.   Also,
 after 20 years of isolation,
 Rumanian writers and critics now
 can comment on such previously
 taboo authors as Kafka and other
 Western writers who are also be-
 ing endorsed.   The plays by mod-
 ern American authors,  including
 O'Neill,  Steinbeck, Miller, and
 Albee,  are being performed in
 Bucharest, while only one modern
 Soviet playwright   is represented.
 Party First Secretary Gheorghiu-
 I)ej,  over a year ago had said:
 "We do not hide in our shell...
 we are doing--and we will con-
 tinue to do in the future--all.
 that is necessary in order that
 our readers may become better
 acquainted with works of other
 writers."
 In addition,  the first
 major displays of abstract art
 appeared in Bucharest in mid-
 February.   The regime's stamp
 Df approval was evidenced when
 'Vice Premier Birladeanu pur-
 chased some of the displayed
 paintings.
 Trends of liberalization
 and Westernization have also
 reached into the fields of music
 and social sciences.   Although
 music has never been subjected
 to harsh restrictions,  the Ru-
 manian party and cultural press
 has been agitating in recent
 months for even more frequent
 performances of modern Western
 music.   In the social sciences,
 de-Russification and attention
 to national traditions have
 brought about the partial re-     25X1
 habilitation of leading bourgeois
 scholars of the interwar   period.

 Growing violence is develop-
 ing in Indonesia between the
 Communist Party (PKI)  and Moslem
 organizations.   The greatest
 number of incidents have occurred
 in East Java,  where the orthodox
 Moslem party, Nahdatul Ulama (NU),
 has its greatest strength, but
 difficulties have also occurred
 in Central Java and in Atjeh in
 northern Sumatra.
 The incidents appear to have
 begun about last November.   They
 have occurred with increasing
 frequency during the past six
 weeks.   Initially they arose from
 resistance to illegal Communist
 land seizures,  but recently Mos-
 lem groups have sought to disrupt
 almost any Communist activity,
 particularly meetings of Commu-
 nist front groups.
 In East Java a press polemic
 of unusual vehemence and explicit-
 ness has developed between PKI
 dailies and papers controlled by
 the NU.   Last month the NU press
 blamed the PKI for turmoil in
 East Java,  called for action by
 the authorities "before it is
 too late," and demanded the ban-
 ning of all pro-PKI newspapers
 on the grounds that they "stir
 disunity, distort problems,
 and spread slanders."
 Until recently little public-
 ity had been given these develop-
 ments.   Even now the Communists,
 instead of denouncing the NU,
 are using the pattern of violence
 to develop a case against one of
 their favorite targets,  the
 Moslem anti-Communist student
 organization "HMI."  Claiming that
 the HMI is responsible for "ter-
 rorist activities" in Java, the
 Communists have asked Sukarno to
 ban it.   HMI's disappearance would
 eliminate the most effective imped-
 iment to eventual Communist capture
 of the Indonesian university system.
 The Communists apparently are
 trying to undermine the other
 groups by charging that the US is
 supporting an anti-Communist move-
 ment in East Java.   In a recent
 speech, Sukarno claimed that Islam-
 ic organizations were being used
 for subversion, and an eventual
 government move against NU front
 groups seems likely.
 25X1
 An Indonesian Government move
 against American-owned oil com-
 panies may be imminent.
 The Communist Party has demanded
 seizure of the companies for some
 time,  and on 18 March Communist
 labor groups reportedly took control
 ,of the Stanvac refinery in South
 Sumatra.
 The Communists have also prob-
 ably encouraged unrest in the
 navy.   Admiral Martadinata,  the
 chief of staff, has long been one
 of their prime targets.   Two
 Communist officers were arrested
 for their involvement in the re- 25X1
 cent mutiny of junior officers
 which aimed at removing him.

 Communal fighting has bro-
 ken out on Cyprus for the first
 time in several months,  and Tur-
 key is taking steps which could
 be preparatory to military in-
 tervention.
 The new violence began on
 12 March in northwest Cyprus
 near Lefka, the largest Turkish
 town on the island.   Units of
 the Greek Cypriot National Guard
 have virtually surrounded two
 small Turkish towns nearby.
 Lefka itself has not come under
 direct attack.   Despite some
 relatively heavy firing, few
 casualties are reported.
 At the same time Greek and
 Turkish Cypriot leaders have ex-
 changed unusually bitter denun-
 ciations.
 The Turks appear to be pre-
 paring once again for armed ac-
 tion,  possibly in connection
 with the scheduled rotation of
 their troops on Cyprus by the
 end of March in the face of con-
 tinued opposition from Nicosia.
 Turkish armed forces are in an
 increased alert status, and
 training and readiness opera-
 tions apparently will be stepped
 up.    The Turkish press re-
 ports joint amphibious opera-
 tions planned for the Gulf of
 Iskenderun on 24 March.   The
 regularly scheduled rotation of
 Turkish naval forces between
 northern and southern ports is
 under way and will double the
 naval power in the Iskenderun-
 Mersin area during the next two
 weeks.
 As some time would be
 needed to prepare for an am-
 phibious assault on Cyprus, air
 strikes appear likely if Ankara
 decides on the need for early
 action.

 NASIR LEADS ARAB STATES IN MOVES AGAINST BONN
 Egyptian President Nasir
 has brought the Arab states
 far toward a common stand
 against West Germany in response
 to its recognition of Israel,
 but his success is not complete.
 Nasir has threatened that
 once formal West German - Is-
 raeli diplomatic relations are
 established, he will break dip-
 lomatic and economic relations
 with Bonn and recognize East
 Germany.   At a meeting of the
 13 Arab League states in Cairo
 on 13-14 March, only Morocco,
 Tunisia,and Libya did not follow
 his lead on the question of
 breaking with Bonn.   Nasir has
 apparently induced five of the
 states to announce that they
 will establish relations with
 East Germany.   Syria still has
 not agreed but is expected to
 fall in line.
 It is not yet clear, to
 what extent there will also be
 an economic break with West
 Germany.   Those states which
 have agreed to sever diplomatic
 relations are also ready to
 break economic ties in the event
 Bonn takes further "hostile"
 measures against any Arab state.
 Measures regarded as "hostile"
 probably would be Bonn's payment
 to Israel of monetary compensa-
 tion for the undelivered items
 in their recently terminated
 arms agreement, or a cutoff of
 present West German  aid to an
 Arab state.
 Egyptian pressure has al-
 ready caused repercussions  in
 Lebanon that could become seri-
 ous.    Although Lebanon in the
 end lined up with Egypt on break-
 ing with Bonn, pro-Nasirites
 have demonstrated against the
 Lebanese Government's moderate
 stand during the Cairo meetings.
 The security of President Hilu's
 regime may be undermined if it
 wavers or fails to follow Cairo's
 lead to the fullest.
 Bonn is both satisfied
 over the rapid Israeli accept-
 a.nce   of the German recognition
 offer and apprehensive lest some
 Arab states recognize East Ger-
 many, in addition to breaking
 ties with West Germany.   Bonn
 of:Picials have taken a concilia-
 tory line toward the Arab states
 other than Egypt, and thus far
 Bonn has limited itself to offi-
 cial protests against the attacks

 BURUNDI STILL UNSTABLE AS KING VACATIONS IN EUROPE
 The political situation in
 Burundi, which revolves around
 the endemic Tutsi-Hutu tribal
 struggle for power, continues
 to simmer in the wake of the
 assassination of the Hutu prime
 minister in mid-January and the
 expulsion of the Chinese Commu-
 nist diplomats in early Febru-
 ary.  The new prime minister,
 Joseph Ba.mina., another Hutu,
 has yet to consolidate his posi-
 tion,  and the radically inclined
 Tutsi leaders continue to seek
 ways to re-establish their in-
 fluence.
 The King, who has asserted
 a, strong personal role in recent
 months, left on 10 March for
 two months' vacation in Europe.
 During this period he expects
 to exert his influence through
 his personal secretary and other
 individuals responsible directly
 to him.   Just before he left,
 the King moved key government
 SE CRE'T
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ministries--Justice and Informa-
 tion --into the royal secretariat
 under his personal control.   He
 already directly ruled the army
 and gendarmerie.  The King also
 dissolved parliament, apparently
 to preclude any steps to oust
 Ba.mina, there.
 The US Embassy in Bujumbura
 is concerned that the Tutsis
 may nevertheless act during the
 King's absence and believes
 that disturbances and even an-
 other assassination cannot be
 discounted.   It fears that the
 King's inexperienced appointees
 and the timid prime minister ma.y
 be easy prey to the veteran
 Tutsi plotters and that Tutsi
 extremists will be encouraged
 to try to return Burundi to the
 pro-Communist camp.   The radical
 foreign minister recently de-
 clared on his own that Burundi
 would resume diplomatic relations
 with Peiping when the political
 situation becomes "more settled."

 BRITISH-RULED HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES HOLD ELECTIONS
 Elections held this month and
 next in Bechuanaland and Basuto-
 land--British High Commission ter-
 ritories adjacent to South Africa
 --are determining what kind of in-
 digenous governments these terri-
 tories will have when, as seems
 probable,  they become independent
 next year.   The viability of each
 state will depend on cooperation
 from South Africa, yet each is
 under increasing  pressures to
 serve as a, forward base for Afri-
 can nationalists seeking to over-
 throw South Africa's white regime.
 In the 1 March elections in
 Bechuanaland, Seretse Khama.--a
 proponent of close and friendly
 relations with South Africa--and
 his Bechuanaland Democratic Party
 (BDP) won 28 of the 31 popularly
 elected seats in a newly enlarged
 Legislative Assembly.   Now prime
 minister, Seretse has announced
 his determination to foster South
 African trade and investment, and
 has indicated that Bechuanaland
 will not join in any economic sanc-
 tions against Pretoria.   He argues
 that other African states must
 recognize the geographic realities
 for a nation of only 500,000 with
 a primitive pastoral economy, sit-
 uated amidst white-ruled South
 Africa, Southwest Africa,  and Rho-
 desia..   Seretse is aiming for com-
 plete independence by September
 1966, and Britain is likely to con-
 cur.
 Basutoland, where elections
 are due next month, has relatively
 bleak prospects for independent
 existence separate from South Af -
 rica., which completely surrounds
 this small, barren territory and
 provides indispensable employment
 for at least 100 , 000 of its 800 , 000
 population.   Basutoland politics
 are, however, the most volatile of
 the three territories.  The coun-
 try has become a haven for South
 African subversives, and the mili-
 tant antiwhite Pan-African Con-
 gress, headquartered in Maseru,
 has linked itself with the strong-
 est local party, the Basutoland
 Congress Party (BCP).   The BCP
 seeks to displace the tribal chiefs,
 who retain their ascendancy with
 British backing.
 Elections for the Basutoland
 Assembly have been repeatedly post-
 poned ostensibly because of Brit-
 ish fears of serious violence be-
 tween the BCP and the two tradi-
 tionalist parties which favor col-
 laboration with South Africa.  The
 election delays have increased the
 ti^a.ditiona.lists'   cchances,   but
 it is doubtful that any indigenous
 regime could effectively restrain
 the militant refugees.        Britain
 is pledged to grant independence
 within a year of the elections,
 urLless flagrant disorders occur.
 In South Africa, the ruling
 Nationalist Party is anxious to
 have friendly or at least passive
 neighbors, and its spokesmen say
 they will pursue a constructive
 policy of aid toward Basutoland
 and Bechuanaland, as well as Swazi-
 land, the third High Commission
 territory, where traditionalist
 elements are strongest and inde-
 pendence may be deferred several
 years.   But hostility from these
 territories against South Africa.   25X1
 would probably be countered with
 harsh and crippling restrictions on
 trade or migrant labor.

 FRENCH MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS REVEAL WEAKNESS OF GAULLISTS
 The most noteworthy result of
 France's municipal elections on 14
 March--the first of two rounds--
 was the Gaullists'  failure to shake
 the local fiefs of the old-line
 parties.   The returns indicate that
 the Gaullist Union for the New Re-
 public (UNR) was unable to improve
 much on the meager showing it made
 in the last municipal elections six
 years ago, when it was in its or-
 ganizational stage.
 The customary runoff ballot
 will take place on 21 March.   This
 year, however, a Gaullist-inspired
 electoral law revision prohibiting
 any change in party lists between
 the two ballots in cities of over
 30,000 people helped decide an un-
 usually large number of contests
 in the first round.   Definitive
 results were obtained in two thirds
 of the 159 cities in question.
 Only in Paris did the new elec-
 toral law accomplish the polariza-
 tion of leftists around the Commu-
 nists and of moderates around the
 UNR that the Gaullists had hoped
 for.          As a result the Gaullists
 will probably come out on top in
 at least 9 of the 14 Parisian dis-
 tricts on the second ballot andthere-
 by gain an absolute majority in the
 30-member Paris Municipal Council.
 Marseille Mayor Gaston Def-
 ferre, the principal opposition can-
 didate for the presidential race in
 December, has a comfortable lead
 over both the Communists and the UNR.
 Barring an unlikely coalition of
 these two elements against him,  he
 should easily win re-election as a
 councilman in the runoff.   His re-
 designation as mayor would then seem
 assured--enabling him to retain his
 base for the presidential campaign.
 SIGNS OF NEW DOMESTIC OPPOSITION TO
 Although Portugal continues
 to present a facade of passive po-
 litical conformity,  there are signs
 of economic discontent containing
 a potential for political unrest.
 In northern Portugal middle-
 income businessmen who have been
 supporters of the Salazar regime
 are reportedly dissatisfied with
 1964 tax regulations which were in-
 stituted to finance military op-
 erations in Portuguese Africa.
 They feel the new taxes discrimi-
 nate against them in favor of more
 influential people.   This has led
 them to question the regime's Af-
 rican policy.
 Rising prices and discontent
 with low wages are also generat-
 ing complaints from regime support-
 ers.   Industrialists are dissatis-
 fied with the rigidity of wage pol-
 icies, especially in areas where
 the emigration rate is high.   These
 irritants are blamed on the govern-
 ment because it controls the econ-
 omy.   Various major industries are
 reportedly ready to raise wages,
 but Premier Salazar made it clear
 in a recent major speech that
 wage pressures must be resisted for
 the sake of stability.
 Another potential ally of the
 traditional intellectual opposition
 may be small rural landowners, who
 expect shortly to be subjected to
 higher real estate appraisals.

 CASTRO CRITICIZES COMMUNIST WORLD RIFT AND VIETNAM POLICY
 In a speech broadcast
 over Radio Havana's world-wide
 facilities on 13 March, Fidel
 Castro declared that the Sino-
 Soviet dispute is diverting
 the "socialist camp" away from
 its primary task of struggling
 against "Yankee imperialism."
 He was especially critical of
 the failure of Moscow and Pei-
 ping to come to Hanoi's aid
 with "arms and men."
 In Castro's view,  the
 division in the Communist world
 only encourages the US to step
 up its attacks in Southeast
 Asia and diminishes the pres-
 tige of international Communism.
 He also asserted that "as long
 as we have imperialism in front
 attacking,  it would be ridicu-
 lous to sit down and discuss
 whether they are greyhounds or
 mongrels,  whether they are made
 of paper or iron."
 The Soviet Union was the
 chief target of Castro's barbs.
 He implied that Moscow should
 take risks in Southeast Asia
 today that it refused to take
 during the Cuban missile crisis
 in 1962.   Castro boasted that
 the Cuban people had welcomed
 the introduction of Soviet
 strategic missiles into Cuba
 even though they realized that
 war could result,  and that they
 had "disagreed with their being
 taken away."  Referring to the
 Vietnam situation, Castro said,
 "we don't go for the idea of
 shutting our mouths and pre-
 tending we are morons to see
 whether the Americans spare our
 lives."
 Castro was also critical of
 discussions of differences among
 Communists "unless they can
 yield something positive."   This
 seems to have been a veiled ref-
 erence to the recent "consulta-
 tive" meeting of Communist par-
 ties in Moscow.   A Cuban dele-
 gation headed by Raul Castro was
 on hand for that meeting, but
 the indications are that Cuba's
 decision to attend was made only
 when it became clear that the
 participants would not be asked
 to agree to measures which would
 further exacerbate the Sino-
 Soviet controversy.

 PERONISTS GAIN IN ARGENTINE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS
 The initial count of the
 14 March election in Argentina,
 in which half of the 192 Cham-
 ber of Deputies seats were at
 stake,  indicates that President
 Illia's People's Ra.dica.l Civic
 Union  (UCRP) came out with its
 plurality bloc of about 70 seats
 still intact.   The most spectac-
 ular                           winners, however, were
 the various Peronist-oriented
 parties which cumulatively out-
 polled the UCRP and raised their
 representation in the chamber
 from 17 to around 50 seats.
 These gains were achieved de-
 spite the employment of a. pro-
 portional representation system
 specifically designed to prevent
 the Peronists from winning a
 large number of seats.   The re-
 maining 70-odd seats are dis-
 tributed among 10 or 11 small
 parties.
 Hard-line Peronist deputies,
 mostly from the Popular Union
 (UP) party, probably will form
 the nucleus of a large opposi-
 tion bloc which may not augur
 well for the government's leg-
 islative program.   It was these
 same Peronists who abetted and
 directed much of the antigov-
 ernment labor agitation that
 marked the Argentine scene last
 year,  culminating in Peron's
 abortive attempt to return in
 December.   Since the elections,
 they have also renewed their
 cry that Peron's return is es-
 sential to the "pacification"
 of the country.
 In any case, there is likely
 to be a polarization of forces
 in the chamber between the Peron-
 ist bloc and the UCRP.   Some
 of the small parties which have
 recently withdrawn their sup-
 port from the government pro-
 gram can be expected to gravitate
 toward the Peronists.   The final
 analysis may show that success
 of the government's program will
 depend on continued backing from
 the approximately 20 neo-Peron-
 ist deputies--those favoring
 Peronism without Peron.
 There are as yet no indi-
 cations of what impact the elec-
 tion results have registered,
 but they can scarcely avoid en-
 couraging the belief, particu-
 larly among the military, that
 Illia's "tolerance" of the Peron-
 ists has backfired.   It is too
 eELrly to judge how the military
 will react.   However, they will
 probably allow the Illia. govern-
 ment at least some period of
 grace to determine whether it
 coin govern effectively in the
 face of a strengthened and much
 more virulent opposition.

 There is increasing pres-
 sure on General Barrientos to
 resign from the junta he now
 heads by 26 March if he intends
 to remain a candidate for the
 Bolivian presidency in elections
 set for September.   The case for
 resignation is based on a con-
 stitutional requirement that
 presidential candidates who hold
 public office resign 180 days
 before the election date.
 Opposition parties and dis-
 contented labor groups are spear-
 heading the drive to get Barrien-
 tos to step down.   However, many
 Bolivians who are not politically
 opposed to Barrientos--including
 some army officers--agree that he
 should comply with the constitu-
 tion.   Thus far,   Barrientos has
 refused to do so on the grounds
 that the requirement does not ap-

 government.   In reality, he fears

 dominant Nationalists remain
 unresolved.   The assembly, how-

 ports Barrientosi
 In
 a, private conversation with US
 officials, Ovando expressed the
 view that military opinion would
 leave Barrientos no choice but
 to resign.
 Negotiations between the
 two parties are expected to
 continue, and it is possible
 that some compromise will be
 worked out.   The indications
 are,          however,  that the Nation-
 alists are unwilling to meet
 any important Liberal demands.
 As a consequence,  the more
 militant factions of the Liberal
 Party may join the Communists
 and other subversives in armed
 opposition to the regime. ~~ 25X1
